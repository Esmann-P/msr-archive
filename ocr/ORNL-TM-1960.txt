ABSTRACT

Two molten-salt convection loops have been operated in
beam hole HN-1 of the Oak Ridge Research Reactor. Both loops
contained molten-fluoride fuel salt (7LiF-BeF,-ZrF,;-UF,;) with
enriched uranium varying in concentration up to 2.1 mole %.

Irradiation of the first molten-salt convection loop
experiment in the ORR was terminated on August 8, 1966, after
1484 hr of in-pile operation and development of 1.1 X 1018
fissions/cc (0.27% 23°U burnup) in the ‘ILiF-BeF,-ZrF,-UF,
(65.16-28.57-4.90-1.36 mole %) fuel. Average fuel power den-
sities up to 105 w/cc of salt were obtained in the fuel chan-
nels of the core of MSRE-grade graphite.

Irradiation of the second loop experiment in the ORR was
terminated on April 4, 1967, after 1955 hr of in-pile opera-
tion and develo opment of 8.2 X 108 fissions/cc (1.2% 23°U
burnup) in the 'LiF-BeF;-ZrF;-UF; (65.26-28.17-4.84-1.73 mole%)
fuel. (The uranium concentration was increased to 2.1 mole %
for a short time near the end of the experiment.) Average
fission heat density in the fuel salt channels of the graphite
core was 165 w/cc when at full power.

Successful operation of the major heating, cooling, tem-
perature control, and sampling systems was demonstrated; how-
ever, both loop experiments were terminated because of breaks
in the primary loop systems. :

 

“1. INTRODUCTION

The molten-salt convection loops are designed to irradiate a represen-

tative molten-salt fuel circulating in contact with graphite and Hastelloy N
at fuel fission pover densities up to 200 w/ce in the Oak Ridge Research

Reactor. Long-term in-pile operation (one year) to achieve high uranium
burnup (wp to 50%) is an objective of the irradiation experiments. Provi-
sions for sampling and replacement of both gas and salt permit condi tions
in the loop to be determined and to be altered during operation.

- Irradiation experiments in the loop allow us to study the graphite-
salt compatibility, Hastelloy N-salt compatibility, fuel-salt stability,
and fission-product chemistry. The interaction of fission products with
graphite, metal, fuel and gas phases can be investigated, as can the.
effects of irradiation on the respective materials.

In order to maintain and control temperatures around the loop circuit,
‘sufficient heating and cooling capacity is provided to remove up to 14 kw
of fission and gamma heat generated at full power operation and to maintain
the salt molten when the reactor is shut down. |

Operational experience with two in-pile molten-salt loop. experiments

is described in this report.
2. DESCRIPTION OF REACTOR IRRADIATION FACILITY

Both in-pile molten-salt loops were operated in horizontal beam hole
HN-1 of the ORR (Fig. 1), which is approximately 8 in. diam and extends
12 ft from a point adjacent to the reactor lattice to the outside face of
the reactor shielding. Two shielded equipment chambers contain the neces-
sary auxiliary equipment needed for the salt sampling and addition system.
Beam hole HN-1 and the associated instrumentation were previously used to
operate in-pile loop experiments with uranyl sulfate sclutions and thorium

oxide slurries in support of the Homogeneous Reactor Program.

3. DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION OF FIRST LOOP EXPERIMENT

3.1 Description

The main body of the loop assembly was fabricated of 2-in. sched-40
Hastelloy N (INOR-8) pipe which contained a graphite core. The graphite
core had eight 1/4-in. holes which served as fuel passages. Fuel volume
in the graphite core was ~43 cm? in a total loop fuel volume of ~75 cm.

A gas separation tank served as a salt reservoir and provided for a liquid-
vapor interface. A return line from the gas separation tank to the bottom
of the graphite core completed the loop circuit. Calrod electric heaters
and cooling coils imbedded in a sprayed nickel matrix surrounded the core
section, gas separation tank, and return line to provide temperature con-

trol and to maintain the thermel gradients necessary to induce convective

flow. A drawing of the convection loop assembly is shown in Fig. 2, and
Fig. 3 is a photograph of the partially assembled loop showing the fuel
flow channels in the core graphite. |

Tubes of capillary dimensions interconnected the vapor space of the
gas separation tank with.remotely located pressure monitoring equipment
and a gas sampling and addition system.. The salt sample line (0.100 in.
OD X 0.050 in. ID) was ~12 ft long and was traced with electric calrod
heaters which were imbedded, along with the sample line, in & sprayed
nickel matrix. The sample line was routed to the salt sampling and eddi-
tion system in the shielded equipment chamber et the reactor shield face,

A manually operated retraction screw was used to position the loop
so that the neutron flux and resultant nuclear power generation in the
loop could be varied from the maximum (fully inserted position) to ~1% of
maximum by retracting the loop package some 9 in. away from the reactor
lattice. Figure 4 is a diagram of the salt sampling and addition system,
and Fig. 5 is a photograph of the system as fabricated for the second in-
pile loop.

3.2 Operation

The loop package (shield plug, sampling and addition system, and loop
assembly) was operated in an out-of-pile mockup facility for 187 hr with
solvent salt without uranium. Composition of the solvent salt was
714F-BeF,-ZrF, (64.7-30.1-5.2 mole %). Nominal operating temperatures
around the loop ranged from 650°C in the core section to 550°C in the cold
leg return line. During this out-of-pile test period, three salt samples
were removed from the loop and five salt additions were made without diffi-
culty. Salt circulation in the loop was estimated to be 5 to 10 ce/min
based on heat balance measurements around the cold leg.

The loop was removed from the mockup facility and installed in beam
hole HN-1 of the ORR and brought to operating temperature on June 9, 1966.
Operation with solvent salt continued until July 27, 1967, when enriched
uranium (as "IiF-UF, eutectic) was added. In-pile operation was continued
until August 10, 1966, when the reactor was shut down and the loop removed
because of a fuel leak from a break in the capillary sample line near its

point of attachment to the loop core section.

During in-pile operation two salt samples were removed from the loop
and three salt additions were made. While preparing to remove salt sample
No. 8, a leak was detected in the sampling system. This leak precluded
further sampling operation. Even though no additional samples could be
taken, the aeddition of 71iF-UF; fuel and one final addition of solvent
salt to adjust the loop inventory were subsequently made.

A tabulation of the operating time for the first loop is given in
Table 1. Operating temperatures around the loop circuit with the reactor
down and at full power (30 Mw) and with the loop fully inserted are shown
in Table 2. Thermocouple locations for the temperatures shown in Table 2
are noted in Fig. 6. Total nuclear heat generated in the loop as a func-
tion of distance from the reactor tank is shown in Fig. 7.

4. EVALUATION OF SYSTEM PERFORMANCE, IN-FIIE SALT LOOP NO. 1

Several feilures of component parts of the loop and associated systems
occurred during in-pile operation. Finally, leskage of fuel salt from a
bresk in the salt sample line caused the first loop experiment to be ter-.
minated. All parts of the system which failed were examined in hot cell
facilities to determine the cause of failure before proceeding with design
and fabrication of loop No. 2. These failures and the loop performance are

discussed below.

4.1 Temperature Control

Heaters. The molten-salt loop package used 21 heaters to control salt
temperature in the loop and to heat the salt sample line and associated
sampling and addition system. All heaters were 1/8 in. OD, Inconel sheathed,
magnesium-oxide insulated, with a Nichrome V heating element. These heaters
are designed for continuous operation at temperatures to 870°C. The heaters
on the loop circuit were operated continuously at various power levels while
those on the sampling and addition systems were used intermittently as
required. There were no heater failures during the 1671 hr of loop opera-
tion. |

Coolers. Four separate coolers were used to remove the 8.8 kw of fis-
sion and gemma heat produced when the loop was fully inserted and, in con-
Junction with the electric heaters, provided temperature control. Two of
these coolers consisting of 1/4=in. X 0.035-in. wall, 304 stainless steel
cooling coils, which used air and/or an air-vater mixture as coolant, sur-
rounded the core section where the maximum nuclear heat generation occurred.
The two coolers provided for countercurrent coolant flow. Coolant for the
No. 1 cooler entered at the top of the core section and exited at the bot-
tom. Coolant for the No. 2 cooler entered at the bottom and exited at the
top. Both cooling coils were wrapped around the core section in machined
grooves, tack welded at each end to hold the coil in place, and then bonded
to the Hastelloy N core body with nickel-sprayed material.

Another cooler consisting of a 3/16-in. OD X 0.035-in. wall, Inconel
cooling coil, which used only air as coolant, was used on the cold leg.

For the gas separation tank an annular jacket cooler of 1/16-in. thick 304

 
 

 

 

 

14

stainless steel with air as the coolant medium was used. Although calcu=~-
lations indicated that this cooling method would be adequate, air alone
proved to be inadequate to maintain the temperature of the gas separation
tank at temperatures below 600°C and a water injection system was added to
the incoming air after in-pile operation had commenced.

The heat removal rate of the loop coolers wes entirely adequate, except
for the gas separation tank as noted above, to remove the 8.8 kw of fission
and gamma heat generated when the reactor was at its maximum power of 30 Mw
and with the loop in the fully inserted position. Even after the loss of
one of the two cooling coils (see below) around the loop core section, the

loop could be operated at full power (8.8 kw).
4.2 Problems Encountered During In-Pile Operation

Shortly before the addition of uranium to the loop, tests indicated
that the No. 1 core cooler was leaking at a point near the loop (inside the
loop container can). This cooler was removed from service by plugging off
both ends. However, by referring to Teble 2, it can be seen that tempera-
tures in the top section of the loop core were quite high (up to 784°C in
the upper fuel passage) because of the loss of the No. 1 cooler. Subse-
quent examination of the loop in the hot cells showed that this cooling
coil had broken at the point of attachment to the core body on the exit
end. A photograph of the bresk is shown in Fig. 8, and a photomicrograph
of the break is shown in Fig. 9.

After the uranium addition, the reactor was brought to 30 Mw and the
loop was inserted in incremental steps over a period of ~160 hr in order
to measure nuclear heat generation and to test operation. After ~92 hr of
operation in the fully inserted position, & leek in the cooling jacket
around the gas separation tank (using an air-water mixture as coolant)
allowed water to enter the loop container causing erratic temperatures in
the bottom part of the loop — especially at the salt sample line. Subse-
quently, vater entered the smell equipment chamber at the fece of the
reactor shielding where it was detected by a water level probe.

The reactor was shut down, the equipment chamber opened end dried, and

reactor operation resumed. Because of the lesk in the jacket cooler, water /

injection could not be used in the cooling air to the gas separation tank,
and this loss of cooling capacity limited the loop operation to a position
at 1 in. retracted (~70% of full power). A few hours after reactor startup
the 1oop was retracted out of the high flux region and the salt was frozen
when high radiation levels were observed in the charcoal trap in the loop
container off-gas line — indicating £1ssion-product leakage from the loop.
Preparations for loop removal were begun, and on August 10, 1966, the
reactor was shut down and the loop removed from beam hole HN-1.
Examination of the loop in hot cell facilities showed that fuel salt

had leaked from the loop at a break in the salt sample line near its point
of attachment to the loop core section. It appears that this failure can

be attributed to the water leakage described above, which caused the nickel

spray bonding the heaters to the salt sample line to break, leaving the

_capillery sample line (0.100 in. OD X 0.050 in. ID) unsupported. This line

then failed because of excessive mechanical stresses.

in-pile operation of loop No. 1.

5. DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION OF IN-FILE SALT LOOP NO. 2

5.1 Loop Description

The design of the second in-pile salt convection loop was essentially
identical to the first loop experiment and is shown in Fig. 10. Problems
encountered in the first experiment, described previously, and subsequent
postirradiation hot-cell examination led to modifications to the second
loop which were designed to eliminate these problems. These modificationa

are described below.

5.1.1 Core Cooling Coils

The material for the 1/4-in. OD X 0.035-in. wall core coolant tubes
was changed from 304 stainless steel to Inconel for the second loop. -Al-
though stainless steel tubing should have been entirely adequate for the
intended service, Inconel is the preferred material for exposure to high-
temperature steam (~400°C) generated when air-water mixtures are used as
coolant. Since the rupture of the No. 1 core cooler occurred adjacent to
a point where the tube was tack welded to the core wall, the tack weld was
eliminated in favor of a mechanical strap attachment. Further, an expansion
loop to relieve stresses was included in each of the coolant tube outlet
lines. A test of the adequacy of the modified core cooling coils was made
by operating a mockup of the redesigned coil with air-water mixtures as
coolant for more than 400 hr at temperatures expected in-pile, including
120 thermal shock cycles (600-350°C), with no sign of difficulty. Thermal
cycling occurs during a reactor setback and startup, and it was estimated
that no more than about 20 such thermal cycles would occur during a year

of operation.

541.2 Salt Semple Line

The two failures which occurred in the capillary tube (0.100 in. OD Xx
0.050 in. ID) used in the salt sampling and addition system of loop No. 1
resulted from excessive mechanical stress. Consequently, the wall thick-
less of these tubes was increased (0.170 in. OD X ‘0.060 in. ID), and addi-.
tional mechanical support was added — particularly on the section of the

line for a distance of ~9 in. from its point of attachment to the loop core.

5.1.3 Cooler for the Gas Separation Tank

The cooling Jacket of 1/16-in.-thick stainless steel surrounding the
reservoir tank used in the first loop was replaced by an Inconel tube
wrapped around the outside of the tank and attached by means of sprayed-on
nickel. Also, provisions for use of an air-water mixture as coolant were
added since it was found that air alone did not provide sufficient cooling
in the first experiment.

5.1.4 Salt Flow by Convection

Continuous salt circulation by thermal convection was not maintained
in the first experiment, and salt flow rates of 5 to 10 cm? /min were sub-
stantially below the calculated rate of ~45 cm? /min for a temperature dif-
ference of 100°C between the salt in the loop core section and in the cold
leg. It was concluded that the occasional loss of salt circulation was
caused by gas accumulation in the top of the core section where salt from
the eight 1/4-in. fuel passages in the graphite was collected in an annular
ring before entering the gas separation tank. The low salt flow rate could
also be partially attributed to flow restriction caused by the design of
the top and bottom salt flow passéges in the graphite core. Accordingly,
the salt flow channels at the top and bottom of the eight 1/4-in. holes in
the graphite core were redesigned to provide & better flow pattern as shown
in Fig. 11 which can be compared with the original design (Fig. 3). Further,
the top. and bottom of the core section, horizontally oriented on the first

loop, were inclined at 5° to minimize trapping of gas.
5.2 Operation of In-Pile Salt Loop No. 2
5.2.1 Out-of-Pile Test Operation

The loop package was operated in the out-of-pile mockup facility for
248 hr. In order to remove potential contaminants such as oxygen, water,
etc., the empty loop was flushed with argon gas and vacuum pumped at 600°C
"for 20 hr. The loop was charged with solvent salt (without uranium) and
operated for 77 hr and then drained to flush the loop. A second charge of

solvent salt was subsequently added, and operation at temperature was con-
tinued for an additional 171 hr. During these mockup operations, 15 salt
samples were removed from the loop and ‘12 salt additions were made. No.
problems were encountered.

Salt circulation by convective flow was estimated to be 30 to 40 cc/nin
‘as determined both by heat balance measurements around the cold leg return
line and by adding an increment of heat in a stepwise fashion to one point
in the loop and recording the time required for the heated salt to traverse
- 8 known distance as recorded on thermocouples around the loop circuit. ‘This
flow rate is a five-fold increase over the rate observed in loop No. 1 &nd
is attributed to the modifications described previously. However, occasional
loss of flow still occurred. One possible explanation for this is that a
sufficient temperature difference was not maintained between the salt in the
hot and cold legs. This is supported by the fact that flow, when lost, could
be restored by adjusting the temperature around the loop circuit. Since
occasional flow loss did not adversely affect the loop operation in-pile,
this was not considered to be a problem of any serious consequence.

After satisfactorily completing out-of-pile testing, the loop was trans-
ferred to the ORR, installed in beam hole HN-1, and in-pile operation was
begun on January 12, 1967.

5.2.2 In-Pile Operation of Loop No. 2

At the start of in-pile operation, the loop contained the solvent salt
charged to the loop during the mockup operation. In-plle operation with
this solvent salt continued for 417 hr during which the loop was operated
at various distances from the reactor lattice to determine operating param-
eters and to measure gamma heat generation. Uranium as 'IiF-UF, eutectic
(93% enriched) was added on January 30, 1967, to bring the uranium concentra-
tion in the salt to 1.72 mole %, which was expected to. produce an average
fission-power generation of 200 w/cm® in the 43 cm? of fuel salt in the core
section. This estimate was basetl on an expected average thermal neutron
flux of ~2 X 103 in beam hole HN-1. Subsequent measurements of the nuclear
power ‘generation as & function of distance from the reactor lattice gave a
value of 165 w/em? for average core £ission-pover density with the loop fully
inserted (Fig. 12). This indicated that the flux was ~1 X 1013,

In order to increase the £1ssion-pover density in the loop, a second | i *
addition of enriched uranium (as 7IiF-UF, eutectic) was made on March 7,
1967, to bring the uranium concentration in the fuel salt to 2.1 mole %.

This addition was expected to increase the average fission-power density

to the desired value of 200 w/cm® average in the loop core (graphite) region.
However, as a result of a rearrangement of the fuel loading in the ORR Just
prior to the second addition of uranium, there was essentially no.increase

in fission power. This rearrangement of the reactor fuel reduced the thermal
flux in beam hole HN-1 in an amount sufficient to compensate for the increased
uranium in the fuel salt. Previous rearrangements presumably also accounted
for the lower than anticipated neutron flux observed initially.

Loop operation was continued and the ORR was brought to full power
(30 Mw) on March 11, 1967. On March 14 the reading of the radiation monitor
on the charcoal trap in the loop container sweep gas line had increased to
18 mr/hr from the normal level of essentially zero. Some & hr later the
radiation level had increased to 3.4 r/hr. This reading did not increase
further until March 17 when it increased rapidly (over a period of ~3 hr)
to ~100 r/hr which indicated leakage of fission products from the loop into
the container can surrounding it. At this point the loop was retracted out
of the high flux and the loop temperatures were reduced to ~400°C to freeze
the salt. This caused the radiation in the charcoal trap to decrease to

- From March 17 to March 23, 1967, the loop was operated in a position
where the flux levels were 1 to 2% of that when the loop was fully inserted.
During this time, the fuel salt was kept frozen (~400°C) except for brief
periods when it was melted in an attempt to locate the point of leakage.
It was concluded that the leak was in the vicinity of the gas separation
tank and continued operation of the loop. was not possible.
From March 27 to March 31, 1967, the fuel salt was drained from the
loop by sampling. By this procedure, requiring removal of 10 samples (12 to
25 g per sample), the loop inventory was reduced from 216.8 g to 2.1 g. The
ORR was shut down on April 4, 1967, and the loop removed from beam hole HN-1
and transferred to hot cell facilities for examination. BN

6. EXAMINATION OF FAILURE IN CORE OUTLET FIFE

Following its removal from the reactor, the loop package was trans-
ferred to hot-cell facilities where the convection loop was removed from
its container ean for examination. No evidence of salt leakage from the
loop was seen by visual examination. The loop was then pressurized to
~100 psig with helium and "Leak Tec" solution applied to the external sur-
faces of the loop. By this technique a gas leak was observed in the core
outlet tube adjacent to the point where it was attached to the core body.

Figure 14 is a photograph of the loop taken in the hot cell and indicates
the point where the gas leak was seen. Subsequently, sections of the loop

were cut out for metallographic examination and a crack through the wall

the circumference of the pipe. There was no evidence that fuel salt had

7. DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The four failures encountered during operation of loop No. 1 were

~ examined in hot-cell facilities. Based on this examination and the oper-

ating history of the loop, corrective measures were taken in the design and
construction of loop No. 2 (refer to Section 5). None of these failures
were encountered during the operation of in-pile salt loop ‘No. 2.

Analysis. of the causes of the failure of the outlet pipe in loop No. 2
had led to the conclusion that this failure was probably caused by excessive
stresses resulting from differential thermal expansion of the loop compo-
nents (core, cold leg, gas separation tank, and outlet pipe). Computer code
MEC-21 (ref. 1) was used to determine the stresses developed due to the
thermal expansion of the piping system. Calculations of the piping stresses
in the loop were made for two conditions: (1) for the temperature profile
around the loop at full power operating conditions, and (2) for the temper-
ature profile changes observed during a reactor setback.

For both conditions (1) and (2) the piping stress analysis indicates
that the maximum stress from thermal expansion occurs in the core outlet
pipe where the failure occurred. For the normel operating condition the
bending moment produces a stress of ~10,000 psi in the pipe wall (tension
on the top and compression on the bottom). For the temperatures encountered
during a reactor setback, the direction of the bending moment is reversed
causing a stress of ~17, 000 psi in the pipe wall (compression on top and
tension on bottom).

The entire loop was fabricated on Hastelloy N (INOR-8) which is also
the material used for the MSRE. Materials used in the loop were obtained
from the MSRE stock of specially ordered heats of Hastelloy N. Data on the

Data contained in the referenced report? indicate thet, for & tempera-
ture of 1200°F (650°C) and for an irresdiation dose of 5 X 10%? nvt, stresses
of 8000 to 10,000 psi would produce rupture after 10,000 hr. Stress-rupture
properties of Hastelloy N at the 1350°F (732°C) temperature of the core out-

01° nvt are below those at

the temperature of 1200°F (650°C) used for design purposes.
For the in-pile molten-salt loop there sre no significant primary

stresses since the loop is operated at or near the ambient pressure (loop
pressure is maintained between 12 and 20 psia). Thermal stresses, although
important, are usually of less concern because once encountered they tend
to be self-limiting provided the material has sufficient ductility. How-
ever, tests indicate that the ductility of Hastelloy N is reduced such that
strains of 1 to 3% can result in fracture at temperatures of 1200 to 1300°F

0° nvt or more.

and an irradiation dose of 1 X 1
For the design of the in-pile salt loop, thermal stresses in the core
wall (Hastelloy N) and in the core cooling coil (304 stainless steel for
‘loop No. 1 and Inconel for loop No. 2) were evaluated. Based on heat flow
"at 10 kw of nuclear heat gerieration, these stresses were estimated to be
about 10,000 psi. For the core wall at 650°C and a dose rate of up to
1 x 1013 n/cm?- sec, this thermal stress was considered acceptable for oper-
ating times to 10,000 hr or more than the one year projected &s the maximum
time of in-pile operation. Stresses caused by differential thermal expansion
of the loop pipe were not calculated prior to in-pile operation. For normal
operating conditions temperature differences of 50 to 100°C around the loop
circuit did not seem sufficient to produce undue stresses. In particuler,
. no evidence of stress or any other failure was observed during in-pile oper-

ation of loop No. 1.

Tt now appears that several factors could have caused the failure in
"the core outlet pipe. First, the temperature of the section of pipe where
failure occurred was at a temperature of ~1350°F (732°C). Thus, a thermal
stress of ~10,000 psi calculated to exist in the outlet pipe may have been
sufficient to cause failure. A second and more likely cause of failure is
the rapid stress reversal (+10, 000 psi to —17,500 psi) calculated for the
thermal shock caused by a reactor setback. Approximately six such cycles
were encountered during in-pile operation. In particular one such cycle
occurred on March 3 after a dose accumulation of ~2 X 10*° nvt. It was on
March 11 that evidence of fission-product leakage from the loop was first
observed. Whether or not such thermal cycles caused the failure is specu-
lative, but the stress reversal resulting from such cycles would certainly
appear likely to contribute to failure at the point of maximum stress where

the temperature was 1350°F and after accumulation of a radiation dose suffi-

cient to affect the strength and ductility of Hastelloy N.

Some thought has been given to possible design changes that might elim-
"inate or at least reduce thermal stresses — possibly expansion joints for
example. However, such designs, as well as the present loop configuration,
requite a material with more strength and ductility than the present
Hastélloy N possesses at temperatures and radiation doses anticipated for
meaningful in-pile loop experiments. Therefore, & material exhibiting
“bettér physical properties under these conditions is needed for future in-
pild loops designed to obtain data at high fuel fission power and long-term
opefation. Improvement in the physical properties of Hastelloy N — espe-
cially improving its resistance to neutron irradiation — is being given
ma Jor attention.% Work has shown that additions of titanium, zirconium,
and hafnium will reduce the radiation damage of Hastelloy N. In-pile and
out-of-pile tests are being run on these modified Hastelloy N alloys. To
date, laboratory-size vacuum melts and small 100-1b commercidl melts are
baing evaluated. A commercial melt of an improved Hastelloy N containing
1/24 Ti addition has been ordered, and it is anticipated that this material
will be used for the next in-pile convection loop assembly. |
