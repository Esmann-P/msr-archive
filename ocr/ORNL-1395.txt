SUMMARY

This paper concerns itself with forced convection heat transfer in long,
smooth pipes whose flowing fluids contain uniform volume heat sources; also,
heat is transferred uniformly to or from the fluids at the pipe walls. Di-
mensionless differences between the pipe wall temperature and the mixed-mean
fluid temperature are evaluated in terms of several dimensionless moduli. These

analyses pertain to liquid metals as well as ordinary fluids.

INTRODUCTION

At times it is necessary to determine the radial temperature distributions
in flowing fluids that possess internal sources of heat generation. Consider the
heated-tube system (electric current passing through the tube walls) which is now
so commonly being used to measure convective heat transfer conductances. It is
of interest to known how much the electrical volume heat source influences the
radial temperature distribution when a significant fraction of this source is
generated within the flowing fluid. Such volume heat source problems also arise
in fluid flow systems in which continuous chemical reactions are being supported
within the fluids; a combustion heating system represents a specific example.

Particular volume heat source systems have been considered in this paper.
Mathematical temperature solutions were developed for a circular-pipe volume
heat source system for the cases of laminar and turbulent flow (reference 1).

The idealized system to be considered is defined by the following postulates:

1) Thermal and hydrodynamic patterns have been
established (long pipes).

2) Uniform volume heat sources exist within the
fluid.

3) Physical properties are not functions of
temperature.

4) Heat is transferred uniformly to or from the
fluid at the pipe wall.

5) In the case of turbulent flow the generalized
turbulent velocity profile defines the hydro-
dynamic structure.

6) In the case of turbulent flow there exists an
analogy between heat and momentum transfer.
 

A heat rate balance on a stationary differential lattice reveals the heat
transfer mechanisms which control the thermal structure within the idealized
system. At steady state, the heat generated within the lattice is lost from the
lattice by axial convection and radial conduction (in the case of laminar flow)
or radial eddy diffusion (in the case of turbulent flow). These heat rate balances

are expressed by differential equations in the following analyses.

One boundary condition for the problem consists of a uniform wall heat

where 3 is the radial heat flux and 2) is the wall heat flux. The second
boundary condition is, tq, a reference temperature, such as a wall or center-
line temperature,

t(r = rq) = ta (3)

Note, the mixed mean fluid temperature may also be specified as the reference

Downstream from the entrance region where the thermal pattern (tempera-

gradient, 2 , 1s uniform and equal to the mixed-mean axial fluid temperature

heat balance. The heat generated in a lattice whose volume is ATS dx plus

the heat transferred into (or out of) the lattice at the wall must all be lost

from the lattice by convection, that is

TURBULENT FLOW ANALYSIS

Fluid flow in a pipe under turbulent flow conditions has been characterized
in terms of a laminar sublayer contiguous to the wall, a buffer layer, and a
turbulent core by Nikuradse (reference 2), von Karman (reference 3) and others.
Figure 2 shows the well known isothermal generalized velocity profile and some
experimental data of Nikuradse (reference 2), Reichardt (reference 4), and
Laufer (reference 5). Table 1 reveals some of the specific hydrodynanic relations’
for the various flow layers in a smooth pipe; a discussion of some of the details
of this table can be found in Appendix 1.

The differential equation describing heat transfer in the pipe system for

the case of turbulent flow is

2. The analogy between heat and momentum transfer (characterized by the
postulate that the heat and momentum transfer eddy diffusivities are pro-
portional to each other and in fact nearly equal) has been proposed by
Reynolds (reference 6) and used successfully by von Karman (reference 3),
Martinelli (reference 7), and others. Thus, in the present analysis it
is postulated that the heat and momentum transfer eddy diffusivities are
equal.

THe boundary conditions are given by equations (2) and (3). The boundary
value problem denoted by equations (17), (2) and (3) can be separated into two
somewhat simpler boundary value problems whose solutions can be superposed to
yield the solution of the original problem. The two boundary value problems

to be considered are,

Equations (18) represent a flow system with a volume heat source but with no
wall heat flux, and equations (19) represent a flow system without a volume heat
source but with a uniform wall heat flux. Note, that the superposition of
equations (18) and (19) yields the boundary value problem defined by equations
(17), (2) and (3); the sum of reference temperatures tq; and tq, being equal to
the reference temperature tq? The problem defined by equations (19) has already
been analyzed by Prandtl, von Karman, Martinelli and others (see reference 7,
for example). The solution of equations (18) is carried out in the following

Paragraphs.

The radial heat flow equations (i)

Thus, the radial temperature distribution for the case of turbulent flow in
a long, smooth pipe containing a fluid with a uniform volume heat source with no
wall heat flux is given by equations (24), (29), (33), and (36); some typical
radial temperature profiles in dimensionless form are given in Figures 4 and 5.
These profiles reveal the following characteristics: 1) the dimensionless
temperature (sbove the centerline temperature) decreases as Reynolds modulus
increases, 2) the dimensionless temperature (above the centerline temperature)
decreases as the Prandtl modulus increases, and 3) dimensionless temperatures
(above centerline temperatures) are high in the flow layers near the wall where
the fluid velocities and eddy diffusivities are low. These characteristics could

also have been derived from physical reasoning.

C. Difference Between Pipe Wall and Mixed-Mean Fluid Temperatures

The superposition of solutions of the boundary value problems (18) and (19)
yields the more general boundary value problem defined by equations (17), (2), and

increments above datum temperatures. The radial temperature distribution above the
wall temperature, centerline temperature, or mixed-mean fluid temperature for the
composite boundary value problem defined by (17), (2), and (3) is obtained by
adding the radial temperature distributions sbove the wall temperatures, centerline
temperatures, or mixed-mean fluid temperatures, respectively of boundary value
problems (18) and (19). Note also that the rise in mixed-mean fluid temperature

DISCUSSION

Currently, several new forced-flow volume-heat-source analyses are being
completed. One analysis pertains to a parallel plates system which is infinite
in extent. Another analysis concerns itself with heat transfer in the thermal
entrance region of a pipe (short tube); it should be noted that laminar flow
systems in particular have long entry lengths. A third mathematical solution
pertains to laminarly flowing fluids whose viscosities are dependent on tempera-
ture; only the established flow region is being considered.

Although the experimental turbulent velocity data presented in Figure 2 seem
to be represented satisfactorily by the generalized velocity expressions in the
various layers, the exact location of vit (whether it is 3, 4, 5, 6, or 7, for
example) becomes important in boundary value problem (19) at high Prandtl moduli
(about 10 and above) and low Reynolds moduli. This region appears to need further
consideration.

It is planned to include the effects of pipe roughness and differences between
heat and momentum transfer eddy diffusivities in future forced-flow volume-heat-
source system which corresponds to the one investigated mathematically in the

present paper.

APPENDIX 1

HYDRODYNAMIC RELATIONS FOR TURBULENT FLOW IN A SMOOTH PIPE

The hydrodynamic relations for turbulent flow in a smooth pipe noted in
Table 1 are briefly considered. The velocity equations for the several flow
layers as well as the expressions for the layer thicknesses define the gener-
alized velocity profile under turbulent flow conditions. The fluid shear stress,

T, varies linearly from Ts at the wall to zero at the pipe center. The shear

stress has been postulated to be equal to T

o In the laminar sublayer and the

buffer layer because these layers lie so near the wall; the exact linear variation
is used in the turbulent core. Laminar shear stress can be expressed as the
product of the fluid mass density, kinematic viscosity, and velocity gradient,

and turbulent shear stress can be expressed as the product of the fluid mass
density, eddy diffusivity, and velocity gradient. In the buffer layer both laminar
and turbulent shear stresses must be considered, whereas in the turbulent core the
laminar shear stresses are small compared to turbulent shear stresses and are thus
neglected. Upon the substitution of the generalized velocity profile and the

shear stress variations into the shear stress equation one can solve for the
dimensionless eddy diffusivity ratio, € /? , for the buffer layer and the turbulent
core. These ratios can be reduced to the forms that appear in Table 1 with the

aid of 1) the well known hydrodynamic expression which relates the wall shear stress,
friction factor, and the mean fluid velocity in a pipe, and 2) the relation between

the friction factor and Reynolds modulus for a smooth pipe. These two expressions

APPENDIX 3
TURBULENT FORCED CONVECTION IN A LONG

PIPE WITH A UNIFORM WALL HEAT FLUX BUT
NO VOLUME HEAT SOURCES WITHIN THE FLUID

Heat-momentum transfer analogies for the case of turbulent flow in pipes
have been developed by Reynolds (reference 6), von Karman (reference 3),
Martinelli (reference 7), Lyon (reference 9) and others. These analyses
represent solutions to boundary value problem (19), the latter analyses being
more exact. Martinelli's solution expressed in terms of Nusselt, Reynolds and
Prandtl moduli is graphed in Figure 7. Note that Nusselt modulus can be ex-
pressed in terms of the wall-fluid temperature difference and the wall heat

flux (pertaining to boundary value problem (19) ),
