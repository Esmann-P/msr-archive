ABSTRACT

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE) successfully demonstrated the feasibility of generating

heat by fission in a fused-fluoride circulating fuels Most of the heat was removed from the reactor

by the fused fluoride at 1580°F.

Sodium at 1350°F was used to cool the BeO moderator. With

minor exceptions all the components proved to be adequate.

The development of components and fabrication techniques for this reactor consumed a four-

year period, during which time the technology for handling high-temperature fluids was extended

to equipment operable above 1500°F. The methods used for determining compatibility of materials

under static and dynamic conditions, standards for materials, and techniques for welding, fabri

cation, and assembly and the design criteria for pumps, seals, valves, heat exchangers, cold

traps, expansion tanks, instrumentation, preheating devices, insulation, etc., are described,

 

INTRODUCTION

A high-temperature Aircraft Reactor Experiment
(ARE) generated heat by fission of U235 in a
fused salt composed of U235F = ZrF, and NaF
for a period of 221 hr, ending on November 12,
1954. As shown in Fig. 1, the maximum equilibrium
temperature of the salt was 1580°F, with a maximum
temperature gradient of 380°F. About 25% of the
heat was transferred to sodium, which was circu-
lated at a maximum equilibrium temperature of
1350°F with a maximum temperature gradient of
120°F. The heat was then transferred from both
salt and sodium to helium in separate closed
circuits and was finally transferred to water. The
maximum heat power generated was 2500 kw, and
the total amount of energy was 96,000 kwhr. The
entire operation was performed in remotely
controlled equipment in three concrete enclosed
pits. !

Prior to the nuclear power operation the systems
and components were checked out? by operating
the fused-salt circuit for a period of 388 hr at
temperatures above 1200°F and the sodium circuit
for a period of 561 hr at temperatures above 600°F.

and the reactor pressure vessel. The second year
was devoted primarily to determining compatible
structural materials and fused fluoride compositions
and to investigating the engineering and fabrication
problems involved in handling fused fluorides at
temperatures between the melting temperature,
~950°F, and the proposedreactor operating temper-

ature of 1500°F.

Development of pumps, heat exchangers, valves,
pressure-sensing instruments, cold traps, and
other components began in late 1951 and continued
to the summer of 1954, culminating with the
delivery of pumps and other components to the
experimental reactor facility. Many of the tech-
niques developed were extrapolations from data
already available from the extensive experience in
the temperature range of 800to 1000°F with sodium
and sodium-potassium alloy at Argonne National
Laboratory, Knolls Atomic Power
and Mine Safety Appliances Co.

Had not this
experience been available, the development period
would certainly have been much longer.

Design of the reactor, development of pumps,
valves, heat exchangers, and other components, and
containment of sodium and molten salt at 1500°F
presented new and perhaps fascinating problems.
Equally challenging were the problems concerning

of the technology of these developments has been
reported.”’=9 We wish also to acknowledge the
important contributions to the technology by
hundreds of engineers and scientists, and regret
that it is impossible to give them individual
recognition.

Although some of the avenues investigated in
developing components were not fruitful, many of
the solutions used in the ARE have become
accepted practice. Among these are the following:
1. use of fire-resistant insulation,

2. use of all-welded construction,

3. standardization of specifications for quality
and inspection of reactor and heat transfer
circuit materials,

4. standardization of welding procedures,

5. standardization of inspection specifications
for assembled components as to fabrication and
leak-tightness,

6. development of high-temperature instrumentation
to include pressure, temperature, flow, and
liquid level measurement,

7. development of the high-temperature sump-type
centrifugal pump — now in routine use in the
laboratory.

Completely adequate designs were not available
for valve seats, bearings in sodium or salt, pump
operable against the liquid, or pumps
operating in circuits with more than one free
surface. Mechanical valves were used in the high-
temperature reactor circuits, but because of their
dubious qualities provisions were made for freeze
valves and frangible diaphragms. Overhung shafts
were used in the pumps to avoid bearings and
seals in the liquid, and the pump tank (or sump)
was enlarged sufficiently to become the expansion
tank of the system, thereby preventing multiple
free liquid surfaces.

During pump development a number of pumps for
sodium were operated successfully with frozen
sodium shaft seals. On the other hand, frozen or
packed seals for fluorides invariably resulted in

stress-free structures, use of seamless tubing and
pipe, and adherence to carefully defined welding
and inspection techniques. All material is 100%
dye-checked, is ultrasonically and radiographically
inspected for defects before use, and is rejected
when there are any observable defects. Materials,

minimize errors in selection; analyses are per-
formed to avoid mislabeling; and all critical welds
are dye-checked and radiographed before ac-
ceptance. With these controls, leaks are rare,
unless the part involved has been severely over-

rod, are carefully

stressed.
FORCED-CIRCULATION TEST LOOPS

Much of the technology and component develop-
ment was accomplished in forced-circulation loops.
These loops, which were also used to determine
corrosion rates,® were of two types. Figure 3
shows a typical sodium test loop which uses an
electromagnetic pump. Figure 4 shows a salt test
loop which employs a down-flow centrifugal sump
pump capable of 1600°F operation. This pump has
been improved since its development in 1951 and is
still used routinely in the laboratory. It provided
some basic ideas for reactor pumps subsequently
developed. It was partly on the basis of corrosion
data obtained from such loops that Inconel and a
fuel salt composition3:¢ were chosen for the
reactor. These loops established that use of a
single alloy in a high-temperature system would
minimize corrosion and mass transfer.® Inconel
was chosen for both the sodium and the fuel
circuits, although type 316 stainless steel is more
resistant to attack by sodium, in order to avoid
duplex-material construction for reactor fuel tubes
(see Fig. 5). (Mass transfer in sodium-Inconel
systems is considerably higher than in sodium-—
stainless steel systems, but was not expected to
be excessive in the periods of operation anticipated
for the reactor experiment.)

Screening tests were conducted with hundreds

rise observed was small, local temperature
transients of 200 to 300°F were observed.

BeO-Sodium Compatibility

Specimens of BeO were suspended in sodium
and examined for attack. Little or no beryllium
was found in the sodium, but porosity of the BeO
was clearly evident, since the specimens exuded
sodium for long periods after they were removed.
Visually, the BeO showed no damage of conse-
quence at any temperature of interest in the reactor.

REACTOR CORE!

In the original concept the reactor core provided
sixty-six 1Y-in. tubes in parallel vertically through
holes in hexagonal beryllium oxide bricks and
seventy-nine Yin. tubes in the outer reflector
section of the core. When the shift was made to a
circulating fused salt fuel, the higher viscosity and
reduced over-all flow rate required made it essential
to reduce the number of parallel paths through the
reactor in order to maintain Reynolds numbers in
1 Consequently, the 66 tubes
were arranged in six routes, each
comprising a serpentine (see Fig. 5) of 11 tubes
in series connected by U-bends at the top and
bottom. This arrangement introduced the question
of whether the core could be filled without first
being evacuated and also made complete draining

were left unchanged.

A full-size core, Fig. 7, was mocked up
with glass and metal tubing, and its hydraulic
characteristics were studied with water-glycerin
solutions for viscosity effects and with tetra-
bromoethane (manometer fluid) for density and
viscosity effects. It was found that complete
filling of the core could not be accomplished by
pressurization of the fluid from the fill tanks,
because gas became trapped in the multiple
vertical rises of each parallel circuit through the
reactor core; nor was it possible to expel this gas

the tanks into the reactor Once the
circuits filled, the interconnection was
closed by a mechanical valve and the liquid could
not be drained back. (As explained elsewhere,?
the sodium valves did not seal tightly, but this
situation was tolerated.)

There were three fill tanks for sodium and two
for barren salt, all located in a tank pit as shown
in Fig, 8. In addition, a hot-fuel dump tank con-
taining 89 vertical through tubes for convection
cooling with helium in the pit was reserved for
the spent fuel. Each tank was equipped with
external electrical heaters and thermocouples and
was of welded construction. Valved connections

Fuel Enrichment2:4:5

The approximate quantity of U235 needed in the
fused fluoride mixture for the reactor to reach
criticality was known from an earlier, low-temper-
ature critical experiment. Consequently, the first
phase of nuclear operation of the ARE was a high-
temperature critical experiment.2:4 The initial
charge of fused fluorides to the reactor was a
highly purified 50-50 mole % mixture of NaF
and ZrF,. To this a mixture of 33Y mole %
U235F,, 66% mole % NaF was added2:4¢5 in

known increments until criticality, and subse-
quently the desired excess reactivity, was
reached. At the completion of this operation the

reactor fuel was approximately 6.18 mole % U23sk ,,
40.73 mole % ZrF ,, and 53.09 mole % NaF, which
had a melting temperature of 1000°F.

The highly enriched fuel was stored in several
containers under helium, and was batched down to
smaller containers in quantities ranging from 2 to
33 Ib. The smaller containers were connected
successively to the fuel circuit as shown in Fig. 9,
and 23 transfers were made in order to fully enrich

the fuel. A V

Development studies of flanged joints, with or
without oval-ring or other gaskets, revealed that
they were not satisfactory for critical high-temper-
ature service. An oval-ring-gasketed flanged joint,
Fig. 11, was usually successful for a time if the
flanges and bolts were exposed to convection
cooling by air {thus introducing a cooled region in
the piping), but ultimately the bolt tension would
relax sufficiently that if it were not discovered and
tightened a leak would ensue.

In addition each

one was needed to join the pipes.

Leak Detection

All high-temperature piping was jacketed by a
stainless steel annulus system which, in principle,
could be monitored for indications of a leak in the
primary piping. Before these jackets were installed,

the piping was subjected to gas pressurization and
a soap bubble check.

The monitoring principle designed into the
annulus was based on the detection of fluid vapors

surrounding the piping.

Copper wool was placed in strategic spots
throughout the annulus and was withdrawn periodi-
cally and placed in a phenolphthalein solution,
which would turn a characteristic red if an alkali
metal was present. In addition, samples of the
annulus gas were passed through a flame photometer

for more sensitive detection of sodium vapor.

A high-temperature leak check was run on the
fuel system by pressurizing krypton gas into the
fuel piping before fluid was added to the system
and by spectroscopically checking the annulus
helium for traces of krypton.

No positive indication of a leak was detected by
any of these methods, and the systems were
deemed to be leak-free.

Helium in the annulus served to even out temper-
ature differences during the preheating period, and
the annulus wall would have helped to contain
leaking material had a leak occurred.

Preheaters and Insulation!

Piping was preheated electrically. All the

straight runs of high-temperature piping were
surrounded by refractory clamshell heaters con-
taining totally enclosed Nichrome V wire; the
heaters were held in position by external straps.
Groups of nine nonadjacent heaters, each rated at
1 kw, connected in closed delta, constituted a
circuit regulated by a Variac. There were several
hundred circuits, and preheat temperatures were
monitored by Chromel-Alumel thermocouples welded
to the pipe at strategic locations between heaters.
Bends, tees, and odd geometry parts were either
fitted with appropriately shaped tubular heaters or

were wrapped with flexible heaters.

Vessels such as the dump tanks were fitted
with flat strip-type heaters, and the pump tanks
used flat, ceramic heaters containing embedded
Nichrome V wire. The reactor vessel was also
equipped with strip-type heaters to bring its
temperature to 600°F so that the sodium could be
circulated through it to bring the temperature of
the core to 1200°F before the fused-salt circuit
was filled.

Development work with smaller systems had
indicated that a temperature of at least 100°F

observable needed to avoid the
danger of freezing during filling. As soon as

circulation began, both systems became nearly

in a closed duct in which helium was circulated by
a centrifugal blower to transfer heat from the two

temperature level, and no attempt was made to
extract useful power from the system.

Since the fuel had a melting point in excess of
950°F, provision had to be made for preheating the
heat exchangers during filling and low-power
circulation of the fluid fuel. Retractable heat
barrier doors, containing heaters, were located in
the ducts at each face of the heat exchangers, and
heaters were placed around the exterior of the
heat exchanger. When power was to be extracted
from the system, the barrier doors were raised and
helium was circulated through the duct.

The helium-to-water heat exchanger, Fig. 14,
was of conventional design, and the tubes were
fabricated from ASME SA-179 seamless

tubing covered with copper fins.

Sodium Heat Dump System

The sodium circuit, which removed heat from
the BeO moderator-reflector and the core pressure
shell, employed a similar scheme, in which heat
was transferred from the sodium to helium and then
from the helium to water.

The sodium-to-helium heat exchangers, Fig. 15,
each designed for 325 kw, were of all-welded
construction and of the same materials as those
used in the fuel-to-helium heat exchangers. Fifteen
parallel fluid passes having 75 straight lengths
in the helium duct formed the active section of
this exchanger. Two separate ducts, each con-
taining a centrifugal blower, a sodium-to-helium
heat exchanger, and a helium-to-water heat ex-

changer, were used. The sodium heat exchangers

operated in parallel and were connected to the
side of the sodium circulating pumps.
Preheating of the sodium heat exchangers was

event that the mechanical fuel drain valves failed.
During operation only the sodium mechanical
valves leaked, the freeze valves did not have to
be used, and the fuel drain valves were kept
closed except for the initial filling and final
draining operations.

The valve, Fig. 17, was fabricated from Inconel
and was designed with a double bellows seal so
that the pressure on the inner or primary fluid seal
bellows could be balanced with inert gas. The
body was fabricated from a 4 by 2 in. reducing tee,
and the plug and seat were hard-surfaced with
Stellite No. 6. This material was found to cause
fusion bonding of seat and plug when the valve
was closed and held at temperatures above 1200°F.

Interchangeable spring-loaded pneumatic actu-
ators were available for holding the valves in
either normally open or normally closed positions.
The spring force was used to hold the valve stem
in its normal position.

The spare fuel pump was isolated from the fuel
system by frangible valves to ensure thet enriched
fuel would not leak into the spare system. These
isolation devices were made by modifying the
plug and seat geometry of the high-temperature
valves and clamping a 0.013-in. nickel diaphragm
in the valve body to produce a positive seal.
Actuation of the valve stem would rupture the
diaphragm and connect the spare pump to the fuel
system. In the event of the spare pump having to
be put in service, there was sufficient inventory
in the main pump to prime the spare pump and to

pump and isolate it from the fuel system.

SODIUM OXIDE COLD TRAPS

The sodium circuit included two bypass cold
traps for the removal of oxide. Design, based on
KAPL experience with traps in a sodium circuit
operated at a maximum of 1000°F, was completed
before sufficient information on the more stringent

 
requirements for service at 1500°F was available.
The circuit to one cold trap leaked at a thermo-
couple weld, and as a result both traps were
removed from the system. The absence of cold
traps thereafter probably caused the sodium to be
of poor quality; and even though corrosion and
mass transfer might have been thereby accelerated,
it was believed that the short period of power
operation would prevent the consequences from

being serious.

INERT GAS SYSTEMS

The free surfaces of high-temperature sodium and
fused fluorides were blanketed with high-purity
helium. In the case of the fuel pump, where gaseous
fission products also escaped, an off-gas line led
through a snow trap adjacent to the pump to a
charcoal bed and exhausted into a high stack.
Helium was chosen as the blanket gas because it
is chemically inert and is readily available in a
very pure, very dry state. Its lightness is a minor
disadvantage.

Experiments indicated that to hold the sodium
and fluoride quality to the desired levels, helium
with an oxygen content of less than 10 ppm and a

therefore every cylinder was examined, and those

control of cylinders used, rejections were reduced
to about 10%. A distribution system in which the

or tank
truck has been found to be superior to the use of
individual cylinders and to avoid completely the
problem of quality control.

To guard further against possible contamination
of reactor fluids, the helium gas lines were equipped
with scrubbers containing sodium-potassium alloy
at room temperature. While these devices were
very effective in removing oxygen and water, they
introduced the danger of transported NaK vapor
and liquid and subsequent fouling of downstream
gas lines. Such fouling was not encountered in

the reactor experiment, however.
ZrF, TRAPS

The fuel system cold trap, more commonly called
a ‘‘snow’’ trap, is shown in Fig. 18; it was
designed in order to eliminate the moderately

serious problem associated with ZrF, vapors
escaping from the free surface of the fused fluoride
in the fuel pump sump. Since ZrF, has no liquid

phase, it will condense on

surfaces as a solid, which does not drain back
into the circulating system. Instead, it builds up
on the cold surface to the extent that it may
ultimately cause fouling. Fortunately, the material
is flocculent and powdery and, although underneath
layers slowly form well-developed crystals, does
not foul moving parts readily.

Pump development work pointed up the necessity
of maintaining the line between the pump tank
and the snow trap at a temperature of approxi-
mately 1300°F to prevent condensation of ZrF
ahead of the trap. The temperature was maintained
by direct resistance heating of the interconnecting
tube and by additional heat applied to the inlet
end of the trap. The remainder of the trap was
allowed to lose heat to its surroundings. The
baffled path was perhaps 95% effective, but some
condensate was found beyond it. At the low power
level of this reactor operation, such carry-through
was not significant, but significantly higher power
would have required higher gas flow rates and a
better snow trap to remove beta heat in the off-
gases and to prevent fouling of downstream piping
and fittings.

PUMPS

Each reactor circuit required a pump and a spare.

pumps are given below:

was built and tested. Since electromagnetic pumps
could not be used for fused salt because of its
fow electrical conductivity and since a single

modifications would solve both flow problems,

development of the electromagnetic pump was not
carried forward.

Space limitations in the heat exchanger pit of
the reactor test facility appeared to indicate that
horizontal-shaft pumps would be preferable. Such
pumps required cantilevered shafts and impellers
and a means of sealing the liquid in the pump. In
addition, since the fuel pump was to handle radio-
active liquid containing fission products, the seal
had to be reliable at all times and to leak only in
an absolutely controlled fashion.

A canned-motor type of pump, which would
appear to have been the most desirable, was not
available at the time for the required operating
temperatures.

Packed Seals

The hydraulic problems of impeller and volute
design were solved by straightforward adaptations
of conventional practice, but the problem of sealing
liquids around horizontal shafts was more compli-
cated,  Packings, labyrinths, high-viscosity ma-
terials, and frozen pumped fluid seals were con-
sidered, and many versions were tried. All
resulted in shaft seizure or periodic galling and

the outer end of the gland.

Rotary Gas-to-Lubricant Seals

Prior to the work on packed seals, a 7-gpm down=
flow centrifugal pump for laboratory use, Fig. 22,
had been developed and was found to be very
satisfactory at temperatures up to 1600°F. Hence,
concurrently with the packed-seal investigations,
larger versions of the gas seal were being tried.

In this development, packings of graphite
impregnated asbestos and Teflon were fried, but

leakage rates of gases were too hich for the

packings to be used with radioactive liquids.
Face-type seals offered the most promise, but
long-term wear-resistant materials were required,
and there were important questions concerning the
kind and amount of lubrication to use.

Silver-impregnated graphite running against case-
hardened cold-rolled steel gave the best results.
It was found that if the surfaces of both members
were optically flat and lubricated and if the mass
and inertia of the movable parts were sufficient
for relative positioning of the parts to be insensi-
tive to vibration, oil leakage could be reduced
consistently to less than 5 cc/day and frequently
to less than 2 cc/day, and gas leakage to less
than 15 cc/day.

Centrifugal Sump Pumps

Use of a rotary gas seal required a vertical-
shaft sump-type pump in which the high-temperature
liquid could be gas-blanketed and the liquid level
carefully controlled. A centrifugal-type pump with
an overhung shaft was selected to avoid close-
running in the pumped
liquid.

The next problem involved a solution to degassing
requirements. In the reactor fuel system there were
two degassing problems; in the sodium system
there was one. Both systems had to be purged of
trapped helium gas at startup, and during power
operation it was desirable to remove fission gases,

surfaces and bearings

particularly xenon, from the circulating fuel.

The sump-type pump operated essentially in a
pot of the fluid to be pumped. Early designs
recommended geometric displacement of the tank
and pump inlets; this led to ingassing due fo
turbulence in the tank. In the pump configuration
finally evolved, liquid in the pump tank returned
to the pump inlet only in a laminar fashion and
without vortexing, and the tank and pump inlets
were in axial alignment at the bottom of the tank.
Sufficient clearance was allowed between the
pump shaft and its housing for 5 to 10% of the
pumped liquid fo continually bypass the main fluid
circuit by flowing up the shaft and back through
the pump tank to the pump inlet. Some continuous
bypass in that flow direction is a requirement of
a sump pump to prevent ingassing, and the resi-
dence time for liquid bypassing the main circuit
through the sump tank must be sufficient to allow
gases to escape. When the bypassing liquid is
spread out thinly on a surface of large area, escape
of entrained gas is aided. On the other hand, xenon

by scrubbing the liquid fuel with helium.>

Thus the processes were somewhat competitive,
and the liquids were never free of gases in solu-
tion. Undissolved gases, on the other hand, were
very rapidly minimized during pump startup to an
equilibrium value too low for detection. As was
pointed out in other reports, +2 fission gases were
certainly liberated to the heat exchanger pit due to
a leak in the off-gas line from the fuel pump. The
degassing means were proved to be effective, since
the gases could have come from only the free
liquid surface in the fuel pump. Postrun esti-

fission gases were liberated continually by this
technique.

As shown in Fig. 23, each pump tank was equipped
with sloped troughs to conduct the bypassing
liquid to the walls of the tank, where it joined
smoothly with the main body of liquid in the tank.
Despite bypass flows as high as 8 gpm, the liquid
in the tanks appeared to be quiescent, which
simplified level indication problems in the tanks,

expansion tanks of the liquid circuits and except
for the difference in volute size because of the
different pumping rates required for the sodium
and the fused fluorides, the pumps and their
auxiliaries were of similar design and many parts
were interchangeable. The basic design features
of this pump have been described previously; '!
however, this discussion merits repetition of the
more important aspects.

Operation of a high-temperature sump-type cen-
trifugal pump was assured by separating high-
temperature components such as the pump tank,
impeller, impeller housing, and shaft extremity
from the bearings, seals, lubricant, and drive motor
by appropriate thermal barriers so that the latter
parts could be operated nearly isothermally at
temperatures below 200°F,

The structural connections also provided for
continuous alignment of the rotary and stationary
parts and for maintenance of running clearances
to avoid binding over a temperature range of
1500°F. The parts were carefully stress-relieved,
and preheating was applied as symmetrically as
possible to minimize asymmetries in temperature
distribution which would have distorted the align-
ment of the parts.

In the ARE, shielding of the lubricant and pump
elastomeric seals was judged to be unnecessary
since the total dose would not exceed 108 r, at
which dose the viscosity of petroleum lubricants
would have increased approximately 10% due to
decomposition and buna-N elastomers would not
have taken a permanent set. (Neoprene is less
resistant to radiation damage than buna N.)

Bearings, Shaft, and Seals. -— The bearings,
shaft, and pump seals were supported in a type
316 stainless steel housing flanged at the bottom
for bolting to the pump body assembly, which in
turn was bolted to the top of the pump tank with
an oval-ring gasket for precision alignment, The
flange and housing enclosed a hollow torus (see
Fig. 23), through which water was circulated as
a primary thermal barrier.

The bearings (Fig. 23) were conventional ground
ball bearings. A pair of angular contact ball
bearings mounted face to face at the upper end of
the shaft supported it and accepted the thrust and
provided for some thermal distortion in the bearing
housing, The bottom bearing was a single radial
deep-grooved ball bearing, providing axial align-

ment of the shaft without axial restraint. These
bearings were spray-lubricated by a petroleum-
base mineral oil of approximately 39 SSU viscosity
at 170°F, which was diverted from the main stream
of lubricant,

The shaft, which carried external sheaves for
the belt drive, was Inconel, It was hollow to the
elevation of the lower seal and had an upper
opening to receive the main lubricant stream to
cool it and a lower opening just above the primary
rotary pump seal and just below the lower bearing
to deliver the lubricant to the seal cavity. The
seal cavity was run partially filled with lubricant,
which was returned by gravity to the lubricant
circuit sump. A breather line from the lubricant
sump opening into the bearing housing at a level
below the upper bearing supplied the gas entrained
by the oil turbulence. This maintained the pres-
sure on the lower seal at oil sump pressure.

The lubricant flowed at 3) gpm and removed
about 4 kw of heat (when pumping 1500°F liquid),
which was dumped to water in an external lubri-
cant cooler. Operating temperature of the bearing
housing and associated parts averaged about 170°F,

The lower or primary pump seal, Fig. 24, con-
sisted of a case-hardened cold-rolled steel,
optically flat (<3 helium light interference bands)
runner fixed on the shaft, and a stationary, tool-
steel, equally flat runner brazed to a formed
bellows sealed with a copper gasket and bolted to
the bearing house near the bottom of the seal
cavity.

1} g-in.-thick annular floating ring of silver-

These surfaces were separated by an

impregnated graphite with % -in. wearing lands on
each side, also optically flat. Exposed areas of
the seal parts were equalized for pressure balance.
Pressure across the seal was held at 1 £ 0.5 psi
positive on the oil side to minimize oil and gas
transport across the oil films between the optically
flat surfaces. Laboratory tests showed that oil
leakage of less than 5 cc/day (frequently less
than 2 cc/day) and gas leakage of less than
15 cc/day were usual with carefully made seals
of this type. Oil leaked to a catch basin in the
bearing housing, which was continually gravity-
drained.

A secondary seal (see Fig. 23), consisting of a
wearing ring of bearing bronze mounted on a brass
bellows and of a case-hardened steel runner fixed
to the shaft, was provided at the upper end of the
shaft just above the upper bearings. Since oil
leakage from this seal was accessible for disposal,

Impeller and Impeller Housing, — Figure 23
shows the impeller and impeller housing for the

fuel pump, and Fig. 25 shows the corresponding
parts for the sodium pump. Volutes and impellers
were designed according to conventional practice.

After many futile attempts to obtain satisfactory
defect-free castings, the volutes and impellers were
all made as weldments, heat-treated, and machined.
Since this method of fabrication of impellers of
this small size, 8 in. in diameter, is unusual,
the fabrication steps are illustrated in Figs. 26
through 29.

being provided around the inlet hub to reduce

internal pump leakages to acceptable values.
Clearance in the shaft labyrinth annulus was
established at about 0.060 in. radially, which

permitted priming of the pump and establishment
of the degassing bypass flow, without which the
pump would ingas. Other clearances around the
impeller permitted a %.-in, axial dislocation of
the impeller and housing; the axial dislocation
resulted from a thermal expansion differential

occurring during preheating.

Fig. 26. Rough-Machined Parts of Inconel Impeller,

The upper portion of the impeller housing was
attached to the pump body assembly (see Fig. 23)
and was sealed to the lower portion of the impeller
housing by a radial sealing metal O-ring carried
by the upper impeller housing.

Pump Tanks. — The pump tanks were of two
types but performed essentially the same functions.
Each tank had a central inlet with antiswirl vanes
at the bottom and a vertical discharge outlet at
one side.

Each tank cover plate (see Figs. 23 and 25) was
the support member for the pump parts, and carried
thermal shields on the under side, the lower
portion of the impeller housing, and liquid level
sensing devices. Thus if the cover plate became
distorted, all critical pump parts moved together
so as to maintain alignment. A movable dumbbell-
shaped section of pipe having ball and socket
type of surfaces at one end and ball and cylinder
at the other end connected the volute discharge to
the tank outlet. The cover plate was sealed to

the pump tank with a replaceable weld and was

held by heavy C-type bolted clamps. The tank had
four welded-on lugs around its periphery for
supporting the entire assembly. (Each pump tank
was an anchor point for the prestressed piping
attached to it.)

The service requirements of the pump tanks
differed. Each was the expansion tank of its
system to eliminate problems of multiple dynamic
free surfaces. Each was designed to accept the
total fluid expansion expected during reactor
operation and was sized so that the liquid level
would always be above the pump inlet and below
the thermal shields carried by the cover plate.
Table 1 gives a comparison of volumetric data for
the pump tanks. Each pump tank was provided
with several spark-plug-type probes and a float-
type liquid level indicator. These are described
later.

Each system was filled to the normal operating
level (which was higher than the minimum prime
level) and then degassed. The liquid temperature
was then reduced to the minimum expected and the

level trimmed to the minimum acceptable pumping
level, 1 in. above the pump inlet bell. Thereafter,
if liquid temperature increased, the level could
not exceed the permissible maximum unless reactor
design operating temperatures were exceeded.
(Little danger could ensue if these temperatures
were exceeded, insofar as the pumps were con-
cerned, unless the transient should be sufficient
for the pump tank to be flooded and thus endanger

30

the pump seals and off-gas lines.) If the pump
should lose prime after initial trimming of liquid,
it could be reprimed by increasing the system
temperature to expand the fluid, or by adding liquid
temporarily. Reactor operation did not require
either technique.

A greater volumetric expansion of fuel than of
sodium was expected; consequently the fuel pump
expansion tank was 32 in. in diameter and the

criterion was that the parasitic volume in the fuel

PUMP AUXILIARIES

The principal pump auxiliaries are the drive and
the lubrication system.

Pump Drives

All pumps were driven by vertically mounted
15-hp d-c motors to obtain variable speeds. For
flexibility each motor drove its pump through
V-belts. The motors were an air-cooled type with
class B windings to withstand ambient tempera-
tures of 125°F, Continuity of pump motor opera-
tion was assured by storage batteries in paraliel
with a normally operating motor-generator set.

Because of possible failure of the fuel pump
V-belts due to radiation damage, several belts
were irradiated to doses of 10° r and tested on
pumps in the laboratory without failure. As a
possible substitute, chain drives were tried ex-
perimentally but were abandoned when the driving
and driven sprockets were badly damaged due to
the vertical positioning of the shafts,

Lubrication Systems

Each pump was provided with a hermetically
sealed forced-circulation lubrication system con-
sisting of a gravity return from the lower pump
seal cavity, an oil reservoir, two parallel-connected
canned-rotor pumps, a filter, a water-cooled heat
exchanger, a thermostatically controlled valved
bypass line around the heat exchanger, and a line
leading back to the pump. These systems operated
without difficulty.

HIGH-TEMPERATURE INSTRUMENTATION

High-temperature instrumentation was required
in the ARE for record, alarm, and control purposes.
Sensing elements inserted in or attached to high-
temperature system components provided signals
for the measurement of temperature, pressure,
flow, and liquid level. Low-temperature and most
inert-gas instrumentation was essentially con-
ventional and is not discussed further, Controls
and nuclear instrumentation are discussed else-

where, +2

Temperature Measurement

The ARE included about 800 (0.032-in. wire)

Chromel-Alumel thermocouples. Each thermocouple

34

was crimped in an Inconel sleeve and Heliarc-
welded to the piping or other parts. The signals
from these thermocouples were indicated on 27
strip-chart recorders and multipoint temperature
indicators, A few thermocouples gave erroneous
signals due to inadequate thermal or electrical
insulation, and by the end of the experiment about
5% of the thermocouple circuits, randomly located,
were open (i.e., failed).

Previous experimentation indicated that a pair
of thermocouple leads could be welded to the
appropriate part separately, be twisted together
and welded as a whole, or inserted in the flowing
stream in a well. In welded arrangements it was
essential to weld the leads in such a way that
neither alloy of the couple penetrated the parent
metal of the part to which it was attached.

The above methods provided response in the
millisecond range which was adequate for the
ARE and most high-temperature experimentation,

Pressure Measurement

Three high-temperature pressure transmitters
were used for reactor liquids, two for fluoride as
it entered the reactor and one for sodium as it
left the reactor. Each was a null-balance bellows-
sealed transmitter,'? Fig. 32, which translated
liquid pressure to a balancing gas pressure for
Experiments indicated that the
transmitters had an accuracy of 2%, and there

were only minor difficulties experienced with zero
shifting. No difficulties were encountered in the
reactor experiment,

In development work it had also been found
possible to measure pressures from high-temperature
gas regions directly with Bourdon-type instru-
ments, and these were used extensively.

Flow Measurement

Flow in the fluoride circuit was measured by a
high-temperature rotameter, and flow in the sodium
circuit was measured by two electromagnetic flow-
meters of standard design. The high-temperature
rotameter, Fig. 33, had a float which could move
vertically in response to fluid flow rate within a
tapered barrel inserted in the piping. The float
was attached to one end of a vertical Inconel rod,
and the other end carried a tapered iron core
chrome-plated to resist corrosion. The rod and

at 1300°F, was placed around the pipe at the
section containing the tapered portion of the iron

variation in inductance of the coil circuit as the
iron core and rod changed position due to motion
of the attached float.

COMPONENT INSTALLATION

The facility for the reactor experiment provided
three concrete-walled pits, one for the reactor,
one for the fill and drain tanks, and the third, and
largest, for the bulk of the high-temperature plumb-
ing, pumps, heat transfer equipment, and essential
process auxiliaries. The pits were very crowded,
and accessibility, needed for installation or for
corrective measures during installation and shake-
down, was very limited,

The amount of U?3% available necessitated re-
duction of the fuel volume external to the core,
and to gccomplish this one-half the heat-dump equip-
ment planned for the fuel circuit was eliminated.

The pits were closed at the top with concrete
shield blocks during nuclear operation, so that
during this phase of the experiment all the equip-

could be operated only remotely and as indicated
by the instrumentation provided.

SUMMARY

In summary it is noted that

1. the reactor circuits were at temperatures above
1200°F for 609 hr, 221 of which comprised the
nuclear experiment;

2. most of the reactor circuit components performed
their assigned functions adequately;

3. the reliability of all-welded high-temperature
liquid circuits was proved;

4, leaks did not occur in the liquid circuits during
reactor nuclear operation;

5. the only failures of major significance were
loss of leak-tightness in the fuel off-gas system
and loss during prenuclear operations of cold
traps in the sodium circuits;

6. most of the individual high-temperature com-
ponents of this system could probably have
operated successfully many hours beyond the
termination of the experiment;

7. the effect on continuity of nuclear operability
imposed by the lack of drainability of the
reactor core could not be assessed since no
situation occurred which demanded draining;

8. the leakage of fission-product gases to the
cells complicated gas and radiation control
problems but did not prevent successful opera-
tion of the reactor nor orderly termination of
the experiment,

The ARE and related engineering development
tests have shown that it is feasible to provide
the necessary equipment for the reliable removal
of heat power generated by nuclear fission in a
forced-circulation fused fluoride fuel and to transfer
this power by means of molten alkali metals and
the fused fluorides at temperatures as high as

1580°F.
