ABSTRACT

A critical evaluation has been made of the available
mechanical property data for Nb~, Mo-, Ta-, and W-base
alloys. It was found that insufficient data are available
to allow the design and construction of complex engineering
gystems involving these materials. A general evaluation
of the potential service temperatures for Nb-, Mo~-, Ta-,
and W-base alloys was made on the basis that conventional
alloys have been used up to two thirds of their absolute
melting point. Strengthening mechanisms that have been
uged to achieve high operating temperatures for conventional
alloys and that could be applied to refractory alloys are
discussed.

A review of the literature on the effects of irradi-~
ation on the mechanical properties of niobium, molybdenum,
tantalum, and tungsten has been made. It has been found
that the existing data on this topic are rather scant.

The data in general show that the ductility of molybdenum,
tantalum, and tungsten is reduced after irradiation at ambient
temperatures, The yield and ultimate strengths are increased
slightly by irradiation. High~temperature tube-burst tests
show that the rupture life of the Wb—1% Zr alloy is not

drastically influenced by irradiation.
INTRODUCTION

Conventional high-temperature alloys, such ag the stainless steels
and nickel-base alloys, have constantly been improved. These materials
have and will continue to be invaluable structural materials in the nu-
clear field. However, proposed future nuclear cystems require materials
that will operate gatisfactorily at temperatures in excess of the melting
points of the nickel- and iron-base alloys. A scan of the periodic chart,
melting points of the elements, and availability and subsequent costs
reveals only four candidate materials: niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, and
tungsten. In consldering the potential of these metals and thelr alloys,
the physical property data in Table 1 are useful. The data on nickel and
iron are tabulated for comparison. The values for one half and two thirds
of the absolute melting point are significant because they indicate, re-
spectively, the temperature for which creep begins to be a problem and the
maximum service temperature to which engineering alloys are commonly
subjected. *

The values of the microscopic thermal neutron absorption cross
section for these metals are of interest for nuclear applications. With
other parameters remaining constant, the use of niobium or molybdenum as
a fuel element cladding material would result in better neutron economy
than would the use of tantalum or tungsten.

In considering a material for engineering application, it is nec-
esgary that the requirements of the particular application be carefully
evaluated and contrasted with the properties of the material. Consider
in particular the problem of choosing the structural and fuel cladding
materials for a nuclear reactor using a ligquid-metal heat-transfer medium.
The material must have sufficient strength at the operating temperature,
must be capable of fabrication into the desired shapes, and must withstand
the corrosive influences of its enviromnment.

Although the fabricability and corrosion resistance are of the
utmost importance, it is the purpose of this discussion to deal specif-

ically with the mechanical property requirements of these materials. The

specific properties that must be evaluated include: (1) engineering
design daba; (2) data concerning the long-time chemical stability of
the alloy; (3) the ductility between the minimum and maximum service
temperatures; (4) effect of atmosphere on the strength and ductility;
(5) the influence of irradiation; and (6) thermal Tetigue properties.

The components of a reactor system require materials having con-
siderably different properties in these six areas. For example,
materials used for fuel element cladding or radiators must be consider-
ably more ductile than turbine blade or nozzle materials. Likewise,
resistance to damage by irradiation is of importance for core structural
materials but not for radiator materials.

Although considerable information is available on the high-
temperature mechanical properties of Nb-, Mo-, Ta-, and W-base alloys,
no single alloy has been sufficiently evaluated in these six areas to
meke it ready for service in a nuclear system. In this discussion an
attempt will be made to assess the state of affairs relative to these
Tour refractory metals. The available data will be reviewed critically.
Recommendations as to the choice of alloys for service over specific
temperature ranges will be made, Areas in which data are lacking will

be pointed out.

STRENGTHENING MECHANISMS IN HIGH-TEMPERATURE MATERIALS

The following discugsion of strengthening mechanisms is not in-
tended to be a complete "textbook" treatment of the subject, but rather
a means of bringing to the reader's attention the many possibilities
that must be considered. For exemple, when 1% Zr is added to niobium,
it doeg not necessarily follow that the strengthening observed is due
to solid-solution strengthening. The entire chemistry of the metal is
changed and it is quite likely that the major portion of the strength-
ening is due to the formation of zirconium-interstitlal complexes
(clusters or compounds).

Specific data are presented in this discussion only where it
illustrates a particular point. Date on the mechanical behavior of

4

refractory metals will be given in The next section.
Solid-Solution Strengthening

 

Solid~solution strengthening may be defined as the increase in
resistance to deformation of a material brought about by dissolving in
it another element. The introduction of atoms having a diameter dif-
ferent from those of the parent lattice introduces strains. These
distorted regions in the lattice interfere with the motion of disloca-
tion and increase the resistance of the material to deformation. The
amount of strengthening obtained by this mechanism is proportional to
the amount of solute up Lo the solubility limit. The strengthening is
likewise proportional to the size difference in the solute and solvent
atoms. However, this is not an independent factor since the degree of
solubility decreases as the atomic misfit increases. This picture of
strengthening based on a size factor, as was originally proposed by
Mott and Nabarro, 2 is somewhat an oversimplificatlon and recent
workers3?% have shown the valency or electronic effects Lo be important.

Another effect of solid-solution alloying is that of lowering
the stacking fault energy. This causes the dislocations to split into
partials with a faulted region in between. For cross slip to occur,
these partials must be forced together. This effect, however, is
confined to face-centered cubic materials and has been observed in
copper and stainless steels.

Some of the most interesting effects arise from the tendency of
impurity atoms to migrate to dislocations and to grain boundaries. This
tends to anchor the diglocations and to lock the sources. The segrega-
tion of impurities in the grain boundaries is largely responsible for
the large effects that impurity atoms have on the recrystallization
temperature of metals. Vandermeer et al.’ have shown that alloy addi-
tions to high-purity aluminum alter the rate of grain boundary migration

in proporvion to the diffusion rate of the solute in the solvent.

However, recrystallization in the transition metals may be more complex.
Abrahamson® has shown that the effect of alloying elements on the recrys-
tallization temperature of niobium can be correlated with the atom per-
cent solute and the free atom electron configuration of the solute
element. The elements Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, W, Re, and Os lower the recrys-
tallization temperature and Ti, V, Cr, Zr, Mo, Ru, Rh, Pd, Hf, Ta, Ir,
and Pt raise the recrystallization temperature.

7 pointe out that the effect of substitutional alloy

Darken
additions per ge cannot account for the strength realized in materials.
Substitutional alloying may be of more Importance in conjunction with
other strengthening mechanisms. The studies by Darken” of the oxidation
of a silver-aluminum alloy illustrate this point. At the temperatures
studied, aluminum has a high affinity for oxygen whereas sllver oxide is
ungtable. It was felt that at low temperatures the oxygen would diffuse
to the aluminum atoms and in the limiting case the aluminum atoms would
remain stationary. If the aluminum atoms were completely surrounded by
oxygen atoms the oxygen-to-aluminum ratio would be 6. As the aluminum
atoms migrate, the cluster size would increase and the oxygen-to-aluminum
ratio would decrease. Observations by Wriedt® on the oxidation of a
Ag~0.1% Al and a Ag-0.48% Al alloy support the proposed model. The oxygen-
to-aluminum ratio decreased with increasing temperature and increazing
aluminum content. It was also found that when an alloy wag oxidized at
one temperature and subgequently exposed to an oxidizing atmosphere at
a higher temperature the oxygen-to~aluminum ratio did not change. This
indicates the very high stability of the aluminum-oxygen clusters. These
are considerably more effective in strengthening the alloy than would be
the gtrain fields due to the aluminum atoms alone.

The effect that a substitutional alloying addition has on the
strength of a metal would be lost if the solute element were removed;

therefore, the alloy addition must be compatible with the service

enviroment. Two of the processes whereby the solute may be lost are
by evaporation at high temperatures in vacuum and by selective leaching

in a corrosive environment.

Interstitial and Dispersion Strengthening

 

Although the interstitial atoms are smaller and diffuse more
rapidly than substitutional alloying elements, they can effectively alter
the motion of dislocations. They are believed to be responsible for the
ductile~te-brittle transition that is characteristic of body-centered
cubic metals. The interstitial atoms become quite immobile at low
temperatures and prevent the dislocations from moving.

Strain aging is another phenomenon attributed to interstitial
impurity atoms. This process is brought about by interactions between
moving dislocations and mobile interstitial solute atoms. Strain aging
may be manifested in a "return of the yield point” in a tensile
specimen after interrupting a tensile test and aging the specimen or by
strengthening during a continuous tensile test with accompanying reduction
in ductility and discontinuous yielding. The empirical relationghip that

has been determined for the occurrence of discontinuous yielding is

¢ = 10° D 5
where

¢ ig the strain rate, and
I is the diffusion rate of the interstitial responsible Tor the
strain aging.

Thiz describes the condition for which the velocities of moving disloca-
tions and impurity atoms are comparable. Strain aging is a relatively
low-temperature phenomenon. For example, in niobium at strain rates of
1072 to 107% sec”! strain aging due to oxygen and the combined effects
of nitrogen and carbon is oboerved over the temperature range of 200 to

450°C. °

The precipitation of a second phase has been used as a strengthen-
ing mechanism in metals for some time. The general concept of strength-
ening by this mechanism is that the second phase particles introduce
strain fields that interfere with the motion of dislocations. Tn light
of this mechanism, the concept of a critical particle size {or spacing)

was proposed by Orowan. 0

Particles of sizes greater or smaller than
this critical size are relatively ineffective. However, many complica-
tions may arise that make this plcture a gross oversimplification. The
particles formed may or may not produce a strain field; they may or may
not be coherent; they may have various shapes; and they may or may not
deform plastically under stress. In fact, the critical particle gize
concept predicted by Orowan has never been observed. The closest approach
has been the observation of Meikle john and Skodall on the yield strength
of solid mercury containing iron particles. However, a particle size
effect was noted that canceled out the influence of particle spacing and
gave the met result that the yield strength was a function only of the
volume fraction of the precipitate. The silver-aluminum alloys referred
to in the previous section likewise showed only a slight dependence of
strength upon aluminum-oxygen cluster size but exhibited a marked depend~

2

ence upon the volume fraction of the precipitate. Recent transmission

12 on iron-gold alloys and by

electron microscope studies by Hornbogen
leslie et al.’ on iromn~bismuth alloys show that the second-phase par-
ticles can act as coplous sources of dislocations. The cell structure
of dislocations originating from the particle offers more strengthening
than would be predicted by the Orowan concept of strengthening. Another

interesting effect is produced by cold working. Garofalo pretreated

type 316 stainless steel specimens by solution annealing, cold working,
and aging. It was found that the strength was greatly improved by pre-
treatments which resulted in fine randomly dispersed carbide formation.
The resulting dislocation networks were studied and correlated with the
mechanical properties of the steel. The desirable dislocation structure
consisted of tangles that had apparently been trapped by the precipitate
particles and the most undesirable structure was the stabilized cross
grids of dislocations which offered little back force on dislocation
motion.

One particularly important factor concerning the mechanical prop-
erties of refractory metals 1s the influence of substitutional alloying
element on the strength attainable through the formation of a dispersed
phase. The case of the aluminum alloy addition to silver and the forma
tion of aluminum-oxygen clusters has already been discussed. One further
example is the influence of carbon on the properties of niobium. McCoy?
and Cortes and Feild'® have independently shown that carbon additions up
to 0.21% do not result in measurable strengthening nor embrittlement of
niobium. The nicbium-base alloys F-44 (Nb—15% Mo-1% Zr-C) and F-48
(b—15% W—5% Mo—1% Zr—C) are, however, strengthened by carbide dispersions
as illustrated by the data of Chang”? given in Table 2. The formation of
NboC in the latter alloy is due to the zirconium content being 0.6% instead
of the nominal 1%. This illustrates the importance of the precise control
of the zirconium-to-carbon ratio in these alloys. Begides being instru-
mental in the initial formation of a strengthening dispersion, a solid-

solutlon alloying element can affect the solubility of the precipitated

interstitial in the alloy and the diffusion rate of the interstitial
element. Both of these factors increase the high-temperature stability
of the precipitate. The work of Hobson'® on the solubility of oxygen in
the Nb—1% Zr alloy illustrates the marked influence of zirconium content
on the oxygen solubility.

Some important factors and observations relative to dispersions
have been discussed, but nothing has been sald of ways of introducing
dispersions. The two major ways have acquired the names of artificial
and natural. The artificial technique involves the mixing and forming
of two powders by powder-metallurgy techniques. The material is then
hot worked to the desired shapes. The main disadvantage of this tech-
nique is that the dispersed phase ig not fine enough to obtain maximum
strengthening. Some current effort ig directed toward developing tech-
niques for producing fine powders. Du Pont has also announced the com-
mercial availability of TD-~-Nickel, which iz a nickel-base material
dispersion strengthened by 2% thoria.? The dispersed particle is 0.1lp
in dismeter, which Du Pont says is introduced by a "special chemical
process, now patented, of a colloidal nature, to achieve extremely fine,

1

uniform dispersion of hard particles in metals." The natural technique

normally involves internal oxidation; however, nitriding and carburizing
could be utilized equally as well. Zwilsky and Grant?% have used the
internal-oxidation technigue to form Al,05 particles in copper-aluminum
alloys. Stress-rupture properties of the dispersion-gtrengthened alloy
at 850°C are superior to those of pure copper at 450°C. These examples

serve to illustrate the potential of this area of materials strengthening.

THE MECHANTCAL PROPERTIES OF Nb, Mo, Ta, AND W

Although the authors have reviewed in detail the known available
literature on the mechanical properties of these metals, an attempt will
not be made to recapitulate this information in detail in this report.
The length of such a recapitulation coupled with its lack of meaning has
led to this decision. Several factors tend to discount much of the
available data.

(1) The interstitial content of the test material is seldom
specified.

(2) Much of the work has been done on 25-g buttons that have
properties difficult to reproduce in 50-1b ingots.

(3) The condition of the material (e.g., solution annealed,
wrought, etc.) at the time of testing is frequently not specified.
Conditions such as "annealed" are often given which are not very helpful.

(4) The test atmosphere is often not designated. The term
"vacuum" is often used with no further qualifying statements. Whether
the vacuum is 10772 or 107% torr can make considerable differences in the
test results. The question of when the vacuum was measured 1s important.
The vacuum may have been 107% torr at the end of a 100-hr creep test, but
may have been 107° during the first 24 hr of the test.

(5) A large portion of the research effort has been spent in
determining tensile data. For most applications such information is not
even useful as a screening criterion, since completely different deforma-
tion mechanisms can be operative at lower strain rates. The possible pit-

falls of extrapolating data from 0.1 to 10,000 hr need no amplifications.

 

20K. M. Zwilsky and N. J. Grant, Metal Progr., 80: 108 (1961).
The melting point data in Table 1 give some idea of the potential
applications of these four refractory metals. Based on the criterion of
two thirds of the absolute melting point being the maximum service temper-
ature, Nb, Mo, Ta, and W can be used up to 1554, 1648, 1906, and 2183°C,
respectively. This criterion ignores the prospect of dispersion strength-
ening, since the SAP alloys are used at three fourths of their melting
points. It is also possible to raise the useful temperature slightly by
alloying to raise the melting point.

The available mechanical property data on several Nb-, Mo-, Ta-,
and W-base alloys are summarized in Table 3. As is quite evident, stress-
rupture data are nol available on many of the alloys. Values of the
tensile -rupture ductility are not given because all of the alloys listed
have sufficient ductility at elevated temperatures. It 1s the ductility
at temperatures approaching room temperature that is a problem. The
ductile-to-brittle transition temperature Tor many of these alloys is
above room temperature. This is illustrated by the data®l in Fig. 1,
in which the reduction in area is the ductility parameter. It is empha-
sized that the temperature of this transition is not a fixed property of
the material but is raised by increasing the rate of straining or tri-
axiallity of loading and is also affected by composition as governed by
alloy additions and the presence of impurities, as well as by the heat
treatment and fabrication history. Some assessment of the favbricability
of these alloys is also indicated. The strength-to-weight ratio is

included because of its interest for space application of these metals.
Niobium-Base Alloys

Appreciable strengthening of niobium has resulted from alloy
additions of Zr, Y, W, Hf, Ta, and Mo. It is quite difficult to say
what fraction of the strength improvement occurs as a result of solution

strengthening and what is a result of interactions of the alloying element

with interstitial impurities. The F-48 and F-50 alloys have been studied
by Chang. =? Both alloys were found to be age hardensble and the aging was
attributed to carbide precipitation. Studies?? of the Nb—1% Zr alloy have
also shown it to be age hardenable under specific circumstances.

The tensile properties of niobium are improved appreciably by the
addition of vanadium. However, the creep properties are not improved, 2% 25
This illustrates the fact that a tensile test is not a valuable screening
test for engineering materials. The range of values found in the litera-
ture for the tensile strength of pure niobium at 982°C indicates the un-

reliability of much of the mechanical property data on refractory metals.

Molybdenum-Base Alloys

 

Additions of titanium and zirconium appreciably improve the mechan-
ical properties of molybdenum. Although this effect is often attributed
to solution strengthening, it seems more reasonable that the strengthening
is due to clustering or dispersion strengthening caused by substitutional-
interstitial atom interactions. Chang?? has studied the aging response of
the Mo-TZC alloy and has clearly established the precipitation-hardenable
nature of the alloy. Three dispersed phases were identified, consisting
of TiC, Mo,C, and ZrC. The formation of TiC was primarily responsible for
the aging, and ZrC was fell to have little influence on the strength.
Chang suggested that another important role of the titanium was that of
enhancing the high-temperature solubility of carbon. Molybdenum, Mo-TZ,
and Mo—0.5% Ti were found not to be age hardenable.

The Mo~50 wt % Re (35 at. %) alloy has some very unique properties.
Figure 2 compares the ductility of this alloy with that of pure molybde-~

twinning in the molybdenum-rhenium alloy at low temperatures. This alloy
ig also more resistant to oxygen embrittlement than pure molybdenum. In
pure molyodenum the oxide vhase accumulates in the grain boundaries, thus
forming brittle grain boundary layers. The rhenium addition influences
the surface energy of the oxide, and the oxide occurs as globules in the
grains as well as at the boundaries rather than as a continuous grain
boundary layer. The availability and cost of rhenium make the widespread
use of the Mo-50% Re alloy doubtful.

In addition to the composition variable that influences the proper-
ties of molybdenum, fabrication is also an important variable.?? This is
illustrated in Fig. 3. Note the very large differences in room tempera-~
ture ductility depending on whether the final rolling temperature is 1204

or 1648°C. Bignificant strength differences also result.

Tantalum-Base Alloys

 

Pure tantalum is relatively weak at elevated temperatures. Additions
of W, Hf, Nb, and V to tantalum result in significant strengthening. The
influence of relatively low concentrations of oxygen and nitrogen on the
elevated temperature behavior of tantalum has been investigated by
Schmidt et al.?® Additions of 560 ppm O and 225 ppm IN were not effective
strengtheners above 1100°C. However, carbon was an effective strengthener
up to 1200°C. No systematic study has been made of strengthening due to
interstitials when a substitutional alloying element is present.

Chang?? has worked with a complex tantalum-base alloy of the
nominal composition Ta~20% No—10% W~5% V-1% Zr—0.08% C. This alloy was
found to have a recrystallization temperature of 1704°C. Preliminary
studies have shown that severe intergranular cracking occurred when

annealed above 1648°C. Studies are continuing on this alloy.

Tungsten-Base Alloys

 

The data available on tungsten-base alloys are quite limited. The

able data given in Table 3. Since the atomic radii of tungsten and msolyb-
denum are 1.37 and 1.36 A, respectively, since they are in the same valence
group, and since the melting point of molybdenum is congiderably less than
that of tungsten, this is not contrary to expectations. The W—30% Re alloy
has attractive mechanical properties both with respect to strength and
ductility. These benefits are believed to be derived by processes similar
to those described for the molybdenum-rhenium alloy. The availability and
cost of rhenium are factors against this alloy.

An interesting piece of work has been done by Steigerwald et al.30
on the influence of surface conditions on the ductile-to-brittle transil-
tion of tungsten. The primary points of this study are illustrated in
Fig. 4. The transition temperature was increased as the depth of surface
imperfection was increased. Fither surface oxidation or electropolishing
was effective in decreasing the transition temperature. It is of consid-
erable practical importance that the transition temperature of a material

can be increased 204°C by fabrication variables.

INTFRNAL FRICTION STUDIES OF REFRACTORY-METAL SYSTEMS

Internal friction is a very useful tool for studying the behavior
of interstitial atoms in body-centered cubic metals. When the metal 1s
unstressed, each of the three types of tetrahedral sites 1s equally
favorable for interstitial atoms. However, the application of a stress
distorts the lattice and causes certain sites to become more favorable
than others. This ordering of interstitial atoms upon the application
of a stress dissipates energy and results in the material having a high-
damping capacity. The measurement of this damping, which is commonly
called internal friction, gives a measure of the number of interstitial
atoms that are moving. A study of internal friction at various fre-

quencies can also give information about the kinetics of the process.

Since the internal friction is dependent upon the quantity of
interstitial atoms in sclution, measurements of internal friction offer
a very attractive way of following a precipitation process. The prac-
tical aspects of such a technique are illustrated by studies of Dijkstra?
on the precipitation of nitrogen in Fe-Mn, Fe-Cr, Fe-Mo, and Fe-V alloys.
It was found that the presence of the binary substitutional alloy addition
greatly influenced the behavior of nitrogen from that observed in pure
iron. Additional peaks were observed that were attributed to the stress-
induced motion of nitrogen atoms in the vicinity of the alloy atoms.
Studies by Stephenson and McCoy 3? have shown that similar behavior is
obgerved when zirconium is added to aicbium. When either nitrogen or
oxygen is added to a niobium-zirconium alloy, peaks are observed that
are not present in pure niobium. As the interstitial content is increased,
the normal interstitial-niobium interaction peaks are observed. This has
been interpreted to mean that the interstitial atoms are clustered about

the zirconium atoms.

EFFECTS OF IRRADIATION ON REFRACTORY METALS

The proposed use of niobium, molybdenum, tantalum, tungsten, and
alloys of these metals as structural components in nuclear reactors
requires that some knowledge be gained as to the effects of irradiation
upon the properties of these materials. The purpose of the following
section is to critically enalyze the work which has been done to date

concerning this problem.
Niobium

A limited number of tube-burst tests have been run at 982 and
1093 °C to evaluate the properties of the Nb—1% Zr alloy. It was origi-

nally reported thal the rupture life was less in an irradiation field

than out of the reactor. Recent hot-cell examinations have led the

authors to retract: their original conclusion, since all failures occurred

in the brazed joints rather than in the specimens, 4

However, these
results show that the rupture life of niobium is not drastically reduced
by irradiation, since the rupture lives of the in-pile specimens which
failed in the brazed joints were only slightly less than the out~of-pile

control specimens.
Molybdenum

Bruch, McHugh, and Hockenbury?? studied the mechanical properties
of commercially pure molybdenum irradiated in the MIR for an estimated
exposure of 1.9 to 5.9 X 102° thermal nvt. The specimen tempersture was
maintained at 90°C. The material used in this investigation was arc
melted by the Climax Molybdenum Company. Two heats of material were
used having carbon contents of 0.061 and 0.066 wt %. No other analytical
details were given. The material was hot worked to 5/8-in. diam,
annealed at 1100°C in hydrogen, ‘and swaged to 1/2-1in. diam. The impli-
cation is that this last fabrication step was carried out at room
temperature and represents a reduction in area of 36%. The test material
had an average hardness of 264 VPN (99.2 Ry) and an average of
5000 grain/mm®.

The tensile gpecimens were rods having a gage section 1.00 in.
long and 0.182 in. in diameter. The strain rate used in the tensile
tegts was 1.3 X 107% per second.

The results of tensile tests performed in this program are
summarized in Table 4. The unirradiated material was ductile at —20°C
but was completely brittle at —40 and —60°C. The irradiated material
was completely brittle in tests conducted at room temperature and 60°C

but was ductile at 80°C. Hence, the ductile-to-brittle transition

temperature increased from sbout =30 to +70°C, Unirradisted and
irradiated specimens were not tested at comparable temperatures at
which each deformed plastically so that a meaningful comparison of the
strength could be made. Bruch et al.?’ do not meke any comments con-
cerning the relative values of The elongation and reduction in area.
However, 1t seems that an important trend exists. In the unirradiated
gpecimens, the uniform elongation is over one half the value of the
reduction in area. In the irradiated specimens, the elongation is only
one Fifth to one gixth the value of the reduction in area. A possible
explanation of this observation 1s that the irradiation-induced defects
pin the dislocations in the metal so that the stress To cause plastic
deformation is quite high. When this stress 1s exceeded, the dis-
locations break away from thelr pinning defects with such driving force
that the normal processes of work hardening are ineffective. Hence,
failure occurg with very high local deformation and very small uniform
elongation.

Several metallographic specimens were included in the tests of

Bruch et al.3’

—

They were polished and photographed at points marked
with hardness impressions before insertion into the experiment. Photo-
graphs were made of the same Tields after irradiation without further
polishing. It was concluded that no visible metallographic changes
occurred.

The results of hardness tests performed before and after irradi-
ation are given in Table 5. The hardness increased by approximately
35 BHN as a result of the irradiation. In the last paragraph of their
paper, the authors inserted some additional data concerning irradiation
hardening. Few experimental details are given. Specimens were irradi-
ated at 400°C for an estimated 3 xX 102° thermal nvt (2 X 10%° fast nv)
and found to increase in hardness from 169 to 216 BHN (converted from
Ry values). These results indicate that the defects are introduced by
the irradiation at a rate greater than they can be annealed out at
400°C,

Mokin end (illies?® investigated the effects of neutron irradi-
ation on the mechanical properties of molybdenum. The test material
was obtained from the Johnson, Matthey and Company, ILtd., in the form
of 0.040-1in.~diam wire. A complete spectrographic analysis of the
material was glven, buf no mention was made of interstitial impurities.
The wires were given a stress-relief anneal at 1030°C for 30 min. The
specimens were irradiated for six months in a Windscale pile at approxi-
mately 100°C. The flux was 6 X 10% thermal nv and the integrated
thermal flux was 5 xX 10 nvt. The ratio of fast to thermal neutrons
was estimated to be unity. Tensile tests were run on a HounsTield
Tensometer at a strain rate of 8.2 X 1072 per second. The ductile-to-
brittle transition temperature was determined by bend tests on the
0.040-1n. -diam wires. Specimens were defined as ductile when they could
be bent 90° around a pin of G-mm diam without fracture. The strain rate
in the bend tests was designated as "slow." Bight specimens were used
to determine each transition temperature to a reported accuracy of *2°C.

The results of postirradiation tensile tests cover the temperature
range of 20 to 200°C are given in Table 6. Four specimens were tested
at each condition. The yield stress wag increased by irradiation over
the entire range of test temperatures, the effect becoming more pro-
nounced with increasing tempersture. The ultimate strength changed in
a similar manner. Yield points were obgerved in the irradiated and
unirradiated specimens tested st 20°C. However, the drop in stress
aggocilated with the yield point of the irradiated material was the
graategt and, at 83°C, only the irradiated material showed a yield
point, Neither material exhibited a yield point at the 200°C test
temperature. The elongation at rupture was, in general, decreased
slightly by the irrediation. The 200°C test condition wag an exception
with slightly greater elongation occurring in the irradiated specimen.
However, the elongation of both materials was quite low.

Bend tests showed that the irradiation dose of 5 X 10° nvt
raised the ductile-to-brittle transition temperature from —136 + 1°C
to =73 * 1°C, a rise of about 63°C. Attempts were made to study the
recovery characteristics of the radiation effect by annealing treaf-
ments, but the complexity of the process coupled with the small number
of specimens prevented conclusive results from being obtained. Makin
and Gillies3® explained their results in terms of both impurity atoms
and irradiation-produced defects. It was postulated that the influence
of the defects produced by irradiation was not fully observed until the
test temperature was increased to about 200°C. Since quite large yield
points could be produced by postirradiation annealing at 200°C, it was
concluded that the defects were mobile at this temperature,

Studies of recovery in cold-worked molybdenum in a radiation
field by Kinchin and Thompson?” revealed a recovery stage at 150°C.

From the activation energy of 1.3 ev, the process wag felt to be vacancy
migration. This observation led Makin and Gillies to conclude that
vacancies were the dmportant defects in their specimens.

Makin and Gillies digcuss thelr results in light of those obtained
by Bruch et al.?? The former authors observed the transition tempers-
ture to increase from —136 to —73°C (+63°C) after a dose of 5 xX 10%? nvt.
The latter authors reported an increase from —30 to +70°C (+100°C) after
a dose of 1.9 to 5.9 X 10%° nvt. It was concluded by Makin and Gillies
that the magnitude of the increase in the transition temperature was not
proportional to the neutron dose. This seems a rather dangerous con-
clusion in light of the different metallurgical histories of the test
material, possible chemical differences, use of 0.040-in.~diam wires vs
0.182-in.-diam rods as specimens, and uncertainties in flux measurements.

tr

Another conclusion baged upon thig comparison was that "...it is possible

that the greatest effect is produced in materials possessing initially

tr

the lowest transzition temperature. In light of the uncertainties just
mentioned, this conclusion is not supported by the available data.
Although Makin and Gillies geemed to realize this, this has been passed

on through the literature as a general rule.

discuss the general problem of irradiation damage
in a later paper. In this paper, an attempt was made to assess the
relative effects of irradiation on high-purity copper, nickel, zirconium,
and iron, commercial grade 75A titanium, commerical-purity molybdenum,
and cold-worked and annealed type 347 stainless steel. The data on
molybdenum presented in this paper are the same as presented earlier.
However, some general statements were made which have bearing upon the
properties of molybdenum. Although it is not possible to calculate the
number of vacancy interstitial pairs which exist in a wetal in a radia-
tion field at a given time due to complex annealing and other inter-
actions, reasonable models exist for calculating the total number of
such pairs that have been produced by a given flux. Such calculations
for the metals mentioned above showed that only minor differences
existed In the number of pairs produced in the metals. lence, it was
concluded that the very large differences in the effect of comparable
doses on the properties of these metals were due to factors such as

the annealing of defects or variations among metals in the property

change produced by a given defect.
Tantalum

Franklin et al.>® have run a limited number of postirradiation

tests on tantalum and two tantalum-tungsten alloys to evaluate the
effect of irradiation on the mechanical properties. Besides the lattice
defects normally produced by irradistion, tantalum is =lgo converted to
tungsten by the thermal neutron reaction Tal®l(n,7)Tal8?(-£)W8%. The

intringic effects of the two processes were evaluated by comparing the

1.1

properties of the irradiated specimens with those of control specimens
containing comparable amounts of tungsten. The analysis of the test

material is given in Table 7. Sheet specimens were used which had =a

The yield strength of the irradisted specimens increased nearly three
times over that of the unirradiated tantalum. The properties of the
arc-melted alloys showed that the Increase in strength could not be
seccounted for in terms of the tungsten content since only minor strength
changes resulted from the addition of up to 3 wt 4 W. Hence, the change
in strength was attributed to some mechanism of defect production by
neutrons. Table 8 also illustrates the marked reduction in ductility
which occurred as a result of irradiation. However, the data indicate
that a large portion of the ductility effect can be attributed to the
tungsten content of the specimens.

Tantalum showed a large Increase in hardness after irradiation.
The hardness changed from 103 to 309 KHN after an integrated thermal
doge of 1.8 X 10?% nvt. The hardnesses of the tantalum alloys containing
1.5 and 3.0 wt $ W were 151 and 170 KAN, respectively.

Sutton and leeser? reported the results of a limited number of
room-temperature postirradiation tensile tests on tantalum. No experi-
mental details other then neutron dose were given. The results of these
tests are given in Table 2. Irradiation appears to raise the ultimate
strength and decrease the rupture ductility.

These authors also reported that the hardness of tantalum was
increased 8 points to 57 Ry by @ neutron doze of 1 X 10%Y nvt thermal

and 5 x 10% nvt fast.
Tungsten
The effects of bombardment by 13.7-Mev deuterons on the internal
frietion and Young's modulus of polycrystalline tungsten were studied
by Muss and To wnsend. *Y  Trradiations were carried out at 200% using
the University of Pittsburgh cyclotron, and the effects of integrated

doses of 5 X 10 to § x 10% deuterons s/ em? were studied. Because of

the nature of the bombarding particles, the number of defects produced
by deuterons is approximately 1000 times greater than the number pro-
duced by a comparable dose of neutrons. The test material was
0.0015~in. -diam tungsten wire supplied by the Sylvania Company. The
wire was designated as type NS-50, but no composition was given. The
modulus and internal friction measurements were made using a mechanical
resonance system consisting of the tungsten wire mounted as a cantilever.

Preirradiation internal friction measurements as a function of
temperature showed that a reproducible peak occurred at 140°K. This
pesk was found to occur at higher temperatures as the frequency of
vibration was increased. This is a characteristic of a relaxation
phenomenon and it was postulated that this peak was due to the thermal
activation of dislocations. The data of this study and those of
Chambers and Schultz? were combined to obtain an activation energy for
the process of 0.21 + 0.05 ev,

The effects of integrated dose rate on tungsten were evaluated
at an irradiation temperature of 295°%K. The internal friction decreased

and Young's modulus increased. Both of these effects were found to fit

the model of a dislocation pinning mechaniem that was proposed by

43

Dieckamp and Sosin. The pinning in this case was concluded to be

due to interstitials. This conclusion was based on the work of Kinchin

and romeon

which showed that radiation-induced interstitials begin
to anneal out at 80K whereas vacancies become mobile at 650°K. The
internal friction effect began to saturate at an integrated flux of
sbout 2 Xx 1016 deuterons cm”. The elastic modulus went through an
inflection at approximately the same dose and decreaszed linearly with
increasing dose. This decrease was explained in terms of the bulk
effect of vacancies being frozen into the lattice. This effect amounted
quantitatively to a 0.44% decrease in Young's modulus per atomic percent
vacancies. The amplitude of the internal friction pesk at 140% and
the background internal friction wers found . decrease as a result of
irradiation. This was attributed to dislocation pinning. However,
after irradiation several small peaks appeared in the internal friction
gpectrum that were not satisfactorily explained.

Makin and Gillies®® studied the effects of neutron irradiation
on the mechanical properties of tungsten. The material used in this
investigation was obtained from the Johnson, Matthey and Company, Ltd.
in the form of 0.040-in.~diam wire. A complete spectrographic analysis
of the material was given, but no menticn wag made of interstitial
impurities. The specimens were fully reerystallized by aunealing 30 min
at 1600°C. The specimens were irradiated for six months in a Windscale
pile at approximately 100°C. The flux was 6 X 10% thermal nv and the
total integrated thermal flux was 5 X 10° nvt. The ratio of fast to
thermal neutrons was not known accurately but was estimated to be unity.

Control specimens were annealed at an equivalent temperature and time.

Tensile tests were run on a Hounsfield Tensometer at a strain rate of
8.2 x 107° per second. The ductile-to-brittle transition temperature
was determined by bend tests on the 0.040-in.-diam wires. Specimens
were defined as ductile when they could be bent 90° around a pin of
60-mn diam without fracture. The strain rate was given as "slow."
Eight specimens were used to determine each transition temperature
and the reported accuracy is *2°C.

The results of tensile postirradiation tests at 100 and 200°C
are compared with the results obtained from control specimens in Table 10.
Although no statement is made of the exact number of specimens tested,
the implication is that these are average values. Both the irradiated
and unirradiated specimens were brittle at 100°C. However, the fracture
stress was raised by the irradiation. At 200°C the yield strength was
increased by irradiation but the ultimate strength was unaffected. The
elongation at rupture and reduction in area at 200°C were increased by
irradiation. Smooth stress-strain curves were obtained with no yield
pointe being observed. The ductile-to-brittle transition temperature

was increased from 118 * 2°C to 126 + 2°C by the irradiation.

Sutton and Ieeger®O reported that the room-temperature ultimate
tensile strength of tungsten increases 20 to 25% after irradiation with
5 xX 10° fast neutrons/cm?, The reported date (given in Table 11) do
not seem to support the statement made by Sutton and Ieeger. A411
specimens were tested below the ductile-to-brittle transition tempera-
ture; therefore, all were brittle. No additional experimental details

SUMMARY

The available data on the mechanical behavior of niobium, molyb-
denum, tantalum, and tungsten have been reviewed critically. Several
important conclusions have been reached as a result of thig study — the
most important one being that insufficient engineering data are avallable
for the design of complex systems using refractory metals and structural
materials. It was also found that each of the four metals reviewed has
certain unique properties that mske it desirable for specific application.

Molybdenum and tungsten have low coefficients of thermal expansion
which may more nearly match those of cermets and ceramic components.

These materials also have high moduli of elasticity which are desirsble
38

from a design standpoint. However, both of these materials present
problems with respect to fabricatility. Niobium has a very low modulus
of elasticity — an undesirable feature. Niobium and tantalum are
relatively easy to fabricate and have good ductility. Niobium and
molybdenum have low neutron absorption cross sections, whereas tantalum
and tungsten are an order of magnitude higher.

Because of the complexity of high-temperature nuclear systems,
materials are needed that have a variety of properties. Hence, at this
stage of refractory-metal technology it is important not to limit our
studies to those metals that can be fabricated into tubing or those
metals that can be welded, since there may be applications for which
such materials can be used in different parts of the reactor. Also,
service conditions such as stress, temperature, temperature cycle, and
desired nuclear properties must be known.

In order to expedite the development of the technology necessary
for the use of refractory metals in engineering systems, it is felt that
persons involved in evaluating the mechanical behavior of these metals
should consider the following factors.

1. A lot of deception is being injected into this field by the
production of small melts of alloys and by the evaluation of thes
zlloys by short-time tensile tests. These small melts often are made
under nonreproducible conditions and are fabricated by unknown pro-
cedures, Unless the application is one requiring a short life, the
use of short-time tensile tests for screening purposes can be very
deceiving. Short creep tests of 10 to 100 hr duration are better
screening tests for materials to be used in long-time spplications.

2. More attention needs to be given to deformation mechanisms
in refractory metals. Just as the strength of many superalloys far
exceeds that of pure iron and nickel, so can the properties of refrac-
tory superalloys excel those of the pure refractory metals if one
learns more sbout the deformation mechanisms in refractory metals.
Fabrication procedure and impurity content can be used to an advantage
if understood. Dispersed phases may possibly be found important in

these alloys. It may be found that these dispersions improve the
39

strength by impeding dislocation motion as well as serving as sources
for dislocations in normelly brittle materials. Hence, the production
of ultra-pure alloys by electron-beam melting mey not be the most
practical approach to ductile molybdenum and tungsten.

3. The more promlgsing alloys need to be evaluated with respect
to thelr strength and metallurgical stability over long periods of time.

4, IHxperiments should be carried out to evaluate the behavior
of refractory metals under neutron irradiation at ambient and elevated
temperatures. These studies should be directed toward defining mecha-
nisms responsible for the different mechanical behavior under irradia-
tion and hence would make it possible to design alloys which are not

greatly altered by irradiation.
