SALT AS A MEANS OF RECOVERING URANIUM AND PLUTONIUM

 

 

J. C. Moilen and G. I. Cathers
ABSTRACT

A falling=drop fluorination method was devised for the recovery of
uranium and plutonium from molten fluoride salts. This method, in which
molten-fluoride droplets fall countercurrently through fluorine, has sev~
eral advantages over methods in which fluorine is bubbled through the
molten salt. Among these are: (1) higher removal rates for both uranium
and plutonium, (2) lower rates of corrosion of the containment vessel
(since the molten salt does not contact the wall), (3) the possibility of
continuous operation, and {4) minimal corrosion~-product contamination
of the fluorinated solt. The low corrosion-product content ond longer
fluorinator life are especially attractive from the standpoint of melten-
salt reactor processing, where the fluorinated salt must be recycled to
the reactor and the fluorinator must be very duroble.

Experimental equipment was developed, and small-scale fluorina~
tion experiments were made, using several salt solutions. With the
data obtained from these experiments, we calculated that, by using a
5~ft-long fluerination column at 650°C, 99.9% of the uranium can be
removed from 100~~diam droplets of Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor fuel.
With an 11-ft-long tower at 640°C, 99% of the plutonium con be re-
moved from 100-4~diam droplets of salt.

In similar experiments using salt droplets containing = Pa, no
protactinium was fluorinated, even at temperatures as high as 614°C.

I. INTRODUCTION

In the molten-salt fluoride volatility process and in molten-salt reactor fuel
processing, uranium and/or plutonium are removed from molten fluoride salts by
fluorination. Sparging of a pool of molten salt with fluorine would appear to be the
simplest method, but it results in undesirably high corrosion” of the vessel and a low

4 . . .
rate of plutonium removal.” The latter is caused, in part, by the thermodynamic
necessity, at 600°C, to have at least 69 moles of fluorine in the gas for each mole of
PuF in order to overcome the tendency of the plutonium to remain as nonvolatile

PuF ,- However, a falling-drop fluorinator circumvents both problems. In it, corrosion
is reduced because only small amounts of molten salt contact the fluorinator wall, and
rates of fluorination are high since diffusion distances are short. This is particularly

advantageous for plutonium since the fluorine:plutonium atem ratio is inherently high

in the fluorinator.

A spray-fluorination system for recovering uranium from molten fluoride salt
wos previously studied by other workers. In this method, the molten fluoride mixture
was sproyed downward into a fluorination tower. The moximum uranium removal ob-
tained was about 30%. This low removal is partially attributed to the contact of the
molten droplets with "cold" fluorine {maximum temperature, 200°C), which permitted
them to solidify too soon. Also, the gas flow was concurrent with the salt flow, thus

1

allowing UF, in the gas to sorb on the frozen salt particles. In our studies; the

6
fluoride salt mixture wos pulverized and then droppad into a fluorination tower, where
the particles melted and were contacted with fluorine, flowing upward through the

tower, at 500 to 700°C. This approach resulted in much higher racoveries.
2. EXPERIMENTAL

2.1 Flueride Salts Used

In experiments in which the fluorination of plutonium was studied, the solvent
salt was Naf -Zrf ; (50-50 mole %) containing either .02& or 2.58 mg of plutonium

(os Puf 3

cer g of salt.

Six different compositions were used in experiments involving uranivm:

1. NaF-ZrF “UF, (48.75-48.75-2.5 mole %)

4
2. Nof-Zrf, -UF, (48-48~4 mole %)
3. NaF -2Zrf ,~UF, (45.5-45.5-9 mole %)
4. NaF-ZrF UF , (37.4-56.1-6.5 mole %)
5. NaF-LiF-ZrF ,-UF

6. LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) containing 9.4 mg of uranium per g of salt

(31.7-31.7-31.7-5 mole %)

The salt used in the protactinium experiments consisted of NaF-ZrF, {50-50
mole %) containing about 0.25 mg of 23154 per g of salt.

2.2 Apparatus and Procadure

The main parts of the equipment for the falling~drop fluorination experiments
involving plutonium and protactinium (Fig. 1) were: ao powder feeder, a preheater
section; a 5Z2-in.~leng fluorination section, and a salt receiver. In addition, there
were the necessary gas supplies and regulators, electrical heaters and controls, traps
for fluorine and PuF and glove boxes for plutonium ond protactinium containment.

The equipment used for experiments involving uranium wos essentially the same, except
that glove boxes were not required. Also, in the experiments with uranium, fluorination

sections of different lengths (28, 44, and 56 in.) were used.

The procedure consisted in pulverizing and sizing the fluoride salt, and then
feeding the sized powder through the glass feeder (Fig. 2), by turning a nickel-wire
helix, into the preheater section of the column. (Helium flowing through the powder
feeder protected it from fluorine ond served os a blanket gas for the preheater section
of the column.) The small drops (58 to 210 HW in diameter) of molten salt, obtained
when the sized powders were melted in the preheater section, then fell through the
fluorination section. In some of the experiments with uranium, lorge drops {cbout

3000 u in diameter) were produced directly by means of a high-temperature pipet.

Before the start of each experiment, the column was Flushed, first with helium,
admitted af both the top ond botiom of the column, and then with helium and fluorine
(equal volumetric flow rates) admitted at the top and the bottom of the column, respec
tively. During each experiment, the fluorine and helium flow rotes were also kept

equal.

After passing through the fluorination section, the "depleted ™ salt drops were

frozen and collected in a stainless steel cup located in the bottom of the column. In

almost all of the experiments with uranium=-containing salt, this cup contained a
chilled liquid fluorocarbon to prevent UF, in the gos from sorbing on the frozen
salt. After collection, the frozen droplets were sieved; then, the different size

fractions were sampled for chemical analysis.

2.3 Velocity and Time of Fall of Droplets

The velocity of the droplets must be known in order to calculate the time of
contact in the fluorination tower. The velocity of 137-4L-diom droplets falling
through fluorine ot 00°C was calculated as a function of time, using drag coefficients.
Figure 3 is a plot of these calculated velocities. At 600°C and 1 atm, the falling
droplet reaches its terminal velocity of about 60 cm/sec after falling only 8.7 cm.
Thus, the important velocity for the droplets (except for the 3000-1 droplets, which
do not attain terminal velocity in a short fall) is the terminal velocity. Terminal
velocities for particles of other sizes were easily calculated because, for small drop-
lets, the terminal velocity is nearly proportional to the square of the diameter. Since
most of the fluorination experiments were done at 800 + 50°C, the rate of fall was not
corrected for temperature. In these experiments, the residence time of a smal! drop

in the fluorination tower can be expressed as:

t (sec) = tt ;

c 1.246 x 107d?
where d is the particle diameter in microns, ond L is the length of the fluorination

section in inches.
3. RESULTS

3.1 Sorption of UF, and PuF , on the Surfaces of Frozen Droplets

Since, in our system, the frozen salt was collected in the bottom of the faolling-
drop tower, it was necessary to examine the possibility that uranium and plutonium

hexafluorides were being sorbed on this salt and biasing the experimental results. In

most of the uranium experiments, the droplets were caught in a pool of chilled liquid

fluorocarbon, which prevented direct contact between the frozen salt and the UF, A
significant increase in uranium removal was obtained in these runs, particularly when
the particle diameter was large (Fig. 4); the maximum removal without use of the

fluorocarbon was about 99.5%, whereas the maximum removal with its use was greater

than 29.9%.

In the plutonium work, this procedure was not used because the potential hazard
of contacting fluorine with a fluorocarbon was considered to be too great. If it had
been used, some sorption on the frozen salt undoubtedly would have been prevented.
However, by analogy with the uranium results (Fig. 4), only 1 to 2% of the
volatilized plutonium would have been expected to sorb on the frozen droplets. Since
less than 88% of the plutonium was volatilized in any experiment (Sect. 3.3), surface
sorption would change the amount of plutonium found in o drop by less than 15%. This

is less than the experimental variation.

The data shown in Fig. 4 suggest that, in a large-scale falling-drop fluorination
tower, some method of preventing contact of the gas and the depleted salt would be
desirable. Probably the best solution would be to admit fluorine at the bottom of the
column at a flow rate sufficient to prevent significant amounts of UF, and PuF, from

6
contacting the solidified salt.

3.2 Fluorination of Uranium=Containing Salts

Table 1 shows a few examples of the data obtained in these experiments. In
general, the recoveries increased with decreasing particle diameter and with increasing
temperature, other conditions being the same. The uranium recovery data obtained

with the six salt compositions were correlated by using the following equation:

All the results indicate thet, in a 4-ft~long fluorination column at 650°C, more
than 99.5% of the uranium can be removed from droplets that are less than 200 U4 in

diometer.

3.3 Fluorination of Plutonium~Containing Salts

Toble 3 summarizes the results of seven experiments in which NaF-Zrf,
(50-50 mole %), containing either 0.026 or 2.58 mg of plutonium {added as PuF.)
per g of salt, was fluorinated. The salt may not have been completely molten of
506°C because this temperature is below the liquidus temperature of the salt (510°C).
The data from these experiments are correlated in Fig. 7, which consists of plots of
the fraction of the plutonium removed vs drop diameter. These constant-temperature
plots are linear, and at the higher temperatures, the diameter dependence is low.
Thus, plutonium removal is most efficient of high temperatures where the size of the
droplets is not a critical parameter. The following empirical equation correlates the
plutonium removal date, and can probably be used to predict removals within the

temperature range of these experiments:

Fe (-5.0 + 7.65 x 1072 17d - 0.227 + 236 ,
where
F = plutonium removed, % (fluorinator length, 52 in.),

The plutonium removal in a tower having a length other than 52 in. can be estimated
from the following equation:
F100 = 1 - (1 - £/100) 752 ,
where
F = plutonium removed in 52~in.~long fluorinator (drop diameter and
temperature constant), %,

F’ = plutonium removed in fluorinator of length L', %, and

L' = fluorinator length, in.

3.4 Fluorination of Protactinium~Containing Salts

Two fluorination experiments, at 547 and &14°C, were made using NaF-ZeF ,
{50-30 mole %) containing 231 Pa. Gamma counting was used for analysis of the
protactinium. No detectable amount of protactinium was voletilized in either
experiment. However, the fluorine used throughout this entire investigation contained
obout 10 vol % impurities, including about 1% oxygen. The studies of Stein at
Argonne National Laboratory indicated that, when the oxygen concentration in
fluorine is this high, nonvolatile Pa, OF is formed in preference to the more-

volatile PF.
4. POSSIBLE APPLICATIONS

4.1 Removal of Uranium from Molten=-Salt Breeder Reactor Fuel

One possible application of the falling~drop fluorination scheme is for processing
Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR) fuel. This fuel contains about 1.6 wt % uranium
and must be processed at the rote of about 16 f° /day (p=20 of cm). The total fuel
salt volume will be about 680 Fr and will contain about 6.2 x 10° g of uranium. The
annual increase in uranium due to breeding will be about 7%. For procedures yielding
a 99% removal of uranium in the reprocessing step (assuming that the other 1% is lost),
we calculate that the annual loss of uranium would be about 2.6% of the total charge,

which is more than one-third of the uranium that is produced by the reactor. Thus,
18

processing schemes that do not permit recovery of ot least 99.9% of the uranium would
be considered as economicolly infeasible. Using a falling-drop fluorinator having a
fluorination section that is 5 fi long (to keep the unit relatively compact), we cal~
culated that the maximum diameters of drops from which 99.9% of the uranium could
be removed at temperatures of 600, 650, and 700°C would be 90, 112, and 137 1,

respectively.

Drops of these sizes can be generated using a two-fluid spray nozzle. With
such a nozzle, the Unit Operations Section of the Chemical Technology Division
has succeeded in producing droplets, most of which are 25 to 100 WU in diomster.
Significantly, several thousand volumes of driving gos per volume of molten salt are
required to obtain droplets of this size. Nitrogen has been proposed as the driving
gos since fluorine is too corrosive to the spray nozzle; however, such o quantity of
inert gas in the fluorination tower would dilute the effluent fluorine too much to
allow its recycle. In Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor fuel processing, disposal of the
unreacted fluorine probably would not be prohibitive since, for 509% utilization, this
would amount to only about 7500 Ib/yecr. Another approach might consist in forming
droplets {using a two-fluid spray nozzle}, freezing them in an inert atmosphere, and
feeding the frozen droplets into the top of a fluorination tower. This method would
require a suitable means for remaving decay heat from the frozen droplets to prevent

premature melting.

4.2 Processing of Low~Enrichment Reactor Fuels

At the present time, it appears unlikely that molten—salt volatility methods
will be used for processing reactor fuels that contain plutonium. If such processing
is contemplated, it should be noted that the falling-drop method is the only approach
that has shown promise for the rapid removal of plutonium with low recction-vesse!
corrosion rates. For example, our experimental data indicote that fluorination in an
Vi-fi-high tower will result in the removal of 29% of the plutonium from 100-4-diam
drops af 640°C. This corresponds to a fluorinatien time of about 11sec. In the proc-

essing of salt containing plutonium, the fluorine would probeb!y have to be recycled
19

in order to maintain a high fluorine:PuF, mole ratio in the exit gas from the column

6
(to prevent decomposition of the PuF ,)- Recycling the fluorine would, in turn, require
that the droplets be formed in a separate tower, where the driving gas for the spray
nozzle would not dilute the fluorine in the fluorination tower. The drops would then

be frozen and fed to the top of the fluorination tower.
