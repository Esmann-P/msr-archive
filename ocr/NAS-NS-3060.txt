Foreword

The Subcommittee on Radiochemistry is one of a number of subcommitiees working under the
Committee on Nuclear Science within the National Academy of Sciences—National Research
Council. its members represent government, industrial, and university laboratories in the areas
of nuclear chemistry and analytical chemistry.

The Subcommittee has concerned itself with those area: of nuclear science which involve
the chemist, such as the collection and distribution 0° radiochemical procedures, the
radiochemical purity of reagents, the piace of radiochemnistry in college and university
programs, and radiochemistry in environmental science.

This series of monographs has grown out of the need [or compilations of radiochemical
information, procedures, and techniques. The Subcommittee has endeavored 10 present a series
that will be of maximum use to the working scientist. Each monograph presents pertinent
information required for radiochemical work with an indivifual element or with a specialized
technue,

Experts in the particular radiochemical technique have written the monographs. The
Atomic Energy Commission has sponsored the printing of the series.

The Subcommittee is confident these publications will te useful not only to radiochemists
but sito to research workers in other fields such as physics, b ocliemistry, or medicine who wish
to use radiochemical techniques to solve specific problems.

ITI. DISCOVERY AND OCCURRENCE OF NEPTUNIUM
Neptunium was discovered in 1940 by McMillan and Abelson.!
They bombarded a thin uranium foil with low-energy neutrons
and showed that the 2,3-day activity tha: was formed was an

isotope of element 93 produced by the nu:lear reactions:
300 (ny) 230 a> HN op 23
It was shown in 1941 that the decay product of 23°Np was 22%Ppu.?

2393p is produced in large quantities as the intermediate
in the nuclear reactor production of 23%:u, but because of its

short half-life it is used only as a tra:er.

Wahl and Seaborg® discovered the long-lived isotope 2*7Np

in 1942. It was produced by the nuclear reactions:

23% (n,2n) 237U ep “3iNp

The first weighable quantity of 237Np (45 ug of Np0O2) was

isolated by Magnusson and .aChapelle in 1944." These workers

were the first to measure the specific a:tivity of 237Np.

As a result of these reactions, Np is produced in
relatively large quantities in nuclear rzactors fueled with
natural U. When fuels enriched in 2350 and 23%U are used in

nuclear reactors, the following reactions are increasingly

important.

233u (n,v) %3%U (n,v) 23u Se 23iNp
Since about 1957, the U. S. Atomic Energy Commission has
recovered and purified byproduct Np in its production facilities.
2370p is used as target for the production of 2?%pu, an isotope
in demand for fueling radioisotopic piwer sources. ®

23 (n,Y) 238Np so 23%Pu

The half-life of 2?’Np is very short compared to the age
of the earth. Therefore, it is found only in trace quantities
in U minerals where it is formed continuously by neutron
reactions described previously.® It vas found that the abundance
of 23’Np in a sample of Katanga pitchtlende was 2.16 x 1072 atoms
per atom of 23%), while that of 2?%Pu was 3.10 x 10”? atoms per

atom of 23%.7

IV. [ISOTOPES AND NUCLEAR PROPERTIES OF NEPTUNIUM
The known isotopes and celected ruclear properties of
Np are listed in Table 1. The radioaralytical chemist works
mostly with long-lived *?’Np and short-lived 2*°Np and 23°Np.
The decay schemes of these most important isotopes of Np are

presented in Figure 1.

Thermal neutron cross sections and resonance integrals

for Np isotopes are shown in Table 2.

V. CHEMISTRY OF NEPTUNIUM
A. METALLIC NEPTUNIUM
A.l Preparation
Np metal was first prepared by Fried and Davidson in 1948
by the reduction of SO ug of NpF, with Ba vapor at 1200°C.'!
A similar wethod was used by Westrum and Eyring.'? Reduction
of NpF. by excess Ca metal with iodine as a booster!’ !* was

used to produce multigram quantities of Np metal,

A.2 Physical Properties

Pure Np is a silvery ductile metal with a melting point of
637°C. The metal undergoes three allotropic modifications below
the melting point. The physical properties wre summarized in

Table 3.

Stephens?’ determined the pressure-temperature relationship

for Np. The specific heat (Cp) of Np is high. Tha Dulong and

Petit value of 3R is reached at 140°K and 7.093 cal/(mol-°%) at

27°C.?' The high specific heat can be entirely accounted for by

the very high electronic contributions. No magnetic ordering

in a-Xp occurs down to 1.7°k.%?

A.3 Chemical Properties

Np is a reactive metal. The potential for the couple
Np = Np" + 3e¢” is 1.83 volts. Metallic Np is slowly covered
with a thin oxide layer when exposed to dry air at about 20°C,
and rapid oxidation to NpO: occurs at higher temperatures
especially in moist air. Hydrogen, halogens, phosphorus, and
sulfur react with Np metal at elevated temperatures. Hydrogen

rescts tc form the hydride at relatively low temperatures.

Np forms intermetallic compounds of intermediate solid

solutions with U, Pu, Be, Al, B, Cd, Ir, Pd, and Rh.

Np dissolves readily in HCl at room temperature and H2S0,
at elevated temperature. The behavior of Np toward various

solutions is given in Table 4.

8B. ALLOYS AND INTERMETALLIC COMPOUNDS
Complete phase diagrams are reported for Np-Pu and Np-U.23728

Complete miscibility has been reported betveen y-Np and v-U and
between y-Np and L-Pu. Np is a unique elenient because of its

extremely high solubility in both a-Pu and 8-Pu.

The intermetallic compounds of Np with Al and Be (NpAl,,
NpAls, NpAl,, and NpBe;;) are prepared directly by reducing NpFi
with an excess of metallic Al or Be. The borides (NpB:, NpBu,
NpBe¢, and NpB,;) and the intermetallic compounds NpCde and

NpCd,; are obtained directly from the elcments.?’" 2% Several

compounds with noble metals, such as NpPty and NpPts, have
been prepared by hydrogen reduction of NpO: at 1300°C in the
presence of platinum.’ Also, Erdmann’! used the same method

to prepare several other compounds, Nplry, NpPdi, and NpRhj;.

(.. COMPOUNDS OF NEPTUNIUM

Compounds of Np for the III, IV, V, VI, and VII oxidation
states have been prepared. The solubilities anc compositions
of some of the compounds have not been verified because they
were initially determined with small amounts of Np shortly
after discovery and therefore may be semi-quant.tative. Where
studies have been made with larger amounts of neptunium, i.e.,

oxalates and peroxides, more quantitive data is available.

Numerous Np compounds, such as nitrates, chlorides, and
possibly thiocyanates, are readily soluble in sa>lvating organic
solvents such as diethyl ether, hexone, TBP, ani other acid-

containing solvents saturated with water.

Investigation of compounds containing trivalent neptunium
has been limited because of the instability of Np(1Il) in
aqueous solution in the presence of atmospheric oxygen. Np(III)
is produced under hydmrmgen (on a platinum catalyst), by electro-
chemical reduction and with rongalite, NaHSO;.(H,0-2H,0. Mefod'evs
et al.’? have prepared several Np(I11) compouncis from solution with

protection from oxygen. All the reagent solutions and water were

- 16 -
purged with pure argon. The precipitation and subsequent
operations (centrifugation and washing) were conducted with a
layer of benzene over the solution, The solids were washed with
acetone or ether and dried in a strean of argon. Np(III) oxalate
was prepared, but it was appreciably oxidized in a few hours.

The solid was brown and was in the fom of tetragonal prisms.
Np(III) phenylarsonate is rose-lilac colored with the composition
Np2 (CeHsAsO3) 3°nH20 when well dried; the compound is stable for
a long period at room temperature. Np(III) salicylate and grayish-
lilac Np(IIl) fluoride were also precipitated under controlled
conditions. Two complex double sulfates of Np(III), KsNp(SOs4)s
and NaNp(SO.)2°nH20, were precipitated. In the dry form, these
salts were stable to oxidation during prolonged storage even at

increased temperature.

Only one solid compound of Np(VI1), Co(NHi)e¢NpOs-3H20, has

been reported. ®®

Compounds of Np(IV), (V), and (VI) are shown in Tables 5
and 6. Table S includes compounds produced in aqueous
solution, and Table 6 includes compounis produced by other

methods.

D. NEPTUNIUM IONS IN SOLUTION
D.1. Oxidation States

Neptunium exists in the (III), (IV), (V), (VI), and (VII)
oxidation states in aqueous solutions. The heat of formation,
the entropy of the individual ionic species, and simple methods
of preparation are listed in Table 7. The first four of these
oxidation states exist as hydrated ions in the absence of
complexing agents. Np(VII) is stable only ir. alkaline solutions;

reduction to Np(VI) occurs in acid solutions.

The singly charged, hydrated neptunyl ion, [NpO2 (H20) 1",
is the most probable oxidation state in solution. Because NpO,"
hydrolyzes only at pH >7, disproportionates nly at high acid
concentrations, and forms no polynuclear complexes, it is stable
coupared to the other pentavalent actinides. The standard
potentials and formal electrode potentials in IM HC10, of pairs

of neptunium ions are shown in Table 8.

The formal oxidation potentials for Np couples in various
IM solutions are given in Table 9, with the hydrogen electrode
in the stated medium as the reference. The change in the
potentials in 1.0M HS0., as compared to 1M solutions of HC10.,
HCl, and HNO; indicates strong complex formation of Np? with

sulfate ions.

The current-voltage curves for oxidation-reduction

reactions of Np in aqueous solutions are shown in Figure 2.

0.2. Oxidation-Reduction Reactions

Table 10 lists reagents and conditions necessary to change
oxidation states for Np ions. For cases wiere only one electron
is t-ansferred, e.g., Np’ /Np*® and Np0,*/Np0:2*, the establish-
ment of redox equilibrium is rapid. Redox reactions that involve
forming or rupturing of the neptunium-oxygen bond, e.g.,

Np** /Npo2 * and Np**/Np022t, have a slower reaction rate.

Rate constants (k} and half-conversicn periods of the
redox reactions in IM acid solutions at 25°C are given in

Table 11.

D.3. Disproportionation of Neptunium
Only the Np(V) oxidation state underjoes appreciable

disproportionation. The reaction 2Np02* + an’ - Np** * Np022*
+ 2H20 shows that disproportionation of Np(V) is favored by
high acid concentrations. Because Np** and Np0:2* form more
stable complexes than the NpO, ion, the disproportionation of
Np(V) is promoted by the addition of complexing agents, The
equilibrium constants, K, for various acid solutions are listed

in Table 12 where

The hydrolysis of a metal ion is a special case of complex
formation with OH ion. Hydrolysis consists of the transfer
of a proton from a coordinated water molecule to a water molecule

with K, = [Np (OH) (H;0) 13° [101°

[Np (i120) o]

The most recent and extensive hydrolytic studies of Np
were made by A. I. Moskvin.®? Hydrolys:.s constants, Ky, are
listed in Table 14 for Np(iV), (V), and (VI).* The tondency
for Np ions in dilute acid solutions to undergo hydrolysis
increases with increasing ionic potential (d) where d = Z/r,
Z is the ionic charge, and r is the ionic radius. Thus, the
tendency to undergo hydrolysis increases in the order:

3+ ot

NpOz" <Np02®* <Np02?* <Np®" aNp*®.
Successive hydrolysis reactions in Pu(IV) solutions result
in the formation of colloidal aggregates. The polymer pre-

sumably forms irreversibly with oxygen or hydroxyl bridges.®®

calculated from K; = Ye where Ky is the ionic product of

D.6. Complex Ion Formation

The formation of complex specius by the actinides in
different oxidation states with a variety of ligands offers
potential for separating the actinides from each other and
from other cations. Complex formation and hydrolysis are
competing reactions. The mechanism of complex ion formation
can be represented as successive reactions between water
molecules from the inner sphere of the hydrated cation and

anions, A, e.g.,

Np(H20)¢"" + A” = NpA(H20)7°" + H,0
The ability of an ion to form complexes is dependent on the
magnitude of the ionic potential. The relative tendency of

Np ions to form complexes is usually:

+

Np** >Np®* 5Np023* »Np0.2" SNpO.

Neptunium (III)
Np(III) exists in aqueous solutions as Np(H20)e’*.
The chloride and bromide complexes cf Np(III) have been studied
spectroscopically in concentrated LiCl and LiBr solutions

(see Table 15).

Neptuniwm (IV)

Np(IV), which exists as Np(H20)s"* in aqueous solution, forms
strong complexes with most anions. Analogous to U and Pu, Np(IV)
forms negatively charged chloro and nitrate complexes in concen-
trated HCl and HNO,; these complexes are sorbed on anion ex-
changers. Np(C204)2 is soluble in dilute (NH.)200y solution in-
dicating that the carbonate complexes, which have not been
studied in detail, are more stable than the oxalate complexes.®
Definitive studies of the nature and composition of peroxide
complexes in solution have not been made. A purple-gray Np(1V)
peroxide precipitate is formed by addition of H202to a solution
of Np(1V) in nitric acid.

From the stability constants .isted in Table 15, the
following series of ligands were arranged according to in-

creasing strength of the complexes formed by addition of the

first ligand to Np*':

C10,” <Cl™ <NOj3 <S042~ "W:H,C00"
<F~ <C3041" <OH™ <EDTA*  <DTPA%™ <0X~

Neptuntws: (V)
Np(V), present in aqueous solution as singly charged
neptunyl ion, NpO2 (H20)¢", is au poor complexing agent because
of its large size and low charge. The neptunyl complexes,

which are comparable in stability to Mg?', ca?’, end zn?’

- 37 -
complexes,®’ are much more stable than pentavalent uranium,
plutonium, and americium complexes.

Studies of cationic complexes of Np(V, with U0p2*,
Cr**, Fe’*, Th"'*, and other cations in HC10, solutions have
been made.

From the stability constants listed in Table 15, the
following series of ligands were arranged according to in-
creasing strength of the complexes formed hy the addition of

the first ligand to NpO::

C10, <C1~ <NO3 <AC  <NTA <SOj3? “{IBA~
NTART2™ HCO3™ <TTA™ <CITRY™ C2042" "HAA

<OH™ <DTPA®~ <EDTA‘~

Neptunium (VI)
Np(VI) exists in aqueous solution as NpO,(H:0)¢2’. From
the stability constants listed in Table 15, the following series
of ligands were .rr.iged according to increasing strength of

the complexes formed by the addition of the first ligand to

Np0,2*:

C10," <NO+~ <C1~ <SO,  <CH3CO0~ <F~ <C304"

Neptuniwm(VI'}
Very few studies of NL (VII) complexes have been made.
Sulfate compiexes of the NpO, ** ion in acid solution show that

NpO2'" has a higher tendency towards complex formation with

- 38 -
sulfate ions than the neptunyl Np0, 2” ion. This is reasonable
because the charge of the NpOz" group increases from hexavalent

to heptavalent neptunium.

VI. PREPARATION OF NEPTUNIUM SAMPLES FOR ANALYSIS
A. NEPTUNIUM METAL AND ALLOYS
Neptunium metal dissolves in HCl, other halogen acids, and
sulfamic acid but not in HNOs or concentrated H;SO,. Hot dilute
H2S0, attacks Np slowly. Np is dissolved slowly in hot concen-

trated nitric acid containing fluoride.

Np-Al alloys are soluble in 6 to 10M HNO3 containing "0.05M
Hg (NOs) 2 and “0.02M KF; they are also soluble in HCl and HClO..
An alternative method is to selectively clissolve the Al in a
solution of NaOH-NaNOj; the Np and other actinide elements
are separated by filtration or centrifugation and are soluble in

boiling HNOj3-HF or HCI.

B. NEPTUNIUM COMPOUNDS

NpO2 prepared by ignition of the oxalate at 400 to 600°C is
soluble in hot 10M HNO. When ignition is done at higher tempera-
tures, refluxing in strong nitric acid for a long pericd, even with
the addition of HF, is required. Fusicn with potassium bisulfate
and dissolution of the melt in dilute acid is useful for dissolving
NpC; fired at very high temperatures. DMNp fluorides are readily

soluble in nitric acid solutions containing aluminum or borate ions.

- 39 -
NpO:-Al targets are soluble in hot strong nitric acid solu-

tions containing mercuric and fluoride ions.

C. BIOLOGICAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL SAMPLES

Np in these samples ranges from readily soluble metabolized
neptunium in excreted samples to extrem:1ly refractory fallout
samples. Most procedures for dissolving fallout or other environ-
mental samples involve treatment with HF or a basic fusion step
which renders Np soluble in acids. There has been little
investigation of Np in these types of samples; however, numerous
determinations of plutonium in tissw. bone, feces, urine, vegeta-
tion, soil, and water have been reported and the same methods of
dissolution would probably be applicable for Np; Nielsen and
Beasley'!® have summarized many of these methods. Dissolution
of biological samples and vegetation is generally accomplished by
multiple wet ashing or a combination of wet and dry ashing. In
wet ashing, strong oxidizing agents such as perchloric acid and
nitric acid are used (individually or in combination), or sul-
furic acid and hydrogen peroxide. In some cases the sample is
tused with sodium or potassium carbonate, and the melt is dissolved

in water or dilute acid. !?°
VII. SEPARATION METHODS

A. COPRECIPITATION AND PRECIPITATION

Coprecipitation is the "classic" method for ssparating
tracer quantities in radiochemical analyses. Hecause Np in
aqueous solution is easily converted to Jifferent oxidation
states that exhibit markedly different behavior im coprecipitation,
separation from other elements can be attained. However, ion
exchange, extraction chromatography, and solvent extraction
separation are used almost exclusively because more complete

separation is attained more rapidly.

Precipitation of neptunium oxalate :s regularly used in
large-scale processing of neptunium zs an intermediate to
neptunium oxide. Precipitation of other Np compounds is very

limited.

The coprecipitation behavior of the different oxidation

states of Np is shown in Table 16.

Lanthamon Fluoride. The first separation of a pure Np
compound described by Magnusson and LaChapelle" used LaF,
coprecipitation. Np(1V), Pu(Ill), and Pua(IV) are carried almost
quantitatively by lanthanum fluoride from mineral acids. U decon-
tamination is best from HSO, because of the strong uranyl sulfate
complexes. Np is reduced to the tetravalent state and precipitated

by adding fluoride and lanthanum ions. Insoluble fluorides

including the rare earths and Th also precipitate. Hold-back
carriers are added to decrease the precipitation of Zr and alka-
line earths. The fluoride precipitate is converted either to
acid-soluble sulfates by evaporating unti! fumes of H250, appear,
or to hydroxides by metathesis with alkali hydroxide. Oxidation
at room temperature with bromate yields fl uoride-scluble Np(VI),
but other actinides and lanthanides are not oxidized and, hence,
are precipitated in a subsequent LaF; precipitation step. After
removal of solids, Np is reduced to the tetravalent state and
again coprecipitated with LaF. Pa is coprecipitated with manganese
dioxide preceding the LaF; precipitation as required.'?' LaF,
precipitation has been used to separate Np(IV) and Np(V} from

Np(vl).'??

Zirconium Phosphate. Tetravalent ions of Np, Pu, Ce, Th,
and other elements are coprecipitated with zirconium phosphate.
A variation of this method by Magnusson, “hompson, and Seaborg'?!
is based on oxidation-reduction cycles. after zirconium ion and
NaBiO; are added, the solution is heated to oxidize Np and Pu to
the hexavalent state. HPO, is added to carry tetravalent ions.
The supernatant solution is treated with e¢xcess hydrazine to
destroy bismuthate and then with ferrous ion to yield Np(IV) and
Pu(I1X); Np is carried with zirconium phosphate, but Pu(III) and
U(VI) are not carried. The zirconium phosphate is dissolved in

HNOy - HF, and Np is separated from Zr by coprecipitation with LaFy.

- 43 -
Barium Sulfate. Ce, Ba, La, and Np(IV) in quantities from
carrier-free trace levels to 1 mg are coprecipitated >99.7% by
barium sulfate from strong sulfuric acid solutions containing
potassium salts and hydrogen peroxide. This causes a separation
from most other elements. Np was separated by dissolution of
the barium sulfate and reprecipitation fros concentrated sulfuric
acid containing chromic acid; Np(IV) was nct carried with the Ce,
Ba, and La. The Np in the supernatant was reduced to Np(IV}) with
hydrogen peroxide and again coprecipitated with barium sulfate,
After the precipitate was filtered, ??*Np vas determined by gamma
counting of the filter.'’’ The method has been further modified'?"
and also applied to a wide variety of environmental and biological

samples'?® (Procedure 15, p176).

Hydroxides. Insoluble hydroxides coprecipitate all oxidation
states of Np except Np(VII).*3:127-12% Generally, the trivalent
and tetravalent states are carried most effectively. The choice
of reagent for precipitation depends on the composition of the
solution. Strong bases are used when the solution contains cations
that are amphoteric (Al, Pb, Zn) or when the solution contains
organic complexing ligands. When the solution contains cations
that form ammine complexes or are insoluble in strong base (Cu,

Co, Ni, Ca, Mg), ammonia is used as precipitant.

- 44 -
Other Inorganic Coprecipitants. Np(IV) is coprecipitated
with bismuth phosphate and the double sulfate of lanthanum and
potassium. Coprecipitation with lanthanum potassium double sele-
nate gives results similar to those described for the double

sulfate but does not have any advantages.!?®®

The pentavalent cations of the transuranium elements are

coprecipitated with potassium uranyl tricarbonate.'’!

Dupetit and Aten'?? described the coprecipitation of tetrava-
lent actinides with thorium peroxide and uranium peroxide.
Neptunium is completely carried by thorium peroxide, but results
were poor with uranium peroxide. This was attributed to the

presence of Np(V).

Other less common carriers for Np(IV) include thorium and

lanthanum oxalates and zirconium, thorium, and ceric iodates.

Other Organic Coprecipitants. Zirconium phenylarsonate and
zirconium benzenesulfinate are specific for coprecipitation of
the tetravalent ions from solution. The t:ransuranium elements
are separated from other cations and from cach other by a series
of oxidation-reduction steps similar to those outlined for

zirconium phosphate. '*?

Kuznetsov and Akimova''" have proposed a number of organic
reagents for concentrating the tetravalent cations of the trans-
uranium elements from very dilute solutions. Np(IV) and Pu(lV)

form hexanitrato species in nitric acid-nitrate salt solutions,

- 45 -
and these cations are coprecipitated with the nitrate precipitates
of heavy organic cations. Of the reagents studied, butylrhodamine
was the most effective organic cation. In concentrated nitrate
solutions, U(IV), TR(IV), and Ce(IV) coprecipitate with Np(IV)

and Pu{IV). Other coprecipitation was with quaternary ammonium
bases, dimethyl dibenzyl ammonium, and benzylquinolium compounds.
Excellent separation from rare earths, iron, chromium, manganese,

and copper was attained. '’®

With many organic reagents containing sulfonic groups,
tetravalent elements form soluble cyclic salts that are coprecipi-
tated with precipitates formed by the cation of a ba. 'c dye
(arsenazo) and the cyclic organic reagent. Compared to the organic
nitrates above, the precipitation is more complete but less

selective. '3¢

Np(Vl) is carried with sodium uranylacetate.

Precipitation. Precipitation of macro quantities of Np is
seldom used as an analytical or radiochemical method. If other
cations that form insoluble compounds are present, these must
be separated first. When the solution is relatively free from
other ions, a method such as alpha counting is usually more rapid
and offers less health hazard. A number of Np compounds have
low solubilities in aqueous solution; however, indefinite
stoichiometry or necessity for calcination tp the oxide limits

the usefulness of direct gravimetric determination.

- 46 -
Hydrorides. No information is available on Np(III) "hydroxide,"
probably because it is rapidly oxidized even in an inert atmosphere.
Np(1V) is precipitated from mineral acid solutions by sodium,
potassium, and ammonium hydroxides as the hydrated hydroxide or
hydrous oxide. The brown-green gelatinous solid is difficult to
filter; it is easily redissolved in mine:al acids. No formal
solubility studies are reported, but the solubility in 1M NaNO; -

IM NaOH is <1 mg/l.

Np(V) "hydroxide' is green. The solubility in dilute ammonium
solution is 0.18 g/1; in 1M NaOH, 0.017 g/l; and in 2.2M NaOH,
0.014 g/1.%° There was speculation in the early iterature’®
that Np(V) might precipitate as NH NpO3*:H20 or an analogous
sodium compound as well as NpOz(OH)*H;0; however, the exact nature
of the precipitate has not been confirmed. Np(VI) is precipitated
as dark brown (NH4)2Np207°H,0 with exces: ammonia from mineral
acid solution; the solubility is given as 25 mg Np/1.'® When
sodium hydroxide is the precipitant, a brown compound with reported
composition NazNp207°xHz0 is precipitated. Studies on the variable
composition of the uranates leave some question as to the composi-

tion of the neptunates given above,'?’

Fluorides. Grayish-lilac colored Np(II1l) fluoride is pre-
cipitated by adding a dilute HCl solution of Np(III) containing
Rongalite to a solution of ammonium fluoride or hydrofluoric acid
in dilute hydrochloric acid while sparging with argon. The dry

compound was quite stable to oxidation." Np (IV) fluoride hydrate

- 47 -
is precipitated when hydrofluoric acid is added to an acid solution

of Np(IV).

Ammonium Np (IV) pentafluoride precipitates as a bright-green
granular solid when hydrofluoric acid is added to a solution of
Np (IV) containing NH," ions. A similar precipitation in the pre-
sence of potassium ions yields a bright-green precipitate that
X-ray diffraction indicates is KNp2Fs. Tie supernatant IM HF -
0.01M NH. from precipitation of the ammonium salt contained 1.1
mg Np/l two hours after precipitation; th: solubility of the
potassium salt was 1.7 mg Np/1 after 16 hours in 0.5M H,SO, -

0.5M K,50, - 2M HF .2?8

A double fluoride precipitate of La and Np with an approximate
composition La,NpF;,*xH,0 is obtained by adding hydrofluoric acid
to an acid solution o equivalent amounts of La’" and Np“©. The

solubility of the salt in water was 4 mg/..>°

Rubidium neptunyl(V) fluoride was prepared by injecting a
chilled ~0.1M HNO; solution of NpO,* into a chilled solution of
"12M RbF at 0°C. The gray-green precipitate was washed with small

amounts of water, methanol, and acetone followed by air drying. !?®

Oxalates. Brown Np2(C204)3°nHz0 (n 11) is precipitated by
adding oxalic acid containing Rongalite irto a dilute acid solution
of Np(III) also containing Rongalite. The compound is appreciably

. ge. . . %
oxidized within a few hours. '?

- 48 -
After valence adjustment to Np(IV) with ascorbic acid,“®
bright-green Np(C204)2°6H20 is precipitated from solutions
originally containing 5 to 50 g of Np(IV), (V), or (VI) in 1 to
4M HNOjy by the addition of oxalic acid. Tie solubility varies as
a function of the concentration of nitric acid and oxalic acid
(Figure 3). At oxalic acid concentrations ncar 0.1M, the solu-
bility varies between 6 and 10 mg/l as the nitric acid concentra-
tion is varied between 1 and 4M. The solutility is very dependent
on maintaining all the neptunium in the tetravalent state.

Significant separation from a number of cations is attained.

The salt (NHi)«[Np(C204)4]" (NHy)2C204°xH20 has bei. isolated.???
The soluble aqueous complex was cooled to 0°C to remove excess
ammonium oxalate. Ethyl alcohol addition produced an oily, dark-

green liquid that yielded dark-green crysta.s when treated with

96% ethanol.

Green neptunyl (V) oxalate (Np0:C204H*2H20) is precipitated
when a solution of Np(V) in IM HCl is treated with a 10% solution

of oxalic acid in tert-butanol.“!

Neptunyl (VI) oxalate (Np02C.0,°3H;0), a grayish-green
crystalline solid, is precipitated from 2M HNO; - 0.05M KBrO,
containing 20 to 40 g Np/l1 by adding oxalic acid until the solution
is "0.3M HzC204."? The solubility in 0.5M HNO3 - 0.023M H,C20.

Peroxide. Np(IV) peroxide is precipitated from solutions
containing Np(IV), (V), or (VI) in >3M HNO; by the addition of
hydrogen peroxide.'"® The higher valence states are rapidly
reduced to Np(IV), and gray-purple neptunium peroxide precipitates.
The precipitation does not progress through the highly colored,
soluble peroxy complexes that are characteristic of plutonium
peroxide. Two crystalline forms were prepared depending on the
acidity of the precipitation solution. The solubility is reported
as a function of the concentrations of nitric acid and hydrogen
peroxide. A minimum solubility of ~10~“M neptunium occurred in
solutions 1.5 to 2.5M HNO; and 4.5M H:02. The solubilities were

not readily reproducible at nitric acid concentrations of <2.5M.

Iodates. Precipitation of Np(IIl) iodate has not been
reported. Np(IV) iodate, a tan-brown solid, is precipitated when
HIO3 or KIOs is added to a dilute mineral acid solution. The
solubility in IM HCl - 0.1M HIO; is 0.8 g/l; in IM HCl - 0.1M KIOj,
0.08 g/1.%°% These solubilities appear to be high, possibly because

some Np was in higher oxidation states.

Acetate. Rose-colored NaNpO, (C:H3;0;)3 is precipitated when
a sodium acetate - sodium nitrate solution is added to a dilute
sulfuric acid solution that has been heated to 90°C in the pres-
ence of potassium bromate to give NpO22*. The solubility is

"0.1 g/1 in 0.5M H2S04 - 0.07M NaNOs - 2M Na(:H0,.°®

Carbonates. No simple carbonates of Np (III) and Np(1V) are
reporiad. A light-colored precipitate of Np (V), KNp02COjs, is
precipitated by addition of solid alkali carbonate (to about pH 7)
to a solution of Np(V) made by reduction of Np(VI) with iodide

ion. "3

Phosphate. A green gelatinous precipitate, Np(HPO,):*xH20,
is formed when phosphoric acid is added to Mp (IV) in hydrochloric
or nitric acid. The solubility in IM HCl - 0.5M HsPO, is "56

mg/l, and the solubility in 1M HNO; - IM H3l0, is “134 mg/1."S

Sulfates. Mefod'eva and Gel ‘man’? report precipitation of
Np(iII) as the complex sulfates KsNp(SO4)4 ind NaNp(SOs)2°nH:0.
Np(III) is produced in dilute hydrochloric and sparged with argon
at 50°C using Rongalite reductant. In the dry form, the complex
sulfates are stable to oxidation even at increased temperature. ’?
Np(IV) is crystallized from hot concentrated sulfuric acid as a
bright-green compound, presurably Np(SO4)2°:tH20. The solubility
is +16 g Np/l. Sulfuric acid solutions of lip(V) and Np(VI) have
been reported, but no data are given on solubility. ?? Although
not reported, it is expected that Np(IV) compounds analogous to
Pu(IV) compounds could be precipitated from a solution containing

sulfate salts, alkali metal ions, and Np(IV).

Other Compounds. Several Np(IV) chloride complex salts have
been prepared. Yellow Cs:NpCls was precipitated by mixing solutions

of Np(IV) and CsCl in 2 to 1IM HCl and saturating the resulting

B. SOLVENT EXTRACTION

Solvent extraction of Np from aqueous solution into immiscible
organic solvents is probably used most often for separation because
of its rapidity, simplicity, and reliability. Solvent extraction
of Np is usually made from nitrate systems. Generally the effi-
c.ency and specificity are decreased from chloride systems; other
systems, such as fluoride, sulfate, and phosphate, form complex ions

with neptunium, and extraction is inhibited.

There are examples of both ion association extraction and
chelate extraction among the solvent extrac:ion systems for Np.l“*»1"%S
In chelate systems, compounds such as TTA, cupferron, acetylacetone,
and 8-hydroxyquinoline replace coordinated water from neptunium
ions and form neutral, almost covalent, che.iate compounds that are
soluble in such organic compounds as hydrocarbons. In ion associa-
tion systems, several mechanisms are possible by which uncharged,
extractable compounds are formed by electrostatic attraction
between oppositely charged ions. In one ion association system,
an oxygen-containing organic compound such as ether is coordinated
to Np(IV), and the complex cation is associated with nitrate ions
to give an uncharged extractable species. Ion association solvents
commonly used for Np extraction include TBP, hexone, diethylether,
iscamyl alcohol, pentaether, and dibutyl carbinol. For solvents
such as hexone and diethylether, which forz coordination complexes

with actinide nitrates, the order of extractability of the various

- 54 -
oxidation states is usually (VI) > (IV) >> (III) and (V}, with the
last two states generally considered to be nonextractablie. The
(IV) oxidation state is poorly extracted ty diethylether but is
extracted into hexone and dibutyl carbinol. For TBP and chelating
agents, which form coordination complexes with the metal nitrates,
the stable oxidation state giving the strongest complex is usually
extracted most efficiently. The tendencies of the actinides to
form complexes is (IV) > (VI) > (III) and (V). Thus, TBP, TTA,
and other complexing agents usually extract the (IV) state most
effectively. An exception (Table 17) is Np(IV)-TBP; however, these
exceptions may be the result of the instability of the oxidation

state in the aquebus solution.

Groh and Schlea!“® and Schulz and Benedict’ have reviewed

production-scale neptunium processes, including solvent extraction.

Chelate Syatems. A large number of »>i-functional reagents
that form strong coordination complexes with metal ions have
been investigated. These complexes are more soluble in nonpolar
organic solvents, such as benzene or CCl,, than in the aqueous
phase. Of these compounds, the fluorinated B-diketone, 2-
thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA) has been most widely used for extrac-
tion of Np in radiochemical and analytical applications.!“7?,!"®
Many variations include TTA extraction as a par: of the total

separation schewe before the analysis of Np or the determination

of its oxidation states, 127,132,149,150

Some data for the extraction of Np and other cations into
0.5M TTA in xylene for a range of nitric acid concentrations are

given in Table 18.

Shepard and Meinke have compil2d a useful set of TTA extrac-
tion curves showing extraction as a function of pH for a number
of elements.!5? The data show that by judicious pH control, TTA
extraction is useful to separate neptunium from many other

elements.

Basically, the TTA method depends on quantitative reduction
of Np to the highly extractable tetravalent state while inter-
fering ions are stabilized in inext:ractable oxidation states.
(Procedures 1 and 2, p 138 and 141). Neptunium in IM HNOs or IM
HCl is rapidly and completely reduced with ferrous sulfamate,
hydroxylamine hydrochloride-potassium iodide, or hydroxylamine
hydrochloride-ferrous chloride. Np(IV) is extracted into the TTA,
and Pu(III) and U(VI) remain in the aqueous phase. If no inter-
fering cations are present, the extract can be evaporated
directly for counting. The efficiency of separation from other
alpha emitters is verified by alpha pulse height analysis.
Fe(III), Zr(1V), and Pa(V) are strongly extracted from 1M HNO,,
but separation is attained by stripping the Np(IV) from the
TTA-xylene into 8M HNOs. Trivalent actinides and lanthanides
do not interfere. Sulfate, phosphate, oxalate, and chloride,
if present in the aqueous phase, arc complexed with Al?* before
extraction to prevent interference.

Ion Association Systems. The TBP-HNOs system is a useful
system for large-scale processing but is not widely used
for quantitative analytical separation. TB’ forms an organic-
soluble coordination complex with the metal nitrate, generally of
the type M(NO3)4*2TBP.'®> Increasing the nitrate concentration by
adding nitrate salts of Al or Ca favors ext::action. Other factors
that affect the extraction include complexing ions, reagent purity,
free TBP concentration, temperature, and miing time. A summary
of the early work with TBP has been given by Geary.'®® The
physical and chemical properties of TBP as an extracting agent

have been summarized by McKay and Healy.!®’ Other discussions of

the use of TBP are in References 168-170. Extraction coefficients

for many elements for a variety of aqueous solutions and TBP
concentrations have been reported by Schneider and Harmon; '*?

data are shown in Table 19.

Np(VI) is almost completely separated from Al(III), Am(III),
Cr(II1), Fe(Il), Fe(III), Na(I), Zn(I1), and many other cations
in one stage of TBP extraction. Separation of Np from Pu and U
involves either oxidation of Np to the (VI) state for extraction
and subsequent stripping of Np(V), or stabilization of inextract-

able Np(V) followed by extraction of Pu and U.

The following sequence of extractability has been found for
the various oxidation states of the actinides: M(IV) > M(VI) >>
M(III) > M(V). For the tetravalent actinides the sequence is
Pu(IV) > Np(IV) > U(IV) > Th(IV), while among the hexavalent
actinides the extractability decreases with increasing atomic

number: U(VI) > Np(VI) > Pu(VI)'®® (Figures 5 ard 6).

The tetravalent and hexavalent actinides are extracted from
HCl solutions with similar relative distribution coefficients as
from nitric acid but exhibit no maxima. Lower d:.stribution coef-
ficients are observed for extraction from perchloric acid solutions
because of weak complexing by the perchlorate ion. Strong complexing
agents, such as, S042”, PO.?", and F~, reduce the extractability of
all actinides appreciably; however, cations such as Al that form
quite stable complexes with these anions partially negate the

deleterious effect on actinide extraction. Distribution

separating Np(IV) from U(VI), Pu(III), Am(I(I), Cm(III), and
trivalent rare earths. The K value for Np([V) is 2103, and for
the other cations,V107!; thus, separation is attained by a single
contact followed by multiple scrubbing of the organic phase.'”’
K. Kimura'’® has determined the acid dependency of the distribu-
tion coefficients for many elements extracted by 50 vol%
bis (2-ethylhexyl)orthophosphoric acid (HDEHP. from HCl solutions

(Figure 7). These data offer the basis for separating Np from

many cations.

The distribution coefficients of Am(IIl), Pu(IV), Np(V), and
U(VI) in HDEHP from HNO, are given in Figure 8.!7? The dis-
continuity in the Np(V) curve at high acid concentrations is
probably due to disproportionation of Np(V) into Np(IV) and Np(VI),

both of which are more extractable than Np(V).

Np(V) in dilute nitric acid has been separated from U(VI),

Extraction with methyl isobutyl ketone (hexone) is based on
the solvent power of hexone for the covalent nitrates of the (VI)
oxidation states. Hexone was used for large-scale processing of
irradiated nuclear fuels (''redox" process) but has been supplanted
by other solvents both in plant and laboratory applications. A two-
cycle extraction system for the separation of neptunium from
uranium- fission product mixtures has been given by Maeck.!®S
Hexone extraction of Np(VI} from acid-deficient AI(NO;); was
followed by TTA extraction. Excellent separation from U, Pu, Ru,
and Zr was attained. Also, Np has been separated from Pu and La.
Np(V1I) and Pu(VI) were produced by oxidation with KBrOji; both
were extracted into hexone from an A1(NJi); solution. Back
extraction with an aqueous sodium nitrite solution yielded Np(V)
and Pu(III), neither of which is soluble in hexone. The hydroxides
were precipitated and dissolved in nitric acid, and ferrous
sulfamate war added to give Np(IV) and Pu(III). Np was extracted
into a solution of tributylamine in hexone, leaving the Pu in the

aqueous phase.}!??

different aqueous compositions are shown in Table 21.

of Np in nitrate solution is Np(IV) > Np(VI)} > Np(V), although the

tion of the aqueous phase. The extractive power of the amines in

C. ION EXCHANGE

Many variations of ion exchange are used for separating
Np from other ions. Np ions in dilute mineral acids with no strong
complexing ions are sorbed by strongly scidic cation exchange
resins, such as sulfonated polystyrene. In general, the ability
of cations to be sorbed on cation exchargers increases with
increasing charge and decreasing hydrated radius. Thus, the order
of sorbability on cation exchangers for Np is Np (IV) >» Np(III) >
Np022* > NpOZ. All Np species are sorted at low acid concentra-
tions and eluted with high concentratiors of mineral acids;
elution of NpO3 proceeds first and Np(IV) is last. Some anions
form neutral or anionic complexes with different oxidation states
of Np, so that Np may be eluted by this mechanism. Both Np(V) and
Np (VI) are slowly reduced to Np(IV) by common organic base resins.
For this reason and because cation exchange of Np (IV) coffers
limited selectivity in the separation from other multivalent
cations, this method has not been used widely for analytical

applications.

Anion exchange is one of the techniques most used for
separation of Np in analytical and process applications. The
method is simple to perform and yields excellent separation from

many other elements, including most of the fission products.

Ion exchange has been the subject ¢f many reviews. The

books of Helfferich,?’* Samuelson,®’® Anphlett,?’® and Rieman anc
Walton?°’ are good references to tho theory and applications of
ion exchangers. Other reviews of ion exchange include Massart,2°®
10

h,209,211

Korkisc and Faris and Buchanan.

Anion Exchange. Np(1V) forms anionic nitrate and chloride
complexes that are strongly sorbed by anion resins; the anionic
species provide separation from the cations of many other elements.
The hexavalent state of the actinides also form strongly sorbed
anionic chloride complexes. Greater separation of Np is attained
from most other elements in the nitrate system than in the chloride
system. The distribution coefficients oS many elements over a
wide range of nitric acid and nitrate concentrations have been

reported. Data are given in Figure 13,

In a typical anion exchange cycle, a sample containing Np
is adjusted to 7 to 8M HNOs for optimum sorption of Np(NOs)e2~
ions, and 0.01 to 0.05M ferrous sulfamat: is added to ensure that
all Np(V) and Np(VI) is reduced to Np(IV). The solution is heated
to 55°C for 30 minutes or treated with sufficient sodium nitrite
to react all the sultamate and oxidize excess Fe(II) to Fe(III);
this treatment is necessary to prevent excessive gassing in the
resin bed. The resin is washed with strong nitric acid to remove
Zr, Ru, Pa, Fe, Al, rare earths, U, transplutonium elements, and
most other cationic contaminants. Th(IV) and Pu(IV) are not
separated; however, washing with 5 to 15 bed volumes of 5 to

6M HNOy-G.05M ferrous sulfamate-0.05M hydrazine reduces Pu(IV) to
- 06 ~

then with 4M HNOj3 to elute Th(IV), and finally with 0.35M HNO,
to elute Pu(IV)., Other work with macro quantities of these
cations has shown incomplete separation of Np probably because
of some reduction to Np(IV). Also, Th(IV) and Pu(IV) were not
completely separated. The separation o Np from fission products
in 7.5M HNOy using ascorbic acid reductant is reported by

Ichikawa.2!?

with "Dowex''-2 anon resin. Equilibrium data were given for cach

equilibrium data were summarized.??” Equilibrium data were given

Np(VII) forms stable alkaline solutions as the 5p0s'- ion.
Novikov 22 al.’'! studied the anion exchange behavior of this
soluble complex as a possible basis for separation from other
clements. The sorption was irreversible for all experiments; this

was attributed to the reduction of the Np(VIE) by the resin.
An anion exchange method using the nitrate system has been
reported for removal of Np before spectrochemical determination

of cationic impurities?’? (Procedure 23, p 200).

In several reported instances, anion exchange resin exploded
or ignited after use in nitric acid or strong ni:rate solutions.??’
These accidents are thought to be due to nitration of the skeleton
of the exchange resin, leading to the spontaneous reaction in the
presence of heat. Anion exchange resin in the nitrate form
should not be stored in the dry state, and temperature should be
carefully controlled at <60°C when used in strong nitric acid.

The nitric acid concentration should be <8.5M, and flow to the

column should not be interrupted, particularly when high levels

of radioactivity are in the column.

Cation Exchange. Sulfonic acid type resins have had limited
applications for Np separations because both Np(Vl) and Np(V) are
reduced slowly by the resin." Several separations have been
reported for the pentavalent state of Np. Y. A. Zolotov and
D. Nishanov?’® reported the separation of Np from U, Pu, and
fissior products by elution of Np(V) ahead of U(VI) with 1M HNO,
from a cation resin in the hydrogen form. Np was initially oxi-
dited to the hexavalent state with bromate. Separation of Np
depended on reduction to Np(V) by the resin. Also, cation
exchange kas been used for partial separation of Np from Pu(IV),

Th(1V), and 2r(1V). Np was oxidized to Np(V) in dilute nitric

- 97 .
acid before sorption on the resin, but a few percent of the Np(V)
was reduced to Np(IV) by the '"Dowex'"-50W resin and was not

separated from the other cations.?’®

The distribution coefficients for many of the elements were
determined in 0.1 to 12M HBr with ''Dowex'-5C resin. Conditions
for separation of U(VI) and Np(IV) and separation of Np (IV) and
Pu(III) were given (Figures 22 and 23). Mary other separation
methods for Np could be devised from the distribution data

(Figure 24).2%7

Inorganic Ion Exchangers. Inorganic exchangers have been
largely superseded by synthetic resins principally because of
higher capacities and more useful physical characteristics of
the synthetic resins. However, inorganic exchangers have the
advantage of greater resistance to radiation damage. The distri-
bution coefficients of 60 cations, including Np, on hydrous
zirconium oxide, zirconium phosphate, zirconium tungstate, and
zirconium molybdate have been measured.?"? Shafiev et al.2?"?
have studied the separation of Np, Pu, and Pm on zirconium
phosphate. Np(V) is not retained while trivalent elements are
readily eluted with IM HNO;. Pu(IV) is eluted with 0.5M HNO,
containing reducing agents such as ferrcus sulfamate or hydro-
quinone. Zirconium phosphate does not change the oxidation state
of Np{(V). The sorption of Np, Th, and U from HNO,, H:SO., and
HF solutions on ammonium molybdophosphate (AMP) columns has been
determined.2***2*5 The sequence of sorption is Np(IV) > Th(IV) >>
U(VI) >> Np(VI) > Np(V). These same workers demonstrated the
separation of Th, U, and Np using columns loaded with AMP, ?"“%
Tsuboya et al.2“” demonstrated conditions in a HNO, system for
separating Np(IV) and U(VI) with a tungstic acid exchanger; Np(IV)

is much more strongly retained than U(V:) from 0.5 to 2N HNOy.

D. CHROMATOGRAPHY

Extraction Chromatography. Extrac:ion chromatography has
been applied to the separation of Np, Pu, Am, and U with 100%
TBP sorbed on diatomaceous silica. The diatomaceous silica was
initially exposed to dimethylsilane vapor, then treated with TBP,

and used as the stationary phase. Nitric acid, with and without

8 9

reducing agents, was used as the mobile shase.?"® Other workers?"
used this system for a similar separation of Np and found that
modifications were required to prevent reduction of Np{VI) to
Np(V) and to improve separation from some fission products.
Eschrich?3? used the same system to determine the oxidation states
of Np by eluting with 0.5 to 2M HNO3. The order of elution was
Np(V), Np(1V), and Np(VI). It is probablz that some reduction of

Np(VI) occurred.

2335p was separated from fission products and U on a column
of TTA sorbed on glass powder.23! The chromatcgraphic method gave
much more effective separation than batch extraction; recovery was
adequate so that isotopic dilution was not necessary. However,
two column separations were necessary to s:zparate Np frrm .r.
Wehner et al. 252 have also reported separation cf *?°Np from
fission and activation products on Poropak-Q impregnated with

TTA~o-xylene.

Some workers have used "Kel-F"* or 'Teflon"** powders coated

with an organic extractant as the stationary phase for extraction

chromatography separations. ''Kel-F'" powder :oated with trilaurylamine
nitrate has been used to separate Np from U, Pu, and fission

products. The feed was adjusted to 2M HNO; - 0.1M Fe(SQ;NH;), and
passed through the bed. After the column was washed with IM HNO,
containing Fe(SO3NH;)2, thc Np was eluted with H2S0, - HNO;.

The method is very selective for Np(IV) and has yielded chemically
pure 2?°Np when the weight ratio of U to Np vas >10!° in the feed?%?
The separation requires one to two days. A similar method was

developed for the coseparation of Np and Pu from U.2%*

Paper Chromatography. Paper chromatography Re values for
elements Ac through Am in many mixtures of either HNO3; or HCl
with methanol, ethanol, and butanol have been determined by
Keller.25%% It was necessary to reduce Np(VI) to Np(V) or (IV)
before starting the separation because Np(VI) is slowly reduced
in the column rcsulting in poor separation of the bands.
Neptunium(IV) was separated from Th(IV) with 12M HCl-butanol and
>8M HNOj;-butanol mixtures. Also, good separation of Np(IV) from
U(VI) was attained with >1M HCl-butanol; Np(V) was separated

from U(VI) with 2M HCl-ethanol as developer.

Clanet?%® measured the Rg values for elements with atomic
numbers 90 through 96 in mixtures of mineral acids with alcohols

and discussed analytical applications.

Rg values for Np(1V), (V), and (VI) have been reported for

paper treated with TOA using 0.5M HNO) developer solutions

- 105 -
containing LiNOjs, NHyNO,, or A1(NO3);. The valuzs are well
separated for the different oxidation states of Np and for the

different actinides.?3’

Rg values were also obtained for paper
treated with solutions of tetrabutylhypophosphate in acetone-
water (20:1) using developer solutions of nitric and perchloric

acid.?5®

Twelve fission and neutron capture isotopes including 23°Np,
have been separated from irradiated uranium with aquecus hydro-
fluoric and methylethyl ketone-hydrofluoric acid mixtures as

developers. 2%?

Thin Layer Chromatography. Rapid separation of different
valence states of Np from each other and from cther actinide
elements by thin layer chromatography on 'Teflcn"-40 powder
saturated with 0.1M tetrabutylhypophosphate solution has been

demonstrated.?%®

Gas Chromatography. Effective separation of the transuranium
elements by gas chromatography of their chloriies has been
demonstrated.2%® The volatile chloride complexes were synthesized
at 500°C by adding Al,Cle¢ vapors into the carrier gas. The
experiments were carried out in glass capillary coluans maintained
at "250°C with less than one microgram of each actinide. Cm, Am,
and Pu were eluted in order of decreasing atonic number in about
the same position as lighter lanthanide elements in a similar

experiment. The retention times of Np, U, and Pa are much

- 106 -
shorter; it is postulated that the tetrachlorides of these elements
are produced. The chromctogram is measured by collecting fractions
of Al:Cle¢ condensate at the exit of the column. The actinide
hydroxides are carried with La from strongly basic solution and
separated from Al, Then the actinide is deposited, and the alpha
spectrum is measured with a surface barrier detector and multi-

channel pulse height analyzer.

E. OTHER METHODS

Volattliaation. Separation of more-volatile Np{(IV)} chloride
from Pu{IlI) chloride and other less volstile chlorides has been
reported.?®!»2%2 The actinide chlorides were prepared by passing
carbon tetrachloride vapor at 650°C over mixtures of plutonium-
neptunium oxides or oxalates. The nepturium chloride sublimate
was collected with a separation factor of 3 x 10? for Np initially
containing 4% Pu; the yield was 96%. Tle method is useful for

obtaining quite pure Np where a quantitative separation is not

required.

NpF¢ is quite volatile, intermediate between UF¢ and PuFg.
Separation was attained from UFg by co-scrption of the hexafluo-
rides on NaF, Then the NpFg*NaF complex was reduced, and the UFg

desorbed. After refluorination, the NpF, was desorbed.?®?

Electrophoresis. Clanet?®® has developed an electrophoretic
method on cellulose acetate membranes tc separate the charged

species formed by elements with atomic numbers 350 to 86 in 1 to

- 107 -
12M HC1 and HNO3. Mobility curves have beer obtained for the acid
concentration range for both acids. A large number of potential
separations of these elements and the solution conditions are
tabulated. Some of the separations of Np irclude Np(IV) or (V)
from U(VI); Np(IV) from Pu(IV) or (VI); Np(1V¥), (V), or (VI) from

Am{IiI) and Cm(III); and separation of the cxidation states of Np.

Electrodepcsition, Although electrodeposition has been used
to prepare mounts for radiometric measurement, electrolysis has
not been used as a separation method. There has been one report
that U, Pu, and Np were separated by electrolysis from HNO; by
varying the pH. Optimum conditions were stuted as current density
750 to 1000 mA/cm? with a plating time of 2 to 3 hours and solution
volume of 20 to 30 ml. Np is completely deposited at pH > 9, and
Pu and U are completely deposited at pH <6 und pH <3, respectively.?®*
Other workers using different media for electrolysis have been
unsuccessful in separating Np from other ac:inides. Although

partial separation from a number of common cations has been attained,

no useful separation method has been reported.

Miscellateous. An analytical scheme has been described which
yields sequential separation of the elements including Np remaining
after neutron exposure of | mg of a fissile dlement.’*% The
products were separated and isolated for determination of isotopic
abundance by mass spectrometry using solvent extraction, ion

exchange, extraction chromatography, and precipitation methods.

VIII. ANALYTICAL METHODS

A. SOURCE PREPARATION AND RADIOMETRIC METHODS

Counting. Because counting methods are more seisitive than
chemical or spectrochemical methods, they are the primary methods
for identifying and quantitatively determining Np. The two most
common Np isotopes are 2*’Np and ?*’Np. 237vp is usually determined
by alpha counting its two major alpha transitions at 4.781 and 4.762
MeV. If 2''Np has decayed for a period of about 6 months or longer,
it can be determined by gamma ray spectroscopy of its 2''pa
daughter. If ?3'Np is separated from 2°Pa which has an 86.6-keV
gamma ray, the 2'’Np 86.6-keV gamma ray can be counted directly.
23%p is determined by gamma counting its gama transitions at
228 and 278 kev.!®

The gross alpha activity of *'’Np can be determined with a
proportional counter or plastic scintillation counter. If other
alpha-emitting nuclides are present, an alphu pulse height
analysis with a surface barrier detector allows a determination of
the percentage of the total alpha counts attributable to *’7Np,

Liquid scintillation counting can be used to determine gross
alpha activity with almost 100V efficiency ard in many cases can
be used to determine *’’Np in the presence of other alpha-emitting

nuclides. The energy resolution in liquid scintillation is “600 KeV
as compared to 15 KeV for surface barrier cetectors.

Gamma-ray spectrometry with either a tal scintillation
detector or a Ge(Li) detector may be used to determine ?°°Np.
For 2’Np gamma rays (228, 278 KeV), the energy resolution of a
typical coaxial Ge(Li) detector (about 1.0 KeV) is much better
than for Nal (about 20 KeV). The efficiency of such Ge(Li)
detectors relative to a 3 x 3 in. Nal dete:tor is 3 to 15% for the
1.33-MeV gamma ray. Ge(Li) low-energy photon detectors (LEP)
have an energy resolution of 0.5 KeV with lower efficiency.

An a-y coincidence method for determinating *3’Np was

short-lived ??®Np which is determined by counting its 1.0 MeV

gamma ray. To obtain maximum sensitivity, the Np should be purified
before and after neutron irradiation.

A summary of the sensitivity and sel:ctivity of radiometric
and radioactivation methods for determiniag Np is presented in
Table 23. In summary, alpha counting is the most convenient method
for 23’Np, and gamma spectrometric methods are preferred for ?3®Np
and 23°Np. Because of the continuing advancements in nuclear
radiation detection systems, the sensitivity, precision, and

accuracy of the radiometric methods discussed above could be

Scurce Preparation. Direct evaporation is the simplest
method for preparing sample aliquots for counting. The
disadvantage for alpha pulse height analysis is the thickness
of the deposit, which results in self absorption of the alpha
particles. If a surfactant such as tetraethyleneglycol
(50 ug/cm?) is added to the aqueous solution, the Np solution is
evaporated from a film rather than a drop resulting in a more

and burns up when ignited. The diluted sample is transferred to

a suitable counting plate, e.g. stainless steel] disk, and slowly
evaporated to dryness to prevent spattering. The direct mount is
flamed to dull red heat, cooled, and coated with a thin layer of
collodion solution, and the Np is counted.

Electrodeposition has been widely used to prepare high-quality
sample mounts for precise alpha counting. The procedure is extremely
useful when samples contain a mixture of alpha emitters that need
to be resolved. Electrodeposition results in excellent sample
mounts from organic solutions that evaporate very slowly or leave
large amounts of residue and from aqueous solutions that contain
large amounts of dissolved solids.

Np and other actinides can be deposited from a variety of

electrolytes and under several conditions. Graves?®? described

- 112 -
a semiquantitative method for depositing #3’Np from Li onto Pt.
Ko?7? reported a method for quantitative deposition of Np from
0.2M HC10., - 0.15M NH4COOH, and Mitchell?’! used NH,C1 - HCl to
obtain a yield of 94%. Some systems used by other workers?72 27%
are formic acid-ammonium formate, ammonium oxalate, ammonium
acetate, ethanol, isopropanol, and NH,C1l witt uranium carrier,
Donnan and Dukes?’3 developed one of the fastest procedures
for quantitative depositions by combining Mitchell's method with
uranium carrier addition. 23®U is added as i carrier in three
increments to the NH,Cl electrolyte to ensure quantitative yield;
only 20 minutes deposition time is required. An average recovery
of 99.8% with a relative standard deviation of *0.2% (n = 10) was
obtained with Pu. Similar results were obtained with Np.
Resclution of 20 keV is achieved consistently with electro-
deposited mounts and a silicon surface-barrier detector.

Other methods which have a lower efficiency but yield sources
with excellent resolution include vacuum sublimation and electro-
spraying.2%6°291 Both electrodeposition and electrospraying have
several disadvantages. These methods take a longer time than
evaporation and require special equipment including a specially
designed electrolytic cell for electrodeposition, high voltage
equipment, and special capillary with a needle electrode for

electrostatic spraying.?%®

B. SPECTROPHOTOMETRY

Although different oxidation states of Np have sharp absorption
bands, spectrophotometric analysis has had limited use because
radiometric procedures are more sensitive. Further, alpha contain-
ment is required for the spectrophotometer, anu operation within
a glove box is tedious. Generally, procedures used for other
actinides can be applied to the determination. Np is adjusted to
a single oxidation state, and the concentration is calculated

from the molar extinction coefficient and the absorption of the

- 114 -
solution at the proper wavelength. FKhen more than one oxidation
state is present, appropriate equations ma’ be fcrmulated for the

concentration of each component,???

Absorption Bands. Important absorption bands and molar
extinction coefficients of the different oxidation states are
listed in Table 24. Most of the sharp bands can be used for
qualitative or quantitative work even thotigh they only obey
Beer's Law over a limited concentration range. The best band to
use for analysis of Np(III) is at 786 mu tecause this band obeys
Beer's Law. The strongest bands for Np(IV) (960 mu, 723 mu)
do not obey Beer's Law, but they can be used with appropriate
calibration and constant slit width. The strongest band for
Np(V) (at 980 mu in 1M HNO,) does obey Beer's Law;2%® a high-
resolution monochromator (e.g., a double-grating monochromator)
should be used. Cauchatier' and coworker:2°® have developed a
method for determining Np in irradiated nuclear fuels by measuring
the Np(V) band in IM HNO. The pentavaleat state is produced by
adding hydrazine to a Np(V)-Np(VI) mixture obtained after
evaporation of the nitric acid solution. Correction for Pu(VI)
is necessary. The most useful band for Np(VI) is at 1.23 um;
Colvin developed a method using this band for measurements in
nitrate solution.??® In this method, Np is oxidized toc the
hexavalent state with sodium dichromate, and than the acidity is

adjusted to 1 to 2M, The absorbance is measured at 1.23 um

Color Complexes. Spectrophotometri: methods for Np lack
sensitivity. Furthermore, the position of the band extinc*ion
coefficients are affected by some anions and by the Np concen-
tration. These disadvantages are partially overcome when color
complexes that have very high molar extinction coefficients are
used. A method with arsenazo III [1, 8-dihydrcxynapthalene-3,
6-disulfonic acid-2, 7-bis(azo-1) benzene -2-arsonic acid] is
reported. ?®1"3%9% The intensity of the s:able green complex
of Np(IV) and arsenazo III is measured a: 665 mu. The color
forms instantaneously, and its intensity is constant over
the concentration range 4 to 6M HNO;. The molar extinction
coefficient at 665 mu is ~10°. Chudinov and Yakovlev separated
u(Iv), Pu(Iv), and Th(IV), which form colored complexes, from
NpO," by extraction with di-2-ethylhexylphosphoric acid (HDEHP) in
carbon tetrachloride. After extraction, Np is reduced to Np(IV),
and arsenazo III is added. The lower linit of detection is

0.04 ug/ml, and the relative accuracy is between 1 and 7%,

Bryan and Waterbury??? separated Np from U and Pu by extrac-
tion with tri(iso-octyl)amine (TIOA) before determining the
arsenazo III complex. They found that of 45 elements tested,
only Pd, Th, U, Pu, and Zr interfered. The relative standard
deviation was between 7.2 and 1.1% in 200-mg samples of 8.5 to
330 ppm of Np. (Procedure 20, p192.) Novikor et al. have
studied the color complex of Np(IV) with Arsenazo M.3°* At

The absorbance is measured at 540 mu against a reference solution
not containing Np. The molar extinction coefficient measured
with a Beckman DU spectrophotometer is 14,500. The precision of
the method at the 95% confidence limits is #2.1% for 0.63 ug of
Np/ml. Chudinov and Yakovlev used extraction to separate Np from
U and Fu interferences. The thorin method has also been automated3®’
with the Technicon AutoAnalyzer, and the precision has been
improved.

Np(IV) forms a color complex with quercetin that is stable
in the pH range 3 to 7 and obeys Beer's Law over a concentration
range 0.4 to 4.0 ug/ml. The molar extinction coefficient is

has studied spectrophotometrically the interaction of 12 organic
dves of different types with Np0, *. 312 He concluded that the most
promising reagents for pentavalent neptunium are 1-(2-pyridylazo)

resorcinol (PAR), arsenazo Ill, and chlorophosphonazo III. With PAR,

the molar extinction coefficient is “4.3 x 10“ at 510 mu.

C. CONTROLLED POTENTIAL COULOMETRY

Determination of Neptunium Concentration. Alpha counting is
generally superior to coulometry for determining less than a few
micrograms of Np; however, controlled potential coulometry is an
accurate and precise method for determining Np above the 10-ug
level.?!'? The electrolysis cell contains a platinum electrode at

which the Np(V/V1) couple is titrated in 0 5M H.SO,. First,

- 119 -
the Np is oxidized to Np(VI} with Ce(IV), the Np(V1) and Ce(1lV)
are electrolytically reduced to Np(V) and Ce(IIl), and then Np(V)
is coulometrically oxidized to Np(VI}. The integrated current

in the last step is used tc calculate the concentration of Np.
The standard deviation ranged from 6% for 7 ug to 0.05% for about
1 mg of Np. As little as 2 ug was detectad. Elements which
significantly interfere are Au, Pt, Hg, Tl, and Cl ; Pu and Pd
cause only slight interference. Stromatt's method was used
successfully with a gold electrode instead of a platinum electrode
to eliminate the Pt/Pt (OH), reaction repo:-ted by Fulda.’!"

Fulda obtained a precision of #0.6% for 6 mg of Np. In another
application of Stromatt's method, the precision was 0.1% (n = 8)
for 9 mg of Np. Also, Buckingham?!’ demonstrated a ccefficient
of variation for the coulometric method of $0.8% for neptunium
oxide and *1.1% (n = 11) for neptunium nitrate solutions.

6

Delvin and Duncan’'® used the same method in the presence of

7 used

nitrate with H,SO, electrolyte. Plock and Polkinghorne’!
coulometry to analyze solutions of dissolved alloys for both U and
Np without prior chemical separation. Propst®!® has reported a

coulomteric method for Np using a conducting glass electrode in a

thin-layer electrochemical cell. Organic contaminants interfered

and were removed by bisulfate fusion before coulometry.

- 120 -
Determination of Oxidation States. This method applies to
the (IV), (V), and (VI) states and was reported by Stromatt.’!?

The analysis depends on the fact that Np(IV) is not cxidized, nor
is Np(V) reduced at a significant rate at a plitinum electrode in
IM H250, electrolyte. The procedure is: (1) 2 potential is applied
at the controlled potential electrode to reduc? Np(Vl) to Np(V);
(2) Np(V) is electrolytically oxidized to Np(VI); (3) Ce(IV) is
added to oxidize Np(IV) to Np(VI); (4) excess Ze(IV) and Np(VI)
are electrolytically reduced to Ce(III) and Np(V); and (5) Np(V)
is electrolytically oxidized to Np(VI). Np(VI) is determined in
the first step. The difference between the integrated currents
for the first and second titrations corresponds to Np(V), and
the difference between the integrated currents for Step 5 and
Step 2 corresponds to Np(IV).

Determination of Oxidation-Reduction Potential. The potential
for the Np(V)/ (VI) couple was measured in sulfuric, perchloric, and
nitric acids with a platinum electrode.’? The potential in HCl
was not obtained because of reduction of Np(VI) by chloride.

The inability of the method to measure irreversible couples,
such as Np(IV)/(V), is a serious limitation. The potential for

the Np(III)/(IV) couple was obtained with a mercury electrode.

D. POLAROGRAPHY
Alternating current polarography with square-wave or pulse

polarcgraphs has been applied to determine small concentrations

- 121 -
of Np. Slec and others’?* have reported an analytical method
with square-wave polarography to determine Np in Pu after pre-
liminary separation from Pu by TTA extraction. Np is back-
extracted from the TTA into 10M HNO,. After several cvapora-
tions with nitric acid and wet ashing with mixed nitric

and perchloric acid (to oxidize organic material), the final por-
chlorate residue is taken up in 1 ml of C1. I mi of SM hydroxyl-
amine hydrochloriie is added, and the solution is evaporated to
reduce the volume to 0.5 xl. Then, 0.5 nn] of IM EDTA is added;
the solution is adjusted to pH 5.5 to 6.5 with several drops of
ammonia and diluted to 5S ml. Exactly 2 n=l of the dilution are
transferred to a polarographic cell and sparged with nitrogen.
The Np peak is recorded at about -0.8V ajainst the mercury pool
electrode on the square-wave polarograph. Then an accurately
measured aliquot of a standard Np solution prepared in EDTA is
added to the cell, and the Np concentration in the original
solution is calculated from the increase in peak height.
Interference from the oxidation of chloride ions is decreased

by adding EDTA to shift the half-wave potential of the Np peak.
The potential for the reduction of the EDTA complex is about

700 mV more negative than for the reduction of neptunium ions;
therefore, the peak is shifted well away from the anodic oxidation
of chloride ions and is well defined. The authors report
precision of *2% and :10% for concentration ranges of 500 and

25 ppm, respectively.
Cauchetier ¢t al.?”’ reported a method which askes use of
the Np(IV)-Np(i1l) couple for determining Np in solutions of
irradiated nuclear fuels and ?''Np targets. Np is reduced
electrolytically to Np(1V), and the polarogram is taken. An
aliquot of standard Np is added to the cell, and the procedures is
repeated. The method was used to analyre solutions with a Np
content >20 mg/L containing Pu, U, Fe, Ni, Cr, and fission
products, with a precision of “2%.

Polarography and other methods were used to compare the
chemistry of U, Np, and Pu by Kraus, et al.’?! Jenkins used a
manual polarograph to study the nature and stability of EDTA
couplexes with Np(II11) and Np(1V).’?? Np(IIl) and (IV) were
studied in chloride and perchlorate media by Hindman and
Kritchevsky.’??

Np was included in a review of electrochemistry of the

§

actinides by Milner.'?" The sulfate complexes of Np(IV) were

studied polarographically by Musikax.®’

E. TITRATION

Potentiometric. 10- to 100-mg quantities cf Np were determined
by redox titration.’?® Cc(1V) is used to titrate Np(V) to Np(VI),
and iron(II) perchlorate was used to titrate Mp(VI) to Np(V). The
methods can be used successively on the same sliquot of sample
if HNOy is present (to give the required ceric oxidation potential)

and chloride ion is absent (it would be oxidi:ed to chlorine).

- 123 -
Stoppered weight burets were used for adding reagents, and a
platinum-calomel system was used to detect the end points. Relative
standard deviations for a single determination were 0.15% for
ferrous titers and 0.59% for ceric titers.

Complexomstric Titration. Np(IV) is titrated with a solution
of EDTA at pH 1.3 to 2.0 with xylenol orange as iniicator. The
reaction of Np(IV) with EDTA is stoichiometric and the color
changes from bright rose to light yellow at equal molar concentrations.
The error for determining 1 to 4 mg of Np is 1 to 2%. Np(IV) is
produced in 0.01 to 0.0SM HCl with hydroxylamine reductant. Fe’*,
Zr'*, Pu'’, Th**, and ascorbic acid interfere. Reasonably large
amounts of alkali, alkaline-earth, rare earth elements, Zn?*,
cd?*, co?®, Cr’, Mn?*, Ni?*, and UO,2* do not interfere.’2®

Chronopotentiometric. There hus been little analytical
chemistry done in molten salts, and so “ar the only useful results
have been obtained from electroanalytical methods. Np(IV) was
determined quantitatively in molten LiCl1-K(1 eutectic at 400 to

500°C with an accuracy of *4%. 27

F. EMISSION SPECTROMETRY

Np has a line-rich emission spectra with the more-sensitive
lines at 4154.5, 4098.8, 3999.5, and 3829 {.229292% (Other methods
are more useful for quantitative determination of Np than the
spectrochemical method, which is generally used only for analyses
of impurity elements. To prevent interference by the numerous
spectral lines of Np, a chemical separation is usually made, or the

carrier distillation method with gallium sesquioxide is used.
- 129 ©
A quantitative method for determinatior of impurities in Np

is reported by wheat???

(Procedure 23, page 200). The method is

a modification of one reported by Ko for Pu.’’® The neptunium
oxide is dissolved in HNO, reduced to the tetravalent state

with hydrazine and sulfamic acid, and then sorbed on anion
exchange resin. Two cycles of anion exchange are used to separate
Np. The second effluent is evaporated to dryness to decompose
hydrazine, The residue is made water soluble with aqua regia,
‘evaporated to dryness, and dissolved in 6M HCl containing Co as

the internal standard for the spectrographic anaiysis. The coefficient
of variation for a single determination of a number of common metal
ion impurities ranges from 9 to 24%. For a 50-mg sample, the

minimum concentration of impurities that car be analyzed is 0.5

to 10 ppm.

G. GRAVIMETRIC METHODS

Precipitation of Np for gravimetric determination is not a
useful method. If other ions which form insoluble salts are
present, these must be separated first. When the solution is
relatively free from other ions, alpha counting or some other
method is usually more rapid and offers less health hazard. A
number of Np compounds have low solubilities in aqueous solution;
however, indefinite stoichiometry or necessity for calcination
to the oxide limits the usefulness of direct gravimetric
determination. Often the small quantity or low concentration of

neptunium precludes the use of gravimetry.

- 125 -
Hydroxide. Np(1V) is completely precipitated from mineral
acid solution by Na, K, or NH, OH as the hydrated hydroxide or
hydrous oxide. The brown-green gelatinous solid that forms is
difficult to filter but is easily redissolved in acids. The
solubility in IM NaNO, - IM NaOH is <0.] sg/t. Np(V) "hydroxide"
is green; it is somewhat more soluble in 2 sodium nitrate-sodium
hydroxide solution. Np(VI) is precipitated as dark brown
(NHy) 2Np207°H20 with excess NH,OH from mineral acid solution, ’?

Fluorides. Np(lV) is precipitated from mineral acid solution
as green hydrated NpF, by adding excess HI’. The compound dissolves
readily in reagents which complex fluorid: ion, such as Al’* or
boric acid. When K or NHJF ia used as tha precipitant, the green
double salt KNp Fs or NHJ NpFs is produced.

Peroxides. Purple Np(I1V) peroxide is precipitated when a
large excess of H,0, is added to a strongly acidic solution of
Np(1V), Np(V), or Np(VI), because peroxide rapidly reduces
Np to the tetravalent state. Reduction is much slower in dilute
nineral acid. Np(IV) peroxide always incorporates some of the
anion into the crystal and may have different crystalline forms
depending on the acid concentration of the supernatant. Np is
separated from many cations by precipitation of neptunium
peroxide. '®

Oxalates. Green Np(IV) oxalate hexinhydrate is pracipitated
from dilute acid solution with oxalic acid. Because quantitative

precipitation is not attained for Np(V) >r Np(VI), a reducing

have also been precipitated from Np(IV) and Np(Y) solution.

Jodate. Light tan Np(IV) iodate is precipitated from dilute
mineral acid by adding excess potassium iodate.’®

Carbonate. The double carbonate of Np(V), KNpO,CC,, is
produced by adding potassium bicarbonate to a dilute acid solution
of Np(V), until the resulting solution is 0.IM In bicarbonate.
The solution is heated at 90°C for 3 to 4 hours to produce the
light tan double salt."®

Aocotate. Sodium neptunium(VI) dioxytriacetate,

Phosphate. Np(1V) di(monohydrogenphnosphate) hydrate
[Np(HPO,) ;°XH,0], a pale-green gel, is precipitated by adding

phosphoric acid to a dilute acid solution of Np(IV).?3

H. SPOT TESTS
Spot tests for determining oxidation states of Np and Pu
were obtained for 36 organic and inorganic reagents commonly used

in paper chromatography.’?! The tests we:e made on Whatman No. 1

- 127 -
paper which was treated with 2M HCl in descending chromatography
for 12 hours to remove traces of Fe, Mg, and Ca, The paper was
treated with two successive 24-hour washings Hy migration with
twice-distilled water. Because of hazards of these alpha emitters
and the high sensitivity of radioactive measurement, very
sensitive spot tests with an identification limit of less than

1 ug of actinide were selected. Observations were made in white
and ultraviolet light for both acidic and basic media with each
reagent. First the acidic media was sllowed to dry; then ammonia
was added and evaporated. A standard scale of colors was used
for comparison. In most cases, a color reaction was obtained
with less than 1 ug of actinide, but the color was the same for
all oxidation states of both Np and Pu.

Diphenylcarbazide gives a color reaction with Np(VI) but not
Np(V); however, Pu(VI) gives the same color reaction. In acid
solution, sodium alizarinsulfonate or arsenazo give a color with
Pu(IV) and Pu(VI), but no color with Np(V) and Np(VI). Four of
the reagents, chromazural-S, arsenazo, 4,2-pyridyl-azo-resorcinol,
and pyrocatechol, give fluorescent spots under ultraviolet light
with all oxidation states of Pu and Np, kojic acid fluoresces
only with Pu(III).

The oxidation states of Np and Pu were characterized from

color reactions on chromatograms and electrcpherograms.?®®

- 128 -
The tetravalent states give characteristic colors with alizarin,
arsenazo-I, and thorin-I; however, diphenylcarbazide was used for

the hexavalent state.

I. MASS SPECTROMETRY

Subnanogram quantities of ?'’Np were determined with a mass
spectrometer by Landrum, et al.’'? The instrument was a double-
focusing, 60-degree sector type, with a 12-inch radius. The
source chamber contained a tantalum filament (from which the
sample was volatilized) and a rhenium filgment (on which gaseous
species were ionized). After mass analysis, the ionized Np atoms
were collected in a Faraday cup. The method uses isotopic
dilution with 23°Np or preferably 23° ™Np. This method is much more
rapid than neutron activation, and the sensitivity is at least ten
times greester. The standard deviation for 0.1 to 0.5 nanogram
of Np was 1 to 2%. Isotope dilution with 2%°Np has also been
applied to determine ?37Np.3%?

Spark source mass spectrometry is uszful for less quantitative
measurements of many elements including Np; however, it is most
often used for determining cationic impurities in Np and other

actinides. ?®"

J. X-RAY FLUORESCENCE SPECTROMETRY
The ease of production and simplicity of the X-ray spectra

produced for elements of high atomic numter allow mixtures of

- 129 -
actinides to be analyzed by X-ray fluorescenc:® spectrometry with
considerable precision and accuracy. Either solid or liquid
samples can be analyzed by the internal standard technique.
Mixtures of U, Np, and Pu were analy.ed at ratios as high as
1:1:1; results were comparable to standard counting. U, Np, and
Pu in any combination of two elements were analyzed at ratics

as high as 1:8 without seriously affecting accuracy. However, at
ratics of 1:10, low results of 5 to 7% were obtained for the
element present at lower concentration. The principal L series
X-ray emission lines of elements with atomic numbers 92 through
96 are given by Kofoed.3®% Novikov et al.??® used X-ray
fluorescence to determine microgram amounts of Np in pure
solutions or in solutions containing Pu. The sensitivity was
0.2 to 0.3 ug of Np. The relative standard error in determining
1 ug Np was S%, and the analysis, including sample preparation,
required 30 to 40 minutes. The Ka; and Ka X-ray energies for

Np, Pu, and Am were measured by Nelson, et al.???

K. NEUTRON ACTIVATION

Neutron activation was used to determine subnanogram quantities
of 237Np.??? The unknown sample was irradiated with another Np
sample of known Np content and comparable weight in the same

average time-integrated neutron flux. After irradiation,

- 130 -
the 2?®Np was determined by gamma spec:rometry. Conventional
radiochemical separation methods were used. Isotopic dilution

237
f

with mass quantities o Np served tn determine chemical

recovery.

L. OTHER METHODS
Gamma counting 2399p, the decay product of 2%3Am, has been
used to determine 2“%Am in solutions containing large amounts of

Cm. The ratio of the equilibrium amount of “*°Np to the amount

of *“’Am was determined by separating (by TTA extraction) and
analyzing (gamma counting) 2399p trom samples in which “Iam and
239%p were known to be in secular equilibrium. The method was
compared to determining 23am by the isotope dilution-mass spectro-
metric method. The precision of the m:2thod was 7% at the 95% con-
fidence limits (n = 16) for sample alijuots that contained 0.1 to
5 ug of ?“?Am.*?® A similar approach sas reported hy Lebedev et al.?°?
213pa, the daughter of 2°’Np decay, has more-abundant gamma
rays, which are easier to measure than 237Np. Cofield?3® used
this as a basis for determining 23’Np-2%?Pa in human lungs by
in vivo gamma spectrometry with a large Nal scintillation detector
in a low-background counting chamber.
The neutron capture cross section of 23*U was measured by
analysis of 23°Np produced [2*®U(n,y)?%%U § 239\p] . The procedure
uses isotope dilution with 237Np to determine chemical yield,

Characteristic isomer shift ranges have bean measured
fcr several valence states of Np using Mossbauer resonance
of the 59.54-keV gamma ray of 237Np. They exteid from about
-6.8 cm/sec to +5 cm/sec for the individual oxidation states
of +7 to +3 and are clearly defined.’“!’?*? The isomer shift
characturistic of each oxidation state is useful for study of
bonding in Np compounds. Dunlop and Kalvius have also made

: Lp . . wid
significant contributions, ?*!

IX. RADIOACTIVE SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS
The Np isotopes emit high-energy alpha particles, medium-
energy beta particles, and low-energy gamma ravs. The tendency
of Np tu concentrate in the bones with a biological half-life
of 7.3 x 10" years makes ingestion the primary hazard to personnel.
Studies of the distribution of ?’’Np in animal tissue showed

131

60 to 80% of the Np was Jeposited in the boner. Studies have

also been made of the inhalation, pulmonary absorption, gastro-
intestinal absorption, and short-term retention of 2*’Np in rats.?"?
Because ?77Np (T, = 2.14 x 10°y) is the only isotope of Np which

is available in weighable amounts, it presents the only serious
hazard. The radiation hazard is small due to the low specific

activity of 2?’Np and the low energy of its gamma radiation. Table

Jel

2375p and ?**\p for continuous occupational e»posure. In

- 132 -
handling large quantities of *’’Np, standard gloved-boxes maintained
at a negative air pressure with respect to the laboratory air’*?
should be considered for containment.

Criticality is no problem for ?*’Np because the bare critical

F. L. Moore!*®

Outline of Method

Np is separated from fission products, Uli, Pu, transplutonium
elements, and nonradioactive elements by extraction into
thenoyltrifluoroacetone (TTA). After separation, an aliquot is
suitably prepared for either alpha counting of ?2’Np or gamma

counting of 2?Np.

Pretreatment

If interferences may be present in sclution with the Np
tracer, Np is adjusted to Np(IV) and carried on 1 mg of La pre-
cipitated as the hydroxide. The hydroxide precipitates are
dissolved in IM HNOy, and LaFs is precipitated to carry Np(IV).
The fluoride precipitates are dissolved in a few drops of 2M Al (NOj)s
and dilute HCl. While the extraction of Np(IV) from HNC, is
usually very effective, HCl should be used whenever possible
because there is a greater tendency to form extractable Fe(III)

ion in the HNO3 system.

It is desirable to measure the chemical yield if much
chemistry is employed. A 23’Np spike is useful for determining

239Np recovery; 2?°Np may be used for determining Z'’Np yield.

Procedure

1. Pipet a suitable aliquot of the sample intc a separatory

funnel or other extraction vessel.

2. Adjust the solution to IM HC1 - 1M NH,OH¢HC1 - 0.25M FeCl,.
KI may be used as a reductant in place of FeCl,.

3. Mix the solution for 5 min at amb. ent temperature.
4, Add an equal volume of 0.5M TTA and mix for 10 min.

5. Allow the phases to separate; then remove the aqueous
phase and discard it,

- 139 -
~4

Nash the organic phase by mixing with an equal volume of
IM HC1 for 3 min. Allow the phases to sepa~ite and

discard the aqueous wash.

Strip the Np from the organic phase by mixing with an
equal volume of 10M HNO for 2 min. (If the aqueous

strip is too high in gamma activity for alpha measurement,
the last traces of radioactive Zr and Pa may be removed
by a 5S min re-extraction of the 10M HNOy strip solution

with an equal volume of TTA.

Ordinarily, the small amount of Fe in the TTA causes
negligible self absorption in counting, and the TTA
extract is mounted directly on the counting plate. If
Fe is a problem, excellent separation is attained by
stripping the Np into 10M HNO,.

A suitable aliquot of the TTA extrict or the 10M HNO,

strip is prepared by conventional methods for either

2137

alpha counting for ?’Np or gamma :ounting for *’°Np.

Procedure 2. Separation of Np by TTA Extraction
R. S. Dorsett!’

Outline of Method

Np is determined in the presence of Pu, U, fission products,
and other alpha-emitting nuclides by extraction into thenoyltrifluoro-
acetone (TTA) followed by alpha counting of the TTA. The analysis
consists of three parts: (1) the pre-extriction step in which
acid and oxidation state are adjusted, (2) the extraction in
which Np is quantitatively extracted into TTA, and (3) the mounting
and alpha counting of the TTA extract. When additional purifi-
cation is required, the Np is stripped fron the TTA, acid and
oxidation state are adjusted, and a second extraction is done.
The precision of the method is dependent on the type and quantities
of interferences. The interferences caused by sulfate, phosphate,
fluoride, and oxalate ions are eliminated by addition of Al1(NO;),
which complexes these ions. A coefficient of variation of 2% is

obtained with relatively pure solutions.

Pretreatment

Ferrous sulfamate [Fe(NHS0y),], 2M, is prepared by dis-
solving iron powder in an excess of sulfamic acid with
minimum heating. The solution is filtered after dis-

solution,

Aluminum nitrate [A1(NOy).:], 2M, is prepared by dis-
solving 750 g of C.P. grade compound and diluting to

Fluoride method. When it is not known what impurities are

present in the solution, Np(Pu) can be carrier precipitated with

La (OH).

The hydroxide is dissolved in HNOy, and La is

taining the actinides and lanthanides is dissolved in Al (NOs);

Np in Tributylphosphate (TBP). 1f Np :.s present in TBP or
other organic extractants, it is stripped w:th dilute HNO, (0, 1M)

and then analyzed by the procedure.

Separation of Np and U. Acid control is very important for
this separation. In the analysis of low-level Np solutions that
contain large quantities of U, the prcblem is complicated because
237%p and 2°"U have the same alpha energies. Also, the specific
activity of 2%%U is 10 times greater than 2%’Np. An accurate
analysis is assured by (1) close control of “he extraction acidity,
(1 20.1M), (2) a double extraction cycle, aml (3) in extreme cases,
a fluorophotometric determination of U contert of the final TTA

extract.

Procedure 3. Determination of 2?°Np in Sanples Containing
U, Pu, and Fission Products

H. L. Smith®*7
Introduction
The procedure for determining 23°Np arfords excellent decon-
tamination from milligram quantities of U, the fissi m products
obtained from 10'? fissions, and Pu. The decontamination factor

for Pu is about 10“.

An initial fuming with H,SO, is required to ensure exchange
between the 23’Np tracer employed and 2°Np, and also to complex
U(VI). If the sample is a dissolved U foil, HNO; must be added
before the fuming step to convert U to the VI oxidation state.
Np(IV) and (V) are carried by LaF; precipitations in the presence
of Zr and Sr holdback carriers. The preciritations provide
decontamination from the activities of Zr and Sr a: well as from
U. LaF; scavenging with Np in the VI oxidation state decontaminates

from the lanthanides and partially from Pu.

The chemical yield is about 50%, and eight samples can be

analyzed in one day.

Procedure

Step 1. Pipet 1 ml of 2?’Np standard into a clean 125-ml
erlenmeyer flask, and then pipet in the sample. Wash down the
sides of the flask with a little H,0, add 1( drops of concentrated
H2S0, ,** and evaporate nearly to dryness on a hot plate. (No harm

is done if the solution is permitted to evaporate to hard dryness.)

Step 2. Dissolve the residue by boilirg briefly in a minimum

of 2M HCl. Transfer the solution to a clear. 40-ml Pyrex centrifuge

 

* The resin is supplied by the Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond,
Calif., who purify and grade the resins nanufactured by the
Dow Chemical Co.

** If the sample has been obtained from more than the equivalent
of 50 mg of soil, do not add any H;SO, since CaSO, will pre-
cipitate and carry Np to some extent.

tube; wash the fla... once wit H,0, and transfer the washings to
the tube, The volume of solution shou.d be 5 to 10 ml. (Ignore

any small residue.)

Step 3. Add 5 drops of La carrier and 3 drops of Zr hold-
back carrier. Add 2 drops of NH,OH*HC! for each ml of solution,
stir, and let stand for a few minutes. Add HF dropwise until the
yellow color of the solution disappears and the solution becomes
cloudy (LaF3). Centrifuge. Remove anc discard the supernate.

Wash the precipitate with 1 to 5 ml of HF-HNO;.

Step 4. Dissolve the precipitate by slurrying with 3 drops
of saturated H3B03; and adding 3 drops of concentrated HCl. (Ignore
any small residue.) Add 3 ml of 2M HCl and precipitate La (OH);
by adding about 1 ml of concentrated NH,OH. Centrifuge, and
discard the supernate. Wash the precipitate by boiling it briefly

with several milliliters of H;O0. Centrifuge and discard the

supernate.

Step 5. Dissolve the precipitate in about 5 ml of 2M HCl.
Reprecipitate LaF; by adding 10 drops of HF; centrifuge, and
discard the supernate. Wash the precipitate with 1 ml of HF-HNO,.
If the precipitate volume is greater thin 0.2 ml, repeat the
hydroxide and fluoride precipitations until the volume of LaF,

precipitate does not exceed 0.2 ml.

- 147 -
Step 6. Dissolve the fluoride precipitate in 1 drop each =f
saturated H3BO3 and concentrated HNO;. Add 10 drops of KMnO,,
and allow to stand for 5 min. Add 2 drops of HF, and allow the
solution to stand for a few mirutes. Centrifuge, and transfer
the supernate to a clean centrifuge tube. Wash the precipitate
with 1 ml of HF-HNOj;, centrifuge, and add the supernate to the

previous one. Discard the precipitate.

Step 7. Add 2 drops of La carrier to the sclution, stir.
centrifuge, and transfer the supernate to i clean centrifuge
tube, Wash the precipitate with 1 ml of HIF-HNOj;, add the

washings to the previous supernate, and discard the precipitate.

Step §. Add 5 drops of NH;0HeHC1 and 2 drops of Zr carrier,
and let stand for a few minutes. Add 2 drops of La carrier, stir
well, centrifuge, and discard the supernate. Wash the prec pitate

with 1 ml of HF-HNOj3;, centrifuge, and discerd the supernate.
Step 3. Repeat Steps 6 and 7.

Step 10, Add 5 drops of NH,OH*HC1 ard 2 drops of Si hold-
back carrier, and let stand for a few minutes. Add 2 drops of
La carrier, stir well, centrifuge, and discard the supernate.
Wash the precipitate with 1 ml of HF-HNOj, centrifuge, and discard

the supernate,

- 148 -
Step 11. Dissolve the precipitate with 1 drop of saturated
H3B03 and 10 drops of concentrated HCL. Pass the solution through
a "Dowex" 1-X10 anion exchange column, 3 cm x 3 mm, and wash the
column with 1 ml of concentrated HCl. The Np, now in the IV
oxidation state, is sorbed on the column. If necessary, remove
Pu from the column with HI-HC1.* Add approximately 1 ml of
0.1M HC1 to the reservoir of the column. Discard the first 2 drops
that come off the column, and then collect approximately 0.25 ml
in a clean, dry centrifuge tube. Use no air pressure when eluting
the Np. Pick up the solution in a transfer pipet and evaporate
by stippling on a 2.5 cm Pt plate. If possible keep the deposit
within a 1.3 cm circle. Flame the sample to dull red in a
burner, mount with double-sided Scotch tape in the center of an

Al plate, and o- and B-count on 3 successive dayvs.**

* The procedure should remove 95% of the Pu initially present in
the sample, If, at this point, there remains enough Pu to
interfere with the determination of the Np yield, that is,
more than 1% of the Np tracer, Pu may be removed more efficiently
in the following way: Allow 1 ml of HI-HCl solution to drip
through the column with no added pressure. Wash the column
with several ml of concentrated HCl, and discard the effluent,
which contains Pu in the III oxidation state, and proceed with
the rest of Step 11. One elution step such as the one just
described removes 99.5% of the Pu.

*+ Alpha-counting: The sample is counted in a 7.5 cm i.d. methane-
flow proportional counter with a loop znode, operated in the
a-plateau region. Beta counting: The sample is placed on the
third shelf of a methane-flow proporticnal counter with a
window thickness of 4.8 mg/cm’. An absorber (about 5 mg Al/cm?),
placed on the first shelf, stops soft tetas and alphas. The
individual counts are corrected to t,, using a half-life of
56.6 hr, and are then averaged.

Procedure 4. Determination of Np

J. Landrum?“®

Outline of Method

After the sample is dissolved, the vo.ume is reduced by

evaporation. Np and other hydroxides are precipitated with 50%

NaOH to separate Al. The precipitate is dissolved in concentrated

H71, and Np is separated from many impurities by chloride anion

exchange.

Further separation is attained by performing in order:

TTA extraction, cupferron extraction, and chloride anion exchange.

The plate for counting is prepared by electrolysis.

To the sample add about 3 x 10° alpha counts/min 2°’Np stan-
dardized tracer. Add "2 mg of La?* carrier and 2 ml 55% HI

(no inhibitor), and hoil the sclution until the volume has been
reduced to about 10 ml. Transfer to a 40-ml cone. Add suffi-
cient 50% NaOH to dissolve any Al that may be present. Heat

in a water bath, centrifuge, and discard the supernatant

liquid.

Wash the precipitate with 10 ml of 10M NaOH. Again heat,
centrifuge, and decant. Wash the precipitate thoroughly
with 30 ml of HO (to remove most of the Na‘ salts),

centrifuge, and decant.

Dissolve the precipitate in 10 ml of concentrated HCI.
Add 2 drops of 55% HI (no inhititor).

Cool and saturate the solution with HCl gas. (Tf white
salts precipitate, centrifuge them and decant.) Pass

the solution through a "Dowex" 1-X8, 50 to 100 mesh
column, 6 mm I.D. by 11 cm, pretreated with concentrated
HC1 - 0.5M HI. Discard the effluent. If 23%Pu is to

be measured, save the effluent and note the time of Np-Pu

separation,

Wash the column with 15 ml of 10M HC1 - 0.5M HI, and
collect the wash with the effluent.

Elute the Np with three 5-ml portions of SM HCl, and
allow a minute or so between elutions. Collect the
eluate in a 125-m]l Erlenmeyer flask.

Add 2 drops HI, and boil to nesr dryness. Transfer to
a 40-ml cone with 1M HCl. Add IM HCl to make approximately

Add 10 ml of 0.4M TTA in benzene, toluene, or xylene,
and equilibrate for 30 min. Soparate the layers by
centrifuging, and transfer the organic layer into a
clean 40-ml cone. Repeat the oxtraction with 5 ml of
0.4M TTA for 10 min. Combine tthe organic fractions.

Discard the aqueous fraction.

Wash the organic with 5 ml of IM HCl for 2 min. Centri-

fuge, and discard the aqueous.

Back-extract the Np by equilibrating the TTA with 2 ml
of 9M HCl for 10 min. Separate the layers as before,
and transfer the aqueous to a clean cone. Repeat the
extraction with 1 ml of 9M HCl for S min. Combine the

aqueous phases.

To the combined aqueous phases, add 2 drops of 6%
cupferron and 5 ml of CHCl. Equilibrate for 30 sec.
Discard the CHCl; (lower layer). Add 5 ml of CHCl; and
repeat the extraction. Again discard the CHCl;. This

step is designed to remove trouslesome Nb activity.

Transfer the solution to a 125-inl Erlenmeyer flask, add 1 ml
concentrated HNO;, and boil to near dryness. Add 5 ml of 9M
HCl and 1 ml of concentrated formic acid. (CAUTION: The
reaction between HNO; and formic: acid may be violent if too
much HNOs is present.) Warm the solution until the HNO; has
been destroyed. This step oxid:zes U(VI) and reduces
Np(1V).

Add 5 ml of fresh concentrated HCl (final HCl concentration
should be >10M, use HCl gas if necessary). Pass the
solution through a "Dowex" 1-X8, 50 to 100 mesh, 6-mm

I.D. x S em column, pretreated with 10M HCl. Wash the
column with 5 ml of 10M HCl. Discard the effluent and

16. Examine on a Nal detector for gammi contamination. If

the sample is radiochemically pure, plate the sample.

Electroplating

Boil the solution from Step 10 to near dryness. Add 1 ml of
saturated NH,Cl and one drop of methyl red indicator, and adjust
acidity with NH,OH and 1M HCl so that one drop of IM HCl turns the
solution red. (Volume should be 3 to 4 ml.] Transfer the solution
to an electroplating cell fitted with a Pt wire anode and a 1l-in.-
diameter Pt disc cathode. Pass approximately 1.5 amps through

the cell for 15 min.

Add 1 ml of concentrated NH,OH to the cell while electrolysis
is in progress. Continue plating for another 15 to 30 sec. Remove
the solution from the cell, and check it for activity in a well
counter. If appreciable activity is present, repeat the plating

procedure without the addition of NH.Cl.

Dismantle the cell, flame the Pt disc to a dull red, and
alpha count for chemical yield. Gamma and beta count for 2¥°Np

and 2?°Np.

Procedure 6. Determination of Np in Sample Containing Fission
Products, U, and Other Actinides

A. Schneider!®®

Introduction

This procedure describes an analytical solvent extraction
method for separating Np from Pu, Am, Cm, U, Th, and fission
products using tri-iso-octylamine (TIOA) and thenoyltrifluoroacetone
(TTA). Np is separated from Pu, Am, Cm, and fission products by
extraction of Np(IV) into the amine from HNO; containing a
reducing agent. Further purification is obtained by stripping
Np from the amine with dilute HCl ani then extracting the Np

into TTA.

Reagents
® 5M HNO,
® 3M [Ferrous Sulfamate], Fe(NH2S0:):

Procedure

1. To a 5-ml extraction vial add 1.5 ml of SM HNO; and a
glass-covered magnetic stirring bar.

2, Pipet the sample (not to exceed 200 uf) into the HNO,
and stir.

- 158 -
Add 3 drops 2M Fe(NHz503)2; aad 1 drop of 5.5M NaH.
Stir and allow to stand for 5 min at room temperature.

Add 1.0 ml of 10% TIOA in xylene and stir for 3 min to
produce an emulsion. Allow the phases to separete,
Separate the phases, and discard the aqueous.

Transfer the organic phase from the original vial to a
clean vial containing 1.5 ml of SM HNO,, 3 drops of
Fe(NH2S03)2, and 1 drop of N;H,. Stir for two minutes,
allow the phases to separate, and discard the aqueous

phase.

Transfer exactly 0.75 ml of the organic phase to a clean
vial containing 2.5 ml of IM HCl and 1.5 ml of xylene.
Rinse the 0.75-ml pipet in tle xylene phase of the new
vial. Stir for 3 min and allow the phases to separate.

Discard the organic phase.

Transfer exactly 2.0 ml of the aqueous HCl phase to a
clean vial. Add 3 drops of 5M NH;OH-HCl1l and 3 drops of
2M Fe(NHzS03)2. Stir and heat at 65°C for 3 min. Remove
from the bath, and let stand for 3 min.

Add 1.0 ml of 0.5M TTA in xylene. Stir for 4 min to give
a complete emulsion. Allow the phases to -eparate. The
organic phase contains the purified Np. This phase is

mounted for alpha counting for measurament of 2*7Np.

Notes

1,

The presence of fluoride, sulfate, uxalate, and phosphate
lower the extraction coefficiant of Np(IV) into TIOA;
Chloride ion does not interfere. The deleterious effect
of these anions is circumvent:d by reducing the sample
size or by adding Al ion.

- 159 -
+3

For U-tree samples, the combined system yields 9¢ =2%
recovery. For U-bearing samples, the recoveries are
dependent on the amount of U taken. The extraction
conditions are reproducible, and for control analyses
the recovery factors are included in the calculations.

In routine use, the combined extraction system achieves
a separation from common fission products (Ce, Ru, Nb,
Zr, Cs and Sr) of about 1 x 10% and a Pu separation

factor of 5 to 50 x 10°,

Control of the method for samples of unknown composition
is maintained by spiking a portion of the sample solution
with 2?’Np or ??°Np and evaluating thz recovery of the
spike. An alpha pulse height analysis may be necessary

if large amounts of Pu are initially present in the sample.

methyl isobutyl ketone and thenoyltrifluoroa:etone (TTA) extractants.
Np is oxidized to the hexavalent state and quantitatively extracted
as a nitrate complex into methyl isobutyl ke:one from an acid-
deficient A1(NOs)3 solution containing tetrapropylammonium nitrate.
Np is stripped from the ketone with 1M HCl containing reductants
and then quantitatively extracted into TTA-xrlene to complete the

separation.

re
.

Extraction from acid-deficient A1(NO;}3; with methyl
isobutyl ketone yields very good separation from Zr, and
extraction with TTA gives good separation from Pu and U.
The extraction of U and Pu is <0.1 and 0.01%, respectively.
Ru and Zr, the only 80-day cooled fission products that

H. Wehner, S. Al-Murab, and M. Stoeppler?3?
Introduction
This procedure describes extraction chr>matographic separa-
tion of 2°°Np from fission and activation products after neutron
irradiation. The system is Poropak-Q resin impregnated with
TTA-xylene. It is suggested that radioactive samples are more
easily analyzed with extraction chromatography than with TTA

extraction.

Raagents
® Poropak-Q resin, 100 to 120 mesh
® 0.4M TTA in xylene (small amount of n-pentane added)
eo 2M HCl
eo IM FeCl,
® 3M NH20H<HC1

e 10M HNO

Procedure

1. Dissolve sample in 2M HCl or convert to chloride with
HCl.

2. Add 3 ml of freshly prepared IM Fe(l, and 4 ml of 3M
NH,0H*HC1 mix, and let stand for 1% min.

3. Transfer the adjusted solution to & column (S cm long and
0.6 cm 1.D.) of Poropak Q impregrated with TTA-xylene
at v1 ml/(ca?-min).

When the feed has passed through the cclumn, wash with
2 ml of IM HCl and then a few drops of distilled water.

Discard the effluents.

5S. Pass 5 ml of 10M HNOsy through tho column to strip the Np.

6. Count the HNO; solution containing the 2*°Np immediately
after separation with a 3 x 3 in. NaI(TL) detector con-
nected to a S12-channel pulse-he:ight analyzer and evaluate
the 0.106-MeV photopeak.

Notes

1.

The method was suggested for determining low concentra-
tions of U by irradiating a standard sample of known U
content at the same time as the unknown and then deter-
mining the 27°Np content of both samples. A sensitivity
of 1 ug of U was determined for a <1 hour irradiation,
at a thermal neutron flux of 2 x 10!? n/cm?-sec with a
cooling period of “20 hours. With a longer irradiation,

a detection limit of 0.5 ug is suggested.

Outline of Method

This method separates Np from Pu, U, An, Cm, and fission
products by anion exchange in HNO solutions to permit #%"Np
estimation by gamma spectrometry. The sample is spiked with 2%%Np
tracer to permit yield corrections and loaded onto a small column
of '"Dowex' 1-X4 (100 to 200 mesh) resin from 8M HNO; containing
Fe (NH2S03)2 and semicarbazide. After washing with 30 to 40 column
volumes of 4.5M HNO, containing Fe(NH2SO4); and semicarbazide, the
Np is eluted with dilute HNOy containing 0,005M Ce(SOs)2. Np
recovery is “95% with a Pu decontamination factor of 5 x 10".
Decontamination factors from U, Am, Cm, and gross fission products
are all >10". Uranium at concentrations up to 180 g/& in the feed
does not interfere. The Pu decontamination factor can be increased
10 to 100 by following the HNO3 wash with 12M HCl - 0.1M NH.I.
Np is then eluted with 6.5M HCl - 0.004M HF. The method is appli-

cable to samples containing high salt concentrations.

F. Nelson, D. C. Michelson, and J. H. Holloway*??

Cutline of Method

This method utilizes anion exchange .n HCl for separating
U, Np, and Pu from '""1-n-adsorbable" elements which include alkali
metals, alkaline earths, trivsl=it actiiides, rare earths, and a

number of other elements such as Al, Sc, Y, Ac, Th, and Ni.

Sorption of the uranides by anion exchangers from HCl
solutions can occur in either the +4 or +6 oxidation states but
not in the +3 or +5 states. In this procedure, U is sorbed as
+6, while Np and Pu are sorbed in the +{ oxidation state. Pu is
selectively reduced to Pu(III) and elutad, while U%* and Np“*
remain sorbed. The latter are then eluted in separate portions

Procedure 13. Separation of Np and Pu by Anion Exchange
N. Jackson and J. F., Short"?

Outline of Method

This procedure describes separation of macro amounts of Pu
and Np. It is based on the fact that Pu(II1) is not sorbed on
anion exchange resin, while Np(IV) is strongly sorbed at high
HCl concentrations. The valence adjustment is done before sorp-
tion on the column by dissolving the hydroxides in a concentrated
HCl solution that has been saturated with NH,I. The Np is removed
from the column with 2 M HCl. The separation is quantitative and

complete.

Procedure

The purification of 2.3 g of Np??’ from approximately 50 mg
of Pu??? was then undertaken. The Np and Pu were precipitated as
hydroxides, centrifuged, and dissolved in 210 ml of concentrated
HCl saturated with NH I. The solution was allowed to stand for
30 min and poured onto a Deacidite FF*anion column 20 cm long and
2.5 cm diameter, while a flow rate of 1 ml/min was maintained.
The first 200 ml of effluent were pale blue [Pu(IIl)]. The column
was then washed with 100 ml of concentrated HCl, and wash was
collected separately. No activity was found in a drop collected

at the end of the washing,

The Np was eluted with 2M HCl. It was possible to follow the
dark green band of the Np down the column, and the first 4C ml of

eluate was included with the concentrated HCl wash. All the Np

*Deacidite is supplied by Permutit Co. Ltd., England.

was collected in the next 50 ml of eluate. No activity was found
in any eluate after this stage. Some f.-y activity was detected
on the glass wool at the top of the resin column and was assumed

to be 2?'Pa, the daughter of Np2?'’,

Procedure 16. The Low-Level Radiochemical Determination of 237Np
In Environmental Samples

R. W. Taylor?S?
Introduction
Np, along with Pu and U, is removed frcm 8M HCl by anion
exchange to triisooctylamine (TIOA). Each element can be indi-
vidually removed from the TIOA. Pu is stripped first with 8M
HCl - 0.05M NHyI. Np 1s removed next with 4M HC1 - 0.05M HF,

and U is removed last with 0.5M HNO,.

Most environmental sampies contain large quantities of Fe
that will extract with the actinide elements into TIOA., Much of
the Fe will be stripped from the TIOA alcng with Np, but it is
easily removed from 8 M HCl vy isopropyl ether. If the sample
is known to contain no Fe, the ether extraction step may be

omitted.

Final decontamination of Np is accomplished by solid ion
exchange. Np is finally electrodepositec for radioassay by alpha

pulse height analysis.

When the sample contains large quantities of U, some of it
may follow the Np and be electrodepositec. on the plate. ?’‘U and
2378p have the same alpha energy (4.75 MeV) and cannot be distin-
guished from one another. The Np can be converted to *Pu by
neutron irradiation for verification of ‘’’Np. Also, when the Np
activity is very low, conversion to 2''pu will decrease the counting
time. Two-hour irradiations at a flux of 1 x 10’? n/(cm?-sec)

result in a 2?%Pu activity level about 7 to 10 times greater thsn

Transfer the sample to a 500-ml separatory funnel. Add

an amount of 10% TIOA equal to one-fourth the amount of

the original sample. Shake the funnel for one minute.

Allow the phases to separate, and drain the bottom (aqueous)

phase. Retain for other analyses.

Add 10 to 20 ml 8M HCl (according to volume of original
sample) and shake one minute. Allow phases to separate,

drain, and discard the aqueous.

To strip Pu from the TIOA, add to the separatory funnel
an amount of 8M HC1 - 0.0°M NH,1 equal to one-half the
volume of TIOA. Shake one minute and then allow phases
to separate. Drain the aqueous and retain for Pu

analysis. Repeat the Pu strip with a fresh portion of
8M HC1 - 0.05M Nidyi. Combine the two strips, and save

for Pu analysis.

To remove Np from the TIOA, add to the separatsry funnel
an amount of 4M HCl - 0.05M HF »=»qual to one-half the
volume of TIOA and shake for on? minute. Allow the
phases to separate, and drain the aqieous which contains
Np. Repeat the strip with a fresh portion of 41! HCl -

stripped from the TIOA with 0.51 HNO.)

Add an equal amount of 12M HC] to the combined strips,
and transfer to a clean separatory funnel. Add 25 ml
isopropyl ether and shake one minute. (CAUTION: Vent
the separatory funnel frequently while shaking.) Drain
the aqueous, and retain. Discard the ether in accordance
with safety regulations. Repeat the ether extraction
with a fresh portion of ether.

Dissolve the sample in 10 ml of 8M HCl and pass through
a "Dowex'' 2-X8, 200 to 400 mesh, anion exchange column.
The resin bed should be 50 mm long and 6 mm in diameter;
it must be pre-conditioned with 5 ml of 8M HCl. After
the sample passes through the column, pass an additional
S ml of 8M HCl through it. Elute the Np from the column
with 10 m1 of O.1M HCl. Evaporate to dryness.

Add 2 ml of 16M HNOj to the sample, and evaporate to
dryness. Repeat the HNO, evaporation. Add 2 ml IM HNO,
to the sample, and heat gently to ensure dissolution.
Cool, and transfer the sample to an electrodeposition
cell. Rinse the beaker twice with 2 ml of distilled
water, and transfer the rinse to the cell. Add 2 ml of
1.5M NH,OH to the cell, and add distilled water until
the cell is full.

Electrodeposit the sample at 10 V and about 200 mamp for
three hours. Maintain the pH of the solution between

1 and 3 during electrodeposition. A: the end of the
electrodeposition period, add 1 ml of 12M KOH and plate
for 1 min. Empty the cell, rinse with distilled water
and remove the plate. Dry the plate and flame it.

Count the plate by alpha pulse height: analysis. If
there is no U present and if there is sufficient 2’'Np
present, radinassay can be accomplished directly. In
the presence of U or when there is very little "wp
present, increased sensitivity can be achieved by con-
version of 2*’Np to 2'°Pu by neutron irradiation. The
absence of 2'"Pu is verified by the initial count.

Irradiate the Np sample for approximstely two hours at
a flux of 1 x 10"? n/(ce®-sec). Allww the plate to

if necessary. Calculate the amount of Np present before
irradiation from the activation formula.

Procedure 18. Determination of Np in Urine
F. E. Butler?’

Outline of Method

Urine is wet ashed with HNO; and H;0; to destroy organic
matter. The salts are dissolved in 8M HCl and extracted with
TIOA (tri-isooctylamine). The Np is then back extracted, and
the alpha activity is determined by direct planchetting and

counting on low background solid-state counters.

A variation of the procedure provides for sequential deter-
mination of actinides in biological and environmental samples.
Pu, Np, and U are extracted from 8M HCl to TIOA. The residual
8M HCl containing Th, Am, Cm, Bk, Cf, and Es are extracted from
i2M HNO; to DDCP (dibutyl N, N-diethylcarbamyl phosphonate). The
actinides of interest are back-extracted sequentially for quanta-

tive determinations.

Preparation of Sample

Urine collected in polethylene bottles is transferred to an
Erlenmeyer flask with concentrated HNO; (20) ml of acid per liter).
Acid is added to the urine in the polyethylene bottle to remove

Procedur2 19. Determination of 2%’MNp by Gamma Ray Spectrometry
W. 0. Granade?3?

Introduction

A gamma spectrometric method was developed that allows for
the rapid determination of Np in process solitions containing
fission products. The method is unaffected ty highly salted,

217

corrosive, or organic media. Np is determined by gamma

spectrometry using a thin lithium-drifted germanium [Ge(Li)] semi-

conductor detector to resolve the 86.6-keV 2?“Np gamma ray.

Apparatus

The detector system consists of an Ortec model 3113-10200,
low-energy photon detector with cooled FET przamp and a resolution
of 900-keV full width at half maximum (FWHM) at 86.6-keV. A
4096-channel pulse height analyzer is used for the sccumulation
and storage of the gamma spectra. The data are read onto magnetic
tape or printed out directly from a high-speed digital printer.
Datz reduction is performed using an IBM 360.s5ystem and FORTRAN
programs developed to calculate nuclide abundances from multi-

channel gamma ray spectra.’

Procedure

Calibration. 233Pa, the daughter of 237p, has a 0.017
abundant gamma ray at 86.6-keV that interfere: with the mcasure-
ment of the 2?’Np gamma ray of the same energy. 22’Pa also has
a 0.34 abundant gamma ray at 311.9-keV that ir not associated with

a 2?’Np gamma ray. In order to determine the 23°Pa contribution

- 189 -
to the 86.6-keV 237Np photopeak, a pure stancard solution of

233p3 is required. ??%Pa is purified by passing an equilibrium
solution of 2?%Pa-2?’Np through a diatomaceoLs earth column which
sorbs 2%%a. The 2%%a is eluted, and the 2:7Np contaminant level
is determined by alpha counting (???Pa does not decay by alpha
emission). Aliquots of ???Pa are pipetted into a standard gamma
counting geometry. A series of counts of the 2?3Pa are made to
determine the ratio of gamma counts at the 8t.6-keV peak to counts
at the 311.9-keV peak. The ratio is used to calculate the 2?3Pa

contribution to the total counts detected at the 86.6-keV peak.

The efficiency of the Ge(Li) detector for 86.6-keV gamma
rays is determined by calibration with known gamma standards

between 43.5 and 511.6-keV.

Arnaiysis

The standards and sample are counted in a holder which ensures
a reproducible geometry at 2 cm. The deadtime correction (always
<20%) was found to be accurate to <1%. The gain setting of the
amplifier is adjusted to provide a peak width of 7 to 10 channels
(FWiiM) to allow reliable integration of the photopeak area. For
a Gaussian distribution, 99% of a peak area is contained in 2.1 x
FwliM. Therefore a peak area of 24 channels is used with a gain

setting giving 10 channels FWHM.

The net counts per minute of *3’Np is calculated by subtracting

the Compton background and the 2??Pa contribution from the 86.6-keV

- 190 -
total photopeak area. The contribution of underlying Compton
background is assumed to be linear over the peak arca. An
average of the counts from 4 channels on each side of the peak

is used to determine the background correction. For an analysis
above the determination limit (the relative standard deviation is
less than 10% of the measured value), the peak area minus the

background should be greater than?:

i
Bkg. Sur
50 {i . L . =A }

The absolute disintegration per minute value of °'’

Np is
obtained by dividing the net counts per minute by the product of
the gamma ray abundance (photon/disintegration) and the detector

efficiency at 86.6-keV.

A comparison of 217p results obtainrd by gamma spectrometry
and TTA extraction’ agreed within 3%. An aliquot of 1.06 x 10°
alpha dis/(min-ml) 2?’Np standard solution was extracted using
TTA. A standard geometry sample was made from the TTA [orpanic)
phase and one from the aqueous phase. The resulting gamma count-
ing showed that 97% of the 2’’Np had been extracted into the TTA
phase. Close agreement between the two methods demonstrated the
reliability of the gamma pulse height analysis. Samples can be
counted in organic media with no adverse effects. A lower limit
of detection of 1 x 10" d/m/ml at a confidence level of 95% was
determined from a series of counts using :z diluted standard ?°7Np

solution.

Procedure 20, Spectrophotometric Determination of Np
R. G. Bryan and G. R. Waterbury???

Outline of Method

Np is measured spectrophotometrically as the arsenazo [II
complex after separation from Pu and impurity elements by liquid-
liquid extraction. U is removed first by extraction from 4M HCl
into triisooctyl amine (TIOA)}-carbon tetrachloride, while Np(IV)
and Pu(IIl) are stabilized in their nonex:ractable oxidation
states by Fe(II) and ascorbic acid. Then Np(IV) is extracted
from 8M HCl into TIOA and back-extracted into 0.1M HCl. The
Np-arsenazo Ill complex is formed in 6.1M HCl, and the absorbance

is measured at a wavelength of 665 nm.

Reagents

® Arsenazo III, 0.2% [i,8-dihydroxynapthalene -3, 6-disulfonic

matched fused-silica cells having l-cm light paths.

Pretreatment
The sample of metal or alloy is inspected, and extraneous

material is removed. Cutting oil is removed by washing with methyl
chloroform. For each Pu metal sample, take two accurately weighed
portions, each not greater than 200 mg and containing less than

60 ug of Np. Make duplicate determinations on each sample, on a
solution containing a known quantity of Np, and on the reagent

blank solution.

Procedure

1.

10.

Place each accurately weighed sample in a glass extractor
and add 1.5 ml of 12M HCl. When the sample has dissolved,

add 1 ml of the reducing solution and 2.5 ml of water.

Prepare reagent blank solutions by adding 1 ml of reduc-

ing solution and 4 ml of 4M HCl to each of two extractors.

Prepare known Np solutions by adding an aliquot of

standard Np solution that contains an amount of Np
approximately equal to that expected in the sample and

1 ml of reducing solution to each of two extractors. Dilute

the solutions to 5 ml with 4M HCl.

Add 5 ml of TIOA-CCl, to cach of the solutions prepared
in previous steps, mix the phases for 2 min, and then

allow the phases to separate for 1 min.
Separate the TIOA-CCl. layer and discard.
Repeat Steps 4 and 5.

Add S ml of 12M HCl and 10 ml of TIOA-xylene to each
extractor, mix the phases for 3 min and allow the phases
to separate for |! min. Remove the aqueous phase con-

taining the Pu.

Wash the inside of the extractor with 5% ascorbic
acid-8M HCl, mix the phases for 2 min, and allow the

phases to separate for 1 min. Remove the aqueous phase.

Wash the inside of the extractor with 8M HCl. Mix the
phases for 2 min, and allow to separate for 1 min.

Remove the aqueous phase.

Add 4 ml of 0.1M HCl to each extractor. Mix the phases

- 195 -
11. Remove the aqueous phase into a 25-ml volumetric flask
containing 0.6 ml of H3PO,, 1 ml of 5% ascorbic acid-
8M HCl, and 12.7 ml of 12M HCl.

12. Repeat Steps 10 and 11.

13. Add 2.5 ml of 0.2% Arsenaz> III solution to the volumetric
flask, and dilute to 25 ml with water. Stopper and mix
the contents of the f ask.

14. Measure the absorbance of the solution in cells having

l-cm light paths at a wavelength of 665 nm.

As = absorbance of unknown sample

Wk = ug of Np in known Np solution

Relative standard deviations range between 7.2 and 1.1% in
measuring 8.5 to 330 ppm of Np in 200 mg samples. Of 45 elements
tested only Pd, Th, U, and Zr cause serious interference, but
only if present in concentrations greater than 0.8% However,
initial extraction from 4M }CI into TIOA removes some U, and Th
is not significantly extracted from HC. solution. Also, HPO,
complexes up to 1 mg of Zr without affecting the analysis. HF
and HNO, cause low results unless removed by volatilization. The
method tolerates the intense radioactivity from quantities of

238py; as large as 100 mg.

1 to 2 drops of 0.1% xylenol orange.

Titrate with 2 x 103M EDTA fron a microburet until the

color changes from rose to brigit yellow,

Notes

1.

HCl solutions are preferred in order to reduce all the
Np to the tetravalcent state with NH0H°HCI. Ascorbic
acid is not suitable, since its decomposition products

interfere with the titration.

Doubly charged readily hydrolyzable ions (Mn**, Ni2*,
U0,2*), which do not interfere with the titration, are

used as carriers.

Np can be determined with an error of 20.03 mg in the
presence of large amounts of alkali, alkaline earth, and
rare carths elements, Mn2*, zn2*, Cd?*, Pb?*, Cr?* (up

to 20 mg), Ni?*, Co?’ and U022*. Anions which are
scparated by strong base precipitation include NO,~,
(H1C00™, S042”, C2042", Cr,0,2-, and EDTA“. Pu is reduced
to Pu(III) and does not interfere up to 2 mg. Zr"*, Th**,

and Fe? interfere because they are cotitrated with Np(1V).

5. Dilute to exactly 4 ml with water, and mix thoroughly.

6. Measure the absorbance in a 1 cm cell at 430 or 370 nm

realtive to a blank.

7. Determine the Np content using a calibration curve.

~ 199 -
Notes

1.

Np(V), but not Np(IV) or Nu(VI), gives a color reaction
with H-0,.

The stability of the colored Np(V) peroxide complex
increases as the pH is increased. In 0.IM NaOH solution,

the absorbance remrins unchanged for two hours.

Increasing the H,0, concentratiol to >7 x 10” 2M does not
change the absorbance. At higher H;02 concentrations,

the time for constant absorbance increases.

When the solution contains U, 7 to 10 mg of (NH4)2HPO,
is added before the NaOH. Greatar amounts of the phosphate
reduce absorbance of the Np(V) complex.

Fluoride reduces the absorbance of the Np(V) peroxide
complex. Tartrate, carbonate, and sulfate ions to 0.1M
have no effect. When iron is present, Fe(OH).; precipitates
and is removed by centrifugation. Up to 300-fold amounts
of Fe do not interfere. Four-fo.!d amounts of Pu do not

interfere.

Procedure 25. Analysis for Np by Controlled Potential Coulometry
R. W. Stromatt?!?

Introduction

Controlled potential coulometry is uceful for detecting as
little as 2 ug of Np, and 7 ug can be determined with 6% standard
deviation. The general procedure is to first oxidize all the Np
to Np(VI) with Ce(IV), then the Np(VI) and excess Ce(IV) are
electrolytically reduced to Np(V) and Ce(l111). Finally the Np(V)

is coulometrically oxidized to Np(VI) to determine the concentration

of Np.

Reagents and Equipment

IM H3S50,

Mercury metal

Mercuric sulfate

Pure helium gas

Sodium silicate solution

Controlled potential coulcmeter

Titration cell (working electrode Pt gauze, isolated
electrode Pt wire and saturated calomel

reference)

Procedure

1. Add the Np sample and the titration medium into the cell,
and adjust the hydrogen ion and sulfate ion concentrations
to VIN. (The hydrogen ion concertration is not critical
between 0.4 to 2N but the electrode potential of the
Np(V/V1) couple is affected by the sulfate concentration).

2. Add Ce(1V) solution untii there is an excess as evidenced

by a persistent color.

- 206 -
De-aerate the solution with He for 5 min. (If during
this time the excess Ce(IV) has reacted, add additional

Ce(IV)].

Apply the potential to reduce the wp(Vl) and excess
Ce(IV) to Np(V) and Ce(l1l) until the current becomes

constant.

Apply the potential to oxidize the Np(V) to Np(\I).

The oxidation is continued until a constant current is
obtained. Make several readings of the integrated
current, and extrapolate the integrated current curve to

zero time.

Prepare a blank solution containing the same amount of

Ce(1V), and after 5 min of de-aeration perform reduction
and oxidation titrations at the same potentials as uscd
for the Np titration. After constant current is reached
for oxidation, read the integratec¢ current several times

and extrapolate to Zero time.

Subtract the zero-time integrated current of the blank

from that for the Np titration, ard calculate the amount

of Np based on the instrument calibration. (lor highest
accuracy, the Np lost in the de-acration and from migration

in the cell are taken into account.)

Notes

1.

The Np(V)/ (V1) couple can be titrated quantitatively and
reversibly in HNO,, 1iC10,, and H;50,; however, more
reproducible results are obtained with 11;50.,. Also, the
potentials of the Pu(I1I)/(1V) and Np(V}/(VI) couples are
separated better in 1{;S0..

- 207 -
Ce(IV) ion is used for oxidation because oxidation of
Np is rapid and quantitative, and Pu(lV) is not oxidized

significantly in H,;SO0,.

Coulometric titrations in solutions containing organic

contaminants are often slow and yield low values.

The concentration of Np in the different oxidation
states can be made using the Pt electrode cell. The
Np(V)/ (V1) couple can be titrated without interference
from oxidation of Np(IV).

Np(VI) is determined by coulometric reduction to Np(V).
The Np(V) is then oxidized coulcmetrically, and the
difference between these two titrations is the Np(V)
initially present. The total Np concentration is deter-
mined as previously discussed, and Np(IV) is calculated
from the difference between the concentrations of Np(V)
plus Np(VI) and the total Np.

Propst’'® has reported a coulometric method for Np
utilizing a conducting glass electrode in a thin-layer
clectrochemical cell. Organic contamirants interfered

and were removed by a bisulfate fusion procedure.
