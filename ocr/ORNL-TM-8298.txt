THERMAL CONVECTION LOOP STUDY OF THE CORROSION OF Fe-Ni-Cr
ALLOYS BY MOLTEN NaNO3—-KNO3*

P. F. Tortorelll and J. H. DeVan
ABSTRACT

We studied the corrosion of Fe-Ni-Cr alloys by draw salt
(60 wt Z NaNO3;—40 wt Z KNO3) with thermal convection loops of

alloy 800 and types 304L and 316 stainless steel. The main
corrosion processes at 600°C and below were the growth of thin
oxide scales and the dissolution of chromium by the salt.
Spallation of oxide layers occurred on type 304 stainless steel
specimens at intermediate temperatures. Results indicated rela-
tively low corrosion rates (<13 ym/year in most cases) for tem-—

 

peratures of 600°C and less. Corrosion of type 316 stainless N
steel was greatly accelerated when the maximum loop temperature A
was raised to 620°C. Tt therefore appears that 600°C may be the 5
limiting temperature for use of the above alloys In draw salt. Be

INTRODUCTION

A mixture of 60 wt I NaNO3~—40 wt 7 KNO3 (draw salt) has been

proposed! for use in solar thermal power systems as both a solar receiver

working fluid and a thermal energy storage medium. Draw salt is attrac-

tive for such applications because of its high sensible heat capacity, its

low reactivity in the event of a ieak to air or steam, and the low

operating pressures required for its use. However, the feasibility of

such a system depends partly on the compatibility of the salt with can-
didate structural alloys. The subject experiments were therefore per-
formed in closed-loop systems to study the corrosion of alloy 800 and

types 304 and 316 stainless steel by slowly flowing NaNO3;-KNOj under an

impressed temperature gradient. Previous work? with a nitrate-nitrite

[49 NaNO3;-44 KNO3-7 NaNO, (wt 2)] salt revealed unacceptably high corrosion

rates of type 316 stainless steel at 550°C. The study presents comparable

data for a pure nitrate salt system.

*Research performed under subcontract with Sandia National
Laboratory, Livermore, California, per purchase agieement 92-8568, spon-
sored by the U.S. Departuent of Energy, Division of Energy Storage Systems.

 
   

The tests reported here are companion experiments to those conducted
at Sandia National Laboratory.3® The Sandia experiments were matched
to our experiments in terms of loop materials, specimens, and temperature
conditions. However, the Sandia experiments operated under air, while
ours were sealed, the cover gas being composed of salt decomposition

products.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

The as-received draw salt, with a nominal composition of 60 wt Z%
NaNO3;—40 wt Z XNO3* and a melting point of 221°C, was outgassed in a
closed type 304 stainless steel vessel ar 250 to 300°C while simul-
taneously being purged by argon flowing above and through the salt. A
significant amount of water vapor was removed in thls way. Subsequently,
this pot of salt was used to fill three thermal convection loops (TCLs) of
the type shown schematically in Fig. 1. Natural circulation of the salt
was induced in these closed loops by controlling the loop's temperature
profile to produce convective tlow. Each of the three loops was con-
structed of different alloys: types 304L and 316 stainless steel and
alloy 800 (Table 1). The loops were designed to permit the insertion and
removal of corrosion coupons and salt samples with minimal disruption of
the salt flow. In this way, changes in salt composition, specimen
weight, and microstructure were monitored as functions of exposure time.
Tubing for the loops ranged from 1.9 to 2.5 cm in outside diameter and
from 0.2 to 0.3 cm in wall thickness. Insert coupons were approximately
1.9 x 0.8 x 0.1 cm and were in the as—-annealed condition (unpolished). In
any given loop, the insert specimens and tubing were of the same nominal
compositions, although, in the case of the type 304L stainless steel loop,
specimens of bot": normai- and low-carbon grades were exposed. In each
TCL, the pressure above the salt rapidly increased to above 6.9 x 10% Pa,
gage (10 psig) when the temperature was initially raised above about

Subsequently, care was taken to maintain this gas composition over the
loop salt by using only oxygen as a cover gas durin: specimen manipulation
and salt sampling. During most of our study the three TCLs operated with

maximum temperatures and temperature differentials ATs of about 600 and

225°C, respectively. The AT was established by first setting the minimum
temperature at the bottom of the cold leg and then increasing the output
of the heaters along the hot leg to achieve a maximum temperature of 600°C
just below the bottom of the hot-leg surge tank (Fig. 1). Typical
temperature profiles for each of the three TCLs are shown in Fig. 2. The
nominal salt velocity was 4 mm/s. After 5300 h of coupon exposure, the

AT of the type 316 stainless steel TCL was changed to 150°C, and its
maximum temperature was maintained at 600°C to assess any changes in
behavior due to mass transfer effects (see below). This temperature pro-
file 1s also shown in Fig. 2.

Before weighing, the loop specimens were cleaned with water after each
exposure to flowing salt. After 1500 and 4500 h of exposure, corners were
clipped from the specimens in each loop for metallographic examination.
Periodically, samples of salt from the respective loops were taken and
analyzed for Fe, Ni, Cr, Mo, NO,, and NO3. Total chromium and chromium(VI)
concentrations in the salt were measured spectrophotometrically,®:’ and
nickel and molybdenum levels were determined by the atomic absorption
spectroscopic graphite furnace technique. The salt samples were analyzed
for iron spectrophotometrically with the o-phenanthroline method.® The
nitrate concentrations were determined by a modified DeVarda method;® the

nitrite levels were measured volumetrically by titration with cerium(IV)

(ref. 10).

RESULTS

As previously discussed, the weights of the loop specimens were
measured as a function of exposure time. Such data are shown in Fig. 3
for the specimens at the two hottest coupon positions (H3 and H4) in the
alloy 800 TCL. Very little weight change occurred. Similar behavior was
found for specimens in these positions in the type 304L stainless steel
loop, which contained both types 304 and 304L stainless steel at the 600°C
(H3) position (Fig. 4). Equivalent weight change data for the type 316
stainless steel loop are shown in Fig. 5. As with the other two loops,
the weight changes of the H3 (595°C) specimen were small. However, the
weight of the H4 (565°C) specimen steadily decreased during the initial
3000 h of exposure to the salt, after which it became approximately

constant. Changing the AT of the type 316 stainless steel loop from 225
to 150°C after 5000 h of coupon exposure had little effect on the weight
changes, but raising the maximum loop temperature to 620°C after 6000 h
resulted in the onset of significant weight-loss rates.

As noted, the weight change data in Figs. 3 through 5 are for only
two of the coupon positions in each of the TCLs. The data for all loop
coupons are listed in the Appendix in Tables A.1 through A.3 (the location
of each specimen is shown in Fig. 1). With the exception of the type 316
stainless steel H4 coupon, the weight changes of all the specimens in the
alloy 800 and type 316 stainless steel loops were small. However,

significant weight gains were measured on certain coupons in the type 304L

 
stainless steel TCL. The weight gains were particularly high for several
ccupons In the lower half of the hot leg. These weight changes are
plotted as a function of exposure tire in Fig. 6. The decreases in weight
et longer times appeared to be related to spallation.

Metallographic specimens were obtained by clipping corners from the
loop coupons after 1500 and 4500 h of exposure to NaX03-KNO3. Polished
cross sections of specimens exposed to the draw salt at the H3 and H4
positions In each of the loops are shown in Figs. 7 through 9. Each alloy
exhibited multilayered corrosion products at the higher temperatures. In
certain cases, but particularly in the case of types 304 and 304L stainless
steel, etching of these metallographic specimens increased the number of
apparent layer: that could be differentiated on a given specimen.

Examples of this can be seen by comparing the micrographs in Fig. 10 with
the associated ones in Figs. 8 and 9. Micrographs of specimens exposed at
other loop positions are shown in Figs. 11 through 14. Those in Fig. 14

are of the surfaces of the coupons that exhibited the larger weight gains

reported in Fig. 6. Note that the large weight gains are also reflected
in relatively thick reaction layers and that spallation of the layers
seems imminent. Tables A.4 through A.6 in the Appendix list the total
depth of the corrosion products x for each coupon as measured from the
respective micrographs.

High-resolution electron microprobe analysis allowed determination of
the chemical composition of the reaction zone of type 316 stainless steel
after 4500 h of exposure at 595°C. The results Indicated three layers of
different compositions, shown schematically in Fig. 15. The entire reac-
tion zone contained oxygen, and the individual layers comprising this zone
differed in their relative ratio of iron to chromium. The outermost layer
was depleted in chromium, but the underlying one was not. Finally, a thin
nickel-rich layer was observed at the corrosion product zone-base metal
interface.

The salt in each of the TCLs was periodically analyzed to determine
the extent and nature of corrosion product species; results are shown in
Table 2. (The sampling times in the table represent the number of hours
the salt circulated in a particular loop before analysis and, as such, do
not coincide with the coupon exposure times used in reporting the weight
change and microstructural results because of the periods in which the
coupons were out of the respective loops.) The data in the table clearly
show a general increase of chromium in the salt with increasing operating
time in all three loops. The concentrations of the other principal ele-
ments of the structural alloys did not differ appreciably from their
levels in the as-received salt. We are unsure of the reason for the occa-
sional, unusually high molybdenum concentration in the salt. Most prob-
ably the measurements are errcneous because we observed a decrease to a
“normal” concentration in the alloy 800 loop at a later sampling time. In
all the loops, the salt's nitrite ccncentration increased rapidly to about
1.9 wt Z but then increased more slowly.

As described in the experimental procedures section, the pressure
above the loop salt rapidly increased when the temperature was raised

above about 520°C. Analyzed samples of evolved gas were mainly oxygen.

These analyses are given in Table 3.

DISCUSSION

A substantial amount of gaseous oxygen rapidly evolved when the draw
salt in these closed loops was heated to sbove about 520°C. This behavior

is consistent with the decomposition reaction
XNO3 = XNO, + 1/2 0, , (1)

where X can be sodium or potassium. Such a reaction was reported
earlier for this salt.! As seen in Table 2, the measured nitrite con-
centrations in the salt increased in accordance with the decomposition
reaction and are in approximate agreement with those calculated with the
equilibrium constant for Eq. (1) (ref. 11) and the assumption that a mass
balance was maintained between nitrate and nitrite. Although metal oxida-
tion reactions were also occurring in the system, as evidenced by the
growth of oxide filas and the buildup of chromium fn the salt, it appears
that the above decomposition reaction controls the oxidation potential of
the system. This is consistent with the fact that the oxidation of the
metal is a small effect relative to the amount of salt in the loop and
therefore should not significantly affect salt chemistry.

As already discussed, metal oxidation processes were manifected by

the formation of surface reaction layers (Figs. 7-10) and in increased

 

 
20

levels of chromium in the draw salt, and microprobe examination of
exposed type 316 stainless steel (Fig. 5) indicated that significant
depletion of chromium from hotter loop surfaces also occurred. Both the
oxidation and depletion reactions are discussed in more detail below.

The weight chai:es reported in Tables A.1 through A.3 are not indica-
tive of the true corrosion rates. The measured weight change AV 1s
actually the difference between the weight of the reacted oxygen AW, and
the sum of the weights of the dissolved elements (principally chromium)

AWn and of the spalled material Ag:
AW = AW, — (AWp + AWG) . (2)

The weight of the oxygen acquired by a specimen AW, can be roughly calcu-
lated from the thickness of the oxide layer x (see Tables A.4-A.6):

Bp = (64.0/231.8) pp 0, X © , (3)

where the density of Fe30,, PFe 0, * was used to approximate that of the
composite oxide layer. The total weight of oxidized metal AWp is defined
as the weight of metal in both the oxide scale and molten salt. This
weight "loss™ is thus the sum of the weight of the dissolved elements AVp
and the weight of the reacted (oxidized) iron and chromium BWp(o)t

AW = AWp + AWM) » 4)

where
pio) = 0.72( Fre Py Xx + Ng) . (5)

When AWp is divided by the time of salt exposure, an average approximate
corrosion rate for the particular specimen is obtained. The values of AV;
can be obtained by substituting in Eq. (4) values of AWp and AWy(p)
obtained by use of Eqs. (2) and (5), respectively, and appropriate
measurements of AY and x from Tables A.l through A.6. For our case, we
will assume AV; = O because observation of possible epallation after 4500 h
of exposure was restricted to a very few specimens in one loop (specimens

H6 and H7 in the type 304L stainless steel TCL). With this assumption,

 
21

approximate values of the total weight of oxidized metal of each loop
specimen are listed in Tables A.7 through A.12. Measurements of the
weights of descaled specimens are in progress to determine the accuracy of
the above approach. Corrosion weight changes and rates obtained ir this
manner for the alloy 800 and type 316 stainless steel loops (Tables A.7—
A.10) are consistent with the expectation that oxidation kinetics, =ad
therefore total weight loss, should increase with {increasing temperature
(this 1s not the case for the uncorrected weight changes measured with
the oxide films intact). In contrast, the weight losses calculated for
specimens in the type 3J4L stainless steel loop after 4500 h of exposure
did not maximize at the highest loop temperature. In this case, relati-
vely large corrosion rates resulted at intermediate temperatures (see
Table A.12). The accelerated oxidation at these intermediate positions
was characterized by the presence of relatively thick and apparently
poorly adherent oxide films (Fig. 14). However, the actual corrosion
rates at these positions are somewhat less than those calculated because
the calculations assumed a 100% dense oxide film of the same thickness as
that of the observed porous film.

Regardless of possible inaccuracies in the determinations of AVp,
the weight change results shown in Tables A.7 through A.12 indicate that
the metal in the oxide film constitutes most of the metal loss and that
the total corrosion rates are relatively small. Figure 16 shows that the
oxide thicknesses on the alloys of this study are about an order of magni-
tude less than those expected for annealed type 304 stainless steel in
steam.1? The total weight losses after 4500 h in draw salt have been con-
verted into corrosion rates in the last column of Tables A.8, A.10, and
A.12 and indicate that, while the "worst case” corresponds to 25 jm/year
(1 mil/year), the corrosion rate is substantially less in most ceses. The
one potential concern in these tests was the nature of the oxide films on
type 304L stainless steel specimens at intermediate temperatures, where
spalling appeared imminent.

Although the exact neture of the metallographically distinct surface

layers on exposed specimens is not known, it appears that, in general, the

reaction zone at higher temperatures consists of an iron oxide (probably
Fe30,) with an underlying spinel! layer such as Fe(Fe,Cr),0,. This would
be consistent with the microprobe data and agrees with the results from a
study of the corrosion of type 304 stainless steel by thermally convective
draw salt.3 However, details revealed by optical metallography indicate a
more complex reaction zone than that just described. For example, a dark-
etching phase was sometimes observed optically at the salt-allov interface
[Fig. 10(a)], although this phase was not revealed by microprobe analysis.
The other three layers seen in Fig. 10(a) were distinct areas in the
microprobe analysis (Fig. 15). Another complicating factor is the multi-
tude of layers observed in the reaction zones of types 304 and 304L
stainless steel when their polished cross sections are etched (Fig. 10).
This variety of metallographically distinct structures was not observed

in another study of type 304 stainless steel,3 and the reason why so

many layers should develop on these alloys and not on the other materials

 
23

in this study 1s not obvious from compositional differences. Finally, the
micrographs of the higher temperature alloy 800 coupons indicated some
tendency for internal oxidation at the reaction zone-base metal interface
[Fig. 7(a)], although longer term tests will be required to establish the
significance of this observation.

The observed increases in the chromium levels of the test salt in
each loop imply the formation of one or more chromium-containing species
that are soluble in NaNO3;-KNO;. Because most of the chromium in the salt
was in the +6 oxidation state (Table 2), Na,Cr,0,; and Na,Cr0, are probable
species. Changes in the chromium concentration of the draw salt as a
function of exposure time can also yield information about the chromium
depletion process. Assuming that, as discussed below, there is no deposi-
tion of chromium from the salt, the increase in the chromium concentrations
of the salt Cer(s) should subscribe to a half-power time dependence if
diffusion of chromium in the alloy or in the salt 1s rate controlling. A
linear time dependence would imply surface reaction control. Recent work?
on the corrosion of type 304 stainless steel in draw salt revealed a time
dependence of t0+* for Ccr(s). In agreement with other work 3,5 our data
generally indicate a continuing Increase in chromium levels of the salt
with time (Table 2) for the duration of the experiments. The chromium
concentration of the salt in the type 316 stainless steel TCL appeared to
approach a time-independent value after several thousand hours and then
increased again when the maximum loop temperature was increased. In no
case, however, was the time dependence of the chromium concentrations in
the salt greater than t0°5 for operation at a maximum temperature of
600°C; the best-fit exponent was always between 0.1 and 0.5. This would
thus indicate that a diffusional process involving chromium is the rate-
controlling step. Accordingly, the concentrations are plotted versus the
square root of exposure time in Fig. 17.

One possible corrosion effect is the movement of surface at: “ne
test alloys from hot to cold regions of the loop via convection -

salt phase. This phenomenon of thermal gradient mass transport

observed in other molten salt systems (principally hydroxides or fluorides)
subjected to a thermal gradient.!3 The transport mechanism can involve
oxidation and dissolution of reactive metals as corrosion products in the
hot zone with subsequent reduction and deposition of the metals in the
cold zone. Our tests indicate that an oxidation reaction operates to
dissolve chromium in the salt; however, the weight change data gave no
evidence that the reaction leads to a net transport of chromium from hot
to cold regions. There was also no evidence of cold-leg deposits in
visual or metallographic examinations of cold-leg specimens. Furthermore,
changes in the AT of the type 316 stainless steel loop did not signifi-
cantly affect the measured weight changes (Fig. 5). Thus, our results are
encouraging in that thermal gradient mass transport will not be a signifi-
cant operational problem in draw salt systems up to 600°C.

This study indicates two principal corrosion reactions resulting from
exposure of Fe-Ni-Cr alloys to NaNO3-KNO3: the solid-state oxidation of

the exposed alloys and the selective dissolution of chromium from the

matrix. As such, our results agree with those reported3:" for similar
alloys exposed to NaNO3;-KNO3 in TCLs that were open to air. Spallation
was not extensive, and intergranular attack was not observed.

The results of this study indicate that alloy 800 and types 304,
304L, and 316 stainless steel have low corrosion rates in thermally con-
vective NaNO3-KNOj3 at a maximum temperature of 600°C. Under such con-
ditions, the greatest metal loss rate corresponded to 25 ym/year, but in
most cases the rate was less than 13 ym/year. These latter rates are
somewhat smaller than those reported for similar loops operated with the
salt exposed to the atmosphere3s> but are within a factor of 2 to 5.
Significant metal oxidation was observed only at Intermediate temperatures
in the type 304L stainless steel TCL after 5000 h of salt exposure (Fig. 6),
but the overall rate did not exceed 25 jm/year. Raising the maximum loop
temperature to 620°C resulted in much greater corrosion rates for type 316
stainless steel (Fig. 5). This rapid acceleration of the corrosion pro-
cess was also observed in other studies of types 304 and 316 stainless
steel and alloy 800 in draw salt loops, 3»> where at 630°C significant
spalling of the oxide films on type 316 stainless steel was observed.’

Our results therefore confirm that 600°C probably represents an upper tem-

perature service limit for such alloys in NaNO;-KNOj3 (ref. 5).
SUMMARY

Alloy 800 and types 304, 304L, and 316 stainless steel were exposed
to thermally convective NaN0O3;-KNO3 draw salt at 375 to 600°C for more
than 4500 h. The exposure resulted in the growth of thin oxide films on
all alloys and the dissolution of chromium by the salt. The weight change
data for the alloys indicated that (1) the metal in the oxide film consti-
tuted most of the metal loss; (2) the corrosion rate, in general, increased
with temperature; and (3) although the greatest metal loss corresponded
to a penetration rate of 25 ym/year (1 mil/year), the rate was less than
13 ym/year in most cases. Spallation had a sfgrificant effect on metal
loss at intermediate temperatures in the type 304L stainless steel loop.

Metallographic examinations showed no evidence of intergranular attack

 
 

26

or of significant cold-leg deposits. Weight change data further confirmed
the absence of thermal gradient mass transport processes in these draw
salt systems.

Raising the maximum temperature of the type 316 stainless steel loop
from 595 to 620°C dramatically increased the corrosion rate. It thus
appeared that 600°C may be the limiting temperature for use of such alloys

in draw salt.
