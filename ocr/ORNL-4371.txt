feasibility of substituting U for the

PREPARATION OF ENRICHING SALT T117-233yp, FOR REFUELING
THE MOLTEN SALT REACTOR

 

John M. Chandler 5S. E. Bolt
ABSTRACT

The Molten Salt Reactor has been refueled with an
enriching salt concentrate, TLiF-233ur), (73-27 mole %).
Sixty-three kilograms of this concentrate was prepared in
cell G of the Thorium-Uranium Recycle Facility at ORNL.
Its preparation in g shielded cell was required because of
the high 232y content (222 ppm) of the 233y.

In the shakedown run with depleted uranium oxide, a
high-temperature, single-step process was used to reduce
the oxide and then convert it to UFh for use in making the
eutectic salt. Although this process yielded a high-
quality product, severe damage to the equipment was ob-
served. Therefore, it was discarded in favor of a low-
temperature, two-step process in which the uranium oxide
was reduced to UO, by treatment with hydrogen, the UC,
was converted to UF) by hydrofluorination, LiF was added,
and the eutectic was formed by fusing the components. The
eutectic mixture, LiF-UF) (73-27 mole %), was purified by
treatment with hydrogen, which reduced the corrosion prod-
ucts to metal and subsequently allowed their removal by
filtration. The quality of the product was well within
the requirements established for the MSRE.

The fuel concentrate, containing 39.0 kg of uranium
(91.4% 233y), was packaged in nine variable-capacity
(0.5 to 7 kg of uranium) shipping containers for addition
to the reactor fuel drain tank and in 45 enrichment cap-
sules, each containing 96 g of uranium, for addition to
the bowl of the fuel circulating pump. The fuel was shipped
in shielded carriers to the MSRE to accommodate the reactor
enrichment schedule.

1. INTRODUCTION

In July 1966, an ad hoc committee was appointed to study the
233 235

U being used to fuel the

Molten Salt Reactor. It was the recommendation™ of this committee that

 

a charge of eutectic salt containing

the MSRE prior tc removal of the

233y be prepared for enriching

235

from the system.
ro

A single-step process, in which the fuel concentrate could be
prepared directly from #30, and LiF, in a single reaction vessel
located in a hot cell, was considered to be the simplest and most

economical appreach. Biological shielding would be recguired because

of the high 232; content (222 ppm) of the 233; feed material.

The required quantity and quality of the enriching concentrate

will permit operation of the MSRE at full power for at least one year.

This report summarizes the preliminary phases of the work —
development, design, and construction — as well as the actual operation
of the process used to prepare the Tyr -233um, (73-27 mole %) eutectic
salt.

2. CONSIDERATIONS FOR SUBSTITUTING 233y IN THE MSRE

2 35. .

The substitution of 33y for 235y in the MSRE had tc be considered
from three standpoints: (1) the nuclear characteristics of the 233y ’
system, (2) the chemistry of the circulating fuel, and (3) the preparation

233y 232y,

and handling of a salt containing

233

2.1 Nuclear Characteristics of the U System

An sesessments of the operation of the Molten Salt Reactor with
233y has indicated that the following could be learned by substituting

the new fuel charge:

(1) Critical loadings would provide a check on the available

233

nuclear data on U for predicting critical conditions in a
reactor with a neutron energy spectrum similar to that of the
proposed molten salt breeder reactor (MSER) .

(2) Measurement of 23M. 10.233 atom ratios over a pericd of sub-
stantial burnup might further evaluate available nuclear data

and czlculational methods.

(3) Interesting differences would be observed in the dynamics of

 

the reactor because of the smaller fraction of delayed neutrons
 

 

(OS)

233

ey
available from U fission. Stable operation with 233y in
the MSRE would tend to confirm tentative conclusions regarding

the dynamics of the MSER.

(4) Knowledge of the fission product yields for 233

U, as compared
with those for 23%y, would provide a means of more positively
identifying the resctivity transients that follow changes in

power levels.

(5) Changes in other nuclear characteristics, such as temperature
coefficients, neutron lifetime, and control rod worth, would

be observed.

2.2 Chemistry of the Circulating Fuel

The uranium concentration in the reactor will be reduced to 0.2
mole %s however, no significant increase in UF, concentration or precipi-

3

tation of uranium or Uo, is expected. Most of the properties of the new
fuel charge will be very similar to those of the 235y fuel. No change
is expected in the compatibility of the fuel with the graphite and the

Hastelloy HN.

2.3 Fuel Preparation by Remote Means

A strong incentive exists for developing an economical method for
reprocessing irradiated fuel for reuse in a power reactor. The high

232 233

U content of the U will make remote processing of a 233y fuel charge
mandatory. Therefore, it is desirable to prove the feasibility of a
simple, direct fuel recycle process without the necessity of high-level
decontamination; this would emphasize the advantages of the fuel

preparation for molten salt reactors.
3. PROCESS DEVELOPMENT

The preparation of the enriching salt, T1ar-#33ur, (73-27 mole %),
7

LiF and #0, by a direct high-temperature, one-step process, was

2
investigated” in the laboratory and found to yleld a satisfactory product.

from
However, during the cold run in Building 7930, the high temperatures
necessary for this process were found to promote corrosion of the equip-
ment; thus, an alternative method — a low-temperature, two-step process —

was adopted. These processes are discussed in detail in Sect. L.2.

3.1 High-Temperature, One-Step Process

The chemical procedures that were developed for the production of
the fuel concentrate were similar to those used in the routine prepara-
tion of UF), from oxides. Necessary modifications included: (1) the use
of a vertically mounted, cylindrical reaction vessel rather than trays
or Tluidized-bed reactors, (2) the addition of LiF to the initial charge
of material, and (3) the operation of the process at temperatures

sufficient to maintain the LiF in its molten state.

Iaboratory-scale experiments were conducted by the Reactor Chemistry
Division tc gain information about the rates at which the reactions would
occur and also to examine possible process control techniques. The

reactions investigated were:

Sintering: Helium atmosphere at 900°C
_ p
U0, — U0, + 0.2 0,
Reduction: Hydrogen at 900°C

Uo, 4 + C.6 H, — UO, + 0.6 EO

Hydrofluorinaticn: Ho-HF sparge at 900-550°C
uo, + LHF — UF), + ei,0

Reduction of impurities: Hydrogen sparge at T00°C
MF, + H, — M° + CHF
2 2
In the reduction step the progress of the reaction could be followed
by observing the generation of water vapor in the system. The temperature

of the gas effluent increased markedly during this period.

During the hydrofluorination treatment, hydrogen, along with anhy-
drous HF, was admitted to the reaction vessel to control the corrosion
of the vessel and also to ensure the complete reduction of U0 to Uo, -

The conversion step cf the process was carried out at temperatures

sufficiently high to keep all of the LiF in solution. Thus, as UF), was

 
 

 

produced, the liquidus temperature of the fluoride components decreased
from 845 to 490°C, the melting point of the eutectic mixture. In the
equipment used in the development runs, the liquidus temperature could
be measured and the UF), concentration could be determined by comparison
with the phase disgram. A final treatment of the melt with hydrogen at
700°C reduced the concentration of nickel and iron to acceptably low

levels.

Upon successful completion of the laboratory-scale experiment, a
cold run, using equipment that more closely resembled the production
equipment, was conducted by the Reactor Chemistry Division. This run
served to further confirm the feasibility of the one-step process and
also to train key personnel for the production operations at the

Thorium-Uranium Recycle Facility (TURF).

3.2 Low-Temperature, Two-Step Process

As an alternative to the high-temperature method, a two-step,
low-temperature process was evaluated in a laberatory experiment and
subsequently used in the salt production runs. In this process, which
is similar to that used to produce the original fuel salt for the MSRE,
the temperatures are generally much lower, and the LiF is not added
until the conversion of the oxide to the fluoride has been completed by

hydrofiuvorination.

4. DESCRIPTION CF SALT PRODUCTICN FACILITY

The processing equipment was installed in cell G of the TURF, which
is located in the Melton Valley area of Cek Ridge National Laboratory.
This facility contains shielded cells and process supporting systems

to permit remote fuel reprocessing.

4.1 Description of the TURF

The TURF, Building 7930, was constructed at Oak Ridge National

Laboratory to help develop and demonstrate economical remote methods
6

for reprocessing irradiated thorium-based fuel and for refabricating

the purified fertile and fissile material into fuel suitable for reuse
in a power reactor. The use of shielding and remote fabrication methods
will permit the use cof simplified processes yielding only modest decon-

tamination factors.

The TURF has sufficient space to accommodate equipment for process-
ing and fabricating two types of fuel assemblies simultaneously. The
facility is divided into four major areas: (1) an office area adjacent
to, but isolated from, areas that contain radioactivity, (2) an operating
area with a development laboratory, chemical makeup area, and equipment
rooms for service equipment, (3) a maintenance operating area with ser-
vice areas for receiving and storing spent fuels, and (4) a cell complex

containing seven hot cells (six shielded and one unshielded).

Included in the facility are the services, ventilation systems,
crane and manipulator systems, viewing systems, snd liquid and gaseous

waste disposal systems necessary to support fuel reprocessing.

L.1.1 Cell G

The 2334 fuel charge for the MSRE was prepared in cell G. The

interior of this cell is 20 ft wide, 16 ft long, and 30 ft high. A false
floor was installed to elevate the process equipment so that the through-
wall master-slave manipulators could be used and maximum advantage could
be taken of the viewing capabilities of the shielding windows. This
decreased the effective height of the cell to 22 ft, which, in reality,
was further reduced to 1k ft of effective headroom because of the in-
cell electreomechanical manipulator system space requirements at the top
of the cell. The walls, ceiling, and floor of the cell are lined with
stainless steel. Six cell operating modules (Fig. 1) are built into the
walls of the cell; four of these are equipped with viewing windows, and
two have window forms that are filled with removable shielding. There
are more than 100 penetrations into the cell for process services —

many more than are required for the salt preparation. The cell venti-

 

lation system normally maintains a pressure of =5 in. H,0 and a flow

of 1033 cfm of air through the cell; the vessel off-gas system removes

system that is maintained at a pressure of —17 in. HO. A small entry
port permits introduction of small tools and miscellaneous items Through
a glove box and sn alr lock. The rocf of the cell contains a hatch with
a 10- by 6-ft opening that is sealed and shielded. The hatch provides
access to the cell with the 50-ton building crane. Eight master-slave
manipulators were installed in the cell: four Central Research Model A
and four Central Research Model D units. A Program and Remote Systems
Model 3000 electromechanical manipulator system is mounted on rails to

give complete coverage of the cell.

4.1.2 Radioactive Hot Drain — Hot Off-Gas System (RHD-EOG)

 

The radioactive hot drain--hot off-gas system is a combination by-
product waste collection system and vessel off-gas system. It has inlet

connections in the hot cells and at various points throughout the facility.

The network of stainless steel piping is designed to handle gas
and liquid in concurrent flow. Liquid waste is separated from the off-
gas and 1s collected in tank B-2-T in the belcow-grade and shielded waste
tank pit. The gaseous stream flows through a bank of absolute filters
and then into the cell exhaust system located upstream of the filter
units for that system. The liquid wastes may be pumped either into the
Melton Valley waste system or into cell G for recovery of valuable

materials.

Two connections from cell G to the HOG system were made for the
salt preparation process. One connection was made to the capsule drill-
ing station in order to collect the particulate matter resulting from
the drilling operation. The other was made to a multipurpose manifold
station. With the HOG system pressure controlled at —17 in. H,0, the
flow of air from the cell was adjusted to 25 cfm by a manually operated
valve. The gaseous effluent from the process scrubbing system was dis-
charged into this manifold station, thereby ensuring dilution, in the

case of hydrogen, to less than the explosive limit. In addition to the

 

scrubber discharge, the manifold station served the in-cell titration

station, the sampling station, the can-opening bcx, the scrubber system
 

 

\O

and sink liquid drains, and all of the process vessels. Scme of these
connecticns were made to the manifold station on the cell side of the

manual flow regulating valve, where the pressure was —5 in. H_ 0; scme

2
vere made on the HOG system side of the valve, where the pressure was
—15 in. H_O. The location of each connection depended upon the pressure

requirement for that particular use.

4.1.3 Cell Ventilation

Approximately 1033 cfm of air enters cell G from the cell G pump
room via a series of filters, a fire damper, a back-flow preventer, and
a cell pressure control valve. It discharges into the cell from dif-
fusers that are mounted on the cell ceiling and then flows through
roughing filters located at the false floor (and also at the cell floor
level) into the cell ventilation system manifold in the north valve
pit. The flow is contrclled by a manually Zoaded valve in the exhaust
duct. The exhaust 1s routed to the filter pil, where it passes through
two sets of filters in series; from there, it passes through a 30-in. duct
to the centrifugal blowers and into the 250-ft HFIR stack for dispersion
into the atmosphere. The controls on the ventilation system maintain
a pressure of —5 in. HO in the cell under normal conditions. Pressures
as low as —20 in. H,0 or as high as =1 in. H,0 can be maintained in the
cell under certain emergency conditions. Only a failure cof all emer-
gency systems would allow the pressure in the cell to rise above ~C.5

in. H,0.

L.1.4 Shielding

The shielding of the TURF is designed in such a manner that, during
operation with radicactive material having an intensity of 10° r/hr,
the penetrating dose rates in normally occupled areas are no greater than
0.25 mrem/hr, with small hot spots no greater than 2.5 mrem/hr. Dose
rates greater than this are permitted in limited-access areas and for

short-term, non-routine cperations.
10

To satisfy the allowable design radiation levels, the operating
cells have 5-1/2-ft-thick walls of normal concrete up to a height of
11 ft, 4-1/2 ft of normal concrete for the remaining portions of the
vertical walls, and 5-ft-thick concrete on the roof. This amount of
biological shielding was more than adequate to reduce exposure dose

rates to < 0.1 mr/hr.

The windows are essentially equivalent, in shielding thickness and
in their attenuation of penetrating radiation, to the concrete walls
in which they are installed. Each window consists of two major assem-
blies: the seal glass that is removable from inside the cell, and the
tank unit that is remcvable from the operating face of the cell. Each
window is a composite unit consisting of 7 in. of glass and 58 in. of
zinc bromide solution; it is well sealed to minimize leakage of air

around its periphery.

4.1.5 Manipulators -

A Programmed and Remote Systems Model 3000 Manipulator System is
installed on a set of rails in cell G. The tube hoist on this manip-
ulator has a vertical travel cf 13-1/2 ft and a lifting capacity of 1000
1b. The trolley and bridge travel, along with the vertical travel of
the tube hoist, provides complete manipulator coverage of the cell down
tc the false floor. This unit provides all the motions of the human
arm, plus wrist extension and continuous rotation at the wrist and at
the shoulder. A grip force cof 200 1b can be exerted with the fingers.
The hand is remotely removable and can be replaced by a hook fixture or

an impact wrench.

One Central Research Model A master-slave manipulator and one
Model D master-slave manipulator are installed at each of the four
viewing windows in cell G. The Model A and the Model D manipulator have

maximum 1ift capabilities of 25 1b and 100 1b, respectively.

These master-slave units were installed to operate valves, to make

and break tubing disconnects and electrical and thermocouple disconnects,

 

and to conduct the hand operations required in the process. Conventional

hand tools were modified for use with these manipulators.
 

 

11

The PaR electromechanical manipulator was installed to perform the
heavy-duty maintenance, to convey heavy assemblies around the cell, to
reach some parts of the cell that were not accessible to the master-
slave manipulators, and to provide a "third" hand to simplify certain

operations.

Lb,» Process Flowsheets

Two processes were developed for the preparation of the Tuel
concentrate: (1) a high-temperature process, and (2) a low-temperature
process. The second process was adopted after conclusion of the cold
run when it became evident that the original process caused severe

corrosion of the reaction vessel.

4.2.1 High-Temperature Process

 

The chemical flowsheet for the one-step, high-temperature process
as shown in block form (Fig. 2) includes the following major steps:

233

(1) Partial reduction of the uranium oxide, UG, by thermal

means .
(2) Further reduction to UO, by hydrogen treatment.

(3) Conversion of the oxide to UF), by hydrofluorination and con-
current dissolution of the UF}, in the molten LiF to form the
eutectic mixture.

(4) Final purification of the eutectic mixture by treatment with
high-purity hydrogen.

reaction vessel. The reduction process was then conducted at tempera-

The Taw was combined with the in the initial charge to the
tures in excess of 845°C (LiF melting point) so that the oxide particles
were suspended in the molten fluoride. The molten LiF served to keep
the oxide particles wet, thus reducing the possibility of entrainment

of particulate matter in the effluent gas stream. During the hydro-
fluorination step, the progress of the reaction was estimated by

determining the liquidus temperature of the molten material, and then

the furnace temperature controller was adjusted to approximately 50°C

above this value. Frequent titrations of the reaction vessel effluent
gas stream yielded valuable information on the progress of the conver-
sion of the oxide to the fluoride since the utilization of HF remained

quite high and nearly constant until the conversion was completed.

Chemical anslyses of filtered samples of the melt were made to
determine whether the final process — the purification of the product
by hydrogen sparging = should be initiated or whether the hydrofluorin-

ation process should be continued.

h.2.2 Low-Temperature Process

 

The low-temperature process (see Fig. 3) was used to produce the
fuel concentrate. It differs in only cone major respect from that used
in the production of the original 230ubearing enriching salt for the
MSRE. In the earlier process, the starting material was UF), 5 in the

low-temperature process, the starting material 1s UO The oxide is

digested at 550°C and then reduced to uo, by sreatuent with hydrogen

at temperatures ranging from L400 to 550°C. Helium is used as a diluent
gas during the reduction step until the major portion of the exothermic
reaction is completed. The oxide is then converted to UF), by hydro-
fluorination at temperatures ranging from 400 to 630°C and at HF (in
hydrogen) concentrations varying from 5 to 40%. The final steps of the
process involve mixing and fusing the fluoride salts, contacting with
HF and hydrogen to remove residual oxides and corrosion product im-

purities, and filtering the molten salt during its transfer to the

storage containers.

The reduction and conversion processes were monitored by a thermo-
couple array that was inserted into the powder in the reaction vessel
and by measurements of hydrogen utilization during the reduction step
and of HF utilization during the conversion step. Unfiltered and fil-
tered samples of the melt were withdrawn for oxide, petrographic, and

metal impurity analyses.

The temperatures encountered in this process are generally 200°C

lower than those measured in the single-step, high-temperature process.

The adoption of this process was felt to be justifiable without the

benefit of a full-scale cold run because of the:

(1)
(2)

success of the laboratory-scale experiment,

similarity of this process to the original concentrate prod-

uction process,

improvements made in the process monitoring instruments and

techniques,

the time schedule involved.

4.3.1 Decanning Station

The decanning station (Fig. 7) is a rather complicated work box
that is required for cpening the double~container cans, extracting the
oxide powder, feeding the powder to the reaction vessel, and disposing
of the spent cans. To accomplish this, the station treated each can in

the following manner:
(1) Received the full can and fed it into a rotating chuck.

(2) Tightened the chuck to grip the can while the grooving tool
formed a grcove deep enough to fix the inner and outer cans
together. This was done twice for each can.

(3) Pushed the can into the box, displacing the previously opened
car.

(k) Bjected the previcusly opened can and lid.

(5) Gripped the can, supported it, and rotated it while the
cutting tocol cut it open.

(6) Removed and retained the cut-off 1id while the can was
emptied of oxide by vibration and brushing.

(7) Inspected the inside of the can and 1id for remaining powder.

(8) Transferred the powder from the box into the reaction vessel

by vibration and use of in-box tools.

The decanning station was designed for alpha containment. All
penetrations to it were sealed by O-rings and boots. Each spent can

acted as a seal until it was displaced by the next can.

A ball valve and charging hopper situated on top of the box was

used to introduce the LiF to the system.

4.3.2 Reaction Vessel

All of the chemical reactions of the process were conducted in
the reaction vessel (Fig. 8). The cold-run vessel was a right cylinder,

7-5/16 in. ID and 36 in. high, fabricated from type 30LL stainless

steel; it contained a free-standing liner, 1/8 in. thick, constructed
from type 201 nickel, and was designed, on the basis of stress rupture
data, for a specified service life. The vessel contained nozzles to
permit powder addition, salt sampling, gaseous effluent discharge, and
product transfer. Upon completion of the cold run, the design of the
vessel was modified to include a truncated conical bottom to provide
better contact of the reagent gases. The production runs were conducted
in this vessel. Design information for this vessel and the other process

vessels is listed in Table 1.

4.3.3 Salt Storage and Transfer Vessel

 

The transfer vessel (Fig. 9) was a right cylinder, 4 in, in diameter
and 36-1/2 in. tall, constructed of type 201 nickel. It contained five
nozzles, one cf which was a spare. The function of this vessel was to
receive a filtered, purified batch of the enriching salt from the re-
action vessel and to dispense it to the various product shipping con-
tainers. It was necessary for this vessel to store salt for 24 hr or

mere during the changecut of some of the shipping containers.

L.3.k

The shipping containers were arranged into three arrays for the
filling operations. Later, upon completion of the filling operation
and freezing of the salt, each array was disassembled into individual

containers for shipment to the MSREH.

The first array (Fig. 10) consisted of 45 enrichment capsules
(see Fig. 11), each of which was 3/k in. in diameter and 6 in. long
and designed to contain 96 g of uranium. The capsules were connected
in series and arranged in three 15-capsule decks. An overflow pot
containing liquid level detection elements and thermocouples was the
last vessel in the series. The tubing connections into, and out of, .
each capsule were precisely positioned so that uniform filling and

subsequent blowback of the overfill were possible. Two holes were

 

drilled in each capsule to permit the salt to flow out when the capsule

is lowered into the MSRE pump bowl. A cable-and-latch assembly was

sttached to each capsule for use in the sampler-enriched operation at

the reactor.

The second array (Fig. 12) consisted of four 2-1/2-in.-diam oy
3bh-in.-long cans connected in series for filling operations. Each was
designed to contain 7 kg of uranium and had an instrumented overflow
pot. The cans were later disassembled, and the top and bottom plugs
were removed; then the cans were fitted with lifting bails and bottom
"stopper-type" plugs and weighed. They are being shipped, one at a
time, to the MSRE, where the bottom plug of each can is removed before
the can is lowered into the drain tank. In this tank, the salt melts

and runs out of the container.

The third array (Fig. 13) contained a group of six o-1/2-in.~-diam
variable-length cans (see Fig. 14) that were similar in design and
arrangement to those in the second array. One of these cans was used
to store excess product material that was blown back from the other
five cans after they had been filled to overflow. The latter cans were
designed to contain 0.5 to 3 kg of uranium (2 cans, 0.5 kg each; one

can, 1 kg; one can, 2 kg; and one can, 3 kg).

4.3.5 Scrubbers

A caustic scrubber system was installed to neutralize the HF
effluent from the reaction vessel before it was discharged to the TURF
HOG system. The scrubbers, namely, four 13-gal polyethylene bottles
filled with 10% KOH, were connected in series and fitted with the
necessary fill-and-drain connections. The first bottle in the series
was kept empty, and the dip lines in the subsequent bottles were posi-
tioned at an exact depth. Thus the first bottle had an adequate volume
to retain any liquid that might flow back toward the reaction vessel
(in the event that the pressure distribution in the system became
reversed). Also, a vacuum breaker was installed to prevent the occur-

rence of a vacuum, which could cause collapse of the bottles.

Raschig rings had been installed to prevent collapse of the
bottles in the scrubber system used in the cold run; however, these
rings prevented uniform mixing and were subsequently replaced by a

vacuum breaker.

4.3.6 Miscellaneous Equipment

 

Oxide Can Lengthening Equipment. — The 23340 decanning station

 

3

was designed by using can drawings and sample cans from the Savannsh
River Laboratory. After the decanner was fabricated, it was discovered
that the actual cans were 1-3/4 in. shorter than denoted on the drawings.
(The measurements of the actual cans had not been checked closely be-
cause of the high radiation levels of the oxide.) Since modification

of the decanner was impractical, we decided to lengthen each can 1-1/2
in. by cementing an extension cn it. Three items of equipment, as

shown in Fig. 15, were required to accomplish this: (1) a machining
fixture to bevel the end of the can, (2) a press to force the extension
onto the can, and (3) a fixture to cure the epoxy resin used in the

cemented joint.

In-Cell Titration Assembly. — The off-gas titration assembly

 

consisted of a train of three 3-in.-diam by 6-in.-tall glass vessels,
a wet test meter for measuring gas flows, and the necessary tubing and

valves to permit reagents to be added and flushed from outside the cell.

Furnaces and Heaters. — Three high-temperature, electrical-

 

resistance-heated furnaces were installed in cell G for temperature
control of vessels used in the treatment, storage, and transfer of the
salt. A 2h-kw, 12-in.-cavity furnace was used for the reaction vessel;
a 7-1/2-kw, 4-7/8~in.-cavity unit was used for the transfer vessel;
and a 10-kw, 4-7/8~in.-cavity unit was used for the shipping container
assemblies. Locally fabricated clamshell heaters using tubular
resistance-heating elements provided heat to the nozzles located on
the tops of the vessels. The salt transfer lines were heated by at-
taching tubular heating elements to the tubing and then applying thermal
insulation. The off-gas line (and filter) was heated with electrical,
resistance-heating tape to prevent condensation of HF or water vapor

in the line.

Enrichment Capsule Drilling and Weighing Fixture. — Two holes were

 

drilled in each of 45 enrichment capsules to permit the salt to flow

out wher the capsule is immersed in the szlt in the reactor pump bowl.
Upon disassembly of the capsule filling array, each capsule was inserted
into the work box (Fig. 16); here, a bottom outlet hole and a top vent
hole were drilied in the capsule, the capsule was weighed, the lifting
bail was tested for integrity, and the capsule was inserted intc the
shipping cerrousel. The transparent box served as containment during
the drilling operation. Off-gas from the capsule drilling box passed
through an absolute filter and was then discharged to the plant vessel

off-gas system.

Disconnects. — The electrical and thermocouple disconnects used
in the cell were standard commercial units. Generally, one-hzslf of the
disconnect was mounted rigidly to facilitate making and breaking cpera-

tions with the master-slave manipulators.

Several types cof pipe and tubing disconnects were used. In genersl,
the gas service lines utilized ball-check quick disconnects. Compression
fittings were used in the salt transfer lines and in the main off-gas
lines. Conventional screwed pipe connections were used in areas where
remote operation of the joint was not considered necessary. Locally
designed and fabricated connections were used in several large-diameter

Joints that would possibly require remote maintenance.

Work Tables and Tool Racks. — The process equipment was positioned

 

in the cell to obtain maximum advantage of the capabilities of the eight |
available master-slave manipulators. Extensive use was made of support-
ing stands and mounting framework. Tool racks for the required hand
tools were located at the major work centers. Where possible, the vcid
spaces between the process equipment and the cell walls were filled with
trays to provide extra work areas, space for temporary tool storage, and
a surface on which to catch tools and small equipment items that were
dropped. A large work table (Fig. 17) was installed to accommodate the
product shipping container disassembly, the shipment preparation opera-

tions, and the capsule drilling and weighing fixture.

The tables, racks, and supports were fabricated from carbon steel;

kL. Operating Procedures

Operating procedures were developed for each of the 25 separate
operations required for the fuel production. (These procedures were
written before the cold run was made.) Brevity and conciseness were
stressed. Complete revision of most of them was necessary as a result
of the experience gained in the cold run. Review and revision, on a

233

day-to-day basis, continued throughout the U production runs; the
minor equipment failures and malfunctions that occurred during these
runs led to extensive procedural changes to ensure continued production

of a high-quality fuel concentrate.

Tables 2 lists the runsheets that were prepared.
5. COLD RUN WITH DEPLETED URANIUM

The run with depleted uranium provided full-scale testing of the
chemical process, operational procedures, and of most of the equipment
in the absence of a penetrating radiation field. In this run, 14.6 kg
of uranium oxide (11.6 kg of 238 plus 3.4 kg of LiF were charged to
the system to produce 18.7 kg of LiF-UF) (73-27 mole %) eutectic.’

5.1 Preoperational Activities

The period from September 15, 1967, through January 15, 1968, was
devoted to facility testing; process equipment fabrication, installation,
and testing; operator training; preparation of procedures and manuals;
and preparation of the process safety review, the criticality review,

and the radiochemical plant safety analysis.

The Uo, had been processed at the Y-12 Plant, and the empty inner and
outer cans had been obtained from the Savannah River Laboratcry. The
cans had been filled with the oxide and sealed by a magnetic forming

technique to simulate the product cans that would later be used in the
production runs. The can opening box did not perform satisfactorily;

therefore, it was removed from the cell and extensively modified. The
alignment tolerances were relaxed, components were strengthened, addi-

tional equipment was installed to aid in transferring the powder from

the box, and the viewing capabilities were increased.

Difficulty was encountered in transferring the LiF from the de-
canning box to the reaction vessel. The available vibration was in-
adequate, and no provision had been made to sweep or "rod" the powder
out and down through the powder addition line. The vibrators had been
located on the equipment in such a way that most of their force was
imparted to the fixtures and mechanisms in the box. This resulted in
some damage to the equipment. Because of this, the vibrators were used

sparingly and with caution.

5.3 Chemical Operations

Chemical operations began on January 24, 1968, with the sintering
operation, which was conducted at 900°C with a helium flow of 1 std
liter/min through the bed. The sintering treatment was immediately
followed by the hydrogen reduction step at the same temperature. A
2-liter/min fiow of gas, consisting initially of 0.1 liter of hydrogen
and 1.9 liters of helium per minute, was attsined initially. The com
position of this gas was adjusted periodically until a flow of pure
hydrogen was obtained. Then the flow rate was increased, in increments,
to 10 liters/min, where it was maintained for 5 hr. During this treat-
ment, the sintered-metal off-gas filter became plugged. Subsequent
examination of the filter unit revealed the presence of a hard filter
cake. Water vapor, which is evolved during the reduction process,
cculd have condensed on the filter in the event that the filter heater

was improperly operated; this would have permitted the filter temperature

 

to drop below the dew point of the effluent.
 

39

The conversicn of the oxide to the fluoride began January 27, 1968.
Anhydrous hydrogen fluoride mixed with hydrogen (1C meq of HF per liter
of hydrogen) wes injected through a dip line to the bottom of the uo,
bed at the rate of 2.2 liters/min. This reaction began at 900°C, and
the temperature was periodically decreased to maintain the melt at
about 50°C above the liquidus temperature. The in-cell titration appa-
ratus was used to monitor the HF in the effluent, but the results were
inconclusive; thus another titration unit that permitted precise addi-
tion of the equilibrating reagents from outside the cell was designed
and installed. The data obtained with the new equipment showed that
the utilization of HF was essentially zero (which indicated that the
conversion of the oxide was complete) after 295 hr of hydrofiuorination.
An attempt to sample the melt was unsuccessful because of the presence
of a hard top layer (or crust). No noise was evident from a listening
rod installed to detect bubbling from the dip lire. It was concluded
that the dip line had broken, by corrosion or melting, above the liquid
interface. This would account for the lack of HF utilization and the
slow progress in the conversion of the oxide. Subsequent examination of
the dip tube showed a large hole approximately at the interface. A new
dip tube, along with a sensitive scund detector, was installed, and the
HF treatment was resumed. Bubbling in the melt was easily detected;
and, for the first time, reasonable values for the HF utilization were
obtained. After 250 hr of additional HF treatment, the dip line be-
came plugged at a location about 1-3/k in. from its open end. Upon
examination, the plug material appeared to be uranium oxide. Four sub-
sequent lines plugged approximately at the gas-liquid interface within
the tube; in these instances, the plug material also appeared to be
uranium oxide. It was obvious, then, that excessive moisture was being
introduced into the melt by the gases used in the process. This problem
was solved by installing a column filled with magnesium perchlorate in
the helium system and by installing a catalytic recombiner; a molecular-
sieve drying column (with regenerative capabilities), and a moisture

analyzer in the helium systemn.
Lo

The effluent gases from the reaction vessel were directed to a
caustic scrubbing system, which consisted of polyethylene bottles filled
with 20% KOH solution and Raschig rings (to prevent collapse). At an
early stage in the process, the dip lines in the scrubber bottles
plugged, and a white precipitate appeared. Frequent sparging to promote
mixing, frequent recharging of the caustic solution, rinsing with hot
water, and a decrease (from 20% to 10%) in KOCH concentration permitted
use of the system for the remainder of the cold run. It was felt that
the Raschig rings were a major contributor to this problem in that they
promoted stratification of the solution; this was confirmed by the
colored interface that appeared in the bottles when phenolphthalein
indicator was present. At the conclusion of the cold run, the scrubber
system was completely replaced by one that contained spare lines and a
vacuum breaker (to prevent possible bottle collapse), and permitted

remote replacement and flushing of all lines.

Although it gave satisfactory results in the small-scale development

runs, the technique of measuring the liquidus temperature of the melt

and subsequently determining, from the binary UF), -LiF phase diagram,

the progress of the conversion reaction did not prove successful in

this system. The heat capacities and thermal insulation of the system,
along with poorly located thermccouples, obscured the inflection in the
temperature decay curve of the melt upon cocldown. However, the HF
utilization data, along with material balances for the system, provided
sufficient reaction progress information. When the reaction was judged
to be complete, an unfiltered sample of the melt was withdrawn and ana-

lyzed, chemically and petrographically, for oxide content.

The purification cf the melt, by the reduction of the metal fluo-
rides to metal, was conducted without incident. Titration of the HF in
the effluent gas proved to be a relisble means of determining the end
point of this reaction. Filtered and unfiltered samples were taken at
the conclusion of the purification step. The filtered samples were
considered to be representative of the packaged product since the melt
was filtered in the transfer operation. The cold run product analyzed

as follows:

The product was filtered into the intermediate storage vessel;
then it was transferred to the capsules and shipping containers by
subjecting the salt to = helium overpressure of approximately 12 to
15 psig and forcing it out of the vessel through a dip line. This in-
volved several operations because the capsules were, first, filled and,
then, replaced in the system by the shipping can container assembly for
filling. The compression-type tubing fittings used for this operation
vere very difficult to open after thermal cycling and after salt had
contacted them. (Also, it was difficult to make up these fittings
properly and to obtain leak-tight joints, using the master-slave manip-
ulators.) The approach to a solution of these difficulties consisted

of’:

(1) modificaticn of the intermediate transfer vessel by addition

of spare nozzles,
(2) reorientation of the vessel to improve accessibility,
(3) use of redundant fittings when necessary,
(L) use of a high-temperature thread lubricant on all fittings,

(5) modification of the operating procedure to reduce the number

of times fittings had to be opened, and

(6) training operators in use of the manipulators on a simulated

piping arrangement.

In summary, the cold run with depleted uranium was invaluable in

that it:

(1) led to a process that was more simple to operate and that

was compatible with the equipment,
Lo

(2) pointed out design and fabrication deficiencies in the

equipment,

(3) provided on-the-job training for the operators and supporting

personnel,

(4) tested the operational procedures, showing the need of exten-

sive changes in them, and

(5) showed that comprehensive remote maintenance procedures would
probably be mandatory to ensure successful completion of the

233

U fuel concentrate production runs.
6. (1:7-233r, PROCESS OPERATIONS

Three production batches, using the low-temperature flowsheet,
were required in order to prepare 63.4 kg of the fuel-enriching concen-
trate, Trar-#33ur, This concentrate contained 39 kg of uranium (35.6
kg of 233yy, The first run began May 9, 1968, and the third run wes
completed July 30, 1968. The 45 enrichment capsules were filled with
a portion of the first-run product; the four T-kg shipping containers
were filled with the remainder of the first-run product, all of the
gsecond-run product, and a portion of the third-run product; the mis-
cellaneous shipping container assembly was filled with the remainder
of the third-run product. The ten salt shipping containers and the 45
enrichment capsules were delivered to the Molten Salt Reactor as required

in the reactor enrichment schedule.

6.1 Feed Materials

The #330, had been prepared in batches by using 7 M NH, OH (in

excess) to precipitate hydrous uranium oxide from solutions that con-
and NH, NC,.

The uranium in the feed solution had been purified and isolated in 1964

tained 10 to 40 g of uranium per liter and were 1 M in HNO

and 1965 by solvent extraction followed by ion exchange. These treat-

ments decreased the concentrations of plutonium, thorium, fission prod-

 

ucts, and corrosion products (iron, nickel, and chromium) to acceptably

low levels. Table 3 shows typical analyses of the oxide feed material.

6.2 Radiation Levels of the Oxide Feed

The high radiation levels of the oxide feed material (see Table 4)
result from the daughter activity of the 232y (222 ppm) in the 233g,
Alpha, beta, and gamma radiation is emitted in the transitions (see
Fig. 18). From the shielding standpoint, the 2.6-Mev gamma radiation

from the 208, and the 2.2-Mev gamma radiation from the elon; are the

most important.

magnetic forming technique. They had been stored in Building 3019 at
ORNL.

To prepare the U fuel concentrate, we removed 89 cans from the
facility and transported them, in six loads, to the TURF in a shielded
carrier. The carrier was positioned on a pedestal atop cell G for

unloading the cans into the cell.

No spread of contamination or excessive radiation exposure to
personnel occurred during the removal of the oxide cans from the storage
facility, during their transfer to TURF, or during their discharge from

the carrier to cell G.

In cell G, the cans were gaged, and any burrs or excess weld metal
were removed by filing. Three separate operations were required to
elongate the cans to the 9-1/2-1n. length required for proper operation
of the can opening box. First, the cans were machined on one end tc
"true" them. A premachined end cap (with epoxy cement applied) was
inserted into the cell through the small-items entry port. This cap
was installed on the can in a pressing fixture, and then the can (with
cap) was placed in a curing fixture, where five cans at a time were
cured under longitudinal pressure for 1 hr at a temperature of 110 to
120°C. The can preparation equipment functioned satisfactorily, except
on one occasion in which the drive motor on the can machining fixture
burned out. The remaining cans for that run were dressed with a file,
and the caps were installed without incident. Later, a new motor was

installed remotely in the fixture.

The elongated cans of oxide were opened, one at a time, in the
decanning station. This was a time-consuming operation involving the
use of equipment that had been recognized during the cold run to be
marginal. The decanner had a rugged chuck assembly that held and ro-
tated the cans while a cutting wheel opened them inside an alpha-sealed
box. Most of the other attachments in the box were of little value,

and in some instances, actually hindered the operation.

The majcr problems in the decanning operation can be summarized

as follows:

(1) Alignment and clearance tolerances were tco close for hot-cell

operation.
(2) Visibility in the decanning box was limited.

(3) The powder failed to flow out of the box easily.

 
 

 

h7

(4) A vibrator shaft seal failed, leading to loss of oxide powder
from the box. This caused rather extensive contamination of
the cell. Modifications were made remotely during the fuel
concentrate production to increase visibility, repair the seal,
and to provide tools inside the decanner to assist in trans-

ferring the powder to the reaction vessel.

6.4 Reduction of Uranium Oxide

ol
The expanded bed of #0, wag heated for 2 hr at 550°C in a
helium atmosphere to remove, by pyrolysis, any traces of ammonium com=

pounds or other volatiles remaining from the chemical processing.

The bed was then ccoled to 400°C before hydrogen treatment was
started. This temperature was sufficiently low to accommodate the
temperature rise expected from the exothermic reaction of hydrogen with
U05:

Uo, + H, — Uo, + HO + 72,000 cal/g-mole.
The concentration of hydrogen (in helium) was adjusted initially to
5 vol % and was gradually increased to 50 vol % during the first 4 hr
of treatment. The temperatures within the bed were monitored by an
internal probe with 12 thermocouples that were placed at 2-in. intervals
along the vertical axis of the bed. These temperatures rose in response
to an increase in hydrogen concentration and then became constant after
the initial excursion. The procedure of incrementally increasing the

hydrogen concentration was repeated until the hydrogen:helium volume

ratio was 1:1; the gaseous flow rate was 2 liters/min.

The location of the reaction zone and the zone movement inside
the bed were clearly defined by the temperature profile. As the
reaction progressed, the reaction zone rose, in the form of a band,

up through the powder bed.

Figures 19 and 20 show plots of the temperature at 6 in. and
16 in., respectively, from the bottom of the 2L-in.-high bed during the

uranium reduction phase of the three production runs. The rise in the

temperature of the lower zone during the first 8 hr of treatment is due
to the exothermic reaction (the reaction vessel furnace was set to con-
trol at 400°C). After the temperature excursion resulting from the
initial increases in hydrogen flow had subsided (approximately 12 hr),
the temperature of the furnace was increased, at the rate of 30°C/hr,
until the bed temperature was 525 = 25°C. The reduction cperation was
continued at this temperature, with 50 vol % nydrogen=-50 vol % helium,
until 50 to 100% excess over the stoichiometric amount of hydrogen had

been passed through the bed.

Hydrogen utilization within the bed was 100% until the reaction
zone approached the top of the powder bed; then a slight decrease was
observed. Hydrcgen usage was determined by a material balance of the
gas flowing into the reaction vessel, as measured by rotameters, and

the gas outflow, as measured by the in-cell wet test meter.

6.5 Hydroflucrination of uo,

Upon completion of the oxide reduction step, the bed was allowed
to cool to LOO°C. The conversion of Jo, to UF), by hydrcfluorination,
using HF gas diluted with hydrogen, began at LO0°C and was completed

at 625°C. Five to seven days were required for the conversion.

The HF gas wes supplied to the process by withdrawing it from the
vapor space of a heated 100-1b HF cylinder. The cylinder heater was
thermostatically controlled to provide a vapor pressure to 12 to 1h psig.
A differential-pressure transmitter across a capillary restrictor in
the HF gas supply line was used to monitor the flow. The gas was passed
through a maze of tightly packed nickel wire in a 2-in.-diam nickel tube
that was maintained at 625°C to remove sulfur from the stream. It was
then mixed with a metered amount of dry hydrogen, filtered, and intro-
duced to the reaction vessel through a dip tube that extended to the

bottom of the uo, bed.

At the beginning of the hydrofluorination step, the composition of

the gas was 95 vol % hydrogen--5 vol % HF; the flow rate of the mixture

 

was 2 std liters/min. Over a period of 3 to 4 hr, the HF concentration

a
 

 

was incrementally increased to 40 vol % as the exothermic reaction
caused the bed tempersture to rise from LOO to 450°C. During these
initizl hours, the temperature within the bed was constantly monitored
to determine when the temperature excursion resulting from each HF flow

adjustment had ceased and when another adjustment could be made.
After the HF concentration of the hydrofluorinsating mixture had
reached 40 vol %, the reaction zone traveled, in the form of a band,

up through the bed (in a manner similar to that observed during the

hydrogen reduction) as the U0, was converted to UE), . The reaction

Uo, + LHF — UF) + eH,0 + 144, COC cal/g-mole

ju)
wn

is more exothermic than the reduction reaction, but it does not have a
great a tendency to cause thermal excursions. Probably, this is the

result of differences between UO Uo, and Ur), with respect to bed

3’
permeability and thermal properties. The reaction-zone temperatures
for the three production runs are plotted as a function of time in

Fig. 21. In runs 1 and 2, several furnace temperature adjustments were
made during the first five days of treatment in an effort tc increase
the bed temperature to W75-500°C (vecause the HF gas 1s less corrosive
to nickel at the higher temperature). In run 3, the furnace operated

satisfactorily and did not require adjustment.

The progress of the reaction was followed by observing the reaction
zone travel through the bed and also by obtalning a material balance of
the HF in the system. The HF utilization was essentially 100% for the
first five days and then decreased sharply ss the reaction zone reached
the top of the bed. Then the temperature of the bed was increased to
625°C, where it was held for two days to ensure completeness cof the
reaction. The HF utilization did not increase at the higher temperature;
instead, it continued to decrease, suggesting that the reaction had been

complete at the end of the fifth day of hydrofluorination.

A total of 13.5 kg of uranium, as UO., was converted to UF), in
~
each of the three runs; only very minor differences in the runs were

noted.

6.6 Formation of the Eutectic Salt

The eutectic mixture UF) -IiF (27-73 mole %) (Fig. 22) was formed
by adding the stoichoimetric quantity of lithium fluoride powder to the

uranium tetrafluoride powder and fusing the mixture.

Dry LiF powder was added to the reaction vessel by the fellowing
series of operations: (1) it was poured into a hopper located on top
of the decanning station, (2) it was dumped from the hopper intc the
decanner box, and (3) it was transferred from the box to the vessel by

vibration snd brushing.

The temperature of the reaction vessel containing the stratified
UF), and LiF powders was then increased to 855°C in order to melt the
lithium fluoride (mp, 835°C). The melt was digested at this tempera-
ture for 3 hr while it was sparged with hydrogen (at a Flow rate of 0.2
liter/min) to reduce any extraneous compounds that might have been

introduced during the LiI' addition.

A sound detector was attached to the reaction vessel dip line to
sense the bubbling of the hydrogen sparge that would occur in the
presence of a liquid in the bottom of the reaction vessel. This was
an excellent device for determining when the meltdown had started. The
internal thermocouple probe confirmed that, at meltdown, a very wide
range of temperatures existed along the axis of the melt. A rapid
cooldown to 650°C was observed in the lower region of the vessel where
liquid existed. At the same time, temperatures as high as 850°C were
measured in the upper regions of the vessel where fusing of the com-
pounds had not yet taken place. As more liquid was formed, a gradual
shift in the temperature profile occurred, indicating a rising liquid
level in the vessel. The temperature of the pool eventually reached
850°C, the set point of the furnace temperature controller. The initial
presence of the liquid and the rising level were also indicated by
changes in the dip line pressure as the back pressure on this line

increased to overcome the rising liquid level.

Differences, with regard to conditions during initial meltdown,

were noted in the runs. In runs 1 and 3, the UF), and LiF had to be

heated to about 850°C before melting occurred. In run 2, initial
melting occurred at 650°C, nearly 200°C below the melting point of the
lithium fluoride. The low-temperature initial melting must have resulted
from the presence of a sizable heel of salt (mp, 490°C) that remsined

in the reaction vessel from run 1. Probably, this heel acted as a

"seed" to permit fusing of the UF), and LiF powders at the lower tempera-

ture.

The 9-in.-deep pool of eutectic salt (mp, 490°C) was next treated
with 20 vol % HF--80 vol % hydrogen (flow rate, 2.4 liters/min) for 24
hr at a temperature of 700°C to remove the last traces of oxide from
the salt prior to the hydrogen purification preccedure. At the conciu~
sion of this treatment, an unfiltered sample of the salt was withdrawn
znd analyzed for oxide content. (A 1/2-in.-0D x 2-1/L4-in.-long nickel
cup was immersed in the salt to withdraw a 25-g sample.) After the
sample had solidified, a l-in.-long section was cut from the center and
analyzed petrographically and chemically for the presence of Uo, - The
remaining portion of the sample was submitted for & complete chemical

analysis.

Hydrogen: treatment of the salt was started prior to obtaining the
results of the analyses. The more rapidly obtained petrographic results
were used to determine whether hydrofluorination should be resumed or
whether hydrogen purification of the melt should be continued. In each

of the three runs, the UO. content was reported to be less than the

2
lower limit of accuracy (200 ppm) for the petrographic appraisal; thus,
subsequent HF treatment was unnecessary. Chemical analyses of the same
samples showed oxide contents (in the product salts) of 62, 34, and 32

ppm for runs 1, 2, and 3 respectively.

6.7 Purification of the Eutectic Salt

The eutectic salt was purified by bubbling pure hydrogen gas
(3 tc 10 ppm H,0), at a flow rate of 2 std liters/min, through the
10=in.-deep melt. The temperature of the molten salt during this
reaction,

GO
MF + 1/2 Hy, — HF + M,
56

is 700°C. The progress of the reaction was followed by titrating the
effluent gas with the in-cell titration assembly. These dats are
plotted in Fig. 23. The high rates observed initially can be attributed
to the evolution of the soluble HF in the melt. The first inflection
and plateau of each curve correspond to the reduction of the nickel
fluoride; this is followed by a second inflection and plateau, which
represent the reduction of the iron fluoride. The end point of the
purification was evident from the leveling off of the HF evolution rate
at 0.025 meq per liter of hydrogen. The hydrogen flow rate was in-
creased on several occasions during the process, and the reaction rate

seemed to be almost independent of the hydrogen concentration.

The effect cof the hydrogen treatment on the concentration of the
corrosion products is shown in Table 5. The chromium concentration in
the melt was not affected by the hydrogen treatment. Higher initial
values of nickel in the third run, and of iron in the second and third
runs, were the result of residual material left in the bottom of the
reaction vessel from previous runs. Apparently, the metals had pre-
cipitated and thus hed not been filtered cut during the transfer

operation.

The levels to which the iron and nickel concentrations were lowered
by the hydrogen reduction of the metal fluorides are believed to be
near the limit of accuracy of the sampling system and the laboratory
analyses. The actual concentrations of these impurities in the en-
riching concentrate, as delivered to the MSRE, should be somewhat lower
than the values reported because an additional 24 hr of hydrogen treat-
ment was provided in each run after the filtered samples were withdrawn
for analysis. Table 6 gives the chemical analyses of the fuel shipments

to the MSRE; Table 7 gives the isotopic analysis of the uranium.

During each of the three runs, the reacticn vessel was exposed for
2C days to 40 vol § HF--60 vol % hydrogen at temperatures ranging from
Loo to 850°C. Approximately 5 g of nickel (from the nickel liner of
the reaction vessel) was lost to each melt. This corresponds to a

uniform corrosion rate of slightly less than 0.C01 in. /year - a low =

rate for this type of process.

6.8 Transfer of the Eutectic Salt

Eight transfer operations were necessary to convey the three
13.5-kg batches of eutectic salt mixture from the reaction vessel to
the intermediate transfer vessel and then tc the various shipping con-
tainer assemblies. The transfers were made by applying helium gas
pressure over a pool of molten salt having a temperature of 600°C. The
salt was forced out of the dip line and thrcugh the transfer line and
salt filter tc the receiving vessel, which was vented. The transfer
lines were heated with tubular resistance heating elements, insulated
tc conserve heat and aveild cold spots, and equipped with thermocouples.
The transfers ranged in size from the 13.4 kg of uranium (4.7 liters
of salt) in the production batches to 4.3 kg of uranium (1.5 liters of

salt) that was required to fill the 45 enrichment capsule array.

The primary transfer line (3/8-1in.-0D x 0.065-in. wall type 200
nickel tubing), which connected the reaction vessel to the L-in.-diam

storage vessel, alsc served as the treatment gas supply line to the dip

 
 

61

tube in the reaction vessel. During the processing cperations, this
line was ccnnected to the treatment gas supply line instead of the
transfer vessel. In each of the feed batch transfers, a compression-
type fitting had to be broken and the transfer line had tc be connected
to a new salt filter that had previously been installed in a nozzle
atop the storage vessel. The sintered nickel filter was 3 in. in
diameter, and the pore size was 20 BL. Transfers through this line re-
quired an overpressure of 15 psig to overcome the static head (18 ft
H,0) and the restriction to flow of the filter. Time required to com-
plete the transfer varied from 78 to 140 min. Initial movement of the
salt through the line was obvious from the rapid response cf the attached
thermocouples to the salt tempersture. The progress of the transfer
was followed by observing the rising back pressure orn the helium purge
to the storage vessel dip line; this indicated a rising liquid level.
The rush of gas through the line at the end of the transfer was audible
from the sound detector. These conditions were verified by a sharp
drop in the reaction vessel pressure and a rapid increase in gas flow

through the salt transfer line.

Five transfers were required to fill the three-product container
assemblies. They were made via a 1/U-in.-OD nickel transfer line that
connected the assembly to a dip line in the storage vessel. Since
filters were not involved in these transfers, the transfers were com-
pleted in approximately 10 min. Thermocouples on the transfer line and
on the shipping containers indicated the movement of salt. An overflow
pot at the end of the containers (in series) was equipped with liquid
level detection probes and internal thermocouples to indicate the pres-
ence of salt. A blowback of gas then ensured that the containers were

filled to the proper level.

The transfer operations were conducted at a salt temperature of
600°C. (This temperature had been arbitrarily selected, and the con-
tainers had been fabricated to contain the desired quantity of fuel at
this temperature.) The filled containers were allowed to cocl, and the

salt was allowed to solidify before the disassembly operation began.
62

6.9 Container Disassembly and Preparation for Shipment

The shipping container assemblies were stripped of the thermo-
couples, overflow pots, heaters, and supporting hardware. The containers

were separated from each other by cutting the interconnecting tubing.

The 45 enriching capsules were clipped and trimmed, were tested
(i.e., their lifting balls were tested) with a 15-1b pull, were drilled
for draining and venting, and were identified and weighed. Then they
were packaged, in groups of six, in carrousel shipping containers. The
equipment, which was designed to do these operations remotely, functioned

satisfactorily.

The 2-1/2-1in.-diam product cans were easily removed from the filling
arrays; however, removal of the top and bottom plugs from each can was
quite difficult. An inordinate amount of force was necessary to break
the bottom plug loose from the thin salt film that had formed in the
annulus between the plug and the bottom nozzle. Several fixtures de-
signed for this task proved to be inadequate and had to be replaced with
sturdier units. A lifting bail was installed on each can. Also, a
stopper was inserted in the bottom of the can to minimize the loss of

salt during handling and shipment.

The cans were weighed by using a beam balance that was located in
a glove box mounted con top of the processing cell. The glove box be-
came a part of the cell containment for this operation. A long cable,
with the 1ifting bail of the can attached, was suspended from the
balance into the cell. The gross weight of the cans ranged from 1.6

to 15 kg.

All of the shipping containers were then stored in cell G to await

shipment tc the MSRE.

6.10 Transfer of Trar-2330r, Salt Product to the MSRE

Six of the 2-1/2-in.-diam product salt containers (total uranium
content, 33 kg) were delivered, individually, to the MSRE in the 10-ton

Pu-Al carrier. The Pu-Al carrier was slightly modified for this opera-

 

tion. The three-barrel magazine was removed, and a winch-and-cable
 

 

63

assembly was installed on top of the carrier in a sealed housing so

that it became a part of the carrier containment.

The carrier was placed on top of the pedestal over a 6-in.-diam
port to cell G, and became a part of the cell containment when the
slide drawers in both the carrier and the pedestal were opened. The
cable hook was lowered into the cell to receive the product can and
then raised to withdraw the can from the cell into the carrier. The
pedestal drawer and the carrier drawer were closed, isolating the car-
rier and cell from each other and from the ambient atmosphere. In this
manrier, containment of the fuel was maintained at sll times. The car-
rier was then removed from the pedestal, sealed by the Installation of

the cover plates, and cleaned of any surface contamination.

The fuel carrier was then transported tc the MSRE, where it was
positioned over a turntable (Fig. 24) that was designed for charging

the enriching concentrate to the reactor fuel drain tank.

Measurements, at the surface of the Pu-Al carrier, of the radiation
emitted by one T-kg uranium fuel can are given in Table 8. The neutrons
are produced by (a,1) reactions on lithium and fluorine (of the eutectic)
by the high-energy alpha particles emitted by several of the daughters
of the 2325,

The enrichment capsules were shipped tc the MSRE in a smaller
carrier that was designed to accommodate six capsules in a carrousel
fixture. The carrousel served as a support fixture during transport
and as a holder for six bottom plug assemblies that became a part of
the sampler ~ enricher system at the MSRE as the capsules were removed

from the carrier through a 1-1/2-in.-diam hole in the top.

A small glove box was fabricated for use in removing the carrousel
assemblies from cell G. This box was mounted on top of the small car-
rier, which, in turn, was mounted on the pedestal above the cell. Then
the pedestal slide-valve drawer was opened, and the glove box and the
carrier became a part of the cell containment. A cable from a winch
inside the box was lowered into the cell to receive the carrousel. The

carrousel was withdrawn into the carrier, the pedestal drawer was closed,

and then the carrier was removed from the pedestal and placed on its
base. The glove box was removed from the carrier, and shield plugs
were inserted in the 1/2-in.~-diam and 1-1/2-in.-diam access openings
in the top of the carrier. The carrier contained a 5-in.-dlam cavity

with 4 in. of lead shielding around it.

When the small carrier housed six capsules, each containing 9% g
of uranium in approximately 150 g of fuel concentrate, the gamma radi-
ation level was 200 mrem/hr at the surface and decreased to 20 mrem/hr

at 6 ft. The neutron radiation levels at the surface and at 6 ft were

 

105 mrem/hr and 10 mrem/hr, respectively; measurement made at the open
66

bottom of the carrier during removal from the pedestal indicated a

radiation level of 50,000 mrem/hr.

The removal of the fuel from cell G and its subsequent transfer
to the MSRE were characterized by very low radiation exposures to
personnel snd essentially no spread of contamination. In fact, only
the top surface of the pedestal and a small area immediately adjacent

to it had to be decontaminated.

6.11 Material Ralance

A total of 39.72 kg of uranium, in the form of uranium oxide
powder, was transferred to cell G of the TURF. Of this amcunt, 38.95 kg

of uranium, as LiF-UF) , was packaged as the finished product.

The can-opening operation accounted for = loss of 245 g of uranium
as uranium oxide. Most of this, 200 g, was lost through the empty can
discharge chute because excessive powder had accumulated in the box. A
lezking seal on the vibratory screen drive shaft accounted for 45 g.
Remote modification to the decanning station and changes in operating
procedures eliminated these sources of loss after the first batch (29

oxide cans) had been processed.

Sampling accounted for a loss of 10C g of uranium. Two 15-g and
two 5-g salt samples were required in each of three production runs.

In addition, several extra samples were required for special purposes.

The presence of heels in certain vessels and the holdup in transfer
lines and filters were responsible for the majority of the loss. The
heel in the reaction vessel amounted to 27 g. However, the storage
vessel contained 346 g of uranium as heel as a result of a dip line
replacement. The dip line was installed improperly and, as a result,

about 1/3 in. of unrecoverable salt heel was left in the vessel.

A summary of the uranium accountability is given in Table 9.

7. MAINTENANCE ENGINEERING

Farly in the run with depleted uranium, it became obvious that
some of the equipment in cell G could not be considered reliable and
would have to be repaired or replaced before the conclusion of the
three production runs. Many of the deficiencies were corrected in
the interval between the depleted-uranium run and the 233y run. Since
it was impractical to consider major equipment modifications at this
time because of the fuel delivery schedule requirements at the MSRE,
emphasis was placed on: (1) storage of spare parts ir the cell,

(2) installation of redundant fittings, (3) procurement and modifica=-
tion of teols and work tables in cell G, and (4) formulation of main-

tenance procedures.

7.1 Spare Parts

Because of the difficulties involved in obtaining access to the
hot cell, a generous supply of replacement parts was stored inside the
cell and cataloged for easy retrieval. Where applicable, the parts
were prefitted to ensure compatibility with the system. Threads on

the fittings and nuts and bolts were treated with a lubricant that is

suitable for use in high-temperature environments.
68

7.2 Redundant Fittings

The compression-type fittings used on the salt transfer lines and
on the gas supply lines at the vessel nozzles were extremely difficult
to make and bresk after they had been thermally cycled from room tempera-
ture to 600-700°C. The passage of molten salt through one of these
fittings made the operation even more difficult because the salt formed
a seal around the protrusion of the tubing into the fitting. Since
several of these fittings had to be routinely operated in the product
transfer operations, there were several lines in the system for which
no alternate had been provided. In these cases, redundant fittings
were installed in such a manner that a second fitting was available if
the primary fitting could not be operated. Although complex fitting
arrangements are normally conducive to leakage, no such problems were
encountered here. On two occasions, use of the standby fitting was
necessary in order to replace the sintered metal filter in the salt

transfer line.

7.3 Tools and Work Tables

A large assortment of hand tools, modified for use with the manip-
ulators, were stored on tool racks in the cell. Usually the modification
consisted of welding grips to the tool to aid in handling by the master-
slave manipulators. A few special-purpose tools, such as air-operated
snips (for cutting the interconnecting tubing of the capsules) and an
impact wrench (for use with the electromechanical manipulator), were
also stored for later use in the cell. End wrenches and other fixed-

size tools were color coded by sizes for ease in identification.

Work tables and trays were located between the viewing windows
and the major pieces of equipment. They proved to be invaluable in the
many mechanical and maintenance operations conducted in the three sslt
production runs because of the limited reach of the master-slave manip-
ulators and also because of the limited field of vision available through
the windows. A secondary, but very important, function of the trays
involved retrieval of tools and miscellaneous items that were dropped

because of wear of manipulator parts or because of awkwardness on the

 

 
 

 

part of the operstor. When an item fell to the floor, rather than
onto a tray, it usually had to be replaced since retrieval from the

floor in many locations of the cell was impossible.

The large heavy-duty work table (Fig. 17) designed for the product
container and capsule array disassembly operations served well in these

functions and was also used extensively as a general-purpose work bench.

7.4 Maintenance Procedures

Remote maintenance of the process equipment was recognized, during
the run with depleted uranium, to be a formidable task that could not
be left to the operator's discreticn when the need arose. Thus an
engineer was assigned, on a full-time basis, to develop detailed main-
tenance procedures that would be applicable during any conceivable

failure as well as during the planned maintenance operations.

A comprehensive set of close-up photographs was taken of the
equipment in cell G before the cell was sealed to process the radioactive
material. These were later augmented by photographs taken through the
shielding windows and the monocular viewers. Altogether, more than 300

photographs were made.

Fifty-five detailed, step-by-step maintenance procedures were
written by using the photographs and field sketches (more than 300)
that had been used in the fabrication and installation of the equip-
ment. A complete list of tocls and materials necessary for the job was
included in each procedure. Where appropriate, the maintenance proce-
dure was referred to, or included in, an operating procedure to ensure
continuity of a process operation. Although it was not necessary to
use all of these procedures in the fuel production, they were instru-~

mental in ensuring a safe and orderly completion of this task.
8. CONCLUSIONS

1. Reactor-grade eubectic salt concentrate, Tr7-

233
233

Jur, (73-27
233
U0... or “UF,

mole %), can be prepared by remote means from LiF and 5 |

by the process described in this report.
70

2. Hydrogen reduction and hydrofiuorination reaction rates of
oxide beds can be controlled satisfactorily by adjusting hydrogen and
HF flows to avoid excessive temperature excursions from the excthermic
reactions involved. Temperatures can be determined by placing a number

of thermocouples within the beds.

3. Equipment for a remote process of this type should be designed
with a minimum number of close=-tolerance fits. It should also be de-
signed on s& modular concept so that components can easily be replaced,

thus eliminating, if possible, remote repair operations.

4. In general, commercial pipe, tubing, and electrical fittings
are satisfactory in this type of operation. However, they are not
satisfactory in instances where high temperatures or exposure to molten
salt are expected. In these cases, special-purpose fittings should be

developed.

5. Concentrations of the corrosion products nickel and iron can
ve reduced to satisfactorily low levels by hydrogen treatment of molten

selt at 550°C. Chromium was not reduced by the process described.

6. A binary mixture of UF) - LiF having a eutectic composition can
be fused at a temperature of 650°C in the presence of a small amount of
liquid eutectic heel remaining in a vessel. In the absence of the lig-
uid heel, it 1s necessary to heat the materials to the melting point

of the LiF (835°C) to achieve liquefaction.

7. To obtain a product containing less than LO ppm of oxygen and
to avoid plugging of dip lines by the formation of oxides within them,
it was necessary to install a catalytic recombiner and a molecular-
sieve drying column in the hydrogen supply system. The use of Linde
type 41h 1/16-in.-diam sieve material in a regenerative drying column

reduced the moisture content of commercial-grade hydrogen to less than

3 ppm.

8. Maintenance procedures are necessary to ensure orderly com-
pletion of a process of this nature. They are vital when entry into a
contaminated cell 1s necessary and when equipment and the product must

be removed from the cell.
