Molten-Salt Breeder Reactors

Abstract

The problems involved in building a molten-salt thermal-bréeder

reactor are reviewed, and it is concluded that the most feasible
construction is an externally-cooled reactor with the fuel salt
passing through the reactor core in graphite tubes. A reactor
with 15% of the core volume occupied by fuel salt and 5% occupied
by fertile salt would have a net breeding ratio of about 1.06.
The specific power is about 3.0 Mv(th) per kg of U-233, U-235,
and Pa in the entire reactor and chemical processing system. The
resulting doubling time is 13 full-power years. The cost of the
fuel cycle for a 1000-Mw(E) station with this breeding performance
is estimated to be 1.2 mills/kvhr. The performance in terms of
material utilization is an output of 1.18 Mw(E) per kg of U-233,

U-235 and Pa, and 3.2 Mv(E) per metric ton of thorium.

The latter

figure could be increased by a factor of two at a sacrifice of

0.01 in breeding ratio.

MOITEN-SAIT BREEDER REACTORS

The purpose of this memo is to examine and summarize the status of the
molten-galt reactor as meeting the requirements of a breeder with a

doubling time of not more than 25 years, Included are a discussion of:

1. The practicability of different types of breeder reactor
construction.

2. The power density attainable in the fuel salt.
3. The status and cost of the required chemical processing scheme.

4. The breeding gain, specific power, and doubling time consistent
with reasonable assumptions concerning items (1), (2), and (3).

5. The feasibility and cost of molten-salt reactors.

The contents of this memo have not been subjected to enalysis by the Thermal-
Breeder Evaluation group. Their work will be largely independent of this, and
their results, when available, will take precedence over the numbers used in
this memo.

I. Reactor Construction

Three types of breeder resctor construction are discussed: the unit-fuel-
tube construction, the graphite-core-shell construction, and an internally-
cooled construction.

Unit Fuel Tube Construction - The type of construction that is believed to

be most practical at present for a molten-salt breeder reactor is one in
which the fuel salt passes through the reactor in graphite tubes. Graphite
moderator is massed outside of the fuel tubes in the core region of the
reactor, and blanket salt containing thorium surrounds the core. The blanket
salt also passes through small passages in the moderator graphite and cools
it. Fig. 1 (ORNL-IR-Dwg. 42242) gives a schematic representation of one edge
of such s& reactor, showing a single fuel tube, one of many. Although Fig. 1

shows a re-entrant graphite tube with both inlet and outlet at the bottom end

to avoid problems of differential thermal expansion, it may also be possible
to use a construction in which the fuel tubes go straight through the reactor.

The fuel tubes would be manufactured from fine-grained extruded graphite
rendered impervious by one of a number of treatments available. This type
of graphite has been shown to be the most impervious to molten salts; one

saent of salt by volume when pressures of up to 150 psi are applied; in fact,

. blanket galt will be maintained under slight pressure with respect to the

such grade has been used in contact with flowing salt streams for a year
with no evidence of attack or bulk penetration by the salt. Separate tests
have indicated that such a grade of graphite will soak up less than one per-

one grade picked up less than 0.2% by volume of salt. Tubes 3-3/4 #n. ID x
5 in. OD are on order and will be tested within a few months.

The moderator graphite will be in the blanket salt environment, end the

fuel salt so that any leakage that develops will be from blanket salt to
fuel salt. Ieakage can be tolerated provided it is at a rate that is small
compared to the rate of chemical processing of the fuel salt. The moderator
graphite could also be made from fine-grained extruded graphite to keep pick-
up of salt in it a¥ias low a level as possible. By confining the fuel to
tubes and pressurizing the blanket salt with respect to the fuel salt, fis-
sioning within graphite will be kept to a minimum. As & result there is
little reason to expect buildup of fission-product poisons in the graphite.

In the re-entrant fuel-tube construction, two metal-to-graphite connections
are necessary. The connection to the central graphite tube need only be a
mechanicelly sound connection, etwh as a slip fit, since a small leakage

here would only bypass s small amount of fuel from going through the reactor
core. The connection of the outer fuel tube to the metal wall of the reactor
should be reasonably tight, with leakage small relative to chemical processing
rate of the fuel. The three possibilities for this joint are a flanged joint

 

~ with a mechanical pressure seal, a frozen-salt plug seal, and a brazed metal-

to-graphite tube junction. Babcock and Wilcox have experimented with pressure
type flanged joints with some success, and it is presumed that this will be a

feasible solution to the problem. The testing of the freeze plug technique

is under way at Oak Ridge, and early indications are that it will be possible

to braze graphite to INOR-8, probably by the use of pure molybdenum as an in-

termediate material to provide a match to the thermal expansion coefficient

to the graphite.

Graphite Core Shell Construction = A simple construction for a small two-

‘region reactor with a graphite core shell is shown in Fig. 2 (ORNI~IR-Dvg.

37258). As shown in the drawing, the core is made from three large blacks

of graphite, a top header, a bottom header, and a center section. The
diameter of the core is approximated 5k in., and the height of the center
section would be gbout 40 in. It is proposed that these graphite parts be
made from large-size molded-graphite blocks, that the blocks be rough machined
to shape, and that they then be impregnated and tmmted to make them nearly
impermeable to molten salts. It is possible that final machining on the in-
ternal parts would be done before treatment and the parts clamped together
during treatment to cement ‘the headers on and yield a monolithic block con-

_ struction.
L

This monolithic construction is an alternate to having the three graphite
blocks as separate pieces, clamped together and held in place by springs.
The monolithic structure is considered more desirable, but makes the
impervious treatment more difficult. The pressure contact should be sat-
isfactory, at least for the initial reactor operation, on the basis of

"Babcock and Wilcox work. It is possible that distortions produced by

shrinkage accompanying radiation damage would reduce the effectiveness
of the seals. A greater worry is the effect of shrinkage on the internal
portion of the core. If trouble were encountered here, the interior of
the core could be made up of smaller graphite pieces, such as sticks of
extruded grephite.

pr : !
Grephite has been made in larger sizes than called for in this reactor,
but not of the small grain size required to render it impervious. It is
believed that suitable material has been produced in diameter of 39-1/2 in.
and in thicknesses of up to 20 in. Samples of this graphite are now being
procured, and teste of their penetrability by molten salts will be completed

during FY 1960. If this graphite’appears suitable, it is believed that it

can be made in larger sizes, up to 5 ft in diameter, but at considerable cost
in production equipment and in development expense. The development of the
larger block graphite for molten-salt reactors is not now planned, but would

~ be a part of the cost of the first full-scale breeder reactor of this type.

(There is a possibility that the development of such graphite might be under-
taken by the Defense Department for other purposes before this time.)

This design of reactor requires a seal between the graphite header and the
INOR-8 pipe passing into the blanket vessel. Thie joint need not be a her-
metic one, but should limit the leakage of blanket salt into the fuel to
some small fraction of the core processing rate. The problems of this joint
are the seme as those involved in the fuel tube construction.

The permissible pickup of molten salt by the graphite depends on the rates

of diffusion of uranium into the salt that is in the graphite and of the
fission products out of the graphite into the main fuel stream. Some infor-
mation on this subject will be determined in FY 1960 in the capsule experiments
at the MTR. In the meantime, a reasonable assumption is that the diffusion of
fission products out balances the diffusion of them into the graphite. For a
poison effect of one percent, the pickup of fuel salt into the graphite should

‘be less than one or two volume percent, depending on the volume fraction of

fuel passages in the core. If the large molded graphite turns out to have a
pickup of less than one percent, then it should be suitable for use as the bulk.
of the core graphite. If, on the other hand, it picks up more than 2% galt
by volume, it would be preferable to use a hollow core shell with an interior
construction of extruded graphite sticks. As previously indicated, such ex-

struded grades have been shown to pick up a satisfactorily low level of salt.

Internally-Cooled Reactor - Various designe of internally-cooled molten-
salt reactors have been suggested. One of the simplest is shown. in concept
in Fig. 3. In this concept, the fuel is contained in graphite tubes about
0.54n.ID x 0.7 in. OD that extend through the moderator, well into the
blanket region. The tubes are connected at each end by brazed joints to

a metal header system go that the fuel can be circulated slowly to keep it
uniform, to remove gaseous fission products, and to allow fuel concentration
adjustment as burnup proceeds. Presumably the tubes would have graphite in-
serts forcing the fuel to the periphery of the tubes in the core region and
occupying most of the internal volume of the tubes in the blanket region.
The heat generated in the fuel would be transferred through the tube wall
to the blanket salt which is used as & coolant. This would probably limit
the heat generation to perhaps 50 kw per tube averaged over the reactor,

and would therefore require 10,000 tubes for a reactor delivering 200 elec-
trical megawatts of power.

Although no brazed joint that is completely satisfactory in terms of com-
patibility with the salt has yet been demonstrated, there is little doubt

but thet such & joint will be demonstrated during this fiscal year. The

use of molybdenum es an intermediate nipple connection has been demonstrated,
and brazing materiels that wet graphite and ere compatible with the salt have
been found. Thus, in all probability, there will be no single technical
element of infeasibility remaining by the end of this fiscal year for an
internally-cooled reactor. Nevertheless, the concept of 10,000 tubes all
maintaining their integrity during & long reactor lifetime is not very attrac-
tive, at least to this writer. The edvantage hoped for with internal cooling
is a greater specific power, but it is doubtful if the internally-cooled
reactor can achieve more than a factor of two in specific power over an
externally-cooled molten-salt reactor.

Summary - The unit-fuel-tube construction seems to be a feasible configuration
for a breeder reactor. By the end of this fiscal year it should be possible
to specify suiteble types of graphite for both fuel tubes and moderator, and
to specify a satisfactory end connection for the tubes. The construction
avoids most of the possible problems involved in soaking of fuel into the
graphite since the fuel contacts only & small portion of the moderator graphite.
Furthermore, it will use the type of graphite that 1s now deemed least likely
to soak up fuel salt.

The graphite-core-shell construction requires graphite of a size and quality
that is not immediately available, and will probably not be available without
the expenditure of a few million dollars of development money. If this expendi-
ture were made, the reactor construction would have a good chance of success.
However, the earlier availability of the fuel tube construction mekes it the
first choice.

The internally«“cooled reactor has some attraction in terms of higher specific
pover and is made up of elements that individually seem quite feasible. The
great complexity of the core and the probable inaccessibility of it for minor
repairs make it unattractive at this stage of the technology.

The reference reactor for the remainder of this memo ie then taken to be
of the fuel tube construction, with 15 wol % of the core occupied by fuel
salt, 5% by blanket salt, and the remaining 80% by graphite. If the fuel
tubes are 3-3/L in. ID, the fuel tubes will be spaced on 8-5/8 in. centers
on & square array.

II. Power Density

The nuclear celculation will yield the breeding ratio and the uranium con-
centration required in the salt to make the reactor eriticel. In a circu-
lating fuel reactor, the latter figure must be combined with the power that
can be extracted per unit volume of fuel salt to yield a gross figure for
specific power. The power obtainable per unit volume of salt can be arrived
at in two ways: one is a general epproach that looks at the fundamental
factors involved, and the other is to lay out specific designs and see what
thelr volumes are, and how much power they take care of. We will first look
at the problem generally snd then examine specific leyouts that have been
proposed. - So

A reasonable value of the power density in the fuel can be estimated from
the total length of piping required in the system. The length of piping
considered is that required to carry the fuel salt into and out of the
reactor, through the blanket, through header connections, through the heat
exchanger and the equivalent length of piping represented by the pump volute
and expansion » An average fluid velocity will be assumed through this
piping, and a safle temperature range between resctor entrance and exit. This
information combined with the volumetric specific heat of the salt determines
the amount of heat transferred per unit volume of salt.

The composition of the fuel salt will be about 62Tmole % IiF, 37 mole % BeFop,
and 0.3 mole % UF4. The volumetric heat capacity of this mixture is about
1.25 cal/ec-OC at reactor temperature, or 77.5 Btu/eu £t-OF. The melting
point of the fuel is about 850°F, and a figure about 100°F above this should
be used es the minimum bulk fluld temperature. However 3 the fertile salt has
a melting point of 9759F, go that this, rather than 950°F, will be taken as
the minimum temperature of the fuel salt returning to the reactor. The
maximum temperature of the salt leaving the reactor should be limited by the
corrosion tolerance of the metal alloy system; and with present knowledge
£0

thie is set as 13000F since very few loops have been run ag yet at a higher
temperature. This is probably also e practical limit es set by the creep
resistance of the alloy INOR-8. The temperature range of 975 to 1300°F is
3250F, but & value of 300°F will be used as a reasonable limit, presumably
from 975 to 12759F. With this AT and heat capacity, each cubic foot of

fuel transports 23,200 Btu of heat each time it makes the heat transfer circuit.

It is difficult to set & natural limit on the maximum average flow velocity
that can be allowed for the salt in traversing its circuit. The only known
limiting factors are the pressure drop developed by the pumps and the pro-
portion of power one wishes to expend in pumping. A figure .6f 17 ft per

- second hag been picked somewhat arbitrarily for an average fluid velocity,

with velocities of up to 20 ft per second in the external system and a
lower velocity inside the reactor. The major justification for selection
of this figure 1s that it ylelds reasonable pressure drops (v100 psi) with
reasonsbly sized heat exchanger tubes and other plumbing fixtures, and with.

‘it pumping powers are low. This velocity is well below the maximum velocity

assumed in the reactor portion of sodium-~-cooled reactors. It should be
recognized however, that thie fluid velocity is not derived from any basic
constants of nature, but it does seem a reasonable assumption on the basis
of present experience.

The effective length of the plumbing circuit will depend on the requirements

for maintenance and on the necessary allowances for thermal strains. These,

of course, depend on the type of reactor layout. Here, we will consider

pipes coming from the reactor to a pump, the pump feeding into a heat exchanger,
and the exit of the heat exchanger going back to the reactor. There will be

header connections joining a number of fuel tubes together to feed into each

pump and heat exchanger. It would seem possible to have a total circuit length
of 80 ft for a reasonably sized power reactor, broken down approximately as follows:

ft
In reactor core Co 10.0
Through blanket 5.0
End connections to reactor = = 15.0
Heat exchanger : 15.0
Allowance for pump and oo
expansion tank So T.5
Miscellaneous : 2.5
Connecting pipes 25.0

If this is the length of the circuit, the fuel salt will traverse the circuit
in 4.7 seconds and the heat transfer rate will be 4940 Btu/sec-cu ft or
5.2 Mw/cu ft of fuel, or 18% kw/liter of fuel.

The remote maintenance demonstration facility in the 9201-3 building in Y-12
provides one check on the length of piping required for a proper layout of a.

~ reactor system. In the facility as it stands, with its pump, dummy reactor,

riping layout with flange connections and dummy heat exchanger, the total

- effective length of the fuel salt circuit ie about 42 ft. If a true breeder

reactor were installed (with ite blanket dictating a larger path), and if a
full-scale real heat exchanger were installed, the piping length would in-
crease by about 30 ft to a total of 72 ft. This system would then be main-
teinable, but its power would be limited by the pump and piping presently
installed to about 67 Mw thermal. It would probably be desirable to have
about 100 Mw (thermal) in each pump-heat exchanger circuit for this type
of layout, so that with the increased capacity system, 80 ft is probably a
practical length for the circuit piping in & reactor maintainable by the
canyon type equipment installed in this facility.

Another type of layout that is currently in favor is that calling for top
maintenance, and in which the entire fuel salt circuit is contained in a
single large vessel. This type of system allows greater compactness.

B. W. Kinyon has analyzed several cases in a memo (reproduced as Appendix I),
in vhich credit was taken only for a 200°F AT in the fuel. The results of
his study indicate that with the 2000F AT and a fuel velocity of 15 ft per
second in the piping, power densities of about 5 Mw/cu ft can be obtained.
The total pressure drop in this system is about 115 psi, of which 105 is
across the heat exchanger. This analysis lends further credence to the
belief that about 5.2 Mw/cu ft or 184 kw/liter can be obtained for a molten-
salt breeder reactor.

"IIT. Chemical Processing

The chemical processing scheme proposed for the core circuit is as follows:

A small eide stream of the fuel salt will be fluorinated to remove UF by
the fluoride volatility process. The UFg will be burned in Hp to UF) and

will be placed 1n the reserve storage of UFy for reactor feed. The molten-

salt carrier, with most of the fission products, will be stored for decay

of radioactivity toa sultable level, and then processed by the HF dissolu-
‘tion process, recovering the IiF and BeFp, end eliminating most of the fission
products. The LiF-BeFp will be adjusted in composition and added to the reactor
core stream again. The blanket will be processed by the fluoride volatility
process to remove the UFg on e frequent basis to keep the uranium inventory in
the blanket low. The UFg is burned to UF), and the UF) produced is added to

the reserve supply pending reactor feed or sale. The Pa does not come out
of the blanket salt, but returns with it to the reactor system. By keeping
the uranium at a low level in the blanket, the buildup of fission-product
poisons ie very small end the blanket ie reprocessed completely only & few
times during reactor life.

In practice, the frequency of processing of, the blanket and fuel will be
determined by an economic balance. This balance is not struck here, the
approach being to see what processing rates are required to achieve certain
nuclear aims and to examine the cost of these rates. A 1000-Mw(E) station
vill have a heat output of about 2500 Mw(th). At 5.2 Mw/cu ft, the circu-
lating fuel volume will be about 480 cu ft of fuel salt. When the fuel
comprises ebout 15% of the volume of the core, the uranium concentration’

in the fuel salt is about 1.2 kg/cu ft, yielding a total uranium content

of the circulating fuel system of 575 kg of uranium (fissionable). About

3 kg will be burned per day, so that 191 days ie the burnup time for the
fuel. For the varieble fission-product poison to be kept at one percent,

‘a ten percent burnup is allowed before reprocessing, so that the entire

480 cu ft of core must be reprocessed every 19.1 days of full-power operation.
This requires a chemical plant with a capacity of 9200 cu ft/yr, if the same
percentage load factor 1s assumed for both reactor and chemical plant.

A rough calculetion indicates that the required blanket or fertile stream
volume is between 2000 end 3000 cu ft for a system of reactors yielding
1000 Mw(E). . This volume is calculated on the basis of adequate coverage

of the reactor cores. However, if it is desired to keep the Pa absorbtion
down to 0.005, corresponding to a loss of breeding ratio of 0.01, then there
will have to be about 310,000 kg of thorium in the blanket system. Since
the blanket salt contains about 50 kg of thorium per cubic foot, this re-
quires a blanket volume of about 6200 cu ft. Thus the blanket volume can
be arbltrarily set to yield the desired Pa losses, and for this analysis,
6200 cu ft and 0.01 Pa loss is assumed.

The frequency of chemical processing of the blanket is set (aside from
economics) by the desire to keep the uranium inventory low and by the desire
to keep the fission-product buildup in the blanket small enough so that com-
plete reprocessing of the blanket will not be required frequently. A desir-
able goal is. to keep the U and Pa in the blanket down to 30% of the fuel
cdrcuit inventory. Reprocessing in sbout a 20-day cycle is required to accom-
plish this, and there is little benefit to faster processing because the Pa

holdup is limiting.

Processing at this rate will keep the U in the blanket circuit to about
one-tenth that in the core circuit, or about 60 kg. Since uranium has =
about fifty times the neutron cross section of thorium, and since there

 

 
o

10

are about 300,000 kg of Th in the blanket, there will be about one percent
as many U absorptions as thorium absorptions in the blanket. Thus after
ebout %en burnups of the core, the fission product level in the blanket will
give ebout a one percent poison there. At an 80% load factor, this would be
‘after about 6.5 yr. Thus, in & 20-yr life, the fission-product poison level
in the blanket might rise to 3% poison, and complete reprocessing of the
blanket salt should be considered at that time.

The estimate of costs for chemical processing of the fuel and blanket at
the above rates (9200 cu ft per yr for the fuel and 113,000 cu ft per yr
for the blanket salt) is based on a report by Weinrich and Associates to
ORNL on "Process Design and Estimated Costs of Chemical Plants for Process-
ing Molten Salt Fuels". The larger plant estimated by them had a cepacity
of 10,000 cu ft per yr of fuel salt, which is about the size required here
for the fuel salt circuit. For the fuel processing plant, Weinrich and
Associates estimate a cost of $3,455,000, plus about £1,500,000 of shared
facilities with the reactor plant. Crude adjustments to these figures made
by Oak Ridge personnel revised them upward to a total of about $9,830,000.

A much cruder estimate has been made of the additional plant cost to provide
for the rapid fluorination of the blanket salt. This was made by assuming
that multiplying the cost of the portion of the plent involved in fluorina-
tion of the core salt and UF), recovery by five would give a plant of eleven
times the capacity. On this assumption, the complete chemical plant for
treatment of both core and blanket salts would cost about $18,000,000 for
the 1000-Mw(E) plent. At a 29% annual charge and an 80% load factor, the
cost of the chemical plant, together with its operation, would be about
0.75 mill/kwhr.

The total inventory of uranium end protectinium in the reactor system is
estimated as follows:

In reactor fuel : 575 kg
In blanket 180 kg
In chemical processing 30 kg
In storage : 60 kg

 

Total = 845 kg

The uranium inventory at §15/g is $12,680,000, or #12.70/kw. At 4% this

is 0.07 mill/kwhr, or at 12%, it is 0.22 mill/kwhr. The blanket and core
salts, including thorium inventory, will cost about $25,000,000, or £25/kv..
At 14% per year and 80% load factor, this amounts to 0.5 mill/kwhr. With ea
net breeding ratio of 1.06, there would be 52.5 kg of fissionable uranium

 
»

»

a

11

produced per year, which would yield about £790,000/yr or about 0.11 mill/kwhr.
Thus the total fuel cycle cost would be about 1.2 mills/kwhr on the basis of
present uranium use charges.

It is obvious that considerable savings in fuel cycle cost can be made by
sacrificing doubling time. It is probable that if a breeding ratio of 1.00
vere satisfactory, at least half of the salt and thorium inventory charge
could be avoided and the chemical plant charges would be considerably reduced,
probably by at least one-third. Thus, & hold-own breeder might have power
costs as much as 0.5 mill/kvhr less than the doubling reactor.

In this analysis of chemical processing, only processes on which there 1s

a fair amount of laboratory date have been considered. With the fluid blanket,
an easy means of removing Pa 1s being sought. If it is found, then the blanket
holdup will be reduced, and the thorium inventory cen be reduced appreciebly.

IV. Performance as & Breeder

A number of grephite-moderated molten-salt reactor configurations have been
subjected to multigroup nuclear celculations with the Cornpone and Sorghum
codes.* The criticality calculations cen be correlated quite well if one
plots the concentration of uranium in the core against the carbon absorptions
in the core. This is done in Fig. 4 (ORNL-IR-Dwg. 42240). The plot shown
comes from reactors of equivalent spherical core diameters of 3 ft, L ft,

5 ft and 14 ft. The fuels in the core have thorium concentration of 1 mole %
ThF), U4 mole $ ThFy, 7 mole % ThFy, and 15 mole % ThFh, and the volume frac-
tion’of fuel represented in the various calculations of 10%, 12.5%, 15%,
18.3% and 20%. It includes calculations of both the initial state of the
reactor with pure U-233 and the state achieved after 20 yr of operation with
a near equilibrium mixture of U-233 and U-235. Although the relationship is
not mathematical, there is a good empirical fit and the curve can be used
with fair confidence in predicting the uranium concentration required in the
fuel salt. For the reference system with & 15 vol % fuel fraction in the
core and 0.04 neutron absorption in carbon, the concentration of fissionable
uranium required in the fuel salt is 1.2 kg per cu ft.

This figure, combined with the number of 5.2 Mw per- cu ft developed in

Section II sbove, yields a specific power in the fuel stream of 4.33 Mw/kg.

The chemical processing and blanket holdups of fuel lead to a total fission-
able uranium inventory of 845 kg, ae described in Section III, so that the
over-all specific power is 2.96 Mw(th)/kg.

The effective value of eta for the fuel mixture will depend on the thermality
of the spectrum, which ig related elso to the carbon absorptions per ebsorption
in fissionable uranium. At 0.0L ebsorption in carbon, the value of eta for the
isotope mixture is sbout 2.22, based on & thermal velue of 2.28 for U-233.

From the nuclear caleulations cited above, one can correlate the neutron absorp-
tions in the carrier sslt in the core with the absorptions in carbon. This is
done in Fig. 5 (ORNIL-IR-Dwg. 42239). The volume fraction of carrier salt is 20%,
comprised of 15% for the fuel and 5% for the fertile stream, so that the absorp-
tions in the carrier salt in the core are 0.0% for carbon ebsorption of 0.0L.

As described in the preceding section, the reference chemical processing plant
provides for keeping the variable fission-product poison fraction down to 0.01,
and the Pa losses (2 x absorptions) down to 0.01. Uranium-236 will, of course,
build up from radiative captures in U-235. With a breeding ratio of 1.06, the
removal of U-236 by the salé of excess fuel will approximately equal the removal
by neutron absorptions, so that the U-236 poison will be approximately 0.01. The

" neutron losses to saturable non-volatile fission products will be about O. 006, end

if Xe-135 losses can be kept to 0.004, the total saturable fission-product losses
will be limited to 0.01. To keep the Xe-135 losses to 0.004 requires its removal
on a time eycle of about 6 minutes. The off-gas system can be designed to accom-
plish this by bypassing 2% of the pump flow through a degasser. This was the
degassing bypass flow in the ART pump.

Other neutron losses are estimated to be 0.03 in the blanket salt, 0.003 for

delayed neutrons, and 0.002 for leakage. Considering the efficiency of the

fluoride volatility process, 0.005 may be adequate for chemical processing
losses. Fission-product pickup by the graphite, assuming that the fuel tubes
soak up <0. 5¢ by volume of fuel, gives a negligible loss unless there is pre-
ferential Tission-product absorption.

The total neutron losses now add up to about 0.16, which subtracted from an
ete of 2.22 yields a net breeding ratio of 1.06. ‘1t should be noted that
higher breeding ratios can be obtained by decreasing the volume fraction of
fuel in the core and by increasing the urenium-to-carbon ratio in the core.
However, these both lead to higher uranium inventories and consequently no
great improvement, if eny, in doubling time. Furthermore, if thermal eta for
U-233 is 2.29, as is believed in Oak Ridge, instead of the 2.28 assumed, the
breeding ratio is improved by nearly one point. With an over-all breeding

ratio of 1.06, the doubling time ie sbout 13 yr of full-power operation.

V. Feasibility and Cost of Molten-Salt Reactors

The basic feasibility of molten-salt reactors has been discussed in a section
of the book "Fluid Fuel Reactors”. This and later information have been

reviewed by the Fluid Fuel Reactors Task Force, and it was the concensus of the
group that, with minor exceptions, the feasibility of the molten-salt reactor
was established as far as materials compatibility and handling is concerned.

These exceptions concern the pickup of fuel salt by the graphite and the possible
precipitation of UO2 by gasee adsorbed on the graphite. Since the time the Fluid

Fuels Task Force met, the results of a one-year circulating salt loop containing
graphite and of graphite impregnation studies have shown that the graphite is
steble in contact with the salt, and that there are varieties of graphite that
will soak up less than 0.2% by volume of fuel salt, It has also been found possi-
ble to prevent UO2 precipitation by pretreatment of the graphite.

The Fluid Fuel Reactors Task Force further expressed doubt as to the economic
maintenance of fluid fuel reactors in general. For the molten-salt reactor,
this can be answered finally only in a reactor experiment, which has been pro-
posed. In the meantime, good progress has been made in devising suitable main-
tenance procedures for one type of reactor construction.

Since the time of the task force, the design effort on molten-salt reactors has
been directed toward breeder reactors that take advantage of the compactness
that 1s possible as a result of the high temperature and good heat transfer pro-
perties of molten salts. Most of the designs developed have a compact primary
system, such as that described in Appendix I and illustrated in Fig. 6. In
these designs, the entire primary fuel circuit is contained inside a reactor
vessel. With this construction, a parallel comparison with solid-fuel-element
reactors is evident, in which the tubes of the primary heat exchangers of the
salt reactor are compared to the fuel tubes in the core of a solid-fuel-element
reactor; both contain fuel, both constitute the primary heat exchanger surface,
and in each case they are contained within the primary reactor vessel enclosure.
In a similar way, the pumps for eirculating the fuel are compared to the control
rod mechanisms (and fuel shuffling mechanism for the fast reactor). Both involve
moving parts inside the reactor enclosure, and the pump, though bulky, is cer-
tainly simpler. Maintenance of pump and heat exchanger in the salt system is

by overhead withdrawl and replacement, and the operations required are comparable
to those required for the replacement of core assemblies and repair of control
mechanisms in the reactors with solid fuel elements, particularly those cooled
with sodium. There is thus no reason to expect maintenance costs for the MSR

to be higher than, say, for the fast reactor.

As for capital costs, the higher temperature of the heat source and the very -
high heat capacity per unit volume of the salt (approximately k.h times that
of sodium) lead to compactness of the entire system. The following table com-
pares pertinent factors of complexity and heat transfer with four reactors
using a sodium coolant. Comparing the MSR primary heat exchanger with the
reactor cores, it is simpler by virtue of having fewer tubes, and has about
the same efficiency as the fast reactors in terms of surface area.

The avoidance of an intermediate heat exchanger for the MSR, possible because
there is no violent water reaction and because the induced radioactivity is
very short lived; is a further factor reducing capital cost. In the steam
»

in

generstor portion, the higher temperature of the salt coolant gives an
advantage by about a factor of two.

The last two rowe of the table indicate how the high heat capacity of the
salt, even using a conservative bulk AT, can reduce the pump capacity end
system piping requirements by at least a factor of two.

On the basis of this analysis, even after allowing for the high cost of INOR-8
and of the salt coolant, the capital costs of a molten-salt reactor should be
less than for the sodium-cooled reactors.

The most careful cost estimates of molten-salt reactor construction have
been made by G. D. Whitman and are included in: (1) ORNL 2634; (2) ORNL-
CF-59-1-26; and (3) ORNL 2796. The three cases include two power reactors
of 640- and 860-Mw (thermal) capacity, and an experimental reactor of 30-Mw
capacity. A reasonable extrapolation of these costs to the 2500-Mw (thermal)
station required for 1000 Mw(E) yields capital costs of from $170 to #200
per kw. This estimate 1s for a first plant, but does not include development
costs. When these capital costes are combined with the fuel cycle costs esti-
mated in Section IIT of 1.2 Mw/kwhr end a reasonable operation and mainten-
ance estimate of 1 mill/kwhr, one gets a power cost in the neighborhood of

6 mills/kwhr for the first such large breeder reactor plant. Presumably one
could expect lower coste than this as a result of prior prototype reactor
construction and operation. It is difficult to attempt to prediet ultimate
costs, however, until experience -has been had with at least an experimental
reactor.

Subject: Volumes and Pressure Drops for Molten Salt Breeder Reactors

The following teble is a comparison of two reactor sizes, each with two flow
velocities in the external piping.

The heat exchanger has been designed on the basis of 0.300 in. inside diameter

x 0.035 in. wall tubing in a L45° helix, with adjacent coils wound opposite hand.
Fuel temperatures are taken as 1275 and 10759F; coolant temperatures as 1150

and 10009F. The use of 1/4 in. ID x 5/16 in. OD tubing would decrease the heat
exchanger length by 21%, increase the number of tubes by 50%, and increase the.
diameter by about 15%. The fuel volume external to the core would be reduced

by about 10%, which might overweigh the problems introduced by the other changes.

The fuel volume might be reduced by considering the entire flow in the center of
the heat exchanger as "pump suction” and using a higher flow velocity. This would
be about 10% of the fuel outside the core for the higher flow rate cases.

The attached sketch (Fig. 6) is approximately to scale for the smaller reactor
with 20 ft per second fuel -veloéity in thé piping.
