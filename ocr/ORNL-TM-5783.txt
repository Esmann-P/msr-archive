REACTOR MATERIALS IN MOLTEN FLUORIDE SALTS

J. R. Keiser

ABSTRACT

This report summarizes the molten fluoride salt compatibility
studies carried out during the period 1974-76 in support of
the Molten-Salt Reactor Program. Thermal-convection and forced-
circulation loops were used to measure the corrosion rate of
selected alloys. Results confirmed the relationship of time,
initial chromium concentration, and mass loss developed by
previous workers. The corrosion rates of Hastelloy N and
Hastelloy N modified by the addition of 1-3 wt 7% Nb were well
within the acceptable range for use in an MSBR.

INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report is to summarize the corrosion studies
carried out for the Molten-Salt Reactor Program during the period
September 1974 through May 1976. These studies were intended to determine
the corrosion resistance of potential Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor contain-
ment vessel materials in molten fluoride salt. The nickel-base alloy
Hastelloy N was used successfully for the containment vessel of an
experimental molten-salt reactor, the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment.
However, the discovery of irradiation embrittlement and grain boundary
embrittlement by the fission product tellurium led to a program to
develop an alloy that would be sufficiently resistant to the conditions.
To ensure that any new or modified alloy would have a high resistance
to corrosion by the fluoride salt, salt-metal corrosion studies were
made. Materials investigated include Hastelloy N, chromium and niobium
modifications of Hastelloy N, Inconel 601, and type 316 stainless steel.
The stainless steel was tested in LiF-BeF, (65-35 mole %), and the other
alloys were tested in MSBR fuel salt, LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,

(72-16-11.7-0.3 mole %).
po

Previous reserachers!’? have measured the corrosion resistance of
Hastelloy N and two types of stainless steel in various fluoride salt
mixtures. Their work has shown a multicomponent alloy is corroded by
the oxidation and removal of the least noble component. For Hastelloy N,
the least noble component is chromium. Fluoride salts can oxidize
chromium by reaction with impurities in the salt such as HF, NiF,, and
FeF, and by reaction with constituents of the salt. Impurity reactions

expected are

2HF + Cr = CrFs + Hs (1)

and

FeF, + Cr = CrF,; + Fe . (2)

The salt constituent UF, can give the reaction:

2UF, + Cr = CrF, + 2UF;3 . (3)

If salt containing UF, and a small amount of impurities is put into
a Hastelloy N system in which the salt circulates nonisothermally,
chromium will initially be removed from all parts of the system because
of reaction with both impurities and UF4. The impurity reactions are
expected to go to completion fairly rapidly so that they will have an
effect only on the short-time corrosion results. On the other hand,
since the equilibrium constant for reaction (3) is a function of tempera-

ture, this reaction provides a means for the continuous transfer of

Tne amount of chromium, AY, removed from a unit area of surface can be

shown to be:

where B is a temperature-~dependent constant, J; is the initial concentra-
tion of chromium in the alloy, and I’ is the diffusivity of chromium in
the alloy. The limiting step for this mass transfer has been shown

to be the diffusion of chromium in the metal when Hastelloy N is the
alloy considered. If other strong fluoride formers — such as Ti, Xb,

or Al — are present in the alloy, mass transfer of these elements would

be expected to occur by the same mechanism as discussed above,

EXPERIMENTAL METHODS

Our corrosion studies have been carried out in five thermal-
convection loops and one forced-circulation loop. Figures 1 and 2
show schematic drawings of these loops. These loops circulate salt
around a system across which a temperature gradient is maintained. For
most of these loops the temperature limits were maintained at 704 and
566°C (1300 and 1050°F), the proposed maximum and minimum temperatures
for the fuel salt of an MSBR. Other important features of these loops
are the removable corrosion specimens and the accesses to the salt to
permit insertion of electrodes for controlled-potential voltammetry.
Voltammetric measurements, which were made by members of the Analytical
Chemistry Division, allowed us to make on-line determinations of the
oxidation potential and corrosion product concentration of the salt.
Detailed explanations of voltammetry are available elsewhere."

The operating conditions for each of the loops are described in Table 1.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Thermal-Convection Loop 21A

Hastelloy N loop NCL 21A was the first loop to be put into operatiwva
when the Molten-Salt Reactor Program was resumed in 1974. As such, the
loop was used to obtain base-line corrosion data for Hastelloy N and to
provide a test bed for voltammetry measurements of MSBR fuel salt. The
voltammetry results showed that the oxidation potential as reflected
by the U(IV)/U(II[) ratio remained quite high throughout the 17.5 months
of operation. In fact, with a U(IV)/U(III) ratio of about 10" loop 214A
contained the most oxidizing salt of all the loop experiments.

The first specimens used in this loop were made of Hastelloy N
and were removed for examination about every 2500 hr. Figure 3 shows
the weight change as a function of the exposure time for these specimens
for up to 10,000 hr in salt. From this figure the rate of the weight
change clearly decreased with time. Figure 4 shows that the change

in weight varies as the square root of time, as predicted from Eq. (4).

Specimens that had been exposed for 7500 hr in the hottest and coldest
parts of the loop were examined metallographically. As is evident in
Fig. 5 the pitting on the higher temperature specimen was limited to
about 5 um, indicating that the effect of the salt was relatively mild.
Following the 10,000-hr exposure of standard Hastelloy N, loop 21A
was used to test specimens of 1%-Nb-modified Hastelloy N (experimental
heat 522). Only a short exposure was achieved with these specimens
before a power supply malfunction terminated the experiment, but the
short-time corrosion results (Table 2) compare very favorably with

results for standard Hastelloy N.

Polythermal Loop Systems II. A Solid State Diffusion Mechanism With

10

Thermal-Convection Loop 23

The observation that the high-chromium alloy Inconel 601 (23 wt Z Cr)
resisted intergranular attack by tellurium led to the construction of a -
thermal-convection loop to determine how severe the corrosion by MSBR
fuel salt would be. After the new loop was filled with salt, voltammetric
techniques were used to follow the change in the U(IV)/U(III) ratio
as an indication of the extent of the initial reaction between chromium
and UF,. The U(IV)/U(III) ratio decreased very rapidly, dropping to
about 40 within a few days, meaning that considerable reaction was
probably occurring between the salt and this Inconel 601 loop. Inconel
601 specimens exposed 721 hr all showed a weight loss, and that shown
by the hottest specimen was very large (>30 mg cm™2 year~!). Furthermore,
the material lost by the hottest specimens was not removed uniformly from
the surface, but resulted in the formation of the porous surface structure
shown in Fig. 6. As shown in Fig. 7, electron microprobe examination
of this specimen showed high thorium concentration in the pores. Since
the only known source of thorium was the ThFy contained in the salt, the
salt likely penetrated the pores. Continuous line scans made with the
microprobe for the elements Ni, Cr, and Th, shown in Fig. 8, clearly show
the depletion of chromium near the surface. These results provide
further evidence of the presence of thorium in the pores. Diffusion
calculations provide another piece of evidence indicating that salt
must have penetrated the pores. Based on the bulk chromium concentration
of 23 wt Z, microprobe measurements’ determined a chromium concentration
of 6.6 wt Z at the surface of the specimen in Fig. 6. From these concentra-
tions, a depletion depth of 80 ym taken from Fig. 8, and diffusion values
taken from Evans, Koger, and DeVan,® we calculate that the exposure time
would have to be nearly 1000 times greater to attain this concentration
profile as a result of bulk diffusion alone at 704°C. To obtain this .

profile with an exposure time of 721 hr the exposure temperature would
have to be about 1000°C, nearly 300°C higher than it was. Thus, to
establish the gradient that was observed, salt was most likely present

 

in the pores to provide a short-circuit path for removal of the chromium. .
Examination of a specimen from the coldest part of the loop revealed

surface deposits, shown in Fig. 9, which were identified by microprobe

analysis as chromium. The conclusion from this test is that Inconel 601

would be unsuitable for use in a molten-salt breeder reactor.

It is expected that the lower limit for the U(IV)/U(III) ratio

in an MSBR will be determined by the conditions under which the reaction
4UF; + 2C = 3UF4 + UC; (5)

proceeds to the right. Because the U(IV)/U(III) ratio of the salt

in loop 23 had decreased to less than 6, we decided to try to reproduce
the results of Toth and Gilpatrick,’ shown in Fig. 10, which predict

that UC, should be stable at the lowest temperatures that could be
maintained in this loop, 545-550°C. However, graphite specimens ex-
posed to the salt for 530 hr did not show any evidence of UC. Since

the specimens used were made of pyrolytic graphite, the high density of
the material likely limited contact of the salt and graphite. The exper-

iment was repeated by exposing a less dense graphite for 530 hr,

then checking the graphite surface for the presence of a new phase by
x-ray diffraction. A new phase was found, and it was tentatively identi-
fied by 0. B. Cavin as UO;. If indeed this compound was UO, it probably
resulted from a uranium fluoride-water reaction, but it could have come
from the hydrolysis of UC, that had been formed by reaction (5). On

the basis of information from L. M. Toth® that nucleation of UC, under
our operating conditions could be very slow, a longer exposure was
undertaken. Two specimens of the less dense graphite were exposed for
about 3000 hr at a minimum temperature of 555°C in salt in which the
U(IV)U/(III) ratio had dropped to about 4. However, x-ray analysis of
these specimens showed no evidence of a phase other than the salt and
graphite. No further investigations were carried out because of the

termination of the program.

Thermal-Convection Loop 31

 

Thermal-convection loop 31 is constructed of type 316 stainless steel,
has type 316 stainless steel specimens, and has been used for corrosion
measurements with one of the alternative coolant salts, LiF-BeF>
(66-34 mole %). For the first 1000 hr of operation this loop was used
to gather base-line corrosion data with as-received salt, which contained
a relatively high concentration of impurity FeF,. As shown in Fig. 11,
fairly significant weight changes occurred in the specimens, especially
during the first 500 hr. Metallographic examination of specimens from
the hottest and coldest positions showed, respectively, pitting and
deposition, as is apparent in Fig. 12. Electron microprobe examination
of the deposits indicated they were predominately iron, and we expect
that the deposition occurred as a result of reaction (2). Bulk salt
analyses and voltammetric measurement of the FeF; and CrF; concentrations
of the salt during the first 1000 hr support this idea.

To learn if addition of a reductant to the salt would decrease
the impurity level and consequently lower the corrosion rate, beryllium
was added to the salt. New specimens were then inserted, and the corrosion

rate was measured for stainless steel in this "reducing" salt. As long

as the beryllium rod was in the salt, the corrosion rate was extremely
low. This is shown in Fig. 11 for the first 500 hr after the addition

of beryllium. After removal of the beryllium, the specimen in the hottest
position showed a pattern of increasing weight loss as a function of

time. This most probably occurred because, once the source of beryllium
was removed, the species in the salt were no longer in equilibrium and

the salt became progressively more oxidizing with increasing time,
especially as moisture would leak into the system. Weight change results

for specimens exposed to the "reducing" salt are also shown in Fig. 11.

Thermal-Convection Loops 18C and 24

 

Hastelloy N loops 18C and 24 were used to determine the effect of
chromium concentration on the corrosion rate of Hastelloy N. Alloys
such as stainless steels and Inconels with a relatively high chromium
content had shown a resistance to grain boundary attack by tellurium
that seemed to be roughly proportional to chromium composition. However,
increasing the chromium content is, according to Eq. (4), expected to
increase the corrosion that will occur because of mass transfer, From
these tests and tellurium exposure tests we hoped to learn if there
is an optimum chromium concentration. Specimens were fabricated from
modified Hastelloy N alloys containing 7, 10, and 12% Cr. Each set of
specimens was exposed in one of the loops for a total of 1000 hr, with
weight change measured after 500 and 1000 hr. Within experimental error
the weight change results (Fig. 13) show the dependence on initial chromium
concentration that would be expected according to Eq. (4).

Following completion of the studies with the chromium-modified
alloys, loop 24 was used to measure the corrosion rate of 3.4%-Nb-modified
Hastelloy N. Results indicate a maximum corrosion rate of less than

2.20 mg cm—? year! for a 1500-hr exposure.

on Weight Change After 1000 hr in MSBR Fuel Salt.

Forced-Circulation Loop FCL-2B

Forced-circulation loop FCL-2B was used initially for fuel salt
chemistry investigations. The first fuel salt corrosion investigations
were made with standard Hastelloy N in salt with a U(IV)/U(III) ratio of
about 100. Thus, the most significant differences between this loop
and thermal-~convection loop 21A were the oxidation potential of the
salt [Vv10%? vs Vv10* in terms of U(IV)/U(III) ratio] and the velocity of
the salt 2.55 m/sec vs 1 m/min). If Eq. (4) and the ideas that led
to its development are correct, we would expect that (1) the only effect
of the low U(IV)/U(III) ratio in FCL-2B would probably be a reduction
in the initial corrosion compared with NCL 21A, and (2) the high salt
velocity would have no effect on mass transfer of chromium since the
limiting factor is the diffusion of chromium to the surface of the
alloy, not transfer of the chromium from the hot to the cold parts of the
system. The results of this study, shown in Table 3, indicate a very
low corrosion rate for the 4000-hr exposure. This test was interrupted
several times for repairs on the loop and for heat transfer measurements,

but that did not seem to have a detrimental effect on the results.
18

A 4000-hr corrosion test of Hastelloy N in fuel salt with a
U(IV)/U(III) ratio of 1000 was planned. Because of the decision to
terminate the Molten-Salt Reactor Program, we decided the remaining
operating time for this loop could be best spent measuring the corrosion
rate of 17-Nb-modified Hastelloy N, an alloy that had shown good resistance
to tellurium attack. Accordingly, a set of such specimens was prepared
and inserted into the loop. Because of loop cperating difficulties some
of the weight changes measured after 500 and 1000 hr were of questionable
value. Measurements made after 1500- and 2200-hr exposure were of good
quality and are summarized in Table 3 along with some of the 500- and
1000-hr results. Included in this table for comparison are the results
for the standa~d Hastelloy N specimens exposed for 4309 hr in this same
salt and loop. Tt should be noted that the niobium-modified specimens
gained more weight than they lost. This is most probably due to mass
transfer of iron from the standard Hastellov I tubing, which contains
about 5 wt 7 Fe, to the modified alloy, which has essentially no iron.
Taking into account the value at which the corrosion rate of the modified
Hastelloy N seems to be leveling out, we expect that the corrosion resis-
tance of the 1%Z-Nb-modified Hastelloy N is at least as good as that of

standard Hastelloy N.

CONCLUSIONS

The following conclusions can be drawn from this work.

1. Voltammetry provides a very convenient means for on-line
measurement of the oxidation potential and impurity concentration of
the salt.

2. Inconel 601 would probably not have sufficient corrosion
resistance to be acceptable for use as a containment vessel material.

3. No evidence of the formation of uranium carbide was found
in studies of the reaction of graphite with very reducing salt.

4. Weight loss of Hastelloy N specimens occurred as a linear
function of the square root of the exposure time indicating diffusion-
controlled corrosion.

5. Type 316 stainless steel has a high initial corrosion rate
in as-received Li,BeFy, but has a very low corrosion rate when beryllium
is added to the salt.

6. Alloys of Hastelloy N modified by the addition of chromium
showed weight losses proportional to the chromium concentration.

7. Limited results indicate that the corrosion rates of 1- and
3.4%-Nb-modified Hastelloy N are at least as good as that of standard

Hastelloy N.
