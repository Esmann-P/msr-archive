THERMAL-STRESS AND STRAIN-FATIGUE ANALYSES OF THE
MSRE FUEL AND COOLANT PUMP TANKS

C. H. Gabbard
Abstract

Thermal-stress and strain-fatigue analyses of the MSRE
fuel and coolant pump tanks were completed for determining
the quantity of cooling air required to obtain the maximum
life of the pump tanks and to determine the acceptability of
the pump tanks for the intended service of 100 heating cycles
from room temperature to 1200°F and 500 reactor power-change
cycles from zero to 10 Mw.

A cooling-air flow rate of 200 cfm for the fuel pump tank
was found to be an optimum value that provided an ample margin
of safety. The coolant pump tank was found to be capable of
the required service without air cooling.

Introduction

The fuel pump for the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment?! (MSRE) is a
sump-type centrifugal pump composed of a stationary pump tank and volute
and a rotating assembly (see Fig. 1). The pump tank and volute, which
is constructed of INOR-8 (72% Ni, 16% Mo, 7% Cr, 5% Fe), is a part of the
primary containment system, and therefore the highest degree of reli-
ability is required. The pump is similar to other high-temperature
molten-salt and liquid-metal pumps that have accumulated many thousands
of hours in nonnuclear test-loop service.? Although these nonnuclear
pumps have been highly successful, they have not been subjected to the
degree of thermal cycling which may occur in a nuclear plant. It there-
fore cannot be assumed from the operating records that pumps of this type
will be adequate for the MSRE.

Stress calculations¥* were completed in accordance with the ASME
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code for determining the wall thicknesses and

nozzle reinforcements required to safely withstand an internal pressure

of 50 psi. In addition to these pressure stresses, the fuel pump tank
will be subjected to relatively high thermal stresses because of the high
thermal gradients which will be imposed by nuclear heating and the large
temperature difference between the top flange, which will be at 250 to
300°F, and the pool of molten salt in the tank, which will be at 1225°F.
Although the coolant pump will not be subjected to nuclear heating, there
will be a large temperature difference between the top flange and the
molten salt in the pump tank.

Since the ASME Pressure Vessel Code and Code Case Interpretations
do not adequately cover the design of a vessel at creep range tempera-
tures under relatively high cyclic thermal stress, the thermal stress

3 The Navy

evaluation was conducted under the rules of the Navy Code.
Code covers the design of pressurized-water reactor systems. The problems
of design in the creep range are not explicitly covered, but design cri-
teria are established for vessels subjected to thermal stress and cyclic
plastic strain. Thermal stresses are considered as transient in the Navy
Code and must be evaluated on a fatigue basis using the estimated maximum
nurbers of various operational cycles and Miner's accumulative damage
theorem as the design criteria.’

Automatic flow control of the cooling air to the upper pump tank
surface was initially proposed so that the temperature gradient on the
spherical shell would remain relatively constant at various operating
conditions. The complexity and possible lack of reliability of the auto-
matic control system made it desirable, however, to determine whether a
fixed alr flow could be used for all the operating conditions of the pump.

Calculations were therefore made for establishing the temperature
distributions, thermal stresses, pressure stresses, and permissible num-
ber of operational cycles for various modes of operation and various
cooling air flow rates. From this information, it was possible to select
operating conditions that would permit the maximum number of operational
cycles and provide an ample factor of safety above the 100 heating and

500 power-change cycles anticipated for the MSRE.
Calculational Procedures

Strain Cycles

Since thermal stresses are considered to be transient and in some
cases subject to relief by stress relaxation at operating temperatures,
they must be evaluated on a strain-fatigue basis, as required by the Navy
Code. Two types of strain cycles will occur during normal operation of
the pump:

1. heating and cooling when the reactor system is heated from room tem-
perature to operating temperature and returned to room temperature,
and

2. power-change cycles when the reactor power is raised from zero to 10
Mw and returned to zero.

The change in strain must also be considered for a loss-of-cooling
air incident in which the operating conditions would change from (1) re-
actor power operation at 10 Mw with design air flow to (2) operation at

10 Mw with no air flow to (3) zero power operation with no air flow.

Temperature Distributions

 

The initial step in the thermal-stress and strain-fatigue analyses
was to determine the temperature distributions in the pump tank for various
operating conditions based on the effects of internal healt generation,
conductive heat flow, convective and radiative heat transfer with the
salt, and cooling of the shielding plug and upper pump tank surface. The
generalized heat conduction code* (GHT Code) was used to obtain the tem-
perature distributions. During reactor power operation, the fuel pump
tank will be heated by gamma radiation from both the reactor vessel and
the fuel salt in the pump tank and by beta radiation from the fission-
product gases. The maximum gamma heat-generation rate during reactor
operation at 10 Mw was calculated* to be 18.70 Btu/hr.in.? at the inner
surface of the upper portion of the pump tank, giving an average heating
rate through the 1/2-in.-thick pump tank wall of 16.23 Btu/hr.in.?. The
gamma, heat-generation rate in the shielding plug above the pump tank

 

*Calculated by B. W. Kinyon and H. J. Westsik.
was calculated at increments of 1/2 in. based on an exponential decrease
in the heating rate. The beta heating, which varied from 4.80 to 22.22
Btu/hr-in.?, was estimated by distributing the total beta energy emitted
in the pump tank over the pump-tank surface exposed to the fission-product
gases (see Appendix A).

Preliminary calculations with the GHT Code indicated that controlled
cooling of the upper pump tank surface was necessary, not only to lower
the maximum temperature, but also to reduce the temperature gradient in
the spherical portion of the pump tank near its junction with the volute
support cylinder in order to achieve acceptable thermal stresses. These
calculations also predicted excessively high temperatures in the volute
support cylinder between the pump tank and the pump volute. These high
temperatures were caused by a series of ports in the volute support cylin-
der wall for draining the shaft labyrinth leakage back into the pump tank.
The drain ports were originally located at the bottom of the cylinder
and restricted the conduction of heat downward into the salt. The maxi-
mum temperatures were reduced to an acceptable level by centering the
drain ports between the pump tank and the pump volute so that heat con-
duction would be unrestricted in the both directions. Final temperature
distributions for zero power operation at 1200°F, zero power operation
at 1300°F, and 10-Mw operation at 1225°F were obtained for various cooling-
air flow rates by varying the effective outer-surface heat transfer coef-
ficient. Temperature distributions were also calculated for 10-Mw opera-
tion at 1225°F, zero power operation at 1200°F, zero power operation at
1300°F, and zero power operation at 1025°F without external cooling. The
method of obtaining the effective outer-surface heat transfer coefficients
for the various conditions is described in Appendix B. The pump tank and
volute support cylinder geometry considered in these calculations is

shown in Fig. 2.

Temperature Distribution Curve Fitting

Before the meridional and axial temperature distributions of the
pump tank can be used in the thermal stress equations, they must be ex-

pressed as equations of the following form (see p. 66 for nomenclature):

For the internal cylinder and the spherical shell, the GHT tempera-
ture distribution data were fitted to the equation by the use of a least-
squares curve-fitting program.’ For the external cylinder, manually fit
equations containing only the exponential terms were found to fit ex-
ceptionally well to within about 2.5 in. of the top flange, where exces-
sive errors were encountered. On the other hand, the least-squares-fit
equations containing all the terms fit very well in the vicinity of the
top flange but deviated near the cylinder-to-shell junction. A comparison
of the data obtained with the two fitting methods and the GHT data for
the external cylinder is shown in Fig. 3. Since the cylinder-to-shell
junction is considered to be the most critical area because of its high
operating temperature, the manually fit equations were used for the ex-
ternal cylinder. The points on Figs. 4 and 5 show the "fit" obtained for

typical sets of GHT temperature-distribution data.

Thermal -Stress Analysis

In order to calculate the thermal stresses, the pump tank and volute
support cylinder were considered to be composed of the following members,
as shown in Fig. 2:

the spherical shell, cylinder "A,"

An Oracle program* was used to obtain the pressure stresses, the
stresses from the axial load on the cylinder, the thermal stresses re-
sulting from temperature gradients in either or both cylinders, and any
combination of these loadings. The Program assumes that the sphere is
continuous (i.e., has no boundary other than the cylinder junction) and
is at zero temperature. The zero-temperature assumption required that
the temperature functions of the cylinders be adjusted to provide the
proper temperature relationship between the three members. The boundary
conditions for the ends of the two cylinders specified that the slope of

the cylinder walls was zero and that the radial displacements would be

10

equal to the free thermal expansion of the members at their particular
temperatures. It was recognized at the beginning that some degree of
error in the thermal-stress calculations would be introduced by the ab-
sence of a thermal gradient on the sphere; but in the cases where air
cooling was used to limit the gradient, the results were believed to be
reasonably accurate, Later calculations showed, however, that the
stresses were very sensitive to the temperature gradient on the sphere,
and therefore the Oracle code was used only to evaluate the pressure
stresses and the stresses from axial loads.

In order to calculate the thermal stresses, including the effects
of the thermal gradient on the sphere, it was necessary to substitute a
conical shell for the sphere. The angle of intersection between the cone
and cylinders was made equal to the equivalent angle of intersection on
the actual structure. This substitution was required because moment,
displacement, slope, and force equations were not available for thermal-
stress analysis of spherical shells with meridional thermal gradients.

Thermal stresses in the two cylinders and the cone were calculated
by the use of the equations and procedures outlined in refs, 6-9. In
order to evaluate the four integration constants required for each of
the three members, it was necessary to solve the 12 simultaneous equa-
tions which described the following boundary and compatibility conditions
of the structure:

Cylinder "A" at Volute Attachment. The slope of cylinder "A" was

 

taken as zero and the deflection as -aag , .
Cylinder "B" at Top Flange. The slope of cylinder "B'" was taken as

 

zero and the deflection as -a00 ; «

Cone at Outside Edge. The slope of the cone was taken as zero and

 

the meridional force was taken as zero.

Junction of Cylinder "A," Cylinder "B,'" and Cone. The summation of

 

moments was taken as zero; the summation of radial forces was taken as

mn

zero; the slopes of cylinder "A," cylinder "B," and the cone were taken
to be equal; and the deflections of cylinder "A," cylinder "B," and the

cone were taken to be equal.

In order to facilitate the solution of several cases and to reduce
the amount of time involved in calculating complete stress distributions,
an IBM 7090 program was written for the MSRE pump configuration. The
program calculates the temperature-dependent constants of the 12 simul-
taneous equations, solves the equations for the 12 integration constants,
and calculates the bending, membrane, and principal stresses at 65 loca-
tions. Up to 25 cases can be solved, and the number of cases to be
solved and the constants in the temperature distribution equations are

included as input data. A set of general input data is also required
15

that contains the left-hand members of the simultaneous equations and the
position functions tabulated in refs. 7 and 9.

A special test case with a uniform-temperature conical shell was
prepared for the IBM 7090 program to check the validity of substituting
the conical shell for the spherical shell and to obtain an over-all com-
parison between the results of the IBM and Oracle programs. The compara-
tive results are shown in Table 1 for the junction of the three members.
As may be seen, the cone stresses agreed satisfactorily at the junction
where they were a maximum. Deviations between the results of the two
programs at other meridional positions were not considered important for

the cases of interest.

Thermal-stress calculations were completed for the various operating

Strain-Cycle Analysis

 

In order to determine the optimum cooling-air flow rate and the life
of the pump tank, it was necessary to determine the allowable number of
each type of operational cycle (heating and power change) for each of
several cooling-air flow rates. If Py Psy sees P, are the anticipated
values for the various operational cycles and No» Nos coe N are the
allowable number of cycles determined from the thermal-stress and strain-

fatigue data, the "usage factor" is defined as > (p;/1,). A design air
16

flow can then be selected to minimize the usage factor and give the maxi-
mum pump-tank life,

The permissible number of each type of operational cycle is deter-
mined by comparing the maximum stress amplitude for each type of cycle
with the design fatigue curves. The maximum stress amplitude includes
the thermal stresses caused by meridional thermal gradients, the thermal
stresses caused by transverse thermal gradients, and the pressure stresses
caused by the 50-psi internal pressure.

A discussion of the various types of stresses (primary, secondary,
local, and thermal) and the effects of each on the design of the pump
tanks is given in Appendix D. A discussion of the procedure used in
determining the allowable number of cycles is presented, and the design

fatigue curves of INOR-8 are included.

pertinent operating conditions are shown in Figs. 4 and 5 for the fuel
and coolant pumps. The spherical shell meridional temperature distribu-
tions for the fuel pump at various cooling air flow rates and reactor

power levels of zero and 10 Mw are shown in Figs. 6 and 7.

Thermal Stresses

Typical thermal-stress profiles of the fuel pump at a cooling-air
flow rate of 200 cfm with the reactor power at zero and 10 Mw are shown
in Figs. 8 and 9; similar profiles of the coolant pump are shown in Figs.
10 and 11. The relatively high stresses at the top flange are believed
to be caused by the poor fit of the temperature equations in that area,
as shown in Fig. 3. The stress at the top flange was calculated to be
15 000 psi when the least-squares-fit temperature equation was used. It
was found, however, that this equation introduced stress errors at the
cone-to-cylinder junction, Therefore, the actual stress profiles along

the entire length of the external cylinder would probably be better

represented by a composite of the two stress profiles; that is, it would

be best to use the stress profiles from the manually fit temperature func-
tions near the junction and from the least-squares functions near the top
flange. Since the cone-to-cylinder junction is the more critical area

and since the stresses at the top flange do not limit the number of per-
missible strain cycles, the stresses from the manually fit equations were
used in completing the strain-cycle analysis. The cylinder is sufficiently
long that the temperature error at the top flange has a relatively small

effect on the stresses at the cylinder-to-shell junction.

operating condition for the desired number of heating and power-change
cycles. The results are based on the assumption of total stress relaxa-
tion at each operating condition and are therefore conservative. The
location of maximum stress intensity during the heating cycle is not
necessarily the same as the location of maximum stress range during the
power-change cycle. This also provides conservative results, since the
maximum strains for each type of cycle were added to determine the usage
factor, and the total strain at the actual point of maximum strain would
be less than the strain value used. Since the pump tank will safely en-
dure the desired number of heating and power cycles with this conservative
approach, it was not considered necessary to locate and determine the
actual maximum total strain. The coolant pump will operate at a lower
temperature than the fuel pump, so the stress relaxation during each
cycle will probably be incomplete and therefore a larger number of cycles
will be permissible. As shown in Table 4, the assumption of partial re-
laxation rather than total relaxation permits more than twice the number
of heating cycles. For the fuel pump, thermal-stress and plastic-strain
calculations were also made for the short 36-in.-diam cylinder connect-
ing the two torispherical heads. The permissible number of cycles at
this location was found to be greater than those shown in Table 2, and,
therefore, the cycles in the cylinder do not limit the life of the pump
tank,

Pressure and Mechanical Stresses

 

The results of the pressure stress calculations made with the Oracle
program are shown in Figs, 12 and 13, The stresses, which include both
primary and discontinuity stresses, are for a pressure of 1.0 psi and are
directly proportional to pressure. The maximum stress from the axial
load exists at the suction nozzle attachment and is equal to 1.766 times

the load in pounds.
Recommendations

The strain-cycle data of Tables 2, 3, and 4 indicate that the de-

sired number of strain cycles on the fuel pump can be safely tolerated

when any cooling alr flow between 100 and 300 cfm is used; and, there-
fore, the air cooling can be controlled manually by a remotely operated
control valve. A cooling-air flow rate of approximately 200 cfm is recom-
mended for the following reasons:

1. The predicted usage factor is reasonably near the minimum value.

2. There is a wide range of acceptable flow rates on either side
of this design air flow rate.

3. At air flow rates greater than 200 cfm, the maximum stress in-
tensity during zero power operation increases relatively rapidly and de-
creases the permissible number of heating cycles.

Since there is a possibility of error in the temperature distribu-~
tion calculations because of uncertainties in the heat generation rates
and heat transfer coefficients, it is recommended that the temperature
gradient on the spherical shell be monitored by using two thermocouples
spaced 6 in. apart radially. This gives the maximum temperature dif-
ference between the two thermocouples and therefore reduces the effect
of any thermocouple error. Since the thermal gradient of the spherical
shell near the junction is of primary importance in determining the ther-
mal stresses, the differential temperature measurements and the data of
Figs, 6 and 7 can be used to set the actual cooling-air flow rate on the
pump. This method has the disadvantage of requiring several adjustments
a8 the temperature and power level are raised to the operating point.

If direct measurement of the flow rate were possible minor adjustments
could be made after the system reached operating conditions. Since no
cooling-air flow measuring equipment is planned for the fuel pump at the
present time, a preoperational calibration of the cooling-air flow rate
versus valve position should be made to permit the approximate air flow
rate to be set prior to high-temperature operation.

The design temperature difference between the two thermocouples for
monitoring the thermal gradient is 100°F at a power level of 10 Mw and
a thermocouple spacing of 6 in. The maximum allowable temperature dif-
ference is 200°F for 10-Mw operation. After the cooling-air flow rate
has been set for 10-Mw operation, a readjustment of the flow should be
made, if necessary, at zero power operation to prevent a negative thermal

gradient on the sphere. This adjusted cooling-air flow should then become
25

the operating value. During the precritical testing and power operation
of the reactor it should be kept in mind that any significant change in
the fuel pump cooling-air flow rate will constitute a strain cycle and
will represent a decrease in the usable life of the pump tank. Therefore,
an effort should be made to keep the number of cooling-air flow rate ad-
Justments to a minimum,

The effect of heating the system to 1300°F is also shown in Tables
2, 3, and 4. The fuel and coolant pumps can safely endure only about
half as many heating cycles to 1300°F as to 1200°F. For the coolant
pump, 100 heating cycles to 1300°F would essentially consume the life of
the pump tank. At 1300°F the assumption of total stress relaxation is
realistic, and no additional conservatism should be claimed by its use.
Therefore, it is recommended that the system not be heated to 1300°F on
a routine basis.

Since the fuel and coolant pump tanks are primary containment mem-
bers, the maximum value of the usage factor must not exceed 0.8, which
is the acceptable upper limit. To avoid exceeding this limit, an accu-
rate and up-to-date record should be maintained of the usage factor and
the complete strain cycle history of both the fuel and the coolant pumps.
In calculating the usage factor, partial power-change cycles in which
reactor power is increased only a fraction of the total power should be
considered as complete power cycles unless the number of partial cycles
is a large fraction of the total when a pump tank has passed through the
permitted number of cycles. In this case, additional thermal stress
calculations should be made to determine the proper effect of the partial
cycles,

Although the strain-cycle data Indicate that the coolant pump is
acceptable for the specified number of strain cycles, the stress intensity
is uncomfortably high. The se stresses can be reduced by lowering the
thermal gradient on the spherical shell by using a reduced thickness of
insulation on the upper surface of the pump tank. Since nuclear heating
is not involved in the coolant pump, the proper amount of insulation can
best be determined on the Fuel Pump Prototype Test Facility, which is

presently under construction.
26

Conclusions

The strain-cycle analysis indicates that the fuel pump will be satis-
factory for the intended life of 100 heating cycles and 500 power-change
cycles if it is air cooled. No special cooling will be required for the
coolant pump. A conservative design is provided by the use of standard
safety factors in the strain-fatigue data and in the usage factor. Ad-
ditional conservatism of an unknown magnitude is provided by the assump-
tion of total stress relaxation at each operating condition and by the
fact that the actual maximum strain should be less than the calculated
maximum strain.

In addition to the safety factors outlined above, the fuel and cool-
ant pump tanks are capable of exceeding their required service life by
factors of 2.2 and 1.4, respectively, before the maximum permissible usage

factor is exceeded.

APPENDIX A
Distribution of Fission-Product-Gas Beta Energy

The total energy that will be released in the fuel pump tank by the
fission-product gases has heen reported® by Nestor to be 15 kw. This
energy will not be uniformly deposited on the surface area exposed to
gas, however, so it was necessary to determine its distribution over the
surfaces of the pump tank. The pump tank was assumed to be of straight
cylindrical geometry, as shown in Fig. A.l, and the distribution of the
energy flux at the cylindrical walls was calculated as outlined in the
following sections. The distribution of energy to the upper surface was
approximated by assuming a distribution similar to that for the outside

wall.

Energy Flux at Pump Tank Outer Surface

 

It was assumed that there was no self-shielding or shielding from
the volute support cylinder, and the line source (dy,dx) was integrated
over the enclosed volume (see Fig. A2)11 to obtain the energy flux ¢

APPENDIX B

Estimation of Outer Surface Temperatures and
Heat Transfer Coefficients

 

 

The GHT Code for calculating the complete temperature distribution
of the pump tank could not consider the effects of the flowing air stream
on the temperature distribution of the pump tank because of the tempera-
ture rise of the cooling air along the pump tank surface. In order to
obtain the temperature distribution, it was necessary to couple the pump
tank surface with the surroundings by use of an effective heat transfer
coefficient (h,.) and the ambient temperature. It was impractical to
obtain an effective coefficient at each point along the surface, and
therefore the value of ho was calculated at the cylinder-to-shell junc-
tion, where the thermal stress problem was most severe, and then applied
over the entire upper surface of the pump tank.

The air-cooled upper portion of the fuel pump tank is shown sche-
matically in Fig. B.l. The pump tank is subject to thermal radiation
and convection heating from the fuel salt, fission-product beta heating,

and gamma-radiation internal heating. This heat is conducted to the

pump tank surface where it is transferred to the cooling air by two paths:
(1) direct forced convection to the cooling air and (2) radiation to the
cooling shroud and forced convection to the same cooling air. Heat is
also conducted parallel to the pump tank surface, but this heat transfer
is assumed to be zero in estimating the surface temperature and heat
transfer coefficients.

The temperature distribution through the pump tank wall can be calcu-
lated? as outlined below, assuming a constant gamma heat-generation rate

If the heat transfer from the outer surface is expressed by an ef-

The difficulty in calculating the outer surface temperature (6)
from Eq. (B.13) results from the fact that the heat transfer coefficients
he and bh, are highly temperature dependent, and 63 must be known before
accurate coefficients can be calculated. However, for a given set of re-
actor operating conditions, it is evident from the preceding equations

that the selection of an arbitrary value of 6, will result in a particular

value of the total heat transfer across the enter surface, and a particu-
lar value of he is required to dissipate this quantity of heat to the
surroundings. Since the temperature drop across the pump tank wall is
small for the cases of interest, 5 can be used to compute the value of
the internal surface heat transfer coefficient (he), and the value of
h,_ can then be calculated by Eq. (B.14).

The following procedure was used to estimate the effective outer
surface heat transfer coefficients for various cooling-air flow rates:

1. Values of h, versus inner surface temperature (6,) were calcu-

£

APPENDIX C

Derivation of Boundary and Compatibility Equations
for Thermal Stress Calculations

 

The procedures for calculating thermal stresses in cylinders and
cones are fully described in refs. 6 through 9. The general layout of
the pump tank structure and the sign convention used in the stress
analysis are shown in Fig. C.1l. The cone-to-cylinder joint 1s assumed
to be rigid. IT is necessary to evaluate four integration constants for
each of the three members by solving 12 simultaneous equations describing
the boundary conditions of the structure and the compatibility conditions
which interrelate the three members at their junction. Since the posi-
tion functions for cylinders are tabulated in ref. 8 only for positive
values of L, the cone-to-cylinder junction is made the origin and the

cylinder axis is assumed to be positive in either direction. This

assumption requires that the slope and the shear force equations be modi-
fied by a sign change to compensate for the reversed sign on one of the
cylinders,

Derivations of the 12 simultaneous equations from the specific
boundary or compatibility conditions are given below. The basic equa-
tions for moment, displacement, slope, and shear force were obtained from
ref. 6 for the cylinders and ref. 8 for the cone. The conical shell equa-
tions differ somewhat from those presented in ref, 8 because a prelimi-
nary version of the report was used that did not include the effects of
a thermal gradient through the wall. All the terms considering the ef-
fects of internal pressure and mechanical loading were omitted from both
the cylindrical and conical shell equations.

The following material constants, geometric constants, position con-

stants, and auxiliary functions are used in the boundary and compatibility

equations:

APPENDIX D

Explanation of Procedure Used to Evaluate the Effects of
Cyclic Strains in the MSRE Pumps

 

J. M. Corum

An essential difference in structural design for high-temperature
operation as compared with design for more modest conditions is the need
to consider creep and relaxation of the structural material. Many of the
methods and procedures presently specified as a structural design basis
in the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Unfired Pressure Vessels,
Section VIII, and in the preliminary design basis developed by the Navy’
become meaningless at high temperatures. Thus a revised design basis
must be formulated when high-temperature conditions are considered, The
operating program of any component must be examined, and the design basis
selected must be used to determine whether the number of operational cycles
which can be safely tolerated exceeds the number of the cycles which is
desired during the life of the component. If necessary, the number of
operational cycles of the component must be limited to the value which
can be safely tolerated. As may be seen, the details of the operating
program are extremely important and must be selected with considerable
care.

The concept of stress is used here as a convenience in discussing
the effects of cyclic strains because it is the principal variable in ;
conventional problems of elasticity. Properly, however, the discussion
should be in terms of strains when dealing with high temperatures and,
especially, in describing thermal effects in structures. With these
factors in mind, four general types of stresses were considered in es-
tablishing a design basis for the MSRE pumps which will operate at tem-
peratures within the creep and relaxation range; these are primary,
secondary, local or peak, and thermal. The primary stresses are direct
or shear stresses, developed by the imposed loading, which are necessary
to satisfy only the simple laws of equilibrium of external and internal

forces and moments. When primary stresses exceed the yield strength of
57

the material, yielding will continue until the member breaks, unless
strain hardening or redistribution of stresses limits the deformation,
Secondary stresses are direct or shear stresses developed by the con-
straint of adjacent parts or by self-constraint of the structure. Sec-
ondary stresses differ from primary stresses in that yielding of the ma-
terial results in relaxation of the stresses. Local or peak stresses
are the highest stresses in the region being studied. They do not cause
even noticeable minor distortions and are objectionable only as a pos-
sible source of fatigue cracks. Thermal stresses are internal stresses
produced by constraint of thermal expansion. Thermal stresses which in-
volve no general distortion were considered to be local stresses. Thermal
stresses which cause gross distortion, such as those resulting from the
temperature difference between shells at a Junction, were considered to
be secondary stresses.

In the present examination, four sources of stresses were considered.
Pressure differences across the shells will produce membrane pressure
stresses. These stresses are primary membrane stresses. The pressure
differences will also produce discontinuity stresses, which are secondary
bending stresses. Temperature gradients along the shells will produce
stresses which are due both to the temperature variations and to the dif-
ferential-expansion-induced discontinuities at the shell junctions. These
stresses are secondary bending stresses. Temperature gradients across
the walls of the shells will produce thermal stresses which are assumed
to be local stresses.

The ASME Code 1s generally accepted as the basis for evaluating pri-
mary membrane stresses, and the allowable stresses for INOR-8 at the op-
erating temperatures of the pumps were obtained from the criteria set
forth in the code, with one exception. A reduction factor of two-thirds
was applied to the stress to produce a creep rate of 0.1% in 10 000 hr
in order to avoid possible problems associated with the effect of irradia-
tion on the creep rate.* The maximum allowable stress at 1300°F is 2750

psi, and the primary membrane stresses were limited to this value. The

primary stresses were not considered further except from the standpoint ~~
of excessive deformations produced by primary plus secondary stresses.

In order to evaluate the effects of secondary and local stresses,
repetitive loading and temperature cycles must be considered because
fractures produced by these types of stress are usually the result of
strain fatigue. Data which give the cycles-to-failure versus the total
or plastic strain range per cycle may be used for studying cyclic condi-
tions. The total strain range per cycle is defined as the elastic plus
plastic strain range to which the member is subjected during each cycle,

The plastic strain range per cycle is the plastic component of the total

strain range per cycle. The strain-cycling information may be compared

with the calculated cyclic strains in the member. Since most formulas

express stress rather than strain as a function of loading or tempera- -
ture distribution, assuming elastic behavior of the material, it is con-
venient, as stated before, to transform the test data from the form of
strain versus cycles-to-failure to the form of stress versus cycles-to-
failure by multiplying the strain values by the elastic modulus of the
material, The resulting values have the dimensions of stress but, since
the tests were made in the plastic range, they do not represent actual
stresses.

When the analysis of stresses in a member reveals a blaxial or tri-
axial stress condition, it is necessary to make some assumption regarding
the failure criterion to be used. In the plastic range, where most of
the significant secondary and local stresses lie, there is no experimental
evidence to indicate which theory of failure is most accurate. There-
fore, it has been recommended’ that the maximum shear theory be used,
since it is a little more conservative and results in simpler mathemati-
cal expressions. The following steps used in developing the procedure
were taken from ref, 3:

1. Calculate the three principal stresses (oy, 02, 03) at a given
point,

2. Determine the maximum shear stress which is the largest of the

three quantities
1
5 (op =o)
5 (0, = 03)
oY
1
5 (0p — 03)

3. Multiply the maximum shear stress by two to give the "maximum
intensity of combined stress.”

4. Compare this quantity with the E Ac values obtained from uni-
axial strain-cycling tests.

Stated more simply, the procedure is to use the stress intensity
representing the largest algebraic difference between any two of the three
principal stresses.

The procedure outlined above for evaluating the effects of cyclic
loadings and cyclic thermal strains was used to examine the cyclic sec-
ondary and local stresses which will be produced in portions of the MSRE
pumps. The procedure is essentially that specified by the Navy Code;
however, the Navy Code was developed primarily for applications in which
the maximum temperatures would be below those necessary for creep and re-
laxation of the material. Thus, several of the steps outlined in the
Navy Code were modified for the present evaluation.

The assumption was made that the Temperatures were sufficiently high
and that the times at these temperatures were sufficiently long for com-
plete stress relaxation to occur, Thus the strains which the elastically
calculated stresses represented were taken as entirely plastic. On this
basis, strain cycling data in the form of plastic rather than total strain
range per cycle versus cycles-to-failure were used, Figures D.1l and D.2,
which give strain fatigue data for INOR-8 at 1200 and 1300°F, were ob-
tained from a limited number of strain-cycling tests performed by the
ORNL Metallurgy Division. The dashed curves were obtained from the plas-

tic strain range per cycle curves and represent a conservative estimate

of the total strain range per cycle. It was assumed that the material
exhibits perfect plasticity above the proportional limit (no strain
hardening), and the elastic strain at the proportional limit was added
to the plastic strain range at each point. The dashed curves were used
to obtain an estimate of the cycles-to-fallure, assuming that no relaxa-
tion or strain-hardening occurs, Strain hardening would displace the
dashed curves upward.

Figures D.3 and D.4, which give the stress amplitude versus number
of cycles for INOR-8 at 1200 and 1300°F with complete relaxation, were
derived from the solid curves for Figs. D.1l and D.2 by multiplying the
plastic strain range by E to obtain a pseudo stress range and then di-
viding by 2 to obtain the alternating stress. The dashed curves in Figs.
D.3 and D.4 represent the results of this operation. The solid curves
represent the allowable values of alternating stress and were constructed
by placing a factor of safety of at least 10 on cycles and a factor of
safety of at least 1.5 based on stress. The safety factor of 10 on cycles
is based on uncertainties in the calculations, scatter of test data, size
effects, surface finish, atmosphere, etc, These reduction factors are
less conservative than those specified by the Navy Code. However, they
have been used in high-temperature design for several years at ORNL, and
the current feeling of one of the originators of the Navy Code is that
the reduction factors specified in that document are over-conservative
and will be reduced to those used in this investigation.¥* Figures D.5
and D,.6 were obtained in the manner as Figs. D.3 and D.4 but were based
on total strain rather than plastic strain. They represent allowable
values of alternating stress if no relaxation occurs.

The life of a component undergoing cyclic strain depends on mean
strain as well as cyclic strain; however, for most applications in which
the loading is almost entirely due to thermal cycling and no severe
strain-concentrations exist, the effect of mean strain can be expected
to be secondary to that of cyclic strain. For these applications, cyclic

life can be determined directly from strain range computations.'® The

effect of mean strain is further reduced when gross relaxation takes place
during each cycle, as is expected in the present case. Thus for the MSRE
pump stress evaluation, the mean strain was assumed in all cases to be
zero, and the effect of cyclic stresses was determined directly from the
plots of the allowable alternating stress versus the number of cycles.

Each of the components examined will be subjected to several opera-
ting conditions. Since strains will occur that are beyond the elastic
limit, the structural evaluation was based on a finite life, and the
damaging effect of all significant strains was considered.

Suppose, for example, that the stresses produced by n different op-
erating conditions have been determined and that it has been found that

these stresses will produce values of S, which can be designated as

1t
515 5,5 cee S, It is also known that 51 is repeated Py times during the
life of the component, and Sy is repeated I times, etc. From Figs. D.3
and D.4 it is found that Ns Ns» AN N, are the allowable cycles for each

of the calculated stresses. The values p,/N,, P,/N,, ces p,/N, are called
cycle ratios because they represent the fraction of the total life which
is used at each stress value. As a first approximation, an application

might be considered satisfactory if

i=n

i
y §, < tO .
i=1

Fatigue tests have shown, however, that failure can occur at cumulative
cycle ratio summations different from unity. If the lower stress values
are applied first and followed by the higher stress values, the cycle
ratio summation at failure can be "coaxed" as high as 5. On the other
hand, if the most damaging stresses are all applied first, failure can
occur at cycle ratio summations as low as 0.6, or even lower. These are
extreme conditions and are based on low-temperature fatigue data which
may or may not be representative of behavior under strain cycling. For
random combinations, cycle-ratio summations usually average close to
unity. Therefore, 0.8 was used in the present evaluation as a conserva-

tive allowable limit.
65

It should be noted that in correctly applying any design criteria,
a point-by-point analysis must be made. That is, the complete operating
history for each single point must be examined. Short cuts may sometimes
be taken, but they must necessarily lead to overly conservative results.

In summary, the permissible cycles of each type were determined for
the MSRE fuel and coolant pumps by combining the secondary and local
stresses at each point. Points were then found which gave maximum values
for the "maximum intensity of combined stress.” These latter values were
divided by 2 to obtain the alternating stress. The allowable number of
cycles for each alternating stress were obtained from Figs. D.3 or D.4,
assuming complete relaxation. The cycle ratios were then obtained that
were based on the expected number of times each stress will be repeated,
and various combinations of the cycle ratios were summed at a particular
point and compared with the 0.8 limit. To investigate the increase in
life if no relaxation occurred, Figs. D.5 and D.6 were used in place of

Figs. D.3 and D.4.
