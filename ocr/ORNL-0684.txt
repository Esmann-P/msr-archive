THE ATOMIC-POWERED AIRCRAFT
JANUARY, 1950
PART I. CONCLUSIONS

There are now moderately good grounds for believing that a supersonié¢
airplane can be flown under uranium power. The most crucial questions out-
standing today are those of the achievable aerodynamic 11£¢-to-drag ratio
for a large supersonic craft, and the attainment of reactor materials for
high temperatures.

The nuclear power plant still poses many difficult unsolved problems.
However, for each of these problems two or three promising approaches to a
solution can now be sketched out. The number of puggible alternatives in
the design is great enough to suggest that feasible solutions will eventually
be found, in one way or another.

It is still much foo early for accurate prediction of the size and per-
formance of the first nuclear airplane. However, the chief possibilities
are discussed in the following sections, and some informed guesses can be
made. It seems likely that a manned craft, built as a single unit, could
be driven at Mach 1.0 at 60,000 feet altitude with a gross weight in the
350,000 - 450,000 pound range -- provided a lift-to-drag ratio of about 9.0
was available. The 0°35 content of the reactor might be in the neighborhood
of 200 pounds. The allowable non-stop flight, time at Mach 1.0 would be at
least 100 hours. The continuous holdup of fiseianable material in chemical
and metallurgical reprocessing might be kept as low as 100 pounds per flying

aircraft by special attention to the fuel element design. Of course the

 
/

logistics of running a squadron of nuclear aircraft would lead to the tie-up
of considerably more material than this in the complete operation. The out-

look on other operating characteristics remains about the same as discussed

in the Lexington Rerort.

|=
PART IT. BASIC EEACTOR DESIGN CRITERIA

The most important compromise to be adjusted in designing a nuclear
aircraft is the balance betwéen maximum reactor temperature and gross weight.
Every possible effort must be made to relieve the materials problems by
lowering the fuel temperature. Likewiss, the —_— weight must be kept as
low as possible to reduce the difficulties of reaching supersonic speeds.
These two factors usually oppose one another, since smaller shields mean
smaller core volumes and thus higher power densities. The design balance
should be struck at such a level that the materials difficulties are no
worse than the aerodynamics difficulties.

If the desired flight conditions, and the best achievable L/D and
machinery efficiency for those conditions, are fixed there still remain
two possibilities for lowering the fuel temperature assoclated with any
.gross weight. These are (a) to improve the heat transfer rate within the
core, so that the desired power density will not lead to such a high temp-
erature, and (b) to improve the shielding art, so that the weight of the
shield necessary for a given core size is decreased. It is for these reasons
that the most intensive development work on the nuclear aircraft is now being
applied toward better heat transfer systems, toward high temperature mater-

ials, and toward improved shields.

 

Heat Transfer Mechanisms:

The particular combination of fuel temperature and gross weight at
which the problems on both sides seem most easily manageable will strongly
depend on the heat transfer mechanism used, and will surely be different

for different mechanisms.
1. The first question affecting heat transfer is on the physical
state of the material in which the heat is inltially developed. If the
uranium is dissolved in a liquid, this liquid can be circulated outside
the restricted volume of the core and it will therefore not be necessary
to accomplish the heat transfer within this small volume at all. There
are of course a new group of difficulties brought into the picture by this
device, some of which are discussed in the following sections. One of the
important questions, for example, is the matter of the intermediate heat
exchanger somewhere in the shield which would now be necessary. The primary
circulating fluid will contain the intensely radicactive fission products
and so cannot ever be allowed to circulate completely outside of the shield.
If the heat exchanger between the primary circulating fuel and the secondary
fluid, possibly another liquid metal, can be so designed that embedding it
in the shield does not appreciably increase the shield weight, this system
will doubtless have much merit.

The circulating fuel arrangement has not yet been adequately explored,
but it certainly represents another alternative to the solid fuel gystems
which have been more usually discussed so far. It has the immense advantage
that radiation damage to the fuel elements is unimportant and that many of
the questions of thermal stress within the core likewise vanish. It is to
be noted that the really fundamental gain expected from the circulating fuel
arrangement 1s in the increased size of the heat transfer surface available.
Instead of having to transfer the heat from those surfaces which can be
placed within the small core volume, one can now expose surfaces of the
intermediate exchanger which is distributed throughout a presumably much

larger volume within the core. However, it is not yet at all certain that

Ion
A
there will be a net gain, since the maximum temperature allowable to the
intermediate heat exchanger materials may not be very high.

2. If the fuel is to remain in the core, then heat transfer between
gome solid and the circulating working fluid will be necessary within the
restricted core volume. It is this heat transfer process which then must
be run at the greatest feasible number of KW/cm? or BTU/sq ft/hr. Of course
the processes which will transfer the highest heat flux from a solid to a
fluid are probably of the type which cannot be used in the reactor applica-
tion. These would be such mechanisms as an explosive reaction occurring
at the solid wall, or the use of chemical dissociation or ionization pro-
cesses. Excluding such devices, the arrangement which would seem to permit
the highest heat flux at temperatures suitable for aircraft work would appear
to be convective heat transfer between the solid walls and a swiftly flowing
liquid metal. It ies true that the heat transfer properties of liquid metal
systems at high temperatures have not yet been investigated; however, the
measurements made so far, which have extended up to the neighborhood of
1200°F, all seem to Justify a fairly simple heat transfer formula. When
extrapolated to higher temperatures and flow velocities and larger film
drops, it seems to be a reasonable expectation that heat fluxes of the order
of 2 million BTU/sq ft/hr can be achieved with liquid metal working fluids.
The liquid metal cooled system is the type of aircraft reactor now recelving
the most intensive study by all laboratories inter#sted in the ANP Program.
The principal disadvantage is the probable difficulty of finding fuel wall
and piping materials which will stand the corrosive action of liquid metals
at the necessary temperature level. Some suggested sets of specifications

for a liquid metal cooled aircraft are listed in Part V.
SE
The liquid metal cooled aircraft reactor system has been discussed

in some detall on previous occasions where it was assumed that the system
would represent a binary cycle, i.e., the liquid flowing through the reactor
core would be led out through the shield to a radiator, where its heat would
be transferred to air passing through a turbojet. It is now beginning to
seem likely that no such binary system will prove feasible. There are at
least three reasons for suspecting that the liquid metal cycle, just as the
circulating fuel cycle, will require an intermediate heat exchanger located
within the shield, and will therefore be a ternary system. Reasons which

have been advanced for passing to ternary cycles are:

a. It is suggested that it will be impossible to prevent the
occurrence of radioactive impurities from the tube walls getting into
the primary coolant stream. Thus, the working fluid would carry redio-
active material outside of the shield even though the working fluid
itself was same relatively inert liquid such as bismuth.

b. The vulnerability of a binary liquid metal system to enemy
attack might be too great to be tolerated. However, if the unique
parts of the system -- the reactor core and its coolant -- were all
kept within the massive shield where they are relatively safe from
an enemy projectile, then it would be possible to have the several
external turbojet engines served by several independent secondary
fluid cycles, any one of which might be lost without jeopardizing the
reactor as a whole.

c. If it proved desirable to use bismuth or lead-bismuth as the
primary liquid metal coolant within the core, it would probably not be
feasible to circulate this (even if inert) to possibly a dozen separate

. turbojets scattered around the plane. The volume of bismuth necessary

"would add too much weight to the system. It might, therefore, be de-
sirable to transfer the heat within the shield to a lighter metal such
as ordinary lithium, or perhaps to a molten salt such as NaOH.

However, it may be noted that none of these three points has yet been ex-
haustively explored, and the binary liquid metal cooled system is not yet

completely excluded.

3. Another system of possibly equal heat trangfer capabilities to
the liquid metal system is one using 8 boiling fluid within the reactor
core. Such g& system has always been considered impossible for use within
a reactor. However, the question has never been settled experimentally and
there are growing grounds. for feeling that the subject should be re-opened.
It is true that this system, being such a radical departure from previous
reactor experience, wil bring with it a number of problems on which there
1s yet extremely meager experience. One should therefore only turn to the
boiling fluld systems if their capacity for coping with high heat flux seems
to be markedly higher. than that of flowing liquid metal, or if the liquid
metal systems prove impossible to manage from a materials standpoint.

The heat fluxes whith can be achieved between a solid wall and a
boiling fluid in high speed forced convection have never been adequately
explored in the laboratory. It is lmown that the nature of the solid sur-
Pace exercises a profound effect upon the boiling phenomena, and it would
probably be difficult to maintain constant surface conditions. The only
really extensive experience is on water ranging from normal boiling under
atmospheric pressure to boiling at pressures as high as 1400 psi or more.
With water at atmospheric pressure, the highest heat fluxes obtained are
in the neighborhood of 1/2 million BfU/sq ft/hr. This figure really applies
to natural convection; doubtless a high speed flow of the water would produce
much greater heat transfer rates than this. At rather high pressures, heat
fluxes of 2 million BryU/sq ft/hr have been achieved already. These fluxes
are comparable to the fluxes attainable with liquid metals at atmospheric
pressure. If, now, one changed from water to a suitable high boiling fluid,
it appears very likely that the heat transfer rate of liquid metals could be

matched without going to very great pressures in the system.

SEY
ann 10

The disadvantages of such a cycle are obvious. The material used
would be new and the boiling phenomenon is difficult to maintain in a smooth
steady state. The problem of controlling a nuclear reactor with even minute
fluctuations in the average core density has been discussed many times.

4, From the purely heat transfer standpoint, there seems little reason
to consider other liquid arrangements than the circulating fuel, the liquid
metal, or the boiling liquid systems. All other flowing liquids would yleld
lower heat transfer coefficients. However, there is some posgegibility of mak-
ing use of molten NaOH as primary coolant for the purpose of decreasing uran-
ium investment by the addition of hydrogen as a moderator. This would be
at the expense of increased gross weight because of the lower heat transfer,
and thus larger core volume and shield weight.

5. "Another liquid system which has hardly been explored at all is to
use a fluid within the reactor core which may be vaporized outside by re-
ducing the pressure and allowing it to run a vapor turbine. Such an arrange-
ment offers no improvement of the heat transfer properties of the core volume,
but it permits operation of the turbine at considerably lower fluid tempera-
tures and so permits lowering the temperature of the reactor materials even
without improving the heat transfer. So far, it has not appeared to be wise
to put much time on this cycle since the difficulties of devising efficient
turbine machinery for such an arrangement would be expected to outweigh the
gain from the reduced material temperatures. It is expected that such vapor
cycles will be explored only if the problem of reactor material temperatures
eventually turns out to be even more acute than it seems now.

6. Continuing in the direction of decreasing heat transfer coefficient,

the next step is to a compressed gas. Here, helium at some 2000 psi should
A n

be most suitable for aircraft work. This cycle has so far received insuffi-
cient attention. The survey in the Lexington Report suggested that even with
the decreased heat transfer rate of the goes as compared with liquid metal,
the resulting airplane still had a chance of matching the liquid metal gross
weight with no more than about 100°F increasé in fuel temperature. Such a
premium would be quite reasonable to pay for relief from materials corrosion
troubles. |

7. The system of lowest heat transfer coefficient is the opemn-cycle air
cooled reactor. Here, air is taken into the machine at ambient pressure and
compressed to popesibly 20 times this pressure before being sent inte the
reactor core. Although this heat transfer mechanism will lead to & rather
large core volume, and so to considerably higher reactor temperatures for
a given gross weight, it has to recommend it the great merit of simplicity
as regards handling the working fluid. Whether this asset is counter-balanced
by the added materials aifficulties arising from high temperature oxidation
and by the heavy machinery weight at highest altitudes, still remains to he
settled. Both the NEPA Project and the Lexington Project have explored the
air cycle in considerable detail.
Surface to Volume Ratio:

The preceding remarks on heat transfer have stressed the choice of the
best heat transfer mechanism. There is of course the companion appect of
the problem -- in order to get the greatest number of W/cm from the core,
one should also have the largest possible amount of cooling surface area per
cubic centimeter. The geometry of the core material should be arranged to
give maximum surface to volume ratio practicable in view of the requirements

of structural rigidity, resistance to thermal stress, resistance to radiation
demage, etc. In general, of course, one would achieve higher surface to
volume ratios by going to pmaller coolant passage diameters. The limit in
this direction is the use of porous materials. This has not been explored
adequately because of the §ifficulty of coating inside the pores to prevent
escape of fission products. If this problem could be solved, it is certain
that very large heat fluxes could be handled by pessing gaseous or liquid
coolants through porous materials.

High Temperature Materials:

If the liquid metal cycle is used, structural and fuel elements must be
sought which are resistant to corrosion at high temperatures. Work in this
field is now off to a vigorous start with exploration of various solid metals
against liquid Bi, Pb and Li. It is also possible that the fuel elements
could be ceramics with metal cladding. The possibilities for the use of
ceramets also remain to be explored. The materials problem of the circula-
ting fuel cycle would appear roughly the same as for the liquid metal cycle,
with the exception of the greatly decreased surface area to be protected.
Possibilities of materials with the boiling fluid or vapor cycle have not
yet been thought out. With the helium cycle, the material difficulties
should be greatly relaxed since the corrosion worries will be negligible.
For the air cycle, the material problems have always seemed most extreme =--
partly because of the presence of oxidation and partly because of the higher
reactor temperature necessary. However, as will be discussed in Part IV,
the NEPA Division and its subcontractors appear to be having considerable
succese in developing oxidation-resistant ceramic coatings for temperatures

to 2500CF in high-speed air.

Is
oy 13

All of the cycles will have to contend to some extent with unknown
radiation damage problems. No adequate experimental data are yet available
for the behavior of any material at the temperatures and the neutron and fission
product fluxes applicable to any of the aircraft reactor cycles. However, it
may be hoped that the relatively high temperatures of the aircraft system may
be a help with regard to radiation damage, since the high temperature may con-
tinuously provide partial annealing and restoration of the demaged areas. It
should be noted ‘that radiation demage problems would be very greatly decreased
with the liquid fuel arrangements.

Shielding:

The shield around the reactor core must protect against three types of
radiation: (a) neutrons, which arise almost entirely in the core (except if
the shield should contain uranium), (b) primary gamma quanta from the core,
and (c) secondary gemma quanta, originating within the shield. The secondary
garmas come from neutran capture and inelastic scattering of neutrons. ZIFach
of these three constituents of the radiation must be considered separately in
the shielding problem. Because of this complexity, it is rather unlikely that
a shield of uniform make-up throughout will prove to be the most efficient
fran a weight standpoint. Shielding against the gamma radiation is best done
by heavy elements, while shielding against the neutrons is most efficient with
light elements which quickly slow the neutrons by elastic collision. Com-
plicating features in the problem are that the néutrons are also slowed down
by inelastic collision in heavy elements, and that secondary gamma production
is going on throughout the shield. In order to reduce the total shield weight,

the heavy material should be put as close to the center as possible leaving
Anny 1
the lighter material to go nearer the outside. The optimum arrangement
and proportion of heavy and light materials has not yet been determined
with any finality ~-- either experimentally or theoretically.

However, there now exist a number of combinations which mey be fairly
close to the best arrangement possible. It seems likely that a very good
shield could be made by using lead as the heavy element and either boron or
hydrogen, or a mixture of the two, as the light element. The boron would
probably best be employed as boron carbide and the hydrogen might be inserted
as water or as a hydrocarbon. Alternative materials are uranium, thorium,
and iron and tungsten for the heavy materials.

It is clear that the shield must be specifically designed to attenuate
the fastest neutrons, those, for example, over about 1 Mev, and the hardest
game, quanta, those from 2 to 5 Mev. If the fastest neutrons and the worst
gamme.s are stopped, the other radiation will automatically have been taken
care of.

For the air cycle or the compressed helium cycle there is the question
of leakage of neutrons out of the reactor through the air ducts in the shield.
This problem has not yet been covered either experimentally or theoretically.
The ducts must be expected to add materially to the shield weight. (It is
not believed that ducts through the shield will cause important difficulty
in the case of the liquid metal cycle.)

Calculations have been based, so far, on the so-called "military tolerance”
of 25 Roentgens per mission for aircraft crew members. It is suggested that
this tolerance, though doubtless proper for an actual combat migsion, may

well need to be revised as a design specification for the nuclear aircraft.
A tolerance limit of 25 Roentgens per flight leaves room for no more than
eight flights and no accidents in a crew man's lifetime. Such a situation
makes test flying and practice missions very difficult. Certainly a great
deal of extended flying will be needed in the early days of the nuclear air-
craft and will always be needed for photographic reconnaissance. It 1s sug-
gested that the tolerance per 24 hour day be reduced to something in the
neighborhood of 5 R. This must be expected to cause an appreciable Increase
in shield weight. It may be noted that some medical work is now under wey on
the problem of artifically increasing man's tolerance to radiation.

Reactor Neutron Properties:

 

In the above discussion of the basic design considerations for the
aircraft reactor proper, the assumption has been used that heat transfer
within the reactor core was almost the prime consideration. This means that
in order to keep aircraft gross weight down, the shield perimeter and so the
reactor core diameter is to be made as small as possible by any practical
means; i.e., the core diameter ia to be governed wholly by heat transfer
considerations. (Of course the heat transfer arrangement chosen must have
been such as to satisfy numerous suxiliary requirements on materials, coolant
handling, turbine air temperatures , etc.). It was then implicitly assumed
that sufficient uranium vould be installed in some fashion within this speci-
fied core volume to make the reactor critical. No limitation was expressed
as to the amount of uranium which could be devoted to this purpose. It was
also not considered whether the reactor could always be made critical at any
desired diameter simply by adding enough uranium. Naturally, there exists a

minimum reactor core diameter set by the possible amount of uranium which can
ay | 16

be arranged in a suitable geometry within the core; however, this turns
out to be very small and in all interesting cases, smaller than the minimum
core diameter permitted by the heat transfer considerations.

It also appears from preliminary calculations that the amount of uranium
needed to make any core critical whose size is governed by the heat transfer
situation, will not be greater than a few hundred pounds of ed, Should
this amount, as required by an otherwise interesting design, be considered
excessive, it will usually be possible to decrease the uranium investment in
the machine by going to larger aircraft gross weight. "This balance between
uranium investment and gross weight of the plane is a parallel balance to the
compromise between gross weight and reactor materials stressed so far in this
section. It is believed that the materials temperature ig really crucial to
the operation of the aircraft and that uranium investment should be given
a free hand in design planning, within reason, in order to permit achieve-
ment of a feasible fuel element. This situation can be re-evaluated later
in the development.

The approach of letting the reactor size be governed entirely by the
heat transfer requirements can lead in many cases to a fast or intermediate
reactor instead of the more familiar thermal type. If this occurs in an other-
wise promising design, one must then balance the heat transfer and gross weight
gained against the disadvantage of moving into the more unfamiliar nuclear
realm.

Conclusions:

The above qualitative sketch of the more important reactor problem has

been presented so as to show the relative emphasis now considered important

for the various parts of the design. In the following section, a brief survey
Su 17
is given of selected parts of the Lexington Report which amplify the above
considerations to some extent. A mumber of the recommendations for future
study contained in the Lexington Report are also listed, to illustrate the
large number of alternatives in the design yet available in case a funda-

mental block is met in the more obvious schemes.
A
PART III. SOME VIEWPOINTS FROM THE LEXTNGTON REPCRT

During the summer of 1948, an extensive survey of the possibilities for
nuclear powered flight was made by the Lexington Project. The Lexington
Report?) was 80 stimulating that the most of the thinking and research on
nuclear aircraft during the succeeding 15 months has been devoted to lines
suggested therein. The results from such work as well as from other reactor
research throughout the Commission, and from widespread aerodynamics research,
have now filled out the picture somewhat.

“In a number of respects the viewpoints of 1948 have been altered, although
not many really new ideas have yet appeared. In the remainder of Part III
some of the features of the Lexington Report are outlined as a background
against which to consider the newer material.
Conclusions:

The principal conclusions of the Lexington Project were:

1. There is a strong possibility that some version of nuclear powered
flight can be achieved. The aircraft is expected to be subsonic. A super-
gonic plane is not expected without striking improvements in aerodynamics.

2. The operating altitude will probably not be much above 50,000 ft.
for any cycle.

3. The uranium content will be in the range of 20-200 lbs of ye32,

Lk. The manned plane and the tug-tow arrangement are the most interesting.

5. A choice of power plant and coolant is not yet possible; however, the
three most interesting systems are (a) the open cycle turbojet, (b) the helium-

cooled compressor jet, and (c) the bismuth-cooled turbojet. The gross weights

 

1) LexP-1 -- Nuclear Powered Flight, A Report to the Atomic Energy Commission
by the Lexington Project, September 30, 1948.
suggested for a manned plane, operating at Mach 0.9 and 30,000 ft altitude,

using these cycles are:

Bl Turbojet 525,000 lbs.
He-Compressor-jet 650,000 lbs.
Air Turbojet 900,000 1bs.

6. Reactor materials development is the most critical need of the
program. As 1llustration of this, the probable wall temperature of the fuel

elements suggested for the most promising cycles are:

Bi Turbojet 1840°F
He-Compressor-jet  1830°F
Air Turbojet 2500°F.

7. Shield welghts are still considerably uncertain. Shielding is of
dominant significance.

8. The airframe will be comparatively stralghtforward unless the re-
quired gross weights become tremendous.

9. Full-scale testing will be hazardous and expensive.

The most striking point in the conclusions from the Lexington Report is
that although the nuclear airplane is considered possible, the manned version
will be an essentially large craft which is not expected to become supersonic.
The principal change in general viewpoint of those working on the nuclear air-
craft program since the Lexington Report has been in regard to this point.
Although the actual feasibility of a nuclear plane cannot be completely dem-
onstrated yet, there are grounds for considerably more optimism in regard to
achievable plane weights and speeds. In order to investigate this point,
which is of the highest importance for the military end-use, the assumptions

upon which the Iexington calculations were based should be most carefully studied.
Fundamental Assumptions:

A very far-reaching assumption made by Lexington was that the L/D of a
supersonic plane would be 3. This figure is of major importance in the
question of supersonic feasibility.

Another assumption by Lexington is that the required shield would be a
h-foot thick wall of material having specific gravity 6. The resulting
weight of shield for a spherical core of 4-foot diameter would be 320,000 lbs.
It is the combination of such large shield weights with the small assumed
supersonic L/D which made supersonic nuclear flight seem improbable.

Bismuth Turbojet Cycle:

 

As an example of the nature of the assumptions necessary for designing
nuclear aircraft, the optimum Bi turbojet cycle considered by lexington for
a subsonic craft is outlined below:

A. Aircraft type is taken to be a "Delta Wing" design.

B. The operating altitude is assumed to be 49,000 ft. and the speed
0.9 M.

C. For exploring the field, a number of possible gross weights of the
aircraft are selected a priori.

D. Subsonic L/D of 15 is assumed. From this, the necessary thrust is
calculated for each gross weight.

E. From gross weight, the total weight of the power plant system,
including rotating machinery, reactor, shield and ducting is cal=-
culated. Based on comparisons with existing aircraft, the ratio
of total subsonic power plant weight to gross weight is taken as
65% for planes over 300,000 lbs; for smaller planes, the ratio is
slightly less, dropping to 61% at 150,000 lbs gross weight.

F. From the gross weight and the required thrust, the weight of rotating
machinery and accessories is estimated. The machinery weight is
taken from existing experience to be 2.0 lbs/cu ft/sec of intake air.
The amount of air required to achieve the necessary thrust is cal-
culated from existing turbojet experience in terms of the figure
40 1bs thrust/cu ft/second air flow, assuming the turbojet air
inlet temperature of 1500°F.
A "

G. Subtracting machinery weight (plus reasonable estimates for reactor
core weight, ducting and accessories) from the allowed total power
plant weight, gives the resulting weight permitted for a shield.

H. The permitted U°3” investment is assumed to be 100 1bs and the
reactor is assumed to be thermal and moderated by BeO. From these
data, a relation between core diameter and free-flow ratio follows
automatically.

I. The bismuth reactor inlet temperature of 1180°F and reactor outlet
temperature of 1656°F are assumed. The efficiency of propulsive
parts is taken as follows:

Compressor 83.5% (CFR = 6)
Turbine 87%
Exhaust Nozzle 90%
Inlet Diffuser 90%

A shell and tube radiator with 1/8" ID air tubes is used. From

these assumptions the relation between reactor core diameter and
free-flow ratio is calculated which will transfer the necessary

power.

J. From the above two relations, free-flow ratio may be eliminated
§0 as to pick a core diameter which is both adequate for heat transfer
and contains no more than the desired amount of uranium.

K. Assuming the core to be a right square cylinder, derive the thick-
ness of shield around the computed core size which is permitted
from the allowable weight derived above.

L. Repetition of this process for the various assumed values of gross
Plane weight provides a curve of gross weight vs. allowable shield
thickness.

M. From existing shielding data, chiefly on the MO shield, it is assumed
that a mixture of light and heavy material with specific gravity of
6 and thickness of 4 Tt. is required to give the necessary atten-
uation for 25 R exposure to a crew 10 meters distance from the
reactor.

N. The last step in the calculation is to pick from the graph the re-
quired aircraft gross weight to fly a k-foot thick shield for the

conditions assumed above (Mach 0.9, altitude 49,000 ft.). This
gross weight comes out to be 950,000 1bs.

Gas Cycles:

The calculations for the open cycle air-cooled reactor are similar in

spirit although somewhat more involved, because of the necessity of including
|] 22

the reactor core in the aerodynamic part of the system. The pressure drop
through the reactor and shield ducts was assumed to be 30% of the compressor
outlet stagnation pregsure. The fuel wall was taken as 2500°F, and the com-
pressor ratio was taken as 40. The resulting aircraft weights are very sensi-
tive to design altitude. This arises both from the increased machinery weight
needed to handle the required mass flow at low pressure and from the increased
core size required to give adequate heat transfer with air of lower density.
It was concluded by Lexington that there was little likelihood of being able
to carry an acceptable shield above 50,000 ft. altitude with the air cycle.

Another sensitive feature is the reactor fuel wall temperature. If
this is dropped from 2500°F to 1830°F, the gross weight becomes tremendously
high, even at 30,000 ft altitude. It was suggested that fuel temperatures
lower than 2300°F would not be practical with the air cycle. Some calcula-
tions were made on the effects of bringing the air into the reactor at the
center using a split flow. This design will reduce the aircraft gross weight,
but at the expense of a strong increase in uranium investment.

The third cycle for which extended calculations were made, was the
helium compressor-jet. The standard helium Pressure assumed was 1000 psi.
The aircraft gross weight is quite sensitive to this figure, varying at
30,000 ft from 575,000 lbs to over a million pounds as the helium pressure
is changed in the range of 2000 to 250 psi. One may purchase reduced gross
weight at the expense of difficulties of handling extremely high gas pressures.
Suggestions for Future Work:

The Lexington Report made a number of suggestions for alternate designs
which should be further explored. The most striking of these was the endorse-

ment of the idea of tug-tow. The tug-tow scheme was expected to require 1/3 to
Sn. 23

1/2 the shield thickness of the manned aircraft. This gives less than

85,000 1bs for a shield of specific gravity 6 surrounding a 4-foot diameter

core.

The greatly reduced difficulties of constructing such a plane must

be balanced against the operational disadvantages of the tug-tow system.

it was estimated that a towing cable about 0.6 miles long would be needed.

Some of the other suggestions in the Lexington Report which are still being

considered actively were for investigation of:

1.

2.

- fast reactors,

split flow in the air cycle,

separated shields, placing the heavy gamma shield material chiefly
around the crew instead of the reactor, so ag to get the benelit of
the inverse square law attenuation over the separation distance,

mixed reactors containing zones in the core of different moderators
which could operate at different temperatures -- the aim being to
reduce core size without increasing uranium investment,

reactor cores containing adjacent insulated regions of fuel and
moderator at considerably different temperatures; the aim being to
get hydrogenous moderator into a high temperature reactor so as to
reduce the uranium investment for a given size,

shadow shielding; i.e., making the shield thinner on the side away
from the crew (however, no more than about 107 of the shield weight
was expected to be saved by such a device),

study of the possibility of using extremely small channels in the
core, even going to porous solids as a device for increasing the
heat transfer rates,

vapor cycles using a condensable vapor such ag steam or mercury,
possibly in a ternary system with bismuth in the core itself,

studies of control mechanics so as to achieve completely integrated
systems. (It was emphasized that mechanical devices will be diffi-
cult to arrange which will maintain fast precision movements in the
presence of aircraft accelerations.)

PART IV. MAJOR DEVELOPMENTS SINCE THE LEXINGTON REPORT

During the time since September, 1948, there have been a number of
special groups which have investigated features applicable to the nuclear
powered aircraft. There has also been continued work in various labora-
tories along all of the lines involved in the problem. The overall super-
vision of the nuclear aircraft work has been vested in a joint Committee of
the Atomic Energy Commission, the Department of Defense, and the National
Advisory Committee for Aeronautics.

Radiation Damage

The field of radiation demage, which was not studied in detail by
Lexington, has been thoroughly surveyed by the AEC Committee on Effects of
Radiation on Materials. The report of this Committee) described the funda-
mental factors involved in radiation damage to both metals and non-metals.

It stressed the amount of research and engineering testing yet remaining to

be done before any materials can be considered thoroughly suitable for a high
power reactor. The principal reason for optimism on radiation damage in the
aircraft reactor is indeed the very high temperature involved, which should
lead to partial annealing of the damaged regions continuously.

Of special value in settling these unknown radiation damage questions
will be the new Materials Testing Reactor now being constructed at the new
Reactor Proving Grounds of the Atomic Energy Cormission in Idaho. Doth the
establishment of this proving ground and the construction of a high-flux
materials testing reactor were strongly recommended by the Lexington Report

as requisite to the nuclear aircraft development.

nay z

A large program of radiation damage measurements on many types of
materials is now underway throughout the AEC. This extensive work involving
both reactor irradiation and accelerator bombardment is certain to provide
much needed fundemental information from which some of the radiation effects
to be expected from the aircraft reactor may be deduced. However, experiments
at the simultaneous high fluxes and high temperatures to be met in the air-
craft case probably cannot be performed until the first prototype ANP reactor
operates on a test stand.

Shielding:

Information on shielding has progressed to a considerable extent during
the last 15 months. On the theoretical side, Bethel), and Tonks and Burwitz
have analyzed the shielding problem and concluded that a shield to adequately
surround a Lk-foot diameter core might be built at 220,000 lbs instead of the
320,000 lbs assumed by Lexington. The weights for smaller reactors would be
proportionately less. Further theoretical work?) was also done by the Summer
Shielding Session held in Oak Ridge in 1949. This work provides a firm basis
for analyzing the forthcoming new experiments.

The principal feature of the newly developed theory is the proposal of
a principle governing the best proportion of heavy and light materials in the
inner region of the shield. It was shown that the ratio of heavy to light
material over a considerable range of the thickness should be adjusted so as
to lead to equal neutron attenuation length and gamme attenuation length.
This is the so-called "matched" section of the shield. It is contemplated

that a shield would consist of an inner thin layer of perhaps boron to stop

some of the neutrons, immediately followed by a layer of pure heavy material
such as lead, to quickly reduce the primary gemma radiation to a level com-
parable to the fast neutron flux. Then would come the matched section, in
which the level of primary and secondary gammas and fast neutrons would be
simultaneously reduced. On the outside would be a region of pure capturing
light material such as boron carbide, to stop the remaining neutrons.

Recent theoretical designs by NEPA have contemplated replacing the boron
carbide region by water or by gasoline. The latter has a good hydrogen density
and might well be convenient as en emergency fuel for landing the aircraft on
chemical engines in the event of a nuclear stoppage. A further theoretical
development by the NEPA Project is in the realm of the "separated shield", the
scheme in which the shielding around the reactor core is predominantly light
material for neutrons only. The crew is then placed at the extreme end of the
aircraft and the crew quarters are surrounded by a relatively thin layer of
the heavy material for protection against the gamma radiation. The distance
of separation between crew and reactor, as contemplated at present, is 100
feet. It is believed that this device will produce a very marked saving in
weight, especially for larger core diameters. For reactor core diameters less
than about 2.5 ft the separated shield is not believed at present to lead to
a great deal of advantage.

Further theoretical work has been done on the possibility of "shadow
shielding". This is the arrangement in which the shield on the side away
from the crew is made thinner than the shield on the side nearest the crew.
The savings to be gained by this method do not yet seem extreme, but it may

prove somewhat useful.
LC o

Additionel calculations have been made by NEPA personnel on the ad-
vantages to be gained fram a shield built almost entirely of uranium hydride.
It appears that the weight savings would be considerable; however, the diffi-
culties of handling this material at the high temperatures prevailing in the
inner region of the aircraft shield might he prohibitive.

In the absence of adequate experimental shielding data, it is not yet
possible to really define shield weight with accuracy; however, the large
number of possibilities for at least partially reducing the weight which
are mentioned above, give grounds for optimism that a 220,000 1b shield is
adequate for a k-foot reactor running at several hundred thousand KW.

On the experimental side, the new shield testing facility of the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory Reactor, the so-called "lid tank", has now yielded
definitive measurements on water as a shielding agent. This represents the
beginning of an extended program of measurements which will include numerous
heavy metal, boron, and water combinations. Another new shield testing facility
is being proposed for construction, in which full-scale samples of aircraft
reactor shields -- including ducts -- could be tested at the full design
attenuation.

Reactor Materials:

The materials picture now looks somewhat brighter than in 1948. For
reactors containing principally metals, there is the added flexibility to
be gained from the use of zirconium. This element is available in a ductile
form, and it has been found to have quite useful properties in general. Its

alloys have yet to be explored.
Ay 2

For a ceramic reactor, as in the air-cooled cycle, the NEPA Project
guotes evidence of considerable success with coatings to withstand oxida-
tion at 2500°F. Several types have been found so far which will stand up
for 100 hours at 2500°F in still air. Some have stood up for considerable
time with air flowing past at approximately Mach 1.0. One of the best coat-
ings contains a mixture of iron, titanium, chromium and aluminum, which has
protected the beryllium-carbide underbody from oxidation for more than 1000
hours at 2500°F. It may be noted in passing that a coating which will pro-
tect the underbody against oxidation in rapidly moving air might also be
expected to prevent diffusion of fission products from the inside outward.

It is to be hoped that the fission products will not diffuse outward more
rapidly than oxygen will diffuse inward.

A materials matter on which there 1s yet no real progress but considerable
new calculations is the question of separated Lil isotope for use as a primary
reactor fluid. Design and cost estimates are now being prepared on the possi-
bility of large scale Li isotope separation by various agencies of the Atomic
Energy Commission, using any of several separation processes. It is hoped at
present that the expense will be sufficiently low as to render Li a primary
coolant material of interest. In any case materials studies on liquid Li
systems are being carried forward, since Li may well be the best secondary
working fluid in a ternary cycle system.

Intermediate Reactors:

 

Although little work has been done on the possibility of passing from
a thermal reactor for the aircraft, to an intermediate or a fast reactor, the
feasibility of making reliable intermediate reactor calculations has been
greatly improved by the recent critical experiments at the Knolls Atomic

Power laboratory.
L 2

Another uncertainty in epithermal reactor calculations has now been
decreased by the new measurements on the Xe135 absorption band at the Cak
Ridge National Laboratory. This is also important for thermal reactors
since it bears on the added ye35 investment which must be assumed to over-
come poison during operation of the aircraft at the extremely high neutron
fluxes which will be required.

Tug-Tow:

The Lexington suggestion for a tug-tow system is now being investigated
from the operational standpoint by the Air Force. It would not appear to be
necessary to carry out reactor development aimed specifically at this system
until it is proven operationally sound. Any reactor which will power a single-
unit menned plane will be more than adequate for a tug-tow system.
Reprocessing:

The question of uranium hold-up in the reprocessing of the aircraft
reactor fuel elements was not investigated by Lexington, although it was
suggested that the continuous hold-up might run to as much as 10 - 20 times
the uranium content of a reactor core. However, two techniques now appear
to be within sight which would greatly reduce this. These are the use of
fuel elements something like the General Electric pin type, which might per-
mit running to at least 15% depletion, and the use of remote metallurgy to
refabricate the material with no more than about 10 days cooling time. It
geems likely that such methods might keep the amount of fuel continuously
undergoing chemical and metallurgical processing as low at 100 lbs per flying
aircraft. Of course considerably more than this amount must be tied up in a
complete operation of a task force of nuclear airplanes, because of logistic

reasons.
any 30
Miscellaneous:

In addition to the above larger pieces of work, advances in numerous
details of calculation and laboratory experiments are being made at NEFA,
North American, RAND, Battelle Memorial Institute, KAPL, Bureau of Standards,
and other sites active in atomic energy work. Among the new items now being
surveyed which offer possibilities of giving extra degrees of freedom to the
design may be mentioned:

a) The use of molten NaOH as a primary reactor coolant. Some rough
experiments indicate that its heat transfer properties at high temperature
are very similar to those of room temperature water. The reason for using
such a material is to get hydrogen into the reactor and so, because of

its moderating action, to reduce the uranium investment needed for a given
core diameter.

b) The possibility of obtaining self-controlling core materiales which do
not require moving control mechanisms is being explored. The line of
attack now under way is to include in the core a liquid at a temperature
and pressure not too far below its critical point. The resulting swift
change of density with temperature would have a strong regulating effect
on the neutron flux.

c) An attempt to experimentally check the thermal relaxation times in-
volved in the integrated control of reactor plus power plant is now under
way on a moderate scale. It may well turn out that the handling of the
thermal time lags, due to the large heat capacity of the extensive cir-
culating systems and of the heat exchangers, may prove as difficult for
the aircraft operation as the actual control of the pile neutron flux.

It may be most desirable to control the aircraft thrust by some auxiliary
means of “wasting turbine power at times, rather than by making any changes
in the heat production level.

d) Some consideration is being given to the possibility of using liquid
metal alloy coolants having melting points considerably above room temp-
erature. It is thought, for example, that the radioactive heat in a core
which had once been operated would be sufficient to keep many alloys
melted for quite a long time. If such things could be arranged, it might
be possible to find liquid metals less corrosive than Bi, Pb, or Li.

PART V. SAMPLE CALCULATIONS WITH NEWER DATA

[2

The NEPA Project has made many detailed calculations of possible
miclear aircraft characteristics. These are continually being revised as
new date and new viewpoints appear. Neither NEPA nor any other ANP group
yet feels that it has sufficient fundamental date to seriously compare the
different possible cycles on an equally informed basis. Also, it is by no
means possible yet to accurately specify the performance characteristics
obtainable from any of the cycles. However, as an illustration of the
way some of the current thinking is running, a partial list of the design

figures for four recent NEPA suggestions are given below. *

 

* The specifications for these four preliminary design ideas were provided
for this report in advance of publication through the courtesy of the NEPA

Division, Fairchild Engine and Airplane Corporation. More details will be

available in NEPA Quarterly Reports.

Comparison among these figures shows some of the changes in performance

characteristics which cen be expected by altering the design assumptions. It
is especially to be noted that by accepting a moderately fast reactor the

1)
=

weight of an only slightly subsonic medium-altitude plane might be brought
down to the B-36 class, with unlimited range of course.

The design suggestions shown above were worked out for a plane cruising
at the rated speed end altitude. The NEPA Division hag also made calculations
on landing conditions. If the nuclear aircraft actually has to land under
nuclear power and carrying the full shield weight, extra performance above the
cruising specifications must be built into the design at several points.
Assuming a landing speed of 150 mi fr, and a maximum allowable sinking speed
during normal landing of 10 ft/sec, the required turbojet thrust for the Mach
0.8, 45,000 ft., Bi-cooled example rises from 16,460 1bs to 32,200 lbs. The
reactor power is also doubled, to become 222,000 KW, and the heat flux in the
core rises to 1,800,000 BTU/£t2/hr. The power density becomes 56 KW/in3.

At the Oak Ridge National laboratory some much more qualitative calcula-
tions have recently been made to illustrate the point stressed in Part I of
this report -- the interchangeability of fuel element temperature and aircraft
gross weight. The following weight estimates are for Mach 1.05 at 60,000 ft.,
with liquid Bi cooling. Although an L/D of only 7.0 was assumed -- instead
of the 10 now belleved eventually possible for these conditions -- the results
are probably somewhat optimistic. This is partly due to an assumed gross welght
of only twice the shield weight; possibly 3 times the shield weight would be

more realistic at 60,000 ft. altitude.

Those above ‘reactors of core diameter less than about 2.5 ft. vould
have to be epi-thermal to fast. |

It should be exphasized again at this point that new experimental knowledge
~ in shielding may produce a relatively great effect on the aircraft gross weights
derived from purely theoretical calculations.

It would indeed be rash to quote definite performance predictions for
any nuclear aircraft at the present time. About as far as one could go would
be to estimate that the region of Mach 1.0 and 60,000 ft. might be reached with
a gross veight im the range 350,000 - 450,000 lbs., provided an L/D of about 9
vere avallable.

In general, it does appear that -- mainly because of -the fact that higher
L/D and lower shield weight seem more likely now than at the time of the Lexing-
ton Report -- there 1s no reason to believe that supersonic flight cannot be
achieved with nuclear power.

‘In gpite of the theoretical feasibility of nuclear flight, the fact that
not one kilowatt of mechanical power has as yet been extracted from uranium
fission presents a serious psychological barrier to the whole development. It
is felt that the enormous technical problems which must be overcome in developing
a power plant of hundreds of megawatts will be approached moet realistically by

building some non-flying, lower performance, power reactors as a first step.
