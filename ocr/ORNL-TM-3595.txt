INTRODUCTION

This document contains abstracts of 321 selected reports and papers
which collectively provide a good, basic introduction to molten-salt re-
actor technology and describe major developments in the field since the
initiation of the MSRE in 1960. As an aid in locating specific information,
three indexes are provided: by keyword, by author, and by subject category.

The abstracts and indexes, prepared and printed by a computer, were
taken from the file of the Molten-~Salt Reactor Information System (MSRIS).
This is a growing file in the IBM-360 computer at ORNL, which can be
searched in various ways from remote terminals. A report is now being pre-

pared to describe MSRIS and how to use it.

LIST OF ABSTRACTS

In the pages which follow, abstracts are listed in the alphabetical
order of their primary subject categories. Each appears only once, even
though its subject may extend into several other categories. Therefore to
find all abstracts having information on a particular subject, it is neces-
sary to use the category index.

Each entry in this list consists of the abstract itself plus certain
other information about the reference. The first line is an identification
number, assigned when the reference was added to the MSRIS file. The three
letters in this number identify the primary subject category. If the ma-
terial in the document extends significantly into another category, this is
shown in the last line of the entry. Authors, title, and originating or-
ganization are listed on separate lines, then the document identification,
date of publication and numbers of pages, figures, and references are given.
Following the abstract is a list of keywords, with the most significant

marked by asterisks.

Results cf chemical research and development for molten
salt reactors are summarized. These results indicate that
LiF-BeF2-UF4 mixtures are feasible fuels for thermal
breeder reactors, Such mixtures show satisfactcry thase
behavior, they are compatible with Hastelloy N and
moderator graphite, and they appear tc resist radiaticn and
"tolerate fissicn prcduct accumulation. Mixtures of
LiF-PeF2-ThFY similarly appear suitakle as blankets fcr
such machines. Several possible secondary coolant mixtures
are available; NaF-NaPBPF4 systems seem, at present, to be
the most likely possibility, Gaps in the technology are
presented along with the accomplishments, and ar attenpt
is made to define the information (and the research and
development program) needed ktefore an MEBR car be operated
with confidence.

The materials develcpment program is described for a
two-region MSER with a uranium-tearing flucride fuel
salt, a thoriur-bearing fluoride blanket salt, and a
lower melting fluoride coolant salt. Ttke primary structural
materials are graphite and modified Hastelloy N. Individual
fuel cells will be graphite tutes, whict must withstand
10(23rd) neutrcns/sg-cm and have very lov permeatility
to gases and mclter salts. Available graphites and
their properties are descrited in detail. A frcgran
for cbtaining and evaluating improved graphites is
proposed. A program is descrited in detail fcr develcping
modified Hastelloy N, which will be used in all parts
of the system except the core. Brazing allcys and
a reasonable jcint design have been developed for a
joint between the graphite tulkes and the mcdified
Hastelloy N. Needed inspection techniques are ccnsidered.

Studied thermal Molten-Salt Breeder Feactors to identify
important design and development protless. The purpose was
to organize these problems into a program which would
produce components for use in a Molten-cSalt Breeder
Experiment, The reference-design concept is a two-region
two-fluid system with the fuel salt separated frcm the
blanket salt by grarhite tubes. The energy produced in the
reactor fluid is transferred to a seccndary ccclant-salt
circuit, which couples the reactor to a supercritical
steam cycle. The specific development fproblens tc be
studied include the reactcr core and heat exchanger
hydraulics, pumps for the three salt systems, heat transfer
in the heat exchangers and boiler-superheater, mechanical
valves for salt-flow control, ccntrcl rcd and drive,

The sources of possible error in estimates cof breeding
performance of a Mclten-Salt Breeder Feactor are discussed.
Uncertainties in cross sections may ccntribute ar
uncertainty of about plus or minus 0.026 in breeding ratio.
Other sources of error may arise from assurnpticrs regarding
“behavior of fission products, or trom inadequacies in
methods of computation. A reactor physics develcgment
program is cutlined which should provide a sound tasis for
design of a reactor experiment. The prcgrarx includes
thecrétical investigation of system dynamic characteristics,
evaluation of alternate core designs, development of
ccmputational methods, cross-section evaluation, development
of computer codes and experimental physics. Prcgran

must have fast processing to remove protactinium and
poisons to achieve moderate gain, but fissile material
investments can be low, The fluid-fuel molten-salt

Molten-salt breeder reactors being developed at CENL
promise safe, low-cost power while extending rescurces of
fissicnable material. MSR technology, develciirg since
1947, was adequate for successful construction and
operation of the MSRE which showed that circulating
molten fuel is practical, that fluoride salts are statle
under reactor conditions, and that ccrrc¢sicn is very low.
The sinple fuel prccessing necessary for a converter was
demonstrated in the MSRE. Processing methcds being
developed should permit MSR's in which UOF4 and ThF4 are
combined in a single salt flowing throuch a grathite
moderator to operate as economical breeders. Initial
startup can be with U-235, U-233, or Pu-23%. Ccrstruction
costs shculd be about the same as light-water reactors and
fuel costs should te much lower. Achievement of eccncnic
MSBR's requires develorment and construction of severzl
MSR plants of increasing size.

Examinat ions of the grarhite from an CFE convection lcop
showed the salt had wetted the graphite, ccntrary tc
previcus exreriences in very dry inert gases. Subsequent
laboratory studies show that - extremely rinute
concentrations of water (approximately 1 ppm) promote
wetting at points of three phase contact of salt, gragfhite
and gas. A second Hastelloy-N capsule containing
NaBF4-NaF (92-8 mole %) was’irradiated for 1460 hr at
600 deg C in three successive spent HFIR tuel elements;
nc deleterious effects sere observed. Fluorine due to the
delayed neutrons by B-10F3 + N to LiF + alpha + F2 was

off-gas line, 2 ft downstream frcr the pump bewl, was :
reccvered for examination. All internal surfaces were
covered with a thin, soctlike film, and no other deposits
were found. A group of fissicn froducts, largely "noble
metals" (Mc, Ru, Ag, Te) were present in ‘quantities
several hundred times the amcunts expected frce the

the MSRE heat exchanger after four tubes had teen removed.
Welds in Hastelloy N showed reascnakly cccd creep and
tensile properties. In a poorly ueldable heat silicon and
aluminum concentrated in a grain-ltoundary eutectic, Brazing
allcys were sought for joints betveen various refractcery
metals and graphite or Hastelloy N. Density, gas evolution,
and porosity vere measured on FSEE graphite, Cxidation
accelerated by thermal cycling led to a crack ir a
Hastelloy N bayonet tube in a development test. Plans for

section selection, fission product treatment, multigroup
cell calculations, two-dimensional reactcr criticality
calculations, equilibrium depletion calculations and
startup depletion calculations. 1Inscfar as pcssible,
the cross secticns and calculations methods were made
independent of those used previcusly. The reference
composition gave a k{(eff) of 0.95. This discrepancy
was traced to use of a low value for thcriur rescnance
integral in previous calculations. When the reactor
was made critical by the addition of 14% mcre 0-233,
the breeding ratio was 1.062 compared with 1.C%4 in

Develcrments which permit separation of protactinium and
fission products from MSK fuel and frcm each cther raise the
possibility of a sirgle-fluid FSEF, The fluid which
contains uranium and thorium is made tc functicr as bcth
fuel and fertile material by adjusting the degree of neutron
moderation that occurs in varicus regicns ct a zcned ccre.
~~ Zoned cores have higher. yields and lower fuel inventories

than uniform cores. Power costs can te reduced (C.1 tc 0.3
mils/kwh(e) below those fcr comparable uniform cores.
Temperature coefficients of reactivity in zcrped-ccre
single-fluid reactors are such that dynamic claracteristics
are expected tc be acceptable. (Freprints of this paper are

Several molten salts were considered as intermediate
coolants for LMFBR!'s. Included were flucride, chloride,
carbcnate, nitrate-nitrite and fluoroborate salts.
Chemical reactions that could cccur ketween scdiur and
flucrchborates lead toc the conclusion that cartonates
might be a better choice for LMFBR's, Use cf carbonates
avoids the safety ccnsiderations and related costs thet

"arise from the reactions of sodium with vater if steat

generator fails and with air if a coolant pipe ruptures.
In the absence of these safety consideraticns, scdium is
clearly sugericr tc the mclten salts as an intermediate
coolant for LMFBER's because the lcwer tlermal ccrductivity

Polycrystalline graphite has rerarkatle resistarce to
therral-stress-induced fracture. Nevertheless, selection
of a particular grade of graphite for certain aprlicaticns
must include ccnsideration of this property. Currently the
type and grade of graphite are often selected cr the ltasis
of elastic analyses, since thermal shock tests are toc
expensive. for screening devices. This repcrt describes a
test rapid and econcmical enough for screening candidate
materials. Thin disks of graphite are Leated at the center
with an inert-gas shielded-arc nonconsumable electrode
welder, each at a different, tut constant, pcwer level.
The rinirum power input to the welder that will consistently
cause the graphite to fracture is deterrined. The graphite
that requires the highest power level to produce a
fracture is the one most resistant tc ttermal shcck. This
test ranked 21 grades, cr types, of graphite. In

A facility and procedure for studying the tensile,
impacts, and compressive strengths, creep and ductility of
grarhite at terperatures from 30C to 3:5CC deg K are
described. Experimental data on the mechanical
characteristics and variations of the creep rate and
ductility of three grades of graphite differing in
grain size in this temperature are presented. The
tensile and corpressive properties depended in a complex
fashion on grain size, temperature, and orientaticn; the
coarse-grained material was weakest. At about 3000 deg K,
the tensile behavior changed from brittle tc ductile and
the temperature dependence of creep increased greatly.

This report is an addendum to ORNI-TM-2407 ccrcerning a
methcd of stress analysis for irradiated gragpkite which may
be used for MSBR ccre design. To provide a refined
analysis, the present method includes tle effect cf a
variable creep coefficient which is caused by the
nonuniform temperature distriltuticn. Tc facilitate a
simple fecroulaticn, it is assumed that the temperature
dependence of the elastic resgcnse of tle gaterial is
approximated tc be inversely proportional to the creep
rate, It is shown that the prcklem reduces tc the
sclution cf several asscciated (fictitious) elastic
problems vhich have a common elastic rodulus inversely
propcrticnal to the creep rate of the irradiated graphite.
Numerical examples in the previcus report were recalcrlated
based on the present thecry. It shows, for large dose
values, an improvement to the previous methcd. A
computer preocgram is written for the purpose and can

ORNL- 3708 (Nov. 1964), pp. 373-389, 10 fig, 18 ref.
The graphite purchases for the MSRE, grade CGE, is a rew
nuclear graphite that is basically an extruded petroleum

coke bonded with coal tar pitch heated to 2800 deg C. Low

permeation is oktained through a series cf imfregraticns and
heat treatments. The final heat treatment was at 2800 deg C
or higher, Experimental equipment and frocesses were used
on a ccmmercial scale fcr the first time. The graphite was
produced as a 2-1/2-in.-square x 72-in.-long tars, shich
were machined to the required shapes. The average bulk
density is 1.86 grams per cubic centimeter, Its matrix is
not permeated by sclten salts under conditions more severe
than those expected in the MSRE. It exceeded all the
requirements specified for the MSKE except that it had
longitudinal cracks. Tests indicated tlat the cracks
should nct have any significant adverse effect on the
operation of the MSRE., The skrinkaqge cf the crafphite at
350 to 475 deg C under exposures between 0.60 x 10{20th)
to 1,40 x 10 (20th) neutrons/sg-cm (E greater than 2.9 MeV)
indicated that this should not create any important adverse

CORROSION BEHAVIOR OF REACTOR MATERIALS IN FLUCRITE SALT

CRNL-TM-328 (Sept. 1962), 35 p, 10 fig, 12 ref.
The report discusses (1) corrosion experiments dealing with
fluoride salts in support of the FKSRE, and (2) analytical
methcds employed tc interpret corrosicn and rass-transfer
behavicr., The products of ccrrosion are solutle in tthe
molten salt; accordingly passivation is precluded and
corrosion depends directly on the thermodynamic driving
force of the corrosion reactions. Ccrpatibility, therefore,
demands salt ccnstituents that are not appreciably reduced
by useful structural alloys and container materials whcese
compcnents are near thermodynamic equilibrium with the salt
medium, Utilizing information gained ir ccrrcsicn testing
of ccemercial alloys.and in fundamental interpretations of
the corrosion process, ORNL developed a high-strength
nickel-base alley ccntaining 17% lo, 7% Cr, and 5% Fe.
Several long-term corrosion lcops and in-pile capsule tests
corrleted with this allcy demonstrate the excellent
corrosion resistance to fluoride salt mixtures at high
temperatures. Thermodynamic methods are presented for
predicting corrosion rates. Radiotracer studies confirmed
the ccrrcsicn model. Also ptblished as pp. 557-579 in

A srall heat of Hastellcy N was prepared in which a
portion of the carlton atoms were tagged as caibcn-14, The
respcnse tc heat treatment was studied to determine
whether the changes in mechanical prcperties cculd be
correlated with the cbserved changes in the carton
distribution, Although markeé segregation resulted,
the changes in mechanical properties did not appear
to be related, 2A second okjective was to determine
whether the relatively large precipitate particles
in this alloy were carbides. These precipitates, 1in
bcth their stringer (lcocu-temperature) and lamellar
(high-temperature) forms, were fcund to be as lcw in
carton as the ratrix cr lower, It is hypothesized
that the other alloying elements reduce the sclukility
of rolybdenur i n nickel so that the precipitate is
basically nickel-mclybdenum intermetallic compounds.

To reduce the pressure drop through the shell side of the

slight interference fit {0.000C to C.CC(C2 in,) with the

material was Hastelloy N, as was the entire heat exchanger.
The tube end was manually welded to the plug with a gas

Fusion welds affecting 75% of the crcss secticn were
made in small tensile samples 0.125 in. in diameter)
of Hastelloy N irradiated to thermal tluences up to
9.4 x 10 (20th) neutrons/sq-cm, All cf the unirradiated
samples and 67% of the irradiated samples were
satisfactorily velded by a specialized technicue. Suiface
contamination is suspected to cause the unsuccessful welds
in the irradiated samples. The welded irradiated samgles
generally had as gccd tensile properties at 25 and 65C deg C
as the irradiated Lkase metal. The weld metal defcrmed
appreciably at 650 deg C and made a significant contribution
to the overall fracture strain. The fracture location in
the irradiated samples tested at €50 dec C shifted freer the
weld metal to the base metal following the post-veld anneal
of 8 hr at 870 deg C, Porosity near the fusicr line of the
irradiated sasgles probably resulted frcm helius Ltukbles,
but this did not seem to affect the locaticn cf the
fracture.

The temperature and frequency dependence of fatigue
properties of Hastelloy N were determined by rctating-
bear fatigue tests, Stress-lifetime data were oktained
for temperatures of 1100, 1300, and 15CC F, ard cyclic
frequencies of 100, 600, and 3000 cpm. The fatigue
strength decreased with increasing temperature. No
appreciable frequency effect was found up to 1300 F.
At 1500 F, the fatigue strengths ¢f srecimens tested
600 and 3000 cpm were equal, while the fatigue strength
at 100 cpm was substantially lower. A critical frequency
is associated with each temperature, aktcve which frequency
has no effect, but belcw which fatigue strength decresses
with decreasing frequency. Fatigue strength was higher

INFLUENCE OF SEVERAL METALLURGICAL VARIABLES CN THE

Oak Ridge Naticnal Laboratory, Tenn.

ORNL-3661 (Aug. 1964), 63 p, 35 fig, 10 ref.
The tensile properties cof Hastelloy kN were measured after
various heat treatments. One vacuum-melted ard fcur air-
melted heats were studied. The vacuum-melted material
exhibited good ductility after all beat treatrmerts,
Annealing the air-melted material to temperatures in excess
of 2150 deg F significantly reduced tke ginigur fracture
strain. Holding at about 1600 deg F for an extended period
recovered the fracture ductility. Aginc in tke 110C tc
120C deg F range material that had been previcusly annealed
at 2150 deg F significantly reduced the ductility. These
changes in ductility cccurred with very small changes in
tensile strength, These effects can ke explained in terms
of the fcrmaticn of a brittle grain boundary layer alcang
vhich a crack can propagate easily at elevated temperatures.
Interrupting the ccrtinuity of this layer by overaging or
cold working recovers good fracture ductility. The
fcrzation of this layer is associated with the presence of
trace alloying elements.

by irradiation at 700 deg C. Cuctility, as measured ty the
true unifcrw and fracture strains, is reduced for
deformation temperatures of 500 deg C and abcve. The loss
in ductility results in a reduction in the true tensile
strength, especially in intercranular failure, such as low
strain rates and elevated temperature. Fost irradiation
annealing does not improve ductility. 1lbese data are

exposures. g£levated-temperature irradiation emtrittlement
greatly reduces the stress-rupture strengtk as measured
in pcstirradiation uniaxial stress tests. The reduction
in ductility to values as low as C.4% is due tc an
irradiation effect related to the process of intergranular
fracture. Intergranular cracks, once fcrmed, rrcraga te

Adding 0.5% titanium to nickel-1z% molytdenum-7%
chromium-0.06% carbon decreased tke creep rate, ircreased
stress-rupture life and ductility. Increasing carbcn from

. The influence of small titanium additicrs cn the thermal
stability cf Ni-12% Mo-7% Cr-0,07% C was investigated.
The mechanical properties at €50 deg C (tensile tests at
0.002/min strain rate and creep tests at 40,CCC gsi stress)
were measured for four heats cf this allcy with titanium
contents fromw 0.15 tc 1.2%. Solution annealing
temperatures were 1177 or 126C deg C, ard subsecuent
precipitation heat treatments were conducted at 650 and
760 deg C. Titanium increases the stability cf a ccmilex
MC-tyre carbide. At low titanium levels the FC carktide is
stable at 650 deg C but is unstable at 760 deg C, wheelie an
M2C-type carbide is precipitated, resulting in inferior
properties, For the higher titapium ccrcentratices the MC
carbide is stable cn.aging at 760 deg C and results in
excellent properties after a solution arneal at 1177 deg C.
However, high-titanium alloys are significantly less
ductile it they are solution annealed at 126C deg C ard
aged at either 650 cr 760 -deg C. The heat with the lowest

The corresion ¢f alloys exposed to nonisothersmal
circulating liquids is important in systems with liquid
coolants or coclant-fuel combinations. Mathematical
descriptions vere developed to explain transgcrt cf
constituents of allcys. This report specializes to cases

“in which solid-state diffusion in the alloy dcrirates the

corrcsion. Equations are derived for hoth transient and
steady-state cases; transients are negligible.
Applicability is demcnstrated by comparison of predicted
values with experimental results for twc systers. The
first involves hct-tc-ccld-zone transfer of nickel in
Inconel 600 pumped loops circulating sodium. Actual
corresion is much higher than predicted; this suggests that
the true corrosion reaction overrides a slcw diffusior
process. The second system is transfer of chromium in
Hastelloy N thermal convection locps with sclter salt,
Three examples are considered; (1) corrosion at all pcints,
transfer to salt only; (2) hot-tc-cold-zone trarsfer; and
{3) ccld-tc-hot-zcre transfer. - Early Cr-51 tracer
experiments (example 1) suygest that solid-state diffusion
applies to certain molten-salt systems.

good properties vere observed when the irradiaticn

large effect of irradiation temperature to coarsening

of the graphite-Hastelloy N-fluoride salt systen at

for a molten-salt tkreeder reactor with a basic plant
life cf 30 years; specifically, (1) Hastelloy N with
improved resistance to emltrittlerent ty therzal neutrcns,
(2) graphite with better dimensional stability in a

Design and evaluaticn studies were made of a twc-regicn
molten-salt thermal-treeder reactcr vhich uses fuel ard
blanket salts separated by the walls of graphite tubing,
which acts as the moderator. A ccolant salt transgpcrts the
heat fror the primary heat exchangers to steam generators
and reheaters. The reference design fuel salt is
LiF-BeF2-UF4 (68.3-31.2-0.5 mole 3%), the blanket salt is
LiF~-ThF4-ReF2 (71.0-27.C-2.0 mcle %), ard the ccclant salt
is NaF-NaBF4 (61.1-38.9 mole %). On-site fuel recycle
processing was assumed, with flucride volatility and
vacuum distillation employed for the fuel salt and direct
protactiniur~-regcval rrccessing used for the tlanket salt.
Estimated power cost is atout 2.7 mills, kWkr, tke specific
inventcry about 0.7 kg/E¥(e), the fuel doubling time about
13 yrs and the estimated fuel-cycle ccst is 0.35 mills/kWhr.
General flowsheets and conceptual designs for the reactor,
primary heat exchangers, salt circulating pumps and stean
generators are presented. Cost and perfcrrance estimates
are also given. Several alternate designs are triefly
described: (a) a modified primary heat exchanger design;

The January 1, 1968 status of the conceptual design study of
a 1C0C MW{(e) MSBR fpcver station employing separate fuel and
blanket salts in the reactor is reportec¢. The requirements
fcr Hastelloy N, the graphite moderator and reflector, and
for the fissile, fertile and heat-tranrspcrt salts are
discussed and the fprcrerties of the available materials are
tabulated. The selected fuel salt is LiF-BeF2-UFU
(68.5-31.3-0.2 mole %), the blanket salt is LiF-ThFu4-LEeF2
{11-27-2 mole %) and the coolant salt is NaBF4-NaF
{92-8 mole %). (The lithium is separated Li-7.) Ccncegtual
designs are presented fcr the reactors, pumps, primary heat
exchangers, drain tanks and stear-generating equirment,
Flowsheets are given for the ‘main systems, but the off-gas,
afterheat removal, fuel-processing, and steam-fpcwer systems
are described cnly in sufficien detail to indicate
feasibility and to estimate cests. The reference design,
with a pover density of 20 k&/liter and an estimated
graphite life of 8 years, has a treedinc ratic cf 1.0€,
a specific power of 1.77 MR(t),kg, and a fuel yield of
4,07%/year. The dimensions of the fcur reactcr vessels are
about 14 ft D x 20 ft highs The estimated ccrstructicn cost
of the power staticn is about $141/k¥W (1968 prices) and,
based on 14.7% fixed charges and €0% plant factcr, the
estirated power prcduction cost is about 4 mills/kWh. The
estimated fuel-cycle cost is 0.7 gills/k¥b.

A conceptual design has keen made of a single-fluid 1C00
MW (e) MSBR power staticn. The reactor vessel is 22 ft
in diam x 20 ft high, of Hastelloy N, with graphite
ncderator and reflector. The fuel is 0-233 carried ir a
LiF-BeF2-ThF4 mixture which is molten above 930 deg F.
With continuous chemical processing tc isolate fprctactinium
and rerove fission products, conversion of thorium to U-233
exceeds fissile burnup., The estirated fuel yield is 3.3%
per year. The estirated construction cost of the station
is comparable to PWE total constructicn costs. The pcwer
producticn ccst, including fuel-cycle and graphite
replacement costs, with private utility financing, is
estirated to be less than that for present-day light-sater
reactors, largely due to the low fuel-cycle ccst and high
plant thermal efficiency. After some engineering
development, such a plant appears feasikle and practical.

Develcpment of rapid fuel-salt processing and longer-1lived
graphite is needed tefore molten-salt Lreeder reactcr fpcwer
staticns are built, The molten-salt converter reactor,
however, is generally within present technclcgy; the
graphite would last the lifetime of the plant and the
occasional fuel processing would invclve cnly the
vell-rroven fluoride vclatility process. The breeding
ratio would be about 0.84, Lut the fuel-cycle ccst woutld be
only about C.8 millss/kwh and the construction costs are
expected to be attractively lcw. The reactor design
receiving the most study is the type used successfully in
the MSKE: a vessel filled with reflectcr and scderatcr
grarhite having salt flcw passages formed by grooves in
the faces of the pieces. A fpeltle-Led type cf ccnverter
reactor has a structure that easily accommodates
dimensional changes in the graphite and the shapes are
econcrical to manufacture, but the salt-to-ygraphite ratio
in the core is higher than desired. Thermal reactors
operating on the Th - 0-233 cycle are more efficient than
those using the U-228 - Pu-239 cycle, but Pu car be used
efficiently fcr startup and makeup fuel. Construction of

About 40 percent of the noktle-metal tissior prcducts are
expected tc deposit cn metal surfaces in the fuel loop of an
MSR, predominantly in the heat exchangers. The rcrral means
of afterheat removal is continued circulation of the salts,
but the design must permit afterkeat removal frcx the heat
exchangers entirely by radiative heat transfer without
compromising containment, Steady-state temperature profiles

Oak Ridge Naticnal Laboratory, Tenn,

CRNL-TM-1545 (Sept. 1967), 201 p, 9 fig, 12 tab, 4C ret.
A system is described which uses five types of heat
exchangers to transfer the heat generated in the reac tcr
ccre cf cne ccrcept of a 1000 KW (e) ESBEF to the
supercritical steam needed to drive a turbine fcr the
generaticn cf electrical power. The two major design
approaches reported here are for flow circuits in which heat
is transferred from the mclten core fuel and fertile
blanket salts to the molten coolant salt and then tc the
supercritical fluid. 1he Case-A system involves relatively
high fuel- and blanket-salt frtessures in the reactcr core.
These frressures are reduced in the Case-B system Ly
reversal of the flows of the fuel and tlanket salts thrcugh
the reactor core and the respective pumgs and exchangers,
vhile the operating pressures of the coclant-salt system
are raised above thcse in the Case-A system, The criteria
used, assumptions made, relationships enplcyed, and the
results cbtained in the design for each of the five types of
exchangers used in these cases are repcrted. The resclting
design for the Case-B heat-exchange syster and the
exchangers appears to ke the tcst workakle cne.

molten—-salt reactor systems. The basic design concept is
such that boiling heat transfer instabilities and their
attendant severe thermal stresses are avoided even for a
temperature difference of as much as 10(0 deg F between the
feedvater and the high-temperature liquid, thus giving good
control characteristics even under startup ccrditiors.

This is accomplished by employing a vertical reentry tute
geometry with the feedwater entering the bcttcr cf the
inner small diameter tube (approximately 1/4 in. diam)
through which it flows upward until evapcrated tc dryress.
The slightly superheated steam emerging from the top cf the
small central tube then flows tack dcwnward thrcugh the
annulus between the central tube and the outer tuke. A
portion of the heat transferred from the higb-tezpera ture
liguid tc the superheated steam in the annulus is in turn
transferred to the water toiling in the central tube.
Design studies indicate that this type of toiler not only
avoids thermal stress and salt freezing prcblers but it
alsc gives a relatively compact and inexpensive
construction. Further, it appears tc make fgcssible a
simple plant ccntrcl system sith exceptionally good plant
response to changes in load demand.

as tc minimize certain integral measures of the difference
between the actual and desired output resgcnse. The
minimization is performed according to an optimization

computer code written fcr the IBK~360. The techniques were
used to solve several prollems in order to dencrstrate the
validity and practicality of the methods. The problems

The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment has been refueled
with an enriching salt concentrate. Its preparation
in a shielded call ¢f the Thorium-Uranium Fecycle Facility
at CRNL was required because of the higk uraniug-232
content (222 pgm) cf the uranium-2z33. 2& two-step process
was used in which the uraniur oxide was reduced tc
uraniur dicxide by treatment with hydrocen and ccroverted
tc uranium tetraflucride by hydrofluorination. Lithium
fluoride was added and the eutectic was formed by fusing
the components. The eutectic sas purified by treatment
with hydrogen, which reduced the corrcsicn prcducts
tc retal and subsequently allowed their removal by
filtration. The quality of the product was well within
the requirements established for the FSEE. The fuel
concentrate, containing 39 kg cf uranium (S1.4%

For designing the distillation system we have measured
relative vclatilities of the fluorides of cerium, lanthanum,
praesodymium, neodymium, samarium, eurcpiurm, Ltarium,
strentiun, ytrium, and zirconium with respect to lithium
fluoride, the major component. The measuremerts were
made using a recirculating equilibrium still operated
at 1000 deg C and at pressure from 0.5 to 1.5 mr merccry.

Equipaent built to demonstrate the lcw-jressure
distillaticn of a 48-liter batch of irradiated fuel salt
from the MSRE consisted of a feed tank, a 12-1liter, ore-
stage still reservcir, a condenser, and a condensate
receiver, The equipment was tested in 1568 by frccessing
six U4&-liter batches of nonradioactive IiF-EeF2-ZrF4-NdE3

(65-30-5-0.3 mole %) at 1000 deg C. A distillaticn rate

of 1.5 cu-ft of salt rer day per square root of
vaporization surface was achieved in the nonradioactive
tests, Evidences of concentration polarizaticn andsotr
entrainment were ncted in some runs but not in others.

- Automatic operation was easily maintained in each run,

although certain deficiencies in the liguid-level measuring

devices were noted. Condensation cf volatile salt

compcnents in the vacuur lines and metal deposition in the

- feed line to the still pot are proklers needirqg further

attention. These results showed that use of distillation
in MSBER fuel salt processing is feasitle and that the test
equipment was satisfactory for use with radioactive

The direct reduction cf uranium hexaflucride to uranium

in the purification of fuel salt from a molten salt
reactor, This step would replace the ccnventicral

reduced to uranium tetrafluoride rower in a hydricgen-
flucrine flame. Reduction of the uranium hexafluoride
in a molten salt will result in a shcrter and eEcre

is to be effected in two steps which consist cf abscrgition
of uranium hexafluoride into a molten salt containing
uraniuam tetrafluoride and of reducticn ¢f the resultirg
interpvediate fluorides to uranium tetrafluoride with

The MSRE has been refueled with an enriching salt
concentrate, lithium-7 fluoride-uranium-233 tetrafluoride
(73-27 mole %), which was prepared in a shielded cell in the
Thorium- Uranium Recycle Facility at CEML. The preparation
process involved reducing uranius tricxide (urapium-232
content, 222 ppm) tc uranium dioxide by treatment with
hydrogen, converting the dioxide to tetraflucride by
hydrcflucrinaticn, and fusing the tetraflucride with
lithium-7 fluoride. The original KSRE fuel salt, which
contained 220 kg of uranium (35% uranium-235), was
flucrinated to volatilize the uranium as the hexafluoride
which was absorbed ‘on sodium flucride. The urarium was
deccptaminated from fissicn products by a factor of almost
ten to the ninth. Fluorine utilizaticn averaged 39%.

Nuci. Appl. Tech. 8, 170 (Feb. 1970), 9 p, £ fig, 1€ ref.

" The MSBR being develored at CHFNL requires continuous
processing of the fuel salt, lithium flucride-beryllicm
flucride-thorium fluoride (72-16-12 mole ¥%) containing
approximately 0.3 mole % uranium=233 tetraflucride. The
reactcr and processing plant are planned as an integral
system, The main functions cf the processing plart will be
tc isclate fprotactirium-233 from the neutron flux and to
remove the rare-earth fission prcducts., The methcd being
develcped involves the selective chemical reduction of the
various components into liquid kismuthb scluticns at
approximately 600 deg C, utilizing multistage counter-
current extraction. Protactinium, which is easily
separated frcm uranium, thorium, and the rare earths, would
be trapped in the salt phase in a storage ‘tank lcca ted
between two extracticn contactors and alloved to decay to
uranium-233, Eare earths would te similarly separated from
thorium; hcwever this operatisn will be more difficult
because the separation factors are lower. Electrclytic

cells would be used to introduce reductant into the bismuth
phase at the cathode and to return extracted raterials to
the salt fhase at the anode.

The MSRE was operated fcr 3000 equivalent full-power hours
from September, 1968 through September, 1969 with U-2:3
fuel. Static and dynamic chaacteristics of the reactcr were
essentially as predicted. Special fuel samples were taken
to evaluate U-233 integral cross-sectior ratics in an MSR
spectrum. Experiments were conducted to measure cover-gas
entrainment in the fuel loop and its effect cr fissior-
product stripping. Fissicn-product distribution was
studied with a remote gamma-ray spectrometer. Small amounts
of rlutoniur flucride were added to the fuel. Fuel
chemistry and materials compatibility studies ccntinued to
shcw good system behavicr. (Freprints of the full pager

EXPERIENCE WITH THE MOLTEK-SALT REACTCEF EXFERIMEKT

Nucl. Appl. Tech. 8: 118 (1970) 19 p, 6 fig, 16 ref.
The MESRE is an 8-Mw {th) reactor in whict mclten flucride
salt at 1200 degrees F circulates through a core of
graphite bars, Its purpose was to demcnstrate the
practicality of key features of molten-salt power
reactors. Operation with U-235 in tke fuel salt amcurted
to SCCO0 equivalent full-pover hours betseen June 1965
and March 1968. At the end of a 15-mcnth demcnstraticn
of reliability the reactor was shut down and the U-
23% vas stripped from the salt in on-site fluorination
equipment. U-233 was added to the salt and cperaticn
vas resured in Octcber 1968. Cver 2500 EFEH has Leen
produced with U-233 through July 1969. The MSRE has
shown that salt handling im an operating reactor is
quite practical, the salt chemistry is sell-Ltehaved,
there is practically nc corrosion, the nuclear
characteristics are very close to predictions, and the
syster is dynamically stable. Containment of fission
products has been excellent, compcnent ferfcrmarce
has been good, and maintenance of radioactive ccmponents
has been accomplished safely and without unreascpable
delay.

(excluding the volute) is 1198 deg F. For the came
conditions and with no fuel permeation, the graphite nuclear
and bulk mean temperatures are 1257 deg F and 1226 deg F,
respectively. Fuel permeation of 2% of the graphite volume
raises these values to 1264 deg F and 1231 deg F,

TEMPERATURE ANC REACTIVITY COEFFICIENT AVERAGING IN THE MSRE

Oak Ridge Naticnal Labcratory, Tenn.

CRNL-TM~-379 (Cct. 15, 1962) 26 p, € tig, 5 ref,
Use is made of the concept of 'nuclear average temperature!
to relate the spatial temperature prcfiles in fuel and
graphite attained during high power operation of the MSRE
to the neutron multiplication constant, Based cr twc-groug
perturbation thecry, temperature weighting functions for
fuel and graphite are derived, frcam which the nuclear
average temperatures may be calculated. Similarly,
importance-averaged temperature coefficients cf reactivity
are defined. The values of the coefficients calculated for
the MSRE were =-4,4 x 10 (-5th) deg F fcr the fuel and -7.3 x
10(-Sth) for the grarhite. These values refer to a reactor
fueled with salt which does nct ccntain thecrice. They were
about 5% larger than the values ottained frcm a cne-region,
homcgenecus reactor model, thus reflecting the variation in
the fuel volume fraction throughcut the reactcr and the
effect of the ccntrcl rod thimbles on the flux profiles.

The alpha-n source inherent in the uranium-235 fuel salt
meets all the safety requirements for a neutron source in
the MSEE. Subcritical tlux distributions were calculated
to determine the ccebination cf external source strencth
and detector sensitivity required for mcnitcring the
reactivity, If more sensitive detectors than the servo-
driven fission chamters are installed in the instrumert
shaft to monitor the filling cperation, the calculations
indicate that the required scurce strencth car te reduced
from 4 x 10(7th) n/sec to 7 x 10(6th) n/sec. An antimony-
beryllium source with an initial strength cf 4 x 10 (8 th)

PERICC MEASUREMENTS ON THE MOLTEN SALT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

DURING FUEL CIRCULATION: THECRY AND EXEEEREIRENT

Cak Ridge National Laboratory, Tenn.

ORNL-TM-1626 (Oct. 1966), 36 Ep, 8 fig, 10 ref.
A theory of period dependence cn the fuel circulaticn is
developed from the general space-dependent reactor kinetics
equations, A procedure for computer evaluaticn cf the
resulting inhour-type equaticn is presented, together
with numerical results relating the reactivity tc the
otserved asymptotic period, both with the fuel circulating
and with it stationary. The calculated reactivity
difference betveen the time-independent flux conditions for
the noncirculating and the circulating fuel states is in
close agreement with the value inferred from the MSRE rod
calibration experiments. Rod-ftump pericd measurements made
with the fuel circulating were converted to differential rod
worth by use of this model. These results are ccrpared with
similar rod sensitivity measurements made with the fuel
stationary. The rod sensitivities measured under these two
ccnditionrs agree favorably, within the limits of precision
of the period measurements, Due to the prcbler cf
maintaining adequate precision, however, the period-rod
sensitivity measurements provide a less conclusive test of
the theoretical model than the reactivity difference tetween
the time-independent flux conditicns.

ANALYSIS OF FILLING ACCIDENTS IN MSEKHE

Ccak Ridge National Laboratory, Tenn

ORNL-TM-497 (Aug. 1966), 41 p, 14 fig, 2 ref.
Whenever the MSRE is shut down, the fuel salt is draired
fror the ccre. Then, during a normal startup, the
graphite and the fuel are preleated and the ccntrcl
rcds are pesiticned so that the reactor remains subcritical
while it is being filled. Certain atncrmal circusstarces
could result in criticality and a power excursion
in the partially filled core. Varicus fcstulated
incidents were surveyed and the worse case was analyzed
in detail. This case involved selective freezirg
in the drain tanks to ccncentrate the uranium in the
molten salt fraction, Physical restrictions cn the
fill rate and safety actions of control rods and gas
control valves limited the calculated pcwer and temfe1ature

" excursions sc that any damage to the reactor would

be prevented. Abstractor's note: It was subseguently
shown that the degree c¢f uranium concentration required
for a serious filling accident cannot ke attained by
partial freezing of the salt. Protective circuits
and administrative procedures to prevent abncrzal fills

SAFETY ASPECTS OF THE MSRE

- Fluid-fuel and solid-fuel reactors, altltough sirilar in
‘ultimate containment recuirements, differ in the kinds of
accidents that can cause syster damage. Scre fluid feels
are susceptible tc segregation, and filling accidents are
more likely, but afterheat is more easily handled. The
surviving fluid-fuel concept, the molten-salt reactor, is
being developed into a thermal ltreeder. The MSRE, in which
molten fluoride salts circulate at 1200 deg F, is a step in
that development. Safety analyses and experience have -
shown the MSRE to be safe, and no serious protlems are
expected in designing safe molter-salt treeder reactors.

for calculating the Xe-135 migration gave a poisoning of
about 1.4% without circulating Ltutktles and well belcw 1%

because cf the buildup of U-232 daughters, and at the

the fuel pump were the main scurce of tle naturally
occurring neutron flux fluctuations in the frequency
range of one to a few cycles per seccnd. 1It was also
noted that the arplitude of the neutron flux-to-pressure

The neutron flux-to-pressure frequency resgcnse for a

The one-dimensional conservation egquaticns describing the

of mass for the gas, and conservation of mcrmertur fcr the
salt-gas rixture (the hydraulic equations) was solved Ly
employing matrix exponential teckniques. The remainitg
equations were sclved by more conventional schemes. The
matrix exponential technigue was selected to cktain a
solution for the hydraulic equaticns cver the techniques
ncrerally erployed (nodal or mcdal) for stability studies in
boiling water systems tecause the validity of tte sclction
is independent cf the frequency of interest, and the total

applicaticn cf boundary conditions (closing the flow loop)
is small, Results from the computed nectrcn flux-tc-

pressure frequency Iesfonse was then obtained from a cross-
power and auto-power spectral density aralysis cf the
resulting signals frcm a neutron-sensitive ionization

. chamber and a pressure transducer. By comparing the

frequency dependence of the experimental frequency response
determined for the reactor operating at power with the
frequency response determined from analysis of mathemeétical
models, the selection of the mcre appropriate bcupdary
ccnditicn set from a chcice of two possible boundary
condition sets was possiktle. Then the analytical frequency
resgcense was fitted by the least-squares methcd to the
experimental frequency response toc oktain the vcid fraction
in the mclten salt fuel. A void fraction of 0.€1 plus or
minus 0.04% was determined frcm the frecuency response; this
value corpares favcrably with a value of 0.6 plus or minus
0.1% determined by cther techniques, Conclusions are that
the analytical model leads to acceptable results for the
neutrcn flux-tc-iressure frequency respcnse and that
properly designed dynamic tests involving small reactivity
pecturbaticns (intrcduced by means other than rcd motion)
can be used to extract specific nuclear parareters for a
nuclear system operation at poser.

Dynamics tests were performed on the uranium-23Z fueled
MSRE for the full range of operating poser levels tc
determine the fcwer-to-reactivity frequency response.
Three types of input disturlances were used: the psetdc-
randcr binary reactivity input, the pulse reactivity
input, and the step reactivity input. 1The frequency
resgpcnse of the unccntrclled reactor system displayed
resonant behavior in which the frequency of cscillaticn
and the darring increased with increasing power level.
Measured periods of natural oscillaticn ranged frcm
thirty minutes at 75 K& to two minutes at 7.5 MW. These
oscillations were lightly damped at lcw power, tut strongly
damped at higher pcwer. The measured results generally
vere in good agreement with predicticns. The mair
conclusicn is that the system has no operational stability
problems and that the dynamic characteristics are
essentially as predicted.

neutronic characteristics of the MSRE, under ccrditicrs
of negligible nuclear heat generation. The program
includes the initial critical U-2z35 loading, the conticl-

MEASUREMENT OF HELIUM VOID FRACTICN IN THE MSEFE FUEL SRLT

USING NEUTECN-NOISE ANALYSIS

Oak Ridge Naticnal Laboratory, Tean.

CRNL-TM-2315 (Aug. 1968), 32 p, 10 fig, 17 ref.
Investigations were made at the FSRE during power
operation with uranium-235 fuel tc determine if the
amount of helium gas in the fuel salt cculd be measured
using peutrcn noise analysis. The neutron power
spectral density (NPSL) was measured at differert

. reactcr operating ccnditions and compared with analytical
model predictions of the NPSD tor the same ccrditiorns.
Results showed that the principal source of small
neutron density fluctuation citserved in the MSRE
is heliur bubbles circulating in the fuel salt. The
measurements showed that NPSL in the frequency range
fror C.5 to 2 cps varied as the square of helium
void fraction as predicted ty the model, and that
the minioum void fracticn was more nearly zero than
the previously accepted value cf C.1%., It is ccrcluded
that changes in the circulating void fraction can be
inferred with good sensitivity directly frcs revtron
noise measurements, and, consequently, NESL can complement
and enhance the value of the MSRE reactivity talance
calculaticns.

Tests to determine the neutron flux—tc-reactivity frecuency
resfonse were frerfcrmed on the MSEE with the reactor
at various power levels between zero and full pcwer ard
with the reactcr fueled with a U-235 fuel mixture and
a 1-233 fuel mixture. Test patterns ergployed were pseudo-
randce binary sequences (PRBS) and pseudorandom ternary
sequences (PRTS) of various sequence lengths ard mirnisum-
pualse-duration times, In some tests reactivity (control-
rod position) was forced to fcllow the test pattern,
ard in other tests the neutron flux was forced tc fcllow
the test pattern. The experimental results were analyzed
by several different methods and the results were ccmjared.
The frequency respcnse ¢f the uncontrolled reactor system
was found to be in good agreement with thecretical
predicticns for both the U-235 and U-233 fuel loadings.

Analysis Task Force, whose activities centered at the
Pacific Northwest laboratories. Input data, includinc
costs appropriate for 1967, were provided by cther tack
forces established by DEDT to evaluate various reactor
concepts. Most consideration was given tc ccombinaticrs of
a few reactcr types considered most likely to be developed
in the U. S. In the one case in which the ccapetitior
included all reactcr types, over half of the reactors built

FEPORT CF THE EFI REACTOR ASSESSMENT PANEL

Edison Electric Institute, N.Y.

EEI Publication 70-30 (April 1970), 53 p, 4 fig, 7 ref.
A panel cf 6 utility executives (plus a working group)
reviewed power reactor developrents and sucgested the
direction, pricrities, financial requirements, and timing
of utility involvement. Major emphasis cn the ILMFBR is
indicated. With regard tc molten-salt reactors, the panel
concludes that they promise low costs ir the future, but
the current lack of a supplier and the small scale of AFC
development deter utility involverment.

KEYWORD INDEX

The reviewers who prepared the abstracts for MSRIS had a list of about
600 keywords from which to select a set for each abstract. In the pages
which follow are listed the keywords that were actually used, each followed
by the identification numbers of the abstracts to which that keyword was
assigned.

The user of this index should be aware of a peculiarity of the listing:
all keywords beginning with a capital letter (Hastelloy N, for example) are
listed after all the other keywords. This is a consequence of the prepa-
ration and print-out of the index by the computer.

CATEGORY INDEX

‘The category structure used in the MSRIS appears in outline form on
the next three pages, followed by the index.

The significance of the letter X, which does not appear in the outline
but does appear in category designations elsewhere, requires some expla-
nation.

There are two meanings or uses of the letter X. One is simply as a
"filler." For various reasons associated with the computer, every category
designation, whether it be the primary category in the identification num-

ber or an "other category" in the last line of the entry, must have exactly

3 letters. Thus for category N, which is not subdivided, every abstract is.

designated NXX. Similarly, all abstracts falling into second-order cate-
gories which are not subdivided have X as the last letter in their category
designation (ABX700054, for example).

The other use of X is to denote a general or broad treatment. This
is the meaning if X appears in place of the letters for established second-
or third-order categories. To illustrate, MAX690019 is a comprehensive
description of the MSRE design (category MA) which discusses general con-
siderations and embraces information in third-order categories MAA, MAB,
MAC, and MAD.
