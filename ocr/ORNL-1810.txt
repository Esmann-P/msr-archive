ACKNOWLEDGEMENT

The authors wish to express their appreciation for the valuable
advice given in the ‘course of this work by M. C. Edlund, under whose
supervision this study was performed, R. B. Briggs, and D. E. Ferguson.
Grateful acknowledgement is made to T. B. Fowler for his able and extensive

efforts in coding and supervising the ORACLE calculations.

 
 

SUMMARY

A study of the effects of geometrical and some operational variables
on the economics and characteristics of thorium breeder-power reactors has
been made as an aid in the selection of design criteria for the TBR program.

No original effort was made to estimate plant investment costs or
to introduce new concepts of reactor technology. Plant investment was assumed
constant for all systems studied under equal power and temperature conditions.
The state of technology and cost factors assumed were those reported by
Briggs'>) and Arnold et ard), The effect on power cost of core radius,
blanket thickness, blanket uranium and thorium concentrations, chemical pro-
cessing cycle times, poisons and external power density have been investigated
using a consistent method of calculation with a standardized set of nuclear
constants and cost factors. All results are for a 3-reactor power station
delivering 575 Mw of electricity to a power grid.

For both one- and two-region reactors, the unit cost of power is

. rather insensitive to fairly large changes in nuclear parameters and process
variables. This is a direct consequence of plant investment and other fixed
charges representing nearly 80% of the power cost.

The results, based on operating and maintenance costs for conventional
power and chemical plants, indicate that a two-region reactor station could
produce power for 6.2 mills/kwh with a fuel cost of 1.8 mills/kwh. Applying
error limits to the items comprising the total cost, a cost range of 5.35 to
8.0 mills/kwh is obtained. |

The cost of power from a one-reglon reactor station was about 0.9
mills/kwh (2.6 wills/kwh fuel cost) higher than for a comparable two-region

system if the plant investuent and other fixed charges are considered equal

for

the two types. It is believed that the fixed charges will be somewhat

smaller for the one-region reactor because of simpler construction and

operation.

The approximate characteristics of the reactors required for pro-

ducing power for the above costs are:

Uranium (233 and 235) credit 0.49 0.05
Net unit cost of power 6.2 T.1

From these results, it is apparent that the net unit cost of power
from the two-region reactor 1s nearly independent of the value of uranium
since the fuel inventory charge and the breeding credit are approximately
equal. This is not true for the one-region reactor, however. In that case,
the breeding credit is small compared to the fuel inventory charge, so that
any variation in the latter due to a change in the value of uranium will cause
a corresponding change in the cost of power which is virtually uncompensated

by the breeding credit.

INTRODUCTION

 

The feasibility and the technology of aqueous homogeneous reactors

(3).

have been discussed elsewhere, most recently by Briggs The present
work is concerned with the results of detailed calculations of the effect
of the major process variables on the power cost and characteristics of
thorium breeder reactors in order to help select design criteria for the
TBR. In addition, it was desirable to estimate. the possible effect of
errors in the nuclear parameters on the cost of power.*

The different reactor systems were compared on the basis of a
fixed amount of electrical power (125 Mw per reactor) delivered to a power
grid since power is the main product. If power output were not constant,
the effect of the process variables would be masked by the effect of power
level, the most important factor in unit cost calculations.

An electrical power output of 125 Mw was chosen as standard for
one reactor or 375 Mw for a 3-reactor station. This is equivalent to
180.8 Mw of heat for a net station efficiency of 26%. The parameter
studies, other than temperature, were made for an average reactor
temperature of 280°C.

At the present time, it is impossible to estimate the cost of
electricity from nuclear power stations without a fairly large uncertainty.
Nevertheless, a study such as this, based as it is upon stated cost factors
end a consistent method of calculations, can be used to determine what is,
and what is not, of relative economic importance and further provides a

rational basis for the selection of most design criteria.

 

* The ORACLE was used to perform the large number of required reactor
calculations.

TWO-REGION REACTORS
Methods and Conditions

The program for the study of the two-region reactor has been pre-
viously outlined by Briggs and eatuna®) The data that were used to get
cost factors and process characteristics are given in other publications 3710),
and are discussed in a later section of this report.

A schematic flow diagram of the system studied is shown in Figure 1.
The core material will be chemically procested by two methods. The core
material is treated in a liquid-solids separation plant utilizing hydraulic
separators to.remove the precipitated poisons. This procedure is capable
of removing 75% of the so-called group-3 poisons (fission product poisons
affected by chemical processing). A more complete discussion of ‘this

(1)

poison removal method is given by Arnold et al Complete poison
removal from the solution carrying the precipitated poisons is effected

in the Thorex plant at a rate considerably less than that used for liquid-
solid separation. Since the blanket material is a slurry, poisons must be
removed from it by the Thorex process only.

In order to produce uranium of high enrichment (about 95% U-233)
the blanket stream will have to be partially processed for removal of the
excess U-233 (represented by breeding gain) before any mixing of the core
and blanket streams in the chemical processing plant. The core enrichment
will be only 25-30% U-233. By processing to remove protactinium, uranium
composed of nearly 100% U-233 could be produced. For these calculations,
however, it was assumed that the uranium product would be that derived from

the blanket with all protactinium decayed to U-233 and mixed with the

uranium isotopes.

 
 

— 5-

The calculation procedure, which is successively described in the

 

following sections, consists of four main parts:

1) calculation of chemical processing cycle times amd uranium
isotope concentrations in the blanket and the core by isotope
balance equations for the particular blanket power selected
(for any set of parameters, calculations were made for three
reactor powers); |

2) two-group nuclear calculations to determine the critical con-

centration and the neutron balance which yields in turn the
core power and the ratio of resonance to thermal capture in
the thorium; |

3) unit cost calculations;

4) plot of unit costs versus total reactor power so that the costs
at a particular total power can be used for comparison of the
systems.

The parameters studied were core diameter, blanket thickness,

blanket U-233% concentration, thorium concentration, core poisous, temperature
and power density of the system outside the reactor (piping and heat

exchangers).

Processing Cycle Times and Uranium Isotopes
For purposes of chemical process calculations, the fission product
poisons are considered to be composed of three groups’) The first group
consists of the noble gases, the second of the high cross-section isotopes

and the third of the low cross-section isotopes which transmute by decay

or neutron capture into other nuclides of approximately the same low cross

 
 

gection. The first two groups are virtually unaffected by chemical pro-
cessing rates required for aqueous homogeneous reactors and their macro-
scopic cross section is approximated as 1.3% of the fission cross section
(0.8% high cross section isotopes and 0.5% residual noble gases). The
noble gases are continuously stripped during operation; the high cross
section isotopes are rapidly destroyed by neutron capture since their
cross section is around 40,000 b. The third group is, however, a function
of the chemical processing cycle.

For core processing, two modes of poison removal are employed --
poison precipitation with subsequent liquid-solid separation, followed by
Thorex. The precipitation step is capable of removing only some of the
atomic species comprising group-3 poisons which will be called subgroup A;
the remainder, subgroup B, is not removed by precipitation. Both subgroups
are removed by the Thorex process. This is represented by the following

equations for equilibrium conditions.

This equation actually defines an overall processing cycle for the core.
The optimum Thorex cycle time is, of course, that determined by a balance
between value of fuel recovered and inventory and chemical processing costs.
Another relationship between Tic and Toe for minimum core processing cost
could be obtained by utilizing the processing cost equations. For this
study, however, the precipitation cycle (T;.) was set constant at one day
since the estimated cost (10) of the precipitation process is practically
independent of the processing rate for reasonable flow rates. In addition
the core processing cost is very small (around 0.08 mills/kwh).

Under the present state of chemical process development, only the
Thorex process can be used to treat the blanket material because it is a
slurry. The equation for the blanket cycle time is simply

i): (6)

T, = — 22
ET OFA

For use in the nuclear calculations, determination of the concen-
trations of the various isotopes in both core and blanket was necessary.
Both core and blanket contain U-233, U-234, U-235 and U-236. In addition,
the blanket contains Pa-233 and Th-232. Other isotopes that could be present
are neglected since even very small processing losses will prevent the build-
up of higher isotopes and the half-lives of Th-233 and Pa-234 are too short
to permit significant concentrations to occur.

For the blanket at equilibrium conditions, the following isotope

balance equations apply:

These equations hold only for a breeding ratio of one or greater.

For breeding ratios slightly less than one the isotope ratios obtained are

 

 
 

| -13-

still approximately correct. Actually, except for one isolated case, the

 

breeding ratios were all greater than one.

The method and ease of solution for the set of equations (Eq. 7
.through 20) depend on the selection of the indepéndent variables and the
availability of automatic computing machinery. |

In the present study, the dimensions (R, a and t); blanket power,

P.; blanket U-233 concentration, N(23); poison fraction in the core, £(3C);

B’
the thorium concentration, N(02); the external power density and the
average reactor temperature were selected as the independent variables.

The ratio resonance to thermal capture in thorium, B, can only
be obtained from the nuclear calculation since the fast flux is required to
determine it. It was necessary to estimate a value for B, compute the isotppe
concentrations, compute Bp from nuclear calculations and then compare the
value so obtained with the initial guess. After a little experience, it was

possible to estimate an initial value of B that required only two or three

iterations.

Nuclear Calculations*
The customary two-group method was employed for obtaining the

critical mass and neutron balance for the spherical two-region geometry.

(6, 14)

The major details of this procedure have been described elsewhere

The only novelty introduced was the use of a "thin shell” approximation’ 12)

to account more adequately for the effect of the zirconium core tank. The
nuclear constants used in the work are shown in Appendix I. These values

(2, 7, 13)

are based on or taken from several publications

 

* The ORACLE was used for the large number of calculations required. That
part dealing with the nueiser calculations was based on an ORACLE code devised
by Willoughby and Fowler 5) for two-region spherical reactors. Calculation,
‘tape handling and punch-out time averaged only 8 minutes for the two-region
reactors and 30 seconds for the one-region reactors. If desk computers were
used, about 4 to 5 man-days would be required for each case.

Cost Estimation

Selection of proper cost factors is the most difficult part of the
evaluation of nuclear power stations. since no full-scale plant experience
is available. However, reasonable values based on laboratory and pilot
plant experience, coupled with normal industrial methods and practice, should
produce results with at least sufficient relative accuracy to aid in the
selection of design criteria and operating conditions.

No new effort was made to estimate the investment cost for a reactor,

(3)

turbogenerator plant or chemical processing plant; the estimates by Briggs
were used.
Reactor and Turbogenerator Plant Investment

The basis for computing the cost of the reactor with associated
equipment and structures was 811.653) per kilowatt of heat for a L50-Mw
reactor considered as an integral part of a 3-reactor power station. For
power levels different from 450 Mw per reactor, the unit investment cost
was corrected by use of Figure 2 (reproduced from ORNL-1642).

The unit investment cost for the turbogenerator plant, which is
dependent on the throttle temperature, was obtained from Figure 4 (repro-
duced from ORNL-1642). The cost of boilers and coal and ash handling
equipment is excluded since the reactor plant replaces these items. Since
the total reactor power could not be predetermined, a quadratic equation
was fitted to the points shown in Figure 2, for purposes of calculation by
the ORACLE. Using a plant factor of 80% and a 15% amortization charge,

the result is

T_2

Investment (mills/kwh) = i (0.3387 - 2.828 x 207% P+1.873x10 'P

Operation and Maintenance

Operating and maintenance charges for the reactor and turbogenerator

plants were taken as 3% of the total investment.

Inventories
A 12% charge was assessed against all non-depreciating materials.
All fissionable materials were valued at 520/ gram. Protactinium was con-

sidered a fissionable material only when outside the reactor.

Heavy water was valued at $40/1b. To cover the slight holdup in
chemical processing and makeup Laventory, the inventory of heavy water was
taken as that required to fill the reactor system at room temperature, an
amount about 25% greater than necessary at operating temperatures.

Thorium was valued at $5/1b with no appreciable charge for making the
Th0,-D0 slurry.

The feed stream inventory charges were based on the following holdup
times |

Spent core fuel 95 days
Spent blanket fuel

Th + U + 75% of Pa 55 days
25% of Pa 205 days

Thorium feed 30 days
The holdup time associated with the poison removal by the hydraulic

separator plant was considered negligible.

Chemical Processing
The estimated cost of the poison precipitation process and the hydraulic

separator plant was $210 per day (10) or $70 per day per reactor. This cost
was considered independent of the throughput for flow rates of the order of
25,000 liters/day per reactor.

A fixed charge of $5,500 per day(3) or $1830 per day per reactor was
used for the Thorex plant. The cost includes chemical plant amortization
and fixed operating costs. The estimated cost of processing thorium was
$3.00 /kg and $0.50 /gram for fissionable material (U-233, U-235 and Pa con-
verted to U-233). In previous studies(3) $1.00/gram was the estimate for
(10)

processing fissionable uranium; the lower value represents a later estimate

by the Chemical Technology Division. Uranium losses were assumed to be 0.1%

 

 
 

 

SY -17-

of the amount processed through the Thorex plant.
Prior to processing in the Thorex plant, heavy water must be evaporated
from the feed streams. A charge of $0.35/liter was used for the recovery
of heavy vater. (10)
Feed Costs
For breeder reactors (all reactors were breeders, with one exception),

only thorium is required and D,0- makeup. As is usual, 5% of D0 inventory

of the reactor ‘system was estimated as the annual makeup requirement.

‘Results

The results shown in the following tables and graphs are for two-region
thorium reactors delivering 125 electrical megawatts to a power grid. The
power station is composed of three reactors, three turbogenerators and one
chemical processing plant along with some accessory equipment common to the
three reactors.

| The major results of the study are shown in Figure 5. Results for five
typical cases are shown in Table II. It is immediately apparent that the
net unit cost is very insensitive to the parameters investigated; only 0.5
mills/kwh separates the highest and lowest cost reactors shoim. This is
a direct consequence of plant investment and other fixed charges represent -
ing nearly 80% of the power cost.

The details of the effects of the individual process variables are
discussed bole under the heading Major Process Variables. Effects of
external power density changes, errors in the group-> poison cross section
and errors in the two-group constants are reported in succeeding sections,
followed by discussions of the accuracy of the two-group method and the

economics calculations.

Major Process Variables

 

1)

2)

3)

Core Radius -- Variation of the core diameter from 4 to 7 feet
results in a power cost change of less than 0.3 mills /kvh. The
lowest cost is associated with 4-foot cores, but only a negli-
gible difference of 0.01 mill/kwh exists between 4- and 5-foot
cores.
Blanket Thickness -- For the blanket concentrations used (500
to 1500 g Th/liter), the unit cost of power varies only about
0.1 mill/kwh for a range of blanket thickness between 1-1/2
and 3 ft. The optimum thickness is about 2 feet for a six-
foot core and 2-1/4 feet for a five-foot core.
Thorium Concentration -- The lowest unit cost results from using
a thorium concentration of 1500 g/liter. However, the cost is
only 0.02 mills/kwh less than that for 1000 g/liter. Also, the
results indicate that if engineering considerations require the
use of thorium concentrations as low as 500 g/liter, the slightly
increased unit cost would not preclude possible economic power
generation.

Fig. 6 shows the effect of thorium concentration on the

breeding ratio and net U-233 production and again indicates that

‘use of thorium concentrations greater than 1000 g/liter leads

to a rapidly diminishing improvement in the breeding ratio.

Ratio of U-233 Concentration to Thorium Concentration -- About 3

g U-233/kg thorium (see Fig. 8) produces the lowest unit cost for
thorium concentrations of 1000 g Th/liter. Here also, only slight

changes in unit cost are produced by wide variations in the ratio

‘of U-233 to thorium.

6)

 

-19-

Poison Concentration -- The core poisons which are related
to the core processing cycle time have little effect on

the unit cost in the range 4 - 10% (see Fig. 7). The gross
breeding ratio (processing losses neglected) increases

almost linearly with reduction in poisons. Below 3% poisons,
however, the net U-253 production and net breeding ratio
decrease since the highly increased chemical processing

rate leads to significant uranium and protactinium losses.

In similar fashion, if the blanket U-233 concentration were
lowered to small values, the increased chemical procegsing
rate required would likewise cause large fissionable material
losses, as well as high chemical processing costs.
Temperature -- Under conditions assumed, no optimum temper-
ature was found for the range of average reactor temperatures
considered. Lower unit cost is obtained by increasing the
temperature, but Fig. 10 indicates that little is to be

gained by raising the average temperature appreciably over

280%. An average reactor temperature of 280°C will probably

correspond to an exit temperature of about 300°C.

If engineering considerations preclude core power densities appreci-

ably over 100

kw/liter, it would be necessary to increase the core size or

operate with a larger portion of the total power in the blanket. The

former course

appears economically preferable. The reactors with five-

and six-foot cores shown in Table II where typical results for several condi-

tions are shown, have power densities of 210 and 122 kw/liter, respectively.

In order tbo reduce the power density of the five-foot core to 122 xw/liter,

 

 
 

EE -20-

it would be necessary to operate with a U-233 concentration in the
blanket of about 12 g/kg of thorium. The cost of power would rise to
about 7 mills/kwh, the increase being due primarily to increased inven-
tory charges. The use of a 6-foot core, on the other hand, results in
a power cost of 6.45 mills/kwh.
Effect of Group-3 Poison Cross Section Variations

The results of reducing the group-3 poison cross section from
40 to 18 barns at 20°C are shown in Fig. 7. The higher value is a
conservative one that has been used in previous stuaies(3), the lower
value is the latest estimte’ 10) for thorium-uranium reactors. In
general, reducing the poison cross section by over a factor of two
reduces the net unit cost by 0.1 mill/kwh and shifts the optimum
core pojgons from T to Gh. The core cycle time is the only result
appreciably affected (see Table II). A change greater than a factor
of two in the group-3 poison cross section (see Fig. 9) does not
appreciably affect the optimum U-233 concentration in the blanket
or the optimum blanket thickness of 2 and 2-1/4 feet for the 6-foot
and 5-foot cores respectively. |
Effect of External Power Density Variations

Other than plant investment the largest single cost is the
inventory charge -- nearly one mill/kwh when using values of 20
and 14 kw/liter external power densities (previously used in
ORNL-1642 by Briggs) for the core and blanket systems respectively.
The effect of increasing these external power densities is shown in

Fig. 11. Doubling the core external power density of 20 kw/liter

reduces the cost 0.25 mill/kwh, but doubling the blanket external

 

 

 
 

SE ae

power density of 14 kw/liter saves only 0.07 mills/kwh. The saving
realized from further increases in power density rapidly decrease.
A recent design(d) of the TBR indicates that it is possible to
achieve external power densities as high as 61 and 55 kw/liter for
the core and blanket systems respectively. For this condition the
cost is 5.8 mills/kwh, only 0.11 mill/kwh lower than for 40 and 28
kw/liter. For these calculations, it was assumed that no change

in capital or operating expense was necessary to achieve higher
power densities.

Effect of Errors in the Nuclear Constants

The two group nuclear constants which were estimated for use
in the nuclear calculations are probably accurate to within 10-20%.
The effect of such errors on the process characteristics and econ-
omics was uncertain. Consequently, a study of the effect of
substantial changes (* 50%) in the nuclear constants was made for
a typical case¥,

Although the critical concentration and breeding ratio were
changed considerably, the changes in power costs were relatively
small being principally confined to altering the amount of credit
obtained from excess fuel production. The largest change observed
vas a difference of about 0.6 mill/kwh between two extreme cases.
Where only individual constants were altered, changes in the net
cost were less than 0.1 mill/kwh.

Considerable changes in the core uranium concentration do not ;

however, lead to proportionally large variation in fuel inventory

 

*The single exception to this procedure was the restriction of (23)
to the range 2.28 to 2.36, the approximate limits of accuracy in
this quantity cited in BNL 221.

 

 
 

charges since the latter contain contributions of similar magnitude from
the blanket system. Thus, for two cases where the uranium concentration
differed by a factor of over 4, the fuel inventory charge differed by a
factor of 1.4. The effects upon breeding gain are, on the other hand,
almost directly converted into changes in credit received for excess fuel
production.

It seems reasonable therefore to conclude that errors in the two-
group constants are of secondary economic importance since 85% of the
power cost is tied up in factors unaffected by such errors.

A summary of the results and constants used is presented in Table III.
The most important cost increases were those produced by increases in the
quantities LY 0a, Pgs and decreases in Naz Increasing Tg produces
a rise in fast leakage at the expense of resonance capture in thorium,
vhile all other neutron losses remain practically unaffected. Raising
oa) 5 causes protactinium absorption to rise at the expense of thorium
capture, as well as a change in core isotope ratios leading to higher
capture rates in U-234, 235 and 236. An increase in resonance escape
probability raises blanket power, increases leakage, depresses resonance
capture, and increases thermal capture. A decrease in both resonance
and thermal capture in thorium is the principal result of a fall in #)(23)
of 0.04 (1.7%).

The critical concentration was most strongly affected by T. Does
and, naturally, 7). A 50% rise in the first two produced a critical
concentration increase of about 30%, while the 1.T% rise in (23)
caused a 4.4% decrease in concentration. The breeding ratio was not

significantly affected by. changing either T. or D,,-

 

 
 

SE 2s.

None of the quantities investigated had a significant effect upon
blanket processing except py, for which a decrease of 50% led to a 12%
decrease in cycle time. The core thorex cycle was affected mainly by
the diffusion constants ard Ts the greatest — observed, produced
by lowering Door was a decrease of cycle time by about 13k days out of
337. However, no significant changes were noted in either core or
blanket chemical processing costs.

Accuracy of the Two Group Model and the Caleulation of Breeding Ratio

For the large reactors studied, the two group procedure should
provide an adequate estimate of the critical mass. The breeding ratio
is, however, far more sensitive to inadequacies in the method. For
example, difficulty arises in selecting a method of treating thorium
resonance captures. In this work, fast neutrons were assumed to
slow down without absorption, and captures due to resonance absorption
were computed by multiplying the number slowed into the thermal group
by (1-p). This treatment overestimates the fast leakage by about
a factor of 3. Consequently, the breeding ratio as reported in
Table IT for a typical case may be low by about 0.02.

| A much more serious source of inaccuracy results from uncertainties
in 7. Errors in the thermal value of 7 way produce an uncertainty of
+ 0.03 in the breeding ratio. Resonance captures in uranium may reduce
the breeding ratio by 0.08 if the resonance integral of U-233 is 1500
b and resonance ¢ is as high as unity.

New data concerning the resonance integral of protactinium

(650 b) and the thermal cross section (63 b) reported by R. R. smitn( 1)

have only a slight effect on the breeding gain for the case of a

1000 g Th/liter slurry; the absorptions in protactinium decrease by

 

 
 

 

A -2h-

only 0.002 absorptions per absorption in U-233.

 

Uncertainties in the poison cross section may be expected to have
little effect since it has been shown in a previous section that poison
levels may be varied over a range of 4-10% without appreciable cost
variation.

To sum up, the decrease in the breeding ratio produced by the factors
discussed above may be expected to be no greater than 0.13. While this
number represents an important uncertainty in estimated production of new

material, its overall economic significance is slight.

Accuracy of Cost Estimate

The net unit cost of power as determined for two-region reactors near
optimum cost (6.2 mills/kwh) is a result that is based on the limited
experience available. Obviously, the uncertainty of this result is large
enough to span the competitive cost range for a nuclear power industry.

An estimate as to the overall accuracy is best made by assessing the
accuracy of the individual cost items that comprise the net unit cost of
pover.

The largest single item is the reactor and turbogenerator plant
investment which represents 60% of the total unit cost. Of this cost, 75%
is for the turbogenerator plant and 25% is for the reactor and associated
equipment. Other cost items are relatively small portions of the total;
the largest of these, the inventory charge, is 15% of the net unit cost.

Some of the individual costs comprising the net cost of power have
a fairly firm basis and error limits based on experience can be assigned
with a fair degree of confidence. These items are capitel investment,
maintenance and operation for the turbogenerator plant; capital invest-

ment for the reactor plant and associated equipment; inventory and

 

 
 

 

 

EE e5-

feed costs. Other charges which cannot be assigned error limits with any
degree of certainty are maintenance and operation of the reactor plant
and chemical processing. Fortunately, the individual costs that rest on
a fairly firm basis comprise approximately 80% (based on the total cost
without breeding credit) of the cost of power.

The accuracy of the turbogenerator plant investment cost is estimated
at *15%. Far such a plant, based on vast industrial experience, the error
limit could be narrowed with a definite site selection and the establish-

ment of detailed design criteria (for example, nearly 6% cost reduction could

(3)

be achieved by installing the turbogenerators outdoors). Briggs sets an

error range of O to +30% on the estimated cost of the reactor plant since
the figures used do not allow for construction contingencies. For mainten-
ance and operation of the turbogenerator plant, a fairly well known quantity,
a +15% assessment of the accuracy should be adequate.

It is difficult to estimate an error limit for the maintenance and
operating cost assumed for the reactor plant since a design in which these
costs are under control has not yet been visualized. Ultimately, they
might be expected to approach the costs for modern, conventional plants.

An error of O to +100% is assumed because of the unknown factors involved.

The error limits for the fixed chemical processing costs (investment,
operation and maintenance) also are difficult to estimate. A value of
+25% is assumed here. Based on various designs and limited data, arguments
could be advanced for either raising or lowering the cost used. It is
felt that the part of the processing cost that is a function of the through-

put is as low as can be expected in the near future; consequently, a

0 to +100% limit is assumed.

 
 

A _26-

The nuclear and isotope calculations are probably accurate to within

 

+15%. Consequently, cost items (uranium inventory, thorium feed, breeding
gains, and, to some extent, processing rates) based on these results have
about the. same degree of uncertainty if the external power density is
assigned approximately the same error range.

- Applying the estimated limits of accuracy to the cost items comprising
the 6.2 mills /kwh for a near optimum reactor, a cost range of 5.3 to 8.0
mills /kvh is obtained.

The cost of D0 and the inventory charge (12% and $40/1b used in
this study) for non-depreciating items is gub ject to government control
and at present it is difficult to predict the changes in the future.

The latest proposed pricing policy by the Atomic Energy Commission lists
the cost of D0 as $28/1b and requires only a 4% inventory or rental
charge for non-depreciating items. Applying these proposed costs, the

unit cost of power will be in the range of 4.6 to 7.2 mills/kvh.

ONE-REGION REACTORS

Methods and Conditions

Use of slurry in the one-region reactor system precludes hydraulic
separation as a method of poison removal. All poison removal must
be done in the more expensive Thorex plant. It was assumed that the
fuel would be in the form of a U03-ThO, slurry in D0.

The calculations for the one-region reactor were considerably easier
than for the two-region reactors. No iteration is required to determine
the resonance to thermal absorption in the thorium. Therefore, it is
possible to write a set of equations covering the isotope concentrations
and the nuclear calculations which could be solved simultaneously by a
simple iterative procedure.

The independent variables were reactor size, thorium concentration,
process cycle time and external power density.

It is to be noted that the basic configuration of a three-reactor
power station has been preserved here in order to provide as close a
comparison as possible of the two systems. It may be argued that such
a scheme places the one-region system at an initial disadvantage
because of the much lower power density which results. The underlying
philosophy of the three-reactor station was to limit the individual
power sources to the order of 100 Mw of electricity because of network
considerations. Possibly 375 Mw of electrical power from a two-reactor

station composed of one-region reactors would be more economical.

 
 

amu Ae

Fission Product Poisons

 

The fission product poisons were handled in the same fashion as the
two-region reactor. Since only the Thorex process is used, the equation

for the processing cycle time is similar to equation (6).

PT yee

Isotope Concentrations and Critical Equation

As in the two-region calculation, the higher isotopes of thorium and
of uranium beyond U-236 need not be considered. In addition, the effect
of the U-238 added with the enriched feed (9%.5% U-235, 2.0% U-234, and
4.5% U-238) for the non-breeders was neglected because of the small

quantity and small cross section. The critical equation is simply
. 2 2
p [1(25) T,(25) + (23) By (23)] = (2 +7) (By + 28°)

and the relationship for the resonance to thermal absorption can easily

be shown to be

For breeder reactors the set of equations shown above (22 through 30) was

 

solved simultaneously by iterative methods with the feed of U-235 (F25) set
equal to zero. However, to handle the case of breeders and non-breeders
with the same general method, another equation is used that relates the
gross breeding ratio (no chemical losses), chemical processing losses

(0.1% used for all reactors) and the U-235 feed for the non-breeders.
Obviously just enough U-235 must be added to make the net breeding ratio
equal to one. Therefore by a direct material balance (or by combining

equations 25, 26, and 28 and assigning a processing loss),

(Bp-1) + =.(25 35) + $7125) EN PIN CEES WE) I =0 (31)

In brief the calculation was performed in the following manner.

 

For a particular value of power (P), reactor diameter (for a sphere
B= z ) process cycle time (T) and thorium concentration (N(02)), the
critical equation (eq. 22) was used to calculate the concentration of
U-233 with no poisons, Pa or higher isotopes of uranium. The other
isotopes were then calculated with F(25) = 0 for the first iterationm.
Then equation (28) was used to compute F(25). If F(25) was minus,
the reactor was a breeder and the iteration with F(25) = O was con-
tinued until the desired accuracy (20.01%) was attained. If the

reactor was a non-breeder, the percentage recycle, gq, was set equal

to 0.999 (all recycled minus the 0.1% processing loss) and the value

 

 
 

a 6-

 

of F(25) computed from equation (31) was used in each successive iter-
ation until sufficient convergence occurred. Hand calculations of this
nature would be quite laborious, requiring several hours of computation
for each reactor. All the required instructions and equations, however,
were easily coded and the ORACLE averaged only around 15 seconds per

reactor calculation.

Cost Estimation

No attempt was made to estimate the-investment cost of the one-
region plant. For initial comparison purposes, it can be assumed that
this cost is comparable to that of the two-region plant.

All other cost factors are the same as used for the two-region

study.

aoa

All results are for 125 Mw of electrical power delivered to a
power grid for a one-region reactor operating at an average temperature
of 280% (equivalent to 480.8 Mw of heat with a net station efficiency
of 261). An external power density of 20 kw/liter was used in all
cases.

The unit cost of power is shown as a net partial cost in the
following table and graphs. This cost is the sum of the inventory
charges, feed (thorium and for non-breeders U-235), D,0 makeup and
chemical processing charges that are a function of throughput minus
the credit for breeding gain, if any. Costs not included are the fixed
charges on the plant investment (reactor, turbogenerator and chemical

processing), fixed operating costs for the chemical processing plant

 

 
aE - WE

and operating and maintenance which is usually taken as a percentage of
the plant investment (3% in the two-region study). The comparable fixed
cost for the two-region reactors is 5.25 mills/kwh. Consequently, for
initial comparison, the total unit cost can be obtained by adding the
fixed cost of 5.25 mills/kwh to the net partial unit costs shown.

The results for 5 reactor sizes of interest at near optimum conditions
are presented in Table IV. It is immediately apparent that for one-region
reactors near the optimum cost conditions large breeding gains cannot
‘be obtained and high isotdpic purity (~~95%) U-25% cannot be produced
without a protactinium recovery process. This would involve separation
of protactinium from the uranium isotope mixture as soon as practical
‘after discharge from the reactor. Such a procedure would not ordinarily
be required for the two-region reactor since a product of about 95%
purity 1s expected.

The effect of the chemical processing cycle (determines the fission
poison level) is shown in Figures 12, 13, and 14 for the reactor diameters
from 10 to 16 ft. In general the optimum cycle time increases with
increase in thorium concentration and reactor diameter; the optimum cycle
time for the reactors near optimum cost appear to be about twice as large
as for a two-region machine. For non-breeders it was assumed that a
30-day supply of U-235 feed was on hand, but no reserve supply of fission-
able material was assumed for breeders. Thus the loss in credit from the
breeding gain and the additional inventory charge caused the abrupt
changes in slope that appear in the graphs at the point of change:
from breeder to non-breeder.

The net partial cost as a function of diameter and thorium concen-

tration at optimum cycle time (determined from Figures 12, 13, and 1h)

 

 

 
 

 

is shown in Figure 15. It is apparent that, for the reactor sizes of
interest, the optimum thorium concentrations are between 200 and 300 g/liter.
The effect of reactor diameter (determined from Figure 15) on the
partial unit cost of power for optimum process cycle times and thorium con-
centrations is shown in Figure 16. The minimum partial unit cost of 1.88
mills /kwh occurs for a reactor size of 12 ft with a thorium concentration
of 260 g/liter. From a cost viewpoint there is little variation in the
range of reactor sizes from 10 to 1h ft, the maximum difference being only
0.12 mills/kwh,
The comparable minimum partial cost for the two-region reactor is
0.97 mills/kwh. Therefore, a cost differential of 0.9 mills/kwh seems to
exist in favor of the two-region reactor provided that the fixed costs for
the two reactor types are equal. This difference is, of course, uncertain
because of possible unforeseen engineering difficulties which may arise
in the course of construction and operation of either type reactor. It
is not unreasonable to suppose, for instance, that fixed costs may be
somewhat smaller for the one-region reactor because of simpler construction.
Clearly, questions such as these can be resolved only by comparison of the

performance of actual reactors.
