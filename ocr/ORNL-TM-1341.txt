ABSTRACT

A non-age-hardenable, high-strength alloy was developed at the

.Oak Ridge National Laboratory for use as the primary containment mate-

rial for the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). The alloy was
tailored to give good strength, ductility and corrosion resistance to
molten fluoride salts in the 1100 to 1500°F temperature range. The
work reported here concerns the elevated-temperature mechanical proper-

ties of welds made in this alloy, known as INOR-8, as represented by

~

. several heats of MSRE-grade material.

Tensile tests on transverse weld samples in the as-welded and
annealed conditions show a good combination of strength and ductility
at temperatures ranging from 70 to 1800°F. Tensile properties of these
‘weld samples compare favorably with those of the base metal. Stress
relieving at 1600°F for 2 hr results in a Lowering of. the tensile yield:
strength. Cresp-rugture tests at 1100, 1300 and 1500°F on “these same
type specimens show significant improvement in strength and ductility
at 1300°F following a hydrogen atmosphere stress relief. Both as-
welded and stress-relieved creep-rupture behsvior was as good as the

base metal behavior. The nil-ductility temperature, as determined by

INTRODUCTION

In order to fully realize the potential of nuclear reactor systems
utilizing molten fluoride salts as fuel, the structural materials must
possess adequate combinations of strength, ductility, and corrosion
resistance at temperatures in the 1100-1500°F temperature range. The
non-age-hardenable nickel -mol ybdenun-chromiun-i ron alloy, designated as
INOR-8 [Ni-17 Mo~7 Cr—5 Fe (wt %)] is such an alloy and was the culmina-
tion of a comprehensive alloy development and evaluation program carried
out at the Osk Ridge National Laboratory. > It is now commercially
available®* and is the primary containment material for the Molten Salt
Reactor Experiment which achieved criticality on June 1, 1965, at Oak
Ridge, Tennessee. A vital part of the overall welding study on INOR-8
was the determination of the 'elevated-temperature mechanical properties
of welds. This report summarizes the findings on the mechanical behavior

of welds in some of the actual heats of material used in the MSRE,

‘MATERIALS, TESTING PROCEDURE AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Transverse samples machined from 1l-in,-thick welds, made under
highly restrained conditions were used in the testing. These butt welds
were fabricated in the manner illustrated in Fig. 1 and described in

earlier work.? The transverse tensile specimens used were of the -

design shown in Fig. 2. The manual gas tungsten arc-welding process

was used to fabricate the joints; the filler metal used was of the

same nominal composition as the base metal.

The INOR-8 material used

in this study was taken from the stock purchased for construction of

the MSRE. The heat numbers and the tests to which each heat of INOR-8

was subjected are ‘tabulated below.

The chemical analyses of these heats are presented in Table 1. Note

that the filler metal used to fabricate the weld specimens was taken

from heat numbers 5055 end 5090.

Because of material fabrication schedules, it was necessary to do

the welding operations on plate which had the final rolling operation

performed normal to the welding direction.

This schedule caused the

ys

materials' inherent stringer line to be located in the plate-thickness

- direction and parallel to the fusion line.

the weld fusion line area is shown in Fig. 3. This view illustrates the
orientation of the stringer formation with respect to the fusion line
and its perpendicular orientation with respect to the welding direction
and specimen axis.’

The transverse weld specimens contained weld metal, heat-affected
zones, and base metal and were tested at elevated temperatures in
standard tensile tests (0.03 min-1) and in creep tests. Elevated-
temperature tensile tests were performed between 600 and 1800°F at
200°F intervals, and creep testing was done at 1100, 1300 and 1500°F.
The specimens were tested in both the as-welded and stress-relieved A -
conditions, with stress relieving being performed in both argon and
- hydrogen atmospheres (2 hr at 1600°F). Samples were also machined from
the as-received base metal for the determination of elevated-temperature
hot ductility after being subjected to simulated heat-affected zone
thermal cycles.

The room- and elevated-temperature tensile tests were run in air
using a standard 12,000-1b capacity hydraulic testing machine at a
crosshead speed of 0.05 in. /min or a strain rate of 3.33%/min. Stress~

strain relationships were obtained using load cell-deflectometer out-

a

puts. Elevated-temperature tests were performed using a clamshell-
type furnace, in which specimens were allowed a 1/2-hr equilibration
period to reach the test temperature. The results of these tests for
the as-welded and stress-relieved conditions are presented in Tables
2 and 3 for test temperatures between room temperature and 1800°F.

The creep tests were run in air using standard lever arm testing

machines, and strain data were obtained through dial-gage extensometers \&

attached to the specimen grips, A detailed tabulation of the average
values of the creep-rupture test results are given in Table 4.

All heat treatments prior to testing were carried out in either an
argon or hydrogen atmosphere. . The specimens were cooled from the annealing
temperature by pulling them from the hot zone into the water-cooled end
of the furnace muffle, Thermocouples, which were attached to the speci-
mens during the heat treatment, recorded an average cooling rate down to
500°F of approximately 250°F/min. .The thermal treatment used, 2 hr at
1600°F, is the standard stress relieving treatment specified for INOR-8

material.

Atconvenient method for measuring overall weldability is a hot
ductility test, which has been developed by Nippes and Savage of
Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute.% This test synthetically reproduces,
in a laboratory specimen, the time-temperature cycle experienced by any
selected point in the heat-affected zone of an arc weld. Samples were
taken from all the heats tabulated previously (p. 4) and subjected to
this hot ductility test. The results of these tests will be treated in

the following section.

DISCUSSION AND EVALUATION OF RESULTS

Tensile Tests

The average tensile properties of specimens in the as-welded
condition (heats 5062, 5071 and 5074), hydrogen stress-relieved con-
dition (heats 5070 and 5073), and argon stress-relieved condition
(heats 5064, 5075 and 5081) are presented in Figs. 4, 5 and 6. These
figures show ultimate tensile strength, 0.2% offset yield strength and
elongation vs temperature. The scatter bands for wrought metal shown
in the figures were teken from earlier work. >

A quelification on the comparisons between transverse weld sample
properties and wrought metal properties should be made at this point.
Figure 7 illustrates specimen and stringer orientations which were
encountered in these two classes of specimens. Note that, as previously
mentioned, the material fabrication schedules resulted in the stringers
of the transverse weld samples being oriented normal to the stress direc-
tion. This stress direction is the y-direction in Fig. 7. The wrought
material investigation’ done previously did not include specimens cut
parallel to the y-direction. The fact that these plates were not thick
enough to yield reasonably large specimens in the y-direction plus the
assumption of symmetry of properties about the z-axis led to the omission.

| Only slight variations in ultimate strengths were observed

between the as-welded and stress-relieved tests; although, at the lower
testing temperatures these strengths were less than those for the |
wrought metal. In the case of the yield strengths noticeable differences
existed between the as-welded samples and stress-relieved samples. As-

welded specimen yield strengths were consistently higher than those of

specimens tested after stress relieving; 10 difference in annealing atmos-
phere was observed except at room temperature, Yield strengths for trans-
verse specimens in all conditions were generally higher than the wrought
metal yield strengths. | |

The total elongation data, presented in Tables 2 and 3 and depicted

graphically in Fig. 6, show that the overall ductility of welds is less
5 ©

than that observed in the wrought metal. However, this difference is

probably due to the specimen orientation, as previously explained, Stress

relieving produces a general improvement of this property at all test

~ temperatures, with argon providing a slightly better atmosphere than

hydrogen.
The macrographs of Figs. 8, 9, and 10 illustrate the variations in

fracture location with each heat and with test temperature. The as-welded

tests in heat 5074 of Fig. 8 exhibit failures in the base metal, except at

1400 and 1600°C, with low ductilities (Table 2) as compared with the weld
metal failures in heat 5062 of Fig, 9. The variation of fracture loca-
tions with temperature for the stress-relieved heat 5070 (Fig. 10) is .
typical of specimens tested in this condition.

On the basis of the data presented above on the Wltimate and yield

strengths the assumption of symmetry in strength properties seems Justified,

The ductility data, however, and in particular the ductility of those spe-

" cimens which fractured predominantly in the base metal, suggest that the

strain-at-fracture properties of INOR-8 are not symmetrical about the
z axis, oo i

Metallographic exaninstion was performed on one heat tested in the
as-welded condition (5074) and one heat in the stress-relieved condition

(5073). ‘The micrographs shown in Fig. 11A and 11B for the 1800°F tests

are representative of the base metal failures of all the tensile tests.

All failures, whether in the base metal or weld metal, were generally
intergranular. As noted by McCoy, © most of the small base metal cracks
appear to have been initiated by cracks in the precipitates. Here, as in
McCoy's work, the intergranular cracks are predominantly normal to the
applied stress with their lengths comparable to the grain diameter. As can
be seen in Fig. 11, the cracks are parallel to and exist primarily in the

stringer line.

Creep-Rupture Tests

J
—

Creep-rupture data for specimens in the as-welded and argon or
hydrogen stress-relieved conditions are presented graphically in Figs.
12-15. Average values of rupture time vs applied stress at 1100, 1300
and 1500°F are presented in Fig. 12. These studies indicate that as-
welded specimens possess stress-rupture strengths equivalent to those of
the base metal at all test temperatures, Stress relieving, using a hydro-
gen atmosphere, created a significant improvement in the creep properties of
samples tested at 1300°F., A factor of two improvement was noted in both the
time-to-rupture and the total strain properties shen this treatment was em-
ployed (see Table 4). The creep-rupture tests on stress-relieved samples
at 1100 and 1500°F showed little or no improvement over as-welded proper-
ties. The curves of Fig. 13 illustrate the stress-temperature relationships
necessary to cause rupture in 10, 100 and 500 hr for these composite speci-
mens. The improvement over the as-velded strength at 1300°F by stress
relieving in hydrogen at 1600°F for 2 hr is vividly shown in this figure.
The minimum creep rate for tests on as-welded and stress-relieved

specimens, shown in Figs. 14 and 15, respectively, was generally observed

to be slightly lower than that found for wrought metal at all test tem-
peratures and stresses... One exception to this general observation was
noted for stress-relieved specimens tested at 1100°F.

Metallographic examination of several creep-rupture specimens
revealed that stress relieving had the general effect of shifting the
rupture location from the base metal to the weld metal, The fracture of

the as-welded specimen in Fig. 16 shows a typical intergranular failure
in base metal, with associated grain-boundary cracking normal to the
applied stress. The appearance of the base metal cracks is very similar
. to those discussed above for the short-time tensile tests. The weld |
metal failure of Fig. 16 is typical of creep best fractures observed in

stress-relieved specimens. Some fractures of specimens in this condition

were observed to occur along the weld fusion line,

Hot, Ductility Tests
Hot ductility experiments using synthetic heat-affected zone speci-
mens revealed the elevated-temperature nil-ductility point for this mater-
ial to be 2300°F as shown in Fig. 17. The area of the heat-affected zone
which would experience this maximum peak temperature corresponds to a plane

calculated to be 0,032 in, from the weld fusion line. The curves of this

ih

figure indicate that reasonable sSeciery of the mechanical properties after
heating to the nil-ductility temperature was exhibited, although some dam-
age occurred as a result of the welding thermal cycle. Since no attempt

| was nade to identify each sample with a heat number, the observed behavior
is considered to be typical of MSRE reactor grade INOR-8.

the motion of the grain boundaries and cause them to be quite irregular.

These boundaries etch rapidly and appear quite broad, indicating that,

possibly, an impurity layer is present. Earlier studies have shown that
by very rapid cooling from very high temperatures (2500°F) , the pre-
cipitate or stringer particles appear to be converted to an intergranular
lamellar product. ‘Gross formation of this product throughout the heat-
affected zone of INOR-8 welds could cause permanent damage, resulting in
almost certain failure under high restraint. The hot ductility tests
conducted here do not indicate that this condition is a serious problem
for the material investigated.
- © CONCLUSIONS

It appears from this study that the room- and elevated-temperature
mechanical properties of welds in INOR-8 compare favorably with the”
base metal properties.’ Tensile testing of these transverse specimens
showed that this material possessed a good combination of strength and
ductility, Stress relieving produced the general effect of lowering
the 0.2% offset yield strength. The creep studies of as-welded samples
indicated that they possessed stress-rupture properties equivalent to
those of base metal at all test temperatures. Stress relieving, using
a hydrogen atmosphere, caused a significant improvement in the creep

properties of samples tested at 1300°F. Heat-affected zone hot ductility

‘experiments established the nil-ductility temperature for this material

to be 2300°F, with reasonable mechanical property recovery after

experiencing this temperature.
