FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at ORNL
records the technical progress of the research on the circulating-fuel reactor and all other
ANP research at the Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided
into three major ports: |. Reactor Theory and Design, Il. Materials Research, and lil.
Shielding Research. Each part has a separate introduction and summary.

The ANP Project is comprised of about 300 technical and scientific personnel engaged
in many phases of research directed toward the achievement of nuclear propulsion of
aircraft. A considerable portion of this research is performed in support of the work
of other organizations participating in the national ANP effort. However, the bulk of the
ANP research at ORNL is directed toward the development of a circulating-fuel type of
reactor.

The nucleus of the effort on circulating-fuel reactors is now centered upon the Aircraft
Reactor Experiment — a high-temperature prototype of a circulating-fuel reactor for the
propulsion of aircraft. The equipment for this reactor experiment is now being assembled;
the current status of the experiment is summarized in Section 1 of Part I. The supporting
research on materials and problems peculiar to the ARE ~ previously included in the
subject sections — is now included in this ARE section, where convenient. The few
exceptions are referenced to the specific section of the report where more detailed infor-
mation may be found.

The ANP research, in addition to that for the Aircraft Reactor Experiment, falls into
three general categories: (1) studies of aircraft-size circulating-fuel reactors, (2) materials
problems associated with advanced reactor designs, and (3) studies of shields for nuclear
aircraft, These three phases of research are covered in Parts |, ll, and ll, respectively,
of this report.
 
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

Assembly of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment
{sec. 1) is nearing completion; all but a few of the

components have been received and installed. The

items still missing include the new control rod
sleeves and parts of the fuel and sodium gas-sealed
pumps. As the installation progresses, various
auxiliary systems, such as the helium, water, and
hydraulic off-gas systems, are being subjected to
operational tests. Tests of a prototype pump have
established the design criteria for the pump cooling
and lubricating systems, as well as the operating
characteristics of the pump.
sleeves will effect a reduction in the structural
poison in the core and hence reduce the critical
mass. Recent physics calculations indicate that
the uranium requirement inside the pressure shell
will be well under 40 Ib of U235, Other physics
calculations on reactor kinetics reveal that reactor
operation and control will not be adversely affected
by either xenon poisoning or the loss of delayed
neutrons in the circulating fuel. The fuel, which
will be obtained by the addition of a concentrate,
Na,UF , to a solvent mixture, NaZrF_, has been
shown to be reasonably compatible with the Inconel
container metal for the temperatures and times
required. Production of both the solvent and con-
centrate are essentially complete and the impurities
in each are well below acceptable levels. Pro-
cedures have been established to assure that the
fuel and sodium systems in the experiment will be
adequately cleaned prior to being filled with the
solvent and sodium, respectively. Additional
studies of the fuel recovery and processing problem
have established dissolution rates for both molten

and solid fuel in batches containing 4 kg of U235,

With the near-completion of the Aircraft Reactor
Experiment the emphasis of the experimental work
has shifted to the development of components for
general aircraft reactor application and supporting
research. Valves, pumps, bearings and other
components of high-temperature fluoride and liquid
metal systems are being developed for these studies
(sec. 2). Satisfactory, short, frozen-sodium shaft
seals, with length-to-inside-diameter ratios of 1'to
5, have been developed for sodium pumps. A small
gas-sealed pump for an in-pile loop and a canned

The new control rod

magneticstorque transmitter for a high-temperature
aircraft pump are being developed. Packed seals
for fluoride pumps and valves have achieved {imited
success under controlled conditions, but none of
the seals are sufficiently reliable for service
conditions. Equipment for high-temperature bearing
tests is being assembled, and a number of potential
bearing materials are being screened on the basis
of wear. A fluoride-to-sodium heat exchange tube
bundle and a high-velocity forced-convection cor-
rosion loop are being operated, but resuits are not
yet available on either test.

The designs of a family of 50- to 300-megawatt
reflector-moderated reactors have been prepared to
permit an Air Force evaluation of over-all aircraft
performance (sec. 3). The four reactors considered
for 50-, 100-, 200-, and 300-megawatt power out-
puts are all of the same general species, having
all been extrapolated from the same base. The
designs are based upon presumed fuel and were
made with ‘insufficient physics information for the
establishment of over-all design limitations. In
other respects, however, the designs are on a firmer
basis, since considerable shielding and heat
exchanger data are availableand the hydrodynamics
of the fuel circuit and fuel pump have been con-
firmed by hydraulic mockups. The gas-sealed
centrifugal pump is designed with special baffling
above the impeller so that it will opercte con-
tinvously with its shaft 80 deg from the vertical,
and it will even operate for 1 min when inverted
without *‘gassing®’ the pump. Other aspects of the
aircraft reactor, including moderator cooling,
assembly of the reactor, control, and fuel filling
and draining, are discussed.

The Critical Experiment Facility was used during
this quarter to determine the static physics charac
teristics of o mockup of an air-cooled water-
moderated reactor for the General Electric Aircraft
Nuclear Propulsion Project (sec. 4). At the same
time, preparations were made for measurements of a
mockup of ‘a Pratt and Whitney supercritical-water
reactor and a Nuclear Development Associates
sodium-cooled reactor, as well as the Laboratory’s
reflector-moderated reactor.
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

1. CIRCULATING-FUEL AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

E. S. Bettis

Jo Li Meem

ANP Division

There were no modifications in the ARE design
or critical developments in the ARE program during
the quarter, and therefore installation of equipment
received maximum attention. The installation is
proceeding satisfactorily, ond there was no major
holdup occasioned by lack of components. For the
first time since the project began, it is not neces-
sary to explain either the cause for some delay or
some change in plan, and this is the most signifi-
cant remark that can be made to indicate the status
the project attained during this quarter. It is fairly
clear now that completion of the installation of the
ARE can be effected in an uneventful manner.

One fuel pump sump tank and one sodium pump
sump tank were received, and therefore the instal
lation of piping for the fue! and sodium circuits
could proceed in a relatively uninhibited manner,
even though the spore fuel and spare sodium tanks
have not yet been received. Tests on a prototype
pump have established the requirements of the
auxiliary systems for the pumps, as well as the
pump’s operating characteristics and performance.

Since all major components of the experiment are
now on hand, all crafts have been able to proceed
with relatively little interference. Installation of
electrical heaters and insulation is progressing
rapidly, The heaters are approximately 65% in-
stalled, but, since the locations for the remaining
heaters are more accessible, the job is 75% com-
plete with regard to man-hours. Insulation work is
following closely behind heater installation. The
most difficult insulating job, that of insulating
tanks and lines in the dump tank pit, is 95% fin-
ished, ond about 15% of the other insulation has
been installed.

Additional data have been obtained from calcu-
lations of the reactor statics and dynamics. An
evaluation of the effects of xenon poisoning und of
the loss of delayed neutrons indicated that neither
will be of much consequence to reactor operation.
Calculations of the critical mass by two different
methods gave values which show that the uranium
requirement in the pressure shell will be well be-
low the 40 lb permissible from the viewpoint of
vranium allocation and ARE technology. A soving
in mass of about 4 Ib was realized by a reduction
in the poisoning from the control rod sleeves.

The new Inconel-clad control rod sleeves, which
will replace the three concentric rod sleeves that
were to be used arcund each rod, have been fabri-
cated. The space outside each new sleeve will be
filled with beryllium oxide strips. The reactor,
which is complete except for installation of the
new rod sleeves and the beryllium oxide strips, has
been subjected to preliminory cleaning tests.
Tests with simulated reactor fuel tubes indicate
that fully established turbulent flow will be real-
ized at a Reynolds number of 5000, which is well
under the ARE design value of 14,000,

The ultimate fuel will be obtained by the addi-
tion of sufficient fuel concentrate, Na, UF, to the
fuel solvent, NaZrF_, to make the reactor critical.
The production of the 3300 Ib of solvent was come
pleted some time ago, and conversion of the 115

kg of U235 into Na,UF is nearing completion,

Initial tests of the concentrate show that, with the
exception of one batch which was rejected, the
impurities in the concentrate are gratifyingly low.
Density and viscosity data have been obtained for
the concentrate,

Methods for recovering and reprocessing the fuel
after completion of the experiment have received
increased attention. Ht now appears that the used
fuel may be transported from the experiment to the
reprocessing area in aluminum containers contain.
ing 4 kg of U?35 and that about 20 such transfers
will be required. While the reprocessing procedures
had been established previously, additional data
have been obtained on dissolution rates for the
fuel in both liquid and molten states.

THE EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR

The reactor is completely assembled (Fig. 1.1)
except for the lnconel-clad stainless steel control
rod sleeves, which have not yet been received, and
the beryllium oxide strips that will be placed
around these sleeves, The fuel tubes have been
cleaned according to the established cleaning pro-
cedures. Additional measurements of flow phe-
nomena in glass mockups of the fuel tube indicate
that fully developed turbulent flow is realized at
Reynolds numbers above 5000, that is, well under
the reactor design value of 14,000.

Control Rod Sleeves

In order to reduce the structural poisons in the
reactor, it was decided to replace the three con-
centric Inconel sleeves around each of the four
control rods (one regulating and three safety) with
a single Inconel-clad stainless steel sleeve in
each hole, Fabrication of the new control rod
sleeves has been finished by the International
Nickel Company, but they have not yet been de-
livered,

To further reduce the critical mass of the reactor,
the volume outside the rod sleeve was to be packed
with beryllium oxide pellets. However, since the
beryllium oxide pellets would occupy only about
50% of the volume, it was recently decided to fill
this volume with strips from unused beryllium oxide
moderator blocks. It is anticipated that approxi-
mately 90% of the void volume can be filled with
the beryllium oxide strips.

Reactor Control

A. L. Southern J. K. Leslie
ANP Division

There has been only one change (on addition) to
the reactor control equipment. An auxiliary low-
speed drive has been designed for the regulating
rod. This addition was made to provide a means
of manually operating the regulating rod when the
reactor is operating at zero power during rod cali-
bration.

In the event of fission chamber failure or in-
adequate Ak in the regulating rod, it may be neces-
sary to change these components during the course
of the experiment. Consequently, some of the
drive mechanism has been relocated to facilitate
replacement of both the regulating rod and the
fission chambers. No other changes have been
made in the reactor controls and this phase of the
work is complete insofar as preliminary checking
can determine completeness.

Flow in Fuel Tubes

J. Lang Gv M. Winn
Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The experimental relationship between the friction
factor and the Reynolds modulus obtained in a
glass replica of the reactor fuel tube system

-—

indicated that the transition region (that region
which lies between laminar and fully developed
turbulent flow) lies approximately between Reynolds
moduli of 2000 and 5000. Recent photographs,
Figs. 1.2, 1.3, and 1.4, show the diffusion of dye

fuel tube under three Reynolds number flow con-
ditions: 600, 1300, and 2000, respectively, Un-
fortunately, there was more than one dye source
present in the entrance region of the fuel tube
system, and thus several filament trajectories
were superimposed. In general, the sharp, distinct
filaments shown in Figs. 1.2 and 1.3 are character-
istic of laminar flow, whereas the diffuse filaments
indicate some turbulence, Fig. 1.4.

Fuel Tube Cleaning
G. D. Whitman, ANP Division

The cleaning procedures for the fuel and sodium
systems inside ond outside the reactor are de-
scribed in a following subsection (cf., “Reactor
and Fluid Circuit Cleaning’). However, a de-
scription of the application of these procedures to
the actual cleaning of the reactor fuel tubes follows.

The six parallel! fuel circuits in the reactor were
first rinsed, individually, with tap water. This
flushing was accomplished by valving off the out-
lets of all but one circuit and passing water at a
pressure of 60 psi into the fuel inlet header.
Following this pressure flushing, each circuit was
flushed with distilled water, and the water was
blown out as completely as possible with helium.
After the water that could be blown out had been
removed, a vacuum system was connected through
a dry-ice cold trap to the fuel tubes, and the re-
maining water was evaporated from the fuel circuit
at room temperature. During the evaporation pro-
cess 2 cfth of helium was bled into the system inlet
to sweep out all moisture. The residual moisture
was determined by the Karl Fisher and dew-peint
methods.

The reactor will be complete when the control
rod sleeves and the bottom fuel outlet manifold
have been installed, and it will then be ready for
inclusion in the system.

REACTOR PHYSICS

W. K. Ergen J. Bengston
C. B. Mills, ANP Division

The UNIVAC multigroup calculations and the
locally performed two-group calculations gave
values which show that the reduction of the poison-
ing by the control rod sleeves has brought the ARE
uranium requirement in the pressure shell to well
below the 40 |b permissible from the viewpoint of
uranium allocation and ARE technology. The de-
layed neutrons lost from the reactor by fuel circu-
lation are predominantly those of long decay
constants, and hence a small amount of excess
reactivity makes it unnecessary for the reactor to
wait for the long-delayed neutrons. Small excess
reactivities will bring the reactor to relatively
short-time constants (10 sec or so), but when the
reactor is at such a time constant it is still sub-
stantially below the prompt-critical condition be-
cause the short-delayed neutrons are not appreciably
reduced by fuel circulation. Speculation as to the
xenon poisoning shows that the poisoning effect
would be easily observable if the xenon were not
lost from the fuel and if the xenon cross section
were as large for the ARE as it is for low-tempera-
ture reactors. Failure to observe the poisoning
might mean that Xe'3% or its parent iodine had
evaporated from the fuel, or it might mean that the
effective xenon cross section was reduced by the
high moderator and neutron temperature. In the
latter case, xenon poisoning would still be a prob-
lem in high-powered reactors of the ARE type.

Critical Mass

The multigroup calculations made by using the
UNIVAC at New York University and essentially
the method previously employed? by the ANP Phys-
ics Group have now yielded fairly reliable, though
not yet final, data regarding the uranium requirement
of the ARE. These data are in agreement with data
obtained by the two-group method, They indicate
that the elimination of much of the poison origi-
nally incorporated into the control rod sleeves has
brought the mass requirement to about 15% below
the 40 Ib which would be permissible from the
viewpoint of phase diagrams, corrosion, and
allocation.

Effect of Delayed Neutrons

About one half the delayed neutrons are given
off outside the reactor and lost from the chain re-
action. These delayed neutrons are predominantly
those with long-lived precursors. Most of the short-
lived precursors decay before they are swept out of
the reactor, and their delayed neutrons are hence
not appreciably reduced by the fuel circulation.
Since the neutrons with the long delay times are
not very effective, it will take only a small excess
reactivity to allow the chain reaction to proceed
without ‘‘waiting’’ for these neutrons. A small
excess reactivity will hence bring the reactor to a
relatively short time constant of about 10 seconds.
When the reactor is operating at full power, it will
probably exhibit small reactivity fluctuations, and
this may temporarily bring the reactor from just
critical (infinite period) to a period as low as 10
seconds. Hence, it might be difficult to keep the
reactor steadily at a period longer than 10 seconds.
It should be noted that reactivity fluctuations are
not expected at low power operation so that it
should be possible to operate the reactor on a
30-sec period during the preliminary, low-power
experiments. Because of the only slightly reduced
effectiveness of neutrons with short delay times,
the amount of additional reactivity required to
bring the reactor from a 10-sec period to prompt
critical is quite substantial, and the fuel circu-
lation of the ARE does not appreciably reduce this
safety feature below its value familiar in stationary-
fuel reactors.

Xenon Poisoning

Renewed consideration was given to the problem
of xenon poisoning of the ARE. There is reason to
believe that the Xe35, and probably also its parent
iodine, will evaporate from the fuel so that the
xenon poisoning effect will not occur in a reactor
of the circulating-fluoride-fuel type. Confirmation
of this would be a major accomplishment of the
ARE. To investigate the problem experimentally,
the reactor would have to be run for a time some-
what shorter than the half life of 1'33 at full
power and then reduced to very low power. If the
xenon poisoning is appreciable, the reactivity
will exhibit the characteristic behavior of first
dropping because of xenon formation by 1135 decay
and of then increasing because of Xe!35 decay.
Calculations performed by standard methods? show
that this behavior should be easily detectable if
the iodine and xenon do not evaporate from the
tuel. If the behavior is not found it could mean
that the poison is given off. However, it could also
mean that the xenon poisoning is largely reduced
by the high moderator and neutron temperature and
that the xenon cross section is rather
neutrons that are somewhat faster than room-temper-
ature thermal neutrons. If the latter explanation
even with reduced cross
section, would be a poison for reactors of higher
power than the ARE.

There is the interesting possibility that the
xenon, and maybe the iodine, is relessed from the

low for

were correct, xenon,

fuel at a rate comparable to the rate of radioactive
decay. If so, the build-up and decay of the xenon
poisoning could still be observed, but the time
constants would be different. A quantitative
analysis of the reactivity following a full-power run
would disclose this situation. There is also the
theoretical possibility that other fission fragments
have large absorption resonances at neutron
energies above those corresponding to the xenon
resonance. In high-temperature reactors such as
the ARE, these poisons might conceivably be

observable.

THE NaF-ZrF -UF FUEL

The reactor fuel will be obtained by the addition
of a sufficient amount of the fuel concentrate,
Na, UF, to the fuel solvent, NaZrF_, to make the
reactor critical. It is expected that the final fuel
composition will contain approximately 5.5 mole %
UF, In lieu of more precise knowledge of the
ultimate fuel composition, extensive material
research and physical property measurements have
been conducted on the fuel composition with 4 and
with 6.5 mole % UF ,, as well as on the carrier and
solvent. About 3300 Ib of the carrier hasbeen
produced and is being held under helium pending
its use in the experiment. The batch production of
the fuel concentrate is nearing completion. The
impurities in all but one of these batches were
exceptionally low, averaging {not including the one
poor batch) 48 ppm of Fe, 16 ppm of Cr, and 44 ppm
of Ni.

Physical Properties
H. F. Poppendiek

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The densities and viscosities of the fuel solvent,
NaZrF, and of the fuel concentrate, Na, UF , are
being measured; these properties of the fuel with
6.5 mole % UF, were reported previously.? Pre-

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1953

liminary density and viscosity values for Na, UF

are: viscosity, 17.5 cp at 725°C, 9.9 cp at 975°C;
density, 5.598 — 0.00119 T g/cm?, where 660°C <
T < 1000°C.

Fuel Production

G. J. Nessle J. E. Eorgan
F. A. Doss
Materials Chemistry Division

Production of the required 3300 ib of NaZrF is
now complete, and the material is being held under
helium pending its use in the ARE. Processing of
the 253 |b of U235 to produce the fuel concentrate,
Na UF, is nearing completion.

the fuel concentrate is being produced by the
Y-12 Production Division to permit control of the
large quantities of enriched uranium (93.5% U?3%)
involved. Several weeks were spent training
operators in the handling of the equipment, as well
as in testing the equipment. A few necessary
changes and repairs were made at that time. The
production equipment and the processing technique
are essentially the same as those previously
described’ for fuel solvent production.

The concentrate will be produced in 15 batches
of approximately 30 lb each. It has proved possible,
after some simple operational changes, to process
three batches of material per week. However, three
weeks of down-time have been necessary during
this period because of analytical difficulties and
lack of approval of an additional uranium allotment.
To date, 10 of the required 15 batches have been
processed, and it is estimoted that the production
operation will be completed before December 1.

As the material was produced by the Y-12
Production Division for use in the ARE, analyses
of the material were made by both the Y-12 and
the ORNL groups involved. Any differences in
these analyses were to be explained and corrected
by using, if necessary, the triplicate sample
originally = taken before production operations
proceeded. The analytical situation appears quite
satisfactory at present, insofar as production
control and fissionable material accountability is
concerned. Some discrepancies between the two
laboratories have occurred in determinations of the
uranium content of the UF; these difficulties have

been shown to be due to faulty sampling of some
poorly milled UF,. Agreement between the labc-
ratories on uranium content of the Na UF, has
been excellent; tentative plans call for accounta-
bility transfer of the material on the basis of these
analyses.

A comparison of the analytical data for eight of
the ten batches for which results are available is
shown in Table 1.1. It should be noted here
that the Y-12 laboratory used spectrographic
analysis for determining the metallic impurities,
while the ANP laboratory used chemical methods
of analysis. In general, the agreement is ex-
ceptionally good. One batch (AREU-4) must, on

the basis of these figures, be reprocessad to lower
the impurities to an acceptable level.

Corrosion of Inconel

G. M. Adamson W. D. Manly
Metallurgy Division

The corrosion of Inconel by fluoride fuels has
been discussed at length in this and preceding
quarterly reports. In loop tests in which the
fluoride is circulated at 4 gpm by thermal con-
vection, the maximum depth of attack is less than
10 mils after 500 hr at 1500°F. The recent cor-
rosion data emphasize the value of minimizing the
impurities in the fluoride and, to a lesser extent,

PUMPS

ANP Division

.

Developmental work on the gas-sealed pumps and
auxiliaries for the ARE has progressed to the point
where acceptance tests of the pumps for the ARE
and the mockup reliability test of a spare pump and
auxiliaries are being performed.

Parts for the two fuel and two sodium gas-sealed
sump-type pumps are being received; one pump
has been completely assembled and two others are
almost complete. The pumps for the two systems
will be identical except for minor differences in
the impeller designs and the volumes of the sump
tanks, since the fuel pump sump tank must provide
volume for the addition of the fuel concentrate, as
well as for the thermal expansion of the fuel. The
operating characteristics of these pumps, as well
as of the components, and the design of the pump
auxiliary systems for oil and dibutylcarbitol
distribution are being determined on a prototype
sodium pump. The fuel pump auxiliary system
design will be the same as that determined for the
sodium pump, since the requirements of the latter
will be the more severe.

Prototype Sodium Pump Test

The tests of the gas-sealed sump pump with
NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %) were reported
previously.® This pump is a profotype of those
being assembled for the ARE. The termination of
these tests was caused by bearing noises which
were determined to be the result of slippage of the
inner bearing race on the shaft. The bearing race
and the shaft were altered to give a 0.0002- to
0.0004-in. interference fit between them

operation of the pump with sodium was terminated
after more than 300 hr ot 1200°F, because a
gasket leak at the parting face of the pump casing
allowed sodium to jet against the top flange near
the primary gas seal. No further becring trouble
was experienced during the fests, and postrun
examination revealed no bearing or shaft wear.
It is therefore concluded that altering the inter-
ference fit between the bearing and the shaft did
successfully eliminate the slippage that occurred
in the previous tests.

Postrun examination showed that sodium vapor
had no deleterious effect on the silver-impregnated
graphite seal material. To confirm this, silver-
impregnated graphite was immersed in sodium af
300°F for 150 hr in a laboratory test, and again no
harmful effects could be observed. The test to
determine the reliability of the secondary gas seal
at high system pressure (50 psig) was not completed
because of the gasket leck which brought about
early termination of pump operation. This test is
now being made without sodium in the pump.

It was found that gas entrained during pump start-
up could be rejected in % min at a pumping rate of
35 gpm and in 4 min at a pumping rate of 125 gpm.
Since there is no apparent demand for higher
pumping rates during startup, the degassing charac-
teristic appears to be satisfactory.

Pump Auxiliaries

The auxiliary systems for the ARE pumps are
(1) a system for circulating light spindle oil as
shaft coolant and seal lubricant and (2) a system
for circulating dibutylcarbitol, which acts as a
heat barrier between the sump tank liquid and the
gas seal. With the prototype sodium pump operating
at 1500°F, heat loads of 11,000 Btu/hr in the
dibutylcarbitol from the seal-cavity cooling annulus
and 7,000 Btu/hr in the light spindle oil used as
shaft and bearing lubricant were found. This heat
was removed by water in external heat exchangers.

The tests conducted with the prototype pump to
determine heat loads of the shaft- and seal-cooling
circuits showed the need for redesign of these
circuits to eliminate the rotary union in the shaft-
cooling circuit at the upper ‘end of the pump shaft.
The cooling circuits have been modified, and the
cooling and lubricating oil now enters the bearing
housing between the upper bearing and the lubricant-
to-air face seal. Upon entry, the oil is divided;
some of it trickles over the bearings for lubrication

15
and heat removal and the other portion passes into
the hollow shaft for heat removal. All the oil
collects below the bottom bearing in a cavity out-
side the primary face seal. |t flows from the cavity
by gravity through nine Y-in.-dia connections at
the bottom of the bearing fusing to the lubricant
reservoir for cooling and recirculation.

Heat exchanger tests indicate that eight pumps
will be required for the pump lubrication (oil)
system, that is, one operating and one spare pump
for each of the sodium and fuel pumps. One pump
and its spare will suffice for the dibutylcarbitol
These
auxiliary lubrication and coolant pumps have been
checked and found to be satisfactory.

system for all sodium and fuel pumps.

Impeller Fabrication

All the Inconel impeller castings made by the
vendor have been rejected because of imperfections
such as sand inclusions, cold shots in the cast
metal, and porosity. Each of these imperfections
could result in pump failure because of structural
failure of the impeller vanes or because the re-
moval of sand inclusions and metal particles in
the cold shots would cause intolerable unbalance
of the impeller. As a consequence of these re-
impellers for ARE pumps are being
fabricated from Inconel plate stock. Impellers for
the sodium pumps (high flow) will have curved
vanes to provide heat and flow characteristics
similar to those of the cast impellers. Impellers
for the fuel pumps (low flow) will be drilled, and,
although somewhat less efficient than the curved-
vane impellers, they will be easier to fabricate.

jections,

Acceptance Tests

Test equipment has been designed and some of
it has been placed in operation for running ac-
ceptance tests on all ARE pumps. These tesis
will include (1) water tests to determine head,
flow, and efficiency of each pump, (2) short-time,
cold, run-in tests of seals at 65 psig, and (3) hot
tests at ARE temperature, flow, and pressure
conditions. The water test equipment is now in
operation, and an all-lnconel loop is being fabri-
cated for the hot tests. The hot test loop will
include an ARE-type gas conirol system and the
cooling and lubricating circuits described above.
One ARE pump has been assembled and checked
with cold water. The performance of the pump in
this preliminary test was acceptable.

FLUID CIRCUITS

G. D. Whitman
ANP Division

G. A. Cristy

Engineering and Maintenance Division

Except for the installation of the pumps, the
external fuel and sodium systems are essentially
completed. Installation of heaters and insulation
on these systems is about 65% complete. Additional
tests of the bellows-seal and the frangible-disk
valves have demonstrated the reliability ‘of each
under ARE operating conditions. A flow diagram
showing the major fluid circuits and design-point
operating conditions is presented in Fig. 1.5.

Fuel System

One fuel pump casing has been received and
installed in the fuel system; the other is expected
early in December, Only seven welds remain to be
made before the system, including the spare pump,
is completed; some operational tests may be
undertaken before installation of the spare pump.
The fuel fill-and-flush tanks have been thoroughly
cleaned by hot-water flushing and dried by prolonged
evacuation at slightly elevated

(around 200°C).

temperatures

Sodium System

The status of the sodium system is comparable
to that of the fuel system. Assembly of the sodium
piping is essentially complete, except for 17 welds
that are in the vicinity of either the pump casings
or of the reactor.

Valves

The valve tests reported previously indicated
that the valves to be used in the ARE would give
satisfactory performance if held at a temperature
of 1200°F or below. The only additional infor-
mation on bellows-seal valves involves operational
tests at 1100 to 1275°F after the valve had first
been held for some time at 1300°F in contact with
the fluoride Naf-ZrF ,-UF, {50-46-4 mole %). In
these latter tests, there was no leakage but some
sticking; the operation at 1300°F apparently softened
the sealing surfaces. The pressure required to
open the stuck valves increased rapidly and then
leveled off as the valve-closed time was increased;
at no time, however, did the pressure exceed 30
psig.

with molten fuel at a temperature of about 1300°F
for 160 hr and was opened immediately by the
actuator at the end of this period. The valve operation
was normal in every way. These tests on ARE-type
valves in fluoride mixtures have produced con-
fidence in the valves that are to be used in the
ARE, and no serious valve problems are anticipated
in the operation of the experiment. All frangible-
disk valves have been completely fabricated,
tested, and installed. All. the Fulton-Sylphon
valves were thoroughly flushed and tested with
helium for leak tightness across the valve seat.

Auxiliary Systems

The helium heat exchanger loops and the as-
sociated hydraulic systems have been completed
and tested in air. These tests have shown that the
systems have lower pressure drop than calculated,
which will result in lower operational speeds and
consequently greater factors of safety (or greater
heat transfer capacity).

The pit for the secondary off-gas system has
been completed, and cbout 75% of the piping for
the system has been installed. The planned
program for inspecting and testing of individual
systems is being put into operation as rapidly as
the installations are completed.

Corrosion tests have repeatedly demonstrated
the deleterious effects of surface contamination
of container metals and of impurities in the fluoride
mixture on the corrosive attack on the container.
Accordingly, both the sodium and the fuel systems
will be cleaned. The methods and procedures to
be followed in cleaning these systems have ‘been
established by a group consisting of representatives
from the ANP chemical, metallurgical, engineering,
and ARE groups. The complete, final report of
this committee has been issued, and a brief outline

will somewhat offect the details of the dissolution
procedure. A comparative study indicated that the
most satisfactory method would be transportation of
the solid fuel in partially filled open-top aluminum
cans. A measured amount of the molten fuel would
be poured into the cans and allowed to solidify,
and the cans would be transported one at a time to
the Metal Recovery Building where both can and
contents would be dissolved. The use of open-top
instead of sealed cans would simplify the remote-
filling operation and decrease the dissolution time.
None of the valuable material should be fost as a
result of fragmentation of the charge if there is
sufficient freeboard in the aluminum container.

To illustrate the feasibility of canning molten
fluorides in metallic aluminum, three 10-kg batches
of NaF-ZrF (-UF , (50-46-4 mole %) were transferred
to air-cooled aluminum containers. Each of the
cans, two with 0.065-in. walls and one with a
0.25-in. wall, withstood the test in which the
fluoride temperature was 600°C. It was discovered
that the thin-walled cans should not be subjected
to more than 5-in. vacuum or 5-psig pressure,

Previously, cans approximately 5 in. in diameter
for transporting 6.6 kg of fuel plus flush material,
which would contain 0.5 kg of U23% if the mixture
wieré homogeneous (or a maximum of 1 kg of U235
if the mixture were not homogeneous), were con-
sidered.'® This amount of fuel would dissolve
to give about 35 gal of solution,

The process appears to be most attractive if 4 kg
of uranium per container, which amounts to 53 kg
of fuel plus flush (assuming a homogeneous mix-
ture), can be transported and charged to the 500-gal
dissolver to make one 265-gal batch of solution.
For this size batch, the containers would be about
9 in. in diameter and 18 in. long. This quantity
would be more compatible with the size of the
Metal Recovery Building equipment, and the
number of containers required to transport the 80 to
100 kg of U235 would be reduced from 100 to about
25. Processing of 4 kg of U235 per batch in the
existing dissolver is subject to approval by the
Criticality Hazards Committee.

Another method of dissolving the fuel involves
introducing it to the dissolver in the molten state.
If this method were used, the fuel could be trans-
ported in a special can that would hold about 25 kg
of U?35, The advantages of this method are the

rapidity of the dissolution and the decrease in the
number of truck trips required for the transportation.
The disadvantages are the difficulty of providing
shielding ‘suitable for use in the handling of the
molten material and the excessive development work
required on equipment that would have to be built
into the cans, for example, heaters for remelting
the fuel if it solidified before the dissolution was
carried out, temperature-measuring instruments,
and devices for controlling flow. Construction of
the dissolver at the ARE site would eliminate the
need for constructing transportable shielding and
would permit the use of less rugged heaters, but it
would require too large a capital expenditure. It
would also split the locations of the chemical
operations, and additional operators would be
required.

Rate of Dissolution of ARE Fuel

Based on the results of laboratory dissolution
experiments, a dissolution time of 6 to 12 hr is
estimated for a 53-kg charge of ARE fuel. For
a 6.6-kg batch, a dissolution time of 3 to 6 hr is
estimated. A reliable value for the dissolution
time cannot be calculated from the data obtained
in these small-scale experiments, since the dis-
solution rate is not constant throughout the dis-
solving.

With a 1-in.-dia cylindrical charge weighing
approximately 50 g, an initial penetration rate of
0.003 in./min was observed over o 4-min period
(Table 1.2). Over the next 3 min, the penetration
rate increased to 0.006 in./min, based on the
initial dimensions. This increased rate is due to
uneven penetration and cracking, which exposes

After the 5-min period, the
sample had broken up into several smaller pieces.
Another fresh sample tested in a solution that
already contained a normal complement of dis.
solved fuel gave a penetration rate of 0,002 in./min;
however, in the final stage of an actual dissolution,
the charge would probably have broken up to expose
a very large surface area per unit weight. Based on
these results, the average penetration rate will
probably exceed 0,006 in./min.

The sample charges for these experiments were
prepared by pouring molten fue! (NaF-ZrF UF,
50-48-2 mole %) into a split graphite mold and
cooling. The pit formed by contraction on cooling
was removed by pressing the cylinder against a hot
metal plate. The sample was placed in the dis-
solvant (boiling 4 M nitric acid and 0.67 M aluminum
nitrate solution) and then removed and weighed

Since the scale-up of these laboratory data is
inconclusive, three charges will be poured into
aluminum cans, 6 in. in diameter and 9 in. long, and

dissolved to establish the dissolution time more
accurately.

Molten Fuel Dissolution

No excessive violence was observed in several
preliminary tests in which molten ARE fuel, at
temperatures of over 550°C, was poured into the
aqueous solvent (4 M nitric acid plus 0.67 M
aluminum nitrate). On contact with the aqueous
phase, the fuel solidified in the form of small
irregular particles 1 to 2 mm in diameter and then
dissolved at a rate of about 50 g in 10 min, which
is comparable with the rate of 50 g in 5 min that
had been observed with finely ground fuel. Ap-
parently the only precaution required is to make
sure that the addition is slow enough to prevent
excessive overheating and overboiling. However,
colloidal material has been present in all dissolver
solutions prepared todate from molten fuel, possibly
as a result of the instability or hydrolysis of
zirconium compounds in aqueous solutions at high
temperatures. Some modification of the dissolver
solution to prevent formation of this material would
probably be required if molten fuel dissolution
were to be used.

2. EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR ENGINEERING

H. W. Savage, ANP Division

The completion of the developmental work on the
gas-sealed sump pumps for the ARE has made
possible a change in emphasis of the experimental
work, and increased effort has been devoted to the
development of a hydradynamic type of bearing and
a heat exchanger for the reflector-mederated reactor,

The developmental work on the frozen-sodium-
sealed pump for sodium during this quarter included
tests of a frozen-sodium shaft seal with a single
Y-in.-long frozen-sodium sealing region backed up
with helium pressure in the sealing cavity, The
short seal is being developed in an effort to lower
the power consumption of the seal and yet maintain
the low leakage obtained with the 5% ¢-in.-long
seal previously described. In tests, the new short
seal dissipated approximately % hp, with no power
tHluctuations, and it was found that the sodium
feakage could be made negligible if back-up pres-

22

sure was used to reduce the pressure differential
across the seal, Water tests on the gas-sealed
sump pump for the in-pile loop showed fluid gassing
to be a problem, and, accordingly, changes are
being made in an effort to eliminate this condition,
in other tests, the problems associated with de-
veloping a conned magnetic-torque<transmiiter for a
high-temperature pump for aircraft application are
being explored,

Since the adoption of the gas-sealed sump pump
for ARE operation, seal developmental work has
been carried on at a reduced rote; however, tests
for rotary shaft and valve stem seals have con-
tinued with materials which showed promise in
eorlier tests, These include graphite packed around
a spiral-grooved shaft, graphite and BaF mixtures,
a V-ring type seal, and a bronze-wool, graphite,
and MoS, mixture, Although each of these seals
has performed well under laboratory controlled con-
ditions, none has demonstrated sufficient reliability
to warrant adoption in a pump for reactor operation,
Also, none of the packing materials tested thus far
for valve-stem seals has demonstrated sufficient
reliakility to replace the bellows as a valve-stem
seal,

A hydrodynamic type of bearing which will operate
in liquid metals, fused salts, or other fluids af
temperatures of up to 1500°F is being developed.
Materials for this application are being screened
in a compatibility testing device, and a test progrom
is being planned for obtaining the bearing charac-
teristics, which are usually represented as friction
factor vs. Sommerfeld number.

A heat exchanger incorporating some design
features proposed for the reflector-moderated re-
actor is currently being tested. The fluoride system
has operated at above 1200°F for over 600 hr, but
performance data are not yet available.

A small forced-convection loop is being operated
to test corrosion of Inconel in circulating fluoride
mixture NaF-ZrF ,-UF , at high fluid velocities and
high temperature differences. The fluid velocities
obtained in this loop are a factor of 50 or 60 greater
than those of thermal-convection loops, but the
Reynolds modulus remains in the laminar region
at approximately 1700.

Frozen-Sodium-Sealed Pump for Sodium

A frozen-sodiuvm shaft seal with a %-in.-long
frozen-sodium region backed up with helium pres-

differed from the previously tested! short seal in
that only one Y%-in.-long sealing region was used
and the blanket gas was under pressure, The short
seal is being developed in an effort to lower the
power consumption of the seal and yet maintain
the low leakage obtained with the 51% -in.-long
seal previously described.?

For the first 168 hr of operation with the new
short seal, the sodium temperature at the pump
was 960°F, the suction pressure was 20 psig, and
the back-up pressure was 15 psig. The total sedium
leakage past the seal during this period was 32
ecm3 or an average of 4.8 cm? per day, Approxi-
mately % hp was dissipated in the seal and the
power trace was smooth,

The Buna N rubber O ring used fo seal the back-
up gas was destroyed during the application of
heat to remove the sodium leakage at the end of
168 hr, and the remainder of the testing was ace
complished without the use of back-up pressure,
Operation was continued for a total of 980 hr with
a shaft speed of 1800 rpm, a sodium temperature
of 960°F, and a suction pressure of 12 psig. A
slight flow of helium was maintained across the
back of the seal, The increase in the pressure
differential across the seal from 5 psig during the
first part of the test to approximately 12 psig
during the remainder of the test resulted in an
increase in sodium leckage past the seal to ap-
proximately 20 cm? per day.

Erratic power fluctuations caused by sodium
oxide migrating to the cold section of the seal
became negligible when a standard, cold«trap,
bypass filter was installed in the loop. The filter
bypasses approximately 0.25 gpm of sodium, Ex-
cessive heat loss in the filter (approximately 3
kw) necessitated its redesign to incorporate ao heat
economizer designed to waste only 0.3 kw, Transit
time through the new filter is approximately 6
minutes, ‘

The results of these tests, together with the
previously reported results of tests with longer
frozen-sodium seals, have led to the conclusion
that a frozen-sodium shaft seal is manageable for
a sodium pump. A satisfactory length-to-diameter
ratio for such a seal is approximately 1 to 5.
Leakage of sodium past the seal can be made
negligible by using back-up pressure to reduce the
pressure differential across the seal. Water cooling
is an efficient means of freezing the seal, and
several thousand hours of operation have demon-
strated that the hazard in’ using water with o
properly designed seal is trivial,

Yio-hp torque was transmitted from room tempera-
ture to 600°F, but the efficiency then dropped off
rapidly at higher temperatures. It is yet to be
determined whether the drop in efficiency is due
to the drop of the flux of the permanent magnet or
to lowered resistance of the windings of the rotor.
A permanent magnet inner rotor is presently being
constructed which will resolve this question,

Graphite~Packed Seal for Spiral-Grooved Shaft

Operation of the spiral-grooved shaft with «a
powdered-graphitespacked seal? has continued for
over 3000 hr with no detectable leakage of fused
fluorides. During this period of operation, heater
failure occurred on twe occasions and coused the
shaft rotation to stop. When repairs were made,

operation was resumed with no difficulty,

Graphite-BeF, Packed Seal

The previously reported” test of a seal packed
with a mixture of 80% graphite powder and 20%
BeF, has now operated for over 3700 hours, The
leakage for the past 3500 hr was less than 15 in.3.
Power fluctuations have occurred, and some of
them were accompanied by squeaking, which
indicated possible metal-to-metal contact between
the shaft and the gland,

When this packing material was installed in a
tester having a 2} -in,-dia shaft, excessive graphite
and Bef, leakage occurred, Investigation dis-
closed that the temperature during pretreatment
was insufficient to fuse the BeF,, and thus the
seal contained loosely packed material rather than
the solidly fused material desired, For the second

and a heater was installed inside the 2Y-in, dia

satisfactory sealing of helium was at-

operation, and, since some damage to the seal
rings occurred, satisfactory sealing could no
longer be obtained, Examination of the rings after
disassembly of the seal showed that the outside
ring was 75% destroyed and the other rings had
either oxidized or worn about 0.0005 to 0.0015 in,
on the inside diameter; the shaft was undamaged.
The outside ring has been replaced and another
dry run will be made in an attempt to seal helium
at above 1000°F before fluorides are introduced.

Bronze-Wool, Graphite, and MoS, -Packed
Frozen Seal

The test? of the bronze-wool, graphite, and MoS,
packed frozen seal continued until operation was
terminated at the end of 1198 ht because of leakage
of the fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF ,.UF from a flange.
The leakage rate was less than 1 cm? per day with
the fluoride pot aot 1175°F and pressurized to 10
psi.

An additional test was made with the packing
annulus reduced from ¥ to % inch. This test was
unsuccessful and was terminated of the end of
211 hours. The failure was attributed to faulty
alignment between the shaft and the packing
housing.

Packed Seals for Valve Stems

A series of tests is in progress to determine
whether the packing materials which sealed well
in the packing penetration tests? will seal high-
temperature fused salts under simulated valve
operating conditions, None of the materials tested
has demonstrated sufficient reliability to replace
the bellows as a valve-stem seal.

The test apparatus consists of a standard valve
stem and bonnet placed in a vertical position with
the stem down, The pot in which the molten fluo-
ride mixture ‘is pressurized against the packing in
the bonnet is welded to the top of the bonnet. The
stem is rotated at frequent intervals to simulate
valve operation, Three tests have been completed
in which the valve stem was cycled once every 24
hr, and the pressure on the packing was 5 psi.
The packings tested were Asbury graphite 805 of
1100°F, 90% Asbury graphite 805 plus 10% BaF,
at 1100°F, and 50% graphite (from the Y-12 Carbon
Shop) plus 50% BeF, at 1350°F. Each of these

tests was terminated because of fluoride leakage.

HIGH-TEMPERATURE BEARING DEVELOPMENT

R. N.'Mason P. G. Smith

ANP Division

Developmental work is under way on a hydro-
dynamic type of bearing which will operate in
liquid metals, fused salts, or other fluids ot tem-
peratures of up to 1500°F. This developmental
program will probably be carried out in three phases:
(1) test programs to find materials which have low
wear and ‘low corrosion rates in the fluids of
interest at 1500°F, (2) a test program to establish
the bearing characteristics, which are usually
represented as friction factor vs. Sommerfeld
number, and (3) the design and test of a bearing for
a particular application using the information ob-
tained in phases 1 and 2. Effort to date has been
confined to materials compatibility tests and to an
evaluation of the accuracy which may be expected
in carrying out the program for obtaining bearing
characteristics,

Materials Compatibility Tests

Initicl screening tests for finding materials that
possess satisfactorily low wear and low corrosion
rates are being made in apparatus in which a
2%-in.-diq, Y-in.-thick plate specimen of one ma-
terial rotates against a %-in.-dia stationary pin of
another or the same material, The end surface of
the pin is ground to a Y%-in.-radius cylinder to
approximate line contact along a radial line of the
rotating plate at a mean radius of 1 in, from its
center (Fig. 2.1). Contact pressure between the
plate and pin is maintained by means of an external
coil spring and a sliding shaft,

A test was run of the equipment made with a
Graphitar plate and an Inconel pin. A Hertz stress
(estimated stress in the line of contact) of about
10,000 psi, or a 5-1b force load between the plate
and pin, was used. With the test specimens sub-
merged in acetylene tetrabromide to simulate the
fluoride melt, it was found that the 5-lb load was
insufficient for breaking thiough the hydrodynamic
film and that the film persisted until a lood of
about 10 1b was applied to give a Hertz stress of
about 15,000 psi. The rate of rotation was 850
rpm, which gave a sliding speed of about 7.4 fps.
Having determined the load requirement, a series
of correlation tests was conducted with plates of
type 416 stainless steel rotating against stationary

Combinations of materials which possess both

Bearing Characteristics

An evaluation has been made of the accuracy of
the data which will be obtained in the test program
for determining bearing characteristics. Two ex-
perimental approaches for obtaining the data have
been reviewed, First, the test may be simply a
load-life experimental study to establish reliability
of a single bearing design in fluoride melts,
Information gained from this approach might or
might not be useful in predicting the behavior of
other bearings; certainly, the information could be
used only with limited assurance, On the other

test in which an effort is made to establish pa-
rameters which will describe the bearing charac-
teristics in such a way that they may be employed
to determine design configurations other than the
one tested,

pg of ¢ can be measured to even this fractional

It is possible to measure ¢ with this degree of

to be much refined,

Equation 5 may be used to indicate the resulting

Thus it appears that the precision of the ex-

limited by the precision of the data available for
the viscosity of the fluoride and the ability to
accurately measure the radial clearance and fric-
tional force. If consideration is given to the fact
that the Ap/AT for the fluoride is quite large and
that the lubricant filin temperature is extremely
difficult to accurately measure, the precision of
the experimental results will be even lower. Be-
cause errors of this type are usually cumulative

temperature sodium circulating through the tube
bundles (Fig. 2.2). A sump-type pump continuously
circulates the fluoride mixture; the sodium flow
is maintained by an electromagnetic pump. The
sodium is resistance heated, and it enters the
tubes in one: half the exchanger to heat the fluo-
rides. lt is then cooled in a sodium-to-air radiator
{100 kw, interrupted-fin type) from which it enters
the tubes in the other half of the heat exchanger
to cool the fluorides and then returns to the sodium
heating coil. Thus both the fluoride mixture and
the sodium are alternately cooled and heated. The
heat exchanger is designed to transfer 1.5 mega-
watts, but performance to date has been limited
by an inability to supply sufficient power to the
resistance heater for the sodium. The fluoride
system has been in operation at above 1200°F for

over 600 hr, and the completed bifluid system has
been operating at 1200 to 1400°F for 300 hours.

Performance data are not yet available.
FORCED-CIRCULATION CORROSION LOOP

A small forced-circulation corrosion loop was

rosion dota being obtained from low-velocity thermal
convection loops. The aim is to eventually obtain
a fluid velocity of 5 fps or greater with a temper-
ature difference of 200°F, Circulation is obtained
with aon Eastern Industries, E-100, centrifugal
pump that was redesigned for sump-type operation
and fabricated of Inconel. A gas seal is main-

the shaft. The loop was fabricated of 0.1-in.-OD,
0.025-in.~wall Inconel tubing. Hecting is accom-
plished by passing an electric current through 17 ft
of the tubing, and cooling is by natural convection
to air from 9 ft of tubing, The tubing is coiled to
reduce the space requirement.

The fluid velocities obtained in this loop are
a factor of 50 or 60 greater than those of thermal
convection loops, but the Reynolds modulus re-
moins in the lominar region at approximately 1700.
The loop operated approximately 200 hr with a

gradual slowing down of flow, which indicated
possible plugging. A summary of the results is
presented graphically in Fig. 2.3, which shows
velocity and temperature difference as a function
of elapsed time. The speed of the pump, which
was checked periodically, did not vary appreciably.
The velocity of the fluoride mixture was calcu-
lated, rather than measured, from heat balance data
on the loop heating section. The loop was termi-
nated because of the indicated plugging ond is
being examined metallurgically. A second loop is
being constructed.

3. REFLECTOR-MODERATED REACTOR DESIGN STUDIES

R. W. Bussard

A. P. Fraas

ANP Division

In May 1953, the U, S. Air Force requested that
a series of design studies be prepared to outline
the characteristics of 100-, 300-, and 600-megawatt
circulating-fuel reactors, Unfortunately, the re-
actor physics work essential for establishing the
over-all design limitations has lagged far behind
schedule, and many materials questions are not
yet solved. However, even though detailed designs
cannot be prepared ot this time, it has been recog-
nized that design information is urgently needed,
and therefore the preliminary layouts presented in
this report were prepared fo give the best estimate
of preliminary designs that can be made now.
While interest was expressed in reactor power
outputs of as much as 600 megawatts, a careful
examination of the basic limiting factors indicated
that it would not be prudent to extrapolate the
information currently available beyond a reactor
size of 300 megawatts. The design for the 600-
megawatt reactor was therefore dropped, and studies
for 50- and 200-megawatt reactors, in addition to
the 100- and 300-megawatt reactor designs re-
quested, were prepared.

The more important parameters for the designs
are presented in Tables 3.1 and 3.2. Layouts for
50-, 100-, and 300-megawatt reactors are presented
in Figs. 3.1, 3.2, and 3.3, respectively. Detail
drawings for the main heat exchanger, pumps, and
core shelis have been prepared for the 50-megawatt
reactor. The designs for the 50- and 100-megawatt
reactors appear to be quite conservative so that it
seems probable that their ratings could be increased
to 75 and 150 megawatts, respectively, Parameters
such as flow rates and temperature drops would, of
course, increase accordingly.

An explanation and qualification of the more
important features of the principal components and
the considerations that determined them has been
prepared to supplement the drawings. The static
physics, moderator cooling, pumps, hydrodynamics,
heat exchangers, pressure shell, control, and fuel
addition and drainage systems are each discussed,
in turn, An effort has been made to include in
these discussions an indication of the status. of
the design at this time and of the experimental
work planned to provide badly needed design data.

A familiarity with information published previously
is presumed. 1+?

REACTOR PHYSICS

A wide variety of reactor types and geometries
has been considered for circulating fluoride fuels.
Of these, the most promising ot this time appears to
be a reflector-moderated reactor with a central
island. Sodium-cooled beryllium seems to be the
best choice as the moderating material. However,
the picture is very incomplete because calculations
for only about 25 reflector-moderated reactors had
been completed until recently because of lack of
computing facilities, Calculations for approxi-
mately 100 two-region reactors have just been
completed, and the results are being analyzed;
calculations for about 200 three- fo nine-region
reactors have been started.. By April 1954, this
work should be far enough clong to give a more
complete picture of the effects of reactor geometry
and materials of construction on parameters such
as critical mass ond power distribution for every
type of circulating-fuel reactor that has appeared
promising. A particular effort will be made to find
an arrangement that will give the most rugged,
reliable, and simple reactor construction consistent
with limitations imposed by corrosion and gommo-
heating effects.

Five critical assemblies have been run to date
on reflector-moderated reactors. All these have
been rather rough approximations fo what currently
appears to be a promising full-scale aircraft reactor.
The weakest element in all of these approximations
has been the fuel region composition. In the first
critical assembly, the fuel region was simulated
with cans’ of sodium interspersed with disks of
metallic uranium, while in the subsequent assem-
blies, cans of powdered NaF-ZrF ,-UO, were
employed. The first assembly suffered from severe
inhomogeneity and self-shielding of the fuel, and
the subsequent assemblies. had the shortcoming

that the atomic density in the fuel region was only
about 33% of that of liquid fluoride fuel. These
shortcomings will be largely eliminated in a new
critical experiment thot is being planned. Sheet
Teflon and 0.002-in.-thick uranium foil will be
stacked in laminae to simulate the fluoride fuel,
both from the standpoint of atomic density and of
neutron-scattering and absorption cross sections.

Another wedk point in the critical assemblies
that have been run has been that the geometric
approximation [eft much to be desired. It is planned
that the sheet Teflon and the uranium foil will be
cut to appropriate lengths to permit the construction
of a configuration essentially the some as that
envisioned for the full-scale reactor.

FUEL COMPOSITION AND PROPERTIES

lt was assumed in the design work that the
physical properties of the fluoride fuel at 1500°F
would be similar to those of Naf-KF.LiF-UF,
(10.9-43,5-44.5-1.1 mole %), which are, approxi-
mately, the following: heat capacity, 0.45 Btu/1b°F;
thermal conductivity, 2.6 Btu/hreft:°F; viscosity,
3 cp; density 2.0 g/cm®. Heat transfer considera
tions show that such a fuel would be much better
than the sodium-zirconium fuel that has been pre-
pared for the ARE, If such a fuel were not de-
veloped, it would be necessary to increase the
heat exchanger size given in the accompanying
designs by afactor of 2 or 3. This would mean an
increase in shield weight of about 6% and a serious
in heat exchanger header complexity.

There are two possibile ways of obtaining a
satisfactory fuel. The first is to use the above-
mentioned fluoride, or some modification of it, in a
container fabricated of an alloy that has no chro-
mium. This should eliminate the serious short-
coming of this particular fluoride mixture, that is,
its tendency to form low-conductivity films of a
highly insoluble potassium-chromium-fluoride mix-

ture on surfaces in Inconel systems. Initial tests
show Hastelloy B (80% Ni—20% Mo) to be a possi-
ble container material for this fluoride, and it will
be tested in the coming months.

A second way to obtain a fuel with satisfactory
physical properties is to test various melts that
have compositions that seem promising, ond such
o program is now under way. Melts of seven: dif-
ferent compositions containing lithium, sodium,
rubidium, and beryllium ore being prepared, and
their physical properties are being determined.
The best of these melts will be selected for cor-
rosion test work,

MODERATOR REGIONS

Heat transfer onalyses indicate that a sodium-
cooled beryllium moderator is superior from the
heat transfer standpoint to any other arrangement
considered thus far. Static and seesaw Inconel
capsule tests show virtually no signs of corrosion
or mass transfer at 1500°F for beryllium specimens
immersed in sodium. However, it is felt that mass
transfer in a larger-scale test loop operating with
a substantial temperature differential and with the
beryllium presenting the hottest surface in the
system {as in a full-scale reactor) is very likely
to be serious. A test loop to investigate: this
possibility has been designed, and it is scheduled
to operate about February 1954.
transfer prove to be serious, canned beryllium will
be tested.

It is expected that the results of the multigroup
reactor calculations will indicate what further
moderator designs should be prepared and analyzed
from the heat transfer standpoint to investigate
the possibilities of exploiting lead and bismuth
as moderator coclants, lead and bismuth are

interesting because of their high densities. Some
metallurgical work is currently under way in on
attempt to find a system that is satisfactory with
respect to corrosion and mass transfer,

Some structural problems exist in designing the
support of the reflector and the island. At first
glance, it would appear thgt these assemblies

hang from the flat decks that span the pump region.
This would not be the case when the fluoride
system had been filled, however, because the be-
ryllium density (1.84 g/cm?) would be somewhat
less than the expected fuel density (about 2.0
g/cm®) and hence the moderator region would tend

to float in the fuel. With the moderator region

buoyed up by the fuel in an almost ideal ‘‘shock
mounting,’’ accelerations that would occur under
crash landing conditions (in which vertical ac-
celerations of as much as 10 g should be antici-
pated) would yield a net upward force on the
reflector assembly that would be about equal to
its weight. In the designs illustrated, the re-
flector assemblies are attached to the lower deck
of the pump region by welds to the walls of the
sodium return passages.

The sodium pump und heat exchanger subas-
semblies are positioned around the top edge of
the upper pump deck. The pipe from the sodium
pump discharge makes a slip fit into the reflector
sodium inlet tube. The leakage through this slip
fit into the sodium return passage simply re-
circulates with no penalty other than a small

lower edge at the outer periphery and up and
across the top where they adjoin the plenum
chamber between the two fuel pumps.

The reactor designs illustrated in Figs. 3.1, 3.2,
and 3.3 presume that canning of the beryllium will
be required but that trace leaks in the Inconel-
to-can connections can be tolerated. Therefore
the tubes passing through the rifle-drilled holes
in the reflector are designed to be driven into
tapered bores in the fittings shown at the equator,
and the cuter ends of these same tubes are to be
rolled into their respective header sheets at the
top and bottom. The tube connecting fittings at
the equator also serve as dowels to locate the
two beryllium hemispheres relative to each other.

HYDRODYNAMICS OF THE FUEL CIRCUIT

Hydrodynamic considerations impose a number
of resiraints on the geometry of the fuel passages
in the reactor fuel circuit. These restraints are
not sharply defined, but they are sufficiently rigid
that they limit the fuel circuit proportions for a
well-balanced design to a considerably narrower
range than would at first be expected. The pres-
sure drop through the heat exchanger goes up very
rapidly with fuel flow rate ~ so much so that there
is little to be gained by going to fuel velocities
which correspond to pressure drops in the heat
exchanger of greater than 80 psi. This is particu-
larly true if an effort is made to keep the stresses
in the core shells and heat exchonger tube walls

38

to 500 psi or less. If the rest of the fuel system is
examined carefully, it is evident that it should
involve a pressure drop very much less than that
across the heat exchanger in a well-balanced
design. Thus, since a bleed-off-air turbine-pump-
drive arrangement seems to be at once the lightest,
simplest, and most flexible and since such o pump
drive system should be designed to require less
than 3% air bleed-off from the compressors, there
seems to be 0 strong incentive to limit the pressure
drop through the pump inlet and discharge passages
and the core inlet and outlet ducts to not more than
15 psi.

If it is assumed that the reactor core diameter is
determined by a compromise between shielding ond
other considerations and that the island diameter
will be determined by fission density distribution
considerations, it becomes evident that these two
basic dimensions for the fuel circuit may be token
as a base for determining the proportions for the
rest of the system. The inlet and outlet duct
passage arrangements should be as small as possi-
ble to simplify the shielding problem and to reduce
shield weight. However, it is of paramount im-
portance that boundary-layer thickening and flow
separation be avoided in the diffuser region at
the inlet to the core. This, in turn, imposes a
lower limit on the flow passage area that may be
used at the core inlet. An asymmetric design
might be employed in that this flow limitation
would not apply to the outlet duct, particularly
since a diffuser giving a reasonably high effi-
ciency can probably be provided between that duct
and the inlet to the heat exchanger. It is quite
evident from this standpoint alone that further
shielding tests should be made to investigate the
effect of fuel duct size on over-all shield weight.
While the problem is not clearly defined, it does
appear from flow test work, as well as from analy-
ses of the adverse pressure gradients along the
diffuser walls in the core inlet region, that the
outer diameter of the core inlet duct should be
roughly 60% of the core diameter, while the inner
diameter of that duct should be between 60 and
70% of the outer diameter,

The plenum chamber between the volute dis-
charges and the core inlet ducts should provide for
smooth transition and uniform velocity disiribution
at the inlet to the core. One promising way of
accomplishing this would be to provide a plenum
chamber having a height somewhat greater than the
thickness of the core inlet duct ond a diameter at
least half again as large as that of the inlet duct.
The pump volutes could then be designed to give
a fluid velocity entering the plenum chamber about
equal to that in the core inlet duct. This would
mean that for high power density reactors, for
example, a 200-megawatt reactor with an 18-in.~dia
core, the discharge annulus of a mixed flow impeller
should be made as wide as possible so that it
would approach the height of the plenum chamber.
For low power density reactors, for example, a
S0-megawatt reactor with an 18-in.-dia core, the
disparity in these dimensions is inherently large.
A careful examination of the magnitude of the
eddy losses to be expected of the pump inlet,
through the: impeller, in the pump volute, and in
the plenum chamber leads to the conclusion that
the pump should be designed for an inlet velocity
of not much more than about 30 fps, that is, a
velocity giving a dynamic head of about 12 psi.

On the basis of these considerations, it is
possible to specify dimensions for the principal
fuel flow passages for a wide range of reactor
power outputs. While the dimensions are given in
Table 3.2, it should be noted that there is some
latitude in the selection of these dimensions.
Furthermore, it is clear that passages of larger
size would require substantially heavier shields,
while passages of substantially smaller size
would be likely to give some sort of difficulty from
the hydrodynamic standpoint.

Some preliminary flow tests were carried out a
year ago,® and the results were encouraging.
Additional flow tests are being made to determine
whether the proportions indicated in Table 3.2 lead
to a satisfactory configuration for a reactor de-
signed for an output of 50 to 100 megawatts.

PUMP DESIGN

in examining the over-all system requirements,
it becomes evident that it would be very desirable
if the fuel pumps could perform several functions
in addition to that of pumping the fuel. It seems
likely that most of the xenon and possibly some of
the other fission-product poisons might be removed
from the fluoride mixture if helium could be bubbled
through the fuel while it was being thoroughly
agitated. Furthermore, it would be advantageous

to have the pumps serve as mixing chambers in
which high-uranium-content fuel could be added to
the main fuel stream to enrich the mixture and
compensate for burnup. Finally, it is essential
that on expansion tank be provided so that en-
trainment of bubbles would not prove to be a
problem in maneuvers or in “bumpy’" flight.

The pump arrangement shown in Fig. 3.4 was
worked out to provide for all the points mentioned
above. The pump design émbodies a variation of
an idea tested three years ago. The back of the
impeller is used to centrifuge out the gas bubbles.
The design also uses the overhung impeller, the
bearing arrangement, and the face-type gas seal of
the previous pump, along with several features that
have proved to be successful in sump pump test
work during the past year. The principles of opera-
tion are quite simple and have been demonstrated
with a plastic model. The fuel in the expansion
tank above the impeller tends to swirl in the same
direction as the impeller (but at a lower speed) so
that it forms a vortex with a roughly conical free
surface. A relatively large amount of fluid leaks
from the high-pressure region at the impeller outlet
through the labyrinth seal at the periphery of the
impeller into the swirl chamber immediately above
the impeller. Since this swirl chamber is connected
through a bypass line to the impeller inlet, the
leakage is simply recirculated at no cost other
than an increase in pumping power. Some fluid
leaks upward through the clearance between the
top lip of the swirl chamber and the outside of
the centrifuge cup on the back face of the impeller,
but this leakage rate is small because there is
little pressure differential across this gap. = The
leakage that does occur is made up by bleed flow
from small holes in the periphery of the centrifuge
cup on the back of the impeller. Thus there is a
small, continuous flow from the fluid vortex in
the expansion tank into the centrifuge cup and
thence into the swirl chamber. The fluid region
close to the surface of the vortex in the expansion
tank is highly turbulent ond full of bubbles so
that it should be effective in degassing the fuel.

In initial tests of a water pump with the above-
mentioned features, the pump continued to pump
when it was inverted for as much as a minute
before the liquid supply in the centrifuge cup and

swirl chamber was depleted by fluid leakage from
the swirl chamber inte the expansion tank, The
slinger ring on the impeller shaft at the top of the
expansion tank acts to throw the fluid away from
the shaft when the pump is inverted and thus pre-
vent flow into the clearance around the shaft
between the slinger ond the face-type gas seal.

A number of other special features have been
included in the pump design to adapt it to the full-
scale reactor shield. The pump has been designed
so that it can be removed or installed as a sub-
assembly with the impeller, shaft, seals, and
bearings in a single compact unit. As can be seen
from Figs. 3.1 and 3.4, this assembly fits into the
bore of a cylindrical casing welded to the top of
the reactor pressure shell, A 3-in. layer of uranium
just above a Yin. layer of B'® around the lower
part of the impeller shoft is at the same level as
the reactor gamma shield just outside the pressure
shell. The steel seal and bearing support above
the layer of uranium gives additional gomma shield-
ing, while the oil-filled cavity between the bearings
acts as neutron shielding. An air-driven turbine
and gear box could be mounted on the flange at
the upper end of the pump casing. Since the outer
surface of this casing was designed to be about
8 in. inside the outer surface of the shield, there
need be no protuberances from the shield surface
in the final installation. The long, slender,
“vill supply’ tube for fuel enrichment is suffi-
ciently small that it should not permit much gamma
{eak age.

The large ‘amount of impeller shaft overhang
inherent in the design of the pump could be avoided
if a journal bearing could be operated with the
molten fluoride mixture acting as the lubricant.
The pump impeller and volute could be designed
so that the radial load on such a bearing would
be very smell, perhaps not more thon 25 psi. Since
the viscosity of the fluoride mixture is greater than
that of water, the arrangement should be completely
satisfactory after the pump was started. Pickup
and scuffing of the bearing or shaft during startup
or shutdown might prove to be problems. A test
rig for investigating the compatibility of different
materials in sodium at high temperature has been
built and is being used to evaluate the compati-
bility of various material combinations in fluorides
(cf., sec. 2). Preliminary results are encouraging.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1953

PRESSURE SHELL

As much as Y%% of the reactor output may go into
gamma heating of the pressure shell. The provi-
sion for the removal of this heat presents several
design choices, none of which is entirely sotis-
factory. lf no provision is made for cooling the
pressure shell, it will be much hotter than the
fluoride mixture that contacts its inner surface.
Unfortunately, this would give the highest pressure
shell temperatures in precisely the zone in which
the stresses are the highest, that is, in the liga-
ments between the NaK ducts in the lower header
region. The pressure shell might be cooled with
the coolant system that serves the lead gamma
shield, but this would make tempercture control
difficult over a wide range of power outputs because
of the inherently large temperature differential.
Furthermore, it would make necessary the dumping
of large amounts of heat at a low temperature level
through the shield coolant radiator — a costly matter
in an airplane. Cooling of the pressure shell with
sodium from the island moderator cooling system
has the disadvantage of complicating the pressure
shell construction, but it has many advantages.
It provides a simple way of returning the sodium
that has passed through the island cocling passages
to the sodium-to-NaK heat exchanger. It not only
setves fo cool the pressure shell in the critically
stressed fuel discharge end of the reactor so that
the creep strength of the Inconel there becomes
more than adequate, but it makes it possible to
maintain the entire pressure shell at an essentially
vniform temperature. This should markedly reduce
both thermal distortien and clearance buildups
resulting from differential thermal expansion be-
tween the pressure shell, heat exchanger tube
bundles, and the reflector.

The construction envisioned is shown in Figs.
3.1, 3.2, ond 3.3. The inner liner assembly con-
sists of a Yein.-thick Inconel shell, a Yin. hot-
pressed B'® layer, and an inner 0.062-in.-thick
Inconel can. Inconel is also used to cover the
interior of the pressure shell between the two end
headers. Closely spaced grooves, % in. deep and
2 in. wide, milled into the outer surfuce of the
liner provide ample flow possage area for the
sodium to flow upward. Four transfer tubes carry
the sodium from the fop of the pressure shell to the
outer face of the pressure shell at the sodium-to-
NaK heat exchanger inlets. The hot-pressed

41
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

boron blocks are diamond-shaped, with 60-deg
ongles at their vertexes, and they have rabbeted
edges. This design permits the covering of a
spherical surface with a single block size and
shape.

The construction in the vicinity of the end header
regions was deliberately varied in Figs. 3.1, 3.2,
and 3.3 to show three different ways in which the
detail design may be handled. Another design would
involve the use of a pressure shell with forged
annular protuberances to receive the headers, while
yet another possibility would be a shell sufficiently
thick (about 2.5 in.) to permit machining annular
grooves for the hzaders. This latter arrangement
would have the advantage of a more regular ex-
terior surface on the pressure shell.

FUEL.TO-NaK HEAT EXCHANGER

The heat exchanger envisioned for the reflector-
moderated reactors is similar to that described
previously.® The major unknowns in the fuel-to-
NaK heat exchanger are concerned with fabrication.
It is presumed that the tube-to-header connections
would be heliarc welded by hand, as in the 210-tube
six-tube-bundle fluoride-to-NaK heat exchanger
presently being tested. It is expected that a large
amount of welding research and component testing
will be required to obtain a satisfactory solution
to this tube-to-header welding problem.

The tube bundles are separated by long cans that
are triangular in cross section and parallel the
tubes. The cans would be filled with hot-pressed
B'0 to assist in inhibiting the low-energy neutron
flux in the heat exchanger region.

REACTOR CONTRCQLS

One of the salient features of the circulating-fuel
reactor is its inkerent stability. It appears that
no fast-moving control rods will be required to cope
with fast transients, No large amounts of shim
control are required to compensate for burnup, be-
cause a uranium-rich fluoride can be added at
intervals during the course of operation. The only
important control needed is o means of varying the
mean operating temperature. In examining over-all
power plant considerations, it appeared that provi-
sion for effecting a temperature change of 200°F
should be included in the design (that is, about

3% Ak/E). It appears from critical experiments
that this could be provided by a % in.0CD tube
filled with B'0 and placed to give a *27-in. stroke
from the pump deck down through the center of the
island. While the rod and its actuating mechanism
are not shown in designs illustrated, a 0,50-in.-I1D
tube has been provided through the center of the
island to receive the rod. In the design contem-
plated, the rod would be machined from a thick-
walled tube to give three equally spaced % “in.
high ridges along its entire length, These ridges
would serve tc center the rod in the passage pro-
vided and thus give uniform flow of sodium coolant
around the rod periphery. The ridges would also
engage a grooved guide of the upper end to prevent
rotation. A short length of %-in.,-10 thread at the
top of the rod would be engaged by an internally
threaded tube enclosed in o casing extending up
through the shield. The tube would be rotated
by a drive at the top end through a bellows seal.
This seal would be brazed to the center of a
bar with three spherical bearings, one at each
end ond one in the center. This bar would be
inclined at an angle of about 15 deg to the axis
of the control rod drive tube. The center bearing
would be fixed relative to the rod casing, while a
crank attached to the upper end of the control rod
drive tube would be attached to the lower spherical
bearing. As the rod drive tube rotated, the axis of
the drive bar would generate a cone, with the
centers of the spherical bearings of its upper and

lower ends generating circles.

The fuel enrichment system that appears most
attractive is based on the use of cold-pressed disks
of Na UF, about % in. in diameter ond % in. high.
These disks could be fed to the tops of the fue!
addition tubes in the pumps by means of arelatively
simple “pill vending'’ machine. Several promising
detail designs of such machines have been pre-
pared from which it appears that this phase of the
development should not prove to be a serious
problem. However, it may be difficult to prevent
the fuel inthe expansion tank from entering, freezing,
and blocking the fuel enrichment tube during in-
advertent inverted flight, The pump design has
been worked out so that this should not happen,
but the effectiveness of this feature of the swirl
expansion tank design has not yet been checked.

SHIELDING

A substantial amount of fundamental work on the
shielding problems of the reflector-moderoted
reactor has been covered in other reports.2+78
Three important factors remain undetermined:
namely, the energy spectrum of the short half-lived
fission-product gammas, the effect of variations in
endduct and in fuel pump and header tank geometry,
andthe possibilities inthe use of unusual materiols
such as lithiumhydride. Tests have been carefully
planned to provide the essential design data neces-
sary for determining the first two of these factors
during the coming months, and a long-range program
is contemplated for investigating unusual materials.
it is hoped that a shielding experiment that is to
be carried out in conjunction with a critical experi-
ment will yield data that will validate the use of
multigroup, multiregion calculations as an aid ‘in
shield analysis.

Analyses of the effects of the neutron-to-gamma
dose ratio and of varying proportions of gamma
shielding on shield weight are being made. The
strength of lead and bismuth alloys at temperatures
of 250 to 350°F, shield design for jet fuels in
place of water, shield heat removal, and the dose
from the shield after shutdown are also subjects
currently being investigated.

FILLING AND DRAINING OF THE REACTOR

After 100 hr or more of full-power operation, the
fuel charge will require roughly 10 in. of lead
shielding to bring the radiation from it down to a
level of 1 r/hr at 5 feet. This will mean that a
tank to contain the roughly 4 #3 of fuel required
for a 50-megawatt reactor will require about 10 tons

of lead shielding. This could be mounted on a
heavily constructed dolly or on an elevator de-
signed to raise it up from a pit under the runway.
A cooling system to remove the afterheat from the
fuel will also be required. Preliminary estimates
indicate that the ofterheat can be removed most
readily by circulating a liquid metal through a
coiled tube in the fluoride drain tank and then
through a radiator to dump the heat to air forced
through the radiator by a blower, Such a system
should be reasonably light, compact, and mobile.

The filling and draining operation could be carried
out by carefully positioning the airplane over the
tank after removing a vertical plug, perhaps 5 in.
in diameter, from the bottom of the reactor shield.
The shielded tank assembly with a pipe extending
vertically upward from it could be raised so that
the pipe would project inte the hole in the shield.
A coupling at the upper end of the pipe would
engage a corresponding coupling at the bottom of
the reactor pressure shell. The space between the
drain valve at the bottom of the reactor and the
valve at the top of the pipe from the drain tank
could then be evacuated, the drain tank valve and
thereactor drain valve opened, and the fuel drained.
A blast of helium directed through appropriate
fittings could be used to blow out the fuel droplets
between the valves. The valves could then be
closed, the tank disconnected, lowered, and dropped
into its pit or removed to a suitable location. : The
reverse procedure could be followed in the filling
operation. Helium pressure on the liquid in the
shielded tank would serve to force the fuel up
into the reactor.

The biggest problem in the design of a system
of this sort is the detail design of the valves and
the remotely operated coupling to get the high
degree of leak tightness and exceptional refi-
ability required. Several rough preliminary layouts
have been sketched and work is proceeding in an
effort to develop valves and couplings that could
be used for routine filling and draining operations
in current ORNL experimental laboratory work.

The air-cycle reactor (AC-1) mockup was an
approximated cylinder 27 in. in length, 30 in. in
diameter, surrounded by a 7 Yy-ft-thick beryllium
reflector. The fuel elements and the uranium dis-

tribution were simulated by properly spaced uranium
disks sandwiched between mild steel which repre-
sented the structural materials of the reactor.
Each fuel element was surrounded by a l-in.-thick
layer of Plexiglas to simulate the water moderator.
The originally designed assembly was an octagonal
array of 37 fuel channels. This system, however,
could not be made critical with the 7.5-in.-thick
beryllium reflector until the number of fuel channels
had been increased to 43 ond five channels had
been loaded with twice the uranium prescribed.
The critical loading was then 29.8 kg of U235 with
98.9 kg of steel. Flux and power distributions
have been determined throughout the core and re-
flector. The data will be reported in detail in a
topical report to be issued by ORNL when the
experiment is complete and are discussed in
General Electric's Engineering Progress Reports.
 
 
INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

The research on high-temperature liquids for
reactors has been primarily concerned with the
determination of phase diagrams of fluoride and
chloride systems with and without fissionable
material, although a substantial effort has been
devoted to the production and purification of
halides and hydroxides (sec. 5). Detailed study
of the NaF-ZrF -UF system’ has continued be-
cause of its intended application in the Aircraft
Reactor Experiment, wherein Na, UF will be added
to NaZrF to produce a suitable fuel. Techniques
such as quenching, petrographic and x-ray analysis,
differential thermal analysis, and high-temperature
filtration, as well as the customary thermal
analyses, have been applied to the binary and
ternary systems NaF-ZrF and NaF-ZrF -UF .
Spectrophotometric measurements of fused salts
containing UF | show only two absorption-spectrum
patterns in the NaF-ZrF -UF, system. Some
physical property data substantiate the concept
that the fused salts are essentially totally ionized.
A number of fluoride samples were purified in the
laboratory for various tests while the facilities for
the routine production of these fluoride mixtures
are being constructed. In an examination of various
phases of fluoride purification techniques, it was
found that thereductionrate of Na, UF by hydrogen
increases with temperature. The reducing power
of NaH when added to NaZrF, is being studied,
as well as the kinetics of the H, reduction of
Nit* in NaZrF . Chemical studies of hydroxides
were limited. to the purification of NaOH ond
Sr(OH), and the determination of the carbonaceous
content of NaOH at 700°C.

The recent corrosion studies have been devoted
almost entirely to the effects of various parameters
on the corrosion of Inconel by fluorides, although
some work with hydroxides and liquid metals was
continued (sec. 6). Studies of the corrosion of
Inconel by the fluoride fuel NaF-ZrF ,-UF {50-46+4
mole %) have substantiated earlier conclusions
that the total attack in 500 hr is independent of
temperature from 1500 to 1650°F and that the
attack rate is time dependent. The value of having
purified fluoride melts in clean container systems
has been investigated not only with regard to the
metallic fluoride impurities in the melt, the concen-
tration of which may be directly correlated with
corrosive attack, but also with regard to contami-

nation of the container surface, which has a less
deleterious effect. Pretreatments of the fuel with
chromium and Inconel, as well as the precirculation
of fuel, have =ach been effective in reducing
attack, and an observed correlation between depth
of attack and surface-to-volume ratio of the Inconel
ond fluoride also indicates that the impurities in
the fluorides are the major factor in corrosion.
The attack by fluorides on Inconel at 1500°F
apparently increases in intensity, although not in
maximum depth, as the UF, content of the meltis
increased from 0 to 6.5 mole %. Static tests of
various combinations of metals in fluorides of
1500°F have shown that one of the metals is
attacked to a greater extent than the other, even
though the heavily attacked metal may be relatively
unattacked when alone in the fluoride. The fluoride
fuel NaF-ZrF ,-UF (50-46-4 mole %) has also been
circulated in nickel and type 430 stainless steel
loops for 500 hr at 1500°F; no plugging occurred,
but some mass transfer was observed in the stain-
less steel loop. A number of metal specimens were
tested in circulating lead in quartz thermal! con-
vection loops. Of the metals tested, oxidized

liquid metal studies included tests of

stainless steels, and potential bearing
materials in lithium, sodium, and lead. The more

fundamental corrosion studies included the
determination of the equilibrium pressure of
hydrogen in hydroxide metal systems and an

attempt to determine the chemical equilibria for the
postulated fluoride corrosion which results in
the selective leaching of chromium from Inconel.

The fabrication of high-performance radiators
and high-conductivity radiator fins represents the
major undertaking of the metallurgical research
program, which also included stress-rupture tests
of Inconel, the forming of special alloys, the
fabrication of solid fuel elements, and the develop-
meni of ceramic materials (sec. 7). Although
inconel-clad copper fins are inadequate because
of diffusion of nickel into the copper, acopper-
aluminum bronze fin and types 310 or 346 stainless
steel clod copper fins have been fabricated and
satisfactorily brazed to Inconel or stainless steel
tubing with a number of special brazing alloys.

deleterious.  Stress-rupture data are also being
obtained for Inconel tubes and for fine- and coarse-
grained Inconel sheet. The limited effort on solid
fuel elements has been confined to the drawing of
tubular fuel elements and the plug welding of
stainless steel-clad fuel plates, both of which
were effected with some success. Inconel tubing
for experimental equipment is being drawn satis-
factorily with reductions as high as 36%. The
rolling of various metals and alloys was effected:
columbium sheet after an 87.5% reduction at 1100°F
showed complete recrystallization.

The physical properties of several fluorides and
metal alloys have been measured at temperatures of
up to 1000°C, and the heat transfer characteristics
of reactor coolants are being studied in various
systems (sec. 8). The viscosity and density of the
ARE fuel concentrate, Na UF , and the vapor
pressure of the fuel solvent, NaZrF_, have been
measured. All these values are in line with those
anticipated for these materials. Other heat
capacity, thermal conductivity, density, and vapor
pressure data for fluoride compositions of interest
have been obtained. Measurements of the velocity
in a thermal convection loop indicate that the radial
gradients cause turbulence in the
liquid flow af Reynolds numbers above 100; the
laminar tlow solutions for flow in this regime are
thus in serious error. Forced-convection heat
transfer data with the MNaF-KF-LiF eutectic in
nicke! and in Inconel tubes have been confirmed;

temperature

the heat transfer in Inconel is less than that in
nickel because of film formation. Preliminary data
are available on a forced-flow heat transfer experi.
ment in the laminar flow regime, and apparatus is

48

being prepared for measurements of fluid flow in an
annulus and for studies of surface-boiling phenomena.

The radiation damage program included studies
of the stability of fluoride mixtures in Inconel and
determinations of the creep of metals under irradi-
ation, as well as the construction of the in-pile
circulating loop (sec. 9). Although Inconel capsules
containing fluorides show more tendency toward
intergranular corrosion under irradiation than they
do in out-of-pile control tests, there is no definite
trend in corrosion behavior that can be correlated
with either irradiation time (from 53 to 810 hr) or
irradiation level (from 230 to 8000 watts/cm3).
There were no in-pile creep tests made in the LITR
or in the MTR during this quarter, because more
reliable apparatus for creep measurements in both
these irradiation facilities was being developed
and constructed. The in-pile circulating loop,
types of which will be used for forced-convection
corrosion tests in the LITR ond in the MTR, is
being fabricated and assembled.

The analytical studies of reactor materials in-
cluded chemical, spectrometric, and petrographic
anclyses of fuel composition and corrosion products
(sec. 10). The chemical analyses were primarily
concerned with the oxidation states of the con-
stituents and the metallic corrosion products in the
fluoride mixtures. Techniques were

ferences in the two species. A technique has been
developed by which the mass spectrometer may
provide a measurement of the uranium burnup (due
to irradiation), as well as a quantitative analysis
of the uranium in the fuel.

5. CHEMISTRY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIQUIDS

W. R. Grimes
Materials Chemistry Division

Exploratory investigations of phase equilibria in
fused salt systems by the simple thermal ondlysis
technique have been extended to a number of
chloride systems containing UCI, end UCI; as the
fissionable components, as well as to examination
of several fluoride systems with ond without
uranium that are of possible interest as fuels,
fuel solvents, or coolants. In addition, the thermal
analysis technique has been applied to a number of
previously studied systems in attempts fo verify
some doubtful values in various regions or to
amplify data for regions in which previous experi-
mentation was limited.

During the past several months, other techniques
useful for more refined studies of systems pre-
viously shown to be valuable have been developed
and perfected. These techniques,
quenching, with petrographic and x-ray examination
of the solids, differential thermal analysis, and
filtration, applied,
in general, to the binary and ternary systems
NaF-ZrF, ond NaF-ZrF -UF,. While it is not
yet possible to interpret even the binary system
uniquely, it appears thot combining the data ob-
tained by these techniques and the thermal analysis
data will permit rapid progress to be made.

Spectrophotometric measurements of the absorp-
tion spectra of UF, and UF, in fused salts were
made. Only two absorption spectrum patterns were
found for glasses from the NaF-ZrF -UF , system.
Glasses were obtained with compositions of
between 16.65 and 50 mole % UF, in the ZrF -UF,
binary system.

Additiond . electrolyses of various solutions of
metal chlorides in potassium chloride were made.
Erratic results obtained with chromium anodes
have been ascribed tentatively to oxidation of the
chromium, When a thin plate of nickel was used
to protect zirconium electrodes from oxidation,
reproducible emf’s were observed.

Measurements of the density and electrical
conductivity of the fused salt system LiCI-KCl are
indicative of considerable order
persisting in these high-temperature fluids; these
and other measurements substantiate the concept
that fused solts are essentially totally ionized.

shorf-range

Facilities for the production of a variety of
fluoride compositions are being prepared and
laboratory-scale production is to be discontinued,
except for the preparation of small enriched-
uranium-bearing specimens for radiation stability
tests. A number of small fluoride samples were
purified for phase equilibria studies, plans were
made for producing the enriched material for the
in-pile loop experiments, and various simple
structural metal fluorides were prepared for corro-
sion studies.

In a study of the reduction of Na,UF by hydrogen
it was found that the rate of reduction increased
as a function of temperature. A further check on
the possibility of retcining reducing species in
NaZrF, melts was attempted by treating NaZrF,
with NaH, and the kinetics of the reduction of
Nit* in NaZrF, by H, at 800°C was studied be-
couse of the importance of this reduction in fluoride
purification procedures. Studies of the reaction of
sodium hydroxide with carbonaceous matter suggest
that it would not be possible to maintain sodium
hydroxide free from carbonate at high temperatures
in metals which contain oppreciable quontities of
carbon,

THERMAL ANALYSIS OF FLUORIDE SYSTEMS

C. J. Borton L.. M. Bratcher
J. Truitt
Materials Chemistry Division

Additional data that are believed to be more
reliable than some obtained ewly in the phase
study program were obtained on a number of binary
and ternary fluoride systems. Revised diagrams
will be published in topical reports when the
studies are completed. Although some data for
compositions in the NaF-ZrF -UF, system were
obtained by the thermal analysis technique, it is
expected that the major emphasis will be placed
upon other techniques for study of this system.

MaF-ZrF UF,

The probable existence of a ternary eutectic
NaF-ZiF -UF (63.5-19.0-17.5 mole %} with «a
melting point of 600°C was mentioned in the pre-
vious report. Closer study of this region has

49
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

shown that this composition is probably near the
bottom of a very narrow valley extending down
toward the Na,ZrF -NaZrF ¢ eutectic. Additional
data between the 40 to 50 mole % NaF lines at
several uranium concentration levels essentially
confirmed the location of the isotherms in this
region that are shown in the published diagram for
the system.! Data for the 75% NaF mixtures are
shown in Fig. 5.1. These data indicate solid
solution formation between Na,ZrF, and Na, UF,
over a wide range of compositions, and they have
been confirmed by other methods (cf,, subsection
on ‘Filtration Analysis of the NaF-ZrF UF,
System’’). Thermal data obtained from sealed
capsules of ternary mixtures containing more than
75% NaF have, in general, indicated melting points
that were lower than had been anticipated for this
region and lower than had been indicated by the
few runs made previously. Further study of this
system by other metheds is planned.

during this quarter confirmed the existence of two
low-melting-point regions in the ternary system,
one close to the RbF-LiF binary eutectic and the

cation. Twocrystalline phases have been observed,
and one of them is believed to be Na, ThF , the
identity of the other is still uncertain, Further
study will be required before a satisfactory equi-
librium diagram for the system can be prepared.

LiF-RbF-BeF,

Thermal data were obtained in the system LiF-
RbF-BeF , for 50 compositions with up to a BeF,
concentration of 60 mole %. The lowest melting
point observed with these mixtures was 345°C for
material containing {in mole %) 37% LiF, 8% RbF,
and 55% BeF,. The composition of this material
is close to that of the LiF-BeF, binary eutectic
reported to melt at 356°C.% It appears unlikely
that compositions with melting points substantially
lower than 350°C exist in this system, except
possibly in the high Bef, region which is not
amenable to thermal analysis; materials with such
high BeF, concentration would probably be of
little interest in the reactor program because of
their probable high viscosity. These results are
similar to those reported previously for the KF.LiF-
Be, system. ?

RbF-BeF »~LrF

The system RbF-BeF ,.ZrF, was investigated
with ZrF , concentrations of up to 50 mole % and
with Bef, concentrations of up fo 60 mole %.
Halts in the cooling curves at temperatures near
300°C were observed for several compositions in
this system. It is likely that the lowest thermal
effects observed can be attributed to a solid-phase
transition, since the RbF-BeF, and RbF-ZrF,
binary systems showed thermal effects in the 300
to 350°C temperature range which were almost
certainly due to such transition. No liquidus
temperatures significantly lower than 380°C (the
minimum melting point in the RbF-BeF, system)
were observed with the compositions tested.

by the Y-12 Chemical Division by hydrogenation of
UCl,. The melting point (840°C) obtained for this
material agrees well with the melting point of
842 + 5°C reported by Kraus.> Uranium and
chloride analyses of the as-received material
checked with the theoretical values very closely;
however, slight hydrolysis of the material occurs
on heating, even when considerable precaution is
taken to avoid exposure,

LiCl-uCl,

Thermal data obtained with a number of composi-
tions in the system LiCI-UCl, are shown in Fig.
5.2. The only eutectic in the system contains
approximately 25 mole % UCI, and melts at
495 + 5°C, This is apparently the lowest melting
alkali chloride~UCI, binary eutectic. The thermal
data gave no indication of compound formation in
this system, but, since the solid phases have not
yet been studied, the absence of incongruently
melting compounds is not completely demonstrated.

NaCl-UCI,

An equilibrium diagram for the system NaCl-UCI,
was reported by Kraus,® who stated that there were
no compounds formed by these components. Thermal
data obtained with nine mixtures containing 33 to
85 mole % UCI, are in reasonable agreement with
Kraus’ dota. However, the absence of the eutectic
break in the cooling curves for the mixtures con-
taining 65 mole % UCI; or more seems to indicate
the possibility of compound formation in the high
UCI, region. A thermal effect at 415 + 5°C through-
out the region studied here, which was not reported
by Kraus, could be due to a solid transition of a
compound in the system,

KCl-UCl,

Kraus also published an equilibrium diagram for
the system KCI-UCt,.® Thermal analysis of the
system in this laboratory with mixtures containing
12 to 65 mole % UCI, has essentially verified
Krous' data. The maximum difference in liquidus
temperatures in the two studies was about 15°C.

RLCI-UCI

Preliminary data indicate that there are two
eutectics in the system RbCI-UCI;, one at about
15 mole % UCI; that melts at 605 + 5°C and
another lying between 40 and 50 mole % UCI; that
melts at 515 + 5°C, The compound Rb,UCI, melts
congruently at about 730°C, while Rb, UCI appears
to melt incongruently at approximately 565°C,

CsCi-uCli,

Only a few thermal measurements have been made
on the system CsCI-UCl,, but there is indication
that there are probably only two eutectics in this
system. One eutectic has a high CsCl content
and melts at 580°C, ond the other contains approxi-
mately 47 mole % UCI; and melts at about 540°C.

KCi-LiCl-UCl,

The few studies that have been made on the
system KCI-LiCl-UCl, indicate that the addition
of about 4 mole % UCI; to the KCI-LiCl eutectic

, lowers the melting point from 355 to 345°C, but

52

further additions of UCI; result in a sharp increase
in melting point that is probably due to formation
of the high-melting-point K,UCl; complex. Study
of this system will be resumed at a later date.

RbCI-UCI,

Preliminary data for the system RbCI-UCI, indi-
cate that Rb,UCI, melts congruently at about
630°C and thot the eutectic in the 40 to 50 mole %
region melts at approximately 340°C.

Preliminary data for the system CsCl-UCI, were
presented in the previous report.® A tentative
equilibrium diagram for this system, based on the
available thermal data, is shown in Fig, 5.3. The

NaCL-LiCl-uCH,

The very complete investigation of the system
NaCl-LiCl-UCI , made during this quarter failed to
show a ternary eutectic with a melting point
significantly lower than that of the lowest melting
NaCl-UCl binary eutectic (375°C). Since this
investigation covered the region where low melting
compositions are believed most likely to occur, no
further work with this system is contemplated aot
the present. It is interesting to note that when
small amounts of UCI, (210 10 mole %) were added
to the NaCl-LiCl binary eutectic, the resulting
ternary mixtures had lower melting points than
those of the binary mixtures. The smallest addi-
tion of UCI, (1 mole %) to the KCI-LiCl eutectic
resulted in a higher melting point. This difference
in behavior probably can be attributed to the higher
melting point of the K, UCI, complex as compared
with that of the Na,UCI complex.

heating

The technique of

to the temperature of interest to grow
crystalline phases in the glass gives promise of
solving some of the more difficult problems in the
NaF-ZrF, system. Only preliminary results with
this technique have been obtained.

It is opporent that very accurate temperature
control is necessary to establish phase relation-
ships in the 40 to 60 mole % ZrF, region of the
NaF-ZeF, binary system in which most of the
quenching work has been done. The improved
equipment in use at present controls and measures
temperatures to £0.5°C. The two furnaces now
in operation make possible the quenching of about
40 samples a day.

Qil has proved to be as effective a quenching
medium as mercury and it is much more convenient
becouse it eliminates the necessity of having to
attach it to the capsules. The formation of crystals
during quenching has been kept to a minimum
through the use of small samples (about 3 mg) and
by severe pressing of the portion of the capsule
that contains the sample to decrease the sample
thickness. However, quench growth is still some-
times troublesome in the NaF-ZrF, system. An-
other problem that is not yet completely solved is
the presence in most quench samples of small
amounts of an unidentified phase believed to be a
complex sodium zirconium oxyfluoride. However,
the practice of hydrofluorination of small samples
(cf., subsection on ‘“‘Production of Purified Fluo-
rides'’) and the handling of the finely ground
samples in vacuum dry boxes have been of value
in keeping these phases at a minimum.

Quenching of specimens containing 33 to 46
mole % ZrF, reveals a cubic crystalline phase.
Because the phase is isotropic, petrographic

identification is difficult; x-ray diffraction tech-
niques will be required to establish the liquidus
temperatures, The cubic material is believed to be
a form of Na, ZrF ,, but the possibility that it is
Nay Zr,F, | has not yet been eliminated.

Material containing 46 mole % Zri , shows NoZrf,
as the primary phase. The liquidus temperature is
512 to 515°C, and the solidus temperature is 510°C,
Devitrification at 506°C of glass of this composi-
tion gave NaZrF and a small amount of the cubic
material.

Material containing 48 mole % ZrF, shows as
its primary phase on easily crystallized species
believed to be a high-temperature form of Na Zr Fo
(designated R3).

In the mixture containing 50 mole % Zrf, the
primary phase is R3; the liquidus temperature is
near 518°C; and the solidus temperature is slightly
above 510°C. Slow cooling of mixtures with this
composition invariably gives a phase referred to
as NaZrF, and Nag Zr Fg. However, devitrifi-
cation of the glass of 506°C provided only crystal-
line NaZrF with some glass residue. It now
appears that solid solutions of Na,ZrF, in NaZrF
exist which show optical properties that differ
only slightly from those of NaZrF.. The devitrifi-
cation experiments seem to indicate that NaZrf,
is the stable solid phase at this concentration.

Material containing 53.8 mole % ZrF shows R3
as the primary phase; the liquidus temperature has
not been established, but it is above 517°C; the
solidus temperature is about 511°C, Both Na, Zr Fg
and NaZrF ; are present below the solidus tempera-
ture.

Mixtures containing 57.2 mole % ZrF _ correspond
to the formula Na Zr Fo. A glass devitrification
experiment produced an almost pure crystalline
phase with this composition. Although this single
experiment apparently confirms the formula, further
experimentation at this ond neighboring composi-
tions will be required to establish beyond doubt
the composition of the compound.

DIFFERENTIAL THERMOANALYSIS OF
THE MaF.-Z:F SYSTEM

R. A, Bolomey

Materials Chemistry Division

The equipment used for differential therme-
analysis was modified during this quarter by re-

placing the capsules that had thermocouples
welded to the side with small capsules that have
center thermocouple wells, With the new capsules,
much better agreement is obtained between heating
and cooling: curves, and, for most samples, the
break for the liquidus transition is sharper and
better defined. Heating and cooling rates of 1°C
per minute can now be employed satisfactorily for
most samples, Data have been obtained with these
capsules for mixtures in the system NaF-ZrF,
thot were hydrofluorinated before use. A break at
about 512°C for samples containing 57 to 60 mole %
ZrF, suggests thot the composition of the phase
which precipitates from 50 mole % material is
probably above 57 mole %. It is possible, however,
that the existence of the 512°C break in thisregion
is due to o solid transition; this point will be
established by combining the data obtained from
differential analysis with that obtained by using
quenching techniques. Data are being collected in
the 40 to 50 mole % ZrF, range, and, when ex-
tended to higher ZrF concentrations, a complete
phase diagram will be presented.

ing phase equilibria mentioned in the previous
report’ was applied mainly to NaF-ZrF ,-UF ,
compositions during this quarter. Two attempts to
filter UF -ZrF, mixtures were unsuccessful be-
cause the high vapor pressure of ZrF, resulted in
separation by sublimation rather than liquid-solid
separation. in the NaF-ZrF -UF system, the
filtration method provided useful information
about an important fuel composition in addition fo
data for fundamental studies of phase relation-
ships in this system.

Mixtures with 53 mole % NaF

The melting point of a mixture containing (in
mole %) 53.5% NaF, 40.0% ZF, and 6.5% UF,
has been reported as 545°C. However, in a
previous filtration at 560°C of a 7 mole % UF,
mixture, analysis of the residue and of the filtrate
indicated some segregation of a high-uranium-
content material. This experiment has been re-

peated carefully with a mixture containing {in mole

%) 53.0% NaF, 40.0% ZrF,, and 7.0% UF,, which
was filtered at 604, 575, and 560°C. At the two
higher temperatures, there was no detectable dif-
ference between the filtrate and the residue, when
examined either petrographically or by x-ray dif-
fraction. At 560°C, more than 99% of the charge
material passed through the filter, but examination
of the residue indicated that it was a higher ura-
nium solid solution than the filtrate. There was
not enough residue obtained in this experiment for
a chemical analysis, ond therefore the significance
of the apparent phase separation is not clear. In
one filtration carried out at 525°C with the same
composition, 63 wt % of the material filtered. Both
filtrate and residue were found to be solid solu-
tions of the type Na(U)ZrF , with the residue hav-
ing the higher uranium content. It is considered
significant that no trace of free UF, was detected
in the solid phases.

Mixtures with 50 mole % NaF

Thermal data for NaF-ZrF ,-UF mixtures ' © con-
taining 50 mole % NaF seemed to indicate that
NaUF ; and NaZrF, form solid solutions. Petro
graphic and x-ray diffraction studies have shown
that solid solutions do occur in this system but
that UF, is probably the primary phase that sepa-
rates from the mixture containing 50% NaF, 25%
UF,, and 25% ZrF ,. Filtration experiments with
50% NaF mixtures containing 10, 12.5, 25, 31, and
37.5 mole % UF, showed that UF, separated in
significant amounts from the 12.5, 25, and 31%
UF, compositions, with the maximum separation
occurring at 25%. Trace amounts of UF, were found
in several of the other solid phases. Because of
the UF, separation, chemical analysis of the
filtrate and residue did not give a reliable indica-
tion of the liquidus and solidus temperatures for
most of the 50% NaF join.

Mixtures with 75 mole % NaF

The thermal data for the 75% NaF compositions
in the NaF-ZrF -UF ; system showed evidence of
more or less complete solid solution formation
between Na UF, ond NayZrF,. Since NojUF,
melts incongruently, it was expected that the solid
solutions would break down near the uranium end

of the series. However, preliminary data indicate

Filtrations with mixtures containing 8Y%, 12%,

75 mole % Na UF.) gave evidence of complete
solid solution formation within this range. The

Petrographic examination,

An unidentified yellow-brown phase, which ap-
to be characteristic of NaF-ZrF UF,
mixtures containing more than 75 mole % NaF, was
reported to be present in both the filtrate and the
residue from the filtration of the 8% and 12, mole
% UF , mixtures. Since this phase did not appear
in hydrofluorinated mixtures, it seems probable

pears

that it is an oxygen-containing complex.

The data shown in Table 5.1 indicate that, within
the range of compositions and temperatures covered
in these experiments, the system NaF-ZrF UF,
is a frue binary system, since the phase separation
resulted in mixtures of very nearly the same NaF
content as the starting material. The liquidus
temperatures determined by the filtration method
agreed well with the thermal data shown in Fig.
5.1 (cf., subsection on ‘Thermo! Analysis of
Fluoride Systems’’). Since cooling curves for
these compositions failed to indicate sclidus
temperatures, the data in Table 5.1 give the first
indication of the temperature
liquidus and solidus lines for this system. Further
filtrations with compositions approaching that of

spread between

in an attempt to determine whether limits of solid
solution exist in this system,

Spectrophotometry of Supercooled Fused Salts

Materials Chemistry Division

Measurements of the absorption specira for UF
and UF in quenched fluoride melts with a Beckman
DU spectrophotometer ond the procedure described
by Friedman and Hill'! have been continued. More
efficient quenching was obtained by flattening the
sealed samples in a hydraulic press to give larger
surface areas and thinner melts.

With glasses from the NaF-ZrF -UF, system,
only two absorption spectrum patterns have been
found. One of these superficially resembles that
of crystalline UF ,; the other more closely resembles
crystalline Na, UF .. The Na UF type of pattern
was found only in a localized region near the
Na,UF . composition. Glasses of the ZrF ,-UF,
system were prepared with compositions in the
range from 30 to 70 mole % UF, in 10 mole %
intervals. Outside this region, no glasses were
obtained; within this region, Beer’s law was closely
followed by the UF , type of pattern. Samples aleng
the No, UF -Na,ZrF join that contained less than
60% Na, UF, were not studied because of quench
growth; the Na,UF type of pattern wos found in
samples that contained from 60 to 100 mole %
Na, UF. Nine mixtures were prepared in which
the Zr, content was held at 41 mole %, but the

the decomposition potential rises to 1.12 to 1.18

hydrides of zirconium is not certain.

Physical Chemistry of Fused Salts

£. R., Van Artsdalen
Chemistry Division

Some into the fundamental

insight physical
chemistry of fused salt systems may be realized
from the physical properties of these systems.
Accordingly, the depression of the freezing point of
sodium nitrate by a wide variety of solutes was
determined, and measurements were made of the
density and electrical conductivity of the LiCI-KClI
system and the heat capacity of Cdl,. The molten
NaCl-KCl system is also being investigated in the
hope that it will yield not only practical dota, but
will also contribute to the understanding of short-
range order and the nature of electrical conductivity
of fused salt systems. This work is reviewed
briefly below and is reported in detail in the

Chemistry Division semionnual report, 12

Detailed, highly reproducible measurements of the
density and the electrical conductivity of the fused
salt system LiCl-KC| were completed for the entire
composition field over wide temperature ranges. An
exact linear relation between molar volume and
composition at any specified tempercture indicates
that no complex formation occurs in this molten
system. On a molar basis, lithium chloride is a
considerably better electrical conductor than po-
tassium chloride. It was therefore significant to
discover that substitution of lithium chloride for
some of the potassium chloride actually lowered
the equivalent conductance of the solution below

behavior was based on the consideration of the
relative sizes of the ions. Substitution of small
Lit ions for some of the much larger K* ions will
shrink the short-range chloride semilattice of the
fluid ond make transport by K' appreciably more
difficult. As more and more Li* is substituted for
K*, the conductivity will pass through a minimum
ond again increase until, finally, pure LiCl is
present.
The depression of the freezing point of sodium
nitrate was investigated with a wide variety of
solutes. The results significantly substantiate the
concept that fused salts are essentially totally
ionized and behave as nearly ideal electrolytes,
at relatively high concentrations of the
solute. Thus, calcium, strontium, barium, and lead

The heat capacity of high-purity crystalline
cadmium iodide has been measured from 15°K to
room temperature. It remains necessary fo de-
in the range well below 15°K because of
the observed high heot capacity at this tempera-

1.4-power temperature dependence at the lowest

measured range and, therefore, does not yet fit
either the usual Debye 73 {aw or the TZ law ob-
served here for boron nitride. At 298.16°K, the
following thermodynamic values have been found
for cadmium iodide: c, =19.12cal/mole, 5°=38.5,,
L(F° — H/T =23.15, (H° ~ H3)/T = 15.31. The
5° value has an uncertainty of about £0.5 because
of the high heat capacity value at 159K and its
attendant inherent difficulty of extrapolation to
0°K. This uncertainty is, of course, reflected in
the two derived quantities.

Purification of Small Fluoride Samples
for Phase Studies

F. i. Blankenship C. M. Blood
F. P. Boody
Materials Chemistry Division

Studies of phase equilibria in the NaF-ZrF, and
NaF-ZrF ,-UF , systems by the quenching technique
have been hampered by contamination of the
materials with traces of water which caused hy-
drolysis of the tetravalent halides during the
heating period ond consequent contamination of
the quenched melt with oxide or oxyfluoride phases.
Materials for this and similar phase equilibrium
studies that are essentially free from water and
oxygenated compounds are now routinely prepared
by amodification of the hydrofluorination-hydrogena-
tion pretreatment method used for larger specimens,

In this process a number (up to 28) of small
{(~25 g) samples are placed in nickel or platinum
crucibles on a nickel rack inside a 4-in.-diameter
nickel reactor for processing. A typical processing
cycle of 2 hr of treatment with HF at 800°C fol-
lowed by stripping with H, at 600°C for 18 hr has
been shown to produce material satisfactory for
these purposes. To date, a total of six batches
comprising 67 samples has been prepared. It
appears, however, that handling of the specimens
in a vacuum dry box may be required if freedom
from oxygenated phases is to be maintained.

the structural content should have been
reduced to less than 30 ppm was bubbled with

considerable periods of time aot 692, 785, and

the uranium according to the equation

It was previously reported? that zirconium bers
suspended in molten NaZrF ; contained ot 800°C in
graphite-lined reactors and stirred by bubbling
argon undergo weight losses far in excess of the
amount required to reduce structural metal ions.
This observation was further confirmed by addi-
tional experiments that involved the treatment of
NaZrF¢ in graphite-lined nickel at 800°C with
zirconium chips; the unrecovered zirconium metal
amounted to af least 20 g per kilogram of fused
salt. However, it has since been observed that
little if any loss of weight occurred when zirconium
metal chips were exposed in a parallel experiment
without the graphite liner. The difference might be
due to the formation of zirconium carbide, but the
avoilable data are insufficient to show it. The
possibility that a portion of the zirconium enters
the melt as the trifluoride or as dissolved zirconium
metal has not been ruled out,

The effect of uranium metal on NaZrF, was
studied by adding 5.5 wt % of uranium chips to the
material in a graphite-lined reactor. Unlike the
previous experiments, the mixture was treated with
hydrogen for 2 hr at 800°C, and the material was
subsequently filtered at 700°C. The filtrate
started freezing at about 540°C and contained five
phases typically found in fuels which are reduced
to the extent that orange-red UF 4.2ZrF ; and purple
UF, appear. The uranium content of the filtrate
was 5.00 wt %, and apparently about 90% of the
uranium reacted. If it is considered that the dis-
solved uranium is present as UF, and that all
other reduced phases are insoluble, a reducing
power of 210 meq per kilogram of melt should have
resulted; if all reduced phases remained in solution,

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1953

the theoretical reducing power would be 840 meg/kg.
Chemical analysis by H, evolution showed 550
meq of reducing power per kilogram of filtrate,
which indicated the presence of soluble reduced
phases in addition to the UF,. Less than 20 ppm
of nickel and chromium and 85 ppm of iron were
found.
tained black opaque material which liberated gas
readily when treated with dilute acids. X-ray
analysis of the residue revealed the presence of
ZrH, UF, and uranium metal, along with occluded
melt. Thus it appears that the uranium did not
react quite completely and that some zirconium
tetrafluoride was reduced to the metal by the uro-
nium. Since ZrH, is decomposed to the extent of
about 25% ot 800°C under 1 atm of H,, 4 most of
the zirconium appears as ZrH.

The unfiltered residue in the reactor con-

A further check on the possibility of retaining
reducing species such as Zr°, ZrF,, ZrC, ZH,
and ZrH, in NaZrF, melts was attempted by
treating NaZrF . with NaH (2 moles per kilogram of
melt). The mixture was sparged with hydrogen in
a graphite liner for 24 hr at 800°C and then filtered.
The reactor heel contained a dark-black residue
which was tentatively identified as ZrH mixed
with the melt. Chemical analysis of the white
filtrate showed 106.5 meq of reducing power per
kilogram or about 5% of that expected if all re-
duced species were soluble. Efforts to learn more
about the nature of this apparent reducing power
will be continued.

Reduction of NiF, by Hydrogen

F. F. Blankenship C. M. Blood
CG. M. Watson

Materials Chemistry Division

Considerable attention has been given to the
kinetics of the reduction of Ni** in NaZrF by H,
at 800°C because of the importance of this reduc-
tion in fluoride purification procedures. The use
of graphite linersin the nickel reactors for handling
molten salts is a great convenience in loading and
unloading and in ovoiding excessive contamination
with NiF, during the HF treatment. Accordingly,
for most of the kinetic studies, graphite-lined
reactors have been used. Early suspicions that
graphite might reduce Ni** were allayed by the
large, positive, standard free energy estimated for

+ CF (gas) AF p00 = 118 keal ,

and by the failure to find a noticeable difference
in short experiments without graphite liners. In
carrying out more detailed measurements over a
period of days, the graphite liners have been found
to play an important but incompletely understood
role in the reduction of Ni**. As a result, the
apparent complexity of the reduction kinetics is
now explainable from a qualitative standpoint,
but a new set of experiments without the graphite
liner must supplant the many experiments made
with the use of the graphite liner before quanti-
tative data can be assumed.

In a series of trials which provide evidence for
the effect of grophite, a weighed portion of nickel
fluoride was mixed with previously purified NaZrF
which was then pretreated at 800°C in a graphite-
lined reactor by bubbling inert gas through it at an
approximate rate of 400 cm3/min and, finally, treated
with hydrogen at the same approximate bubble rate.
The varying concentrations of hydrogen fluoride
in the effluent gases were continuously determined
by direct titration of standard potassium hydroxide
samples to the phenolphtalein end point as the
gases bubbled through.

In Table 5.3 are

tions of nickel fluoride used, the volume of inert

listed the initial concentra-
gas passed during pretreatment, the volume of
hydrogen passed, and the percentage of hydrogen
fluoride recovered during the hydrogen treatment.
From the results given in Table 5.3, it appears
that the recovery of hydrogen fluoride decreases
as the length of pretreatment increases; that is,
it is apparent that a fraction of the nickel Huoride
added is reduced by some agent other than hydrogen

and that this fraction increases with increasing
length of pretreatment.

Since it appeared that the graphite liner was in
some fashion effectively reducing the NiF,, one
experiment that essentially duplicated the lost
test shown in Table 5.3 was conducted without
the graphite liner in the nickel vessel. Copious
evolution of hydrogen fluoride occurred. The re-
covery measured amounted to 72.6% at the end of
passage of 60 liters of hydrogen. Kinetically, the
reaction appeors complex in the presence of graphite,
as evidenced by the variable over-all order with
respect to the apparent nickel fluoride concentra~
tions.

Preparation of Various Fluorides

The methods of preparation and some of the

ported. '5 During this quarter, the simple structural
metal fluorides have been used increasingly in
corrosion studies, and a major portion of the avail-

materials. The compositions of these fluorides
were determined by chemical analyses, and some
supplementary x-ray and petrographic determinations
were made for further characterization.

Several batches of FeF; and FeF, have been

of the hydrated NF. Small quantities of anhydrous
NiCl, were similarly prepared from hydrated NiCl,

for special uses.

Previous work had indicated that the precipitate
resulting from the addition of NH HF, toan aqueous
solution of CdCl, could not be quantitatively con-
verted to CdF , by hydrofluorination. Further studies
have shown that the solids resulting from the addi-
tion of NH,HF, to aqueous solutions of either
CdSO, or Cd(C,H,0,), give the same x-ray pattern
as that found for the material prepared from CdCl;
this pattern differs from the accepted pattern for
CdF, and apparently indicates complex or double
salt formation. It was observed that the interaction
of HF with CdCO,

PURIFICATION AND PROPERTIES
OF HYDROXIDES

Purification of Hydroxides

Materials Chemistry Division

The work with hydroxides during this quarter has
been confined to the purification of NaOH and
Sr(OH)., according to the methods previously des-
ED Earlier studies indicated that Na,CO,
could be separated from NaOH by filtering the 50
wt % aqueous solution of NaOH through a fine
sintered-glass filter instead of decanting off the
NoOH solution, as had been done. Further work
has shown that the filtration method produces «a
material with a slightly lower Na,CO, content and
without a significant increase A silica content.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1953

Seven batches of NaOH containing approximately
400 g each have been prepared by filtration and de-
hydration during this quarter. The material obtained
contained from 0.02 to 0.10 wt % of Na,CO, and less
than 0.1 wt % of H,0.

The Sr(OH), purified during this quarter con-
tains considerably less SrCO, than the material
previously prepared; the improvement resulted from
the replacement of a faulty filter. For the 12
batches produced, the SrCO, contents range from
0.02 to 0.06 wt %, and the total alkalinities, as
determined by titration, range from 99.8 to 100.0%.

Reaction of Sodium Hydroxide with
Carbonaceous Matter

E. E. Ketchen L. G. Overholser
Materials Chemistry Division

A few experiments were run to check observations
made elsewhere which suggested that the No,CO
content increased when NaOH was heated at 700°C
ina sealed nickel container, If the increase occurs,
it may be due to the presence in the hydroxide of
carbonaceous matter capable of oxidation to Na,CO,.
Samples of commercial NaOH (about 1.5 wt %
Na,CO,) showed no significant change after
heating at 700°C for 24 hours. However, the
analytical results were not sufficiently precise
to detect very small chonges in this range of
carbonate concentration. When samples of purified
NaOH (one purified by filtration and one by de-
contation) for which occurate CO3 analyses could
be obtained were heated in nickel for 24 hr at
700°C, slight increases in carbonate content were
observed. Both purified NaOH samples contained
0.02 wt % Na, CO, prior to heating. After heating,
the NaOH purified by decantation contained 0.05
wt % Na,CO, and that purified by filtration con-
tained 0.06 wt %. The increase observed could be
due to oxidation of the carbon present in the nickel
or the NaOH. Additional tubes were filled with
NaOH to which had been added 0.2 wt % graphite.
After these tubes were heated at 700°C for 24 hr,
preliminary analyses indicated a marked increase
in carbonate content, This suggests that carbon
is oxidized by NaOH ot 700°C; if this is the case,
NaOH could not be maintained carbonate free at
high temperatures in metals which contain appreci-
able percentages of carbon.

6. CORROSION RESEARCH

Metallurgy Division

ANP Division

The static and the seesaw corrosion testing
facilities have been used to study the corrosion of
Inconel, cermets, and some special alloys in the
fluoride fuel NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %). The
effects of improper degreasing of metals and of
contaminants in the fluorides were studied. Several
tests of bearing materials and hard-facing alloys
have been completed in which the molten fluorides
were used as the corroding agent. The materials
tested are of considerable interest because of their
prospective uses as high-temperature bearings and
valve facings. Various cermets have also been
tested in the fluorides to determine their fitness for
these same applications, Static tests in graphite
capsules of Inconel specimens exposed to fluoride
fuel to which FeF,, FeF,, or NiF, additions were
made gave anomalous results that were presumably
due to the reduction of the added metal fluorides
by the graphite, Static tests of two dissimilar
metals indicated that one metal is usually prefer-
entially attacked,

Fluoride corrosion tests were made in Inconel
thermal convection loops to supplement and extend
the data obtained in the above-mentioned and
previous static tests. Although the thermal con-
vection loops normally operate with a hot-leg
temperature of 1500°F, the temperatures were
varied to determine the effects of both time and
temperature. Additional tests have substantiated
the earlier conclusion that attack by NaF-ZrF ,-UF
(50-46-4 mole %) on Inconel is independent of
temperature, at least in the range of 1500 to
1650°F, and dependent on exposure time. The
purity of the fluoride mixture was shown to be
important when the attack depth was increased by
a factor of 3 in a loop operated with a low-purity
batch of fuel. Reductions in attack, in comparison
with that found in the standard loop, that is, a
loop operated for 500 hr at 1500°F, were achieved
by (1) precirculating the fluorides, (2) pretreating
the fluorides with chromium metal flakes, and (3)
holding the fluorides in contact with Inconel

64

turnings before circulation in the loop. While
pretreatment of the fluorides with metallic chromium
was beneficial, a chromium plate on the pipe wall
was not. Increasing the UF, content in the
fluoride mixture from 4 to 6.5 mole % caused an
increase in mass transfer in the loops and possibly
a slight increase in corrosion. The maximum depth
of attack by the purified ARE fuel solvent, NoZrF,
was comparable to that of the purified fuel mixture
(with 4 mole % UF), although the intensity of the
NaZrF attack was much less and the same mass
transfer was noted.

Additional studies were performed in an attempt
to establish the chemical equilibria of the postulated
corrosion reaction which results in the selective
leaching of chromium from Inconel. Preliminary
values have been obtained for the equilibrium con-
stants involved, but the data are notyet sufficiently
reliable,

Nickel and type 430 stainless steel thermal
convection loops were also operated with the
fluoride NaF-ZrF -UF , (50-46-4 mole %). There
was no measurable mass transfer in the nickel
loop, and the hot-leg surface had a polished finish.
The hot leg of the type 430 stainless steel loop
showed a small amount of smooth, even removal,
with no subsurface voids or intergranular attack;
metal crystals were deposited in the cold leg.

A number of tests, both static and dynamic,
were performed with the liquid metals lithium,
sodium, and lead, Tests have been completed on
beryllium oxide and a number of bearing moterials
and cermets,

The investigation of the mass transfer and
corrosion of metals and alloys in quartz thermal
convection loops containing liquid lead have
continted. The metals tested during this quarter
included a molybdenum-nickel (25% Mo-75% Ni)
alloy, a chromiumeiron-silicon (14% Cr-84% Fe-2%
Si) alloy, and types 304 and 347 stainless steel
specimens which were oxidized prior to contact
with the lead. The most significant result from
this study was the marked improvement in the
resistance to mass transfer of these metais be-
cause of the oxide film, Some static tests on the
corrosion and mass transfer characteristics of
various alloys in contact with lithium were com
pleted.

Static tests on a number of solid fuel elements
were performed in sodium and sodium hydroxide.
While there was no evidence of attack in any of the
sodium tests, all the fuel elements were severely
attacked in the hydroxide. In connection with a
study of hydroxide containment, the equilibriom
pressures of hydrogen over a number of hydroxide-
metal systems are being determined.

FLUORIDE CORROSION IN STATIC AND
SEESAW TESTS

Metallurgy Division

H. J. Buttram R. E. Meadows
N. V. Smith

Both the static capsule and the seesaw tests
provide relatively cheap and simple means of
investigating the many parameters which affect
fluoride corrosion. The seesaw tests in which the
capsule containing the fluoride is rocked in a
furnace were operated at 4 cps with the hot end of
the capsule at 815°C and the cold end at 700°C.
The static tests in which the fluoride mixture is
sealed in ao copsule were usually conducted for
100 hr at 816°C. In order to permit testing of
material which could not be readily fabricated into
capsules or to permit variation of the surface-to~
volume ratio of fluoride to metal, a number of tests
were performed in which the fluoride and metal
specimens were contained in graphite capsules.
All capsules ‘are filled in a helium dry box, and
therefore oxidation or hydrolysis of the contents of
the capsules is improbable.

Inconel Corrosion by Fluorides with Metal
Fluoride Additives

In general, corrosion of Inconel specimens by
several fluoride preparations in graphite capsules
was similar to that obtained when Inconel capsules
were used in static tests. Some carburization of
the specimens was obtained, but no other special
effects were observed.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1953

However, when fluorides to which had been
added considerable quantities of FeF,, FeF,, or
NiF, were tested in graphite capsules containing
Inconel specimens, rather surprising results were
obtained. In each case, tests at 800°C showed
extensive deposition of iron or nickel, usually
in films onthe graphite capsule and on the speci-
men. When FeF, was the additive {in amounts up
to 5 wt %), the corrosion of the Inconel specimen,
as observed by meteilographic examination and by
analysis of the final melt for chromium, was much
less than expected. [n similar tests with FeF ,
corrosion of the Inconel was virtually undetectable
by either technique. In this case, the precipitated
film of metal appeared to be protective.

When NiF, was the added material, however, no
protection of the specimen by the film resulted.
in these experiments, extremely heavy subsurface
void formation to a depth of 9 mils was observed,
There is evidence that corrosion by fluoride mix-
tures with NiF, added is more severe at 600 than
at 800°C.

These experiments suggest that graphite or some
unknown contaminant in the graphite is responsible
for reduction of the added metal fluoride. While
reduction of FeF_, for example, by graphite should
have an extremely tow equilibrium constant, it is
possible that the volatile reaction product (CF))
escapes from the system and permits the reaction
to proceed, It is also possible that there is
sufficient oxygen or water adsorbed in or on the
graphite so that reduction of oxide by carbon (o
reaction with an appreciable equilibrium constant
at these temperatures) is responsible for these
effects. Further study of this and similar reactions
is in progress,

Corrosion of Various Metal Combinations

A series of experiments in which various metals,
either alone or in combination, were tested in
molten fluorides in graphite capsules have yielded
the following results. (1) Nickel alone shows no
attack, (2) Chromium-plated Inconel shows heavy
subsurface void formation at all temperatures
above 600°C; the voids were 3 to 4 mils deep at
700°C and above. (3) Chromium metal yielded high
values for chromium content of the melt; it is
possible, however, that slight surface oxidation of
the chromium pellets used was responsible for this
dissolved material. (4) When Inconel and chromium
specimens were exposed fogether, the chromium

65
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

test piece was nearly completely dissolved, while
the Incone! specimen, which was covered with a
thin metal layer, was almost completely unattacked.
(5) However, when Incone! and nickel were exposed
together, the nickel appeared unaffected, while
the Incone! was badly attacked; at 700°C, for
example, the heavy subsurface void formation
reached a depth of 3 to 4 mils.

Corrosion of Cermets

Several cermets which were considered for
bearings and hard-focing applications were tested
for resistance to fluoride corrosion. Three of these
ceramic-metal materials were subjected to static
tests, The materials consisted of heavy metal

carbides bonded by nickel and were obtained from
the Firth Sterling Company. Table 6.1 presents
results obtained when the cermets were exposed to
two fluoride mixtures in graphite capsules. The
results indicate fair resistance to the two fluoride
mixtures under the conditions of the test, and
there was no apparent change in the appecrance of
the specimens after testing.

Another set of specimens was subjected to see.
saw tests in Inconel capsules for 100 hr, with the
specimens restricted to the hot zone of the Inconel
tube. The hot-zone temperature was 816°C, and
the cold-zone temperature was 730°C. Results of
these tests are presented in Table 6,2. Some of
these specimens contained chromium as a binding

agent, and, as expected, these materials were
attacked by the fluorides. Metamic LT-1, in both
the heat-treated and unheat-treated conditions,
was attacked severely. While the attack on the
Firth Sterling 27 and on the Kenameta! 151A in the
seesaw tests was only moderate, the increased
severity of attack in the seesaw tests compared
with that in the static tests is evidenced by the
test data on Firth Sterling 27.

Inconel with Dil and Trichloroethylene Additives

Several thermal convection loops had more than
average depths of attack which were thought to be
due to improper degreasing of the loops prior to
filling. Therefore, a static test was run in which
six drops of oil and six drops of trichloroethylene
were added to an Inconel capsule containing an
inconel specimen and the solution was allowed to
evaporate in an attempt to duplicate improper de-
greasing. This capsule was then loaded with the
fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF UF (50-46-4 mole %)
and tested for 100 hr at 1608 under static con.
ditions, along with a control capsule for com-
parison. The specimen in the: control capsule had
greater weight oss and depth of attack than the
specimen contaminated by the evaporation of the
trichlorcethylene-cil solution. It appears that
under the conditions of this test, the contamination
was not detrimental and might even have been
beneficial.

inconel Corrosion by Fluorides with
MoS, Additive

Molybdenum disulfide is being used as a Swage-
lok lubricant in fluoride production systems, and
therefore it was pertinent to determine whether
increased corrosion of the Inconel tubing would
result if some of the MoS, were to contaminate the
fluoride. Accordingly, two seesaw tests of the
fluoride mixture Naf-ZrF -UF | (50-46-4 mole %) in
Inconel tubing were run for 100 hr. In one of these
tests, an addition of 3 wt % Mo5, was made to the
fluoride; the other test was run with no addition to
fluoride.

Metallographic examination of sections of tubing
from hot and cold zones of both tests showed that
more severe attack had taken place in the test with
the MoS, addition. The cause of this increased
corrosion is not known. The type and extent of
attack both with and without MoS, additions is
shown in Fig. 6.1.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1953

Screening Tests of Metallic Bearing Materials

Several tests have been completed in the screen-
ing program on materials for potential use in bearing
and hard-facing applications. Materials for these
uses must be resistant to corrosion by molten
fluorides. One set of specimens consisted of
Hastelloys B, C, and D, and Stellites 1, 6, 12, 21,
25, 40, and 41 deposited on pieces of type 347
stainless steel. These composite specimens were
tested in the fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF ,-UF,
(50-46-4 mole %) for 100 hr at 816°C under static
conditions. in these tests, it appeared. that
Hastelloys B, C, and D and Stellites 21, 25, and
40 satisfactorily resisted attack by this flueride

mixture. Stellites 1, 6, 12, and 41 appeared to be

attacked severely. The appearance of Stellite 40
after the test is shown in Fig. 6.2; the attack is
limited to. a depth of 4 or 5 mils. As reported
previously, it is apparently the carbides in the
Stellites which are preferentially attacked by the
fused fluoride salts, and it appears that the
Stellites of low carbon content are not so severely
attacked. The results of these tests are presented

in Table 6.3.

FLUORIDE CORROSION OF INCONEL IN
THERMAL CONVECTION LOOPS

G. M. Adamson
Metallurgy Division

The use of thermal convection loops for determi-
ing dynamic corrosion by liquids has been previously
described.! Unless otherwise stated for the fests
described in the following sections, the tempera-
ture of the hot leg of the loop was maintained at
1500°F and the temperature of the uninsulated
cold leg was approximately 1300°F. With the
fluoride salts, this temperature difference results
in a fluid velocity of about & to 8 fpm. The usual
festing period is 500 hours.

Effect of Fluoride Batch Purity

Pilot-plant batches of the fluoride fuel mixture
NaF-ZrF -UF {50-46-4 mole %) which received a
24-hr gas purification instead of the customary
8 hr or less are now available for thermal con-
vection loop work. The longer gas purification
results in a reduction of the hydrogen fluoride
content of the melt. Corrosion results from three

Inconel loops operated with this material showed

intergranular penetration to a depth of 6 mils. The
importance of purity of the materials is evident
from these tests, since the average maximum pene-
tration in standard production batches has been

which was down to 450 to 600 ppm, that is, less
than one half the previous contamination. Some
reduction was also obtained in the amount of iron
present.

Effect of Chromium Additives

Data were presented previously? which indicated
doubtful improvement in corrosion characteristics
when chromium powder was added to the fluoride

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1953

mixtures. However, in © new fest, in which the
chromium was added in the form of coarse metallic
flakes, a reduction in the depth of attack was
found. The fluoride mixture was held in contact
with the chromium flakes overnight at a temperature
of 1300°F before being charged into the loop.
Examination subsequent to operation of the loop
showed a’ maximum penetration of only 4 mils, as
compared with penetration of the contro! loop to a
depth of 15 mils. As in previous tests with
chromium additions, a thin, continuous, metallic
deposit was found in the cold leg of the loop.

One thermal convection test was run in which
the chromium was added in the form of an electro-
plated layer on the inner surface of a 6-in. length
of Inconel pipe. This pipe was welded into the
top of the hot leg of a standard loop. After oper-
ation of the loop, no trace of the chromium could
be found in the hot leg by metallographic exami-
nation. Typical subsurface void attack was found
in the Inconel, with a maximum penetration of
10 mils. No data are available on the hydrogen
fluoride content of the batch circulated in this
loop. The 10 mils of attack is slightly higher
than the average, but no change in attack could be
seen on opposite sides of the hot leg where the
section was welded into the loop. Scattered
metallic particles were found on the cold-leg wall.
This test confirms the earlier finding that, while a
direct chromium addition to the fuel may result in a
beneficial effect, a chromium plate on the pipe
wall does not offer any protection in a dynamic
system.

Although large additions of chromium were made
to the fluoride mixtures in both these loops, the
chromium . concentration in the fluoride mixtures
after circulation in both loops was uniform and was
only 1600 ppm. A study of the chemical analyses
of fluoride mixtures from other loops showed this
concentration to be the maximum reported. Attempts
have been made by the Materials Chemistry Di-
vision to obtain apparent solubilities of chromium
of over 1% aot 800°C in this fluoride mixture, but it
is speculated that 1600 ppm is an equilibrium
concenfration. Attempts to obtain this concen-

tration in the laboratory have not yet been success-
ful.

Pretreatment of Fluoride with Inconel

Some reduction in corrosive attack was obtained
by first holding the fluorides in contact with
Inconel turnings for 100 hr at 1300°F. After
subsequent operation of the convection loop,
examination revealed the maximum depth of attack
of the Inconel to be 11 mils, as compared with a
maximum depth of 14 mils in the control tests.
This pretreatment, although it apparently does not
have as beneficial an effect on the corrosion
properties as does the chromium addition, has the
advantage that it prevents the formation of a layer
on the cold-leg wall. tt is likely that larger
reductions in attack would be obtained with higher
treatment temperatures, although it is not cone
venient to do this with existing equipment.

Effect of Exposure Time

Two series of Inconel loops have been filled
and are now being operated to determine the
effect of time on corrosion and mass transfer.
One series is circulating the fluoride fuel NaF-
ZrF -UF (50-46-4 mole %), and the other is
circulating the fuel solvent NaZrF_; periods of
operation have ranged from 500 to 5000 hours.
Both series of loops were filled with especially
purified fluorides. Metallographic results are now
available for the loops which circulated fuel for
500 and 1000 hours,

Moderate to heavy subsurface void formation
with a maximum penetration of 8 mils was found in
the hot leg of a loop that operated for 1000 hours.
The voids tended to concentrate more in the grain
boundaries than they do in standard loops. An
intermittent very thin layer that appeared to be
metallic was noted in the cold leg, and a thin,
metallic ring of chromium metal was visible in the
cold trap. This is the first Inconel! loop circulating
the NaF-ZrF -UF , fuel in which a definite cold-leg
layer has been found.

The standard loop that operated for 500 hr
showed moderate to heavy attack with a maximum

penetration of 6 mils. No metallic deposit was

visible in the cold leg or in the trap of this loop.

A dark layer was found in the trap, but it was not
metallic. Comparison of the results from these
two loops helps to confirm the previous observation
that a decrease in rate of attack is apparent with

longer operating times; however, the attack does

not stop completely. The increase in the metallic
deposit on the cold leg and in the trap points to

72

mass transfer as the cause of the continuing

attack.

Effect of Temperature

Additional confirmation of the conclusion pre-
sented in the previous report® that attack is
independent of hot-leg temperature from 1400 to
1650°F has been obtained. A loop operated for
1000 hr with a hot-leg temperature of 1650°F
showed attack comparable to that of another loop
which operated for 1000 hr at 1500°F. Both loops
were filled with fluoride fue! of comparable purity,
and the attack in both was mederate, with a maxi-
mum penetration of 8 mils. Furthermore, the voids
in both loops were similar, although they were
larger and more concentrated ot the grain boundaries
than they were in similar loops operated for only

500 hours.

Effect of Surface-to-Yolume Ratio

Large differences hove always been observed
between the corrosion results obtained in seesaw
tests and those obtained in convection loops. One
of the main variations is in the surface-to-voume
To determine the effect of this variable, a
loop was constructed from l-in. tubing instead of
from the standard Y-in.-IPS pipe. The loop with
the l-in. tubing has a surface-to-volume ratio of
4.5 in.2/in.3, while that of a standard loop is
6.5 in.2/in.3. The attack in the hot-leg of the
loop with 1-in. tubing was light to moderate, with
a maximum penetration of 9 mils. A standard loop
filled from the same fuel batch showed similar
attack, with a maximum penetration of 5.5 mils.
The percentage in attack depth was
about the same as that for the decrease in the
surface-to-volume ratios.

ratios.

increase

This increase in attack
depth with a decrease in surface-to-volume ratio
again points to impurities in the fluorides as the
major factor in corrosion.

Fluoride with 6.5 mole % uF,

Tests have been completed on two Inconel loops
circulating the fluoride fuel mixture with the
highest UF, concentration contemplated for use in
the ARE, that is, NoF-ZrF -UF , (53.3-40.0-6.5
mole %). For the first test, which was run to
provide preliminary data, the loop was not thoroughly

cleaned, and the fuel preparation was not of
optimum purity. The preliminary test loop was
operated for 350 hr at 1500°F, and, upon exami-
nation, was found to have moderate to heavy attack
in the form of subsurface voids to a maximum depth
of 12.5 mils. A very thin metallic deposit was
found in the cold leg. The second test loop was
cleaned by circulating NaF-ZrF,, and it was
charged with high-purity fuel. After 500 hr. of
operation, this loop showed heavy attack to a
maximum penetration of 7 mils, as shown in Fig.
6.4. Again, a thin, metallic layer was found in
the cold leg. Two more standard Inconel loops are
now being operated with this high-purity fuel
mixture. The preliminary tests indicate that the
higher uranium content of this fuel may cause a
small increase in the depth of attack, but additional
tests are needed for confirmation. The higher
uranium content also causes an increased amount
of mass transfer, as shown by the thin, metallic
layer in the cold leg.

The Fluoride NaZrF
One batch of NaZ:F, the ARE fuel solvent, was

tested in a series of six Inconel loops. Upon
examination, the loops showed light to moderate
attack, with maximum penetration ranging from 4 to
8 mils, and the fluoride was found to contain
average impurities, that is, 230 ppm of Cr, 55 ppm

of Fe, and less than 20 ppm of Ni. A typical
corrosion specimen taken from the hot leg of one
of these loops is shown in Fig. 6.5. The voids
are larger, and they are more definitely concen-
trated in the grain boundaries than they were in the
tests with the uranium-bearing fluoride mixture.
The low chromium content of the fluoride after
circulation in these loops is not understood be-
cause, even though the attack was less, it was not
decreased so much as was the chromium content.
There was a gray layer above the freezing line in
the trap of each of these loops that was about ¥ to
Y in. in thickness. This material was identified
petrographically as fine, needle-like, metallic
crystals of chromium metal dispersed in the fluoride.
Some mass: transfer had, therefore, taken place even
with the low chromium concentrations found in
these loops.

cleaned with NaZrF_ and operated with high-purity
fuel. After circulation of the fuel, no metallic
crystals were found in the fluorides in the cold leg
or in the trap nor could any layer be identified on
the cold-leg surface. The surface of the hot leg
was bright and polished, and there was no evidence
of subsurface voids or intergranular attack. The
wall thickness was within commercial tolerances,
but it was again on the low side. lt seems likely
that a small amount of even removal had taken
place, since the surface was polished; however,
this seems to be the smallest amount of mass
transfer yet found.

One type 430 stainless steel loop operated with
the fuel NaF-ZrF -UF (50-46-4 mole %) for 500 hr
at 1500°F with no sign of plugging. However, a
preliminary metallographic examination revealed
unexpected even surface removal in the hot leg
rather than the subsurface voids in the grain
boundaries that were found in the type 316 stainless
steel loop. The hot-leg surface was smooth, with
no subsurface voids or intergranular type of attack.
Carbides appear to have been leached (or possibly
to have gone back into solution) from a zone about
2 mils wide on the surface, and considerable grain
growth had taken place in this zone. The outer
surface of the pipe was quite rough, and therefore
the wall thickness measurements are questionable.
Variations in thickness of from 0.106 to 0,109 in.
were found. Since the specified thickness of the
wall was 0,109 in., it is evident, at least, that no
large amount of even removal occurred. However,
some removal had taken ploce, as shown by the
scattered metallic crystals adhering to the cold-leg
surface.

Mass Transfer in Liquid Lead

Investigations of mass transfer and corrosion of
various metal specimens in small, quartz, thermal
convection loops containing liquid lead have been
«continued. Details of the construction and operation
of the loops and the results obtained for Inconel,
columbium, molybdenum, types 304, 347, 410, and

Nichrome V, and a nickel-iron (30% Ni-70% Fe)
alloy were reported previously.’ The metals tested
during this quarter included a molybdenum-nicke!
(25% Mo-75% Ni) olloy, a chromium-iron-silicon
(14% Cr—84% Fe~27% Si) alloy, and types 304 and
347 stainless steel specimens which were oxidized
prior to contact with the lead.

The molybdenum-nickel alloy loop was operated
for 672 hr with hot- and cold-leg temperatures of
820 and 480°C, respectively. Plugging did not
occur, but a small omount of mass-transferred
material was found in the bottom of the cold leg.

this loop were comparable to those previously
obtained for the 400 series stainless steels.

The loop containing chromium-iron-silicon alloy
specimens was operated for 550 hi with hot- and
cold-leg temperatures of 805 and 490°C, respec-
tively. Again, the mass transfer which occurred
was not sufficient to stop circulation, but a plug
was starting to form in the cold leg. The amount
of mass-transferred material was slightly greater
than that found in loops containing the 400 series
stainless steels. Rather severe intergranular ai-
tack to a depth of 12 mils wos found.

The effect of an oxide coating on the metal
specimens was also studied. Sections of types
347 and 304 stainless steel tubing were oxidized
until they showed interference colors corresponding
to oxide thicknesses of 500 to 1000 A. These test
specimens were then tested in quartz loops, and

tubular specimen, much less corrosion was ob-
served on the outer surface. The attack appeared
to have started on the outer surface of the specimen
at isolated points along the surface, perhaps cor-
responding to breaks in the oxide film, and to have
spread out in fan-like fashion (Fig. 6.7). Cor-
rosion of the specimen in the cold leg of the loop
was much less pronounced.

A type 304 stainless steel loop containing previ-
ously oxidized specimens was also operated ‘for
550 hr without the formation of a plug large enough
to stop circulation. The hot- and cold-leg temper-
atures were 800 and 550°C, respectively. Metallo-
graphic examination of this ‘loop is incomplete.
In previous tests with type 304 stainless steel
specimens in the as-received condition, the loops
had to be terminated within 100 hr because of plug
formation. :

Static Tests of Beryllium Oxide in Sodium,
Lithivm, and Lead

Specimens. of beryllium oxide, approximately
by % by % in., cut from 2-in. hexagonal blocks
hot pressed by the Norton Company were tested
in sodium, lithium, and lead. One half the speci-
mens were tested as cut from the original block,
and one half were tested after having been refired
for 2 hr at 1800°C. The refired specimens had
higher density ond lower apparent porosity than

those specimens which were not refired. ' The
sodium was contained in Inconel tubes, and the
lithium and the lead were contained in Armco iron
tubes. The test time was 100 hr, and the temper-
ature was 538°C. The weight and dimension
changes after test were less than 1.5%. The
weight gains in sodium and lithium were presumed
to be due to absorption of these metals. The
specimens tested in lead appeared to be affected
the lecst. Edges of the specimens appeared to
be just as sharp ofter test as before. The refired
beryllium oxide specimens apparently had greater
resistance to aftack than did the specimens that
were not refired. The one exception appeared in
the sodium test, and, even in this fest, the refired
specimen was more dimensionally stable.

Spinner Tests of Inconel and Type 405
Stainless Steel in Sodium

A spinner test was run with Inconel-X in sodium,
but the apparatus was not rotated. This test was
run to check the possibility that attack noted in
a previous spinner test might be due to impurities
in the sodium or in the atmosphere rather than to
the velocity of test. However, much lighter attack
and less weight change was noted on these speci-
mens than on the Inconel-X specimens previously
tested at fluid velocities of 405 fpm; therefore it
is evident that most of the attack in spinner tests
is due to velocity effects.

A spinner test with type 405 stainless steel
(12% Cr) has also been run at a velocity of 405
fpm. These tests were conducted at a temperature
of 816°C for 100 hr in sodium. The weight change
was of the order of +0.5%, and the attack was
intergranular to a maximum depth of 3 mils, with
surface roughness to approximately 1 mil,

Static Tests of Bearing Materials in Sodium,

Lithium, and Lead

A number of metal alloys of potential value in
bearing and hard-facing applications in liquid
metals have been tested in sodium, lead, and
lithium under static conditions for 100 hr at 816°C.
The results of these screening tests are given in

Table 6.4.

Static Tests of Stainless Steels in Lithium

A series of static tests of various stainless
steels in two types of lithium (helium packed and
oil packed) have been run for 100 hr of 816°C. In
this group of tests, types 310 and 446 stainless
steel showed the least resistance to attack by
lithium, while type 347 stainless steel showed the
best resistance. Types 304, 309, 316, and 347
stainless steel showed very little or no subsurface
attack. Crystals of what were identified by x-ray
diffraction as a chromium carbide phase (DPH
1000 to 1100) were detected on the exposed sur-

76

face of all the austenitic stainless steel speci-
mens, as shown in Fig. 6.8. These crystals were
more numerous and slightly larger on the speci-
mens tested in the oil-packed lithium, os would
be expected because of the higher carbon content
of this material. Chemical analyses of the lithium
baths after testing revealed no significant changes
in the iron, nickel, and chromium contents of the
oil-packed and helium-packed lithium. In the tests
in which weight changes were noted, the weight
changes of the specimens in helium-packed lithium
were less than those of the specimens in oil-
packed lithium, possibly because of the higher
purity of the gos-packed lithium. Results of these
tests are summarized in Table 6.5.

Oxidizing Power of Hydroxide Corrosion Products

The work on trivalent nickel compounds formed
in hydroxides was continued. The compound
NaNiO, was found to undergo a change in crystal
structure at about 225°C, and the structure of the
high-temperature form has been determined. The
existing evidence indicates that the transformation
may be of the martensitic type.

During this quarter, equilibrium pressures of

by using a modified form of the apparatus previ-

The modified apparatus includes a long nickel

sealed by means of a Kovar seal, The pressures
established inside the nickel tube and in its
quartz jacket (nickel being permeable to hydrogen
at the temperatures utilized in these experiments)
are measured by two mercury moanometers con-
nected to the system by seals; therefore the pres-
sure built up by the hydrogen that diffuses through
the nickel can be determined independently from
the pressure inside the tube. This apparatus
utilizes both the passivity of nickel to sodium
hydroxide and the nonpermeability of quartz to
hydrogen. Equilibrium pressures may be estab-
lished more rapidly by adding hydrogen to the
quartz-nickel cavity to bring its pressure close
to that inside the nickel tube.

The hydrogen pressure of the KOH-Ni system,
as determined in the above-described apparatus,

was found to be less than 1 mm at 600°C, while
it is in the range of 8 to 12 mm at 700°C. Measure-
ments gt higher temperatures are being made.

The NaOH-Cu and NaOH-Au hydrogen equilibrium
pressures were redetermined, and the results
agreed closely with those previously reported:®
for the NaOH-Au system at 900°C, 3.5 mm com-
pared with 3.0; ar 1000°C, 7.5 compared with
6.0 mm. The results for the NaOH-Cu system
show reasonable agreement at 700°C (2.2 mm com-
pared with 3.0 mm); however, the more recent
determination at B00°C shows a thus far unex-
plained time dependence of the hydrogen pressure.
An initial pressure of 14 mm gradually fell to
about 10 mm after a few hours; the 10-mm pressure
then remained constant,

When

leached from the alloy. While a considerable frac-
tion of this corrosion may be ascribed to oxidizing
impurities in the molten material or on the capsule

well be responsible. The reaction

soluble and showed activities proportional to their
concentrations, proceed nearly to completion. That
such is not the case, or at least that the reaction
does not equilibrate at a reasoncble rate, is well
demonstrated in a large number of corrosion tests.

If the assumption that the physical solubility
of chromium as metal in fused NaZrF, is quite
low is permissible, then equilibration of UF dis-
solved in NaZrF_. with chromium metal followed
by separation of the phases and analysis of the
filtrate would permit evaluation of the equilibrium
constant of the reaction. For these studies, the
purest NaZrF. available was used, along with
chromium metal hydrogen fired ot 2000°F in nickel
equipment of the type previously described. All

trates obtained were submitted for chemical anal-
ysis, and the results shown in Table 6.7 were
obtained.

These data indicate that equilibration is rapid
because the values obtained after 5 hr at temper-
ature are not distinguishable from those obtained
for a shorter exposure. It is obvious from the ex-
posure of the nonuranium-bearing material that the
chromium contains some oxide and that hydrogen
firing of the nickel equipment is not sufficiently
complete. (Subsequent experiments, not suffi-
ciently complete to report, in which the chromium
was fired under dry hydrogen directly in the nickel
reaction vessel demonstrate that it is possible
to have less than 200 ppm of Cr in the nonuranium-
bearing material.) The chromium concentration in-
crease resulting from the reduction of UF, to UF,
was obtained by subtracting the chromium content
of the nonuranium-bearing material from the total
chromium found, and this value was used for ob-
taining the UF; concentration, since the methods
for determining Uk, in the presence of divalent
chromium are not sufficiently accurate to permit
a direct determination of UF.

If unit activity is assumed for the chromium and
activities equal to concentrations (in moles per
mole of solvent) are assumed for the uranium and
chromium species, these data indicate that the
equilibrium constant at 600°C is 1.2 by 10-3,
and, at 800°C, it is 1.7 by 103. The data are

certainly not sufficient in amount or in precision

change for the reaction at 600°C is about +11.5

value and the value of ~7 kcal calculated for the

to be ascribed to solvation of the UF,.

A sodium-to-air radiator was fabricated by brazing
the tube-to-fin joints and backing up the previously
heliarc-welded tube-to-header and manifold joints
with brazing alloy G-E No. 62, a nickel-chromium-
silicon alloy. The radiator assembly was welded
and then dry-hydrogen brazed of 2100°F for op-
proximately 30 minutes. Subsequent testing after
slow cooling showed all the welded and brazed
joints to be satisfactorily leak and pressure tight.
The duplex fabrication technique, that is, the
combination of heliarc welding and high-temperature
brazing, apparently produces satisfactory, sound,
teak-tight radiators and minimizes many of the
problems encountered in brazing operations. The
use of the G-E No. 62 brazing alloy eliminates
many of the deleterious effects of the Nicrobraz
alloy that was formerly used.

The investigation of the fabrication of high-
conductivity fin materials included oa study of
diffusion barriers for use between Inconel and
copper, electroplating copper to obtain oxidation
resistance, and the fabrication of clad-copper fin
material in sufficient quantities for experimental
radiators. Furthermore, several new high-conduc-
tivity fin materials were studied because it was
found that diffusion of nicke! and copper made the
brazing of Inconel-clad copper fins to Inconel
tubing less satisfoctory than it was previously
thought to be. Each clad-copper and copper-alumi-
num bronze fin material was tested by brazing to
either Inconel or stainless steel tubing with each
of the following brazing alloys: low-melting-point
Nicrobraz (LMNB), ‘‘electroless’’ nickel-phospho-
rus, LMNB plus 10 wt % ‘electroless’ nickel-
phosphorus, and nickel-phosphorus-chromium alloys.

The assembly of stainless steel-clad fuel plates
into fuel elements is being studied, and it appears
that inert-arc plug welding may be a feasible
method of fabrication, The configuration investi-
gated consisted basically of a 0.02é-in.-thick type
304 stainless steel-clad type 304 stainless steel
sheet 24 in. long that was to be joined on the edge
at 2-in. intervals to a 0.041-in.-thick type 304
stainless steel side plate. :

Stress-rupture tests of coarse- and fine-grained
Inconel in argon and in fluoride fuel NaF-Z¢F ,-UF ,
at temperatures of 1300, 1500, and 1650°F are
being made. The tests completed at 1500°F show
that hydrogen is the most detrimental environment
and that air is the most beneficial, as far as rupture
life is concerned, and that increased ductility in
air and in sodium is probably the result of decarbu-~
ization. Tube-burst tests of triaxially stressed
Inconel tubes are being made with fluoride fuel
NaF-ZrF ,-UF , inside the tube and purified argon
outside. Comparison of the data obtained with
creep data shows that the tube-burst time is about
the some as the time for 2% elongation in the

Brazing of Radiator Assemblies

It was stated in the previous report that the G-E
No. 62 brazing alloy (69% Ni-20% Cr-11% Si)
might be suitable for use on ANP-type sodium-to-air
radiators. Stainless steel joints brazed with this
alloy were considered to possess adequate resist
ance to cracking. This alloy was also shown te
exhibit excellent resistance to high-temperature
oxidation. A metallographic section of a joint of
an Inconel tube brazed to a type 304 stainless
steel fin and exposed in static air for 1200 hr at
1500°F is shown in Fig. 7.1. It can be seen that

the extent of attack is minor. Previous tests had
also shown that this alloy was attacked by molten
sodium only slightly a 1500°F in a 100-hr test.

Therefore the sodiume-to-air radiator shown in
Fig. 7.2 was fabricated by brazing the tube-to-fin
joints and backing up the previously heliarc-welded
tube-to-header and manifold joints with brazing
alloy. This method of fabrication is thought to be
the most reliable for obtaining a pressure-tight
system with one brazing operation.

The tube-to-header welds were manually inert-
gas tungsten-arc welded with argon as the shielding
gas and helium as the back-up gas. The header
caps and the manifold were also heliarc welded by
using suitable joint designs to permit complete
penetration.

The sequence of manifold and header cap welding
was such that the nickel-chromium-silicon alloy
could always be opplied to the underside of the
joint after welding. Each tube-to-header weld was
also backed up with this brazing alloy. A typical

 

PERICD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1953

heliarc-welded joint backed up with the nickel-
chromiym-silicon braze is shown in Fig. 7.3. It
can be seen that the probability of obtaining «a
leak-tight joint is very good. :

The completed assembly was then dry-hydrogen
brazed by using the thermal cycle shown in Fig.
7.4. A preheat at 1600°F ‘was utilized to permit
an equilization of temperatures over the assembly.
The thermocouple, which was ploced directly on
the radiator, also indicated that a maximum temper-
ature of 2150°F was attained and that the unit was
held above 2100°F for approximately 3) minutes.
The brozing technique used for this fabrication
ensures o relatively slow cooling rate so that
cracking upon cooling as a result of uneven thermal
contractions should not be a major problem.

Helium leak testing at fess than 0,03-x vacuum
revealed that all welded and brazed joints in the

radiator were leak tight, The assembly was also

pressure tight to a 20-psi helium pressure when it

It is thus believed that a combination heliarc-
welding and high-temperature-brazing procedure is
satisfactory for fabricating sound leak-tight radi-
ators. This duplex technique has been shown to
minimize many of the problems and difficulties
usually encountered in brazing operations. The
vse of the G-E No. 62 brazing alloy also seems to
minimize or completely eliminate many of the
deleterious effects of the Nicrobraz alloy that was
formerly used.

Brazing of High-Conductivity Radiator Fins

Although the problem of brazing lnconel-clad

method. Accordingly, a group of other high-conduc-
tivity fin materials was fabricated for brazing tests.

The high-conductivity fin materials studied
during the current investigation were types 446
and 310 stainless steel-clad copper and a copper
aluminum (94% Cu—-6% Al) bronze. The fabrication
of these materials is described below under ‘*High-
Conductivity Metals for Radiator Fins.” The
brazing alloys investigated were low-melting-point
Nicrobroz (LMNB), ‘“‘electroless’’ nicke!-phospho-
rus (90% Ni~10% P) dlloy, low-melting-point Nicro-
braz plus 10 wt % ‘electroless’ nickel-phosphorus
alloy, and nickel-phosphorus-chromium (80% Ni— 10%

placed side by side, and the brazing alloy was
applied initially to one end of the specimen. All
test specimens were brazed in ~70°F dew-point
hydrogen for 10 minutes. A summary of the data
and the results of this study are presented in Table
7.1, along with an evaluation of the flowability of
of the braze material based on visual observations.

The following conclusions have been drawn from
these tests:

1. AH the brazing alloys investigated, which
were chosen because of oxidation resistance and
favorable melting temperature, exhibited excellent
flow against types 310 and 446 stainless steel-clad
copper when used against Inconel tubing, It
appears that the Inconel behaved as a '‘carrier’”’
for the alloys.

2. The oxide films present on the as-received
type 310 stainless steel tubing used in this in-
vestigation inhibited in varying degrees the flow
of all the brazing alloys tested. The removal of

this oxide by prebright annealing at 1150°C or by
el ectropolishing improved the observed flow. The
most marked effect was the improved flow of
LLMNB.

3. Removal of oxide films by prebright annealing
or by electropolishing the type 446 stainless steel
tubing did not markedly improve the flow of the
brazing alloys and was particularly ineffective for
the LMNB alloy.

4, The addition of 10 wt % nickel-phosphorus
(90% Ni—-10% P) alloy to the LMNB alloy markedly
improved flow against type 446 stainless steel
tubing, although this addition was not beneficial
against type 310 stainless steel tubing.

5. The oxide film which formed on the copper-
aluminum (94% Cu-6% Al) fin material during the
brazing cycle impeded flow of all the brazing al-
loys investigated. Prevention of this oxide forma-
tion by preplating with electrolytic nickel permitted
excellent wetting and flow of all the brazing
alloys investigated.

Work on the ‘electroless’ preplating of nickel-

has continued, and the method is being applied to
practical brazing problems, A commercially availa-
ble system: of plating solutions is now being
successfully used to plate the nickel-phosphorus

Lustralloy, manufactured by Metal Processing

1020°C for approximately 10 minutes. The speci-
men was then cooled slowly under a hydrogen
otmosphere. The finished specimen was bright,
and the joints were well brazed. A similarly
brazed assembly is shown in Fig, 7.5. As con be
seen, the brazing alloy, originally uniformly distri«
buted on the fins and absent on the tubes, was

investigated in these preliminary experiments
consisted basically of a 0.026-in.~thick type 304
stainless steel-clad type 304 stainless steel sheet
24 in. long that was to be joined on the edge of
2-in, intervals to a 0.041-in.-thick type 304 stain-
less steel side plate,

The joint design considered to be optimum for
welding is shown in Fig. 7.7. A hole 0.067 in. in
diameter is drilled in a 0.041-in.-thick header
sheet to receive a projection 0.062 x 0.026 x 0.125
in. obtained by edge milling the 0.026-in. type 304
stainless steel-clad sheet. The 0.84-in. extension
of the projection above the header sheet was pre-
determined from the following volume considera-
tions: (1) the volume of the 0.067-in.~diq, 0.041-
in.-deep header hole was 0.00015 in.%; (2) the
volume of the 0.082 x 0.026 x 0.125-in, projection
was 0.0002 ind; (3) the excess of 0.00005 in.’
would ensure adequate weld buildup and could be
removed by finish machining.

90

A series of specimens of the design shown in
Fig. 7.7 were welded with variations in arc current,
arc time, arc distance, and welding sequence,
Since precise control of these variables was re-
quired, cone-arc equipment was used throughout
the study. The welds were examined metallograph-
ically for penetration and flaws,

Examination of test specimens indicated that the
most favorable weld geometry could be achieved
by two separate inert-arc welding operations. The
projection was melted into a ‘‘rivet’’ by an initial
choice of arc current, orc time, and arc distance,
The arc distance was then reduced, and an addi«
tional application of current was used to form the
the finished weld, the filler metal being provided
by the rivet.

The rivet formed during the first operation by
using the optimum welding conditions is shown in
Fig. 7.8, which is a section through the weld joint
corresponding to section A-A in Fig. 7.7. The plug
weld formed in the second operation is shown in

 
Fig. 7.9. As may be noted, the penetration of the
type 304 stainless steel-clad sheet was complete
and reasonably uniform, which indicates that an
apparently sound weld joint was obtained. It thus
appears that inert-arc plug welding may be a feas-
ible method of fabrication of these assemblies,

pressures give an axial-to-tangential stress ratio
of Ye which results in minimum ductility; thus the
results probably represent the minimum life ex
pectancy, other factors being equal. In the near
future, these tube specimens will be tested with
the fuel inside the tube and sodium, instead of
argon, outside.

Environmental Effects on Creep of Inconel

Creep tests of Inconel specimens in nitrogen and
in sodium environments at 1500°F have recently
been completed. Thus it is now possible to coms
pare the effects of six types of environments that
Inconel structures might encounter. The results
of these creep tests are summarized in Table 7.3.

Table 7.3 shows that hydrogen is the most detri-
mental environment and that air is the most bene-
ficial, as far as rupture life is concerned, It is
interesting to note that, with the exception of the
tests in air and sodium, all the specimens reached
about the same total elongation regardless of the
rupture time, The increased ductility in air and in
sodium is probably the result of decarburization.
Chemical analyses are being made to test this
hypothesis. The results presented in Table 7.3
are for Inconel specimens that were annealed at

HIGH-CONDUCTIVITY METALS
FOR RADIATOR FINS

E. S., Bomar J. H. Coobs
H. Inouye, Metallurgy Division

The investigation of the fabrication of high
thermal-conductivity fins was confined during this
period to a study of diffusion barriers for use be-
tween Inconel and copper, the fabrication of clad-
copper fin material in sufficient quantities for the
assembly of experimental radiators, and the
investigation of speciol materials,
Diffusion Barriers

Barrier material for use between Inconel and
copper was selected on the basis of low solubility
of the element or alloy in copper or Inconel. In
addition, it was desired to fabricate thin composite
clads to determine their rolling characteristics.
The barrier materials used were tungsten, molybde-
num, titanium, zirconium, tantalum, vanadium,
types 310 and 446 stainless steel, and iron plus
silver,

Several composites were hot rolled approxi-
mately 50% at 1800°F and then finished cold to
0.008 in, total thickness. Bonding was not achieved
between molybdenum and Inconel or between va-
nadium and Inconel, and the following composites
could not be successfully rolled: (1) Inconel-Ag-
Fe-Cu-Fe-Ag-Inconel and (2) Inconel-W-Cu-W-
Inconel. The first of these composites was un-
successful because of improper design, and the
‘second showed severe stretcher marks, Oxidation
and diffusion tests of the other composites are
being made.

Some of the earlier tests of Inconel-clad copper
showed the absence of diffusion voids, and there-
fore a few tests are now being made to determine
the effect of surface preparation on void formation
and diffusion. The composites for this study have
been fabricated; they consist of a layer of oxide
on Inconel formed by heating in wet hydrogen and
in air at 1300°F.

Clad Copper

As reported previously,? types 310 and 446 stain-
less steel are suitable cladding material for copper
for use at 1500°F, while Inconel cladding causes
severe diffusion. In order to establish which of
the claddings is most suitable on copper and also
to determine the effect of diffusion on thermal con-
ductivity, approximately 15-ft? samples of copper
clod with Inconel, type 310 stainless steel, and
type 446 stainless steel have been or are being
made. The fin material is to be strips 4 in. wide
and 0.010 in. total thickness; the copper core will
be 0,006 in, thick and the cladding material will
be 0.002 in. thick. This material is to be used for
the fabrication of experimental heat exchangers.

Electroplated Copper

Plates of ‘chromium plus iron and of iron plus
nickel plus chromium to give compositions corre-
sponding to types 446 and 310 stainless steel,

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1953

respectively, did not protect copper from oxidizing
at 1500°F. A composite made entirely by electro-
forming showed the same results. The inability of
these plates to protect copper at 1500°F is ascribed
to the lack of a metallurgical bond between the
copper and the plate and to the brittleness of the
deposits. Although the ductility can be restored by
heating to 1600°F, the damaging cracks are
present in the as-received or annealed material,

Solid Phase Bonding

An colternate investigation for obtaining uniform
thin claddings is being made, A bond between the
copper and the cladding can be obtained by seam
welding material of the final desired thickness.
The Glen L, Martin Company proposed this method
and has supplied samples up to 4 in. long which
appear satisfoctory. Joint efforts have, to date,
produced claddings 0.002 and 0.001 in. thick.

The thermal properties of the aluminum bronzes
at low temperatures indicate that the conductivity
of alloys containing about 6% aluminum is greater
than that of the stainless steels or Inconel by a
factor of about 6 at 1500°F. To verify this, meas-
urements are now being made on 6 and 8% aluminum
bronzes, These alloys are oxidation resistant,
and if the expected thermal properties are correct,
the need to fabricate composite bodies will be
eliminated because these alloys may be suitable
for use as radiator fins. This is especiclly im-
portant because difficulties have been experienced
in obtaining clad material from commercial suppliers,

2350°F were employed to produce the tubing (or
rod), and, in some instances, extrusion ratios as
low as 10:1 were required, All the extruded tubing
has been sent to the Superior Tube Company for
further reduction. A molybdenum-nickel alloy (20%
Mo~80% Ni, nominal composition) did not extrude
at a reduction of 13:1 at 2350°F. An attempt will
be made to extrude this alloy at a lower reduction
ratio,

Rolling of Chromium-Cobalt Alloy

A chromium-cobalt alloy ingot 6 in. long and 1
in, in diameter (45% Cr—55% Co, nominal composi-
tion) was cast, and attempts to roll it at 2350°F
showed that this alloy was hot-short, Additions of
0.5% manganese and 0.5% aluminum did not im-
prove the hot-rolling properties. A solid rod of this
alloy which was precision cast was readily machin-
able, but it cracked severely, The present plans
call for precision casting the alloy tubing, The
hardness of the cast alloy is Rockwell C-50.

Rolling of Cobalt

A 1},-in.-dig, 6-in.~long cobalt ingot containing
0.5% manganese and 0.5% aluminum was success-
fully rolled to Y cin.-dia rod at 2800°F, Previously,
it was found that cobalt without the manganese
and aluminum additions was hot-short, The alloy
containing aluminum and manganese has an as-cast

hardness of Rockwell A-49,

Rolling of lron-Chremium-Nickel Alloy

A 1Y.in.~dia, 6-in.-long ingot of iron-chromium=
nickel alloy (45% Fe-40% Cr-15% Ni) was rolled
to Y-india rod at 2350°F. This allay was found
to he hot-short at 1850°F, even though it contained

94

1% of a nickel-manganese-titanium master alloy,
Previously, attempts to hot roll this alloy at 1850°F
without the alloy addition were unsuccessful be-
couse of hot-shortness. The as-cast alloy has a

hardness of Rockwell A-62,

Cold-Rolled Columbivm

Columbium sheet 0.200 in. thick obtained from
the Fansteel Corporation was annealed to a grain
size of ASTM 7 at 1100°C in a vacuum. The sheet
was cold rolled to 0.025 in., which represented a
reduction of 87.5% iin thickness. The room-temper-
ature mechanical properties were determined on
specimens vacuum annealed for Y, hr at various
temperatures and are summarized in Table 7.5,

The microstructure of columbium under these con-
ditions shows partial recrystallization at 1000°C,
and, at 1100°C, recrystallization is complete.
Vacuums of the order of 1075 mm Hg were obtained
in the annealing furnace. The analysis of the
sheet shows 0.75 + 0.3% tantalum, and traces of
copper, iron, and titanium. Analysis of the oxide
content of the sheet is not complete, but it is
expected to be greater than 0.3%.

TUBULAR FUEL ELEMENTS
J. H. Coobs, Metallurgy Division

Drawing of tubular fuel elements has been con-
tinved, Plans called for the reduction of six tubes
on each of two schedules in steps of 15% and 2%
reduction per pass, respectively, All tubes were
to be reduced from 0.750 in. in diameter with o
0,042-in. wall to a final size of 0.250 in. in diameter
with a 0.015-in. wall, or a total reduction of 87%.
Plug drawing was used in preference to drawing on a
mandrel, as explained previously. However, be-
cause of failure of the tubes at intermediate steps,
the drawing schedules could not be carried to com-
pletion. Reduction of the tubes was continued as
long as was considered practical, that is, until
each tube had failed within the core region or near
the starting end in such a way as to make further
drawing difficult or impossible. The final sizes
of the tubes processed on the 15% schedule are
given in Table 7.6, along with core composition
and total reduction.

Because the results with the 20% schedule were
discouraging, only three tubes were processed; all

41bid., p. 99.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1953

tubes failed on the second pass. Total reduction

of these tubes was 36%.

In general, the tubes reduced by both schedules
developed excellent finishes on both inner and
outer diameters, with no evidence of rippling or
folding in the core region. In most coses, failure
occurred near the trailing end of the core, The
failures were attributed mainly to inability to keep
the plugs positioned in the die properly, with the
result that the reductions did not conform strictly
to the schedule. The reductions were somewhat
higher than scheduled on several passes and
caused galling in the dies and failure of the tubes
because of severe tensile stresses, Samples have
been cut from the nine tubes drawn and are now
being examined metallographically,

Work continued on the development of a suitable,
viscous, high-temperature pump seal. Ten test
rings, 2), in. ID, 3% in, OD, 7%, in, thick, of a
beryllium fluoride glass® were prepared by melting
the glass batch in a platinum crucible and casting
the glass in graphite dies (Fig, 7.10). The rings
were cooled slowly in a blanket of glass wool to
minimize cracking, The finished rings were sent
to the Experimental Engineering Group for testing.

Further work is being done on the fabrication of
a ceramic container for use in the investigation of
the electrical resistivity of the fluoride fuels (cf.,

8. HEAT TRANSFER AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES RESEARCH

H. F. Poppendiek
Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The physical properties of a number of fluorides
and other materials of interest to aircraft reactor
technology have been measured. Preliminary
density and viscosity measurements have been
obtained for the ARE fuel concentrate over the
temperature range of 460 to 1000°C; the viscosity
varied from about 17.5 cp at 725°C to 9.9 cp at
975°C. The vapor pressure equations for two
NaF-ZrF , mixtures were determined. The thermal
conductivity of the solid fluoride mixture NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %) was deter-
mined to be 1.7 Btu/hrft'°F, while that of the

solid heat transfer salt NaNO -NaNO,;-KNO, -

(40-7-53 wt %) was only 0.6 Btu hr f+oF The
heat capacity of NaF-ZrF UF, (50-25-25 mole
%) was 0.17 cal/g-°C in the solid state and 0.27
cal/g'°C in the liquid state over the temperature
range of 610 tc 930°C, with a heat of fusion of
42 cal/g. The heat copacities of two special
samples of type 310 stainless steel and of G-E
No. 62 brazing alloy have also been measured.

Additional  forced-convection heat transfer
experiments with NaF-KF-LiF eutectic in a nickel
tube were made, and the data ‘obtained were found
to be in agreement with data from the former experi.
ments. No additional thermal resistance was
present and no film deposits on the inner surface
of the nickel tube were observed, in contrast to
the conditions found with this fluoride mixture in
Inconel.

Temperature and velocity measurements were
obtained in a glass thermal convection loop over
a Grashof modulus range from 2 x 104 to 67 x 104,
The experimental velocity data are compared with
predicted values which were obtained by the numeri-
cal solution of the laminar-flow heat-conduction
equation. The measured values diverge radically
from the theoretical values, undoubtedly because
of the turbulence which was introduced by the
radial temperature gradient and which was observed
at Reynolds numbers as low as 100.

Forced-taminar-flow volume-heat-source velocity
and temperature solutions have been derived for
the case in which the fluid viscosity is temperaiure
dependent. These solutions are functions of a
new dimensionless modulus which is a measure of

the importance of the viscosity variation of the
system.

Experimental apparatus is being assembled for
measurements of fluid flow in an annulus ond for
studies of transient surface-boiling phenomena.
The annulus flow will be determined by photo-
graphing dust particles; the essential photographic
technique is being developed. The boiling studies
will be conducted on a flat metal filament sus-
pended in water.

THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY OF

The thermal conductivities of solid fluorides have

the center of the sphere is used fo determine the
time-temperature curve as the sphere cools. Clas-
sical transient temperature solutions in terms of
the physical properties of the sphere are available
and may be usedto extract the thermal conductivity
of the sphere from the experimental time-tempera-

ture data, In this way the thermal conductivity of
the solid fluoride mixture NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-
43.5-44.5-1.1mole %) was found to be 1.7 Btu/hr ft?
(°F/ft), as compared with a value of 2 Btu/hr ft?
(°F /ft) for the same fluoride mixture in the liquid
state. The thermal conductivity of a solid heat
transfer salt (NaNO ,-NaNO,-KNO,; 40-7-53 wt %)
is also being determined by the transient cooling
method, Preliminary measurements indicate a
value of 0.6 Btu/hr ft2(°F/ft) over the temperature
range 80 to 170°F.

ELECTRICAL CONDUCTIVITY OF FLUORIDES
N. D. Greene

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

Preliminary electrical conductivity measurements
of NaF-ZrF , (50-50 mole %) and NoF-ZrF, (57-43
mole %) have been obtained for the temperature
range 1000 to 1800°F, For these measurements,
a thick-walled cylindrical tube of beryllium oxide
is mounted vertically in an open Inconel crucible
containing the molten fluoride. An electrode is
inserted through the tube, and the electrical path
is defined from the electrode just under the liquid
surface to the Inconel at the bottom of the crucible.
However, the beryllia tube was not sufficiently
long to prevent nonisothermal regions in the cell,
ond therefore accurate measurement of the salt
temperatures were difficult. A longer tube has
been ordered.

An attempt was also made to measure the con-
ductivity of NaF-KF-LiF by using the apparatus
described above, but this salt penetrated and
eroded the tube so badly that the data obtained
were deemed unreliable. A new cell in which
only platinum is in direct contact with the salt
has been designed and is now being constructed.
This cell will be used to measure the conducti-
vities of salts which are not compatible with

occurred as a result of the constituent materials

FORCED-CONVECTION HEAT TRANSFER
WiTH NoF.KF.LiF EUTECTIC

H. W. Hoffman J. Lones
Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

Additional data have been obtained for NaF-KF-
LiF eutectic (11.5-42.0-46.5 mole %) flowing through
a heated nicke! tube. The experimental results
are presented in Fig. 8.3 in terms of the Colburn
j-function. The previously reported results for
NaF-KF-LiF in beth nickel and Inconel tubes are

also shown.

In review, NaF-KF-LiF heat transfer data were
first obtained by using a nickel tube. The results
(shown by the inverted triongles in Fig. 83) indi-
cated that the anticipated heat transfer correlation
was followed. The experiment was then repeated
with the eutectic flowing through an Inconel tube,

and the data (circles in Fig. 8.3) were foundtolie
approximately 50% below the expected correlation.
The discrepancy was believed to be due to the
formation of a film of corrosion products at the
fluid-metal interface. The heat transfer results
ond the existence of the film were both definitely
verified for NaF-KF-Lif in Inconel tubes
subsequent experiment (squares in Fig. 8.3). The
film was analyzed and found to be K,CrF , plus a
small amount of Li CrF ..

The data reported at this time were obtained to
establish the validity of the original results for
NaF-KF-LiF in nicke! tubes. The results (normal
triangles in Fig. 8.3) are essentially in agreement
with those for nicke! tube No. 1; visual observation
of the tube showed no film. The experiment was
terminated because of fatigue failure of the nicke!
tube at the high operating temperatures used.

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

Thermal-convection loops have been used for
observing the nature of flow of ordinary fluids and
to determine the accuracy and range of usefulness
of an analytical method for predicting the mean
velocity, or Reynolds modulus, from wall tempera-
ture measurements. A discussion of the velocity
measurements and flow observations was given in
a previous report.’ Additional velocity and wall
temperature data have been taken, fluid temperature
traverses have been made, the analytical analyses
have been completed, and a report of the results
is being prepared.”

Measurements of temperature and velocity were
taken for five specific conditions over the range
of Grashof modulus from 2 x 10% to 67 x 104. The
corresponding variation of Reynolds modulus was
from 50 to 270. The Grashof and Reynolds moduli

are, respectively,

viscosity of the liquid, 8 is the thermal coefficient
of expansion of the liquid, g is the acceleration
of gravity, u

ture.

is the mean fluid velocity, and

The flow and heat transfer observed in these
experiments were characteristic of free convection
rather than forced convection, and thus the signifi-
cant parameter which dictates the character of the
flow is the Grashof modulus rather than the Reynolds
modulus.

At Reynolds moduli of up to about 100, the flow
was essentially laminar. Above this value, the
Grashof modulus was supercritical, and the flow
was laminar over part of the circuit ond turbulent

in other parts. As the Grashof modulus {and thus
Reynolds modulus) was increased, the length of the
circuit in laminar flow decreased. In addition,
when the Grashof modulus. was high, the radial
temperature gradient was sufficient fo cause vigor-
ous secondary flow cells in the laminar part of the
circuit,

The method for predicting the Reynolds modulus
from wall temperature measurements employed the
numerical solution of the laminar flow equation for
heat conduction. The problem was solved on the

ORNL high-speed computer, the ORACLE,

In Fig. 8.4, the predicted and measured values
of Reynolds moduli are compared. For the first
two sets of data, for which the flow was essentially
laminar, the correlation is no worse than 30%; for
Reynolds moduli greater than 100, the flow was
observed to be partly turbulent, and a laminar flow
solution is obviously not applicable. The predic-
tion is satisfactory for the laminar flow regime, but
a similar prediction for the turbulent flow regime
cannot be made because the turbulent diffusivity is
not known for this type of turbulent flow.

FLUID FLOW IN AN ANNULUS

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The experiment to be used for measuring fluid
velocity profiles in annulus systems was described
previously.® In essence, the method consists of
photographing dust particles which are entrained
in air flowing in an annulus. Most of the recent
effort on this research was devoted to photographic
experimentation to develop a procedure for photo-
graphing the grid system and the dust particles
with the light available from a single flash of a
Strobolume. This has been accomplished.

The problem stemmed from the fact that colimating

TRANSIENT SURFACE-BOILING STUDIES

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

In the event ou water-cooled reactor suddenly

102

tion of a certain volume of steam would be of im-
portance, Of primary interest would be the effect
of generation of heat at rates increasing exponen-
tially with time in vertical plates {such as the fuel
plates of an MTR-iype reactor) submerged in water
that was initially at below the boiling point.

To obtain information on this phenomenon, an
experimental study of heat transfer to water under
transient conditions has been undertoken. The
basic experimental system is a flat metal filament
positioned vertically in a tank of water with heat
generated electrically in the filament, The research
program consists of two phases: a study involving
exponential generation of heat, which will be
started when the necessary electrical equipment
has been developed, and a preliminary genera!
study of boiling from a vertical filament, which
will begin immediately.

Arrangements have been made for the Instrumenta-
tion and Controls Division to develop and construct
equipment to regulate the flow of current in the
filament and to produce an exponential heating
curve. Thisequipment will also measure and record
instantaneous values of the variables of interest,
The filament and the adjacent water will be photo-

(Reynolds number of 600 or less), the effect of the

solution for the case of fluid flow between parallel
plates and annular spaces with volume heat sources
in the fluids is being evaluated, This solufion
will be useful in estimating fluid temperature
distributions in reactor systems such as the
reflector-moderated reactor.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1953

Forced-laminar-flow volume-heat-source velocity
and temperature solutions have been derived for
the case in which the fluid viscosity is temperature
dependent. A simple, algebraic viscosity-tem-
perature expression which closely approximates
experimental viscosity data was substituted into
the hydrodynamic equation. A power series with
unknown coefficients was substituted into the
heat transfer equation, and two integrations were
carried out. The resulting temperature solution
was then substituted into the hydrodynamic
equation, and an integration: was carried out. The
coefficients of the resulting power series velocity
solution were determined by relating them to the
initially proposed velocity power series ond the
integral equation describing the mean fluid velocity.
The resulting velocity and temperature solutions
are functions of a new dimensionless modulus, as
well as radial position, This dimensionless
modulus is a measure of the importance of the
viscosity variation in the flow system.

Inconel capsules containing the fluoride fuel
NaF-ZrF -UF , were irradiated in the LITR ond in
the MTR. Examination of the capsule walls showed
a tendency toward intergranular corrosion that does
not occur in unirradiated static tests. The data on
depth of penetration showed considerable scatter,
and therefore no correlation with power production
rate and exposure time could be made. Design and

Inconel! capsules containing various compositions
of the fluoride fuel system, NaF-ZrF UF, have
been irradiated in both the Low_Infensity Test
Reactor (LITR) and in the Materials Testing Re-

actor (MTR). These tests have included irradiation
times of from 53 to BOO hr with power production
from the 230 watts/cm3 with a 4 mole % UF, fuel
in the LITR to the 8000 watts/cm® with a 12 mole
% UF, fuel in the MTR. In general, Inconel sur.
faces show more tendency toward intergranular
corrosion when in contact with irradiated fuel than
they do in out-ofepile tests. However, the data so
far available indicate no definite trend in corrosion
penefration either as a function of rate of power
production in the fuel or of irradiation time.

Six Inconel specimens containing the fluoride
mixture NaF.ZrF UF, (50-46-4 mole %) which
were irradiated in the LITR for 53, 140, 270, 565,
685, and 810 hr each are shown in Fig. 9,1. In
each case, the power dissipation in the fluoride
was 230 watts/em3. Qut-of-pile control capsules
for this series of tests are shown in Fig. 9.2.

which was contacted for 575 hr in the MTR with
fuel producing power at a rate of the order 8000

tration and is similar to the sample shown in
Fig. 9.1, which was exposed at only 230 watts/cm3.
In a few samples in which the Inconel! had a very
large grain size, occasional penetration to a depth
of 12 mils has been observed. This phenomenon
appears to be fairly independent of power density
or time of irradiation, and, as with the other effects
observed, there is no certainty as to how much of
the effect is due to radiation.

In confirmation of the analytical werk reported
previously, petrographic examinations of irradiated
fuels showed no decomposition or segregation of
the fuel as a result of irradiation.

C. D. Susano, Analytical Chemistry Division

J. M. Warde, Metallurgy Division

R. Baldock, Stable isotope Research and Production Division

Developmental work was mainly concerned with
the investigation of methods for the determination
of the oxidation states of the constituents and the
metallic corrosion products in fluoride fuel mix-
tures and fuel solvents. Divalent iron fluoride was
leached from samples of fluoride mixtures with 0.1
M H,50,, and the iron was determined as the o-
phenanthroline complex. Divalent chromium fluoride
was found to be complexed by 0.17 M (NH 1,60,
and could be distinguished from trivalent chromium
fluoride, which is readily complexed with a dilute
solution of disedium dihydrogen ethylenediamine-
tetraacetate (EDTA) at pH 4,0.

Studies were continued on the use of ammonium
oxalate for the determination of traces of UF, in the
presence of UF ,. A separation based on solubility
difference is possible but not for low concen-
trations of UF,. The absorption spectra of so-
lutions of UF, in EDTA and HCI were determined.

The effectiveness of solutions of ammonium
oxalate, oxalic acid, and acetic acid as solvents for
removing fluoride fuels, which contain zirconium,
from metallic thermal convection loops was in
vestigated. Ammonium oxalate proved the most
effective solvent tested; however, it was not con-
sidered so satisfactory as the nitric and boric acid
mixtures which are currently used.

Petrographic examinations were made of irradiated
samples of fluoride fuel mixtures. No difference
was noted under the petrographic microscope be-
tween the irradiated specimens and the comparable
control samples.

The mass spectrometer method for quantitative
analysis of the uranium content of irradiated fluoride
fuel mixtures has recently been extended for use as
a measure of uranium burnup during irradiation. A
procedure has been developed for calculating the
percentage of uranium by weight in both the un-
irradiated and the irradiated conditions. Hence, the
loss in uranium content can be determined to the
accuracy that the isotope abundances are known in
the original material. The portion of this total
uranium loss that is due to burnup is then determined
by mathematical analysis.

The activities of the Analytical Service Laboratory
have increased markedly during the past quarter.
A total of 1,378 samples was received as compared
with 878 for the previous quarter, and 1,201 samples
involving a total of 11,034 determinations were
reported.

ANALYTICAL CHEMISTRY OF REACTOR
MATERIALS

J. C. White
Analytical Chemistry Division

The developmental work during this quarter con-
sisted almost entirely of a search for methods for
determining the oxidation states of the constituents
and the metallic corrosion products in ARE fuels
and fuel solvents. Three phases of the problem are
currently being studied: the determination of the
oxidation states of iron in fuel solvent and in the
fuel; the deterinination of the oxidation states of
chromium in similar media; and the determination
of the oxidation states of uranium in the fuel. The
ultimate aim of these investigations is the determi-
nation of each specie in the presence of the other
species. The reducing power of specially prepared
NaZrF. with zirconium additive was also de-
termined. The effectiveness of certain solvents
for dissolving proposed fuels from the walls of
metal containers was investigated. No additional
work was conducted on the determination of metallic
oxides in reactor fuels because of the urgency of
other problems.

Oxidation States of [ron

P. V. Hoffman
Analytical Chemistry Division

A number of samples of the fuel mixture NaF-
ZF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %) and iron (5 wt %) were
heated and filtered. Divalent, trivalent, and. total
iron contents were determined, in addition to
uranium irifluoride. The finely divided samples
were leached with 0.1 M H,50, on the steam bath
for 1 hr to remove iron. Ferrous iron in the filtrate

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

from the leach was determined with o-phenanthro-
ling;! iron was determined in the leach filtrate by
first reducing the iron present with hydroquinone
and then determining it as the o-phenanthroline
complex. In order to test the efficiency of the
leaching process, a separate sample was dissolved,
and the iron was then determined by the o-phen-
anthroline method.

The results, with a relative standard error of 10%,
show that a single acid leach is sufficient to leach
iron quantitatively from the fuel mixture. Further
evaluation of the dato shows that only ao small
fraction of the added iron reacts with the fuel ond
passes in solution through the filter. The oxidation
state of this iron is predominantly, if not com-
pletely, bivalent. {t should be recognized, however,
that if FeF_ and UF, exist as such in the mixture,
reduction of trivalent iron to the bivalent state
undoubtedly occurs on contact with sulfuric acid.
The absence of UF, was indicated by the hydrogen
evolution method.?2” However, this method is not
sufficiently sensitive to determine the probable
small concentration of UF, which may be present
in these samples. The need for 0 sensitive method
for determining UF, in reactor fuels is evident.

Oxidation States of Chromium

Work has continued on the determination of the
oxidation states of chromium following its reaction

It has besn shown that chromium trifluoride can
be separated from chromium metal by leaching with
an acetate-buffered solution (pH, 4.0) of disodium
dihydrogen ethylenediaminetetraacetate (EDTA).
Chromium metal is insoluble in this medium. Several
samples were leached with EDTA at 60 to 70°C for
3 hr to determine the extent of reduction of Cr to
metallic chromium during the heating period. No
residues indicative of metallic chromium were

is either not reduced to metallic chromium or that
the metal obtained is in such a finely divided and
reactive state that it dissolves in the leach seo-
lution. However, previous tests would indicate
incomplete reduction, probably to divalent chromium
fluoride.

Since EDTA solutions complex both di- and tri-
valent chromium, other complexing agents were
studied to distinguish between CrF, and GiF,.
Preliminary experiments have indicated that a 0.17
M (2.5%) solution of ammonium oxalate will readily
dissolve CrF_ at the refluxing temperature, and a
purple complex will form. Metallic chromium,
CrF,, and Cr o, appear to be insoluble, and they
show no tendency to form complexes. The ab-
sorption spectrum of the complex formed by divalent
chromium fluoride and ammonium oxalate is identical
with that of the complex formed by the reaction
between trivalent chromium chloride and ammonium
oxalate. Further investigation of the nature of this
complex is under way.

The work on the determination of the oxidation
states of chromium in reactor fuels has shown that
(1) divalent chromium fluoride can apparently be
selectively leached with 0.17 M ammonium oxalate,
(2) divalent and trivalent chromium fluoride can be
leached simultaneously with EDTA, and (3) the
metal and the trivalent oxide are not attacked by
either of these solvents.

Determination of UF, ond UF,

W. J. Ross
Analytical Chemistry Division

Work on the development of a method for the de-
termination of UF; and UF, in NoZrF has been
continued, and the more complete studies show, cs
reporfed previously, that EDTA dissolves UF, but
apparently has little effect on UF,. The effects
of temperature and the concentration and acidity of
EDTA on the reaction between UF, and EDTA
were investigated. Concentration of the reagent
was not critical over the range 0.08 to 0.15 M; a
concentration of 0.1 M was used in most of the
tests. Solutions of EDTA with acid concentiations
of pH 4 were not appreciably more effective in
dissolving UF, than those with acid concentrations
approaching a pH of 7. Use of solutions less acidic
than pH 7resulted in hydrolysis of uranium. Temper
ature was the most critical condition. The rate of
reaction at 100°C was approximately ten times that
at 25°C; however, the data obtained at 25°C were
not reproducible because of variations in particle
size.

Under various conditions of temperature and
acidity, the absorption spectra of UF ,-EDTA are
essentially identical with those for UF, dissolved
in HCl, except that the spectra for the VF, EDTA
systems are shifted by approximately 20 my toward
the infrared by the presence of EDTA. The maxi-
mum molar extinction coefficients for the four
spectra shown are nearly equivalent; they range
from 35.7 for UF -HCI to 25.0 for UF -EDTA at a
pH of 6.8 anda temperature of 100°C.

Petrographic and chemical analyses of the three
batches of UF, used for the study of solubility in
0.1 M EDTA showed UF, contents of 92.4, 90.4,
and 90.7%, respectively. Samples of these batches
were treated with 0.2 M ammonium oxalate at reflux
temperature and filtered, and petrographic exami-
nation revealed that the residues were essentially
free from UF ,. The data indicate that during the
firsthour of reflux the greater portion of UF , present
is removed but that quantitative separation is
questionable. The solubility of UF, in ammonium
oxalate is low; however, UF, may oxidize slowly
upon contact with this solvent, as indicated by the
appreciable concentration of uranium in the solution
when allowed to stand overnight. The UF, content
of the sample which had been treated with oxalate
is being determined and is expected to be near
100%.

On the basis of the data obtained thus far, UF,
and UF, can be separated by ammonium oxalates
However, the method is not sufficiently precise for
the separation of traces of UF, from UF. Similar
tests are under way to determine the feasibility of

using 0.1 M EDTA for separating UF.

Reducing Power of NaZF with Zirconium Addition

The total reducing power of NaZrF, specially
prepared by treatment with metallic zirconium was
determined. In the hydrogen evolution method? used
for this determination, the sample is treated with
0.2 M HF to liberate the hydrogen which is formed

by the reaction between zirconium and hydrofluoric

reducing power is calculated. Essentially no re-
ducing power was observed in these samples. A
second method which involved complete dissolution
of the sample in standard ceric sulfate solution in
OM H,S0, and back-titration with standard ferrous
sulfate solution was used to confirm the results.
Further tests by the hydrogen evolution method on
synthetic samples of NaZrF, and zirconium demon-
strated that the method is quantitative.

Dissolution of Fluoride Mixtures
Containing Zirconium

P. V. Hoffman
Analytical Chemistry Division

Nitric and boric acid mixtures have been used
successfully as solvents for fluoride mixtures, but,
in an effort to find a less-corrosive solvent, small-
sized lumps of NaF-ZrF 4 UF, {50-46-4 mole %)
were contacted with various concentrations of
ammonium oxalate, oxalic acid, and acetic acid at
70 to 80°C for various periods of time. The optimum
concentration of ammonium oxalate was 1 M, which
is approximately a saturated solution at 50°C.
(One hundred ml of T M (NH, A C, 0, MH ,0 will
dissolve 1 g of small lumps of fuel in Spproximately
2 hr.] A 2 M solution was the most effective
oxalic acid concentration and was approximately
equivalent to 1 M ammonium oxalate in dissolution
effectiveness. The optimum acetic acid concen-
tration was 0.2 M, which yielded only 50% of the
solubility strength of the oxalates. A comparison
of the effectiveness of the three reagents tested is
shown in Fig. 10.1. The rate of dissolution with
1 M ammonium oxalate is greater than the rate with
2 M oxalic acid, although their effectiveness is
nearly equivalent. Ammonium oxalate (1.0 M),
because of its higher pH (6.5), is to be preferred
over 2 M oxalic acid (pH 0.7), however, with respect
to possible corrosiveness. Nene of these solvents
are suitable, however, for dissolving large-sized
lumps of NaF-ZrF -UF,

from metallic containers.

samples were examined at the same time. These
fuels are normally composed of NaZr(U)F, which
is green, and perhaps a very small amount ofa lower
refractive index complex, which is designated E-2.
The irradiated samples were normal, except that

 

the NaZr(U)F, had a slightly low refractive index
and was slightly reduced. There were no differences
between the control samples and the irradiated
samples which could be observed with a petrographic
microscope.

MASS SPECTROMETER INVESTIGATIONS OF
IRRADIATED FLUORIDE FUELS

C. R. Baldock

Stable Isotope Research and Production Division

The mass spectrometer has been successfully
employed in the quantitative analysis of the uranium
content of irradiated fluoride fuel mixtures. Initially,
the mass spectrometer method was used to test the
validity of chemical analyses, but it was recognized
that the method could be extended to obtain an
accurate measure of fuel burnup. In addition, by
using accepted values of cross sections, an average
value of the flux in which the fuel has been ire
radiated can be determined. This gives an in-
dependent check of values predicted from other
types of measurements and of the internal con-
sistency of the calculations. The isotope dilution
method as applied to the analysis of irradiated fuel
has been used extensively with a routine accuracy
of £1%, which is not the ultimate limit of accuracy.

Calculation of UF, in Unirradioted Fuels

For the calculation of the percentage of UF,
(by weight) in unirradiated fluoride fuel samples of
known isotopic composition, the exact values for
the isotopic masses are used to compute the atomic
weight of the uranium in the fuel:

(1) At.wt = 235024, + 234.124,,,
+ 238.12 Aji ’

where A_ denotes abundance of uranium isotope of
mass number 7. The ratio, R, of U235 to U?38 is
obtained from the mass spectrometer measurement,
and since the atoms of U235 and U238 are obtained
from both the uranium in the fuel and the natural
U;0, spike materia! added,

(atoms of U235 from fuel) + (atoms of U235 from spike)

(2) R =

 

(atoms of U238 from fuel) + (atoms of U238 from spike)

Equation 6 gives only the total percentage of U23%

to several factors, including burnup, radiation
damage, and replacement of chromium leached from
the Inconel walls, A graphical method has been
developed to test this loss to determine whether it
canbe completely ascribed to the capture of neutrons
to produce fission products and U?23¢, that is, to
burnup.

The solution of the differential equation for the
first-order rate expression for burnup is found to be

If a plot is made of Eg. 11, which might be called

used to check the product of the three constants
ay, Qy and ¢. Or, if the (a; * a,) values are
assumed to be correct, Eq. 11 can be used as a
check on ¢, the average flux density.

The values of a, = 580 barns and a, = 105 barns
are rather well established. The value of ¢ =
2.17 x 10 n/cm2.sec has been tentatively chosen
because it gives the best fit to the data based on
samples from four test capsules and it is consistent
with values determined by other means.

SUMMARY OF SERVICE CHEMICAL ANALYSES

J. C. White A. F. Roemer

Analytical Chemistry Division

Sixty-four samples of UF and ten samples of
Na UF, (the ARE fuel concentrate) have been
analyzed to date. The UF, samples were analyzed
for uranium only, but complete analyses were made
of the fuel concentrates, including determinations

TABLE 10.1.

of iron, nickel, and chromium. The cooperative
program with the {.aboratory Division of Y-12 was
continued on the determination of uranium, as
described in the previous report. The relative
difference between laboratories on the determi-
nation of uranium in the fue! concentrate was
0.04%, and the difference on the UF, analyses was
0.18%. The larger difference was ottributed mainly
to the heterogeneity of the samples of UF ,, which
contained block particles and comparatively large
hard pieces ofa lighter hue than that of the powdered
salt; the large pieces were probably Uo, F,.
Uranium metal that was considered to be 99.94%
pure was used as the standard, The relative
standard error of 12 samples at a 95% confidence
level was 0.02%.

Some specimens of Inconel metal used in corrosion
tests were analyzed for uranium, zirconium, sodium,
and fluoride and the major constituents nickel, iron,
and chromium. Traces of sodium carbonate in the
range of 0,05% and less in sodium hydroxide were
determined,

The major portion of the work wos concerned with
the analysis of fluoride fuel mixtures. A decided
increase occurred in the number of samples received
during the quarter. A total of 1,378 samples was
received, 1,201 were reported, and 11,034 determi-
nations were made {Table 10.1).

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

E. P. Blizard, Physics Division

The spectra of gamma rays and of fast neutrons
from the Bulk Shielding Reactor were measured
(sec. 11). The neutron spectrometer was altered
for this work to improve the sensitivity at some
sacrifice in energy resolution; however, thicker
water shields can now be studied. The gamma-ray
spectrum of the Bulk Shielding Reactor without a
shield showed the usual broad peaks at 2.2 Mev
that are due to water capture and those at 7 to 8
Mev that are due to capture in aluminum and possi-
bly other materials. The fast-neutron leakage
spectra of the BSR were obtained from proton-recoil
measurements for the water-reflected reactor load-
ing No. 22. Data obtained with the nuclear plate
camera have been used to extend the spectrometer
data from 1.3 Mev down to 0.5 Mev. A measure-
ment of the angular distribution of fast neutrons in
water was also made. At neutron energies above
8 Mev, the intensities at various angles converge.

The Lid Tank Facility was used for studying the
slant penetration of fission neutrons in a hydro-
genous shield (sec. 12). This problem is encoun-
tered in specifying a crew-shield side-wall thick-
ness. The uncertainty lay in the importance of the
short circuiting of the shield by scattering into
paths more nearly normal to the shield surfaces.
For the shield thicknesses which have been meas-
ured, it appears thot this short circuiting is un-
important, and the attenuation is characteristic of
the slant thickness. This is not unexpected for
the thin shields (< 7.5 em) which have been meas-
ured to date, There is as yet nothing conclusive
about the behavior of very thick shields with
slant-incidence radiation, but it will be advan-
tageous if the slant thickness gives the attenuation
for the thicker shields.

The Lid Tank Facility was also used for air duct
experiments designed to give some insight into the
interaction between parallel ducts (sec. 12). Data
from three sources, (1) a duct consisting of three
sections, 22 in. long and 31% in. in diameter,
joined at angles of 45 deg, (2) a second duct con-
sisting of two such sections, and (3) the slant
penetration experiments, were put into the Simon-
Clifford formula, and the formula was solved for
the reflection factor. The values obtained were
in agreement with those obtained from previous
thermal measurements and thus constituted an
important confirmation of those measurements. It
is now felt that engineering designs based on the

Simon-Clifford theory are on a sound basis when
applied to a single duct, especially when the di-
mensions are similar to those studied. Since it
was observed that the peak values of dose meas-
ured at the end of the 19-duct array were a foctor
of approximately 10 higher than those observed
with the single duct, a study of interference be-
tween adjacent ducts has been started. Tests are
planned to give more quantitative information on
the interaction between neighboring ducts and
possibly to improve the formula for streaming
through ducts.

The effective removal cross section work for
which the Lid Tank Facility is used was con-
tinued, and old experiments have been reviewed.
A new set of values is reported (sec. 12).

A summary of the first 50. Lid Tank experiments
is being prepared (sec. 12). The summary will be
because of the large role the Lid Tank
Facility has had in the development of various

useful

reactor shield designs and because of the constant
need for reference to the data.

The steel structure of the Tower Shielding Fa-
cility has been erected, and the ground structures
are approximately 75% complete (sec. 13), The
optimistic date for completion of the facility is
January 15.

Some basic shielding research which is not re-
ported here because it is supported by another
activity is, nevertheless, of vital interest to ANP,
The development of a scintillating fast-neutron
spectrometer has received considerable impetus
recently with the growth of a few clear europium-
activated lithium iodide crystals. These crystals
have been tested on the ORNL Van de Graaff
generator and show encouraging energy sensitivity,
but an anomalous lack of energy resolution indi-
cates that the development is for from complete.
Most of the theoretical shielding work has been
reported in the Physics Division Semiannual Re-
port with the exception of a few problems which
originated in the experimental program (sec. 14).
An unusual calculation has been made of the vis
ible light to be expected from divided-shield
aircraft. An estimate of the neutron reflection
coefficient for water was obtained by using a
simple model with a coincident source and a
located above the water

nondirectional receiver

surface.

During this quarter, the main effort at the Bulk
Shielding Facility was directed toward obtaining
neutron and gamma-ray spectroscopic data, The
gamma-ray leakage spectrum of the Bulk Shielding
Reactor has been meosured becouse it is typical
of the spectrum of gamma radiation incident upon
a shield.

ln addition, considerable fost-neutron spectral
data were obtained on the present loading for the
water-moderated reactor. The measurement of the
energy spectrum of neutrons attenuated by various
thicknesses of water was repeated and extended
to a 50-cm distance from the face of the reactor.
A measurement of the angular distribution of fast
neutrons in water has been made, and the attenuated
neutron spectrum through o shield mockup was
measured,

SPECTRUM OF GAMMA RAYS
EMITTED BY THE BSR!

Results of measurements of the gamma-ray energy
spectra and angular distributions through lead and
water were published previously.? In the following,
the results of measurements of the gamma-ray
spectrum of the Bulk Shielding Reactor without a
shield are presented. These measurements may
be considered as an extension of the earlier work.

The measurement of the spectrum from the un-
shielded reactor was necessarily delayed until the
BSR was loaded with ‘‘cold’’ fuel elements, that
is, elements which had not been used when the
reactor power was higher than 3 watts. The low
power level of the reactor wos dictated by the
counting-rate limitation of the spectrometer. With

the reactor ‘‘hot,’’ the power level from fission-
product activity alone would have been too great.

For this particular experiment, a & by 5 fuel
element arrangement was used in an unreflected
reactor. The total power and the power distribution
were determined with gold foils in the wusudl
manner.

Spectrometer Arrangement. One end of on air-
filled aluminum tube was placed ogainst the face
of the reactor, and the tube extended to the three-
crystal gamma-ray spectrometer’ (Fig. 11.1). For
the first run, the air tube was only 5 in. long ond
was surrounded by a 5-in. thickness of lead which
shielded the spectrometer proper from gamma roadie
tion from other parts of the reactor. The results
of this run showed that the neutron-induced back-
ground was so high as to moke a meaningful in-
terpretation of the data impractical.

In a second run, o 40-in. air column surrounded
by water, except for the 5-in. thickness of lead at
the end next to the spectrometer, served as a
collimator. The additional water shielding reduced
the neutron level sufficiently for the neutron-induced
background to be negligibly small. The total back-
ground was measured by plugging the collimator
within the spectrometer with lead. It was also
found that the background from reactor fission
products was small,

Results. The absolute photon {gomma-ray) flux
obtained is plotted as a function of photon energy
in Fig. 11.2. The flux values were determined
from the known sensitivity of the spectrometer?
and from the solid angle defined by the collimator
shown in Fig. 11.1. Since the water surrounding
the aluminum tube was not very effective in pre
venting gamma rays from entering the sides of the
air column, the spectrum shown in Fig. 11.2 is too
large by a small fraction, perhaps 20%.

well be due to gamma rays from the 0,478-Mev level

ing at a U23% slug in the center of the Los Alamos

smooth out any structure present. The general
similarity in slopes, however, is interesting.

for the spectrum at the face of the reactor, the

out through the water to a position 113 cm from the

was not sufficiently sensitive to detect neutrons
at 113 em; however, a spectral measurement was
made at 70 cm, but the statistics (Fig. 11.5) were
rather poor.

Tentative results of a preliminary experiment
performed at the Lid Tank indicate that most of the
air-scattered neutrons that penetrate an aircraft
crew shield follow the slant path. In another
experiment, the study of neutron streaming through
air ducts was resumed; data from the initial experi-
ments have presented an imporiant confirmation of
the Simon-Clifford theory. A re-evaluation of all
measurements for the determination of removal cross
sections has improved some of the values. Refer-
ence to Lid Tank neutron and gamma data is facili-
tated by a recent survey of the first 50 experiments.

Approval has been received for the use of enriched
vranium for a new Lid Tank source plate, and a
design has beendeveloped which will make possible
a far more accurate power calibration. The source
plate, as well as its appurtenant power-measuring
equipment, is at present being constructed in the
ORNL Research Shops. It is planned to install the
source plate in January.

SLANT PENETRATION OF NEUTRONS
THROUGH WATER

A preliminary experiment has been performed to
determine the slant penetration of fission neutrons
through water. An air-filled aluminum duct, 40 in.
long and 2 in. in diameter, was used as a collimated
“point”’ source of fast neutrons, and the fast-
neutron dose was determined in the water around
the end. The duct was tilted from the normal to the
source plate to reduce background of fast neutrons
from the ORNL Graphite Reactor. Since the fast
neutrons are coliimated in the outward direction, if
not reduced they would overshadow the fission-plate
neutrons which are, of course, isotropic. The data,
plotted as isodoses around the duct, are shown in
Fig. 12.1.

By integrating the dose along planes through the
radiation field, the dose penetrating different
thicknesses of water at various angles was de-
termined (Fig. 12.2). This information must be
regarded as tentative until the dose determinations

120

have been repeated with more care, but the results
obtained so far indicate that most of the dose comes
from neutrons that penetrate the shield along the
slant path. This indication is similar to that
obtained for gamma rays for comparable attenu-
ations. !

The observed relaxation lengths range from 4.9
to 6.3 cm. As would be expected, these values are
smaller than those obtained with thick shields,
since a fission spectrum was used as a source and
the shields were quite thin.

To determine the total air-scattered dose in a
divided shield, it is necessary to integrate over
all angles. Such an integration would presumably
give a straight-through relaxation length comparable
to that observed in the BSR air-scattering experi-
ment.2 It would be desirable to extend the measure-
ments to greater thicknesses of water and to harden
the spectrum by putting water between the source
and the duct entrance. Intensity problems limit the
extent to which this can be accomplished, however.

AIR DUCT TESTS

The use of the Lid Tank Facility for the study of
neutron streaming through air ducts has been
resumed with emphasis on fast-neutron measure-
ments. A flow-type dosimeter with somewhat
greater sensitivity than that available heretofore
was used to determine the dose around the ends of
several ducts. One of these ducts was taken from

24. E. Hungerford, The Skyshine Experiments at the
Bulk Shielding Facility, ORNL-1611 (to be published).

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1953

the 19-duct array studied a year ago.? It had three
sections, 22 in. long and 31%
joined at angles of 45 degrees. A second duct
consisted of two such sections. The slant pene-
tration experiment described in the preceding sub-
section provided a third measurement.

Putting the data from these three measurements
into the Simon-Clifford formula* and solving for the
reflection factor, a, gave values of 1.0 and 0.9,
respectively, for the first and second bends. These
values are in agreement with the value of about 1
obtained from the previous thermal measurements?
made in water at a distance of 30 ¢m from the ends
of the ducts (thus the emergent flux was filtered and
was representative of the hard neutrons that de-
termine the dose), and they constitute an important
confirmation of those measurements. The value of
1 has been assumed in recent direct-cycle design
studies. It is now felt that engineering designs
based on the Simon-Clifford theory are on a sound
basis when applied to a single duct, especially
when the dimensions are similar to those studied.

Since it was observed that the peak values of
dose measured at the end of the 19-duct array were
a factor of approximately 10 higher than those ob-
served with the single duct, a study of interference
between adjacent ducts was indicated. This study
has been started, with « ‘single section and o
three-section duct being used. In the first con-
figuration, one of the possible streaming paths was
reproduced - in the array by placing the short duct
parallel to the first section of the long duct and
12}, in. from it. In this position, it lined up,
approximately, with the last section. The result
was an increase by a factor of 4.5 in the dose at
the end of the long duct.

The short duct was then moved to a position that
was again parallel to the first section but. con-
siderably closer (6 in.) and above it in a different
plane so that there was no direct streaming path.
The dota (which must be considered tentative)
showed no increase in the peak dose beyond the
long duct but did show a broadening of the emergent
neutron beam. The results obtained from these
experiments are shown in Fig. 12.3.

Further tests are planned to give more quantitative

streaming through ducts.

REMOVAL CROSS SECTIONS

The measurement of the effective fast-neutron
removal cross section of CF, has been repeated
with the use of 15 in. of the liquid instead of 28
in. as in the previous measurement.’ Despite this
large difference in thickness, the measured values
of the molecular removal cross section agreed to
within 5%, which is within the experimental error,
and thus they provide an interesting check on the
validity of the geometrical corrections that were
made. The revised value for carbon, 0.80 barn/atom
instead of 0,84 barn/atom, when used with the

section of 1,31 barns/atom for fluorine as compared
with the value of 1,36 barns/atom reported in the
previous report.

A re-examination of all the Lid Tank measurements
for the determination of removal cross sections has
improved some of the values. A summary of the
presently accepted values obtained from direct
measurements is given in Table 12.1. Additional

SURVEY OF LID TANK EXPERIMENTS

Shielding experimentation at the ORNL Lid Tank
Facility began in June 1949, and since that time
approximately 60 major experiments have been
performed. In view of the large role this facility has
had in the developmeni of various reactor shield
designs and because of the constant need for
reference to the data, it was felt that the experi-
mental results should be compiled in cone publication.
Accordingly, o summary of the first 50 Lid Tank
experiments ‘will soon be presented by E. L.
Czapek.”8

As described in several previous reports, the Lid
Tank Facility consists of a large water tank
adjacent to an opening in the concrete shield of the

ORNL Graphite Reactor (Fig. 12.4). A converter
plate of uranium covers the opening between the
water tank and the reactor shield. This plate
absorbs most of the incident thermal neutrons
emerging from the reactor and causes fission, which,
in turn, produces the known uranium spectrum of
neutrons, as well as gamma rays of various energies.
Shielding samples are inserted in the tank, and the
transmitted radiation is measured behind the shield.
The geometry of the Lid Tank permits the use of
very large samples, which, in turn, help to reduce
uncertainties due to boundary conditions. The water
in the tank protects personnel from radiation and
allows easy positioning of test samples.

The Lid Tank Facility was built to test both
compositions and geometries of shields. With the
resulting experimental data, difficult attenuation
problems could be quickly solved and shield thick~
nesses could be predicted (to within an accuracy of

+5%) without having to rely too much on a knowledge
of the attenuation processes.

Experimentation at this facility has primarily been
limited to investigations of the ‘‘unit shield” in
which all material that functions primarily as
shielding is located around the reactor. All the
experiments covered in the survey can be grouped
as follows:

1. Water Shield (experiments 1, 4, 10, 13)
2. Preliminary Investigations’ (experiments 2, 3,
5, 6,8, 10)

b. Effects of water and air gaps in shields

d. Activation expected in a coolant (sodium)
at various locations in a boren carbide shield
(experiment 10)

e. Gamma scattering around submarine bulkhead

The situation at present in regard to unit shields
or reactor parts of divided shields appears to be
that the basic mechanisms are understood and that,
except for the very simplest problems, shield
mockups are essential, although the effects of
small changes in design can be quite well predicted.
The Lid Tank method of mockup testing is highly
developed, and large amounts of data can be col-
lected in relatively short times.

The steel structure of the Tower Shielding Facility
has been erected (Fig. 13.1), and the ground
structures are approximately 75% complete. The
underground building for the reactor controls and
for personnel will be available for occupancy by
December 10; access to the control area of the
building was authorized in November.

The mechanical components: of the reactor have
been constructed and are now being assembled, and
the reactor tank has been received. Construction
of the crew-compartment tank is nearing completion.
The last hoist is scheduled for delivery by January
1, 1954.

 

The optimistic date for completion of the facility
is January 15, after which there will be a one-month
period for critical experiments and shakedown
operation. This will be followed by differential
shielding measurements in the reactor and the
crew-compartment water tanks.

A mockup of a GE airecooled reactor shield
design is scheduled for delivery by March 15 by the
General Electric Company, and for testing in
conjunction with this, a crew-shield mockup will
be supplied by ORNL.

gamma-ray absorption coefficients which have been
measured for some elements have been used to
interpolate the coefficients for other elements.

The visible light from an aircraft nuclear power

be compared with measurements made on the BSR.
The measurements of visible light are made in air

An estimate of neutron albedo was obtained to

around the aircraft reactor shield to just make it
visible. If the airplane were approximately 200 fi
from the observer, the ionizing radiation near the
shield would have to be about 5 x 10% r/hr. If the
airplane were very far from the observer, say
50,000 ft, the ionizing radiation would have to be
about 10? r/hr. These estimates will be compared
with measurements made on the BSR.

NEUTRON REFLECTION COEFFICIENT
FOR WATER

An estimate of the neutron reflection coefficient
for water has been obtained by using a simple
model with a coincident source and a nondirectional
receiver located above the water surface. If iso-
tropic oxygen scatter and attenuation governed by
the removal cross sections are assumed, the re-
flected flux F at height A for source strength N, is

value of a = 0.085 is thus obtained which is in
fair agreement with the experimental! value of 0,08.
