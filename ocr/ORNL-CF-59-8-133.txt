MOLTEN SALT~GRAPHITE COMPATIBILITY TEST
RESULTS OF PHYSICAL AND CHEMICAL MEASUREMENTS

In a graphite moderated-molten salt reactor, certain
advantages are possible if the graphite is in direct contact
with the circulating fluid. The feasibility of such a design,
which depends to a large extent on the compatibility of the
graphite~fused salt system, was tested by inserting 56 samples
of an impervious graphite contained by INOR~8 in a flowing
stream of LiF-BeF,-UF, (62-37-1 mole %) for a period of one -
year at 1300°F.

The experimental assembly consisted of a pump loop
constructed and operated by the Metallurgy Division and the
Experimental Engineering section of the Reactor Projects
Division as described elsewhere.l

Graphite Loop - Initial Preparations

 

Two sets of graphite specimens were obtained from the
National Carbon Company. All rods were 11 long and either
1/2" or 3/16" in diameter. After calipering and weighing,
the rods were packaged in an INOR-8 box as shown in Figures 1
and 2. Each of the larger was fitted with four spacing rings
to permit the desired flow characteristics and to provide
samples for carburization and metallographic examination.

Upon welding the cover plate in place, the assembly was

swaged in the loop and the graphite degassed under. vacuum for

24 hours-at 1100°F. It was then repressured with argon before
being contacted with salt. During operation, a total presspre
of 13 psig was maintained on the graphite: 3 psig the contri=-
bution of the helium cover blanket and the remaining due to

the head developed by the pump-rate of 1.1 gal/min. When the
test was completed, the salt was drained from the loop and
sampled for optical microscopy, X-ray and wet chemical analyses.

Post Test Examinations

 

A. Salt Condition. =~ The chemical analysis, given in
Table I shows the chromium content of the salt increased from
135 ppm to 550 ppm. Petrographic and X-ray analyses did not
reveal any oxidation products or dissolved carbon.

B. Graphite Condition

 

I. Chemical Analyses Data. Machined increments
of graphite specimens were submitted for chemical analysis.
Successive cuttings, 1/32" in depth were taken from two of
the larger diameter rods until center portions of less than
3/16™ diameter were left. These portions and "as received"
impervious graphite "blanks" were then ground to =100 mesh
in a mortar and pestle (thoroughly scoured with Ottawa Sand
according to the recommendations of the Analytical Chemistry
Division after each grinding). All graphite samples were
submitted for an analysis of the uranium and beryllitm con~
centrations. Two machine cuttings, 1/32" in depth, were taken
from four additional rods. These results are given in
Table II with the beryllium and concentrations graphed as a
function of penetration depth in Figure 4. Only a very slight
migration of salt to the center of the graphite is noted.

2. Physical Changes in Graphite. Macroscopically,
there was no change in the rods. None of the samples were
broken or distorted and except for the bottom layer of rods
that was covered with solidified melty the salt did not adhere
to the graphite. The weight and dimensional changes observed
after they had been contacted with circulating fluorides are
listed in Table III. The dimensional changes for the 13=1/2"
diameter rods corresponded to an average loss of less than
0.5 mil in diame ter which approximates the probable error of
the measurements. . Otherwise, there was no evidence of erosion.
Weight losses, which ranged from negligible to 0.05% and :
averaged 0. 02% could be attributed to desorption of residual
gases from the graphite. No statistically significant differ=-
ences were noted in the 13-1/2" diameter rods as compared with
the 8-3/16" diameter rods for which weight data were available.

Based on the loss in weight of the test samples and the

chemical analyses of the machine cuttings, it appears that only
minute quantities of salt permeated the graphite.
