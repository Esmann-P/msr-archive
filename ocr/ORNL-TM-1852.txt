ABSTRACT

~ Evaluations of Molten Salt Breeder Reactors have pointed

oe ~~ ‘the direction of desirable design, research, and development
EE for improving the economic and breeding performance of these

systems, In design, the conventional concept of processing.
fuel in facilities that are separate from the reactor plant
needs to be abandoned in favor of integrating the processing
operations directly into ‘the reactor building. For the MSER,

only a small space is required adjacent to the reactor cells

- for ‘processing cells, This’ arrangement allows significant

: savings in capital, operating, shipping, and inventory costs.

Research and’ development have shown that irradiated MSER

= "fuel can be decontaminated in a four-step process consisting

of fluorination, UFg sorption, vacuum distillation, and

Ca -. reduction-reconstitution. These operations recover not only
~~ the uranium but also the LiF-BeF, carrier, Fluorination and

_ sorption technologies are well developed for batchwise opera-

tion, having advanced through the pilot plant stage. However,

for MSBR application, these two steps,as well as distillation

and reduction-reconstitution, must be developed for continuous

‘operation. These four unit processes are rather. simple. and
~ +. straightforward; however, vacuum distillation requires a higher
«temperature (~1000°C) than has ‘been encountered 1 previously : in
Ce molten salt processing. . :

i Fertile stream processing steps consist of protactinium
removal, fluorination, and UF¢ sorption. Protactinium removal
is singularly important because of the improved breeding
performance with low protactinium concentrations in the fertile
stream. Relatively high processing rates are required.

Xenon poisoning is kept low by injecting a purge gas
directly into the circulating fuel stream. An in-line stripper
removes the gases, which are routed to a charcoal system for
retention and decay.

This document describes the fuel and blanket processes
for the MSBR, giving the current status of the technology and
outlining the needed development, It is concluded that the
principal needs are to develop the vacuum distillation and
protactinium removal operations, which have been demonstrated
in the laboratory but not on an engineering scale. A program to
develop continuous fluoride volatility, liquid-phase reduction-
reconstitution, improved xenon control, and special instrumenta-
tion should also be a major developmental effort. An estimate of
manpower and cost for developing MSBR fuel and fertile processes
indicates that it will require 288 man-years of effort over a
7-year period at a total cost of about $18,000,000.

INTRODUCTION

The breeding potential of a molten salt reactor operating on the
thorium-uranium cycle has been recognized for a number of years, and in
1959 a study was initiated to compare the MSER on the same bases with
other thorium-uranium breeders, namely, aqueous homogeneous, liquid bismuth,
and gas-cooled reactors. The comparisons were made on the bases of fuel
yield (percent of fissile inventory bred per year) and fuel cycle cost, and
the results’ confirmed the belief that the MSBR was attractive in both
regards. Evaluations of MSBR concepts have continued toward optimizing
nuclear and economic performance and have resulted in the generation of
more reliable information on the system. These evaluations have also
served to point the direction of desirable development and research.

Whereas the initial studies were made on the bases of (a) on-site and (b)
central processing plants using existing processing techniques, the savings
that would result by using an integrated processing plant,.i.e., (a), soon became
apparent. Furthermore, a new processing concept for recovering the fuel
carrier salt by vacuum distillation had been shown by Kelly to be feasible,
considerably enhancing the economic appearance of the MSBR. These aspects
of the fuel cycle were studied by Scott and Carter™ for a 1000-Mw (elec-
trical) system. Protactinium removal from the fertile stream was not
considered as a processing step in these studies because no satisfactory
process was apparent; however, more recent experiments have suggested a
mechanism of protactinium removal, whereby significant. improvement in the
breeding performance of an MSBR can be achieved. |

These newer design and processing concepts have been incorporated into
more recent physics and economic calculations to define an optimum MSBR.

The discussion that follows treats processing of MSBR fuel and fertile
streams in this same respect. First, processing requirements for an
economic molten salt breeder are discussed; second, the process is described;
third, the status of the technology and needed development for each process
step are described; fourth, attractive alternative processes to the main-
line operations are discussed; and, finally, a schedule of manpower and

costs for a developmental program to solve critical MSBR processing problems

and to provide the processes and equipment for the processing plant for an

Engineering Test ‘Unit is included.
ELEMENTS AND REQUIREMENTS OF MSER PROCESSING

One of the most attractive features of a two-region, molten salt
reactor is the ease with which the fuel and fertile streams can be processed
for removal of fission products and recovery of bred material. The fluid
streams are easily removed from and returned to the reactor without disturb-
ing operations, and the processing methods are relatively simple and straight-
forward. On-site processing is a primary requirement of a breeder reactor,
which would be at an extreme disadvantage if a sizable inventory of fissile

material were held up in decay cooling and transit.
Objectives

The fuel stream of the MSER is a mixture of LiF-BeF,-UF, in the
approximate molar proportions 63.6-36.2-0.22 mole %; the fertile stream
is a mixture of LiF-BeF,-ThF), of approximate composition 71-2-27 mole %.
The primary objective of the fuel process is to recover both uranium and
carrier salts sufficiently decontaminated from fission products to ensure
attractive breeding performance of the reactor. To discard the carrier salt
with the fission products is not economical since both lithium and
beryllium are expensive components. (the former being enriched to about
99.995 at, % 11), For the blanket processing, the objective is to remove
the bred fissile material on a sufficiently rapid cycle to minimize the
inventory of fissile material, the fission rate, and concentration of

- fission products in the blanket salt.. This can be accomplished by

removing the 233 on a relatively fast cycle but even more effectively

~ by removing the protactinium precursor rapidly enough so that its con-

centration in the blanket is low. A low 233p, concentration is desirable

because each capture of a neutron by an atom of 233p, results in the net

233

loss of two neutrons (effectively two atoms of bred U).

Design Features

An essential element in the design of an MSBR processing plant is
that of keeping the out-of-reactor inventory low to decrease inventory
charges and improve the fuel yield, which is the fraction of fissile
inventory bred per year. The logical way to achieve this low inventory

is to close-~couple the processing plant with the reactor, and it is pro-
posed to integrate the two operations. Processing equipment will be
located in cells adjacent to the reactor cell, and a small portion of

each circulating stream will be metered semicontinuously to the processing
plant. Most processing operations are continuous: the fuel stream being
purged of fission products, fortified with makeup fuel and carrier, and
returned to the reactor core; the fertile stream being stripped of its
protactinium and uranium, fortified with makeup thorium and returned to
the blanket. It is not necessary to allow long decay periods before
processing since the reactants are either gaseous (F,) or solid (granular
NaF) and are not affected by strong radiation fields. Cooling periods
before processing no longer than one day and perhaps as low as a few hours
should suffice. The length of this period depends upon the design of the
continuous fluorinator and the ability to control the fluorination tempera-
ture. Removal of fission product decay heat is a principal consideration
throughout the plant.

In the integrated plant all services available to the reactor are
available to the chemical plant. These include mechanical equipment,
compressed gases, heating and ventilating equipment, electricity, shop
services, supervision, etc, The cost savings for an integrated facility
are immediately apparent when one considers the large amount of duplica-~
tion required for separate plants. Only a relatively small space is needed
for the processing equipment as compared to that needed for the reactor and

power conversion equipment so that the additional building cost is small.
Process Operations

Four major operations are needed to sufficiently decontaminate the

fuel stream of an MSBR. These are fluorination, sorption of UF» vacuum

distillation, and salt reconstitution. The fertile stream requires
fluorination, sorption of UF and for maximum effectiveness includes
protactinium removal, These operations represent the most straightforward
processing for achieving a high-performance molten salt breeder. The
technology for fluorination and sorption is well developed (through the
operation of the fluoride volatility pilot plant at ORNL) the other opera-
tions have been demonstrated in small engineering experiments and/or in
the laboratory. The process for each stream is capable of economically
recovering more than 99.9% of the uranium, oL% or more of the LiF-BeF,

in the fuel carrier, and more than 99% of the LiF in the fertile stream.
DESCRIPTION OF PROCESS

The processing facility must be capable of removing the major portion
of the fission products from the molten fuel salt and returning the purified
salt to the fuel system after reconstitution with 233 and carrier salts,
In blanket processing, the facility must recover bred uranium, minimize
parasitic neutron loss to protactinium, and minimize the loss of carrier
and fertile salts with the waste.

In Fig. 1 a flow diagram is presented to show the steps in processing
a molten salt breeder. The flow rates were obtained from physics calcula-
tions for a 2225-Mw (thermal ) reference reactor. The core cycle time is
52 days, and the blanket cycle time is about 22 days for the uranium
recovery step; protactinium removal is on a l-day cycle. The core power
is 2160 Mw (thermal); the blanket power is 65 Mi (thermal). A flowsheet,
similar to Fig. 1 and excluding the protactinium removal step, was used in
a design and cost study" of a processing plant for a 1000-Mw (electrical)

"MSER.

necessary to allow fission products to decay a few hours before fluorination
so that the fluorinating temperature can be controlled at the desired value.
This holdup will be carried out in a metering tank in the reactor cell where

there is convenient access to the reactor cooling system.

Continuous Fluorination

After the cooling period, “the fuel salt flows into the top of a
columnar vessel where it is contacted by a countercurrent stream of fluorine
gas. The temperature of fluorination is controlled at about 550°C. Uranium
tetrafluoride in the irradiated salt reacts quantitatively with fluorine to
give volatile UF , which is carried overhead by excess fluorine. The
chemical reaction is

UF, + F, = UF .

Certain fission product fluorides are also volatile and will leave
the fluorinator with the UF. The principal metallic elements that form
volatile fluorides are ruthenium, niobium, molybdenum, technetium, and
tellurium. Since prefluorination time is so short, appreciable amounts of
fission product iodine and bromine will also be present. These elements
are oxidized by fluorine to volatile interhalogen compounds and exit in
the UF¢ stream. Zirconium fluoride also has a relatively high vapor
pressure and has been observed in the overhead product. Sorption techniques

are used to purify the UF product.

UF, Purification by Sorption

 

Volatile fission product fluorides and UF, are separated in a series
of sorption and desorption steps. These are batch steps, but the process
is made contimous by using parallel beds alternately. Sh

The first separation is made when the gas passes through a bed of
pelletized NaF. The system consists of two distinct zones, one held at
400°C and one at about 100°C. In the higher-temperature zone, most of the
fission products, corrosion products, and entrained salt are irreversibly
removed while the UF, and some fission products pass through to the lower-
temperature zone. In this zone, UF and MoF are sorbed. The barren
fluorine carrier passes through the next bed of pelletized MgF, , which is

.C

believed to be effective for sorbing technetium; however, available data
are not altogether conclusive. The volatile halogens are expected to pass
through the sorbers and remain in the recycle fluorine stream. These are
controlled by decay and by a small gas purge to the off-gas disposal system.
About 10% of the circulating fluorine will have to be discarded to purge
these fission products.

When the low-temperature zone of the NaF bed is loaded with UF, the
bed is taken off stream, and the temperature of the cold zone is slowly
raised while the bed is swept with fluorine gas. At temperatures around
150°C, molybdenum fluoride desorbs and is carried away, thereby separating
it from UFg. The temperature is raised higher to about LOO°C for complete
desorption of uranium, which is collected for recycle to the reactor. The
NaF and MgF, beds are reused until loaded with retained fission products;
at this point they are discharged to waste and filled with fresh material.
The operation of the sorption system is diagrammed in Fig. 3.

The rate of heat generation by fission products deposited on the
sorbers might be as large as 30% of the gross rate shown in Fig. 2. There-

fore, the beds will require cooling to prevent local overheating.

UF, Collection

Desorbed UFg is carried by fluorine into a primary cold trap held at
about -40°C where it is collected for the fuel reconstitution step. The
-1i0°C trap is backed up by a colder (-60°C) trap to catch any UF that
might pass through the first trap. For additional safety a NaF chemical
trap is included to trap any UF, that might get through the cold traps.
When a cold trap is loaded with UF, the trap is warmed to triple point
conditions (90°C and L6 psia) to melt UF, and allow it to drain to a

receiver for feeding the reduction unit.

Vacuum Distillation

After fluorination, the barren carrier, containing the bulk of the
fission products, flows to a still which is operated at about 1 mm Hg
pressure and 1000°C. The LiF and BeF, volatilize, leaving fission products

in the still bottoms. This residue consists largely of rare earth fluorides,

which are the principal neutron poisons. ‘Available data indicate that the

relative volatilities of the rare earth fluorides, compared to LiF and BeF,,

“are low and that a good separation can be achieved in a single-step distilla-
tion without rectification. The following data (Table 1) have been obtained

“for several fluoride compounds.

Tt is proposed to operate the still semicontinuously, allowing the
fission products to collect in the still bottoms; the bottoms, in turn,
are sent to the fission product accumulator tank (see Fig. 1) for dilution

and storage. ‘The accumulator contains about LOO £t> of 88-12 mole %
- LiF-BeF,, mixture, which is the equilibrium composition of the liquid in the

2

‘still. The accumulator salt is recycled ‘through the still: by adding it

into the still feed coming from the fluorinator. Since the recycle/feed
ratio can have any desired value, it is adjusted to exercise control over

the heat generation rate in the still as the fission products continuously

concentrate at that point. Calculations indicate that a volume ratio as
low as 1:1 is adequate for control of the heat generation.

The LOO £t3 of LiF-BeF, mixture in the accumulator is believed to be
sufficient for collecting fission products for the entire 30-year lifetime

of the reactor. At the end of this time the mixture can be processed for

medium for permanent Eoporal.

Although CsF and RbF have higher vapor pressures than LiF and would be
expected to contaminate the recycle carrier, no difficulty is expected with
these fission products because each has a gaseous precursor which is removed
on a very fast cycle in the gas sparging operation. Another fission product
that has a relatively high vapor pressure is ZrF), , and it might be necessary
to discard a small fraction of the carrier distillate to purge this poison.
There is some evidence that the activity of ZrF), is low in the still bottoms;
thus, most of the ZrF), will remain in these bottoms. Even if all the | ork)
distilled, no more than 5% of the distillate would have to be discarded to
control its poisoning effect.

Although fluorination is expected to recover greater than 99. 9% of
the uranium in the fuel stream, any small fraction that reaches the vacuum
still is not entirely lost. The vapor pressure of UF), at 1000°C is slightly
greater than that of LiF allowing part of this uranium to accompany the

carrier salt.

Fuel Reconstitution

The principal operation in reconstituting the fuel is to recombine
the distillate, the recycle and makeup uranium, and the makeup carrier
salt in the proper proportions for feed to the reactor. Uranium hexa-
fluoride from the cold traps is mixed with a portion of the bred UFg from
the blanket process, and the mixture is dissolved at 550 to 600°C in
recycle fuel salt. The mixture is kept at the proper UF), concentration
by introducing LiF-BeF,
into the mixture to reduce UF to UF) . The entire operation can be carried

distillate and makeup. Hydrogen is then introduced

out continuously in a single unit. : :

A filter after the reduction unit will be used to clarify the fuel
salt before it goes to the reactor. Reducing conditions in the column will
precipitate any colloidal nickel or iron, which will contaminate the salt

(as a result of equipment corrosion).

Xenon Removal

Because of the low solubility of the rare gases in molten fluoride
salts, xenon can be stripped from the fuel salt by sparging with an inert
gas such as helium or nitrogen. The sparging is done in an in-line gas

13 A very short

stripping unit located between the pump and the reactor.
cycle time of the order of 30 sec is required to keep xenon poisoning at
the desired low level, which is less than 0.5% fractional poisoning. The
inert carrier gas transports the fission gases to charcoal adsorbers where
they are retained for decay; the carrier gas is recycled. Because of the
very short cycle time, this processing must be accomplished with equipment
in the reactor primary system and is considered to be a part of the reactor
system, rather than a part of the fuel processing sy stem.
An alternative method of eliminating xenon is to process the reactor

fluid for removal of iodine, the precursor of xenon. A method for removing

iodine has not been developed; however, laboratory experiments have given
promising results.l! The method is to sparge the fuel salt with an HF-H,
mixture, allowing the iodine ion (the form present under reactor conditions)
to react with HF forming HI, which is removed as a gas. Considering the
fact that 135; has a half-life of 6.7 hr, it is seen that the processing
rate must be fast to make the process effective for removing the xenon

“Torus susan Process

The fertile (or blanket) stream process has three primary operations:

“protactinium removal, continuous: fluorination, and UFg sorption. The

assumption is made that the ‘uranium is not removed with the protactinium,

‘so the latter two operations are-analogous to the corresponding fuel stream

operations discussed above: but are carried out at a higher volumetric rate.

"The fertile stream is cycled through fluorination once every 20 to 25 days

to keep a low uranium concentration in the blanket, thereby keeping the

 
 

 

 

-18 -

fission rate low. The low fission rate ensures a low fission product
accumulation rate so that it is unnecessary to remove them on the same
cycle as uranium, In fact, a 30-year discard cycle of the barren fertile
stream is a sufficient purge rate for fission products. At the end of
this time the waste tank would be processed to recover ThF,; the fission
products would be permanently stored in an inexpensive medium.

If the process for removing protactinium from the fertile stream also
removes all the uranium, fluorination of the fertile stream will not be
necessary. A fluorination step is, however, required in the subsequent
processing of the protactinium to separate the uranium.

The bred uranium is recovered in cold traps as UF. A portion of
this is used to refuel the core, and the remainder is sold.

Protactinium Removal

 

. The breeding performance of the reactor can be significantly improved
if the protactinium concentration is kept low. The proposed process is to
contact the fertile salt at about 650°C on a rather fast cycle, perhaps as
fast as once every 10 to 60 hr, with a stream of liquid metal carrier; ego,
bismuth, containing 3000 to LOOO ppm thorium. The thorium metal -reduces
protactinium and the two nuclides exchange between the two streams. A
hydrofluorination or sorption treatment is then used to extract protactinium
from the bismuth stream into a second salt mixture, in which it is allowed to
- decay to uranium. Later the salt is fluorinated to recover the uranium.

Preliminary data indicate that 96% of the protactinium can be removed
from the blanket by this method. The behavior of uranium has not yet been
determined. Thorium, of course, is the ideal reductant because the removed
protactinium is replaced by equivalent fertile material.

Off -Gas Treatment

Most of the off-gas from the processing plant comes from the continuous
fluorinators; smaller amounts are formed in various other process vessels.
The gases are treated to prevent the release of any contained fission
products to the atmosphere. Excess fluorine used in the fluorinators is-
»

recycled through a surge chamber, and a small side-stream of the recycling
fluorine is sent through a caustic scrubber to prevent gross buildup of
fission products. Each of the processing vessels and holdup tanks has off-
gas lines that lead to the scrubber for removing HF, Fos and volatile
contaminants.

The scrubber operates as-a continuous countercurrent, packed bed unit
with recirculating aqueous KOH. A small side-stream of KOH solution is
sent to waste, and the scrubber off-gas is contacted with steam to hydrolize
fission product tellurium. A filter removes the hydrolized product. Non-
condensable gases are sent to the facility that treats gases generated by
the reactor; ultimately the gases are discharged to the atmosphere after

considerable dilution.
Waste Storage

Waste streams from the processing facility are: (1) aqueous waste from
the KOH scrubber for purifying recycle fluorine, (2) molten salt from fertile
stream discard, (3) NaF and MgF,, sorbent from UF purification, (L) daughter
products of Kr and Xe that accumulate as solids in the gas sparging system of
the reactor, and (5), if needed, molten salt discard of LiF-BeF, carrier to
purge ZrF) . The material in the fission product accumulator (see Fig. 1) is
not considered a waste because it is not removed from the process even

though it contains fission products. Eventually a portion of this volume

‘becomes waste at the end of the reactor lifetime and after processing to

reclaim as much as possible of the LiF-BeF, content. Each of the waste

2

streams would be stored in underground facilities at the reactor site; after

appropriate decay periods and waste treatment procedures, these could be

sent to permanent storage or disposal sites.

Aqueous Waste

The aqueous waste stream is small and would be combined with similar

wastes from the reactor in a single underground facility.

 
 

 

 

-20 -

Fertile Stream Discard

 

This waste is stored in an underground tank which can be cooled by
air circulation in natural convection. The specific heat generation rate
is low because of the small concentration of fission products present. It
may be desirable to store the fertile stream discard inside the processing
cell. The salt volume is only about 2500 £43 , and, if inside the cell,
cooling could be conveniently provided by the same medium that is used in
the processing operations.

NaF and MgF, Pellets

 

These sorbents, which contain the volatile fission product fluorides,
are stored in cylindrical cans in an underground concrete vault. The spent
pellets are discharged from the sorbers into cans inside the processing
cell. When several cans have been filled, the contents are moved from the
cell to the vault. Decay heat is removed by forced air circulation through
the vault. |

Kr and Xe Daughter Products

 

Krypton and xenon, sparged from the reactor, are precursors of solid
fission products (Rb, Sr, Y, Zr, Cs, Ba, La, Ce) that settle as fines and
dust throughout the gas processing system. These particulates must be
removed to avoid clogging and overheating gas lines. A possible method for
doing this is to periodically flush lines and gas holders with a molten
salt, which dissolves and accumulates the decay products. The accumulator
could be a vessel (in the processing cell) in which these fission products
are retained until permanent disposal.

pilot plant. During this period the process was adapted for use with the
fluid fuel, NaF- -ZrF) - 1? of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment, and two alloy
fuels, Zr-U and A1-U. Although the alloy fuels were solid, they were
dissolved in the molten fluoride salt and their processing was carried out
by methods analogous to processing a molten fluoride fuel. After the initial

dissolution step for the solid element, processing of liquid and solid fuels

becomes identical within the limits imposed by different compositions.

The fluoride volatility process takes ‘its name from the principal
operation, the volatilizing of uranium ‘as the hexafluoride. The advantages
of fluoride volatility are: the small volume of fission product waste, the
convenient form of the UF product, which is easily converted to UF), for
fuel recycle , the virtual elimination of processing criticality hazards as
opposed to aqueous processing. ‘of enriched fuels, and the high decontamina-
tion factors attainable for the UF product. Unattractive features of the
process are: the corrosiveness of fluorine-molten salt mixtures, and, to a
lesser degree, the high processing temperatures, A diagram of the CRNL
Fluoride Volatility Pilot Plant is shown in Fig. Li.

In addition to the molten fluoride processing work at ORNL, similar
research has been carried out at Argonne National Laboratory. Efforts at
the two installations were complementary, with the ANL work being directed
primarily toward hydrofluorination and fluorination techniques and reagents
as well as equipment development, In addition, molten salt process develop-

ment was supplemented by an extensive. corrosion-testing program under sub-

contract with Battelle Memorial Institute (1959-1963). Evaluations were

made of potential construction materials for the hydrofluorination and

fluorination equipment; the metals of most interest were found to be

_ Hastelloy N, Alloy 79-L (known also as HyMu 80 and Moly Permaloy), and
‘Nickel 201 (L-Nickel). A11 these metals are satisfactory construction
‘materials for molten: salt processing ‘equipment with the possible exception
of the vacuum still, ~The 1000°C distillation temperature is beyond the

range at which materials have ‘been evaluated. :

The proposed process for the MSER includes several operations in
addition to those with ‘which there has been: reprocessing experience. The
most important of these are: continuous fluorination,- vacuum distillation,

reduction of UF¢ to UF , and removal of protactinium from the fertile

stream. The following paragraphs review the experience with ARE, Zr-U,
and A1-U fuel processing and delineate the status of existing technology

for the operations involved in MSBR processing.

ARE Fuel Processing

Initial development of a process for molten fluoride fuel was motivated
by the need to recover unburned, highly enriched uranium from the irradiated
fuel of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment. This fuel was a 48-49.5-2.5 mole %
mixture of NaF- -2rF) -UF) . Beginning in 195) the fluoride volatility process
was developed for this recovery and culminated in successfully processing
the ARE fuel during the period December 1957 to March 1958. Since the
reactor operated in November 1954, the irradiated fuel was about three years
old. The recovery operations ‘consisted of batchwise UF volatilization,
followed by its decontamination on granular beds of sodium fluoride, and its
recovery in cold traps. Barren waste, containing the bulk of the fission
products, was drained into metal cans and buried. Better than 99% recovery
of uranium was attained in this initial hot operation of the fluoride

L

volatility pilot plant. Decontamination factors of at least 10° were

attained, as indicated by the gross gama activity of the product.’

Zr-U and Al-U Fuels

In the initial stages of fluoride volatility development it was
recognized that the process had application to fuels other than molten
fluoride salts. Concurrently with the development of a process for ARE
fuel, laboratory research was. pursued toward adapting the process for
treating irradiated Zircaloy-clad, Zr-U alloy fuel from submarine reactors.

This research resulted in the development of a hydrofluorination operation

in which the solid fuel element is dissolved by reaction with anhydrous HF

“for ARE fuel. LL mi oo

Processing. experience led to improvements in the pilot plant and
equipment before operation with Zr-U fuel. In addition to the hydro-

~ fluorinator, an improved fluorinator (Fig. 5) and NaF sorber were incor-

porated in the modified plant. The plant was operated with irradiated

submarine reactor fuels during the period March 1962 to September 1963.
Fuel elements that had cooled as long as 6.5 years and as short as
6 months were successfully processed. Uranium ‘recovery and decontamina-

“tion in all runs were excellent.

The final phase of operation of the ORNL Volatility Pilot Plant was
associated with processing aluminum-clad, A1-U alloy fuel, 10. It was found
that the solid elements could be satisfactorily dissolved by reaction with
anhydrous HF in molten 66-22-12 mole % KF-ZrF) -ALF;.
the process were the same as for Zr-U alloy processing, and the same pilot

Other operations in

plant equipment was used. A number of pilot plant runs were made with
irradiated Al-U fuel during the period July 1964 to January 1965 at which

time the Volatility Pilot Plant was shut down. During that period, Al-U
fuel cooled for only four weeks was satisfactorily processed, The same

excellent recovery and decontamination factors were obtained as with ARE

: and Zr-U fuels; uranium recoveries of 99.9% or better, and decontamination

factors of 10%, were typical.
Continuous Fluorination

Continuous fluorination is desirable for processing both the core andl

blanket of an MSBER because of the need to minimize the out-of -reactor

inventory and the costs of processing. Engineering development is compli-
cated by the corrosiveness of the molten-salt—fluorine mixture and by the
difficulty of reproducing in the laboratory the high internal heat
generation rate of a recently irradiated fuel.

Current Status

“The technology for batchwi se ‘fluorination has been rather thoroughly

oo developed and applied in the Fluoride Volatility Pilot Plant but there is

little experience with continuous fluorination., One technique of continuous
fluorination involves spraying or Jetting small droplets of molten salt
through a fluorine atmosphere in such a way that they do not, contact the

metal walls of the fluorinator, Some very preliminary: tests with single

salt droplets have been successful in achieving high uranium recovery.

 
 

- 26 -

A second method, which appears to be the most promising, is to carry
out the fluorination in a liquid-phase continuous system using.a 1/2- to
3/h-in.-thick layer of frozen salt to protect the vessel walls. The initial
3

work on such a system was done at Argonne National Laboratory;~ currently,
the development is being pursued in the Chemical Technology Division at
ORNL. Preliminary results, employing units that did not have frozen-wall
protection, have demonstrated that high uranium recoveries can be effected

in continuous, countercurrent operation.

Needed Development

Engineering development of a continuous fluorinator should be given
high priority. Areas requiring study include: mass transfer information;
process flow control; method of establishing and maintaining a frozen-salt
wall; mist deentrainment in gas stream; and efficiency of gas-liquid
contact, A problem in particular need of attention is the design of nozzles
that admit and remove the molten salt and fluorine gas. Tt might be
difficult to protect these areas from corrosive attack by establishing a
frozen-salt wall, In the development it should be recognized that there
is a large difference in capacity between the fuel and fertile stream
fluorinators and that the internal heat generation in the fertile stream
is appreciably less than in the fuel. A conceptual design of a continuous

fluorinator is shown in Fig. 6.
UF Purification by Sorption

The NaF and MgF, sorption units provide adequate decontamination for
UF. The batchwise units can be operated satisfactorily for both fuel and
fertile streams of the MSBR. Development on this part of the process is

not critical to successful operation of a molten salt breeder experiment.

Current Status

The UFg purification system has been operated as an integral part of
the Fluoride Volatility Pilot Plant, producing a product that can be handled
directly. Also, it has been demonstrated that uranium recovery from the

sorbers is essentially quantitative.

Needed Development

Although no extensive development is needed to ensure successful
operation of the sorption system, there are several areas in which performance
data should be obtained. The sorption characteristics and capacity of ¥gF,,
for technetium are not well known; the methods for removal of tellurium and
ruthenium are also not well known; and the chemistry of molybdenum in the
sorption system needs better definition. From an engineering viewpoint, a
sorption system that could be operated continuously would have advantages
over a batch system, and such a system should be developed for large-scale
MSBR installations. |

Heat generation in the sorber beds will be appreciable because of the
short decay time before fluorination. A thorough evaluation must be made
of this problem {including a satisfactory cooling mechanism). Since the
sorbents become wastes that are removed from the processing cell for
storage, it is essential that a means of doing this be developed (one that
precludes frequent entry into the cell).

A diagram of a successfully operated unit is shown in Fig. 7.

Cold Traps

Current Status

Cold traps, like the one shown in Fig. 8, have been used at ORNL and
ORGDP for the collection of UFg. The unit has to be operated batchwise,
but this is no deterrent to its use in a breeder experiment or a full-scale

installation.

Needed Development

No development is needed on this phase of the process on a near-term
basis; however, ultimately it will be desirable to have a continuous cold

trap system.

Vacuum Distillation

The vacuum distillation concept for separating LiF-BeF, fuel carrier
from fission products is feasible from an engineering viewpoint. However,
considerable development is needed to perfect the operation for a breeder
experiment, and the most significant advancement in molten salt processing

can be made by developing vacuum distillation.

Current Status

Vacuum distillation has been seriously considered for purifying the
carrier since laboratory teste showed that decontamination factors for
rare earths in the range 100 to 1000 could be achieved. These bench-scale
tests have been continued to develop basic data for the relative volatility
(see Table 1) of rare earth fluorides as well as operating technology at

 

high temperature and low pressure. Also underway is the fabrication of a

large-scale distillation experiment that will be an extensive demonstration

of the operation employing nonradioactive mixtures; the last part of the

experiment will be a demonstration run employing radioactive spent fuel

from the MSRE. The equipment for this experiment is shown in Fig. 9.

Needed Development

Research has only recently begun to explore vacuum distillation of

molten salts, and a high priority should be given to this critical step in

the processing scheme. Although a considerable amount of physical and
chemical data for this system has been measured, more data, especially

relative volatility, activity, and distillation rate measurements, are

satisfactory method for accumulating and storing the fission products. The
general problems and technology of operating a piece of equipment at 1000°C
and 1 mn Hg need to be determined so that their influence on design can be
recognized. Extensive, nonradioactive testing of the MSRE experimental

still should answer some of these questions.

Current Status

- 33 -

Even though the accumulated fission products generate a considerable
amount of heat, the use of the accumulator vessel lowers the specific heat
generation rate to a value that introduces no difficulty in designing the
heat removal system. The calculated magnitude of this heat generation rate
for a conceptual still design for a 1000-Mw (electrical) MSER is shown in
Fig. 10.

The 1000°C operating temperature of the vacuum still introduces
metallurgical problems that have not been encountered previously in molten
salt processing. Equipment for the MSRE distillation experiment is made
of Hastelloy Nj; however, it is believed that this material is not the best
for these conditions and that development of a suitable material should be
started. Molybdenum or a high molybdenum alloy are likely candidates and
should be evaluated. Not only must the material be compatible with molten
fluoride salt but also with the coolant, which will probably be Nak or
another molten salt, and the surrounding atmosphere. Duplex or clad material

may be applicable.
Fuel Reconstitution

The reduction of UF to UF, and recombination of the UF), with LiF-BeF,
carrier requires engineering development. This work should have a high
priority, ranking in importance with continuous fluorination and vacuum

distillation.

The reduction of UF, by hydrogen in an H,-F, flame is a well known
reaction; the reduction is rapid and quantitative. However, the powdery

UF), product is difficult to ‘handle remotely. Liquid-phase reduction in

which UF is reacted with H, in molten salt is more suitable for continuous,
trouble-free operation, A limited amount of world has been done on liquid-
phase reduction, and the data indicate that the method is highly suitable
to this application. oo

Needed Development

Little is known about the kinetics of the absorption and reduction of
UF in the molten fluoride mixture other than that it is fast. The mechanism
may be reaction of UF with UF) to form an intermediate fluoride, followed by
reduction with H,. » An experimental program is needed to study reaction
rates, venperatins, UF}, ‘concentration, nozzle design, contactor design, and
gas-liquid separation. There might be a corrosion problem in the reduction
unit, and considerable attention will be needed in the design of ‘the unit to

minimize this effect.

Fuel Clarification
Reducing conditions that exist in the UF reduction unit are conducive
to the formation of metallic species, particularly nickel and iron, which
may be in a finely divided or colloidal state. Before returning to the
reactor, the fuel will need clarification. Development of a solid-liquid
separation system for the breeder experiment is not a critical item;

however, it is a problem that will have to be solved eventually.

Current Status

Final clarification of the fuel charge for the MSRE was accomplished
by filtration, which was carried out after an H,-HF treatment to reduce
oxides. Sintered nickel filters were used in a batch operation, ard after
use the filters were discarded. This procedure was very effective in

clarifying the molten salt.
Needed Development

So far, filtrations have been carried out on nonirradiated salts, and

one did not have to cope with heat generation from fission product decay on

‘the filters. This could be a real ‘problem in a system that recycles fuel.

Present filters probably do not have an adequate operating lifetime in this
type of service. No techniques for handling or backwashing the filter cake
have been worked out. A continuous clarification method would be highly
desirable to avoid frequent entries into the cell to change filters.

Protactinium Removal

Protactinium removal is an important ‘operation in fertile stream
‘processing and should be vigorously pursued. The benefits are primarily
in improvement in the breeding ratio by decreasing parasitic captures) and
reduction in the thorium inventory. In order to be effective, the process-
ing rate for protactinium removal must be significantly faster than its
natural decay rate (half-life = 27.) days); this requirement means a high
volumetric processing rate for the fertile salt.

Current Status

The work on protactinium removal has been confined to laboratory
development, which has given some promising preliminary results. The
status of this work is discussed in the report? on the chemical develop-
ment program, ORNL-TM-1853.

Needed Development

Laboratory investigations into protactinium removal are underway, but
no engineering development has been started. As soon as the laboratory
work has reached the point at which engineering studies can be useful, the
studies should be started. They will involve the complete engineering
development of process and equipment. A primary need for the engineering
is an alpha-handling facility in which to do the work. Building such a
facility should begin soon in order to be ready when needed. - Engineering
development must be oriented toward a simple and easily operated process
because of the high volumetric throughput required to maintain a low

protactinium concentration.
Waste Handling and Disposal

Waste handling for an MSER poses some problems that have not been
encountered before in processing operations. These are brought about
primarily by having considerable amounts of fission products appear at

several points in the process, for example, in still bottoms, in NaF and

QO.

MgF, sorbents, and throughout the gas sparging system. In-process
collection and handling of these wastes are areas that need- study and
development. On the other hand, waste disposal is not a critical problem
in the development of a molten salt breeder experiment. Bulk storage
procedures like those used for aqueous wastes can be used for the near
term while research and development effort is applied in more-critical

areas.

Current Status

The general topic of waste disposal has been the subject of consider-
able study at (RNL for several years. Although molten fluoride wastes
were not a specific part of the study, a large amount of the developed
data and knowledge are applicable in this case. For example, the cost
data for permanent disposal and heat dissipation rate in underground

storage facilities should be very good estimates for the fluoride salt

case. In addition there is considerable experience in handling and
treating hot aqueous wastes in pilot plant operations at Hanford and the
Idaho Chemical Processing Plant to make glasses and calcined products.

Needed Development

A study is being made of waste disposal for molten fluoride salts
to determine the most satisfactory program to follow. The fission product
accumulator, which is integrated directly into the vacuum distillation
step, is in effect a waste tank that stores the bulk of the MSBR waste
for its 30-year lifetime. At ‘the end of life and following an interim
cooling period, this waste could be disposed of by procedures current at

that time. - Another highly radioactive waste is the NaF and MgF, sorbent
from purifying the UF. Since this material is already in solid, granular
form, it is probably suitable for permanent disposal if sealed in the

proper container. An interim cooling period would of course be necessary.

In the reactor off-gas ‘treating system, however, fission products

are not conveniently collected in a'material that subsequently acts as a

retention medium; instead decaying krypton and xenon deposit solid daughter
products, perhaps as fines and dust, throughout the off-gas system. The
 

-38 -

problem of keeping the off-gas system clean of such products has not been
encountered in fuel processing, and considerable development is needed to

perfect a satisfactory method.
Process Control

The chemical processing plant will need measurements of radiation,
temperature, pressure, uranium concentration, and flow rate. Development
of a flow metering device is of outstanding importance because of the
proposed continuous operations, and the work should be undertaken in the

near future.

Current Status

All of these measurements have been encountered in the development
program for the MSRE and much satisfactory instrumentation has been developed.
In the case of temperature and pressure control, satisfactory means of
control have been developed. However, the problem of controlling the flow
rate of a molten salt stream has not been solved. There is no current
method of continuously measuring uranium concentration in a flowing stream
of molten salt or UF concentration in a flowing gas stream. Concentrations
have been determined by sampling and laboratory analysis.

Needed Development

The primary need in instrumentation for processing the MSER is a flow
control device that can meter the flow of a molten salt stream. The problem
has been recognized as a difficult one and, in the past, has been circum-
vented by batch operation and liquid level measurements. However s for.
smooth operation of a continuous process, such a device will be needed. .
The usual method of using flow control valves is not suitable for a molten
salt and has been avoided.

Considerable emphasis must also be placed on the development of in-line
instrumentation for concentration measurements, particularly for uranium,
lithium, and beryllium. Smooth operation of the plant might require a fast
analysis of a flowing stream.

DEVELOPMENT OF ALTERNATIVE PROCESSES AND IMPROVEMENTS

The discussion in the preceding sections has presented the main-line
effort for the development of a processing method for the molten salt
breeder reactor. In this section several alternative schemes are described.
These schemes have promise for improving or substituting for the primary

processing method and a concurrent investigation should be conducted.
~Todine Stripping

No single fission product has such a deleterious effect on the breeding

fission yield, the reduction in poison fraction by iodine removal is limited.

performance as

an indirect means of removing xenon; however, since

Todine stripping does not appear to have an advantage over direct stripping

of xenon, and ‘development should be subordinate to more important problems.

Current Status

Some laboratory studies have been made of the chemistry of iodine in
molten salts. They included experiments in which iodine was removed from

salt by sparging with a stream of HF in hydrogen.

Needed Development
~ Laboratory development should be continued to obtain the basic data

for an iodine removal process. Engineering support is also needed to

evaluate proposed processes. - The engineering effort will include some

experimentation as well as process analysis and calculations. Fission

gases contain a surprisingly large amount of the decay energy of the system,

and the importance of this fact needs to be assessed in the design of a

fission gas disposal system.
Use of Additives in Vacuum Distillation

The success of vacuum distillation depends upon the fission product
fluorides' having a low relative volatility campared to LiF, and extant
 

- Lo -

data indicate that this is the case with the rare earths (see Table 1).
However, there is a possibility that even lower relative volatilities can
be achieved through the use of additives that react with the rare earths,
zirconium, and other fission products. The additives could be introduced
Just prior to the vacuum distillation step and would remain in the still
residue, being sent to waste when the still is drained.

"This technique could be significantly helpful in improving zirconium
decontamination if the proper complexing additive were found. Zirconium
fluoride is more volatile than LiF so the vacuum still may not be very
effective in separating it from the carrier unless its activity in the
solution is lowered. Zirconium poisoning can be economically controlled
by discarding carrier salt, but lowering Zr), volatility would decrease

the required amount of carrier discard.

Current Status

No work has been done.

Needed Development

Reliable relative volatility data for the rare earths and zirconium
fluorides are being obtained, and this is the first step in accurately
assessing the effect of additives. Bench-scale development is the primary
need. If useful additives are found their effects can be demonstrated in

the general development of the distillation process.
Reduction-Coprecipitation and/or Electrolysis

Reductive coprecipitation’ of the lanthanide elements with beryllium
has been demonstrated in the laboratory. The reduction product is a
refractory, insoluble beryllide deposited at the salt-metal interface.
Metallic lithium can also be used as the reducing agent. . =

Electrochemical reduction instead of liquid metal contacting might
also be used to control the concentration of such fission products as Mo,

Ru, Sn, and Pd and in removing corrosion product Fe, Ni, and Cr.

’ C ).
 

“C’

nt

Current Status

The liquid metal extractions have been limited to scouting experiments
in the laboratory; however, significant removals were observed for La, Sm,
Gd, Sr, and Eu using a Li-Bi alloy extractant. Similar results were obtained
with Be instead of Li; however, a large excess of Be was needed to remove Zr.

Needed Development

The data on these extraction methods are preliminary and insufficient
for judging the process. Back extraction of rare earths from liquid metal
carrier has not been tested. More basic laboratory experiments are needed
to more clearly define mechanisms and products. As for electrolytic
reduction, the electrochemistry of molten salt systems needs to be explored
as a prerequisite to a sound evaluation of the method. Basic oxidation-
reduction relationships between the metals and the rare earth components of
the salt phase need to be measured. Extensive engineering development will
be required if laboratory experiments indicate that the process is attractive.

Ion Exchange with Nonfluoride Solids

The processes included here are concerned with the selective removal
of rare earth fission products while not requiring any change of state in
the bulk of MSBR core stream. Conceptually, this is a most desirable

feature. Refractory solids, based on carbides, phosphides, nitrides,

~ silicides, and sulfides, might be found which will exchange cations with

the rare earths forming insoluble compounds. Oxides might also be included
in this class of materials because of their extreme low solubility in

molten salt. Indeed, the oxide method might be particularly useful for
processing a fuel stream containing thorium, as proposed in the alternative

reactor concept. In its simplest form, the operation can be visualized as

"a percolation of a small side stream of core fluid through a column packed

with the ion exchange material.

Current Status

There have been some exploratory experiments’ with carbides (that

indicate such an exchange does occur)and a few incidental observations
 

- 42 -

on sulfides (made during the course of other studies). On the other hand,
there is a large body of information concerning the chemistry of oxides in
contact with molten salts. Many oxides, including those of fission products
. as well as heavy metals, have been studied to establish their solubility
products in molten salt. Also the removal of rare earths as oxides from
molten fluoride melts has been researched to assess the potential for a
processing scheme. However, it is not yet possible to resolve all the
variables to permit a quantitative statement about the possibilities for

such a process.

Needed Development

More laboratory development is needed on these ion exchange processes
before there can be a full appreciation of their potential, Later in the
development, the work will have to be supported by engineering experiments,
which to a large extent would be concerned with contactor development.

SCHEDULE OF MANPOWER AND COST FGR DEVELOPMENT PROGRAM

The cost and manpower commitment necessary to develop on-site,
integrated processing methods for the fuel and fertile streams of a molten
salt breeder reactor were estimated on the presumption that all critical
questions required answers by June of 1970. Costs were based on the pre-
dicted costs of work in the Chemical Technology Division (including a
steady 2% increase per year) and the estimated amount of work necessary to
solve each problem as required for comprehensive design and optimum
operation. . oo

Table 2 itemizes the manpower end costs for each subprogram with totals
drawn at the end of FY 7h. It is anticipated that some support for the
reactor processing development program will be required after FY 7h, but |
that it will be small compared to the effort which brought the program to
that point. | ’ oo |

Comments on each subprogram, with the anticipated status at the end of
FY 74,are given below.

Continuous Fluorination

The continuous fluorination development is primarily an engineering
problem which will center around the development of small towers operated
with the liquid phase continuous. By the end of 1970 a good estimate of
the size of equipment necessary to give the desired recovery consistently
will be established. The feasibility of protecting surfaces from corrosion
by a layer of frozen salt will be established, although plant conditions
cannot be realized in experiment. Scouting work will have been done on
alternative methods for continuous fluorination, including spray fluorina-
tion technique. Studies will have been initiated to determine the rate-
controlling mechanisms. In years 1971 through 1974 additional work will
be done to establish the mechanism of mass transfer to allow more nearly
optimum operation. Corrosion protection by a frozen layer of salt will
be further studied with emphasis on startup and shutdown and the specific
design of inlet and outlet ports.

Sorption

The absorption system to collect and purify UF from the fluorinator
does not require extensive work; however, the use of a supplemental
magnesium fluoride bed to retain technetium will be studied. All pertinent
problems will be answered by the end of 1970. Attention will be given to
the specific equipment necessary for the absorption problems in the reactor

processing.
Carrier Salt Distillation and the MSRE Experiment

Work on carrier salt distillation is logically divided into two parts.
There will be an experiment in the MSRE in which salt from this reactor will
be distilled and the separation from fission products demonstrated in a
short campaign of batchwise operation. This should be completed by the end
of 1969 and will require, including FY 67 expenses, about 8-1/2 man-years
and $500,000. The other part of the distillation study is of a more general
nature and will be aimed at providing an effective unit for use in the

breeder reactor. By the end of 1970 relative volatility of all significant
components in the fuel salt and blanket salt should be known with accuracy
necessary for design. The behavior of evaporating salt systems under the
temperature and pressure of the still will be understood and calculations
will be made to defire the requirements for mass transport from the bulk of
the solution to the evaporating interface. The feasibility of using
distillation will be well established by this time and the approximate

size of the unit will be known; however, details on still design will not

have been fixed.

Reconstitution of Fuel

Work on the reconstitution of the fuel will comprise a minimum study
for understanding the effect of oxidation state of the salt on its chemical
and physical properties, and for providing an effective design. There is
no question as to the feasibility of the liquid phase reconstitution of the
salt. i}

Blanket Processing (Pa)

Studies on the processing of the blanket salt to remove protactinium
cannot be specifically outlined at this time because of the uncertainties
in the chemistry of the system. It is anticipated that engineering work
would not be undertaken in earnest for at least two years, during which
time chemical studies and feasibility studies would proceed (while the
necessary experimentel facilities are being constructed). By the end of

-1970it is anticipated that there will be a flowsheet for protactinium
removal; it will likely ‘involve either reduction of protactinium with its
aceumulation on metal surfaces, reduction and assimilation into ‘a molten
metal, or the ion exchange of _protactinium with some active insoluble

oxide. Cold engineering studies would have commenced by 1970 and engineer-

‘ing experiments in alpha facilities will be in an advanced planning stage.
 

 

- U6 -
Filtration and Salt Cleanup

It is anticipated that there will be particulate matter circulating
with the salt streams. It is possible that intentional precipitation of
specific fission products may be used, but in any case solid matter will
be present. A small effort will be devoted to the development of methods
to filter and clean the salt during reactor operation. By the end of 1970
an acceptable filter medium should be available and tests should have been
started. These will terminate after 1971. |

Process Off -Gas Handling

Studies will be pursued to define methods of handling and treating
the gases produced by the chemical processing plant . Among the problems
which hopefully will be solved by 1970 is the problem of accommodating
the fission product decay heat in gas streams. By the end of 1970 all
problems in the handling of the off-gas will be anticipated and defined.

Alternative Processing Schemes and Process Improvement

There will be a study of reasonable intensity on the ‘evaluation of
alternatives to the fluorination-distillation process. Although it is not
anticipated that a more desirable alternative will be produced, study
should be undertaken to ascertain that we have not missed a better process
than the one we plan to use. Alternative methods for removing xenon from.
the fuel salt, specifically the removal of precursor iodine, will be
evaluated. This subprogram will also include study of methods of processing
an alternative reactor which contains thorium in the fuel salt. This change
in chemistry produces chemical and engineering problems much more formidable
than those associated with the system without thorium. It is anticipated
that the study would form a mucleus of technology from which a more intensive
program could spring if such an alternative reactor were necessary. By the
end of 1970 both the reactor system and the processing method will be firmly
fixed and this subprogram will be reoriented to handle process chemistry

problems as they arise. The work on process alternatives should yield
valuable insight into the phase equilibria of circulating impurities that

may be found in the reactor system.
Special Instrumentation and Process Control

There are many places where special instrumentation and control are
crucial. The feed to the continuous fluorinator and the feed to the dis-
tillation unit must be metered; therefore’; knowledge of properties 5 particu-
larly uranium concentration and gross beta-gamma, is necessary for process
control. A minimal program will be manned to. do this, although it is
anticipated that most process control problems will be worked out as part

of the development of particular units.
Waste Handling and Disposal

One important problem in the successful operation of the chemical
processing plant is the safe, temporary accommodation of the separated
fission products. These include those stored in the fission product
retention tank {which will be close-coupled to the carrier salt still),
alkali metals fthich are accumulated along with several ‘other fission
products from the Xenon removal system), and the sorber beds from the
fluorination step. No fundamental difficulties are foreseen, but several
materials-handling and heat-transfer problems must be worked out.

Our waste disposal program is not intended to make major contribution

“to the philosophy of long-term waste disposal, Our effort here will be

restricted to establishing an acceptable way of disposing of the particular

‘waste from this experimental reactor. . The method will be selected and

evaluated by the end of 1969 and details of the facility should be available
by the end of 1970. “ES i.

‘General Design

Provision is made for funding a general design group who will put

together the components in a rational form and do layout work, etc., and
 

-- 18 -

who will maintain liaison with designers. By the end of 1970, space :
requirements and the general appearance of the facility should be reasonably
established.

Salt Production

As a service to all of the IAboratory groups working with reactor-grade
MSR-type salt systems, a group will be set up to produce salt in adequate
quantities. It is anticipated that the existing facilities at Y-12 will be
used for at least the first two years, after which time some modification
will be necessary to allow increased capacity. These modifications will be
done in 1969 and 1970.

Engineering Test Unit

An Engineering Test Unit for the chemical processing plant will be
built as part of the engineering test unit for the reactor. By the end
of 1970 a layout for this mockup will be fixed. The funds included in
this write-up cover the Title I design and liaison with the architect-
engineer who will make the Title II design. They also cover the operation
of the facility and an engineering development program which will use the
facility as its major tool. The denoted funds do not cover either the
detailed design or the construction of this engineering test unit.

Summary of Development Costs

The total program through the end of 1970 (fiscal year) will cost
about $5,150,000 for support of people and $1,450,000 for- special equipment
and experimental facilities. The program through FY Th is estimated at
$11,300,000 for the support of people and $3,650,000 for special equipment
and experimental facilities,
