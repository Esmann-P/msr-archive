ASSESSMENT OF MOLTEN SALTS AS INTERMEDIATE COOLANTS FOR IMFBR'S

Abstract

Several molten salts were considered as intermediate coolants for
IMFBR's. Included were fluoride, chloride, carbonate, nitrate-nitrite
and fluoroborate salts. Chemical reactions that could occur between
sodium and fluoroborates lead to the conclusion that carbonates might
be a better choice for IMFBRs. Use of carbonates avoids the safety
considerations and related costs that arise from the reactions of
sodium with water if a steam generator fails and with air if a coolant
pipe ruptures. In the absence of these safety considerations, sodium
is clearly superior to the molten salts as an intermediate coolant for
LMFBR's because the lower thermal conductivity and higher viscosity of
the salts would result in higher equipment costs.

ASSESSMENT OF MOLTEN SALTS ‘AS INTERMEDIATE
COOLANTS FOR IMFBR'S

Introduction

The Division of Reactor Development and Technology of the AEC asked
ORNL to assess the use of molten salts as possible coolants for the inter-
mediate loop of an ILMFBR. Consequently, a group consisting of the authors
of ‘this report was constituted to prepare the assessment.

"Initially we assumed that the fluoroborate -fluoride mixtures that
appear to be of most interest for molten salt reactors would be good
choices for LMFBR's, and most of the effort was directed towards evaluat-
ing the use of fluoroborates for fast reactors. Much of a report was pre-
pared discussing fluoroborates and the status of the development program
that will qualify them for use with molten salt reactors.

As the assessment proceeded, it became clear that salts other than

" fluoroborates might be more appropriate for LMFBR's. The report was re-

vised accordingly, but some of the already prepared material on fluoro-

borates was left in because it illustrated the factors that must be con-

sidered in the design of a molten salt intermediate system and indicates

‘the types of development activities that would be required for evaluation

of any molten salt for ILMFBR use.

Summary and Conclusions

 

1. The use of molten salts as heat-transfer media is well-founded

on long-standing technology.

 

=

This report was written in 1968 but not issued as a formal document.
Because of expressions of interest in the subject, it is being issued now
with minor corrections but without revision.
2, The use of lithium-beryllium ‘fluoride in the MSRE has been fully
satisfactory, but it would be desirable for large reactors to have a coolant
that has a lower liquidus temperature and a lower cost.
3. The use of fluoroborate-fluoride salt mixtures appears attractive
for large scale molten salt reactors on the basis of low liquidus tempera-
tures, low cost, low vapor pressure, and good compatibility with Hastelloy
N. Development is in progress in connection with the proposed demonstration
of fluoroborates as suitable intermediate coolants for molten salt reactors.
4. The use of fluoroborate-fluoride salt mixtures as intermediate
coolants for an IMFBR would eliminate the possibility of a violent reaction
of sodium with water due to a leak in the steam generator. However, an
equally exothermic reaction (to give insoluble boron and soluble NaF)

could occur if a leak in the primary heat exchanger allowed sodium to get
into the fluoroborate salt. The implications of such a change in the loca-
tion and nature of a potential hazard need to be considered.

5. The use of molten carbonate salt mixtures for intermediate cool-
ant in LMFBR's deserves serious consideration because of their combination
of low cost, reasonably low liquidus temperatures, low vapor pressure,
compatibility and probable freedom from violent reactions with either
sodium or steam. |

6. Some consideration should be given to the possible use of nitrate-
nitrite heat transfer fluids as intermediate coolants because of the good
match of their physical properties to the temperature range of interest to

LMFBR 's and because of the extensive industrial experience with the ac-
.ceptance of these fluids for heat transfer. Again, the probable exother-
mic reaction of metallic sodium with the melt represents the transfer of
a hazard from the steam generator to the primary heat exchanger.

7. The use of chloride or other fluoride mixtures does not appear
attractive at the present time.

8. An effective program to develop a molten-salt intermediate cool-
ant system for LMFBR's could be performed by ORNL in conjunction with its

present development of coolants for MSBR's.

Requirements for an IMFBR Intermediate Coolant

In assessing intermediate heat transfer fluids it is possible to

group the significant parameters roughly as follows,

Absolute Requirements

 

1. The salt must be compatible with the container materials and
adequately stable to the radiation which it will encounter.

2. The melting point and vapor pressure of the salt must be such
as to permit the system to be operated within the temperature limits
desired.

3. The viscosity and thermal properties must permit the use of
acceptable heat exchangers, steam generators, and coolant pumps.

Lk. The consequences of an accidental mixing of the salt with sodium
or steam must be within the design capabilities and not imply catastropic
situations.

5. The consequences of an accidental cooling of the system must be

reversible.

Trade-Off Requirements

 

1. The corrosion rate of the container should be low.

2. The liquidus temperature of the coolant should be low.

5. The vapor pressure of the system should be low and any condensed
vapor should not be a solid with a high melting point.

4. The viscosity and density of the coolant should be low.

5. The thermal capacity and thermal conductivity of the coolant
should be high. }

6. The price of the coolant should be low.

7. Large amounts of the coolant should be available in high purity.

8. It should be possible to separate the intermediate coolant from
the primary sodium coolant if they are accidentally mixed, and the con-
sequences should not be such as to leave neutron absorbing poisons or
moderating elements in the primary coolant circuit. | |

9. It should be possible to make up for coolant losses due to

radiation decomposition.

 
10. The consequences of mixing the coolant with steam or water
should be easily reversible.

11. A leak of intermediate coolant into the primary coolant circuit
should be readily detectable.

12. Engineering scale experience with the coolant should be available.

It is obvious that questions of economics, maintenance lifetime,
operating inconveniences, etc., are trade-off items which must ultimately
be balanced against the various technical items. There are many such
trade-off items for every coolant considered; it is important not to ex-
clude any candidate from further consideration until it is clear either
that the absolute requirements cannot be met or that the trade-off items

are overwhelmingly unfavorable.

A Survey of Possible Molten-Salt Coolants

 

Fluorides

Many fluoride mixtures meet the absolute requirements stated earlier.
The lithium-beryllium fluoride mixture used in the MSRE was selected be-
cause some of it leaking into the fuel would not contaminate the fuel salt
with nuclides that make it unusable. It was also very satisfactory chem-
ically, and most of its physical properties were acceptable as seen from

inspection of the values in Table 1.

ot
Although the liquidus temperature can be lowered further by the addi-
tion of a higher percentage of beryllium fluoride (as seen from the phase
diagram in Figure 1), this is at the expense of a rapidly increasing
viscosity, which would impose severe economic penalties. The cost and the
inconvenience of dealing with beryllium would handicap the use of lithium-
beryllium fluoride as an intermediate coolant for an IMFBR, and there is
no advantage to using only lithium and beryllium for fast reactor coolants.

Coolant compositions which have liquidus temperatures below 400°C
(752°F) can be found in the NaF-BeF,, system” and in the NaF-LiF-BeF,
system.© In the latter system, temperatures as low as 315°C (599°F) have
been reported. These materials are almost certainly compatible with
Hastelloy-N and possess adequate specific heats and low vapor pressures.
They should not undergo violent reactions on mixing with sodium or water;
sodium should reduce the beryllium to metal and water would generate HF
and precipitate BeO, but these consequences would be reversible by ap-
propriate clean-up treatment except for the possibility of deposition of
metallic beryllium in an inaccessible form. The viscosities of these fluo-
ride salts at low temperatures are certainly higher than are desirable.

It is possible that substitution of ark), or ALF, for some of the BeF, will

provide liquids of lower viscosity at no real eopense in liquidus temperature.

The eutectic composition of lithium-sodium-potassium fluoride (46.5-
11.5-42.0 mole %) melting near 455°C (851°F) is quite well known and should
be relatively stable to mixing with metallic sodium or with water. Its
liquidus temperature is probably too high for consideration.

Stannous (tin II) fluoride, SnF,, which melts at 215°C (419°F), has
been suggested several times as a fuel solvent or coolant in molten salt
technology. It is available in large quantities and in high purity,
largely as a result of its use in toothpaste. We have excluded considera-
tion of it, nevertheless, because of its ease of reduction or, alternatively,
its high oxidizing and corrosive power; it is similar to PF, and BiF, in
this respect and could not be contained in nickel-based or iron-based alloys
but would require something more noble such as molybdenum or graphite.

There are essentially no other fluoride mixtures melting below 400°C

(752°F) which do not contain either beryllium fluoride, hydrogen fluoride,
11

or ammonium fluoride as a component; consequently, it is believed that it
would be unprofitable to concentrate a search in the field of fluorides

beyond the limits already outlined.

Chlorides

Chlorides have always been considered potentially useful heat transfer
fluids.) It would certainly be possible to find mixtures with low liquidus
temperatures and low viscosities. The thermal properties should be com-
petitive with those of fluorides. The vapor pressures are likely to be
higher. The corrosion” and radiation stability are likely to be less
favorable. | oo

Many chloride mixtures are known which melt below 200°C (392°F);
these usually contain a relatively volatile chloride, such as 2rCl,

NoCls, and ALCL, or an easily reduced chloride such as cacl,, PbCl,, or
Gals. Either of these factors makes the mixtures less attractive for
use in an LMFBR. The consequences of accidental leakage of chlorides into
fluoride fuels, sodium, or water are likely to be worse than those of a
fluoride leak. The effect of chlorides on stress corrosion cracking in.
the steam generators would be a matter for considerable concern.

We believe that a satisfactory intermediate IMFBR coolant will not
easily be found among the chloride mixtures and, if one were found, it

would only be after a large development effort to demonstrate compatibility.

Carbonates

Molten carbonate mixtures have been used extensively as heat transfer
baths in metal working, and consideration has been given to their use as
coolants for molten salt reactors.” Due largely to the work of Janz and
his associates at Renssalear Polytechnic Institute” a number of properties
of molten carbonates have been established. Figure 2 presents a phase

diagram of the ternary system Li.CO,-Na_CO,-K.CO The eutectic of the

composition 43.5-31.5-25.0 mole % is reported to melt at 397°C (T47°F) by

Subsequent studies by Janz have indicated that the dissociation pres-
sures over carbonate melts should not exceed one atmosphere in the temper-
ature range of interest (lithium carbonate has a pressure of 501 mm at
843°C (1550°F).

The ternary carbonate mixture has been used for a number of years
and is known to be noncorrosive to steel at 1400°F (760°C) over many
months of exposure; no obvious corrosion was observed after about 4000
hr of exposure at 1200°F (649°C) to INOR-8. In tests at ORNL, Bettis
9

reported” that molten carbonate was apparently stable toward molten lead
at temperatures of 900-1000°F (u482-538°C).

orn, ° has reported the enthalpy and the viscosity of a ternary
carbonate mixture (Li-Na-K, 30-39-32 wt Q) (41-36-23 mole %) over the
temperature range (887-1319°F) L475~715°C with the liquidus temperature
indicated as being near 390°C (734°F). The derived heat capacity of the
salt was 0.413 cal/g°C; the kinematic viscosity, based on efflux-cup

measurements, was reported to be given by the expression
v = 0.024 exp(u4818/T°K) centistokes

and the density was estimated, assuming ideal solution, to be
p = 2.212 — 0.00039 T°C grams cm

From this, the viscosity was calculated to be 33.5 centipoise at 460°C
(860°F) and 5.98 centipoise at 715°C (1319°F). The mixture was proposed
for use in out-of-pile development studies relating to the MSRE because
of its similarity in properties to the fluoride salts and because it is
essentially noncorrosive to stainless steel without a protective atmosphere.
Figure 5 shows the viscosity of this mixture as a function of the tempera-
ture predicted by the early ORNL workers.

Janz and Saegusal have reported considerably lower values for the
viscosity of the ternary eutectic mixture, Li CO,-Na_CO,-K.CO, (40-30-30

These values were reported subsequent to the ORNL values and were measured
with an intrinsically more accurate and precise technique in a laboratory

devoted to measurements on many carbonates. They are much more favorable

with respect to the use of carbonates as coolants.

We are not aware of any reported measurements of the thermal con-
ductivity of molten carbonates, but it is expected that the values will
be near to those for molten nitrates and fluoroborates.

The consequences of an accidental introduction of molten carbonate
into molten fluoride fuel are believed to be intolerable; it is expected
that the carbonate would dissociate, with the carbon dioxide being re-
leased and the residual oxide causing massive precipitation of insoluble

oxides of uranium and thorium. It is likely also that the introduction

of the foreign cations would be essentially irreversible. No direct tests

have been performed to measure the results of mixing of carbonates and

_ fluorides.

The possibility of using carbonates in proximity to metallic sodium
raises less apprehension with respect to the consequences of a leak.
Certainly it would be necessary to remove oxide from the sodium metal in
order to control corrosion, but no dire consequences of a leak of sodium
into the molten carbonate are foreseen. The possibility of a reaction
of metallic sodium with sodium carbonate was examined briefly. t The

reaction
2Na + Ne,CO,(1) = 2Na,0(s) + C0(g)
AF® -20% -131 -47.9
is unfavorable in free energy at 1000°K by about 24 kcal. A leak of

carbonate into the steam generator (although unlikely because of the

pressure differences) would require that the generator be thoroughly

 
16

flushed; this seems feasible since the carbonates are quite soluble in
water. A leak of steam into carbonates would probably be reversible by
side stream treatment with carbon dioxide.

The effects of radiation on molten carbonates, particularly gamma
radiation from a primary sodium coolant fluid, have not been determined.
Since the effects of gamma radiation on molten fluorides and molten
fluoroborates have been found to be negligible, and since carbonates
are thermodynamically quite stable, it is not anticipated that radiation
effects would be severe.

~ If the liquidus temperature as high as T50°F (399°C) would be accept-
able, carbonates would appear to merit serious additional consideration as

intermediate coolants for IMFBR's.

Nitrate-Nitrite Mixtures

 

Many inorganic nitrate-nitrite mixtures have been used as heat
transfer agents for high temperature industrial processes. Mixtures of
commercial interest are illustrated by HTS (Heat Transfer Salt ~ also
DuPont Hitec), a eutectic mixture of NaNO, -KINO, -NalNO,, (7-53-40 wt %)
which has a melting point of 288°F (1k2°C).

HTS has been proposed for use in the temperature range 300 to 1000°F.
Heat transfer and thermal property measurements with HTS were first
reported in 1910.12 The authors: also investigated the corrosion, thermal
stability, and handling of this salt mixture. Hoffman at ORNL has studied
the heat transfer characteristics of HTS flowing by forced convection

15

through circular tubes and reported his results in 1960. The variations
of density and viscosity of HTS with temperature are given by Figure L.
The heat capacity was reported as 0.373 Btu.1b (°F) ~t for the liquid.
Leet er)t.  com-

parison of the effectiveness of several coolants was provided by means

The thermal conductivity was reported as 0.35 Btu hr~

of the "cooling-work modulus" (the flow work per unit heat removal) de-
rived by Rosenthal, Poppendiek, and Burnett. Hoffman has reported such
a comparison of coolants in Figure 5, with the properties of HTS extra-
polated to 1350°F for consistency. This comparison shows that HTS requires
10-20 times the pumping power required for sodium or FLINAK (NaF-LiF-KF

eutectic).

Irradiation of HTS to a dose of 3.3 x 1018 thermal neutrons /cm®
and an accompanying epithermal dose of somewhat less than half the thermal
- dose was reported by Hoffmen to have been performed by O. Sisman of ORNL.
The irradiated samples were said to have become more hygroscopic, and some
breakdown to gaseous products was reported. As a consequence of high-
temperature thermal breakdown or radiation-thermal breakdown it would
seem appropriate to arrange treatment of a bypass stream with N05 or
N,0; to regenerate the desired composition, but this was considered to
‘pose no more difficult engineering problems than those involved in the
use of organic coolants.

A leak of sodium into an HTS salt mixture would cause an exothermic
reaction to form sodium oxide and liberate nitrogen or nitrogen oxides.
‘The heat liberated would be of the same order of magnitude of that in-
volved in the sodium-water reaction. The chemical consequences in the
salt would be reversible by treatment with nitrogen oxides. If salt
leaked into the primary sodium system of an ILMFBR, a similar reaction
would occur and the resulting sodium oxide would have to be removed by
appropriate traps.

The nitrate-nitrite salts appear to present no insurmountable dif-
ficulties, but their use would involve a number of disadvantages in the
trade-off area. Whether their compatibility with structural materials
and the large industrial use which they have enjoyed for heat transfer

purposes is sufficient to offset these disadvantages is a question to be

resolved by more detailed engineering evaluation.

Fluoroborates

After a survey of the materials considered available, it appeared
that fluoroborates, especially a mixture of sodium fluoroborate and sodium
fluoride, offered the greatest promise for development as intermediate
coolants for molten salt reactors. Liquidus temperatures as low as 380°C
" (716°F) were available. The cost of materials is known to be very low
(less than $0.50/1b for material of high purity). The vapor pressure of
BF, above the melts has been found to be relatively low (less than one

3

atmosphere). The corrosiveness of the material to Hastelloy-N appears to

 
20

be low. No violent exothermic reactions occur when fluoroborates are

mixed with steam or with fluoride fuel salts. In fact, it has been dis-
covered that fluoroborates are essentially immiscible with molten mixtures
of lithium and beryllium fluorides. Uranium and other tri- and tetravalent
elements were not extracted into fluoroborates, and no high-melting com-
pounds were found when sodium fluoroborate was equilibrated with a fluoride
salt mixture of LiF-BeF,-UF) -ThF; . Operation of a test loop (containing
residues of this fluoride salt) with a flushing charge of NaF -NaBF) did,
however, reveal the deposition of a green salt in the upper region of the
pump bowl. The composition of the salt was essentially NaF *6(Th,U)F, ,
suggesting that either entrainment of the residue or solution-deposition
of it had occurred, along with some replacement of Li by Na; although more
study of the immiscibility phenomenon is indicated, there:is no informa-
tion available to cause alarm over the possibility of accidental mixing

of fluoroborates with fluoride salts. For MSBR use, moreover, the ac-
cidental introduction of fluoroborates into the circulating fuel would
cause. a large reactivity decrease because of the boron, and thus even a
small leak would be quickly detected. The boron could be easily removed
from the fuel salt by treatment with HF.

.For IMFBR use, a leak of sodium into the fluoroborate would be ex-
pected to result in immediate and complete reaction to produce sodium
fluoride and elemental boron.” In early work, boron trifluoride was .
reported to have been passed over red-hot potassium in a gun barrel to
produce boron and KF, and metallic sodium or potassium heated in boron
trifluoride were reported to react with the production of fire to give
boron and the metallic fluoride. Calculations suggest that the heat
liberated when sodium metal reacts with sodium fluoroborate will be about
105 kcal per mole of sodium fluoroborate, or 1.5 kcal per gram of sodium
introduced. Introduction of one gram of sodium into 100 grams of the
NaF-NaBF; mixture would be expected to raise its temperature by 43°C (109°F).
The amount of heat involved in injecting sodium into sodium fluoroborate
is almost the same as the amount involved in adding sodium to water (1.48
kcal per gram of sodium); thus the magnitude of this problem would be

about the same but the location would be shifted from the steam generator

 
21

to the intermediate heat exchanger; the consequences would not involve the
liberation of hydrogen but would involve the addition of radioactive sodium
to the intermediate coolant. The consequences of injecting sodium fluoro-
borate into the primary sodium stream would be similar to the reverse; the
‘removal of the boron might be difficult if it were produced in a finely

divided form and dispersed throughout the coolant.

Evaluation of Fluoroborates to Illustrate use of
Molten Salts for IMFBR's

 

 

As indicated in the introduction, the original plan for the assessment
of molten salts as intermediate coolants for LMFBR use was based on the as-
sumption that fluoroborates might be the most worthy candidates. Conse-
quently, an attempt was made to evaluate fluoroborates from an engineering
and design point of view. Although it now appears that carbonates may
possibly prove to be more favorable than fluoroborates for IMFBR use, the
evaluation of fluoroborates is presented to illustrate the type of problems
which are sure to be encountered and the design and engineering factors
which will have to be taken into account in using any molten salt for the

intermediate coolant of an IMFER.

Suitability of Coolant Salt for Operating Conditions of
LMFBR Cycle and Engineering Design Changes Required
for Its Use

 

 

General - If all the components of an MSBR intermediate system using
sodium fluoroborate as the circulated coolant were fully developed, this
same secondary system would be applicable to an LMFBR power plant without
significant changes in the operating conditions or without raising major
new development problems in the fluid dynamics or heat transfer.

| As will be explained below, substitution of the MSBR coolant salt for
sodium as the secondary coolant for the IMFBR could narrow the freedom of
choice of steam conditions and feedwater temperatures, and could affect
the circulation rates in both the secondary and steam circuits, but these
changes should not impose particular operating difficulties nor should

they be detrimental to the overall plant thermal efficiency.

 
22

To judge the effects of using sodium fluoroborate rather than sodium,
the performances of the two systems can be roughly compared. For the pur-
poses. of this survey, the properties of the two coolants were assumed to
be as shown in Table 2. - The values for the salt will need later adjust-
ment as more physical property data become available, but it is believed
that the values shown are sufficiently reliable for some generalized

conclusions to be drawn.

"Recent measurements of NaBF, viscosity by Mound Laboratory
gave values of 2.4 to 4.8 1b/hr-ft in the temperature range of
interest. The mixture with NaF should also be at least this low
in viscosity.

Even though there is uncertainty in the properties of the sodium
fluoroborate, it is nevertheless clear that the differences between the
properties of the salt and those of sodium are sufficient to cause design
optimization studies to yield different numbers of modules, arrangement of
heat transfer surfaces, and circulation rates in both the secondary and
steam Systems. A numerical comparison of equipment costs and operating
performances would therefore be dependent upon optimization studies which
are beyond the scope of this survey. There are, however, some trends in

the design aspects which can be briefly mentioned.
25

Operating Temperatures - The use of fluoroborate instead of sodium

 

would not impose any limitation on the high temperature side of the sec-
ondary system; this temperature would only be limited by the allowable
temperature in the primary system, which, in turn, might be set by the
compatibility of the fuel element with the primary sodium. The properties
of fluoroborate salt, however, affect the choice of the lower temperature
limit and the temperatures of inlet steam and/or water in the steam gen-
erating part of the system. Figure 6 illustrates an assumed LMFBR flow-
sheet based on sodium and Figure 7.illustrates an assumed MSBR secondary
system. 1° The operating temperatures of these two flowsheets are not the
same, but they are shown to illustrate the additional complexity which
might be introduced by the use of salt. i
A property of the salt which may impose lower temperature limitations
is its liquidus temperature (71l6°F, 380°C). This is actually below the
lowest sodium temperature shown in Figure 6 (725°F), but there would always
be some risk of freezing salt in the tubes if the inlet water or inlet
steam were much below the liquidus temperature. Figure 7 illustrates how
this contingency could be avoided by degrading some of the 1000°F steam
from the boiler-superheater to reheat steam in the preheater and to mix
with entering water ahead of the pump; the entering water would thereby
be raised to 700°F, and the entering steam to 650°F. These temperatures
are less than TO°F below the liquidus temperature, and it is believed
that the inevitable temperature gradient across the tube wall would pre-
vent the occurrence of temperatures low enough to freeze any salt.
Accordingly, the cycle shown in Figure 7, perhaps with some reduction
in the throttle temperature, could probably be used in an IMFBR plant,
particularly since at least one preliminary study has indicated that super-
critical pressure steam may be economically desirable for a high tempera-
ture LMFBR in any event. }
Additional study and testing will be required to decide just how low
in temperature the inlet steam and water may be permitted to go without

freezing salt in the tubes.

Primary Heat Exchanger - Even though the heat transfer properties of

 

sodium fluoroborate are generally considered good as compared with many
heat transport fluids, they are not so good as sodium, and the effect of
the change on the heat transfer coefficients and area requirements could
be marked.

A primary exchanger designed for sodium-to-salt heat transfer could
require about 50% more surface than a sodium-to-sodium unit, assuming that
about the same velocity of 10 ft/sec were used inside the tubes in each
case. To achieve essentially the same velocity requires a different de-
sign, however, in that the volumetric flow requirement of the salt is
only about 37% of that needed for sodium for the same heat transport
capacity. In order to maintain the velocity with a smaller volumetric
flow rate, fewer tubes or ones of a smaller diameter must be used, either
of which would increase the pressure drop through the exchanger. For
example, if 1/2-in. OD tubes were used instead of the 3/L-in. tubes used
in the sodium system, the salt velocity would be about 10 ft/sec compared
to 11 ft/sec for the sodium in the larger tubes, but the loss of head due
to flow of the salt would be about 2.7 times that for sodium.

The above-mentioned effects of using sodium fluoroborate rather than
sodium in the IMFBR primary heat exchanger would not be as pronounced if
enhanced heat-transfer tubing were used. When using helically grooved
type tubing, for example, the heat transfer film coefficient on the inside
might be approximately doubled (enhanced heat transfer has been demonstrated
with water but not yet with salt for such tubing), although for a given
length of tubing the Ap would also be about doubled. If this type of tubing
were used, the primary heat exchanger surface area requirements might be
about the same in both the sodium and salt systems. In this case the pres-
sure drop of the salt system would be more than twice as great as that in
the sodium loop. This situation represents a logical application of en-
hanced type of surfaces and would merit serious study and development.

If the primary heat exchanger is made appreciably larger due to the
effects mentioned above, there would be some increase in the inventory of

primary sodium.

 
27

Design of a sodium-to-fluoroborate IMFBR primary heat exchanger pro-
bably would require that surfaces in contact with the fluoroborate be
fabricated of Hastelloy-N, some other high-nickel alloy, or nickel metal.
~ The material cost of Hastelloy-N could be about twice as much as that of
the stainless steel used in sodium-to-sodium exchangers, although labor
and other fabrication costs would not be greatly different. If, as sug-
gested above, the surface requirements for the sodium-to-salt exchanger
are also significantly greater, then the cost difference between the two
types of units would be accentuated.

It must be emphasized that all the above comments regarding the rela-
tive performances of the primary heat exchangers are based on assumed pro-
perties for the sodium fluoroborate salt. The viscosity of the sodium
fluoroborate over the temperature range of interest is particularly un-
certain and could have a major effect on the estimates. As noted above,
our most recent information suggests that the viscosity of pure sodium
fluoroborate may be between 1 and 2 centipoise (2.4 to 4.8 1b/hr-ft) in
the temperature range of interest. Additional study will be required to
confirm these results and to extend them to cover mixtures of sodium
fluoride with sodium fluoroborate.

The overall result of the above-mentioned factors is that if salt
rather than sodium is used as the secondary coolant, the cost of the
primary salt exchangers could be greater, both through the need for more
surface and from more expensive type of tubing and tubing material. Pri-
mary sodium inventory could be increased, and cell dimensions may need to
be expanded to accommodate larger units. The pumping power requirements,

but not the volumetric flow rate, might also be increased.

Steam Generator and Reheater - In the evaporator portion of a sub-.

 

critical pressure steam generator the outside film coefficient of heat
transfer when Using sodium fluoroborate might be only about one-eighth of
that which could be obtained by using sodium. The overall coefficient of
heat transfer could be in the order of 60% of that obtained in a sodium-
to-water evaporator. While not investigated in this survey, it can be
presumed that the same difference in performance would exist if the steam

pressure were supercritical.
28

In the superheating region of the steam generator the outside film
coefficient for sodium fluoroborate might be about one-seventh that in a
sodium-to-steam exchanger, and the overall heat transfer coefficient again
about 60% of that in a sodium exchanger.

In the reheater, the salt film coefficient might be only about one-
eighth the sodium film coefficient in a sodium-to-steam unit. In this
case the steam-side film coefficient should be controlling and the effect
on the overall heat transfer coefficient would not be as great. It was
estimated that the overall coefficient of the salt unit would be about 75%
of that for sodium. In this case there would be little or no incentive
for use of enhanced type of heat transfer tubing.

The temperature difference between the incoming feedwater to the
evaporator section of the steam generator and the salt or sodium tempera.-
ture on the shell side is important in the design of the equipment, from
the standpoint of the thermal stress induced by the thermal gradient across
the tube wall. This difference must also be controlled in order to avoid

freezing the coolant salt but the allowable value has not been established.
This problem has been briefly discussed above. The situation is not unique
to the salt coolant, however, in that, as may be noted in the sodium system
shown in Figure 6, the evaporator is supplied with L4T8°F feedwater and has
an exit sodium temperature of 725°F, suggesting either that this particular
set of conditions will not be satisfactory from a thermal stress stand-
point in the present IMFBR design or that our MSBR designs are too
conservative. |

As with the primary heat exchangers, if it is determined that Hastelloy
N is required for compatibility with the sodium fluoroborate, the manu-
facturing cost of the steam generators and reheaters could be significantly
greater, both from the materials cost and the requirement for somewhat more
heat transfer surface. On the other hand, there could be substantial sav-
ings in the complexity and cost of the units through elimination of the
special arrangements to accommodate a sodium-water reaction. While some
pressure-relief system is needed on the intermediate circulating system
in any event to prevent pressures in the steam system from being trans-
mitted to the primary heat exchanger, this system might be less elaborate

for the salt loop since no chemical release of energy would be involved

 
29

and it would not be necessary to dispose of hydrogen gas. These cost
effects are offsetting, and it is possible that the overall difference
in equipment costs between the two coolant choices are not so important

as other considerations in comparing the two.

Piping - The volumetric flow rate of the salt need be only 37% of
that of sodium to obtain the same heat transport capacity. If the same
pipe sizes were used in both systems, the salt velocity would be corre-
spondingly lower and the pumping effort would perhaps be about 43% that
in a sodium system. If the salt system were designed for about the same
velocity as used in sodium piping, typically a 15-in. pipe would be used
instead of a 24-in. sodium pipe, but in this case the loss of head due to
friction in the piping might be about 1.35 times as great. The optimum
design for a salt system would likely fall somewhere in between these
extremes. These effects are probably not of great Consequence in com-

paring the two coolants.

Circulating-Pump Power Requirements - If optimization studies were

 

made of an IMFBR system using sodium fluoroborate in the intermediate
system, it would probably be determined that the velocities of the salt
should be as high or higher than those of sodium. If this is true, the
total head requirements on the pump could be twice as great for the salt
system. Even though the mass flow rate of the salt need be only 80% of
that required for sodium, the difference in the pumping effort is sub-
stantial. While this is undesirable, it is probably not of over-riding

importance in considering the suitability of the salt as a coolant.

Heat Systems - Both the sodium and fluoroborate intermediate cooling
systems would require provisions for maintaining the coolant above the
freezing point. The melting temperature of about 200°F (93°C) for sodium
would be easier to maintain by electrically heated tracers than the 716°F
(380°C) needed for salt systems, but the difference is one of the amount
of heat rather than the presence or absence of a tracer heat system. The
heat loss from either system would be about the same. (In this connection,
a heated cell has been considered in some MSBR design studies in contrast

to the use of tracers on piping and equipment.)

 
30

Compatibility with ILMFBR Materials Including
Effects of Radiation -

 

 

The tests now in progress suggest that fluoroborates are compatible
with Hastelloy-N. If Hastelloy-N were chosen as the material for the
secondary coolant circuit of an IMFBR, two problems would be presented:
it is compatible with steam and is it compatible with sodium?  - With re-
spect to the first, compatibility with steam, a test program is underway
in which ORNL and TVA are cooperating to test Hastelloy-N with supercritical
steam in the Bull Run Steam Plant. One advantage of Hastelloy-N for steam
service is that the alloy is not susceptible to stress-corrosion cracking
under conditions where serious problems have resulted in stainless steel.
With respect to compatibility with sodium, extensive studies were made in
the early stages of the molten salt development program. The results were

summarized in the MSBR Status Report of 1958 (Ref. 18) as follows:

"The effect of sodium on the structural materials of
interest has also been extensively studied, since sodium is
proposed for use as the intermediate heat transfer medium.
Corrosion problems inherent in the utilization of sodium
for heat transfer purposes do not involve so much the
deterioration of the metal surfaces as the tendency for
components of the container material to be transported
from hot to cold regions and to form plugs of deposited
material in the cold region. As in the case of the cor-
rosion by the salt mixture, the mass transfer in sodium-
containing systems is extremely dependent on the maximum
system operating temperature. The results of numerous
tests indicate that the nickel-base alloys such as Inconel
and INOR-8, are satisfactory containers for sodium at
temperatures below 1300°F and that above 1300°F the aus-
tenitic stainless steels are preferable."

 

*
Recent experiments indicate that the specific corrosion rate depends

upon the water content of the salt. ' For example, the corrosion rate in a
‘thermal convection loop at a peak temperature of 1125°F (607°C) was about
0.35 mpy when the salt contained LOO ppm water and 0.75 mpy when 1000 ppm
water was present. Although these corrosion rates are not very high, they
do indicate that a process will have to be developed for on-stream re-
moval of moisture from the sodium fluoroborate coolant circuit. This
process, which will likely consist of bubbling HF or BF through a side
"stream of the salt, is currently under development.

 
51

This early assessment of nickel-base alloy performance in sodium has now

19

been confirmed in recent British ~ and Russian®® studies. . Also Atomics
International and ORNL have completed extensive tests of Hastelloy-N in
NaK9Na-K, 30-70 wt %) extending to lower temperature which show that mass
transfer rate of the alloy at 350°F is only slightly greater than that

of type 316 stainless steel?! Thus, since the secondary coolant temper-
atures of the IMFBR are limited to a maximum of about 1100°F, it is likely
that Inconel or Hastelloy-N would be compatible with sodium.

The effects of radiation in an LMFBR are likely to be much less
serious than those in a molten salt reactor, since the fluoroborate would
be exposed only to the gamma flux from the radicactive sodium in the pri-
mary circuit. ‘Experiments at ORNL have exposed the eutectic NaBF; -NaF
mixture at 600°C to the gamma radiation from decaying HFIR fuel elements
to a total dose of 7.7 x 10-0r with an average intensity of 0.15 v/g and
a maximum intensity of 0.5 w/e. (The average intensity of absorbed gamma
radiation estimated for the MSBR heat exchangers is around 0.25 w/g). The
salt was contained in a Hastelloy-N capsule. Examination following the
irradiation revealed no evidence of radiation decomposition of fluoroborate

and no incompatibility with the Hastelloy-N.o2

Effects of Safety and Accident Conditions

 

As noted earlier, sodium is expected to react quite exothermically
with fluoroborates to produce boron, sodium fluoride, and approximately
1.5 kilocalories per gram of sodium. No gaseous products of the reaction
are foreseen, but the liberated heat could cause the vapor pressure of BF,
to rise locally, the amount depending on the ratio of sodium to fluoroborate
and the rate of the reaction. No experimental studies have yet been made
of this reaction.

A leak of fluoroborate from the intermediate coolant system to the
outisde would release some BF, a toxic gas which is essentially equivalent
to HF in its properties. As the salt cooled it would solidify, trapping
any contained radioactive impurities. The fluoroborate salts are very

soluble in water and can easily be dissolved and flushed away from the

area of a spill.
30

A leak of steam into the fluoroborate would cause some hydrolysis of
the material with the release of HF. This reaction should be reversible
by side-stream treatment with BF

or HF-BF;3 studies of this reaction will

A leak of fluoroborate into the steam generator is unlikely because
of the pressure differential which is expected. However; if one occurred,
the solubility of the fluoroborate would permit its easy removal. The
effect of fluoride on corrosion of the steam generator has not yet been
assessed; fluorides do contribute to stress corrosion cracking, but their
effect is much less serious than that of chlorides.

Leakage of fluoroborate into the primary system of an IMFBR would be
expected to give rise to circulating, elemental boron which should result
in detectable changes in reactivity. Boron is said not to dissolve .in
boiling sodium (b.p. 880°C), but the reference is quite 01d.’ Tt would
+ be important to study the production of boron and its distribution within
the primary system, and to develop techniques for preventing the reaction
or for the removal of the boron. (The difference in density, 2.3 for
crystalline or 1.73 for amorphous boron, vs 0.97 for sodium might facili-

tate separation or removal.)

Availability and Cost of Fluoroborate

Fluoroborate production technology is sufficiently well-developed that

incentives to assure its availability are not needed. Several producers of

industrial chemicals can now supply sufficient quantities to fill foresee-
able needs of the U.S. breeder reactor program. Sodium fluoroborate of
high quality is currently available at low prices as a consequence of its
use in industrial electroplating processes. We have recently obtained
2400 1b of NaBF, , of greater than 99% purity at a cost of $0.50 per pound.
That cost included a $0.05 per pound charge for a minor process modifica-
tion which was introduced in order to obtain a product which contained
<200 ppm oxygen. Chemical analysis of the material showed that it ex-

ceeded the following specifications:

 

 
55

NaBF), 99.08%
0, 0.025%
Pb 0.004%
Si 0.01%
Ca 0.01%
Fe 0.023%
2,0 insol. <0.01%
H,0 0.01%

The compound was synthesized from borax and hydrogen fluoride as starting
materials. As anhydrous technical grade chemicals, these materials cost
$88 per ton and $0.18 per pound, respectively. Since these costs appear
to be the principal variables in the final cost of the coolant cost, it
is anticipated that the cost of coolant salt relative to overall reactor

costs will remain very low and essentially constant in the future.

Development Requirements for IMFBR use on Molten Salts

 

Cycle Choice

Additional study and development would be required to select the
best steam cycle. Factors favoring the supercritical cycle include the
higher thermal efficiency which may be achieved, the raising of the feed-
water temperature which lowers the risk of freezing salt and reduces the
thermal stresses on the tube wall, and the possibility that the steam
generator could be designed with more confidence in the prediction of the

internal operating conditions.

Development Program for the MSBR

 

The work planned for the MSBR illustrates the type of study which
would be necessary for the LMFBR. It includes study of the following

items as noted.

Steam Generator Tests - To obtain information necessary to design

 

equipment for generating superheated steam at subcritical and super-

critical pressures and for reheating steam by use of molten salt coolants.
3h

Heat Transfer Enhancement - To study the effects of changes in the

 

tube shapes as a means for improving the efficiency of heat transfer and
the predictability of heat transfer as well as lowering the capital cost

and salt inventory.

Pressure Relief System - To determine how much simplification can be

 

achieved as a result of the absence of the possibility of a sodium-steam

reaction and the necessity of disposing of hydrogen.

Fundamental Molten Salt Heat Transfer - To improve and extend our

 

knowledge of the technology, particularly with respect to engineering
factors such as transfer coefficients, pressure drop, effects of possible
corrosion and scale deposits on the tubes, and effects of wetting and

interfacial deposits.

Chemical Factors - Including choice of composition for minimum
liquidus temperature, procurement or purification of commercial material,
study of steam and sodium reactions with fluoroborates, study of on-site
repurification by batch or side-stream stream, and more precise determina-

tion of all relevant physical properties.

Evaluation of Carbonates for ILMFBR Use

 

Many of the questions which would need attention are’ the same as
‘those now under study as part of the ORNL development of fluoroborates.
The outstanding needs seem to be for an evaluation of the heat transfer
and physical properties of carbonate mixtures, for a more accurate deter-
mination of the liquidus temperature in the three component system,
lithium carbonate-sodium carbonate-potassium carbonate, which is of basic
interest, and for study of the possibility of further lowering the liquidus
temperatures by the addition of fourth components to the system. Of sec-
ondary importance would appear to be such chemical factors as purification,
results of mixing with sodium or steam, reactions with container materials,

and effects of gamma radiation.
