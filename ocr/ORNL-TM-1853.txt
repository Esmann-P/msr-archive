CHEMICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR MOLTEN-

SALT BREEDER REACTORS
W. R. Grimes

ABSTRACT

# Results of the 15-year program of chemical research and develop~
= Jd ment for molten salt reactors are summarized in this document. These
. results indicate that TLiF-BeFp-UF), mixtures are feasible fuels for
thermal breeder reactors. Such mixtures show satisfactory phase be-
havior, they are compatible with Hastelloy N and moderator graphite,
and they appear to resist radiation and tolerate fission product ac-
cumulation. Mixtures of TLiF-BeFo-ThF), similarly appear suitable as
blankets for such machines. Several possible secondary coolant mix-
tures are available; NaF-NaBF3 systems seem, at present, to be the

most likely possibility.

Gaps in the technology are presented along with the accomplish-
ments, and an attempt is made to define the information (and the
research and development program) needed before a Molten Salt Thermal
Breeder can be operated with confidence.

CHEMICAL RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR MOLTEN-

SALT BREEDER REACTORS

Use of molten fluorides as fuels, blankets, and coolants offers a
promising and versatile route to thorium breeder reactors. Mixtures con-
taining fissile and/or fertile materials have been studied in consider-
able detail, and shown to possess liquidus temperatures, phase stability,
and physical properties which are suitable for the purpose. These fluo-
ride mixtures appear to be compatible with structural metals and with
graphite suitable for use in a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor; such compati-
bility seems assured under irradiation at MSBR conditions. Cheap, low-
melting fluoride coolants for MSBR have not yet been demonstrated but
promising leads are available; the relative simplicity of the coolant
problem lends assurance that a reasonable solution can be found.

A reference design for a 1000 MW(e) Molten Salt Breeder Reactor has
recently been published.’ The state of knowledge of molten salts as
materials for use in that reactor and in attractive alternatives or
improvements is described in some detail in the following pages. An at-
tempt is made to define those areas where additional knowledge is neces-
sary or very desirable and to estimate the effort required to obtain this
knowledge for a molten salt breeder reactor and a breeder reactor experi-
ment.

SELECTION OF MSBR SALT MIXTURESZ™>
General Requirements for the Fluids

A molten salt reactor makes the following stringent minimum demands

upon its fluid fuel. The fuel must consist of elements of low (and prefer-

 
 

 

 

ably very low) capture cross section for neutrons typical of the energy
spectrum of the chosen design. The fuel must dissolve more than the
critical concentration of fissionable material at temperatures safely be-
low the temperature at which the fuel leaves the heat exchanger. The mix-
ture must be thermally stable and its vapor pressure must be low over the
operating temperature range. The fuel mixture must possess heat transfer
and hydrodynamic properties adequate for its service as a heat-exchange
fluid. It must be relatively non-aggressive toward some otherwise suit-
able material--presumebly a metal--of construction and toward some. suit-
eble moderator material. The fuel must be stable toward reactor radie-
tion, must be able to survive fission of the uranium--or other fissionable
material--and must tolerate fission product accumulation without serious
deterioration of its useful properties.

If such reactors are to produce economical power we must add to this.
list the need for reactor temperatures sufficiently high to achieve
genuinely high quality steam, and we must provide a suitable link (a
secondary coolant) between the fuel circuit and the steam system. We
must also be assured of a genuinely low fuel cycle cost; this presupposes
a cheap fuel and an effective turn-around of the unburned fissionable
material or (more reasonably) an effective and economical decontamination
and reprocessing scheme for the fuel.

If the reactor is to be a breeder we must impose even more stringent
limits on permissible parasitic neutron captures by the reactor materials
and provide sufficient fertile material either in a breeder blanket or in

the fuel (or in both). If a blanket is used it must be separated from
ty ©
C

 

the fuel by some material of very low neutron cross section.

The demands imposed upon the coolant and blanket fluids differ in
obvious ways from those imposed upon the fuel system. Radiation intensity
will be considerably less in the blanket--and markedly less in the cool-
ant--than in the fuel. Efficiency of the blanket mixture as a heat trans-
fer agent may be relatively unimportant, but a high concentration of
fertile material is essential and an effective recovery of bred material
is likely to be vital.

Choice of Fuel and Blanket Composition
General Considerations

The compounds which are permissible major constituents of fuels or
blankets for thermal breeders are those that can be prepared from beryl-
lium, bismuth, boron-11, carbon, deuterium, fluorine, lithium-T7, nitro-
gen-15, oxygen, and the fissionable and fertile isotopes. As minor
constituents one can probably tolerate compounds containing the elements
listed in Table 1.

Of the known compounds containing useful concentrations of hydrogen
(or deuterium) only the hydroxides of the alkali metals, the saline hy-
drides of lithium and calcium, and certain interstitial hydrides (zir-
conium hydride, for example) show adequate thermal stability in the 1000°F
to 1300°F temperature range. [Acid fluorides (NaHF,, for example] might
be permissible in low concentrations at lower temperatures.] The hy-
drides are very strong reducing agents and are most unlikely to be useful
components of any uraniferous liquid fuel system. Alkali hydroxides dis-
solve extremely small quantities of uranium compounds at useful reactor

temperatures and are very corrosive to virtually all useful metals at

 
 

 

 

such temperatures. One concludes, therefore, that hydrogen-rich: com=-
pounds, which might provide self-moderation to molten fuels, are not use-
ful in practical fuel or blanket mixtures.
The non-metals carbon, nitrogen, silicon, sulfur, phosphorus, and
oxygen each form only high melting and generally unsuitable binary com-
pounds with the metals of Table 1. From these non-metals, however, a
wide variety of oxygenated anions are available. Nitrates, nitrites,
sulfates, and sulfites can be dismissed as lacking adequate thermal sta-
bility; silicates can be dismissed because of undesirably high viscosi-
ties. Phosphates, borates, and carbonates are not so easy to eliminate
without study, and phosphates have, in fact, received some attention.
The several problems of thermal stability, corrosion, solubility of urani-
un and thorium compounds, and, especially, radiation stability would seem s
to make the use of any such compounds very doubtful. : ~
When the oxygenated anions are eliminated only fluorides and
chlorides remain. Chlorides offer mixtures that are, in general, lower
melting than fluorides; in addition UCl3 is probably more stable than UF3
with respect to the analogous tetravalent compounds. For thermal reactors,
fluorides appear much more suitable for reasons which include (1) useful-
ness of the element without isotope separation, (2) better neutron
economy, (3) higher chemical stability, (L4) lower vapor pressure, and
(5) higher heat capacity per unit weight or volume. Fluoride mixtures
are, accordingly, preferred as fuel and blanket mixtures for thermal
reactors. The fluoride ion is capable of some moderation of neutrons;
this moderation is insufficient for thermal reactors with cores of reason- —_

able size. An additional moderator material is, accordingly, required.

Choice of Active Material

Uranium Fluoride. - Uranium hexafluoride is a highly volatile com-
pound clearly unsuited as a. component of high-temperature liquids. UOoFs,
though relatively nonvolatile, is a strong oxidant which should prove
very difficult to contain. Fluorides of pentavalent uranium (UF, Uo Fg»
etc.) are not thermally stable and should prove prohibitively corrosive
if they could be stabilized in solution.

Uranium tetrafluoride (UF),) is a relatively stable, non-volatile,
non-hygroscopic material, which is readily prepared in high purity. It
melts at 1035°C, but this freezing point is markedly depressed by several
useful diluent fluorides. Uranium trifluoride (UF) is stable, under
inert atmospheres, to temperatures above 1000°C, but it disproportionates

at higher temperatures by the reaction
o
hur, $ 3UF), + U.
Uranium trifluoride is appreciably less stable in molten fluoride solu-

L,5

tions. It is tolerable in reactor fuels only insofar as the equilibri-

un activity of uranium metal is sufficiently low to avoid reaction with

>

the moderator graphite or alloying with the container metal. Appreciable

concentrations of UF, (see below) are tolerable in LiF-BeF, mixtures such
as those used in MSRE and proposed for MSBR. In general, however, uranium
tetrafluoride must be the major uraniferous compound in the fuel.

Thorium Fluoride. - All the normal compounds of thorium are quadri-
valent; ThF) (melting at 1115°C) must be used in any thorium-bearing

fluoride melt. Fortunately, the marked freezing point depression by use-

ful diluents noted sbove for uranium tetrafluoride applies also to thorium
 

9

C

tetrafluoride.
Choice of Fluoride Diluents

The fuel systems for thermal reactors of the MSRE and MSBR types
require low concentrations (0.2 to 1 mole %) of uranium, and the proper-
ties (especially the melting temperature) of such fuels will be essential-
ly those of the diluent mixture. Blanket mixtures (and perhaps fuel
systems for one-region breeders) will require considerable concentrations
of high-melting ThF),. The fuels must, if they are to be compatible with
large steam turbines, be completely molten at 9T75°F (525°C).

Simple consideration of the nuclear properties leads one to prefer

T

as diluents the fluorides of Be, Bi, 'Li, Mg, Pb, Zr, Ca, Na, and Sn (in

that order). Equally simple considerations (Table 2) of the stability of
6,7

diluent fluorides toward reduction by common structural metals, how-
ever, serve to eliminate BiF,, PbF,, and probably SoF, from consideration.

No single fluoride can serve as a useful diluent for the active
fluorides. BeF, is the only stable compound listed whose melting point
is close to the required level; this compound is too viscous for use in
the pure state.

The very stable fluorides of the alkaline earths and of yttrium and
cerium do not seem to be useful major constituents of low melting fluids.
Mixtures containing about 10 mole % of alkaline earth fluoride with BeF,
melt below 500°C, but the viscosity of such melts is certainly too high
for serious consideration. |

Some of the possible combinations of alkali fluorides have suitable

freezing points.d Equimolar mixtures of LiF and KF melt at 490°C, and

mixtures with 40 mole % LiF and 60 mole % RbF melt at 470°C. The ternary

these binaries. .All these systems will dissolve UF), at concentrations up
to several mole % at temperatures below 525°C. They might well prove use-
ful es reactor fuels if no mixtures with more attractive properties were
available. .

Mixtures with useful melting points over relatively wide ranges of
composition are available if ZrF) is a major component of the system.
Phase relationships NeF-ZrF, system show low melting points over the
interval 40 to 55 mole % ZrF) . A mixture of UF), with NaF and ZrF), served
as fule for the Aircraft Reactor Experiment. |

| The lowest melting binary mixtures of the usable diluent fluorides

are those containing BeF, with NaF or rir.8 (The ternary system

LiF-NaF-BeF, has been examined in some detail, but it seems to have no

important advantage over either binary.) ‘Since Be offers the best cross

7

section of the diluents (and 'Li ranks very high), fuels based on the

LiF-BeF, diluent system were chosen for MSRE and are proposed for MSBR.

2
The binary system LiF-BeF, has melting points below 500°C over the

concentration range from 33 to 80 mole % Ber. The presently. accepted
LiF-BeF, system diagram, presented in Fig. 1, is characterized by a single

eutectic (52 mole % BeF,, melting at 360°C) between BeF,, and 2LiF-BeF,,.

The compound 2LiF-BeF, melts incongruently to LiF and liquid at L58°cC.

LiF-BeF, is formed by the reaction of solid BeF, and solid 2LiF-BeF, be-

low 280°C.

ThF) end UF) form a continuous series of solid solutions with neither

- maximum nor minimum. The LiF-ThF) -UF) system (see Fig. 7) shows no ter-

nary compounds and a single eutecticld (which contains 1.5 mole % ThF),
with 26.5 mole % UF), and freezes at 488°C). Most of the area on the dia-

gram is occupied by primary phase fields of the solid solutions UF) -ThF) ,

LiF-WUF)-LiF TDF), and LiF-UF)-LiF-ThF). Liquidus temperatures decrease,

generally, to the LiF-UF), edge of the diagram.

It is clear from exemination of the diagrams shown that fuel systems

melting below 500°C are available over a wide range of compositions in the

LiF-BeF,-UF, system. Since (see Fig. 6) wp to 28 mole % of ThF) can be
melted at temperatures below 1100°F, blanket systems with very large ThF),
concentrations can be obtained. Moreover, the very great similarity in
behavior of ThF), and UF), permits fractional replacement of ThF) by UF), with
little effect on freezing temperature over the composition range of .
interest as fuel. Fuels for single region reactors should, accordingly,
be svaileble in the LiF-BeF,~ThF)-UF, quaternary system. |
Phase behavior in the ternary systems LiF-BeF,~UF), and LiF-BeF,,~ThF),
has, as a consequence of studies cited above, been examined in considerable
detail and the phase disgrams are well defined. If, as is likely, fuels

and blankets for two-region breeders can be chosen from these ternaries

then the only necessary additional study of phase behavior is a more de-

tailed examination of liquidus and especially of solidus relationships and

crystallization path behavior in the regions near those chosen as fuel and

as blanket compositions. -

The phase behavior of pure fluoride systems is such that adequate
fuels and blankets seem assured, but the behavior of such systems is mark-
edly altered by appreciable concentrations of oxide. Since all commercial
fluoride preparations contain some oxide (and water which reacts with the
fluorides at high temperature to produce oxide) methods must be devised
to remove this contaminant to safe levels before use of the fluoride mix-
ture in the reactor. Avoiding contamination by oxide of the molten mix-
tures during reactor operation and maintenance was possible in principle
but, before the excellent operating experience with MSRE, was not at all
certain in practice. Accordingly, careful studies of oxide-fluoride equi-~
libria in fluoride melts have been made to establish (1) the effect of
contaminant oxide on MSRE fuel, and (2) the ease of removal of oxide to
tolerable levels prior to reactor usage of the melts.

Measurements of reaction equilibria between water vapor in hydrogen
carrier gas with LiF-BeF, melts over a wide composition interval have been

examined in detail by Mathews and Baes. Equilibrium quotients for

Because of limitations inherent in the transpiration method used, the

equilibrium quotients for these two reactions were less accurately deter-

 

mined than was the previous one for Be0O saturated melts (ca. + 10%,
respectively, compared to + 5%). They were sufficient to show, however,
that both oxide and hydroxide increase in stability with increasing tem-
perature. The stability of hydroxide with respect to oxide, however,
decreases with increasing temperature. Hydroxide can, accordingly, be
readily decomposed in these fluoride melts by sparging with an inert gas
(e.g., hydrogen).

These results are consistent with previous observations that LiF-BeF, .-
melts are readily freed of oxide contemination by treatment with gaseous

mixtures of H, and HF. The measured equilibrium quotients in 2LiF- BeF

2 2

were used to’ calculate the efficiency of HF utilization in such a treat-
ment as a function of temperature and HF partial pressure with the assump-

tion that equilibrium is maintained between the gas stream, the molten

salt, and any BeO solid present. This calculation (Fig. 8) shows that the

efficiency in the removal of oxide to a final value of 16 ppm

(xg2- = 3.3 x 1077) is quite high over a wide range of conditions.

By combination of reactions (1) end (6), it is possible to calculate

followed by a sudden entrance of the material into the core could permit

MSRE to assure cleanliness of the system, the fuel mixture, and the cover

“importance of this to the MSRE, experiments have been carried out in which

Fuel and Blanket Compositions

The fuel chosen for MSRE was a mixture of "LiF, BePF ZrF), and UF),

os
consisting of 65-29,1-5-0.9 mole %, respectively, of these materials. The
ZrF), wes: added, as indicated above, to eliminate the possibility of pre-
cipitation of uo, through inadvertent contamination of the system with
reactive oxide. [The general precautions regarding cleanliness in MSRE
and the apparent success of the fuel preparation and handling procedures
for that operation have gone far to remove apprehension from this source.
No samples removed from MSRE have contained more than 100 ppm of oxide,
"and no precipitated oxides have been observed on examination by optical
microscopy.] Since chemical reprocessing techniques (probably distilla-
tion) will certainly be applied to the MSBR fuel system and since such a
reprocessing scheme can be expected to remove oxides, it seems very likely
that ZrF) need not be a constituent of MSBR fuel.
On the basis of information presented above the reference fuel select-

ed for use in the MSBR is a ternary mixture of TLiP-Ber,-* ur, (68.3-
31.5-0.2 mole %) (see Fig. 4) which exhibits a liquidus temperature of ap-
proximately 450°C. Equilibrium crystallization of this fuel mixture
proceeds according to the following sequence: On cooling in the tempera-
ture interval 450 to 438°C, 2LiF-BeF, is deposited from the fuel. At
438°C, the salt mixture solidifies and produces a mixture of the two
crystalline phases, 2LiF-BeF, and LiF-UF), comprised of approximately 89
wt % 2LiF-BeF, and epproximately 11 wt % LiF-UF),.

- The blanket salt selected for the MSBR is the TLiF-BeF TF), ternary

mixture (71-2-2T7 mole %) (see Fig. 6), which exhibits a liquidus tempera-

ture of approximately 560°C. Equilibrium crystallization of this blanket

 
 

 

30

mixture is as uncomplicated as that of the fuel. Only the two solid
phases, LiF-ThF) and a solid solution of 3LiF-ThF) which incorporates BeZY
in both interstitial and substitutional sites, are formed during solidifi-
cation, and these solids are coprecipitated throughout the crystallization
of the salt.
Choice of Coolant

The secondary coolant is required to remove heat from the fuel in the
primary heat exchanger and to transport this heat to the power generating
system. In the MSBR the coolant must transport heat to supercritical
steam at minimum temperatures only modestly above TOO°F; in MSRE the heat
was rejected to an air cooled radiator at markedly higher temperatures.

The coolant must be possessed of adequate heat transfer properties
and must be compatible with Hastelloy N structures. It should not react
energetically with fuel or with steam, it should consist of materials
whose leskage into the fuel would not necessitate expensive separations
procedures, and it should be relatively inexpensive. To assure easy com-
patibility with the steam generation circuit the melting temperature of
the coolant should be below (and preferably considerably below) TOO°F.
Other demands (especially in the neutron economy and in radiation stabili-
ty areas) are clearly less stringent than those upon fuel and blanket
mixtures.

The coolant mixture chosen for MSRE and apparently shown to be satis-

TLiF. Use of this

factory in that application is BeF, with 66 mole % of
mixture would require some changes in design of equipment for the MSBR
since its liquidus temperature is 851°F; moreover, it is an expensive

material. The eutectic mixture of LiF with BeFo (48 mole % LiF) melts at
 

0gl9520

31

near TOO°F (see Fig. 1) but it is both viscous and expensive. The alkali
metals, excellent coolants with real promise in other systems, are un-
desirable here since they react vigorously with both fuel and steam. Less
noble metal coolants such as Pp° or Bi® might be tolerated, but they may

not prove compatible with Hastelloy N.
19

Several binary chloride systems are known” to have eutectics melting

below (in some cases much below) TOO°F. These binary systems do not, how-
ever, appear especially attractive since they contain high concentrations

of chlorides [T1Cl, ZnCl,, BiCl CdC1,, or snC1,1, which are easily re-

2° 2°

duced and, accordingly, corrosive or chlorides [AlCl ZrCl), HEC, , or

3°
BeCl,] which are very volatile. The only binary systems of stable, non-
volatile chlorides are those containing LiCl; LiCl-CsCl (330°C at 45 mole
% CsCl), LiC1-KC1 (355°C at 42 mole % KCl), LiCl-RbCl (312°C at 45 mole %
RbCl). Such systems would be relatively expensive if made from Trica, and
they could lead to serious contamination of the fuel if normal LiCl were
used.

Very few fluorides or mixtures of fluorides are known to melt at tem-

peratures below 370°C. Stannous fluoride (8nF,) melts at 212°C. This

material is probably not stable during long term service in Hastelloy N;

moreover, its phase diagrams with stable fluorides (such as NaF or KF)

probebly show high melting points at relatively low alkali fluoride concen-

trations.

Coolant mixtures of most interest at present are those based on
flucborates of the alkali metals. The binary systen NaP-NaBF, is describ-
as having a eutectic (at 60 mole % NaBF)) melting at 580°F. Pre-

liminary unpublished studies at this Laboratory suggest strongly that this

 
 

 

 

32

published disgram is in error, and that the NaF-NaBF) eutectic melts at
near T16°F. There is some evidence to suggest that boric oxide sub-
stantially lowers the freezing point of NeF-NaBF) mixtures and we believe
that the Russian workers may have used quite impure materials. It is like-
ly, however, that the material (perhaps even with a moderate amount of
B,0,) may be useful. It should prove sufficiently stable to radiation

for service as coolant, and the equilibrium pressure due to

NeBF) z BF + NaF,

should prove satisfactorily low. Estimates of the heat transfer and fluid
properties of this material appear attractive. The extraordinarily high
cross section of boron should permit small leaks in the heat exchanger to
be recognized immediately, and removal of traces of BF from the fuel by
continued treatment with HF should be possible. Compatiblity of the
NaF-NaBF) mixture with Hastelloy N will probably be satisfactory (see sub-
sequent sections), but such compatibility remains to be demonstrated.

If the NaF-NaBF) eutectic system proves unsuitable by virtue of its
freezing point, preliminary data (see Fig. 11) suggests that freezing
points below TOO°F can be obtained in the ternary system NeP-KF-BF ,.

Should experience prove the NaF-NaBF) mixture (or its close relatives)

unsuitable, coolant compositions which will meet the low liquidus tempera-
8,19 or

sl

ture specification may be chosen in the NaF-BeF, NaF-LiF-BeF,,
KP-ZrF),-ALF, systems. These materials are almost certainly compatible
with Hastelloy N, and they possess adequate specific heats and low vapor
pressures (see section below). They (especially those including LiF) are

moderately expensive, and their viscosities at low temperature are certain-

The densities were calculated from the molar volumes of the pure com-
ponents by assuming the volumes to be additive. The heat capacities were
estimated by assuming that each gram atom in the mixture contributes 8
calories per degree centigrade. The value of 8 is the approximate aver-
age from a set of similar fluoride melts. 22

reliably estimated because of the absence of measurements on this compo-
sition. However, the viscosity of the major components, NeBF) , is about
14 cp at y36°¢. 26

The vapor pressures of the fuel, blanket, and coolants C, D, and E
are considered negligible; extrapolation of measurements on similar mix-
tures yielded pressures less than 0.1 millimeter. The partial pressure
of BF above the fluoroborate coolant mixture was calculated from measure-
ments on pure NeBF, "| by assuming that NaF, NeBF) , and KBF) form an ideal
(in the sense of Raoult's Law) solution.

The values given are unlikely to be in error to an extent sufficient
to remove the fluid from consideration. It is clear from the’ fact that
estimates, rather than experimentally determined values, are used in these

tables that a program must be devoted to measurement of physical proper-

ties for the pertinent materials.

CHEMICAL COMPATIBILITY OF MSRE MATERIALS

Successful operation of the MSRE requires compatibility of the molten
fuel mixture with unclad graphite and Hastelloy N during years of rapid
circulation of the fuel through an eppreciable temperature gradient. Such
compatibility must, moreover, be assured while the fission process produces
its intense radiation field and the buildup of fission product species.

To evaluate these implied problems has required a large research and de-
velopment program in which many tests have been conducted over a period of
several years.

Details and specific findings of the large program of corrosion test-
ing are presented as a separate paper in this series. In brief, com-
patibility of the MSBR materials is assured by choosing as melt constitu-
ents only fluorides that are thermodynamically stable toward the moderator
graphite and toward the structural metal, Hastelloy N, a nickel alloy con-
taining about 16% Mo, 7% Cr, and 5% Fe. The fuel and blanket components

(LiF, BeF UF, , and ThF,) are much more stable than the structural metal
Ly L

29

fluorides (NiF,, FeF,, and CrF,); accordingly, the fuel and blanket have

23
a minimal tendency to corrode the metal. Such selection, combined with
proper purification procedures, provides liquids whose corrosivity is
within tolerable limits. The chemical properties of the materials and the

nature of their several interactions, both with and without radiation and

fission, are described briefly in the following.

Uranium trifluoride is permissible in reactor fuels only insofar as
the equilibrium activity of U° which results is sufficiently low to avoid
reaction with the moderator graphite or appreciable alloy formation with
. the Hastelloy N. Use of the activity coefficients shown above to predict
at 1000°K (727°C) the activity of uranium in equilibrium with melts con-

4

taining various ut3ut ratios leads to the data of Table 6. It is obvi-

ous that large quantities of UF), must be reduced if apprecisble uranium
39

activities are to be obtained. UC, would form, for example, if 68% of the

UF), were reduced to UF.

In fuel processing, hydrogen reduction of the fuel mixtures (as
described in the section on Production Technology below) should lead to
reduction of no more than about 2% of the UF), . Corrosion reactions such

These data reveal clearly that chromium is much more readily oxidized
than iron or nickel. Accordingly, any oxidative attack upon Hastelloy N
should be expected to show selective attack on the chromium. Such oxida-
tion and selective attack follows from reactions such as the following:

Reactions implied under (1) and (2) sbove will proceed essentially
to completion at all temperatures within the MSBR circuit. Accordingly,
such reactions can lead (if the system is poorly cleaned) to a noticeable
repid initial corrosion rate. however, these reactions do not give a sus-
tained corrosive attack. |

The reaction of UF) with Cr, on the other hand, has an equilibrium
constant with a small temperature dependence; hence, when the salt is
forced to circulate through.ea temperature gradient, 8 possible mechanism
exists for mass transfer and continued attack.

If nickel, iron, and molybdenum are essumed to be completely inert
diluents for chromium (as is approximately true), end if the circulation
rate in the MSBR is very rapid, the corrosion process can be simply de-
scribed. At high flow rates, uniform concentrations of UF and CrF, are
maintained throughout the fluid circuit; these concentrations satisfy (at
some intermediate temperature) the equilibrium constant for the reaction.
Under these steady-state conditions, there exists some temperature inter-
mediate between the maximum and minimum temperatures of the circuit, at
which the initial surface composition of the structural metal is at equi-
librium with the fused salt. Since the equilibrium constant for the chemi-
cal reaction increases with increasing temperature, the chromium concen-—
tration in the alloy surface tends to decrease at temperatures higher than
T and tends to increase at temperatures lower than T. [In some melts (NaF-
LiF-KF-UF) , for example) AG for the mess transfer reaction is quite large,
and the equilibrium constant changes sufficiently eas a function of tem-
perature to cause formation of dendritic chromium crystals in the cold

zone.] For MSBR fuel and other LiF-BeF,-UF) mixtures, the temperature

dependence of the mass-transfer reaction is small, and the equilibrium is
satisfied at reactor temperature conditions without the formation of
crystalline chromium.

Thus, in the MSBR, the rate of chromium removal from the salt stream
by deposition at cold-fluid regions is controlled by the rate at which
chromium diffuses into the cold-fluid wall; the chromium concentration
gradient tends to be small, and the resulting corrosion is well within
tolerable limits. In the hot-fluid region, the alloy surface becomes
depleted in chromium, and chromium from the interior of the wall diffuses
toward the surface. This rate of diffusion is dependent on the chromium
concentration gradient. ©Since diffusion occurs by a vacancy process and
in this particular situation is essentially monodirectionsal, an excess of
vacancies can accumulate in the depleted region. These vacancies precipi- .
tate in areas of disregistry, principally at grain boundaries and impuri-
ties, to form voids. The voids in turn agglomerate and grow in size with
increasing time and temperature. The resulting subsurface voids are not

interconnected with each other or with the surface.

The mechanisms described above lead to such observations as (a) the
complete independence of corrosion rate from flow rate for a given system
and (b) the increase in corrosion with increase in temperature drop as well
as with increase in mean temperature within a system.

The results of numerous - long-term tests have shown that Hastelloy N
has excellent corrosion resistance to molten fluoride mixtures at tempera-
tures well above those anticipated in MSER. The attack from mixtures

similar to the MSBR fuel at temperatures as high as 1300°F is barely ob-

servable in tests of as long as 12,000 hr. A figure of 0.5 mil/yr might

 
 

 

Ly

be expected. ST Even less corrosion occurs in the blanket where the UF),

concentration is very low. Further, the mechanical properties of
Hastelloy N are virtually unaffected by long-time exposure to the molten
fluoride fuel and blanket mixtures. Corrosion of the container metal by
the reactor fuel and blanket does not seem to be an important problem in
the MSER.

This encouraging status for metal-salt compatibility certainly applies
to the coolant mixture if a reasonable NaF-BeF, or NaF-LiF-BeF, mixture is
chosen. It is likely that the NaF-NaBF) coolant mixture will also prove
compatible with INOR-8, but no detailed experimental proof of this is

available. The free energy change for the chemical reaction

BF3(q) + 3/2Cr > 3/2CrFy gy + Bs)

is about +30 kcal at 800°K. 32

The reaction is, therefore, quite unlikely
to occur, and similar reactions with Fe, Mo, and Ni are much less so. In
addition, the above reaction becomes even less likely (perhaps by 10 kcal

or so) when one considers the energetics of formation of the conpound

NaBF) and dilution of the NaBF) by NaF. However, the following reaction

BF3(g) + (X + 3/2)M) > MB) + 3/2MFy (gy

is almost certainly the one to be expected. Thermochemical data for the
borides of Cr, Ni, Mo, and Fe do not seem to have been established. Very

stable borides such as TiB, and ZrB, show free energies of formation of

2
-67 and -68 kcal/mole (or about -34 kcal/boron atam) at 800°K. 33 The

borides of Mg (MgB, and MgB),) show free energies of formation of less than

33

-10 kcal per boron atom. Unless the borides of the Hastelloy N constitu-

ents are very stable, it would appear that the alloy will prove resistant

to this coolant. However, such compatibility must be demonstrated by ex-
periments.
Compatibility of Graphite with Fluorides
Graphite does not react chemically with molten fluoride mixtures of
the type to be used in the MSBR. Available thermodynamic date’ suggest

that the most likely reaction:

hur), + CZ CF), + hur,

should come to equilibrium at CF), pressures below 1078 atm. CF), concen-
trations over graphite-salt systems maintained for long periods at elevat-
ed temperatures have been shown" to be below the limit of detection

(> 1 ppm) of this compound by mass spectrometry. Moreover, graphite has
been used as a container material for many NeF-ZrF)-UF) , LiF-BeF,-UF) , and
other salt mixtures with no evidence of chemical instability.

The MSBR will contain perhaps 20 tons of graphite. Several potential
problems in addition to that of chemical stability have been considered.
These include (1) hazardous increase in uranium content of core through
permeations of the graphite by fuel, (2) reaction of fuel material with
oxygenated gaseous species desorbed from the graphite, and (3) carburiza-
tion of the Hastelloy N structure by carbon dissolved, suspended, or other-
wise carried in the circulating salt. These possibilities have been
studied experimentally and found to be inconsequential or to have practic-
able solutions. >> | | |

Graphite is not wetted by MSR fuel mixtures (or by other similar mix-

tures) at elevated temperatures. The extent to which graphite is permeat-

ed by the fuel is, accordingly, defined by well-known relationships among

 
 

 

46

applied pressure, surface tension of the nonwetting liquid (about 130
dynes/cm), and the pore size spectrum of the graphite specimen. However,
since the void volume of the graphite may be about 16% of the core fuel
volume, detailed testing of permeation behavior has been necessary. Typi-

cal tests?

with MSRE graphite have exposed evacuated specimens to MSRE
fuel mixtures at 1300°F; applied pressures were set at 150 1b, a value of
three times the reactor design pressure. The observed permeation did not
change with time after a few hours. In these tests 0.18% of the graphite
bulk volume was permeated by the salt; such permeation is well within that
considered tolerable during MSRE operation. Specimens permeated to this

extent have been given 100 cycles between 390 and 1300°F without detect-

able change in properties or appearance.

Redistion Bffects’>3>>3:3

A considerable body of information about the stability and compati-
bility of MSBR materials under irradiation from fissioning fuel has been
obtained. These studies were motivated by the concern that neutrons, beta
and gemma rays, and fission fragments might cause radiation damage to fuel,
metal, and graphite structural components. Fission fragments, which should
produce localized regions of dense ionization and radiolysis in the molten
salt, might affect fuel stability and corrosion behavior.

Early In-Pile Tests on NeF-ZrF) -UF) Fuels

 

The earliest studies of radiation effects on molten fluoride systems
were done in the molten-salt ANP program. These tests used NaF-ZrF) -UF)
mixtures and Inconel containers. Such irradiations, with melts and metal

chemically similar to those proposed for the MSBR, were performed over a

wider range of power density and temperature than were used in more recent
irradiation work in support of the MSRE. More than 100 static capsule
tests were carried out in thermal neutron fluxes from 10% to 10th neutrons
cm sec” L, with fission power densities from 80 to 8000 w/c, at tempera-
tures from 1500 to 1600°F, and for irradiation times from 300 to 800 hr.
Chemical, physical, and metallographic tests indicated no major changes in
the fuel or the Inconel which could be attributed to the irradiation
conditions. Corrosion of Inconel was comparable to that found in unir-
radiated controls. Three types of Inconel forced-circulation in-pile
loops were operated with NeF-2rF)-UF) melts at fission power densities of
400 to 800 w/cc, maximum temperatures of 1500 to 1600°C, and for 235 to
475 hr at full power; corrosive attack on the Inconel was no greater than

in corresponding out-of-pile tests (wall penetrations less than 3 mils).

Early Tests on LiF-BeF,-UF) Fuels

 

The first irradiation test on an LiF-BeF) based fuel was a graphite-~
fuel compatibility test in the MTR. Two Inconel capsules containing
graphite liners filled with LiF-BeF,-UF) (62-37-1 mole %) were irradiated
at 1250°F for 1610 and 1492 hr, and at average power densities of 954 and
920 w/cc, respectively. The exposure resulted in no apparent damage to
the graphite, end negligible corrosion to the Inconel which was exposed
to the salt through small holes in the graphite liner.

In the next test, two small Hastelloy N capsules were filled with the
same LiF-BeF,-UF) mixture and irradiated for 5275 hr in a flux of 1 to
2 x 10 neutrons cm™2 sec” at an initial power density of 1170 w/cc and

a temperature of 1250°F to an estimated 75% burnup. The failure of one

 
 

 

48

capsule at this time forced termination of the experiment. The results of
later tests suggest that fuel radiolysis at ambient reactor temperature
during shutdowns may have contributed importantly to the capsule failure.

Two forced-circulation Hastelloy N loops containing the above LiF-
BeF,~UF), mixture were also installed and operated in the MTR. These were
designed to operate at 1300°F maximum temperature, 190 w/cc power density,
and a linear flow velocity of 2.5 ft/sec. Pump failure terminated the
first test after 860 hr and the second after 1000 hr. Metallographic eX-
amination of the metal from the first loop revealed a moderately eroded
region (approximately 2 mils deep) in one of the sharp bends in the high-
flux region. Metal specimens from the second loop showed a negligible
degree of corrosive attack. Since later in-pile tests confirmed the good
corrosion resistance of Hastelloy N, it is suspected that the first loop
was fabricated from substandard alloy.
Testing of MSRE Fuels

The ORNL-MTR-UT7- series of capsule irradiation experiments was design-
ed to test the stability and compatibility of actual MSRE materials (graph-
ite, Hastelloy N, and fuel salt) under conditions approximately those of
the MSRE, with emphasis on the interfacial behavior of molten salt and
graphite. The capsules were relatively large to provide adequate speci-
mens of graphite, fuel, and Hastelloy N for thorough postirradiation exami-
nation.

In the 47-3 test, four Hastelloy N capsules (see Fig. 12) containing
graphite boats holding a pool of fuel salt (BeF,~UF) -LiF-ThF) -ZrF) , 23.2-
1.4-69.0~1.2-5.2 mole %) were irradiated for 159% hr at maximum tempera-

tures of 800°C and maximum power densities of 200 w/cc to a burnup of about

10%. Each capsule also contained specimens of Hastelloy N, molybdenum,
and a pyrolytic graphite attached to a graphite blade dipping into the"
shallow pool of fuel. Two of the graphite boats were initially impregnated
with the fuel to provide a more extreme test of graphite<tuel compatibility
at high temperature. When the capsules vere dismantled, the frozen fuel
exhibited nonvetting contact angles with the graphite boats, the graphite.
blades, and the pyrolytic graphite specimens. The graphite structure ap-
peared undamaged visually and metallographically. However, there were
definite observations that fuel radiolysis had taken place (generation of
F, and CF). Because of these observations, subsequent tests studied the
radiolytic instability of the fuel in detail: it vas found that only when
the irradiated fuel was allowed to freeze and cool below 100°C did radio-
lytic decomposition take place.

The W7-b4 irradiation assembly comprised of four large Hastelloy N cap-
sules (see Fig. 13), each containing a 0.5-in.-diam graphite specimen sur- ’ =
rounded by a 0.2-in. annulus of fuel, and wo small Hastelloy N capsules
containing a 0.5-in.-0D graphite cup nearly filled with fuel. The large
‘capsules contained about 25 g of fuel (BeF,,~UF) ~LiF-ThF, -ZrF) 22.6-0.7-
71.0-1.0-4.7 mole 7). One of the smaller capsules contained 10 g of the
same fuel; the other 10 g of a similar fuel of higher UF), concentration

(1.4 mole %). The capsules were irradiated for 1553 hr at temperatures up

to 800°C (900°C for the small 1.4 mole % UF, capsule), at average power

"densities from 40 to 260 w/cc, and to burnups from 5 to 10%. There was a-
gain evidence that fuel radiolysis occurred at low temperatures during

reactor shutdown; however, metallographic examination of the Hastelloy N -

capsule walls showed no discernible corrosion, and the graphite appeared \&/

undamaged except for the vapor-exposed region of the small high power

density capsule.
To investigate the fuel radiolysis further, two capsules in the 47-5
assembly, of design similar to the large 47-1 capsules, were equipped with
gas lines which permitted measurement of pressure within the capsule and
withdrawal of cover gas samples while the irradiation was proceeding. Two
large sealed capsules with widely different areas of graphite and metal ex-
posed to the fuel, and two small capsules containing fuel-impregnated
graphite rods suspended in helium completed the -assembly. Four of the
~ capsules contained salt having the composition LiF-BeF ,~ZrF) ~UF, with mole
ratios of 67.36-27.73-4.26-0.66. Salt with lower uranium concentration
(LiF-BeF,-2rF)-UF), 67.19-27.96-k.51-0. 3k) wes used in one of the gas-
swept capsules and in the low-flux, impregnated-rod capsule. The 47-5

capsules were irradiated for 4-1/2 months at average fluxes between
13

-

2 x 10° and 3 x 10-3 neutrons en? sec”? to burnups between 7 and 15%.
Gas samples were taken from the purged capsules under a variety of operat-
ing conditions, with fuel temperatures varying from 190 to 1500°F and power
densities from 3 to 80 w/cc. During reactor shutdowns, when the assembly
cooled to about 35°C, pressure rises were observed in the capsules equip-
ped with gas lines, and gas semples indicated the presence of fluorine.

. With the reactor operating and the fuel molten, the isolated capsules
showed no fluorine. In a few of the 60 gas samples, barely detectable
traces of CF) (approximately 5 ppm) were found; these were probably due to
incomplete flushing of the system since the last reactor shutdown. In any

case, the observed minute rates of CF), generation represented negligible

tablished that the gas evolved was pure fluorine and that the G value at
35°C was 0.02 molecules of fluorine per 100 ev of fission product decay
energy absorbed, The rate of radiolysis was greatest in the temperature
range of 35 to 50°C; it dropped to low values at -T0°C and to zero at tem-
peratures above 80°C.

The 47-6 test was designed to allay any lingering doubts that fuel
radiolysis and its conisgniaess could be eliminated by maintaining the
fuel molten even during reactor shutdown. Four cylindrical, Hastelloy N
capsules were used (1 in. OD x 2.615 in. long). Heaters were provided for
all capsules, and. these turned on automatically when the fuel temperature
approached the liquidus temperature, maintaining the fuel salt in a molten
condition even when the reactor was shut down. The capsules contained |
cylindrical graphite cores which were 0.5 in. in dismeter and 1.35 in.
long; the cores were surrounded by 0.2 in. of fuel salt and pierced by a
central Hastelloy N thermocouple well. Two of the capsules (see Fig. 1k)
were equipped with gas lines and differed from each other only in that half
the graphite area in one was replaced by a Hastelloy N extension of the

thermowell. These capsules were charged with an LiF-BeF,,-2rF) UF, fuel

sealed capsules contained full-size graphite cores and similar fuels with
0.5 mole % and 4.0 mole 5 uF, .

The 47-6 assembly was irradiated in the MIR for 1500 hr to burnups
from 1% (in salt conteining 0.5% UF) to 5% (salt with 4.0% UF). Gas

samples were taken at steady operation with the purged capsules at tempera-

The gas analyses detected no CF), or other fluorine-containing gases in any
of the 36 gas samples. CF), deliberately added to the capsules during ir-
radiation was radiolytically decomposed at a rate which decreased with tem-
perature and seldom exceeded 4%/hr.

Particular care was given to the postirradiation examination of the
graphite specimens. No uranium deposits were found by chemical analysis,
by delayed neutron counting of neutron activated specimens, or by x-radio-
graphy of thin sections. It is therefore clear that uranium deposition on
graphite is associated only with fuel radiolysis at low temperatures, and
that the reaction does not take place between graphite and molten fission-
ing fuel. In addition, visual, metallographic, and x-ray diffraction ex-
aminations of the 47-6 graphite specimens failed to reveal any differences
between the irradiated graphite and unirradiated controls. Also, the
Hastelloy N capsule wall specimens from run 47-6 appeared unaffected by
the exposure based on visual and low-power magnification examination.
Metallographic examination of unetched specimens revealed no change in
wall thickness (less than 1 mil change).
Conclusions from In-Pile Testing of Molten Salts

In summary, the 47- series of irradiation studies has been generally
reassuring as to the radiation stability end compatibility of Hastelloy N,

graphite, and fuels based on lithium and beryllium fluorides. The cor-

- rosion that is known to occur, i.e., that due to mass transfer, does not

seem to be influenced by power density. It has been shown that the prin-
cipal disturbing effects are consequences of low-temperature fuel radioly-
sis which is easily suppressed by maintaining the irradiated fuel at a

temperature above (conservatively) 200°C. On the basis of the UT7- series

 
 

 

 

56

tests, the limits of this reassurance in regard to radiation effects on.
MSBR materials extend to temperatures of about 1400°F and power densities
of about 100 w/cc.

The two previous loop tests on similar LiF-BeF, fuels, described a-
bove, extend the limits of assurance to power densities of 200 w/cc at
1300°F with regard to corrosion of Hastelloy N in the absence of graphite.
There has been no indication of the U7- series experiments that graphite
introduces problems in addition to the expected one of Hastelloy N carburi-
zation (when the two are in close contact).

The previous capsule tests with LiF-BeF,-UF) fuels, carried out with
no provisions to circumvent the low-temperature fuel radiolysis effect,
suggested that salt power densities of at least 1 kw/cc may be permissible.
Also, the numerous tests with NeF-ZrF)-UF) fuels in Inconel at temperatures
up to 1600°F and power densities up to many kilowatts per cubic centimeter
exhibited tolerable compatibility characteristics. With respect to radia-
tion effects, there is no obvious chemical reason to suppose that a gross-

ly different salt behavior would be observed using MSBR materials.

BEHAVIOR OF FISSION PRODUCTS IN MOLTEN SALTS?

Fission products will be produced in a 2225-Mw(th) MSBR at a rate of
about 2.3 kg/day. In the reference MSBR design, the fuel salt volume is

about TOO £3

and the fissile inventory about 700 kg; with these values
the fission product concentration after 50 days accumulation would be about
15% of the fissile concentration. Thus, it is clear that fission product
concentrations can be significant even with high processing rates, and
that fission product behavior needs to be considered in specifying reactor
operating conditions.
Physical Chemistry of Fission Products

Fission and its immediate aftermath must be a violent process; the
very energetic major fragments are probably deficient in electrons at their
origin, and, as they lose energy by collisions, they undoubtedly produce
additional ionization within the medium. It seems certain, however, that
electrical charge is conserved in this process; electrons and protons are
neither created nor destroyed by the fission event. It follows, therefore,
that when fission of UF) occurs in an inert environment [as in a (hypo-

thetical) completely inert container] the reaction
EE : + -
UF TRE EEL Enh

nust, in a statistical sense, satisfy the conditions that (1) the salt be

electrically neutral, and (2) redox equilibrium be established among the

numerous ionic species. In an inert container such castion-anion equiva-
lence (and redox equilibrium) might be satisfied with uranium valence
states above yt and with positive ion formation vy Nb, Mo, Te, or Ru. The

MSER container metal (Hestelloy N) is not completely inert and the fuel

 
 

 

 

58

contains a small concentration of UF3s so additional possibilities exist
for this system. Should the fission product cations. prove inadequate for
the fluoride ions plus the fission product anions (notably I”), or should
they prove adequate only by assuming element valence states too high to be
thermodynamically compatible with Hastelloy N, the container metal would
be constrained to supply the cation deficiency.

Thermochemical date from which the stability of fission product
fluorides in complex dilute solutions can be predicted are lacking in many
cases. Such information which appears definite is briefly described in
the following sections.

Rare Gases
The fission products krypton and xenon are volatilized from high-tem-

34,37

perature melts as elements. The solubilities of these gases in mol-

38,3940 obey Henry's law, increase with increasing

ten fluoride mixtures
temperature, decrease with increasing atomic weight of the gas, and vary
somewhat with composition of the solvent. Henry's law constants and heats
of solution for the rare gases in LiF-BeF, mixtures are shown in Table 9.
The positive heat of solution ensures that blanketing or sparging of the
fuel with helium or argon in a low-temperature region of the reactor can-
not lead to difficulty due to decreased solubility and bubble formation in
higher temperature regions of the system. [There is no evidence of
trouble from such source in MSRE where the He is applied in the pump bowl
at the highest temperature in the circuit.]

The very low solubilities of these gases suggest that they should be

readily removed from reactor systems. Only a small fraction of the calcu-

lated xenon poisoning was observed during operation of the Aircraft Reactor o/

A somewhat more ambitious scheme for insuring a low poison fraction
for xenon (and krypton) isotopes is to remove the halogen precursors iodine
and bromine on a time cycle short compared to their halftimes for decay in-
to the noble gases. Since 135% is by far the worst poison of this class,
removal of its iodine precursor would be most important; its decay half-
time is such that its residence time in the reactor should be kept at 1

hour or less. In principle I" (and Br ) can be removed by the reaction

T. + HF, T+

where d and g indicate that the species is dissolved in the melt or exists
in the gaseous state. Molten fluorides similar to MSBR fuel and spiked

with I” have been shown to yield the contained iodine readily on contact

with gaseous uy, *2 These small-scale (and preliminary) studies suggest

 
 

 

60

that the removal step is chemically feasible.
Elements in Periodic Groups I-A, II-A, II-B, and IB-B

Rubidium, cesium, strontium, barium, zirconium, yttrium, and the
lanthanides form very stable fluorides. These fission products should, ac~-
cordingly, exist in the molten fuel in their ordinary valence states. A
variety of studies of many types shows that large amounts of ZrF) , the
alkali fluorides, and the alkaline earth fluorides can be dissolved in MSBR
fuel mixtures at operating temperatures. Since the trifluorides are less
soluble, the solubility behavior of the fluorides of yttrium and the rare

earths, 34 45

and of plutonium “ has been examined in some detail. The
saturating phase from solutions in LiF-BeF, and related mixtures is the
simple trifluoride; when more than one rare earth is present, the saturat-
ing phase is a (nearly ideal) solid solution of the trifluorides. Such
solid solutions are known to accommodate UF and it is very likely that

they would include PuF. as well. The solubilities of these solid solutions

3
depend strongly on composition of the melt; the solubilities may be near
the minimum value for MSBR fuel compositions. Even then, however, the
solubility (near 0.5 mole % at MSBR operating temperatures) is such that
many months would be required for the reactor to saturate its fuel with
these fission products. In any case, reprocessing to remove the rare
earths, and particularly neodymium, is required in the interest of neutron
economy.

The above statements regarding rubidium and cesium do not apply to
that fraction of these elements originating in the graphite as daughters

of the rare gases which have permeated the moderator. These alkali metals

form compounds with graphite at high temperature but the absolute amounts
 

a

61

are so small that difficulties from this source are unlikely. Damage to
the graphite by this mechanism will, as a matter of course, be looked for
in all future radiation and fission studies.
Other Fission Products

These products include molybdenum, ruthenium, technetium, niobium, and
tellurium produced in relatively high yields with rhodium, palladium,
silver, cadmium, tin, and antimony in yields ranging from small to trivial.

6,7,32,33,46 suggests that the fluorides

The available thermochemical data
of these elements would be (if they were present in the pure state) reduced
to the metal by chromium at its activity in Hastelloy N or by UF, at
reasonable concentrations in the fuel salt.

The high-yield noble metals (Mo, Nb, Ru, Tc, and Te) have polyvalent
fluorides which are generally quite volatile and moderately unstable. The

formation free energies for NbLF MoF,, and UF may be calculated with

5?
relatively good accuracy because of recent measurements at Argonne of the
heats of formation of these compounds by fluorine bomb calorimetry. T=

The entropies and heat capacity data also are available. While the

people at Argonne have measured Rur, >t no entropy or heat capacity data

seem to be available:

RuF(s) -213.41 + 0.35 51

From these values and the available heat capacity data the following ex-

pressions for AGT were derived. In the case of Ruf, Glassner's’ earlier

 
 

 

62

estimate was corrected to be consistent with the above ant measurement :

AG" (oF 8) = -416.70 + 5k.40(T/1000),

AG (UF;,d) = -336.73 + L40.54(T/1000),

AG" (UF), a) = 444,61 + 58.13(T/1000).

From these free-energy values the following equilibrium constants have
been calculated for the formation of the volatile fluorides by reaction
with UF), (a) in the MSRE from the equation

log K = a + b(103/T):

In Fig. 15, calculated equilibrium partial pressures of the gases are
plotted vs the UF 3/UF), ratio in the melt. As the oxidizing power of the

melt is increased, NoF, is expected to appear first, followed by MoF, and

then RuF_. Uranium hexafluoride has & lower dependence on oxidizing power

the metal. The UF. should not be formed in significant amounts until the
melt is oxidizing enough to produce RuFc. If any stable intermediate
fluorides of Mb, Mo, end Ru are formed in the melt, the result would be
correspondingly lowered equilibrium gas pressures and lowered power
dependences on the UF, /UF, ratio.

] Tellurium hexafluoride has not been included in this listing, but this
compound seens certain to be less stable than any shown here. No data

which would permit inclusion of the fluorides of technetium seem to be

available. -

-3, NbF

If the UF 3/ UF), ratio in MSRE falls significantly below 10 5

would be expected to volatilize if the niobium metal in equilibrium with

the fused salt were at a near unit activity. Appreciable pressures of

MoF, RF, » UF» (and almost certainly of TcFg or TeF) would ‘require much
more oxidizing conditions in 2 the melt.

The actual state of these fission products is of moderate importance

to the effectiveness of molten salt reactors as breeders. If the molybden-

wm, niobium, technetium, and ruthenium exist as metals (or perhaps as
intermetallic compounds) end plate the Hestelloy N portions of the reactor
they will be of little consequence as poisons, although they may prove a
serious nuisance or worse to heat exchanger maintenance. If they exist as
soluble fluorides then they cause little trouble and are, in principle,

removable in the processing cycle. They can cause most trouble by forming

carbides or by adhering in some other way to the graphite moderator.
~ Molybdenum can form Mo, C and MoC in the MSRE and MSBR temperature range;

the AG values for these compounds become negative at about 450°C and the

and if krypton, xenon, molybdenum, technetium, and ruthenium occur as
elements, and if no fission product species are removed from the reactor,
then the total fission product yield multiplied by the valence (2%,2,) will
be 3.475 and 3.560 at 11.6 and 116 days, respectively. If all krypton and
xenon nuclides of half-life greater than 5 minutes are removed from the
system before they decay, the comparable IX. 2, values become 3.21 and 3.26.
If 811 krypton and xenon nuclides with half-lives greater than 1 minute are
removed before decay, the IX Z. values are 3.06 and 3.09 at 11.6 and 116
days, respectively. The above IX. 2, values (which seem inadequate to
satisfy the fluoride ions released by the fissioned uranium) suggest that
the fission process is per se oxidizing to UF, and ultimately to Hastelloy
N. Results of many in-pile tests of compatibility of the materials, how-
ever, suggest that fission does not lead to corrosion of this container
metel.

If, on the other hand, all the molybdenum formed MoF and the techne-
tium formed TeF, then the fission process would require more than 4 fluo-
ride ions per fission event and the fission process would per se be reduc-
ing to UF). Even for the rather unrealistic case where all xenon and
krypton species with half-lives in excess of 1 minute were removed the
IX. 2, values would be near 4.5. This would require reduction of one mole
of UF) to UF for each 2 moles of uranium fissioned.

Both extremes (that is a strongly oxidizing or a strongly reducing

action of the fission process) seem unlikely. It seems likely that a

fraction of the molybdenum, niobium, and technetium exist as fluorides
 

 

 

 

o

67

(of valence lower than this meximum) and that, accordingly, the net effect
of fission is neither markedly oxidizing nor markedly reducing to the
Hastelloy N-UF), system.

Should subsequent long-term tests at high burnup prove the fission
process to be oxidizing the cure would seem to be relatively simple; if the
burned uranium were made up by addition of UF (or UF, + UF) the problem
would be solved. Similarly, if the fission processes were (unexpectedly)
reducing toward UF), the makeup of burned uranium could be as a mixture of

UF (or UF.) with UF).

| CHEMICAL BEHAVIOR IN MSRE
General

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment operated during six separate
periods in 1966; virtually all of the operating time accumulated after mid-
May was at the maximum possible power of sbout T.5 Mw. The reactor accumu-
lated approximately 11,200 Mwhr during the year. Additionsl operation in
1967 (essentially all at maximum power) led to accumulation of an addition-
al 21,000 Mwhr as of the scheduled shutdown on May 10, 1967.

During periods of reactor operation, samples of the reactor salts were
removed routinely and were analyzed for major constituents, corrosion
products and (less frequently) oxide contamination. Standard semples of
fuel are drawn three times per week; the LiF-BeF, coolant salt is sampled
every two weeks. .

Current chemical analyses suggest no perceptible composition changes.
for the salts since they were first introduced into the reactor some 20
months s&go.

While analyses for ZrF), and for UF) agree quite well with the material

7

balance on quantities charged to the reactor tanks, the values for 'LiF and

BeF, have never done so; analyses for LiF have shown lower and for BeF,
have shown higher values than the book value since startup. Table ll shows
a comparison of current analysis with the original inventory value. While
the discrepancy in LiF and BeF, concentration remains a puzzle, there is
nothing in the analysis (or in the behavior of the reactor) to suggest that
any changes have occurred.

Routine determinations of oxide (by study of salt-H_O-HF equilibria)

2

continue to show low values (about 50 ppm) for 0%. There is no reason to
 

 

69
believe that contamination of the fuel has been significant in operations
to the present.

MSRE maintenance operations have necessitated flushing the interior of

the drained reactor circuit on four occasions. The salt used for this oper-

7

ation consisted originally of an 'LiF-BeF, (66.0-34.0 mole %) mixture.
Analysis of this salt before and after each use shows that 215 ppm of
uranium is added to the flush salt in each flushing operation, correspond-
ing to the removal of 22.7 kg of fuel-salt residue (about 0.5% of the
charge) from the reactor circuit.
Corrosion in MSRE

The chromium concentration in MSRE fuel is 64 ppm at present; the en-
tire operation seems to have increased the chromium concentration only 26
ppm. This increase corresponds to removal of about 130 g of chromium from
the metal of the fuel circuit. If this were removed uniformly it would
represent removal of chromium to a depth of about 0.1 mil. Analyses for
iron and nickel in the system are relatively high (120 and 50 ppm respec-

+
tively) and do not seem to represent dissolved pet and Nil . While there

 
 

 

T0

is considerable scatter in these analyses, there seems to be no indication
of corrosion of the Hastelloy N by the salt.

The absence of corrosion--though in general accord with results from
a wide variety of out-of-pile corrosion tests--seems somewhat surprising
for the following reasons. The UF, concentration of the fuel added to MSRE

was markedly less than intended. Careful reexsmination of the production

 

records and study of the reaction

‘on samples of surplus fuel concentrate show that the fuel salt had only a-

ed.

an additional 1100 grams of o>! should have resulted. With that originally

the uranium in the system could have been trivalent. An attempt, however,

3+
to determine the v (by the H_-HF reaction above) after 11,000 Mwhr of

2
MSRE operation indicated that less than 0.1% of the uranium was trivalent.
Fission of the 550 grams of uranium (corresponding 11,000 Mwhr) could
certainly not have oxidized more than 40% of the 1350 grams of Bt which
had apparently been oxidized. The remaining 800 grams (approximately)
could have been oxidized by inadvertent contamination (as by 60 grams of

E50 desorbed from the moderator stack). However, the rate of corrosion

even by this relatively oxidizing fuel melt remained imperceptibly slow.

71

Addition of beryllium metal (as 3" rods of 3/8" diameter in a perfo-
rated basket of nickel) through the sampling system in the pump bowl served
as a convenient means of reducing yi to u3t during reactor operation. In
this form beryllium appears to react at about 1.25 grams per hour so that
some 600 grams of y3* are produced by an 8 hour treatment. Some 30 grams
of Be have been added in this way to create an additional 1.6 kg of ust.
During the subsequent 20,000 Mwhr of operation (which burned 1 kg of urani-
um) this 1.6 kg of Bt seems to have been oxidized. Again, it seems likely
that the fission process was responsible for oxidizing a substantial frac-
tion, but not all of, this material.

Additional beryllium will be added to MSRE fuel as soon as power oper-
ation is resumed; it is tentatively planned to reduce at least 1% of the
U** to U3* at that time.

The lack of corrosion in MSRE by melts which appear to be more oxidiz-
ing than those intended can be rationalized by the assumption (1) that the
Hastelloy N has been depleted in Cr (and Fe) at the surface so that only
Mo and Ni are exposed to attack, with Cr (and Fe) reacting only at the slow
rate at which it is furnished to the surface by diffusion, or (2) that the
noble-metal fission products (see sections following) are forming an ad-
herent and protective plate on the reactor metal.

Behavior of Fission Products" +?

Helium is introduced into the pump bowl of MSRE at a rate of about l
liters per minute; this helium serves to strip Kr and Xe from the fuel in
the pump bowl and to sweep these gases to the charcoal-filled traps far

downstream in the exit gas system. Since a relatively small fraction (1ess

than 10%) of the fuel mixture is bypassed through the pump bowl, the ef-

 
 

 

 

12

ficiency of removal of the fission product gases should not be very high.
However, the Xe poisoning of MSRE at T Mw is only about 0.3% in AK/K, a
value considerably less than was anticipated. This low poison level is
probably due to stripping of Xe within the fuel system into helium bubbles
which are known to circulate (at perhaps 0.2% by volume) in the fuel salt.

Samples of MSRE fuel, drawn in 10 to 50 cc metal samples at the sampl-
ing station in the pump bowl, have been routinely analyzed, by radiochemi-
cal techniques, for 14 fission product isotopes and, in some cases, for
23% and 23% produced in the fuel. In general, the fission product
species which are known to possess stable fluorides are present in the cir-
culating fuel at approximately the expected concentration levels. The best
monitors (Per and 1434) with convenient half-lives, stable non-volatile
fluorides, and no precursors of consequence typically and consistently show
concentration levels same 15% lower than those calculated from power levels
based upon heat balances for the reactor.

Those elements whose fluorides are known to be relatively unstable
(molybdenum, niobium, ruthenium, tellurium, and silver) are found in the
salt at considerably less than the expected concentration. If calculations
of amounts expected are based upon concentrations of Mgr, about 60% of the

103 13

Ru, and about 30% of the
is not yet possible to state with certainty whether these materials are
present in the salt as colloidal metal (or alloy) particles or as soluble
chemical species, though present evidence suggests that the former is the
more likely.

Iodine has been found (presumsbly as I~) at nearly the expected concen-

tration in the semples of fuel. Exemination of graphite and metal samples
 

 

LJ

73

and, especially, of specimens from the vapor phase as described below do
show several surprises. |

An assembly of MSRE graphite and Hastelloy N specimens was exposed on
the central stringer within the MSRE core during its initial operation.
This assembly was removed during the July 17 shutdown after T7800 Mwhr of
reactor operation, and many specimens have been carefully examined.

No evidence of alteration of the graphite was found under examination
by visual, x-radiographic, and metallographic examination. Autoradiographs
showed that penetration of radioactive materials into the graphite was not
uniform and disclosed a thin (perhaps 1- to 2-mil) layer of highly radio-
active materials on or near the exposed graphite surfaces. Examination of
the metal specimens showed no evidence of corrosion or other danger.

Rectangular bars of graphite from the top (outlet), middle, and bottom
(inlet) region of this central stringer were milled in the hot cell to re-
move six successive layers from each surface. The removed layers were then
analyzed for several fission product isotopes.

The results of analysis of the outer layer from the graphite specimens
are shown in Table 12. It is clear that, with the assumption of uniform
deposition on or in all the moderator graphite, appreciable fractions of
Mo, Te, and Ru and a large fraction of the Nb are associated with the
graphite. No analyses for Tc have been obtained,

The behavior of = "Ba, “br, Ce, Ce, and" ~ ‘Cs, all of which have

fusion and half-lives of the precursors. Figure 16 shows the change in

" the top 6 to 10 mils to the second layer.
- It is possible that carbide formation is responsible for the depo-
sition of Nb and possibly for that of Mo, but it seems quite unlikely for
Ru and Te; the iodine probably got in as its tellurium precursor. Since
these materials have been shown to appear in the exit gas as volatile
species, it seems likely that they entered the graphite by the same mechan-
ism. The possibility that the strongly oxidizing fluorides such as MoF
were present raised the question as to whether UF was accumulating in the
‘graphite. An average of 0.23 ug/cm® was found in the surface of the graph-
ite; much less was present in interior samples. This amount of uranium,
equivalent to less than 1 g in the core, was considered to be negligible.
Table 13 shows the extent to which various fission product isotopes
are deposited on the Hastelloy N specimens in the core. A large fraction
of the molybdenum and tellurium and a substantial fraction of the ruthenium

131; was carried into

95

the specimen as its tellurium precursor. The values for °

prisingly high, since those for the 11, and hbo, with noble-gas pre-

cursors probably reflect the amount expected by direct recoil at the moment
of fission.
If the b and Tc are assumed: to behave like the Mo, Te, and Ru, it may

be noted that the MSRE could have been uniformly plated during its opera-

tion with several hundred angstroms of relatively noble metals.

The only gas-liquid interface in the MSRE (except for the contact be-
tween liquid and the gas-filled pores of the moderator graphite) exists in
the pump bowl. There a salt flow of about 60 gon (5% of the total system
flow) contacts a helium cover gas which flows through the bowl at 4 liters/
min. Provisions for direct sampling of this exit gas are planned but have
not yet been installed in the MSRE.

Samples of the liquid fuel are obtained by lowering a sampler, on a
stainless steel cable, through this cover gas and into the liquid. It has
been possible, accordingly, to detect chemically active fission product
species in this cover gas by radiochemical analysis of the stainless steel
cable and its accessories which contact only the gas phase and by analysis
of special getter materials which are attached to the cable. Coils of
silver wire and specimens of Hastelloy N have generally been used as get-
ters for this purpose. No quantitative measure of the isotopes present in
the gas phase is possible, since no good estimate can be made of the gas
volume sampled. The quantity of material deposited on the wire specimen
does not correlate well with contact time (in the range 1 to 10 min) or
with the getter materials studied.

The quantity of material deposited, however, is relatively large.
Table 1h indicates relative amounts found in typical tests. There is no
doubt that Mo, Ru, Te, (and from subsequent tests, Nb) are appearing in
the helium gas of the pump bowl. The quantities are, moreover, surprising-
ly large; if the materials are presumed to be vapors the partial pressures
would be above 107° atmosphere. The iodine isotopes show perceptibly dif-

ferent behavior. Iodine-135, whose tellurium precursor has a short half-

life, does not appear, while 131; and 133, both of which have tellurium

precursors of appreciable half-life, are found. These findings--along with
the fact that these iodine isotopes are present in the salt at near their
expected concentration--suggest that any iodine in the vapor phase comes

as a result of volatilization of the tellurium precursors.

Early attempts to find uranium on the wires (as from evolution of UF¢)
were unsuccessful. More recent attempts--perhaps with the oxidation po-
tential of the salt at a higher level--have shown significant uranium depo-
sition corresponding to several parts per million in the gas phase. It is
possible, but it seems unlikely, that "salt spray" could account for this
observed uranium. Salt spray certainly does not account for the observed
noble metal species carried in the gas.

The behavior of these fission product species in the gas phase seems
to correlate poorly--if at all--with the UF, /UF), ratio in the fuel melt.
Concentrations of Mo, Nb, Ru, and Te in the gas phase seem to increase (or
decrease) together but were unaffected--within the considerable scatter of
the data—-by the deliberate addition of beryllium to the MSRE melt. The
concentrations of these elements in the fuel decrease (after correction for
radioactive decay) during reactor shutdowns; such behavior would be expect-
ed if they plate out upon metallic or other surfaces. Concentrations in
the gas phase decrease somewhat more than those in the salt but the dif-
ferences seem much smaller than should be attributable to (for example)
some radiation chemistry oxidation process to produce MoF¢, etc.

It seems most unlikely that these date can be reconciled as equilibri-
un behavior of the volatile fluorides. It is possible that the MSRE metal

is plated with a noble-metal alloy whose thickness is several hundred

angstroms, and it is conceivable that the UF, /UF, ratio is near 10 . The
3

compound NbF_ could show an apprecisble pressure under these circumstances.

5
The other possibilities such as MoF, TeFe, and RuF, would require much
higher UF), /UF ratios, and it Seems most unlikely that any single redox po-
tential can yield the relative abundance observed for these isotopes.

The recent findings of silver and palladium isotopes in relatively
high concentration in the gas phase seem (since these elements certainly
lack volatile fluorides) to case additional doubt on species such as MoF,
RuF;, ete. as the gas~borne species.

One possible explanation of the available data is the following: The
noble metal species (Mo, Nb, Ru, Te, Ag, Pd, and probably Tc) occur--as
thermodynamics predicts—-in the elemental state. They originate as (or
very rapidly become) individual metal atoms. They aggregate at some finite
rate, probably alloying with one another in the process and become insolu-
ble as very minute colloidal particles which then grow at a slower rate.
These colloidal particles are not wetted by the fuel, tend to collect at
gas-liquid interfaces, and can readily be swept into the gas stream of the

helium purge of the pump bowl. They tend to plate upon the metal surfaces

of the system, to form carbides (Nb and Mo only) with the graphite, and

(as extraordinarily fine "smoke") to penetrate the outer layers of the
moderator. While there are difficulties with this interpretation it seems
more plausible than others suggested to date.

It is clear that further study and additional data from MSRE and from

sophisticated in-pile loop tests will be required before the details of

fission product behavior can be understood.

MOLTEN—-SALT PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY
The fuel and blanket salts of a molten-salt breeder reactor can be
prepared by techniques similar to those developed for the production of
fluoride mixtures for the MSRE. Commercially availeble fluoride salts,
which were used as starting materials for the fluoride production process,
required further purification only to remove a limited number of impurity
species. Chemical reactions used to effect salt purification and methods
by which process conditions were controlled are both adaptable to the
larger-scale production capabilities that will be required to supply large-
scale MSBR's.
Production Process
Fluoride mixtures required for the MSRE were prepared by a batch

process in a facility initially designed to support the various chemical
and engineering tests of the program. A layout of the production process
is shown in Fig. 17. Starting materials were weighed into appropriate
batch sizes and simultaneously transferred by vibratory conveyor to a melt-
down furnace assembly. In addition to providing a molten charge to each
of two adjacent processing units, the meltdown facility was utilized for
preliminary purification of the fluoride mixtures. Beryllium-metal turn-
ings were added to reduce structural-metal impurities to their insoluble
metallic states. The molten mixture was also sparged with helium and hy-
drogen at relatively high flow rates to remove insoluble carbon by entrain-
ment.

Primary salt purification was achieved in each of two batch process-
ing units. The melts were initially sparged with a gaseous mixture of an-

hydrous HF in hydrogen (1:10 vol ratio). Oxides, either initially present

As shown by Fig. 18, the efficiency of this reaction is quite high. Oxide
removal rates were determined by condensing water vapor from the gas ef-
fluent in a cold trap.

Sulfides were also removed (as HS) by reaction with HF. However,
any remaining sulfates must be reduced by hydrogen or added beryllium
metal before sulfur removal by HF treatment is effective. . Although this

"impurity is difficult to remove, commercial vendors of fluoride salts used

in the MS.LE were successful, through process development efforts, in sub-

stantially reducing this impurity from their products. Consequently, sul-

fur removal from fluoride salts should not be .an important consideration
for future production of fused fluoride mixtures for MSBR's.
Nonequilibrium concentrations of structural-metal fluoride impurities
‘that are more easily reduced than UF) (e.g., NiF, or FeF,) would result in
the depletion of chromium activity in the Hastelloy N alloy used as the

structural material in the MSRE. Since these impurities are present in

;

fluoride raw materials end may also be introduced by corrosion of the
process equipment, their concentrations in the purified fluoride mixtures
were an important process consideration. . Following HF treatment, the fluo-

ride mixtures were sparged with H_ alone at 700°C to effect the conversion

removed by sparging the melt with dry helium. The purified fluoride mix-

ture was then transferred to its storage container. A sintered nickel

filter, inserted in the transfer line, removed entrained solids from the

melt.

| Thus primary control of the production process was exercised by analy-
sis of process gas streams. Filtered samples of the salt mixtures were ob-
tained periodically during the process for chemical analyses. This second-
ary control measure provided the basis for acceptance of the salt batch for
use in the MSRE.

235

All the U required for critical operation of the reactor could be

prepared as a concentrate mixture, 'LiF-UF, (73-27 mole %), with UF), that

235

was highly enriched in U. This facilitated compliance with nuclear

safety requirements and permitted an orderly approach to criticality during

fueling operations through incremental additions of 235

UF), to the fuel

~ system of the reactor. Since the density of U in the concentrate mix-

ture is relatively high (2.5 g/cc), the fueling method employed for the
MSRE should suffice for all practical reactor systems.

SEPARATIONS PROCESSES IN MSBR FUELS AND BLANKETS

Use of molten salt reactors as thermal .breeders will obviously require
effective schemes for decontamination of the fuel and for recovery of bred
uranium from the blanket. No provision, however, was made for on-stream
removal of fission products from the MSRE, and fuel reprocessing has re-
ceived less attention to date than have more immediate materials problems
of this and similar machines. No detailed reprocessing scheme has, accord-
ingly, been demonstrated.

Recovery of uranium from molten fluorides by volatilization as urani-
un hexafluoride and the subsequent purification of this UF by rectifica-
tion or by sorption-desorption on NaF beds is well demonstrated. Recovery
of bred uranium from blankets or removal of uranium (where necessary to
facilitate other processing operations) from the fuel, therefore, is clear-
ly feasible. Such volatility processing is described in some detail else-

56

where in this series.

5T

More recent studies have shown that the LiF, BeF, (and ZrF) , if
present) can be recovered quantitatively, along with much of the uranium,
by vacuum distillation at temperatures near 1000°C; very encouraging de-
contamination factors from rare earth fluorides (which are left behind in

the still bottoms) have been demonstrated. As is described elsewhere in

this series’? this distillation procedure combined with recovery of UF by

fluorination shows real promise as a fuel processing technique.

Several other techniques have shown promise, at least in preliminary
testing. A brief summary of these is presented in the following.
Possible Separation of Rare Earths from Fuel

The rare earth fission products, which are the most important nuclear

 
 

 

90

poisons in a reactor from which xenon is effectively removed, form very
stable trifluorides with a portion of that Fo released as fission of uran-
ium as UF), . There is no doubt, therefore, that these fission products are
dissolved in the molten fuel and are available for reprocessing.
By Solid-Liguid Equilibria

The limited solubility of these trifluorides (though sufficient to
prevent their precipitation under normal MSBR conditions) suggested years
ago a possible recovery scheme. When a LiF-BeF,,-UF), melt (in the MSBR
concentration range) that is saturated with a single rare earth fluoride
(LaF, for example) is cooled slowly the precipitate is the pure simple
trifluoride. When the melt contains more than one rare earth fluoride the
precipitate is a (nearly ideal) solid solution of the trifluorides. Ac-
cordingly, addition of an excess of CaF, or LaFq to the melt followed by
heating to effect dissolution of the added trifluoride and cooling to ef-
fect crystallization effectively removes the fission product rare earths
from solution." It is likely that effective removal of the rare earths

and yttrium (along with UF, and PuF,) can be obtained by passage of the

3

fuel through a heated bed of solid CeFy or LaF. The price, which is al-

most certainly too high, is that the resulting fuel solution is saturated

with the scavenger fluoride (LaF. or CeFs, whose cross section is far from

3
negligible) at the temperature of contact.

Since the rare earth fluorides seem to form with uranium trifluoride
solid solutions similar to those described above it is possible to con-
sider UF, as the scavenger material. It should be possible to reduce the

fuel UF), to UF, and then by passage of the solution through a bed of UF

3

to remove the contaminant rare earths; in principle, by careful control of

hi]
 

 

 

o

91

the column temperature (and, thereby, the solubility of UF) one could ob-
tain from the column a fuel of the correct uranium concentration which
could be returned to the reactor after oxidation (by HF or HF-H,, mixture)
of UF, to UF), . While the process deserves further study, the great insta-

3

bility of UF, in solutions of high UF5/UF), ratios and the great ease with

3
which the metallic uranium alloys with structural metals will probably make
the process -unattractive in practice.

Removal of rare earth ions, and other ionic fission product species,
by use of cation exchangers also seems an appealing possibility. The ion
exchanger would, of course, need (1) to be quite insoluble, (2) to be ex-
tremely unreactive (in a gross sense) with the melt, and (3 ) to take up
rare earth cations in exchange ions of low neutron cross section. For
rare earth separations it would probably suffice if the material exchanged
normal cet or 1a for the fission product rare earths; other separation

+
schemes (such as distillation) would be required to remove the ce or

La3* but they could operate on a much longer time cycle. [The bed of CeFy
described above functions in an ion exchanger; it fails to be truly bene-
ficial because it is too soluble in the melt.]

Unfortunately, there are not many materials known to be truly stable
to the fuel mixture. Zirconium oxide is stable (in its low temperature
form) to melts whose zr /u™ ratio is in excess of about 3. It is con-
ceivable that sufficiently dilute solid solutions of Ce, 04 in 2r0, would
be stable and would exchange ced? for other rare earth species. Inter-
metallic campounds of rare earths with moderately noble metals (or rare

earths in very dilute alloys with such metals) seem unlikely to be of use

because they are unlikely to be stable toward oxidation by UF). Compounds

 
 

 

92

with oxygenated anions (such as silicates and molybdates) are decomposed
by the fluoride melt; they, and simple oxides (zro, excepted) precipitate
uo, from the fuel mixture. It is possible that refractory compounds (such
as carbides or nitrides) of the rare earths either alone or in solid di-
lute solution with analogous uranium compounds, may prove useful. - A con-
siderable amount of exploratory research will be required (and many of the
obvious possibilities have already been rejected) before such a technique
can be given consideration.

By Reduction

The rare earth fluorides are very stable toward reduction to the

metal. For example, at 1000°K the reaction

2 2
3heF3(0) * Boo) T 3he(e) * BeFp(y)

where c¢ and £ indicate crystalline solid and liquid, respectively, shows

+ 32.4 kcal for the free energy of reaction. With the LaF, in dilute solu-~

tion and BeF,, in concentrated solution in LiF-BeF, mixture the free energy

2
change is, of course, even more unfavorsble. However, the rare earth

58

metals form extremely stable solutions in molten metals such as bismuth.

Beryllium is virtually insoluble in bismuth and forms no intermetallic
canpounds with this metal. Accordingly, the reaction

3haF3(q) * Be(e) + Lops) * BeFp(q)o

where 4 indicates that the species is dissolved in 2LiF-BeF,, c¢ indicates

crystalline solid, and Bi indicates a dilute alloy in bismuth, can be made

to proceed essentially to completion. Accordingly, LaF can be reduced

and extracted into molten Bi from LiF-BeF, mixtures.

Since 11° also forms stable solutions in molten bismuth, 0° the

process of reducing the rare earths with beryllium cause some reduction of
"LiF and extraction of Lithium 2 by the bismuth. In practice, it is more con-
venient to use Tri 3 in bismuth (at or Just below the concentration which
yields crystalline Be® at equilibrium) as the reductent. Figure 20 shows
the behavior of several rare earths when extracted from very dilute solu-
tions in 2LiF-BeF, with Li-bearing Bi in simple equigment .%0 It is still’
£00 early to be sure that the separations available are surficiently com-
plete, especially for heavier rare earths, for the method to be competitive
with the distillation process. In addition, it -is uncertain whether re-
covery of the Ls will be necessary and, if 80, ow much recovery would be -
accomplished. However, the process seems at this preliminary stage to be
VOrLhY of further study. Cl
It is clear that reduction processes of this type can, at least in
prigciple, be accomplished electrochemically with the molten bismuth as

ed. The concentrations of rare earth metals, lithium, and beryllium ob-

~ tained in the molten bismuth will be identical to those -obtained by chemi- |

cal equilibrium as described sbove. Whether one prefers the electrolytic
method or direct chemical equilibration will, accordingly, depend upon the
economics of the competing processes. |

By Oxide-Fluoride Equilibria *

 

Removal of Pa by deliberate addition to LiF-BeF,-ThF) blanket mix-
61,62

tures of BeO, Tho, , or uo, has been demonstrated. Precipitation of
an oxide of protactinium, adsorption of protactinium on the added oxide,
or (more likely) formation of a solid solution of protactinium oxide with
the best oxide, has been shown to be essentially complete. The process
has been demonstrated to be reversible; treatment of the oxide-fluoride
mixture with anhydrous HF dissolves the added (or precipitated) oxide and
returns the protactinium to solution from which it can readily be repre-
cipitated. It seems likely that protactinium might be removed from the
blanket by passage of a side stream through a tower packed with Tho, (or
possibly BeO); the protactinium, in some unidentified form, would remain
on the bed and would there decay to 233 outside the neutron field. In
its passage through the packed bed of oxide the blanket melt becomes satu-
rated with oxide ion. This oxide ion concentration would probably have to

be diminished appreciably by treatment with HF and then H_, before the melt

2
could be returned to the blanket stream.

By Reduction
The possibility of recovery of protactinium from realistic LiF-BeF,-
ThE), blanket mixtures by reduction has been examined experimentally with
surprising and encouraging results. ®3 No real information exists as to
the free energy formation of the fluorides of protactinium. Accordingly,
233

experiments were performed in which traces of Pa were added to LiF-BeF,-

ThF), melts, the melts were carefully treated with HF and H, to insure

 
 

 

 

96

conversion of protactinium to fluoride and its dissolution in the melt,

and the solution subsequently treated with a strong reducing agent. Some

experiments used ThPb, in lead or ThBi in bismuth as the reductant; other

2

tests have used metallic thorium. In each case; the protactinium remained
in molten fluoride solution (as judged by radiochemical analysis of filter-
ed samples) until the reducing agent was added and was removed, upon ad-
dition of reductant, to very low concentration levels. Figure 21 shows
the data for a typical case. The removal has been shown to be nearly
quantitative at both traces (less than part per billion) levels and at
realistic concentrations (50 ppm) of 231pg traced with 233pa. The process
has also been shown to be reversible; sparging of the system with HF or
HF-H, mixtures returns the protactinium quantitatively to the molten fluo-
ride solution.

Recovery of the precipitated protactinium has proved to be more dif-
ficult. Attempts to obtain the deposited protactinium in molten Bi or Pb
have been generally unsuccessful in equipment of iron, copper, niobium,
or steel; the deposited protactinium was only fleetingly (if ever) dis-
solved in the molten metal. When thorium was used as the reductant no ap-
preciable concentration of protactinium was found in the excess thorium.
Careful examination of sectioned apparatus shows some protactinium on the
vessel walls, and same appears to remain suspended (in easily filterable
form) in the salt. The mechanism of removal of protactinium from the salt
mixture remains far from certain. It appears likely that the thorium (or
slightly weaker reducing agent) reduces protactinium to form a moderately

stable intermetallic compound (perhaps with Cr or Fe) which is filtersable,

is not dissolved by the molten lead or bismuch, and is readily decomposed

by anhydrous HF. .

Attempts to recover the protactinium by reduction with metallic thor-
ium in steel equipment in the presence of added iron surface (steel wool)
have shown some promise. In a typical experiment, some 320 grams of
LiF-ThF), (27 mole % ThF),) containing 81 ppm (26 mg) of protactinium was

reduced with thorium-in the presence of 4 grams of steel wool. The

LiF-ThF) , previously purified, was placed in a welded nickel reaction
233 231

vessel, irradiated ThF), containing e known amount of Pa and Pa was .

added to the mixture, and it was treated first with a mixture of HF and Hy

and then with H, alone. Four grams of steel wool (grade 00, 0.068 m 2/e

surface area) was placed in a low-carbon-steel liner inside another nickel

‘vessel. The contents of this vessel were then treated with purified hydro-

J

© gen at 800°C for several hours to remove as much as possible of the oxide

surface contamination of the steel wool and liner. The two vessels were
then connected together at room temperature and heated to about 650°C, and
the salt was transferred to the steel-lined vessel. After two separate
exposures of the salt to a solid thorium surface, as indicated in Table 15,

=!

the salt was transferred back to its original container and allowed to
cool in helium. The steel-lined vessel was cut up, and samples were sub-
mitted for analysis.

The data in Table 15 show that 99% of the protactiniun was precipi-
tated in a form that would not pass through a sintered copper filter after
a fairly short exposure to solid thorium, but nearly T% was in the un-
filtered salt that was transferred back to the nickel vessel after ex- .

posure to thorium. About 69 g of salt was associated with the steel wool

in the steel liner in the form of a hard ball. "Partial separation of the

salt from steel wool was effected by use of a magnet after crushing the
ball, and the iron-rich fraction had the higher protactinium concentration.
The small amount of protactinium found on the vessel wall is especially
notable. Coprecipitation of metallic protactinium and iron (and possibly
nickel) would help to account for the manner in which protactinium settled
out on, and adhered to, the steel wool surface.

On the basis of presently available information, thorium reduction of
protactinium from molten breeder blanket mixtures in the presence of steel
wool is believed to be a promising recovery method warranting further in-
vestigation.

Recent experiments have shown, in addition, that the handling of pro-
tactinium is simplified somewhat if graphite serves as the container.

When irradiated thorium metal (containing
bismuth in metal containers the protactinium disappears from the liquid
metal solution rapidly. Similar experiments using graphite vessels show
very slow negligible decreases in protactinium concentration (after cor-
rection for radioactive decay) with time.

Accordingly, recent studies of reduction of protactinium from molten
fluoride solution have been conducted in vessels of graphite. An inter-
esting assembly which has been studied in a preliminary way uses a cylin-
drical graphite crucible (as a liner inside a stainless steel or nickel
vessel) containing a pool of molten bismuth and a central cylindrical
chimney of graphite with its lower end immersed in the bismuth pool. The
chimney is connected to the 1id of the metal jacket vessel in a manner

such that the central chamber and the annular outer chamber can be main-

tained under separate and different atmospheres. A LiF-ThF) blanket mix-

ture containing protactinium fluoride is placed in the annular chamber and
a LiF-NaF-KF mixture is placed in the inner chamber. An atmosphere of HF
is used to sparge the LiF-NaF-KF mixture and a reducing metal and (beryl-
lium or thorium) is added to the salt in the outer chamber. The protac-
tinium fluoride in the outer chamber is reduced, dissolved in and transfer-
red through the bismuth and is oxidized by HF and dissolved in the LiF-
NaF-KF mixture in the inner cylinder. Additional study is necessary to
establish (1) the rate at which such a system can be made to work, (2) the
quantity of reducing metals transferred to the recovery salt, and the
canpleteness to which the reaction can he easily driven. The system--
which seems to have several useful variations--~does, however, look promis-
ing.

It is also clear that, as in the rare earth reduction process,
electrochemical reduction of the protactinium fluorides should be success-
ful. In this case, it might seem especially promising if (as now seems
likely) the protactinium is being reduced in the presence of metal to a
stable intermetallic compound. Attempts to reduce protactinium electro-
chemically with a variety of metallic electrodes to ascertain (1) the
type and composition of the intermetallic compound, and (2) whether a
simple recovery process with a solid electrode can be achieved are

scheduled for study.

MSBR IN-LINE ANALYSTS PROGRAM

The rapid acquisition of data concerning the compositions of the fuel,
coolant, and cover gas is highly desirable in the operation of a fluid fuel
reactor. To be of most value the data should be representative of the re-
actor at zero time preferably with as little time-delay as possible in
order to evaluate changes in composition from normal conditions and to
take requisite action. This state can only be attained by in-line analy-
sis. Investigations are under way to develop instrumentation capable of
providing instantaneous data. It is proposed to devote considerable ef-
fort in this direction as part of the MSBR program. The alternative is to
sample the fuel and coolant at periodic intervals and remove the sample:
for analysis at an appropriate analytical laboratory. This procedure is
time-consuming and thereby suffers obviously from a definite time lag in
providing information so that unknown events and information concerning
these events are out of phase.

Although in-line instrumentation is a well-established technique, its
application to molten salt reactors is essentially in its infancy - parti-
cularly in regard to radiation and its effect on maintenance of operating
equipment. The objective is thus to apply the successful in-line techni-
ques that have been used to control many nonradioactive chemical processes
to control the reactor fuel, coolant, and cover gas.

Helium Cover Gas

In addition to the anticipated impurities (atmospheric contaminants,
CF), Kr, and Xe) have been found to represent significant contsminants in
the MSRE off-gas system. While it has not yet been possible to measure

hydrocarbons. in the MSRE blanket gas, organic deposits have seriously

103

interfered with the operation of the MSRE off-gas system and hydrocarbons
in concentrations of several hundred parts per million have been found in
the off-gas from the MSRE pump test loop and in simulated pump leak ex-
periments. (These experiments indicate that most, if not all, of the
hydrocarbon enters the pump bowl through a mechanical joint which can be
welded in future models.) In these tests the total hydrocarbon concen-
tration was measured continuously by a flame ionization detector and the
individual hydrocarbons -- principally light unsaturates -- were identi-
fied by ges chromatography.

Ges chromatography is a near perfect technique for automated analysis.
This technique is now highly developed and refined, and considerable ex-
perience has heen gained from research in other reactor programs on the
analysis of helium by gas chromatographic techniques. The determination
of permanent gas impurities in molten salt reactor blanket gases will re-
quire an instrument of improved sensitivity that is compatible with
intense redistion. A simple dhvonetogregh has been used to measure ppm
and lower concentrations of Hy, 055 Ny» CH), Kr, Xe, and CF), in the off-
gas from an MSRE in-pile test. These contaminants were resolved on a 10X
molecular sieve column and measured with a helium discharge detector,

which has the following limits of detection.

The determination of H,0 and co, will require a more complex instru-
ment with multiple columns; probably a three-column instrument will be
required for all the above components. Also it will be necessary to eli-
minate all organic materials of construction completely if extended depend-
able operation is to be obtained with highly radioactive samples. An all-
metal pneumatically actuated sampling valve is being developed for this
application. This valve will also be operable at high temperatures to
minimize the adsorption of traces of moisture. The effects of hydro-
carbons on the chromatograph has not been tested but will probably require
some modification of the proposed instrument.

Gas chromatography is the most highly developed method for the auto-
matic analysis of hydrocarbon mixtures; however, the resolution of the
complex mixtures anticipated in the blanket gas requires columns packed

with organic substrates, which are not compatible with the highly radio-

active samples. Also, the experience with the pump test loop has indicat-

ed that the continuous measurement of the total concentration of hydro-
carbons would provide adequate information for. reactor operations. These
measurements, made with a flame ionization detector, provided data to dif-
ferentiate between possible locations of leeks; conversely, the complete
analyses were of value only in development studies for the selection of
means of removing the hydrocarbons. The flame ionization detector would
probably not be suitable for in-line analysis of the reactor blanket gases
because its operation would inject substantial quantities of air into the
off-gas system. An alternate method which will not introduce contaminants
is being developed. In this technique the hydrocarbons are oxidized to
carbon dioxide and water with copper oxide, and the thermal conductivity
of the combusted stream is compared with that of the same gas after the
CO, and EY are removed by ascarite and magnesium perchlorate. This
method has been tested with a bench top apparatus and found to give a sig-
nal proportional to hydrocarbon concentration over the range of interest
with a limit of detection below 10 ppm. If possible, a similar apparatus
will be tested on the off-gas of the MSRE.
Spectrophotometry of Molten Salts

Absorption spectrophotometry and electrochemical analytical techni-

ques are potentially applicable for in-line analysis. The absorption

- spectra of separate solutions of U(IV) and U(III) in fluoride-base molten

65,66

] Based on a consideration of these spectra,
U(III) could be determined at e wavelength of 360 mp to a concentration
level of ca. 300 ppm in the presence of up to 1 mole % of U(IV) in molten
LiF-BeF,-ZxF) . Such 8a spectrophotometric method, which is based on a

characteristic spectrum, would be a specific and direct method. Performed

 
 

 

 

 

106

"in-line," this determination would provide a direct, specific, ‘and con-
tinuous monitor of the u(III) concentration in the molten fuel salt.
Similarly a relatively weak peak at 1000 my in the absorption spectra of
tetravalent uranium could be used to monitor U(IV), provided the concen-
tration of U(III) does not exceed about 1000 ppm. Any corrosion products
in the molten salt, even if present at several times the concentration
level that is expected, will not interfere with the proposed determinations.
The effect of the spectra of the various fission products is not known
primarily because their equilibrium oxidation states are not known with
certainty. It seems reasonable to assume, however, that little if any ef-
fect will be observed. Perhaps the most interference will be from the
rare earths, probably as soluble fluorides. On the basis of experimental
evidence the rare-earth spectra in molten fluoride salts should present
sharp but insensitive absorption peaks.

Recently a very intense absorption peak at 235 mp has been found for
U(IV) in LiF-BeF, melts. Preliminary estimates indicate that this peak
could be used for the in-line measurement of uranium concentrations as
low as 5 to 10 ppm. If no interfering ions are present, the peak could be
applied as a sensitive detector of leaks into coolant salt streams and to
measure residual uranium in depleted reprocessing streams.

The design of a spectrophotometer to be used in these proposed appli-
cations is rather well defined. Modification of an existing commercial
spectrophotometer, a Cary Model 14-H manufactured by Applied Physics
Company, will adequately meet the design criteria. In order to eliminate

most of the radiation which is present in the salt sample the optical path-

length of the spectrophotometer will be extended ca. three feet; at the

same time the imaging of the optical system will be modified to provide

more intense illumination of the sample area.

It appears that the piping which will deliver the molten salt to the

sample cell can be extended a convenient distance from the reactor core

so that environmental radiation may be no problem to the servicing of the
electronic components of the spectrophotometer. If the radiation is above
tolerance, separation of electronic and optical components can best. be
handled by building one instrument housing the optical components and an-
other instrument containing the electronics. Schematic diagrams of the
cell (Qesign and spacing ‘are shown i in Figs. 22 and 23.

If the spectrophotometer is to monitor the ‘spectrum of U(111) con-
tinuously and monitor the. spectrum of uv). occasionally, this type of
repetitive analysis is readily adaptable to an automatic eyelic operation
with the data recorded by digitizing equipment.
Electrochemical Studies

In principle electrochemical analyses of molten salts are attractive
for in-line analysis since the technique. lends itself so well to remote

operations. In addition, any species in solutions that can be oxidized or

"reduced is determinable by electrochemistry. The chemical behavior of the

solution and the reactions involved must be known, however. Ideally, one

could establish the normal potential of the fuel and observe fluctuations

“and deviations from this norm. In this manner the normal operating be-

havior of the fuel is known and presumably changes in this behavior would

-be correlated with observed transitions. To accomplish this task a reli-

.able reference electrode is needed. To this end, it is planned to in-

nickel oxide, beryllium-beryllium fluoride, for example) as possible refer-

ence electrodes that are compatible with fluoride melts. In practice, the
metal-metal ion reference appears to be the best choice from the stand-
point of investigating and setting up of electropnalytical methods for an-
alysis of molten fluorides. One model of the Ni-NiF, electrode has been
tested and found to be reversible and reproducible but of limited service
life. The useful lifetime of this electrode is limited to a few weeks by
the dissolution of a thin membrane of boron: nitride which serves as g "salt

bridge" between the Ni-NiF, half cell and the molten sample... While it may

2

be mechanically feasible to replace electrodes in reactor process streams .

periodically, a much more dependable system could be constructed if an in-

sulating materiel that is compatible with molten fluorides could be dis~
covered.

A three-electrode system, an indicator electrode,’ quasi-reference

electrode,®® and an isolated counter electrode, has been applied to

molten salts successfully. Approximate potentials for observed electrode

reactions for several electroactive species are shown in Fig. 24. Theo-

retically, it is possible to measure the concentration of the metal ions
at their decomposition potentials independent of the presence of other
metal ions as long as the potential difference ‘is at least 0.3 v. The
presence of gross quantities of one metal and trace quantities of another
often results in swamping of the decomposition potential.

This technique has already been applied to samples from the MSRE to
determine the oxidation state of iron and. nickel which appeared to be

present: in the fuel in concentrations above that predicted to exist in

centrations of ionic iron and nickel of only about 10 and 1 ppm were deter-
mined by voltammetric scans of remelted samples that had been withdrawn
from the MSRE before it was operated at power. These values compare with

total concentrations (determined chemically) of 125 and 45 ppm, respective-

ly, and indicate that the major fractions of these contaminants are prob-

“ably present as finely divided metals. Thus the concentrations of these

corrosion products .in true ionic solution are more consistent with thermo-
dynamic predictions.
The three-electrode system also offers significant potential as a

technique for in-line monitoring of uranium in reactor fuels. In MSRE

_ type melts at 500°C U(IV) to U(III) reduction waves have been found to be

reproducible to better than 1% in measurements during a two-hour period,
and to about 2 to 3% for intermittent measurements taken over a one-month
period. If the reproducibility could be improved, the technique could also
be used to measure trivalent uranium. The rato of reverse to forward
scan currents is unity when only U(IV) is present, but the ratio increases
as UF is added to the melt. One limit to the reproducibility of the

voltammetric measurement is the precision of definition of the area of the
indicating electrode. With present instrumentation it is necessary to
limit the electrode area by inserting a 20-gauge platinum wire only 5 mm

into the melts to limit the currents to measurable values. It is apparent

.that only a small change in melt level will produce a significant error in

electrode area. /
A new voltammeter is being built that will measure twentyfold higher
currents so that an electrode with more reproducible area can be used. -

This instrument also permits faster sweep rates which will minimize the

1"
 

 

 

113

effects of stirring in flow cells which will be necessary for process an-
alysis. With these refinements it is possible that uranium can be continu-
ously monitored with accuracy that is comparable to that of hot cell analy-
ses. An alternate method for defining the electrode area is to use an
insulating sheath. Boron nitride sheaths have been used with some success
but are slowly attacked by the salts. The technique would be greatly
simplified if a really compatible insulator were available, and a materials
development program would appear to be merited.

A new phenomena which may offer a combined electrolytic and gas analy-
sis technique for oxide determination has recently been observed. When
LiF-BeF, melts are electrolyzed in vacuo at the potential (+ 1.0 v) of an
anodic wave which has been attributed to the oxidation of oxide ion, gas
evolution is noted at the indicator electrode. The gas was found to be
predominantly Co, (resulting from the reaction of electrolytic oxygen with
the pyrolytic graphite electrode or the graphite container) with lesser

quantities of CO and O If 100% current efficiency can be achieved, a

0°
coulometric method would result. Alternately the evolved gases could be
purged from the electrolytic cell and analyzed gas chromatographically.
Determination of Oxide by Hydrofluorination

The quantitative evolution of oxide as water by hydrofluorination of

“molten fluoride salt mixtures has been successfully applied to the deter-

mination of oxide in the highly radioactive MSRE fuel samples. The sampl-

ing ladle, containing about 50 g of salt, is sealed in a nickel hydro-
fluorinator with a delivery tube spring-loaded against the surface of the
salt. After the system is purged at 300°C with a hydrofluorinating gas

mixture of enhydrous HF in hydrogen, the salt is melted, the delivery tube

 
 

 

 

 

11k

is driven beneath the surface of the salt, and the melt is purged with
hydrofluorinating gas mixture, the oxide being evolved as water. The ef-
fluent from the hydrofluorinator is passed through a sodium fluoride
column at T0°C to remove the HF, and the water in a fraction of this gas
stream is measured with the cell of an electrolytic moisture monitor. The
integrated signal from the moisture monitor cell is proportional to the
concentration of oxide in the sample. The water is evolved quite rapidly
with analyses essentially complete within about 30 minutes after the salt
is melted. Most of this time is consumed in purging the water from the
sodium fluoride trap and in "drying down" the cell. |

The components required to carry out this determination in the hot
cell are shown in Figs. 25 and 26. Figure 25 shows from left to right:
the sampling ladle; a nickel liner, which protects the hydrofluorinator
bottom; the hydrofluorinator top, with its replaceable delivery tip and
baffles to retain the salt in the liner; the hydrofluorinator bottom and
a clamping yoke to seal the hydrofluorinator via a Teflon O-ring. Figure
26 shows the assembled hydrofluorinator in the furnace on the right con-
nected with a pneumatically actuated coupler to the compartment which
contains the sodium fluoride column, the moisture cell, a capillary gas
stream splitter and the necessary valving and connections. |

At the reactor startup samples of flush salt and fuel were analyzed
by both the hydrofluorination and KBrF) methods with satisfactory agree-
ment. The KBrF) results were positively biased by about 20 ppm which is
readily explained by atmospheric contamination of the pulverized salt.
Since the reactor has been operating at power the results of the samples

analyzed have fallen in the range of 50 + 5 ppm.

The hyarofluorination method should be equally applicable to the
analysis of MSBR samples, as no interference is anticipated from thorium.
Because the reaction is rapid and quantitative it offers promise for ap-
plication to process analysis and might also be combined with a determi-
nation of reducing power. The reactions involved in the process determi-

nation are as follows:

ar - H,0t + 2F~ (1)
and

UF; + HF 2 UF), + 1/2 Ht , (2)
or M° + nHF 2 MF + n/2 Ht , (3)

with evolved water and hydrogen measured.

Application of reaction (1) could be carried out by either of two
techniques. In the simplest approach the molten salt would be subjected
to a single-stage equilibration with HF in a hydrogen or helium carrier
and the oxide computed from known equilibrium constants. This approach is
subject to several problems, the most serious of which is that activities
of oxide rather than concentrations are measured. Thus precipitated
oxides are not determined. Also, it would be necessary to maintain accu-
rate temperature control because equilibrium constants of the reaction
are relatively dependent on temperature. - An alternate approach which
would circumvent the above problem but would require a more complex ap-
paratus is to equilibrate a constant stream of the fuel with a counter-
current flow of hydrofluorinating gas. By proper selection of parameters
(HF concentration, temperature, contractor design and flow rates) it is
theoretically possible to approach quantitative removal of oxide from the

effluent salt so that a steady state is reached in which the water evolved

 
 

 

 

 

118 ;

is equivalent to the oxide introduced in the salt stream. Rate constants
for hydrofluorination are not available.
Thorium and Protactinium

All of the experimental work on the proposed methods has been carried
out on MSRE type salts but should also provide adequate analyses for the
MSBR fuel. In the analysis of the MSBR blanket the presence of thorium
and protactinium must also be considered. At this time the in-line analy-
sis of thorium does not appear essential to the operation of the reactor --
a possible exception is the monitoring of thorium in the core to detect
leaks between the blanket and the core. Also, on the basis of its spectro-
photometric, electrical and thermodynamic properties, thorium is not ex—
pected to interfere significantly with any of the proposed methods. The
in-line analysis of protactinium must be considered as a priority determi-
nation because the concentration of protactinium must be maintained at a
low level in the blanket for efficient breeding. In the absence of ex- ‘
perimental data, the spectrophotametric method appears to offer the most
profitable avenue of investigation. Cl.
Reprocessing System

Monitoring of the continuous fuel reprocessing system will probably
be of even more importance than the monitoring of the main reactor ‘syten,
because the compositions of the reprocessing streams are more subject to
rapid operational control. Moreover, the reprocessing system offers
several avenues for the temporary or permenent loss of fissionable
material. Salt streams which will require continuous measurement of trace
concentrations of uranium include the effluents from fluorinators of the

fuel and blanket reprocessing streams. Part of the residual uranium in o
 

 

 

 

of

119

either of these streams is subject to permanent loss either in the still
bottoms of the fuel system or in the waste of the blanket fission product
disposal. The in-line analysis of major concentrations of uranium in the
meke-up stream from the recombiner will also be required for inventory
control. With the possible exception of a change in the concentration and/
or nature of the corrosion products the techniques that are developed for
the analysis of reactor salts should be equally applicable to the reproces-
sing system.

Gaseous effluents streams from the UF, cold traps and the recombiner
system could introduce temporary losses via transfer of uranium to the off-
gas system and will require in-line analysis for trace concentrations.

Gas streams that contain major concentrations of UF (e.g., effluents from
the fluorinators) can probably be adequately monitored by ultraviolet
spectrophotometers, but no completely satisfactory methods have yet been
found for the in-line analysis of trace concentrations of uranium in gas
streams. Several techniques are being considered to monitor the Fluid
Bed Volatility Pilot Plant, and any methods developed should be ideally

suited for the MSBR reprocessing system.

PROPOSED PROGRAM OF CHEMICAL DEVELOPMENT

The chemical status of molten fluorides as reactor materials, present-
ed in some detail in preceding sections, indicates strongly that thermal
breeders based upon these materials are feasible. The discussion above,
however, points out several problem areas that remain and numerous speci-
fic details that require examination and experimental investigation. A
brief summary of these areas and specific plans for the necessary studies
is presented under the several headings below. An estimate of the manpower
and money required, over the next 8 years, to accomplish these research
and development activities is presented as Teble 1T.

Tt is axiomatic that the course of research and development activities
is seldom smooth and is difficult to predict in detail for a long period.
Researches lead to valuable findings that can be exploited, and unsuspect-
ed problems arise and require additional efforts for their solution. It
is very unlikely, therefore, that this budget breakdown will prove accurate
in detail, but the overall sums and manpower, year by year, should be suf-
ficient for the purpose.

Phase Equilibrium Studies

Equilibrium phase behavior of the proposed fuel and blanket systems
is relatively well established. A careful and detailed examination, using
all the most advanced techniques, should be made of the region close to
the proposed compositions in the fuel and, especially, in the blanket
system. In addition, the join from the LiF-UF) eutectic, through the fuel
composition, to the barren fuel solvent will require some examinsgtion.
None of these studies is urgently needed in the next year or two. Be-

havior of the LiF-BeF,-UF) system with moderate fractions of the UF),

reduced to UF,, and more definitive information as to solubility of rare-

earth fluorides, alkaline ‘earth fluorides, plutonium fluoride, etc. in the
mixtures near to the fuel mixture are of somewhat more urgency. At the
modest research level shown, these studies should be largely concluded in.
a four-year period, and very minor: efforts are projected beyond that inter-
val. |

3)

Phase behavior in the fluoroborate systems (or the alternatives pre-

sented above) proposed as coolants is much less well understood. The items

of first priority are to define the phase behavior (including equilibrium

BF pressure) in the NaF-BF, system; such studies should include a syste-

matic examination of the effect of B04 on the phase equilibrium.: Once

the binary system is established, the NaF-KF-BF., ternary system should be

3
examined. However, should the BF system appear unattractive (for ex-
ample , by reason of incompatibility with Hastelloy N) these phase studies

should immediately be shifted to examination of the most promising alter-

‘native. In addition, a small exploratory study of systems based upon SnF,,

should be attempted, so that the interesting properties of this material

‘can be exploited if its compatibility with Hastelloy N ‘can be demonstrated.

Oxide and Oxyfluoride Behavior

Behavior of oxides, and of oxide and hydroxide ions over pertinent
regions of the LiF-BeF,, LiF-BeF,-UF) , and LiF-BeF,-UF, ZF), systems is
reassuring and is now reasonably well understood. Some additional effort
on such behavior in the proposed MSBR fuel system (and its close composi-
tional relatives) is still necessary. Little is known of oxidd behavior
in systems with moderate to high concentrations of thorium. Accordingly,

a high priority in these studies must be given to examination of oxides

and hydroxides in LiF-BeF,-ThF) systems at and near the blanket compo-
sition. A study of distribution of uranium and thorium between the antici-
pated (U-Th)o, solid solution and the molten fluoride phase as a function
of temperature and melt composition will follow. Extension of this study
to include equilibrium distribution of protactinium will also be done if
oxide processes for this element still appear attractive. It is expected
that a 2-man effort can answer, during the next three years, the urgent
questions that affect fuel and blanket production techniques and system
cleanliness requirements. Minor questions and careful refinement of some
of the data are expected to justify a continuing effort at a slower pace
thereafter.
Solution Thermodynamics

We feel a distinct need for more information about thermodynamics of
many possible fission product or corrosion product species in dilute solu-
tion in fluoride melts. We need to augment the program now under way
which attempts to obtain this data by EMF measurements and by direct
measurements of chemical equilibria. The following several items would be

accorded nearly equal priority:

 

EMF Study of M/MF_ Electrodes

Experiments using metal/metal fluoride electrodes with reference
electrodes such as Be/BeZt or H,, HF/PA will attempt to determine the
identity, solubility, and thermodynamic stability of lower velence fluo-
rides of such elements as niobium, molybdenum, ruthenium, technetium, and
copper in LiF-BeF, melts. The priority order for these elements is prob-

ably the order listed. The method should also be used, as opportunity

 
 

 

124

permits, to firm our present values for the fluorides of iron, chromium,
and nickel. Such studies should prove of real value in (1) decisions as

to suitability of improved container metals (such as niobium) and (2)

“evaluation of possible fission product species and behavior. These EMF

studies would, at least in the initial stages, be coupled with measure-

ments of equilibria such as

Nb + XHF 2 NoF + X/2 H,.
Thermodynamics of Rare-Barth Fluorides

We will use the cell

M | MF ) | MF LiF 4 | H,, BF | Pd

3(s 3(a)°

We hope to measure AG, and AH_ for crystalline rare-earth trifluorides.

f

These data are badly needed in order to calculate AG, values for the dis-
solved salts from solubility data.

Electrochemical Deposition Studies

Liquid bismuth solutions of niobium, molybdenum, ruthenium, and

technetium will be studied (1) to investigate the feasibility of electro-
chemical deposition and (2) to determine activity coefficients of metal
solutes in the liquid bismuth. These studies also could support present
studies of chemical reduction of rare earths (and Pa) into Bi, by demon-

strating electrochemical reduction of the same ions.

Activities of LiF and BeF,

should be extended over a wider temperature interval and composition range
to confirm, improve, and extend our knowledge of the thermodynamics of the
LiF-BeF, system. [If a suitable Th° ThF), electrode can be demonstrated,
a similar study in the LiF-ThF) and LiF-BeF,-ThF) systems will be made. ]
Other Studies

As time permits and the need requires we would attempt (1) study of
reaction equilibria involving BFg (especially with structural metal ele-
ments and alloys) in mixtures of interest as coolants, and (2) continued
study of the resction

2.
2HF + S Zz HB + Hy.

Physical Properties

We believe it unlikely that the physical property values listed in
this document for the fuel, the blanket, and the several coolants are in
error sufficient to cause rejection of the fluid. However, the state of
knowledge of physical and heat transfer properties of these fluids is un-
satisfactory, and a considerable effort will be required to establish the
values with precision.

Vapor pressures need to be evaluated for the several mixtures
(through decomposition pressures of the BF;-based coolants will be estab-
lished with their phase behavior). Since the values are known to be low,
these measurements do not per se deserve a high priority, but studies with
the fuel should be included early since they will assist with the distil-
lation studies.

Density, coefficient of thermal expansion, and viscosity data will be

required to confirm the present estimates. Specific heat and heat of

 
 

 

 

126

fusion values are also needed. All these values will, if sufficiently
high accuracy can be achieved and if a sufficient concentration range is
covered, be helpful in checking present methods for estimating the proper-
ties and will be useful in attempts to formulate a consistent theory of
high temperature liquids.

Surface tension measurements of the several salts, and their close
compositional relatives, should be established during the next two years
as time and resources permit. |

Thermal conductivity is the property that is most difficult to
measure for molten salts (as for other:.liquids), and the one for which a-
veilable information is most insufficient. A program for measurement of
this property for fuel, blanket, and any of the materials likely to be
chosen as coolant is urgently required. Thermal conductivity of liquids
can be estimated with some precision if the velocity of sound in the liquid
is known; measurements of sonic velocity in the molten salt mixtures
should, therefore, be undertaken as a reasonable backup effort.

Radiation Effects and Fission Product Behavior

These two items promise to be the most demanding, and the most ex-
pensive, in the list of necessary chemical development activities. No ad-
verse effects of radiestion upon the fuels, the moderator, or the compati-
bility of the fuel-graphite-metal system have been observed. However, no
realistic tests of these combinations have been made at power densities
so high as those proposed for MSBR. Studies presently under way, and radi-
ation facilities presently available, should by early FY 1968 permit long-
term tests to high fuel burnup at power densities in the 300 kw/liter

range. Such studies are done in in-pile thermal convection loops. which
 

“up

 

 

 

expose & very high fraction of the total fuel to the highest flux; the as-
sembly is equipped so that samples of gas can be taken at will, samples of
fuel can be withdrawn, and samples of enriched fuel can be added as desir-
ed. These tests will be valuable both in assessment of possible radiation
demage problems and in evaluation of fission product behavior.

We are convinced that exposures at even higher power densities (up at
least to 1000 Kw/liter) are necessary in this program end we will attempt
to design and operate such facilities. Success in this venture would per-
mit not only an accelerated test program for the numerous possible problem
areas but would also safely assess such reactor accident possibilities as
blocked flow channels, pump stoppages, etc. We hope that such tests can
be conducted at the Oak Bidge Research Reactor in loops cooled by thermal
convection, and the considerable sums budgeted for the effort are predi-
cated on that hope. If the studies must be done elsewhere, or if forced
convection loops (with the attendant punp development problem) must be
used, then the estimates of staff and funding required are certainly too
low.

With careful analysis of off-gases from such systems and rapid radio-

chemical analysis of fuel samples, we should get definitive data on
- fission product behavior at truly realistic concentrations and production

‘rates. Careful checks of grephite. and metal from such tests immediately

after termination of the run should afford realistic data on distribution

‘of fission products in these materials.

Radiation levels, from gamme. rays and from the deleyed neutrons, in
the coolant mixture are, clearly, much lower than those for the fuel, but’

radiation damage to the BF;-based coolants is not necessarily a trivial

 
 

 

 

 

128

matter. When such a coolant mixture is established as to phase behavior,
heat transfer capability, and compatibility, it should be given a long-
term test at higher-than-realistic radiation levels to see whether such
damage is a possibility.

Fission Product Separations

The distillation process is, at present, the expected technique for
reprocessing of the fuel mixture, and development activities associated
with that process are described in another report in this series. A small
effort on vapor-liquid equilibria in direct support of that development
“will continue, as needed, as a portion of the present program.

Highest priority will, for the present, be devoted to the study of
reduction of rare-earth fluorides from LiF-BeF, mixtures into dilute alloys
of the rare-earth metals in bismuth, or into stable intermetallic compounds
of other types. These studies can be carried by mid-1968 to a point where
a sound evaluation of their potential can be made. If the process shows
promise, it will be useful to examine electrochemical vs chemical tech-
niques for its prosecution, and it may prove necessary to investigate means
of recovery of lithium from the rare earth-bismuth alloy.

The search for insoluble campounds which are stable toward the molten
fuel and which are capable of ion exchange reactions with rare-earth cat-
ions in the fuel mixture will be continued. Attempts will be made to use
Zr0,, doped with traces of rare-earth oxides, uranium carbide doped with
rare-earch carbide, and other refractory compounds, as well as any promis-
ing rare-earth intermetallic compounds.

Exploratory studies of reduction of the more noble fission products

will be instituted as definite information on the nature of the species in

"

i
 

 

 

 

129

solution becomes aveilable. Should niobium or molybdenum, for example, be
shown to exist in the fuel mixture as-a fluoride, their removal by chemical
or electrochemical means will be attempted.

Study of the equilibrium

HF + I” > HI + F
will be continued and extended to include effects of melt composition and
temperature. This technique ney prove valuable in removing a major frac-
tion of xenon precursors on a short time cycle and mey minimize require-
ments for impermeability of the graphite moderator and core structure. If
these studies continue to appear promising, they should be extended to in-
clude possible removal of tellurium by volatilization of H Te.
Protactinium Chemistry
The surprising fact that protactinium as fluoride is removed from
very dilute solutions in LiF-BeF,-ThF) by reduction with thorium metal (or
with moderately stable intermetallic compounds of thorium) represents a
breakthrough which must be exploited. Accordingly, first priority will be
given to continued and increased study of this reaction. Primary attention
must be paid to determination of the ultimste state of the protactinium; it
is presently believed to be a stable intermetallic compound. Success in
this venture should permit systematic study of means for recovery of the

element. Techniques, which will be applied at both tracer (ppb) and real-

istic (ppm) concentrations, will include electrochemical reductions with a

“variety of metal electrodes, and chemical reductions in the presence of

selected metallic constituents.

The process by which protactinium is precipitated by an excess of

 
 

 

130

BeO or Tho, will continue to be examined. Attempts will be made to estab-

lish that passage of the melt through beds of oxide (2r0, will be included)
will remove the protactinium without reaction with other constituents. If
this is true, as previous tests have strongly suggested, a careful study

of the effect of extraneous ions, of the behavior of uranium, and of the
extent of contemination of the melt by oxide and hydroxide ion will be made.

233y product from

Methods for recovery of the protactinium or of the
whichever of these processes seems promising will be undertaken as soon as
an understanding of the removal mechanism permits.

Development of Continuous Production Methods

As the discussion of production technology above makes clear, the
present production methods have been adequate for materials for MSRE; the
fuel, coolant, and flush salt were furnished in a high and completely
satisfactory state of purity. It seems very likely that the present unit
processes will serve to prepare MSBR fuel and (perhaps with minor modifi-
cations) blanket. However, the 25,000 1b of material for MSRE required
nearly a year to prepare in the existing batch processing facilities, and
provision of a considerably larger quantity for an MSBR would be quite un-
economical if this equipment were used.

The purification process is quite a simple one. It seems certain
that it can be engineered into a continuous process with the throughput per
unit of time and manpower much greater than that of the present batch oper-
ation. The relatively small development effort adjudged necessary for this

conversion is scheduled so that the finished ‘plant could be available for

run-in on large quantities of salt needed in the engineering-scale tests.

Chemical Services

Under this heading are lumped the many and diverse ways in which the
molten salt chemists perform services in direct support of other portions
of the development effort. These ways range from (1) examination and
identification (as by the optical microscope) of deposits found in engi-
neering test loops, (2) determination of permeability of graphite specimens,
(3) in-place hydrofluorination of batches of salt before reuse in test
equipment, (U4) manufacture of smell batches of special salt compositions
for corrosion or physical property tests, and (5) liaison among the engi-
neers, reactor operators, hot-cell operators, and enalytical chemists so
that the many special samples receive proper handling and data from them
are reasonably interpreted.

It is difficult to specify, long in advance, the details of such
services, but many years' experience encourages us in the belief that the
suggested level will be needed.

Analyticel Development

In order to apply in-line analytical techniques to the MSBR, con-
siderable preliminery information and data must be gathered so that a
sound evaluation of possible successful reactor applications can be made.
This epproach will permit a maximum shift of effort to those concepts that
sppear to be most fruitful. For example, the experience gained in the
analysis of hydrocarbons in the MSRE off-gas is being used now in the de-
sign of a gas chromatograph to determine sutomatically the various con-
stituents in the cover gas. Work on this project is currently under way
and will be directed towards the MSER.

The long term in-line analysis program is planned in this tentative

 
 

 

 

132

order of priority.

I. a. Construct a laboratory facility which will provide a flowing
salt stream, probably driven by a gas lift. Provision will be made for the
addition of contaminants to the salt including oxide, sampling, capability
for hydrofluorination and electrolytic treatment of the salt. This facili-
ty will be used to provide tests of electrochemical methods for uranium and
corrosion products and for measuring the electrochemical potential of the
salt vs a standard reference cell. |

b. Initiate investigation of a countercurrent equilibration
method for the determination of oxide by hydrofluorinsation.

c. Accurately determine reproducibility of operation of spectro-
photometric cell for future application to determination of uranium and

protactinium.

Ny

IT. Continue basic investigations of electrode processes to observe
if chromium, oxide, and trivalent uranium can be determined in this manner.
III. Investigate materials as insulators for reference electrode.

IV. Conduct in-pile testing of any in-line techniques which prove
successful in Section I. ’
V. Develop gas chromatographic analyses compatible with high activi-
ty. Includes radiation testing of packing materials, testing solid ad-
sorbents for hydrocarbons. Development of all metal valving. Testing ef-
fect of radiation on detectors.
VI. Investigation of alternate continuous methods of in-line gas

analysis, e.g., thermal conductivity, referencing gas after chemical sepa-

ration to original gas stream.
