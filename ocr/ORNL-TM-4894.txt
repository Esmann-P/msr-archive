CONTINUOUS FLUORINATOR DEVELOPMENT: AUTORESISTANCE
HEATING TEST AHT-L

After completion of the third autoresistance heating test (AHT-3),
the system was dismantled and the test vessel was decontaminated for use
in the next test, AHT-Y4. Design and fabrication for the other vessels

to be used in AHT-4 were completed and installation was begun.
DEVELOPMENT OF THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS

Engineering experiments te study the steps in the metal transfer

process for removing rare- -earth fission products from a molten-salt

breeder reactor fuel salt will be continued” in experiment MTE-3B. During
this report period, we completed preoperational testing of the facility;
charging of the salt and bismuth phase to the process vessels is in

Progress.

SALT-METAL CONTACTOR DEVELOPMENT: EXPERIMENTS WITH A
MECHANICALLY AGITATED, NONDISPERSING CONTACTOR
IN THE SALT-BISMUTH FLOWTHROUGH FACILITY

The eighth and ninth tracer runs (TSMC-8 and -9) were completed in
the mild steel contactor installed in the salt-bismuth flowthrough
facility in Bldg. 3592. The agitator drive assembly failed to operate
properly during run TSMC-8. The assembly was dismantled, repaired, and
reassembled, with resultant satisfactory operation. Run TSMC-9 was made
at a high agitator speed (2L4 rpm) to determine both the mass transfer
coefficient under conditions in which salt is dispersed into the bismuth,
and if large amounts of bismuth and salt are entrained in the other
phase. The mass transfer coefficient was 0.121 + 0.108 em/sec, which is
178% of the Lewis correlation. All the data suggest that when the phases
are not dispersed, the effect of agitator speed on the mass transfer

coefficient is less than that predicted by the Lewis correlation.

SALT-METAL CONTACTOR DEVELOPMENT: EXPERIMENTS
WITH A MECHANICALLY AGTTATED, NONDISPERSING
CONTACTOR USING WATER AND MERCURY

Mass transfer rates between water and wercury have been measured in

a mechanically agitated contactor using the reaction:
Pb? (15,0) + Zn(Hg) — Zn? (H,0) + Pb(Hg) ,

which was assumed to be instantaneous, irreversible, and occurring

entirely at the water-mercury interface.

Several runs were made in the water-mercury contactor at an elevated
temperature (~ L0°C) to test the validity of the assumption that the
interfacial reaction given above is instantaneous. Results from these

runs were inconclusive.

Investigation was initiated to determine if polarography is a viable
alternate method for measuring mass transfer rates in a stirred interface
contactor using mercury and an aqueous electrolyte solution. Several
electrolyte solutions were investigated, but none were found to be
entirely inert to mercury. Information found in the literature suggested
that a Pe? -Fe®' redox couple (using iron complexed with oxalate ions)
may be suitable as an electrolyte for our application. Further tests
will be performed to determine if the iron electrolyte will produce

suitable polarograms.

FUEL RECONSTITUTION DEVELOPMENT: INSTALLATION OF
EQUIPMENT FOR A FUEL RECONSTITUTION
ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT

Salt used in experiment AHT-3 was treated with H, and HF to remove
oxides. This salt will be used in the first fuel reconstitution experi-
ments. Installation of the fuel reconstitution experimental equipment

is continuing.
1. INTRODUCTION

A molten~salt breeder reactor (MSBR) will be fueled with a molten
fluoride mixture that will circulate through the blanket and core regions
of the reactor and through the primary heat exchangers. We are developing
processing methods for use in a close-coupled facility for removing
fission products, corrosion products, and fissile materials from the

molten fluoride mixture.

Several operations associated with MSBR processing are under study.
The remaining parts of this report discuss:

(1) decontamination of the test vessel used in autoresistance
heating test AHT-3, and the degign of equipment for auto-
resistance heating test AHT-Lj

(2) progress on installation of metal transfer experiment MTE-3B;

(3) measurements of mass transfer of 227U and ®°7 Zr from MSBR fuel
carrier salt to molten bismuth in a mechanically agitated
contactor;

(4) results of an investigation to determine if polarography is a
suitable method for measuring water-side mass transfer coeffi~-
cients in a mechanically agitated contactor operating with
water and mercury; and

(5) description of equipment to be used in engineering studies of

fuel reconstitution.

This work was performed in the Chemical Technology Division during
the period January through March 1975.

2. CONTINUOUS FLUORINATOR DEVELOPMENT:
AUTORESISTANCE HEATING TEST AHT-k4

R. B. Lindauer

After completion of the third autoresistance heating test (AHT-3),
the system was dismantled and the test vessel was decontaminated for
use in the next test, AHT-4. Design and fabrication for the other ves-

sels to be used in AHT-L were completed and installation was begun.
2.1 Decontamination of AHT-3 Test Vessel

The test vessel was cleaned by treating it with hot (v 200°F) 6%
oxalic acid in an open steam-heated vat. In order to submerge the vessel
completely in the 14 to 20-in. depth of solution, it was first necessary
to cut the vessel below the electrode side arm, since this side arm and
the gas~inlet side arm are not in the same plane. The bottom of the vessel,
which contained a 2-in. salt heel, was removed before immersion. After
3 days, the solution was drained and the vessel was inspected. Salt
remained below the gas-inlet side arm, and the electrode was still secured
in the side arm by some residual salt. Evidently the salt had contained
sufficient crud to prevent complete drainage Through the gide-arm drain
line. A sample of the material taken from below the gas inlet contained
58% thorium.

The vessel wag treated for an additional 3 days in a second oxalic
acid bath, It was then possible to remove the electrode and chip out the
remaining salt in the side arm. A survey of the vessel revealed consider-
able transferable activity. The vat was cleaned and the vessel was treated
with a solution of ammonium oxalate and Versene. After this treatment, the
metal surface had a shiny metallic appearance, compared with the dull,
powdery look on the surface after the oxalic acid treatments. A third
oxalate treatment was made followed by wel sand blasting. A final survey

showed < 200 dpm of transferable activity.

2.2 Design of Equipment for Autoresistance Heating Test AHT~4

The next test of aubtoresistance heating for the frozen wall fluorinator
will use a circulating salt system to help prevent complete freezing in the
test vessel. The flowsheet for this test is shown in Fig. 1. Salt flows
from the surge tank to the gas-liquid separator by means of an argon gas
1ift. The salt then flows by gravity to the test vessel where it enters
through a special insulated flange and the electrode. The salt leaves
the bottom of the test vessel and passes through a heat flowmeter before
being returned to the surge tank through another insulated flange. The
insulated flanges are water-cooled to permit the use of Teflon gaskets.

The bolts are insulated by a Bakelite sleeve and Teflon washers, as shown

in Fig. 2. The return line has a deflector at the point at which it enters
the surge tank to prevent short-circuiting across the liguid stream (Fig. 3).
The surge tank and separator are, therefore, at the same electrical poten~
tial as the electrode and must be insulated from the equipment supports.

Gas lines to these two vessels have insulated sections. An air-cooled
freeze valve is located in the line between the separator and the test
vessel to make it possible to transfer the molten salt from the test

vessel to the surge tank after a run to determine the film thickness.
The individual equipment pieces are described below.

Test vessel. The test vessel is the same one used in AHT-3. After
draining salt from the last run, inspection of the vessel revealed about
11 liters of material which failed to drain. This was due partly to
runback, but was primarily caused by plugging of the side-arm drain line
with impurities (oxides and structural metal fluorides) which had
accumulated over the past 2 years. The bottom 6-1/2 in. of the vessel
was filled with salt and was cut off. Another cut was made below the
electrode side arm to allow submergence in an open vat. The test vessel
was treated with a hot (~ 200°F) 6% oxalic acid solution for 7 days, and
hot ammonium oxalate for 2 days. The solution was changed twice during
the cleaning. Cleaning was complicated by the salt remaining in the
electrode side arm which prevented removal of the electrode and flange.
This also prevented circulation of the oxalic acid through the side arm.
After the electrode was broken loose, the residual salt was broken up
manually and decontamination was completed. New heaters and cooling coils
have now been installed on the test vessel for better control of tempera-
ture. The electrode, Fig. 4, is similar to that used in AHT-3, but with

an open-end pipe for salt flow.

high. The long 6-in. section provides ample submergence for the gas

1ift, while the large diameter upper section provides sufficient capacity
to contain the salt from the entire system. A sensitive (0.20 in. of

water) liquid~level instrument in the large diameter section will indicate

any unusual buildup of salt at the top of the test vessel or separator,
as well as providing a means for measuring the volume of the frozen salt

film after a test run.

Gas-liquid separator. This is an 8-in.-diam by 12-in.-high cone-

 

bottom nickel vessel containing an 8-in.-deep demister of nickel York-
mesh, Two baffle plates are located below the Yorkmesh for separation
of the bulk of the argon and salt from the gas lift. A differential
pressure instrument will detect any liquid buildup in the bottom or any
excessive pressure drop across the separator. A thermowell is located
in the Yorkmesh which will be maintained above the melting point of the
salt.

Heat flowmeter. The salt leaving the test vessel passes through
a 28-in, section of 2-in. nickel pipe containing a cartridge heater.
Heat loss from the flowmeter (Fig. 7) will be balanced by external
heaters. The internal heater can be operated on either 120 V (750 W)
or 240 V (3000 W), depending on the salt flow rate. A temperature rise
of about 10°C through the flowmeter will indicate a salt flow rate of
either 0.9 or 3.6 liters/min, depending on whether the voltage applied
to the cartridge heater is 120 V or 240 V.

3. DEVELOPMENT OF THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS
H. C. Savage

Bngineering experiments to study the steps in the metal transfer
process for removing rare-earth fission products from a molten-salt
breeder reactor fuel salt will be continued in experiment MTE-3B. ©
During this report period, we completed preoperational testing of the
facility, and the charging of the salt and bismuth phases to the process

vessels 1s in progress.
3.1 Status of Metal Transfer Experiment MTE-3B

After installation, the three process vessels (fluoride fuel salt
reservoirs, contactor, and stripper) were heated to the design operating
temperatures of 650°C under an inert gas (argon) atmosphere, and were

pressure tested at 15 psig. The carbon steel vessels were then hydrogen

treated for ~ 7 hrs while at 650°C to remove oxides from the internal
surfaces. Addition of the salt and bismuth phases to the process vessels
was then begun. All additions were made from auxiliary charging tanks,

and care was taken to prevent contamination of the materials before and
during transfer into the process vessels. Finally, all salts and bismuth
were filtered through a sintered molybdenum frit (~ 30-p mean pore diameter)
as they were transferred from the charging vessels into the process

vessels to remove any particulates (such as oxides).

To date, we have completed the following additions to the MITE-3B

process vessels:

(1) 61.7 kg of bismuth to the contactor vessel. The bismuth was
hydrogen treated at 650°C to remove oxides.

(2) 110.6 kg of fuel carrier salt (72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF,)
to the contactor and the fuel-salt reservoir. Before being
added to the system, the fuel salt was sparged in the charging
vessel with argon for 42 hr while in contact with bismuth which

contained thorium.

The charging vessel used for the bismuth and fuel-carrier salt
additions has been removed. A new charging vessel is being installed
to facilitate the addition of a mixture of bismuth containing 5 at. %
of lithium to the stripping vessel, and the lithium chloride addition

to the contactor and stripper.

4, SALT-METAL CONTACTOR DEVELOPMENT: EXPERIMENTS
WITH A MECHANICALLY AGITATED, NONDISPERSING CONTACTOR
IN THE SALT-BISMUTH FLOWTHROUGH FACILITY

Cc. H. Brown, Jr.

We have continued operation of a facility in which mass transfer
rates between molten LiF-BeF,-ThF, (72-16-12 mole %) and molten bismuth

can be measured in a mechanically agitated, nondispersing contactor of

1"

the "Lewis type.’ A total of nine experimental runs have been completed

to date. Results from the first seven runs have been previously reported. 3?
Preparation for and results obtained from the eighth and ninth runs, TSMC-8

and ~9, respectively, are discussed in the following sections.
13

4.1 Preparation for Mass Transfer Experiments TSMC-8 and TSMC-9

In preparation for each of the runs made during this report period,
it was necessary to: (1) add beryllium to the salt to adjust the uranium
distribution coefficient; (2) contact the salt and bismuth by passing
both phases through the mild steel conlactor to ensure that chemical
equilibrium was achieved between the salt and bismuth; and (3) add a
sufficient quantity of ®%7U tracer to the salt while it was in the salt
feed tank. The experimental procedure that was followed in the first
six runs has been previously reported, and was followed in the last

three runs.

4.2 Experimental Operation

Run TSMC-8 was performed with salt and bismuth flow rates of 152 cc/
win and 164 ce/min, respectively. The uranium distribution coefficient
was maintained at a high level (> 40) for this run, which, as has been
previously discussed, is greater than the minimum desired value of 20.
The agitator was thought to have been operated at 241 rpm, which is high
enough to produce mild dispersion of the phases in the contactor and,
therefore, results In a high measured mass transfer rate. Results from
this run, however, indicated that very little (~ 29%) of the 2377 tracer
was actually transferred from the salt to the bismuth. Inspection of the
magnetically coupled agitator drive assembly indicated that an accumulation
of a highly viscous, carbonaceous material between the upper carbon bearing
and the agitator drive shaft had prevented proper rotation of the shaft.
The drive assembly operated satisfactorily after it was cleaned of all

foreign material and reassembled.

The ninth tracer rum, TSMC-9, was performed as a repeat of the eighth
run. Salt and bismuth flow rates were set at 169 ce/min and 164 ce/min,
respectively. The agitator was operated at 244 rpm during this run. A
high stirrer rate waz maintained in order to determine the effects of
dispersal of one phase in the other on the mags transfer rate, and to
determine if large amounts of bismuth and salt are entrained in the other
phase after passing through the small settling chamber in the contactor

effluent line. The uranium distribution coefficient was greater than 47
1k

during this run. No systematic problems were encountered and the run

was performed smoothly.

4.3 Mass Transfer Results

The samples taken during both runs were analyzed by first counting
the sample capsules for the activity of *27U (207.95 keV B87). The
material in the sample capsules was then dissolved, and the activity of
2377 was counted again. The counting data obtained in this manner for

runs TSMC~-8 and TSMC-9 are shown in Tables 1 and 2, respectively.

Operating conditions and mass transfer results for runs TSMC-8 and
-9, and the results from runs TSMC-2 through -7 are summarized in Table 3.
The salt-phase mass transfer coefficient was calculated using three
different equations derived fron an overall mass balance around the
contactor. The average measured mass transfer coefficient, with the

corresponding standard deviation, is reported in Table 3.

As previously discussed, the agitator failed to operate properly in
run TSMC-8, which explains the rather low mass transfer rate measured
during this run, 0.0022 + 0.0010 cm/sec. The measured mass transfer
coefficient obtained in run TSMC-9 is 0.121 + 0.108 cm/sec, which
corresponds to 178% of the Lewis correlation. As shown by the high value
for the standard deviation, the three determinations for the mass transfer
coefficient differ greatly. One possible explanation for this is that
the 227U tracer balance around the contactor showed closure to within
only 50%.

A Tewis plot of the results from the six runs which have produced
meaningful results is shown in Fig. 8. The nomenclature used in Fig. 8

Fig. 8. Mass transfer results measured in the salt-bismuth contactor
with 2370 ana %77r tracers, compared to the values predicted by the Lewis
correlation.
19

In Fig. 8 it can be seen that the mass transfer group based on ura-
nium for runs 3, 5, and 7 is between 33% and 65% of the Lewis correla-
tion, while that same group for runs 4, 6, and 9 is greater than 100% of
the Lewis correlation. Run 8 was not shown because of the malfunction of
the agitator drive. In all but one case, the mass transfer results
based on zirconium are consistently slightly less than the values based
on uranium. This discrepancy is probably related to the inability to
correct for the self-absorption of the Th3.37 keV B from the 977r in

the solid bismuth samples.

Results from the runs performed in the nondispersed regime, runs
TSMC-3, ~5, and -T, suggest that the dependence of the mass transfer
group on the Reynolds number group is slightly less than that predicted
by the Lewis correlation. The exponent appears to be closer to 1.0 than
to 1.65. This is consistent with the Lewis data which show that for a
single aguecus-organic system, the exponent on the Reynolds number group

is more nearly 1.0 than 1.65.

We believe that the initiation of entraimment of salt into the bis-
muth begins to occur at a stirrer speed between 160 and 180 rpm. The
apparent increase in mass transfer coefficient is a manifestation of an
increase in the surface area for mass transfer due to surface motion.
This effect is verified by the high mass transfer rates measured in runs
4, 6, and 9. Experiments with water-mercury and water-methylene bromide
systems support the belief that phase dispersal is present at agitator
speeds near 180 rpm.

It is possible that at high agitator rates (> 170 rpm) some salt or
bismuth is entrained in the other phase and is carried out of the con-
tactor. This effect is detectable if sufficient settling time is not
available between the times when the salt and bismuth exit from the con-
tactor and when the flowing stream samples are taken. Figure 9 shows
the results of analysis for beryllium in the bismuth flowing stream sam~
ples taken in runs TSMC-5, -6, and -9, which were performed at 124, 180,
and 244 rpm, respectively.

It 1s assumed that any beryllium present in the salt is due to
entraimment of salt in the bismuth phase. From Fig. 9, it is seen that
when dispersion is suspected there is more beryllium, and hence salt,
present in the bismuth stream, at least near the beginning and near the
end of a run. In the middle of a run, agitator speed does not seem to
have an effect on the amount of beryllium in the bismuth. The effect
of salt entrainment in the bismuth is most significant in the metal
transfer process where the presence of fluoride ions in the lithium
chloride has a deleterious effect on the separation between the rare

earths and thorium,

Analyses of bismuth in the salt samples could not be obtained.
However, no gross amounts of bismuth were indicated from the weights
of the salt samples. It is possible to take advantage of the increased
mass transfer rate afforded by mild dispersal of the salt and bismuth
phases in a stirred contactor without imposing any detrimental effects
to the reactor vessel, or adding a large burden to the bismuth removal
step. We plan to make a series of runs at high agitator speeds to
investigate more closely the magnitude of entrainment effects in this

type of contactor.
5. SALT-METAL CONTACTOR DEVELOPMENT: EXPERIMENTS WITH A
MECHANICALLY AGITATED, NONDISPERSING CONTACTOR USING WATER AND MERCURY

C. H. Brown, Jr.

We have continued development of a two-phase nondispersing contactor

using water and mercury to simulate molten fluoride salt and bismuth.

During this report period, several runs were made in the water-
mercury system at an elevated temperature to determine if the assumption

that the reaction under consideration,
po? [m0] + znfig] ~ 2 ¥ [m0] + vo [ne], (1)

is instantaneous. We have also initiated experiments to determine if

polarography is a viable alternative method for determining individual
22

water~phase mass transfer coefficients in the nondispersing stirred

interface contactor.

5.1 Runs at Elevated Temperatures with the Lead Ton~Zinc
Amalgam System

Several runs were made in which the temperature of the contactor
and reactants was raised to approximately 40°C. The results from these
tests are inconclusive, because it was found that at this elevated
temperature, hydrochloric acid, which was present in the aqueous phase
to prevent oxide formation at the mercury surface, reacted with zine to
form zine chloride. This makes the mass transfer analysis more difficult
by intorducing a competing reaction. Also, depletion of the acid caused
formation of a spongy lead compound on the agitator blades and at the

water-mercury interface.

5.2 Polarographic Determination of Mass Transfer Coefficients

Polarography has been suggested as an alternate method for determining
the water-phase mass transfer coefficient in the water-mercury contactor.
The necessary experimental equipment has been assembled and preliminary
tests have been made to determine: (1) a suitable redox couple, and (2)
an electrolyte which will produce the desired polarization curve while

being chemically inert to mercury.

5.2.1 Theory

The polarographic technique for determining mass transfer coefficients
involved oxidation of a reduced species or reduction of an oxidized species

at an electrode which is at a condition of concentration polarization.

5

One system that has been studied previously” is the reduction of

ferricyanide ions at a polarized nickel electrode. As ferricyanide was
reduced at the cathode, ferrocyanide was oxidized at the anode. There
was no net consumption of chemicals or change in the composition of the

electrolyte solution.

Polarization of the cathode can be accomplished in one of two ways --

either the cathode surface areas is made very large with respect to the
23

anode surface area, or the concentration of the oxidized species is made

very small with respect to the reduced species.
The migration of an ion in both electric and concentration fields

is described by the Nernst-Planck equation:

Q = D(vC + 2 ve), (2)

where

®

The first term in the expression represents the contribution of ordinary

electric potential, V.

diffusion to the flux, and the second term represents the contribution of
electromigration. A large concentration (relative to that of the reacting
ion) of an inert electrolyte alters the dielectric properties of the
solution such that the potential will decrease smoothly across the region
between the electrodes, while the concentration drops sharply across the
thin polarized layer near the cathode. Thus, the term containing the

electric potential becomes relatively small, and

Q ~ DvC. (3)

The current flowing between the electrodes is thus a measure of mass
transfer rates governed by ordinary molecular diffusion. This current

is sometimes called the "diffusion current."

The impressed current across the cell is proportional to the mass
flux across the stagnant layer between the bulk electrolyte and the

polarized cathode, and the mass transfer coefficient is given by:
where
k = mass transfer coefficlent through the film, cm/sec,
I = polarization current, A,
A = area of the polarized electrode, or? , and
C,, = concentration in g-moles/cm3 of transferring species in the

bulk liquid.

Hence, it 1s possible to determine mass transfer rates from the bulk
electrolyte to the electrode surface using experimentally determined values

for I, Cp and A.

5.2.2 Experimental equipment

 

The experimental apparatus which will be used to measure mass trans-
fer rates in the water-mercury stirred contactor is shown schematically
in Fig. 10, The equipment consists of the 5- by 7~in. Plexiglas contactor
which was used in previous work with the water-mercury system. The
mercury surface in the contactor acts as the cathode in the eleetrochemical
cell. The cathode is electrically connected to the rest of the circuit
by a 1/8-in.-diam stainless steel welding rod which is electrically
insulated from the electrolyte phase by a Teflon sheath. The anode of
the cell is suspended in the aqueous electrolyte phase, and consists of
a 1/8-in.-thick piece of nickel sheet which 1s formed to fit the inner
perimeter of the Plexiglas cell. The current through the cell is inferred
from the voltage drop across a 0.1 Q + 0.5%, 10-W precision resistor. The
signal produced across the resistor 1s recorded as the y coordinate on a
Hewlett-Packard x,y plotter. The x coordinate on the plotter is produced
by the voltage supplied to the cell, which is a direct signal from the
0 to 10 V, O to 10 A Hewlett~Packard direct current power supply.

5.2.3 Experimental regults

 

Several different electrolyte solutions have been evaluated on the
basis to two different criteria: (1) the electrolyte must be chemically
inert to mercury, and (2) it must be possible to polarize the mercury sur-

face with the given electrolyte. The different electrolytes that have

been examined are: (1) potassium ferro- and ferricyanide with a sodium
hydroxide supporting electrolyte; (2) potassium ferro- and ferricyanide
with a sodium chloride supporting electrolyte; (3) potassium ferro- and

ferricyanides with a sodium nitrate supporting electrolyte; (U4) ferrous
and ferric sulfate with a sodlum hydroxide supporting electrolyte; and

(5) ferrous and ferric sulfate with sulfuric acid as the supporting

electrolyte.

None of the electrolytes mentioned above met both of the imposed
criteria. The ferrous and ferric sulfate system with sulfuric acid as
the indifferent electrolyte was the only combination which proved to be
chemically inert to the mercury cathode. It was found, however, that
at a voltage less than sufficient to polarize the mercury cathode, the
ferric ions reacted with the mercury cathode. This phenomenon has been

previously reported in the literature.

therefore, the half-wave potential of ferric ions cannot be measured

directly.

The reversible oxidation and reduction of ferrous and ferric ions
have been reported feasible when the iron ions are complexed with excess
oxalate ions. This system will be examined in detail and applied to the

experiment under development.

6. FUEL RECONSTITUTION DEVELOPMENT: INSTALLATION OF EQUIPMENT
FOR A FUEL RECONSTITUTION ENGINEERING EXPERIMENT

R. M. Counce

The reference flowsheet for processing the fuel salt from a molten
salt breeder reactor (MSBR) is based upon removal of uranium by fluori-
nation to UFg as the first processing step. The uranium removed in this

step must subsequently be returned to the fuel salt gtream before it
ar

returns to the reactor. The method used for recombining the uranium with
the fuel carrier salt (reconstituting the fuel salt) is to absorb gaseous
UFg inte a recycled fuel salt zbream containing dissolved Uf, by utilizing

"the reaction:

Ue () + Puig) = 2 sry . (6)

The resultant UF; would be reduced to UF, with hydrogen in a separate

vessel according to the reaction:

Uisigy + 1/2 Hprgy =Ufy(qy + Hy (7)

We are beginni engineering studies of the fuel reconstitution step in

ng
order to provide the technology necessary for the design of larger egquip-
ment for recombining UF; generated in fluworinators in the processing plant
with the process fuel salt returning to the reactor. During this report
period, installation of equipment previously descrived wag continued.
Thies report describes the general gas supply systems, documents the

equipment installation, and describes the initial salt preparation.

6.1 Gas Supply Systems

The UF, for the fuel reconstitution engineering experiment is
available in 5-in.-diam by 36-in.-high cylinders containing up to 55 1b
of UFg, The UF's (4) will be supplied to this experiment by maintaining
the temperature of the UFg cylinder at 220°F, and at a vapor pressure of

70 psia. This heating will be accomplished by use of 17.2~psia steam.

The steam heats the cylinders directly through 3/8~in. copper tubing,
which is coiled around the entire cylinder. The lower 18 in. of the
cylinder and tubing iz covered with a conductive cement to minimize
response time. The cylinder and associated valves are then enclosed in

a cabinet insulated with 2 in. of Fiberglass insulation.
28

Purified argon will be used for all apolications requiring an inert
gas (e.g., pressurization of tanks for transferring salt, dip-leg bubblers
for liquid level measurements, purging of equipment and lines, ete.).
Cylinder argon is passed through a bed of titanium sponge where water and

oxygen are removed. This bed operates at 825°C.

Cylinder hydrogen is purified sufficiently by passing it through a
Deoxo unit, where oxygen 1s converted to water. No further purification
of the nitrogen is needed, since it is sufficiently pure for use in
calibrating the gas density cells.

6.2 Equipment Installation

The equipment for the fuel reconstitution engineering experiment is
being installed in the northeast corner of the bay in Building T7503.
The experiment is operated remotely from a control room in the building,
although the gas flow controllers and some other equipment are located

in the bay.

The experimental equipment is shown in Figs. 11-14 before the addition
of thermal insulation. Flg. 11 is an overall sideview of the equipment
showing the feed and receiver tanks, titanium sponge trap, Hs, reductioi
column and its jackleg and sample port, and the HF and UF, traps.

Figure 12 is an overall front view of the experiment showing the gas
control panel feed and recelver tanks, the top of the UFg absorption
vessel, and the H, reduction colunn and its effluent stream sample port.
Figure 13 shows a view of the lower portion of the Hp reduction column
and its jackleg, and the instruments for measuring the depth of the feed
and receiver tanks. A view of the HF and UFg traps (packed beds of NaF

pellets) and the in-line gas density detectors is shown in Fig. 14.

The electrical supply panel is located in a remote control room, and
is shown in Fig. 15. Temperature is controlled by manual adjustment of

heater voltage and by automatic on-off controllers.

Figure 16 shows the temperature recorders and temperature controllers
Tor major vessels and the gas density cells. Also shown are level and

flow recorders and controllers. "The instruments at the right of the

control panel are recorders associated with the gas density cells.

6.3 H,-HF Treatment of Salt from Autoresistance Heating Tests

The first series of experiments will use 86 kg of fuel salt, formerly
used in AHT-3., To remove oxides present in the salt, it was sparged with
a H,-HF mixture in Bldg. 3541. The metal oxides were removed according to

the following generalized reaction:

XHF(g) + MOx/2(d) < MF_(d) + x/2 H0(g), (8)
where
(g) = gaseous
(d) = dissolved
x = number of moles
M = metal species found in salt.

The HF was diluted with Hy, in order to prevent excessive attack on vessel
and piping. The HF concentration in the mixture was 33 vol %. The
nominal total flow rate was 15 scfh.® The HF flow was set by controlling
the pressure drop across a capillary; the Hz flow was set by use of a

rotameter and was checked by a wet-test meter.

The HF utilization was determined by using an aqueous scrubber and
a small (0.05 £t3/rev) wet-test meter in parallel with the NaF trap for
sampling the gas fed to the treatment vessel or leaving the vessel.
The concentration of HF in the gas stream was determined by passing the
gas through 250 ml of a O.4 N NaOH solution in the scrubber. When 0.05
ft3 of Hp had passed through the wet-test meter, the gas flow was stopped
and the solution was removed for analysis. The HF concentration in the
gas was determined by titrating small samples of the scrubbing solution
with O.1 N HCl. Both the feed and the discharge streams were monitored
in this manner. Utilization of the HF was calculated from the feed and
discharge concentrations. The HF utilization decreased from an initial
value of about 50% to about 25% after 20 hr. The HF utilization remained
at 25% for the last 10 hr.

*
Standard cubic feet per hour.
36

Reduction of corrosion product fluorides, principally NiF,, FeFj,
and CrFp, will proceed after verification of oxide removal. Of the
corrosion products present in the salt, a hydrogen sparge will reduce
only NiF; in a practical time period; thus, CrF, and possibly FeF, will
be reduced with Th metal.

After the reduction of the corrosion fluorides to their metallic
form, they will be filtered from the mixture as it is decanted into a
fuel reconstitution experiment vessel. Sufficient UF, will be added to
bring the concentration in the salt to 0.0125 mole % after the salt has

been transferred to the fuel reconstitution equipment.
