FOREWORD

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment utilizes the circulating fluoride-fuel as
the primary reactor coolant. It is necessary, however, to employ an additional
coolant whose primary function is to cool the reflector and pressure shell.
Although liquid sodium will be used as the reflector coolant, the use of Nak
had been assumed during the preceding year. Consequently, a considerable amount
of consistent, detailed data on the performance characteristics for the reactor
system using NaK as the reflector coolant has been assembled. These data are
presented in this report. A sufficient number of calculations based upon the
use of sodium has been made to assure that the performance with sodium will not

deviate significantly from that calculated for Nak. Sodium is being used in

preference to NaK because it can be more easily sealed at the pump shaft.

INTRODUCTION

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment
(ARE) is an experimental, high-tempera-
ture, circulating-fuel reactor being
constructed by the Aircraft Nuclear
Propulsion Division of the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. The fuel is a
mixture of fused fluorides, including
uranium tetrafluoride; the moderator
is beryllium oxide; and the structural
material is Inconel. Figure 1 shows
a schematic diagram of the reactor,
the heat disposal equipment, and the
other process equipment necessary to
the operation of the reactor; also
shown in Fig. 1 are the design-point
pressures, temperatures, and flows at
various points in the system. This
report contains a summary of the more
pertinent analytical investigations
of thermodynamic and heat transfer
properties of the ARE.

Considerably more investigations
have been carried out than have been
presented; the investigations omitted
fall in one of the following categories:
1. investigations relating to systems

and items of equipment not actually
used in the ARE,

2. investigations relating to systems
and items of equipment used in the
ARE but with different fluids than
those actually used,

3. investigations in which estimated
fuel properties were used that
were found to be incorrect when
additional experimental determi-
nations of fuel properties were
made,

4. routine calculations of tempera-
tures and pressures at various
points of the system that were of
interest only to the detail
designer.

For convenience, the investigations
are presented as they relate to the
following subdivisions of the ARE:

Reactor

Fuel heat disposal system

Reflector coolant heat disposal system
Control rod cooling system

Preheating and monitoring system
Helium supply and vent system

Fill and dump system

The physical properties of the
materials used in the reactor are
given in Table 1.

REACTOR

PRESSURE PULSE RESULTING FROM A
SUDDEN CHANGE IN REACTIVITY

The self-controlling features of
the ARE are due to the expansion of
the fuel with increasing temperature.
A transient increase in reactivity
produces an attendant increase in
temperature that increases the volume
of the fuel. Since the reactor has a
relatively fixed volume, some of the
fuel is forced out of the core and
the reactivity is reduced. The entire
process occurs in a very short time,
and therefore it is necessary to know
what pressures will be set up in the
fuel tubes when the fuel is rapidly

forced out of the core. Figure 2
shows the reactor and connecting piping
to the surge tanks. The fuel can

expand out of the reactor in either
direction, but since the path to the
surge tank in one direction (upstream)
is considerably shorter than in the
other, it will be assumed that all
the excess fuel takes the shorter path
to the surge tank (this is a con-
servative simplification). Further
assumptions that have been made are:

1. The fuel is incompressible.

2. The pressure pulse is of suffi-
ciently short duration that the fuel
in the external piping remains es-
sentially fixed in temperature.

3. The temperature and power
variations 1n the reactor core will be
neglected; all the reactor fuel 1s
assumed to be at the mean reactor
temperature, and the power generation
in the fuel is always equal to the
mean power generation.

4. The effects of the pressure
pulse on the fuel pumps will be neg-
lected. Precisely what effect this
pulse would have on the pumps is
unknown, but the pulse will probably
be of sufficiently short duration that
no permanent damage will be done.

Figure 3a 1s a schematic diagram
of the system to be analyzed. There
are two, distinct cases to consider:

the reactor in which the temperature
and the density of the fuel change
with time and the external piping in
which the temperature and density of
the fuel are constant. The reactor
will be considered first (Fig. 3b).
The impulse-momentum equation for any
section 1s

(1) - F dt = d(mv)
where
F = differential force on fuel volume,
1b,
t = time, sec,
m = mass in fuel volume, slugs,
v = velocityof fuel volume, ft/sec.

For a fuel volume of cross section 4,
thickness dx, and position x,

(2) m= pA Ax

where

© = mass density, slugs/ft?,

A = tube cross-sectional area, ft?,

x = distance along the tube measured

from the reactor outlet, ft.

Since the fuel is incompressible,
all the incremental fuel volume being
generated between zero and x by in-
creasing temperature must pass across
x (on the way to the reactor inlet and
thence to the surge tank) as rapidly
as the incremental volume 1s being
generated. The rate at which incre-
mental volume is being generated
between zero and x is

Since the rate at which the incremental

where v is the incremental velocity
(v = vy) in ft/sec and the subscript

The impulse-momentum equation,
Eq. 1, may be rewritten for the volume

For the external piping (Fig. 3¢),
where the temperature of the fuel is
assumed constant, Eqs. 1, 2, and 5 are
valid. However, Eq. 3 is not valid,
because no incremental volume is gener-
ated in the external piping. The -
external piping, however, must pass

Equation 19 with L' set equal to the

the variation with time of the pressure
differential across the piping.

In addition to the pressure dif-
ferential set up by the inertia of
the fuel (Eqs. 13 and 19), there are
pressure differentials resulting from
the change in friction pressure drop
associated with change in velocity.
These pressure differentials may be
evaluated by methods similar to those

The calculations of temperatures
and temperature differences were made
from the following data for beryllium
oxide, NaK, and the metal tube.

Beryllium Oxide Block. The beryllium
oxide block is hexagonal in cross
section (3.73 in. across flats). For
simplicity in calculation, the block
was assumed to be a circular cylinder
of equivalent cross-sectional area,
with an outside radius of 1.960 in,

Metal Tube. The outside radius of

expression for the temperature gradient
in the tube is the same as that for
NaK, except that Q, is the heat gener-
ated in the beryllium oxide plus the
heat generated in the Nak,

The amount of heat generation in
the fuel 1s proportional to the length

Thus high-velocity fuel will
have less heat generated within 1t
than fuel flowing at a low velocity
correspondingly, 1ts temperature
will be lower. Upon looking at the
velocity profile of fuel flowing in a
fuel tube,
velocity 1s at the center and that the
minimum velocity is at the tube wall.
From this, it that a
temperature gradient will exist between
the outer surface and the center of
the fuel. This temperature gradient
can be determined, and the expression

temperature of the outer surface of
the fuel, °F, and T__ is the tempera-

FLOW OF REFLECTOR COOLANT THROUGH CORE

In the ARE, the pressure shell, the
moderator, and the thimbles of the
control rod and instrument holes are
cooled by the circulation of NaK., The
NaK circuit (reflector coolant cir-
cuit) is shown in Fig. 1,

The coolant enters the pressure
shell at the bottom,
the lattice, and leaves at the top
(Fig, 9). The flow through the core
lattice is divided among the annulus
between the outer periphery of the
reflector and moderator can and the
pressure shell, the tubes leading
through the reflector blocks, and the
annuli around the rod and instrument
holes. For adequate cooling of the
moderator and pressure shell, it 1s

necessary to have only a minimum amount
of coolant flowing in the
around the rod and instrument holes.
The additional heat that must be
removed from the thimbles will be
carried away by the helium that cools
the rods and instruments. To obtain
this minimum flow, orifice plates
(Fig. 11) were placed in the annuli.

There will be a pressure drop in

instrument holes, three safety rods,
and one regulating rod; thus there are
six holes and six corresponding annuli,
Where the NaK enters at the bottom of
the annuli (Fig. 9), there are orifice
plates (Fig. 11). These orifice plates
reduce the outside diameters of the
annuli to 3.140 in.; the length of
each orifice plate is 1.00 in.; and

were, respectively,
po = 44.5 1b/ft3
and
uw = 0.36 lb/hr: ft .

By using Egs. 32 and 33, the inlet
and outlet losses of the pressure
shell were calculated to be

AP (inlet) = 156.3 lb/ft?
and
AP (outlet) = 78,15 lb/ft? ,
From Eqs. 32 through 35 and the

assumption that the distribution of
flow through the core lattice depends
only on the relative resistance of each

path, the distribution of flow was
found, by trial and error, to be:
FLOW BATE
PA
™ (ft3/sec)
Large annulus 0.108
Tubes through reflector 0.272
Six annuli 0.120

The pressure drop through the
lattice, which is the loss in pressure
experienced by the fluid flowing

through one path, was found to be

AP = 19.49 1b/ft? .

If the pressure drop in the spaces
above and below the core lattice 1s
neglected, the total pressure drop is

AP = 253.9 lb/ft?
= 1.76 lb/in.?% .

 

HEAT REMOVAL BY THE REFLECTOR COOLANT

A cross section of the reactor is
shown in Fig. 9; a plan view is shown
in Fig. 12. Molten NaK is circulated
through the reactor to remove the heat
generated in the reflector and to cool
the pressure shell and the walls of
rod and instrument holes.

The NaK in the interstices of the
moderator blocks in both the reactor
core and reflector is almost stagnant
and, for the purposes of the following
calculations, is assumed to be entirely
stagnant. It 1s assumed that the
electric heaters on the pressure shell
add sufficient heat to the system to
Just balance the heat loss to the
environment; therefore it is also
assumed that there is no net heat flow

across the outside of the pressure
shell.

Neutron heating aqccurs only in the
beryllium oxide, which constitutes
about 78.5% of the reactor,

It is assumed that within the
reflector the gamma and the neutron
heat generation vary linearly with
radial distance. That this assumption
is fairly valid may be observed from
Figs. 7 and 8. The following equations
for the average gamma and neutron heat
generation at any radius within the
reflector can be written:

The heat generated in the reflector
is removed by the NaK through various
interfaces; the temperature limitations
of the beryllium oxide and associated
structure are sufficiently far above

the NaK temperature that temperature
patterns in the reflector need not be
calculated.

Heat Generated in the Pressure Shell,
The heat generated in the Inconel
pressure shell is due to gamma attenu-
ation and fast-neutron scattering. The
actual variation of heat generation
with position in the top head is shown

in Fig. 13. The curve may be approxi-
mated by the exponential relationship
(42) q'= 13,200 e-9-20=
where
q' = heat generation, Btu/hr-ft?,
x = distance from inside surface, ft.

The heat generation in the bottom head
and barrel is actually less than this,
but to be conservative, it is assumed
that the curve may be used. The total
heat generation, Q, in a flat plate
of thickness 7 is given by

(43) Q =f 13,200 e%2°% dx
0

= 1450 (1 - e~%:207)

where 7 is in feet,

The Inconel pressure shell is con-
structed of 2-in,-thick plate reinforced
to 4 in, in thickness at critical

locations in the heads. Evaluation of
Eq. 43 for thicknesses, 7, of 1/6 and
1/3 ft gives

Q =
Q = 1380 Rtu/hr- ft? |

respectively.

If the barrel 1s treated as a flat
plate, the total area of the 2-in.-
thick material is 72.5 ft?, and the
total area of the 4-in.-thick material
is 9.5 ft2. Therefore the total heat
generation is 95,300 Btu/hr, or 26.5
Btu/sec. This value is probably high,
but because Fig. 13 is approximate, a
conservative value 1s desirable.

Temperature of Pressure Shell.
Inasmuch as the allowable design stress

1135 Rtu/hr* ft?

and

in the pressure shell is a function of
the pressure shell temperature, the
temperature pattern in the pressure
shell head (the most critical portion
of the pressure shell from the stand-
point of both stress and temperature)
must be calculated,

The pressure shell will be treated
as a flat plate in which there is
internal heat generation. One side of
the plate is insulated and the other

 

side 1s cooled by circulating Nak.

where
kyag = thermal conductivity of Nak,

D = NaK passage equivalent diameter,
Pe = Peclet’s number for Nak.

To assure a conservative value for the
heat transfer coefficient, the hy-
draulic diameter of the NaK passage
without the tube elbows was used as
the equivalent diameter of the Nak
passage, The diameter and other
values are

D = 0.667 ft,
kyag = 16.0 Bru/hr- ft? (°F/ft),
Pe = 148, using a velocity of 0.1

ft/sec (cf., chap, 2, “Flow of
Reflector Coolant Through
Core ”).
Therefore
h = 166 Btu/hr-ft2:°F.

The temperature at x = 7, which is,
of course, the maximum temperature
difference, can be determined:

(51) 6_ = 22.83 (1 — e207)

- 130.5 7 e" 9-207

For 7 = 2 in., 8 = 13.2°F; for 7 = 4
in., 8 = 19.8°F.

As a check on the calculation,

6, _, = 8.64 (1 — 2-207)

ho op = 166 0
= 1130 , for 7 = 1/6 ft ,
- 1370 , for 7 = 1/3 ft .

These values check very closely the
heat generated per square foot in the
two different sections. The pressure
shell, therefore, will be about 5 to
20°F hotter than the Nak.

Heat Generated in the NaK. The
calculation of heat generation in the
NaK in the reactor circuit is rather
complex, and only a gross estimate of
the heat generation is available. The
maximum heat generation in the NaK
will probably be of the order of 10
Rtu/sec* ft, with the average heat
generation being of the order of 3
Btu/sec* ft’, Since there 1s approxi-
mately 10 ft3 of NaK in the pressure
shell, the total heat generation in
the NaK will be of the order of 30
Btu/sec.

The total heat added to the re-
flector coolant circuit by heat
generation in the reflector, pressure

shell, and NaK 1s
Q = 50.2 + 26.5 + 30 = 106.7 Btu/sec

six straight sections at the inlet of

tubes and removes the heat that would
otherwise be transmitted to the hole
from the reactor; the passage between
the inner two tubes 1s packed with
insulation; helium flows inside the
inner tube and cools the rod or
instrument and the inner tube wall.
Heat 1s therefore added to the Nak
from the reactor and removed from the
NaK by the helium. Since the two
instrument holes are located in the
reflector and the heat addition to
the NaK from the reflector has already
been accounted for in the calculation
of heat generated in the reflector,
only the heat added to the NaK in the
four control rod holes remains to be
calculated. The calculation of the

 

heat removed from the NaK by the

in chap. 5,
Cooling System.
Each rod hole through the reactor
1s surrounded by six beryllium oxide
blocks, each of which contains a fuel
tube (Fig. 16). The mean fuel tempera-
ture 1n the fuel tubes 1s about
1200°F. As a simplification (similar
to that used in the calculation of
heat transfer across the boundary of
the core and reflector), the holes
and associated structure were considered
as a hollow beryllium oxide cylinder
with internal heat generation and with
the inner surface washed by NaK and
the outer surface washed by fuel.

There 1s some overlapping of fuel
tubes in the sense that some of the
tubes are members of the tube sets
encircling more than one rod hole.
This effect was neglected inasmuch as
the heat added to the NaK in the rod
holes is considerably smaller in
magnitude than the heat added elsewhere
and, hence, a rough estimate of the
heat additionis all that 1s necessary.
The actual heat transfer coefficient
in the fuel tubes was calculated and,
from this coefficient, a hypothetical
heat transfer coefficient on the side
of the cylinder was computed so that:

The heat removed from the NaK by
the helium flowing through the rod
holes is calculated in chap. 5, ‘Rod
and Instrument Cooling System,” for
the various rods and instruments.

Summary. A plot of the heat added
to the NaK circuit vs. the mean Nak
temperatures for the various sources
of heat addition is shown in Fig. 18,
A plot of the net heat that must be
removed from the NaK in the reflector
coolant heat exchangers vs. the mean
NaK temperature is shown in Fig. 19.
By cross-plotting these two figures,
the mean NaK temperature is obtained;
the cross-plot 1s shown in Fig. 19.
The mean NaK temperature is about
1172°F, and at that temperature,
640 Btu/sec (675 kw) is removed from
the reactor by the reflector cooling
system. The minimum and maximum NaK
temperatures are about 1105 and 1235°F,
respectively (Fig. 1). The maximum
pressure-shell temperature is about
20°F greater than the maximum Nak
temperature (see previous work in
this section) and is therefore about

1255°F.

PRESSURE DROP IN FUEL MANIFOLDS
AND CORE TUBES

The fuel flows from the heat
exchangers through the surge tanks
and pumps and into the inlet manifold
of the reactor, whereit is distributed
into the six parallel passes through
the core lattice. Upon leaving the
core lattice, the fuel enters the
outlet manifold. From the outlet
mani fold, the fuel is returned to the

heat exchangers. For a fuller under-
standing of the circuit, see Figs. 1
and 9. The problem is to determine
the pressure drop (or drops) of the

The pressure drop of the fuel in
flowing through the inlet manifold,
core lattice, and outlet manifold 1s
due to five factors:
curvature of the tubes or pipes,
contraction losses, expansion losses,
and losses in the pipe fittings and
square elbows. The formula for loss

In the pressure drop calculations,
it was assumed that the flow of fuel
would be equally distributed between
the six passes through the core.
Although this 1s a reasonable as-
sumption, 1t 1s not quite true, as
will be demonstrated by the calculated
data.

The same value of density was used
throughout the calculation, but the
viscosities corresponded to the mean
temperatures in the inlet manifold,
core lattice, and outlet manifold.
The properties used were:

Density, po 187 1b/f¢e’
Viscosity, KH
Inlet manifold 12.5 ep
Core lattice 9.0 cp
Outlet manifold 6.8 cp

The flow rate of the fuel was considered
to be 0.150 cfs. Figure 20 shows
sketches of the inlet and outlet
manifolds. In this figure, the
outlets of the inlet manifold are
numbered 1 to 6 and the inlets of the
outlet manifold are numbered corre-
spondingly. Thus outlet 1 of the
inlet manifold 1s connected by a tube
to inlet 1 of the outlet manifold,
etc., and the fluid paths from the
entrance tee of the inlet manifold
to the exit tee of the outlet manifold
are given designations such as “l1-1.7
The geometries of the two manifolds
are shown in Figs. 21 and 22. The
pressure drops 1n these manifolds
were calculated by using Eqs. 88
through 92.

the core lattice are often referred
to as “serpentine” tubes because each
tube has 10 bends and 11 straight

For each tube the equivalent

The pressure drop for each path through
the system being considered was easily
calculated by using the equal flow
rate assumption and Eqs. 88 and 89.

The results are tabulated in Table 7.
Of course, as can be seen, the flow
will not be distributed equally among
the six parallel paths through the
core lattice. In fact, the flow rate
may vary as much as 2.5%. Thus a
maximum temperature difference of the
order of 9°F may exist in the fuel

exit temperatures from the various

SLEEVES

The fuel tubes pass through the
pressure shell heads
shown schematically in Fig.

in the manner
23a. The
sleeve connecting the pressure shell
and fuel tube 1s at the pressure shell
at one end and at the
fuel tube temperature at the other
end. At the fuel tube outlet, the
fuel tubes are at 1500°F;
shell temperature at this point is
difficult to determine, but it is
probably not less than 1150°F, The
sleeve gains heat from the fuel tube
through the NaK between the tube and
sleeve; the NaK is assumed to be
stagnant. Heat lost by the sleeve
to the surrounding helium atmosphere
may be neglected because the helium
is at about 1200°F. The problem
was simplified by considering the
sleeve, the fuel tube, and the NaK
between the sleeve and the fuel tube
as a single cylindrical tube. The
temperature was assumed to be constant
across any cross section of this
cylindrical tube, and an average
conductivity for the tube
was used. (The conductivities of Nak
and Inconel are nearly equal.) The

Temperature in Fuel Tube Elbows as
a Result of Afterheat of Residual
Fuel. There is a possibility of fuel
remaining in the U bends of the
reactor fuel tubes after dumping.
This residual fuel will rise in
temperature because of internal heat
generation, and it is desirable to
know the maximum temperature that
will be attained. Since the activity
of the fuel decreases with time after
shutdown, an equilibrium will be
reached when the heat generation rate
is the same as the rate of the heat
loss. Once this equilibrium has been
reached, the fuel temperature will
decrease.

The total heat generation rate of
the fuel is given in another portion

FORMATION OF NONPLUGGING SOLIDS IN
FUEL TUBE IN THE EVENT OF A
SMALL LEAK

In the event of a small leak in a
fuel tube, it 1s possible that the
NaK entering the fuel tube will
precipitate solids that will adhere
to the walls of the fuel tube. This
deposit can build up to appreciable
thickness before causingany measurable
change in the flow through the fuel
tube. The temperatures which might
exist in such a deposit were calculated
by treating the solid deposit as a
flat plate, with internal heat gener-
ation, cooled on one side by the
flowing fuel. The differential
equation and boundary conditions
governing the heat flow are

The values for the maximum temper-

unless the solids found when NaK and
fuel are mixed have a lower melting
point than that of Inconel there 1s
danger that a small leak might result
in the formation of a solid deposit
which would reach a high enough
temperature to melt the Inconel tube

wall.

FUEL HEAT DISPOSAL

PERFORMANCE OF FUEL HEAT DISPOSAL
SYSTEM

Heat Transfer. The heat added to
the fuel in the reactor 1s disposed
of by circulating the fuel to a heat
exchanger where 1t gives up its heat
to helium. The hot helium is then
passed through a heat exchanger where
it gives up its heat to water. The
fuel and helium recirculate; the
water 1s dumped. There are actually
four fuel-to-helium heat exchangers
and four helium-to-water exchangers.
These exchangers are arranged (Fig. 1)
so that all four fuel-to-helium
exchangers are in parallel on the
fuel side and all four helium-to-water
exchangers are in parallel on the
water side. The helium circuits are
arranged so that there are two parallel
circuits and each circuit contains
two fuel-to-helium and two helium-to-
water exchangers in series (the
exchangers alternate, of course).
Figures 26 and 27 show the details
of the two types of heat exchangers.
The performance of the fuel heat
disposal loop over a range of operating
conditions 1s calculated below.

The fuel heat disposal system
obeys the following relations:
(1) Q = W, cg (T, - T,) )
(2) Q = Wy, cy. (Tq. - Ty.)
(3) Q=W c, (T! -T) ,
(4) Q = he ne Af He One ’
(5) Q = hye. He = w Heew ?
where
Q = heat transferred, Btu/sec,
W = weight flow, lb/sec,
T' = maximum temperature, °F,
T = minimum temperature, °F,
¢ = specific heat, Btu/lb* °F,
h = heat transfer coefficient,
Btu/sec* ft: °F,
A = heat transfer area, ft 2,
6 = effective log mean temperature

difference, °F,

SYSTEM

and the subscripts refer to

f = fuel,
He = helium,
w = water,
f-He = fuel-to-helium heat exchanger,

He-w = helium-to-waterheat exchanger.

The heat disposal systemis operated
with the following restraints and
conditions:

1. The fuel flow 1s held fixed at
28.2 1b/sec.

2. The water outlet temperature
1s thermostatically controlled and
held fixed at 135°F.

3. The water inlet temperature
will vary with the time of year, but
for this analysis i1t has been assumed
to be fixed at 70°F.

4. The mean temperature of the
fuel 1s fixed because the reactor is
self-controlling to a constant mean
temperature. The design mean tempera-
ture is 1325°F. Calculations were
also carried out for mean temperatures
of 1225 and 1425°F to give some
indication of the effect of a change
in mean fuel temperature.

The helium weight flow 1s the
independent variable; the flow 1s
controlled by variable speed hydraulic
motors which drive the two helium
blowers. The dependent variables are

0, W, Ts, T,, Ther and T,_ . Thus

there are six unknowns and six equa-

tions: the five equations listed
above and the one inherent in the
fourth condition, namely:
:
+
T; Ty

(6) —————= a constant .

Before these equations can be

solved, the heat transfer coefficients
and areas must be calculated for the

two exchangers. The over-all hA’s are

where Ag and A, have the same meanings
as previously.

The values of Dy, are 0.0438 ft for
the fuel-to-helium exchangers and
0.1365 ft for the helium-to-water
exchangers. The friction factor, f,
which is a function of Reynolds’
number, is evaluated from the Gunter-
Shaw correlation. The helium pressure
drop 1s plotted against helium volu-
metric flow for both exchangers in
Fig. 30b. The helium pressure drop is
not greatly affected by the mean fuel
temperature, and thus the curves of
Fig. 30b are valid for the range of
mean fuel temperature considered.

The pressure drops in the fuel and
in the helium for the remainder of
the fuel and helium circuits have been
calculated by using the Fanning
equation and the Cox and Germano data.
Figure 1 shows the pressure at various
points in the fuel circuit. The fuel
pressure drop external to the heat
exchangers is 40 psi; the total fuel
pressure drop is 57 psi (Fig. 2 shows
the fuel piping). Figure 31 shows the

The heat transfer coefficients on

heat disposal system calculations (cf.,
Egs. 14, 15, and 16 of chap. 3).

Table 10 contains a list of pertinent
information obtained from heat ex-
changer designs (Figs. 35 and 36) and
the heat transfer relations discussed
above. Values are given for four
different flow rates of helium and four
different flow rates of water;
were plotted from these values and used
in the solution of Egs. 1 through 5.

The data of Table 10 were used to
solve the five simultaneous equations
(Egs. 1 through 5) for various values
of the independent variable - heat

Inasmuch as the helium
flow 1s constant (see
the helium weight flow

cannot be precisely determined until
the helium temperature at the blower
(Ty,) is known. Tt was necessary
therefore to assume a helium weight
flow for each power and to solve the
equations by iteration. The results
of the solution of Egs. 1 through 5
are shown in Figs, 37 and 38, in which
the minimum and maximum NaK and helium
temperatures are plotted against heat
transferred. The mean NaK temperature
is also shown in Fig. 37.

The pressure drops in the NaK and
in the helium have been calculated for
the exchangers. The NaK pressure drop
was calculated with the use of the

COQ LING OF THE SAFETY RODS

During normal reactor operation,
the safety rods are not in the reactor
but are withdrawn into sleeves above
the reactor. The safety rods themselves
are in a cool area, and the only cooling
problem, then, 1s that of cooling the
sleeve in the reactor. The equations
governing this process are quite
straightforward and are listed below:

 

(1) Q = We (Ty, - Ty.) ,
(2) Q = hAG + Q, ,
(3) h4A 1 + 1
(hA) x (hA)
1 1 1 -1

where

Q = heat transferred to helium,

W = weight flow of helium, lb/sec,

c, = specific heat of helium,
Btu/1b* °F,
T' = maximum temperature, F,

T = minimum temperature, °F,

h = heat transfer coefficient,
Btu/sec* ft? (°F/ft),

A = heat transfer area, ft?,

0 = effective log mean temperature
difference between the NaK and
the helium,

Q, = heat generated in the sleeve by

nuclear radiation, Btu/sec,
and the subscripts

He = he lium,

n = inner metal wall.

evaluated as follows:

Equations 1 through 10 and the
dimensions shown in Figs. 42 and 9
were used to calculate the exit tempera-
ture of the helium and the heat trans-
ferred to the helium; an inlet helium
temperature of 150°F was assumed. The
properties of helium were eva luated
at the mean helium temperature. The
range of helium weight flows considered
was from 0,005 to 0.100 1b/sec, and
the calculations were made for mean
NaK temperatures of 1000, 1150, and
1300°F. The results of the
putations are shown in Figs, 43, 44,
and 45,

The helium heat transfer coefficient,

Eq. 9, with the helium properties
corresponding to the maximum helium
temperature being used. The maximum
wall temperature was evaluated by
using Eq. 11, and the results are
shown in Figs. 43, 44, and 45.

COOLING OF THE REGULATING ROD

During normal operation, the
position of the regulating rod may
vary from a position completely out
of the reactor to a position where
the midpoint of the stainless steel
slug is coincident with the center line

the situation is exactly the same as
that analyzed in the previous section
on the safety rods, the triple-walled

is more complex; the case of the

Eq. 3;

It may be noted that the arith-
metical-average temperature is used
in Eq. 16 to evaluate the heat trans-
ferred by thermal radiation. This is
only an approximation, but a check
has indicated that 1t 1s not too
greatly in error. Equations 12
through 16 and the dimensions shown
in Figs. 42, 46, and 47 were used to
calculate for the various sections the
exit temperature of the helium and the
heat transferred to the helium; an
inlet temperature to the rod hole
of 150°F was assumed. The prop-
erties of helium were evaluated
at the mean temperatures, and the values
of Q. and gq, are shown in Fig. 48.
The range of helium weight flows
considered was 0.015 to 0.025 lb/sec;
average NaK temperatures of 1000,
1150, and 1300 were used, as before.
The results of the calculations are
shown in Figs. 49, 50, 51, and 52,
which show the helium temperature
and the heat transferred to the helium
at the end of sections 2 and 3 plotted
against helium flow for the various
NaK temperatures.

The maximum temperature of the
sleeve and the rod can be calculated

MONITORING AND PREHEAT SYSTEM

HEAT LOSS THROUGH INSULATION

The heat loss to the environment of
the various pieces of equipment in the
three ARE pits is complicated by the
fact that the pits are filled with
helium. The helium tends to replace
the air in the pores of the insulation
and thus to increase the thermal
conductivity of the insulation. The
for the thermal
conductivity of porous insulating
materials was derived by Maxwell and

following formula

The ARE uses three types of insu-

The reactor of the ARE, with its
large mass of beryllium oxide, has the
largest heat capacity of any piece of
equipment in the ARE. The reactor must
be raised to a high temperature before
the system can be filled with fuel
carrier, since the fuel carrier has a
melting point of approximately 950°F,
Figures 9 and 12 show elevation and
plan views of the reactor; Fig. 9 shows
the reactor andits thermal insulation,
which 1s attached to a metal shell
that is separate from the reactor,
The heat is supplied by electrical
strip heaters strapped to the reactor
itself. The procedure for preheating
the reactor will be the following:
1. turn the heaters on at a power of

10 kw;
2. increase the heater power as the
pressure shell temperature 1in-

creases so that the heater power
is equal to 10 kw plus the heat
loss through the insulation;

3. when the pressure shell tempera-
ture reaches 1200°F, gradually
reduce the heater power to hold
the pressure shell temperature at
1200°F,

When no further changes in heater

power are required to hold the pressure

shell at 1200°F, equilibrium will have
been attained and the preheat process
completed.

Steps 1 and 2 in the preheat process
imply that a constant amount of heat
is being added to the reactor, namely,
10 kw. This method of preheating will

result in a quasi-stationary tempera- shells, 3 ft long and 3.75 in. thick,

ture state being set up in the reactor
after some initial period. A quasi-
stationary temperature means that the
temperature difference between any two
points remains constant even though
the entire temperature level is rising.
The preheating process can therefore
be broken up three periods:
l. the initial period before the

guasi-stationary state is obtained,

into

2. the period when the reactor is in
the quasi-stationary temperature
state,

3. the period after the pressure shell
has reached 1200°F, during which
the heater power is being gradually
reduced and the quasi-stationary
state no longer exists.

The following assumptions were made
for the calculation of the reactor
preheating:

1. The reactor will be represented

by six concentric beryllium oxide

82

separated by helium shells 0.050 in.
wide.

2. The pressure shell will be con-
structed of Inconel and will be 48 in.
in inside diameter and 2 in. thick.

3. There will be a 1/16 in. helium
the shell
outer beryllium oxide cylinder.

4. The heat loss from the ends of
the reactor will be considered, but
longitudinal heat flow within the
reactor will be neglected,

The following physical properties,
which represent mean values between

gap between pressure and

100 and 1200°F, were used in the
analysis:

n should be considered. The above
approach 1s a conservative simplifi-
cation, however, because 1t leads to
larger values of Af .)

The results of the solution of Egs.

gives the difference in temperature

tween the outside of the pressure
shell and any radial position. The
difference between the outside of the
pressure shell and the center of the
reactor is 162°F.

The time required to reach the
quasli-stationary temperature state may
be readily calculated. The reactor is

of the core will still be at about
ambient temperature. The actual
ambient temperature in the pits will
probably vary during the preheating

to maintain a constant rate of heat

Equations 14 through 17 and the
following data were used to calculate
the heat loss through the insulation
for various pressure shell tempera-
tures:

1. € = 1.0.

2. The data of King(!®) were used
to evaluate h,.

3. The dimensions of thermal insu-
lation were:

Outside diameter 76.25 in.

Outside length 80.5 in.

Thickness 6 in. (4 in. of Superex, 2
in. of Asbestos-Sponge)

4. The thermal conductivity value
for the insulation, as found in the
previous section on “Heat Loss Through
Insulation,” was used.

The results of the calculation are
shown in Fig. 65, where the heat loss
through the insulation 1s plotted
against the reactor pressure shell
outer temperature. Temperatures at
other points in the reactor thermal
insulation are shown by the dotted line.

The last portion of the preheating
process, that is, when the heater power
is reduced to maintain the pressure
shell outer temperature at 1200°F, is
evaluated by a graphical method de-
veloped by Schmidt.(?%) As a simplifi-
cation, each helium shell 1s divided
between adjacent beryllium oxide
shells, and the Inconel pressure shell
is replaced by an equivalent thickness
of beryllium oxide. The reactor is
then treated as a homogeneous cylinder
with a thermal conductivity equal to
the average thermal conductivity of
the composite beryllium oxide and
helium shells. A plot of the tempera-
tures in the reactor for the first 8
hr of the last portion of the pre-
heating period is shown in Fig. 66.

HELIUM LEAKAGE THROUGH CLEARANCE HOLES

The tubes which contain the control
rods and fission chambers pierce the
reactor thermal insulation at both the
top and bottom, and there are six such
tubes. Figure 68 shows a sketch of a
typical tube and the passage through
the reactor thermal shield. The helium
inside the reactor thermal shield,
being at a higher temperature than the
room helium, will flow through the
clearance holes in the reactor thermal
insulation and consequently will add

It was assumed that the flow through

which are kept cool by the use of
space coolers. A typical space cooler
is shown in Fig. 69. Each space cooler
contains two helium blowers in parallel
(total capacity 7200 cfm) and a water
cooling coil. The entire unit was
supplied by the Trane Co. The cooling
coil is a Trane Co., series 93, type S
coil, with a 12- by 48-in. face and
four rows of tubes longitudinal to the
gas flow. The heat transfer coefficient
of such a coil, operating with air on
one side and water on the other, 1s
given in ref, 21, for various water
and air velocities. As used in the
ARE, these coils will have helium
instead of air on the gas side.

Since 1t was necessary to convert
the performance data from those for
air-to-water operation to those for
helium-to-water operation, the follow-
ing equation, from which values can be
obtained that are approximately the
same as the actual performance data
given in ref. 21, was used:

velocity, that is, the air velocity
which would give the same heat transfer
coefficient as the actual helium
velocity, had to be calculated. Since
the fin efficiency of the coil fins 1s
very close to 100% at all times (sheet
fins of aluminum, 0.012 in. thick,
with the tubes on a triangular pitch
of approximately 1.2 in.), it may be
assumed that the gas-side heat transfer
coefficient is a function of the
Reynolds’ number to the 0.6 power.
Since the Prandtl’s numbers for air
and for helium are about the same at
this temperature and since the geometry
of the coil is unchanged, the equivalent
air velocity can be calculated from
the following equation:

where
k = thermal conductivity,

© = density,

LL = viscosity,

h = heat transfer coefficient,
v_ = equivalent air velocity,
Vie © helium velocity.
Since the equivalent air velocity
(calculated above) and the water flow
are known, the over-all hA can be
calculated from Eq. 20.

The equations governing the operation
of the space coolers are

(22) Q = Waecp, (The - Ty.) !

(23) Q = We (T,-T,),

(24) Q = RAG ,

where
Q = heat transferred, Btu/sec,

W = weight flow, lb/sec,
cp = specific heat, Btu/lb*°F,
T' = maximum temperature (also equals
ambient temperature), °F,
T = minimum temperature, °F,

and the subscript w refers to water.
The system operates under the following
restraints and conditions:

1. The helium flow is 7200 cfm at
blower temperature.

2. The outlet water temperature 1s
thermostatically controlled to be 100°F.

3. The inlet water temperature
varies with the season of the year but
is assumed to be 70°F for this calcu-
lation.

Equations 20 through 24 and the
restraints and condition listed above
can be used to evaluate the performance
of the space coolers. Figure 70 shows
the variation of heat transferred vs.
ambient temperature for one of the
space coolers. (The heat exchanger
pit contains four such units; the
other pits each contain two units.)
The difference between the maximum
helium temperature (ambient) and the
minimum helium temperature 1s small;
that 1s, i1t varies from about 0.2 deg
at a heat load of 25 Btu/sec to about
1.6 deg at a heat load of 200 Btu/sec.

The heat rejected to the ambient
atmosphere in the three ARE pits from
the various items of equipment in the
pits, calculated in the previous
section on “Heat Loss Through Insu-

lation,” is tabulated in the following:
Reactor pit 30 kw
Heat exchanger pit 135
Dump tank pit 75
Total 240 kw

The three pits are interconnected by
passages of relatively small flow area.
Therefore the pits will not operate at
the same temperature, nor will they
operate at the temperatures which
would exist 1f the pits were com-
pletely sealed from one another. The
pit operating temperatures were calcu-
lated for the two extreme cases (pits
at the same temperature; pits completely
independent) by using the data of
Fig. 70, which gives the space cooler
performance. It was assumed that the
heat loss from the pits to the outside
through the concrete walls could be
neglected; this 1s a conservative
assumption. Table 17 gives the heat
losses in the pits.

The pits will therefore operate at a
temperature of about 110 to 120°F, Tt
should be noted that all the heat loss
calculations in the section on “Heat
Loss Through Insulation’’ were made with
an assumed ambient temperature of 130°F
Therefore the heat losses listed in
Table 17 are slightly low. The dif-
ference is quite small, however, inas-
much as the surface temperature of most
of the equipment losing heat is from

1150 to 1500°F.

TEMPERATURE PATTERNS IN THE MONITORING
ANNULUS IN THE EVENT OF HEAT FAILURE

The fuel and reflector coolant
systems of the ARE are entirely enclosed
in ametallic envelope (Fig. 71). This
envelope consists of concentric tubing

around all the pipes, and conveniently
shaped containers around the other
such as valves and
pumps. circulated in the
space between the metallic envelope
systems to two

items of equipment,
Helium 1s
and the main serve
purposes. The helium 1s continuously
sampled by instruments which can detect
the presence of small quantities of
fuel or NaK vapor and thus give warning
1f a leak develops in the system
(hence the name, “monitoring system'’),
The flowing helium also acts as a
distributor of heat in the following
manner, Most of the electric heaters
of the main system are on the outside
of the envelope. Should a heater
failure occur, the flowing helium, by
transporting heat from the heated to
the unheated areas, will tend to make
uniform the heat distributed to the
systems and, consequently, to reduce
the temperature gradients which would
otherwise occur.

The locations where the heat distri-
bution function is particularly
critical are in the fuel dump-and-fill
lines. As may be noted from the
position of the valves in Fig. 2, the
fuel dump-and-fill lines may stand full
of stagnant fuel during the operation
of the reactor, Consequently, in the
event of a heater failure, it is
possible for the fuel carrier to freeze
in these lines and make dumping of the
reactor impossible. However, a helium
bleed line will be connected to the
fuel-carrier line to prevent drainage.
The temperature patterns that would
occur in these fuel-carrier lines and
their 1f there were a
particularly bad heater failure were

For simplicity,

the electric
heaters 1s assumed to be generated
directly in the wall of the concentric
tube which serves as the metallic
envelope. The pipe line 1s divided
into seven sections:

1. Sections 1 and 7 are the un-
affected areas of the pipe lines up-
stream and downstream of the area
where the heater failures occurred.

2. Sections 2, 4, and 6 are the
areas where the heaters on both sides
of the pipe failed.

3. Sections 3 and 5 are the areas
where the heaters (which separate the
failed heaters) are still operative.

In the steady-state condition, the
fuel pipe temperature will be equal to
the temperature of the flowing helium,
Therefore only the heat transfer be-
tween the helium, the metallic envelope,
and the outside environment needs to
be considered. The heat balance in a
given section of pipe line in the

HELIUM SUPPLY AND VENTING SYSTEM

TRUE HOLDUP OF FISSION GASES IN TANKS

The fission gases removed along
with helium through the various gas
vents in the fuel circuit are held up
in the pipes and tanks of the off-gas
system (Fig. 79) until the activity
in the fission gases is reduced suf-
ficiently to permit their being
discharged into the stack. The holdup
time of the gases in pipe lines or
similar shapes of large length-to-
diameter ratio is readily calculated
as the pipe volume divided by the gas
volume flow rate. All the gas is held
up substantially the same amount of
time. In large tanks or similar shapes
of small length-to-diameter ratio,
the average gas holdup time is the
same as 1n a pipe line of similar
volume. because of the
mixing of the gas in the tank, not
all the gas is held up for substantially
equal periods; that is, some of the
gas leaving the holdup tank is held
up for much less than average time and
The
true activity of the gases leaving the
holdup tank (Fig. 80) of the off-gas
system has been calculated and
compared with the activity which would
be present 1f all gases were held up
for equal periods.

However,

some for much more than average.

The mixing of the gas in the tank
1s due to convective and diffusive
forces and occurs fairly rapidly
compared with the average holdup time
in the tank. Thereasonably conservative
assumption was made that the gas
entering the tank mixes instantaneously
with the gas in the tank. The follow-
ing definitions were made for the
calculations:

N = flow rate of gas,

V = tank volume, fl,
C(t)

concentration of gases of
age t, that is, C(t) dt equals
the ratio of the volume of gas
with age from t to t t+ dt

time the gases enter the off-
gas system),

where t, is the age of the oldest
gases 1n the tank. The total energy
in all the fission gases developed
may be used since the final answer
desired 1s a ratio.

It 1s important to note that for
Eq. 10 it is assumed that all the

gases 1n the tank contain equal amounts
of fission gases. This is obviously
not true of the gas originally in the
tank. Thus, at the beginning of
operation, the value of R is actually
less than 1s predicted by Eq. 10. The
highest possible values of R will
occur after long periods of operation,
and Eq. 10 will therefore be evaluated
with t, sufficiently large for the
contribution to the total activity of
the gases of age greater than t, to be
neglected.

The curve of E(t) vs. t shown in
Fig. 83 for the total energy of all
xenon and krypton isotopes was broken
up into a series of M segments between
t, and t_, and an equation of exponential
form was fitted to each segment.

The data and results of the calcu-
lations for the particular problem of
the first holdup tank in the off-gas
system are given in Table 19,

As a check on whether the intervals
selected were small enough, the
interval between t; and t, was divided
into two parts. Recalculation of the
data for the smaller intervals is
given in Table 20.

The valueof 295 checks very closely
with the value of 296 calculated for
the original intervals, and thus the
intervals selected were probably small
enough,

The final answer, then, is that the
actual activity of the gases coming
out of the tank is 23% greater than
the activity which would be present

TEMPERATURES IN THE HELIUM VENT LINES
CONTAINING FISSION GASES

The off-gas system carries gases
from the surge tanks, the dump tank,
and the pits to the exhaust stack
(Fig. 79). At times, a portion of
these gases will be radioactive fission
products. The gas flow rate is
generally quite low, and the question
arises as to what temperatures will
exist on the off-gas system with
essentially stagnant radioactive
gases in the system. The total energy
ofall the fission gases produced after
200 hr of reactor operation at 3
megawatts is about 14.8 Btu/sec for a
delay time of 1 1/2 minutes. (??) The

The 2-in. IPS pipeis neither heated
nor insulated, and therefore Eq. 15
may be used to calculate the pipe
outside temperature (the inside temper-
ature is not greatly different). For
an emissivity of 0.5, the pipe outside
temperature necessary to dissipate

0.265 Btu/sec*lineal ft is about 380°F.

VACUUM PUMP PERFORMANCE

There are two vacuum pumps in the
off-gas system (Figs. 79 and 85).
They serve many purposes, but their
most severe requirement is that they
must reduce the pressure in the fuel
system sufficiently to permit the
boiling off of NaK which cannot be
completely drained from this system
(NaK is circulated in the fuel system
for precleaning and hot testing).
Figures 86 and 87 give the experi-
mentally determined performance of the
two vacuum pumps. Figure 86 shows
the variation of pressure with time
in a pump-down test of a 12,3-ft?
tank; Fig. 87 the rate of
pressure rise due to leakage after the

curves of the variation of rate of
change of pressure with pressure were
drawn, as shown in Fig, 88.

If a leak develops in the system,
it may be desirable to remove all the
NaK from the system. In order to boil
off NaK at 1200°F, a pressure of
about 100 mm Hg or less must be
maintained. The following calculations
were made to determine the maximum

size of leak which might exist and
still permit the vacuum pumps to
maintain a pressure of 100 mm Hg.

The values of volumetric flow, dV/dt,
as calculated from the pump-down test
results, are given in Table 22. The
values are for pump inlet conditions;
that is, the pressure is equal to the
system pressure and the temperature 1s
approximately 560°R, since the gas is
cooled before 1t reaches the vacuum
pumps.

The vacuum pumps are of the rotary
positive displacement type, and it
would therefore be expected that the
volumetric flow would decrease slightly
with decreasing pressure, since the
leakage past the rotor increases. It
is apparent from the calculated values
of volumetric flow, dV/dt, that the
curves of Fig. 88 are probably somewhat
inaccurate. The inaccuracy 1s not
entirely unexpected because the
information for Fig. 88 was obtained
by measuring the slopes of the curves
of Fig, 86, and the measurements were
not highly accurate. The accuracy is
of the orderof *10%, however, which is
sufficient for the purpose of the
problem.

The values in Table 22 for volumetric
flow are for pumping air. The leakage
past the rotor when pumping helium may
be somewhat higher than when pumping
air, but 1t is probably accurate
enough to assume that the volumetric
flows are the same for both helium and
air.

The volumetric flow of helium
through a leak can be approximated by
considering a hypothetical “leak” in

the form of a round orifice:

For system pressures less than

the orifice will be constant. The

Chapter 8
DUMP AND FILL SYSTEM

FUEL DUMP TANK COOLING

The heat generated in the fuel
after shutdown of the reactor can
easily be taken up by the heat capacity
of the fuel and the fuel system without
overheating. However, once the fuel
is in the hot fuel dump tank, it is
desirable to keep the temperature of
this tank below a reasonable level.
Therefore heat is removed by allowing
helium to pass through the 91 coolant
tubes of the tank (Fig. 89).

It is postulated that the maximum
heat removal rate necessary is 50
Btu/sec. The problem of cooling this
tank does not lend itself readily to
analytical calculation. However, the
cooling was analyzedby free-convection
calculations and by chimney-effect
methods. Both methods are outlined
below.

The equation for free convection
heat transfer is

(1) Q, = h4d
where
Q, = heat removed by convection,
Btu/sec,

h = free-convection heat transfer
coefficient taken at mean helium
temperature, Btu/sec* ft: °F,

A = 91 times surface area of inside
of a coolant tube, ft?

6 = temperature difference between

the inside surface of tube and
mean helium temperature, °F.

The value of the free-convection
heat transfer coefficient for each
helium temperature was calculated from
the Nusselt’s number. The Nusselt’s
number is given as a function of the
product of Grashof’s and Prandtl’s
numbers on p. 525 of ref. 14. It
is realized that the length-to-diameter
ratio of the coolant tube 1s too
great for use of these correlations;
however, they were theonly correlations
available, and an order of magnitude
estimate could be gained by using
them.

The inside diameter of each coolant
tube is 2.067 in. and the length is
3.1 feet. The temperature of the
inside surface was taken to be 1325°F
over the entire length of the tube.

Mean temperature valueswere assumed
for the helium in the coolant tube,
and from these and Eq. 1,
obtained of heat removed vs. mean
helium temperature. The mean tempera-
ature corresponding to a heat removal
rate of 50 Btu/sec is 1025°F. This
corresponds to an outlet temperature of
1920°F, since the inlet temperature
was assumed to be 135°F, A lower
outlet temperature would mean a greater
heat removal rate. Thus, apparently
the dump tank will be adequately
cooled.

LOCATED DIP TUBE

Upon heating a flush-and-fill tank
containing helium, the temperature
of the dip tube will lagthe temperature
of the helium and metal walls of the
tank during the heating process
(Fig. 90). The temperature of the
helium will follow very closely the
temperature of the tank walls.

Heat is transmitted to the dip tube
by free convection of the helium and
by thermal radiation from the wall.
The difference in temperature between
the dip tube and the wall has been
determined at various wall temperatures
for certain heating rates.

The net heat input to the tank,
excluding loss, is

Q=gq; tt qq t+ qp,

where
dt At
qr = (We); ar = (Hey) gp >5—)
and
_ dt At
RL a

The term dt/d7 can be replaced by
At/A7 without much error if ATis
small,

The value of gq, is given by

The emissivity is

OTHER INVESTIGATIONS

AFTERHEAT IN FISSION PRODUCTS

In order to analyze many of the
problems which arise in the ARE,
it 1s necessary to know the decay
energy of the fission products at
various times after reactor shutdown.
Reference 23 gives the average dis-
integration energy of the fission
products as a function of time after
fission. This curve (ref. 23, Fig. 6a),
reproduced as Fig. 92 of this report,
cannot be used directly, however,
because the fissions in the reactor
occur over a considerable period of
time and the fission products, conse-
quently, have a wide range of ages.
The decay energy of the fission products

may be expressed as

For these calculations, 1t was
considered that the power had been
constant and equal to 2850 kw, which
equals 2700 Btu/sec or 1.78 x 101°
Mev/sec. If it is assumed that there
is 190 Mev of energy released per
fission, then the fission rate, P, is
9.37 x 10'® fission/sec. Substitution
of these values for P and K in Eq. 1
gives

(2) Q=14.22 ['% (1) dt
th

In order to integrate Eq. 2, it is
necessary to find a function to fit
the curve of g(t) as given in Fig. 92.
This was done by dividing the curve
into three parts and fitting each of
these parts with a different power

function. The resulting equations are
(3) q(t) = 0.708 ¢-°-72

(4) g(t) = 6.43 ¢- 1-16

(5) g(t) = 3.27 t=1+2 + 95.4 ¢- 1.4
(Eq. 5 is the equation recommended in

ref. 23 for old fission products).

Equations 3, 4, and 5, were used for
integrating Eq. 2 for various values
of time after reactor shutdown (t,)
and for 100 hr of reactor operation
(t, = t; + 3.60 x 10%). The results

are tabulated in the following:

TIME AFTER DECAY ENERGY OF THE
REACTOR SHUTDOWN FISSION PRODUCTS
(sec) (Btu/sec)
10° 207
103 119
104 58.8
10° 17.7
3.16 x 10° 4.1
108 1.4
107 0.1

These values of decay energy include
the energy carried by neutrinos. The
energy of the neutrinos is essentially
unabsorbable and, consequently, the
actual absorbable decay energy of the
fission products is less than that
tabulated A rough estimate of
the absorbable energy can be obtained
by takingone half thetotal energy, (23>
with the results shown in Fig. 93,
where the absorbable decay energy in
the fission products is plotted as a
function of the time after reactor

shutdown for the conditions of this
case (2850 kw, 100hr, 190 Mev/fission).

TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN
THERMOCOUPLE ON PIPE WALL
AND BULK FLUID

The bulk temperatures of the fluids
in the fuel and NaK loops of the
ARE are measured by thermocouples
welded to the outside of the pipe
walls in which the fluid flows. The

ature has been calculated for the
most serious case, that is, the fuel
circuit (Fig. 94).

Since the fuel film temperature
drop is small and the Reynolds’
numbers are high, the difference
between the fuel bulk temperature
(the so-called “mixing cup” tempera-
ture) and the fuel maximum temperature
will be very small. The total differ-
ence between the fuel bulk temperature

At other thermocouple locations in
the fuel circuit, the temperature
drop in the fuel film 1s less than the
drop calculated above because the above

lation thickness and the minimum

system. The temperature drop in the

differential between the outside of a
pipe and the bulk of the fluid is
approximately 4.6°F. It is important
to note that 1f the flow rates in

during operation, the temperature

differential between the outside of the
pipe wall and the bulk of the fluid
will increase.
temperature differential,

not become serious so long as the

to render the thermocouple unreliable.
