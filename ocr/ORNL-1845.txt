FOREWORD

The operation of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE) culminated four years of
endeavor at ORNL in the field of nuclear propulsion of aircraft, The final success
of the experiment is a tribute to the efforts of the 300-odd technical and scientific
personnel who constitute the ANP Project at ORNL, as well as those others who were
less prominently engaged in the fabrication, assembly, and installation of the experi-
ment. The project was capably directed toward this goal during its formative years by
Dr. R. C. Briant (now deceased), and subsequently by W., H. Jordan and S. J, Cromer,
currently Director and Co-Director, respectively.

This is the second in a series of three reports which summarize the ARE experience
and is concerned primarily with the nuclear operation of the reactor. The experiment
is described, and the data obtained during the time from the start of the critical experi-
ment until the reactor was shut down for the last time are analyzed. The material is
presented in essentially chronological order, and frequent reference is made to appended
material which includes important detailed data and information that may not be of

general interest.

OPERATION OF THE AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

SUMMARY

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE) was oper-
ated successfully and without untoward difficulty
in November 1954. The following statements sum-
marize the notable information obtained from the
experiment.

1. The reactor became critical with a mass of
32.8 Ib of U233, which gave a concentration of
23.9 Ib of U235 per cubic foot of fluoride fuel.
For operation at power, the U235 content of the
fuel mixture was increased to 26.0 Ib/ft3, and thus
the final composition of the fuel mixture was 53.09
mole % NaF, 40.73 mole % ZrF,, and 6.18 mole %
UF,.

2. The maximum power level for sustained oper-
ation was 2.5 Mw, with a temperature gradient of
355°F; the maximum fuel temperature at this level
was 1580°F. Temperatures as high as 1620°F were
recorded during transients.

3. From the time the reactor first went critical
until the final shutdown, 221 hr had elapsed, and
for the final 74 hr the power was in the megawatt
range (0.1 to 2.5 Mw). The total integrated power
was about 96 Mw-hr.

4. While at power the reactor exhibited excellent
stability and it was easily controlled because of
its high negative temperature coefficient of re-
activity, which made the reactor a slave to the

load placed upon it. The fuel temperature coef-
ficient was -9.8 x 10~° (Ak/k)/°F, and the over-
all coefficient for the reactor was 6.1 x 107°.

5. Practically all the gaseous fission products
and probably some of the other volatile fission
products were removed from the circulating fuel.
In a 25-hr run at 2.12 Mw the upper limit of the
reactor poisoning due to xenon was 0.01% Ak/k.
No more than 5% of the xenon stayed in the molten
fluoride fuel.

6. The total time of operation at high tempera-
ture (1000 to 1600°F) for the sodium circuit was
635 hr, and, for the fluoride fuel system, 462 hr.
During most of the operating period the sodium
was circulated at 150 gpm and the fuel at 46 gpm.

7. The fabricability and compatibility of the
materials system, i.e., fluoride fuel, sodium coolant,
and Inconel structure, were demonstrated, at least
for the operating times, temperatures, and flux
levels present.

8. All components and, with few exceptions, all
instrumentation performed according to design
specifications. The performance of the pumps was
particularly gratifying, and the low incidence of
instrumentation failure was remarkable in view of
the quantity and complexity of the instruments
used.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) project
at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory was formed
in the fall of 1949, at the request of the Atomic
Energy Commission, to provide technical support
to existing Air Force endeavors in the field. The
ORNL effort gradually expanded and, following the
recommendation of the Technical Advisory Board
in the summer of 1950, was directed toward the
construction and operation of an aircraft reactor
experiment. A complete description of the ARE
falls naturally into three categories that correspond
to the three phases of the project: (1) design and
installation, (2) operation, and (3) postoperative
examination. Each of these phases is covered by
a separate report, ORNL-1844, ORNL-1845, and
ORNL-1868, respectively. Much detailed infor-
mation pertaining to the selection of the reactor
type and to the design, construction, and pre-
nuclear operation of the reactor experiment will be
presented in ORNL-1844. As the title of this
report (ORNL-1845) indicates it is concerned
primarily with the operation of the experiment, and
only insofar as they are necessary or useful to the
understanding or evaluation of the nuclear oper-
ation are design and preliminary operational data
included herein. The third report (ORNL-1868)
will describe the aftermath of the experiment, with
particular reference to corrosion, radiation effects,
and the decay of activity — effects that cannot be
evaluated at this time because of the high level of
the radioactivity of the equipment.

The specific operating objectives were to
attain a fuel temperature of 1500°F, with a 350°F
temperature rise across the reactor, and to operate
the system for approximately 100 Mw-hr. Other
objectives of the experiment were to obtain as
much experimental data as possible on the reactor
operational characteristics. The extent to which
each of these objectives was fulfilled is described
herein, and a measure of the success of the program
is thus provided.

Although it was initially planned to use a

sodium-cooled, solid-fuel-element reactor, the
reactor design evolved first to that of a sodium-
cooled, stationary-liquid-fuel reactor and, finally,
to that of a circulating-fuel reactor employing
sodium as a reflector coolant. These evolutionary
processes left their mark on the experiment, par-
ticularly in that the reactor had to incorporate a
moderator geometry that was originally specified
and ordered for the sodium-cooled reactor. The
adaptation of this moderator geometry to the
circulating-fuel reactor resulted in a reactor in
which the fuel stream was divided into six parallel
circuits, each of which made numerous passes
through the core. These fuel passages were not
drainable — a condition which caused considerable
concern throughout the course of the experiment.

Although it is not the purpose of this report to
give a detailed history of the design, construction,
or preliminary testing of the reactor system, the
final design and pertinent prenuclear operation are
briefly described. The bulk of the report concerns
the operation of the experiment from the time
uranium was added to the fuel system on October 30
until the evening of November 12, when the reactor
was shut down for the fast time. In addition to
the description of the various experiments and
analyses of the data which are presented in the
body of the report, the entire nuclear operation,
as recorded in the ‘Nuclear Log,’ is given in
Appendix T. The report also includes a number
of recommendations based on the operating ex-
perience, and much detailed supporting data and
information not appropriate for inclusion in the
body of the report are given in the other ap-
pendixes.

The various experiments that were performed

on the ARE were designated as E, L, or H series,
depending upon whether they occurred during the
critical experiment, low-power operation, or high-
power operation, respectively. Each of these
experiments, as listed below, is discussed in
this report.

2. DESCRIPTION OF THE REACTOR EXPERIMENT

The ARE consisted of the circuiating-fuel
reactor and the associated pumps, heat transfer
equipment, controls, and instrumentation required
for its safe operation. A schematic arrangement of
the reactor system is shown in Fig. 2.1. The
major functional parts of the system are discussed
briefly below. The physical plant is described in
Appendix U. A detailed description of the reactor
and the associated system may be found in the
design and installation report.’ A summary of the
design and operational data, including a detailed
flow sheet of the experiment, is given in Ap-
pendix B.

REACTOR

The reactor assembly consisted of a 2-in.-thick
Inconel pressure shell in which beryllium oxide
moderator and reflector blocks were stacked around
fuel tubes, reflector cooling tubes, and control
assemblies. Elevation and plan sections of the
reactor are shown in Figs. 2.2 and 2.3. The
innermost region of the lattice assembly was the
core, which was a cylinder approximately 3 ft in
diameter and 3 ft long. The beryllium oxide was
machined into small hexagonal blocks which were
split axially and stacked to effect the cylindrical
core and reflector. Each beryllium oxide block in
the core had a 1.25-in. hole drilled axially through

its center for the passage of the fuel tubes. The
outer 7.5 in. of beryllium oxide served as the
reflector and was located between the pressure
shell and the cylindrical surface of the core. The
reflector consisted of hexagonal beryllium oxide
blocks, similar to the moderator blocks, but with
0.5-in. holes.

The fuel stream was divided into six parallel
circuits at the inlet fuel header, which was located
above the top of the core and outside the pressure
shell. These circuits each made 11 series passes
through the core, starting close to the core axis,
and progressing in serpentine fashion to the
periphery of the core, and finally leaving the core
through the bottom of the reactor. The six circuits
were connected to the outlet header. Each tube
was of 1.235-in.-0OD seamless Inconel tubing with
a 60-mil wall. The combination of parallel and
series fuel passes through the core was largely
the result of the need for assuring turbulent flow
in a system in which the fluid properties and tube
dimensions were fixed.

The reflector coolant, i.e., sodium, was admitted
into the pressure shell through the bottom. The
sodium then passed up through the reflector tubes,
bathed the inside walls of the pressure shell,
filled the moderator interstices, and left from the
plenum chamber at the top of the pressure shell.
The sodium, in addition to cooling the reflector
and pressure shell, acted as a heat transfer medium

The fuel expansion volume around the impeller
cavity provided the only liquid-to-gas interface
in the fuel system. While speeds up to 2000 rpm
could be attained with the 15-hp d-c pump motor,
the desired fuel flow of 46 gpm was attained at
a speed of 1080 rpm. Although only one pump
was used in the experiment, a spare fuel pump,
isolated from the operating pump and in parallel
with it, was provided.

From the pump the fuel flowed to the reactor,

where it was heated, then to two parallel fuel-to-
helium heat exchangers, and back to the pump.
The cycle time was about 47 sec at full flow, of

which approximately 8 sec was the time required
for the fuel to pass through the core. The two
fuel-to-helium heat exchangers were each coupled
to a helium-to-water heat exchanger. The heat
extracted from the fuel was transferred via the
helium to water, and the water — the ultimate
heat sink — was discharged. The helium flow rate
in the fuel-to-helium heat exchanger loop was
controlled through a magnetic clutch that coupled
the blower to a 50-hp motor. Control of the helium
flow rate in this manner permitted smooth control
at any reactor power at which the heat generation
was great enough for the temperature coefficient
to be the controlling factor.

Fig. 2.5. Fuel Pump,

As shown in Fig. 2.4, the fuel system was
connected with two fill tanks (only one of which
was used) and one dump tank which had provisions
for removing the afterheat from the fuel.

The relatively high melting point of the circu-
lating fuel (about 1000°F for the NoF-ZrF ,-UF
fuel containing 6.18% UF,) required that all
equipment within which it was circulated be
heated sufficiently to permit loading, unloading,
and low-power operation. This heating was ac-
complished by means of electrical heaters attached
to all components of the fuel and sodium systems;
i.e., pressure shell, heat exchanger, pumps, and
tanks, as well as all fuel and sodium piping.

In addition to the heaters and insulation, all
fuel and sodium piping was surrounded by a 1- to
1)-in. annulus (inside the heaters) through which
helium was circulated. The helium circulated
through the annuli was monitored at various
stations around the system for evidence of leaks
and was, in addition, a safety factor in that it
could be expected to keep hot any spots at which
heater failures occurred.

SODIUM SYSTEM

The sodium circuit external to the reactor,
shown in Fig. 2.6, was similar to that of the fuel.
The sodium flowed from pump to reactor, to heat

exchanger, to pump. The sodium pumps were
' gas-sealed centrifugal pumps of the same design
as the fuel pump, except that a smaller expansion
volume was provided. Again, there were two sodium
pumps, one of which was a spare in parallel with
the operating pump.

The sodium was circulated through the two
parallel sodium-to-helium heat exchangers after
being heated in the reactor. Again the heat was
transferred via the helium to water in two helium-
to-water heat exchangers. The sodium system was
equipped with heaters, as was the fuel system,
and all piping was surrounded with the helium
annulus for leak monitoring and heat distribution.

PROCESS INSTRUMENTATION

Since a basic purpose of the ARE was the
acquisition of experimental data, the importance
of complete and reliable instrumentation could
not be overemphasized. Therefore there were
27 strip temperature recorders (mostly multipoint),
5 circular temperature recorders, 7 indicating flow
controllers, 9 temperature indicators (with up to
96 points per instrument), about 50 spark-plug
level indicators, 20 ammeters, 40 pressure gages,

16 pressure regulators, and 20 pressure transmitters.

In addition there were numerous flow recorders,
indicators, alarms, voltmeters, tachometers, and
assorted miscellaneous instruments.

Most ARE process instrumentation was installed
to permit observing and recording rotational speeds,
flow rates, temperatures, pressures, or liquid
levels. The operating values of temperature, pres-
sure, and flow at various stations around the ARE
fluid circuits are given in Appendix B. Since most
commercially available instruments for measuring
flow and pressure are subject to temperature
limitations considerably lower than the minimum
operating temperature of the ARE and they employ
open lines in which the ZrF, vapor could con-
dense, they were not suitable for ARE applications.
Therefore a bellows type of device was adapted
for use as a pressure indicator, and a fluid-
immersed inductance type of instrument was
developed for measuring sodium and fuel liquid
2 Sodium flow was measured
by an electromagnetic flowmeter. Conventional
chromel-alumel thermocouples welded to the pipe
walls were used to determine temperatures. The

level and fuel flow.

instrumentation flow sheet is shown in Fig. 2.7.
Most of the indicating and recording instruments
were located in the control room. While numerous
important temperatures were recorded in the control
room, about 75% of the thermocouples were indi-
cated (or recorded) only in the basement.

NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROLS

Detailed information on the important nuclear
instrumentation and controls is presented in Ap-
pendix C. Briefly, the nuclear instrumentation
(such as fission chambers and ion chambers), the
electronic components (such as preamplifiers and
power amplifiers), and the control features of the
ARE were similar, and in many cases identical,
to those of the MTR, the LITR, and other reactors
now in operation. However, since the fission
chambers were located in a high-temperature
region within the reflector, it was necessary to
develop special high-temperature chambers.
Helium was used to cool them to below 600°F.

The locations of the two fission chambers in the
reactor may be seen from examination of Fig. 2.3;
the locations of the remaining ion chambers are
shown on Fig. 2.8. Since the fission chambers
moved through sleeves in the reactor which were
parallel to those for the regulating and shim rods,
it was convenient to group the drive mechanisms
with those for the rods in an igloo outside the
shielding above the reactor, as shown in Fig. 2.8.
All other ion chambers were external to the reactor
pressure shell; they viewed the reactor at mid-
plane; and they were mounted so that they would
move horizontally. These chambers included a
BF, counter (for the critical experiment), two
parallel circular plate (PCP) chambers, and two
compensated chambers.

There were two separate elements to the control
system — the single regulating rod and the three
shim rods. The locations of these rods in the
reactor may be seen from examination of Fig. 2.3.
The regulating rod had a vertical movement of
12 in. about the center of the reactor and was
fabricated of stainless steel. Several such regu-
lating rods, with varying amounts of metal, were
fabricated, and the one finally used in the experi-
ment had a total value of 0.4% Ak/k for the 12-in.
movement and could be moved at a rate of 0.011%

(Ak/R)/ sec.

The three safety rods were located in the core
on 120-deg points at a radius of 7.5 in. from the

center of the reactor. Each rod was made up of
slugs of a hot-pressed mixture of boron carbide
and iron; the slugs were canned in stainless steel.
The canned sections were slipped over a flexible
tube. The total rod travel was 36 in., and 13 min
was required for withdrawal of the rod. Thus, the
5.8% Ak/k in each rod (total for the three was
approximately 17% Ak/k) could be withdrawn at
a rate of 0.45% (Ak/k)/min per rod.

A small amount of the helium used to cool the
fission chambers was directed through the shim
and regulating rod holes, but the helium flow was
so low that not much cooling was effected. This
helium was circulated in an independent circuit,
known as the rod cooling system, which had two
two-speed helium blowers in parallel and three
helium-to-water heat exchangers. The helium
circulated from the blowers through the rod sleeves
and fission chamber sleeves to the heat ex-
changers and back to the blowers, and it removed,
in the process, up to 35 kw of reactor heat. Part
of the helium returning from the reactor was
diverted through pipe annuli before reaching the
heat exchanger.

OFF-GAS SYSTEM

The off-gas system was designed to permit the
collection, holdup, and controlled dischgrge of
the radioactive fission products that were evolved
as a consequence of reactor operation. Although
only the gases above the fuel system were ex-
pected to have significant activity, the gas from
the sodium system was also discharged through
the off-gas system. As shown in Fig. 2.9, there
was, in addition to the primary off-gas system, an
auxiliary system for discharging gases from the
pit through nitrogen-cooled charcoal tanks.

In the primary system the off gases from both
the fuel and the sodium were directed to a common
vent header. From this header, helium plus the
volatile fission gases passed through a NaK
scrubber, which removed bromine and iodine, and
then into two holdup tanks, which were connected
in series, to permit the decay of xenon and krypton.
From these the gases were released up the stack.
The release of gases to the stack was dependent

14

upon two conditions: (1) a wind velocity greater
than 5 mph and (2) radioactivity of less than
0.8 pc/cm’. The activity was sensed by a monitor
which was located between the two holdup tanks.

FUEL ENRICHMENT SYSTEM

The fluoride fuel used in the ARE was amenable

"to a convenient enrichment technique in which the

fuel system was first filled with a mixture of the
fluorides of sodium and zirconium. When this
mixture, NaZrF,, had been circulated for a suf-
ficient time to ascertain that the reactor was ready
to be taken critical (no leaks, etc.), uranium in
the form of molten Na,UF, was added to the
fluorides then in the system. The temperature
contour diagram of the NaF-ZtF ,-UF, system is
shown in Fig. 2.10. The melting point of Na UF
was 1200°F, and there were no mixtures of higher
melting points on the join between Na,UF, and
NaZrF ., which is shown in Fig. 2.11. The addition
of Na,UF raised the melting point of the mixture
only slightly above that of NaZrF ; (955°F).

It was initially intended that the enrichment
operation would consist of the remote addition of
Na,UF, to the system from a large tank which
contained all the concentrate. From the large
tank, the concentrate was to pass through an
intermediate transfer tank which would transfer
about 1 gt or less at a time. The intermediate
tank was suspended from a load beam so that the
weight of the concentrate could be determined
before each addition of enriched material. However,
this system was discarded when preoperational
tests proved the temperature control of the system
to be inadequate; in addition, the accuracy of the
weight-measuring instrumentation on the transfer
tank was uncertain.

In lieu of the original enrichment system, a less
elaborate, more direct method of concentrate ad-
dition was employed. The enrichment procedure
actually used involved the successive connection
of numerous small concentrate containers to an
intermediate transfer pot, which, in turn, was
connected to the fuel system by a line which
injected the concentrate into the pump tank above
the liquid level.

3. PRENUCLEAR OPERATION

It is not the purpose here to describe in detail
the preliminary checks and shakedown tests which
preceded the nuclear operation of the system be-
cause this information is covered in the design
and installation report. However, some under-
standing of the scope and significance of these
‘preliminary’ tests is desirable, particularly since
at the conclusion of this phase of the operation
the fuel and sodium systems were left filled with
clean carrier and sodium, respectively, and the
fuel system was ready for the fuel enrichment
operation which comprised the critical experiment.

The preliminary tests accomplished many pur-
poses, the more important being the cleaning and
leak-checking of the systems, performance and
functional testing of components, checking and
calibrating of instruments, and the practicing of
operational techniques. The system, as an integral
unit, was sufficiently assembled by August 1 for
the operating crews to be placed on a three-shift
basis so that intensive tests on the various sys-
tems, initially with water as the circulating fluid,
could be started. There were, however, frequent
delays while changes and modifications that the
testing indicated as being desirable or necessary
were made. The operation with sodium, in par-
ticular, was responsible for major changes in the
sodium vent system and the elimination of the
sodium purification system. Tests with sodium
and carrier in the systems were concluded on
October 30, at which time the system was ready
for the critical experiment.

CIRCULATION OF SODIUM

By the last week in September, all temperature
tests preliminary to operation of the sodium system
had been completed. It was necessary to operate
the sodium system before operating the fuel system
because the sodium was used to heat the reactor
to above the fuel melting point. In preparation for
filling the sodium system, the temperature of the
entire system was brought to 600°F and sodium
was transferred from portable drums into the
system fill tanks. The sodium used had been
carefully filtered to minimize the oxygen content,
which at the time of the filling averaged about

0.025 wt %.

Design and Installation of the Aircraft Reactor Ex-
periment, ORNL-1844 (to be issued).

The system was filled with sodium on the morning
of September 26. No particular difficulties were
encountered during the filling or when the sodium
pumps were operated at design speed, although
there was evidence of trapped gas in the system.
The electromagnetic flowmeters, which were at
first inoperative, functioned properly after suf-
ficient time had elapsed for wetting of the pipe
wall to occur. On the following afternoon a leak
developed in a tube bend in the sodium purification
system, so the sodium was dumped.

Subsequent analyses revealed that the leak
occurred where a thermocouple pad had been
heliarc welded to the tube. The excessive weld
penetration which caused the leak was attributed
to a lack of instruction to the welder that a vari-
ation in pipe wall thickness existed in this section.

As a consequence of this leak and difficulties
experienced during draining of the sodium, a
number of changes were made in the sodium sys-
tem. The purification systems were eliminated
and provisions were made for better heat control
for all vent lines and valves to prevent freezing
of the sodium and plugging of the lines. I[t was
concluded that the sodium purification system
could be removed without endangering the experi-
ment because experience in operating the system
had proved that the oxygen contamination was very
low; furthermore, there was no danger of the oxide
plugging the heat exchanger tubes because of the
low temperature differential in the system and the
large diameters of the tubes in the heat exchangers.
It was felt, also, that the purification system
represented the weakest link in the fluid circuit
because thinner walled tubing had been used there
than anywhere else in the system, except for the
reactor tubes, which were assembled with extreme
care, Even so, the thin-walled tubing in the puri-
fication system would probably not have presented
a problem had the thermocouples been properly

welded.
On October 16 the sodium was recharged into

the system at 600°F, circulated, and dumped four
times to thoroughly check the operability of the
sodium system. Analyses of the sodium taken
both at 600 and 925°F showed the oxygen content
to be satisfactorily low (of the order of 0.026 wt %),
and therefore the initial batch of sodium was not
replaced. The sodium was circulated for several

days at 1300°F before fuel carrier, NaZrF, was

added to the fuel tank. During the period of sodium
circulation, the typical system characteristics
were those given in Figs. 3.1 and 3.2. The data
were comparable to those obtained during the water
tests.] Such discrepancies as existed were within
experimental error and could easily have been due
to changes in the system that were made during
the time between the two tests, such as the re-
moval of the purification systems and the removal
of the bypass around the reactor during the water
tests,

During and after the second sodium loading
operation the copper gauze in the helium stream
was monitored and no evidence of sodium leakage
was found. With helium in the fuel system the
temperatures in the fuel and sodium systems were

then gradually raised (about 10°F/hr) to 1300°F.
After the 1300°F temperature was reached, the
helium pressure in the fuel system was reduced
to 0.5 psig and sufficient krypton was added to
bring the system pressure up to 5.0 psig. The
helium in the annuli was then sampled and analyzed
for krypton, and no evidence of a leak was found.

CIRCULATION OF FUEL CARRIER

With the system isothermal at 1300°F, the fuel
carrier, NaZrF,, was loaded into the fill tank at
1200°F, and the fuel system was evacuated to
facilitate raising the fluoride into the system.
This filling operation, which occurred on October
25, required only a few minutes once the desired
vacuum was attained. During the filling operation
it was possible to follow the progress of the
fluoride through the system by watching the thermo-
couple indications along the pipe because of the
100°F temperature difference between the initial
fluoride temperature and the system temperature.
In contrast to the sodium system, there did not
appear to be any gas trapped in the fuel system
after loading; evidence of this was that there was
no liquid level change when the pressure in the
pump was changed, and the temperature differentials
across the six parallel fuel passages in the reactor
changed simultaneously when a temperature pertur-
bation was put into the system.

Five samples of the carrier were taken, and the
analytical results from each showed the concen-
trations of impurities and corrosion products given
in Table 3.1.

There was twice as much carrier available as
was required to fill the system, and if chemical
analyses of samples of the carrier after it had
been circulated for about 50 hr had indicated too
high a corrosion-product buildup {as could have
resulted if the system had not been adequately
cleaned), the carrier in the system would have
been dumped and replaced with the extra carrier.
However, from the very favorable analyses of the
first two samples it was apparent that replacing
the carrier would not be necessary. (The chromium
content would have had to have been 500 ppm to
have necessitated the replacement. The corrosion
mechanism that defines the upper limit of the
chromium content is described in detail in ORNL-
1844.)

During the time the carrier was being circulated
and before the enrichment operation commenced,

the system characteristics were determined. The,

data obtained in terms of pump speed vs flow and
system head vs flow are given in Figs. 3.3 and
3.4, respectively. These data were considerably
different from those to be expected from an ex-
trapolation of the water data. The discrepancies
are analyzed in more detail in ORNL-1844," but
the only completely satisfactory explanation is
that the system head during the water test was too
high, possibly due to the temporary water Rotameter
installation or to one or more of the reactor tubes
not being completely filled so that only partial
flow was obtained through the reactor during the
water test, ‘

checked out. A BF, counter was installed in one
of the instrument holes external to the reactor in
order to check the fission chambers during the
critical experiment. Pulse height and voltage
curves were measured on all three fission chambers
(the two regulars plus a spare) in order to establish
the operational plateau for each chamber.

The mechanical operation tests of the regulating
rod and of the three safety (shim) rods were made;
in all, over 25 rod drop tests were performed in
order to ensure the reliability of the rod insertions
at high (1200 to 1300°F) temperatures. The rod
drives were also continuously cycled in order to
check the performance of the gear trains and

motors. During this time the rod magnet faces
were cleaned, and, in order to maintain more uni-
form drop currents, it was decided to keep the
magnet faces engaged at all times when the rods
were not in use.

Before the fuel concentrate (Na, UF) was charged
to the enrichment system, a number of practice
operations were performed with carrier in the en-
richment system. The temperature control of the
system was inadequate and the operation of the
weigh cell on the transfer tank was such that
reproducible weights could not be obtained. Al-
though the enrichment system probably could have
been made to work, considerable time would have
been required. Accordingly, the original enrich-
ment system was abandoned, and a manually oper-

ated system was improvised.

22

The concentrate in each of these containers was
then added to the fuel system at the pump after
first passing through an intermediate transfer pot.
The amount of concentrate added was determined
by weight measurements of the concentrate con-
tainers before and after use. While this system
was being set up, the operating crews were engaged
in leak testing the various auxiliary systems,
determining operability of heater circuits, checking
and reading thermocouples, establishing the per-
formance of the pump lubrication and cooling sys-
tems, checking the operation of the annulus system
helium blowers, monitoring the annulus helium for
leaks, and checking the operability of the various
off-gas systems, instrumentation, and the like.
By the morning of October 30, these tests were
sufficiently well in hand for the critical experi-
ment to commence.

4. CRITICAL EXPERIMENT

On October 30 the sodium had been circulating
275 hr, and the fuel carrier about 110 hr. Both
the sodium system and the fuel system were at an
isothermal temperature of 1300°F, and the fuel
system was ready for the addition of concentrate
(Na, UF) to the carrier (NaZrF ). The addition of
the concentrate was necessarily time-consuming
because of the cautious manner in which each
addition had to be made during the approach to
criticality; however, this operation would have
been completed more rapidly had it not been for
unforeseen difficulties. The reactor did not reach
criticality until 3:45 PM, November 3, some four
days after the enrichment operation was started.
Unfortunately, much of the four days was spent in
removing plugs and in repairing leaks which oc-
curred in the enrichment line. Since these leaks
were largely the result of the improvised nature
of the enrichment mechanism, they were not of
serious consequence.

The chronology of the critical experiment is
shown in Fig. 4.1, and a detailed description of
the experiment, including a subcritical temperature
coefficient measurement, is presented below. The
critical experiment, as well as all nuclear oper-
ations, followed, in general, the pattern prescribed
in the ‘ARE Operating Procedures, Part il, Nuclear
Operation,” which is included in this report as

Appendix D.

ENRICHMENT PROCEDURE

By the afternoon of October 30 the chemists had
installed and checked out the injection apparatus,
and the systems were ready for the enrichment
operation to commence. The loading station was
located directly above the main fuel pump. The
injection rig consisted of an oven into which the
batch cans fitted, an intermediate, heated transfer
pot capable of holding about 5.5 |b of concentrate,
a resistance-heated transfer line connecting the
batch can with the transfer pot, and the electrically
heated injection line running from the transfer pot
into the pump, as well as various auxiliary equip-
ment, such as helium supply and vent lines,
vacuum pump, pressure control, and electrical
heating equipment. The resistance-heated transfer
line was left exposed to the air so that blow

torches could be applied in case of a plug. A flow
sketch of the injection system is shown in Fig.
4.2.

The fuel concentrate was batched into small
cans prior to loading. The three batch sizes are
given in the following tabulation:

Approximate

Can Size Concentrate Weight
(ib)
A 30

0.5

The A and B size cans were used during the criti-
cal experiment. The C size cans were held for
use in calibrating the regulating rod. Table 4.1
lists the batch cans by numbers in the order in
which the cans were used in the critical experi-
ment, the net amount of concentrate and uranium
added, and the UZ33 content.

Prior to an injection a batch can was selected,
set in the oven, and heated to 1400°F. Meanwhile
the transfer lines were being heated. When proper
temperatures were reached, an injection was
attempted. The intermediate transfer pot was
filled from the batch can by pressurizing the batch
can and venting the transfer pot. At the same time
the pump pressure was maintained above that of
the transfer pot so that there could not be an inad-
vertent transfer into the pump. When the spark
plug probes indicated that the transfer pot was
full, the pressure in the batch can was released,
and the material in the transfer pot was forced into
the pump by helium pressure. This method of
transfer was used so that only a measured amount
of concentrate (not more than 5.5 |b) could be
added at a given time and the system pressures
could be kept low. With low system pressures
there was less need for venting and possibly
clogging the vent lines. Figure 4.3 shows a photo
of the chemists preparing for an injection during
the critical experiment.

EARLY STAGES OF THE EXPERIMENT

At 1500 on October 30 the critical experiment
was started. The main fuel pump was first trimmed
to its minimum prime level and the shaft speed
was reduced to 500 rpm (20-gpm flow). At this

time the volume of carrier in the fuel system was
calculated to be 4.82 f13, and the weight was
927 ib. At 1507, concentrate transfer was started
from batch can A-6 to the intermediate tank, and,
at 1539, transfer of the first 5.5 Ib of fuel to the
system was accomplished. At 1554, the second
5.5 |b of fuel had been added. These fuel injections
very noticeably affected the fission chamber re-
corders. Mixing of the concentrate with the carrier
did not occur rapidly, and therefore each time the
enriched slug entered the reactor it produced a
multiplication that was observable on the fission
chamber count-rate recorder. Figure 4.4 is a photo-
graph of the trace of fission chamber No. 1; the
pips that occurred during addition of the first and
second slugs of fuel are readily observable. From
the time interval between pips, which was almost

a check on the rate of fuel flow was obtained:

f (gpm) = 2 (min)

= 18.03 .

This checked fairly well with the value of about
20 gpm read from the fuel flow recorder.

The remaining four injections from can A-6 were
accomplished smoothly. The pumps were speeded
up to an observed fuel flow rate of 46 gpm to
obtain better mixing of the fuel. At 1720, fuel
sample 6 was removed for analysis.?

At 1920 the first 5.5-lb injection from can A-7
was started, but the transfer line from the inter-
mediate pot to the pump clogged due to concentrate
freezing in it. After several hours of unsuccessful
attempts to free the line, a gas leak occurred in
the transter line at the intermediate tank pot, and

it was then decided to install a new transfer line
and transfer pot. At this time it was reported that
no ‘transfer of concentrate had been made to the
pump from can A-7. The first 5.5 Ib of can A-7
was lost to the experiment through the leaks and
in the plugged line.

At 2000 on November 1, the new transfer line and
tank were installed and checked out ready for use.
At 2006, fuel sample 7 was drawn for analysis,
and, at 2300, the critical experiment was resumed.
When the first 5.5-1b slug was injected, periodic
pips were again observed on the fission chamber
recorder. These pips had a period of 47 sec which,
together with a pump speed of 1080 rpm, yielded
a calculated fuel flow of 46 gpm, which corre-
sponded to the flow observed on the fuel flowmeter.

At 2315, while attempting the next 5.5-1b transfer,
the line again froze. The line was disconnected
and found to be plugged at the injection fitting
through the pump flange. It was therefore decided
to increase the current to the resistance-heated
fitting and to add a separate vent line from the
pump so that the chemists could continue to ‘*blow
through’’ the transfer line and out the new vent
line without raising the system pressure.

By 1320 on November 1 the new vent line had
been installed and the transfer system was again
in operating condition. The transfer of the re-
maining 20 |b of concentrate in four batches from
can A-7 took place with no difficulty, and the
transfer was completed by 1415. At 1617, fuel
sample 8 was taken for analysis, and, at 1707,
the first batch from can A-8 was transferred into
the system. The remaining 5 batches were trans-
ferred smoothly, and the transfer from can A-8 was
completed by 1804. At 2028, fuel sample 9 was
removed for analysis. The next three additions of
fuel from cans A-9, A-10, and A-12 were accom-
plished with little difficulty.

At 0830 on November 2, while transferring the
first 5-lb batch from can A-5, a ledk occurred in
the injection line just below the floor level of the
loading station (see Fig. 4.3). Examination of the
injection line showed the leak to have occurred at
a Swagelok fitting. Approximately 0.2 Ib of concen-
trate was lost from the experiment as a result of
the leak. Since the line had clogged, it was neces-
sary to install a new section of line. During the
time the repairs were being made to the injection
system, the original schedule was changed, and a
subcritical measurement of the temperature coef-
ficient of reactivity was made. In addition, samples
10 and 11 were taken for analysis.

SUBCRITICAL MEASUREMENT OF THE
REACTOR TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT

Approximately 100 Ib of U23% (180 Ib of Na, UF)
had been added at the time the leak occurred on
November 2, at 0831, and it was estimated that
this was about 80% of the total fuel needed. Al-
though it had been planned to make a preliminary
measurement of the temperature coefficient of
reactivity with about 90% of the fuel added (see
“Nuclear Operating Procedures,”’ Appendix D),
the plans were revised and the measurement was
made at this time.

At the start of the experiment the reactor mean
temperature was 1306°F. The fuel heat exchanger
barrier doors were raised (at 1003); two minutes
later the fuel helium blower was started and its
speed increased to 275 rpm. The resultant cooling,
with time, as fraced by the reactor fuel mean
temperature recorder, is shown in Fig. 4.5, with
the counting rate from fission chamber No. 2 super-
imposed. The data for both fission chambers are
given in Table 4.2. The counting rate of the
fission chambers monitors the neutron flux.

The counting rate was observed to rise with
decreasing temperature and thus indicated a nega-
tive temperature coefficient of reactivity. Counts
were taken for 40 sec during every minute. At
1010, when the reactor temperature reached 1250°F,
the helium blower was stopped, and soon thereafter
the reactor temperature began to rise again, with
a corresponding decrease in counting rate.

The reactor temperature coefficient, as estimated
from the data presented in Fig. 4.5, was of the
order of 5 x 10~5 (Ak/R)/°F. The data were
adequate to show that the reactor would be easy
to control; therefore the experiment was aliowed
to proceed. It will subsequently be observed that
the temperature data recorded in the data room did
not exhibit the full temperature drop across the

reactor in any run where heat was being abstracted

from the system. Consequently where the ab-
stracted heat is one of the parameters of the
experiment, as in the above temperature coefficient
measurement, it would be expected that some
temperature correction would be in order. The
existing data for the case in question are, how-
ever, too meager to justify correction, although
based on correlations (app. K) with data taken
during the low- and the high-power runs, the con-
trol room temperature indications were lower than
the actual temperature, and therefore the estimated
temperature coefficient given above is too high.

It may also be noted from examination of Fig.
4.5 that the maximum counting rate and the temper-

ature minimum did not occur simultaneously. A-

fag of about 2.5 min in the response of the reactor
temperature was observed. The reason for this
time lag is not well understood, but it may have
some connection with the fact that the thermo-
couples were outside the reactor and hence did
not ‘‘see’’ the changes immediately. Details of
this and later measurements of the fuel and reactor
temperature coefficients are given in Appendix O.

APPROACH TO CRITICALITY

At 0130 on November 3, the injection system was

again in operation, and the fuel additions during.

the remainder of the critical experiment occurred
without mishap. The remaining portions of can
A-7 and all of cans B-22, B-31, and B-20 were
added during this time.

Throughout the course of the experiment, the
progress toward criticality was observed on the
neutron detectors. With every fuel injection the
counting rates of the two fission chambers and the
BF; counter were simultaneously clocked and
recorded. The approach to criticality could readily
be seen by plotting the reactivity, k£, against the
concentration of the fuel in the system. The re-
activity was obtained from the relationship

Eel -—

where M is the subcritical multiplication, which
is determined from the expression
N

M=—,
No
where N is the counting rate after a fuel injection
and Ny is the initial counting rate. As criticality
is approached, 1/M approaches zero, and therefore
at criticality, & = 1.

Figure 4.6 shows a plot of £ vs
tration, where £ is determined from three neutron
detectors, i.e., two fission chambers and a BF,
counter. The reactivity, as observed on the two
fission chambers, showed a rapid increase during
the early stages of the experiment and then leveled
off as the critical condition was near. The BF,
counter, on the other hand, showed a more uniform
approach to criticality. The differences in the
responses of the two types of detectors are dis-
cussed in Appendix E. Table 4.3 presents the
data from which Fig. 4.6 was drawn.

the critical experiment is given in Table 4.4. The

At 1545 on November 3 upon the addition of the
second batch of fuel from can B-20, a sustaining
chain reaction was attained — the reactor was
critical. Figure 4.7 shows a photo of the control
room just as the critical condition was reached.

At 1547 the reactor was given over to the servo
mechanism at an estimated power of 1 watt, and
during the next % hr a brief radiation survey of
the reactor and heat exchanger pits was made (cf.,
chap. 5, “Low-Power Experiments’). At 1604 the
reactor was shut down, and thus the initial phase
of the ARE operation program was completed.

The uranium inventory (Table 4.4) showed that
the critical concentration of U?3% was 23.94 Ib/ft%,
which corresponded to a total weight of 133.8 Ib
of U235 in the fuel system. At this time the total
weight of the fuel was 1156 Ib, and its volume was
5.587 #3. The per cent by weight of U%35 was

The calculated, cold, clean critical mass of the
reactor, as obtained from the subsequent rod cali-
brations, was 32.75 ib (cf., app. F).

The reactor was not instrumented to permit the
measurement of the flux or power distributions
through the reactor, but measurements of these
distributions were made on a critical mockup of
the reactor at the ORNL Critical Experiment Fa-
cility about two years before the operation of the
ARE.? These measurements represent the best

general interest therein, typical axial and radial
flux and power distribution curves are given in
Appendix G.

ANALYSES OF FUEL SAMPLES

In addition to the fuel samples taken, as noted,
during the critical experiment, four more samples
were removed on November 4 after initial criticality
was reached. A list of all samples taken and the
results of the chemical analyses are presented in
Table 4.5. Besides showing the analyses of the
percentages of U and U?3% by weight in the fuel
system and a comparison with the U235 (wt %)
content obtained from the criticality data, the
table also lists the results of the analyses for the
impurities and corrosion products Fe, Cr, and Ni
to provide information on the purity of the fuel and
the corrosion rate of the fuel system.

The first five samples were removed from the
system prior to enrichment, and samples 16 through
19 were taken after the critical experiment and
during the low power runs at the time of the cali-
bration of the regulating rods against fuel addition.

For the most part, the U235 content as given by
chemical analysis agreed to within a few per cent
with that obtained from the running inventory.
When the sample for analysis was withdrawn from
the system too soon after a fuel addition, there
was a tendency for the analysis to be low, un-
doubtedly, because of inadequate mixing of the
additive with the bulk of the fuel. The chemical
analysis of sample 1, however, was obviously in
error, whereas that of sample 9 gave a uranium
content that was about 7% higher than the inventory
showed. The other sample analysis figures were
within about 2% of the percentages given by the
inventory. The analyses of samples 12, 13, and
14, which were taken after the critical experiment,
agreed to within about 1% with the inventory calcu-
lation.

The increase in the buildup of chromium in the
fuel system with time is shown in Fig. 4.8 to give
an indication of the corrosion rate of the system.
The initial corrosion rate was quite small, but
after enriched fuel had been added to the system,
the analyses showed a chromium content increase

of about 50 ppm/day.

CALIBRATION OF THE SHIM RODS

As outlined in the ‘Nuclear Operating Pro-
cedures,”” Appendix D, during the first fuel ad-
ditions the shim rods were withdrawn all the way

out of the reactor to obtain the multiplication.

After about 100 ib of U23® had been added to the
system, the procedure was altered in order to
obtain a shim rod calibration. After each fuel
addition, all three rods were simultaneously with-
drawn to positions of 20, 25, 30, and 35 in. out;
total movement was 36 in. The counting rate of
each of the neutron detectors was recorded for
each rod position. Figure 4.9 shows the reciprocal
multiplication and the reactivity as a function of
U?35 content of the fuel system for the various
rod positions. The data used for plotting Fig. 4.9
were obtained from the BF, counter and are pre-
sented in Table 4.6. A cross-plot of reactivity vs
shim rod position determined the rod calibration
details, which are given in Appendix J. The rods

were found to be nonlinear, with (Ak/k)/in. and
total Ak/k varying in the manner shown in Appen-
dix D. From the calibration it was found that each
rod was worth a total of about 5.8% Ak/k.

As a check on the general shape of the reactivity
curves of the shim rods, a series of counts were
taken on the BF, counter and the fission chambers
for various rod positions for two different uranium
concentrations. These data are also discussed in
Appendix J.

MEASUREMENT OF THE
REACTIVITY-MASS RATIO

Prior to the ARE operation it had been estimated
that when the critical mass (assumed to be 30 Ib)
was reached, the value of the ratio (Ak/k)/(AM/M)
should be 0.232. This value was obtained from a
calculation of the ratio for various amounts of
U%33, as shown in Fig. D.1 of Appendix D. From
the data token during the critical experiment, it
was possible to establish an experimental curve
for the ratio and to verify the value given above
for the ratio at the critical mass.

In order to find (Ak/k)/(AM/M) experimentally,
use was made of the curve of Fig. 4.9 which gives
k in terms of the U3 content of the fuel in the
system for various shim rod positions; i.e., for any

point,
Ak/k () <
AMM \AM/\&/

(AR/AM) is the slope of the & vs M curves shown
in Fig. 4.9. For various small sections of the
curves the slopes approximated straight lines.
From the average values of M and & over these
increments of the curves and the measured siopes,
the ratio R was determined for each increment.

5. LOW-POWER EXPERIMENTS

The reactor was operated, after initial criticality
was attained, for about 20 min at a nominal power
of 1 w and then shut down. The next morning a
series of low-power experiments was started. This
series of experiments lasted from the morning of
November 4 until the morning of November 8. The
chronology of this low-power operation is given in
Fig. 5.1.

Two of the early experiments, L-1 and L-4, were
devoted to a determination of the reactor power
from measurements of the fuel activation. These
runs were each of 1 hr duration with the reactor at
a nominal power of 1 and 10 w, respectively. After
each of these runs, fuel samples were taken and the
activity counts were made from which the reactor
power was determined. The method was inaccurate,
as subsequently evidenced by power calibrations
from the extracted power, but did indicate that the
nominal power estimates were low.

Radiation surveys of the entire experimental
system were made during both the nominal 1- and
10-w runs except that a survey of the reactor pit
was not attainable during the 10-w run because
the pit was sealed at that time. Most of the equip-
ment and many of the instruments were, however,
located in the heat exchanger pits to which access
was maintained throughout the low-power operation.

Most of the time of the low-power operation was
devoted to calibration of the regulating and shim
rods. The two essentially independent methods
used to calibrate the regulating rods were cali-
bration against fuel addition and calibration against
reactor periods by using the inhour equation (app. 1).
The shim rods were then calibrated against the
regulating rod.

Also as an integral part of the low-power opera-
tion the earlier measurement of the temperature
coefficient was checked, and the fuel system per-
formance characteristics were determined. Finally,
in preparation for the high-power experiments, the
ion chambers, which had been positioned close to
the reactor during the critical and low-power ex-
periments for greater sensitivity, were withdrawn
so that they would register sensibly at the higher
powers,

POWER DETERMINATION FROM
FUEL ACTIVATION

Reactor power measurements are usually made
by exposing gold or indium foils to the neutron

40

flux in a reactor soon after initial criticality is
attained. In the ARE it was simpler to draw off a
sample of the uranium-bearing fuel after operation
and measure its activity with an ion chamber, Com-
parison with a similar sample of known activity
gave a determination of the flux level and, hence,
the power level. The procedure is described in
Appendix H.

In run L-1, the reactor was operated for 1 hr at
an estimated power level of 1 w, and a sample was
drawn off for measurement of the activity. The
specific activity was too low for a reliable de-
termination and, accordingly, the experiment was
repeated in run L-4 at a nominal 10-w power level.

It was subsequently found from the heat balance
at high power that the actual power was 27 w during

run L-4, However, the fuel sample activity was’

only on the order of one-half to two-thirds the
activity to be expected from operation at 27 w.
Apparently a considerable amount of the gaseous
fission products was being given off from the fuel.
A comparison of the data obtained from fuel acti-
vation with those obtained from heat balances is
given in Appendix N.

RADIATION SURVEYS

The primary purpose of experiments L-1 and L-4
was to calibrate the estimated reactor power against
the power determined from the radioactivity of fuel
samples, but, at the same time, radiation dose
levels were measured at various locations around
the reactor and the tank and heat exchanger pits.
These data will subsequently be of interest in
evaluating the radiation damage to various com-
ponents of the system.

Most of the radiation measurements were made
with a ‘‘Cutie-Pie’’ (a gamma-sensitive ionization
chamber), but a GM survey meter, a methane pro-
portional counter, an electroscope, and a boron-
coated electroscope were used for some measure-
ments, in particular, those made close to the
reactor. While the GM survey meter only provided
a check on the gamma dose as measured by the
‘‘Cutie-Pie,’’ the other instruments provided meas-
urements of the fast- and thermal-neutron doses.
The proportional counter measured the fast-neutron
dose, and the thermal-neutron flux was calculated
from the difference of the two electroscope readings.

The radiation dose data from the two runs during
which the dose in the pits was measured are pre-
sented in Tables 5.1 and 5.2. Table 5.1 gives the
gamma and the fast- and thermal-neutron doses in
the reactor pit during the 2.7-w run; Table 5.2 gives
the gamma doses at various stations in the heat
exchanger pit during both the 2.7- and 27-w runs.
Within the accuracy of the measurements, there is
excellent agreement between the doses per watt
from the two runs.

REGULATING ROD CALIBRATION FROM
FUEL ADDITIONS

Twelve small cans, or ‘‘penguins® (so-called
because of their shape), had been prepared for
adding small amounts of fuel to the system in order
to calibrate the regulating rod (exp. L-2) after
initial criticality had been reached. Each penguin
contained from 0.2 to 0.5 Ib of fuel concentrate
(0.1 to 0.3 Ib of U23%), The contents of the pen-
guins were injected directly into the pump rather
than through the intermediate transfer pot that was
used in the critical experiments, Table 5.3 lists
the penguins in the chronological order in which
they were used, together with the amount of uranium
injected from each can,

The method used to calibrate the regulating rod
was to note the difference between the position of
the rod at criticality before and after each injection
of fuel, with the shim rods held constant. Before
each injection the reactor was brought from sub-
critical to a nominal power of 1 'w, and the shim
and regulating rod positions were recorded. The
reactor was then brought subcritical on the regu-
lating rod, with the shim rods in position, and the

fuel was injected from the penguin, Upon comple-
tion of the injection the reactor was again brought
critical to l-watt power with the regulating rod.
The positions of the rods were again recorded.
The worth of the rod was then obtained from the
relation

Ak AM
M

and the known increment of fuel added to the sys-
tem; the proportionality factor, 0.236, was obtained
experimentally during the critical experiment

(cf., chap. 4).

The first run of experiment L-2 started at 1651
on November 4. After two injections had been
completed, it was apparent that the worth of the
12 in. of vertical movement of the regulating rod in
terms of Ak/k was about 0.24%, It was desirable,
for reasons of safety and also for convenience in
conducting high-power transient experiments, to
have a rod worth about one dollar of reactivity
(which for the ARE was 0.4% rather than 0.76% as
in stationary-fuel reactors, because of delayed-
neutron loss in the circulating fuel). A number of
spare rods of varying weights had been made up to
take care of such a contingency, and one was
selected and installed which had more nearly the
desired weight. The original rod weighed 19.2 g/cm
of length, and the new rod weighed 36 g/cm.

While the rod was being changed (a delay of
about 5 hr), the fuel system characteristics of
pressure head vs flow were obtained. These
measurements are described in a following section
of this chapter,

*Container No. 120 was not a penguin but a specially prepared batch of concentrate which provided the excess
uranium required for the experiments and to compensate for burnup.

At 0142 on November 5 the installation of the
second rod was completed and the experiment was
resumed. Four more injections of fuel were made
and the rod movement was noted. At 0630, during
the sixth fuel injection, an unexpectedly high
burst of gamma-ray activity (55 mr/hr) was ob-
served on a ‘‘Cutie-Pie’’ monitoring the fuel addi-
tion at the injection station over the pump. Further
fuel addition was stopped until the cause of the
high gamma-ray reading could be ascertained.
While investigation was under way the level of the
pump was trimmed to avoid any possible hazard
from the uranium held in the pump. About 71 .ib of
fuel was removed from the system. Later in the
day the cause of the high gamma-ray activity was
determined to be a vent line passing close to the
position of the ‘‘Cutie-Pie.”” Apparently, the
““Cutie-Pie’’ had been held close enough to the
vent line to read the fission gases {evolved during
operation) as they were discharged through the
vent line.

At 1947 the experiment was resumed and five
more injections were made uneventfully, A photo-
graph of the control room taken during this time is
presented in Fig. 5.2; it shows two members of the
ARE operating group examining the fission chamber
recorders after a fuel injection for rod calibration;
other members of the evening crew are shown in

their nominal operating stations.

An inventory of the uranium added during this
experiment is given in Table 5.4, The final large
amount (47.8 Ib) of concentrate containing 12.30 Ib
U235 that was added after the experiment is also
shown in the table, as well as a record of the
samples and withdrawals. The final amount of
U235 jn the system was 138.55 Ib, with a system
volume of 5.33 f13,

The data obtained for calibration of the regulating
rod as a function of fuel addition are given in
Table 5.5, which lists the values of M, AM, AM/M,
the recorded movement of the rod during each fuel
addition, the average position of the rod for each
fuel addition, and the calculated value of (Ak/k)/in.

The results of the calibration are shown in Fig.
5.3, where (Ak/k)/in. is plotted as a function of
rod position. The movement of the rod for each
point is shown as a horizontal line through the
point. The values of (Ak/k)/in. for both rods were
used, the values of reactivity for rod No. 1 being
corrected by the ratios of the weights of the two
rods. From these data it is evident that there is no
good reason for presuming that the value of
(Ak/k)/in. over the whole length of rod is not
constant. Therefore, the average value taken over
the first ten runs gives

(Ak/E)/in. = 0.033%/in.

experimental points show the extent of the rod
movement for that point, Again, there is no con-
clusive evidence that the reactivity of the rod per
unit length was not constant. Therefore, the
average of the 48-gpm flow data weighted over the
rod movement for each run gives

(Ak/R)/in. = 0.029%/in.

For the two zero-flow points the rod was moved
over the middle 10 in. of its 12-in. travel in two
6-in. overlapping runs covering the upper and lower
halves of the rod, respectively. The weighted
average of these points gave a value of

(Ak/R)/in. = 0.033%/in. ,

which is in excellent agreement with the fuel
addition calibration. This value was settled upon
as the best value of reactivity per inch over the
whole length of the regulating rod. The values for
the reactivity vs rod position are given in Table

5.6.

CALIBRATION OF SHIM RODS VS
REGULATING ROD

With the reactivity of the regulating rod known,
the shim rods could be calibrated against it (exp.
L-6). This calibration could then be compared
with the previous calibration made during the fuel
addition. It was assumed that the three shim rods
were enough alike that a calibration of one rod
would be representative, and rod No. 3 was chosen
for the calibration,

The calibration procedure consisted of setting
shim rods Nos. 1 and 2 in a fixed position, and
then, with the reactor at a power level of 1 w on
the servo mechanism, rod No. 3 was moved until a
specified travel of the regulating rod was obtained.
At the start of the experiment the rods were ad-
justed so that shim rod No. 3 was nearly all the
way out (position indicator at 35 in.) and the regu-
lating rod nearly all inserted (position indicator at
3 in). After recording the position of all rods,

REGULATING ROD POSITION (in)

Fig. 5.7. Calibration of Regulating Rod from Reactor Period Measurements,

shim rod No. 3 was inserted until the servo action
had withdrawn the regulating rod a compensating
distance of about 10 in. The action was then
stopped and the new rod positions were recorded.
With shim rod No. 3 set, shim rods Nos. 1 and 2
were then adjusted to bring the regulating rod back
to its original position, and again the rod positions
were recorded. Again rod No. 3 was inserted until
a 10-in. withdrawal of the regulating rod was
attained. This process was repeated until rod
No. 3 had been inserted about 14 in., and each
new position had been recorded. This calibration
agreed well with the calibration against fuel addi-
tion, Details of the results are given in Appendix J.

FUEL SYSTEM CHARACTERISTICS

The fuel system characteristics with the fuel
concenfrate in the system were determined for the

52

first (and only) time the day after the reactor first
became critical (exp. L-3). The final amounts of
concentrate {i.e., the excess to provide for burnup
and poisoning during the subsequent power runs)
had not yet been added to the system. Conse-
quently, the fuel density at the time the data were
taken was 3.32 g/cm? as compared with 3.36 g/cm?
for the final fuel composition, and 3.08 g/cm® for
the carrier; all densities were determined at 1300°F.

The measured and calculated flow data as a
function of pump speed are shown in Fig. 5.8. The
flow was calculated for two pump speeds by using
the time between pips on the fission chamber as
concentrate was first added to the system. The
straight line joining the two calculated points is
considered to be a good approximation because of
the regime in which the pump was operated.

discharge to the reactor inlet at design flow (i.e.,
46 gpm); there is no experimental measurement of
this pressure drop. The pump performance charac-
teristics determined in a test stand run with fuel at

1300°F are given in Fig. 5.10.

EFFECT OF FUEL FLOW ON REACTIVITY

An experiment was performed in which the effect
of fuel flow on reactivity was observed (exp. L-7).
For this experiment the reactor was brought to a
nominal power of 1 watt and given over to the
flux servo mechanism after full fuel flow of 46 gpm
had been established, After recording the positions
of the regulating and shim rods the flow rate was
reduced step-wise until zero-flow was reached.
Each reduction of the flow was accompanied by a
change of position of the regulating rod. Reducing

the flow had the effect of allowing more delayed
neutrons to contribute to the flux level in the
reactor, and therefore the servo mechanism inserted
the regulating rod to compensate for the excess
reactivity created by the delayed neutrons. Each
rate of fuel flow and the corresponding regulating
rod position were recorded. The results of the
experiment are shown in Fig. 5.11, where A%/k is
plotted as a function of flow rate. It is observed
that 12 in. of rod movement, or 0.4% Ak/k, was
needed to compensate for the reactivity introduced
when the flow rate was reduced from full to zero
flow. This curve is comparable to that shown in
Fig. D.2 of Appendix D. The data for this experi-
ment are tabulated in Table 5.7.

Although not a part of experiment L-7, additional
insight into fuel activity may be obtained from
examination of Fig. 5.12, which shows activity as
recorded by fission chamber No. 2. Before the
data shown in the figure were recorded the reactor
had been operating at a power of about 1 w with
the fuel pump stopped. As shown, the reactor was

it was this excess activity which showed up as the
fuel was circulated after the reactor was scrammed.

LOW-POWER MEASUREMENT OF THE
TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT

A measurement of the temperature coefficient of
reactivity (exp, L-8) was made next. With the
reactor isothermal at 1312°F and controlled by
the flux servo mechanism, the heat barrier doors
were raised and the helium blower turned on to
200 rpm to cool the fuel in the heat exchanger.
As the temperature of the reactor decreased, the
servo began to drive the regulating rod in to com-
pensate for the increased reactivity. The recording
of the regulating rod position vs time is shown in
Fig. 5.13. Beginning at 0218, the rod was in-
serted by the servo quite rapidly, and by 0221 the
With the
regulating rod on servo, one of the shim rods was
inserted as rapidly as possible. This shim rod
insertion overcompensated for the increase in
reactivity due to the temperature drop, and the

rod was approaching its lower limit,

servo quickly withdrew the regulating rod. In-
sertion of the shim rod was stopped when the
regulating rod had been withdrawn to near its
upper limit, and the regulating rod was again in-
serted by the servo fo compensate for the reactivity
introduced by the cooling of the fuel. By 0230, the
outlet temperature in the heat exchanger was

approaching its lower limit, 1150°F, so the helium

blower was stopped and the run was ended.

temperature is shown in Fig. 5.14, and super-
imposed on it is a plot of the displacement of the

A measure of the temperature coefficient may be
obtained by comparing the slopes of the two curves.
At 0228 the rod was moving at exactly 1 in./min,
corresponding to an increase in reactivity of
3.3 x 10=4 (Ak/k)/min. At the same time, the
mean temperature was dropping at the rate of
5.1°F/min, The resulting reactor temperature
coefficient, as obtained from these data, would
appear to be —6.48 x 10=5 (Ak/k)/°F. By com-
paring the slopes of the curves obtained earlier
during the run, a considerably higher coefficient

can be obtained that might approximate that for the
fuel. In any case, the recorded mean temperature
is believed to be in error (as explained in Ap-
pendix K) in such a manner that the actual rate of
temperature change is about 40% higher than that
given in Fig. 5.14. The measured value of the
temperature coefficient was corrected accordingly
to give a value of —4.6 (Ak/k)/°F for the low power.
This value is comparable to that subsequently
obtained during high-power operation and, as noted
in the subsequent discussion, the data from experi-
ment H-8 yielded the best values for both the fuel
and the reactor temperature coefficients.

The apparent time lag between the reactivity and
the minimum mean temperature, as first noted during
the subcritical measurement of the temperature
coefficient, was still in evidence here. Possible
explanations of the time lag, as well as other
details of the various temperature coefficient
measurements, are given in Appendix O.

ADJUSTMENT OF CHAMBER POSITION

During the critical experiment and the low-power
operation, it was desirable to have the nuclear
instruments positioned to read at as low a power
as possible. The chambers were therefore as

close to the reactor as possible. Before increasing
the power, it was necessary to adjust the positions
of the nuclear chambers so that they would read at
higher power levels. This was accomplished by
adjusting the power level! of the reactor to about
100 w and then moving the compensated log N
chamber away from the reactor so that its reading
was changed from 0.032 to 0.001, or its upper limit
was extended by a factor of about 30, With the
reactor power at about 1 kw, the micromicroammeter
chamber was moved away from the reactor so that
its reading was changed from 41.4 on the 5 x 10-7
amp range to 54 on the 1 x 108 amp range. This
extended the upper limit of the meter by a factor of
about 40. While one chamber was adjusted the
reactor power was held constant by the other
chambers so that the correlation between instru-
ment readings was not lost. The nuclear power for
the experiment was determined on this basis.

In the final analysis, the correlation between
chamber readings and reactor power can be based
on .the 25-hr xenon run during which a good value
for the extracted power was obtained. The micro-
microammeter read 52.5 on the 2 x 10=3 scale
when the log N read 22.5, and both corresponded
to an extracted power of 2.12 Mw.

6. HIGH.POWER EXPERIMENTS

The low-power tests were concluded by noon on
November 8. During the last few days of the low-
power tests all last minute details in preparing the
system for high-power operation had been under
way, These preparations included lubricating all
rotating equipment, refilling oil reservoirs, chang-
ing filters, replacing motor brushes, checking all
instrumentation, etc. By 1445 on November 8 the
pits had been sealed, i.e., covered with three
layers of 2},-ft-thick concrete blocks and calked,
and the experiment was ready for the high-power
phase of the operation, the chronology of which is
given in Fig. 6.1.

Prior to the start of the high-power experiment
the final addition of fuel concentrate, which was
to provide the reactor with sufficient excess
reactivity to overcome burnup and fission-product

" poisoning, was made. This last addition consisted

of 15.419 Ib of concentrate diluted with 32.379 Ib
of partially enriched fuel (part of that removed from
the system earlier when the pump level was trimmed)
and was injected into the system through the
sample line on the morning of November 7. The
sample line was used for this final enrichment
operation because the transfer line through which
the concentrate had hitherto been injected into the
system had again developed a leak. It was neces-
sary to lower the melting point of the concentrate
(by dilution) because it was not certain that the
sample line could otherwise safely maintain the
high temperature required.

High power, which may be defined for the ARE
as anything over 0.1 Mw, was approached in a
series of successive steps of increasing power.
The power regime was not attained at once, because
leakage of fission activity from the system into the
pits and subsequently from the pits into the oc-
cupied parts of the building required that provision
be made to maintain the pits at a subatmospheric
pressure. The experiment could then continue
safely, and a power of greater than 2 Mw was first
attained early during the evening of November 9,

The remaining time (70 hr) of the ARE operation
was devoted to several experiments to determine
the high-power behavior of the reactor; these ex-
periments are described in detail in the following
sections. Starting in the evening of November 9,
the fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity (Exp.
H-4) and the over-all reactor temperature co-
efficient (Exp. H-5 and Exp. H-9) were measured.

58

The early hours of November 10 were used to take
the reactor to power from subcritical by making use
of the negative temperature coefficient (Exp. H-6).
Later in the day the sodium temperature coefficient
was measured (Exp. H-7), some other reactor
kinetics were studied (Exp. H-8), and the moderator
temperature coefficient was measured (Exp. H-10).
During this time the operating crews had opportunity
to familiarize themselves with the handling of the
reactor at power.

At 1835 on November 10, a 25-hr full-power xenon
run was started. For this run the reactor was held
in steady-state operation at 2.12 Mw by the negative
temperature coefficient and at a mean temperature
of 1311°F, Since equilibrium temperature condi-
tions prevailed during this run, a very good meas-
urement of extracted power could be made. The
run ended at 1935 on November 11. Later that
night, the effect on the power of stopping the
sodium flow was observed (Exp. H-12)}, and at
2237 a J o-Power run (Exp. H-13) was started to
observe the effect of xenon buildup and continued
for a period of 10 hr. During this run the reactor
power was approximately 200 kw. At 0835 on
November 12 no effect of xenon buildup had been
observed, and therefore the experiment was termi-
nated,

The morning of the last day, November 12, was
devoted to some more reactor kinetics studies and
a measurement of the maximum extracted power
available (Exp. H-14), which turned out to be about
2,5 Mw. On the afternoon of November 12 the
building was opened to visitors with proper clear-
ance, and the behavior of the reactor was demon-
strated to them. At 2004, an estimated total oper-
ating time of 100 Mw-hr having been accumulated,
the reactor was scrammed and the ARE experiment
was terminated.

APPROACH TO POWER

The initial phase of high-power operation of the
ARE began at 1445 on November 8, As shown in
Fig. 6.1, the power was raised in a series of
successive steps. At each power level, when
steady-state conditions had been obtained, a
complete set of control room data was taken. The
first experiment, H-1, was a 20-kw run. During
this run the safety chambers were withdrawn and
reset to scram at about 260 kw. At 1619 the
reactor was shut down because of the presence of

airborne radioactivity in the basement, Apparently
the gas fittings to the main fuel pump were leaking
and fission-product gases and vapors were leaking
into the pits and from the pits into the basement
through defective seals in some of the piping and
electrical junction panels connecting the basement
with the pits.

In order to prevent the leakage of activity into
the basement it was decided to operate the pits at
a slightly subatmospheric pressure. Accordingly,
a 2-in, pipeline was run in a direction south of the
ARE building for a distance of 1000 ft and termi-
nated in an uninhabited valley. Then, by means of
portable compressors and a jet, the pit pressure
was lowered by about 6 in. H,0, with the exhaust
from the compressors being bled into the 2-in.
pipeline. The pits were maintained at a negative
pressure for the balance of the experiment.

At 1125 on November 9 the reactor was again
brought to 20-kw power (Exp. H-2) for the purpose
of testing the new off-gas system to determine
whether or not the negative pressure of 6 in. H,0
in the pits was enough to keep the hot gases from
diffusing into the basement. During this run the
pit activity, as recorded on the pit monitrons, was
watched, and its decay after shutdown of the
reactor at 1246 was observed. From this run it was
ascertained that the subatmospheric pit pressure
would prevent pit activity from leaking into the
building.

At 1520 on November 9 the approach to power
was started again (Exp. H-3). At 1523 the reactor
was brought to a nominal power of 200 kw on a
17-sec period and leveled out. Six minutes later
the barrier doors were raised and the first at-
tempt to extract power was made. At 1529 the fuel
helium blower was turned on and the blower speed
was increased to 300 rpm, The nuclear power
again began to increase, but the safety chambers
had not been withdrawn far enough and they
scrammed the reactor when the power level had
reached about 260 kw.

After another false start, the safety chambers
were withdrawn again and set to scram at about 4
Mw. The reactor was then brought to 100 kw,
leveled out, and placed on flux servo at 1625, At
1626 it was taken off servo and the blower speed
was increased, this time to only 170 rpm. The
reactor power sfowly rose and at 1643 had leveled
off on the reactor temperature coefficient at about
500 kw. After a set of data had been taken and

the reactor mean temperature elevated, the blower

speed was increased to 400 rpm and the power level
continued to rise. By 1715 the power level had
leveled out at near T Mw.

The sodium blowers were turned on {at 1740) and
brought to a speed of about 500 rpm, Half an hour
later the fuel blower speed was increased to 1590
rpm, and in 10 min a steady-state power level of
about 2 Mw was reached. At this time the nuclear
and process instruments read as follows:

Log N power, | Mw 1.32
Micromicroammeter power, | Mw 1.38
Reactor inlet fuel temperature, 2 °F 1203
Reactor outlet fuel temperature, 2 OF 1440
Reactor mean fuel temperature, °F 1321

Fuel temperature difference across reactor, 2 °F 237
Fuel flow, gpm 46
Reactor sodium mean temperature, °F 1281
Sodium temperature difference across reactor, °F 10

Sodium flow, gpm 152

From these data the extracted power was calculated
as follows:

Power extracted from fuel, Mw 1.16
Power extracted from sodium, Mw 0.05
Power extracted from rod cooling, Mw 0.02
Total extracted power, 2 Mw 1.23

However, it was subsequently discovered that the
temperatures upon which this extracted power was
calculated were in error and, as discussed in
Appendix K, the actual temperature gradient at this
time was about 40% higher. Therefore, the ex-
tracted power was correspondingly higher than that
listed. A general discussion of the extracted power
appears in a following section.

The above-described power operation was main-
tained for about 1 hr, during which time no further
trouble was occasioned by the fission gases.
Power was reduced at 1900 and the reactor scrammed
at 1915, and thus the initial phase of the high-
power operation was concluded.

TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT MEASUREMENTS

Several experiments were performed in an at-
tempt to measure the effect on reactivity of temper-
ature changes of the various components of the

Set on the basis of the power calibration from fuel
activation.

2The temperatures and consequently the extracted
power values are in error as noted in the discussion
following the data.

reactor, In addition to the over-all reactor co-
efficient, experiments were run to obtain data on
the instantaneous fuel temperature coefficient and
the coefficients attributable to the sodium and the
beryllium oxide moderator. There were several
anomalies that developed in the course of these
experiments, the two most significant being (1) the
interpretation of the lag in the response between
the rod movement and the change in reactor temper-
atures as power was abstracted from the reactor
and (2) the discrepancy between the thermocouple
indications at the reactor (fuel and sodium inlet
and outlet temperatures) and those along the lines
to and from the reactor. These anomalies are
discussed in detail in Appendixes O and K,
respectively, It was concluded that the time lag
was not real (i.e., the fuel temperature should show
changes as soon as the reactivity does) and that
the line temperature most accurately reflects the
actual stream temperatures.

In the determination of a temperature coefficient
by varying the power extracted from the reactor,
the recorded temperatures are subject to correction,
as described in Appendix K. However, when the
temperature coefficient was determined, as in
Exp. H-5, by withdrawing the shim rods so that the
reactor slowly heated itself while the extracted
power remained constant, no correction needed to
be made for the temperature, Furthermore, this
technique minimized the temperature lag anomaly,
and the fuel and reactor temperature coefficients
derived from Exp. H-5 are therefore believed to be
the best experimental values for these coefficients,

Fuel and Reactor Temperature Coefficients

The fuel and reactor temperature coefficients
were both obtained from the same experiment, the
fuel being the instantaneous coefficient, the
reactor the ‘‘equilibrium’’ coefficient. The initial
attempts (Exp. H-4) to measure these coefficients
were not satisfactory because of the difficulty in
interpreting the results, and therefore the measure-
ment was repeated (Exp. H-5) in a somewhat
different manner,

In the first experiment, H-4, the procedure was
similar to that described previously under ‘‘Low-
Power Measurement of the Temperature Coefficient,’
and the data are presented in Figs. 6.2 and 6.3.
The first of these figures is the recording of the
position of the regulating rod as it was inserted by
the servo as the fuel was cooled by the helium flow
in the heat exchanger. Figure 6.3 is a recording of

SY

the mean fue! temperature with the rod displacement
as determined from Fig. 6.2 superimposed, De-
pending upon the time at which the slopes of the
two curves are compared, the temperature coefficient
appears to decrease from a value of ~—1,6 x 1074
(AR/R)/°F to ~4.43 x 107% (Ak/k)/°F toward the
end of the run. These values represent the recorded
data and are of course subject to the correction for
temperature, as discussed in Appendix K, even as
the data are subject to various interpretations be-
cause of the lag in the temperature data (see
Appendix OQ). Furthermore, the changes were made
quite rapidly, the entire run lasting only 5 min.

In an attempt to minimize the effect of the temper-
ature anomalies, the temperature coefficients were
then determined from an experiment (Exp. H-5) in
which the extracted power was held constant and
the shim rods were withdrawn. Starting with the
reactor at a mean temperature of 1260°F, the with-
drawal of the shim rods allowed the reactor to
gradually heat the whole system to 1315°F. Since
the reactor was a slave to the heat extraction
system, which was not changed, the extracted
power remained virtually constant during this time.
This process took about 35 min during which the
nuclear power was held constant at a nominal power
of 200 kw by the flux servo. The regulating rod
gradually withdrew to compensate for the decrease
in reactivity as the reactor temperature increased.
The data are tabulated in Table 6.1, and a plot of
rod withdrawal vs mean reactor temperature is
presented in Fig. 6.4. Inspection of Table 6.1
shows that the rate of change of the inlet and
outlet fuel temperatures followed the change in
mean fuel temperature very closely, and thus gave
assurance that the fuel throughout the reactor was
changing temperature at a uniform rate.

The most reliable values for the temperature
coefficients of the ARE were obtained from this
experiment, For the first 6 min the plot of rod
withdrawal vs reactor mean temperature shows a
slope of 0.296 in./°F. Since 1 in, of rod movement
is equivalent to 3.3 x 1074 Ak/k, the initial
temperature coefficient was ~9.8 x 1075 (AR/k)/°F.
After the first 6 min and up until conclusion of the
run, the curve in Fig. 6.4 demonstrates a constant
value of the temperature coefficient of —6.0 x 107°
(AR/k)/°F. These are the best values for these
coefficients that were obtained. lt should be noted
that the value for the over-all temperature coefficient
agrees to within 25% with the value previously

obtained from the low-power experiments. However, -

7, REACTOR MEAN TEMPERATURE (°F}

Fig. 6.4. Regulating Rod Movement as a Function of Reactor Mean Temperature, Experiment H-5.

the instantaneous value of —~9.8 x 1075 (Ak/k)/°F
is much more important from the reactor control
standpoint, and it was this large fuel temperature
coefficient which made the ARE demonstrate the
excellent stability described below under the
subtitle ‘'Reactor Kinetics.”

The value for the reactor temperature coefficient
was subsequently confirmed in a later experiment
(Exp. H-9) in which the system temperature was
changed by gradually cooling the sodium, which in
turn, cooled the fuel and the reactor. While the
curve obtained from this experiment was very
similar to that given in Fig. 6.4, the initial slope
could not be that due to the fuel temperature co-
efficients, because the fuel is one of the last con-
stituents in the reactor to feel the temperature
change. The “‘equilibrium’’ slope, however, should
be that determined by the reactor temperature co-
efficient, and a valve of —6.3 x 1075 (Ak/k)/°F

was obtained. No temperature correction was re-
quired because the extracted power in the fuel
system did not change (although that in the sodium
system did). This value agrees very well with
that obtained in the preceding experiment.

Sodium Temperature Coefficient

In order to measure the sodium temperature co-
efficient an experiment (Exp. H-7) was performed
in which the sodium was cooled and the correspond-
ing changes in sodium temperature and reactivity
were measured. In this experiment it was manda-
tory that the sodium be cooled rapidly and the
data recorded before the moderator had time to
cool. Otherwise, since the sodium bathes the
moderator, the moderator temperature would follow
the sodium temperature and introduce an extraneous
effect due to its (i.e., moderator) temperature co-
efficient. Accordingly, with the reactor at about

65

 

 

 
 

 

33 kw and no power being extracted from either
the fuel or the sodium, the sodium blower speeds
(2 blowers) were quickly raised from 0 to 2000
rpm. The reactor period immediately started to
change and went from infinity to 50 sec in 1.5
min, which, as shown in Fig. 5.4, corresponds to
a reactivity change of 3.5 x 1074 Ak/k. The con-
sequent rate of reactivity change was 2.33 x 1074
(AR/E)/ min. In this experiment the regulating rod,
as well as the shim rods, was held in a fixed
position. During the 1.5-min interval, the fuel
temperature was changing at a rate of about
—1°F/min and the sodium temperature was changing
at a rate of ~2,3°F/min. (The rate of change of
fuel mean temperature was corrected for the dis-
crepancy in the recorded mean temperature, as
described in App. K, but no comparable correction
was necessary in the rate of change of the sodium
temperature.) By applying the previously mentioned
value of —~9.8 x 1075 (Ak/k)/°F for the instantane-
ous fuel temperature coefficient to give a rate of
reactivity change for the fuel of 0.98 x 1074
(Ak/E)/min and subtracting from the rate of re-
activity change observed upon cooling the sodium,
it is found that the reactivity change caused by
the decrease in the sodium temperature is

2.33 x 1074 (Ak/E)/min (observed)
- 0.98 x 1074 (Ak/k)/min (fuel)

= 1.35 x 1074 (Ak/k)/min .

Then, by applying the observed rate of change of
the sodium temperature, the sodium temperature co-
efficient is found to be

1.35 x 1074 (Ak/k)/min
~2.3°F/min

= -5.88 x 1075 (AR/E)°F .

This value is valid if it is assumed that the
transient took place rapidly enough that there was
no appreciable change in the moderator tempera-
ture. The measurements were, however, subject
to considerable error because the temperature
changes involved were so small as to be quite
difficult to detect and a correction was necessary
in the fuel temperature because of thermal lags.

Moderator Temperature Coefficient

An experiment (H-10) was conducted in order to
determine the temperature coefficient of the moder-

66

ator. During this experiment the fuel temperature
was held constant and the speed of the blowers
for cooling the sodium was increased to change
the temperature of the moderator coolant, Since
this was done very slowly, the moderator did cool
down, in contrast to the earlier experiment (H-7)
in which the sodium temperature was changed so
rapidly that the moderator temperature was unable
to follow the sodium temperature. The earlier
experiment gave information as to the temperature
coefficient of the sodium alone, whereas experi-
ment H-7 gave the combined effect of sodium and
moderator changes. The reactivity was indicated
by the position to which the regulating rod was
adjusted by the flux servo.

The changes in the sodium and the moderator
temperatures slightly increased the heat loss of
the fuel, and the power had to be increased slightly
to keep the fuel mean temperature constant. In
fact, in the middle of the run the reactor mean
temperature was lower than at the beginning, but
before the final reading was taken, the reactor
mean temperature was brought back to its original
value. Table 6.2 gives the pertinent data. The
sodium inlet temperature was taken from a record-
ing of the temperature of the reflector coolant inlet
4 in. from the bottom of the reactor and the sodium
outlet temperature was taken from a recording of the
temperature of the reflector coolant outlet 3 in. from
the top of the reactor, The time recorded in column
one is the time when a reading was taken. The
change of the blower speed preceded this time by
a few minutes to allow the temperature equilibrium
to be established. As an indication of the estab-
lishment of the equilibrium, use was made of the
leveling off of the trace on the sodium temperature
differential recorder.

As can be seen from the table, the decrease of
the average sodium temperature from 1273 to
1246°F corresponds to a withdrawal of the regu-
lating rod from the 8-in. position to the 8.9-in. posi-
tion. At the lower temperature the reactor was less
reactive and showed that the temperature coefficient
was positive. The magnitude of this temperature
coefficient was small, (0.9 in./27°F) x 3.33 x 1074
(AR/EY/ ine = +1.1 x 1075 (Ak/R)°F. This co-
efficient is, however, the sum of the sodium temper-
ature coefficient and the moderator temperature
coefficient. Since the sodium temperature coefficient
was ~5.9 x 107°, the moderator temperature co-
efficient must be +6.9 x 107° (Ak/k)/°F. This

value is, of course, subject to all the inherent

MEASUREMENT OF THE XENON POISONING

At 1825 on November 10 a 25-hr run at a power
of 2.12 Mw was started for the purpose of measuring
the amount of xenon built up in the fuel (Exp. H-11).
As discussed in Appendix P, the reactor should
have been poisoned by about 2 x 1073 Ak/k after
25 hr, if it is assumed that no xenon escaped from
the molten fuel. Not only did the 25-hr run demon-
strate that very little of the fission-product gas

 

remained in the fuel but, also, that the reactor
possessed phenomenal stability. Except for a
minute withdrawal of the regulating rod to compen-
sate for a barely detectable drop in the mean re-
actor temperature, all readings on both reactor and
process instrumentation held constant within ex-
perimental error for the 25 hr. |t was assumed that
the rod withdrawal was due to xenon buildup in the
fuel. However, it could have been due to any of a
number of minor perturbations, and therefore the
experiment demonstrated an absolute upper limit
on the xenon poisoning.

An abstract of the log book and data sheets
during the experiment follows:

November 10, 1954

1825 Run started; reactor power, 2.12 Mw; rod position, 9.00 in.; reactor mean temperature, 1311°F

November 11, 1954

0635 Reactor mean temperature had decreased to 1309°F; rod withdrawn to 9.05 in.

0750 Reactor mean temperature up to 1310°F; rod withdrawn to 9.15 in,

1020 Reactor mean temperature 1310.5°F; rod withdrawn to 9.25 in.

1120 Reactor mean temperature 1311°F

1435 Reactor mean temperature down to 1310°F; rod withdrawn to 9.30 in.

1559 Reactor mean temperature up to 1311°F

1932 Reactor mean temperature up to 1312°F; rod still at 9.30 in.; end of run

’

It is to be noted that the temperature recorded
was actually one degree higher at the end of the
experiment than at the start; this indicates that
the withdrawal of the regulating rod by 0.3 in. may,
indeed, have been too much. The withdrawal was
unquestionably an upper limit on the compensation
needed for xenon poisoning and corresponded to a
Ak/k of 1x 107%, This was %, or 5% of the value
to be expected if the xenon had not left the fuel
(see Appendix P). Removal of the xenon probably
occurred by means of the swirling action of the
fuel as it went through the pump. As mentioned
previously, fission-product gases that probably
came from a leak in the gas fittings were detected
in the pits early in the experiment.

At the conclusion of Exp. H-11 at 1935, the re-
actor was operated at various power levels for 2 hr
in an experiment (Exp. H-12) for determining the
effect of the sodium flow rate on the extracted
power. At 2237 the reactor was set at 200 kw (one-
tenth full power) and held there by the flux servo
for 10 hr (Exp. H-13). If any appreciable amount
of xenon had been built up in the fuel from decay
of iodine formed during Exp. H-11, the poisoning
effect should have been observed by a compensating
rod withdrawal during this 10-hr period. No appre-
ciable rod withdrawal was observed, and therefore
it was concluded that if there was xenon poisoning
from Exp. H-11, it was negligible.

POWER DETERMINATION FROM
HEAT EXTRACTION

The most reliable method for determination of
actual reactor power was that based on the energy
removed from the reactor in the form of heat. The
inlet, outlet, and mean temperatures, the tempera-
ture difference of the fuel across the reactor, and
the temperature difference of the reflector coolant
were continually recorded. The rates of flow of
both the fuel and the sodium were recorded and
could also be determined from the speeds of the
pumps. Since the heat capacities of both the fuel
and the sodium were known, the power level of the
reactor could be determined by the sum of the
values obtained from the following relations:

P= 0.114, AT,

Py, = 0.0343 4, AT,

N
where
P_ = power from fuel heat extraction (Mw),
Py. = power from sodium heat extraction (Mw),

68

i]

q volume flow rate (gpm),

AT = temperature gradient across reactor of
the fuel or the sodium (°F).

Since both the fuel and the sodium were cooled
by helium passing across a liquid-to-helium heat
exchanger and the helium was cooled by passing
it over a helium-to-water heat exchanger, the re-
actor power could also be determined from the
water flow and temperature differences across the
helium-to-water heat exchangers. Since the fuel-
to-helium and sodium-to-helium heat exchangers
are close to their respective helium-to-water heat
exchangers, little heat was lost by the helium and
therefore practically all of the heat removed from
the fuel and sodium was transferred to the water.
The heat balance thus obtained was known as the
secondary heat balance, while that obtained directly
from the fuel and sodium systems was known as
the primary heat balance.

Initial comparisons of the primary and secondary
heat balances revealed discrepancies of the order
of 50%. Subsequent investigation revealed that
the temperature drops of the primary heat balance
were in error. The temperatures were obtained from
a few thermocouples located on fuel and sodium
lines within the reactor thermal shield that read
considerably lower than several thermocouples
located external to the thermal shield on the fuel
and sodium lines to and from the reactor. This
anomaly is discussed further in Appendix K. All
reactor inlet and exit temperatures were subse-
quently based on the external thermocouple readings.

A detailed analysis of the extracted power was
made (App. L) for the 25-hr xenon experiment
primarily because of the certainty that equilibrium
conditions had been established; also, this high-
power run at more than 2 Mw contributed almost
two-thirds of the megawatt-hours logged during the
entire reactor operation. For this run the primary
heat balance showed an extracted power of 2.12
Mw, and the secondary heat balance gave an ex-
tracted power of 2.28 Mw. The difference between
the two determinations was 7%. Furthermore, for
this run about 75% of the power was removed by
the fuel, about 24% by the sodium, and about 1%
by the rod cooling system.

Heat balances ond, hence, power determinations
were made for a number of other experiments during
the high-power operation; these are tabulated in

Appendix L.. One such heat balance that was of

particular interest was obtained during the maxi-

mum power run (Exp. H-14). For this run the mean
temperature was raised to 1340°F (to avoid a low-
temperature reverse), and the fuel and sodium
system blower speeds were increased to their
respective maximums. At equilibrium the power
levels indicated by the primary and secondary heat
balances were 2.45 and 2.53 Mw, respectively.
The line temperatures throughout the fuel ond
sodium systems during this experiment are shown
in Figs. 6.5 and 6.6, respectively. The tempera-
tures indicated along the lines are the actual
thermocouple readings of each point at equilibrium.
It may be noted that the outlet fuel line tempera-
ture averaged about 1580°F. The temperature
measured at the reactor was considerably lower,
as shown in Fig. 6.7, which shows a portion of the
instrument panel during this experiment.

REACTOR KINETICS

A distinctive control characteristic of any circu-
lating-fuel reactor is that the reactor power is
determined solely by that part of the system which
is external to the reactor, i.e., the heat extraction
equipment. In the power regime, control rods do
not appreciably influence the steady-state power
production, but the power extracted from the reactor
does influence the reactivity of the reactor and
hence renders the reactor controllable.

In order that such a system be acceptable as a
power reactor, it is requisite that the reactor have
a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity.
One of the most gratifying results of the ARE
operation was the successful demonstration of its
large negative temperature coefficient. This
temperature coefficient made it possible for the
reactor to maintain a balance between the power
extracted from the circulating fuel and coolant and
the power generated within the reactor. The tem-
perature cycling of the fuel was the mechanism by
which equilibrium was maintained.

A thorough understanding of control processes
in a circulating-fuel reactor with a negative tem-
perature coefficient is necessary for an appreciation
of the kinetic behavior of such a power reactor in
the power regime. An important purpose of the
ARE was the observation of the kinetic behavior
of the reactor under power coupling to its load
when perturbations in the reactivity were intro-
duced. Transient conditions could be induced both
by control rod motion and by variation of the
external power load. Information on the kinetic
behavior was obtained from a number of experiments

that were conducted during the period of power
operation. These are described in the following
sections, Preceding the discussion of these experi-
ments is a detailed qualitative description of the
temperature cycling of the circulating fuel which
is inherent to all kinetic phenomena.

Reactor Control by Temperature Coefficient

The control of a circulating-fuel reactor with a
negative temperature coefficient can best be under-
stood by following the course of a *'slug” of fuel
as it traverses the ARE system, For a description
of the course of a slug, it is assumed that at time
zero the system is in equilibrium, with isothermal
temperatures throughout; in this condition no power
is being extracted. At time t the fuel system
helium blower is turned on. It is also assumed
that at this time the slug of fuel under observation
is just entering the heat exchanger. In passing
through the heat exchanger the slug is cooled by
the helium blowing through the heat exchanger.
About 20 sec later the cooled slug enters the re-
actor and is registered as a decrease on the inlet
temperature indicator. Because it is cooler than
the fuel it is displacing, its density is greater and
therefore the number of uranium atoms per unit
volume is greater. This results in a greater fission
rate and, hence, a greater reactivity which, in turn,
increases the power generated. The temperature
of the slug rises as it passes through the reactor
because of increased power generation. The rise
in temperature of the slug results in its expansion
and decrease in reactivity. This, in turn, lowers
the rate of power generation. Eight seconds after
the slug enters the reactor it passes out into the
outlet line and is registered as an increase in
temperature on the outlet fuel temperature indi-
cator. In 47 sec from the start of its journey it is
back at the heat exchanger to be cooled again.

The masses of fuel behind the initial slug follow
the same pattern so that, since the fuel is a con-
tinuous medium, the power generated in the re-
actor’ will rise until the increased reactivity due
to the incoming fuel and decreased reactivity due
to the outgoing fuel attain a balance. At this
point equilibrium is reached between power ex-
tracted by the helium and the power generated in

 

3with a power reactor it is appropriate to speak of two
types of power: the nuclear power, i.e., the total power
generated within the reactor; and the extracted or useful
power, i.e., the power removed from the fuel and coolant
by cooling.

the reactor. The reactor power can thus be varied
at will merely by changing the rate of cooling, that
is, the demand for power. This type of reactor is
said to be a slave to the demand.

The nuclear power is proportional to the neutron
flux for any given critical concentration. The
neutron flux is conventionally measured by a
neutron detector, such as a Log N chamber system,
which consists essentially of a neutron detector
coupled to an electronic system which has a
logarithmic-type of output signal. This signal is
proportional to the neutron flux (and, hence, the
power) level, and is indicated and recorded on a
logarithmic scale.

The extracted power, on the other hand, is pro-
portional to the product of either the fuel flow and
the temperature difference between the inlet and
outlet sides of the heat exchanger (or reactor) or
the secondary (or tertiary) coolant flow and its
temperature difference. In the ARE the fuel was
cooled by helium flowing across it in the fuel-to-

72

helium heat exchangers. The heat picked up by
the helium was then removed by water in a helium-
to-water heat exchanger. It was possible to measure
the extracted power in both the fuel loop and the
water loop, as explained in a preceding section.

When no power is being extracted from a power
reactor, the nuclear power is determined by the
control rod and shim rod settings, and the reactor
is controlled by some type of servo mechanism
which keeps the power at some desired level.
When the reactor is taken off the servo and allowed
to respond to the demand of the cooling produced
in the heat exchanger, it will seek a power level
determined by the rate of heat removal. Once an
equilibrium between nuclear and extracted power
has been established, changing the shim rod or
regulating rod settings merely changes the nuclear
power level but does not alter the amount of power
being extracted. This change in nuclear power
results in a raising or lowering of the reactor mean
temperature, and, once the temperature change has

been effected and equilibrium re-established, the
nuclear power and the extracted power will again
be equal.?

The control of the ARE by extracted power demand
is illustrated in Fig. 6.8, which shows the tracings
made by several of the control room instrument
recorders during power operation between 1258 and
1329 on November 10, 1954. The reactor behavior
is demonstrated by reading the tracings right to
left, proceeding as follows: At 1258 the reactor
was in an equilibrium condition at about a 50-kw
power level. At 1259 the fuel system helium blower
was turned on and its speed was increased to 500
rpm. The reactor power, as noted on the Log N
chart, rose on a 10-sec period to slightly over 1
Mw, ‘“‘overshot’’ its mark, fluctuated somewhat in
the manner of a damped oscillator, and, finally,
some 4 min later, came to an equilibrium power of
around 900 kw. Soon, but not immediately, after
the blower was turned on, the reactor fuel inlet
temperature began to drop and the fuel outlet tem-
perature began to rise, while the reactor mean
temperature began to drop slightly. Each of these
temperatures showed the oscillatory phenomenon
noted with the Log N recorder. The reason for the
drop in the mean temperature was that both the
decrease and rate of decrease of the inlet tempera-
ture were greater than the corresponding increase
and rate of increase of the outlet temperature. The
inlet temperature dropped from 1335 to 1256°F% at
a rate of 1.54°F/sec and the outlet temperature
rose from 1405 to 1475°F at a rate of 1.36°F/sec;
as a result the mean temperature fell from 1370 to
1365°F at a rate of about 0.1°F/sec. The fact that
the mean temperature dropped (and this was a
characteristic phenomenon noted throughout the
power operation) rather than remaining constant
can be explained, at least in part, by the distortion
of the flux patterns within the reactor. The highest
fluxes were toward the inlet fuel passages, and
the lowest fluxes were toward the outlet fuel
passages (cf., App. 0).

At 1310 the blower speed was increased from 500

40n several occasions the nuclear power, as indicated
on the Log N recorder, rose temporarily above 2.5 Mw,
but the extracted power, limited by the system capacity
for removing heat, never exceeded 2.5 Mw,

Errors in marking the charts could conceivably ac-
count for as much as 1/2 min of the time differences
noted. This phenomenon of time lag is discussed later
in this section,

The temperature readings given here and elsewhere
in this section have been corrected by the method given
in Appendix K.

to 1000 rpm, and the power rose from 1 to 1.8 Mw
on a period of 7.5 sec, with corresponding changes
of the inlet, outlet, and mean temperatures. Al-
though the power increase in this case was compa-
rable to the first power increase, the rates of rise
of both the power and temperatures were much
less, being on the order of one-half as much for
the temperatures.

The effect of withdrawing the regulating rod 3 in.
is demonstrated with the next rise at 1312 in
Fig. 6.8. Up to this time the trace of the regu-
lating rod position was constant, since it was not
on servo. With the withdrawal of the rod the rise
of the nuclear power was immediate. After some
delay, all of the temperatures showed a rise.
Interestingly enough, the outlet temperature rose
16°F, the mean 12°F, and the inlet 9°F. This
pattern, with the outlet temperature showing the
greatest change, was characteristic of the temper-
ature changes incurred by shim rod and regulating
rod movement during power operation. After the
rod movement the temperatures leveled out at the
higher values, but the nuclear power fevel slowly
drifted back to the equilibrium position.

At 1321 the blower was shut off and the charts
show the result of the shift toward isothermal (no
power) conditions. Two minutes later, when the
nuclear power had decreased to about 600 kw, the
blower was again started and its speed was in-
creased to 1500 rpm. The nuclear power level rose
initially to 2.6 Mw, and it again went through an
oscillatory cycle before settling down to 2.2 Mw.
The corresponding temperature oscillations were
again noted. These oscillations were of sufficient
strength to determine an oscillation period of about
2.25 min. An interesting observation at this point
was that the time lag of temperature response for a
higher initial power (600 kw compared with 50 kw)
was only about one-half the lag during the first
rise to power at 1259. This phenomenon had been
noted previously in connection with the various
temperature coefficient experiments (cf., App. O).

Table 6.3 shows the data obtained from the
nuclear and process instruments during the typical
operation period shown in Fig. 6.8.

Startup on Demand for Power (Exp. H-6)

slave to the load, an experiment was performed in
which the reactor was brought to subcritical and

rods). The experiment consisted of two runs. In
the first run the reactor was taken directly from
100 kw to slightly over 2 Mw. In the second run
the reactor was taken to power from a subcritical
condition.

The progress of these experiments, as recorded
by the thermocouple recorders on the inlet and

outlet sides of the six individual fuel tubes, is

shown in Fig. 6.9. Reading from right to left, the
reactor was at 200 kw power at 2300 on November
9 at the beginning of the experiment. The fuel
system helium blower speed was increased to 1700
rpm slowly, starting at 2307. Ten minutes later
the sodium system coolant blowers were turned on.
As the power rose to about 2.5 Mw, a temperature
difference of some 320°F appeared across the re-
actor tubes. This is shown in Fig. 6.9 by the
parting of the inlet and outlet temperature indi-
cations of the reactor fuel tubes. This temperature

76

difference remained constant until the blower speed
was reduced at 2340. At 2345 the inlet and outlet
tube temperatures were nearly the same again at
200 kw power. A sharp drop in the tube tempera-
tures at this point corresponded to the insertion
of the shim rods.

The sharp increase in the temperature differential
across the tubes at 2353 was the result of a steep
rise in power when the blower speed was increased
from 0 to 1700 rpm. At 0005 on November 10, the
regulating rod was first entirely inserted (from
7 in. withdrawn) and then fully withdrawn. This
motion was followed by a drop and then a sharp
rise in the fuel tube temperatures. This action
marked the end of Run 1.

During Run 2 the reactor was brought subcritical
by turning off the fuel system helium blower and
inserting the regulating rod, starting at 0016. The
sodium system helium blowers had been operating

some of the time during Run 1 to extract power from
the sodium. As soon as the reactor became sub-
critical the operation of the sodium system blowers,
which were then removing about 400 kw of power
from the sodium, made the reactor go critical again
and stabalize at the 400 kw level within 5 min, ltis
interesting to note that because the mean sodium
temperature was some 65°F lower than the mean fuel
temperature, the fuel temperatures dropped 65°F
during this time from a mean temperature of 1395 to
1330°F, even though the nuclear power was in-
At 0026 the fuel system blower was
turned on again and the nuclear power temporarily
rose to 3 Mw.* Two minutes after the fuel system
blower was turned on, the fuel heat exchanger
outlet temperature went below T1150°F and the
automatic heat-exchanger-temperature interlock re-
duced the blower speed until the heat exchanger
outlet (reactor inlet) temperature had risen above
1150°F. At 0030 the reactor power had leveled
out at 1 Mw. It had thus been successfully demon-
strated that the power demand would bring the
reactor critical; therefore, at 0033, the fuel and
sodium system blowers were turned off and the
experiment brought to an end.

Effect of One Dollar of Reactivity (Exp. H-8)

One of the objectives of the ARE was the obser-
vation of effects of introducing excess Ak into the
reactor during high-power operation. The intro-
duction of the excess Ak could be most easily
accomplished by movement of the regulating rod,
which was worth 0.4% excess k (one dollar of
reactivity).
withdrawing the regulating rod from an entirely
inserted position, and recording or noting the
effects and, then, after equilibrium had been estab-
lished, inserting the rod to its original position.
Since the regulating rod had a travel rate of
0.32 in./sec, reactivity could be introduced at the
rate of 0.011% Ak/k-sec. Fig. 6.10 shows the
history of the experiment.

At 1110 on November 10, with the reactor at an
initial power of 2.2 Mw, the regulating rod was
withdrawn its full 12 in. of travel. The reactor
went on an observed 42-sec period’ until the
nuclear power was 3.9 Mw 35-sec later. The re-

One experiment consisted merely of

"This period was measured from the Log N recorder
trace. The period recorded on the period meter was
partially a time rate of change of period since Ak/k was
not constant but was increasing during this time. A
discussion of this is given in Appendix S.

actor fuel temperatures rose an average of 45°F in
49 sec. Once the rod withdrawal had been com-
pleted, the fuel inlet and outlet temperatures
leveled off at new values. The extracted power
rose a few per cent when the rod was withdrawn,
mainly because, with the higher fuel mean tempera-
ture, the rate of cooling and, hence, the rate of
heat removal in the heat exchanger was greater.
Since the extracted power rose only slightly during
this time, the nuclear power slowly drifted down-
word from its peak of 3.9 Mw to 2.9 Mw, as can be
seen in Fig. 6.10. Note that the mean temperature
continued its upward trend. Three minutes later
the rod was completely inserted. The nuclear
power decreased from 2.9 to 1.4 Mw on a 47-sec’
period and then slowly drifted back to 2.2 Mw, the
starting power. The fuel temperatures then re-
turned to values slightly higher than their original
values. A characteristic behavior of the outlet
temperature was again noted during this experiment,
namely, that movement of a rod affected the outlet
temperature most and the inlet temperature the
least. Additional data on this experiment are given
in Table 6.4.

Again, with this experiment, a time lag was
noted; the inlet temperature lagged behind the out-
let temperature by about the fuel transit time of
47 sec. A reasonable explanation for this lag is
that the time required for the fuel in the reactor at
the start of the experiment to affect the inlet line
thermocouple is the transit time through the system.

Because of this difference in response of the
thermocouples on the inlet and outlet fuel lines
when the rod was withdrawn, the temperature
differential across the reactor rose from 341°F to
a peak value of 395°F in about 1 min and then
dropped to a more or less constant value of 355°F,
which was 14°F higher than at the start. This
means that the extracted power rose slightly, about
8%. Examination of the tracings of the fuel and
sodium heat exchanger cooling water recorders for
this time indicated that the fuel power extraction
went up 6% and the sodium power extraction roughly
2%. The rise in power extraction was due mainly
to the higher mean temperatures and thus the higher
cooling rates attained. The extracted power rose
to about 2.4 Mw at the new equilibrium. The dif-
ference (500 kw) between this value and 2.9 Mw,
as shown by the Log N recorder, went to heating
the reactor. This was evidenced not only by the
continuing increase in reactor mean fuel tempera-
ture but also by the rising travel in inlet and outlet

Power Cycling of Reactor

The last day of operation of the ARE, November
12, was devoted to maximum power runs and to
demonstrations of the reactor operation to visitors.
The complete history of the reactor operation during
that time is shown in Fig. 6.11. Chart A shows
the trace of the sodium temperature differential
across the reactor and chart B shows the trace of
the outlet temperature of the water from the fuel
heat exchangers. Clearly seen in chart A are the
three maximum power runs at 10:00 AM, 12:30 and
7:45 PM. Both charts show the cycling of the
extracted power that the system underwent, but
the cycles are especially well defined in chart B,
which shows the heat exchanger water temperatures
varying from a low of 65°F to a high of 140°F,
corresponding to total extracted powers of from
around 100 kw to over 2 Mw. In the 12 hr between
8:00 AM and 8:00 PM, 24 complete cycles were
recorded. In the afternoon hours between 1:00 and
4:00 PM, when the most visitors were present, the
reactor was cycled an average of 3 times per hour.
Of interest to the visitors were the tracings of the
reactor fuel tube AT recorders. The photograph
reproduced as Fig. 6.12, which was taken during
one of the cycles, shows each of the six fuel tube
AT recorders simultaneously tracing out the same
power cycle pattern. The picture was taken about

12:30 PM during one of the maximum power runs.
The recorders show AT's of around 250°F. The
actual fuel tube differences at this time were more
nearly 355°F.

Additional information on the power cycling may
be obtained from Fig. 6.13 which shows the three
temperature cycles recorded in the hour between
1:10 and 2:10 PM on the last day. Shown in this
figure are traces from the six fuel tube AT re-
corders, a time condensation® of the micromicro-
ammeter recorder (which traced the power), one of
the heat exchanger outlet temperature recorders,
and the individual fuel tube temperature recorder.

Referring to the micromicroammeter trace and
reading from right to left starting at 1317, the
events are elaborated for the first cycle. The other
two cycles are similar.

At 1317 the fuel system helium blower was turned
off, and the reactor power was allowed to decrease
from a level of 1.8 Mw. Eight minutes later the
power had fallen to about 130 kw, and the blower
was turned on to 1700 rpm. The power rose quickly
to 2.3 Mw, at which point a low-heat-exchanger-
temperature blower reverse occurred; that is,
when the helium cooling lowered the heat exchanger
outlet fuel temperature to 1150°F (as noted above),
a relay was automatically actuated that decreased
the helium blower speed until such time as the

8 This condensation was necessary because the origi-

nal chart ran at a speed of 80 in./hr, while charts used
subsequently ran at a speed of only 4 or 5 in./hr,

outlet temperature rose to above 1150°F, During
this time the power fell to 1.1 Mw. At 1328 a
“permit’’ signal was given and the power was
again increased. When 2 Mw was reached the re-
actor was leveled off on extracted power and for
10 min the effect of regulating rod movement was
demonstrated to visitors.

The maximum nuclear power attained during the
first cycle was 2.8 Mw* at 1340. During the third
cycle at 1410 a nuclear power of 3.4 Mw was
reached.

The six fuel tube AT recorders (Fig. 6.12) fol-
lowed exactly the same pattern as the micromicro-
ammeter recorder. It should be noted, however,
that the actual AT’'s were of the order of 100
degrees higher than those shown on the charts.
At the high power peaks of the third cycle the fuel
outlet line temperatures, as read in the basement,
were indicated to be about 1625°F. The inlet

temperatures ranged from an actual (vs observed)

high of 1340°F to a low of 1150°F during the low-
heat-exchanger-temperature blower reverse.

The change in tube AT's as a result of rod move-
ment was due partly to the phenomenon of the time
lag between the inlet and outlet thermocouples.
Had there been no lag the effect of rod motion on
these cauples would have been small.

The fuel heat exchanger outlet temperatures
showed the temperature cycles in reverse. The
first high peak corresponds to the condition at
1300°F with the blower off. As the blower was
turned on the temperature decreased to 1150°F,
at which point, as noted, the blower reverse oc-
curred with the resultant decrease in blower speed.
The heat exchanger outlet temperature then rose
to 1250°F before the blower speed was allowed to
increase again.

The data from these and other recorder charts
during this time, together with calculated rates
of change, are given in Table 6.5.

Reactor Transients

One of the characteristics of the reactor that was
most important from the operator's point of view
was the behavior under transient conditions, be-
cause it is only through transient effects that the
operator acquires a ‘‘feel’”’ for the way the reactor
responds to his control under varying conditions.
The various ways in which transients may be
introduced into the reactor are the following:
operation of fuel system helium blower,
operation of sodium system helium blowers,
operation of rod cooling system helium blowers,
changing the fuel flow rate,
changing the sodium flow rate,
movement of shim rods,

NOU AWN

. movement of regulating rods.

A discussion of the effects on the ARE of some
of these operations is given in succeeding para-
graphs. Effects 3 and 5 were very small although
observable. Effect 4 was not observed at high
power because of the danger of freezing fuel in the
pump, although it can be calculated from the inhour
curves (Fig. 5.11) and the known rate of change
of fuel pump speed. Table 6.6 lists calculated
rates of interjection of Ak/k into the reactor by
the various means listed above.

It has already been pointed out that the ARE
reactor and system were very sluggish in responding
to demands at high power. Furthermore, it was
observed that the response at low power (less than
100 kw) was much different from its response at
higher powers (at 1 Mw or greater). One way to
examine the behavior of the reactor is to plot sys-

tem characteristics against the initial power, since
this represents the behavior from a given initial
condition of the reactor.

One of the properties investigated in the above
manner was the reactor period. Some of the ob-
served reactor periods are plotted as a function of
the initial power in Fig.. 6.14. Since the reactor
could be put on any period from infinite to a given
minimum, the points in Fig. 6.14 are scattered.
Most of the longer periods represent periods ob-
served during such times as the initial rise to
power, which was approached with caution. As
the operators became more familiar with the oper-
ation at power, deliberate attempts were made to
see how fast a period the reactor would attain due
to blower operation or rod movement. As a result,
definite lower limits were established beyond
which reactor periods could not be induced by the
controls available to the operator. The solid line
in Fig. 6.14 represents the lower limit for periods
during blower operation and the dashed line is that
corresponding to shim and regulating rod move-
ment.” The smallest period observed during high-
power operation was the 10-sec period represented
by the rise in the Log N chamber at 1259, Fig.
6.8. A few smaller periods were observed in the
very low-power regime just above critical. The
two lines shown in the figure indicate that the
lower the power the greater the transient that can

%If the reactor had been taken to power with the shim
rods inserted to greater depths, smaller periods would
have been observed for shim rod motion than are repree
sented by the dashed line, since the reactivity value
of the rods would have been greater for those insertions,

be introduced into the reactor, i.e., the higher the
power the harder it becomes to introduce a transient
condition. Extrapolation of the solid line to a
power of 1 kw indicates that at this power reactor
periods of 1 sec or less could have been intro-
duced by blower operation.

It should be pointed out that periods could be
observed which were not true periods but were a
combination of the observed period and its time
derivative. Whenever a sudden reactivity change
occurred, such as when a rod was moved slightly,
the period meter would register a transient peak
period that was very small compared with the true
period. The beginning peak in the period curves
of Fig. 5.4 are of this nature. Whenever a con-
tinuing change of Ak/k was taking place, the ob-
served period was not a true period but, again, a
combination of the true period and its time deriva-
tive. In Fig. 6.10 the period meter did not register
a constant period when the regulating rod was
moved but, rather, a continually changing period.
Also, it is to be noted that the Log N power re-
corder did not register straight slopes during the
power changes but, instead, constantly changing

88

ones, which again indicated that the period was
changing (cf., App. S).

The time behavior of the fuel temperatures as a
result of blower operation was obtained by plotting
inlet and outlet fuel temperature time rates of
change against the initial power. These plots are
shown in Fig. 6.15. Larger rates of change of fuel
temperatures were observed at lower powers, and
they corresponded to the smaller periods observed.
The greatest rates of change of the fuel tempera-
tures were observed at an initial power of 280 kw,
at which time the inlet temperature changed at a
rate of ~2.75°F/sec and the outlet temperature
at a rate of +2.6°F/sec. The only reason higher
rates of change were not observed at powers
lower than this was that in the low-power regime
the kinetic behavior was not well known and there-
fore a conservative approach to transient con-
ditions was used.

The rates of decrease of temperatures when the
blower was turned off and the reactor was allowed
to come to a lower power are also plotted in Fig.
6.15. The trend of rates of change of the tempera-
tures seems to be reversed.

INITIAL EXTRACTED POWER (Mw)

Fig. 6.15. Time Behavior of Reactor Fuel Temperatures as a Function of Initial Extracted Power.

Some very general observations on the transient
behavior of the ARE reactor are summarized below.

Reactor Periods. In general, the lower the initial
power the faster was the transient introduced by
any type of operation that resulted in upsetting the
equilibrium between nuclear and extracted power.
The smaller periods were associated with lower
initial powers.

Oscillation of Reactor Power. The character-
istic behavior of the nuclear power during an estab-
lished transient was to ‘‘over-shoot'’ and then
oscillate around a mean value before settling down
to that power. The period of the osciilation ap-
peared to be of the order of 2 min and lasted for
about 2 cycles.

Movement of Rods. The reactor was always more
prompt to respond to rod motion than it was to
blower operation. Also the reactor periods observed
at a given power were smaller due to rod movement
than those due to blower operation.

Nuclear Power, Whenever blower speed was
changed the nuclear power rose (with oscillations

as noted above) to a higher power level than the
corresponding extracted power demand. When a
rod movement occurred, the nuclear power changed
considerably, which resulted in higher or lower
reactor over-all temperatures, and then leveled out
to a new balance with the extracted power at about
the original power level.

Extracted Power. Extracted power was essen-
tially a function only of the demand and changed
due to a change in operation of one of the various
heat exchanger blowers. During rod movement at
a given demand power, the extracted power re-
mained essentially constant. The unbalance be-
tween extracted and nuclear power resulted in a
change of the mean reactor temperature.

Reactor Outlet Fuel Temperature. The outlet
fuel temperature always rose and fell in the same
direction as the nuclear power level. For blower
operation the rise in the outlet temperature was
always less than the fall of the inlet temperature.
The opposite was true for regulating rod movement.

Reactor Inlet Fuel Temperature. The inlet fuel

89

“ree

pr

 

 
 

 

temperature rose and fell in the opposite direction
to the change in nuclear power during blower oper-
ation and in the same direction as the nuclear
power during rod movements. The inlet tempera-
ture change was greater than the outlet temperature
change for blower operation. The opposite was
true for shim rod operation.

Reactor Mean Temperature, The reactor mean
temperature followed the trend of the reactor inlet
temperatures in all cases, except that the changes
and rates of change were much smaller.

Time Lags. The system was very sluggish be-
cause of the long tansit time (47 sec) of the fuel.
In addition to the sluggishness of the system, there
appeared to be time lags between the responses of
various temperature indicating instruments for the
same action. These lags were of the order of 2
min for low-power operation (less than 100 kw) and
of the order of 1 min for full-power operation in the
megawatt range. The topic of time lags is dis-
cussed in greater detail in a following section.

Calculated Power Change Resulting from a
Regulating Rod Movement

A formula was developed which would estimate
a power change in the reactor from a given change
in the reactor outlet temperature and a regulating
rod movement. This was possible primarily be-
cause of the relationships existing between P,
AT, .and Ak/k. The development of the relation-
ship is described below.

When equilibrium exists between extracted power
and nuclear power, the power level is given by

P = kg AT = kq (T, - T) ,
where
k = a constant (specific heat of the fuel),

. gq = fuel flow (gpm),

AT = the difference between inlet and outlet
fuel temperatures,

T, = outlet fuel temperature,

T, = inlet fuel temperature.

Also the mean reactor fuel temperature is given by

and
AT = T, - T

From this it is seen that
AT = 21 - 2r ,

and

P = 2kq(T, -T,) . :

Now consider a change AP in the power:
AP = 2kq (AT, - AT) ,

by putting in the experimental values, 10 it is seen
that

The change in power, as calculated from this
formula, checked closely the observed power change
for several different cases which were examined.
The calculated data are given in Table 6.7.

Reactor Temperature Differential as a Function
of Helium Blower Speed

A relationship between the fuel system helium
blower speed and the resulting fuel AT was ob-
tained from the data taken during ARE operation.

Whe factor 0.72 is used to correct the temperatures
in the manner described in Appendix K.

*Data recorded during Exp. H-8.

Some of the experimental fuel AT's are plotted in
Fig. 6.16 as a function of their corresponding
blower speeds. These points could be represented
by a parabola of the form

AT? = Ks ,
where
K = a constant of proportionality,
s = the blower speed.

The curve that fit the experimental points best was
found to be

AT = (0.75s)V/2

where AT is expressed in hundreds of degrees F
and s is given in hundreds of rpm.
The extracted power can now be expressed in

terms of blower speed: p=

P = kq AT = kq(0.75s)"/2
= [0.11 x 46 x (0.75s)'/?] x 102 x 10-3
= 0.506 (0.755) 2 Mw .

The factor 102 is used because AT is expressed
in the empirical formula in hundreds of degrees.
The 10-2 factor expresses power in megawatts.
The results obtained with the formula checked
with the observed values of power in numerous
cases. As an example, during experiment H-3, for
a blower speed of 1590 rpm, an extracted power
of 1.75 Mw was observed. The formula gives

P = 0.506 [0.75 (15.912 = 1.75 Mw .

The Phenomenon of the Time Lag

" One of the most noteworthy phenomena encoun-
tered during the experiment was the time lag that
seemed to be an intrinsic part of the system be-
havior. it was remarkably demonstrated in Fig. 6.8
when the blower was turned on. It was 0.75 min

later that the inlet temperature records showed a
response, about 1.5 min before the mean tempera-
ture began dropping, and almost 2 min before the
outlet temperature showed a corresponding rise.
The reasons for the lags are obscure, but in an
attempt to analyze the phenomenon several things
must be considered: the extensiveness of the sys-
tem, the reactor geometry, i.e., location of inlet
and outlet fuel passages with respect to reactor
core, heat transfer properties and possible phe-
nemona within reactor, location, design, and attach-
ment of the thermocouples within the reactor, and
other unknown factors. There is a good possibility
that the time lag phenomenon was connected with
the temperature discrepancies noted in Appendix K.

Errors in marking the charts could possibly
account for as much as 0.5 min, but certainly this
cannot wholly account for the lag which was noted

91

 

 

 
 

 

consistently throughout the progress of the experi-
ment. There is no doubt the system was vey
sluggish and slow to respond. This sluggishness
was undoubtedly due, in large part, to the length
of the fuel system. The transit time in the system
was about 47 sec at full pump speed, as observed
during the critical experiments. There does not
seem to be any convenient mechanism for ex-
plaining longer time lags. A partial explanation
is advanced in Appendix O, where geometrical
considerations show that the instantaneous temper-
ature change of the fuel was greater near the center
of the reactor than at the points of the thermo-
couple locations. Thus the nuciear power was
observed to change before the inlet and outlet
thermocouples indicated changes.

An attempt was also made to analyze the heat
transfer conditions within the reactor. Since the
fuel and sodium flows were in opposite directions
within the reactor, the fuel inlet line thermocouples
were located near sodium outlet lines and the fuel
outlet line thermocouples were located near sodium
inlet lines. The temperature differences existing
between the sodium (and moderator) and the fuel
near the inlet and outlet thermocouples were of the
order of 100°F or more and could possibly have
influenced the readings of the thermocouples. This
phenomena was investigated, '! and no delay ap-
proaching 2 min could be ascribed to the heat
transfer characteristics of the system. The greatest
time lag which could be found in the heat transfer
mechanism was of the order of a few seconds. The
time lags of the reactor AT and mean temperature
thermocouples were also investigated because
these thermocouples had been insulated from the
metal of the system. The time lags found were of
the order of 15 sec or less, and thus they were
about the same as those for uninsulated thermo-
couples. An experimental check showed that

~ helium from the rod-cooling system had no appreci-
able effect on the readings of fuel temperatures
when the blower speed was changed. Therefore,
the phenomena of lag and low temperature readings
could not be attributed to this cause.

It may well be that what may be described as
“thermal inertia’ played a part in the time lag.
Since the reactor as a whole did not respond to a
temperature change very fast, even though the
fuel did, the thermocouple readings could have
been affected to the extent that they received heat

Hy, F. Poppendiek, Reactor Experimental Engi-
neering,

92

not only from the fuel tubes but from other parts
of the reactor. Better design and location of the
thermocouples might have prevented such time lags.

Reactivity Effects of Transients in the
Sodium System

The introduction of transient conditions into the
sodium system was expected to have only small
effects on reactor behavier. This proved to be the
case in the few instances for which data are avail-
able. The two operations of the sodium system
which were observed to have effects on reactivity
were changing the rate of sodium flow and changing
the rate of sodium cooling.

The first effect was observed as a part of one of
the low-power experiments (Exp. L-7), in which,
with the reactor on servo at 1-w power, the fuel
flow rate was varied and the change in the regu-
lating rod position was noted. The concluding
portion of the experiment consisted in stopping the
sodium coolant flow and observing the change in
regulating rod position with the fuel flow at its
normal value of 46 gpm. During this time the regu-
lating rod changed from 7.85 to 7.69 in., a move-
ment of 0.16 in., which corresponded to a Ak/k of
only 5.3 x 10=3. This experiment was not repeated
at high power, and therefore no data are available
on reactor power and temperature changes as a
function of sodium flow.

The second effect, the effect on the reactor sys-
tem of changing the sodium cooling rate, was ob-
served in Exp. H-12 during high-power operation.
In this experiment the sodium system helium
blowers were turned off and the following power
and temperature changes were observed. At 2110
on November 11 the reactor was at 2.1-Mw extracted
power; of this amount, approximately 1.6 Mw was
being extracted from the fuel and 0.5 Mw from the
sodium. At 2113 the sodium system helium blowers
were turned off, and the power dropped, in the next
90 sec, to 1.96 Mw at a rate of 1.5 kw/sec, and,
in the next 9% min, it dropped at a much slower
rate of 280 w/sec and leveled off at 1.80 Mw. The
total decrease in power was 300 kw. It is to be
noted that since the extracted power from the
sodium at the beginning of the experiment was
500 kw, about 200 kw of heat was still being lost
by radiation and other means through the barrier
door openings and other parts of the circuit, even
with the helium circulation stopped. When the
helium blower was turned on again at 2124 the
reactor responded with an initial rise of 120 kw to

1.92 Mw at the rate of 1.33 kw/sec and then a very
slow rise over a period of nearly 18 min to 2.06 Mw
at a rate only 0.1 as great.

Any over-all reactor temperature effect from
sodium transients would have been reflected in a
change in the mean fuel temperature, and therefore
the mean fuel temperature was observed. When
the sodium blower was turned off at 2113 the re-
actor mean fuel temperature dropped from 1313 to
1310°F in 3 min, corresponding to the initial power
decrease noted. There was no drop in temperature
which matched the very slow rate of decrease in
power after the initial decrease. Upon starting the
sodium blowers again at 2124 the mean temperature
rose 13°F in 5 min to a new value of 1323°F, 10°F
higher than at the start of the experiment. The
increase over the initial temperature was partly
attributable to the thermal inertia of the reactor.
The reactor did not lose heat rapidly, but, when the
blowers were again turned on, the nuclear power
production increased by 300 kw and raised the
temperature level to above that at the initial con-
dition.

It may be concluded from these results that
neither stopping the sodium flow or the sodium
cooling had much effect on the reactor behavior.
It is interesting to observe that the mean reactor
fuel temperature went down with the decrease in
nuclear power, which resulted from stopping the
sodium blowers. It might be suspected that the
reactor mean temperature would have risen because
of lack of cooling in the moderator.

Reactivity Following a Scram

The behavior of a reactor after a scram is de-
termined primarily by delayed neutrons and photo-
neutrons, '2 which in the ARE were produced in
the beryllium oxide moderator. These processes
keep the flux of the reactor from decaying immedi-
ately.

It was observed that after every scram the re-
actor decay took place in a series of descending
oscillations, the time between oscillations being
equal to the fuel transit time of 47 sec. Figure
6.17 shows a trace of one of the fission chambers
after the scram at the conclusion of Run 7 of Exp.
L-5, one of the low-power runs. The scram took
place at the extreme right-hand edge of the trace.
Six prominent pips and many lesser ones can be
seen as the decay progressed.

12, Glasstone and M. C. Edlund, Elements of Nuclear
Reactor Theory, Yan Nostrand, p 88-89 (1952).

This behavior can be explained on the basis that
the slug of fuel passing through the reactor at the
instant before the scram carried the last group of
delayed neutron emitters produced at power. This
phenomenon was particularly pronounced at the
time the photograph of Fig. 6.17 was taken because
it was at that time that an experiment! was under
way in which the reactor was allowed to rise from
1-w power to a predetermined power level of from
50 to 100 w on a constant period before it was
scrammed. At the instant of scram the power of.the
reactor was 100 w, whereas one transit time previ-
ously (47 sec) the power was only about 14 w. As
a result, immediately after the scram the delayed
neutrons were particularly intense in the slug of
fuel which was in the reactor at the time of the
scram. The transit time of 47 sec is comparable
to the 56-sec group of delayed neutrons.'4 As
this slug traversed the system and went back
through the reactor, the delayed neutron emitters
gave rise to neutron multiplication within the re-
actor and, at the same time, the associated gamma
rays fell on the beryllium of the moderator and
gave rise to more neutrons by the reaction

Be’ + y — Be? + n

The total effect of both types of reactions was
to give a strong multiplication every 47 sec. During
the first pip shown in Fig. 6.17, the flux rose by
a factor of 2; with succeeding pips, the multipli-
cation became less. The average mean decay time
of the first four pips was 72 sec. For the two
longest lived groups of delayed neutrons the mean
lives are 32 and 80 sec.'4 Therefore, the attenu-
ation of the pips closely followed the theoretical
delayed neutron decay. A remarkable feature of
Fig. 6.17 is that the pips could be distinguished
for about 12 min. Since after the first 3 or 4 min
the delayed neutron emitters were gone, the re-
maining effect was due solely to photoneutrons.

The scram behavior at high power was very
similar, as observed with the use of the safety
chambers. The fission chambers could not be
used at high power, and therefore the first few
seconds after a scram could not be observed with
them.

by the periods induced by rod motion (cf., chap. 4).

FINAL OPERATION AND SHUTDOWN

The last scheduled experiment conducted on the
reactor was the measurement of the xenon buildup
following the 25-hr run at 2.12 Mw. The 10-hr
period of operation at one-tenth full power was
concluded at 0835 on November 12. During the
following 110 -hr period from 0835 to 2004, when
the reactor was shut down the final time, the oper-
ation of the reactor was demonstrated for Air Force
and ANP personnel who were gathered for the
quarterly ORNL-ANP Information Meeting. The
demonstrations included repeated cycling of the
load by turning the blowers on and off, and group
movement of the three shim rods to change the
reactor mean temperature. The information ob-
tained during this time on” the dynamic behavior of
the reactor is described above under the subtitle
**Reactor Kinetics.’

Also during the final 11}-hr period of operation,
two complete surveys of system temperatures were
taken with the reactor at maximum power. lt was
during one of these runs that the equilibrium fuel
outlet temperature of 1580°F and the total reactor
power of 2.45 Mw was attained (cf., App. L).

Since all operational objectives of the experiment
had been attained and it was estimated on the
basis of time and the assumed reactor power that
the desired integrated power of 100 Mwhr would be
attained by 2000 on Friday, November 12, it was
decided to terminate the experiment at that time.
Colonel Clyde D. Gasser, Chief, Nuclear Powered
Aircraft Branch of WADC, who was then visiting
the Laboratory, was invited to officiate at the

termination of the experiment. At 8:04 PM on
November 12, with Colonel Gasser at the controls,
the reactor was scrammed for the last time and the
operation of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment was
brought to a close. A photograph taken in the con-
trol room at that time is shown as Fig. 6.18.

At the time the experiment was terminated it was
believed that the total integrated power was more
than the 100 Mwhr which had been prescribed as
a nominal experimental objective, but subsequent
graphical integration of the Log N charts, Ap-
pendix R, revealed that the actual total integrated
power was about 96 Mwhr. At the time the reactor
was scrammed the sodium system had been in
operation (circulating sodium) for 635.2 hr and the
fluoride system for 462.2 hr. Of this total fluoride
circulating time 220.7 hr were obtained with the
reactor critical and 73.8 hr after the reactor was
first brought to power.

Although the nuclear operation was concluded
on Friday evening, the fuel and sodium were per-
mitted to circulate until the following morning, at
which time they were dumped into their respective
dump tanks. The final phase of the experiment,
including the dumping operation, subsequent analy-
sis and recovery of the fuel, and examination of
the systems and components for corrosion, wear,
radiation damage, etc., are to be discussed in a
subsequent report. Since much of the data cannot
conveniently be obtained until the radioactivity
has decayed, the last report will not be forthcoming
immediately.

7. RECOMMENDATIONS

No comprehensive report is complete without
conclusions, discussion, and recommendations. In
this report the conclusions are presented in the
summary at the beginning, and the discussion is
incorporated in the text and, especially, in the
Appendixes. Furthermore, certain alterations and
modifications that would have been desirable in
the conduct of the experiment are implicit in the
discussions throughout the report. However, the
changes, if effected for any similar future ex-
periments, could lead to substantial improvements
in design, instrumentation, operation, ~ad interpre-
tation. Accordingly, a list of recommendations
based on the ARE experience is presented; no
significance is inferred by the order of listing.

1. The operating crew should maintain the same
shift schedule as the craft labor — electricians,
instrument mechanics, pipe fitters, etc. — assigned
to the operating crew, and all members of one crew
should have their off-day at the same time. In
particular, there should be four operating crews
that maintain the same rotating schedule as the
rest of the plant.

2. The cause of the obvious discrepancy between
the temperatures read by the line thermocouples
close to the reactor and those further removed
from the reactor should be ascertained. No physi-
cal phenomena, with the possible exception of
radiation, have been proposed, to date, which could
account for the observed difference.

3. In order to measure the extracted reactor
power from the secondary or tertiary heat transfer
mediums, these systems should be adequately
instrumented for flow rates and temperatures.
Such instrumentation might also make possible
a thermodynamic analysis of the performance of
the various heat exchangers.

4. Thermocouples on the outer surface of fuel
and sodium tubes in the heat exchangers should be
installed so that they read wall temperatures rather
than an infermediate gas temperature.

5. Of the two thermocouples which were required
to measure the reactor mean temperature and the
two required to measure the temperature gradient,
one was electrically insulated from the pipe wall.
The insulation effected a time lag between the
wall and thermocouple temperatures of about
15 sec. Thermocouple installations for obtaining
time-dependent data should be made so that the
wall temperature can be read without a time lag.

6. To heat small (up to % in. OD) lines and
associated valves, tanks, etc. to uniform high
temperatures (~1400°F) requires a surprising
degree of precision in the installation of both
heaters and insulation. Furthermore, where calrod
heaters are employed, they should be installed on
opposite sides of a line, and the heaters and line
should be jointly wrapped with heat shielding
before insulation is applied.

7. To control accurately the temperature of any
system, thermocouples should be installed at
any discontinuity of either the heaters (i.e.,
between adjacent heaters) or the system (i.e., at
the junction of two lines, etc.), and, with the
exception of obviously identical installations,
each heater should have its own control.

8. Where gas lines are subject to plugging due
to the condensation of vapor from the liquid in the
system to which the lines are connected, it is
necessary either to heat the lines to above the
freezing point of the vapor or to employ a vapor
trap. While a vapor trap proved satisfactory in
preventing the fuel off-gas line from plugging, it
was not possible to heat the sodium off-gas line
sufficiently (because of temperature limitation of
the valves) to prevent the gradual formation of a
restriction. Gas valves that can be operated at
higher temperatures and are compatible with
sodium are needed.

9. The double-walled piping added a degree of
complexity fo the system that was far out of pro-
portion to the benefits derived from the helium
annulus. Parts of the annulus were at subatmos-
pheric pressure, and no leak tests were made on
the fuel system once it was filled with the fluoride
mixture. The helium flow was not needed for
distributing heat in the sodium system, and it was
of uncertain value in the fuel system. Conse-
quently, future systems should not include such
an annulus.

10. The use of any type of connection other
than an inert-arc-welded joint in any but the most
temporary fuel or sodium line should be avoided.

11. All joints, connections, and fittings in the
off-gas system should be welded, and, in general,
they should be assembled with the same meticulous
care that characterized the fabrication of the fuel
and sodium systems in order to minimize the pos-
sibility of the unintentional release of fission
gases.

12. As a secondary defense in the event of the
release of activity in the reactor cell (i.e., pit),
the cell should be leaktight. The leak-tightness of
the numerous bulkheads out of such a cell should
be carefully checked.

13. The air intake to the control room was lo-
cated on the roof of the building, and thus adverse
meteorological conditions readily introduced off-
gas activity into the control room. With an airtight
control room equipped with its own air supply (or
a remotely located filtered intake), the control room
operations could continue without concern for the
inhalation of gaseous activity.

14. The off-gas monitrons should be shielded
from direct radiation. Furthermore, although these
monitrons were not needed during the experiment,
they are known to build up background activity
which would eventually mask that of the gas they
are to measure. The development of monitrons in
which activity will not accumulate is recommended.

15. The radiation level and the airborne activity
throughout the building were measured by monitrons
and constant air monitors, respectively. The data
from both instruments should be continuously
recorded. Furthermore, the output of the air moni-
tors should be modified by the addition of a dif-
ferentiating circuit so that the recorded data would
give better measures of the airborne activity.

16. The helium ducts leaked to the extent that
it was possible to attain only a fraction of the
desired helium concentration therein. They were
of the conventional bolted-flange design and should
have been modified to permit seal welding of all
joints; they should be subjected to stringent leak
tests.

17. The helium consumption for the last three
and one-half months of the ARE experiment was
% million standard cubic feet (over 3000 standard
cylinders). The average consumption rate during
the last two weeks of the experiment was about
8.5 cfm, and peak consumption rates of 25 cfm were
recorded. This extraordinarily high helium con-
sumption could be reduced by the use of dry air
or nitrogen for much of the pneumatic instrumen-
tation in which helium was used.

18. Various valves in both the gas and liquid
systems leaked across the valve seats. The valve
development program should be emphasized until
valves are obtained that can be depended upon as
reliable components of high-temperature (~1200°F)

‘sodium, fluoride, or gas systems. Furthermore,

either limit switches that would operate at higher

98

temperatures to indicate valve open or closed
should be developed, or the existing limit switches
should be located in cooler regions.

19. The use of frangible disks to isolate the
standby fuel pump did not enhance the feasibility
of continuing the experiment in the event of the
failure of the main fuel pump during high-power
operation. The frangible disks are objected to in
that they require a nonreversible operation. In
general, leak-tight valves should be developed
that may be used rather thon the frangible disks.

20. Although the ARE, as designed, was to
incorporate numerous ‘‘freeze sections,’’ only two
were included in the system as finally constructed,
and the operability of these two was so question-
able thdt their use was not contemplated during
the course of the experiment. Such sections should
either be eliminated from consideration in future
systems, or a reliable freeze section should be
developed.

21. Much useful information would be obtained
if provisions could be made for sampling each
liquid system throughout the operation. This was
possible on the ARE only prior to the high-power
experiments.

22. The variable inductance-type flow and level
indicators should be converted to the null-balance
type of instruments in order to eliminate the
temperature dependence of the pickup coil signal.
Furthermore, these coils should be located in a
region at much less than 1000°F in order to in-
crease coil life.

23. Although numerous spark plug probes were
satisfactorily employed to measure levels in the
various tanks, the intermittent shorts that were
experienced with several sodium probes might
have been avoided if clearances between the
probe wire and the stand pipe in which the probes
were located had been greater.

24. The use of mercury alarm switches on
vibratory equipment where there is little leeway
between the operating and alarm condition will
give frequent faise alarms and should therefore be
avoided.

25. Weight instruments are of questionable
accuracy in a system in which the tank being
weighed is connected through numerous pipes to
a fixed system, especially when these pipes are
covered with heaters and insulation and are subject
to thermal expansion.

26. The flame photometer is an extremely sensi-
tive instrument for the detection of sodium and

NaK. However, in employing this instrument to
detect the presence of sodium (or NaK) in gas, the
sampling line should be heated to about 300°F.

27. The magnet faces in the shim rods should
be designed so that dirt particles cannot become
trapped thereon and thus require higher holding
currents.

28. The two control points, i.e., the upstairs
control room and the basement heater and instrument
panels, should have been more convenient to one
another in order to effect the greatest efficiency
of operation.

29. The communications system in the building
was inadequate. Except for the auxiliary FM
system, which was frequently inoperative, there
was only one phone in the control room, which
was on the main station of the PA system. How-
ever, the PA system was not capable of audibly
supporting two conversations at the same time.
Accordingly, the capacity of the PA system should
be increased so that as many as 4 or 5 conver-
sations may be simultaneously effected. Also,
more outlets should be provided both in the control
room and at other work areas in the building.

30. A megawatt-hour meter should be installed
(possibly on the log N or the AT recorder) in order
to provide a continuous measure of the integrated
power as the experiment progresses.

31. In order to analyze various related time-

dependent data (as required, for example, in the
determination of the various temperature coef-
ficients), it is necessary that the recorder charts
be marked at the start of the experiment. While
the charts can be marked by hand, this was a
source of error which became very important in the
analysis of data from fast transients. Accordingly,
all such charts should be periodically and simul-
taneously marked by an automatic stamper. Further-
more, each chart should be stamped with a dis-
tinctive mark that would positively identify it.

32. To analyze the kinetic behavior of a reactor
system it is necessary to have a recorder chart of
the time behavior of all equipment which can
introduce transients in the reactor, as well as
charts of the process data and conventional nuclear
data. Therefore the helium blower speeds and
shim rod positions should have been recorded
continually.

33. The recorded data and the data sheets
comprise a fairly comprehensive picture of the
experiment. However, even if all the data are
recorded they are of value only to the extent that
meaningful interpretations can be made. While
automatically marking the data charts will be
helpful, it will still be necessary to rely on log
book information which should be recorded in
great detail, possibly to the extent of making this
the only responsibility of a shift ‘‘historian.”

Appendix B
SUMMARY OF DESIGN AND OPERATIONAL DATA

This appendix tabulates both the design and operational data pertinent to the aircraft reactor experi-
ment. Most of the design data were extracted from two design memoranda, +2 although some values had to
be revised because of subsequent modifications in the design. In addition to the design data, the experi-
mental values of the various system parameters are included. All values obtained experimentally are
shown in italics and, for comparative purposes, are tabulated together with the corresponding design
values. There are, of course, numerous design numbers for which it was not possible to obtain experi-
mental numbers. The flow diagram of the experiment is presented in Fig, B.1. The values of temperature,
pressure, and flow given on this drawing are design values — not experimental values,

CONTROL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION AND OPERATION’

F. P. Green, Instrumentation and Controls Division

CONTROL SYSTEM DESIGN

The control system designed for the ARE had to
be able to maintain the reactor at any given power
and, when necessary, had to also be able to over-
come quickly the excess reactivity provided for
handling fuel depletion, fission-product poisons,
and power level increases. The motor speeds
and gear ratios were set so that safety-rod with-
drawal could not add Ak/k at a rate greater than
0.015%/sec. The rods were designed to contain
15% Ak/k, and the control system was designed to
limit the fast rate of regulating rod withdrawal to
be used for high-power operation to an equivalent
Ak/k of 0.1%/sec, with a maximum Ak/k of 0.40%,
which is one dollar, for steady-state fuel circu-
lation. For the critical experiment and low-power
operation, the regulating rod withdrawal rate was
limited to an equivalent Ak/k of 0.01%/sec.

A fundamental distinction was made between
insertion and withdrawal of the shim rods. Either
the operator or an automatic signal could insert
any number of rods at any time, whereas withdrawal
was always subject to both operator and interlock
permission. Withdrawal was limited, moreover, to
what was needed or safe under given circumstances.

Quantitative, rather than qualitative, indication
of control parameters was used where possible.
Where feasible, only one procedure of manual con-
trol was mechanically permitted to minimize time-
consuming arbitrary decisions on the operator’s
part.

The control philosophy of paramount importance
in the general operating dynamics was the use of
only absorber rods to control the nuclear process
and the use of only helium coolant to control the
power generation.

Most of the control and safety features of the
ARE were similar to those of other reactors. Con-
siderable care was exercised in the design of
instrument components, control rods, and control
circuits to make them as nearly fail-safe as was
practical. An instrumentation block diagram of
the reactor control system is shown in Fig. C.1,

This appendix was originally issued as ORNL CF-53-
5-238, ARE Control System Design Criteria, F. P. Green
(May 18, 1953), and was revised for this report on
March 7, 1955,

in which the reactor is shown to be subject to
effects of the control rods and to certain auxiliary
facilities. The reactor, in turn, affected certain
instruments which produced information that was
transmitted to the operator and to the control sys-
tem. The operator and the control system also
received information from indicators of rod position
and motion. By means of the operator's actions
and instrument signals, the control system trans-
mitted appropriate signals to the motors and
clutches. The actuators located over the reactor
pit in the actuator housing, in turn, affected the
reactor by corresponding rod motions which closed
the control loop. In addition to the above indi-
cations that were at the operator's disposal on
the console, there were many annunciators physi-
cally located along the top of the vertical board
in the control room. The group of eight annunci-
ators labeled “Nuclear Instruments’’ were provided
to indicate that conditions were improper for
raising the operating power level or that improper
operating procedures had caused safe limits to be
exceeded.

INSTRUMENTS DESCRIPTION

The reactor instruments discussed in the fol-
lowing have been arbitrarily limited to those di-
rectly concerned with the measurement of neutron
level and with fluid temperatures and flows associ-
ated with the reactor. The parallel-circular-plate
and compensated ion chambers, the fission cham-
bers, and BF, counter were of ORNL design,
and, except for the latter two, were identical to
those used in the MTR and LITR.? Since the
fission chambers were located in a high-tempera-
ture region within the reactor reflector, a special
chamber had to be developed that could be helium
cooled. The compensated ion chambers and the
log N and period meters had a useful range of
approximately 10%, and thus they indicated fluxes
of 10'% n/cm?.sec (maximum) and 104 n/cm?.sec
(minimum). The BF; counter had a maximum count-
ing rate of about 10° n/sec and the fission cham-
bers and count rate meters were capable of covering

a range of 10"! if they were withdrawn from the
reflector as the flux increased. Since the count
rate meter has a long integrating time and the
resultant time delays would make it an unsatis-
factory instrument for automatic control, it was
used as an adjunct to manual control.

The instantaneous positions of the four control
rods were reported to the operator by selsyns. In
addition, the positions of the rods with respect to
certain fixed mechanical limits were detected by
means of lever-operated microswitches. The limit-
switch signals tied in with the control system and
with signal lights on the control console. The
upper limit switches on the three shim rods oper-
ated when the rods were withdrawn to about 36 in.
from the fully inserted position. Their exact
location was adjusted to provide optimum sensi-
tivity of shim rod action. The lower limit switches
served to cut the rod drive circuits when the
magnet heads reached the magnet keepers.

The seat switches operated indicating lights on
the console, which served only to indicate the
proximity of the pneumatic shock absorber piston
to the lower spring shock absorber. The lights
told the operator the immediate effectiveness of a
*‘scrammed’’ or dropped rod and, hence, that the
rod had not jammed on its fall into the reactor
core.

The regulating rod was equipped with two travel
limit switches whose actions tied in intimately
with the manual and automatic regimes of the
servo-control system, which is described in o
following section.

Thermocouples were located at many points on
the reactor and the heat exchangers to monitor the
fuel temperatures, since temperature extremes or
low flow rates could have resulted in serious
damage to the reactor. The temperatures were
recorded, and electrical contacts in the recorders
interlocked with the scram circuit to provide shut-
down if the reactor inlet temperature dropped below
1100°F or the outlet temperature exceeded 1550°F.
The operator was also warned by an annunciator
alarm of low helium pressure in the rod-cooling
system because loss of cooling would have in-
creased the danger of a rod jamming due to me-
chanical deformation.

CONTROLS DESCRIPTION

Motion of the shim rods or the regulating rod was
obtained from two energy sources, gravitational

and electromechanical. Rod motion by safety

126

action was obtained by gravitational force upon
release of the shim rods from their holders as a
result of de-energizing the electromagnetic clutches.

The three shim rods, each ‘with its magnet, were
subject to a number of different possible sources
of safety signal. The necessary interconnecting
circuitry was centered about an ‘‘auction’’ or
*“sigma’’ bus. Instrument signals were fed to this
bus by sigma amplifiers. The sigma bus may be
said to go along with the ‘‘highest bidder’' among
the grid potentials of the sigma amplifiers. This
important auction effect allowed all rods to be
dropped by any one safety signal. If all three
amplifiers and the three magnets had been identi-
cal in adjustment and operation, all three rods
would have dropped simultaneously as the sigma
bus potential rose or fell past some critical valve.
Usually, only one of the rods dropped initially,
and the others were released by interlocked relay
action.

Two kinds of scrams were possible: “‘fast’
scrams caused by amplifier action and *‘slow"’
scrams caused by interruption of magnet power as
the result of the action of relays. In a fast scram
the shim rods were dropped when the reactor level
reached or exceeded a specified flux level, as
determined by the safety chambers. The signal
from the safety chambers was amplified by the
sigma amplifiers and subsequently caused the
magnet current to become low enough to drop the
rods. The slow scram was the actual interruption
of power to the magnet amplifiers by relay action.
This relay action could be caused by temperatures
in excess of safe limits or stoppage of fuel flow.

The shim rod drives were 3-wire, 115-v, instan-
taneously reversible, capacitor-run motors rated
at 1800 rpm. The shim-rod head, or actuator as-
sembly, was a worm gear driven through a gear
reducer at slightly less than 2, in./min. The
sequence of shim rod scram, rod pick-up, and with-
drawal required a minimum of 25 min.

Both individual and group activation of shim rods
were selected in preference to group control alone
to permit increased (vernier) flexibility in ap-
proaching criticality. Group shim rod action would
have made difficult the control of flux shading
throughout the reactor, particularly on rod insertion,
since, upon cutting the motor power, the friction
characteristics of the three drives would have
caused the rods to coast to different levels.

The regulating rod drive consisted of two Diehl
Manufacturing Company, 200-w, instantly reversible,

two-phase servomotors that operated from reversing
contactors which received their actuation from a
mixer-pilot relay located in the servo amplifier.
Only one of the motors operated at a time, de-
pending on whether the temperature or flux servo
was coupled into the control loop. For the flux
servo operation, an additional speed reducer was
used so that the speed of the rod was one tenth
that available for temperature servo operation.

Initiation of the flux servo ‘'auto’ regime was
contingent on reactor power great enough to give
a micromicroammeter reading of more than 20
and a servo-amplifier error signal small enough so
that no control rod correction was called for. With
the servo on auto the regulating rod upper or lower
limit switches actuated an annunciator. Although
not used in the experiment, initiation of the tem-
perature servo auto regime was contingent on
reactor power greater than a minimum controllable
power (>2% N _) and a servo-amplifier error signal
small enough that the servo would not call for rod
motion.

The rod-cooling system consisted of a closed
loop for circulating. helium through the annuli
around the shim rods, the regulating rod, and the
fission chambers and then through three parallel
helium-to-water heat exchangers. The helium was
circulated by two 15-hp a-c motor-driven positive-
displacement biowers. The motors were controlled
from the reactor operating console.

The fuel and reflector coolant temperatures were
also controlled from the console. The helium
coolant removed heat from fuel and sodium system
heat exchangers and passed it to an open-cycle
helium-to-water heat exchanger, from which the
water was dumped. The helium in the fuel system
was circulated by an electric-motor-driven fan that
was controlled from the console. The helium in
the sodium system was circulated by two hydraulic-
motor-driven blowers for which only the on and off
controls were located on the console.

In order that the reactor operation would be as
free as possible from the effects of transient
disturbances or outages on the purchased-power
lines, a separate electrical power supply was
available for the control system. The supply
consisted of a 250-v, 225-amp, storage-battery bank
of 2-hr capacity. The bank was charged during
normal power source operation by a 125-kw motor-
generator set. This emergency d-c¢ supply fed
emergency lights and a 25-kw motor-generator set
to supply instrumentation power (120/208 v, single

phase alternating current) during purchased-power
outages. An auto-transfer switch provided an
automatic switchover transient of several cycles
upon loss of the purchased-power source. The
auto-transfer switch automatically returned the
system to normal power 5 min after resumption of
purchased-power supply. The system could be
returned to normal power manually at any time after
resumption of the purchased-power supply.

CONSOLE AND CONTROL BOARD DESCRIPTION

The control console was made up of two large
panels, one to the right and one to the left of the
operator's chair, and eight subpanels directly in
front of the operator, Fig. C.2. Over the top of the
console, the operator also had a full view of the
vertical board of instruments which indicated and
recorded nuclear parameters and pertinent process
temperatures. The rotary General Electric Company
type SB-1 switches used were of the center-idle,
two- and three-position variety. They were wired
so that clockwise rotation produced an *‘increase’’
in the controlied parameter; such operation has
been described as potentially dangerous. However,
the scram switch, an exception, produced a scram
in either direction of rotation.

The top row of the left-hand panel of the console
contained the source-drive control (Fig. C.2). In
the second row the first two switches were the
controls for the two-speed rod-cooling helium
blowers, and the third switch was the on-off con-
trol for the electric motors which were the prime
movers for the hydraulic-motor-driven blowers. In
the bottom row were the group control for the three
shim rods and the annunciator acknowledge and
reset pushbuttons.

The center eight subpanels were identical in size
and shape and contained the six selsyns which
indicated the rod and fission chamber positions
and the two servo control assemblies. The temper-
ature calibrated potentiometer located near the
panel center was used to set the fuel mean temper-
ature for automatic, servo-controlled operation.
The subpanel on the extreme left contained the
flux vernier (not shown) used to set flux demand
into the flux servo system for controlled operation.
The dial was calibrated to correspond to a setting
of from 20 to 100 on the micromicroammeter Brown
recorder. Associated with all controls were the
necessary limits-of-travel indicating lights, along
with the on-off and speed-range indicators.

The right-hand panel contained the switches most

closely associated with the fuel system and the
energy removal controls. In the upper row were
the switch for the fuel-loop helium-blower prime
mover, which was a 50-hp electric motor, the scram
switch, and the by-pass switch (not shown on
Fig. C.2). The by-pass switch was provided to
permit the fuel-loop prime mover to be run, even

* though the reactor power was low, to remove the

afterheat that was expected to be present after a
shutdown. The bottom row on the right-hand panel
contained the fuel-system-helium blower speed
control, the selector switch for barrier-door control,
and the barrier-door drive control.

The four panels in the center of the vertical
board contained the 12 recorders which pertained
to the reactor. They were, left to right, top row:
reactor inlet temperature, reactor AT, reactor out-
let temperature, reactor mean temperature; center
row: count rate No. 1, pile period, safety level
No. 1, and micromicroammeter. In the bottom row
there were: count rate No. 2, log N, safety level
No. 2, and control rod position.

The range of flux through which the reactor
passed from the insertion of the source to full-
power operation was so great, more than 10'3, that

several classes of instruments were used,
The normal flux (Np) was arbitrarily desig-
nated as 1, and then the first, and lowest, range
encountered was the source range, from somewhat
less than 10='3 to 10~''; the second was the
counter range, from 10~'! to 10~%; the third was
the period range, from 10~¢ to 3.3 times 1073, and
the last was the power range, from 3.3 x 10~3 to 1.
At greater than 10=3, in the period range, the servo
system could be put into auto operation if desired.

CONTROL OPERATIONS

In the operation of the ARE, operator initiative
was overridden by two categories of rod-inserting
action: scram, the dropping of safety rods; and
reverse, the simultaneous continuous insertion of
all three shim rods, which was operative only
during startup, The fast scram was in a class by
itself, being the ultimate safety protection of the
reactor, and could never be vetoed by the operator.
The various occasions for automatic rod insertion
and annunciation for nuclear trouble are listed in
Table C.1.

There were five interlocks between nuclear re-
actor control, fuel and moderator coolant pumping,

and helium-cooling operation. (1) When operating
at power (above 10 kw), loss of fuel flow would
have initiated a slow scram. (2) Loss of fuel flow
would have, likewise, removed a permissive on
operation of the fuel-loop helium-blower prime
mover. (3) Excessive deviation of fuel temperature
from set point would have produced a scram for
either too high or too low a temperature. Low fuel
temperature would also cause the helium pilot
motor to run the magnetic clutch control for the
helium blowers to the zero position and thereby
stop the blowers and thus stop fuel cooling. (4)
Moderator coolant flow was interlocked with the
moderator coolant helium blowers to prevent helium
circulation when the sodium fiow was low or
stopped. A slug of cold sodium would have entered
the reactor when circulation was restarted if this
precaution had not been taken. (5) Permissives on
increasing helium flow were fuel temperature in

range, and power greater than 10 kw. The operator
was notified by the ‘permit’ light when these
conditions were satisfied. A pilot decrease was
not interruptible by the operator until the cause of
the automatic action was alleviated.

The elementary control diagram is shown in Fig.
C.3. The vdrious relay and limit switches referred
to in Fig. C.3 are described in Tables C.2 and
C.3, respectively. These tables and Fig. C.3 show
the procedural features of the control system as it
applied to operator initiative. This system was
divided into channels, each consisting of one or
more relays actuated by the operator subsequent
to properly setting up interlock permissives. The
interlocks often depended upon the aspects of
relays in other channels. Primarily, the channels
corresponded to a mechanical unit involving a rod
control, a process loop control, or an instrument
system control. The channels were:

than 103 Nf; or one count rate meter be ‘‘on scale.’

3. Slow scram
a. A series-parallel relay system was used to initiate a scram. This system was used because

a large number of series contacts would have been inducive to false drop-outs and hence

 

false scrams. The three most urgent criteria calling for scram had to be fail-safe and were
therefore placed in the series-connected section.

during normal critical and power operation. Low fuel temperature interlocks automati- 4

cally decreased the corresponding helium pilot controls if the fuel dropped below the t

critical temperature at either of the two heat exchangers. ¥

9. The by-pass switch function was somewhat obscure since it occurred in the prime movers, pilot i

controls, and reverse circuits. Its inclusion resulted from the possibility of requiring additional :

fuel cooling following a shutdown and after an extensive running period at power level. A *

large gamma heat source, primarily in the moderator (because of its very large heat capacity), !

called the afterheat, remained in the reactor immediately following power operation. *

By using both hands, the operator could throw and hold $5 on by-pass while he restarted the *

prime movers and subsequently increased the helium pilot controls to such a point that the = f

REACTOR OPERATION

The preliminary operating plan for the ARE was
described in ORNL-1844.4 In the check operations,
considerable time was spent in loading the inert
fuel carrier and in the subsequent shakedown run.
Critical loading, subcritical measurement of fuel
temperature coefficient, regulating rod calibration,
zero-power operation at 1200 to 1300°F, and power
operation are described in Appendix D.

In the starting of a freshly loaded reactor the
operator is most concerned about a reliable neutron
signal. Attention must therefore be given to as-
suring that the fission chambers are in their most
sensitive positions, and that they are giving a
readable signal on the scalers or count rate meters.
it is imperative that the source be inserted for the
earliest indication of subcritical multiplication to
be seen during the first startup. Use of the source
in subsequent experiments becomes less important
as the history of the reactor operation builds up.

For a normal, intentional shutdown the operator
had the choi¢e of a variety of procedures. For
every scram, however, the interlocks of the system
were such that the helium flow in the fuel-to-helium
heat exchangers was cut off by opening the electri-
cal circuits of the motors. This action was neces-
sary to prevent the fuel from freezing in the heat
exchangers. The various slow scrams included
the following: (1) maximum reactor outlet temper-
ature, . (2) minimum reactor inlet temperature, (3) a
l-sec period, (4) N greater than 3.0 Mw, (5) fuel
flow below 20 gpm. A 5-sec peried inserted the
shim rods, which decreased Ak/k at a rate of
0.015%/sgc, and operated only during low-level
startup.

In addition to the process signals which initiated
slow scrams, there were several other potential
process malfunctions for which it might have been
desirable to scram the reactor. However, the
action to be taken in these situations was left up
to the decision of the operator. There were two
reasons for not putting these process malfunctions

periment, ORNL-1844 (to be published).

 

on automatic scram. First, sensory signals usually
lag the event to such an extent that a fast scram
cannot provide better protection than a delayed
scram. Second, reaction to the signals requires
limited judgment. An annunciator alarm signal
was provided to draw the operator's attention to
the possible difficulty for each case that would
have required limited judgment. The cases were
the following: (1) pronounced changes in differential
temperatures between reactor outlet tubes, (2)
lowering level in any surge tank, (3) rising level
in any surge tank, (4) alarm from a pit radiation
monitor or monitron, (5) high oxygen concentration
or humidity in the pits.

The operation of placing the ‘‘position’’-type
regulating rod servo system on automatic control
in any part of the power range above 2% N, for
temperature servo, and a micromicroammeter re-
corder reading of greater than 20 on any scale, for
flux servo, was arranged to require that the reactor
to be on a stable, infinite period. In the normal
course of events, the rod should have been manually
set at mid-range. Six d-c voltage signals were fed
into the servo amplifier, three from the servo ion
chamber, inlet temperature recorder, and outlet
temperature recorder, one from the voltage supply
adjusted by the ‘'temperature demand’’ potentiome-
ter, and two from the flux demand and micromicro-
ammeter recorders. The operator therefore had a
unique temperature setting for each level of power
operation that produced ‘‘zero error’’ in the ampli-
fier output, and hence no ‘‘error’’-light indications
and no demand for rod movement. It was at this
setting that the servo ‘‘auto’’ regime could be
initiated. A small change in reactor mean temper-
ature or flux level could be effected in the auto
regime by resetting the temperature demand or flux
demand potentiometers, but the power level could
not be changed.

No clear line could be drawn between normal
operation and operation under difficulty. A few of
the situations in which the operator would have
expected to feel more than average need for atten-
tion to instrument signals and control actions were
loss or interruption of power, automatic shutdown

action, and buildup of xenon poison after a
shutdown,

As far as loss of power is concerned, the operator
would have been left figuratively, and nearly
literally, in the dark were the instrument bus and
control bus to go dead simultaneously. In this
very unlikely occurrence, all the instrument lights
and all relay-indicating lights would have been
out, leaving the operator without visual knowledge
of whether the scram (automatic on loss of power)

142

was effective. If he had reasonable faith in the
law of gravity, he would probably have remained at
his post until power was restored. There would
have been no normal scram indication if the relay
cabinet main fuse were to have opened. However,
since the amplifier power cabinet would have
operated from emergency power, there was a check
on release of the shim rods in the fact that the
magnet currents would have been interrupted.
Whenever the reactor was subject to automatic

shutdown action, the operator's concern was di-
vided between the causative effects and the
chances of returning the reactor to normal oper-
ation. The circuits prevented the operator from
interfering with shutdown actions as long as the
causative conditions remained. Hence the oper-
ator’s reaction to anything less drastic than a
scram was to clear the responsible condition.

When the reactor was scrammed, the chances of
getting back into normal operation were of course
dependent upon the time history of previous oper-
ation as well as upon the need for remedying the
trouble. However, any length of complete shutdown
could have been tolerated after prolonged operation
at normal flux, since xenon poison buildup was
low.

Appendix D
NUCLEAR OPERATING PROCEDURES!

The importance and critical nature of the program, as well as the short time scheduled for the

operation of the reactor and system, necessitated a tight experimental program and precise

operating procedures. The nuclear operating procedures were, of course, prescribed in advance

of the experiment, It is of considerable interest to note that the actual experimental program

followed the anticipated program very closely throughout, The only significant deviations were

the inclusion of some additional experiments as time permitted, The following appendix is a

verbatim copy of the procedures by which the reaclor was operated, Some minor discrepancies

in operating conditions (i.e., 34-gpm fuel flow vs 46.gpm actual flow) and procedures (i.e,, use

of the original enrichment system, which was replaced) will be noted.

It is anticipated that the reactor and its associ-
ated circuits will be operated for about 250 hr
with fused salts in the system prior to the intro-
duction of fuel. All process instrumentation and

components (non-nuclear) will be checked out
during this period. The mechanical operation of
the nuclear equipment will be checked out at

temperature. The safety rods will be raised and
dropped approximately 50 times during this period.

Several tests preliminary to the fuel loading
will have been run. The rated flow of the fuel
carrier will be 34 gpm at a mean temperature of
1300°F.

1. The fuel loading system will be operated with
carrier. The fuel storage tank will be installed
and carrier forced into the transfer tank and then
into the reactor system. The strain gage weighing
devices will be checked.

2. The helium blowers will be operated and the
resultant drop in mean temperature observed. The
operating crew will practice in handling the helium
flow so as to drop the mean temperature at a rate
of 10°F/min and at a rate of 25°F /min. Care will
be exercised not to drop the temperature of the
fuel carrier to below 1150°F as it leaves the heat
exchangers. As the latter temperature approaches
that value, the helium flow will be reduced and
the system brought back to its mean operating
temperature of 1300°F.

3. With the helium blowers off and starting with
fuel carrier at rated flow of 34 gpm and mean
temperature of 1300°F, the flow rate will be
decreased in steps to about one-third rated value.
All temperatures will be observed to note any
spurious changes caused by the decreased flow.

ADDITION OF FUEL CONCENTRATE?

The fuel concentrate will be added in batches
to an ‘‘eversafe’’ container which will contain
115 kg of U23%, The density of the fuel concen-

trate may be represented by the equation:
p (g/em3) = 5.51 = 0.0013 T (°C)

At a temperature of 1300°F, the density is
4.59 g/cm®, or 287 Ib/#t3. In each pound of the
fuel concentrate there is 0.556 Ib of U233,

One quart of the concentrate weighing 9.59 Ib
and containing 5.33 Ib of U233 will be forced into
the transfer tank and weighed. With the safety
rods completely withdrawn and the neutron source
and fission chambers inserted, the fuel concen-
trate will be forced into the fuel circuit, At this
time the carrier flow will be 34 gpm and the
concentrate and carrier temperatures will be
1300°F. The scram level on the safety chambers
will have been set at about 10 kw and the period
scram at 1 sec. A BF; counter will have been
installed temporarily in place of the neutron ion
chamber for the temperature servo control, and the
regulating rod will be on slow-speed drive.

The system volume up to the minimum operating
level in the fuel pump is calculated to be 4.64 3.
Assuming a critical mass of 30 Ib in the 1.3 ft3 of
reactor core, there will be approximately 124 Ib of
U235 in the fuel circuit when the reactor first goes
critical with the shim rods completely withdrawn.
Accordingly, it is anticipated that approximately
0.78 13 or 23.4 quarts of fuel concentrate must
be added for initial criticality. Twelve quarts will
be added in succession with the shim rods com-
pletely withdrawn and the fission chambers fully

was not employed, although the principles and tech-
niques of enrichment outlined here were followed.

inserted. After each quart of concentrate is added,
counts will be taken on both fission chambers and
the BF, counter. The reciprocal counting rate
will be plotted vs. the fuel concentration to ob-
serve the approach to criticality.

After 50% of the fuel concentrate (12 quarts) has
been added to the system, a sample of the mixed
fuel and carrier will be withdrawn for chemical
analysis.

SUBCRITICAL EXPERIMENTS

During the addition of the first 12 quarts of fuel
concentrate, the safety rods have been completely
withdrawn from the reactor. From here on, the shim
rods will be inserted approximately 25% while a
quart of fuel concentrate is being added. The shim
rods will then be withdrawn and a count taken on
the fission chambers as before. The shim rods

will be inserted and withdrawn in this fashion for
each succeeding fuel addition. The reciprocal of
the counting rate vs. fuel concentration will still
be plotted to indicate the increase in criticality.

When. approximately 90% of the critical mass has
been added, the fuel addition will be stopped and
several subcritical experiments performed. For
these experiments it is desired that the k£ of the
reactor be about 0.97 to 0.98. In Fig. D.1 is shown
the relationship between Ak/k and AM/M as a
function of the critical mass M. Using this curve,
an estimate of the point at which fuel addition
must be stopped can be made.

For the first experiment, the fuel temperature
will be decreased at a rate of 10°F /min by starting
the helium flow. Assuming a temperature coef-
ficient of ~5 x 10° (Ak/k)/°F, the resultant Ak/k
should be about 0.25% after 5 min. If AM/M is

approximately 4 Ak/k (Fig. D.1), the count rate
should increase by an amount corresponding to the
addition of 1.0% more fuel. If the change in count
rate is too small to be definite, the experiment
will be repeated at a rate of decrease of 25°F /min
until a definite increase in count rate is observed,
or until the temperature has been decreased 100°F,
If, after this decrease in temperature, no increase
in count rate is observed, it will be assumed that
the temperature coefficient is negligibly small and
the experiment will proceed. As has always been

0.008

the philosophy on the ARE, if the temperature
coefficient is observed to be positive, the experi-
ment will be concluded and the fuel circuit drained.

For the second experiment, the reactor tempera-
ture will be returned to its original value of
1300°F, and with the reactor containing 90% of
the critical mass, the fuel flow rate will be gradu-
ally decreased. If the available delayed neutron
fraction is 0.47% Ak at full flow and 0.75% Ak
when the flow is stopped (Fig. D.2), a Ak of
0.28% should appear. The count rate should in-

crease by an amount equivalent to the AM corre-
sponding to additional Ak in the delayed neutrons.
A rough experimental check on the calculated
value of the delayed neutron fraction will thus
be available.

During the period of subcritical operation, the
count rate will be carefully observed for sudden
changes that could be caused by fuel segregation.
No such difficulty is anticipated, but if such an
effect is observed, the reactor will be shut down
until the reason for such behavior is ascertained.

INITIAL CRITICALITY

Upon completion of the subcritical experiments,
the fuel flow and reactor temperature will be
returned to the initial conditions of 34 gpm? and
1300°F. Counts will be taken on the fission
chambers with the shim rods 25% inserted and
completely withdrawn. The shim rods will then
be 50% inserted and a quart of fuel concentrate
added. The rods will be withdrawn to 25% and
a count taken and then completely withdrawn and
a count taken. From here on, two curves of re-
ciprocal counting rate vs. fuel concentration will
be plotted, one at 25% rod insertion and the original
curve with the rods completely withdrawn. If the
reactor contained 90% of the critical mass during
the subcritical experiments, about two l-quart
additions of fuel concentrate will bring the reactor
critical with the rods completely withdrawn. The
last fuel additions will be made very slowly. When
criticality has been definitely reached, the reactor
will be shut down and a fuel sample taken for
chemical analysis.

After the sample has been taken, the reactor will
again be brought barely critical (a few hundredths
of a watt) and held at constant power by watching
the count rate meters. The gamma-ray dosage will
be measured with a ‘‘Cutie-pie’’ at all pertinent
points throughout the pits and recorded for future
reference on radiation damage and shielding.

ROD CALIBRATION vs FUEL ADDITION

The reactor will be brought critical at a very
low power and the shim rods adjusted so that the
regulating rod is 5 in. above center. The regu-
lating rod is estimated to be worth about 0.04%
Ak/in. One quart of fuel is approximately 4%
AM or 1% Ak (Fig. D.1). Therefore, % of a quart
should be worth about 1 in. of regulating rod.

3 Actual, 46 gpm.

Figures D.3 and D.4 show a calibration of a
regulating rod taken on a mockup of the ARE at
the Critical Experiment Facility. While it would
be fortuitous if the regulating rod in the actual
ARE gave the same calibration, it is expected
that the general shape of the curves will be the
same,

With the shim rods in a fixed position, the
regulating rod will be fully inserted and approxi-
mately Ys of a quart of fuel concentrate will be
added slowly to the system. The reactor will
be brought critical on the regulating rod and its
new position noted. This procedure will be
repeated until the regulating rod has been cali-
brated from 5 in, above to 5 in. below its mid-
position.

The above experiment will have been run with
the shim rods almost completely withdrawn. The
shims will now be inserted about 25% and % quart
of fuel added (approximately 0.5% Ak), The shim
rods will be withdrawn until the reactor goes
critical. This procedure will be continued to
give a rough calibration of shim rod position vs
fuel addition over one-fourth of the rod. When
the reactor is critical with the shims approximately
15% inserted, the shims will be adjusted so that
the regulating rod is 5 in. above center, and a
second calibration of the regulating rod vs fuel
addition will be run as above,

Calibration of the shim rods vs fuel addition
will then be continued until the reactor is critical
with the rods about 25% inserted. At this time,
a third and final calibration of the regulating
rod vs fuel addition will be run. The reactor will
then be shut down and a fuel sample taken.

LOW-POWER EXPERIMENTS

The nominal power of the reactor is obtained
as follows: It is estimated that in the reflector
at the mid-plane of the reactor the fission pro-
ducing flux is 2 x 10% nv/w, and the average flux
over the length of the fission chamber when fully
inserted is 1.5 x 10% nv/w. Preliminary tests
on the fission chambers show a counting efficiency
of approximately 0.14 counts/sec.nv. The re-
lationship between counting rate and power is
therefore approximately 2 x 10° counts/sec = 1 w.
The nominal power of the reactor will be based
on this relationship during the preceding experi-
ments,

Until this time the reactor has been operated
on the fission chambers alone at a nominal power

of about 0.01 w (about 2000 counts/sec). The
reactor power will now be increased to about
1 to 10 w, at which time the neutron ionization
chambers should begin to give readings on the
log N recorder, the micromicroammeter, and the
period recorder. The reactor will be leveled out
and the flux servo turned on. One of the fission
chambers will be completely withdrawn, which
should reduce its counting rate by several orders
of magnitude. A careful comparison of the new
count rate vs the old count rate will be made.

The reactor will be held at constant power for
exactly 1 hr and then scrammed. A fuel sample
will be drawn off and sent to the Bulk Shielding
Facility for determining its activity. This activity
will be compared with that of a previous sample
(Fig. D.5), which was exposed in a known neutron

148

flux in the Bulk Shielding Reactor. From the
comparison, the fission rate or absolute power
of the ARE will be determined for this run (cf.,
app. H). All neutron level instruments will be
calibrated accordingly.

Rod Calibration vs Period. A family of curves
of reactivity vs reactor period (inhour curves)
with the rate of flow of the fuel as a parameter
is shown in Fig. D.6.

With the fuel flow rate at 34 gpm, the servo will
be turned off and the reactor placed on infinite
period manually with the regulating rod at mid-
position. From the rod calibration vs fuel plot
and the theoretical inhour curve, the regulating
rod withdrawal for a 30-sec period will be esti-
mated (present estimate is about 1 in.). The rod
will be withdrawn accordingly and the neutron

level allowed to rise about two orders of magni-
tude, whereupon the regulating rod will be fully
inserted and the induced gamma rays allowed to
decay for about 20 min, The reactor will then
be brought back to its original power, as de-
termined by the fission chambers. If the position
of the regulating rod does not return to its original
value because of photoneutrons, the reactor power
will again be reduced by insertion of the regulating
rod until the photoneutron effect becomes negli-
gible, The above procedures will be repeated for
20-sec and 10-sec periods. The 10-sec period
should correspond roughly to a 2-in. withdrawal
of the regulating rod. Runs will then be made at
correspondingly longer periods until the period
for a Y%-in. withdrawal of the rod is obtained
(approximately 100 sec). At this time a repeat
run on the 30-sec period will be made to ascertain
whether photoneutron buildup is causing appreci-
able error in the measurements.

The shims will then be adjusted so that the

regulating rod is 1in. below center at infinite
period. The rod will be withdrawn 1 in. and the
period recorded. This procedure will be repeated
at successive starting positions of the regulating
rod 1in. apart from 5 in. below center to 5 in.
above. A check on the initial 30-sec run with
the rod withdrawn from the mid-position will be
made periodically to ensure that photoneutron
buildup is not interfering with the measurements.
From the standpoints of safety and experimental
convenience, the regulating rod should be worth
between 0.3% and 0.5% Ak for its full 12-in.
travel. If these experiments show that the value
of the rod is not in this range, a new rod will be
installed ot this time and the period calibration
repeated. |f convenient, a fuel sample will be
taken at this time.

Measurement of the Delayed Neutron Fraction.
The delayed neutron fraction for a stationary fuel
reactor is about 0.73%. For the ARE at a design
flow of 34 gpm, the fraction is calculated to be

0.47%, and for smaller flow rates, the corre-
sponding reactivity may be found from Fig. D.2.

Starting with the reactor stabilized at 34 gpm
and the flux servo on, the flow rate will gradually
be reduced. The calibrated regulating rod should
be inserted so as to indicate the same reactivity
as shown in Fig. D.2, This will give experimental
verification of the previously calculated inhour
curves, Fig. D.6.

Preliminary Measurements of Temperature Coef-
ficient. With the reactor held at 10 w by the flux
servo, the helium flow will be turned on so as to
drop the fuel temperature at a rate of 10°F /min.
As the mean reactor temperature drops, the servo
will insert the regulating rod so as to maintain
constant flux, and from the rod calibration, the
corresponding Ak can be obtained. Before the
rod has reached the limit of its travel, the helium

150

flow will be shut and the fuel allowed to return
to its original temperature. From the recordings
of rod position and mean temperature, a plot of
Ak vs mean temperature can be obtained. The
initial slope of this curve will correspond to the
fuel temperature coefficient. Because of the weak
signal received by the flux servo, this measure-
ment will be only approximate and is to be
repeated at higher power.

Depending upon how the reactor responds, the
procedure can be repeated by dropping the fuel
femperature at rates of up to 25°F /min. Care will
be taken not to drop the fuel temperature so low
as to set off the low-temperature scram.

REACTOR PERIOD (sec)

pits, sufficient fuel concentrate will be added to
the system so that 4% excess reactivity is avail-
able. This excess reactivity will be absorbed
with the shim rods. The shim rods will have a
rough calibration by this time, and it is expected
that they will be worth about 12% in excess
reactivity, Therefore, they will need to be in-
serted about one-third of their length, After
addition of the final amount of fuel concentrate
the liquid level in the pump will be checked to
ensure that at least 0.3 ft3 of volume remains for
expansion of the fuel. This expansion volume
will allow the fuel to expand isothermally from
1300 to 1600°F, which is well above the high-
temperature scram level. The final sample of fuel
will be taken for chemical analysis.

The reactor will now be shut down so that the
concrete block shields can be put over the pits
and the pits flooded with helium. The fuel storage
tank will first be removed and a final check on

all process equipment made. The BF, counter
will be removed and the temperature servo chamber
installed. The regulating rod will be put on fast
drive. A check list is being prepared of all items
to be reviewed before the pits are sealed.

If the temperature coefficient is of sufficient
magnitude to contro! the reactor, the flux servo
will be left in, However, if the magnitude of the
temperature coefficient is marginal, the flux servo
will be removed at this time and the temperature
servo connected.

After the pits have been sealed, the reactor will
be brought to a power of 1 kw and allowed to
stabilize. Up until this time all neutron ion
chambers have been fully inserted. The ion
chambers will be withdrawn slowly, one by one,
while the power level is being constantly moni-
tored with the fission chambers. The ion chambers
will be set for a maximum reading of around 5 Mw.

151

 

 
 

 

 

The safety chambers will be set to scram at the
same level.

The reactor is now ready for full power oper-
ation. The rod will be withdrawn and the reactor
put on about a 50-sec period. Somewhere in the
region from 10 to 100 kw a noticeable increase
in reactor period and an increase in reactor temper-
atures should be observed. The helium flow will
be started slowly and gradually increased until
a nominal power of 100 to 200 kw is reached
{AT from 25 to 50°F).

At this time, the reactor will be allowed to
stabilize for about % hr and all readings recorded.
lf the temperature coefficient is of insufficient
magnitude to stabilize the reactor, as determined
by previous measurements, the control of the
reactor will be turned over to the temperature
servo.

The power as determined from the heat extraction
by the helium will now be measured. The heat
capacity of the fuel is 0.23 Btu/Ib.°F and the
density of the fuel is represented by

0 (g/cm3) = 4.04 ~ 0.0011 T (°C) .

At a mean temperature of 1300°F, the average
density is 3.27 g/cm3. The power can be ex-
pressed as

p (kw) = 0.11 x AT (°F) x flow (gpm) .

Therefore at 34 gpm the power extracted by the
fuel is 3.74 kw/°F.

Having obtained a heat balance, the extraction
of heat from the fuel in the heat exchanger will
be increased until a power of about 500 kw
(AT = 134°F) is reached. Again the reactor will
be allowed to stabilize and the extracted power
measured. A third and final heat balance will be
made at a power of about 1 Mw (AT = 268°F).
This is close to the maximum power obtainable
without changing the initial conditions of 1300°F
mean reactor temperature and 34-gpm fuel flow.

During the preceding discussion, no mention has
been made of heat extraction other than in the
fuel circuit. An appreciable quantity of heat will
be removed by the sodium in the reflector coolant
circuit. Before the reactor goes to high power,
the sodium inlet and outlet temperatures will be
near the isothermal temperature of 1300°F. Since
there is some gamma heating in the reflector
region, it will be necessary to lower the inlet
temperature of the sodium by extracting heat with
the reflector coolant heat exchangers. The sodium
flow rate will be held at 224 gpm and the sodium

152

mean temperature at 1300°F., Since the heat
capacity of the sodium is 0.30 Btu/Ib-°F and its
specific gravity is 0.78, the power extracted by
the sodium will be 7.7 kw/°F. No more than 10%
of the power generated is expected to go into the
sodium,

EXPERIMENTS AT POWER

Measurement of the Temperature Coefficients.
After the reactor power has been calibrated, the
power will be reduced to about 500 kw and allowed
to stabilize. The flux servo will be turned on,
and by means of the helium demand the mean
temperature will be dropped at an initial rate of
10°F /min. (If the temperature servo is connected,
it will have to be replaced for this experiment.)
As discussed previously the initial slope of the
plot of Ak vs mean temperature will represent the
fuel temperature coefficient. Contrary to the
procedure at low power, however, the helium flow
will not be decreased after the temperature has
dropped. The reactor will be allowed to stabilize,
and, after about 30 min, the regulating rod will
have leveled out at a new position, and the reactor
will have assumed a new mean temperature. These
readings will represent the over-all reactor temper-
ature coefficient (fuel plus moderator). If, during
the above experiment, the servo inserts the rod
to its limit, it will be left at that position since
the temperature should stabilize the reactor.

If the fuel temperature coefficient is quite small,
the experiment can be repeated with an initial
rate of temperature decrease of 25°F /min. Care
will be taken that the reactor does not go on too
fast a period and that the low-temperature scram
limit is not exceeded.

Maximum Power Extraction. Except for specifi-
cally stated instances, the reactor has been
operated continuously up to this time at a mean
temperature of 1300°F and a fuel flow rate of
34 gpm. Under these conditions, the maximum
obtainable power is 1.1 Mw. At this power, the
reactor outlet temperature and the heat exchanger
inlet temperature are both’ 1450°F. The heat
exchanger outlet and the reactor inlet are both
at 1150°F. It is to be noted that when the heat
exchanger outlet temperature drops below 1150°F,
an alarm is sounded.

The mean reactor temperature will be elevated
from 1300 to 1325°F by a slight withdrawal of the
shim rods. The mean temperature of both fuel
and sodium will be held at this temperature. The
helium blower speed will now be increased until

a AT of nearly 350°F appears across the reactor.
With this AT, the reactor outlet and heat exchanger
inlet are at the upper limit of 1500°F, and the
heat exchanger outlet and reactor inlet are at the
lower limit of 1150°F. The power from the fuel
will be 1.3 Mw. At this time the pump speed can
be increased from 34 gpm to about 40 gpm, caution
being taken that the reactor inlet pressure does
not exceed 50 psig. The maximum AT across the
reactor will still be 350°F, and the power ex-
tracted in the fuel circuit will be 1.5 Mw. This
is the maximum power at which the reactor can
be operated.

Power Transients. With the reactor on manual
control and the regulating rod at mid-position, the
helium blower speed will be regulated until the
power in the fuel system is 1 Mw, and the reactor
will be allowed to stabilize. The helium flow
will be suddenly increased to its maximum and
the transient response of all tempercture and
nuclear recordings noted. The experiment can be
repeated from successively decreasing initial
powers of 500, 200, 100, 50, 20, and 10 kw. At
some level below 100 kw, the power cannot be
reduced further because the helium blowers will
be completely shut off. When this lower limit of
initial power has been reached, the series of
experiments will be concluded. If at any time
the reactor period gets too fast or the upper or
lower temperature limits are approached, the ex-
periments will be concluded.

Sudden Changes in Reactivity, The reactor will
be brought to a power of 1 Mw and allowed to
stabilize. From the previous calibration of the
regulating rod, the rod will be placed at a position
such that a complete withdrawal will give 10 cents
of excess reactivity. The rod will suddenly be
withdrawn and the transient response of the inlet
pressure and all nuclear and temperature recorders
noted. The experiment can be repeated with
sudden changes of 25, 50, 75, and 100 cents of
reactivity. If the fuel temperature coefficient has
a value of approximately -5 x 10~3, as expected,
a sudden change in reactivity of 100 cents should
be safe. However, if the experiments with smaller
reactivity changes indicate that such a large step
will be unsafe, this series of experiments will be
concluded. Otherwise, the experiment will be
repeated from initial powers of 100 kw, 10 kw, and
successively lower power levels.

Reactor Startup Using the Temperature Coef-
ficient, The reactor will be brought to 1 Mw of

power and the shims adjusted so that the regu-
lating rod is completely withdrawn. The helium
flow will be cut off and the reactor power allowed
to drop to its normal power with no heat extraction
(estimated to be between 10 and 100 kw). The
regulating rod will now be inserted by 0.1% of
reactivity and the reactor allowed to go subcritical
for about 10 min. After this time, helium flow
will gradually be increased. If the temperature
coefficient is -5 x 10~3, a drop in the mean
temperature of the reactor of 20°F will bring the
reactor critical again. As soon as a positive
period is noted, the helium cooling flow will be
held fixed and the reactor allowed to come up to
power and level out of its own accord.

The experiment can be repeated by driving the
reactor subcritical by 0.2, 0.3, and 0.4% with the
regulating rod. Care will be exercised not to
approach the upper or lower temperature limits,

Effect of Xenon Buildup. The change in re-
activity calculated from xenon buildup in the ARE
is shown in Fig. D.7. The reactivity as plotted
is nominal because of uncertainties in the xenon
cross sections and is probably a maximum. The
shape of the curves represents the change in
reactivity if no xenon is lost by off-gassing. The
reactor will be operated for 5 hr at full power,
and then reduced to 10% of full power. If no xenon
is lost, the reactivity should change as shown in
the lower curve of Fig. D.7. The reactor will
then be operated for 25 hr at full power, and
subsequently reduced to 10% power. Again if no
xenon is lost, the reactivity change should be
as shown in the upper curve of Fig. D.7. If some
xenon does off-gas, the shape of the curves will
be changed, and by proper analysis, an estimate
of the amount of off-gassing can be obtained.

At full power, the reactivity change will be
calculated from the change in reactor mean temper-
ature and the temperature coefficient. At 10%
power, the reactor will be put on flux servo and
the movement of the regulating rod will measure
the reactivity change. Since the moderator will
contain considerable heat when the power is
reduced, the mean reactor temperature will slowly
decrease during about the first Y hr after the
power is reduced to 10%. This will cause an
insertion of the regulating rod by the flux servo.
Since the xenon buildup will cause a withdrawal
of the regulating rod, a correction must be applied
for the effect of the drop in moderator temperature.

To obtain this correction experimentally, a
control experiment will be performed. The reactor
will be operated at full power for % to 1 hr and
the moderator allowed to come up to temperature.
During this short time, no appreciable xenon will

be formed. The reactor will then be reduced to
10% power and the flux servo turned on. The
reactivity change from the drop in moderator
temperature will be observed and used as a cor-
rection for the xenon buildup experiments.

MATHEMATICAL ANALYSIS OF APPROACH TO CRITICALITY
~ W. E. Kinney

When the ARE was brought to critical by suc-
cessive fuel additions, it was observed that the
usual plot of [1 — (1/multiplication constant)} vs
uranium concentration increased, at first, very
rapidly, but, when the curve got close to 1, the
rise was very slow, Qualitatively, such behavior
is observed in many reactors, but the ARE ex-
hibited the effect to an unusual degree. In order to
explain this, the ORACLE three-group, three-region
code was modified so that flux shapes at succes-
sive fuel additions could be calculated. Group
constants were obtained by flux weighting with
fluxes from an Eyewash calculation on the ARE,

Figure E.1 shows the space distribution of the
thermal flux for no fuel and for runs 2 through 6.

The effect of the reflector as fission neutrons be-
come more numerous can be seen, Figure E.2
compares experimental and calculated startup
curves for the fission chambers which were located
in the reflector as indicated in Fig. E.1. In the
calculation,

chamber, oy, is the fission cross section for group
i, and ¢, is the group i flux. For the ARE startup

where m is the multiplication constant, CR. is the
counting rate on run j, and CR is the counting

expected, rapid initial rise in the counting rate of
the fission chamber and the [1 ~ (1/m)] curve is
due not only to the general rise in flux level but

also to the formation of the thermal-flux maximum
near the fission chambers. Once the shape of
spatial distribution of the thermal-neutron flux is
set up, the fission chambers register only the
general increase in flux level and the count rate
increases slowly,

Appendix F
COLD, CLEAN CRITICAL MASS

The value of the cold, clean critical mass is of
interest in connection with any reactor, since it is
the calculation of this elusive number that takes
so much time during the design of the reactor and
system. The cold, clean critical mass may be
found by extrapolating the curve of uranium (Ib of
U235) in the core vs Ak/k (%) in the rods to the
point where there is no rod poisoning. On the
other hand, if the mass equivalent of the rod
poisoning is determined and deducted from that
then in the core, another curve may be obtained.
This curve gives corrected mass vs Ak/k (%) in
the rod and may also be extrapolated to 0% Ak/k
in the rods. Both these curves, as shown in
Fig. F.1, extrapolate to the same mass value at
0% Ak/k in the rods, which indicates that the rod
calibration was quite accurate and the data were
reliable. The value of the cold, clean critical
mass extrapolated from Fig. F.1 was 32.75 Ib of
y23s,

The data from which the curves in Fig, F.1 were
plotted are tabulated in Table F.1. The data used
to determine the cold, clean critical mass were
those obtained during the rod calibration from fuel
addition (Exp. L-2). This experiment and Exp. L-5,
rod calibration from reactor period, then provided
the information on the value of the regulating rod,
The values of the shim rods were taken from
Appendix J, ‘*Calibration of the Shim Rods.” The
Ak/k values in both regulating and shim rods were
then converted to their mass equivalents by using
the (Ak/k)/(AM/M) ratio of 0.236, as determined
experimentally, Three points listed in the table
and shown in the figure were derived by using the
first regulating rod, which was subsequently re-
placed because it was too ‘‘light.”” The calibra-

158

tion for that rod was not accurate, and, hence, the
three points were disregarded in extrapolating the
curves,

FLUX AND POWER DISTRIBUTIONS

A. D. Callihan

There were, of course, no measurements of the
flux or power distribution in the reactor during the
actual experiment. These distributions were
measured, however, on a zero power, critical mock-
up of the experimental reactor over a year earlier.
A detailed description of the critical mockup, in-
cluding the reactor parameters obtained therefrom,
may be found in ORNL-1634,1 The neutron flux
distributions obtained from indium and cadmium-
covered indium foil measurements, the fission

neutron flux distributions obtained by the catcher-

foil method, and the power distributions obtained
from aluminum catcher foils, which are of particular
interest, are presented here.

NEUTRON FLUX DISTRIBUTIONS

The neutron flux distributions were measured
with indium and cadmium-covered indium foils in a
number of runs in which a remotely placed uranium
disk and an aluminum catcher foil were used to
normalize the power from run to run, The results
of the bare indium and cadmium-covered indium
traverses made at a point 12,06 in, from the center
of the reactor are shown in Fig. G.1. The zero of
the abscissa is the bottom of the beryllium oxide

column where it rests on the l-in,-thick Inconel
support plate. The scattering by the Inconel
probably accounted for the reduction of the cad-
mium fraction at this point.

The radial flux traverse at the mid-plane of the
reactor with the regulating rod inserted is given in
Fig. G.2. The dashed lines on the figure are
activities extrapolated from the data obtained in
the fine-structure measurements made near the
11-in. position. The wide gap in this traverse was
unexplored because of the importance which was
attached to the study of a unit core cell in the
time available. This emphasis has been at least
partially contradicted by the fission flux traverse
described in the following section. The strong
effect of the center regulating rod assembly is
indicated in these curves. The comparatively
small flux and cadmium fraction depressions at

the center of the regulating rod accentuated the
relative inefficiency of this type of rod and guide
tube arrangement for reactor control. In another
measurement of the radial flux, this time with the
regulating rod withdrawn, the traverses were very
similar to that shown in Fig. G.2, but the neutron
flux was slightly greater (~8%).

FISSION-NEUTRON FLUX DISTRIBUTION

A measure of the distribution of neutrons that
caused fissions was obtained by using the catcher-
foil method in which the aluminum foil, together
with some uranium, was both bare and cadmium
covered. A radial traverse taken at the mid-plane
of the reactor is shown in Fig. G.3. The flux of
low-energy neutrons produced fission peaks near
the reflector and was depressed by the Inconel
tube (regulating rod sleeve) at the center. The

Similar half-length longitudinal traverses are shown
in Fig, G.4 for a position 10.09 in. from the center.

POWER DISTRIBUTION

Three longitudinal power distributions in this
reactor assembly were measured by using aluminum
catcher foils placed against the end surfaces of
the short, cast, fuel slugs contained in an Inconel
tube. The size of these foils was such that the
counting rate from each was higher than necessary
for the desired statistics. In the arbitrary units
reported, an activity of 50 represents approximately
105 counts. Had time permitted, it would have

been desirable to repeat the experiment with
smaller foils to improve the resolution, particularly
since the results were very sensitive to foil loca-
tion because of fuel self-shielding. Each catcher
foil was nominally located centrally on the axis
of a fuel slug. One traverse extended from below
the Inconel support plate to above the top of the
beryllium oxide; the other two covered the upper
half of the core. The data obtained in the fuel
tubes at the indicated radii are shown in Fig, G.5.
The data of Fig. G.5 are replotted in Fig. G.6 to
show the radial power distribution at several ele-
vations in the reactor, all normalized at the center,
It is to be noted that the 37.86-in. elevation traverse
is 2 in. above the top of the beryllium oxide column.

Appendix H
POWER DETERMINATION FROM FUEL ACTIVATION’
E. B. Johnson

Perhaps the most basic value obtained from the
operation of the ARE was the power level at which
it operated. This quantity was determined both
from activation of the fuel and from a heat balance.
The determination of reactor power from activation
of the fuel was based on the measurement of the
relative activity of samples of the fuel exposed in
the ARE and that exposed in a known flux in the
Bulk Shielding Reactor (BSR).

The activity of the aggregate of fission products
is not easy to predict because of the large number
of isotopes for which calculations would be re-
quired. For identical conditions of exposure and
decay, that is, for identical flux, exposure time,
and waiting period after exposure, the specific
activity should be the same, however. Further-
more, at fow fluxes the activity should be pro-
portional to the flux.

The ARE was operated at a nominal power level
of approximately 1 w for 1 hr, was then shut down,
and a sample of the irradiated fuel was withdrawn
for counting and analysis. Since the activity in
this fuel sample was too low to measure accurately,
the test was repeated at an estimated power of
10 w. The ARE experimental program then pro-
ceeded as scheduled. Decay curves were obtained
from the fuel samples from the ARE and were then
compared with the decay curve of a similar fuel
sample irradiated in the BSR in a known neutron
flux of about the same magnitude. From the re-
lative activity of the samples, a determination of
the power of the ARE was made.

THEORY

It has been shown? that the power (in watts)
produced in an enriched-fuel thermal reactor is

P = 4264 x 107" x nv, x G
where G is the number of grams of U23% in the

volume over which the average thermal-neutron flux
is nv, and the constant, 4.264 x 10-11, contains

This appendix was originally issued as ORNL

nation of the ARE, E. B. Johnson (July 31, 1954), and

the fission cross section, energy release per
fission, and the necessary conversion factors.
Obviously, if the thermal-neutron flux and the
amount of fuel present are known, it is quite simple
to obtain the power. The problem was to obtain
the power without measuring the flux in the ARE.

The quantity P/G obtained from the measurement
in the BSR will be called (P/G)g sr The decay
curve for the two fuel samples irradiated in
the BSR is shown in Fig. D.5 of Appendix D. The
power production in a given sample is proportional
to both the counting rate and the amount of fission-
able material in the sample. Thus,

 

(P/G) ne (CR/G) ng

CR = counting rate at time ¢ after shutdown,

The unperturbed thermal-neutron flux in which the

which recorded the neutron level (log N, etc.) were
then calibrated in terms of reactor power.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

The BSR is immersed in a pool of water which
serves as moderator, coolant, reflector, and shield.
Therefore, any material which is to be activated
in the BSR must be placed in a watertight container
before immersion in the pool. Capsules to contain
the ARE fuel were made of 2S aluminum with screw-
type caps and were sealed with a rubber gasket.
Each capsule contained approximately 1 g of ma-
terial; one of the capsules is shown in Fig. H.1.

Since it was desirable to irradiate the capsules
in the reactor core, the reactor was loaded with a
partial element, containing only half the usual
number of plates, in the interior of the lattice, as

which would fit inside this partial element and
support the capsule to be irradiated at approxi-
mately the vertical centerline of the element. Small
gold foils for measuring the thermal-neutron flux
were mounted in ‘‘drawers’’ adjacent to the cap-
sule, as shown in Fig. H.1. A monitoring foil was
placed on the bottom of the lucite block.

(No. 27).

Two samples of each of two ARE-type fuels of
different composition were irradiated. One (No.
44) contained 53.5-40.0-6.5 mole % of NaF- ZrF,-
UF, and was the anticipated fuel of the ARE. The
other was No. 45, which was the carrier to which
the uranium-containing fuel concentrate was added
during the critical and low-power experiments; it

contained 50-50 mole % of NaF-ZrF,.

it was necessary in the BSR to expose the
samples in the aluminum capsules; at the ARE the
fuel was, of course, first activated and then poured
into the capsules. Therefore it was necessary to
determine the contribution of the aluminum capsule

to the activity observed. Two empty capsules were
exposed (in separate runs) for 1 hr at a nominal
power level of 1 w. At the same time, gold foils
were exposed in the positions adjacent to the
capsule to determine the thermal flux. Similarly,
two carrier-filled capsules and two fuel-filled cap-
sules were irradiated, each separately but each
for 1 hr at 1 w. The capsules each contained 1 g
of material.

The decay curves token on each capsule were
made with two counters because of the difference
in disintegration rates between the empty and the

fluoride-filled capsules.

sules and for the carrier-filled capsules, and the
high-pressure ion chamber was used to measure
the activity in the fuel-fitled capsules. The data
for the carrier-filled capsules were converted, on
the assumption that all the activity was attributable
to sodium, to equivalent counting rates in the high-
pressure ion chamber. The assumption that the
activity was due to sodium was apparently valid,
since the decay curve indicated a half-life of about
15 hr at approximately 6 hr after shutdown.

It was found from the decay curves that the
aluminum activity was a factor of approximately
10 less than that of the carrier-filled capsules 3 hr
after shutdown and a factor of 450 less than that
of the fuel-filled capsules at the corresponding
time, and was therefore negligible. The activity
in the carrier-filled capsule was about 4% of that
in the fuel-filled capsule 6 hr after shutdown.
There was essentially no difference between the
two different fuel-filled capsules and the two dif-
ferent carrier-filled capsules. For this reason,
only one curve is shown for each in Fig. D.5.

The nuclear power of the Aircraft Reactor Experi-
ment was then set on the basis of the activation
in fuel samples irradiated for 1 hr at 10 w. This
power calibration was the basis of all power levels
indicated in the nuclear log up to the last day of
the experiment, by which time it had become obvi-
ous from the various heat balances that the actual
reactor power was considerably higher (app. L).
A comparison of the two methods of power cali-
bration is given in Appendix N.

INHOUR FORMULA FOR A CIRCULATING-FUEL REACTOR WITH SLUG FLOW!
W. K. Ergen

As pointed out in a previous paper,? the circu-
lating-fuel reactor differs in its dynamic behavior
from a reactor with stationary fuel, because fuel
circulation sweeps some of the delayed-neutron
precursors out of the reacting zone, and some
delayed neutrons are given off in locations where
they do not contribute to the chain reactions, One
of the consequences of these circumstances is the
fact that the inhour formula usually derived for
stationary-fuel reactors, requires some modifica-
tion before it becomes applicable to the circulating-
fuel reactor. The inhour formula gives the relation
between an excess multiplication factor, introduced
into the reactor, and the time constant T of the
resulting rise in reactor power. If the inhour
formula is known, then the easily measured time
constant can be used to determine the excess
multiplication factor, a procedure frequently used
in the quantitative evaluation of the various
arrangements causing excess reactivity, Further-
more, the proper design of control rods and their
drive mechanisms depends on the inhour formula.

Frequently, the experiments evaluating small
excess multiplication factors are carried out at
low reactor power, and the reactor power will then
not cause an increase in the reactor temperature.
This cose will be considered here. In this case,
the time dependence of the reactor power P can be
described by the following equation: 4

(1) dP/dt

= (1/7), - BP + Bf, Ds) P(t —s) ds] .

7 is the average lifetime of the prompt neutrons
and k_ the excess multiplication factor (or excess
reactivity). The meaning of 8 and D(s) for a

circulating-fuel reactor has been discussed in some
detail in ref. 2. We approximate in the following
the actual arrangement by a reactor for which the
power distribution and the importance of a neutron
are constant and for which all fuel elements have
the same transit time 6, — 6 through the outside
loop. In this approximation, 8 D(s) is simply the
probability that a fission neutron, caused by a
power burst at time zero, is a delayed neutron,
given off inside the reactor at a time between s
and s + ds. D{s) is normalized so that

(2) J, D(s)ds =1.

If the fuel is stationary, 8D(s) is the familiar curve
obtained by the superposition of 5 exponentials:

3) BD(s) = L BAe Eo

i=]

The A; are the decay constants of the 5 groups of
delayed neutrons, and the 3; are the probabilities
that a given fission neutron is a delayed neutron
of the ith group.

For the circulating-fuel reactor we first consider
the fuel which was present in the reactor at time
zero, At any time s, only a fraction of this fuel
will be found in the reactor. This fraction is
denoted by F(s), and by multiplying the right side
of (3) by F(s), we obtain the function BD{s) for
the circulating-fuel reactor.

Since 6, is the total time required by the fuel
to pass through a complete cycle, consisting of
the reactor and the outside loop, it is clear that

ats = nf,

(n =0,1,2...), F(s) is equal to 1;

at s

nf, + 0

(n = 0,1,2...), F(s) is equal to zero.

(We assume 0, 2 20 so that the fuel under con-
sideration has not started to re-enter the reactor
when the last of its elements leaves the reacting
zone.) Between s = nf, and s = nf, + 6, F(s)
decreases linearly, and hence has the value

(m0, +0 ~ s)/6. Ats =n, — O(n =1,23..),

F(s) is zero, but since the fuel under consideration re-enters the reactor between this moment and
s = n0,, F(s) increases linearly: F(s) = (s ~ nf; + 6)/6. For BD(s) we thus obtain:

In spite of the formidable appearance of Eqs. (5),
(6), and (7), it is easy to find, for any given 8 and
6,, the value of k_ which produces a given time
constant T,

Furthermore, the following reasoning describes
the general features of the equations. Consider
first the dependence of kon T. f T=, pp. =A,
and the sum on the right of (5) is equal to 3, k_,
is equal to zero. This corresponds to the state in
which the reactor is just critical. If T becomes
very small, the yu. become very large and in the
fraction on the right of (5) the numerator is domi-
nated by 4.0 and the bracket in the denominator by
1. Hence the fraction tends to zero like 0/1; as
T goes to zero. If 7 is very small, as it is in
practice, T will be small as soon as & , exceeds
£3 by a small amount. Then the complicated sum on
the right of (5) is of little importance, and T is
determined by 7/T = k,. — B, that is, the reactor
period is inversely proportional to the excess of
the reactivity over the reactivity corresponding to
the ‘‘prompt critical’ condition,

In the stationary-fuel reactor, the k_ which
makes the reactor prompt critical is given by 28.
With circulating fuel, the reactor is prompt critical
if k,, = B, which is less than ZB, that is, it
takes less excess reactivity to make the circulating-
fuel reactor prompt critical than to do the same
thing to a stationary-fuel reactor. This is physically
evident because the fuel circulation renders some
of the delayed neutrons ineffective. That § is
less than ZB; can also be verified mathematically.

For T intermediate between very small positive
values and +o, we consider again the analogy to
the stationary-fuel reactor. Here the inhour formula
reads:

T > Bi
k == —_—
(8) ex T * L V+ AT

For every positive k_ there is one, and only one,
positive time constant T, and vice versa, This is
a consequence of the fact that k_ is a monotonic
decreasing function of T, for if this monotony did
not exist, there could be several positive T values
corresponding to a given value of k_ , or vice
versa. In the circulating-fuel reactor the situation
is qualitatively the same; the fractions under the

sum in Eq. (5) are essentially of the form

x =~ 1 4e™™ =e (x 4 1) 4 e=(@=1x

 

%2[1 _ e=ax]
(x = #0 a = 6,/6) '

and an expression of this form can be shown to be
a monotonic decreasing function of positive x;6
the expression is thus a monotonic increasing
function of T [see Eq. (6)], and as T increases k_
decreases monotonically, according to Eq. (5);
for every positive k_ there is one, and only one,
positive T, and vice versa. This, of course, does
not preclude that there exists for a given k
several pegative T values, in addition to the one
positive value, Negative T correspond, however,
to decaying exponentials, which are of no im-
portance if the rise in power is observed for a
sufficiently long time.

Consider now the behavior of Eq. (5) with varia-
tion of 6, the transit time of the fuel through the
reactor, and of 6., the transit time of the fuel
through the whole loop. If 6 (and hence also 6)
is very large compared to all 1/A; and 1/y,, Eq.
(5) reduces to Eq. (8), the inhour formula for the
stationary-fuel reactor. The circulation is so slow
that the reactor behaves as if the fuel were sta-
tionary, inasmuch as cll delayed neutrons, even
the ones with the long-lived precursors, are given
off inside the reacting zone, before much fuel
reaches the outside. On the other hand, if 6, and,
hence, also 6, is small compared to all 1/A,, that
is, if the transit time of the fuel through the com-
plete loop is small compared to the mean life of
even the short-lived delayed-neutron precursors,

This is the same as the inhour formula for the

is physically easy to understand, since 6/6, is
just the probability that a given delayed neutron
is born inside the reactor,

Of interest is the intermediate case, in which 8

is smaller than the mean life of the long-lived
delayed-neutron precursors and larger than the
mean life of the short-lived precursors. In that
case, the long-delayed neutrons act approximately
according to Eq. (9) and are reduced by the factor
6/6,. On the other hand, the neutrons with the
short-lived precursors behave approximately like
Eq. (8) and are not appreciably reduced. Hence,
a small excess reactivity enables the reactor to

increase its power without ‘‘waiting’’ for the not

very abundant long-delayed neutrons. The reactor
goes to fairly short time constants with surprisingly
small excess reactivities. However, to make the
reactor prompt critical, that is, to enable it fo
exponentiate without even the little-delayed neu- -
trons, takes a substantial excess reactivity be-
cause of the almost undiminished amount of the
latter neutrons,

Appendix J
CALIBRATION OF THE SHIM RODS

Three essentially independent methods were
used to find the value of the shim rods in terms
of reactivity, The first method involved an
analysis of the counting rate data taken during the
critical experiment, and the second was a cali-
bration of shim rod No. 3 in terms of the regulating
rod. The agreement between these two methods
was very good. As a check on the general shape
of the reactivity curves as a function of rod
position, the rods were also calibrated by using
the fission chambers. The various methods are
discussed in detail below.

CALIBRATION FROM CRITICAL EXPERIMENT
DATA

After about one-half the critical mass of uranium
had been added to the system, the counting rates
of the two fission chambers and the BF_ counter
were taken as a function of shim rod position for
each subsequent fuel addition until criticality was
reached (as described in the main body of this
report, chap. 4). Because the fission chamber
counting rates were subject to the phenomenon
noted in Appendix H, only the BF, counter data
were used in the rod calibration.

From the BF, counting rates for each rod po-
sition taken after a given fuel injection, the
multiplication M was determined from the relation-
ship

M N
Ng !
where
N = counting rate for a given fuel concen-
tration and shim rod setting,
Ny = counting rate before start of enrichment,

For each value of M the value of the multiplication
factor k was determined:

1
E=1-—.
M
Figure 4.9 of Chapter 4 shows k plotted as a
function of the uranium in the system for rod
positions of 20, 25, 30, and 35 in.
The shim rod calibration was obtained from
Fig. 4.9 by first making a cross plot of & against
rod position at the critical mass, as shown in

172

Fig. J.1. Then, with this plot, a value of
(Ak/E)/in. was obtained for every l-in. movement
of the shim rods from no insertion to 16 in. of
insertion of the rods. A plot of (Ak/k)/in. as a
function of rod position is given in Fig. J.2, and
the data are tabulated in Table J.1.

In order to find the integrated reactivity, or total
worth of the rods, in terms of (Ak/k) as a function
of the number of inches of insertion, the curve
of Fig. J.2 was divided into three sections. Over
each section the curves were fitted to a formula
of the form

oa = Ad? + Bd + C ,

where a = (Ak/k)/in. The formula and its integral,
which were applied to the three sections of the
curve, are given in Table J.2. For each section,
then, the integrated reactivity was found by inte-
grating over the a curves. The integrated curves
were of the form

18 in. (see Appendix D, Fig. D.3), then the total
worth of a shim rod was 5.8% (Ak/k) and the total
worth of all three rods was about 17% (Ak/k).

CALIBRATION AGAINST THE REGULATING
ROD

In Exp. L-6, with the reactor at a power of
1 watt (nominal), shim rods Nos. 1 and 2 were
set at predetermined positions. Then shim rod
No. 3 was moved over various small increments
of its travel and thus calibrated against the regu-
lating rod. With the reactor on servo the regulating
rod then moved automatically a compensating
distance, this distance being roughly 10 in. of
its travel. From the previous measurement of the

worth of the regulating rod of (Ak/k)/in. of

174

0.033%/in. and the ratio of the movement of shim
rod No. 3 and the regulating rod, a calibration of
Ne. 3 shim rod was obtained over the first 14
inches of its travel (starting from the out position).

Figure J.2 shows the results of this method of
calibration (dashed curve), and the data are listed
in Table J.4. The agreement between the two
methods of calibration was surprisingly good.
Since the increments of shim rod movement were
larger in this method thdn in the preceding method
and since there were other sources of error, such
as the error in the movement of the shim rod
position indicators on the reactor console, no
attempt was made to use this curve (dashed curve,
Fig. J.2) to find the integrated value of Ak/k over
the rod.

CALIBRATION BY USING THE FISSION
CHAMBERS

A third calibration of the shim rods was at-
tempted during the critical experiments in which
the counting rate of the neutron detectors was
taken as a function of shim rod position for two
different uranium concentrations.

The reactivity was then obtained from the
counting rates by using the relationship

k=1-—,
M

and a plot of & as a function of rod position then
gave a check on the general shape of the curve.
Figure J.4 shows the & vs rod position for fission
chambers 1 and 2. Because the uranium concen-
tration in the system was low for both the runs
the fission chambers were showing a subcritical

Appendix K
CORRELATION OF REACTOR AND LINE TEMPERATURES

An effect which was noted late in the operation
of the ARE was that fuel and sodium line tempera-
tures indicated in the basement disagreed quite
radically with those recorded in the control room.
It so happened that all the basement indicators
gave line temperatures measured by thermocouples
outside the reactor thermal shield, while the
temperatures recorded in the control room were
measured by thermocouples all located within the
thermal shield, When this was first discovered it
was thought that helium from the rod-cooling system
blowing on the thermocouples inside the thermal
shield was making them read low. Turning the rod
cooling blowers on and off, however, was demon-
strated to have no effect on the thermocouples, and
therefore at the end of the experiment no positive
explanation for these temperature discrepancies
had been found.

This situation has created serious difficulties in
trying to analyze the data for this report. There
was evidence that the discrepancies were intensi-
fied during operation at high power. Nevertheless,
when nearly isothermal conditions existed, it was
found that the absolute magnitude of the measure-
ments made by the thermocouple within the thermal
shield were incorrect, but the rates of change
obtained from the data were correct. The tempera-
tures read on the basement instruments were
considered to be correct for several reasons, First,
the temperature indications available in the base-
ment were much more numerous than those in the
controlroom, and the thermocouple sensing elements
for these indicators were all located along lines
outside the thermal shield; the temperatures agreed
with each other to 110 deg from the average. Equi-
librium conditions prevailed across the pipes be-
cause of the insulation, Also, there were many
reasons for the thermocouples to indicate higher
than actual temperatures, but none for lower than
actual indications.

In order to use the temperature data from the
experiment it was necessary to correlate the tem-
perature data obtained in the control room with
those obtained in the basement. The correlations
were then used to correct temperature data ob-
tained in the control room.

The results of the temperature correlations for
the fuel system are shown in Figs. K.1, K.2, and
K.3. The agreement between the low-power line

180

temperatures (Fig. K.1) reflects the attention which
was given to calibrating these thermocouples in
the isothermal condition. The curves in Figs. K.2

the inlet and the outlet line temperature correla-

—40°F, respectively. This was probably the re-
sult of the long sodium inlet and outlet lines being
used as a convenient means of adding heat to the
system to maintain a thermal equilibrium in the
reactor of ~1300°F. Good data for the high-power

correlations, Figs. K.5 and K.6, were rather scarce,
but the curves shown are believed to be reasonable
approximations to the actual correlation. The
data in Fig. K.6 have been corrected for known
error in the temperature differential at zero (or low)
power. The correction, as applied, was to reduce
the value of the temperature differential determined
from the thermocouples outside the thermal shield
by 10°F.

All the correlations were based upon data which
were obtained during runs long enough for the
establishment of equilibrium conditions in the
system or at times when isothermal conditions
prevailed, The most important conclusion that can
be made from these data is that the temperature
differentials across the reactor in both the fuel
and sodium systems were about a factor of 2 low.
In the fuel system the outlet line temperature
changes read in the control room (inside pressure
shell temperatures) were only one-half as great cs
the corresponding temperature changes read in the

basement (outside pressure shell temperatures). In
the sodium system both outlet and inlet line tem-
perature curves had different intercepts but the
same slopes (as during the low-power runs),

All temperature data used in this report that
pertained to operation at high power were corrected
to agree with line temperatures obtained outside
the thermal shield (basement readings) by using
curves K.1 through K.6, Data from runs made
under isothermal or equilibrium conditions where
equal temperature differences were obtained on
instruments either in the control room or in the
basement needed no temperature corrections. The
temperature correlation data from which the curves
were obtained are presented in Tables K.1 and
K.2. Because of the lack of coordination between
the control room and basement operations during
the experiment, much potentially useful data had
to be discarded because the exact times of the
readings were not known or the data were taken
before equilibrium conditions were established.

This points out the need in future operations of the
scale of the ARE for some sort of timing device
that would automatically stamp the date and time
every few minutes on the charts of all recording

instruments,

and a more systematic method of

manually recording data for each experiment per-
formed in which conditions are held constant long
enough for all pertinent data to be recorded. These
and other similar recommendations will be found
in Chapter 7 of this report.

Appendix L
POWER DETERMINATION FROM HEAT EXTRACTION

The power level of the reactor was determined
from the total heat extracted by the fuel and the
sodium. Data for the heat extraction determination
were obtained from continuous records of the re-
actor fuel inlet, outlet, and mean temperatures,
the temperature differential across the reactor,
and the flow rates of the fuel and the sodium.
The flow rates could also be calculated from the
pump speed, and there was independent experi-
mental evidence from which a plot of speed vs
flow rate was obtained. The power level of the
reactor was calculated by use of heat capacities,
flow rates, and temperature differentials for both
sodium and fuel. It was found that the fuel and the
sodium accounted for 99% of the extraction of
power generated in the reactor. The data referred
to above were all obtainable in the control room.

The controls for preheating and maintaining heat
on the system were located in the basement, and
along with these controls were temperature re-
corders and indicators for the whole system, ex-
clusive of the reactor, The temperatures of both
fuel and sodium lines to and from the reactor were
also recorded in the basement, These basement
data were used for a separate power extraction
determination.

An independent source of power level information
was also available, since the fuel and sodium were
cooled by a helium stream flowing over a heat ex-
changer and the helium in turn was cooled by a
helium-to-water heat exchanger. No flow or tem-
perature measurements were made of the helium,
but since the water exchangers were very close to
the fuel or the sodium exchangers, all the heat that
was taken out of the fuel and sodium should have
appeared in the water. The water flow through
these exchangers was metered by orifice-type
flowmeters, and the outlet temperatures were meas-
The fuel loop
exchangers and the two sodium loop exchangers
were metered separately.

Up to the time of the 25-hr xenon run the reactor
was operated at high power for very short periods
of time, and the extracted power was determined
from the control room data. During the 25-hr xenon
run a comparison was made of the extracted power
determined from the control room data, that de-
termined from the basement data, and that from
the water data (Table L.1). Large discrepancies

ured by thermocouples in wells.

184

were found, and the indications were that the
control room data were low.

The disagreement of the various data led to the
examination of the inlet and outlet line tempera-
tures, as described in Appendix K. During the
xenon run the fuel outlet line temperatures were
about 100°F higher than the fuel outlet manifold
temperatures (control room data), and the fuel
inlet line temperatures (basement data) were
essentially the same as the fuel inlet manifold
temperatures (control room data). The sodium
outlet line temperature (basement data) was 60°F
higher than the sodium outlet temperature at the
reactor {control room data), (The only check on
power extraction by the rod cooling system, which
was only 1% of total power, was the water data
for the rod cooling helium-to-water heat exchanger.
In most discussions this 1% is neglected.)

The power extracted in both the fuel and the
sodium systems has been calculated by using
temperature data from several experiments, and the
results are presented in Table L.2. There were
three separate measurements of the fuel temperature
differential available in the control room which
were usually in fair agreement. The largest dis-
crepancy was, as mentioned, between the control
room data and the basement data, The temperature
differential obtained from the basement data was
an average result from a number of line thermo-
couples, while the control room data came from
thermocouples located on the fuel headers inside
the reactor thermal shield.

The so-called secondary heat balance was ob-
tained by determining the heat dumped by the water
from the various heat exchangers. These data are
tabulated in Table L.3 for the high-power experi-
ments,

The various estimates of reactor power from
both primary and secondary heat extraction are
then listed in Table L.4, together with the power
estimated from the calibration of the nuclear in.
struments, that is, the log N recorder and the micro-
microammeter, These latter instruments were
normalized to agree with the primary extracted
power as determined by the line temperature
(basement data) during the xenon experiment (H-11).
Equilibrium conditions were certainly attained
during this 25-hr experiment and such error as there
may be in using these data as the criteria for

shell; they were exposed to high nuclear radiation
fluxes, etc. These unique aspects immediately
suggest several possible explanations for the
erroneous temperature measurements. However,
upon further examination, each of these aspects,
with the dubious exception of nuclear radiation,
has been shown to be incapable of producing the
observed anomaly.

The control and shim rods and the fission
chambers were cooled by forced helium circulation
in the rod-cooling system. Part of the helium that
was blown down through the rod tubes was de-
flected back up across the outlet manifold and
between the pressure shell and the thermal shield.
While it was thought that perhaps this was cooling
the fuel outlet manifold thermocouples and making
them read low, this was disproved when changing
the speed of the blower or stopping it had no effect
on the fuel outlet temperature.

it was thought that possibly the heat radiation
from the fuel outlet manifold to the colder bottom
of the pressure shell was great enough to actually
lower the manifold wall temperatures 100°F below
the fluid temperature. This has been disproved by
heat transfer calculations. It was also thought that
since the outlet fuel lines passed through the
2-in. plenum chamber that the resulting surface
cooling of the fuel might account for the lower
wall temperatures, although the mixed mean fuel
temperature was considerably higher. This was
also disproved when no increase in wall tempera-
ture was observed for thermocouples within the
thermal shield but located progressively farther
away from the pressure shell bottom.

It is of interest that after the final shutdown of
the reactor, the fuel outlet line and fuel outlet
manifold temperatures agreed; in other words, with
no power generation the basement data and control
room data agreed,

~ Appendix M
THERMODYNAMIC ANALYSES

Some two years before the Aircraft Reactor Ex-
periment was placed in operation a comprehensive
report was written on the ‘‘Thermodynamic and
Heat Transfer Analysis of the Aircraft Reactor

Experiment.’

Not only was the design of the
reactor system based, in part, on the studies culmi-
nating in that report, but the material therein
served as a guide during the acceptance test of
the experiment. Therefore a comparison of the
calculated and the actual thermodynamic per-
formance of the reactor system was attempted. It
soon became apparent that the experimental data
of the type needed for thermodynamic analyses
were inadequate to permit a meaningful comparison
with any of the calculated situations. Perhaps the
most valid comparison may be made between the
calculated insulation losses, the heater power
input at equilibrium, and the heat removed by the
space coolers. Even here the agreement is less
than 50%. An illustration of the inefficacy of
attempting to calculate such thermodynamic con-
stants as the heat transfer coefficients of the fuel
and the sodium is presented below.

INSULATION LOSSES, HEATER POWER INPUT,
AND SPACE COOLER PERFORMANCE

At equilibrium the electrical heat required to
maintain the system at a mean temperature of
1325°F should have been equivalent to the heat
removed in the eight pit space coolers. The maxi-
mum amount of heat ever removed by the space
coolers was the 250 kw attained with 66.5-gpm-total
water flow with a temperature rise of 30°F. Al-
though this value agrees very well with calculated!
heat loss of 220 kw for the entire system (the
reported value of 240 kw was calculated for an
earlier design system and was reduced by about
20 kw for the actual system), the actual electrical
power input to the heaters averaged around 375 kw
after the system reached equilibrium,

There are several possible explanations for the
discrepancies betwaen the calculated heat loss,
the electrical power input, and the heat removed
by the space coolers. First, the calculated loss
was low because it assumed idealized conditions

and Heat Transfer Analysis of the Aircraft Reactor Ex-
periment, ORNL-1535 (Aug. 10, 1953).

188

and not the actual insulation which had cracks,
clips, etc. Second, the electrical heat load was
high, since it did not allow for transformer, variac,
and line losses. Also, the space cooler heat load
may not have represented an equilibrium condition
if the pit walls were still heating up and/or radi-
ating heat,

EXPERIMENTAL VALUES OF HEAT
TRANSFER COEFFICIENTS?

An attempt was made tocalculate both the sodium
and the fuel heat transfer coefficients from the
measured values of temperatures and flows in the
various heat transfer media, that is, fuel, sodium,
helium, water. These data are given in Table M.1
for a typical operating condition.

The desired heat transfer coefficient should be
determinable from the calculated values of the
various thermal resistances in the heat exchangers.
To obtain the thermal resistance on the fuel side
or the sodium side of the respective heat ex-
changers, the helium side and metal resistances
had to be subtracted from the over-all resistance.
The expression for the over-all resistance is

where

A = area across which heat is transferred,

A knowledge of the inlet and outlet temperatures
on the helium side of the heat exchanger is re-
quired by the above expression, and lack of this
information immediately introduces a large un-
certainty in the results, Of greater importance,
however, is the relative magnitude of the resist-
ances involved. The calculated ratio for the fuel-
to-helium exchanger is

tion can be extracted from the available data on

. COMPARISON OF REACTOR POWER DETERMINATIONS
W. K. Ergen

In order to get an estimate of the reactor power
and to be able to calibrate the instruments, the
ARE was run for 1 hr at a power which was esti-
mated, at the time, to be 10 watts (exp. L-4). A
sample of the fuel was then withdrawn and the
gamma activity was compared with that of a sample
which had been irradiated at a known power level
in the Bulk Shielding Reactor (BSR). This method
of power determination is discussed in Appendix H.

A curve showing the gamma counting rate of a
BSR-irradiated sample as a function of time after
shutdown had been obtained. The irradiation time
was 1 hr at a constant power of 1 w. From this
curve a decay curve corresponding to the actual
power history of the ARE was synthesized by
taking into account not only the ‘‘10-watt'’ run,
but also the previous lower power operation.

When this synthetic curve was compared with the
one obtained from measurements on the ARE sam-
ple, the shapes of the curves did not agree, the
ARE curve having a smaller slope than the syn-
thetic curve. Also, the power determired by this
method was lower than the power ultimately de-
termined by- the heat balance. Both these effects
can be explained in a qualitative manner by the
loss of some of the radioactive fission fragments
from the ARE sample. This would reduce the total
radioactivity of the sample and hence the apparent
power level. Furthermore, the loss of radioactive
fission fragments would reduce the counting rate
at short times after irradiation more than at long
times, because among the most volatile fission
fragments are the strong gamma emitters that have
relatively short half lives (notably, 2.77-hr Kr88),
This would flatten the slope of the decay curve
of the ARE sample.

it has not been possible so far to treat this
matter in a quantitative way, but in order to elimi-
nate some computational complications a sample
was irradiated in the BSR under conditions exactly
duplicating the power history of the ARE, except
for a proportionality factor. A comparison of the
decay curve of this sample and that of the ARE
sample is shown in Fig. N.1. The BSR sample
contained 0.1166 g of U235; the fission cross
section at the temperature of the BSR is 509 barns. !
The BSR power at the final 1-hr irradiation was

190

10 w, corresponding to a flux? of 1,7 x 108 n/cm?.sec,
and a self-shielding factor, estimated to be 0.8,
had to be applied to this sample. Hence, during
the 1-hr irradiation there were

0.1166 g x 0.6 x 1024 atoms/g-atom x 509
x 10~24 fissions/(atoms+n/cm?) x 1.7
x 108 n/cm2sec x 0.8/235 g/g-atom
20.6 x 10° fissions/sec .

it

The ARE sample contained 0.1177 g of U%3% and
the total U233 in the ARE at the time of the run
was 59.1 kg. The reactor power, as determined
later by the heat balance, was actually 27 w,
instead of the expected 10 w. Hence there were

27 w x 3.1 x 101° fissions/wesec x 0.1177 g
59,100 g

 

= 1.66 x 10% fissions/sec

in the ARE sample.

The ratio of the radioactivities of the BSR
sample and the ARE sample should thus have been
20.6/1.66 = 12.4. As may be seen from Fig. N.1,
the measured ratio is 27 at 1 hr 40 min, and 17.5
at 38Y, hr. As pointed out above, the discrepancy
can be explained by the loss of radioactive fission
fragments from the ARE sample.

A small amount of the radioactivity of either
sample was contributed by the capsule and the fuel
carrier, especially the sodium content of the
carrier. This was measured by irradiating a non-
uranium-bearing capsule with carrier, and counting
its radioactivity. However, since this correction
proved to be small and since both samples con-
tained about the same amount of uranium in the
same amount of carrier, the results would not be
appreciably affected.

Appendix 0
ANALYSIS OF TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT MEASUREMENTS

IMPORTANCE OF THE FUEL TEMPERATURE
COEFFICIENT

One of the most desirable features of a circu-
lating-fuel reactor is its inherent stability because
of the strong negative temperature coefficient of
reactivity. This was conclusively demonstrated
by the ARE. It had been predicted, on the basis
of the temperature dependence of the density,
which was

p (g/ecm®) = 3.98 — 0.00093T (°F)

for the final fuel concentration in the reactor, that
the ARE fuel would have a negative temperature
coefficient of sizable magnitude. At the operating
temperature of 1300°F the fuel density was 3.33
a/em3. The resulting mass reactivity coefficient
was

Co 0.00052

(AM/M)/F = = ———= ~1.56 x 1074/°F ,

3.33

and, for Ak/k = 0.236 AM/M, the predicted temper-
ature coefficient that would result from the changing
density of the fuel alone was

(AR/E)/PF = ~3.68 x 10~5/°F

Actually, as was stated in the body of this report
(cf., Fig. 6.4), the fuel temperature coefficient was
~9.8 x 10~3/°F.

As long as the over-all temperature coefficient
of a reactor is negative, the reactor will be a slave
to the load demand. However, the fuel temperature
coefficient was the important factor for reactor
control in the ARE because it took a significant
time for the bulk of the material of the reactor to
change temperature and, therefore, for the over-all
coefficient to be felt. In experiment H-5 (cf., Fig.
6.4), it was found that the fuel temperature coef-
ficient predominated for 6 min.

EFFECT OF GEOMETRY IN THE ARE

When the reactor was allowed to heat up by
nuclear power, as in experiment H-5, the measure-
ments of the temperature coefficient were quite
definitive. The experiments in which the heat
extraction by the helium blower was suddenly
increased, i.e., experiments E-2, L-8, and H-4, did
not give clear-cut results. In fact, it was noticed
throughout the operation that whenever the fuel

192

~

loop helium blower speed was increased there was
always a sudden marked increase in reactivity. In
attempting to determine this instantaneous temper-
ature coefficient by observing the rod movement
by the servo as a function of the fuel temperature,
values of the fuel temperature coefficient of a
magnitude much larger than —9.8 x 10> could be
obtained.

The change in the apparent temperature coef-
ficient as a function of time during experiment H-4
is shown in Fig. 0.1. The time intervals chosen
were of 15-sec duration. The apparent peak tem-
perature coefficient of reactivity was in excess of
~3.5 x 10=# (Ak/k)/°F, and after 5 min the coef-
ficient leveled out to a value of about —6 x 1073.
A more complete discussion of this experiment is
given below in the section on ‘High-Power Meas-
urements of Temperature Coefficients of Reac-
tivity," in which the time lag of the thermocouples
is taken into account. Two coefficients were ob-
tained: an initial fuel temperature coefficient and
an over-all coefficient, which was the asymptotic
value (=6 x 10~3) given by Fig. O.1.

The effect shown in Fig. 0.1 was due partly to
geometrical considerations. By reference to Figs.
2.2 and 2.3, it can be seen that as the fuel entered
the reactor it passed through the tubes closest to

the center where the reactivity effect was greatest.
With a sudden increase in heat extraction, a slug
of cooled fuel initially entered the center of the
core and caused a large reactivity change. Since
the mean reactor temperature was the average
temperature of all the fuel tubes, a comparison of
the initial rate of rod insertion by the servo with
the initial rate of change of the mean reactor
temperature could give an apparent temperature
coefficient much larger than its actual value. For
example, in experiment L-8 {cf., Figs. 5.13 and
5.14) a comparison of the slopes of the rod position
curve and the mean temperature curve near the
beginning of the run was made. If it is assumed
that the temperature response of the thermocouples
lagged behind the response of the regulating rod
movement, it is interesting to compare the points
of steepest slope for the two curves. By using
the slope from Fig. 5.13 at time 0218:30, and the
slope from the mean temperature curve (Fig. 5.14)
at 0220, a temperature coefficient of ~1.6 x 104
(Ak/E)/°F is obtained, as opposed to the actual
fuel temperature coefficient of ~9.8 x 1073, A
detailed discussion of this experiment is given
in the section on ‘Low-Power Measurements of
Temperature Coefficients of Reactivity.” This
effect was characteristic of the geometry of the
ARE but not necessarily of circulating-fuel re-
actors in general.

TIME LAG CONSIDERATIONS

As mentioned above and in the “Reactor Kinetics”
section of Chapter 6, one of the most consistently
noted phenomena of the ARE operation was the
time lag in reactor temperature response during
every phase of the experiment, These time lag
effects can be partly explained by the geometry
effect just described; and, in this sense, the time
lag is not a true time lag but only an apparent lag
due to the differences in location and response of
the thermocouples and the neutron detectors (and,
hence, regulating rod movements '). Other possible
causes for the time lags were the fuel transit time
around the system, the heat transfer phenomenon
within the reactor, the design and location of
thermocouples, and a mass-temperature inertia
effect. These effects were all discussed briefly
in the section on ‘‘Reactor Kinetics,’ Chapter 6.

The regulating rod was controlled by a flux servo
mechanism which received its error signal from a
neutron detector (cf., App. C).

Whether or not the time lag was all or partly real
is academic. The fact that it did give an observed
effect during many phases of the ARE operation
made it mandatory to take the lag into account in
interpreting much of the data. The manner in which

this was actually done was to assume that the.

response of the thermocouples lagged behind the
nuclear response of the reactor (by as much as
2} min for low-power operation and by about 1 min
during the high-power regime) in those experiments
in which the equilibrium between the reactor and
its load was upset (i.e., rapid fuel cooling rates).
The thermocouple readings were then “moved up'’
by that amount, and the new readings were com-
pared with the appropriate nuclear instrument
observation. For those experiments in which equi-
{ibrium prevailed, but in which cooling was taking
place, it was only necessary to correct for temper-
ature readings (cf., app. K).

The temperature coefficient measurements were
probably more affected by the temperature-time
lags than any other single type of measurement
made on the ARE, mainly because of the short
duration of the experiments and their great de-
pendence on time correlations (for example, corre-
iations between regulating rod motion and mean
temperature changes). The results of temperature
coefficient measurements which contained time lag
corrections were not included in the main body of
the report because such corrections needed to be
discussed in detail inappropriate to the context of
the report. These experiments are described in
the following sections of this appendix.

SUBCRITICAL MEASUREMENT OF
TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENT

The subcritical measurement of the temperature
coefficient (exp. E-2) was described in Chapter 4.
Briefly, the procedure followed was to cool the
fuel by raising the heat barriers on the fuel heat
exchangers, turning on the fuel helium blowers,
and then observing the increase in multiplication
with the two fission chambers and the BF, counter.
The BF; counting rate was so low that the sta-
tistics were poor; therefore, the fission chamber
data had to be used. The subcritical multiplication
of the fission chambers was then subject to the
phenomenon discussed in Appendix E. In this
experiment the cooling was rapid and equilibrium
conditions were not attained. Consequently, in
order to find a value of the temperature coefficient
from these measurements, it was necessary to

193

i  —— + ——

 

rE

 
 

 

apply three corrections: a correction for the fission
chamber multiplication error, a time lag correction,
and a temperature correction of control room ob-
served temperatures {app. K).

Throughout the subcritical experiments ample
data were taken simultaneously on the BF, counter
and the two fission chambers for a correlation plot
between the counting rates of the BF; counter and
the fission chamber to be easily obtained, as
shown in Fig. 0.2. A plot of the raw data obtained
from the fission chambers before corrections were
applied is shown in Fig. 0.3,2 which shows the
counting rates of the chambers plotted as a function
of the reactor mean temperature. The hysteresis
effect is the result of the time lag. The progress
of the experiment can be read from the curves by
starting on the right side at 1004 and proceeding
counterclockwise around the loops. The fuel
blower was turned on at 1004 and allowed to cool
the fuel for 5 min, after which the blower was turned
off and the system then slowly returned to its initial
condition. The fission chamber counting rates
increased while the blower was on and decreased
after the blower was turned off again in immediate
response to the cooling. The reactor mean temper-
ature change, on the other hand, lagged behind
both when the blower was turned on and when it
was turned off. The blower was turned off shortly
after 1009, but even though the counting rate
started to decrease immediately, the reactor mean
temperature continued to fall for approximately
2) min before it began to show a warming trend.
Undoubtedly the fuel temperature did actually
follow closely the changes introduced by the
blower (otherwise the counting rate changes would
not have been observed as promptly as they were),
but because of the various effects noted in this
appendix and in the ‘‘Reactor Kinetics'' section
of Chapter 4 the thermocouples were slow in
responding. If the thermocouples had shown instant
response there would have been no hysteresis
effect observed, and the plot of £ vs mean temper-
ature would have been a straight line with a nega-
tive slope proportional to the temperature coef-
ficient.

The plot of £ vs mean temperature was obtained
by applying the three corrections noted above in

2This plot is actually a cross plot of the curves of
Fig. 4.5, which show both the counting rate and reactor
mean temperature plotted as a function of time.

194

the following way. The first correction was applied
by changing the fission chamber data to BF,
counter data by using the curves of Fig. 0.2. The
resulting points obtained from each fission chamber
were averaged and then plotted on a time scale
along with the reactor mean temperature to produce
a plot similar to the curves of Fig. 4.5. The maxi-
mum of the counting rate curve and the minimum
of the temperature curve were then matched up (the
temperature curve was effectively moved up 2,
min in time), and new temperatures were read from
the temperature curve corresponding to the time
that the counts were taken. From the counting
rates the multiplication factor & = 1 ~ (1/M) was
determined for each point, and then a plot of £ as
a function of mean temperature was drawn up, as
shown in Fig. 0.4. A straight line could reasonably
be drawn through the points.

The third and final correction to be applied to
the mean temperature was obtained from Appendix
K. Since this experiment was one in which the
fuel was cooled rapidly and equilibrium conditions
were not met, the curves of Fig. K.2 are applicable.
From Fig. K.2 it can be shown that a change of
1°F in the true mean temperature corresponds to
a change of 1.40°F in the mean temperature read
from the control room instruments. Thus the mean
temperature change observed had to be increased
by a factor of 1.4. A measurement of the slope of
the curve of Fig. 0.4 gives a (Ak/k)/AT of 1.65 x
10-4. The average k over the plot is 0.922. By
applying the factor 1.4 to the observed mean tem-
perature change, the fuel temperature coefficient
was calculated to be

~1.65 x 1074 )
—-1.28 x 10”

 (AR/R)/AT =>
a= (Ar/K)/ 0.922 x 1.4

This value is about 30% higher than that given
by the results of experiment H-5, but it is in fair
agreement in consideration of all the necessary
corrections. A consideration of the errors involved
showed that the maximum error was of the order of
magnitude of 2.4 x 10™>. Therefore,

a = —(1.28 + 0.24) x 10~4

If the lower limit of this value is taken, the
agreement between this value ond the accepted
value is fairly good. This experiment did not yield
an over-all temperature coefficient.

LOW-POWER MEASUREMENTS OF
TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENTS
OF REACTIVITY

The low-power measurements of the temperature
coefficients of reactivity were similar to the sub-
critical measurements, except that with the reactor
critical and on servo at 1-w power, reactivity
introduced by cooling the fuel was observed by a
change in the regulating rod position. The experi-
ment is described in Chapter 5.

As shown in Fig. 0.5, which is a plot of the
regulating rod position vs the observed mean
temperature during the experiment, a hysteresis
phenomenon was obtained. It is significant that
no time lags needed to be taken into account in
the interpretation of this data, because the experi-
ment proceeded slowly enough for equilibrium
conditions to prevail. However, since this was a
cooling experiment, a temperature correction had
to be applied. Cooling took place along the iower
half of the figure and heating occurred along the
upper portion. Each of the curves had an initial
steep slope corresponding to an initial fuel temper-
ature coefficient and a less steep slope from which
an over-all reactivity coefficient was found.

After correction for the mean temperature read-
ings, the average of the two initial slopes gave
a fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity of
~9.9 x 10~3, and the other slopes gave an average
over-all reactivity coefficient of about —5.8 x 10~3,
These values agree well with the accepted values
of ~9.8 x 10> and =6.1 x 10~> for the fuel and
over-all temperature coefficients of reactivity,
respectively.

HIGH-POWER MEASUREMENTS OF
TEMPERATURE COEFFICIENTS
OF REACTIVITY

During the high-power operations an experiment
was conducted at a power of 100 kw which was
similar to the low-power experiment just described.
The fuel helium blower was turned on with the
reactor on servo, and the fuel was cooled. How-
ever, the action took place so rapidly that a 1-min
time lag® of the fuel mean temperature had to be
accounted for in plotting the data in addition to
the temperature correction. Figure 0.6, in which
the regulating rod movement is plotted as a function
of the mean fuel temperature, shows the experi-
mental measurements. Two distinct slopes were
observed that corresponded to an initial fuel
temperature coefficient and to an over-all temper-
ature coefficient of reactivity.

From the steep slope (curve No. 1) a fuel temper-
ature coefficient of —=1.17 x 10=4 (Ak/k)/°F was
obtained, and from the other slope an over-all coef-
ficient of =5.9 x 10=3 (Ak/k)/°F was found. These
two values are in fair agreement with the accepted
values of =9.8 x 10~% and ~6.1 x 10~> for these
coefficients.

3 Time lags at high power operation were observed to

be shorter than those at low or no power. For a dis-
cussion, see Chapter 4,

THEORETICAL XENON POISONING

The xenon poisoning which existed in the ARE
was determined experimentally to be an almost
negligible amount. It was therefore of interest to
compute the amount of such poisoning that would
have been present if no xenon had been lost due
to off-gassing of the fuel so that a measure of the
effectiveness of the off-gassing process could be
obtained.

The poisoning by Xe '?°, when the xenon content
has reached equilibrium, is given by!

section and a constant 1/v absorption cross
section, they found that the neutron energy distri-
bution is well represented by a Maxwellian distri-
bution corresponding to an effective temperature,

where the macroscopic absorption cross section
2, is measured at the moderator temperature and
2 is the macroscopic scattering cross section.
The effective temperature

T, = T,(1 + adn) ,

where T is the moderator temperature, a is a
constant approximately equal to 0.9, and A is the
atomic weight of the moderator.

The present state of the theory does not permit
consideration of the inhomogeneous distribution of
the various constituents of the ARE core, and
therefore the main constituents were considered to
be evenly distributed over the core. The nuclei
per cubic centimeter were thus

Oxygen 5.5 x 1022
Beryllium 5.5 x 1022
u23s 7.8 x 1019

Other elements made only a negligible contribution
to the cross section of the core. The following
cross sections were used:

Oxygen, scattering 4 barns
Beryllium, scattering 7 barns

For the atomic weight, A, the average of the

The Xe!35 absorption cross section in the reactor
was then determined, as shown in Table P.I,
which gives the energy intervals of the neutrons,
E,, the fraction of neutrons in these energy inter-
vals according to the Maxwell-Boltzman distri-
bution, n(E)/n, and the total Xe!35 cross section,
o,, for each energy interval,® from which the
average Xe'35 cross section is obtained. In the
energy range in question the xenon adsorption
cross section is approximately equal to the total
xenon cross section, 0. As shown in Table P.1,
the value of this cross section is 1.335 x 10°
barns or 1.335 x 10~18 cm?,

The anticipated xenon poisoning during the 25-hr
xenon run (exp. H-11) may then be computed from
Eq. 1 by using the value determined above for the
Xe'33 absorption cross section:

(such as Inconel, etc.), and during the 25 hr of
operation, if the xenon had all stayed in the fuel
it would have reached 69% of its equilibrium
concentration. By applying these various cor-
rections, it is found that the xenon poisoning in

the ARE at the end of the 25-hr run should have

This value has to be corrected because about
one-third of the fissions occur at energies above
thermal and therefore have only little competition
from xenon absorption, Furthermore, the reactivity

above because of the absorption in other poisons

Appendix Q
OPERATIONAL DIFFICULTIES

The operational difficulties described here are
only those which occurred during the nuclear phase
of the operation, that is, from October 30 to No-
vember 12, the period of time covered by this
report. With a system as large, as complex, and
as unique as that which constituted the ARE, it is
amazing that so few difficulties developed during
the crucial stages of the operation. Furthermore,
such troubles were, without exception, not of a
serious nature. This is in large measure attribut-
able to the iong period of installation and testing
which preceded the nuclear operation, the safety
features inherent in the system, and the quality
of workmanship which went into its construction.
All major difficulties and impediments which arose
are discussed below and are grouped by systems,
with special regard for chronology of occurrence.

ENRICHMENT SYSTEM

As mentioned previously, the fuel enrichment
system was changed (shortly before the critical
experiment was to begin) from a remotely operated
two-stage system, in which the transfer was to
start with all the fuel concentrate in a single con-
tainer, to a manually operated two-stage system,
in which small batches of the available concentrate
were transferred, one at a time. A portion of the
equipment used is shown in Fig. Q.1. Although
this change resulted in an improvement both in
safety and control, the temperature control of the
manually operated system was persistently diffi-
cult. Furthermore, in order to avoid plugged lines
because of the concentrate freezing at cold spots,
the lines had to be continuously purged with gas
and the exit gas lines then plugged as a result of
concentrate-vapor condensation. Both these diffi-
culties could have been avoided with proper design.

The temperature control was a greater problem
here than anywhere else in the system because of
the small (he and % in.) tubing used in the trans-
fer lines and an inferior technique of heater instal-
lation. This problem was aggravated by the virtual
inaccessibility of the connection between the
transfer line and the pump at the time the system
was revised. The final heater arrangement used,
which proved to be satisfactory, consisted of

Design and Installation of the Aircraft Reactor Ex-
periment, ORNL-1844 (to be issued).

202

double tracing of the line with calrod heaters
staggered so that successive pairs of calrods did
not meet at the same point. Even with this arrange-
ment, thermocouples were necessary at every
heater junction and each calrod or each pair of
calrods should have had a separate control.

After it became an established part of the enrich-
ment procedure to continuously bleed gas through
the transfer line into the pump (in order to keep
the line clear), the gas was vented through an
extra line at the pump. The extra line was not
properly heated and soon plugged with vapor
condensate. |t then became necessary to use the
primary pump vent system which had a vapor trap.
By reducing the bleed gas flow to a minimum, this
vent system could be used without becoming
plugged with vapor condensate.

The transfer line to the pump served adequately
throughout the critical experiment, although it had
to be reworked four times either because of the
formation of plugs or the development of leaks (in
Swagelok connections where the line was cut and
replaced). During the last injection for rod cali-
bration the transfer line again became plugged at
the fitting through the pump flange. This fitting
was a resistance-heated concentric-tubing arrange-
ment which provided an entrance for the 1300°F
transfer line through the 700°F pump flange. The
oxidized fuel from previous leaks had shorted the
heating circuit, and the fitting had therefore cooled
and plugged. Attempts to clear the fitting caused
it to leak; the leak was sealed but the fitting was
then inoperable.

The final injection of concentrate, which was
required for burnup at power, xenon poison, etc.,
was therefore made through the fuel sampling line.
A special batch of concentrate was prepared and
pressurized into the pump through the sample line.
This technique worked satisfactorily but had previ-
ously been avoided because the line had not been
designed to attain the high temperatures > 1200°F
required by the melting point of the concentrate.
Furthermore, the sample line was attached to the
pump below the liquid level in the pump, and if
a leak had developed in the line a sizeable spill
would have resulted.

. PROCESS INSTRUMENTATION

For an appreciation of the generally excellent
performance of the instrumentation, knowledge of
the number and complexity of the instruments is
required. There were at- least 27 strip recorders
(mostly multipoint), 5 circular recorders, 7 indi-
cating controllers, 9 temperature indicators (with
from 48 to 96 points apiece), about 50 spark plugs,
20 ammeters, 40 pressure gages, 16 pressure regu-
lators, 20 pressure transmitters, and numerous flow
recorder indicators and alarms, voltmeters, tachome-
ters, and assorted miscellaneous instruments.
Furthermore, many of these were employed in sys-
tems circulating fuel and sodium at temperatures
up to 1600°F. Since all instruments were subject
to routine inspection and service, petty difficulties
were kept to a minimum.

In the course of nuclear operation, only the
following instruments gave cause for particular
concern: fuel flowmeter, main fuel pump level
indicator, several sodium system spark plugs, fuel
pressure transmitter, and several pump tachometer
generators. Of these only the tachometer generator
“failures’’ were not caused by the materials and
temperatures being instrumented. The tachometers,
as installed, were belt driven rather than direct-
coupled and were not designed to withstand the
side bearing loads to which they were subjected.
The tachometers were replaced, however, before
the pits were sealed, and they performed satis-
factorily during the high-power operation.

The fuel flowmeter and the fuel pump level indi-
cator were similar instruments in which a float or
bob was attached to a long tapered iron core sus-
pended in a ‘‘dead leg.”” Coils were mounted out-
side the dead leg which located the position of the
core. The position of the core could be interpreted
as a measure either of fuel level or of fuel flow up
past the bob. The coil current, however, was very
sensitive to the fuel temperature, which had to be
maintained above the fuel melting point. In ad-
dition to the temperature sensitivity, several coils
(spare coils were provided on each instrument)
opened up during the experiment, presumably due
to oxidation of the coil-to-lead wire connection.
The fuel flowmeter oscillated rapidly over a 10-
gpm range throughout the later stages of the experi-
ment, although the electronics of the instrument
appeared to be in order. On the other hand, oper-
ation of the main fuel pump level indicator was
satisfactory up to the last day of operation, at
which time the spare coil opened up (the main coil

204

had previously opened). lt is felt that these instru-
ments would have performed satisfactorily if the
iron core were designed to move in a trapped gas
leg above the float rather than in a dead leg below
the float so that the operating temperature could
be reduced. Furthermore, the coi! reading should
be “balanced out’ to eliminate the temperature
sensitivity.

Of the numerous spark plugs which were employed
in the various fuel and sodium tanks as the measure
or check on the liquid level, only three of those in
the sodium system showed a persistent tendency
to short. These shorts could not always be cleared
by ‘‘short-burning,”’ but they frequently cleared
themselves as the liquid level dropped. Although
the probes were located in a riser above the tank
top to minimize shorts, the shorts could probably
have been eliminated by using larger clearances
than were afforded by the use of Jy ina-0D probes in
a Yy-in.-IPS pipe riser.

The high-temperature fuel system pressure trans-
mitters suffered a zero shift during the course of
the experiment. These transmitters employed
bellows through which the liquid pressure was
transmitted to gas. It is probable that the bellows
were distorted at times when the gas and liquid
pressure were not balanced as a result of oper-
ational errors or plugged gas supply lines. In any
case, the gas ports in the transmitter occasionally
plugged, and a zero shift in the instrument was
observed.

In view of the large number of thermocouples in
use throughout the experiment (in the neighborhood
of 1000), it is not surprising that a small number
were in error. However, those which gave incorrect
indications included some of the most important
ones associated with the entire experiment. As
discussed in Appendix K there was serious dis-
agreement between line thermocouples inside and
outside the reactor thermal shield, although it
would appear that they both should have given the
same indication. Other misleading temperature
readings were obtained from the thermocouples on
the tubes in the fuel-to-helium heat exchangers.
These thermocouples were not properly shielded
from the helium flow and read low.

Although most of the thermocouple installations
were designed to measure equilibrium temperatures
and did so satisfactorily for a number of experi-
ments involving fost transients, it was important
that the response of the thermocouples be > 10°F
per sec in order to correlate the changes in fluid

temperatures with nuclear changes. Unfortunately
it is not certain that this was the case, and, in
addition, in certain instances, as with one of the
thermocouples on each of the reactor AT and re-
actor mean temperature instruments, the thermo-
couples were mounted on electrical insulators
which increased the thermal lags.

The above discussion covers most of the instru-
mentation difficulties that arose. This is not
meant to imply, for example, that all the 800-odd
thermocouples lasted throughout the experiment;
there were open thermocouples scattered through-
out the system. Furthermore, the instrument me-
chanics were kept busy; when not doing installation
work, they were usually involved in routine service
and maintenance work.

NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROLS

It is difficult in the case of the nuclear instru-
ments to separate operation problems from those
inherent in routine installation and debugging,
since these latter operations were continued right
up to the time the instruments were needed. How-
ever, during actual operation, all nuclear instru-
mentation performed satisfactorily. The control
mechanism operated as designed, except that one
shim rod had a higher hold current (it was sup-
ported by an electromagnet) than the other two.
This situation was improved by cleaning the magnet
face and filtering the gas surrounding the magnet.

ANNUNCIATORS

The control system included an annunciator
panei which anticipated potential troubles and
indicated off-design conditions by a light and an
alarm. During the course of the experiment, cer-
tain annunciators consistently gave false indi-
cations, and therefore the bells (but not the lights)
of these annunciators were finally disconnected.
Included were the standby sodium pump lubrication
system flow, the standby fuel pump cooling water
flow, the fuel heat exchanger water flow, and the
fuel heat exchanger low-temperature alarm. The
first three annunciators had mercury switches
which were either improperly mounted or set too
close to the design condition, but the fuel heat
exchanger low temperature alarm error was due to
faulty thermocouple indication; that is, instead of
indicating fuel temperature, the thermocouple,
which was located in the cooling gas stream, read
low. ’

HEATERS AND HEATER CONTROLS

During the time the system was being heated, the
heater system power was over 500 kw. This heat
was transferred to the piping and other components
by the assorted ceramic heaters, calrods, and strip
heaters that covered every square inch of fuel and
sodium piping, as well as all system components
which contained these liquids. Although there
were numerous heater failures resulting from
mechanical abuse up until the time the pits were
sealed, all known failures were repaired before
the pit was sealed. Only four heater circuits were
known to be inoperable at the time the reactor was
scrammed ~ two heaters showed open, two shorted.

Except for the fuel enrichment system in which
the heating situation was aggravated by the higher
temperatures as well as the small lines, the
available heat was adequate everywhere. The
control of the various heater circuits was, however,
initially very poor; it consisted of four voltage
buses to which the various loads could be con-
nected plus variacs for valve and instrument
heaters. However, in order to obtain satisfactory
heater control for all elements of the system, 13
additional regulators were installed in addition to
numerous additional variacs. With the additional
regulators it was possible to split up the heater
load to get the proper temperatures throughout the
system without overloading any distribution panel.
Even with the helium annulus, one function of
which was to distribute the external heat uniformly,
it must be concluded as extremely desirable, if
not an absolute necessity, that all components of
any such complex high-temperature system be
provided with independently controlled heater units
in order to achieve the desired system equilibrium
temperature.

SYSTEM COMPONENTS

The only major components of either the sodium
or fuel system which caused any concern during
the nuclear operation were the sodium valves
(several of which leaked) and the fuel pump (from
which emanated a noise originally believed to
originate in the pump bearings). In addition, there
were problems associated with plugged gas valves
and overloaded motor relays.

The sodium valves that leaked were the two
pairs that isolated the main and standby pumps
and at least one of the fill valves in the lines to
the three sodium fill tanks. The leakage across

205

 
 

 

 

- the pump isolation valves was eliminated from
concern by maintaining the pressure in the inoper-
ative pump at the value required to balance with
the system pressures. The leak (or leaks) in the
fill valves was of the order of % to 1 f° of
sodium per day, and was periodically made up by
refilling the system from one of the fill tanks. In
the course of these operations, two tanks eventually
became empty, and it was then apparent that most
of the leakage had been through the valve to the
third tank. This leakage was initially abetted by
the high (~ 50 psi) pressure drop across the valve,
but even though the pressure difference was re-
duced to 5 to 10 psi the leakage rate appeared to
increase during the run.

It was of interest, as well as fortunate for the
ultimate success of the project, that the fuel carrier
fill vaives were tight. However, in the fuel system,
only two valves were opened during the filling

operation and only one of these had to seal in
order to prevent leakage. This valve did seal, and
it was opened only one other time, i.e., when the
system was dumped.

Each sodium pump (main and standby) and each
fuel pump (main and standby) was provided with
four microphone pickups to detect bearing noises.
Shortly after the fuel system had been filled with
the fuel carrier, the noise level detected on one
of the main fuel pump pickups jumped an order of
magnitude, while that on the other increased
substantially. At the time the noise was believed
to be due to a flat spot on a bearing, and operation
was therefore watched very closely. When the
noise level did not increase further (in fact, it
tended to decrease), it was decided to continue
the experiment without replacing the pump (a very
difficult job which could conceivably have resulted
in contamination of the fuel system). The pump
operated satisfactorily throughout the experiment.
Subsequent review of the pump design and behavior
of the noise level indicated that the noise probably
originated at the pump discharge where a sleeve
was welded inside the system to effect a slip
connection between the pump discharge duct from
the impeller housing and the exit pipe, which was
welded to the pump casing. Vibration of the sleeve
in the slip joint could account for all the noise.

Although the vent header was heated from the
fuel and sodium systems to the vapor trap filled
with NaK (which was provided to remove certain
fission products but alse removed sodium vapor),

206

the temperature control of the header and the
individual vent lines connected to it was not
adequate to maintain the line above the sodium
melting point and yet not exceed the maximum
temperature limit (400°F) of the solenoid and
diaphragm gas valves. Consequently, these vent
fines became restricted by the condensation of
sodium vapor. It was apparent that a higher temper-
ature valve would have been desirable, that the
gas line connecting the tank to the header should
have been installed so that it could drain back into
the tank, and, also, that good temperature control
of the line and valve should have been provided.
As it was, exceptionally long times were required
to vent the sodium tanks through the normal vent
valves. It would have been necessary to use the
emergency vent system, which was still operable
at the end of the experiment, if a fast dump had
been required.

In addition to the above failures or shortcomings,
there were numerous problems of less serious
nature in connection with auxiliary equipment,
motor overloads, water pipes which froze and split,
and air dryers which burned out. However, nothing
occurred in such a manner or at such a time as to
have any significant bearing on the conduct of the
experiment.

LEAKS

The only sodium or fluoride leaks that occurred
have already been discussed. These included one
minor sodium leak in the sodium purification sys-
tem (discussed in chap. 3, ‘“Prenuclear Operation’’)
and two fuel concentrate leaks from the enrichment
system. That neither the reactor fuel system nor
sodium system leaked is a tribute to the quality
of the workmanship in both welding and inspection
that went into the fabrication of these systems. In
all, there were over 266 welded joints exposed to
the fiuoride mixture, and over 225 welded joints
were exposed to the sodium.

In contrast to the liquid systems, there were
several leaks in gas systems. It is felt that these
leaks would not have occurred if the gas systems
had been fabricated according to the standards
used for the liquid systems. The notable gas leaks
were from the fuel pumps into the pits, from the
helium ducts in the heat exchangers into the pits,
and from the pits into the building through the
various pit bulkheads, as well as the chamber
which housed the reactor controls.

The combination of the leak out of the fuel pump
and that out of the pits required that the pits be
maintained at subatmospheric pressures in order
to prevent gaseous activity from contaminating the
building. Accordingly, the pit pressure was lowered
by about 6 in. H,0 by using portable compressors
which discharged the gaseous activity some 1000 ft
south of the ARE building. The activity was of
such a low magnitude that, coupled with favorable
meteorological conditions, it was possible to

operate in this manner for the last four days of the
experiment.

The leaks out of the helium ducts in the fuel and
sodium heat exchangers resulted in a maximum
helium concentration in the ducts of the order of
50%, and to maintain even this low concentration,
it was necessary to use excessive helium supply
rates, i.e., 15 cfm to the ducts alone and another
10 cfm to the instruments.

Appendix R
INTEGRATED POWER

The total integrated power obtained from the
operation of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment does
not have any particular significance in terms of
the operational life of the system. However, a
total integrated power of 100 Mw was more or less
arbitrarily specified as one of the nominal ob-
jectives of the experiment. While at the time the
experiment was concluded it was estimated that
this, as well as all other objectives of the experi-
ment, had been met, the estimate was based on a
crude evaluation of reactor power. Since subsequent
analyses of the data have permitted a reasonably
accurate determination of the reactor power, it is
of interest to reapprdise the estimated value of the
total integrated power,

The total integrated power could be determined
from either the nuclear power or the extracted
power (cf., section on ‘‘Reactor Kinetics’ in
chap. 6). The power curves, which should have
equivalent integrals, could be obtained from any
of a number of continuously recording instruments,
i.e., the nuclear power from either the micromicro-
ammeter or log N meter, and the extracted power
from any of the several temperature differential
recorders in the fuel and sodium circuits, The
total integrated power has been determined both
from integration of a nuclear power curve (log N)
and from the sum of the extracted power in both
the sodium and fuel circuits, as determined by the
temperature differentials in each system together
with their respective flows (which were held
constant). For both power determinations a calcu-
lation of the associated error was made.

EXTRACTED POWER

The integrated extracted power was determined
from the charts which continuously recorded the
temperature differential (AT) in each system. As
ao matter of convenience the sodium system AT
was taken from a 24-hr circular chart, while the
fuel AT was taken from one of the six Brown strip
charts which recorded, in the control room, the
AT across each of the six parallel fuel circuits
through the reactor. The individual circuit
recorders had a much slower chart speed than
that of the over-all AT recorder and were therefore
much easier to read, To keep the results well
within the accuracy of the whole experiment, tube
No. 4 was selected for the determination because

208

the chart trace very closely corresponded to that
of the over-all fuel AT across the reactor, From
Fig. K.3, Appendix K, the control-room-recorded
AT was converted to what was accepted as the
correct AT. The power extraction was then calcu-
lated and plotted against time in Fig. R.1.

The sodium AT across the reactor was obtained
from the circular charts of the recorders located
in the control room, These AT's were also
corrected by using Fig. K.6, Appendix K, and
the plot of the power extracted by the sodium as a
function of time is also shown in Fig. R.1 on the
same abscissa as that of the fuel plot. The total
integrated (extracted) power, i.e., the sum of the
area under both the fuel and sodium system power
curves, was then determined by using a planimeter;
it was found to be 97 Mw-hr,

A calculation was also made of the magnitude
of the *“*maximum’’ possible error in the determi-
nation of the reactor power. The power equation,
which was calculated for both the fuel and sodium
systems, was

P = kf AT ,
where
P = reactor power,
k = a constant containing heat capacity and
conversion units,
{ = flow rate of fuel or sodium,
AT = temperature difference across reactor,

The consequent error equation is
AP = kf MAT) + EAT Af + [AT Ak,

where
Ak = maximum error in the heat capacity,
Af = maximum error in the flow rate,
A(AT) = maximum error in the temperature
difference.
Nominal average values of these factors for the
fuel system were

f = 46 gpm
AT = 350°F
k = 0.11 kw/day gpm
Af = 2gpm = 5%
AAT) = 10°F = 3%
Ak = 0.011 = 10%

Therefore
AP (for fuel system) = 20%

The values for the sodium system were

f = 152 gpm
AT = 50°F
k = 0.0343 kw/day.gpm
Af = 4 gpm = 3%
AAT) = 10°F = 20%
Ak = 0

Therefore
AP (for sodium system) = 11%

The weighted, over-all percentage error was
therefore

AP P;x 0.20 P_x0.11

—_— —= 17,

pP P pP
where P, and P_ are the power extracted in the
fuel and sodium systems. The errors made in the
power integration by using the AT chart are only
those associated with the determination of power
extraction. Since Fig. R.1 is a reproduction of the
AT trace and it was integrated by using the
planimeter, any integrating errors were assumed
to have been averaged out. Therefore, the error
that applies to the integrated extracted power is
the 17% that is applicable to the power level
determination; therefore the integrated extracted
power was

97 + 16.5 Mwehr

NUCLEAR POWER

During most of the time the reactor was operating
at any appreciable power level, the nuclear power
level was kept fairly constant and was recorded in
the log book, During the times the power level
was either not constant or not recorded in the log
book, the nuclear power was determined from the
log N recorder chart by integrating the area under
the power trace. (The log N trace was used
rather than the micromicroammeter because no
record was kept of the micromicroammeter shunt
value as a multiplying factor.) Since the log N
chart gave a log of power vs time plot, exact
integration under the curve would have been an
extremely difficult task; accordingly, the area
under the curve was integrated graphically. The
curved portions of the trace were approximated by
straight lines, and an average log N value was
determined for each line segment. It was assumed
that there were as many positive as negative
errors in this method and that the errors cancelled
out. The total integrated power was then obtained

210

by adding up all the incremental areas which were
in terms of average log N units times time,

From the 25-hr constant-power xenon run a
relation between the log N reading and the
extracted power was obtained, It was found that
22.5 log N units = 2.12 Mw, or 10.6 log N units =]
Mw; therefore

log N
10.6

for any segment under the curve. By using this
correlation between actual power and log N
reading, the total integrated nuclear power was
calculated to be 96.6 Mw-hr, This value of the
integrated nuclear power, QO, as determined from
the log N chart, was, in effect, found from the
following relation

 

x time (hr) = Mw-hr

0 = MCA: ,

where
M = average log N recorded value over an
increment of time At,

At = increment of time in hours,
C = a constant which converts the log N value
to Mw-hr.

The constant, C, in the expression is equal to the
percentage error in the extracted power level
determination, which was calculated in the
preceding section to be 17%. Therefore the error
in Cis (0.17) (1/10.6) = 0.016. The 74-hr period
of high-power operation was divided into two
parts, one part being the 25-hr period of constant
power during the xenon run and the remainder
being the 49-hr period of variable power, The
errors were of different magnitude for each part,
since during the xenon run there was no error in
time or in the determination of the average value
of M.

For the 25-hr xenon run the integrated power was

53 Mw=hr, Thus

M = 22.5 log N units

At = 25 hr
C = 0.094 Mw/log N
AM = 0
A(Ar) = 0
AC = 0.016 = 17%

Therefore
AQ, = MC A(At) + M AC At + AM C At = 9 Mw-hr

For the balance of the operating time (49 hr) and
integrated power (43.6 Mw-hr), the average M must

AA) = Thr
AC = 0.016 = 17%

AQ,=MC A(At) + M AC At + AM C At = 12.8 Mw-hr,

The total error was therefore

AQ = 12.8 + 9.0 = 21.8 Mw-hr or 22.5% .

The total extracted nuclear power then was

96.6 t 21.8 Mw-br .

When excess reactivity is being introduced into
a reactor at a given rate, the period meter will
show a period which is not a true period but a
combination of the true period and its time rate of
change. If the time rate of change of the period is
known, then the true period may be found by the
following means.

First, it is assumed that whenever any excess
reactivity is introduced into the reactor the power
will rise according to the following equation:

P= Pett ,
where

Py = initial power,

A= 1/7,

T = reactor period,

 

{ = time power is increasing.

Then, to introduce a time rate of change of the
period, the power is expressed in the form of an
infinite series

In experiment H-8 (cf., chap. 6) it was noted

that when the regulating rod was withdrawn the :

period observed was not a true period and that it
kept changing over the 35 sec it took the regulating
rod to travel its full distance. For a calculation
of the true period, the following values were

taken from Fig. 6.10 and Table 6.4:

Poy = 2.34 Mw,
P= 3.94 Mw,
7, = 25 sec (initial period observed),
7, = 50 sec (final period observed),

From these values, it was found that

This calculated value for the true period corre-
sponds fairly closely to the period of 42 sec
measured from the slope of the log N recorder

Appendix T
NUCLEAR LOG

The following information was copied verbatim from the nuclear log book, The only material omitted
was the running uranium inventory, which was kept during the critical experiment, and several calcu-
lations and graphs, which were inserted in the log book in an attempt to interpret the data, All the
omitted information is presented in much better form elsewhere in this report.

The reactor power data referred to in the log are not consistent, because the power was estimated
first from a calculation of flux at the chambers, subsequently from the activation of a fuel semple, and
finally fromthe extracted power, If it is assumed that the extracted power value is correct, the original
estimate was a factor of 2.7 low and that calculated from the fuel activation was a factor of 2 low. In
the log book, all power levels mentioned through experiment L-8 were based on the original estimate;
from experiment L-9 to H-14, all power levels were based on the fuel activation; and it was not until

after high-power runs 1 and 2 of experiment H-14 that correct power levels were listed.

Micromicroammeter took a small dip (53 to 52) for no apparent reason.

Adding helium to sodium and fuel system ducts.

Fuel flowmeter coils calibrate OK. There is a possibility of something
binding in the Rotameter to give the erratic readings. Switched to
operation on No. 3 coil.

Regulating rod withdrawn ~ 0.05 in. Indicator now reading 9.25 in.

Pile period shows unexplained excursion to 400 sec.

Noticed fluctuations in the fuel pump ammeter recorder corresponding
to fluctuations in the Rotameter chart, These fluctuations appear to
be between 9.0 and 9%, amp.

Noticed same pump current and flow level fluctuations as at 1130.

Switched back to No. 5 coil on fuel flow Rotameter,

Regulating rod withdrawn 0.1 in.

For the past % hr have noticed corresponding fluctuations in the
following instruments: fuel flow Rotameter, fuel motor current
recorder, period meter, log N recorder, safety levels 1 and 2, reactor
AT, the six individual tube AT's, and the micromicroammeter, All
these fluctuations at present are small, especially on the micro-
microammeter, The largest fluctuations appear to be on the pump
motor current, between 9 and 10 amp; the pile period meter, « to + 400
sec; and the six AT recorders, + 2 to 3°F. No extraneous audio noise
has been detected. Noticed increase in fuel pump pressure since 0800
of 0.2 psi. At 0800 pressure was 0.2 psi, at present it is 0.4 psi.

Appendix U
THE ARE BUILDING

The ARE building, shown in Fig. U.1, is a mill
type of structure that was designed to house the
ARE and the necessary facilities for its operation.
The building has a full basement 80 by 105 ft,
a crane bay 42 by 105 ft, and a one-story service
wing 38 by 105 ft. The reactor and the necessary
heat disposal systems were located in shielded
pits in the part of the basement serviced by the
crane. One half the main floor area was open to
the reactor and heat exchanger pits in the basement
below; the other one half housed the control room,
office space, shops, and change rooms.

In one half the basement were the shielded
reactor and heat exchanger pits; the other one
half of the basement was service area and miscel-
laneous heater and control panels. The control
room, office space, and some shops were located

on the first floor over the service area. The first
floor does not extend over the one half of the
basement that contains the pits. The crane is
a floor-operated, 10-ton, bridge crane having a
maximum lift of 25 ft above the main floor level.
Plan and elevation drawings of the building are
shown in Figs. U.2 and U.3.

The entire reactor system was contained in three
interconnected pits: one for the reactor, another
for the heat exchangers and pumps, and a third
for the fuel dump tanks. These pits, which were
sealed at the top by shielding blocks, were located
in the large crane bay of the building. The crane
bay was separated from the control room and
offices, and the heating and air conditioning
systems maintained the control room at a slightly
higher pressure than that of the crane bay.
