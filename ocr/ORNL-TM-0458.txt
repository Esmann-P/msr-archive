SOME CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR SAFETY: (1) DISSOLUTION
OF COOLANT AND FUEL MIXTURES IN HpO, (2) A PORTION OF THE
SYSTEM IiF-BeFo-H20 AT 25, 60 AND NEAR 100°C

Ruth Slusher, H. F. McDuffie, and W. L. Marshall
Abstract

In connection with safety aspects of the ORNL Molten-Salt Reactor
Program, the solubilities of MSRE fuel and coolant were determined in
HO solution at’ 259C and at higher temperatures. In a separate study,
portions of the system LiF-BeFo-HoO were investigated at temperatures
of 25, 60 and near 100°C. Under conditions of the experiments, the
results showed that (1) from the MSRE fuel, uranium dissolved to the
extent of at least 0.010 molal--probably due to oxidation of U(IV) to
U(VI)--and (2) LiF and an unidentified salt or salts of LiF and BeF,
were found to exist in the system IiF-BeFp-HoO.

1. INTRODUCTION

Safety aspects of the ORNL Molten-Salt Reactor Program make it impor-
tant to know the short- and long-term effects of a spill of molten reactor
fuel or of reactor coolant into the water-sand mixture at the bottom of
the containment shell. Since this shell is designed to withstand a maximum
pressure of 5 atmospheres (approximately equivalent to the vapor pressure
of Hy0 at 150°C), the maximum temperature of interest, when considering
long-term effects, would be 150°C. In this study, solubilities of reactor
coolant (LigBeFy) and fuel mixture (1iF-BeFp-ZrF,~ThF), UF) , T0-23-5-1-1
mole %) in water have been explored at 25°C and at higher temperatures.

In addition, investigations on the solubility of LiF, and of a compound
of LiF and BeF, of unspecified composition, in aqueous solutions varying
from O to 50 wt % BeFp were carried out at 25, 60 and near 100°C. These
latter studies are of further use in evaluating the behavior of molten-

salt coolant in contact with water.
2. EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURES

Solid LigBeF), and MSRE (Molten-Selt Reactor Experiment) fuel mixture
were obtained from the fluoride production facility of the Reactor Chemistry
Division, ORNL. T The Li,BeF) contained approximately 2 wt % excess IiF.
Chemically pure LiF was obtained from Foote Mineral Company. A stock
solution of concentrated BeF, was prepared by dissolving a weighed amount
of BeFs solid, obtained from the Beryllium Corporation, in water soluticn.
The mixture was refluxed at a little above 100°C for 24 hr in order to

dissolve the BeFp. At lower temperatures the rate of dissolution was
very slow. A radioactive tracer, Be-7, was added to the stock solution,
and portions of this solution were diluted with water to give a series
of aqueous solutions of decreasing concentrations of BeFo.

All solids were ground to fine powders (in a glove box for the
beryllium-containing solids) and were added separately to flasks contain-
ing water. In some experiments, LiF solid was added to flasks containing
solutions of BeFo in H20.

The mixtures of MSRE fuel and of coolant were stirred at room temper-
ature and at controlled temperatures up to 90°C. Separate mixtures cof
LiF and of LigBeFh in contact with BeFo solutions. were rocked at controlled
temperatures of 250 + 0.2° and 60° f 0.3°C and were refluxed at tempera-
- tures a little over 100°C. The latter temperatures were those at which
the solutions boiled at atmospheric pressure.

Samples of the solution phases were obtained after periods of time
varying from 4 hours to 28 days. The concentrations of lithium were
determined by flame photometry, and fluoride by pyrohydrolysis and sub-
sequent acid-base titration of the distillate.® Zirconium, uranium,
thorium, and beryllium were analyzed spectrophotometrically by the pyro-
catechol violet method, thiocyanate method, thoron procedure, and the
differential p-nitrobenzeneazo-orcinol method, respectively. Beryllium
was determined also by counting of radioactive Be-7 and comparison of
the number of counts with those from an aliquot portion of a standard

solution containing Be-7. Selected solid phases were separated from the

solution phases and dried between sheets of filter paper. These solids
were examined by means of a petrographic microscope; LiF was identified

through its x-ray diffraction pattern.”

3. DISSOLUTION OF LigBeF, in H20

The concentrations of Li, Be, and F found in solution, when excess
LisBeF, solid was mixed with Hy0 at 25°C, are given in Fig. 1 as a func-
tion of time. Based on the data for lithium and beryllium, it appeared
that equilibrium was attained at least within six days and perhaps sooner.
The changes in the compositions of the solutions (revealing a higher
ratio of beryllium to lithium than that in the original solid) require
the appearance of some solid which is richer in lithium than the starting
material and which is presumably LiF. The data suggest that an invariant
point may have been established. Nevertheless, these results are in
contradiction to the solubilities of LiF and of LipBeFp in BeFp-HpO solu~-
tions given in the table and in Fig. 5. It is possible that, although
equilibrium appeared to have been attained, a relatively inert coating
of a new solid on the surface of the LipBeF, solid may have formed and
prevented further dissolution of Li BeF,.

The concentrations of Ii, Be, and F found in solution are given in
Fig. 2 as a function of temperature. Included in Fig. 2 are some experi-
mental values by F. H. Perfect’ which were obtained by analyses of liquid
phases after approximately 24 hours of mixing with solid. Perfect

commented that the results were not entirely satisfactory and may have
been complicated by the appearance of two separate solubility cwrves--
one for a hydrated salt Li,BeF, -xH,0 and one for an anhydrous salt. In
a further comment, with reference to a patent,” it was felt that the
anhydrous salt either dissolved very slowly in cold water, had a low
solubility, or had both a low rate of dissolution and low solubility.

In our own experiments, mixtures of solution and LipBeF, solid were equi-
librated 4 hours to 3 days before taking samples of the solution phases

for analyses. Also included are the data obtained at 25°C (from Fig. 1).

4. DISSOLUTION OF MSRE FUEL MIXTURE

The analytical results from the run with fuel mixture at 25°C as a
function of time are shown in Fig. 3. As with the reactor coolant, equi-
librium appeared to be attained within six days. Nevertheless, a
consistent increase in concentration of lithium and uranium was noted.

In this experiment it was presumed that tetravalent uranium from the
solid phases had been converted to the hexavalent state in the solution
phase’ by the action of oxygen from the air, and also that an inert
coating may have hindered further dissolution of the solid phase.

In Fig. 4 are shown analytical results for solution concentrations
of U, 14, Th, Zr, and Be as a function of temperature. The time of equi-
libration at each temperature before sampling was one day. Also included

analytical results from samples taken upon stepwise lowering of the tem=-
perature of the solution-solid mixture consistently gave higher values

for the solution concentrations of the various components. It is believed
that equilibrium either was not reached on cooling or had never been
reached.

In view of the appreciable uranium concentration found in solution
under these conditions, it has been recommended that neutron poisons be
present in any water which could mix with the fuel in the event of a
reactor accident.

5. A PORTION OF THE SYSTEM LiF-BeF,-H,0
AT 25, 60 AND NEAR 100°C

Compositions of liquid phases of BeFp and Hy0 which were rocked or
refluxed at several temperatures in contact separately with LiF and with
LioBeF, are given in the table. The initial reagents and times of rock-
ing or refluxing are specified; also, some designations of solid phases
are given, In all cases a solid or solids were present. When these data
are plotted as the composition of IiF vs that of BeFy (Fig. 5) and con-
sideration is given to the times of mixing and temperature cycling, then
there appears to be metastability of LiF solid phase in equilibrium with
solutions containing high concentrations of BeF,- We believe that the
continuous curves which are drawn on Fig. 5 represent stable equilibria
and the dashed curves show the solubility of a metastable solid. Data
which fall between these two curves represent in-progress changes bet-
ween metastable and stable conditions. The only salt definitely identi-
fied by the x-ray diffraction method was LiF. Another salt, proposed

to be some compound of LiF and BeF,, was not identified by optical

present, other than IiF, could be formed only from LiF and BeF2-Hy0 solu.

was present. By means of optical petrography, birefringent refraction
lines were observed for the unknown solid.> Similar lines are observed
for LisBeF, solid.
