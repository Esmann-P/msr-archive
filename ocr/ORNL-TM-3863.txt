DESIGN AND OPERATION OF A FORCED-CIRCULATION CORROSION
TEST FACILITY (MSR-FCL-1) EMPLOYING HASTELLOY N
ALLOY AND SODIUM FLUOROBORATE SALT

W. R. Huntley P. A. Gnadt

- ABSTRACT

A forced-circulstion loop (MSR-FCL-1) was assembled and
operated to evaluate the compatibility of standard Hastelloy N
with sodium fluoroborate—sodium fluoride eutectic (NaBF,-8
mole % NaF) coolant salt at operating conditions expected in
the Molten-Sglt Reactor Experiment coolant circuit. The salt
velocity in 1/2-in.-0D, 0.042-in.-wall tubing was nominally
10 fps. Hastelloy N corrosion specimens were exposed to the
circulating salt at temperatures of 950, 1030, and 1090°F.

The test has operated more than 10,000 hr at these conditions
and tests are continuing. This report is mainly concerned
with the design, febrication, and operation of the facility.
Special problems related to accommodating the BF vapor pres-
sure of the salt were resolved, and the sodium fluoroborste
demonstrated heat transfer characteristics that could be
approximated by conventional correlations such as the Dittus-
Boelter equation. Corrosion rates generally decreased with
opersting time; for example, the lowest corrosion rate ob-
served for the 1090°F corrosion specimens during a 2900-hr
test interval was equivalent to 0.0003 in. of uniform material
removal per year.

Keywords: molten salt, corrosion, sodium fluoroborate,
Hastelloy N, design, operation, centrifugal pump, mass trans-
fer, heat transfer, MSRE, unattended operation.

1. INTRODUCTION

The sodium fluorcborate (NaBF,—8 mole % NaF) salt mixture is of
interest as a coolant for the secondary circuit of molten-salt reactors
because of its low cost (~$0.50/1b) and relatively low melting point
(725°F). Screening tests in thermal-convection loops! indicate no seri-
ous problems due to reactions between the salt and the proposed reactor

containment material, Hastelloy N.

The forced-circulation loop described here (MSR-FCL-1l) represents a “
more sophisticated test of the compatibility of the candidate salt and -
Hastelloy N. High coolant velocities were used, and the design thermal
gradient was applied to the system. The results from this test will
assist in the evaluation of the corrosion resistance of the Hastelloy N
containment materiel and the mass transfer interactions of the contain-
ment material and salt. Detailed metallurgical results will be presented

separately.
2. DESIGN AND FABRICATION

2.1 Design Criteria

The MSR-FCL-1 test was designed to evaluate the use of sodium fluoro-
‘borate? salt in contact with Hastelloy N alloy containment material at
conditions simulating the secondary-coolant (high-temperature side of the
steam generator) circuit of molten-salt reactors. One objective of the -
test was to develop the technology associated with the new salt ry using
it in a relatively complex operating system. «
The BFy vapor pressure of the sodium fluoroborate salt is higher
(e.g., 1h mn Hg at the maximum loop temperature of 1090°F) than the
vapor pressure of other salts developed for use in molten-salt reactors.
Accommodating the BF; vapor pressure of the salt at elevated temperature
in MSR-FCL-1 was a major design problem, since BF; 1s a noxious gas and’
a design to provide adequate ventilation for personnel protection was
required.
An existing system design® was used as a basis for MSR-FCL-1. Cen-
trifugal pumps, air blowers, electrical transformers, and miscellaneous
control equipment used in previous corrosion tests of this type were

 

2Unless otherwise indicated the term sodium fluoroborate will be .

used in this report to designate the NaBF,—8 mole % NaF eutectic mixture.

available. The reuse of the available instrument and control design and
the existing equipment resulted in a system of limited flexibility; how-
ever, these design features had been previously tested and funds were
only available for minimum redesign and fabrication of new equipment.

The hydraulic characteristics of the existing pump were a specific limit-
ing factor on loop performance.

The facility was originally designed to operate for 10,000 hr and
to provide a maximum bulk fluid salt temperature of 1125°F, a bulk fluid
AT of 275°F at a velocity of 7 1/4 fps (3 gpm), and a total heat input
of 94 kW. However, the loop was not operated at these conditions. After
the original design was completed and before the loop fabrication was
complete, the test conditions were changed to more nearly match the tem-
perature profile of the coolant circuit of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experi-
ment (MSRE), which was then operating. This modification to program plans
was a prelude to the proposed introduction of sodium fluoroboraste into the
secondary-coolant circuit of the MSRE. The test facility was operated at
a maximum bulk fluid temperature of 1090°F, a bulk fluid AT of 14O°F at a
velocity of 10 fps (4 gpm), and a total heat input of 53 kW.

Corrosion specimens were introduced into the system at appropriate

“locations to obtaln accurate weight change, chemistry change, and metal-
lographic data. Periodic removal and reinsertion of the specimens were
specified at approximately 2000-hr intervals. Salt sampling at approxi-
mately 500-hr intervals was specified to permit chemical analyses nec-
essary for characterization of corrosion processes occurring during
operation. :

Protective instrumentation and an auxiliary power supply weré pro-
vided in an attempt to prevent accidentsl freezing of the salt due to
loss of normal electrical supply or a pump stoppage. Originally this
protective system was to be continuously monitored by facility operators;
however, evening and night shift operator coverage was discontinued
during the latter part of the operating period, and the facility hed to
be modified for unattended operation.
 

 

2.2 General Design Information

A simplified schematic drawing of the test loop is shown in Fig. 1,
and an isometric drawing of the equipment is shown in Fig. 2. A complete
flowsheet is included as Appendix A. Sodium fluoroborate is discharged
downward from the salt pump (model LFB) at a temperature of 950°F and at
a flow rate of 4 gpm. The salt enters the first of two heat input sections
and is heated to 1030°F; flows over three Hastelloy N metallurgical speci-
mens; continues through the second heat input section, where the bulk
fluid temperature is increased to 1090°F; and: flows. over three additional
metallurgical specimens before being cooled in a heat exchanger to 950°F.
The cooled salt then flows over two more metallurgical specimens before
returning to the inlet of the pump. .

The salt inventory is stored in a sump tank located below the primary
piping system. A high-purity helium gas blanket is maintained above the
salt surfaces in this tank and in the pump to minimize salt contamination.
A dip leg in the sump tank allows the liquid salt to be forced by helium
overpressure into the circulating system. The sump tank is designed to
contain approximately twice the salt volume to be circulated. A freeze
valve serves to isolate the salt in the circulating system from the sump”
tank inventory. This valve consists of a cooling air line installed
around the 1/4-in.-0D, 0.035-in.-wall tubing connecting the sump tank to
the circulating system. Piping of the circulating system is principally
1/2-in.-0D by 0.042-in.-wall Hastelloy N tubing.

No direct flow measuring equipment is provided in the circulating-
salt system; provisions are made to measure the flow calorimetrically.
Three calibrated Chromel-Alumel thermocouples are installed at both the
inlet and exit of one of the heater sections. By determining the thermal

losses from this section at several temperature levels with no salt in
the system, it is possible to obtain the net electrical heat input during
operation. Flow rates can then be calculated from the net electrical )
power input and the observed temperature rise in the salt as it passed
through the heater.

Engineering parameters of the system are shown in Teble 1, and com-
position and physical properties of sodium fluorcborate are shown in
Table 2.

In addition, a sheet-metsl enclosure is provided around the salt

piping and heat exchanger to protect operating personnel from gross

liquid leakage. The system piping is considered sufficiently reliable

to preclude the need for special exhaust ventilation from this enclosure

‘for protection against BF; leakage. Favorable ventilation conditions
exist in the test area, which has a 50- ft-high ceiling and continuous

exhaust ventilation.
The test loop is shown in Fig. 3 during installation of the heaters

and thermocouples. Figure L shows the. completed installation.

2.3 Detailed Design and Fabrication

2. 3. 1 Heater

The heat input into the salt is accomplished by resistance heating

“two sections of the system piping, each approximately 105 in. long.

Voltage is applied between two lugs attached to the ends of each heated
length of pipe. Control is common to both of the heat input sections
(see Fig. 2).

2.3.2 Cooler

Heat is removed from the system by a heat exchanger composed of an
air-cooled, 26-ft-long, 19-in.-diam coil of 1/2-in.-OD by 0.042-in.-wall
tubing to which 1/16-in.-thick circular nickel fins are attached (see
Fig. 3). These fins are brazed to the tubing with Coast Metals 52 fur-

nace braze alloy. The finned coil is inside a sheet-metal housing which

serves as the cooling alr duct.

The salt side pressure drop, as limited by the capacity of the salt

“pump, prohibits the use of a longer heat exchanger coil. Variations in
fin diameter and spacing are. used to provide a higher heat flux at the

"hot end of the cooler. This geometry creates a flattened salt wall tem-

perature profile which makes possible maximum heat removal without cooling
the wall at the cold end of the unit below the 725°F melting point of the
salt. [This feature was important during the design stages, when the
expected drop in the bulk fluid temperature was from 1125 to 850°F. It

became less important when the proposed opersting conditions were changed
to simulate the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment coolant circuit temperature
profile (1090-950°F).]

The cooler is resistance heated during preheating of the loop. This
resistance heat system is also used to keep the salt above the melting
point during loss of normal building power. Hastelloy N lugs are installed
at the inlet, midpoint, and exit of the coil for attachment of three
electrical leads. The lugs project through holes in the air duct to give
access to the electrical connections. During a loss of normal power the
voltage is supplied to the central lug of the coil from a diesel-generstor
unit used for emergency electrical supply.

A hinged door, provided on the air exit side of the cooler housing,
is closed to reduce the hest losses during preheating and is equipped to
close automatically during a power outage. The top side of this door
and the four sides of the air plenum are insulated with Johns Manville
Kaowool thermal insulation to further reduce the heat losses. . This insu-
lation is also used to plug the holes where the electrical lugs penetrate
the air duct.

Air to the cooler is supplied through appropriate ducting by a
model 200-A-1 American blower with a 3-hp 1725-rpm motor which provides
a maximum sir flow of 3200 cfm air through the ductwork. However, in
normal operstion the air flow required is about 1000 cfm. A throttling
damper is provided to regulate the flow.

Selected engineering data on the actual performance of the cooler
are shown in Table 1, along with other engineering parameters of the

system.

2.3.3 Salt pump

The salt pump, model LFB, used in this corrosion test is shown in
Fig. 5. It is a centrifugal sump pump designed at ORNL and features a
downward discharge. The pump has an overhung vertical shaft, two grease-
sealed ball bearings, and an oil-lubricasted mechanical face seal above
the salt liquid level and just below the lower ball bearing. Shaft and
segl cooling are provided by oil which flows downwsrd through the hollow

shaft through a rotary seal. The oil leaves through holes in the shaft
located just above the top side of the mechanical face seal. The pump
requires a gas purge as described in Section 2.3.5. Pump performance
data taken with water are shown in Fig. 6. The model LFB salt pump was
selected for this particular test since several pumps were availsble and
over 400,000 cumulative hours of successful operation had been experi-
enced in many previous applications at Oak Ridge National Laboratory.
The head capability of the pump is somewhat lower than desired, and the
acceptance of this limitation resulted in a maximum liquid velocity of
10 fps.

The pump tank contains the only free liquid surface in the circu-
lating system during normal operation with the dump tank isolated by a
freeze valve. The pump is located at the highest point in the flow cir-
cuit, and the pump tank acts as a liquid expansion volume. The liquid
level in the tank is indicated by two spark plug probes which have
Hastelloy N extensions welded to the center electrodes to make contact
with the liquid salt at preset elevations. A salt sampling apparatus
is provided at the pump tank, as described in Section 2.3.4.

2.3.4 Salt sampler

A cross section of the molten-salt sampler is shown in Fig. 7. It
is used to remove salt samples from the pump tank at approximately 500-
hr intervals during the test program. (The test loop operation is not
interrupted during sampling.) The sampler consists of a dip tube with a
small copper bucket attached on the lower end which is lowered into the
molten salt in the pump tank. Vacuum and inert-gas back-filling con-
nections are provided so that the sampler assembly can be attached to
or removed from the pump tank without contaminating the salt inventory.
A Swagelok fitting with Teflon ferrules acts as the packing gland on the
1/4-in.-0D dip tube. The Swagelok nut is loosened, as required, to per-
mit raising or lowering of the dip tube. The original bucket design had
a capacity of about 2 g of sodium fluoroborate. A second separate com-
partment which holds about 0.5 g was added later to provide a separate

sample for an oxygen analysis.

2.3.5 BFa system

A relatively complex tubing system is provided to supply He-BF;
mixtures for use in purging shaft seal oil leakage from the salt pump.
A simplified schematic of the system is shown in Fig. 8, and the com-
plete system is shown in the flowsheet of Appendix A. Special pressure
regulators from Matheson Company with chemically coated nickel bodies
and Monel diaphragms are used on gas cylinders containing BF; . These
materials are used to resist attack by HF in case of moisture contami-
nation of the BF; gas. All gaskets, valve packings, or soft valve seats
were of Teflon or Kel-F, which are also resistant to attack by HF. A
standard 200-ft° capacity gas cylinder supplies a gas flow of about
80 cc/min to the reference side of a thermal conductivity cell; the gas
flow then continues on to the pump. The gas flow to the pump is used
to purge seal oil leakage from a catch basin and carry it to an oil
trap, from which the oil can be drained manually as required. The gas
flow then returns to the thermal conductivity cell, where a comparative
megsurement is made to detect any change of BF; concentration in the
helium.

It was originally thought that a 3% mixture of BF; and helium (for
a 950°F pump bowl temperature) would be necessary for the purge flow
through the seal oil leakage catch basin of the salt pump. This require-
ment was brought about by the fact that the seal oll leakage catch basin
and the gas space sbove the salt level in the pump are interconnected,
and thus a possible path for loss of BF; from the salt is created. The
use of a purge-gas mixture having the same composition as the gas in
the pump bowl would preclude removal of BF; and a resultant change in
salt composition. However, it was found in actual operation, as discussed.
in Section 3.2, that the use of He-BF, mixture was unnecessary. Since
the loss of BF; from the pump in a pure helium purge was too low to
Justify the complications attending BF; addition, a pure helium purge
was used throughout most of the test.

Most of the seal purge system is fabricated of 1/4-in.-0D by
0.035-in.-wall copper tubing. Brass compression fittings are used exten-
sively. Check valves are used to preclude BF; backflow into helium supply

lines or backflow of atmospheric moisture into the BF; -He vent lines.

2.3.6 Fill and drain tank

The fill and drain tank is fabricated from a 23 3/16-in. length of
Hastelloy N, 5-in., sched-lLO pipe with 1/2-in.-thick flat heads. The
five pipe risers located on the cylindrical surface of the tank provide
for salt addition and removal, spark plug level indication, and gas
pressurization. A drain line is provided at the bottom of the tank as
an additional path for salt removal. The tank is electrically insulated
from ground to prevent the flow of electrical current from the main loop
tubing, which is resistance heated during certain periods of off-normal

operation.

2.3.7 Corrosion specimen design

 

Corrosion specimens (see Fig. 1) are used to monitor corrosion rates
at the points of maximum, minimum, and intermediate bulk fluid tempera-
tures. The Hastelloy N specimens are approximately 2 5/8 in. long,

0.250 in. wide, and 0.030 in. thick. A total of eight specimens are
mounted in the three locations. Details of the corrosion specimens
design and mounting arrangement are shown in Fig. 9. The specimens are
mounted on the Hastelloy N stringers, inserted into the 1/2-in. tubing,
and tack welded into position. The section of 1/2-in. tubing containing

the specimens is then butt welded into the system piping.

2.3.8 Flectrical system

The electrical power system is shown schematically in Fig. 10.

Power is supplied to the test facility from a L60-V, three-phase, delta-
connected building supply. A separate connection from a diesel-generator
provides emergency power to some of the equipment in the event of a
failure to the normal building supply.

Upon failure of the normal supply voltage, the diesel-generator is
automatically started, and an automatic transfer switch connects the
emergency power supply to the facility. When normal power becomes avail-
able, the automatic switch returns the system load to this supply.

The heat input for normal operation is provided by two resistance-

heated sections. Voltage is supplied to these sections through a

saturable reactor, which in turn supplies g 110-kVA high-current trans-
former. Temperature is controlled on these sections by a variation in
the impedance of the saturable reactor.

During normal operation the circuit breaker, shown in Fig. 2, is
closed and the electrical potential is applied between the two sets of
lugs (A&B, C&D). This circuit breaker is opened manually to permit pre-
heating of the piping system (except cooler) and is automatically opened
to provide heat to all the system piping (except cooler) under emergency
conditions. When the circuit breaker is open, the electrical potential
is applied between lugs A and C, and the resulting two parallel electri-
cal resistance heating circuits keep the system temperature above the
freezing point of the salt. Power measuring instrumentation is provided
to determine the heat input to the system.

A separately controlled resistance-heated circuit is provided for
preheating the cooler. When normal power is lost, automatic controls
also apply electric potential to this section of piping to prevent freez-
ing of the salt.

| Additional electric supply sources are provided for the salt pump
motor, lube oil pumps, the cooler blower motor, the BF; cublcle exhaust

blower, instrument power, and miscellaneous lighting and auxiliaries.

2.3.9 Instrumentation and control

 

The salt pump is driven by a 5-hp 44O-V motor connected to a
variable-speed magnetic clutch. The clutch output torque is delivered

to the pump by V-belts. The speed of the coupled units is regulated by

varying the supply voltage to the magnetic coupling. The normal supply

is from an electronic unit furnished with the magnetic clutch. In the
event of the loss of the normal clutch control voltage, the loop is
automatically placed in a standby (preheat) condition.

Pump speed is measured by a tachometer built into the magnetic
clutch, and alarms are provided for low and high speed. The pump speed
is checked with a "Strobe" light at the beginning of each test run to
insure that the desired speed is obtained.

~ The loop temperatures are controlled by a Leeds and Northrup

"Speedomax-H" controller, which senses changes in loop temperature and

23

transmits a signal to the saturable reactor to increase or decrease voltage
applied to the two resistance-heated sections of the piping.

Controls are also provided to close the outlet damper on the radiator
air duct, stop the blower motor and the salt pump, and transfer the main
heat input to the preheat mode in the event of any of the following off-
normal conditions:

1. low clutch speed,

2. salt high temperature,

3. salt low temperature,

Lk, loss of normal pover to the facility,

5. low lube oil flow to the salt pump.

Bypass switches are provided around most of these instruments to facili-
tate startup and to provide a means of testing the workability of the

control system during normal operation.

2.4 Quality Assurance

Although the design of the salt circulating system was essentially
the same as had been used on a previous program, it was reviewed by the
ORNL Pressure Vessel Review Committee.

Complete histories of the Hastelloy N used in the pressure-containing
portion of the loop were documented, except for the salt pump, which had
been febricated and assembled in accordance with ORNL Reactor Division
Standard Procedures in force at the time. Although records of the mate-
rials or welding were not availsble, the administrative procedures in
effect at the time of fabrication provided assurance of the integrity of
the pump. Since many of these pumps had been operated and hundreds of
thousands of hours of experience with this type of equipment had been
accumlated, it was felt that the reliability of the units was suffi-
ciently established to warrant their use without complete documentation.

The inspection of the materials used to fabricate the salt-containing
portions of the system other than the pump included ultrasonic tests and
dye-penetrant checks in accordance with ORNL Metals and Cersmics Division
specifications MET-NDT 1 through 4.
 

 

2k

Welding of components and assembly into the system were conducted
in accordance with Metals and Ceramics Division specification PS-23, =
-25, and -35, which include welder qualification procedures, weld joint
design, and welding parameter limitations. “Welds were inspected by x-
ray examination end dye-penetrant methods stated in Metals and Ceramics
Division specification MET-WR 200 and 201.

Material and cleaning requirements invoked during fabrication in-
cluded degreasing with perchloroethylene vapor, followed by water and
alcohol rinses. Before each part was welded into the system, it was
-agaln wiped with an alcohol-soaked cloth. Both the part and the cleaning
cloth were visually examined for evidence of foreign material.

All cleanliness, material, and weld inspections were made by person-
nel other than those having the responsibility for fabrication and assem-
bly. Weld reports, which included the inspections and materials certifi-
cations, are on file with the Inspection Engineering Department.

Helium leak tests were made on the completed piping assembly prior
to installstion of the pump rotary assembly into the pump bowl. Iesk
testing was done in accordance with ORNL Inspection Engineering Quality
Assurance Procedure 7. No detectable leaks were observed.

All wiring was given a terminal-to-terminal check prior to energizing.
Each control function was checked manually to insure that the protective
schemes were operating properly prior to filling of the system.

Operational procedures, including abnormal condition procedures,
were prepared to assist the operators. A complete description of the
operation of the control system was prepared (see Appendix B), and train-

ing sessions were conducted for the personnel.
3. OPERATING EXPERIENCE

The test loop has been operated for 10,335 hr at design conditions
for an additional 1135 hr at off-design tempersture. A chart of the
‘operating history is shown in Fig. 11. For most of this time the system
was operated at 1090°F maximum bulk fluid temperature and 950°F minimum
bulk fluid temperature. Figure 12 is a typical temperature profile of
the system. The inner wall temperatures are estimsted from heat transfer
calculation.

After raising the sodium fluoroborate from the sump tank into the
salt piping proper and establishing the freeze valve, the system is
started. The salt pump is started and the speed is adjusted to approxi-
mately 5000 rpm. The main power is transferred to the two resistance-
heated piping sections by closing the circuit breaker, and the loop tem-
perature is increased by adjusting the temperature controller. The sys-
tem differential temperature is established by starting the blower and
adjusting the damper in the air system duct. For the initial startup a
flushing charge of salt was run in the salt piping for 478 hr, after
vhich it was discarded and the working charge of salt was installed.

The reliability of the system during the initial 10,000 hr of op-
eration was very good, but after this time several difficulties were
encountered. A pump bearing failure occurred, resulting in damage to
the pump impeller. Chips were rubbed from the impeller and deposited in
the salt piping. Extensive repairs to remove these chips from the loop
piping were necessary. In addition, fatigue failure of an oil line
resulted in an oil fire, requiring extensive repairs. Subsequently, the
loop piping was ruptured during an inadvertent overheating transient
caused by a defective control thermocouple and an operator error during
the replacement of the thermocouple. Tsble 3 lists the interruptions
that occurred during the operation period, over half of which (15) were
due to problems with component auxiliaries such as the pump rotary oil
seal and drive motor and the blower shaft bearings. Replacement bearings
in the blower and blower drive motor were required about every six months.

3.1 Heat Transfer Performance of Sodium Fluorcborate

Since no published heat transfer data were gvailable for the sodium
fluoroborate salt, the heat transfer characteristics of sodium fluoroborate
were measured in the MSR-FCL-1. Provisions for these heat transfer mea-
surements were not part of the original design criteria, and the tests
were made with existing instrumentation which was not highly sophisticated.
Also considerable uncertainty existed in available physical property data,
particularly on viscosity and thermal conductivity; so the absolute accu-

racy of results obtained is questionable.

The heat transfer dats were obtained in one -of the resistance-heated:
sections of the loop piping. This section was 105 in. in length and
0.410 in. in inside diameter. The tubing inside diameter was determined
by micrometers, and wall thickness measurements were made with a model 1k
Bronson Vidi-gage. The flow rate through the tubing was measured calori-
metrically by observing the power input and the tempersture rise of the
salt. Heat losses at various temperature levels had been determined pre-
viously. The specific heat data for the salt presented in Table 2 was
among the better defined physical property data and had an uncertainty of
+2%. The flow velocity was calculated using salt density data with an
uncertainty of 5%. Power input measurements were made with instruments
of 10.5% accuracy.

The tempersture measurements were made with 1/16-in.-OD stainless-
steel-sheathed, insulated-junction, Chromel-Alumel thermocouples. Bulk
fluid temperatures at the heater inlet and exit were each measured by

. three calibrated thermocouples. Ten thermocouples located along the

105-in. length were used to obtain the wall temperature in the hegted
region.

29

All thermocouples were electrically insulated from the tubing wall
to preclude an electrical path along the stainless steel sheaths, since
all portions of the piping were above ground potential during resistance
heating. Two layers of quartz tape provided electrical isolation from
the piping and also served to thermally insulate the thermocouples from
the pipe wall. The ends of the thermocouples were installed in a 180°
arc around the quartz-tape-covered tube and held in place with a band of
shimstock spot welded to itself. Two inches of "Hi-Temp" diatomaceous
earth formed the thermal insulation for the piping. The detail on ther-
mocouple installation is presented to'emphasize that the configuration
was not ideal for accurate temperature measurement . The error between
insulated thermocouples and thermocouples installed directly on the pipe
wall was later determined to be less than 10°F. The overall AT from
pipe wall to bulk fluid ranged up to 100°F, so the thermocouple error of
10°F represents sbout a 10% uncertainty.

Performance data were obtained at heater inlet temperatures from
974% to 1060°F and heater exit temperatures from 1038 to 1170°F. The
Reynolds modulus ranged from 5500 to 51,400, and heat fluxes ranges from
15,750 to 160,000 Btu hr 'ft™2. The measured heat transfer coefficients
ranged from 267 to 2130 Btu hr 'ft72(°F)™!. The data obtained correlated
well with the Dittus-Boelter equation as shown in Fig. 13 (using recently
determined physical property values from Table 2). Although no statisti-
cal analysis has been made, it is estimated that the error in the mea-
surements is less than 20%. These heat transfer data constituted the
first demonstration that sodium fluoroborate performs as an ordinary heat

transfer fluid.

3.2 BF; Handling

The LFB salt pump was designed to operate with approximately 80 ce/
min of helium purge through the pump shaft seal region to remove traces
of oil leaking through the rotating face seal (see Fig. 5). The vapor
pressure of the NaBF, component of the salt mixture, as shown in Fig. 1h,
produces a BFs partial pressure gbove the salt level in the pump bowl.

Since the helium purge tends to carry some of the BF; out of the system,

it is possible to change the salt composition by gradual depletion of
the volatile constituent. As indicated by the NaBF,-NaF phase diagram
(Fig. 15), the freezing point of the salt mixture changes drastically
with a change in composition near the eutectic. Therefore this problem
needed further consideration.

The helium purge, as originally installed, was through the seal re-~
gion of the pump, which was loosely coupled through an annulus around
the pump shaft to the helium gas space above the sglt level in the pump
bowl. It was assumed that BF; vapors from the salt mixture would diffuse
up the shaft annulus into the seal region and be carried away by the purge
gas. To avoid the problem of BF; depletion in the salt mixture, a system
was installed to permit blending BFs into the helium purge to produce a
BFz concentration in the purge gas equivalent to the concentration in the
pump bowl. Thus, no net loss of BF; in the system would occur.

The possibility of chemical interaction of the BF in the purge gas
with the oil in the seal region also had to be considered, and preliminary
tests were run to see if a problem existed. The amount of BF; in helium
required to sustain the 92-8% salt mixture was calculated to be 1%, with
a pump bowl temperature of 850°F, or 3% with the pump at 950°F. Mixtures
of these two gases were prepared by adding the proper amount of BF; to
bottles containing helium; however, confirmatory analyses for the concen-
tration of BF in helium were unsuccessful. Checks with commercial sup-
pliers of mixed gases revealed that there were no economical methods for
determining the BF; concentrations in helium in the 1 to 3% range. The
BF; gas adsorbs on the walls of analytical equipment, resulting in gross
inaccuracies in analytical results. Attempts at confirmatory analysis
were abandoned, and the concentrations were assumed to be those predicted
by the mixing calculations based on volume, temperatures, and pressures.

Tests were conducted to examine the effect of mixtures of 1 and 3%
BF; in helium of the Gulfspin 35 pump oil under conditions which would
simulate its use in the pump seal-oil purge system. The results for the
1% BF; mixture indicated that the seal leakage oil would not be affected
deleteriously by contact with the mixture. Some discoloration and an
increase in acidity were noted in the oil after only a few hours of

exposure to the gas mixture; however, viscosity changes over a long

period gave no reason to suspect that the small passages of the pump seal
purge system would become plugged with degraded oil.

Results of two separate room-tempersture tests of approximately one
week's duration using the 3% BF; mixture with an oil leakage flow rate of
10 cc/day and a gas flow rate of 80 cc/min indicated that the seal oil
purge line would probably become plugged during loop operation; thus use
of this 3% mixture for purging was abandoned. A black sludge, formed in
the test setup which simulated the pump catch basin, eventually plugged
a 1/8-in.-diam port (see Fig. 16). In these tests the oil removed from
the test apparatus was extremely acidic, with a pH from 1.0 to 1.5.

Attempts to determine the composition of the oil sludge were unsue-
cessful. Infrared spectrophotometric examination indicated that traces
of water were probsbly removed from the piping system by the sparging
gas and that the acid formed by the BF; -water reaction had attacked one
or more of the ingredients of the oil to form the sludge. The BFs; also
produced, either as products of degradation or by direct addition to some
component or components, new materials not found in unexposed oil. No
further effort was made to characterize the degraded oil.

To eliminate BF; in the seal purge stream and the resulting oil deg-
radation, the purge route through the pump bowl was changed to provide a
pure helium purge gas flow down the pump shaft. It was thought that by
providing this purge, helium could be used to remove the legkage oil from
the oil catch basin in the pump and the helium flow down the shaft would
deter (except for back diffusion) the BFy vapor from reaching the oil.
This purge path required the addition of a new outlet gas line from the
pump bowl and a new line for BF; addition into the pump bowl. The BF;
addition was required since the helium flow down the shaft and across
the BF; vapor space in the pump would carry off BF; vapors in even greater
quantities than had been anticipated with the purge only through the face
seal region. After one day of operation the outlet line from the pump

‘vapor space plugged with reaction products from the salt, oil, and BF.

As an expedient, a decision was made to return to the original design
for purging the pump seal with no BF; addition to the purge stream. The
helium was connected to the pump seal purge line, and the effluent was

carefully monitored for BF; contemination. Measurements from the thermal

conductivity cell indicated that the helium gas (80 crf /min) leaving the
pump oil catch basin was contaminated with approximately 0.08% BF; . This
indicated that the amount of BF, removed from the NaBF; salt during the
scheduled 10,000-hr operation would not significantly alter the salt com-
position. Had the BF; depletion been significantly high, plans were to
replenish the BF by intermittent gas additions to the salt.

During calibration of a thermal conductivity cell which was to be
used to measure the concentration of BF; in the effluent line from the
seal purge line, a 1/h-in.-OD copper tubing vent line plugged. A 3%
mixture of BF; in helium had been purged through the conductivity cell
and vented to atmosphere in a ventilation system. Reaction products of
moist air and BF; completely sealed the end of the tube and stopped the
seal purge (see Fig. 17). An acidic solution was found in the vertical
line immediately adjacent to the discharge end of the tube, evidently
formed when the BF; gas came in contact with moisture in the air. Acid
was also formed on the ventilation hood in the vicinity of the BF, -He
vent. Enough acid was present to form droplets on the lower edge of the
hood, which demonstrated that a suitable BF; "scrubber" is required for
future systems where long-term, reliable venting of significant BF; con-
centrations must be maintained.

The low BFy concentration in the helium purge from the final con-
figuration of the shaft seal purge system resulted in little acid accu-
mulation at the gas purge line outlet. Inversion of the purge line out-
let port and the addition of a bucket-type catch basin helped to reduce
the plugging problem at the end of the purge line. No accumulation of
acid on the air exhaust ducts was visible, but acid reaction products
were noted at the end of the purge line. As the buildup of these products

was noted, the open end of the copper tubing was either cleaned or cut off.

3.3 Salt Pump Operation

The major problems to be resolved by the use of the model LFB pump
in this test program involved (1) the effect of the BF; partial pressure
on the oil in the seal leakage catch basin and (2) the bearing and oil

segl performance at 5000 rpm for sustained periods of operation. The

problems relating to BF; reactions with the Gulfspin 35 oil in the pump
are described in Section 3.2. In addition the bearing and seal lifetime
was a point of concern since g pump of this type had not been used in
applications requiring thousands of hours of operation at the relatively
high speed of 5000 rpm. A series of identical pumps had been operated
at speeds around 3000 rpm and had demonstrated adequate relisbility dur-
ing about 450,000 hr of operation.%

Normal operstion conditions for the pump were as follows:

Salt inlet temperature, °F 950

Salt flow rate, gpm L

Pump speed, rpm : 5000
Coolant oil Gulfspin-35
Coolant oil temperature, °F 110

Pump tank pressure, psig 7.0

Pump tank cover gas Helium
Purge gas for seal leakage Helium
Purge gas flow rate, cc/min 80

The pump was removed for routine maintenance at approximately 2000-
hr intervals to install new bearings. These bearings have ag relatively
short lifetime expectancy of about 4000 hr at 5000 rpm. Normally this
maintenance period coincided with removal of the corrosion specimens from
the loop piping. However, three bearing failures occurred during opera-
tion despite the bearing replacement schedule.

The polymerizgtion of oil in the catch basin by reaction with BF;
was no problem during the 2000-hr operating periods. The leaking seal
oil was darkened by contact with the BFs and a black coating formed on
the bottom of the catch basin, but no significant plugging occurred.

This could be a problem, however, in a system where periodic removal and
cleaning are not possible or perhaps where higher BF; concentrations are
present. The seal oil catch basin at the conclusion of a typical 2000-hr

run is shown in Fig. 18.

The seal oil leakage rate has averaged approximately 1 cc/day (see
‘Table 4). The leakage rates were higher than average during short periods

near the end of the test, for reasons that were not discernible.

The seal leakage oil is highly acidic due to its contact with BF;
tests with litmus paper showed a pH of 1 to 1.5. Analytical results of
oil samples revealed small amounts of dissolved boron.

The mechanical face seal appeared in good condition upon disassembly
at the end of each operating period. Although there were no indications
of impending trouble, the seal was changed as a precautionary measure
during each pump maintenance cycle. The upper bearing normally showed

evidence of loss of most of its internal lubricant (grease); the lower

ha

bearing usually appeared in excellent condition, but both bearings were
replaced routinely. The upper bearing is affected by the drive belt
tension and operates under a heavier radial load then the lower bearing.
The condition of the upper bearing was ample evidence that when the salt
pump is belt driven, operation at 5000 rpm for 2000-hr periods was a
maximum practical service limit. -

| The sodium fluoroborate drained easily from the rather complex ge-
ometry of the salt pump. Normal draining procedure consisted in circu-
lating the salt at 1000°F and turning the pump at sbout 1000 rpm as the
‘liquid level was lowered. Typical appearance of the salt-wetted portions
of the pump after a 2000-hr test period is shown in Figs. 19 and 20.

The white deposits are traces of frozen sodium fluoroborate salt.

3.4 Corrosion Specimen Removal

Corrosion specimens are normally removed for examination at approxi-
mately 2000-hr intervals, but when operating problems were encountered
they were removed more frequently. The salt inventory was drained into
the sump tank, and the piping was cooled to room temperature prior to
specimen removal. An argon purge flow was maintained through the loop
during specimen removal to minimize air contamination of the inner sur-
faces of the remaining piping. Tubing cutters were used to remove the
tubing that contained the specimens. Immediately after the specimens
were removed, the open ends of the piping “rere sealed to allow slight
argon pressurization of the system while the specimens were cleaned and
inspected.

The specimen stringers were retrieved from the tubing after grinding
the tack weld which joined them to the inner tubing surface. The grinding
was done carefully so that the specimens could be reinstalled in the same
tubing from which they were recovered. The specimens were cleaned of
residual salt droplets by placing them in warm distilled water for about
1 hr followed by ethyl alcohol washings and alr drying. Specimen weights
were then measured and weight changes calculated.

3.5 Salt Sampling

Salt samples were taken at the start of the test and at about 500-hr
intervals thereafter. The salt was analyzed prior to operation in MSR-
FCL-1 (Table 5); the original salt charge contained high concentrations
of metallic impurities (Fe, Ni, Cr, Mo). The changes in concentration
of these impurities have been rather erratic with time, probably due to
inadvertent moisture contamination of the salt inventory. Some general
trends were observed in the salt analyses after several thousand hours
of operation. For example, the chromium concentration increased from
66 to ~250 ppm and thereafter remained at that general level, the iron
concentration dropped from 4LO7 ppm and remained at about 70 ppm, and the

nickel and molybdenum concentrations were reduced to less than 10 ppm.

A cross-sectional view of the salt sampler is shown in Fig. 7. A
copper bucket is attached to the lower end of the sampler assembly, and
the assembly is then attached to a hydrogen furnace so the bucket is in
the heated zone, and the bucket is fired in hydrogen at 1100°F for 30 min.
After firing, the bucket is protected at all times by an argon: atmosphere
while being moved to the test stand. The sampler container and holder is

attached to a Swagelok coupling on the pump tank riser. The volume be-
tween the two closed ball valves is evacuated and back filled with helium
at least four times before the ball valves are opened to lower the sample
bucket into the pump tank. The bucket is held below the liquid surface
for several minutes to insure filling, after which it is raised above the
lower ball valve and allowed to cool for 30 min. It is then withdrawn to
a position above the upper ball valve, and the valve is closed. The top
portion of the assembly, including the upper ball valve, is disengaged,
and the sample is removed from this assembly within a dry box. The de-

tailed sampling procedure is given in Appendix C.

3.6 Summary of Corrosion Results

 

The weight changes of the corrosion specimens in MSR-FCL-1 are
plotted in Fig. 21 for the entire operating period. The corrorion rate
gradually decreased during the first 9500 hr of operation.

The specimens operating at the highest temperature (1090°F) showed
the greatest weight loss, which was equivalent to a uniform metal removal
rate of 0.001 in./year after 9500 hr. The lowest corrosion rate occurred
during a 2900-hr period (6700 to 9600 hr), when the weight loss rate was
equivalent to 0.0003 in./year. Corrosion rates would probably be reduced
if more highly purified salt were used.

Operation difficulties after 9600 hr resulted in an undetermined
amount of alr and moisture inleakage to the salt system. The drastic
effects of this inleakage are shown by the sharp increase in the weight
change at a salt exposure time of 10,000 hr. This behavior is similar
to that experienced in a thermal convection test loop! when wet air came

in contact with the salt due to a defective cover gas line.

CONCLUSIONS

A materials compatibility loop was assembled and operated for
10,000 hr to investigate corrosion of Hastelloy N by sodium fluoroborate.
Automatic controls adequate to prevent damage to the system due to

upsets during unattended periods of operation were developed and applied.

Corrosion specimens and salt samples were routinely removed for
analysis.

An existing salt pump design and available components were success-
fully adapted for salt circulation. Operation of the salt pump, model
LFB, at 5000 rpm for 2000-hr periods is a maximum practical service con-
dition for the grease-lubricated bearings when the pump is belt driven.

Degradation of the salt pump seal leakage oil due to contact with
low concentrations of BFy has not been a problem at a salt temperature
of 950°F during 2000-hr operating periods. In the LFB pump geometry,
diffusion of BFs vapors from the pump bowl gas space to the seal region
is sufficiently restricted that the BF, concentration does not become
critical. Thus purge flows to prevent this diffusion are not necessary.
This results in a greatly simplified purge gas system.

Heat transfer performance of the sodium fluorcborate sgrees well
with standard heat transfer-correlations.

Sodium fluoroborate exhibits good drainability at about 1000°F.

In well-ventilated areas relatively simple ventilation and shielding
enclosures may be used for low-temperature BF; tubing and gas panels
because of the visual warning provided by the "white smoke" which forms
from the reaction of BF; with moist air.

Sodium fluoroborate is easily contaminated by air when in the molten
state, and great care to prevent air inleaskesge is required in all phases
of operation.

The corrosion rate of Hastelloy N specimens at 1090°F averaged about
0.001 in./year during 9500 hr of operation and was reduced to about
0.0003 in./year during the last uninterrupted 2900 hr of operation. The
corrosion rate increased sharply with air inleakage.

RECOMMENDATIONS

A new system design should be provided for future tests to achieve

improved pump capability and relisbility, higher salt flow velocity,

and a more flexible, rapid specimen removal technique.
Future tests should be designed to allow corrosion specimen re-
moval without dumping the seglt inventory. This would prevent dilution
 

 

48

of the circulating salt inventory with the salt remaining in the dump
tank and simplify interpretation of the corrosion processes.

The design of future salt corrosion test loops should provide an
emergency heating system which will allow the pump to be stopped with-
out subsequent freezing of the salt.

A suitable BF; "scrubber" must be developed for future sodium
fluoroborgte pump systems, so that BF; vent lines can be operated for
long periods without plugging, acid formation, or back diffusion of
water vapor into the salt system.

The effect of sodium fluoroborate purity on corrosion rate should

be determined in future pumped corrosion test facilities. Techniques

‘for controlled purification of the salt will be required.

MSR-FCL-1 CONTROL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION: AND OPERATING
PROCEDURES FOR UNATTENDED OPERATION

CONTROL SYSTEM DESCRIPTION
Introduction

The control system of MSR-FCL-1l was-revised during July and August
1970 to permit unattended operation of the loop during evening and night
‘shift periods. ‘This description is intended to assist in the operation
of the loop and to provide guidance in the event of any difficulties en-
countered during operation.

The automatic control system is designed to transfer the loop opera-

" or normal, conditions to "isothermal," or standby,

tion from "design,
conditions in the event design limits are exceeded or a malfunction of
equipment occurs.

‘The principal changes in the control system are (1) the circulating
pump is shut off in the event of an alarm condition, (2) loss of pump
lube and cooling oil flow is included as an alarm condition that will
transfer the loop to "isothermal," or standby, condition, and (3) a con-
trol was added to automatically provide the proper amount of heat to

‘maintain the salt inventory molten with the pump off.

-Normal Operation

In the normal (design) mode of operation, two sections of piping
between the pump discharge and cooler inlet are ‘heated by direct resis-
tance heat. This heat is ‘removed in the finned cooler to. provide a
temperature difference in the circuit. An LFB pump circulates: the molten
salt, and a constant speed ‘blower with a manually adjusted damper provides
air flow for heat removal from the finned cooler. During normal operation
the following conditions exist: Lo

1. salt is circulating in the loop and the pump is ong
2. the pump lubricating and cooling oil is flowing;
3. the two direct-resistance-heated sections are supplied with sufficient

power to provide the desired temperature rise in the salt;
 

52

4. the air blower is on and the cooler housing door (top of cooler
housing) is open to provide sufficient cooling to reduce salt tem-
peratures to desired level;

5. the cooler direct resistance heater is off.

Standb ration

The loop is preheated by direct resistance heating during standby
operation except in the pump bowl section and the dump tank region, which
are heated by Calrod electric heaters. Direct resistance heat for normal
and standby operation is applied through three separate control systems.
The two main heater sections (used for normal operation) are supplied
from one control system, and resistance heating of the entire loop (used
for standby operation) is controlled by a second control system. The
cooler is preheated by the third separate resistance heat control system.
During normal (design) operation this heat will not be applied. With a
loss of salt circulation, the cooler hegter circuit and loop resistance
heater circuit along with the pump bowl heat will maintain the salt in-
ventory above the freezing point. During standby operation the following
conditions exist: : -

1. salt is not circulating; the pump is off (Note: the pump may be op-

erated, if desired, if the alarm interlock relay is manually bypassed);

2. the pump lubricating and cooling oil is flowing;

3. the loop direct resistance heater is energized with the circuit ar-
ranged to heat the entire loop except the cooler;

4, the cooler direct resistance hester is on;

5. the air blower is off and the cooler housing door is closed.

Automatic Transfer from Normal to Standby Conditions

A 1600-A circuit bresker installed in the main resistance heat supply
transformer secondary provides a means of transferring from high power
(normal) operation to standby operation. The following alarms will trans-
fer the loop from normal to standby conditions:

1. high loop temperature,
 

 

4

53

2. low loop temperature, .
3. low pump speed,
4. low lube oil flow (10 sec delay before transfer).

Emergency Power System

An automatic transfer is made to the diesel-generator bus in the
event of a building power outege. The design includes a time delay, so
that for an outage of less than 2 sec, the loop will continue on AT op-
eration. For an outesge of over 2 sec, the diesel generator in the base-
ment (which will have started immediately upon a power failure) will be:
timed in to provide control power, resistance heat to the loop, resis-
tance heat to the cooler, pump power, lube oll motor power, pump bowl
heat, dump tank heat, and drain line heat.

OPERATING PROCEDURES

Tnitial Startup and Preheat

Refer to £lowsheet, Dwg. 10486-R-001, Rev. 3, for valve locations
and functions.

1. Caution: Start oil pumps before applying heat to the system to
prevent accidental overheating of the bearing and seals within the LFB
pump.

The two lubricating and cooling oil pumps are started by start
switches (labeled Nos. 1 and 2) in the magnetic amplifier cebinet. The
pumps are in parallel in the oil circuit, and either or both pumps can
be turned on. With the control switch in the "off" or "preheat" position,
the pumps can be started or stopped by the "start" switches. With the
control switch in the "on" or "automatic" position, operation of the lube

ofl pumps is. controlled by the lube oil flow switch. On loss of oil flow

the standby pump will: be eutomatically started.

2. Preheat the main loop by manually closing the 400-A fused safety
switch supplying the main resistance heater. The 1600-A circuit bresker
is open. Set bypass switches 13, 1h, 15, 16, 17, 18, and 22 in the
 

 

54

"preheat" position. The dc supply to the saturable reactor is "on"
through the magnetic amplifier. Set the potentiometer supplying power -
to the saturable reactor at ~10 on the potentiometer dial.

3. Preheat the cooler by closing the 30-A fused safety switch
supplying the cooler resistance. heater circuit. Automatic closing of
the contactor "CR" in this circuit is permitted through NC contact R8-6.
Bypass switch 16 (cabinet 2) should be closed ("down" position) manually
to prevent shutdown of cooler heater when relay R8 is energized.

Lk. ‘Close the 60-A fused safety switch supplying variable trans-
formers through the 15-kVA transformer. This energizes all auxiliary .
heating circuits. :

a. Close the fused safety switch labeled "Emergency Power Supply"
to complete the circuit for diesel power if gs building power failure
occurs.

b. Heat dump tank to ~900°F. (The dump tank heat should be turned
on ~12 hr before startup, as the tank heats very slowly.)

c. Heat the drain line (except the freeze valve) to ~800°F.

5. Pressurize the loop with helium to ~3 psig.

a. Close the 30-A fused safety switch to the normal clutch supply
excitation. ) |

b. Close contact push-button, closing the pump starter and also
feeding the clutch. Selector switch "SS" is set at "org." ‘Relay R5 is
closed. )

c. Adjust the pump speed to ~500 rpm (cabinet 1).

d. Set the low pump speed alarm at 400 rpm.

6. The pump seal purge ‘should be flowing through the thermal con~
ductivity cell at ~80 cc/min.

7. After all loop temperatures are at 850. to 1200°F, position
valves for the Loop filling operation as follows. Be sure all heater

lug temperatures are at least 900°F. The valve position shown will

allow pressurizing the dump tank from one of the helium cylinders, while

the second cylinder is used to maintain loop purge gas flow and pressure.

8. Adjust the flow through FI 17 by opening HV 21 to ~0.2 £i2/hr.
9. Close HV 21.
10. Thaw the freeze plug-by closing HCV 110 and turning up the heat
on the fill line (Variac 8, panel 3). |
11. Open HV 22 and HV 81 to pressurize the dump tank slowly to push
salt into loop. Dump tank pressure of ~5 psi above loop is required for
loop fill. (PI 116 is located in pump enclosure.)
12. Slow the gas flow to sump by closing HCV 16 when the lower pump
probe light comes on.
13. Close HCV 16 when the top pump probe light comes on.
1k. Close HV 2L.
"15. Open HV 26 slightly to drop the salt level until the top probe
light goes off. |
16. Close HV 26.
17. Turn off Variesc 8 and start air flow through the freeze valve
by opening HCV 110. |
18. When the freeze valve is frozen, open HV 26 to vent the dump
tank to ~U psig.
19. Close HV 81, 26, and 8.
20. Check the pump seal purge and the thermal conductivity cell
recorder. So
21. Blover end damper control. permissive relay R8 is now energized
by manually closing switch 15 ("down position). When the relay is
closed, it seals itself in through contact R8-3, paralleling switch 15.
In order to permit shutdown of the blower and damper on long-time loss
of power, switch 15 is now opened manually. (" up" or normal operating
position). The cooler blover main control power (switch and bresker on

© the breaker rack) should be off to prevent blower startup until needed.
 

 

56

22. Increase the pump speed to the desired level. For U4 gpm (~10
fps) a speed of L800 to 5000 is adequate. Check pump for excessive op-
erational noise, vibration, or a possible oil lesk in the rotary union.

23. With the loop temperatures above 950°F, manually close the
1600-A breaker (located on the east side of the loop enclosure) and
slowly increase the main resistance heat potentiometer to ~80% and turn
off the cooler heater by placing switch 16 in the operate (up) position.

24k. When loop. temperatures start increasing, turn on the cooler
blower using the start switch and the breaker on the breaker rack. The
sliding damper on the blower intake should be closed. |

25. Open the door on the top of the cooler housing and engage the
. solenoid, which will ‘hold the door open.

26. Open the gliding damper a little at a time as required to adjust
the loop temperature to the desired level. Lock the damper in the final
position for long-term operation. ;

27. Flace all bypass switches (2 through 18, and 22) in the operate
or automatic position.

28. Place the building alarm switch (No. 23) in the "up" position
to activate the building alarm and signal to the plent shift supervisor
(pss). :
29. Make final adjustments on the temperature controller (TIC-1,
cabinet 2) and the blower damper, as required, to obtain the desired

temperatures on the metallurgical specimens.
Main Transformer — How to Control

The power to the main power supply is controlled by direct current
on a saturable reactor. With the potentiometer adjustment knob (Mag.
Amp. Cab. ) at zero, there is still some dc ‘current in the reactor which
gives what is called "dc leakage current” to the heater section. If the
Pyr-o-vane controller cuts off de completely, as evidenced by the main
power supply ‘alarm light coming on, there is still aveilsble vhat is |
termed "minimum leakage current" to the heater ‘section.

Should the temperature reach the set point of the Pyr-o-vane, the
dc will be cut off and the loop transferred to isothermal conditions.

ao
 

 

*"w

 

57

Resistance heat will be reapplied as soon as tempersture has dropped
below the set point. Therefore, the Pyr-o-vane gives "on-off" control
of temperature should a high-temperature alarm condition occur.

When an alarm condition has occurred and the loop has been trans-
ferred to the standby condition, power for resistance heating of the
entire loop is controlled through the second potentiometer (Mag. Amp.
Cab.), which must be preset to deliver the correct amount of power to
keep loop temperatures sbove the salt liquidus temperature (725°F) but
below ~1200°F. The correct setting for the isothermal heat is deter-
mined during startup and is indicated on the potentiometer scale,

Position of Control Switches During Normal Operation

The following list of switches snd controls includes a brief expla-
nation of each as to its function and position during normal operation.

Note: The "up" position is the proper position for all switches
during normal operation with a AT, except switch 22, which is down or
in the "automatic" position.

1. Control Csbinet No. 1

a. Switches 1 through 12 are alarm silence switches associated with
each of the 12 alarm lights. These switches are for acknowledging the
alarm condition and will silence the bell only. Whenever any of these
switches are in the "down" (acknowledge) position, the blinker light
will be on.

b. Clutch supply selector switch ("SB") will be in the "off" po-
sition to give normal power supply to the clutch. The auxiliary clutch
supply is disconnected. - B

c. Switch 20, the building and plant shift supervisor (PSS) alarm
bypass, should be in the "up" position to allow building and PSS signal.

d. Switch 21, the loop containment elr flow alarm, has been re-
moved. This alarm now is located on the "74 german" annunciator, and
this switch is no longer needed. }

e. Switch 22, during normal operation, should be in "automatic"
(down) position to allow pump shutoff for high and low temperature and
 

 

 

58

low pump speed. On "test" position the switch prevente stopping of ‘the
pump automatically except on loss of oil flow:

2. Control Cabinet No. 2

 

a." Switch 13, the low-temperature automatic-operation bypass, will
be left in open .or "operate" position. When closed, it prevents automatic
operations due to low temperature. tote This does not bypass the audi-
ble and visible alarms. . : :

Switch 1h, the automatic operation bypass switch, will be left
"operate" position. In "test" position it will prevent any of the
automatic actions from taking place and is to be placed in "test" position
only when testing the various alarm circuits and during actual "preheating"

or "thawing" of the loop.

“ec. Switch 15, the automatic operation relay reset, will be left in
the closed or "operate" position to allow automatic operation in the
event of an alarm condition. The switch is placed in "operate". position
soon after startup of g loop to allow seal-in of relsy 8, which directly
performs the automatic operation. Thereafter, it will be used only to
"reset" the automatic operation circuits (after the cause for same has
been cleared and the loop is ready to go back on AT), oT

d. Switch 16, the cooler heater control switch, will be left in
open or 'operate" position. ‘This allows relay action to supply resistance
heat to the cooler in the vent of an alarm condition requiring it. On
"preheat" position it will allow heat to be applied to the cooler without

. an alarm condition.

e. Switch 17, the main resistance heater switch, will be left in
the "operate" or closed position. This will allow the 1600-A breaker

to trip during an alarm condition. In "prehea " position : it will prevent

tripping of the breaker automatically. -

f. Switch 18, the low-speed and low-temperature reset, will be left
on closed or "operate" position. This serves as ‘a reset for either the
low-temperature or the low-clutch-speed alarm. When the switch is reset
after a low-clutch-speed alarm, it will automatically place the clutch
supply back on the normal supply, provided it is available. When reset
after low-temperature alarm, it will reset the alarm relay only.
 

 

29

g. Switch 19 is not in use.
h. A summary table of the switch positions is presented in Table
B.1l.

Heater and Gas Controls During Normal Operation

1. The cooler heat control variable transformer will be preset dur-
ing startup to provide sufficient heat to the cooler to prevent freezing.
This setting (indicated on front dial) should be changed only if the
cooler heater circuit is in use and an adjustment of cooler temperatures
is necessary.

2. The cooler preheat voltage meter gives an indication of the
voltage across the cooler lugs during application of power to the cooler
coll. It is the only positive indication of power being applied (other
then temperatures) to the coil.

3. The loop resistance heat control (the potentiometer in the Mag.
Amp. Cab.) will be preset during stertup to provide sufficient heat to
the loop piping (except cooler) to prevent freezing if the loop is auto-
matically transferred to isothermal or standby. The proper setting is
indicated on the potentiometer dial.

4. The catch basin flowmeter should have a slight bleed of helium
(~80 cc/min) as indicated by the flow indicator, FI 91, inthe BFj
cubicle.

5. The pump pressure should be between 6 and 8 psig (the pressure
recorder is in the pressure recorder cabinet).

6. The dump tank pressure should be between 3 and L psig.

T. The equalizer and vent valves should be closed (HV 84 and HV
83).

Abnormal Conditions

1. Switch Positions During Standby

During standby (preheat), switches 17, 18, and 19 are open ( "down"
position), as shown by the operation of alarm light L 11. During "operate,
all three switches are closed ( "up" position) and the light is off.

Switch 11 must be "off" during "preheat" to shut off bell and flasher.
When closed during "operate," switch 11 will permit the bell and flasher
to function should any of the three switches be opened manually (human
error).

During "preheat," switches 13, 14, 15, and 16 are closed ( "down"
position), as shown by the operation of alarm light L 12. During
"operate," all four switches are open ("up" position) and the light is
off. Switch 12 must be "off" during "preheat" to shut off the bell and
flasher. When closed during "operate," switch 12 will permit the bell .
and flasher to function in event any of the four switches should be

closed manually (human error).

2. Pump Speed Low

Low pump speed will cause the following actions automatically:

a. The pump ac motor, and thus the circulating pump, is stopped.

b. The blower is stopped.

c. The door on top of cooler housing is closed.

d. The 1600-A breaker is opened, and the loop is resistance heated
around entire circuit except for the cooler coil.

e. The power supply to the main loop resistance heater is switched
from the main loop heat control mode to the isothermal heat control mode,
which is preset to provide the reduced heat to the loop, as required, on
loss of salt circulation.

f. The resistance hegt to the cooler coil is turned on.

g. A signal 1s transmitted to the Plant Shift Superintendent's (PSS)
office.

. 3. Loop Temperature High

A high loop temperature will cause the seme actions as described

in 2, above.

4. Loop Temperature Low

A low-temperature alarm will cause the same actions as in 2, above.

5. High or Low Loop Heater Power

High or low loop heater power will give local, building, and PSS
elerms only. -
6. High or Low Loop Pressure

High or low loop pressure will give local, building, and PSS alarm
only.

T. Loss of Pump Lube Oil Flow

If the pump lube oil flow falls below a preset value, the second
oil pump will be started automatically. If flow is not returned within
10 sec, the ac pump drive motor (and thus the salt circulating pump) is
stopped.

MSR-FCL-1 SALT SAMPLING PROCEDURE

1. Install the sample bucket in the sample holder (Ref. Dwg.
10L86RO08E.

2. Fire sample bucket at lower end of sample tube in the Reactor
Chemistry furnace at 600°C for 30 min under hydrogen gas. Be sure to
light the hydrogen vent on the furnace during firing.

3. Lift the sample bucket out of the furnace to just below first
ball valve; let it cool under an argon gas purge for 30 min.

4, Lift the sample bucket above top ball valve (HV 114) and close
the valve to isolate the bucket with 10 psig of argon over pressure.
Close gas valve HV 137. Remove the sample holder assembly from the fur-
nace.

5. Install the sample holder assembly on the pump sample line.

6. Set the gas valves in the following order (Ref. Flowsheet Dwg.
10486RO01E): open HV 61 (for pump purge); open HV 13; open PV 1h fully;
open HCV 16, 19; close HV 20, 21, 22, 119.

the system down to HV 137 and ball valve 112.

8. Close HV 138 (vacuum valve).

9. Open HV 119. Pressurize the system with helium to HV 137 and
ball valve HV 112.

10. Open HV 11k and HV 137.

11. Close HV 119 (gas valve).

12. Open HV 138 (vacuum valve).

13. Alternately pressurize the system with helium and pump the sys-
tem down with a Welch mechanical vacuum pump at least four times.

14. Close HV 138 and open HV 119. -

15. Open HV 112 (lower ball valve) and push the sampler to the
bottom of the pump bowl; leave it in this position for 5 to 10 min.

16. Lift the sampler sbove HV 112 (lower ball valve) and close

valve HV 112.
