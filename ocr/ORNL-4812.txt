ABSTRACT

Molten-salt reactor technology, under development since 1947,
has led to a concept of a high-temperature, thermal-neutron breeder
reactor that operates on the thorium-2330 fuel cycle. A connected
processing plant that continuously removes protactinium and fission
products from the fuel salt is a basic feature of the system. The
success of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment that was operated be-
tween 1965 and 1969, the development of a new processing method that
allowed simplification of the breeder design, and the potential breed-
ing performance, economics, and safety of the concept, are cited in
this report as arguments for the continued development of MSBR's.

The report reviews the status of the technology, identifies further
development needs for an MSBR, and gives the program staff's assess-
ments of the uncertainties and the likelihood of success. Separate
chapters are devoted to reactor physics, chemistry, graphite, reactor
metals, reactor components and systems, cells and building, control
and instrumentation, fuel processing, maintenance, design studies,
and environmental effects and safety.

Keywords: review, molten salts, reactors, breeding, development,
design, maintenance, safety, chemistry, processing, alloys, graphite.

1. INTRODUCTION, SUMMARY, AND CONCLUSIONS

In the authorization report [1] on the Atomic Energy Commission's
programs for FY-1973, the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy expressed
"a word of caution" with regard to the Molten-Salt Reactor Program.

It said:

"For the fourth successive year, the Commission has
k= requested authorization of about $5 million for develop-
ment of the molten salt reactor. The committee recommends
authorization of the $5 million requested for fiscal year
i 1973, although in so doing it wishes to voice a word of
caution with respect to this program.

This concept, born under the Aircraft Nuclear Propul-
sion Program, has been under development for about twenty
years. Over $130 million has been expended on it to date.
In light of this long period of research and development
= and in recognition of progress realized on alternate con=-
cepts during this period, the committee recommends that
the AEC make a thorough reevaluation of the technical
characteristics and potential of the molten salt reactor
with a view to deciding whether this work should be con-
tinued and, if sc, the appropriate level of funding re-
quired to achieve a definite program objective. Sufficient
a information should now be available to make a consummate
judgment on whether additional effort is justified on this
program. The interest in and potential support for this
program by the utility-industrial group which has been
assessing this technology should be considered by the
Commission as a part of its evaluation.

It is clear that if the molten salt reactor is to
achieve fruition in a time frame during which it could
make a significant contribution to the civilian nuclear
power program, significantly more financial investment
will be required for detailed design and construction
of important component test facilities and an engineer=-

i ing prototype reactor to demonstrate commercial application.
In addition, the use of homogeneous molten salt fuel, with
the attendant requirement of on-line processing, requires
an entire technology unto itself in terms of materials,

we fuel cycle and equipment. Therefore, the committee views
a thorough appraisal at this time as imperative for the
Commission and the industry to determine appropriate

i priorities for optimum allocation of available financial

and technical resources."

 
Anticipating that the JCAE statement will lead to a thorough review
of the molten-salt reactor concept, we have put together this report to
provide up-to-date information for the review. The report briefly de-
scribes the features of the molten-salt breeder reactor as we visualize
it today, gives our estimate of its performance potential, and attempts
to state the present status of the technology that is required for the
concept and the likelihood that any developments needed can be accom- a
plished successfully.

Although in writing the report we have attempted to discuss all
matters that are of significance to the feasibility of the concept, we wi
have not by any means attempted to summarize all of the information that
exists on molten-salt reactors. However, the report does contain ref-
erences to a number of pertinent topical and progress reports, including
many of the 75 topical reports that have been written to record what was
learned from construction and operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor
Experiment. These and other reports and papers are also listed, along
with abstracts, in reference 2, and the reader is referred to it for a
additional information.

Background

As noted in the authorization report, the origin of melten-salt ws
reactors was in the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Program. In 1947, some
participants in that program concluded that molten-fluoride salts had
useful attributes for the fuel of an aircraft propulsion reactor — high wi
uranium solubility, excellent chemical stability, and geod physical
properties — and work was started on a molten-salt aircraft power plant.
Early in the aircraft development program came the recognition that the
molten-salt technology offered additional advantages for civilian power
use: avoidance of fuel element fabrication, rapid and inexpensive re-
processing, on-line refueling, good neutron economy, and high tempera-
ture operation at low pressure. Consequently, in 1956 a program was
begun at ORNL to investigate molten-salt reactors for central station
generation of electricity. Three years later, enough progress had been
made in defining the concept that an AEC task force on fluid-fuel reac- i
tors could say that, while limited in breeding ratio, the molten-salt
approach had the greatest chance of technical success of any fluid-fuel
system [3].

A result of this opinion was that in 1960 construction of the Molten-
Salt Reactor Experiment was authorized. The 7.4 MW(t) MSRE became critical
at Oak Ridge in 1965 and, after a very successful operating history, was
shut down in late 1969 so that its budget could be used for developments i
aimed at molten-salt breeder reactors.

The MSRE experience was of major importance to the molten-salt con-
cept. Up until the MSRE began tec operate well, in spite of the Task Force .
conclusion, few people besides those actively involved in the development
program considered molten-salt reactors to be really practical. The
major reason was that operation and maintenance of a system containing
a highly radioactive fluid fuel that melted at over 800°F seemed extremely a

 
Er

 

 

difficult. In 1966, however, the MSRE began to provide evidence to off-
set that view. When power operation began, the usual start-up problems
were encountered; but sustained power operation provided a remarkable
demonstration of operability. Starting in late 1966, an uninterrupted
one-month run was made, then a three-month run, and finally a six-month
run. Next, using a small fluoride volatility plant connected tc the
reactor, the original partially enriched 235y fuel was removed from the
salt and was replaced by 233y that had been made in a production reactor.
The MSRE then operated a final year on the 233y, which made it the only
reactor to ever have been operated on this fuel, and for a period plu-
tonium was used as the makeup fuel. When shut down, the MSRE had circu-
lated fuel salt at around 1200°F for a total of 2-1/2 years.

During the years in which the MSRE was being built and brought into
operation, most of the development work on molten-saglt reactors was in
support of it. As a result of the MSRE's success, however, the budget
was increased to permit work aimed at molten-salt breeder reactors, and
the shutdown of the MSRE freed additional funds for this purpose. The
most significant product of this effort has been a new chemical processing
method. Brought forth in 1968, this development permitted an important
change in our concept of an MSBR. (Like many features of molten-salt
reactors, this processing concept grew out of basic work on the chemistry
of fluoride salts that has been carried out for a number of years as part
of the AEC's Physical Research Program.)

When molten—-salt reactors were first considered for central-station
use, it was not clear whether they would serve best as converters or as
thermal breeders. A good converter could be obtained by putting uranium
and thorium in a single salt, but it appeared that they would have to be
in separate salts to obtain a good breeder. This was because the chemical
processing methods then available were only suitable for separate uranium
and thorium salts, a fertile thorium blanket was required, and most of the
fertile material would have to be kept out of the core to limit neutron
captures in protactinium. The conclusion at that time was that either
the converter or the breeder could lead to low-cost power, and the MSRE
ended up having a single salt so that its engineering features resembled
a converter, but the salt did not contain thorium, which made it similar
to the fuel salt of a two-fluid breeder.

As emphasis in the USAEC reactor development program shifted more
and more to breeders, the design and development effort at ORNL was con-
centrated increasingly on the two-fluid system in spite of the greater
technical difficulty of the reactor core. This difficulty arose chiefly
because graphite tubes were required to separate the two salts in the
core, and building a reliable graphite piping system that would withstand
the radiation damage of the high neutron flux appeared very difficult.

The processing advance of 1968 eliminated this problem. This advance
was the demonstration of the chemical feasibility of using liquid bismuth
to extract protactinium and rare earths from fuel salt that contains both
uranium and thorium. Protactinium, the intermediate in the breeding
chain between thorium and 233U, has a significant neutron capture cross
section and must be kept out of the core of a thermal breeder toc obtain
a good breeding ratio. The rare earths are important neutron poisons
and must also be removed rapidly for good breeding. The new process
made both of these possible; and when coupled with an advance in core
design that creates a fertile blanket out of a salt that contains uranium
and thorium, it made feasible a single-fluid breeder that obviated the
major problem of the two-fluid reactor. The single-fluid concept also
had another important advantage: the MSRE experience became more directly
applicable to the breeder.

Studies showed that the breeding ratic of a single-fluid breeder
can be nearly as good as that of the two-fluid reactor, and the power
generation cost might be even lower. Consequently, in 1968 the Molten-
Salt Reactor Program was directed to the development of the single-fluid
breeder reactor.

Features of the Single-Fluid Breeder Reactor

A conceptual design of a 1000 MW(e) MSBR was prepared at ORNL and
in 1971 a report [4] was issued describing the concept. Ebasco Services,
Inc., and a number of industrial firms and utilities associated with
them in the privately-funded Molten-Salt Group, have reviewed the molten-
salt technology [53] and the ORNL design [6], and Ebasco and its industrial
partners have also begun a separate conceptual design study of MSBR's
under an ORNL subcontract [7]. These efforts have produced useful sug-
gestions, and some have been incorporated into our concept of an MSBR.

We visualize the basic concept as shown in Fig. 1.1. The core is
formed from an array of bare graphite bars, so designed that they can
be replaced from above, and having open channels that provide for the
passage of salt. The volume fraction left for salt is different in
different regions of the core, and in an annular space it has been made
high enough that this volume is undermoderated and acts like a blanket
where most of the escaping neutrons are absorbed in the thorium.

The fuel salt is a mixture of lithium=-7, beryllium, thorium, and
uranium fluorides that melts at 930°F. At reactor operating temperature,
it has a viscosity about like that of kerosene and a remarkably low
vapor pressure. As shown in the figure, this salt flows upward through
the core where it is heated te 1300°F, and it then is pumped through a
heat exchanger where the heat is transferred to a sodium fluorcborate
intermediate coolant. The coolant transports the heat to a steam system
where supercritical steam at 1000°F is generated, leading to an overall
thermal efficiency of 44%. All of the salt-containing equipment is made
out of Hastelloy N, a nickel-base alloy developed especially for use with
molten fluoride salts in the aircraft propulsion program.

All of the salt-containing equipment is located in steel-lined con-
crete cells that can be heated to raise the equipment above the melting
point of the salt. A drain tank located below the reactor has a natural-
convection cooling system that is always in use and that serves as an
extremely reliable heat-rejection system for fission-product decay heat.
Fuel is drained into this tank during shutdowns, and the cells are de-
signed sc that in the event of a salt spill, it would also reach this
tank and be cooled.

1.1. Single-fluid, two-region molten salt breeder reactor.
Bubbles of helium are injected into a bypass stream of fuel salt
and swept back out in a cyclone separator to purge xenon-135, the major
neutron poison, and other noble gases out of the reacter. Another and
much smaller side stream of fuel salt is passed through the chemical pro-
cessing plant to remove the protactinium and the salt-soluble fission
products.

Enclosing the reactor and the chemical plant cells is a comventional
lined~concrete containment building, which backs up the cells themselves
to provide an additional barrier to the escape of radiocactivity. The
arrangement of the cells and the building layout provide access from
above through removable shielding to all the radicactive parts of the
plant that might require maintenance.

The Processing Plant for the Single-Fluid Breeder

The fuel salt enters the processing plant at G.9 gpm, a rate which
passes the entire contents of the reactor system through the plant every
ten days. It goes first to a fluorinatien column where the uranium is
removed as volatile UFg. Next it flows to an extractor where it is con-
tacted with liquid bismuth containing some dissolved lithium, and here
in a reductive-extraction process, the lithium enters the fuel salt in
exchange for protactinium which enters the bismuth. An additional step
transfers the protactinium into a separate salt where it is held until
it decays to uranium and is returned to the reactor.

The fuel salt, now free of uranium and protactinium, goes to the
“metal-transfer process’ where it is contacted with a captive volume
of bismuth into which the rare earths and some other fission products
pass. From this bismuth the fission products are in turn transferred
inte lithium chloride. In the metal-transfer process, the bismuth acts
somewhat as a selective membrane which permits the passage of the fission
products between the fuel salt and the lithium chloride without the pas-
sage of thorium.

Finally, the UFg removed in the initial step is contacted with the
purified fuel salt and reduced back to UFy for return to the reactor.
Waste products in the plant are accumulated, given a final fluorination
treatment to recover any uranium that might have passed that far, and
put in storage in the reactor building where they are held as long as
desired before transfer to a central waste-disposal facility.

Special materials will be required in the processing plant. The
wall of the fluorinator will be protected from corrosion by a frozen
layer of salt. The transfer lines will probably be made cut of molyb-
denum tubing, and some of the large vessels may be built out of graphite.

Nuclear and Fconomic Performance of the Breeder

We have performed physics analyses of the reactor described in the
ORNL conceptual design report [4] and have found its major characteristics
te be the following:

 

 

Pa

 
 

 

Average core power density 22 kw/l
Fissile uranium inventory of reactor

and processing plant 1500 kg
Breeding ratio 1.07
Fuel doubling time (exponential)

at 807% plant factor 19 years

Using these values, we have estimated that the fuel-cycle cost for
the 1000 MW(e) MSBR will be about 1.0 mill/kwh, as shown in the following
breakdown:

mills /kwh
Fixed charges on fissile inventory at 13.2%/yr 0.36
Fixed charges on thorium and carrier salt at 13.2%/yr 0.08
Thorium and carrier salt makeup 0.04
Fixed charges on processing plant at 13.7%Z/yr 0.49-0.69
Processing plant operating costs 0.05
Fuel production credit -0.09
Net fuel cycle cost 0.93-1.13

The cost of the processing plant has been treated as part of the fuel-
cycle cost to make it comparable with fuel-cycle costs of solid-fuel
reactors. As a result, the largest single item is the fixed charges
on the processing plant. (This cost would be lower if the processing
plant served more than 1000 MW(e) of reactor capacity.)

If graphite having no better irradiation resistance than that
available today is used in the core, some of it will have to be re-
placed every four years. The cost of replacement, including the cost
of special labor, appears to lie between 0.1 and 0.2 mill/kwh.

The capital cost of the reactor itself has been estimated using,
where appropriate, detailed cost information on a light-water reactor
of about the same size. A basic assumption is that the molten-salt
industry has advanced to the point where development costs have been
largely absorbed and the manufacture of components and the construction
and licensing of plants have become routine. Under these conditions,
we find that the capital costs of molten-salt and light-water reactors
should be about the same. While the molten-salt reactor has some fea-
tures which add costs, particularly the provisions for remote maintenance
of radioactive systems, it also has high thermal efficiency and a low-
pressure primary system that reduce costs.

In sum, the single-fluid MSBR will have a relatively low breeding
gain but a compensatingly small fissile inventory. The total of the
fuel-cycle cost and the cost of graphite replacement should be below
the fuel-cycle cost of light~water reactors, and the capital cost of
the reactor and power plant should be about the same as that of a
light-water reactor.
The Status of Development, the Major Uncertainties,
and the Alternatives

The major objectives cf this report are to assess the status of
MSBR technology, to identify any needed developments whose successful
accomplishment is uncertain, and in those cases, to see what alterna- ws
tives are available if the proposed approach does not succeed. Our
conclusions about these subjects, broken down in the same way they
are treated in the report, are as follows:

Reactor Physics and Fuel Cycles

 

In a fluid-fuel reactor many reactor physics problems, such as
power-density distribution, localized burnup, and reactivity lifetime,
are either not very demanding or are nonexistent. The most important _
matter in the MSBR is the accurate prediction of breeding ratio. Ade-
quate data and methods of calculation exist (similar to those for other
graphite-moderated reactors) and have been proved in the MSRE and in
experiments at temperatures up to 1000°C in the HTLTR. For the refer-
ence MSBR, with a calculated breeding ratic of 1.071, the total uncer-
tainty due to all sources of error in reactor physics is only 0.016.
(Uncertainties about the behavior of fission products add te this.)
Capabilities for calculation of critical concentration, rod worth, and
reactivity coefficients are alsc quite adequate.

The dynamics of MSBR's are influenced by the circulation of the
fuel, but these effects are well understood and predictable. As shown
by operation of the MSRE, the small delayed neutron fraction with cir-
culating 2337 fyel causes no problem. A prompt negative temperature
coefficient of reactivity and a long neutron lifetime contribute to the
stability enjoyed by molten-salt reactors.

The core design of the MSBR was cptimized on the basis of an index
of breeding performance consisting of the breeding gain divided by the a
square of the specific inventory of fissile material. Fuel cycle costs
at this optimum turn out to be low and not very sensitive to rather wide
variations in many of the design and operational parameters.

Thus it appears that an extensive reactor physics program te develop
data and methods for the MSBR is not needed.

 

 

Fuel and Coolant Chemistry

 

There is neo doubt about the choice of the fuel salt — the a
LiF-BeF,~ThF,~UF, system meets MSBR requirements far better than any
other mixture. Its most serious shortcoming is the low solubility of
oxide (30 ppm 02-), which will require that the ingress of air or mois-—
ture be carefully controlled. Here the MSRE experience provides confi-
dence, since its oxide content changed little during plant life.

Fission-product chemistry in fluoride salts is well understood,
with substantial input from the MSRE experience. The physical behavior wi
of the noble-metal fission products, which exist in elemental form,
3

cannot be predicted with as much confidence as we would like, however.
The reactor designer, therefore, must use conservative assumptions as

to their deposition on metal and graphite and transfer into the offgas
until data from operation of another reactor have reduced these uncer-
tainties.

A fluoroborate mixture (the 92-8 mole 7 NaBF,-NaF eutectic) appears
to be the best choice for the loop that is needed between the fuel and
steam systems. Effects of steam inleakage on corrosion and consequences
of mixing fluoroborate and fuel must be explored further. Perhaps the
most important need is a better understanding of the behavior of hydroxide
ion and of mechanisms by which tritium, diffusing from the fuel system,
can be trapped in the fluoroborate.

Fuel and coclant salts in the MSRE were analysed by removing samples
from the reactor and taking them to an analytical laboratory. However,
considerable progress has been made in the last few years towards develop-
ing on-line methods of analysis for salt. Most involve electroanalytical
techniques, but visible-light and infra-red spectroscopy alse offer
promise. One corrosion loop is now operating with a controlled voltam—
metry instrument that reports the gt jut ratic in the salt, which is
extremely important in reactor operation. Methods suitable for hydrogen,
chromium and other corrosion products, salt impurities, and certain fis-
sion products are beginning to emerge from the development effort and,
with continued progress, may become usable on a reactor.

Graphite

Graphite in molten-salt breeder reactors must meet three particular
requirements: it must stand up to neutron irradiation; it must have pores
small enough that capillary forces exclude fuel salt, which does not wet
graphite; and it must have a low enough permeability to gases to keep
down the absorption of xenon. The graphite manufactured for the MSRE had
to exclude salt, and a special small-pore material was developed by the
manufacturers, but the total radiation dose was too low to make radiation
damage a problem, and exclusion of xenon was not a specification. Thus,
although a graphite stringer removed from the MSRE showed no effect of
two and one-half years in contact with fuel salt, it would not have met
the radiation damage and gas permeability requirements of an MSBR.

Radiation damage in graphite is caused by high energy neutrons and
in most graphites results in shrinkage followed by expansion. These
changes in conventional graphites result in the volume starting to in-
crease rapidly at neutron fluences that are too low to be of interest
for MSBR's. However, in the last several years, special grades of
graphite that appear to be made by an uncalcined-coke process show
little contraction and a longer period before rapid expansion begins.

One that is said by the manufacturer to be commercially available has
been tested in the HFIR at MSBR temperatures and found to be able to
meet the 4-yr life assumption of the reference design. Consequently,

a material that has adequate radiation resistance seems to be available,
but longer graphite life is desirable, and there is hope that our grow-
ing understanding of radiation behavior will lead tc longer irradiation
life.
10

Progress with sealing graphite to exclude xenon has not gone as far.
Two techniques that involve use of pyrolytic carbon — one that deposits
it in the surface pores aad the other that puts on a thin coating — can a
seal the material adequately, but the permeability of mest of the small
samples tested has increased excessively under neutron irradiation.
Some understanding of why the permeability of the coated samples increases
has been gained recently from remarkably sharp photographs obtained using wa
a new technique with the scanning electron microscope. The failures are
now thought to result from defects seen in the unirradiated material, and
a new procedure for depositing the coating has produced flaw-free samples se
that are now being irradiated. However, the sealing method has not yet
been proven to work, and scale-up of the process to where it can be used
for large pieces is still in front of us even if the method turns out to
be a success.

Sealing graphite by impregnating the surface pores with fuel-free
salt is a possibility if pyrocarbons cannot be used, but if no method
will work, the breeding ratio of the MSBR will decrease somewhat because Ba
of increased neutron capture in 13%Xe. The additional loss in breeding
ratio will depend on the rate of stripping by the noble-gas sparging
system but will probably lie between 0.005 and 0.01. ws

Materials for Salt-Containing Vessels and Piping

 

Hastelloy N was developed for use with molten salts at the high
temperatures needed in alrcraft power plants, and since it has good
strength and good compatibility with fluoride salts, it was used for El
the construction of the MSRE. While the MSRE was being built, experi-
ments revealed that the creep ductility of Hastelloy N is reduced by
neutron irradiation. This embrittlement is caused by helium produced st
by thermal-neutron captures in the alloy, in contrast with the embrittle-~
ment due to void formation by fast neutrons that has been of concern
for fast reactors. Analyses showed that stresses in the MSRE would be
low enough for the reactor to be operated safely in spite of decreased
ductility, but this would not be true of future reactors, and a develop-
ment program was begun te find a cure for the problem.

The approach followed was that of adding carbide-forming elements, GE
which have been used to ameliorate the embrittlement of stainless steel
by fast neutrons, and 0.57 titanium was found to sustain the ductility
of Hastelloy N at the MSRE temperature of 1200°F. However, at 1300°F,
the outlet temperature in the CORNL-design MSBR, changes in the structure
of the carbides in the alloy caused the remedy to be lost, but this was
overcome by raising the titanium content to about 27. Some further gain
was made by adding niobium with titanium, and hafnium in conjunction ws
with niobium was found to be very effective, but problems with welda-
bility and cost have caused us to limit our effort on hafnium-containing
alloys. Transmission electron micrographs that disclose the carbide Gs
structure have been of great value in revealing the factors involved
and permit the properties of a sample to be judged rather reliably
before it is irradiated.

11

Small commercial heats of 100 1b each of Hastelloy N modified by
2% titanium addition have been obtained from three vendors and found
to have a minimum creep ductility of greater than 47 at 1400°F after
irradiation, which appears to be adequate. The material was fabricable
into small tubes and weldable under high restraint, so a sclution to
the embrittlement problem of Hastelloy N seems to have been found. The
remaining steps are to show that acceptable material can be obtained
in large commercial heats, determine the time-at-temperature limits at
higher temperatures, and collect mechanical properties data for code
approval.

Extensive natural-circulation and forced-circulation lcop tests
revealed that the corrosion rate of Hastelloy N by clean fuel salt is
low, and it was no surprise when salt analyses and surveillance speci-
mens from the MSRE showed that the generalized corrosion rates were
very low in the fuel salt and not detectable in the coolant salt. Near
the end of MSRE operation and during the post—operation examination,
however, there was a surprise when all Hastelloy N that had been in
contact with fuel salt was found to form shallow, intergranular surface
cracks when it was strained at room temperature.

The cracks were generally less than 0.01 in. deep, and the maximum
depth did not seem to have increased with exposure time. Since material
from the core and from the heat exchanger showed similar effects, irradia-
tion did not seem to be involved, but a striking contrast between the
fuel-salt and coolant-salt sides of the heat exchanger tubes indicated
it probably had to do with fission products in the fuel salt. Samples
were carefully leached and a variety of fission products were found in
the material to a depth of about 0.003 in. At the highest concentration
was tellurium, and tellurium and all other elements on which suspicion
might fall were deposited on Hastelloy N samples and held at MSRE tempera-
ture for 1000 hours. Tellurium caused cracks to form when the material
was strained, but no other fission product did.

As a consequence of these and many other tests of stressed and un-
stressed samples at various temperatures, times, and methods of fission-
product deposition, the evidence seems strong that tellurium is indeed
the culprit. There is reason to suspect tellurium (and also selenium,
although it has shown no evidence of misbehavior) because of its similar-
ity to sulfur, which can be troublesome with nickel-base materials.

In attempting to find a remedy for the problem, a variety of nickel-
base and iron-base alloys have been tested alongside of Hastelloy N.

Our exploratory experiments indicate that austenitic stainless steels
are not affected, nor are Monel and copper. Members of the Hastelloy
family containing about 20% chromium (versus 7% in Hastelloy N) have

not been affected, nor have samples of modified Hastellioy N containing
about 77% niobium. Inconel 600, of which the Aircraft Reactor Experiment
was built, was unaffected in two tests but showed shallow cracks in one.

An important result is that the materials that contain over 16%
chromium are unaffected. This behavior is consistent with that found
with sulfur in studies made for jet aircraft engine alloys, where chro-
mium concentrations of greater than 15 to 167% are needed to prevent
damage by sulfur.
12

Based on these observations, there appear to be alloys that are not
affected by tellurium, and among them are modifications of Hastelloy N.
If an increase in the chromium content of Hastelloy N is required, or an
Inconel or a stainless steel must be used, the corrosion rate will be
higher than that with standard Hastelloy N, but the increase will probably
be tolerable. Corrosion experiments will be needed to find out. Except
for the stainless steels, where the work has already been done, a change =
to one of these materials is likely to mean that modifications to confer
radiation resistance will have to be found. If through good fortune an
addition of niobium to Hastelloy N should suffice, acceptable corrosion
behavior is fairly well assured, and the effect of nicbium on irradiation
resistance has already been investigated to some extent. In any case,
in-pile capsule tests will be needed to show that the same effects are
seen in-pile as with tellurium additions out-of-pile, and preparations ww
for them are underway. A clear demonstration that a satisfactory material
has been found will be necessary before another molten-salt reactor can be
built. i

Reactor Components and Systems

 

Although many of the components and systems on an MSBR power plant
are similar to those needed for solid-fuel reactors, the design require-

ments on others are different, and z number are unique to the molten-salt ga
system. Many of the different or unique aspects were investigated in the
development programs for the aircraft reactor and the MSRE, but not all
have been used or tested, and increases in size or performance are re-
quired in most cases.

Starting first with pumps, vertical-shaft centrifugal pumps with
overhung impellers were developed for molten-salt service and used satis-
factorily on the Aircraft Reactor Experiment and the MSRE, as well as used
and tested in a number of salt loops. (A small oil-leak from the MSRE
primary pump caused problems with the cff-gas system, but the pump itself
was used without trouble for the reactor life, and the leak was easily a
corrected in a spare pump.) Although steps that add up te a 10- to 15-feld
increase in capacity will be needed in a progression from the MSRE to full-
size MSBR's, the same basic design as that used on the MSRE is specified Si
in the reference MSBR design, and the scale-up should be relatively straight-
forward. We believe, consequently, that although several years will be
required to develop and test larger pumps, the problems are well understood
and satisfactory pumps can be obtained. Byron-Jackson, an associate of wa
Ebasco in the Molten-Salt Group, has expressed similar confidence.

The MSRE intermediate heat exchanger and air-cooled radiator operated
without difficulty, and analyses showed no decrease in performance throughout wi
the plant life. Heat~-transfer experiments, as well as the operation of
the MSRE units, indicate that salts act as ordinary fluids and their heat-
transfer behavior can be predicted reliably as long as accurate physical
property data are available. The aspects of the MSBR that differ from
the MSRE, aside from size, have to do with the need for high performance
on the MSBR tc limit the fuel-salt inventory, and the requirement that
either failed tubes can be located and plugged in place; or that the tube a
 

 

 

13

bundle or entire unit can be replaced. Both of these create design prob-
lems. To obtain compactness, either smaller-than-usual tubes or tubes
deformed to enhance heat transfer have been shown in our heat-exchanger
concepts, and use of either will require a testing program. Some in-
crease in fuel-salt inventory will result if the compactness shown in

our concept is net achieved, but since only 17% of the fuel salt is in
the heat exchangers, a moderate increase in their volume will have a
limited overall effect. Providing for heat-exchanger repair is a part

of the overall MSR maintenance problem, but new techniques for plugging
tubes being developed for other uses should be helpful.

There were no steam generators on the ARE and MSRE, and as far as
we know, there has been no experience with generation of steam with high-
melting salts. The major problem is that in conventional steam cycles
the feed~water enters the steam generator at a temperature below the
melting point of the MSBR coolant salt. As a result, unless other
measures are taken, some salt would freeze on the tubes. Allowing a
layer of salt to form might be acceptable, but to get around the question
in our reference concept, we altered the steam cycle to increase the
temperature of the steam entering the steam generator. A supercritical
steam cycle was adopted but modified to mix some exit steam with feedwater
to raise its temperature to close to the salt melting temperature. The
penalty is some additional equipment and a small loss in efficiency, but
the net effect does not appear to be very great. Other ways of overcoming
the salt freezing problem also appear feasible, such as the reentrant tube
approach that appears in some sodium-heated steam-generator concepts.

The Foster Wheeler Company is now exploring meolten-salt steam generator
concepts under an ORNL contract, and they will consider our concept and
others before recommending a design. Whether Hastelloy N has adequate
corrosion resistance for use in a high-temperature steam system is being
investigated at present.

The sodium fluoride-sodium fluoroborate coolant proposed for the
MSBR melts at 725°F. This gives it a 125°F melting point advantage over
the LiF-BeF,; used in the MSRE and it is much cheaper, but until a few
years ago we had had no experience at all with fluorcborates. During
the past several years, however, an isothermal MSRE-scale loop has been
operated with fluoroborate, as well as two small forced-convection loops
with heaters and coolers, and a number of matural-circulation loops. A
fairly extensive chemistry and analytical chemistry program has also been
carried out. The major difficulty with fluoroborate is that it has a
greater tendency to pick up moisture than the other salts we have used,
which makes it more corrosive, but the corrosion rate with clean salt is
modest. The BF3 vapor pressure over the salt requires some special pro-
visions in the cover-gas system, but these have been worked out satisfac-
torily in the loops that have been operated.

The likelihood of steam generator leaks that introduce moisture into
the coolant will require that a cleanup system be provided. One of the
ways to prevent tritium getting into the steam may be to trap it in the
coolant and extract it from there, and the processing system to accomplish
this probably can serve both purposes.

The noble gases are insoluble in fuel salt, and, consequently, the
fission-product peisoning in an MSBR can be greatly reduced by sparging
the xenon from the salt. This was demonstrated to be very effective in
the MSRE, where over 80% of the 135% was removed. A more effective and
better controlled system is proposed for the MSBR, however, that involves
injecting helium into a bypass stream of salt and removing it and the
noble gases with a centrifugal separator. Experiments using water have
provided designs for the equipment and indications of the performance to
be expected, but testing with salt is needed and is planned for an MSRE-
scale loop now being built.

Cells, Buildings, and Containment

 

The containment philosophy and the containment building design for
the MSBR differ little from those for solid~fuel reactors, although the
probability of greater contamination by radiecactivity during maintenance
Will require more extensive filtration and cleanup provisions. The pro-~

iso

__ posal to use the reactor and coolant cells as ovens in which to heat the
salt systems, however, is not only unique to the MSBR but also is differ-

ent from the MSRE, where components and pipes were enclosed in insulation
and individually heated. The uncertainties that exist mainly have to do
with the best way of insulating the cell and how the equipment will be
supported and restrained to resist an earthquake. We foresee no limiting
problems here, but if some arose, an alternative would be to return to
the concept used successfully in the MSRE.

The method of providing access for maintenance by removing sections
of shielding from the top of the cell was used without difficulty on the
MSRE, and the major difference on the full-scale MSBR is the larger size
of components to which access will be required.

Instrumentation and Controls

 

MSBR's have some features that are favorable with regard to control
of the reactor and a few features that add difficulties. Chief among the
latter are the high freezing temperatures of the salts, which require that
special provisions be made in the control and protecticn systems to avoid
freezing during transient conditions and part-lcad operation. In addition,
rates of temperature change probably have to be controlled during load
changes to prevent excessive transient stresses in the system. While
control methods have not been worked out in detail, several alternative
schemes appear to be possible, and at least one should be satisfactory.

The small amount of excess reactivity required in an MSBR and the
dynamic characteristics of the reactor greatly simplify the reactivity
control requirements. Maintaining a long-term reactivity balance will
be difficult on an MSBR because of the continuous fuel processing, and
new techniques may have to be developed.

Significant experience with instrumentation systems has been obtained
with high temperature facilities of various kinds, and in particular with
the MSRE where the relisbility of the thermeocouples was particularly

 
 

 

15

satisfactory. The pressure and flow rate of the fuel salt were not
measured directly in the MSRE, however, and having the entire MSBR
reactor cell heated adds the complication that all of the instruments
in the cell must be able to operate at high temperature. Hence some
new instruments and measurement techniques will be needed for the MSBR.

Fuel Processing

Achievement of a significant breeding gain in a thermal spectrum
reactor is dependent on rapid removal of the fission products, and in
the case cof the single-fluid MSBR, is alsc dependent on separation of
the protactinium from the fuel salt. The chemical steps involved in
the processes presently proposed for accomplishing these separations
have been thoroughly investigated and appear to be well established.
However, engineering development and the demonstration of satisfactory
container materials have not progressed nearly so far.

Fluorination to recover uranium from radicactive fuel has been
used several times, most recently in the fuel reprocessing at the MSRE. cer
However, the scheme proposed for the MSBR involves continuous fluorina-
tion, which has only been demonstrated in small equipment and which re-
quires better corrosion protection for the fluorination vessel than has
been achieved before. Although many aspects of continuous fluorinators
have been investigated, including the formatiom of frozen salt layers
that are expected to protect the fluorination vessel, a significant
development effort on the fluorinator lies before us. Some of the
necessary experiments are underway and are progressing satisfactorily.

Direct reduction of UFg for return tc the reactor by its absorption
into fuel salt has been demonstrated in small laboratory experiments and
the behavior found to be satisfactory. However, no engineering experiments
have yet been operated, although they are planned for the near future.

One favorable result of the recombination experiments was the discovery
that gold is not attacked by the process fluids, and gold plating may
provide adequate corrosion protection for the recombiner.

Reductive extraction of realistic concentrations of uranium and zir-
conium, whose behavior is similar to that of protactinium, has been demon-
strated with fuel salt and molten bismuth in a packed-column contactor.
Flooding velocities and mass-transfer rates were measured and found to
be as predicted from data on mercury-water and aqueous-organic systems.

A demonstration of reductive extraction using representative concentra-
tions of protactinium is needed, and 30 to 50 grams of 23lpg is being
obtained to make that possible.

411 of the steps in the metal transfer process have been demon-
strated in a small single-stage integrated experiment, and preliminary
operation of a larger, but still single-stage, experiment has begun.

A three-stage experiment that will be 5 to 10% of MSBR scale is being
designed.

Losses of figsile material from the processing plant must be kept
low. Although the process fluids circulate repeatedly through the plant,
actual losses can occur only in the wastes. These are therefore collected
together, held to await protactinium decay, and then batch fluorinated to
16

recover any traces of uranium before discard. Experience with flucrina-
tion shows that the uranium content can be reduced to a very low level
by this technique. :

Fuel salt and lithium chloride are compatible with some common
construction materials, but nickel dissolves in bismuth, and the solu-
bility of irom is great enough for mass transfer to occur rapidly in
a system having significant temperature differences. Consequently,
materials such as molybdenum, graphite, and tantalum will be required
for the processing plant. Fabrication of molybdenum has always appeared
very difficult, but we have developed a variety of forming and joining
techniques during the past two years, and a fairly complicated process-
ing facility is presently being built completely from molybdenum.
Graphite should be less expensive to use than molybdenum, and the proc-
essing vessel for the three-stage metal transfer experiment will be
built out of graphite. However, we presently have insufficient data
on the compatibility of graphite with bismuth containing large concen-
trations of lithium or trace quantities of other materials. A small
natural-circulation loop has been built out of a tantalum alloy and
operated with bismuth; the corrosion rates of tantalum and of the alloy
seem acceptably small, but there is some inconsistent evidence of em—
brittlement of the alloy.

Carry-over of significant quantities of bismuth to the reactor
where it could attack Hastelloy N must be avoided. One Hastelloy N
natural-circulation loop containing fuel salt has been rum with an
open capsule of molten bismuth in contact with the salt. No effect
of the bismuth has been seen, but more needs to be learned about how
tolerant the reactor would be of small quantities of bismuth in the
salt. Little is vet known gbout the tendency of bismuth to be en-
trained in salt, and its solubility in salt has not been measured
accurately, although basic thermodynamic considerations indicate that
the solubility must be very low. Our approach to preventing bismuth
carry-over is to attempt to develop salt-bismuth contactors with stirred
interfaces in which the bismuth and salt are not dispersed, and a pre-
liminary demonstration of this technique has been made in a metal transfer
process experiment. Even if such techniques are used, however, careful
analysis for bismuth, plus a final cleanup step, such as passing the salt
through a bed cof nickel wool, will likely be used.

Failure to develop systems for rapidly removing protactinium and

the rare earths would prevent the attainment of a significant breeding

gain in a single-fluid MSBR. Fortunately, alternative approaches appear
to exist for most, but not all, parts of the process. Graphite may be
usable for the plant material if molvbdenum will not serve, and tantalum
and its alloys represent another possible alternative for parts of the
plant. If some parts of the presently proposed flucrination-reductive
extraction process cannot be made to work, an oxide precipitation process
that has been investigated in a limited way appears to offer an attractive
alternative; protactinium can be selectively precipitated as Pay0s by
treating fuel salt with a mixture of steam and hydrogen fluoride, and
uranium can subsequently be removed by a similar process. Indeed, fur-
ther work may show that the oxide process has advantages over the
fluorination-reductive extraction method.

We know of no attractive substitute for the metal-transfer process,
but because its development has progressed further than that of the re-
mainder of the processing systems, it seems most likely to be successful.
In addition, it is the step least coupled to the reactor, and reducing
the rare-earth removal efficiency several-fold would not have a prohibi-
tive effect on the breeding ratio. (A three-fold reduction would lower
the breeding ratio by about 0.01.)

One more observation should be made about the processing system.

No plant has ever processed material that is as short-cooled as that
which will enter the MSBR processing system. Although the salt and
process fluids are not damaged by radiation or increases in temperature,
demonstration that the accompanying heat release can be accommodated
will be possible only in a plant attached to an operating reactor.

Maintenance

Because fission products are circulated in the primary system of APTI
a molten~salt reactor and also transported to the drain tank, the off-
gas system, and the chemical processing system, special procedures and
equipment are needed for the repair or replacement cf equipment. Four
fluid-fuel reactors have been operated at ORNL, and the maintenance
philosophy developed for them will be useful in planning the maintenance
of MSER's. The MSRE experience was particularly encouraging in that the
radicactivity remaining in equipment from which fuel had been drained
was not readily dispersed during maintenance. Nevertheless, MSBR's will
involve larger components, higher radiation levels, and probably more
extensive contamination than we have dealt with before.

Much can be done in the design and layout to facilitate maintenance,
and the MSBR design must incorporate such measures to the fullest. Versa-
tile manipulators, automatic welding equipment, and remote inspection
techniques are being developed for other systems, and these will be use-
ful for MSBR's. However, most will need some tailoring for the particular
reactor. Consequently, although some general development of maintenance
tools and techniques can be done, most of the maintenance development
effort must be directed to perfecting the tools and procedures needed for
the particular application.

Design Studies and Capital Cost Estimates

 

ORNL completed a conceptual design study of a molten-salt breeder
reactor in 1970. A comparative cost estimate of that plant and a light-
water reactor was made afterwards by taking the basic cost data for a
recent PWR and using it to the extent possible to estimate the cost of
the MSBR.

The depth of the examination in the conceptual design study varied
widely throughout the plant, with particular emphasis being given to
those parts that are the most unconventional or are unique to molten-
salt reactors. FEbasco Services and its partners, as mentioned earlier,
have begun a conceptual design study of their own, and in it they are
18

locking at some features of the reactor in greater depth than has been

done by ORNL. The major aspects of the design that they have identified

as requiring further study have to do with the transient thermal stresses

in the primary system following rapid changes in reactor operating condi- wi
tions, and the methods of supporting the reactor components and providing

restraint to resist shaking by earthquakes. FEbasce favors replacing

graphite an element at a time rather than replacing the entire core as ww
a unit, as we had proposed.

In the studies we have made to size components and evaluate alterna-
tives, only simplified elastic-stress analyses have been made. Before
actual components can be built for reactor use, however, additional
mechanical properties measurements will have to be made (the extent de-
pending on what material is used), and extensive stress analyses will
have to be performed. Design rules, analysis methods, and stress limits =
that reflect the time-dependence of material properties and structural
behavior will have to be used because the strength of likely materials
at reactor temperatures will be limited by creep effects. Design methods I
to cover these requirements are currently being developed in the LMFBR
program and will be available for use in MSBR design.

Qur capital cost comparison between a fully developed MSBR and a
present-day PWR indicates that the costs are roughly the same. Although
the accuracy of an estimate such as this is not dependable, mainly be-
cause of the limited depth of the design, we believe that the technique
of using actual PWR cost breakdowns for the basic cost data helps to EE
limit the uncertainty. Wnen its design study is completed, Ebasco will
make a cost estimate for the MSBR that should provide additienal insight
because of their experience as architect-engineer on many light-water-—
reactor power plants.

Environmental Effects and Safety we

 

The major uncertainty with regard to environmental effects is how
to deal with tritium. Tritium is a special problem because of its high a
rate of production in the fuel salt and because it readily diffuses
through metals at MSBR temperatures. The distribution of tritium in
the MSRE was determined and found to agree reasonably well with an
analytical model developed for predicting its behavior. When this
model is used to estimate how tritium would behave in the MSBR with
no special measures taken to block its passage, an excessive amount
(790 Ci/day) is found to reach the steam system. Several modifications Ee
in design and operation offer ways for drastically reducing escape by
this route. The objective of limiting tritium release to within present
AEC guidelines for light-water-cooled reactors appears attainable, but
the best measures are yet to be chosen and demonstrated.

The situation with regard to kinetics and nuclear safety is unique
because of the circulating fuel. The kinetic behavior of molten-salt
reactors is well understood, however, and predictable by methods proved
in the MSRE. The small delayed neutron fraction causes no difficult
problem, as demonstrated by operation of the MSRE on 2337 fuel with an
effective delayed neutron fraction of only 0.0019. Thus there is ample Gr
a

 

=

 

 

 

19

basis for being confident that damaging nuclear excursions are highly
improbable. Of the potential sources of reactivity increases, the one
that will require the most study is the hideout of fissile material.
Conditions that could lead to such hideout are known (oxide precipita-
tion), but it appears that these conditions can be safely avoided.

The afterheat situation is also unique. The major source is much
less intense than in solid-fuel cores because in an MSBR the bulk of the
fission products are incorporated in a large mass of fuel salt. Further-
more, this heat source can be gotten into a reliably cooled situation
(the drain tank) under any accident condition. A somewhat separate prob-
lem is the smaller radionuclide heat sources in the processing plant, in
the reactor off-gas system, and deposited on surfaces in the fuel system,
which will also require cooling. The MSRE provided useful information on
fission product behavior, but uncertainties in noble~metal behavior dic-
tate conservatism in design for cooling the fuel loop and off-gas system.
On the whole, however, afterheat promises to be less of a problem in MSBR's
than in other reactors. In particular, the dilute heat source mskes the
"China syndrome’ less of a concern.

The design-basis accident in an MSBR is a rupture in the fuel system
that quickly spills the entire fuel inventory, and the containment of the
radicactivity in this event is the chief safety consideration for an MSBR.
The containment must be tight, but the behavior of the spilled salt and
its fission products is predictable and there appears to be no need for ’ ~
innovative development of containment technology to take care of this
event.

It appears from basic considerations that site requirements for an
MSBR plant should eventually be no different from those for other reac-
tors of like power and its safety provisions should be no more expensive.
Because of the unusual nature of an MSBR, however, it will be necessary
to begin with fundamental principles and develop criteria appropriate to
this kind of reactor, then to perform a safety analysis comparable in
depth to those for reactors now going into operation.

Future Development Program

As in any reactor development program, achievement of economic.
molten—~salt breeder reactors will require that the basic technology
be well established in research and development programs and be demon-
strated and expanded by the construction and operation of several in-
creasingly larger reactors and their integral processing plants. The
technology program is in progress now, and we favor the construction of
a 150- to 200-MW(t) Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment (MSBE) as the next
reactor in the sequence to an MSBR. The MSBE would have the power
density and all the features and systems of a full-scale breeder reactor.
Other steps are possible, and one favored by the Molten-Salt Breeder Reac-
tor Associates, an organization consisting of Black & Veatch Consulting
Engineers and a group of utilities [8], is the construction of a larger
but lower performance converter reactor that would evolve into a breeder.
We believe, however, that the more direct route of the breeder experiment
is preferable.
20

in the technology program several advances must be made before we
can be confident that the next reactor can be built and operated success-—
fully. The most important problem to which this applies is the surface
cracking of Hastelloy N. Some other developments, such as the testing
of some of the components or the latter stages of the processing plant
development, could actually be completed while a reactor is being de~
signed and built. The major developments that we believe should be
pursued during the next several years are the following:

1. A modified Hastelloy N, or an alternative material that is immune to
attack by tellurium, must be selected and its compatibility with fuel
salt demonstrated with out-of-pile forced convection loops and in-pile
capsule experiments; means for giving it adequate resistance to radia-
tion damage must be found, if needed, and commercial production cf the
alloy may have to be demonstrated; the mechanical properties data
needed for code qualification must be acquired if they do not already
exist.

2. A method of intercepting and isolating tritium to prevent its passage
into the steam system must be demonstrated at realistic conditions and
on a large enough scale to show that it is feasible for a reactor.

3. The various steps in the processing system must first be demonstrated
in separate experiments; these steps must then be combined in an inte-
grated demonstration of the complete process, including the materials
of construction; and finally, after the MSBE plant is conceptually
designed, a mock-up containing components that are as close as possible
in design to those which will be used in the actual process must he
built and its operation and maintenance procedures demonstrated.

4. The various components and systems to go on the reactor must be devel-
oped and demonstrated under conditions and at sizes that allow confi-
dent extrapolation to the MSBE itself. These include the xenon strip-
ping system for the fuel salt, off-gas and cleanup systems for the
coolant salt (facilities in which these could be done are already
under construction), tests of steam generator modules and startup
systems, and tests of prototypes of pumps that would actually go in
the reactor. The construction of an engineering mock-up of the major
components and systems of the reactor would be desirable, but whether
or not that 1s done would depend on how far the development program
had proceeded in testing various components and systems individually.

5. Graphite elements that are suitable for the MSBE should be purchased
in sizes and quantities that assure that a commercial production capa~-
bility does exist, and the radiation behavior of samples of the
commerciglly-produced material should be confirmed. Methods for
sealing graphite to exclude xenon should continue to be explored.

6. On-line chemical analysis devices and the various instruments. that
will be needed for the reactor and processing plant should be pur-
chased or developed and should be demonstrated on loops, processing
experiments, and mock-ups.

 

 
 

 

21

Other research and development will be required in a number of areas,
but those listed are the major and most costly undertakings. They repre-
sent a desirable program for advancing and testing melten-salt breeder
technology in the absence of a commitment to build a reactor, and most
become necessary if a reactor is to be built.

The Incentives for MSBR Development

The foregoing discussion indicates that considerable progress has
been made towards the development of molten-salt breeder reactors but
also reveals that a substantial development program will be required
before commercial MSBRs become an actuality. We turn now to the ques-
tion of whether there are incentives for pursuing such a program.

A full statement of the rationale for the development of molten-
salt breeder reactors could logically make three points. First, breeders
are needed. Second, in addition to the LMFBR, which has already been
established as a national geal, one or more different concepts that are
also capable of meeting breeding needs should be pursued at appropriate
levels of effort. Finally, the MSBR has a unique and significant role
as an alternate breeder.

The argument for the first point has been adequately made in a
number of places — most notably in the 1962 report to the President [11] —
and does not need to be repeated. The second point involves considerations
that go beyond the scope of this report and thus the arguments to support
it will also be omitted, although we are convinced of its validity. We
are thus brought directly to the third point and must consider how well
the MSBR meets the requirements for an alternate breeder.

For the development of any breeder to be worth pursuing, the system,
including the reactors and the associated fuel industry, must potentially
be able to meet three basic requirements.

1. Its fuel utilization characteristics, by which we mean some combina-
tion of breeding ratio and fissile-fuel inventory, must be good enough
that if it were built in quantity, the cumulative amount of uranium
that must be mined to satisfy the growing U.S. nuclear power economy
would stay within acceptable bounds. (Defining the latter is, of
course, the difficulty. References 9 and 10 include analyses perti-
nent to this.)

2. Its power cost at the time that it is introduced as a commercial
product must be low enough that in a free economy it would be chosen
by utilities on economic grounds in preference to the converter reac-
tors then available. Inherent in this is the requirement that the
reactor's reliability and maintainability be good encugh to yield
high plant availability.

3. It must be safe enough that the risk of injury to the public in an
accident and the amounts of radioactivity released during normal
operation are both acceptable.
22

As discussed in the following paragraphs, MSBR's appear potentially
capable of satisfying all three criteria.

Fuel Utilization. — The rapid removal of fission products and prot-
actinium from a molten-salt breeder reactor, coupled with the absence of
strongly neutron absorbing materials in the core structure, makes it feas-
ible to achieve a significant breeding gain in a thermal reactor. When
combined with its low specific inventory, this results in good utiliza-
tion of uranium ore resources. This point is illustrated by Fig. 1.2,
which shows that neither the breeding gain nor the doubling time in them-
selves are adequate measures of the ability of a breeder reactor to limit
the amount of uranium ore that must be mined to fuel a growing nuclear
power economy. The fissile inventory is also important, and it is their
low specific inventory that makes it possible for molten-salt breeder
reactors to serve as well as fast breeders in limiting the resource re-
quirements. To demonstrate further the importance of this point, the
peak uranium ore requirements obtained from curves like those shown in
Fig. 1.2 have been cross-pictted as a function of the specific inventory
and doubling time in Fig. 1.3.

Consequently, our conclusion is that molten-salt breeder reactors,
in spite of their small breeding gain, can serve as well as fast reactors
in conserving uranium. In addition, molten-salt converter reactors fed
with plutonium can have high conversion ratios and very favorable fuel-
cycle costs. Thus, even if molten-salt breeders are not successful or
not needed, the molten-salt technology can be used in a converter that
serves as a companion to a fast breeder to provide low power cost and a
balanced fuel economy [9, p. 6-52].

Throughout this section we have discussed the conservation of uran-
ium ore but have not mentioned thorium, even though the MSBR is a thorium-
cycle reactor. The reason is that it is fissile fuel that is in short
supply and not fertile material. The U.S. reserves of both 238y and
tiiorium are adequate to supply the need for fertile materials for hun-
dreds of years, and the cost of power is relatively insensitive to their
cost. As already noted, doubling the cost of thorium from $5/1b to $10/1b
would add only 0.05 mill/kwh to the fuel-cycle cost if no changes were
made to economize on thorium use.

Power Cost. — Avoidance of fuel fabrication, rapid removal of fis-
sion product poisons and protactinium, and a low fissile inventory result
in low fuel-cycle costs for MSBR's in spite of inclusion of a substantial
capital cost for the on-site processing plant. Capital costs for the
reactor are less certain than fuel-cycle costs, but a detailed comparison
indicates that when fully developed, the construction costs of MSBR's
should be about the same as those of light-water reactors.’ The high
thermal efficiency of the MSBR, the low primary-system pressure, and
the large temperature differences available for heat transfer are the
key factors which hold MSBR capital costs down, whereas remote maintenance
requirements on parts of the plant entail added costs.

Some penalty must be paid for the cost of replacing graphite, but if
this must be done as frequently as every four years, our estimate is that
the cost will fall in the range of 0.1 to 0.2 mill/kwh. The need to per-
form remote maintenance on parts of the plant may add additional downtime
requirements, but this should be offset by the high availability resulting
from on-stream refueling, which obviates the need for annual refueling
shutdowns.

In sum, we believe that power costs of MSBR's should be competitive
with those of light-water reactors, and the attainment of low power cost
does not await development of a large fuel-cycle industry.

Safety. — Molten-salt reactors have certain inherent features that
assist the designer in providing a safe plant. The salt systems operate
at low pressure with little stored energy; the salts do not react rapidly
with air or water; some fission products are removed from the primary
system continuously; and iodine and strontium form stable compounds in
the salt. Continuous fuel processing eliminates the need for excess
reactivity, and a prompt negative temperature coefficient is associated
with the heating of the salt.

A safety disadvantage is the accumulation of fission products in the
primary system, the off-gas system, the fuel storage tanks, and the proc-
essing plant, which requires provisions to insure that the fission products
will be contained and their decay heat will be removed under all conceiv-
able circumstances. Partially offsetting this is the ability to drain the
fuel into a tank that has an always-ready, redundant ccoling system. In
the MSBR reference design, this tank is used also as a hold-up tank for
the strongly heat generating off-gas, which means that its cooling system
is always in use and need not come into operation just in an emergency.
An added advantage of the design is the use ¢f a natural circulation
cooling system that does not need power to operate and can pick up in-
creased load without action by the control system or the operator.

Two other factors may provide some safety margins over solid-fuel
reactors. One is the comparatively low power density of fission products
in the fuel salt, which should permit catch basins or crucibles at the
bottom of the containment building to be cooled well encugh that "China
syndrome’ penetration of the containment still would not occur if all
else failed. The other is the on-site processing, which eliminates the
need to transport fission products at a time when their heat generation
rate is still significant.

In addition to being able to satisfy these general criteria for a
breeder, the MSBR is particularly suitable for development as an alterna-
tive to the Liquid-Metal Fast Breeder Reactor. The reason is that it is
completely different from the LMFBR, and if the LMFBR were to encounter
difficult technical, safety, or economic problems, there is a geod chance
that those problems would not be shared by the MSBR. These differences
include: fluid fuel versus solid fuel, slow-neutron spectrum versus fast
26

spectrum, 233y~Th fuel cycle versus Pu-238y cycle, molten—-salt coolant

versus sodium coclant, processing fuel on-site versus shipping to a cen-

tral facility, graphite core structure versus stainless-steel cladding

and structure, and slow reactor kinetics versus fast kinetics. A further

advantage arises from the dissimilarity: if both reactors are developed

successfully, the differences will provide an opportunity for full economic

competition in the supply of breeders to utilities, extending back to the —

mining of thorium and uranium ore. ‘
Thus we conclude that the MSBR can satisfactorily meet the require-

ments for a breeder if its potential is realized, and the differences be- ww

tween it and an LMFBR provide advantages to it as an alternative to the

LMFBR. In the next section we examine the prospects for success in achiev-

ing the potential of the concept.

The Likelihood of Success

The development program for a power reactor might be considered a
success 1f it brings all of the technology needed for the reactor to the
point that manufacturers can use it to produce power plants that can be i
sold to utilities. After having completed this review, we conclude that
there is a reasonable expectation that an MSBR development program can
accomplish this objective. To do so, it must find solutions for the
technical problems we have identified and must develop all of the
materials, components, and systems that are needed. Our conclusions
about the major problems are as follows:

 

L. Recent experiments indicate that there probably are solutions te the
intergranular cracking problem that has hung menacingly over the
program during the past year. Ap important guestion at the moment
is whether the remedy can be a small change in the composition of
Hastelloy N, or instead we must substitute an alloy of significantly
different composition that will require an extensive program to
qualify it for reactor use. This matter is being intensively in- a
vestigated at present, and a preliminary answer should be available
within a few months.

 

2. Our research program gives hope that means will be forthcoming for
reducing the escape of tritium to the steam system without a signi-
ficant change in our concept of the reactor. We should be able to
select the most promising method and demonstrate it in a system of i
reasonable size within one or two years.

3. Much work remains tc be done in the development and demonstration
of the processing system for the single-fluid breeder reactor, but a
progress so far has been very satisfactory, and this remains one of
the bright spots in the MSBR development program. The prospects for
successfully developing the fluorination-reductive extraction-metal
transfer system are good, and there are some alternative approaches
in case parts of the presently preferred system encounter insurmount-
gble difficulties. We should note that a complete demonstration of
the processing plant can only be made on a reactor, where representa-
tive concentrations of protactinium and short-cocled fission products
are available.

4, After these major technical questions have been favorably resolved,
a host of tasks remain to be accomplished in taking the engineering
from MSRE scale to MSBR scale. Those that we recognize are described
in this report; some are difficult, but all seem achievable. There
may be others; if so, they can best be identified by doing the de-
tailed design of reactor plants and can be brought into the sharpest
focus by development of equipment and systems for those plants.

Solving the technical problems and developing an operable reactor,
however, are not alone a guarantee of success for a breeder. The breeder
must not only be operable, it must meet the performance criteria we listed
earlier. Therefore we turn to the question of how likely it is that the
characteristics claimed for the MSBR reference design will be achieved.

Fuel Utilization. - Our experience with the MSRE and with the High
Temperature Lattice Test Reactor at Hanford shows that there is little
uncertainty in our ability to calculate the breeding ratio and fuel con-
centration of a molten-salt reactor that has a specified core composition.
More uncertain is the behavior of fission products in the MSBR; here the
MSRE data do not provide a complete basis for prediction, but the uncer-
tainty does not appear to be great enough for there to be a major error
in the estimated breeding ratio. i

The fissile inventory depends on the volume of the reactor primary
system and the amount of uranium hold up in the processing plant, as well
as on the concentration in the fuel salt; and these could be somewhat
higher than estimated in the reference design. The uncertainties are
whether the heat exchanger can be as compact as postulated in the design,
whether the plena in the reactor vessel are large enough for adequate flow
distribution, and whether the hold-up time in the processing plant can be
as short as postulated. While we cculd have been overly optimistic about
some of these, none appears likely to change enough to have a major effect
on the fuel utilization.

Power Cost. = The probability of achieving our power cost criterion
is more difficult to evaluate because it not only involves uncertainties
in MSBR costs but also uncertainties about what the cost of the competing
systems will be. The major cost item in the fuel cycle is the capital
cost of the processing plant, and this is probably the most uncertain of
the estimates. We can only say that we think we have made a reasonably
conservative estimate, including, for example, an allowance of $200 a
pound for the cost of fabricating molybdenum; and there is additional
conservatism in the processing costs being based on using the processing
plant for only 1000 MW(e) of reactor capacity, whereas the unit costs of
processing plants come down very rapidly if the throughput is increased.

Because the fissile inventory is fairly low and the credit for sale
of bred fuel is modest, the fuel cycle economics of MSBR's are not very
sensitive to these factors nox to the cost of enriched uranium. Increasing
uranium ore cost from $8 to $16 a pound without reoptimization of the
reactor would only increase the fuel cycle costs by about 0.1 mill/kwh.
28

Other factors have a small effect on the fuel cycle cost; doubling
the cost of "ii, for example, would add 0.06 mills/kwh, and doubling the
cost of thorium would add 0.05 mill/kwh. A relatively high fixed-charge
rate on the fuel inventory has been used in the estimate.

The graphite replacement cost was estimated assuming that the graph-
ite lifetime will be only as great as that of graphite that has already
been tested, and expected improvements in lifetime will reduce the fre-
quency and thus the cost of replacement. The cost of the graphite has
been estimated to be about $10/1b, which is much higher than the cost
of most "specialty" graphites but could be low for a sealed graphite
meeting the unique requirements of the MSBR. However, allowing an addi-
tional $5/1b to cover a possible underestimate of the sealing cost would
add only about 0.1 mill/kwh to the power cost.

We must acknowledge that estimation of capital costs of plants to be
built far in the future with some yet undeveloped technology is full of
uncertainties. Because cof the way LWR cost data were used, these uncer-—
tainties, as we judge it, have more to do with the design of the plant
than with our szbility to make cost comparisons for a given design. Never-
theless, there is limited room for error in the comparison with an LWR
because the cost of "reactor equipment’ (which includes, among others,
the reactor itself, the salt pumps, the heat exchangers and steam gener-
ators, the salt storage tanks, and the off-gas system) is only one-third
of the total cost of the power plant.

One other factor that can affect the power cost is plant availability.
Since molten-salt reactors do not have to be shut down for refueling, and
the frequency of graphite replacement is low and can be scheduled to co-
incide with major turbine maintenance, MSBR's start off with an availa-
bility advantage over LWR's. The MSBR plant must, however, be made reli-
able and must be specially designed so that the initial advantage is not
offset by the increased difficulty of maintenance.

Our estimate has the cost of power from an MSBR being about 0.5 mill/
kwh less than that of a light-water reactor at present uranium ore prices.
If uranium ore costs increase by $8/1b by the time breeders are introduced,
the cost advantage of an MSBR would increase by 0.3 mill/kwh. Thus there
is a fair margin for error in our comparison with present day IWR's. How-
ever, LWR costs are certain to change some in two or so decades, and HTGR's
rather than LWR'’s could be the converter with which te compete at the time.
Thus strong conclusions about the MSBR meeting cur cost criterion are not
possible, but the chances seem reascnably good with low uranium prices,
and of course, increase as the cost of uranium ore goes up.

Safety. - We believe that MSBR's have a particularly small probability
of a major accident with a large release of radicactivity, but this convic-
tion is based more on the general features of the concept, such as those
discussed in the preceding section, than they are on a detailed analysis.

A fully satisfying development of this argument will only be made in re-
views equivalent to those associated with the licensing procedure for con-
struction of an actual reactor.

 

 
29

In contrast to the probability of a big accident, the wider dis-
tribution of radioactivity in a molten-salt reactor and its processing
plant increases the chances of small releases. The ability to restrict
the release of radicactivity during normal operation or maintenance
periods to a desired level appears to be a matter of cost, and the pro-
vision of adequate containment and clean-up systems should reduce the
release rate to as low as desired.

These considerations convince us that the likelihood of being able
to develop an MSBR that can meet the requirements for a successful breeder
is good. We must note, however, that skeptics will sometimes acknowledge
the arguments that we have cited but then raise questions about other
factors that they think might be important. One question has to do with
the practicality of operating and maintaining a reactor in which fission
products spread throughout several parts of the plant. We believe that
this is a serious matter to be treated thoroughly in the design, but we
are convinced that it can be handled economically. Our views are based
on experience with the operation and maintenance of four fluid-fuel reac-
tors, and most importantly, by our favorable experience with the MSRE.
Larger plants will have larger components to be handied and higher levels
of radioactivity, but we believe that the MSRE maintenance approach, used
with careful design of the plant so that maintenance requirements are
anticipated, will permit repair or replacement to be done in reascnable
times.

A second question is whether the chemical nature of a molten-salt
reactor and the requirements for operation of a processing plant in con-
junction with it will make utilities unwilling to purchase such systems.
Cur response is that utilities have been willing to take on other advanced
technologies, such as nuclear energy and the use of supercritical steam,
and they seem willing to undertake operation of systems containing molten
sodium. None of the utilities that have evinced an interest in molten-
salt reactors has indicated to us that the requirement for chemical re-
processing would cause them to be unwilling to operate an MSBR.

The final question is sometimes stated this way: "If molten-salt
reactors are as good as you in Oak Ridge say, why aren't industrial firms
presently working on them?" The answer to this has several facets. First
of all, the commitments of the present utility suppliers to other systems
were all made before the MSRE had operated and provided a demonstration
that the technology was more practical than some had expected. Second,
the manufacturer of an MSBR cannot expect the significant fuel supply and
reprocessing business — the "razor blade" business — that can accompany
the sale of a solid-fuel reactor, and thus the potential for future profits
seems less with molten-salt reactors. Finally, the budget of the Atomic
Energy Commission for molten-salt reactor development has been relatively
small, and the AEC has made no commitment that it will assist in the de-
velopment of meolten-salt breeder reactors. Hence a manufacturer who con-
sidered undertaking molten-salt reactor development could not be sure of
receiving the kind of development support that has been forthcoming for
other reactor concepts.
30

The foregoing examination of various aspects of molten-salt breeder
reactors leads us to the following general conclusions.

Overall Conclusions

The objective of developing breeder reactors is to obtain a source
of low-cost energy for ourselves and for future generations. Molten-salt
breeder reactors have attributes of fuel utilization, economics, and safety
that make them well suited to serve that purpose. The highly successful
operating experience of the Molten—-Salt Reactor Experiment and the develop-
ments in chemical processes that have allowed an important simplification
in the breeder concept provide support for the contention that reactors
having these characteristics can be successfully developed. Because they
differ in many respects from Liquid-Metal Fast Breeder Reactors, MSBRs
serve particularly well as insurance for the nation's energy supply in
case the LMFBR encounters insurmountable obstacles. Moreover, if both
systems are successfully developed, the ability of the molten-salt reactor
to be started up as a breeder or operated economically as a converter on
plutonium, 235y, or 233%Y makes it a suitable companion for an LMFBR to
provide a balanced fuel economy. In this case, the differences between
the two concepts, starting back at the mining of ore, also provide in-
creased opportunity for a competitive breeder industry.

Thus far the work on molten-salt reactor technology has established
what we believe to be a firm foundation for success. There are still
some basic problems, notably surface cracking of Hastelloy N and tritium
containment, whose solutions have not been fully demonstrated. We also
recognize some major engineering tasks, such as demonstration of the
complete fuel-processing system, development of the capability for
dependable, economical maintenance of an MSBR, and scale-up of reactor
equipment to MSBR size. Nevertheless, the potential of molten-salt
reactors is promising enough to justify a continued effort.

Favorable resolution of the basic problems must come first, then
more extensive development of components and systems. If these proceed
satisfactorily, the construction of a reactor should come next, but the
scale-up need not be large since a 150 - 200 MW(t) reactor could demon-
strate all of the technology that is essential for a molten-salt breeder.
This reactor should provide sufficient information for concluding whether
full-scale MSBR's will be technically and economically attractive enough
to justify completing their development. We believe that a strongly
motivated and adequately funded program that follows this route will
lead to molten-salt breeder reactors that can play a major rele in pro-
viding the nation's future energy supply.

2. EVOLUTION AND DEVELOPMENT OF MOLTEN-SALT REACTORS

P. N. Haubenreich
Origins

When the idea of the breeder was first suggested in 1943, the rapid
and efficient recycle of the partially spent core was regarded as the
main problem [1]. This problem, which is still crucial in breeder eco-
nomics, was attacked in two ways — by striving for very long burnup and
by seeking to simplify the entire recycle operation. The latter pursuit
inevitably led to consideration of fluid-fueled reactors as the ultimate
in fuel cycle simplification.

Neutron-multiplying systems consisting of aqueous solutions and slur-
ries were investigated soon after the discovery of nuclear fission, and
the first effort toward a fluid-fueled breeder was based on these systems,
in which the fluid is both the fuel and the moderator [2, pp. 1-9]. The
Homogeneous Reactor Program, organized at ORNL in 1949, had as its objec-
tive a reactor with a uranyl sulfate-D,0 solution core and a thorium
oxide~D»0 slurry blanket, separated by a Zircaloy core tank. This con-
cept, with its superior neutron economy, offered good 233y breeding per-
formance.

‘About 1950 the idea of a very different fluid-fuel reactor for power
generation emerged at Brookhaven National Laboratory from studies on low-
melting alloys and slurries of uranium and thorium in liquid metal. This
was the liquid-metal-fuel reactor concept [2, pp. 699-929]. A version of
the LMFR using graphite moderator, U-Bi solution core, and Th0,-Bi slurry
blanket appeared capable of breeding.

Meanwhile yet another fluid-fueled reactor had been conceived for an
altogether different purpose — aircraft propulsion. Several different
concepts of compact reactors were being considered for generating heat to
be used in a jet engine. The Oak Ridge idea was to use a high-temperature
liquid fuel that could be circulated to remove heat from the core and be
drained for refueling. Experiments to investigate molten-salt fuels were
begun in 1947, and 3 years later molten fluorides were chosen for the main
effort of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) program at ORNL [3]. The
fluorides were particularly well suited because they offer low vapor pres-
sure at jet-engine temperatures, reasonably good heat transfer properties,
and immunity to radiation damage, and they do not react violently with air
or water. (See Chapter 5.) A small reactor, the Aircraft Reactor Experi-
ment, was built that used a fuel mixture of NaF, ZrFy, and UF, circulating
in Inconel tubing through a moderator assembly of BeO blocks [2, pp. 673-80].
In 1954 the ARE was operated successfully for 9 days at outlet temperatures
ranging to above 1600°F and powers to 2.5 MW(t) in investigations of the
nuclear dynamics of the circulating fuel system.

It was recognized from the outset that molten-salt reactors might be
attractive for civilian power applications, and in 1956 a group was formed
at ORNL to study the characteristics, performance, and economics of molten-
salt reactors for central station power generation [4]. A wide variety of

33
34

configurations was considered, and some were found that promised low power
costs while breeding in the thorium-233Q cycle. Thus when the effort to
develop a molten-salt aircraft reactor was stopped in 1957, the molten-
salt reactor concept survived as a potential civilian power reactor.

Relation to Other Fluid-Fuel Programs

Early in 1959 a task force assembled by the AEC made a comparative
evaluation of the three fluid-fuel reactor concepts then being pursued.
The conclusion was that the mclten-salt reactor, altheough limited in
potential breeding gain, had "the highest probability of achieving tech-
nical feasibility" [5]. Soon thereafter work on the aguecus homogeneous
and liquid-metal-fuel reactors was discontinued, leaving the molten-salt
reactor as the lone fluid-fuel breeder concept still being supported by
the USAEC.* :

Although the Molten-Salt Reactor Program, as such, was relatively
young, there was an extensive technological base from the ANP program,
where $60 million had been invested in molten-salt reactor technology.
Some of this had gone for developments specific to the compact aircraft
configuration, but a large fraction of the technology was equally appli-
cable to the civilian power reactors that were being envisioned. The
physical chemistry of interesting fluoride salt mixtures had been ex-
plored, and a container alloy had been developed that was especially com-
patible with fluoride salt mixtures and which had significantly higher
strength than Inconel at the 1500-1600°F temperatures required in an
aircraft reactor. Originally called INOR-8, this alloy is now generally
known as Hastelloy N. Techniques for producing, purifying, and analyzing
fluoride mixtures had been worked out, and considerable experience was
gained in handling the ARE fuel. The fluoride volatility process was
developed and was successfully used to recover the uranium from the ARE
fuel in 1957-58.

In additien to the generally applicable ANP work, there was some
spinoff to the molten-salt technology from the agueous homogeneous re-
actor and liquid-metal-fuel reactor programs. The Homogeneous Reactor
Program had built and operated two reactors using circulating aqueous
fuel solutions at 250-300°C. Considerable maintenance was required on
radicactive parts of these reactors, and one significant contribution
te reactor technology was this experience with maintenance of highly
radioactive systems [7]. A chemical processing scheme explored for the
liquid metal fuel reactor involved molten salts and molten bismuth. The
experience of this effort, and the general background of experience with
molten bismuth, proved valuable when extraction systems involving molten
bismuth became the heart of the processing concept for MSBR's.

Work has continued at KEMA, Arnhem, Netherlands, on a reactor
concept using an aqueous suspension fuel [6].

Eariy MSBR Concepts

In the early days of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program, sericus con-
sideration was given to homogeneous reactors in which the core contained
nothing but salt. These ideas were abandoned after calculations showed
that the limited moderation by likely fluoride salt constituents alone
would result in a thermal reactor with inferior breeding performance.
Breeding appeared possible in intermediate-spectrum reactors, but their
gains were not high enough to compensate for their higher fissile inven-
tories. Studies of fast-spectrum molten-salt reactors (using chloride
salts) indicated good breeding ratios, but fissile inventories were ex-
cessive unless unconventional heat transfer systems were used to minimize
holdup outside of the core.

After experiments showed that bare graphite could probably be used in
the core of a molten-salt reactor, MSRP efforts concentrated on graphite-
moderated reactors having well-thermalized neutron spectra and low fissile
inventories. Two general types were considered — single-fluid reactors in
which thorium and uranium were combined in one salt, and two-fluid reactors
in which UFy-bearing fuel salt was separated from fertile salt containing
ThFy. In any case the diluent fluoride mixture would be 7LiF-BeF, instead
of the NaF-Zr¥F, mixture used in the aircraft reactors; the 7LiF-BeF, ab-
sorbed fewer neutrons and dissolved more ThF, without excessive liquidus
temperatures. The single-fluid reactor was relatively simple and promised
low power costs, but breeding appeared to be impractical because of neu-
tron leakage and losses to protactinium and fission products [8]. (At
that time it was not clear that Pa and fission products could be separated
economically on a very short cycle.) The two-fluid reactor could be de-
signed with a fertile blanket to reduce leakage, and Pa losses would be
reduced because the fertile salt would be at a lower average flux. The
only processing required for the fertile salt was fluorination to recover
the bred uranium. The fuel salt could be processed by a combination of
fluorination and an aqueous process. The two-fluid reactor was more com—
plex in that it used two salts that had to be kept separate, but it did
of fer attractive breeding performance.

The MSRE

Purpose

By 1960 a fairly clear picture of a family of molten-salt reactors
had emerged. The technical feasibility appeared to be on a sound
footing — a compatible combination of salt, graphite, and container
material — but a reactor was needed to really prove the technology.

That was the purpose of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment: to demon-
strate that some of the key features of the proposed molten-salt power
reactors could be embodied in a practical reactor that could be operated
safely and reliably and be maintained without excessive difficulty. For
simplicity it was to be a fairly small, one-fluid reactor operating at
10 MW(t) or less, with heat rejection to the air via a secondary salt.
36

Description

The MSRE flowsheet is shown as Fig. 2.1. Figure 2.2 shows some de-
tail of the 5-~ft-diameter reactor vessel. The fuel was LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-UF,
(64-30-5-1 mole %), the secondary salt was LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %), the
moderator was grade CGB graphite, and all other parts contacting salt
were of Hastelloy N. The bowl of the fuel pump was the surge space for
the circulating loop, and here about 50 gpm of fuel was sprayed into the
gas space to allow xenon and krypton to escape from the salt. Also in
the pump bowl was a port through which salt samples could be taken or
capsules of concentrated fuel enriching salt (UF,-LiF or PuF3) could be
introduced. The fuel system was located in sealed cells, laid out for
maintenance with long-handled tools through openings in the top shielding.
A tank of LiF-BeF; salt was used to flush the fuel circulating system
before and after maintenance. In a cell adjacent to the reactor was a
simple facility for bubbling gas through the fuel or flush salt: Hp-HF
to remove oxide, F, to remove uranium as UFg. References 9, 10, and 11
provide more detailed descriptions of the reactor and processing plant.

Development and Construction

 

Most of the MSRP effort from 1960 through 1964 was devoted to design,
development, and construction of the MSRE. Production and further test-

ing of graphite and Hastelloy N, both in-pile and cut, were major develop-

ment activities. Others included work on reactor chemistry, develcpment
of fabrication techniques for Hastelloy N, develcpment of reactor compon-
ents, and remote-maintenance planning and preparations. (A convenient
summary of developments through the end of major construction is given
in reference 12.)

Before the MSRE development began, tests had shown that salt would
not permeate graphite in which the pores were very small. Graphite with
the desired pore structure was available only in small, experimentally
prepared pieces, however, and when a manufacturer set cut to produce a
new grade (CGB) to meet the MSRE requirements, difficulties were en-
countered [12, pp. 373-389]. A series of pitch impregnations and heat
treatments produced the desired high density and small pore structure,
but in the final steps cccasional cracks appeared in many of the 2-1/4-in.
square bars. Apparently the cracks resulted because the structure was so
tight that gases from the pyrolysis of the impregrant could not escape
rapidly enough. Tests showed, however, that the cracks did not propagate,
even when filled with salt and subjected to repeated freeze-thaw cycles.
After analysis showed that heating in salt-filled cracks would not be ex-
cessive, the graphite was accepted and used in the MSRE.

The choice of Hastelloy N for the MSRE was on the bases of the prom-
ising results of tests at ANP conditions and the availability of much of
the required metallurgical data.® Development for the MSRE generated the

Any attempt to develop a less—expensive alloy, possibly even better
suited to MSRE conditions, was precluded by time and cost considerations

further data required for ASME code approval. It also included prepara-
tion of standards for Hastelloy N procurement and for component fabrica-
tion. Material for the MSRE, amounting to almost 200,000 1b in a variety
of shapes, was produced commercially. After weld-cracking in experimental
heats was overcome by minor composition changes, there was no difficulty
in obtaining acceptable material. Requests for bids on component fabri-
cation went to several companies in the nuclear fabrication industry, but
all declined to submit lump-sum bids because of lack of experience with
the new alloy. Consequently all major components were fabricated in AEC-
owned shops at Oak Ridge and Paducah [12, pp. 63-82]. After appropriate
procedures were worked out, Hastelloy N fabrication presented no unusual
problems.

At the time that design stresses were set for .the MSRE, the few
data that were available indicated that the strength and creep rate of
Hastelloy N were hardly affected by irradiation. An arbitrary allow-
ance was made for possible effects, however, by extablishing design stresses
20% below Code values for unirradiated Hastelloy N. After the construc-
tion was well along, the stress-rupture life and fracture strain were
found to be drastically reduced by thermal-neutron irradiation. The MSRE
stresses were reanalyzed, and it was concluded that the reactor would
have adequate life to reach its goals. At the same time a program was
launched to improve the resistance of Hastelloy N to the embrittlement.
(See Chapter 7 and reference 13.)

An extensive out-of-pile corrosion test program was carried out for
Hastelloy N [12, pp. 334-343] which indicated extremely low corrosion
rates at MSRE conditions. Capsules exposed in the Materials Testing
Reactor showed that salt fission power densities of more than 200 W/cm3
had no adverse effects on compatibility of fuel salt, Hastelloy N, and
graphite. Fluorine gas was found to be produced by radiolysis of frozen
salts, but only at temperatures below about 100°C [12, pp. 252-287].

The results of this program are described in some detail in Chapter 5.

Components that were developed especially for the MSRE included
flanges for 5-inch lines carrying molten salt, freeze valves (an air-
cooled section where salt could be frozen and thawed), flexible control
rods to operate in thimbles at 1200°F, and the fuel sampler-enricher
[12, pp. 167-190]. Centrifugal pumps were developed similar to those used
successfully in the aircraft reactor program, but with provisions for re-
mote maintenance, and including a spray system for xenon removal. Remote
maintenance considerations pervaded the MSRE design, and developments
included devices for remotely cutting and brazing together 1-1/2-inch
pipe, removable heater-insulation units, and equipment for removing speci-
mens of metal and graphite from the core.

The MSRE development program did not include reactor physics experi-
ments or heat transfer measurements. There was enough latitude in the MSRE
that deviations from predictions would not compromise safety or accomplish-
ment of the objectives of the MSRE.

Construction of the primary system components and alterations of the
0ld ARE building (which had been partly remodeled for a proposed 60-MW(t)
aircraft reactor) were started in 1962. Installation of the salt systems
was completed in mid-1964. ORNL was responsible for quality assurance,
40

planning, and management of construction [14]. The primary systems were
installed by ORNL forces; subcontractors modified the building and in-
stalled ancillary systems.

Operation

Operation of the MSRE spanned 5 years, from the loading of salt in
1964 through the end of nuclear operation in December, 1969. As described
in references 9 and 15, all of the cbjectives of the experiment were
achieved during this period.

Checkout and prenuclear tests included 1000 hr of circulation of
flush salt and fuel carrier salt. Nuclear testing of the MSRE began in
June 1865, with the addition of enriched 23°U as UF,-LiF eutectic to the
carrier salt to make the reactor critical. After zero-power experiments
to measure rod worth and reactivity coefficients [16], the reactor was
shut down and final preparations made for power operation. Power ascen-
sion was delayed when vapors from oil that had leaked into the fuel pump
were polymerized by the radicactive offgas and plugged gas filters and
valves. Maximum power, which was limited to 7.4 MW(t) by the capability
of the heat-rejection system, was reached in May 1966.

After two months of high-power operation, the reactor was down for
3 months because of the failure of one of the main ccoling blowers. Some
further delays were encountered because of offgas line plugging, but by
the end of 1966 most of the startup problems were behind. During the
next 15 months, the reactor was critical 80% of the time, with runs of
1, 3, and 6 months that were uninterrupted by a fuel drain. By March,
1968, the original objectives of the MSRE had been accomplished, and
nuclear cperation with 235y was concluded.

By this time, ample 2323 had become available, so the MSRE program
was extended to include substitution of 433U for the uranium in the fuel
salt and operaticn to observe the new nuclear characteristics. Using
the on-site processing equipment, the flush salt and fuel salt were
fluorinated to reccver the uranium in them as UF [11]. 233yF,~LiF
eutectic was then added to the carrier salt, and in October 1968, the
MSRE became the world's first reactor to operate on 233g.

The 233¢ zero~power experiments and dynamics tests confirmed the
predicted neutronic characteristics.® An unexpected consequence of proc-—
essing the salt was that its physical properties were altered slightly
so that more than the usual amount of gas was entrained from the fuel
pump into the circulating loop. The circulating gas and the power fluc-
tuations that accompanied it were eliminated by operating the fuel pump
at slightly lower speed. Operation at high power for several menths
permitted very accurate measurement of the capture-to-fission ratio,
for 2230 in this reactor, completing the objectives of the 233y operation.

*
The 2330 critical concentration was lower, reactivity coefficients
larger, and delayed neutron fraction much lower than with the 235y fuel.
41

In the concluding months of operation, xenon stripping, deposition of
fission products, and tritium behavior were investigated. The feasibility
Ep of using plutonium in molten-salt reactors was emphasized by adding PuFj
as makeup fuel during this period.

After the final shutdown in December 1969, the reactor was left in
standby for almost a year. Then a limited examination program was carried
out, including a moderatcr bar from the core, a control rod thimble, heat

exchanger tubes, parts from the fuel pump bowl, and a freeze valve that
had developed a leak during the final shutdown. The radioactive systems
fe were then clesed to await ultimate disposal.

GE Results

The broadest and perhaps most important conclusion from the MSRE
experience is that this was a quite practical reactor. It ran for long
periods of time, yielding valuable information, and when maintenance was
required it was accomplished safely and without excessive delay.* The
remarkable performance of the MSRE clearly shows that with proper design
and careful construction and operation, the unusual features of an MSR
in no way compromise its safety and dependability.

In many regards, the MSRE served to confirm expectations and predic-
Gi tions [15]. For example, we had confidently expected the observed immu-
nity of the fuel salt to radiation damage, the complete absence of attack
on the graphite, and the very minor general corrosion of the Hastelloy N.
Noble gases were stripped from the fuel salt by the simple spray system
even better than anticipated, reducing the 135%e poisoning by a factor
of about 6. The bulk of the fission product elements remained stable in
the salt. Additions of uranium and plutonium to the salt during operation
si were quick and uneventful, and the recovery of uranium by flucrination was

quite efficient. The meutronics, including critical loading, reactivity
coefficients, dynamics, and long-term reactivity changes, agreed very

 

a closely with prior calculations.

In other areas, the operation resulted in improved data or helped to
reduce uncertainties. The 233U capture-to~fission ratio in a typical MSR
neutron spectrum is an example of basic data that were improved. The
effect of fissioning on the redox potential of the fuel salt was resolved.
The deposition of some elements ("noble metals") was expected, but the
MSRE provided quantitative data on relative deposition on graphite, metal,
Ei and liquid-gas interfaces. Heat transfer coefficients measured in the

MSRE agreed very closely with conventional design calculations (using
correct values for salt properties) and did not change over the life of

 

*By the final shutdown salt had circulated in the fuel system at
temperatures around 1200°F for 21, 788 hours. The reacter had been
critical for 17,655 hours, producing 13,172 equivalent full-power hours
of nuclear heat. During the 15-month phase of the test program devoted
to the demonstration of sustained operation, the reactor was critical
80% of the time and available 86% of the time (including time spent in
scheduled replacement of core specimens).

 
42

the reactor. Limitation of oxygen access to the salt proved quite effec-
tive, and the tendency of fission products to be dispersed from contami-
nated equipment during maintenance was less than we had anticipated.

Operation of the MSRE provided some insights into the unusual problem
of tritium in a molten-salt reactor. It was observed that about 6-10%
of the calculated 54 Ci/day production diffused out of the fuel system
into the containment cell atmosphere and another 6-10% reached the air
through the heat removal system [17]. The fact that these fractions
were not higher indicated that something {probably oxide coatings) par-
tially negated the easy transfer of tritium through hot metals.

The one quite unexpected finding of great importance was the shallow
intergranular cracking observed in all metal surfaces exposed to the fuel
salt. This was first noted in the specimens that were removed from the
core at intervals during the reactor operation. Pest-operation examina-
tion of pieces of a control-rod thimble, heat-exchanger tubes, and pump
bowl parts revealed the ubiquity of the cracking and emphasized its impor-
tance to the MSR concept. Further investigations and possible consequences
are discussed in Chapters 7 and 14 of this report.

Recent Meclten-Salt Reactor Concepts

Since the MSRE, the Molten-Salt Reactor Program has been a technology
program, not focused on building a particular reactor, but seeking to
identify and accomplish the developments that are needed before molten-
salt breeder reactors can become a reality [18]. In the furtherance of this
program, efforts on conceptual design have been essential in defining the
needs for development, while experimental findings, in turn; shape the
concept. This section describes the reactor concepts that have been
considered in the course of this intertwined process.

As described previously, at the time that the MSRE was conceived,
the two-fluid reactor, despite its relative complexity, seemed tc hold
the most promise as a breeder. During the early years of the MSRE,
relatively little effort was devoted tec refinement of conceptual designs.
Basic chemistry studies continued, however, and led in 1964 to an impor-
tant development that simplified the processing in the two-fluid breeder
plant [12, p. 309]. This was the separation of rare-earth fluorides from
LiF and BeF, by distillation at 1000°C. (The practicality was later
demonstrated with a portion of the MSRE fuel [19].) Thus it was, when
the MSRE settled into operation, that design efforts focused on the two-
fluid concept.

Studies at first indicated outstanding resource utilization, mainly
because of an extremely low specific inventory of about 0.8 kg fissile/MW(e)
[20]. Then in 1967, when irradiation of graphite to very high neutron
fluences revealed more rapid dimensional changes than had been projected,
the two-fluid concept was dealt a severe blow. Accommodation of the dif-
ferential growth of the graphite made the core design and assembly so
complex that it seemed necessary tc replace the entire reactor vessel
and its contents whenever the graphite core tubing became unserviceable.
The reference design for a 1000-MW(e) plant included four 356-MW{t)

 
43

reactors that could be replaced at staggered intervals to improve plant

availability [21]. The two-fluid reactor could be scaled down without
Ed seriously affecting breeding gain, but performance was hurt, because in
order to extend graphite life to 8 full-power years, the power density
in the reference design was reduced from 8&0 W/cm? to 20 W/ cmd, at the
expense of raising the specific inventory to 1.3 kg fissile/MW(e).

At about this time a chemical processing development occurred that
greatly improved the prospect for economical breeding in a simpler, single-
fluid reactor. This was the laboratory demonstration of the basic chemi-
Hi cal steps in a continuous process for removing protactinium and uranium

from molten fluoride mixtures that contain thorium fluoride. When

LiF~BeF,~ThF,-UF,-PaFy, salt was contacted with molten bismuth containing
Wa dissolved thorium and lithium, first the U and then the Pa were reduced
and passed from the salt into the liquid metal. The Pa cculd be seques-
tered until it decayed, while the uranium was returned to the fuel salt
by electrolysis. This reductive-extraction process, which could draw
upon technology developed at Argonne and Brookhaven for processing fast
reactor fuels and the U-Bi fuel of an IMFR, appeared practicable for

continuous separation of protactinium. It also appeared that it might
Le be adaptable to removal of rare-earth fission products, thus permitting
a relatively simple processing plant that would keep breeding losses
due to Pa and fission products to acceptably low levels.

After the recognition of the Pa-removal possibility, one-fluid
breeder core designs were explored more thoroughly than in earlier
surveys. As a result, it was found that breeding performance could be
significantly improved by a scheme proposed several years before. By
decreasing the graphite fraction in the outer part of the core, the
neutron spectrum there can be hardened, increasing the fraction of
captures in thorium, while the fission neutron production is more con-
i centrated in the inner, well-moderated part of the core. The effect is

to reduce neutron leakage, which had always been a significant factor in
one-fluid breeders.

Shs

i The combined effect of the new Pa-removal system and the improved

core design was to increase the breeding ratio that could be achieved

economically in a onme-~fluid breeder to about 1.05-1.07. Consequently,

the resource utilization characteristics became acceptable, and in 1968

the major emphasis of the MSRP was shifted to the development of the

simpler single-fluid breeder reactor. Later, substantial improvements

were made in the processing system, including elimination of the elec-

HE trolysis cells, storage of Pa in salt instead of in bismuth, and develop-

ment of a more efficient process for removal of rare earths. (See

Chapter 11.)

Throughout this evolution, the primary long-range objective of the

MSRP remained the same — efficient breeding in the thorium-233y cycle,

This pursuit led by 1970 to the reference conceptual design of a 1000-MW(e)

MSBR plant [22] described in Chapter 3, which is the focus of the MSRP

Gh development effort. In addition, ORNL has recently investigated several
other versions of one-fluid molten-salt reactors that also meet the
essential criteria of safety, reliability, and low power costs, while

i offering one advantage or another relative to the reference MSBR.

 

 
44

One alternate offers a way around the necessity of replacing the
core at 4-year intervals. This difficult job is avoided by simply making
the core of the breeder large enough and the damage flux low enough that Fd
the core graphite will last the 30-year life of the plant. Such a ''per-
manent-core' reactor can have a breeding ratio as high as in the refer-
ence design, but the large core means a greater inventory and longer -
doubling time [23].
Another possible simplification is the elimination of most of the
chemical processing. If it should happen in a breeder plant that prot-
actinium and fission-product removal were stopped, the reactor could i
continue to operate for months, or even years, as a near-breeder with
only the addition of enriched uranium. Altermatively, the reactor could
be built as a converter with no processing (other than perhaps oxide re- GE

_mibval). Some studies indicate that an economical mode of operation would

be to run for 6 equivalent full-power years, recover the uranium by batch

"fluorination (as demonstrated in the MSRE), discard the salt with the

fission products, and resume with fresh carrier salt. Either 235g or
plutonium could be used for startup and feed of such a molten-salt
converter reactor.

A limited amount of conceptual design was done on a 350-MW(e) con- es
verter that positively overcomes the problems of graphite replacement
and tritium containment with a minimum of additional development. The
core is large enough sco that presently available graphite would last
30 years, and tritium containment is ensured by using an intermediate
salt loop containing Hitec [24]. The Hitec, a KNO3-NaNO;-NaNO, mixture,
reacts with tritium to form water, which could be stripped continuously
from the salt. Because the nitrate-nitrite mixture would precipitate Eo
uranium and might react violently with graphite if it leaked into the
fuel system, a compact loop containing LiF-BeF, (which is quite compat-
ible with the fuel) is interposed between the fuel and Bitec systems. EE
The disadvantages of the extra loop and temperature limitations on Hitec
are weighed against simplification of the steam system because of the
relatively low melting point of Hitec (288°F). In any event this study
is an offshoot from the main line of ORNL effort, which is directed at
the high-performance breeder.

In considering the most expeditious route to the ultimate molten-
salt breeder, we have devoted some attention to the conceptual design
of what we call the Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment (MSBE). This reactor
would be designed to operate under conditions at least as severe as those
in a large plant. Design studies show that a graphite damage flux twice Gi
that in the reference MSBR and power density, salt composition, and prot-
actinium and fission-preduct concentrations like those in the reference
design could be attained in a 150-MW(t) reactor with a 4-ft core in a

 

 

7.5-ft vessel [25]. The MSBE would produce steam and would include a
complete processing facility. Although its small dimensions limit its
breeding ratio to about 0.96, the MSBE would provide a definitive test
of all the basic equipment and processes required for a breeder. =

Current Programs

Most of the work on molten-salt reactors is now, as in the past,
concentrated in the Molten-Salt Reactor Program at ORNL, but some signifi-
cant activities are going on elsewhere. This section outlines the MSRP
activities (which are fully described in other chapters) and briefly
describes the other programs.

USAEC Molten-Salt Reactor Program

The Molten-S8alt Reactor Program is included with the LMFBR and the
gas~-cooled fast breeder in the AEC's "high-gain breeder" development fro- _
gram. A total of $64 million has been spent by the MSRP from its incep-
tion in 1957 through fiscal year 1972, including the $10 million cost of
designing and building the MSRE. The MSRP also has benefited from basic
work carried out under the AEC's physical research programs. The MSRP
budget for FY-1973 is $5 million, now allocated approximately as follows:

Reactor design and analysis 127%
Reactor engineering technology 18%
Reactor metals 20%
Graphite 8%
Chemistry and analytical chemistry “167%
Fuel processing 22%
Processing materials 7%

The MSRP design and analysis effort includes evaluation of the
potential of molten-salt reactors and preparation of reference designs
and alternatives that define the research and development needs. This
has been cut back in recent years, and nearly half of the current effort
is a study being done under subcontract by an industrial group headed by
Ebasco Services.

The bulk of the engineering development effort is presently devoted
to two MSRE-scale loops: the Coolant Salt Technology Facility and the
Gas Systems Test Facility, described in Chapter 8. Also under this head-
ing is a study of molten-salt steam generators being carried out by Foster
Wheeler under subcontract to ORNL.

Reactor chemistry is mainly concerned at present with the behavior
of tritium and certain fission products. Analytical development is aimed
at the techniques needed for the operation of a breeder and its processing
plant.

Reactor metals development is focused on improving Hastelloy N (or
finding an alternative) to overcome the problems of neutron embrittlement
and surface cracking by fission products. Sealing to exclude xenon and
better structure for longer life are being investigated in the graphite
program. Processing materials work is now centered on molybdenum fabri-
cation, with some effort on graphite.
46

The emphasis in fuel processing is on reductive extraction — the
chemistry of fluoride-~bismuth and chloride-bismuth systems and engineer-
ing equipment to exploit this chemistry. Fluorination and fuel reconsti-
tution are being developed, and alternate processes such as oxide
precipitation are being studied.

Industrial Studies

There have been two privately funded conceptual design studies and
evaluations of MSR's. The first was by the Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor
Associates (MSBRA), headed by the engineering firm of Black & Veatch and
including five midwestern utilities. The MSBRA study identified problem
areas but concluded that the economics of molten-salt reactors were attrac-
tive relative to light-water reactors, and favored a program leading to
early commercial application of a molten-salt converter [26]. Since the
conclusion of their study in 1970 the MSBRA has been relatively inactive.

The second privately funded organization is the Molten-Salt Group
(MSG), whose formation was announced in 1969 [27, p. 1-1]. The MSG is
headed by Ebasco Services and includes 5 other industrial firms*® and
15 utility companies [28]. In the fall of 1971 the MSG completed an
evaluation of the state of MSR technology [28] and a critique of the
ORNL 1000-MW(e) breeder design [29]. They concluded in the first report
that the existing technology was sufficient to justify construction of
a demonstration plant that would breed, provided the processing works
as intended, but that its maintainability, reliability, costs, and plant
life could not be predicted reliably from the existing technology [28,

p. 6]. In the second report, they concluded that the ORNL reference
design embraced some technological difficulties, but was a suitable
departure point for exploring MSBR technology [29, p. &}. The MSG
members have agreed to support studies of a demonstraticn plant and
alternate molten-salt reactor concepts and an updating of their MSBR
technology evaluation. These studies are proceeding concurrently with

the AEC~funded MSBR design study that is being done by part of the Group's
working force.

There have been other indications of interest in moltemn-salt reactors
by industry and utilities. Many have sent representatives to MSRP annual
information meetings, and several have made private studies of their
possible role in MSR development. A few have assigned staff members to
work in the MSRP (for up to 2 years), and materials producers have con-
tributed by providing experimental graphite and alloys for evaluation.

Foreign Programs

The Indian Department of Atomic Energy is interested in molten-salt
reactors in connection with their vast thorium resources and the antici-
pated availability of plutonium in India for MSR startup. A small program

of research on the MSBR concept has been underway at the Bhabha Atomic
Research Centre since 1969. The program is mostly concerned with investi-
gations of the chemistry of melts containing PuF3;. The USAEC and the DAE
have been exchanging molten-salt information, and an agreement providing
for somewhat broader cooperation is being considered.

Euratom has supported research on various topics pertinent to molten-
salt reactor technolegy. From 1964 to 1966 there was an exchange of
molten-salt information through a formal agreement with the USAEC, but
the exchange is now relatively inactive. Development work invelving con=-
struction and operation of a molten-salt steam generator that was begun
with Euratom support is continuing at Delft University, however. Other
European moclten-salt reactor work was conducted at Kernforschungsanlage
Jiilich in 1963 to 1967, mostly in connection with the epithermal reactor
concept, MOSEL [30]. This has been discontinued.

The UKAEA has supported z small effort on molten-salt reactors for
several years. Studies and a limited amount of experimental work are
continuing, with emphasis on chloride-fueled, lead-cooled fast reactors.

3. DESIGN CONCEPT OF THE SINGLE-FLUID MSBR

M. W. Rosenthal

The preceding chapter discussed the development of molten-salt re-
actor technology and the evolution of design concepts over the years. In
this chapter is described the single-fluid thermal breeder reactor that
was selected in 1968 as the focus of ORNL's development program. At that
time we began the conceptual design of a 1000-MW(e) MSBR that exploited
the new developments in chemical processing and the new approach to core
design that were mentioned earlier, and in 1971 we issued ORNL-4341 [1],
which describes the concept as we visualized it in 1970. In its general
features, that concept continues to be the basis for the ORNL program,
although our ideas about specific features of some of the systems and
components have changed. The ORNL-4541 concept with some modifications
is generally referred to as the reference design. Most of the remaining
chapters of this report treat specific features of the plant, and some-
times newer ideas are presented than those given in ORNL-4541. When this
is done, however, the changes from the earlier design and the reasons for
them are generally discussed.

In addition to ORNL's approach sometimes having changed in the last
two years, the views of Ebasco Services and its associates on specific
features of MSBRs sometimes differ from those of ORNL. The major points
of difference are listed later in this chapter, and more information about
them appears in the later chapters.

Finally, at the end of this chapter we call attention to ways in
which the design of single-fluid MSBRs might differ if the criteria were
changed from those that we followed in selecting the reference concept.

ORNL Reference Design

Objectives

In selecting the reference design, we generally attempted to attain
objectives in four areas: ore conservation, power costs, safety and en-—
vironmental considerations, and technical feasibility. The goals were
not stated quantitatively, however, and our approach has been more to see
how well the concept can be made to do and to decide whether that is ac-
ceptable, than to meet specific criteria. Compromises among the factors
were a necessary and continuous part of the design effort, and our views
of the requirements have shifted some as attitudes in the nation and in
the atomic energy programs have shifted, Nevertheless, we have held to
the following guiding principles.

51
52

Ore Conservation. — We have recognized that MSRs could play either
of two roles in the U.S. nuclear power economy: (1) a "high performance”
breeder that by itself can satisfy both the near-term and long-term needs
for a breeder reactor or (2) a reactor having lower performance or dif-
ferent characteristics that, as a companion to another type of breeder,
could improve the overall nuclear economy. Our goal was a concept that
could satisfy the first requirement, although we recognized that the tech- a
nology needed for the second would in most aspects be less demanding than
that of the high-performance reactor and, thus, would generally become
available also from the work on the other concept. wi

This general objective was translated into more specific requirements
by computing the cumulative uranium ore requirements for the U.S. using
the AEC's projection of nuclear power growth between now and 2000 and
postulating dates of introduction of breeders having various fuel utili-
zation characteristics. These studies showed that, since the breeding
ratic of a thermal breeder cannot greatly exceed 1.0, the fuel inventory
must be kept low to achieve satisfactory performance. Further studies ws
then identified the MSBR design conditions that gave what appeared to be
acceptable uranium ore requirements. Consideration of the availability
and anticipated demands for other materials needed to support a large MSBR i
industry indicated that MSBR development would not be hindered by short-
ages and rising costs [2].

Power Cost. — The second objective was that the power costs of the
breeders at the time of their introduction be less than those of the non-
breeders so that normal economic considerations would make it desirable
for the utility owners to build the breeders in preference to other re-
actors. Again we did not attempt to set specific cost goals but instead
performed cost estimates for the MSBR in parallel to estimates for light-
water reactors made using the same cost data and economic assumptions. We
considered that the MSBR concept was acceptable as long as its estimated
power costs fell below those of the light-water reactors, and particularly
if this were true at near-term uranium ore costs. This comparison is, of ca
course, highly inexact, since it not only involves uncertainties in MSBR
costs but also uncertainties in what light-water reactor costs will be at
the time breeders are introduced. However, it provided an indication of
whether the MSBR would give low enough power cost to displace the con-
verters.

Ei

 

Safety and Environmental Considerations. — As with other types of
reactors, the major safety consideration has been the protection of the
public from exposure to radicactivity, both as the consequence of an ac- GH
cident and from lower level release during normal operations or mainte-
nance. MSBRs differ from solid-fuel reactors, net only in that the fuel
is in liquid form, but also in that the processing plant is at the reactor -
site and an integral part of the plant. Consequently, a different set
of safety matters requires consideration from those of sclid-fuel systems.
Our approach to the safety question has been to examine the basic consid-
erations that relate to safety and to attempt in the design to provide wi
 

 

53

means for treating each of these adequately. In considering how these
factors affect the concept, we have tried to make the design such that
it could be located on any site acceptable for other kinds of reactors.

The guidelines on permissible release of fission products have
changed in recent times. This has required that we re-examine some of
the approaches towards low-level releases that appeared acceptable earlier,
and, in particular, we have had to devote more attention to means for
keeping the tritium release low. Safety and environmental considerations
are treated together in Chapter 14.

Technical Feasibility. — The various molten-salt reactor concepts
identified in the preceding chapter involve technology that ranges from
that which is well in hand to features that require inventions to accom-
plish. In the reference design, we have attempted to restrict the re-
quirements to technology that either has already been demonstrated or can
reasonably be expected to emerge from am intensive development program
in time to be used on a reactor experiment whose construction would start
in a few years. Generally this meant that increases in scale were ac-
cepted, as were foreseeable improvements in materials and processes, but
features that required inventions or extremely large improvements in per-
formance were excluded. As examples, pumps having many times the capacity
of the MSRE pumps were specified, and a gas sparging system that removes
xenon more effectively than the MSRE system was used in the design. How-
ever, a seven-fold improvement in the radiation resistance of graphite
that would make it last thirty years was considered an excessive extrapo-
lation; and, in fact, the graphite lifetime was specified as 3 x 1022 nvt
(>50 keV), which is the maximum dose small samples have been shown to
withstand without excessive volume increases. Thus means for replacing
graphite were included in the plant design.

One specific requirement set down at the beginning had a strong in-
fluence on the design and performance of the concept: replacement or
repair of all components whose failure is credible or whose lifetime is
expected to be less than thirty years must be made feasible and accom-
plishable in a reasonable time.

 

General Concept of the Single-Fluid Breeder

 

A single-fluid breeder reactor is illustrated in simple form in
Fig. 3.1. The key feature of the concept, as mentioned in the preceding
chapter, is the use of a single salt that contains both uranium and
thorium. To make this acceptable, ways had to be found for reducing neu-
tron leakage from the core without using a separate fertile blanket, and
means had to be developed for excluding most of the 233pa from the high
neutron flux region of the reactor. The former is accomplished by making
the salt volume fraction in the outer region of the reactor several times
as great as it is in the main part of the core. By varying the salt
volume fraction and hence the moderator-to-fuel ratio, the core is made
to be well moderated but the outer region is undermoderated, and here
thorium captures predominate to form a low-power—density fertile blanket.

The protactinium is removed by extraction from the fuel salt in a contin-
uous processing plant described later, which holds it up outside of the
core until it has decayed into 233y,

The basic features of the concept are described in the paragraphs
that follow, and particular systems and components are described in
greater details in later chapters. Further information can be found
ww in ORNL-4541 [1].

sa Features of the Reference Design. - The fuel salt is a mixture of
the fluorides of beryllium, lithium-7, thorium, and uranium having the
following composition and melting point:

BeF» 16 NaF 8
ThF, 12
si UF, 0.3
Liquidus temperature, °F 930 725

Other properties are listed in Chapter 5.
Lithium-7 and beryllium fluorides, which have low neutron absorption
i cross sections, are used to obtain a composition that has a liquidus
temperature and other physical properties that are acceptable for reactor
use. Fuel salt is pumped through a core formed from bare graphite
stringers and blocks; the salt does not wet graphite and will not pene-
trate inte it if material having small pore sizes is used. To exclude
xenon from the graphite, its surface is sealed to a low permeability by
deposition of pyrolytic carbon. A cross section of the core used in the
ws ORNL~4541 design is shown in Fig. 3.2. The reactor vessel and the top
head are seen to have been extended above the core far enough for a me-
chanical closure to be used and for the closure to be directly accessible
5 when the head must be removed.
Heat is transferred from the fuel salt to a coolant salt in an in-
termediate heat exchanger. A eutectic mixture of sodium fluoroborate
. and sodium fluoride is used as the coolant; its composition and properties
have been listed above. The coolant salt passes through a steam gener-
ator where supercritical steam at 1000°F and 3600 psi is generated, yield-
ing an overall thermal efficiency of 44%.
“5 Drain tanks connected to the fuel and coolant salt systems can con-
tain the salt when necessary. The fuel salt drain tank has a reliable
natural circulation cooling system for disposing of fission-product decay
heat. This system uses NaK to transfer heat from the drain tank to tanks
of water, where it is either disposed of by forced cooling or, in an emer-
gency, by boiling away of the water. The drain tank is also used as the
initial holdup volume for the off-gas system, so that its heat removal
“a system is always in use and is not just called on to come into operation
during an emergency.

All metal surfaces that contact salt are made from Hastelloy N. (As
described in a later chapter, some other material may be substituted.)

The primary system and the steam generator systems are located in
separate cells, as shown in Fig. 3.3. These cells serve as shielding and
containment barriers for radioactive materials and have controlled atmos-
phere which can be heated above the liquidus temperature of the salt or
cooled to prevent overheating of the reactor equipment from decay energy
when the salt is drained. Access for maintenance can be achieved by re-
moval of shield blocks at the top of the cell. Since the graphite must
be replaced at intervals, a special shielded carrier is shown above the
reactor for transporting it from the core to another cell for disposal.

Noble gases have very low solubility in the fuel salt, which makes
it possible to strip them from the salt and reduce the poisoning effect
of !35%e. This stripping is accomplished by injecting bubbles of helium
into a side stream and subsequently removing them with centrifugal sepa-
rators. The off-gas containing the xenon and krypton is then passed
through charcoal traps in a cleanup system.

To achieve good breeding in an MSBR, some of the salt-soluble fission
products, and particularly the rare earths, must be removed rapidly. A
processing concept for doing this in conjunction with the removal of
protactinium has been developed. The process, illustrated in greatly
simplified form in Fig. 3.4, consists of fluorination to remove uranium
followed by reductive extraction of protactinium, and finally removal of
rare earths and some of the other fission products by the 'metal-transfer
process." The processing system is described in greater detail in Chapter
11.

In the fluorinator, uranium is volatilized from the salt as UFg by
contacting it with fluorine. The reductive extraction process uses liquid
bismuth containing dissolved lithium to extract the protactinium from the
fuel salt and to transfer it to another salt; here it remains in solution
until it decays to uranium and then is volatilized with fluorine for re-
turn to the reactor.

Liquid bismuth is used in the metal-transfer process to extract rare-
earth fission products from the uranium- and protactinium-free salt and
transfer them to lithium chloride, hence the name of the process. The
fission products are ultimately extracted from the lithium chloride for
storage and disposal. As shown in Fig. 3.4, the UFg finally is injected
into the purified fuel salt, which returns it to solution and prepares
the salt for return to the reactor. In the reference plant, the fuel salt
inventory of the reactor is processed on a ten-day cycle, which means that
the flow rate of the salt through the processing plant is about 0.9 gpm.

The design and performance characteristics of the MSBR are summarized
in Table 3.1, and more details are presented in other chapters.

Alternatives to the Reference Design

Ebasco Variations from ORNL Design

Ebasco Services and their associates in Reference 3 present their
conceptual design of a single~fluid molten-salt breeder reactor that
is expected to satisfy the same general criteria that were the basis
for the ORNL design. This study represents only the first phase of
a series of tasks that Ebasco is to undertake for CRNL. Its objective
was to identify the general features of the concept, which is being
examined in more detail in subsequent studies.

For this initial examination, Ebasco was restricted in some aspects
to using conditions specified by ORNL; for example, the composition of
the salt and the salt volume fraction in the core were specified, and
the performance characteristics cf the processing plant were defined
for Ebasco and were not to be studied. However, in their examination
of other aspects of the plant, Ebasco in some cases selected different
ways of designing features or components of the reactor from those in
the ORNL reference design. Notable were the following:

1. In order to avoid the difficulties of sealing the interior surfaces,
Ebasco uses a slab geometry for the graphite core elements rather
than the square element with a central hole used by ORNL.

2. They propose to replace individual graphite assemblies rather than
replacing the core as a unit, as proposed by ORNL. This allows some
elements to be left in the core longer than others, and it reduces
the difficulties of handling the large, radioactive core.

3. Equipment and piping in the reactor cell are supported from the
bottom rather than from the top, and three tiers of horizontal
seismic restraints are provided,

4. The piping is lined to mitigate the effect of shock by thermal tran-
sients,

5. The coolant pump is put in the cold leg to insure inleakage to the
primary system in case a heat-exchanger tube leaks,

6. The fuel-salt storage tank is pressurized to improve the performance
of the jet pumps that return salt te the reactor and to permit enough
additional dilution of the off-gas for it to be returned directly to
the reactor without passage through the 47-hour charcoal beds shown
in the ORNL design.

Some of these and other changes proposed by Ebasco and the companies
associated with it appear to us to be useful improvements over the ORNL-
4541 design and will be incorporated in future designs and factored into
the development program.
62

Low-Power-Density Core

 

In the earlier discussion of the principles followed in selecting
the ORNL reference design, we noted that if a thermal breeder alone is
to satisfy the requirements of a growing nuclear economy, the fuel in-
ventory must be kept reasonably low. If this requirement is altered be-
cause the molten-salt breeder is not the only breeder in use or because wt
of either a lower rate of nuclear power growth or a greater availability
of uranium ore, then the requirements for low inventory will be eased.

This change could lead to a design with a lower power density core, which »
would have some advantages over the reference design. For example, if

the power density, and hence the neutron flux, were reduced enough for

the graphite to last thirty years, some important simplifications could

be made: the equipment for replacing the core and for disposing of the a
spent graphite would not be needed, the design of the core itself could
be simplified, and an all-welded reactor vessel without a removable top
could be used. In addition, reducing the power density lowers the ve- a
locity of the fuel salt in the core, which can lower the mass transfer
rate of xenon enough to obviate the need for sealing the graphite.

The major disadvantage of the lower power density is the increased .

fissile inventory, which some studies [4, p. 27] have shown to be 40 to
50% higher than that of the reference design. (Interestingly, the average
power density can be significantly greater than 4/30 times that of the

4-year-life design because of improved power flattening and reduced Eo
graphite temperature peaking in the large core.} Whether the power cost

would be higher or lower than the reference design is uncertain. The

larger core and drain tank should require larger cell and building vol- i
umes, which add to the cost; however, elimination of the cost of sealing
the graphite and of providing means to replace it, and avoiding the ocut-
of-pocket replacement costs, provide offsetting savings.

In spite of the advantages offered by reduced power density, the
lower fuel inventory of the reference design remains a desirable goal,
and the reference design continues to be the focus of ORNL's program.

Nevertheless, low power density may be appropriate for early power plants, GE
with later evolution to higher power density. This would be particularly
appropriate if more radiation-resistant graphites are developed that per-
mit 30-year core life to be attained with less penalty in fuel inventory. -

4. REACTOR PHYSICS AND FUEL CYCLES

A, M. Perry

Introduction

Reactor physics considerations in the design of molten-salt reactors
are, for the most part, similar to those for other thermal reactors. In
particular, the graphite-moderated MSR has much in common with the High-
Temperature Gas-Cooled Reactor (HTGR): graphite moderator at an average
temperature of 600-700°C, Th-233U fuel cycle, and similar fuel-moderator
ratios. Thus, much of the design technology of thermal reactors in gen-
eral and of HTGR's in particular is directly applicable toc the MSR. This
includes nuclear data and methods for calculating neutron fluxes, power
distributions, effects of heterogeneities in core structure, control rod
worths, temperature coefficients of reactivity, and so forth.

There are, however, a few important differences. The need to estab-
lish accurately the reactivity lifetime of the fuel, so important to the
economics of solid-fuel reactors, has no analog in the MSR, since fuel
can readily be added or removed, as required, in order to maintain criti-
cality. The problem of accurate calculation of the reactivity life of
the fuel is thus replaced by the problem of designing, building, and op-~
erating devices to maintain the desired composition of the fluid fuel.
This is not the same as adjusting the feed rate for solid-fuel reactors
with continuous on-stream refueling, since in the latter case the dis-
charge exposure of the fuel remains a crucial economic parameter.

Similarly, the problem of calculating power-density distributions in
MSR cores takes a somewhat different form than in solid-fuel reactors.

In particular, since the fuel is constantly mixed and its composition

‘remains essentially uniform throughout the reactor, the problem of time-

dependent power distributions is much less important in fluid-fuel than
in solid-fuel reactors.

With respect to their dynamic behavior (i.e., the short-term time-
dependence of operating variables such as power and neutron flux levels,
fuel temperatures, etc.) the circulating fuel reactors — and especially
those operating with 233y fuel — have unique characteristics requiring
special study, and these will be discussed in a subsequent section of this
chapter. We simply note for the moment that an MSBR typically has a much
smaller delayed neutron fraction than do other types of reactors and the
transport of the delayed neutron emitters in the moving fuel alters the
response of the reactor to changes in reactivity. On the other hand, most
of the power generation is in the circulating fuel itself, which is also
the primary reactor coolant; thus, no heat transfer lags between fuel and
coolant are present. As we shall see, these two factors together produce
safe, stable operating characteristics over a wide range of core design
parameters.

The central question in the physics of the Molten-Salt Breeder Re-
actor would thus appear to be the breeding ratio itself. This is so be-
cause of the very small breeding gain (breeding ratio minus one) that is

65
66

characteristic of thermal breeder reactors. Whereas fast breeders typi-
cally achieve their disirablie breeding performance with large breeding
gains, in combination with relatively large fuel inventories, the thermal
breeder, with a much smaller breeding gain, must succeed by maintaining

a relatively low fuel inventory.* Because the breeding gain is low, the
expected performance of a thermal breeder reactor is especially sensitive
to uncertainties in the calculated breeding ratio, and it becomes neces- wd
sary to establish the neutron balance in the reactor, on which the breed-

ing ratio depends, with greater precision than would be required for a

fast breeder reactor. ;

Breeding in Molten-Salt Reactors

The quality of performance of a breeder reactor, in a nuclear power
economy postulated te follow a particular pattern of growth, is often i.
evaluated in terms of the cumulative amount of uranium ore that would
have to be mined up to the time when the breeders themselves could sat-
isfy all requirements for fissile materials. It is generally recognized
that this quantity depends both on the breeding ratio of the reactor and
on its specific fuel inventory.

In Fig. 4.1 (also shown as Fig. 1.2}, we show the anticipated ore
requirements for a U.S. nuclear power industry based on varicus postulated wa
combinations of present-day ccnverters and possible future breeders, having
different breeding ratios and specific fuel inventories (kg fissile/MW(e)}).

The total installed nuclear—electric capacity is assumed to reach 140 GW{e) Gs
in 1980 and 930 GW(e) in 2000, and to increase thereafter at a rate of
100 GW(e) per vear. It is further assumed that only light-water reactors
are built prior to 1982, that the first breeders come on line in 1982 and
that only breeders are added to the system after 1998. Also shown on
Fig. 4.1 are the price ranges within which the USAEC currently estimates

that incremental amounts of uranium may be available from domestic U.S.

ores, including estimated probable resources as well as reasonably-assured we
reserves.

A cross-plot of data taken from curves like those of Fig. 4.1 pro-
duces a plot of resource requirements vs specific fuel inventory, for
different values of the doubling time, as shown in Fig. 4.2 (also shown
as Fig. 1.3). It may be noted from these curves that a breeder reactor
with a (compound) doubling time of 20 years, and a specific inventory
of 1.5 kg/Mi(e), would be expected to require very little more ore than
a breeder with a doubling time of 10 years and a specific inventory of
4 kg/Md(e). (These might be, respectively, a thermal breeder with a
breeding ratic of 1.07 and a fast breeder with a breeding ratio of 1.35.) i

The combined importance of these two factors, breeding gain and ws
fuel inventory, will be explained im the next section.

Thus, a thermal breeder reactor with a low specific fuel inventory
may have breeding performance comparable to a fast breeder with a larger
fuel inventory, even if the doubling time of the fast breeder is much
shorter than that of the thermal breeder. However, it is clear that the
low breeding gain of the thermal breeder makes its performance more sen-
sitive to uncertainties in breeding ratio, and it becomes necessary to
examine carefully the sources and probable magnitudes of such uncertain-
ties.

Uncertainties

The calculated neutron balance for.the reference single~fluid MSBR
is shown in Table 4.1. This neutron balance is based on the current
metal~transfer chemical-processing flowsheet, with a 10-day processing
cycle, and the normalization is such that a total of one neutron is ab-
sorbed in the fissile nuclides, 233U + 235y., The breeding ratio, with
this normalization, is equal to the number of captures in 232Th and 23%U
(absorptions less fissions) minus absorptions in 233Pa, i.e., BR = 0.9938
+ 0.0815 - 0.0045 = 1.0708. The number of neutrons available for capture
in the fertile materials depends on the neutron production ne, per neutron
absorbed in fissile fuel, and on the losses to moderator, coolant, fission
products, and leakage. Thus, the greatest single source of uncertainty
in breeding ratio is in the neutron production term, ne, which depends
mainly on the spectrum—-averaged value of n for 233y,

Perry {1] has made a detailed analysis of the effect on breeding
ratic (and on fuel cycle cost) of uncertainties in the cross sections of
all core constituents and his results are summarized in Tables 4.2 and
4.3.

Since these uncertainties are all independent, they may be combined
by taking the square root of the sum of the squares as the overall uncer-
tainty in breeding ratio or in fuel-cycle cost attributable to cross-
section uncertainties. The resulting values,

and

2 (sFa0)? [1/2 = 0.026 mill/kWhr(e)

reflect primarily the uncertainty in the average thermal n of 233y (e.g.,
SB nv 0.012). (If all the assessed cross-section uncertainties are added
up in the same direction, the result is Z(8B), = 0.05 and £(8FCC)i = 0.08.
We regard this, however, as an extremely improbable combination of cir-
cumstances, a view that is strengthened by the satisfactory results of
criticality calculations described below.)

The absence of thorium from this list is not an oversight;* in a
real sense thorium absorbs all neutrons that other materials do not,
and in principle the thorium concentration would be adjusted so that
this will be the case. In practice, it is easier to adjust the uranium
concentration, so that over short periods (if the effective absorption
cross-section of thorium were much different than expected) the critical
concentration of uranium might prove to be slightly different than ex-
pected. However, over longer periods the uranium concentration may be
placed at almost any desired level, and the thorium adjusted for criti-
cality. In any event, on the basis of critical-experiment results, we
would not anticipate appreciable deviations of these concentrations
from calculated values.

Further support for the calculated values of n has been derived from
a measurement in the MSRE of the capture/fission cross section ratios for
both 233y and 235°U, Measured and calculated values in the MSRE spectrum,
which was similar to the reference MSBR spectrum, are compared in Table
4.4. The agreement is well within the experimental errors, which corre-
spond to less than *0.01 in average n. Further details of the experiments
and calculations may be found in References 3 and 4.

The fission~-product poison fraction shown in Table 4.1 (0.015) in-
cludes a nominal allowance of 0.005 to cover 135%e, other noble-gas fis-
sion preducts, and any of their daughter products that may be produced by
decay of noble gases within the graphite moderator. This is done to avoid
the necessity of combining the complex gas-stripping and diffusion model
with the neutronic and fuel-cycle calculation, in which the explicit
treatment of the noble gases assumes their removal from the reactor on a
50-sec cycle. While a poison fraction no greater than 0.005 is prebably
attainable for 13%%e alone, it presently seems much less likely that the
combined effect of all the noble gases (and their daughters born in the
graphite) can be kept as low as 0.005. The additional poisoning effect
of the other nuclides in question has been calculated to be about 20% of
that of 13%Xe itself, at the end of a 4~yr graphite life. Thus, an addi-
tional poison fraction of 0.001~0.002 may occur.

As was pointed out above, the other principal factor in breeding
performance — the fuel inventory — is insensitive to reactor physics
uncertainties, because of the inherent flexibility of the molten-salt
reactor with respect to adjustments in fissile and fertile material con-
centrations. Over a very considerable range of fuel concentrations,
essentially any desired value can be achieved and maintained. The ques-
tion is only that of the breeding ratio that corresponds to a particular
fuel concentration, as already discussed. It may be noted in this con-
nection that the reference MSBR has not been chosen on the basis of
highest possible breeding ratio. A modest increase in breeding ratio [5]
could be achieved by increasing the fuel inventory (and thus decreasing
losses in competitive neutron absorbers such as the moderator and the

Other nuclides are omitted because their poison fractions are very
small.

carrier salt). Instead, the design has been optimized on the basis of
the ratio of the breeding gain to the square of the (specific) fuel in=-
ventory, which is an approximate measure of the cumulative uranium ore
requirement for establishing a self-sufficient power economy based on
breeders.

The inventory is nonetheless subject to some uncertainty, to the
extent that the volume of fuel salt in the system depends on details of
the mechanical and thermal-hydraulic design of the system, including heat
exchangers, piping, plena, etc. It may be noted that an increase of 200
ft3 in fuel-salt volume, without any reoptimization, would produce a frac-
tional change in the ratio G/12 of about the same size as the (fractional)
uncertainty in G{(= BR - 1) that arises from nuclear data and reactor
physics uncertainties.

There are additional potential sources of error in the breeding ratio
that lie outside the area of reactor physics. These include the chemical
behavior of certain fission products, notably the 'noble' metals, Nb, Mo,
Ru, Te; a part of these fission products is known te be deposited and
held on primary-circuit surfaces, including core graphite. The estimated
breeding ratio for our reference MSBR design includes an allowance [6]
for deposition of these nuclides on graphite to an extent (i.e., 10% of
the amounts produced} that appears reasonable in view of data obtained
from samples from the MSRE and from an in-pile loop.* The effect of
these nuclides on the breeding ratio is shown in Fig. 4.3 as a function
of the in-core life cof the graphite. For a 4-year graphite life, the
average poisoning effect is about 0.004. Since the behavier of these
fission products is not fully understood (see Chap. 5), we cannot exclude
the possibility that a larger fraction of these fission-product poisons
might be retained by the core graphite.

Other factors that could have an adverse affect on breeding perform-
ance would be failure to achieve adequate sealing of graphite surfaces
against adsorption of 135%e or adequate stripping of xenon from the cir-
culating salt, failure of the chemical plant to remove fission products
from the salt, or non-recoverable losses of fissile material due to upsets
in reactor or chemical plant operation. The first of these would at most
reduce the breeding ratio by 0.015, while the last two would cause tem—
porary reductions in breeding ratio pending restoration of normal plant
operations.

According to the curves of Fig. 4.2, the cumulative resource require-
ments are less sensitive to errors or uncertainties in doubling time for
low~specific~inventory breeders than for high-specific-inventory breeders.
This is partly due to the irreducible ore requirements for converter re-
actors, assumed to be built during the early years of the postulated

growth pattern, as well as to the smaller absolute amounts of inventory
required for the low-inventory breeders. For example, a system predicated
on meclten-salt reactors with a specific inventory of 1.5 kg/MW{e) and a
doubling time of 35 years would require perhaps 2.5 x 108 short tons of
U30g, while a system using breeders with the same inventory but a 20-year
doubling time would require about 2 x 10% short tons of U30g.*% Thus, a
reduction of breeding ratio from 1.07 to 1.04, should it occur for any

of the reasons outlined above, would not markedly impair the ability of
the molten-salt reactor to limit the amount of ore necessary to achieve

a self-sufficient nuclear power economy.

Reactor Statics

Multiplication Factor

 

The multiplication factor of a reactor, like the breeding ratio, is
a direct reflection of the neutron balance. While criticality calcula-
tions, because of the adjustability of fuel concentration, are not of
crucial importance per se, they serve to establish reactor conditions
for which other quantities such as contrel rod worths and reactivity co-
efficients must be determined, and they may provide additional confidence
in the calculated neutron balance on which estimates of breeding perform~
ance also depend.

The agreement between predicted and observed critical fuel concen-
trations in the MSRE was gratifying (see Table 4.5), but subsequent
studies [7] have shown that the calculated concentrations are rather
sensitive to permissible changes in nuclear data, to methods cf calcu-
lating neutron transport cross sections, and to details of the reactor
representation used in the computational model. However, it has also
been shown that practically all of this sensitivity (up to 3% in 8k) is
associated with neutron leakage, which in the MSRE was unusually high:
31% of all neutrons leaked from the fueled regions of the reactor with
235y fuel and 35% with the 233U fuel. In a large molten-salt power
reactor, the neutron leakage would be lower by a factor of 20-30, and
the sensitivity to neutron transport effects proportionately less.

A series of criticality and reactivity measurements [8] has recently
been performed on behalf of the MSR Program in the High Temperature Lat~
tice Test Reactor (HTLTR) at the Battelle Northwest Laboratory. In these
experiments, the molten-salt fuel was simulated by coated-particle fuels
(Th0, and UO,-ThO, grains in a graphite matrix) in concentrations and
geometrical arrangements representative of the reference MSBR core. Re-
activity effects of fuel salt constituents such as Li, Be, and F were

The reference MSBR is calculated to have an inventory of 1.5 kg/
MW(e), breeding ratio of 1.07, and doubling time of 19 years.

individually measured in a centrally located sample position, as were
those of simulated control rods and of variations in lattice cell geom—
etry. Measurements were made over a range of temperatures from 20° to
1000°C.

Although analysis and interpretation of these measurements is not
yet complete, results sc far available show good agreement between meas-
ured and calculated quantities. A comparison of k values is shown in
Table 4.6. (While the calculated and measured values compare very favor-
ably, it must be acknowledged that we do not really claim such high ac-
curacy for our calculations, since changes larger than the differences
noted in Table 4.6 would be produced by variations in cross sections well
within our present range of uncertainty.)

It thus appears that presently available data and methods can yield
predictions of k, that are reliable to within less than 1%.

Power-Density Distributions

 

Calculations of power-density distributions in a large MSR have much
in common with those for other power reactor cores with low leakage and
k close to 1.0. In particular, we would expect a high sensitivity of
power distribution to small variations in k_ within the reactor core.
While no direct experimental data for molten-salt reactors are available,
much relevant experience has been acquired with large gas-cooled graphite
reactors and with heavy-water reactors. It is usual with such reactors
to provide instrumentation to measure power distributions with some degree
of accuracy, and to provide small amounts of reactivity control, distri-
buted over the core, to regulate the power distribution. We would expect
to require some means for making routine measurements of the power dis-
tribution, at least in early molten-salt power reactors, as well as some
means of controlling it. (Such measurements would not necessarily require
in-core flux sensors. Other possibilities would include salt-outlet-
temperature measurements or neutron-flux measurements at several points
outside the reactor vessel.)

However, the tclerance for uncertainty in the power distribution may
be somewhat greater in molten—salt reactors than in most other types of
power reactor. The principal limitation appears to be radiation damage
to the graphite, which depends primarily on the integrated power density
over long periods of operation. Both the neutron fluence and the graphite
temperature have an important influence on changes in graphite properties,
and both would be affected by deviations of power density from expected
values. However it can be shown for the reference MSBR that temperature
effects are much smaller than the direct effect of fast neutron flux,
which is approximately proportional to the power density.

If a 10% deviation of power density from its nominal value should
persist over the life of the core, the graphite, instead of returning
just to its original volume, would expand about 2% (i.e., 0.02 82/2,

0.06 8V/V), which is probably about the limit of what could be tolerated.
Considerably larger short-term deviations in power density should be ac-
ceptable, particularly if adequate steps are taken in the detailed design
of the reactor to ensure good mixing of the salt in the core outlet
plenum.

Reactivity Control .

Requirements for reactivity control in molten-salt reactors are some-
what different than in most solid-fuel reactors. Long-term reactivity
changes are to be compensated by adjustments in fuel salt composition.
Shutdown rods worth a few percent in 8k are likely tc be required, but
these would normally be fully withdrawn for the reactor. Small amounts
of reactivity adjustment for normal operational maneuvering should be
available, and if possible these control devices should not have an ad-
verse effect on the breeding ratio. We therefore visualize an adequate
complement of neutron-absorbing safety rods which would be fully withdrawn
during normal operations. Maneuvering, as now planned, will be accom-
plished by graphite rods which displace fuel salt from special passages
in the core.

Techniques for calculating the effectiveness of the absorber rods are
well established, and generally reliable to within less than 107 of the
rod worth, which is quite sufficient. Predicted and measured rod worths
in the MSRE agreed to within 5% of the rod worth, as may be seen from
Table 4.7.

The graphite displacement rods, to be used for maneuvering, are un-
conventional. Their reactivity worth is expected to be small (e.g.,
8k/k ~ 0.001 per rod) and they depend on somewhat different physical
effects than dc normal "black" absorber rods. Calculations show that
displacement of fuel salt by the graphite rods increases reactivity,
rather than decreasing it as one might expect, and it appears that changes
in resonance neutron capture in neighboring fuel passages are at least
partly responsible.* Some of the reactivity specimens in the HTLTR ex-
periments [6] gave qualitative confirmation of the positive reactivity
associated with displacing fuel by graphite, but calculations precisely
corresponding to the experimental situations have not yet been made.

The reactivity requirement for maneuvering is not a rigid one, but it
will be necessary to establish more firmly the effectiveness of the graph-
ite rods before they could be adopted finally as the basis for MSBR design.

Reactivity Coefficients

 

4 large single-fluid MSBR has temperature coefficients of reactivity
(see Chap. 14, Table 14.1) which are not especially large for a fluid-fuel
reactor. Both the overall, isothermal temperature coefficient, and the
coefficient of the salt alone represent small (algebraic) sums of much
larger individual effects, e.g., thorium Doppler coefficient (negative)
and moderator coefficient (positive). Direct experimental confirmation

*A similar effect, with a similar explanation, is noted in natural-
uranium graphite reactors, where removal of all fuel from a single channel
increases reactivity. In this case, good agreement is found between
experiments and calculations.

of the calculated magnitudes of all these effects has not been obtained
for a molten-salt reactor, though all the important effects will be in-
ferred from the-HTLTR-MSBR lattice experiments. The criticality calcu-
lations cited in Table 4.6 show satisfactory agreement between measured
and calculated changes in k, over the temperature range between 20° and
1000°C. Although effects of salt expansion are not directly reproduced
in these experiments, the major components of the overall temperature
coefficient (Doppler and thermal-base coefficients) are included. Fuel
density effects were tested in one of the reactivity samples, but analy-
sis of these measurements is not vet complete.

Calculated and measured temperature coefficients for the MSRE [9]
showed agreement to within about 10%, but these depended mainly on neu-
tron leakage effects; although the agreement is encouraging, the results
are not directly applicable to a large MSR.

The reactivity effects of fuel additions were measured in MSRE for
both 235U and 2330 fuel loadings, with results shown in Table 4.8.

Radiation Calculations

 

Design problems related to radiation transport, such as shielding,
radiation damage, and gamma or neutron heating, present a somewhat differ-
ent aspect in molten-salt reactors than in many other reactor types, but
this is because of the mobility of the fuel and other radiation sources
(e.g., fission product gases), and not because of any essential differ-
ences in the transport problem per se.

In gas-cooled reactors such as the natural-uranium, graphite reac-
tors, radiation streaming from fuel channels was peculiarly important.
In LMFBR's, neutron penetration through thick composite regions of iron
and sodium has proved to be an important problem requiring new experi-
mental data and improved methods of analysis. In the case of the molten
salt reactor, while it may be premature to conclude that no unique prob-
lems of radiation transport will appear, none are now evident. Instead,
it seems apparent that the principal problems will relate to determining
the distributions of the sources of radiation, and especially of fission
products, throughout the reactor plant. These aspects of the problem
are treated elsewhere in this report.

Reactor Dynamics

Questions of control and safety of molten-salt reactors are discussed
elsewhere in this report (Chapters 10 and 14). It is our purpose here
only to clarify the status of éur understanding of the relevant neutronic
characteristics of the reactor.

Circulating—-fuel reactors, especially if operated on the Th-233y
fuel cycle, have unusually small delayed-neutron fractiens. Calculated
values for molten-salt breeder reacters fall in the range 0.0010-0.0015,
depending on details of reactor design. At the same time, the graphite-
moderated MSR, in common with most other graphite-moderated reactors, has
a very long prompt-neutron generation time, e.g., 0.4 msec.

With respect to temperature coefficients of reactivity the situ-
ation is qualitatively similar to that of the natural-uranium, graphite-
moderated, gas-cooled reactors, i.e., a prompt negative temperature
coefficient for the fuel is accompanied by a delayed positive coefficient
for the moderator. In the case of the reference MSBR, these coefficients
nearly offset each other in magnitude. This gives rise to a small slow
overall coefficient, in contrast to the much larger negative prompt co-
efficient.

We have not found it very useful to try to formulate simple general-
ized statements about the dynamic behavior of MSR's in terms of these
underlying characteristics. Instead, we have tried to develop reliable
computational models for predicting their behavior, and have gained con-
fidence in the use of these models by comparison with observed behavior
in the case of the MSRE.

Effects of Fuel Circulation

 

Models for the reactivity effect of fuel circulation must take into
account the transport of delayed neutron precursors in the moving fuel
and the weighted contributions of delayed neutrons emitted cutside the
core, as well as the skewed distribution of delayed neutrons emitted
within the core. The usual reactor kinetics equations must be modified
to take these effects explicitly into acccunt, since their importance is
not independent of reactor period. Confirmation of the models developed
for the MSRE was obtained during the control rod calibration experiments.
The reactivity effect of fuel eirculation {with 2335y fuel) was measured
to be 0.212 %# 0.004% Sk/k, and the calculated value was 0.222% [9].
(Neglect of delayed neutrons emitted in the upper and lower plena yields
a calculated value of 0.30% 8k/k.) In addition, good agreement was ob-
tained between rod calibration curves inferred from period measurements
using the conventional inhour equation with the fuel stationary, and the
modified equations with the fuel circulating. The reactivity effect of
fuel circulation is thus believed to be well understood.

Frequency Response and Reactor Stability

 

The dynamic behavior of a multiple loop system, such as the MSRE or
the reference MSBR, depends of course on the properties of all parts of
the system and on the way the parts are linked to form the system.
Neutronic characteristics are important, but so are power densities and
heat capacities, heat transfer coefficients, salt circulation rates, etc.
The short-term time-dependence cof reactor parameters such as neutron flux
or core-outlet salt temperature will depend at short times (or high fre-
quencies) primarily on the characteristics of the reactor itself, while
at longer times (and at lower frequencies) the influence of other parts of
the system will be felt.
86

A study of the inherent dynamic behavicr of a system in the absence
of any supervisory controls can reveal the extent to which the system
tends to be self-controlling, can help to identify behavioral character-
istics of the system that might require the intervention of the control
system, and can help to establish requirements for the control system
such as the necessary response times.

In studies of the dynamic characteristics of the MSRE and of prospec- ss
tive molten-salt power reactors, several complementary techniques have
been used {11], including analysis of frequency response and of transient
response to various perturbations. Stability has been studied by several
standard techniques and sensitivity studies have explored the effects on
stability of variations in important properties of the systems.

All of these studies have shown the MSRE and MSBR designs to be
stable, tractable systems, with stability typically increasing (induced
oscillations more strongly damped) with increasing power level over the
ranges studied (generally (0-1007 of design power).

In order to test the validity of these models, an extensive series of a
dynamic tests was carried out at the MSRE, with both 2357 and 233y fuel
{12}. The tests, like the theoretical studies, included transient response
and frequency response characteristics. Comparisons of test results with
theoretical predictions have been very satisfactory. As an example, we
show in Fig. 4.4 the measured and predicted frequency response of the MSRE
at 7 MW(th) with 2330 fuel. 4s is typical cf all the frequency response Lo
curves obtained for the MSRE and for MSBR's, this one is rather smooth Ei
and featureless, with a broad hump in the gain curve between the high-
frequency roll-off due to delayed neutrons and the falling gain at low
frequencies due to the negative temperature coefficients. The small or
feature in the neighborhood of 0.25 rads/sec is associated with the cir-
culation time of the fuel salt in the primary loop (25 sec). In the
experiments, this feature has in all cases been somewhat less pronounced
than in the calculations, indicating more mixing in the outlet plenum,
piping, and heat exchanger than is included in the theoretical models
tested.

Except at very low power levels, the gain curves form a monotonic Ei
sequence, falling below the zero power (open loop) curve with dimin-
ishing gain as power level increases. This, together with the absence
of any structure in the curves other than the circulation effect noted
above, is indicative of stable behavior and the absence of any signifi-
cant resonances in the system response. The good agreement between meas-
ured and theoretical curves is evidence of the reliability of the compu-

 

tational models employed.
Fuel-Cycle Economics 5
Typical fuel cycle costs, as estimated for the reference MSBR with i

our present chemical-processing flow sheet, are shown in Table 4.9.
These costs are 0.3 to 0.5 mills/kWh(e) higher than our earlier esti-
mates [13], a difference due primarily to revised estimates of the capital

cost of the chemical processing plant [14]. While other components of
the fuel cost have remained relatively stable, they are undoubtedly
subject to change, either as a result of changes in assumed unit costs
of materials or as a result of changes in reactor design. The possible
magnitudes of such changes are estimated here.

It should be noted that the fuel cycle costs shown in Table 4.9 are
not the lowest attainable, and do not necessarily correspond with the
lowest power cost. The reference MSBR was optimized on the basis of
breeding performance, using a "figure of merit" proportional to the
breeding gain divided by the square of the specific fuel inventory (G/I2).
Since the resulting fuel cycle costs were favorable as compared with
those projected for other reactors, no serious attempt has thus far been
made to reoptimize the reactor design and fuel cycle parameters solely on
the basis of power cost. It should be understood, therefore, that changes
in fuel cycle cost associated with changes in material costs or reactor
performance are likely to be compensated by adjustments in fuel cycle
parameters,

“Li

The cost of separated Li has been assumed to be $120/kg for lithium
containing 50 ppm 6Li, when produced in substantial quantities. Based on
this price, the ’Li contributes 0.057 mills/kWh(e) to the fuel cycle cost.
Thus, doubling the cost of "Li (without any compensating adjustments)
would add 0.057 mills/kWh(e) to the fuel cost. Doubling the nominal feed
rate (i.e., 6.7% of the Li inventory per year) would add about 0.02
mills/kWh(e) (but it should be noted that the nominal feed rate on which
the above makeup cost is based is already 50-1007 higher than we think
the actual feed rate is likely to be).

It should also be noted that the assumed lithium feed purity of
99.995% Li may be unnecessarily high. The associated neutron capture
rate in 611, taking into account burnout and replacement of éLi, is
0.0018 neutrons per ne source neutrons, compared with a capture rate
of 0.0161 in Li. (There is an additional capture rate of 0.0014 neutron
in the ®Li that is formed by (n,0) reactions in Be.) Doubling the 61,1
content in the lithium feed would thus decrease the breeding ratio, at
equilibrium, by about 0.002, which might be an acceptable alternative to
accepting changes in the price of lithium.

Thorium

At $6.50/1b of ThF,, thorium contributes 0.05 mills/kWh(e) to the
fuel cycle cost (of which slightly more than 0.002 mills/kWh(e) is ac-
tually for burnup). Any significant increase in the price of thorium
would be partly conpensated by a reduction in thorium concentrations in
the reactor. (In Ref. 5, it is shown that the breeding performance in
the reactor is quite insensitive to variations in thorium concentrations
around the value selected for the MSBR - i.e., 12 mole percent.)
90

Beryliium

The estimated cost of BeF, ($7.50/1b) contributes only about 0.01
mills/kWh(e) to the fuel cycle cost. Power costs are thus very insensi-
tive to the price of BeFs.

Uranium

Fuel cycle costs for the reference MSBR are influenced by the price
of fissile uranium primarily through the inventory charges, which are
0.36 mills/kWh(e), as compared with a fuel production credit of 0.09
mills/kWh(e) (for a breeding ratic of 1.07). Doubling the price of fis-
sile uranium, without compensating changes in the fuel cycle, would thus
add 0.27 mills/kWh(e). (Doubling the ore cost from $8 tc $16/1b Uj0g
would add 0.09 mills/kWh(e).) Some adjustments in fuel salt composition,
as well as in details of core design, would of course be possible. It
is not to be expected, however, that appreciable reductions in fissile
inventory would be possible without a major reduction in breeding gain.
While the trade-offs between specific inventory and breeding gain depend
on many details of reactor design, a rough approximation is that a 10%
reduction in inventory (without altering the design of the primary cir-
cuit external to the reactor core) would cost about 0.015 in breeding
ratio. Applied to the reference MSBR, this indicates that a saving of
0.036 in inventory charges would be partly offset by a reduction of
0.021 in the fuel production credit. Actually, the relation between
breeding ratio and specific inventory is highly non-linear: a major
decrease in inventory (e.g. 907% reduction) would be possible, at the
expense of reducing the conversion ratio nearly to zero; on the other
hand, a large percentage increase in inventory could gain at most a very
few percentage points in breeding ratio. Thus, the possible range for
adjustments is rather limited, whether breeding performance or fuel cost
alone is the guide.

Graphite

Replacement of the graphite core structure, as a consequence of ra-
diation damage, is estimated to contribute 0.17 mills/kWh{e) to the power
cost for the reference MSBR. A partial breakdown of this cost is shown
in Table 4.10. (Inclusion of this cost component with the fuel cycle cost
is of course arbitrary, but conventional, in keeping with the inclusion
of He or D,0 makeup costs for gas-cooled and heavy-water-moderated re-
actors.)

Graphite alone contributes about 0.12 mils/kWh(e) to the cost of
core replacement (at four-year intervals}. Much of the uncertainty in
graphite cost is associated with coating or impregnating the graphite to
reduce its permeability to xemon. In our cost estimates, this represents
about $5/1b of an average $11/1b cost of the graphite that is replaced.
The uncertainty in graphite coating costs is substantial - probably a

factor of 2. Adding $8/1b to the cost of the sealed graphite would in-
crease the cost of power by about 0.09 mills/kWh(e) (including capital-
ized first—core costs) for an average core-replacement interval of &
years, or 0.07 mills/kWh{e) for an average core life of 6 years.

On the other hand, even without development of improved graphites,
the core replacement interval can probably be lengthened by selective
replacement of individual graphite pieces, as proposed by Ebasco. The
dependence of graphite replacement cost on graphite price and on graphite
life is shown in Figure 4.5.

Evaluation

The reactor-physics technology required for the design of a molten-
salt breeder reactor appears to be pretty much in hand. We do not claim,
of course, that all substantial reactor physics questions have been
answered. A good deal of physics analysis would be required as part of
the engineering design of a particular reactor. Many interesting, impor-
tant questions concerning the optimization of molten salt reactors, in
response to a particular set of requirements, have not yet been studied.
There remains much room for Improvement in specific computer codes and
methods. But we do not believe that there remain any significant ques-
tions of technical or economic feasibility that rest on reactor physics
considerations.

Introduction

Studies of molten salt systems suitable for use in high-temperature
nuclear reactors, and examinations of the chemical problems inherent in
such use, have been under way for more than 20 years (see Chapter 2).
Many individual molten salt mixtures have been studied, but only two
classes of salts, chlorides and fluorides, have been given serious con-
sideration.

Molten chlorides were considered, especially for fast reactor fuels,
at a relatively early date [1, 2], but little experimental work with such
da systems appears to have been done until much later. A small experimental
effort at UKAEA, Harwell, devoted to molten chloride mixtures as fuels
for advanced fast reactors has been in progress since 1965 [3]. (The neu-
tron cross section of chlorine rules out its use in thermal reactors.)

Fluoride mixtures have been the subject of a chemical research pro-
gram at ORNL since 1949 [4]. These studies first developed NaF-ZrFy-UF,

mixtures, which fueled the Aircraft Reactor Experiment in 1954. Since
wa 1958 this program has been directed to molten fluoride mixtures suitable
for use in thermal breeder reactors. Several reviews of this chemical
effort have been published [5, 6, 7, 8]. In addition, our experience
Ee with the chemical aspects of the MSRE, which was fueled with a mixture
of LiF, BeF,, ZrF,, and UF,, has been reported in detail [9].

We attempt in this chapter to assess the strengths and weaknesses
of pertinent molten salts and of our knowledge of these materials for
use in a molten-salt breeder reactor. The choice of optimum salt mix-
tures, the present status of their technology, and our evaluation of
their suitability and of remaining problem areas are briefly presented
in separate sections for the fuel and the coolant mixtures. Behavior
of fission products in the fuel circuit, an important and complex matter
which is less well documented, is treated in some detail in a separate
Eo section of the chapter. Finally, we describe the methods for detailed

chemical analysis of fuel and coolant streams and their ancillary systems
and the problems remaining before an MSBR could be operated with confi-
dence.

Fuel Salts

Basis for Choice of Composition

A single-fluid MSBR [10] makes stringent demands upon its fluid fuel.
This fuel must have a low capture cross section for neutrons, and it must
dissolve more than the critical concentration of uranium or plutonium and

95

 
96

high concentrations of thorium at temperatures comfortably below the tem~
perature of the primary heat exchanger. The mixture must be thermally
stable, and its vapor pressure needs to be low over a temperature range
(600-750°C) sufficiently high to permit generation of high-quality steam.
The fuel mixture must possess heat transfer and hydrodynamic properties
adequate for its service as a heat-exchange fluid. It must be nonaggres-
sive toward some material of construction and toward some suitable moder- ws
ator material. The fuel must be stable toward reactor radiation, must be
able to survive fission of the uranium (or plutonium), and must tolerate
fission product accumulation without serious deterioration of its useful
properties. An additional demand is that the fuel be amenable to effec-
tive recovery of bred fissile material and to removal of fission product
poisons, as discussed in Chapter 11.

The requirement that the MSBR fuel consist, except for its fissile
and fertile material, entirely of nuclides of very low neutron capture
cross section restricts the choice of materials to compounds of beryllium,
bismuth, boron-11, carbon, deuterium, fluorine, lithium-7, nitrogen-15, ws
oxygen, and the fissile and fertile materials. Other nuclides can be tol-
erated only as minor constituents. Most of the compounds of the potential
"major constituents" are eliminated by the other fuel requirements. No
deuterium-bearing compounds are practical in such melts. Carbon, nitrogen,
boron, and oxygen form high-melting, and quite unsuitable, binary compounds
with the fissile and fertile metals. The oxygenated anions either lack the
required thermal stability (e.g., NO3™ or NO,™) or fail as solvents for
high concentrations of thorium compounds (e.g., C0427). It quickly de-
velops, therefore, that fluorides are the only suitable salts.

Uranium tetrafluoride (UF,) is the only fluoride of uranium that ws
appears useful as a constituent of molten fluoride fuels; UF, is rela-
tively stable, nonvolatile, and nearly nonhygroscopic. In the pure state
uranium trifluoride (UF3) disproportionates at temperatures above about
1000°C by the reaction

 

4LUF, = 3UF, + UC

In molten fluoride solution, disproportionation occurs at considerably
lower temperatures. Uranium trifluoride is, as is discussed in more de- u
tail below, tolerable in reactor fuels only in the presence of a large
excess of UF,. Thorium tetrafluoride (ThF,) is the only known fluoride
of thorium. Diluent fluorides are clearly necessary because of the very
high melting points of UF, and ThF, (1035°C and 1111°C respectively).
Nuclear properties alone favor as diluents the fluorides of Be, Bi, and
71,1 in that order. The stability of these fluorides [11] eliminates bis-
muth from consideration and leaves the fluorides of beryllium and lithium-7 a
as the preferred diluents. Fortunately the phase behavior (described in
detail below) of LiF-BeF,-UF, and LiF-BeF,-ThF, makes these materials use-
ful as fuels.

The breeder fuel salt requires a high concentration of ThF, (10 to
14 mole %) and somewhat less than 0.3 mole % 233UF,. Beryllium fluoride
is very viscous, but the viscosity of LiF-BeF; mixtures decreases rapidly
as the LiF/BeF, ratio increases above about 2. The LiF/BeF, ratio is Ei
et

97

i

therefore chosen to optimize the conflicting demands for low viscosity
and a low melting point, Lf the liquidus temperature is to be kept at or
below 500°C for a melt with 12 mole % of ThF,, the beryllium concentra-
tion limits range (as described below) from 16 to 25 mele %. The most
likely choice for the MSBR fuel — and the present design composition — is,

. accordingly, ’LiF-BeF,~ThFy~UF, at 71.7-16-12-0.3 mole %, respectively.

It should be noted that the objectives of the MSRE did not require
the fuel to contain ThF,. Accordingly, the fuel chosen for MSRE was a
mixture of ’LiF, BeF,, ZrF,, and UF, (65, 29.1, 5, and 0.9 mole 7%). The
ZrF, was added, as discussed below, to preclude inadvertent precipitation
of U0,.

Fuel selection is no great problem for the MSBR since, as will be
detailed below, the phase behavior of LiF and BeF, with UF, and ThF,
is entirely satisfactory. The requirement of very low cross section
requires, in principle, that the fuel mixture be free from extraneous
high-cross—section ions. Purity requirements dictated by oxide-flucride
equilibria and of compatibility — both of which are described in some
detail below — are rather more stringent than those posed by cross-section
congiderations.

Experience with Molten Salt Fuels

Industrial processes based on molten salts (e.g., production of alu-
minum by electrolysis of Al,03 in molten K3AlFg) have been used for many
years. However, when the ORNL program began in 1949, although the classic
papers of Temkin [12] and Flood and Forland [13] had been published, rela-
tively little was known about molten salt chemistry, and virtually nothing
was known about molten fluoride behavior. The situation has improved
markedly since that time, partly, though by no means entirely, because
of stimulation of the field by the Molten Salt Reactor Program.

The ARE program [5, 14], which was concerned with a different fuel
system (NaF-ZrF,-UF,) and a different metal (Inconel rather than Hastel-
loy N), produced little chemical information directly applicable to the
MSBR but yielded a great deal of valuable background experience and in-
formation. Preparation and handling techniques for molten fluorides
[6, 15], for example, were useful with only minor modifications for the
LiF-BeF,-based compositions. Techniques for rapid and effective study
of phase behavior and for determination of physical properties of molten
fluorides [16] were developed in these early days and subsequently ap-
plied to MSBR-related materials. Corrosion of metals, and especially of
nickel-based alloys, by fluorides was shown to be tolerable, the general
mechanisms by which corrosion occurred were recognized, and the importance
of extraneous impurities in the corrosion process was demonstrated [5].
Compatibility of many molten fluorides with graphite was demonstrated,
values for solubility of He, Kr, and Xe in molten fluorides [17] were
established, and the general stability of molten fluorides to radiation
and fission was demonstrated [5, 18].
98

The many chemical studies which immediately preceded operation of
MSRE were directed at LiF-BeFo-based fuels, and much was learned that
appears directly relevant to the MSBR system and that is described in
some detail in subsequent sections of this chapter.

Operation of the MSRE, with its fuel mixture of LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-UF,,
provided much chemical information that was reassuring [9]. Salt samples
removed routinely from the fuel and coolant circuits (one to three per
week from the fuel system) were analyzed for uranium, major fuel constit-
uents, possible corrosion products, and {less frequently) for oxide ion
contamination.

Analyses for uranium by coulometric titration [19] showed good re-
producibility and high precision (0.5%), but on-line reactivity balance
calculations were about 10-fold more sensitive than this in establishing
changes in uranium concentrations within the circuit. All the data sug-
gest strongly that the fuel was completely stable and that losses of
uranium, if any, were extremely small. Determination of uranium on or
in a graphite moderator bar led to the conclusion that the entire stack
contained less than 10 grams of uranium, a quite negligible amount [20].

Oxide concentration in the radioactive MSRE salt was determined by
careful evaluation of Hy;0 produced upon treatment of the salt samples
with anhydrous HF. All samples examined showed less than 100 ppm of 027;
no perceptible increase with time was apparent [21]. This is moderately
reassuring insofar as the practicality of maintaining oxide contamination
at very low levels in future reactor systems is concerned, though better
methods of analysis for oxides are clearly needed.

MSRE maintenance operations involved flushing the interior of the
fuel circuit with a ’LiF-BeF, (66.0-34.0 mole 7%) mixture. Analysis of
this salt before and after each use showed that an amount of uranium was
added to the flush salt in each flushing operation equivalent to 23 kg
of fuel-salt residue (about 0.5% of the charge} from the reactor circuit.
The magnitude and the reproducibility of this figure seem to confirm the
nonwetting characteristics of the clean fuel salt toward graphite and
metal.

The fission process is mildly oxidizing toward dissolved UT in the
fuel. In the MSRE a convenient means for restoring the U3t concentration
was tc suspend beryllium rods in a perforated capsule of nickel in the
salt in the pump bowl. This active metal reacted with UF,

Bel (c) + 2UF,(d) + BeF,(d) + 2UF3(d)

and converted some 500 grams of UT to Ut during an 8-hour treatment.
The salt near the Be appeared to be slightly overreduced, but the over~-
reduced salt mixture clearly reacted and achieved equilibrium with the
large excess of unreduced salt in the pump bowl and reactor circuit.
{In an MSBR, the on-line processing system would be used to maintain
the UF,/UF3 ratio at the desired level.)

Many fuel salt samples were analyzed at regular intervals for Fe, Ni,
and Cr due to corrosion processes [8, 9, 22, 21, 23]. All samples showed
relatively high values for iron (120 ppm) and nickel (50 ppm), with con-
siderable scatter and no perceptible trend. These values seem far too
99

+ high for "blanks" in the analytical procedures; it is apparent, for rea-
sons described below, that in many cases they do not represent dissolved
Fe?t and Ni2t. Molybdenum concentrations were shown, in the few attempts
a made, to be below the detectible limit (ca. 25 ppm) for chemical analy-
sis.

MSRE was operated for nearly three years with 235yuF,, as its fuel
and for a shorter period while fueled with 233UF,. Corrosion behavior
of the system during these two periods was generally similar, but some
quantitative differences seem to be real.

- During 13,500 hours of 23°UF, fuel circulation (including a number
of shutdowns) the chromium concentration in the fuel salt rose from an
initial value near 40 ppm to a final value of about 85 ppm. A consider-
able scatter in the numbers was apparent, but the increase with time and
with reactor operation was clearly real. All evidence suggests that the
analytically determined chromium was largely, if not entirely, present
as dissolved Cr2T, This observed increase in chromium concentration
= corresponded to removal of less than 250 grams of this element from the
MSRE circuit. If this were removed uniformly it would deplete the chro-
mium in the alloy to a depth of less than 0.2 mil.# Such an estimate of
corrosion seems consistent with observations of metal specimens (see
Chapter 7) showing very slight attack by the fuel during MSRE operation.
Insertion of the metallic Be rods in nickel cages (described above) into
the circulating fuel mixture should have resulted in reduction of Fe?t
“a or Ni%?t and plating of these materials on the reducing assembly if they
had been present. Neither of these was ever observed during the operation
with 2357, although in one case a deposit of pure cr? was observed [9].

During operation of MSRE with the 233yF, fuel, the rate of attack,
though still quite acceptable, was more rapid. During the 6590 hours of
operation with this fuel, the chromium content of the fuel rose from an
initial value near 35 ppm to a final value of about 100 ppm. Initial
rates of increase in Cr?t content were more rapid than was the case for
the 235yF, operation, and the salt clearly appeared to be more aggres-

sive. As described in reference 23a, the changeover from 23°U to 233U
E involved fluorination of the original fuel mixture to remove the uranium
as UFg, attempted reduction of the Fellas NiF,, and CrF, introduced during
this operation, and addition of the 23 UF. Insertion of Be rods during
early stages of the 233yp, operation produced appreciable deposits of
crystalline iron and nickel on the assemblies, clearly indicating that
the 233yF, fuel was less pure than was the original 235yF, preparation.
Whether this difference was due to ingress of air into the reactor system
at during the long shutdown for preparation of the 233UF, fuel or to incom-
plete reduction of impurities introduced during the fluorination is not
known. In any event, total corrosion during operation with both fuel
a mixtures was equivalent to uniform removal of chromium from 0.5 mil of
the reactor metal.

 

 

HH

BY: this 250 grams of CrZT were due entirely to admission of oxygen
to the system during shutdown of the reactor a total of some 80 grams of
se 0, would have been required. About 10 scf of air could have furnished
this 0,, and the 0°” concentration of the fuel would have risen about
15 ppm. This mechanism might possibly have accounted for much of the
corrosion.
100

Although operation of MSRE generally verified the behavior predicted
for the fuel salt, not all the news was good. Fission product behavior
(to be described subsequently) was even more complex than anticipated.
Our metheds for sampling the MSRE salt were restrictive, and some of
our methods for analysis needed marked improvement. Behavior of tritium
(see Chapter 14) portended a problem in large molten-salt reactors.
Finally, in spite of the excellent picture on generalized corrosion,
the grain boundary attack resulting in superficial cracking of the Has~
telloy N exposed to the fuel was a major and disappointing observation
(see Chapter 7).

Present Status of Fuel Chemistry

 

Phase Behavior among Fluorides. - Phase equilibria among the pertinent

 

MSBR fluorides have been studied in detail, and the equilibrium diagrams,
though relatively complex, are well understood.

The binary system LiF-BeF; has melting points below 500°C over the
concentration range from 31 to 68 mole % BeF, [24, 25, 26]. The phase
diagram, presented in Fig. 5.1, is characterized by a single congruently
melting compound, Z2LiF+BeF,, and a single eutectic between BeF,; and
2LiF-BeF,.

The BeF,~UF, [24,25] and BeF,-ThF, [27] systems are very similar
in phase behavior. Both systems show simple single eutectics containing
very small concentrations of the heavy metal fluoride. ThF, and UF, are
isostructural; their binary phase diagram shows a continuous series of
solid sclutions with neither maximum nor minimum.

The binary diagrams for LiF-UF, [28] and LiF-ThFy, [29] are relatively
similar. The LiF-UF, system shows three compounds (none are congruently
melting) and a single eutectic, at 27 mole 7 UF, melting at 490°C. The
LiF-ThF, system contains four binary compounds, one of which (3LiF:ThF,)
melts congruently, with two eutectics, at 570°C and 22 mole 7% ThF, and at
560°C and 29 mole % ThF,.

The ternary system LiF-ThF,-UF, [30], shown in Fig. 5.2, shows no
ternary compounds and a single eutectic freezing at 488°C with 1.5 mole 7
ThF, and 26.5 mole % UF,. Liquidus temperatures decrease generally to
the LiF-UF; edge of the diagram.

Because the MSBR fuel needs a concentration of ThFy, much higher than
that of UF,, its phase behavior is dictated by that of the LiF-BeF,-ThF,
system, Figure 5.3 gives the ternary system LiF-BeF;-ThF,; this system
shows a single ternary eutectic at 47 mole % LiF and 1.5 mole 7 ThF,,
melting at 360°C [24, 27]. The system is complicated by the fact that
the compound 3LiF+ThF, can incorporate Be?t ions in both interstitial and
substitutional sites to form sclid solutions whose compositional extremes
are represented by the shaded triangular region near that compound. In-
spection of the diagram reveals that a considerable range of compositions
with more than 10 mole % ThF, will be completely molten at or below 500°C.
The maximum ThF, concentration available at this liquidus temperature
is just above 14 mole %. As expected from the -general similarity of ThFy

and UF, — and especially from the substitutional behavior shown by the

LiF-UF,~ThF, system (Fig. 5.2) — substitution of a small quantity of UF,
for ThF, scarcely changes the phase behavior. Accordingly, and to a very
good approximation, Fig. 5.3 represents the behavior of LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,
mixtures in which the mole fraction of ThF, is much greater than that of
UF, .

Effect of Oxide. - Phase behavior of the pure fluoride system LiF-
BeF,-ThF,-UF,, as indicated shove, is such that a wide choice of adequate
fuel mixtures seems assured. The behavior of systems such as this, how-
ever, is markedly affected by appreciable concentrations of oxide ion,
which might be produced by inadvertent contamination of the fuel system.

When a melt containing only LiF, BeFs;, and UF, is treated with a
reactive oxide (such as Hp0), precipitation of UOp go results [8, 31].

If the melt contains, in addition, considerably more ZrFy than UF,
inadvertent oxide contamination yields monoclinic ZrO, containing about
250 ppm of UO, [32]. Precipitation of cubic UO, (containing a small
concentration of Zr0,) begins only after precipitation of ZrO, has dropped
the ZrF, concentration tec near that of the UF.

The effect of added oxide on the MSBR fuel mixture, with its con-
tained ThF,, UF,, PaF,, and perhaps PuFj, in addition to LiF and BeF;,
has been carefully examined in a series of recent studies [33,34,35,36,
37,38,39,40]. The findings of these studies are summarized in the
following:

The solubilities of the actinide dioxides in MSBR fuel salt are low,
and they decrease in the order ThO,, Pa0,, U0,, Puld,. The solubility
products

- 2
“Mo, = fu Xo2-
are presently estimated as follows:

log @ = -2.86 - 3,280/T (+0.3)

ThO,

log @p,q = 2.86 = 4,920/T (20.5)

log Gy, = =2.86 = 5,660/T. (20.5)

log @p,o = 2.86 = 7,100/T (20.8)

Since all these oxides have the same fluorite structure and nearly the
same lattice parameters, they can form solid solutions with one another.
105

As a result, if precipitation of such oxides occurs in an MSBR fuel, ex-
change equilibria of the type

M4 + Tho, (ss) = MO, (ss) + Th**

= involving an oxide solid solution phase are established. The correspond-
ing equilibrium quotients

are equal to the ratio of the solubility products & /Q

M0, #10, * Hence

log Gor = 1640/T (£0.2)
- log Go. = 2380/T (0.04)
log Gor = 3820/T (20.7)

In addition, Paj0g (or an addition compound of it) is very insoluble in
MSBR fuel:

log (Xp s+ x342) = 0.91 - 12,760/T (0.3)

Becduse of the low solubility of ThO, and U0,, a binary solid solution

5 rich in U0, (typically 95%) could be precipitated from an MSBR fuel if
sufficiently high oxide concentrations are reached. The oxide level re-
quired (the oxide tolerance) is indicated in Fig. 5.4. The amount of PaQ,

5 in the solid solution should be negligible; i.e., the Pa/U ratio in the

oxide should be ~1/7 the Pa/U ratio in the fuel.

The oxide concentration at which Pa,0g5 can be precipitated depends

on both the protactinium concentration and the oxidation state of the

fuel — as reflected by the U4t/U3* ratio. The situation is indicated by

log [£542 Xp ut (ygua/Xyae)] = 0.76 = 8590/7  (£0.8)

The result is that with 100 ppm Pa and 30 ppm oxide present, the git ust
ratio must be kept below about 10° if inadvertent precipitation of Pa,0g
is to be avoided. Such oxidizing conditions should be easy to aveid in
practice. There is also a dependence on the U"t/U3+ ratio of the oxide
concentration at which Pu, precipitation occurs, However, even stronger
oxidizing conditions (U"t/U3* > 108) are required to precipitate Puls,
from an MSBR fuel.

Selective precipitation of Pa as Pa,05, of U as U0, and possibly of
Pu as PuO; may be of value (see Chapter 11) in fuel reprocessing cycles.

It is clear that the MSBR fuel must be protected from oxide contami-
nation to aveid inadvertent precipitation. Because of the low oxide
tolerance (Fig. 5.4), this will require some care, but the successful
operation of the MSRE over a three-year period lends confidence that
oxide contamination of the fuel system can be kept to adequately low
levels. This confidence, when added to the prospect that the breeder
fuel will be reprocessed (and its oxide level reduced) on a continuous
basis, suggests very strongly that successful operation can be achieved.

Physical Properties. - Some pertinent physical properties of the
MSRE and MSBR fuel salts are listed in Table 5.1 [8,41]. Liquidus
temperatures are known with accuracy. Vapor pressures of the fuels
have been extrapolated from measurements on similar mixtures; values
are considerably less than 0.1 torr at 600°C.

Densities were calculated from the molar volumes of the pure compo-
nents by assuming the volumes tc be additive. Heat capacities were esti-
mated by assuming that each gram atom in the mixture contributes 8 cal/°C
(the approximate average from a set of similar fluoride melts). The vis-
cosity of the MSBR fuel was estimated from measurements on other LiF-BeF;
and NaF-~BeF, mixtures. Methods for such estimation are, in most cases,
quite reliable; densities and heat capacities are probably good to 137%,
but viscosity and thermal conductivity are probably no better than *15%.

Surface tensions of the molten fuels are known to be high, but this
moderately important property is not well established. Measurements with
several systems (but not with MSBR or MSRE fuels) by three different
methods suggest [41] that the equation

y = 260 - 0.12 T°C

approximates the surface tension of both fuels over the range 550 to
700°C. These values are, however, unlikely to be better than about *30%.
This property, which is of importance in assessing wetting behavior and
in establishing (for nonwetting cases) a degree of penetration of the
salt into porous bodies and the size of orifice or annulus into which

the salt will flow under prescribed pressures, clearly needs to be better
known.

Chemical Compatibility of MSBR Materials. - The excellent compati-
bility of Hastelloy N with fluoride salts containing LiF, BeF,, ThF,,
and UF,, shown in corrosion tests [42, 43, 44, 45] and in the MSRE, is
a result of the fact that these fluorides are thermodynamically stable
toward the Hastelloy N.* That is, the major fuel components (LiF, BeF,,
UFy, and ThF,) are much more stable than the structural metal fluorides
(NiF,, FeF,, and CrF;), and graphite does not react chemically with such
fluoride mixtures. This basic situation, combined with proper purifica-
tion procedures, provides liquids whose overall corrosivity is within
tolerable limits.

Experimentation over many years has defined the thermodynamic prop-
erties of many species in molten LiF-BeF, solutions [46]. Table 5.2 lists
pertinent data for the major components of MSRE and MSBR fuels and for
corrosion products in molten 2LiF-<BeF,.

The chemistry of the UFy-UF3 conversion [47] is significant since it
affords redox buffering to the fuel mixture. Operation with a small frac-
tion (perhaps 1%) of the uranium as UF3 is advantageous insofar as cor-
rosion reactions and the oxidizing effect of the fission process are
concerned. If we accept the data of Table 5.2 as applicable (as is ap-
proximately true) to the MSBR fuel and consider the reaction

LUF3(d) = 3UF,(d) + U

when UF, and UF; are dissolved in the MSBR fuel, we observe that at 900°K
(1160°F) the equilibrium constant (KX) for this reaction has the value

N indicates the mole fraction of the designated species, and a indicates
the thermodynamic activity. For the MSBR fuel, where Nyp, = 3 X 1073,
where Nyp, is held at 3 X 107°, then the equilibrium uranium activity is
near 2 X fo-17, Even if 5% of the dissolved uranium is UF3, the equilib-
rium activity of uranium is below 10-11%, Such operation with a small
fraction of the uranium as UF; should result in an extremely dilute (and
physically undetectable) alloy of uranium with the surface of the con-
tainer alloy. All evidence to date suggests that operation with rela-
tively little UF, is completely satisfactory. For the MSBR, where the
fuel returned to the reactor from the processing plant can have a con-
trolled concentration of UF3, this equilibrium can be of real service.

Hastelloy N used in MSRE was Ni with 17% Mo, 7% Cr, 5% Fe. Probable
composition of modified Hastelloy N for future reactors is Ni with about

It is also clear from Table 5.2 that, of the structural metal fluo-
rides shown, CrF, is the most stable. Accordingly, Cr should be selec~
tively attacked in alloys such as Hzstelloy N by any extraneous oxidants
in the system. Impurities in the melt should react

followed by reaction of the NiF, with Cr. Reactions such as these will
proceed essentially to completion at reactor temperatures; they can
lead to rapid initial corrosion but not to a sustained attack.

If the fuel is pure and the metal clean, UF, is the strongest oxidant
in the MSBR fuel system. The reaction

UF, (d) + 3 Cr(ss) = UF3(d) + & CrFy(d)

has, from the data of Table 5.2, at 900°K an equilibrium constant

If the MSBR fuel with Byr, = 3 Xx 1073 and with no Cr?" or UF; present
initially were permitted to equilibrate at 900°K with a Hastelloy N sur-
face with a, = 0.05, the equilibrium solution would contain slightly more
than 10 ppm 5f ort? and Nyp; = about 2.5 X 107°, In principle, therefore,
a mixture in which the UF; Sole fraction could be maintained at about

3 X 107° should corrode the metal very little. Indeed, it seems likely
that corrosion could be kept to quite tolerable limits in this way even

if alloys (such as Inconel) with considerably higher chromium concentra-
tions (and correspondingly higher values for Ae) were used.
112

The corrosion by UF, cannot, in principle, be completely eliminated,
since the UF,-Cr reaction has a small temperature coefficient. Conse-
quently, circulation of the salt through a temperature gradient tends to
remove Cr from the hottest surface and to enrich the coldest alloy in
this element. The rate of such a reaction is controlled by the rate at
which Cr can diffuse from the bulk alloy to the surface or (more likely)
the rate at which the Cr can diffuse from the surface into the alloy in
the colder region. Experience indicates that no real difficulty is to be
expected from this reaction.

Modified Hastelloy N will contain titanium, while that in MSRE did
not. Estimates [11] of their free energies of formation suggest that the
fluorides of titanium are slightly more stable than CrF,. Titanium
should, therefore, be expected to react appreciably with the UF,. Since
Ti diffuses less readily than does Cr, however, it would not appear that
such corrosion would be particularly deleterious.

Graphite does not react with, and is not wetted by, molten fluoride
mixtures of the type to be used in the MSBR. Available thermodynamic data
[11] suggest that the most likely reaction:

"4UF,(d) + C(c) = CF,(g) + 4UF3(d)

should come to equilibrium at CF, pressures below 107% atm. This consid-
eration, taken with the wealth of favorable experience, suggests that no
problems are likely from this source.

It should be noted that at least one source [48] lists chromium
carbide {Cr3C,) as stable at MSBR temperatures. If so, it should be
possible to transfer chromium, at the rate it could diffuse from the
bulk alloy to react with the salt, to the graphite. No evidence of
such behavior has been observed with Hastelloy N in MSRE or other experi-
mental assemblies. Although it may be possible with alloys of higher
chromium content, it should not prove greatly deleterious, since its
rate would be controlled by the rates at which chromium could diffuse
to the alloy surface and should be limited by a film of Cr3C, formed on
the graphite.

It must be emphasized that none of the sbove throws any light upon
the special grain boundary attack upon Hastelloy N in the MSRE fuel cir-
cuit. It is conceivable that some heretofore untested combination of
oxidizing regime, radiation, and fuel interaction was responsible, but it
seems much more probable that some fission product (likely tellurium) was
responsible. This matter is discussed in detail in Chapter 7.

Interaction of MSBR Fuel with Extraneous Materials. - The complex
mixture comprising the MSBR fuel reacts readily, though not violently or
even energetically, with water vapor to produce oxides of the actinide
elements and HF vapor. (In fact, water vapor is a possible reagent in a
selective precipitation scheme for fuel processing described in Chap. 11.)
Rapid addition would certainly produce a mixture of oxide products whose
equilibration would be relatively slow. This admixture of water and fuel
‘salt would lead to appreciable corrosion due to the HF so produced, but
would hardly prove catastrophic.

 

 

 

 

 

 
113

None of the MSBR fuel constituents can release F, upon reaction with
oxygen (or nitrogen). Reactions such as

2UFy + 0, = UO,F, + UFg

E: have been postulated [49], but such reactions seem most unlikely in dilute
solution in MSBR fuel. No reaction of LiF, BeF,, or ThFy, with 0, is pos-
sible. An inleakage of air into the MSBR fuel circuit cannot, therefore,

is cause energetic or violent reactions. However, since the MSBR metal sur-
faces will be oxide-free (because of the fluxing action of the fluorides),
rapid reaction of the air with the metal circuit will occur. Such reac-
tions as

2Ni(e) + 05(g) > 2NiO(s) ,

for example, will immediately result in

_ 2NiO(c) + UF, (d) » U0, (c) + 2NiF, (4d)
and rapid corrosion. It will, accordingly, be necessary to minimize in-
gress of air both during operation and during maintenance. This is of
He especial importance because, as indicated earlier, the oxide tolerance
of the MSBR fuel is low (not much above 30 ppm of 027).
The consequences of mixing MSBR fuel with the secondary coolant, as
sa would occur as a result of a leak in the primary heat exchanger, are dis-
cussed under Coolant Chemistry in a subsequent section of this chapter.

Purity Requirements. ~ The initial purification procedures for the
salt charge for a molten-salt reactor do not present formidable problems.
Nuclear poisons such as boron, cadmium, rare earths, etc., are not common
contaminants of the constituent materials. Enriched uranium tetrafluo-
ride commonly contains small quantities of UQ,, UFs, and UQ,F,. ThF, and
BeF, contain appreciable quantities of oxides and oxyfluorides, up to
i 0.1% C1~, and Fe®t to the extent of perhaps 100 ppm. All these compounds
contain some water, and all are readily hydrolyzed to oxides and oxyfluo-
rides at elevated temperatures. LiF and BeF,; generally contain a small
quantity of sulfur (primarily as sulfate).

Purification processes [13, 6, 50] which were used to prepare ma-
terial for the ARE, the MSRE, and for many laboratory and engineering
tests have treated the mixed materials at high temperature in equipment
i of Ni (usually 800°C) with gaseous HF-H, mixtures and then with pure Hj.
The HF-H, treatment serves to reduce the USt and US+ to UYt, to reduce
sulfate to sulfide and remove it as HyS, to remove Cl~ as HCl, and to
convert the oxides and oxyfluorides to fluorides. Final treatment with
H, serves to reduce FeF3 and FeF, to insoluble Fe and to remove NiF,
which may have been produced during hydrofluorination. All preparations
to date have been performed in batch equipment, but continuous equipment
is under development [51,52]. For MSRE [50] the fuel solvent was prepared

 

 

 
114

in large (ca. 300 1b} batches, while the enriched uranium fluoride was
purified separately (as the LiF-UF, eutectic). It seems likely that a
generally similar procedure would be desirable for MSER.

The most difficult specification for MSBR will probably be that for
very low oxide concentration. Experience with the process for high ThF,
concentrations is limited. However, all the preparations to date and
many laboratory-scale researches have successfully dropped the 02~ con-
centration below that required to precipitate UQ5-ThO,. Should this
prove very difficult on a large scale, it would be possible to process
the LiF-BeF,~ThFy melt with fluorine; it seems possible that the reproc-
essing fluorination (see Chap. 11) might be used if necessary as the
final polishing step in this treatment.

Radiation Stability. ~- An early concern was the possibility that
radiation (including recoiling fission fragments) from the fission pro-
cess might lead to radiolytic instability of the molten fluoride. Re-
combination in molten salt of "dissociated" species ({.e., a fluorine
atom and an electron) should be very rapid. Nevertheless, it seemed
(and still seems) likely that there exists a power level sufficient to
damage a molten fluoride by dissociation into metal and fluorine.

Many irradiation tests were conducted prior to 1959 with NaF-
Zr¥,-UF, mixtures in Inconel at temperatures at or above 1500°F [6,7]
and quite high fission power densities, from 80 to 1000 watts/cm® of
fuel. No instability of the fuel system was apparent, and the corrosion
did not exceed the considerable amount expected from laboratory-scale
tests.

The ARE tests had not included graphite, and several irradiation
tests were performed in the early days of the MSBR program [53,54,55,

56] primarily to test wetting of graphite under irradiation. These tests
used mixtures of LiF, BeF,, and ZrF; with 1 mole Z ThF, and 1.5 mole %
UF, in sealed Hastelloy N capsules, irradiated at power levels above 200
watts/cm? fuel to burnups as high as 8% of the 233U. Examination of
these capsules after storage at ambient temperatures for many weeks re-
vealed appreciable quantities of CF, and, in most cases, considerable
quantities of fluorine in the cover gas [57,58]. Careful examination
strongly suggested that the F, generation had not occurred at the high
temperature, but by radiolysis of the mixture in the solid state.

This suggestion was confirmed by irradiation in MIR of two arrays of
Hastelloy N capsules, all containing graphite and LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-UF, mix-
tures. Two of the capsules in each array had gas inlet and exit lines
to permit sampling of the cover gas as desired. Gas samples drawn from
the test capsules at operating temperatures and at various power levels
up to 80 watts/cm® showed no F, (though an occasional sample from the
first array showed detectable traces of CF,). During reactor shutdowns,
however, with the capsules at about 35°C, pressure rises were observed
(usually after an induction period of a few hours), and F, was evolved.
In the second array the capsules were kept hot during reactor shutdown as
well as during operation; no evidence of F, or CF, was observed. Such F,
generation at ambient temperatures was subsequently followed for several
months in ORNL hot cells. The generation diminished with time in a manner
115

corresponding closely with decay of fission product activity; F, evolution

at 35°C corresponded to about 0.02 molecule per 100 ev absorbed, could be

completely stopped by heating to 100°C or above, and could be markedly

reduced by chilling to -70°C. The F, evolution resumed, usually after a

few hours, when temperature was returned to 35-50°C.

: These and subsequent experiences, including operation of MSRE,

Li strongly indicate that radiolysis of the molten fuel at reasonable power
densities is not a problem. Radiolytic fluorine must be dealt with, how-
ever, if irradiated fuel mixture is chilled below about 100°C.

Evaluation and Summary of Needed Work ,

= In general, most of the chemical behavior of the MSBR fuel rests on
a solid background of data and information. Some areas described in this
chapter require additional effort, but it appears unlikely that these

i areas of uncertainty threaten feasibility of the MSBR concept.

The phase behavior of MSBR materials has been studied in detail, and
little remains to be done if LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, mixtures are used. Should
the fuel composition be changed appreciably from the 71.7-16-12-0.3 mole %
now adopted, it would be necessary to do some confirmatory testing in the
immediate vicinity of the new design compositions. Should PuF3 be adopted

as the fissionable component, a program of phase equilibrium study would
= be required.*®

Oxide limitations of the fuel are clearly important. The oxide-

fluoride behavior seems to be reasonably straightforward and well under-
a stoed. It is, however, very difficult experimentally, and some of the
data have been obtained in systems containing only one or two of the
actinide elements. It seems certain that additional, and confirmatory,
experiments with the total system should be conducted.

As indicated above, several of the physical and heat transfer prop-
erties have been estimated from measurements on molten salts of other

compositions. Although the estimates are adequate for the present, an
ww ongoing reactor program should provide for measurement of these prop-
erties.
Thermodynamic data have been defined with accuracy for many solute
Ee species in molten 2LiF<BeF,, and considerable experimental study suggests
that the data in LiF-BeF,-ThF, mixtures will be similar. They will not,
however, be identical, and methods for estimating them from the existing
system are uncertain. It seems necessary, therefore, to do experimental
determinations of the free energies of formation of important and typical
materials in the more complex MSBR fuel mixture.
Compatibility of the MSBR fuel (in absence of fission products) with
E Hastelloy N and with graphite seems well assured. However, the thermo-
dynamic data do not quantitatively predict the magnitude of attack in m 1y

116

cases. A plausible mechanism has existed for years to explain the minor
corrosion observed, but it is still possible that extraneous oxidants are
partly responsible for the observations. Some especially careful tests
of these points would be welcome — and newer on-line analytical methods
seem to make these tests possible. Such testing will become especially
valuable if alloys other than Hastelloy N must be considered for MSER.

While the equilibrium behavior of MSBR fuel with contaminants such
as steam, air, HF, and Hy, is well understood, little is known about the
rates of some of these reactions. Studies of the really pertinent ones
should be initiated.

It is still necessary to demonstrate that large-scale initial puri-
fication of the MSBR fuel solvent can drop the 0%” concentration to the
desired value, well below 30 ppm. While other facets of the purification
scheme also lack demonstration, nc other specification would appear to be
troublesome.

Radiation stability of the MSBR fuel at elevated temperatures would
not appear to pose problems. The 72-16-12 mole % composition of LiF,
BeF;, and ThF, has sclid compounds quite different from the mixes tested,
and there is reason to suspect that F; generation may be less of a prob-
lem (perhaps negligible) at ambient temperature. This point, to which
a favorable answer might simplify some storage and handling problems,
should be checked.

It should be emphasized that not all MSBR chemistry is well under-
stood. Special problem areas that are chemical in nature, though covered
elsewhere in this document, are concerned with (1) retention and control
of tritium, (2) with the special grain boundary corrosion and cracking
in Hastelloy N, and (3) with behavior of fission products. Considerable
chemical development will probably be required to define and to solve
these problems.

Fission Product Behavior

General

Circulating liquid fuel simplifies fuel recycle by making possible
in situ processing, as required to increase breeding gain. However, this
characteristic also means that fission products are spread through all
parts of the fuel circulating system and peripheral systems such as off~
gas, drain tanks, etc. This substantially affects the reactor operation
and performance as regards breeding, materials behavior, afterheat, and
maintenance. Thus a thorough understanding of the fates of the fission
products in MSBR'’s is important to their development.

As operation of the MSRE and concurrent investigations emphasized
the importance of the fission products, investigations of their fates in
the MSRE were pursued in a variety of ways. Arrays of graphite and metal
specimens were examined after exposure in the core for periods of several
thousand hours. Samples of fuel salt were dipped from the agitated pool
in the pump bowl or were pulled from beneath the surface of the same pool
into evacuated capsules with fusible seals. The gas above the salt in
Sh

117

the pump bowl was also sampled with evacuated capsules. Metal and graph-
ite were exposed to the gas or salt in the pump bowl for perieds of up to
a few hours to measure deposition of fission products. The cover gas
flowing out of the fuel-pump bowl was sampled (some distance downstream)
and fission-product concentrations and isotopic ratios measured. Effects
of neutron absorption by the fission products (notably xenon-135 but also
others) could be discerned in precise measurements of reactivity. A re-
mote gamma-ray spectrometer aimed at the various components determined
the fission products there both during operation and with the fuel drained.
Finally, some data were obtained from samples from the mist shield and
sampler cage from the fuel pump bowl, from shell and tube specimens from
the heat exchanger, from a graphite core stringer, and from a control rod
thimble, obtained during the post-operation examination one year after
shutdown.

Major Groups and Yields

 

The fission products fall into several groups according to their
chemical behavicr in molten fluorides. These groups, in order of their
importance as neutron poisons, are: noble gases, rare-earth stzble
salt-seeking fluorides, noble metals,* and other stable salt-seeking
fluorides. Table 5.3 shows some of the significant fission product
poisons which will reduce breeding gain if they build up in an MSBR.

The investigations usually involved other isotopes of the same or
chemically similar elements which had appropriate yields and half-lives.

Free energies of formation (AG, kcal) for various fluorides of in-
terest are given in Table 5.4. Since the UF,/UF;3 ratic is generally held
at Vvi100 to inhibit corrosion — i.e., leaching of chromium from the Hastel-
loy N [59] — one would expect the fluorides which appear above CrF,; in
the table to be stable in the fuel salt, whereas those below would be
reduced. Thus, the rare and alkaline earths, cesium, and zirconium should
appear as stable fluorides in the salt melt; and the noble metals (Nb, Mo,
Ru, Sb, Te, Tc) should appear in a reduced — probably metal — form. The
noble gases do not form any chemical compounds under molten salt reactor
conditions. The effect of UF,/UF3 ratio on several species of particular
interest is shown in Figs. 5.5 and 5.6. Note that iodine would be ex-
pected to be present as iodide under the redox conditions projected.

As indicated above, operation of the MSRE provided an opportunity
for studying the behavior of fission products in an operating molten salt
reactor, and every effort was made to maximize utilization of the facil-
ities provided, even though they were not originally designed for some
of the investigations which became of interest. Significant difficulties
stemmed from:

1. The salt spray system in the pump bowl could not be turned off. Thus
the generation of bubbles and salt mist was ever-present; moreover,
the effects were not constant, since they were affected by salt level,
which varied continuously.

*

Referred to as noble because they are thermodynamically more stable
to oxidation than the chromium in Hastelloy N with the redox conditions
generally maintained in molten fluoride fuels.

2. The design of the sampler system severely limited the geometry of the
sampling devices.

3. A mist shield enclosing the sampling point provided a special enviren-
ment.

4. Lubricating oil from the pump bearings entered the pump bowl at a rate
of 1 to 3 cc/day.

5. There was continuously varying flow and blowback of fuel salt between
the pump bowl and an overflow tank.

In spite of these problems, useful information concerning fission
product fates in MSRE was gained.

Stable Salt-Soluble Fluorides

 

Salt Samples. - The fission products Rb, Cs, Sr, Ba, the lanthanides
and Y, and Zr all form stable fluorides which are soluble in fuel salt.
These fluorides would thereby be expected to be found completely in the
fuel salt except in those cases where there is a noble gas precursor of
sufficiently long half-life to be appreciably stripped to off-gas. Table
5.5 summarizes data from salt samples obtained during the 233y operation
of the MSRE for fission products with and without significant ncble gas
precursors. As expected, the isotopes with significant noble gas pre-
cursors (89Sr and 37¢g) show ratios to calculated inventory appreciably
lower than those without, which generally scatter around or somewhat
above 1.0.

Deposition. — Stable fluorides showed little tendency to deposit on
Hastelloy N or graphite [60]. Examinations of surveillance specimens
exposed in the core of the MSRE showed only 0.1 to 0.2% of the isotopes
without noble gas precursors on graphite and Hastelloy N. The bulk of
the amount present stemmed from fission recoils, based on an estimate
by Compere [61] and general consistency with the flux pattern [60].

The penetration of several fission products into the relatively
porous MSRE graphite is shown in Fig. 5.7. Note the flat profile for
137¢s (precursor: 137%e, Ty/2 = 3.9 min} in contrast to the 35zr and
144ce, which do not have noble gas precursors. Similar data were ob-
tained for 89sr (precursor: &%Kr, Ty/2 = 3.2 min) and 140pa [60] (pre-
cursor: 1%0%e, Ti/2 = 16 sec), although in those cases the concentration
falls off more with depth in the graphite. The dip in 137¢s concentra-
tion at the free-flowing salt surface (left side of Fig. 5.7) was estab-
lished as real in this and other examinations {62}, and similar dips
were noted in examining the graphite core stringer removed from the MSRE.
Compere and Kirslis [63] attributed these dips to significant diffusion
of cesium atoms in the graphite; such diffusion would also explain the
very flat 137Cs profile shown in the figure. The mobility of thleg

(T'y/o = 25 sec; precursor: 14lxe, Ti/2 = 2 sec) may account for the
deeper graphite penetration by 1%*lCe than !““Ce shown in Fig. 5.7.
Some observations indicate similar mobility for 89Sr [62].

Gas Samples. — Gas samples obtained from the gas space in the pump
bowl mist shield were consistent with the above results for the salt-
seeking isotopes with and without noble gas precursors. Table 5.6 [64]
shows the percentages of these isotopes which were estimated to be in the
pump bowl stripping gas, based on the amounts found in gas samples.
Agreement with expected amounts where there were strippable noble gas
precursors is satisfactory in consideration of the mist shield, contami-
nation problems, and other experimental difficulties. Gamma spectrometer
examination of the off-gas line showed little activity due to salt-seeking
isotopes without noble gas precursors [68]. Examinations of sections of
the off-gas line also showed only small amounts of these isotopes present

[691].

Noble Metals

The so-called noble metals showed a tantalizingly ubiquitous behavior
in the MSRE, appearing as salt-borne, gas-borne, and metal- and graphite-
penetrating species. Studies of these species included isotopes of Nb,
Mo, Tc, Ru, Ag, Sb, and Te.

Salt-Borne. - As shown in Fig. 5.8, the concentrations of five of
the noble metal nuclides found in salt samples ranged from fractions to
tens of percent of inventory, with only one 99% value appreciably above
100%. Also, the proportionate composition of these isotopes remains rel-
atively constant from sample to sample in spite of the widely varying
amounts found. I1llAg, which clearly would be a metal in the MSRE salt
and has noc volatile fluorides, followed the Fig. 5.8 pattern quite well
and also was consistent in the gas samples — see Table 5.7 below. This
strongly supports the contention that we were dealing with metal species.

These results suggest the following about the noble metals in the
MSRE.

1. The bulk of the noble metals remain accessible in the circulating
loop, but with widely varying amounts in circulation at any par-
ticular time.

2. In spite of this wide variation in the total amount found in a par-
ticular sample, the proportional composition is relatively constant,
indicating that the entire inventory is in substantial equilibrium
with the new material being produced.

3. The mobility of the pool of noble metal material suggests that de-
posits occur as an accumulation of finely divided, well-mixed
material rather than as a "plate."

No satisfactory correlation of noble metal concentration in the salt
samples and any operating parameter could be found.

In order to obtain further understanding of this particulate pool,
the transport paths and lags of noble metal fission products in the MSRE
were examined using all available data on the activity ratio of two iso=~
topes of the same element, 39.6~day 103Ru and 367-day 10fRu. Data from
graphite and metal surveillance specimens exposed for various periods and
removed at various times, for material taken from the off-gas system, and
for salt and gas samples and other materials exposed to pump bowl salt
were compared with appropriate inventory ratios and with values calculated
for indicated lags in a simple compartment model. This model assumed that
salt rapidly lost ruthenium fission product formed in it, some to surfaces
and most to a separate mobile "pool" of noble metal fission product, pre-
sumably particulate or colloidal and located to an appreciable extent in
pump bowl regions. Some of this "pool" material deposited on surfaces and
also appears to be the source of the off-gas deposits. All materials
sampled from or exposed in the pump bowl appear to receive their ruthenium
activity from the pool of retained material. Adequate agreement of ob-
served data with indications of the model resulted when holdup periods of
45~9C days were assumed [70].

Niobium. - As shown in Fig. 5.6, Nb is the most susceptible of the
noble metals to oxidation should the ght gst ratio be allowed to get too
high. Apparently this happened at the start of the 233U operation, as
was indicated by a relatively sharp rise in crt2 concentration; it was
also noted that 60 to “100% of the calculated 7°Nb inventory was present
in the salt samples. Additions of reducing agent (Be) which inhibited
the Crt? buildup also resulted in the disappearance of the 2°Nb from the
salt [71]. Subsequently the %°Nb reappeared in the salt several times
for not always ascertainable reasons and was caused to leave the salt by
further reducing additions. As the 233y cperations continued, the per-
centage of 25Nb which reappeared decreased, suggesting both reversible
and irreversible sinks. The 9°Nb data did not correlate with the Mo-Ru-
Te data shown in Fig. 5.8, nor was there any observable correlation of
its behavior with amounts found in gas samples.

Gas—Borne. - Gas samples taken from the pump bowl during the 235y

operation [8] indicated concentrations of noble metals that implied that
substantial percentages (30-100) of the noble metals being produced in
the MSRE fuel system were being carried out in the 4 liters (STP)/min He
purge gas. The data obtained in the 233g operation with substantially
improved sampling techniques [72] indicated much lower transfers to off-
gas, as shown in Table 5.7. In both cases it is assumed that the noble-
metal concentration in a gas sample obtained inside the mist shield was
the same as that in the gas leaving the pump bowl proper. (The pump
bowl was designed to minimize the amount of mist in the sampling area
and also at the gas exit port.) It is our belief that the 233U period
data are representative and that the concentrations indicated by the

gas samples taken during 23°U operation are ancmalously high because
130

of contamination. This is supported by direct examination of a section
of the off-gas line after completion of the 23%U operation [73]. The
large amounts of noble metals that would be expected on the basis of the
gas sample indications were not present. Appreciable (10-17%) amorphous
carbon was found in dust samples recovered from the line, and the amounts
of noble metals roughly correlated with the amounts of carbon. This sug-
gests the possibility of noble metal absorption during cracking of the
oil.

Deposition on Graphite and Hastelloy N. - In considering the results
from the core surveillance specimens it was assumed, for lack of other
information, that the amounts of the various fission products per unit
area found on the specimens were representative of all the graphite and
Hastelloy N surfaces. It was, of course, recognized that this assumption
was tenuous at best, and the examination of post-operation specimens from
the MSRE showed that it was not a very close approximation. Table 5.8
shows fission product distributions calculated in this way for several
sets of surveillance specimens and for parts of the components removed
in the post-operation examination. The calculated distributions vary
widely for different areas both in the circulating system and on the
Same component o

The final surveillance specimen array, exposed for the last four
months of MSRE operation, had graphite and metal specimens matched as to
configuration in varied flow conditions [76]. The relative deposition
intensities (1.0 if the entire inventory was spread evenly over all sur-
faces) were as shown in Table 5.9.

The examination of some segments excised from particular reactor
components, including core metal and graphite, pump bowl, and heat ex-
changer surfaces, one year after shutdown alsc revealed appreciable ac-
cumulation of these substances. The relative deposition intensities at
these locations are also shown in Table 5.9.

It is evident that net deposition generally was more intense on
metal than on graphite, and for metal, was more intense under more turbu-
lent flow. Surface roughness had no apparent effect.

Extension to all the metal and graphite areas cof the system weuld
require knowledge of the effects of flow conditions in each region, and
the fraction of total area represented by the region. (Overall, metal
area was 267% of the total, and graphite 74%.)

A theoretical approach [76a] treating the noble metal transport as
an ordinary convective turbulent diffusion process including gas inter-
faces as imperfect sinks shows some qualitative agreement with the ob-
served deposition behavior.

Flow effects have not been studied experimentally; theoretical ap-
proaches based on atom mass transfer through salt boundary layers, though
a useful frame of reference, do not in their usual form take into account
the deposition and release of fine particulate material such as was indi-
cated to have been present in the fuel system. Thus, much more must be
learned gbout the fates of noble metals in molten salt reactors before
their effects on various operations can be estimated reliably.

Although the noble metals are appreciably deposited on graphite,
they do not penetrate any more than the salt-seeking fluorides without
noble gas precursors, as shown by the 103py data in Fig. 5.7. Delete-
rious penetration of Hastelloy N grain boundaries is discussed in Chapter
7.

Iodine

The salt samples indicated considerable 13117 was not present in the
fuel, the middle quartiles of results ranging from 45 to 71% of inven-
tory with a median of 62%. The surveillance specimens and gas samples
accounted for less than 17 of the rest. The low Te material balances
suggest the remaining 1311 yas permanently removed from the fuel as 1317e
(T1/2 = 25 min). Gamma spectrometer studies indicated the 1317 formed in
contact with the fuel returned to it; thus the losses must have been to
a region or regions not in contact with fuel. This strongly suggests
off-gas, but the iodine and tellurium data from gas samples and examina-
tions of off-gas components do not support such a loss path. Such loss
would not appear to interfere with the use of iodine side-stream strip-
ping utilizing the reaction

HF (g in He) + 13517 > F~ + H1351(g)

This has been considered [77] as an alternate for removal of the important
135%e (daughter) poison from the fuel.

Evaluation

The experience with the MSRE showed that the noble gases and stable
fluorides behaved as expected based on their chemistry. The noble metal
behaviors and fates, however, are still a matter of conjecture. Except
for Nb under unusually oxidizing conditions, it seems clear these elements
are present as metals and that their ubiquitous properties stem from that
fact since metals are not wetted by, and have extremely low solubilities
in, MSR fuels. Unfortunately the MSRE observations probably were substan~-
tially affected by the spray system, oil cracking products, and flow to
and from the overflow, all of which were continuously changing, uncon-
trolled variables. The low material balance on !3!I indicates appreci-
able undetermined loss from the MSRE, probably as a noble metal precursor
(Te, Sb). .

Table 5.10 shows the estimated distribution of the various fission
products in a molten salt reactor based on the MSRE studies. Unfortu-
nately the wide variance and poor material balances for the noble metal
data make it unrealistic to specify their fates more than qualitatively.
As a consequence, future reactor designs must allow for enccuntering ap-
preciasble fractions of the noble metals in all regions contacted by cir-
culating fuel. As indicated in the table, continuous chemical processing
and the processes finally chosen will substantially affect the fates of
many of the fission products.

Future Work

Substantial difficult work will be needed to bring our understanding
of the behavior of noble metal fission products (including iodine) to the
level of the other fission products. This work will require simultaneous
control of chemical and hydrocdynamic conditions and will consequently re-
quire experiments of sufficient scale and some complexity to achieve this.
The major objective will be tc determine the controlling mechanisms as
well as the associated rates, in order that extrapclation to larger and
more complex systems can follow.

Among factors doubtless important in MSRE and in future reactors are
the redox potential of the system (characterized by the UYT/U3% ratio),
the presence of oxide and its affinity for various fission product (e.g.
Nb) and constituent elements, the possible agglomeration of metals onto
gas and bubble interfaces in the absence of colloidal (metallic, graphite,
oxide, etc.) particles, the deposition of noble metals onto colloidal
particles of various types, and the deposition and resuspension of par-
ticles bearing noble metals.

The exploitation of suitable mechanisms to remove ncble metal fission
products or to control their deposition could be an attractive result of
such studies.

Laboratory work in dynamic systems could use tracers for some work.
A next phase of the work is expected to generate such tracers under dy-
namic conditions in fuel or other salt using high-intensity neutron
pulses, possibly from the Oak Ridge Health Physics Research Reactor.
Broad variation of relevant chemical and hydrodynamic factors appears
possible.

Of necessity, tracer concentrations will be relatively low. How-
ever, experiments involving particulate participation in noble metal
behavior appear to be practical except where high concentrations are
required. In order to achieve these concentrations along with radiation
conditions approaching those of proposed reactors, while maintaining
chemical and hydrodynamic control, sophisticated in-pile loop experi-
mentation is reyuired, a major objective being to specify definitive
studies to be carried out in the demonstration reactor.

Coolant Salts

Basis for Choice of Composition

 

It has never appeared feasible to raise steam directly from the fuel
(primary) heat exchanger; accordingly, a secondary coolant must be pro-
vided to link the fuel circuit to the steam generator. The demands im-
posed upon this coolant fluid differ in obvious ways from those imposed
upon the fuel system. Radiation intensities will be markedly less in the
coolant system, and the consequences of uranium fission will be absent.
The coolant salt must, however, be compatible with metals of construction
which will handle the fuel and the steam; it must not undergo violent
reactions with fuel or steam should leaks develop in either circuit.
136

The coolant should be inexpensive, it must possess good heat transfer
properties, and it must melt at temperatures suitable for steam cycle
startup. An ideal coolant would consist of compounds which are tolerable
in the fuel or which are easy to separate from the valuable fuel mixture
should the fluids mix as a consequence of a leak.

MSRE rejected its heat to an air-cooled radiator at a minimum tem-
perature of about 1015°F [78]. The coolant mixture chosen [8,78] for
that application was BeF, with 66 mole % of ‘LiF (see Fig. 5.1). This
material, which melts at 851°F, was shown to be completely satisfactory
for that use [8,9]. An MSBR coolant, however, must transport heat to
supercritical steam at minimum temperatures only modestly above 700°F
[10]. Use of the high-melting MSRE coolant in MSBR would pose real
problems in steam generator design. The eutectic mixture of LiF and
BeF, (Fig. 5.1) melts at near 700°F, but its viscosity is high. More-
over, both these LiF-BeF, mixtures are quite expensive if ’LiF is used.
If normal Li¥ is used the cost is much less, though it is not trivial,
but a leak in the primary heat exchanger greatly damages the expensive
fuel. Such mixtures have, accordingly, been discounted as MSBR coolants.

The alkali metals, excellent coolants with real promise in other
systems, are quite undesirable here since they react vigorously with both
the MSBR fuel and with steam. More noble metals such as Bi or Pb undergo
no violent reactions with either of the other working fluids, but they
are only fair coolants, and they are not compatible with the nickel-based
alloys intended for use in MSBRs.

Molten mixtures of NaNO3, KNO3, and KNO, have been used industrially
(Hitec is a common example) as heat transfer agents, but not at tempera-
tures quite so high as are desirable in the MSBR. These materials may
be stable toward irradiation in the primary heat exchanger, but extensive
investigation of this point would be required [79]. They are clearly
not stable toward the fuel, from which they would precipitate actinide
oxides rapidly but not violently, and they would react dangerously with
the moderator graphite if a leak occurred in the primary heat exchanger.
Thus they are not being considered for use in the MSBR secondary system.
It should be noted, however, that these nitrate-nitrite mixtures have
excellent melting points, are quite compatible with water and steam,
and should certainly oxidize to T,;0 any tritium diffusing from the reactor
fuel system. They may, if the tritium problem (see Chapter 14) cannot
otherwise be satisfactorily managed, prove valuable in a third coolant
loop, as mentioned in Chapter 2.

Several binary chloride systems are known to have eutectics melting
well below 700°F [80]. Many of these systems are unattractive since they
contain high concentrations of chlorides which are easily reduced and,
therefore, corrcsive or which are very velatile. The only low-melting
binary systems of stable, non-volatile chlorides are those containing
LiCl; LiCl1-CsCl (330°C at 45 mole % CsCl), LiCl=-KCl (355°C at 42 mole
%Z KCl), LiC1-RbCl (312°C at 45 mole % RbCl). Such systems would be rela-
tively expensive if made from 7Lici, and they could lead to serious
contamination of the fuel if normal LiCl were used.

Very few fluorides or mixtures of fluorides are known to melt at
temperatures below 700°F (370°C). Stannous fluoride (SnF,;) melts at
212°C. This material is certainly not stable during long-term service

 

 
Ee

137

in Hastelloy N; moreover, its phase diagrams with stable fluorides (such
as NaF or LiF) show high melting points at relatively low alkali fluoride
concentrations. Coolant compositions which will meet the low liquidus
temperature specifications may be chosen from the NaF-BeF, or NaF-LiF-
BeF, system. These materials are compatible with Hastelloy N, and they
possess adequate specific heats and low vapor pressures. They (especially
those including LiF) are expensive, and their viscosities at low tempera-
ture are certainly higher than desirable.

On balance, the best material for use as the MSBR secondary coolant
appears to be a mixture of sodium fluoride and sodium fluoroborate.
These compounds are readily available, inexpensive, and appear tc be
sufficiently stahle to the radiation field within the primary heat
exchanger. The mixture of NaF-NaBF, with 8 mole 7 of NaF melts at the .
acceptably low temperature of 725°F, and its physical properties seem
adequate for its service as a heat transfer agent. These compounds are
not ideally compatible with either steam or the MSBR fuel, but, as de-
scribed in more detail below, the reactions are neither violent nor par-
ticularly energetic.

The fact that fluoroborates show an appreciable equilibrium pressure
of gaseous BF3 at elevated temperatures presents minor difficulties. The
BF3 pressures are moderate [41]; they may be calculated from

5.920
log Pore = 9,024 TOR
(yielding 200 torr at 850°K) and clearly present no dangerous situations.
It is necessary, however, to maintain the appropriate partial pressures of
BF; in any flowing cover gas stream to avoid composition changes in the
melt.

Present Status of Fluoroborate Chemistry

 

Phase Behavior. - The binary system NaF-NaBF, has been described
[80,81] as showing a eutectic at 60 mole 7 NaBF, with a melting point
of 304°C (580°F). Our studies [82] have shown that these previously
published diagrams are seriously in error.* Our recent studies, made
with quite pure NaF and NaBF,, show that the system contains a single
eutectic at 8 mole % NaF and a melting point of 384°C (723°C). The
phase diagram [82] for this simple system is shown in Fig. 5.9.

*
Boric oxide substantially lowers the freezing point of NaBFy

mixtures, and it is possible that the original authors used quite impure
materials; it is, however, difficult to see why the previous studies
were so incorrect.

Behavior with Hydroxide Ion. - Sodium hydroxyfluoroborate (NaBF30H)
is a common minor contaminant in commercial NaBF, that is prepared by
aqueous processes. Pure NaBF;0H can be decomposed completely at tempera-
tures near 100°C [83] through the bimolecular reaction:

2NaBF 30H + NayByFg0 + Hy0

This material cannot, accordingly, be used as az major constituent
for high-temperature coolant. However, when the NaBF;0H is present in
very dilute solution in NaBF, it is "matrix isolated," the bimolecular
decomposition reaction is inhibited, and the material is considerably
more stable [84]. Such hydroxyfluoroborates are appreciably more re-
active than fluoroborate to structural metals, as is discussed in more
detail in a subsequent section; however, there is considerable evidence
that as much as 30 ppm of H can be present as OH” in the fluorcborate
melt without undue corrosive effects upon Hastelloy N [85].

Relative stability of such quantities of OH” (and, by analogy of OT)
may be an important aid to control of tritium (see chapter 14). If, for
example, the coolant can be made to contain several ppm of H (10 ppm is
more than 4 kg of H in the nearly 10° lbs of coolant) and if the exchange
reaction

CH” + T ~~ OT” + H

could be made to proceed, the coclant mixture would afford a means for
holdup of the tritium diffusing from the primary heat exchanger.

Some initial studies have been performed in which D, has been
bubbled into, or alternatively allowed to diffuse through nickel tubing
into, NaF-NaBF, melts [86]. These melts contained hydroxide ion equiv-
alent to some 25 ppm of H and a considerable quantity {perhaps 3000 ppm)
of oxide. Direct observation by infra-red spectroscopy showed that OD”
grew into the melts. No corresponding decrease of OH” occurred. These
studies strongly suggest that the exchange reaction indicated above is
not occurring but that the added deuterium is reacting with oxide impu-
rities, perhaps by

D, + B,Fg02™ + NiO = 2BF30D” + Ni .

Further study of such reactions is clearly necessary to determine the
precise mechanism and to establish whether the reaction can be made
sufficiently rapid and quantitative to fix the diffusing tritium.

Physical Properties. — Pertinent physical properties for the eutec-
tic NaF-NaBF; coolant mixture are presented in Table 5.11. Partial pres-
sures of BF3 above the mixture have been measured with some care, as have
liquidus temperatures [41]. However, other properties of the salt, as
were the properties of the MSBR fuel mixture, have been estimated. The
values given are quite unlikely to be in serious error, but an experimen-
tal program to firm up these estimated values is clearly necessary.

Compatibility with Hastelloy N. = Acceptable compatibility of the
NaF-BF,; coolant with Hastelloy N under realistic conditions seems assured
by numerous corrosion tests [42,87,88], though the number of such tests
is much smaller than that for LiF-BeF, mixtures.

Thermodynamic data for possible reactions of the NaF-NaBF, mixture
is in a somewhat less satisfactory state than is that for the fuel mix=-
tures. The free energy change for the chemical reaction

 

BF (g) + 30r(c) =30rF,(d) + B(c)

appears to be about + 30 kcal at 800°K [89]. The reactions of BF; with
Fe and Ni are even less likely to occur. In addition, these reactions
become somewhat less likely (perhaps by 5 kcal or so) when one considers
energetics of formation of NaBF, and its dilution by NaF.

Reactions which produce metal borides and fluorides are somewhat
more difficult to assess. Titanium, a minor constituent of Hastelloy N,
has a moderately stable boride [90]. The reaction

2BF3(g) + 311 (c) = TiB, (c) + 1iF, (4)

probably must be expected to proceed, but the very low rate of diffusion
of Ti in Hastelloy N would be expected to limit the extent of reaction
markedly. Thermochemical data for the borides of Fe, Cr, Ni, and Mo do
not seem to have been established. Unless they have free energies of
formation more negative than 25 kcal/B atom the Hastelloy N should prove
resistant to pure NaF-NaBF, coolant. The several corrosion tests seem
to have produced no evidence for formation of borides of these metals.
Oxidizing impurities in the fluoroborate mixture selectively attack
the chromium in Hastelloy N, as they do in the fuel mixture, but the prod-
uct of corrosion is CrFj3 rather than CrF, [42]. The reaction of FeF»
in fluoroborate melts, for example, appears to be

FeF(d) + 5Cr > Fe(c) + 2Cr¥s.
If the fluoroborate is sufficiently impure the corrosion product CrFj3
exceeds its solubility limit and precipitates as NajCrFg.* While some
of the initial corrosion tests with quite impure fluoroborate mixtures
produced such precipitation (and severe corrosion) [42], none of the
more recent studies have encountered this difficulty.

Similar corrosion to produce CrF; and ultimate precipitation of
NaK,CrFg was observed long ago in studies of UF, dissolved in the ternary
eutectic of NaF-KF-LiF [91].
142

Long periods of stable operation of natural and forced convection
loops with moderately pure NaF-NaBF, mixtures have shown that corrosion
rates below 0.5 mil per year and approaching 0.1 mil per year can be a
obtained [42,92,87].

Interactions with Steam. - Fluorcborates react readily with steam.
The reaction, which is not violent or particularly energetic, is

 

H,0 + NaBF, ¥ HF + NaBF30H . =

It is well known that the HF so produced is quite corrosive; it 1s capable
of reaction with Ni and Fe as well as with Cr and can cause generalized
attack. The FeF, and NiF, so generated are then capable of reaction with
Cr in the alloy [87]. Cantor and Waller [85] have recently shown that

the reaction of OH~ in dilute solution (25 ppm and below) with Hastelloy
N* occurs slowly; this reaction can apparently be represented as

OH™ + Sor = Zor + 2H, + 027 -

Ingress of steam, as from a leak in the MSBR steam generators, to
the fluorcborate coolant circuit must, accordingly, be expected to re-
sult in increased corrosion. Such an increase has, indeed, been observed
in deliberate additions of steam to an operating test loop containing
removable specimens in hot and cold regions [87,93]. Relatively rapid
corrosion followed the steam addition; chromium concentration in the
circulating salt rose from 82 ppm te about 320 ppm in about 1700 hours
and remained essentially constant [93]. Examination of specimens removed
at intervals from the loop also indicated that the attack decreased with GE
time after the initial exposure to steam [87,93]. These data strongly
suggest that the Hastelloy N system can tolerate inleakage of steam and,

 

once the leak is repaired, could continue to operate without extensive

damage even if the salt were not repurified [93]. It is clear, however,
that continuous inleakage of steam in appreciable quantity would require
a purification system for the fluoroborate salt.

 

Interactions with Fuel Salt. - The MSBR design [10] will assure that
the pressure on the coolant is slightly higher than that on the fuel salt,
so that a minor leak in the primary heat exchanger will result in coolant
salt entering the fuel. Such a leak, even though small, will be recog-
nized at once because of the marked reactivity loss resulting from admis-
sion of boron into the fuel.

 

 

 

It is worthy of note that the NaF-NaBF, mixture for that study,

which was shown to contain at least 25-30 ppm of H along with about
350 ppm Cr3t and 3900 ppm 0%-, was drawn from an operating test loop
whose performance with respect to corrosion was quite satisfactory. 2

Mixing a small quantity of NaF-NaBF, salt with the fuel effectively
dissociates the NaBF, into NaF and BF3;. The NaF will dissolve in the
LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, salt mixture; the BFj3 will distribute between the fuel
salt and the available vapor space and, if operation of the reactor were
continued, would be swept into the off-gas system. Additions of large
quantities of coolant, as might occur in the unlikely event of a gross
failure in the primary heat exchanger, produce more complex effects and
can result in appreciable pressures of BFj.

The solubility of BF; in the MSBR fuel solvent has been carefully
measured [94]. The solubility decreases with increasing temperature and
increases linearly with BF3 pressure. From these data one can calculate
the equilibrium pressure of BF3; from small leaks of NaF-NaBF, into MSBR
fuel in a closed system. This equilibrium pressure clearly depends upon
the amount of NaF-NaBF, admitted and the available vapor space. If we
assume that the only vapor space available is the small bubble fraction
(assumed to be 1%) in the fuel,* then one can show that inlesgkage at
1250°F of 1 cubic foot (110 1bs) of NaF-NaBF,; coolant results in a BFg
pressure of (0.17 atmosphere. It seems clear that leaks of this order do
not result in a dangerous situation.

Addition of substantial quantities of NaBF, to several fluoride
mixtures generally similar to the MSBR fuel resulted in liquid-liquid
immiscibility [95]. Mixing equal weights, for example, of 2LiF-<BeF,
and NaBF, at 600°C produced two liquid phases. The less dense phase
was rich in BF3 and contained little BeF,; the dense phase was rich in
BeF, with little BF3. LiF and NaF partitioned between these phases, with
the light phase rich in NaF and the heavy phase rich in LiF. Other experi-
ments [95] showed that UF, (presumably ThF, would behave similarly) was
almost completely retained in the heavy phase. No such equilibrations to
define the miscibility limits or the equilibrium distributions of the
several ions in the two phases have been performed with the MSBR fuel
composition. Consequently, the extent to which this liquid-liquid
immiscibility limits the BF; pressure upon mixing large quantities of
NaF-NaBF, with MSBR fuel camnot be accurately assessed. However, the
fact that considerable pressures of BF3 (in reasonable accord with esti-
mates based on the measured solubility [94] of BF3) are developed upon
mixing MSBR fuel with one-third its volume of NaF-NaBFj3 coolant has been
demonstrated experimentally {96].

It appears certain that small leaks of coolant into the fuel system
pose no real problems. It is clear, however, that additional study of
mixing of these fluids in realistic geometries and in flowing systems is
needed before one can be certain that no potentially damaging situation
can arise as a consequence of a sudden major failure of the heat ex-
changer.

*
This is clearly a worst case. It completely ignores the large
volume in the off-gas system.
144

Purification of Fluoroborate Mixtures. — Initial purification of
NaF-NaBF, mixtures for use in corrosion and other engineering tests has
not posed serious problems, since the purity specifications are less
severe in several ways than are those for the fuels, and quite pure NaBF,
preparations are available commercially at reasonable costs. Recent
preparation [97] methods have consisted simply in (1) mixing the NaBF,
with the required quantity of NaF, (2) heating the mixed powder at a
controlled rate to 300°C under reduced pressure, {3) heating the material
to 500°C under a static atmosphere of inert gas, (4) mixing the molten
mixture by brief sparging with BF3, (5) purging the BFj3 by a brief treat-
ment with flowing argon, and (6) transferring the salt mixture to its
storage container. Chemical analyses of material prepared in this simple
way show oxide concentrations of about 325 ppm and hydrogen (proton) con=-
centrations of about 15 ppm. Analyses for Fe2t show values near 150 PPI;
this could almost certainly be decreased by a more stringent purifica-
tion procedure.

Simple procedures such as that described above may suffice for the
original coolant loading of an MSBR, but it seems certain that additional,
on-line treatment will be required during reactor operation. The inevi-
tability of small inleakages of steam, for example, will require some
repurification reprocessing. Moreover, if the fluoroborate mixture is
to help with the tritium problem (by tritium exchange with NaBF30H or
other reactions yielding NaBF30T), some processing method for removing the
contained T on a reasonably short time cycle will be necessary.

The reaction of fluorcborate with steam,

H,0 + NaBF, = HF + NaBF30H ,

is a reversible one, and treatment with HF (appropriate pressures of BFj
must be added tec maintain the melt composition) can return the melt to
its original condition. It appears, however, that this reaction may be
too inefficient for use in a practical system. Such purification could
certainly be accomplished by use of fluorine; this reagent (mixed with
BF3) should certainly remove the OH (OT) as well as the contained oxides.

Fo + NaBF 0H ~ HF + 20, + NaBF,

and

F, + NayByFgO + 2NaBF, + 20,

It is possible that direct fluorination (presumably using a frozen-wall
fluorinator) may be necessary, but studies are needed to determine
whether less active reagents can serve the purpose.

~ The fluorcborate coolant salt will be exposed
to intense gamma radiation and an appreciable delayed neutron flux in the
primary heat exchanger. Consequently investigations of such radiation
effects were undertaken [98].

The gamma irradiation was carried out in spent High Flux Isotope
Reactor (HFIR) fuel elements. A 2.0 cm ID X 9 cm Hastelloy N capsule
containing 32 g NaBF,~NaF (92-8 mole 7%) was irradiated for 1460 hr at
600°C in three successive elements discharged from the HFIR. The total
dose was 7.7 X 1019 R (0.15 W/g average, 0.5 W/g maximum); for compari-
son, the anticipated gamma dose in a 1000-MW(e) MSBR dis ~0.25 W/g. The
pressure in the capsule was monitored during the irradiation and showed
only results consistent with the expected BF3; equilibrium pressure.
Analysis of the gas at the conclusion of the experiment (ambient °C)
showed no HF, BF3;, or flucrine,

Examination of the salt on opening the capsule showed no chbservable
effects of the irradiation. A 29-cm? Hastelley N corrosion specimen
exposed in the capsule showed negligible weight loss (0.0007 g). The
results in the irradiated capsule were in all respects comparable to
those observed in an unirradiated control experiment.

A literature search. and analysis indicated the direct n,o reaction

0B; + n> "LiF + a + Fy

would be the major source of fluorine due to the delayed neutron flux.
The y radiation and other considerations indicate that secondary effects
from the Li and ao recoils are of little consequence, apparently because
of rapid recombination of fragments from collisions with BF,”. Thus,

if NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) is exposed to an estimated 15 X 10!® delayed
n/sec in an MSBR primary heat exchanger, the fluorine produced would
amount to only 8 moles of fluorine per year.

Evaluation and Summary of Needed Work

 

A considerable study of many aspects of fluorocborate chemistry has
been conducted during the past few years. Nevertheless, our understand-
ing of the chemistry of the NaF-NaB¥F, system is less complete, and our
knowledge of its behavior rests on a less secure foundation, than that
for the MSBR fuel system. There are several areas, accordingly, where
further or additional work is needed, though it seems unlikely that the
findings will threaten feasibility of NaF-NaBF, in the MSBR concept.

Phase behavior of the simple NaF-NaBF, system and the equilibrium
pressure of BF; over the pertinent temperature interval are well under-
stood. If the NaF-NaBF, eutectic or some near variant of it is the final
coolant choice, little effort need be spent in these areas.

Additional information is needed, however, on the behavior of oxide
and hydroxide ion in the fluoroborate melts. Solubility of Na,B,Fg0 in
the mixture is not well known, equilibria (in inert containers) among
H,0, HEF, NaBF30H, and NayB,Fg0 are still needed, and rates of reaction
146

of dilute NaBF30H solutions with metals need definition. In addition,
the mechanism by which tritium, diffusing from the fuel system, can be
trapped as BF30T™ needs additional study before its value can really
be assessed.

As indicated above, several of the physical property values have
been estimated. These estimates are almost certainly adequate for the
present, but the program needs to provide for measurement of these
quantities.

Compatibility of the NaF-NaBF, with Hastelloy N under normal oper-
ating conditions seems assured. Additional study, in realistic flowing
systems, of the corrosive effects of steam inleakage is necessary. This
study, closely allied with the equilibria and kinetics among the hydrox-
ides and oxides described above, needs ultimately to culminate in a dem=—
onstration loop capable of simulating steam inleakage and coolant re-
purification. :

Mixing of coolant and fuel clearly requires additional study. The
situation which results from equilibration of these fluids is reasonably
well understood, and, even where large leakages of coolant into the fuel
are assumed, the ultimate "equilibrium" seems to pose no real danger.
However, the real situation may well not approximate an equilibrium
condition. Studies of such mixing under realistic conditions in flowing
systems are lacking and necessary.

Purification procedures for the coolant mixture are adequate for the
present and can be used to provide material for the many necessary tests.
These are not adequate for ultimate on-~line processing of the coolant
mixture during operation. Fluorination of the coclant, on a reasonable
cycle time, would almost certainly suffice though it has not been demon-
strated. A process using a less aggressive reagent is clearly desirable.

The fluorcborate mixture has shown completely adequate radiation
stability in the single (though realistically severe) test run. Addi-
tional radiation testing of this material in a flowing system would
seem desirable and should ultimately be done, but this study would not
at present have a high priority.

0f the several alternative secondary salts mentioned in the text the
best candidates all contain lithium. There seems little doubt that sev~
eral of these materials (LiCl-KCl mixtures, for example) could be shown
toc be suitable coolants, although a considerable program of chemical
development and corrosion testing would be necessary. The same would
be true for the nitrate-nitrite mixtures before they could be used at
high temperature in an MSR tertiary loop.

Analytical Chemistry

Requirements

In order to exploit fully the unique features of the MSR concept and
ensure safe and efficient reactor operation, it will be necessary tc main-
tain adequate surveillance of the composition of various reactor streams.
Ideally, all such analyses would be performed automatically with trans-
ducers located in the salt streams, since analysis of discrete samples in
hot cells is subject to unavoidable delays and is expensive.

 

 

 
 

147

At present, it appears that it may not be practical to measure major
fuel constituents such as Li, Be, Th, fluoride, and perhaps U by in-line
methods in an MSBR. Fortunately, a continuous monitoring of these con-
stituents will not be critical to the operation of a reactor. The more
critical determinations, on the other hand, are generally amenable to in-~
line measurement. Determinations which appear of most significance to
the program include the redox condition of the fuel,* corrosion product
ions (particularly cr?t and possibly T13+), oxide, bismuth, hydrogen and
tritium, certain fission products, and protactinium in fluoride streams.
Similar determinations may be required in chloride streams of the reproc-
essing system. In-line analyses for permanent gas contaminants, moisture,
tritium, hydrocarbons, and fission product gases will be needed in the
fuel cover gas. To this list must be added BF;, HF, hydrogen, and hy-
drolysis products in the coolant cover gas and perhaps HF, Fy, and UFg
in gaseous streams from the reprocessing system.

It should be noted that in addition to economics of time and expense,
the in-line techniques will provide information not attainable by discrete
sampling methods. A notable example is the USt/U“F ratio in the fuel.
This ratio is prohibitively semsitive to atmospheric contamination during
sampling and sample transfer in hot cells, and is rather meaningless on
frozen samples because the ratio undergoes changes during cooling as a
result of equilibrium shifts. Another example is the determination of
trace constituents in gases, which is notoriously difficult if not im-
possible to do by withdrawing samples.

It is evident that the ultimate need is an analytical system for an
MSBR that includes the most complete in-line analytical measurements pos—

“sible, backed up by adequate hot cell and analytical laboratories. In

the interim period it 1s necessary to develop capabilities and to provide
analytical support for the technology programs.

Experience

The major development of analytical methods for discrete samples
was associated with the operation of the MSRE. The analytical methods
for this reactor were developed to support the objectives of the chemical
surveillance program [9, p. 1]. With the exception of in-line analyses
of the off-gas and remote gamma spectrometry (described later in this
section), all analyses were performed on batch samples either in hot cells
or by bench top methods.

Prior to the MSRE program, we had substantial experience in the han-
dling and analysis of nonradioactive fluoride salts in the ANP program.
Ionic or instrumental methods had been developed for most metallic con-
stituents, and methods were available for F~ (pyrohydrolysis) [99] and

sulfur [100]. For MSRE application it was necessary to adapt these
methods to hot-cell operations. A technique involving the evolution of
elemental oxygen by reaction with BF3 has since resulted in the versa-
tile KBrFy method [101] for oxide in inorganic samples. A nonselective
measurement of "reducing power" of adequate sensitivity had been developed
(hydrogen evolution method) [102]. A general expertise [103] in the radi-
ochemical separation and measurement of fission products was available
from earlier reactor programs at ORNL, and useful experience with in-line
gas analysis, particularly process chromatography [104], was available
from other programs.

During the operation of the MSRE and in the subsequent technology
program, development of methods for discrete samples was continued, and
the Laboratory has acquired instrumentation for newer analytical tech-
niques. Instrumental methods which have or are expected to contribute
to the program include: x-ray absorption, diffraction, and fluorescence
techniques, NMR, spark source mass spectrometry, ESCA and Auger spec-
trometry, electron microprobe measurements, scanning electron microscopy,
Raman spectrometry, Fourier transform spectrometry, neutron activation
analysis, delayed neutron methods, photon activation analysis, and scan-
ning with high-energy particles, e.g. protons. The detailed description
of all analytical methods available to the program is beyond the scope
of this report. A tabulation of our analytical capabilities is given
elsewhere [105]. Certsin developments merit additional mention and are
described below.

Sampling. - The preparation of homogenized samples of MSRE fuel for
elemental analyses presented problems because of the radicactivity and
the hygroscopic nature of the salt [9, p. 27]. Salt samples were taken
in small copper ladles which were sealed under helium in a transport
container in the sampler-enricher [106] for delivery to the hot cell.
There the ladle was unloaded and sectioned. The salt was removed from
the truncated ladle and homogenized by a vigorous shaking in a pulveriz-
er vessel. Salt transfer was then made with minimal atmospheric expo-
sure to a polyethylene vial threaded into the bottom of the pulverizing
vessel. This procedure provides a free-flowing powdered sample within
two hours of receipt of the ladle. Atmospheric exposure was sufficient
to compromise the determination of oxide and Ut but did not affect
other measurements.

Oxide. - Because of the sensitivity of the pulverized salt to un-
avoidable atmospheric contamination, we adopted transpiration techniques
in which the entire samples could be analyzed. For the more critical
determinations, the most successful application of transpiration tech-
niques was the determination of oxide by hydrofluorination [107]. The
method is based on the evolution of water which occurs when melts are
sparged with mixtures of anhydrous HF in hydrogen. By removing surface
moisture with a premelting hydrofluorination step and by measuring the
water evolved from 50-g samples as an integrated signal from an electro-
lytic moisture monitor, we measured oxide concentrations of about 50 ppm
with precision better than +10 ppm.

Uranium. - Analyses for uranium by coulometric titration [18] showed
good reproducibility and high precision (0.5%), but on-line reactivity
balance calculations were about 10-fold more sensitive than this in estab-
lishing changes in uranium concentrations within the circuit. We have
demonstrated that it is possible quantitatively to collect the decontami=-
nated UFg from the fluorination of 50-g samples of molten fuel [108].

The technique was used primarily to separate uranium for precise isotopic
analysis, but sufficient work was done to establish its potential for a
more accurate uranium determination by measurement of the separated ura-
nium outside the hot cell.

ust, - We tested a hydrogenation transpiration method for the deter-
mination of U3* in fuel [109]. The rate of production of HF from the
sparging of fuel with hydrogen is a function of the instantaneous ratio
of USt/u%t, Because corrosion products also contribute HF, the integrated
yield from a batch hydrofluorination is related to fuel composition by an
equation [109] that cannot be explicitly solved for uranium ratios. By
use of computer techniques we devised a 4-step, 2-temperature reduction
procedure to produce HF yields sensitive to ratio change. During 235y
operation (with 0.9 mole % UF) we obtained u3*t/u4t ratios in reasonable
agreement with "book values' obtained from reactor charging and operating
data (Fig. 5.10). However, the method proved inadequate for the lower
concentrations of uranium in the 233 fuel.

We also applied a voltammetric method to the measurement of U3H/u“t
ratios in remelted fuel samples [110] (see section on Electrochemical
Research for a description of voltammetry). We performed these measure-
ments with electrodes inserted in samples remelted in their ladles. More
atmospheric exposure was incurred than in the oxide determinations, be=
cause it was necessary to cut off the top of the ladles to accommodate
the electrodes. Accordingly, we obtained ratios below those expected.

We were, however, able to observe normally shaped voltammograms for crt
and Ut reduction waves and to follow the reduction of the fuel by hy-
drogen sparging. We also observed changes in ratios with temperature
that were consistent with thermodynamic predictions of equilibrium shifts
between the uranium couple and corrosion product ions. This indicated
that the radiation level of the samples had negligible effect on the
method and supports the potential of voltammetry for application to re-
actor salt streams.

Spectrophotometry of Radicactive Samples. — We constructed a facility
(110, pp. 202-204] which permitted the measurement of highly radioactive
samples within a hot cell by using the components of a spectrophotometer
located outside the cell (Fig. 5.11). A system of extended optics di-
rected the chopped reference and sample beams through the cell walls,
focused the sample beam at the center of an optical furnace, and returned
the two beams through the wall to the monochromator-detector section of
the instrument. The system design included devices for remelting large
salt samples under inert atmosphere and dispensing portions to spectro~-
photometric cells, but because of the imminent shutdown of the MSRE we

devised a sample system to fill windowless cells by direct immersion in

the fuel. Despite precautions to prevent atmospheric exposure, the ust

in these samples was completely oxidized before measurements could be sa
made. We were able, however, to observe the spectrum of ut and (follow=~
ing a reduction with uranium metal) that of U3, Comparison of the spec-
tra of these samples with those of nonradioactive preparations indicated
no adverse effects from the activity of the fuel and demonstrated the
feasibility of the technique. The facility has since been used to meas—
ure the spectra of transuranium elements and protactinium in molten salts.

Gas Analysis. - Equipment was installed at the MSRE to perform limited
in-line analyses of the reactor off-gases, using a thermal conductivity "
cell as a transducer. By means of an oxidation and zbsorption train [108,
p. 196] we were able to measure both total impurities and hydrocarbons in
the off-gas. The sampling station alse included a system for the cryogenic
collection of xenon and krypton on molecular sieves to provide concen- &
trated samples for the precise determination of the isotopic ratios of
krypton and xenon by mass spectrometry. During the last two runs of MSRE,
we set up equipment [111, p. 183] at the reactor to convert the tritium Cw
in various gas streams to water for measurement by scintillation counting.

 

Gamma Spectrometry at the MSRE, - By means of a precise collimation
system mounted on a maintenance shield, radiation from deposited fission
products on components was directed to a high-resolution lithium-drifted
germanium diode [108, p. 36]. From the gamma spectra obtained we were a
able to identify specific isctopes such as noble metal fission products
and to map their distribution by moving the collimating system [112].
During the latter rums of the reactor such measurements were made during
power operations [112].

Bismuth. - The investigation of the metal transfer reprocessing sys-
tem described in Chap. 11 required the development of more sensitive methods
for the determination of bismuth in fuels. We found the inverse polaro-
graphic technique to be most useful, with detection limits of about 50 ppb
[110, p. 208}. The bismuth is deposited in a pendent mercury drop elec-~
trode from HCI solutions in which copper is masked with thiocyanate, and
measured during an anodic scan. We alse developed a spectrographic method
of at least equivalent sensitivity; however, it incorporates a preconcen-
tration by extraction with dithizone and requires large salt samples.

 

 

Current Research gnd Development

 

The research program is directed toward the development of methods
and equipment that can be used for the in-line analyses of the reactor
streams. We are increasing our competence in the areas of electrochemis~
try, spectrophotometry, transpiration methods, and gas analysis with
regard to reactor salt and gas streams. Priority is given to ideas and
areas of research which appear to coffer the most promise of leading to
in-line analysis methods.

Electrochemical Research. ~ For the analysis of molten-salt streams,
electroanalytical techniques such as voltammetry and potentiometry appear
to offer the most convenient transducers for remote in-line measurements.
Voltammetry is based on the principle that when an inert electrode is
inserted into a molten salt and subjected to a changing potential versus
the salt potential, negligible current will flow until a critical poten-
tial is reached at which one of the ions undergoes an electrochemical re-
duction or oxidation. The potential at which this reaction takes place
is characteristic of the particular ion. If the potential is varied lin-
early with time, the current-voltage curve follows a predictable pattern
which allows the concentration of the dissolved ion to be determined (Fig.
5.12).

We have studied the voltammetry of the corrosion products which will
be present in the reactor salt streams in the ppm range. Relatively high
concentrations of these corrosion products may be measured by observing
the current passing through the electrode system as the respective ions
are reduced. Lower concentrations can be measured with the technique of
stripping voltammetry through observation of the current produced when a
corrosion product is oxidized from an electrode on which it has previously
been plated (Fig. 5.13). We have studied the electrochemical behavior of
these elements in the MSRE fuel solvent, LiF-BeF,-ZrF, [113,114,108,

p. 192, 115], and in the proposed MSBR coolant salt, NaF-NaBF, [114,116,
115}. Most of this work was concerned with the determination of the oxi-
dation states of the elements, the most suitable electrode materials for
their analysis, and the basic electrochemical characteristics of each
element. Work is continuing to study the effect of the presence of one
element upon the determination of another and the effects that a flowing
salt stream may have with regard to the determination.

We have developed a voltammetric method for the determination of the
udt/utt ratio in the MSRE fuel [110]. This method involves the measure-
ment of the potential difference between the equilibrium potential of the
melt, measured by an inert platinum electrode, and the voltammetric equiv=-
alent of the standard potential of the ut ut couple. The reliability
of the method was verified by comparison with values that were obtained
spectrophotometrically (Table 5.12). We have completely automated this
determination with a PDP-8 computer [117] which operates the voltammeter,
analyzes the data, and computes the y3t/utt ratio. ]

Because processing (Chapter 11) presents the possibility for having
bismuth as an impurity in the fuel, a method for its determination is re-
quired. We have characterized the reductive behavior of Bi3t in LiF-
BeF,-ZrF, [115] and have found that it is rather easily reduced to the
metal. As an impurity in the fuel salt, bismuth will probably be present
in the metallic state, so that some oxidative pretreatment of the melt
will be necessary before a voltammetric determination of bismuth can be
performed.

The measurement of the concentrations of protonated species in the
proposed MSBR coolant salt is of interest because of the potential use of
the coolant for the containment of tritium. The measurement could alsc
be used to evaluate the effect of proton concentrations on corrosion
rates and as a possible detection technique for heat exchanger leaks.

We are presently investigating a rather unique electroanalytical tech-
nique that is specific for hydrogen [114, p. 74, 115]. The method is

based on the diffusion of hydrogen into an evacuated palladium tube
electrode when NaBF, melts are electrolyzed at a controlled potential.
The pressure generated in the electrode is a sensitive measure of protons
at ppm concentrations. The technique offers the advantages of specific-
ity, applicability to in-line analysis, and the possibility of a measure-
ment of tritium to hydrogen ratios in the coclant by counting a sample
collected from the evacuated tube.

In all electroanalytical measurements it is a distinct advantage
to have an invariant reference potential to which other electrochemical
reactions may be referred on a relative potential scale. A practical
reference must be fairly rugged and of unit construction. We were also
confronted with finding structural materials which would be compatible
with the fluoride melts. Success was finally realized with a Ni/NiF,
reference electrode, shown in Fig. 5.14, where the reference solution
(LiF-BeF, saturated with NiF,) is contained in a single-crystal LaFj
cup [111, p. 184, 118]. We have determined standard electrode potentials
(Table 5.13) for several metal/metal-ion couples which will be present
in the reactor salt streams [110, p. 201]. These electrode potentials
provide a direct measure of the relative thermodynamic stability of
electroactive species in the melts. This information is used in equiiib-
rium calculations to determine which ions can be expected to be present
at different melt potentials.

Spectrophotometric Research. - The effort in our spectrophotometric
research program for molten salts is directed toward the development of
methods that can be used for the in-line determination of dissolved spe-
cies in the salt streams of the MSBR and the salt reprocessing system.
Analyses of molten salts are also performed for research studies related
to the MSR program, and where applicable, spectrophotometric methods are
used to characterize the various species of interest in these salts.

Materials problems are encountered in the design of compartments
to hold the molten samples for spectrophotometric examination. Because
the molten fluorides react with the usually employed light-transmitting
glasses, other cell designs had to be developed. The pendent-drop tech-
nique [119] that we developed first was later replaced with the captive-
liquid cell [120] in which molten salts are contained by virtue of their
surface tension, so that no window material is required. A concept has
been proposed for the use of this cell in an in-line system [121]. Al-
though the light path length through a salt in a captive-liquid cell is
determinable, it is not fixed. The need for a fixed path length promoted
the design and fabrication of a graphite cell with small diamond plate

 

- windows (Fig. 5.15) [108, p. 168], which has been successfully used in a

number of research applications. Another fixed-path-length cell which is
still in the development stage makes use of "porous metal’ [117, p. 161].
Porous metal is a foil that contains a number of small irregular pits
formed by an electrochemical process; many of these pits are etched
completely through the foil, so that light can be transmitted through the °
metal. We have some porous metal made from Hastelloy N and plan to test
its use for cell construction.

The latest innovation in cell design is an optical probe which lends
itself to a sealable insertion into a molten salt stream [114, p. 71].
The probe makes use of multiple internal reflections with a slot of ap-
propriate width cut through some portion of the internally reflected
light beam (Fig. 5.16). During measurements the slot would be below the
surface of the molten salt and would provide a known path length for ab-
sorbance measurements. It is proposed that the probe could be made of
LaFj.

Spectrophotometric studies of uranium in the +3 oxidation state have
shown that it is a likely candidate for in-line determination in the re-
actor fuel [122, 109, p. 163]. An extremely sensitive absorption peak
for ytt suggests its use for monitoring possible leakage of uranium-
bearing fuel into the coolant salt [109, p. 164]. Quantitative characteri-
zations, including absorption peak positions, peak intensities, and the
assignment of spectra, have been made for Ni 2+ Felt, crt, Crt, ust,
uo, +, cu?t, Mn?*, Mn3t, Co?t, Mot, Cr0,2-, Patt, Pult, prt, Na, Smit,
Er", and Ho3*+. Semiquantitative characterizations, including absorption
peak positions, approximate peak intensities, and possible assignment of
spectra, have also been made for Ti3F, yet, v3, Eu?t, sm2t, Cm, and 0,™.

We are also investigating protonated species in the proposed coolant
salt by spectrophotometric methods. Evidence for the existence of
hydrogen—-containing impurities in NaBF, was first obtained from near-
infrared spectra of the molten salt and in mid-infrared spectra of pressed
pellets of the crystalline material [116, pp. 94-96]. Deuterium exchange
studies are being performed to characterize the protonated species in the
molten fluorcborate melts [114, pp. 73]. Two very sensitive absorption
peaks have been identified and are attributed tec species that contain
-0H and -0D. The absorption spectra of several other species have been
observed in fluoroborate melts [116, p. 136]. Our spectrophotometric
program is also providing data for the identification and determination
of solute species in the various melts of interest for the fuel salt re-
processing system [115].

Transpiration and Gas Analysis. ~ Although the transpiration approach
offers the advantage of locating transducers for effluent gas analysis
outside of the highest radiation zones, these devices will still receive
exposure from fission-product gases and their daughters and possibly from
particulate radioactive materials, and thus they will require remote opera-
tion. The only research performed on such transducers has been on methods
for batch samples of the MSRE fuel. The electrolytic moisture moniter was
demonstrated to provide more than adequate sensitivity for the measurement
of water from the hydrofluorination method for oxide and to have adequate
tolerance for operation at the anticipated radiation levels [108, p. 188].
We have developed a method for the remote measurement of micromolar quan-
tities of HF generated by hydrogenation of fuel samples using a trapping—
thermal—conductivity method {108, p. 189].

Commercial gas chromatographic components for the high-sensitivity
measurement of permanent gas contaminants are not expected to be accept-
able at the radiation levels of the MSBR off-gas. Valves contain elas-
tomers which are subject to radiation damage and whose radiolysis preducts
would contaminate the carrier gas. The more sensitive detectors generally
depend on ionization by weak radiation sources and would obviously be af-
fected by sample activity. A prototype of an all-metal sampling valve
[123] has been constructed to effect 6~way, double~throw switching of gas
streams with closure effected by a pressure-actuated metal diaphragm. We
developed a helium breakdown detector capable of measuring sub-ppm con-
centrations of permanent gas impurities in helium. Use of this detector
in a simple chromatograph on the purge gas of an in-pile capsule test
(MTR-47-6) demonstrated that it was not affected by radicactivity [124].
Ironically, subsequent tests with a more highly purified carrier gas
revealed sporadically noisy operation caused by unstable discharges [123].
Tests to circumvent this by controlled impurity additions were suspended
because of more exigent problems.

The analysis of the coolant cover gas involves less radioactivity
but more complex chemical problems. Currently we are investigating
methods for the determination of condensable material tentatively iden~
tified as BF; hydrates and hydrolysis preducts [110, p. 207] and for
other forms of protons and tritium. We believe that "dew-point" and
diffusion methods offer promise for such measurements [114, p. 72]. We
have developed an improved Karl Fischer coulometric titrator to provide
calibration measurements of "H,0" in both simulated and actual cover
gas samples.

In-Line Applications. - We recently demonstrated the first success-
ful chemical analysis for a flowing molten fluoride salt stream [114,
pp. 69-70] by measuring US+/U%t ratios in a loop being operated to de-
termine the effect of salt on Hastelloy N under both oxidizing and re-
ducing conditions. The test facility is a Hastelloy N thermal—convection
loop (NCL-21) in which LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-UF, circulates at about five linear
feet per minute. The analytical transducers are platinum and iridium
electrodes that are installed in a surge tank where the temperature is
controlled at 650°C. We have monitored the U3T/U' ratio over a period
of several months on a completely automated basis. We designed a new
cyclic voltammeter, which provides several new capabilities for electro-
chemical studies on molten-salt systems, for use with this system. The
voltammeter can be directly operated by the PDP-8 family of computers
[116, p. 138]. A PDP-8/I computer is used to control the analysis system,
analyze the experimental output, make the necessary calculations, and
print out the results. As equilibrium conditions were being established,
increases in the U%t concentration were followed as chromium slowly dis-
solved from the Hastelloy N, causing U*t to be reduced. Precipitous
drops in the U3t concentrations were also observed due to the introduction
of oxidizing contaminants when metal specimens were inserted into the
melt (Fig. 5.17). Work is continuing toward the application of our elec-
troanalytical research experience with the corrosion product ions for
their determination in this system.

Provisions have been made in the design of the two MSRP engineering
loops, the Coolant Salt Technology Facility (CSTF) and the Gas System
Technology Facility (GSTF), for the installation of our analytical trans-
ducers. This will provide us with experience on systems where the oper-
ating conditions will more nearly represent those which will be encountered
with an operating reactor.

Future Werk

A variety of tasks must be performed to achieve a completely viable
in-line system for an operating reactor. The electrochemical technique
appears to be the prime candidate for practical in-line fuel analysis be-
cause of the simplicity of its transducers; however, the advent of tunable
lasers [125] and the development of extended path cells may make the spec-—
trophotometric methods competitive.

On the basis of present projections, a significant fraction of the
development effort should be expended in the adaptation of electrochemical
methods to the in-line analysis of the salt in engineering test facilities
such as the CSTF and GSTF. The initial in-line application of electro-
analytical methods (in NCL-21) uncovered practical problems, and, while
these problems have been resolved, we expect that others will be en-
countered in the higher flow systems. In the immediate future we will
concentrate our electroanalytical research on the fluorchorate system to
determine the nature of the protonated species and equilibria involved so
that in-line voltammograms can be interpreted. In future research the
fundamental chemistry of the more noble metals, e.g., Mo, Nb, Tc, and Ru
should be studied. Most of our electrochemical research has been per-
formed in MSRE salt composition at around 500°C with some studies of the
effects of temperature on diffusion coefficients [126,127,128], and much
of the future research should be performed under these same conditions
to permit a direct intercomparison of results. Before application of
voltammetry to reactors, diffusion coefficients in LiF-BeF,;-ThF,-UFy
type melts must be measured at operating temperature; this awaits se-
lection of the exact composition of the breeder fuel.

To fully exploit in-line measurements it will be necessary to de-
vise methods for the oxidation of dispersed metals in salt streams.

Such techniques are desirable for corrosion products and are essential
for the measurement of bismuth which is predicted to be transported pri-
marily as electro-inactive dispersed metal. Gaseous oxidants such as

HF and fluorinated hydrocarbons should be investigated for this appli-
cation.

The spectral research program should be continued with increased
emphasis on the in situ measurement of protonated species in NaBF,.

These techniques are needed to investigate exchange rates of hydrogen
isotopes in order to evaluate the use of the coolant for tritium con-
tainment. The Fourier transform spectrometer should also be used to
investigate infrared emission techniques for measurement of contami-
nants, such as hydrolysis products, in the coolant and its cover gas.
Emphasis should then be shifted to spectral studies of reprocessing
streams.
166

In-line methods for reprocessing streams must ultimately be de-
veloped, but the analytical requirements are not yet established.

Methods for the in-line analysis of the fuel will be readily adaptable a
to fluoride reprocessing streams, and measurements in the less corrosive
chloride streams should be much simpler. Moreover, this less formidable
solvent has encouraged others to work in the medium and the literature
can be exploited when requirements are established.

The low tolerance of the MSBR fuel to oxide contamination necessi-
tates the development of in-line techniques for oxide measurement.
Presently, we feel that a counter-current hydrofluorination technique Ed
(transpiration) offers the most promising approach to the in-line
measurement of oxide, with electrochemical measurement of OH” after
HF equilibration, or the spectrophotometry of oxyanions [116, p. 136},
as alternatives. The in-line application of transpiration methods will
require the development of precise metering systems for low salt flows.

We have an immediate need for transducers (under development) for
measurement of hydrolysis product in the cover gas of the CSTF. Later,
methods of improved sensitivity will be required to analyze the helium
cover gas of the GSTF. We have acquired an ultrasonic detector [129]
which we will couple with an existing chromatograph to provide an ws
instrument for the sensitive determination of contaminants in GSTF
cover gas.

Direct y-spectrometry (of demonstrated value in the MSRE} must be a
incorporated in the MSBR. Some experimental work, e.g., measurement
of Pa, will be needed but does nct appear to merit high priority. The
design of systems for the safe installation of transducers in radio-
active streams is basically an engineering problem and has been delayed,
as has investigation of the effects of radiation on the in-line methods;
these need to be pursued after the basic methods are developed.

Evaluation

The analytical research and development program has clearly demon-
strated the feasibility of performing certain critical determinations
in-line and has provided strong indications that we can ultimately
achieve an optimum program for the analytical requirements of MSBRs.

We believe that with the possible exception of the in-line oxide de-
termination, properly funded analytical development can keep pace with
the rest of the MSR technology program. Gn

6. GRAPHITE

Relationship Between Graphite and Core Design

The graphite in z single fluid molten-salt reactor serves no struc-
tural purpose other than to define the flow patterns of the salt and, of
course, to support its own weight. The requirements on the material are
dictated most strongly by nuclear considerations, namely stability of the
material against radiation-induced distortion, nonpenetrability by the
fuel-bearing molten salt, and nonabsorption of xenon into the graphite.
The practical limitations of meeting these requirements in turn impose
conditions on the core design, specifically the necessity to provide for
periodic graphite replacement and to limit the cross-sectional area of
the graphite prisms. We shall first consider the nuclear requirements
imposed on the material.

Nuclear Requirements

 

Radiation damage in graphite has been extensively studied since 1945
relative to the Hanford production reactors, and more recently under the
various European and American gas-cooled reactor programs [1]. In the
mid 1960's it became increasingly apparent that graphite has a finite
lifetime in a fast neutron environment, and the anisotropically-induced
crystallite growth due to damage ultimately works to destroy the poly-
crystalline bulk material. The fluence that is defined as the useful
lifetime of the graphite depends somewhat on the failure criterion em-
ploved. The gradual deterioration of the material would first reflect
in increased xenon adsorption, followed by salt penetration and eventu-
ally loss of mechanical integrity. The definition presently assumed is
that the material undergoes no significant radiation-induced bulk expan-
sion, cetainly a conservative assumption. If the graphite were to sur-
vive the life of the plant in a high-power density molten-salt reactor
(a peak power density of 100 watts/cm3), it would have to endure a damage
fluence of the order of 3 x 1023 neutrons-cm™?, which is about ten times
what the best existing material will withstand.

Salt penetration into the graphite is restricted by surface tension
if the entrance pore diameters to the internal void structure of the
graphite are of the order of 1 um or less. Seepage of salt into the
graphite would lead to local hot spots which could easily attain tempera-
tures of 1100-1200°C at which the graphite damage rate is increased by
a factor of two over that at 700°C [2]. Fortunately the pore size re-
quirement is easily met by any high-quality fine-grained graphite, and
this requirement leads to no design or material restriction.

The exclusion of xenon-135 from the pores in the graphite with its
attendant improvement in breeding ratio is discussed in detail elsewhere
(see Chapters 4 and 8 above). Translated to a materials requirement,

175
176

xenon exclusion implies effective gas permeabilities of 10-8 cm?/sec
helium STP or less, roughly a pore entrance diameter requirement of
0.01 ym or less. Such pore textures are not attainable in the ordinary ws
fabrication of bulk graphite. The requirement can be easily met by pyro-
lytic deposition of carbon onto a bulk graphite, although questions of
radiation stability again arise.

 

The existence of a finite graphite lifetime forces the reactor de-
sign to low power densities or to periodic graphite removal, as discussed
in Chapter 4. We shall concern ourselves here with the problem of graph- a
ite fabrication and its effect on design. The requirement for salt ex-
clusion, and thereby a fine-grained graphite, alsc determines that the
geometric cross-section of the graphite prisms be kept small. This is
necessitated by the inability to control microstructure to the desired
degree in forming and heat-treating large cross sections. Small sections
also have the advantage of minimizing thermal gradients in the graphite
during reactor operation and thus reducing the rate of radiation damage. wi
In the several design studies for MSR's, the problems of graphite removal
and prism geometry have been solved in several different ways.
In the reference design [3] the core consists entirely of square Lo
prisms approximately four inches on a side. In the central core zone (Zone
I) the requirement of 13.2 volume percent salt leads to sections with small
holes or interprism slots (see Fig. 6.1). Salt volume is traded between
central hole and slots to simplify orificing of the salt flow. For the ws
outer core region (Zone II) the required salt volume of 377% is obtained
by opening up the central axial hole (Fig. 6.2). The entire core is sup-
ported by Hastelloy tie rods and grid plate and is periodically removed wa
as a unit. Although the square cross-section permits easy fabrication
of the base stock graphite, the possible need to pyrolytically treat the
interior surface of the hole presents a formidable fabrication problem.
This problem was circumvented in the Ebasco study [4], which substi-
tuted a slab design for the square prisms (see Figs. 6.3 and 6.4). The
slabs are assembled into hexagonal elements, each of which can be re-
moved as a unit to permit partial core replacement. ws
A similar slab design was utilized in the study of a demonstration
reactor [5], except that no provision was made for graphite replacement
due to the low power density in the core.
Mechanical analysis [6] has indicated there are no significant
thermal or radiation-induced stresses in any of the designs.

 

General Background

have been reactors. It formed the moderator in the Stagg Field experiment
and the prototype Oak Ridge Graphite Reactor. The first extensive ex-

perience with graphite was acquired in the Hanford production reactors
and somewhat later in the British gas-cooled reactors, albeit at lower
ii temperatures and fluences than apply to the MSR's.

More recently the Dragon Reactor initiated the use of graphite at
temperatures in the 1000°C range, followed shortly by the Peach Bottom
Reactor in the U.S. and the AVR Reactor in Germany. Currently, the gas-
cooled reactors are being designed or operated to take graphite tempera-
tures in the 1200-1300°C temperature range.

Much of the experience and data obtained in the gas-cooled reactor

Ce program is directly applicable to MSR's. In particular, data taken at
Hanford in the mid-1960's spanning the temperature range 300-1100°C first
indicated the finite lifetime of graphite subject to neutron-induced

i damage, i.e., its eventual dimensional expansion and loss of mechanical

integrity.

In late 1968 a program was initiated at ORNL to evaluate graphites
for molten-salt reactor application, and more specifically, to determine
what limitations graphite might impose on reactor design. A program plan
was proposed [7] to demonstrate feasibility of improving graphite by 1975,
and to bring such improvements to commercial application by 1980. The
= proposal was ambitious and has not been fully implemented due to funding
limitations. Considerable progress has, nevertheless, been achieved
toward demonstrating the capability of existing materials to meet MSR
requirements and to delineate areas for future development.

 

Current Status

The MSR graphite program has evelved into a four-pronged attack —
Ga to survey existing commercially available graphites for their applica-
bility to an MSBR; to gain sufficient insight into the damage mechanism
to be able to estimate the degree of improvement to be expected in future
graphites; to develcp an in-house capability to fabricate graphites in
order to relate damage behavior to structure and fabrication technique;
and to develop methods of sealing the graphite against xzenon-135 diffusion.
Included in these areas are the necessity to develop design data and

 

Ed cost estimates.

cid Irradiation Damage Studies

 

The basic irradiation damage phenomena in graphite are determined
by the extreme anisotropy of the crystal. The carbon atoms are arrayed
in tightly-bound hexagons in planar array. The planes are well-separated
and weakly coupled. Interstitials produced by neutron bombardment wander
freely between planes and reintegrate as new planes. Vacancies left be-
ro hind are collapsed. We are thus left with the picture of a single crystal
expanding indefinitely in one direction and contracting in the other two
with little change in net volume. In a polycrystalline material, each
crystallite is thus expanding and contracting in varying directions, and
it is hardly surprising the material eventually deteriorates. What is
182

remarkable is its ability to withstand these changes. Partially oriented
pyrolytics irradiated in HFIR to fluences of 3 x 1022 neutrons/cm? at MSR

temperatures expanded 500% in the preferred c-axis direction without losing

mechanical integrity!

During the period 1963-1971, over eighty different experimental and
commercially available graphites were irradiated in HFIR to establish
their dimensional behavior [8}. A picture of the microstructural prop-
erties significant to radiation damage has gradually emerged. Our con-
clusions are as follows.

In the 600-800°C temperature range of interest to molten-salt re-
actors, bulk graphites can be classified into three behavior modes de-
pending on their fabrication history, namely conventional materials,
black-based materials, and monolithic materials [8}. By conventional
materials we include all normal commercial graphites formed from calcined
coke or graphite fillers bindered with thermosetting or thermoplastic

materials and subsequently heat treated. These materials may be isotropic

or anisotropic, but show an immediate volume contraction under damage
followed by rapid and catastrophic expansion. Their lifetimes are in the
range from 1 to 2.5 x 1022 neutrons/cm? (E > 50 keV) (see Fig. 6.5). The
expansion 1s characteristically parabolic with fluence.

The second class, black-based graphites, employs carbon blacks as
fillers, the individual blacks having a roughly spherical crystallite
orientation capable of withstanding high tangential strain. Depending
on heat treatment temperature, they may contract rapidly at first and
expand linearly with further irradiation (see Fig. 6.6). The differing
expansion behavior from the more conventional graphites is tentatively
explained by the ability of the black particles to withstand strain.

The third class, and the one of interest toc us, is the monolithic
materials which appear to be binderless, or for which the filler material
is chemically active and reacts with the binder. The result is an ex-
tremely homogeneous structure usually unmarked by microstructures. Under
irradiation these materials undergo a prolonged stable induction period
before breaking into parabolic expansion (see Fig. 6.7). The lifetimes
of those tested to date lie in the 2 to 3 x 1022 peutrons/cm? range
(E > 50 keV). The best materials of this type are invariably isotropic,
and their induction peried is attributed to their microstrength and
ability to flow plastically to relieve strain. The parabolic expansion
of both these materials and the conventional graphites can be related to
void generation as the structure finally fractures at the crystallite
level [9].

In summary, we feel the general nature of damage in polycrystalline
graphite is understood, and its relationship to microstructure at least
qualitatively demonstrated.

Fabrication Studies

Based on the HFIR irradiation data, a program was initiated in 1970
to explore the fabrication of monolithic graphites specifically aimed at
radiation damage resistance. The program is rather modest in both objec-
tive and scope. Small samples up to three inches in diameter only are

being attempted, and the raw materials have been limited to three cokes
and several thermosetting or thermoplastic binders. The essence cf the
process is in the use of cokes in their uncalcined condition in which
they are still chemically active. The chemical activity between coke
and binder and the more similar shrinkage rates of the two during carbon-
ization result in the desired monolithic structure [10].

During the past year these materials have been undergoing irradia-
tion testing. Currently results are available only up to 1.5 x 1022
neutrons/cm?. To this level they have been stable, and thus confirm our
conclusions from the hypotheses on damage models.

Xenon Control

The problem of effectively sealing the graphite against xenon can
take three forms: direct impregnation by hydrocarbons followed by heat
treatment tc leave a carbon relic in the pore; impregnation with a liquid
or solid salt to fill the pores; or surface treatment to seal off the
pores at or near the surface.

Sufficient experience has been generated in the graphite industry
to indicate the limitations of direct carbonaceous impregnation. The
decomposing hydrocarbon generates gaseous products which must escape to
the surface or rupture the bulk piece. A practical limitation in per-
meability is of the order of 10-° cm?/sec, a factor 100 larger than
required for excluding xenon. This approach has therefore not been ex-
plored in our program.

The use of salts to fill the pores has been looked at cursorily [8]
and is still being investigated. The limitation anticipated is the dif-
fusion of uranium into the salt. Nevertheless, it has been demonstrated
that such a technique can reduce gas permeabilities to the desired range.

The use of pyrolytic decomposition of hydrocarbons has been exten-
sively studied for reactor applications, primarily under the gas-cooled
reactor programs. The background developed there on process parameters,
properties, and irradiation behavior formed the basis for cur program.
The first approach [11] was to utilize a gas impregnation process to
fill the pores near the surface, this being preferred over a coating
process because of its greater resistance to handling damage. The process
consists of alternately pulsing hydrocarbon gas and vacuum, thus effect-
ing a decomposition of the gas deep within the pores of the graphite, and
has proven to be easily controllable and effective. Apparent permeabil-
ities®* in the 1078 cm?/sec range and below are readily attained. Mono-
lithic-type substrates were impregnated and irradiated in HFIR, but the

%
The permeabilities as used here are derived from gas flow measure-

ments through both the sealed region and the remaining unaffected sub-
strate graphite. The actual permeabilities at the sealed surface layer
are probably a factor of 100 lower.

low permeability was quickly lost [12]. Dimensional data readily showed
why. In filling the pores we had also locked the crystallites in the
surface region of the base graphite together and prevented the plastic
flow necessary to relieve the intercrystalline strains produced during
damage. ’

Coating was next investigated, utilizing base graphites and coating
structures known tc be dimensionally stable under irradiation. First ir-
radiation results [8] were mixed; a few samples retained their initial
low permeabilities to the maximum fluence employed, about 2 Xx 1022 neu-
trona/cm?, but the majority were no better than the gaseous-impregnated
materials. It is now known that the coatings were flawed before irradia-
tion, and a revised process has been developed [13]. Samples with un-
flawed coatings are currently being assembled for irradiation testing.

One of the major recent diagnostic advances had been development of
scanning electron microscopes capable of examining graphite surfaces. The
flawed samples alluded to above appeared perfectly sound even under the
light microscope. Under the scanning electron micrescope, various types
of flaws are readily apparent as well as changes in microstructure (see
Fig. 6.8). The defects have been found to be due to faulty gas circula-
tion, soot inclusions, and too sharp corners on the graphite cylinders
being coated. These have all been eliminated in the current coating
process.

Thermal Conductivity

It was originally anticipated that changes in thermal conductivity
due to radiation damage under MSR conditions would be slight. Recent
data, however, have implied this may not be the case [7], and experiments
have been initiated in HFIR to determine the seriousness of the degrada-
tion in conductivity [8]. Preliminary results imply the decrease may be
by a factor of three.

The importance of thermal conductivity is in controlling the internal
graphite temperatures, and thereby the rate of damage accumulation. The
average dimensional change of a graphite prism under radiation damage is
as though the prism were at its mean temperature throughout [6]. Since
damage rate increases with temperature, the desire to minimize internal
temperature gradients is obvious.

Stresses and Creep. - The graphite core prisms, as mentioned above,
are required for no structural purpose except to delineate the sait flow
and to support their own weight when the reactor is drained. However,
the question still exists as to the magnitude of thermal or radiation
induced stresses. These have been calculated for the reference design
with conventional graphite at the worst position in the core, i.e., on
the center line just above the midplane [6]. The calculated stresses are
shown in Fig. 6.9 and are obviously trivial. We conclude that thermal
and radiation~-induced stresses are no problem even for the relatively
poorly behaved conventional type graphites.

Manufacturing Capability and Costs

 

The extensive survey program of various commercial graphites de- wi
scribed above netted one graphite that is acceptable to the MSBR reference
design, a second acceptable but limited in available sizes, and two other
grades which are potentially acceptable. These span, happily, four inde-
pendent vendors.

Great Lakes Carbon Corporation grade H-364 is available in the proper
geometries and possesses a lifetime before significant expansion occurs of
the order of 2.5 x 1022 neutrons/cm? (E > 50 keV) at 715°C. This is 17% wid
less than specified in the reference design but is close enough to be
compensatable by allowing more expansion, reducing the maximum power
density, or replacing the graphite somewhat sooner. Poco grade AXF is wa
the best commercial material we have encountered with a lifetime of the
order of 3 to 3.5 x 1022 but is currently available only in short
lengths. Material submitted by Airco Speer and Pure Carbon Companies
also may fall into the class of these materials but to date have only
been irradiated to 1.5 x 1022, Their behavior appears to be similar to
the best of the monolithic grades.

We have been unable to obtain firm price estimates on these grades w@E
for our application, but they appear to fall into the range of $5-10.00
per pound of finished graphite, even on a first~ocrder basis. Prices of
$5.00 per pound or lower certainly appear to be probable if the market i
becomes sufficiently large to permit the graphite to be handled as a stock
item.

With regard to pyrolytic coating or sealing, there is an existing
industry already producing such coatings primarily for aerospace applica-
tions. However, the most irradiation-resistant type of coating (LTI, or
low temperature isotropic) employs process parameters quite different
from the industrial-developed processes. Cost-estimating is difficult i
since a process has not been developed, but we guess that $25-30 per 1b
of finished graphite in the slab geometry should certainly cover any
reasonable process during its early development. Eventually costs should
drop to $5-7.00 per 1b for reasonable production quantities.

Uncertainties and Further Work

A number of uncertainties remain, none of which particularly affect Ga
the viability of the molten-salt breeder concept. These uncertainties
may effect further compromises in design and perhaps economics, but in
ne case are they vital to the technical or economic use of graphite in

the reactor. Since these uncertainties are readily resolvable by further ©
work on graphite, we discuss the two topics together.

Irradiation Damage and Graphite Fabrication

 

The potential for improved graphites that can be employed in MSBR's
beyond a fluence of 3.5 x 1022 is, we believe, good. The question remains
speculative as to the degree of improvement to be anticipated. Our con-
fidence in anticipating at least incremental improvements has increased
significantly in the past year as our understanding of the relationships
between microstructure and radiation damage has improved. The avail-
ability of HFIR (or fast reactors in the future) to obtain full fluences
in less than a year enables a graphite development program to preceed at
a reasonable rate.

The fabrication process which is currently being studied at ORNL has
only yet been briefly explored. Areas awaiting examination where further
progress can be anticipated are the use of blacks in processes analogous
to the green-coke route, and the use of high-pressure processing for both
raw materials and carbonization. To date very little effort has been
expended by industry and other government laboratories to increase the
life or stability of graphite, and the development of new processes and
diagnostic techniques suggest much more rapid progress can be made. We
believe these alternate fabrication techniques and their relevance to
damage resistance can be at least indicated within two to three years.
The fact that pyrolytic materials have survived to fluences greater than
1.5 x 1022 pneutrons/cm? at 1250°C implies lifetimes of the order of
5 x 1022 neutrons/cm? at 700°C should be attainable.

Xenon Control

The ability to exclude xenon from the graphite by means of pyrolytic
impregnation or coating has not been demonstrated. Alternative techniques
exist but currently remain unexplored.

Both coatings and substrates have separately been shown to survive
to >3 x 1022. Hence, this is strong reason to believe a monolayer coating
can be made to work in the MSBR. However, in the gas=-cooled program where
coatings have been shown te survive equivalent fluences, it has been found
necessary to decouple the substrate and coating. Both low density pyro-
lytic and silicon carbide intercoatings have been employed, and analogous
techniques can be utilized here albeit at an economic penalty. If such
techniques are required, some two to three years' effort will be needed
to develop them. In any event further work to upscale and prepare for
transition to commercial suppliers will be required.

Two further techniques are the filling of porosity in the graph-
ite with either liquid or solid salt. Solid salt, and bismuth as a
stand-in, have been shown to at least yield the right order of gaseous
diffusion rates. The uncertainty remains as to whether the liquid or
solid diffusion rates are sufficiently low. The potential of this ap-
proach can be determined in about one year.

Underlying all of this are questions as to the efficacy of the
helium bubbles and the impedance of xenon diffusion across the graphite-
salt interface to limit diffusion into graphite quite independently of
the permeability, a subject which is discussed in detail in Chapter 8.
192

Thermal Conductivity

 

The thermal conductivity degradation with damage remains to be es-
tablished. This leaves uncertain the maximum cross-sectional area of the
graphite prisms permitted. Although representing only a question of
design, it must be answered. We estimate two to three years will be re-
quired to obtain the necessary irradiation history and data.

Stresses and Creep

     

Present knowledge on creep in graphite leads to an analysis indi-
cating only trivial stresses are developed in the graphite. Recent un-
published results obtained at Hanford may indicate the ability of graphite
te creep deteriorates at high fluences. If so, the problem can again be
avoided by design, but the situation is uncertain. We estimate a minimum
of three to five years to obtain the necessary information.

Evaluation

In general, graphite presents no serious problem to the molten-salt
reactor. At least one vendor has available a satisfactory material in
the required sizes, and there is every reason to believe the lifetime of
future graphites can be incrementally extended to perhaps twice that of
the best existing materials. Cost estimates utilizing present material
capabilities yield 0.17 mill/kWhr, for replacement of the entire core on
a four-year cycle in the reference design, or a somewhat lower cost if.
only the most highly irradiated material is replaced each time. Increas-
ing the lifetime to eight vears reduces the fuel cycle cost by about
0.1 mill/kWhr, but beyond this the cost savings are small. We can thus
state that existing base graphites are acceptable, and future graphites
can probably be developed to reduce replacement costs.

The present methods of pyrolytically coating the graphite appear to
be satisfactory, although radiation testing will require at least ancther
year to demonstrate this. Alternative routes exist, but the question is
eventually one of economics — the value of marginal increases in breeding
gain versus the cost of the coated material.

We have not yet acquired sufficient data on the thermal and mechan-
ical properties of graphites of the type used in the MSBR. Enough is
known to be certain these do not affect the exact shapes of graphite per-
mitted and the means by which the graphite is supported, but additional
data must yet be secured for design purposes.

In sum, there are no reasons to expect graphite to limit the overall
feasibility of molten-salt breeder reactors, and acceptable materials are
available today.

7. MATERIALS FOR SALT-CONTAINING VESSELS AND PIPING

H. E. McCoy
Material Requirements

The metal used in fabricating a molten salt reactor will be exposed
i to several environments. The inside of the primary circuit will be ex-
posed to LiF-BeF,-ThF,~UF,, the coolant circuit to NaF-NaBF,, and the steam
circuit to supercritical steam. Thus, the tubes in the intermediate heat
exchanger will be exposed to both salts and those in the steam generator
to both coolant salt and steam. The bulk fuel salt temperature will range
from 1050° to 1300°F and the coolant from 850 to 1150°F. The steam in
the salt-heated steam generator enters ait 700°F in the reference loops
a and is heated to 1000°F. The outsides of the metal components will be
exposed to containment cell environments composed primarily of nitrogen,
with enough in-leakage of air to make it oxidizing.

The most basic requirement of the structural materials is that they
be chemically compatible with these various environments. The chemical
properties of the salts were discussed in Chapter 5, where it was pointed
. out that the selective leaching of chromium would be the primary mechanism
= for corrosion of iron- and nickel-base alloys by molten fluorides. Thus

the concentration of chromium is an important consideration in selecting
an alloy to be used in molten-salt circuits. Iron is more easily oxidized
EE by the salts than nickel, so the preference (although not necessarily
a requirement) of a nickel-base alloy over an iron-base alloy is immedi-
ately obvious. Good resistance to oxidation in Ny-0, environments is
favored by high chromium concentrations.

The material requirements for steam generators are discussed in

Chapter 8. Satisfying the need for compatibility with the coolant salt
: and resistance to stress-corrcsion cracking in the steam may be difficult
“ with a single alloy suggesting the use of duplex tubes.
The subject of design stresses will be discussed more fully in
Chapter 13, but it is obvious that the material must be capable of with-
= standing without failure the stresses that will be imposed during service.
The relatively high temperatures involved will require that suitable
elastic-plastic analyses be made of all structures. An MSBR will operate
at relatively low pressures, sc a high-strength material does not seem
necessary. However, thermal stresses will likely control the design
and it is quite likely that a material with moderate strength will be
used.
i The primary circuit, particularly the reactor vessel, will be exposed
to neutron irradiation, but no metallic structural members will be in the
highest neutron flux regions. At the vessel wall, the peak thermal and
fast (>0.8 MeV) fluxes will be 6.5 x 10!2 and 1.2 x 101i! neutronsscm 2e.sec”!,
and over a 30-year lifetime with an 807% load factor, the peak thermal and
fast fluences will be 5 x 1021.and 1 x 1020 neutrpns/cm?, respectively.
These relatively low fluence levels are due to the effects of the graphite

1385
196

reflector and could be reduced even further if necessary. The fast
fluence is not high enough for void formation to be a problem, and the
irradiation damage is primarily the high-temperature embrittlement due
to helium generation [1].

An obvious requirement of the structural material is that it must
be fabricable into the forms needed to build an engineering system.
Basic shapes required include plate, piping, tubing, and forgings. For
assembly, the material must be weldable both under well-controlled shop
conditions and in the field. Many iron~ and nickel-base alloys satisfy
these requirements, although the technology is more advanced for some
alloys than for others. The basic ability to work with a material is
more important, however, than having a currently viable technology
in several fabrication shops. The latter factor would simply make the
first unit cheaper.

In summary, one must keep sight of the basic requirements that
the material be compatible with its environments, have acceptable
mechanical properties, both unirradiated and after exposure to the
maximum expected neutron fluence, and be capable of being fabricated
with reasonable ease.

Background

Initial Objectives and Screening Tests

 

The nuclear-powered aircraft application for which molten-salt
reactors were originally developed required that the fuel salt operate
at around 1500°F. Inconel 600, out of which the Aircraft Reactor Experi-
ment was built, was not strong enough and corroded too rapidly at the
design temperature for long-term use. The existing alloys were screened
for corrosion resistance at this temperature and only two were found to
be satisfactory — Hastelloy B (Ni-28% Mo-5% Fe) and Hastelloy W (Ni-25%
Mo-5% Cr-5.5% Fe) [2,3]. However, both aged at the service temperature
and became quite brittle due to the formation of Ni-Mo intermetallic
compounds. These cbservations led to an alloy development program in
which INOR-8, or Hastelloy N, was developed [4,5].

The Metallurgy of Hastelloy N

 

The commercial chemical specifications for "standard" Hastelloy N
out of which the MSRE was built, and for an alloy modified to give it
improved properties, are shown in Table 7.1. The molybdenum is present
for strengthening, but is not in sufficient concentration to cause the
formation of brittle compounds. Chromium is added in the minimum con-
centration required to form a spinel-type oxide [6]. Iron is allowed
in sufficient quantities to permit chromium to be added as ferrochrome;
however, it is not a critical element in the alloy. Manganese has some
effect on the alloy by reacting with sulfur, but sulfur is usually dealt
with during melting by additions of elements such as magnesium. Carbon

is important because it forms carbides that restrict grain growth during
high-temperature treatments and improve the strength. Elements such as
sulfur, phosphorus, and boron, and many others not included in Table 7.1,
are tramp or impurity elements that serve no known useful purpose in the
alloy. These elements generally have little effect on the alloy behavior
as long as they are kept at reasonable concentrations.

Silicon is introduced by the refractories used in the air melting
practice and is an important element. Hastelloy N containing 0.5 to 1%
‘silicon contains stringers of coarse carbides and will form some fine
carbides during annealing at 1200 to 1600°F [7]. These carbides are of
the MgC type, with M having the composition of 27.9% Ni, 3.3% Si, 0.6% Fe,
56.1% Mo, and 40% Cr. They are not easily dissolved during annealing,
so the alloy has stable properties over a broad range of operating temper-
atures. Several melting practices are currently in use that result in
low silicon concentrations. The carbides in these alloys are of the MpC
type, where M is 80 to 90% molybdenum with the remainder chromium. They
are more easily dissclved than the MgC type that contain silicon.

Thus, Hastelloy N is basically an alloy strengthened with molybdenum
and containing enough chromium for moderate oxidation resistance. The
carbide type is controlled by the silicon concentration.

Corrosion Resistance of Hastelloy N

 

Several hundred thousand hours of corrosion experience with Hastel-
loy N and fluoride salts have been obtained in thermal convection [2,3]
and pumped systems [8]. As discussed in Chapter 5, these experiments
showed that the predominant corrosion mechanism in clean fluoride salts
containing uranium was the selective leaching of chromium. Only 7% of
the alloy is chromium and this must diffuse to the surface before it
can be removed by the salt. DeVan measured the rate of chromium diffusion
in Hastelloy N [9], and the measured diffusion coefficients were used
to estimate the chromium profile after 30-year service at 650 and 700°C
in salt oxidizing enough to completely deplete the surface of Cr. As
shown in Fig. 7.1, even in this extreme situation, the depth of removal
is still moderate.

The early work with Bastelloy N and other alloys revealed the impor-
tance of controlling impurities in the salt. Impurity fluorides such as
FeF,, MoF,, and NiF, will react with Cr to form CrF;, a more stable flu-
oride. Water will react with the fluoride mixtures to form HF that will
form fluorides with all the structural metals. Such impurities led to
relatively high corrosion rates of even Hastelloy N in the early experi-
ments. However, we learned how to prepare pure salt mixtures, and very
low corrosion rates were obtained. The ultimate proof of this ability
was the operation of the MSRE where the overall corrosion was held low
for almost four years at temperature.

The preceding discussion applied to the removal of material, but
deposition is also of concern. As the salt circulates from hotter to
cooler regions, the solubilities of the corrosion products in the salt
decrease, and if concentrations are high encugh, material may be deposited.
This process is complex, depending upon chemical driving forces and factors

such as geometry and flow conditions. Fortunately, the salts being con-
sidered for an MSBR tend strongly to deposit material rather uniformly
throughout the cold region and have a minimal tendency to plug heat-
exchanger tubes and salt passages in cooler parts of the system.

Physical and Mechanical Properties of Hastelloy N

 

The physical and mechanical properties of Hastelloy N were evaluated
rather extensively before the MSRE was constructed. These properties have
been summarized previously [10]. The strength of this alloy is quite good
because of the 167% molybdenum. The property changes with time are small
since the alloy does not form intermetallic compounds but only small
amounts of fine carbides.

Experience with Hastelloy N in the MSRE

 

Fabrication. - Although the power level of the MSRE was small, the
system was complex and required the ability to carry out all of the basic
fabrication steps [11]. Many thousands of pounds of basic product forms
were procured from three vendors. Some of the components were built by
commercial vendors, but most cof the fabrication was done in the AEC-Union
Carbide shops at Ozk Ridge and Paducah. Welding, brazing, and inspection
procedures needed for constructing the reactor were developed. One of
the final steps was to make use of the heaters on the vessel to postweld
anneal the final vessel closure weld.

Operation. - As discussed in Chapter 2, the reactor operated very
satisfactorily. The primary system was above 500°C for 30,807 hours
and filled with fuel salt for 21,040 hours. The only failure involving
Hastelloy N was through-wall cracking of a freeze valve coincident with
final shutdown of the system [12]. This failure was due te fatigue from
differential thermal expansion in a part that was constructed too rigidly.

Corrosion. - Corrosion during the operation of the MSRE was followed
both by analyzing the salts and examining surveillance specimens removed
from the core. The primary corrosion product, CrF,, remained below its
solubility limits in the salt; so its concentration could be used as a
measure of the amount of chromium being removed from the metal. The
results of such analyses have been described in detail, (reference 13
and Chap. 5). A simple summary is that the chromium removal was very
small: the total amount accumulated in the fuel salt was equivalent
to that which would be removed from all metal surfaces to a depth of
0.4 mil; the amount appearing in the coolant salt was practically nil.

Surveillance samples located in the core of the MSRE were peri-
opically removed for examination and testing. Samples of both standard
and modified Hastelloy N were always in excellent physical condition
with only a slight amount of discoloration [1,14,15,16], and visual

metallographic examination failed to reveal any changes that were attri-
butable to corrosion. (As discussed in detail later, a serious problem
was revealed after examination of tensile specimens that were stressed
to failure. So that the reader will not later think that we have been
inconsistent, we note here that the cause of the problem was not, in our
terminology, "corrosion'.)

The chromium gradients in some of these samples were measured by the
electronmicroprobe analyzer, and the worst case was a gradient that ex-
tended about 0.8 mil into the material [17]. Standard metallographic [17]
(v100 magnification) examination of several tubes from the coldest part
of the heat exchanger revealed only deposits of a few iron crystals.

The MSRE coolant circuit contained LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) at 550-
650°C for about 26,000 hours. The chromium content of the coolant salt
did not change measurably during this time, and no chromium depleticen
could be detected by metallographic methods.

Thus, the MSRE confirmed in service the basic compatibility of fuel
salt, Hastelloy N, and graphite that had been indicated by many tests.

Radiation Embrittlement. — Many of the surveillance samples from the
MSRE were subjected to mechanical property tests that confirmed our pre-
vious knowledge that Hastelloy N is embrittled by neutron irradiation {1,
14,15,16]. As discussed further in later sections, this embrittlement
cccurs only at elevated temperatures and is due to helium formed in the
metal; it is quite universal among iron and nickel base alloys [18-30].
The degree of embrittlement in the MSRE was equivalent to that noted in
samples irradiated in the ETR and ORR. Thus, the mechanical properties
were not degraded differently when exposed to salt than when exposed
only to inert gas.

Fracture strain was the property cf most concern with respect to
the MSRE. The fracture strains of some samples from the core were only 0.5%
in creep tests at 1200°F, in contrast to strains of >10% for unirradiated
samples. Surveillance specimens exposed alongside of the reactor vessel
at lower flux had strains of only 2% [1,16]. The control rod thimbles
were the only metal in the core, and they were subjected to small compres-
sive forces. The vessel was subjected to very small stresses. Conse-
quently, the rather low strain limits were not exceeded and the system
operated without failure from radiation damage.

The entire area of the design of components for high temperature
service is getting considerable attention. Although the strain limits
have not been firmly established, it seems likely that local strains
above those allowed by standard Hastelloy N must be accommodated.

 

Grain-boundary Cracks. — A second problem noted with Hastelloy N
removed from the MSRE was that shallow intergranular cracks formed in
surveillance samples and all other surfaces in contact with the fuel
[1,14,15,16,171. These cracks generally extended to depths of only about
5 mils, but some were as deep as 13 mils in parts removed from the pump
bowl. Although recognizable (if you were looking for them) in metallo-
graphic sections of some material just as they were when removed from the
MSRE, more were visible and they were opened much wider in specimens such

 
202

as that shown in Fig. 7.2 that had been strained in the hot cell. Cracks
found after straining material that had been exposed in the core were no
more pervasive or deeper than those in the heat-exchanger tubes, which

had been exposed to insignificant neutron flux. By controlled dissolution
of several samples, a number of fission products were found within the
material to a depth of several mils. This suggested that the cracking

was caused by diffusion of fission products down the grain boundaries —
particularly tellurium, which was found at the highest concentration —
and set off the investigation which is described later.

Current State of Materials Development

Corrosion

Hastelloy N (both standard and modified compositions) has been shown
in the MSRE, other in-~pile tests, and large number of ocut-of-pile loops
to have excellent corrosion resistance in salts containing LiF, BeF,,
ThFy, and UF, [2,3,8,31]. This extensive experience confirms the behavior
that would be predicted from calculations such as those plotted in Fig.
7.1.

Corrosion studies with the proposed coolant salt, sodium fluoro=-
borate, have been more limited [32,33,45]. However, we have operated
four thermal convection loops and two pumped systems in the materials
program for az total test time of about 1%0,000 hr (see Chap. 8). This
experience reveals that the fluoroborate salt absorbs moisture quite
readily, with attendant generalized corrosion. On occasions when leaks
developed, the corrosion rate has increased and then decreased as the
impurities were exhausted. During these periods of high corrosion, all
components of the alloy were removed uniformly from the hot leg and de-
posited in the cold leg. Crystals of NayCrFg and NajFeFg deposited in
the cold regions as their solubilities were exceeded. Nevertheless,
pumped loops in which the salt is heated and cooled between 1270 and 795°F
have been operated for several thousands of hours with corrosion rates
of «0.1 mpy, so we believe that satisfactory procedures for using the
salt can be developed.

The corrosion behavior of several other nickel-base alloys was in-
vestigated in screening tests in the aircraft propulsion program [2,3].
The proposed service temperature was 1500°F and most of these alloys were
not considered further because in tests at that temperature large amounts
of chromium were removed, with formation of voids in the hot regions of
test loops and deposition of chromium crystals in the cold regions. In-
conel 600 received the most study of any alloy besides Hastelloy N, and
the evaluation program on it involved several thermal convection loops
and 9 forced convection loops that operated for a total of 79,300 hr [8].
Although the corrosion resistance of Inconel 600 was not as good as that
of Hastelloy N, at temperatures in the range of MSBR's the rates were
sometimes low enough to be of interest, For example, one Inconel 5600
loop operated at a peak temperature of 1250°F for 8801 hr with intergran-
ular penetrations of 1.5 mils. This penetration is high by our current
standards, but was only slightly higher than that cbserved for Hastelloy NK

ature. The MSRE rod thimble was at high temperature for 31,000 hr, with
the lower surface exposed to Nyp-0, gas. This surface was oxidized, and
the cracks only penetrate the oxide. The upper surface of the thimble
sample was exposed to fuel salt for 21,000 hr, during which time the Te
concentration built up. The lower sample was vapor plated with enough
tellurium to produce a concentration of 0.1% in the outer 5 mils and an-
nealed 1000 hr at 650°C.

tested in salt of comparable purity. Thus, it is likely that an alloy
containing 15% chromium (e.g., Inconel 600) would have acceptable corrosion
resistance at 1200°F or less.

The compatibility of iron-base alloys with fluoride salts has received
relatively little attention because the thermodynamic data indicate that
nickel-base alloys with a minimum chromium content will be more corrosion
resistant than iron-base alloys. The initial screening tests on types 300
and 400 stainless steels indicated that these alloys were unsatisfactory
[2,3]. However, one type 304L stainless steel thermal convection loop
containing a fuel salt has been in operation for over 9 years without plug-
ging [35]: the corrosion rate at the peak temperature of 1270°F is about
1.5 mpy. It is quite likely that the corrosion rate could be reduced to
an acceptable value by decreasing the temperature to 1200°F, but tests at
higher velocities would be required to provide more conclusive information.

A most important consideration in the suitability of iron-base alloys
is the possibility that, through some misoperation, the salt could become
oxidizing enough to corrode the irom. This process would not be diffusion
controlled, and thus,K large amounts of material could be transferred quickly
from the hotter regions to the cooler regions of the system. While this
is also true for nickel, it can occur with iron at less severe conditions.
However, we believe that the oxidation state can be controlled closely
enough for the salt to never become this oxidizing to either material.

The compatibility of sodium fluoroborate with iron-base alloys is
unknown. Corrosion in this salt is controlled primarily by impurities,
but iron seems to be attacked as readily as chromium. If the salt could
be maintained very pure, iron-base alloys might be acceptable.

Irradiation Embrittlement

 

The peak fast fluence at the inside surface of the reactor vessel
will be of the order of 1020 neutrons /cm?, which is too low to cause
detectable swelling and void formation in the metal [36]. However, the
peak thermal fluence of 5 x 102! neutrons/cm? is great encugh to produce
significant amounts of helium, about 3 ppm from residual 108 and possibly
another 100 to 200 ppm by transmutations involving nickel that have only
recently been recognized to occur [37]. In standard Hastelloy N the
helium would reduce the grain boundary cchesion and increase the tendency
for grain boundary fracture, with the result that the fracture stains at
elevated temperatures become quite low.

Our approach to combating this embrittlement problem is to add ele-
ments such as titanium, hafnium, zirconium, and niobium that promote the
formation of finely dispersed MC type carbides [38]. These carbides pro-
duce numerous interfaces that trap the helium rather than allowing it to
be swept into the grain boundaries. Typical compositions of modified
alloys are given in Table 7.1.

411 of the carbide-forming elements are beneficial in improving the
fracture strain, but there are several practical reasons why titanium and
nicbium are more desirable. Zirconium has been found to cause weld metal
cracking in concentrations as small as 0.05% [39] and for this reason,
would be a very undesirable alloying addition. Hafonium causes weld metal
cracking at concentrations of about 0.7%, but the greatest problem with

 

 

 

 

 
wo

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

205

using this element is its very high chemical reactivity. In small labo-
ratory melts in which the metal only comes in contact with a water-cocled
copper mold, the hafnium is present as desirable finely dispersed carbides.
In commercial melting practices where the melt is contacted with a re-
fractory crucible, the hafnium present is primarily a coarse compound.
This likely occurs because hafnium is chemically reactive enough to reduce
the oxides and other compounds in the refractory crucible. These coarse
compounds do not result in good mechanical properties after irradiation.
We have found that niobium additions alone do not result in improved re-
sistance to irradiation embrittlement, but they are beneficial when ti-
tanium is present [38]. However, both niobium and titanium form brittle
Nig (Ti,Nb) compounds and their total concentration must be limited.

Since titanium seems to be the most effective single additive in im-
proving the resistance to irradiation, we have concentrated on alloys

with about 2% titanium.

The amount of titanium required for good resistance to neutron ir-
radiation depends strongly upon the service temperature [38]. At 1200°F
alloys with 0.5% titanium have fracture strains of above 47%, but at an
irradiation temperature of 1400°F, 2% titanium is required to obtain the
same properties. Direct transmission electron microscope observations
have shown that this is due to the fine carbide becoming less stable and
more titanium being necessary for stabilization as the service tempera-
ture is increased.

Several 100-1b commercial melts containing 1.5 to 2.17% titanium
were procured from three vendors and evaluated. The unirradiated mechan-
ical properties and weldability of the melts are superior to those of
standard Hastelloy N. The compatibility of titanium~containing alloys
with fuel salt has been investigated using specimens of modified alloys
in natural circulation loops, and some specimens were exposed in the
MSRE core. Although the titanium is reactive with the salt, it diffuses
less rapidly than the chromium and does not contribute detectably to the
corrosion rate [40]. Hastelloy N modified by the addition of about 2%
titanium has thus been found to be adequately resistant to radiation at
1400°F, to be weldable without unusual difficulty, and to be free of
added corrosion problems. This alloy must be scaled-up, but the chem-
ical composition does not appear to be one that will present problems.

Exploratory irradiation studies have shown that Inconel 600 and all
other nickel-base alloys are embrittled at elevated temperatures by
thermal neutron irradiation [18, 19, 21, 22, 28-30]. The fracture strains
vary for different alloys, irradiation, and test conditions. However,
the fracture strains will likely be toc low for alloys such as Inconel
600 without closer controls on chemistry, grain size, and other factors.

The stainless steels are also embrittled by irradiation, but it is
possible that the fracture strains under MSBR service conditions will be
adequate [41]. If not, significant improvements have been made in types
304 and 316 stainless steel by controlling the grain size or altering the
composition (such as adding small amounts of Ti) [42].
 

206
wi
Intergranular Cracking
As already noted, ‘intergranular cracking was observed in the sur- wi
veillance samples and several components from the MSRE [17]. The most
significant characteristics of the cracks are:
1. Cracks were formed on all surfaces exposed to fuel salt. a
2. Irradiation of the metal did not seem to be a factor, since the cracks
were equally severe in components that were irradiated and unirra- Gi

diated.

3. Some cracks were visible in polished sections from some components
(particularly the heat exchanger) when they were removed from
service, but deformation at ambient temperature was required to
make most show up.

4, The material removed from the MSRE had been heated and exposed to
fission products for times ranging from 2500 to 25,000 hr. Although
the frequency of cracks increased with time, the maximum depth did a
not increase detectably.

We have not been able to produce similar intergranular cracks by
corrosion. To determine if corrosion could be the cause, the salt in
one fuel-salt loop was made quite oxidizing by adding FeF,. Selective
intergranular attack occurred, but the attack was very shallow and the EE
corroded grain boundaries did not open further during straining. The
second, and most convincing evidence that corrosion (chromium depletion)
did not cause the cracks came directly from examination of MSRE samples.
Although chromium depletion could not be detected in samples from the
heat exchanger and in a section of the control rod thimble that was under
a spacer sleeve, these samples were cracked as severely as those (e.g.,
the bare control red thimble) in which chromium depletion was detectable.
Thus, it seems unlikely that chromium depletion alone can account for the
observed cracking.

The next possible mechanism to be considered is that one or several a
elements diffused into the material preferentially along the grain
boundaries and degraded them in some way. The process responsible for
the cracking could be (1) the formation of a compound that is very a
brittle, (2) formation of low-melting phases along the grain boundaries
that become liquid at operating temperature, or (3) a change in compo-
sition along the grain boundaries so that they are still solid but very
weak. The first and third mechanisms would require some deformation to
form the cracks, but the second mechanism would not require strain, and
samples could have cracks present before postoperation deformation.

Clearly, it is extremely important that the elements responsible i
for the cracking be identified and that the mechanism be determined. Ana-
lytical data from materials from the MSRE show that all of the fission
products with sufficient half-lives to be detectable after two years were »

 
 

pe]

 

 

207

present in the metal at depths up to a few mils and some nuclides with
half-lives too short to detect could have alsc been present,

One sample was oxidized to passivate the outer surface to the reagent
and then strained so that only the cracks were leached. Several fission
products plus sulfur and phosphorus were present in high concentrations.
Thus, it seemed profitable to look at all of the elements in the fission
spectrum with sufficient half-lives to diffuse into the metal.

Our first attempt at this is shown in Table 7.2, which contains the
information that we feel to be most relevant. Some of the data are from
our current research, and others were obtained from the literature [43,
447,

As shown in Table 7.2, sulfur and selenium had detrimental effects
under some test conditions, but tellurium had a more pronounced effect
in all types of tests run to date. These three elements form relatively
unstable fluorides and would likely be deposited on the metal and graphite
surfaces. Arsenic, antimony, and tin also would be deposited, but no
deleterious effects of these elements on the mechanical properties of
nickel alloys have been noted. Zinc and cadmium may either be deposited
or present in the salt, depending on the oxidation state of the salt.
Both of these elements are reported to be insoluble in nickel, and we
have not observed any deleterious effects in cur tests. Ruthenium, tech-
netium, molybdenum, and rhodium should deposit on surfaces, but we have
seen no deletericus effects from them in cur tests. Zirconium, strontium,
cesium, and cerium form very stable fluorides and should remain in the
salt. We have noc evidence, positive or negative, on the effects of stron-
tium and cesium on the mechanical behavior, but presently believe that
these elements will stay in the salt and not enter the metal; zirconium
and cerium do not have adverse effects when added to Hastelloy N. Niobium
can be either in the salt or deposited, depending on the oxidation state,
but as mentioned in discussing irradiation behavior, it has favorable
effects on the mechanical properties.

Thus, although some exploratory work remains, it appears that the
cracking could be caused by the inward diffusion of elements of the
sulfur, selenium, tellurium family with tellurium having the most adverse
effect. Our studies consequently have concentrated on tellurium. Since
these elements all behave similarly, an understanding of how tellurium
causes cracking should lead to an understanding of the behavior of the
other elements.

Numerous laboratory experiments have been run that demonstrate very
clearly that small amounts of tellurium will cause intergranular cracking
in Hastelloy N. These experiments include: (1) the measurement of grain
boundary and bulk diffusion coefficients of tellurium in Hastelloy N,
type 304 stainless steel, and nickel; (2) exposure of numerous materials
to electro— or vapor-plated tellurium with subsequent straining and
metallographic examination; (3) tube burst specimens of Hastelloy N and
type 304 stainless steel electroplated with tellurium and stressed in
salt; (4) creep tests of Hastelloy N, type 304 stainless steel, nickel,
and Inconel 600 in inert gas-tellurium vapor environments; (5) strain
cycle experiments of Hastelloy N electroplated with tellurium to deter-
mine crack propagation rates; and (6) mechanical property tests on alloys
containing small amounts of fission product.

The diffusion rate of tellurium into Hastelloy N was measured.
Samples with 127Te deposited on the surface were annealed for 3000 hr
at 650 and 760°C. At 650°C the penetration was so shallow that the
lapping technique used did not give very reliable values, but accurate
results were obtained at 760°C and the diffusion coefficient in the bulk
material was 1.01 x 101% cm? /sec, about equivalent to that of chromium
at 650°C. The penetration profiles also were used tec obtain the product
of the grain boundary width and the grain boundary diffusion coefficient,
and the measured quantities were then used with the Fisher model [45] to
compute the grain boundary penetration. As shown in Fig. 7.1, the max-
imum penetration of tellurium in an MSBR at 760°C would be 8 mils in 30
years. The less accurate experimental values obtained at 650°C were used
to estimate that tellurium should have penetrated the grain boundaries
in the MSRE to a depth of 2 to 3 mils, and the penetration of an MSBR
operating at 650°C for 30 yr should be about 4 mils. The relatively low
sensitivity of the penetration depth to the time is due to the variation
with time to the one-fourth power for grain boundary diffusion compared
with the one-half power for bulk diffusion.

These computed depths of penetration are quite acceptable, but sev-
eral factors can move the curves. One factor that could reduce the pene-
tration is that the supply of tellurium to the Hastelloy N would control
the rate of penetration rather than diffusion through the metal. This is
quite possible, since the concentration of tellurium in the salt would
be very low, and other fission products such as molybdenum would deposit
and possibly interfere with tellurium actually reaching the Hastelloy N.
At least one factor could increase the penetration. Cracks could form
and the diffusion front move inward, such as probably occurred in the
specimen that was exposed to tellurium while being stressed in a creep
machine. Another factor could move the profiles either way; compounds
such as nickel-tellurides may form along the grain boundaries, and the
tellurium may diffuse at higher or lower rates through these compounds
than through Hastelloy N. Thus, although the diffusion measurements
provide an explanation of the limited penetration in the MSRE and offer
some encouragement that the depth of penetration of tellurium would not
be very great in an MSBR, they cannot be taken quantitatively.

Little is known about the chemistry of tellurium, but most likely
it is similar to that of sulfur. The basic problem with nickel alloys
containing sulfur is due to a low melting nickel-sulfur eutectic that
forms when sulfur segregates in the grain boundaries and causes these
regions to be weak compared with the matrix. Alloying additions such as
chromium raise the melting point of the eutectic and reduce the magnitude
of the problem. Some proprietary work on superalloys shows that about
167% chromium is required to make a superalloy resist embrittlement by
sulfur. Assuming parallel behavior of tellurium, its deleterious effects
on Hastelloy N might be offset by the addition of chromium.

Additions of tellurium, selenium, and sulfur are often made to steels
to obtain improved machinability but they cause embrittlement at high
temperatures. Small cerium additions have been effective in reducing the
embrittlement. Thus cerium additions to Hastelloy N may also be effective
in making the tellurium innocuous.
210

Fortunately, tellurium probably behaves in non-fissioning melts much
as it does in a fissioning salt, so that laboratory experiments can be
used to answer many questions. Assuming this is so, over sixty alloys

were electroplated with tellurium and annealed for long periods of time to

investigate the effects of composition, including higher chromium concen-
tration, on the cracking phenomenon. Included were several nickel-base
alloys, representative alloys of types 200, 300, 400, and 500 stainless
steel, nickel, copper, iron, Monel, two cobalt-base alloys, and several
heats of modified and standard Hastelloy N. After being annealed, the

samples were strained at room temperature and sectioned for metallographic

examination.

No cracks formed in irom, copper, Monel, the stainless steels, or
in the nickel-base alloys containing more than 15% chromium. However,
cracks did form in Hastelloy B (1% chromium maximum), Hastelloy W (5%
chromium), and in most heats of Hastelloy N (7% chromium). Some of the
heats of modified Hastelloy N had better resistance to cracking than
standard Hastelloy N. These alloys contained several additions, but the
only addition common to the improved heats was 27 nicbium, and the two
alloys that contained 2% niobium were completely free of cracks. Typical
photomicrographs of several alloys after exposure to tellurium and defor-
mation at room temperature are shown in Fig. 7.3.

A similar type of experiment was run in which test samples were
exposed to small amounts of tellurium vapor. These experiments were run
in quartz, which is nonreactive with the materials, and included vacuum
outgasing and bakeout. Thus, the oxygen levels were low and the condi-
tions should represer’ those that would be expected in a reducing salt.
Several materials have been exposed under these conditions and strained
to failure. The results obtained thus far generally agree with those
obtained in the experiments where the tellurium was electroplated on the
test sample. Hastelloy N formed intergranular cracks, but the intensity
of cracking varied with composition. Nickel formed some intergranular
cracks. Type 304 stainless steel did not crack. Inconel 600 had not
cracked in the plating experiments but did form shallow intergranular
cracks in the vapor experiments. Assuming that 16% chromium is required
for protection against tellurium embrittlement as it is against sulfur,
the 15% chromium in Inconel 600 should be marginal in preventing embrit-
tlement. Thus, the different behavior in the two types of experiments
may be a result of the experimental techniques or something more nebulous
such as small chemical variations in the two heats of material involved.

These limited observations indicate that many materials are more
resistant than Hastelloy N to intergranular cracking by tellurium, with
most showing no deleterious effects. Among those unaffected in the
tests, as noted, were nickel-base alloys containing 20% or more chromium,
stainless steels, copper, and Monel. The results on Inconel 600 (15%

chromium) were inconclusive. The tests of the modified heats of Hastelloy

N offered some encouragement that this alloy can be made resistant by
compositional changes. These results suggest that there may be several
materials whose use would avoid the cracking problem.

Influence of Material Uncertainties

The preceding discussion indicates that the metal to be used for
fabrication of an MSBR must satisfy three main requirements: (1) com-
patibility with the working fluids (fuel salt, coolant salt, steam),

(2) adequate plasticity after neutron irradiation, and (3) resistance to
intergranular cracking by fission products. A single material need not
satisfy all of these, since all parts of the system do not have the same

requirements. However, the use of dissimilar materials introduces com- Ee
plexity of design, so the possibilities for making the system of one

material need to be considered.

Several of the materials that we presently view as being reasonable si
choices are listed in Table 7.3. The first shown, a modified Hastelloy
N, is highly preferred but its use, of course, depends upon being able to
alter the composition to stop the intergranular cracking. Whether Hastel-
loy N can be used in the steam generator will depend upon its compati-
bility with steam, which, as discussed more fully in Chapter 8, is still
subject to question. The peak temperature with the materials used in
selection 1 would likely be 1300°F. Gi

Our second choice would be to use type 304 stainless steel in the
primary circuit because it appears to have excellent resistance to damage
by tellurium. The addition of about 0.2% Ti to this material has already
been shown to be an adequate solution to the problem of irradiation em~
brittlement. The main question regarding type 304 stainless steel con-
cerns its corrosion in fuel salt, and the outlet fuel temperature in the
reactor might have to be reduced to lower the corrosion rate. Stainless
steel will likely not have adequate corrosion resistance in the coolant
salt, and a tramsition to Hastelloy RK would be made in the intermediate
heat exchanger. This would require a duplex tube of type 304 stainless a
steel on the inside and Hastelloy NK on the outside.

Our third choice at this time would be a system made entirely of a
nickel-high chromium alloy. The available corrosion data on Inconel 600 io
(15% chromium) suggest that such a system would have an acceptable cor-
rosion rate with fuel salt at about 1200°F. However, these data were
obtained a number of years ago on relatively impure salts, and additional
corrosion testing will be required. Inconel 600 has not been tested ws
under controlled additions in sodium fluoroborate, but our present under-
standing of the chemical behavior of this salt gives reasonable hope of
acceptable compatibility. This alloy has been used in many steam gen- be
erators and the experience has been favorable. The main problem with
Inconel 600 is embrittlement by neutron irradiation. We have been able
to improve the resistance of Hastelloy N and types 304 and 316 stainless
steel by controlling variasbles such as grain size, heat treatment, and
composition, but this ability must be demonstrated for a nickel-high
chromium alloy.

The fourth materials selection would involve the use of the partially i
developed 2% Ti-modified Hastelloy N in the entire system with the surfaces
exposed to fuel salt being covered (weld overlay, duplex tubing, cladding)
by stainless steel or Monel. This would require that the details of the os
cladding processes be developed to include joining and to insure integ-
rity during service.

“Any of these selections could utilize a duplex tube with nickel on the coolant-salt side and Incoloy 800 on the steam side.
214

Several of these selections involve duplex tubing and clad struc-
tures. Methods for making duplex tubing and techniques for weld over-
laying generally exist for the materials involved. The greatest compli- a
cation comes about in joining, where, although the basic ability to make
such joints is available, joint designs and welding procedures must be
developed for each material.

One further method that has been considered for handling the crack-
ing problem is to getter the fission product tellurium from the salt with
some reactive material. The amount of tellurium produced is quite small,
and a very efficient filter would be required. To be effective, this Ed
filter would have to be placed near the reactor outlet, and the pressure
drop, heat generation rate, and salt holdup associated with it would likely
be very high. Thus, we have devoted only limited attention to this ap- i

proach.
Our preferences in Table 7.3 clearly favor staying with Hastelloy N
as a structural material. Its resistance toc corrosion by fluoride salts
a

has been well demonstrated, and irradiation embrittlement appears to be
taken care of adequately by the addition of titanium. Consequently, a
change to another material should be made only if it becomes clear that
Hastelloy N cannot be further modified to improve its resistance to inter- sa
granular cracking. In the event that a change of materials is necessary,
nickel~base alloys appear preferable te iron-base alloys because the salt
can be allowed to be more oxidizing with nickel. However, the studies
thus far indicate that the iron-base alloys offer more resistance tc in-
tergranular cracking. Thus, these two factors must be balanced against
each other in cheosing a material, and this will be possible only when

 

more data are available on the resistance of different alloys to cracking w=
and their corrosion resistance in salt.

Further Work

The most pressing problem with Hastelloy N is its susceptibility to
grain boundary cracking when exposed to fission products in fuel salts.
Work in the immediate future will concentrate on determining whether ac-
ceptable chemical modifications tc Hastelloy N will adequately improve gi
its resistance tc cracking. Experiments already run indicate that the
addition of 2% nicbium may be effective, and Hastelloys containing more
than 167% chromium are not attacked. Modifications of Hastelloy N con-
taining various concentrations of chromium, iron, manganese, silicon,
titanium, and cerium will be annealed in the presence of tellurium, and
evaluated for crack susceptibility. If an alloy near the Hastelloy KN
composition can be shown to be immune to tellurium, it must then be ir-
radiated to determine whether it has adequate ductility in the irradiated
condition, and tests in salt must be run to determine the operating tem-
perature limitations imposed by corrosion. Further work to develop the
irradiation resistant microstructure in the modified alloy will be re-
guired if the modification has altered its resistance to radiation.

In addition to working on Hastelloy N, we will evaluate a nickel-
high chromium alloy. Inconel 600 (with 15% chromium} seems to be border-
line in its tendency to form intergranular cracks, and an alley with asbout

215

207% chromium will likely be required to resist cracking. If experiments
show that this is the case, the main uncertainties will become the duc-
tility of the material in the irradiated condition and the maximum oper-
ating temperature at which the cecrrosion rate is tolerable. Sample
materials of several high-chromium commercial alloys such as Hastelloy X,
Hastelloy C, and Incocloy 800 will be included in our experiments to de-
termine whether they resist cracking under very stringent test conditions.
The alloys that are resistant to cracking will be irradiated and their
postirradiation creep properties determined to evaluate the magnitude of
the irradiation embrittlement problem.

The carbides in Incoloy 800 are basically Cr,3Cg (such as occurs in
stainless steels) and it is quite likely that close contrel of the ti-
tanium, nitrogen, and carbon concentrations will result in adequate re-
sistance to irradiation embrittlement [42]. The carbides in Hastelloys
X and C are molybdenum-base just as those in Hastelloy N. Thus, we have
experience with both types of carbides in these alloys and can likely
modify the microstructure to obtain improved resistance to irradiation
embrittlement if necessary.

The initial corrosion experiments will involve thermal convection
loops made of two representative alloys to determine whether such high
chromium levels can be tolerated at a reasonable operating temperature.
If these results are favorable, a pumped loop will be put in operation
to investigate corrosion at higher fluid velocities.

Although all stainless steels examined resist intergranular cracking
by tellurium, type 304 stainless steel would likely be our choice among
them because of its metallurgical simplicity and extensive industrial
production and use. This alloy seems to have adequate resistance to em-
brittlement by thermal neutron fluences of the magnitude that we will
encounter. The key factor, therefore, is whether it possesses adequate
corrosion resistance at a reasonable operating temperature. Two stain-
less steel thermal convection loops are currently in operation and the
next step will be to start a forced convection lcop.

Because of the importance of the intergranular cracking problem,
simultaneous programs should be carried out on all three types of mate-
rials that have been discussed. Materials will be dropped and others
added as experimental findings warrant.

The materials that appear acceptable from the standpoints of corro-
sion, irradiation embrittlement, and resistance to tellurium must be
subjected to some in-reactor testing. We are reasonably confident that
tellurium is the element causing the cracking and that its chemical be-
havior will be equivalent in in-reactor and cut-of-reactor tests. How-
ever, some verification of this will be required. The first step will
be static capsule tests and a capsule experiment is being designed for
the ORR in which standard Hastelloy N and alloys that are expected to be
resistant to tellurium will be exposed te fissioning salt under identical
conditions. Later tests should involve stressed samples. We presently
feel that more sophisticated in-reactor tests that simultaneously demon-
strate all of the conditions to be encountered in a reactor, including
heat transfer and forced-convection flow, are not necessary, but this

.will have to be re-evaluated as the program. progresses.
216

Following the path that has been outlined, we should be able to make
a conclusive choice of materials within about two years. However, many
of the confirmation tests will have to operate beyond this time. Addi- a
tional effort will be needed if a duplex system is required, since methods
must be developed for making dissimilar joints, duplex tubing, and weld
overlays.

Evaluation

The basic requirements of a structural material are that it be com-
patible with its environments, have acceptable mechanical properties both wi
unirradiated and after exposure to the maximum expected neutron fluence,
and be capable of being fabricated with reasonable ease. Two compati-
bility problems exist, one being the selective removal of chromium and
the other being intergranular cracking due to the infusion of fission
products (likely tellurium).

Our experience with Hastelloy N has been very favorable so far as
corrosion is concerned. Chemical modifications have made the irradiation ww
embrittlement tolerable, and there is reasonable evidence that further
chemical modifications can be made to control the intergranular cracking.

The development of a suitable modification of Hastelloy N that can be Fe
safely used with fissioning fuel salt should be the central thrust of the
materials development program.

Nickel-high chromium alloys appear to resist intergranular cracking
by tellurium, but the extent of their irradiation embrittlement must be
evaluated by experiments, and their corrosion behavior must be studied
in more detail. Previous tests with relatively impure salts and consider-
ation of chromium diffusion rates in the metal indicate that the peak =
operating temperature for Inconel 600 (15% chromium) would be about 1200°F.
It will be necessary first to determine the minimum chromium concentra-
tion required to prevent intergranular cracking, and then the question of
irradiation embrittlement and corrosion must be evaluated.

Type 304 stainless steel offers excellent resistance to intergran-—
ular cracking by tellurium and has acceptable resistance to embrittlement
by neutron irradiation, but its corrosion resistance must be evaluated
more completely and very likely it will not be usable above 1200°F.

Other materials such as Monel and copper resist cracking by tellu-
rium and can possibly be used as coatings in the primary circuit. How- a
ever, considerable development work would be required to follow this
route.

Cur work thus shows that there may be several materials that will
satisfy the basic requirements for MSBR piping and vessels. However,
some further investigation will be necessary before choosing the most
desirable option.

Tellurium does not form a very stable fluoride in MSBR fuel salt, a
so it deposits on metal surfaces in the reactor leading to the intergran-
ular cracking that we have observed. Since this process involves the
interaction of the two metals, it should not differ in a nuclear environ- ws
ment and a laboratory experiment. This means that most of the experimental
2]

work can be conducted in the laboratory, with only limited in-reactor
work being required for confirmation. Consequently, we envision that
this testing program can continue to move ahead rapidly, and expect that
an acceptable remedy can be demonstrated convincingly in about two years,
although more extensive tests of a confirmative nature will require a
longer time.

The purpose of this chapter is to describe the present status of the
technology of components and systems for molten-salt reactors, to indicate
the importance of the uncertainties remaining, to identify the additional
work needed, and to evaluate the probability of success in obtaining re-
liable components and systems. Except for the control and safety rods,
the reactor vessel and internals are not covered in this chapter; these
are discussed in Chapters 3 and 6. The problems related to the chemistry
of the salts and the materials of construction are discussed briefly only
where the mechanical design or operation of the plant is affected. Other-
wise the reader should refer to the respective chapters (5, 6, and 7) for
more details.

In preparing this status report, we used the reference design for
the MSBR [1] to determine the requirements for the components and systems,
examined the various conceptual designs of the components proposed in the
reference design and in the studies prepared by Ebasco Services [2-4],
Foster Wheeler [5], McWherter [6], and Bettis et al. [7] to determine
the possible difficulties. We then reexamined the prior experience to
establish the status of the various technologies and to determine the
work needed to resolve the uncertainties. As outlined in Chapter 2, this
prior experience began during the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) Pro-
gram, and progressed through the development work associated with design,
construction, and successful operation of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment,
and subsequent development for a larger aircraft reactor. This experience
served as a basis for and carried over into the development studies con-
ducted in support of the design, construction, and successful operation
of the MSRE and subsequently in support of the conceptual design studies
of the MSBR. Operation of the MSRE for more than 13,000 equivalent full-
power hours provided most of the experience related to nuclear operation.
Although not all the uncertainties related to fission product distribution
uncovered during the MSRE operation have been resolved, the components
and systems operated about as expected and provide confidence in these
areas of molten-salt technology.

Presently we are constructing two MSRE-scale facilities for the study
of the problems associated with the handling and circulation of molten
salts and the operation of auxiliary components in large loops. The
Coolant Salt Technology Facility (CSTF) is nearing completion and should
begin operation circulating NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %) in late summer 1972.
The Gas System Technology Facility (GSTF) should begin operation in the
summer of 1973. The GSTF will circulate molten LiF-BeF,-ThF,~-UF, (71.7-
16-12-0.3 mole %) and will provide a means for testing the operation of
the gas handling system and other components with a typical MSBR fuel
salt. We expect that the operation of these facilities over the next two
years should resolve many of the remaining uncertainties in the gas han-
dling and the coolant salt technology.

The discussions which follow provide an evaluation of the technology
without much detail, but the references cited contain the material needed
to substantiate the existence and status of the technology.

Salt Pumps

Requirements and Criteria

 

The pumps for molten-salt breeder reactors must circulate fluoride
salts in primary (fuel) and secondary (coolant) salt systems reliably at
temperatures approaching 1300°F and meet the general hydraulic require-
ments presented in Table 8.1. The table presents the design temperature
and the hydraulic characteristics of the salt pumps for the primary and
secondary salt systems for a 1000-Md(e) MSBR, a 200-MW(t) Molten-Salt
Breeder Experiment (MSBE), and the MSRE. Other criteria for MSBR salt
pumps are presented in condensed form in Table 8.2. Inert gas has been
circulated by salt pumps to aid in preheating and cooling down MSRE and
test facility salt systems, and the need for this pump capability may
persist for MSBR's also.

Salt Pump Concepts

     

Electromagnetic and centrifugal pumps have been considered for ap-
plication to salt systems. The low electrical conductivity of molten
fluoride salts hinders the application of electromagnetic pumps, and,
consequently, they are not used in fluoride salt systems. In contrast,
centrifugal pumps have been applied very satisfactorily to fluoride salt
systems. A study [8] of the problems of applying the canned-rotor motor
and the short-shaft and long-shaft configurations of the centrifugal pump
to molten-salt service was made in 1967. The canned-rotor pump was con-
cluded to be a very desirable configuration, since there are no orienta-
tion or elevation limitations on its application. However, it would
require difficult and expensive development tc provide pumps for an MSBR
application including the development of a high-temperature electric motor
with an electrical insulation system that alsc has a very high resistance
to nuclear radiation damage. Thus our efforts are centered on sump pumps,
and all pumps built or proposed for MSBR's are centrifugal sump pumps.
This pump can be considered to have two basic configurations that are
differentiated by shaft length and type of shaft support bearings. All
the salt pumps built for test facility and reactor operation at ORNL
have been of the short-shaft configuration described immediately below.
The Byron Jackson Pump Division of Borg-Warner, one of the participants
in an industrial group studying molten-salt reactors, prefers the long
shaft configuration for MSBR salt systems; this configuration is described
very briefly below alsc.

Short-Shaft Pump. — A conceptual drawing of a short shaft centrifugal
pump is shown in Fig. 8.1. It is the pump for the primary salt system in
the reference design for a single fluid MSBR [9]. Except for its large ws
capacity, this pump is very similar to those used in 1954 in the ARE,
those proposed for the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART) in the late 1950's
[10], and those operated for over 20,000 hours in the MSRE in the 1960's
[11]. It consists of three principal parts: the rotary element, the
pump tank and the driver. The rotary element contains the conventional,
oil-lubricated bearings that support the short shaft from which the
impeller is overhung and also the shaft seals that hold the pump bearing EE
and seal lubricant-coolant in the bearing housing. The pump tank incor-
porates the pump casing {volute}, the necessary nozzles for the inlet and
discharge of pumped salt and inert cover gas, and the mounting brackets;
the tank would be welded permanently into the salt system in an MSBR.
The pump driver is presently considered to be a three-phase induction
(squirrel cage) electric motor installed in a water-cooled vessel. The
rotary element, pump tank, and drive motor are assembled with gasketed ws
joints to form a gas-tight unit; the gasketed joints are connected to a
leak~detector system for nuclear reactor application.

Long—-Shaft Pump. — A conceptual drawing of a long-shaft centrifugal

  

pump is shown in Fig. 8.2. It was considered for the reference two-fluid »
MSBR [12] and is similar in overall features to that preferred by Byrom
Jackson [13, 14]. The principal configurational feature that distinguishes
this concept from a short-shaft pump is the long shaft supported at its
lower end by a molten-salt lubricated bearing. Because this pump con- ws
figuration was considerably outside our experience, we had the rotor
dynamics of the shaft-bearing-housing system and the characteristics of
molten-salt lubricated bearings examined in some detail by Mechanical wi
Technology Incorporated. The results of the study were reported in [15]
and summarized in [16]. The pump shaft length and design speed for the
pump should be selected to operate safely below the first shaft critical
speed if at all practicable. If this cannot be done, then a practical
means of performing precise dynamic balancing of long pump shafts must be
developed. Consideration should also be given to constructing a rotor-
dynamic simulation facility of the shaft-bearing system to evaluate the i
effectiveness of the dynamic balancing procedures, the bearing performance,
and the rotor-bearing system stability.

The long-shaft pump is suitable for reactor salt systems that require
locating the impeller at relatively low elevations in the system layout.
It is suitable for circulating gas only at temperatures above the salt
melting point, and then only if special provisions are made to supply
molten-~salt lubricant to the lower bearing when the salt system is dry.
At about the time of the completion of the MTI study, the focus of MSBR
attention shifted from the two-fluid to the single-fluid systems, and no
more work was performed on the long-shaft pump. Ee

Pump Experience

Short=-Shaft Pump. — Numerous short-shaft centrifugal pumps for molten-
salt and liquid-metal applications have been designed, constructed, and
tested at ORNL, Table 8.3 is a résumé of these pumps giving design values
of pump head, capacity (flow) and speed, the number of units built for
each model, and the total operating time accumulated with each model of
pump. A very wide range is represented: capacities have ranged from
1 gpm to 1500 gpm; heads, from 530 to 400 ft; and design temperatures, be-
tween 1200 and 1500°F. Many pumps have been operated at 1500°F. Single
units that were operated continuously and satisfactorily include several
LFB pumps for periods of 15,000 to 20,000 hr and one MF pump for more
than 25,000 hr. More than 58,000 hr satisfactory operation was accumu-
lated with the MSRE salt pumps in the fuel- and coolant-salt systems in
the reactor. An MSRE prototype pump was operated for approximately 8000
hr with molten-salt. This was followed by 14,000 hr of operation of the
Mark-2 fuel salt pump which had a deeper pump tank and a slightly longer
shaft overhang for the impeller than the reactor pump. Thus a total of
more than 80,000-hr operation was accumulated with four MSRE salt pumps.

The models LFB through PKA pumps were designed to the requirements
of the 1950 versions of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code (ASME
BPV Code), Section VIII, supplemented with metallurgical data taken during
the ANP Program. The MSRE and ALPHA models of molten-salt pumps were
designed to the requirements of the 1960 versions of the ASME BPV Code,
Section VIII, as supplemented with low cycle fatigue data obtained during
the early portion of the MSRP and with thermal strain-fatigue analyses of
the pump tanks [17].

Several conclusions important to pump design were made and reaffirmed
as pump operating experience was accumulated. The short-shaft pump con-
figuration can be designed and built to operate satisfactorily in molten-
salt reactors and satisfactorily scaled up in size from 5 to 1500 gpm.
Pump performance characteristics obtained during water tests [18, pp. 11
and 13] of a centrifugal pump can be related reliably to the molten-salt
operation of that pump. Experience has pointed out the importance of
quality assurance in all the prime functions of design, materials pro-
curement, fabrication, assembly, test and inspection, installation, and
operation to the production of satisfactory salt pumps. Occasionally
during the scaling up of pumps to larger capacities, a principle pre-
viously applied may be overlooked with annoying consequence, such as the
location of the parting plane in the catch basin in the MSRE fuel- and
coolant-salt pumps. The catch basin is provided to catch the lubricating
oil that leaks past the lower shaft seal and thus prevents it from running
down into the molten salt in the pump tank. There are various design
approaches to providing the basin cavity, and prior to designing the MSRE
salt pumps, all cavities had a parting line which required a static seal
at an elevation considerably above the floor of the basin. In the MSRE
salt pumps this parting line was placed at the floor of the basin, and
during pump operation the two components joined at this line underwent
some relative displacement that opened the joint and permitted seal oil
leakage to run at a slow rate down into the molten salt in the pump tank.

The permanent fix, which required seal welding the edges of the joint,

was adopted only after nuclear operation of the MSRE and did not forestall
the concern and activity needed to handle the consequences of the oil that
leaked into the MSRE fuel-salt system.

Long—-Shaft Pump. — The principal results of the study of the rotor-
dynamic characteristics and molten-salt lubricated bearings for the long
shaft pump are presented above in the section entitled Salt Pump Concepts.
We had some experience with operating test bearings in molten salt in the
early 1960's, which is reported in [19]. Hydrodynamic lubrication with
molten salt in journal bearings was demonstrated over the temperature
range 1200-1500°F. A PKA model pump was modified [20, pp. 56-57] to
support the lower end of the shaft with a molten-salt lubricated bearing
and was operated for approximately 12,500 hr at 1225°F. Although all the
journals and sleeves in these test bearings were constructed of Hastelloy
N and were operated with some degree of satisfaction, it was decided on
metallurgical grounds that long term reliability required the application
of hard materials such as refractory metals and cemented carbides. A few.
material specimens, hard faced by the plasma spray method, were purchased.
Subsequent concentration on the pump requirements for the MSRE led to a
deemphasis of this effort, and the test program for the specimens was not
completed.

Industrial Experience and Interest. — Efforts were made to elicit
industrial interest in the production of salt pumps for the ARE, ART,
MSRE, and associated molten-salt test facilities. However, the quantity
of pumps to be produced at any one time in the two decades during which
these projects were viable was apparently too small to obtain and main-
tain serious industrial interest. In 1969 a specification [21] was written
for a short-shaft centrifugal pump to provide the requirements of the
primary and secondary salt systems in a 100- to 200-MW(t) MSBE, (see Table
8.1). Westinghouse Electro Mechanical Division, Bingham Pump Company,
and Byron Jackson Pump Company expressed interest in commenting on the
specification and receiving a request for proposal to produce the pumps.
Westinghouse produced a very good response to the request, the only one
received, but the deemphasis of the MSBE in 1970 obliged us to drop their
proposal. We have had no contact with the pump industry to produce salt
pumps of the long-shaft configuration.

Status of Pump Technology

 

The preceding picture of the status of the technology of salt pumps
supports the belief that satisfactory salt pumps of the short-shaft con-
figuration can be produced for MSBR's. What follows in this section tends
to emphasize problem areas, none of which should be insuperable for either
the short shaft or the long shaft pumps.
232

Scaling up Pump Capacity. - The principal considerations attendant to
scaling up pump capacity for both short and long shaft pumps are suctien
specific speed (S) and rotor dynamic characteristics and their effect on
pump design speed and impeller diameter.

Suction specific speed (S) affects the net positive suction head
(NPSH) required to suppress the inception of cavitation and subsequent
damage to the pump impeller and casing, and to avoid cavitation-induced wa
noise, reduced efficiency, and other deleterious effects. Lower, con-
servative values of S approaching 8500 require higher values of NPSH,
which in turn require a larger impeller diameter and stronger pump com- ”
ponents to contain the increased pressure of the working fluid. In some
salt systems this might also entail an increase in the wall thickness of
all the system components. Conversely, larger values of § approaching
14,000 reduce NPSH requirements and thus tend to permit the use of a
smaller impeller diameter and lighter and thinner pressure vessels. To
achieve the higher values of S, it is necessary to take advantage of
newly developed computer programs for pump design and tape controlled wa
machinery for fabrication. The computer programs calculate with much
precision the boundary surfaces needed in impeller and casing flow pas-
sages to achieve the required pump hydraulic performance. Tape controlled Ls
machinery can then produce these precise boundary surfaces in the flow
passage of pump impellers and casings in satisfactory fashion.

The rotor dynamic characteristics of pumps are determined primarily
by the designs of the shaft, the bearings and their support members, and
the mass of the impeller and the length of its overhang beyond the nearest
support bearing. In conjunction these items determine the principal
rotor dynamic criterion, the first flexural resonance frequency {critical i
frequency) of the shaft-bearings-impeller system. The rotor dynamic de-
signs of the short shaft salt pumps that have been operated at ORNL permit
operation of the pump at speeds safely below the critical frequency.
Studies of layouts for MSBE salt pumps indicate that subcritical operation
can be achieved with short shaft pumps for capacities at least up to
10,000 gpm. Larger capacities than this for both short and long shaft
pumps may require larger impeller diameters than consideration of suction
specific speed alone would yield. The principal recommendation of the
rotor dynamic design study for long shaft pumps indicated the need for
their operation at subcritical speeds also. &

 

 

Design. ~ A major design requirement is to recall to use those prin-
ciples proven during experience with previous salt pumps. Another major
design requirement is the removal of nuclear heat from surfaces of a pri-
mary salt pump that are not cocled naturally by flowing salt or lubricant.
During pump operation it should be practical to direct a small side stream
of salt to these surfaces to remove the heat. However, if the salt de-
posits fission products on these surfaces, then removing the fission
product decay heat when the salt pump is stopped becomes a problem. A i
multi-pump system can be designed so that the flow of cooling salt is
maintained by the remaining pumps when one pump stops, but when all pumps
in the primary salt system stop, it may be necessary to provide auxiliary
cooling independent of the salt flow.

Fabrication. — A continuing effort has been expended in developing
in-house fabrication expertise with and introducing segments of industry
to newer construction materials such as Inconel in the early 1950's and
Hastelloy N in the early 1960's. In the preduction of satisfactory Hastel-
loy N castings for impellers and casings for the MSRE salt pumps it was
necessary to take the best sand castings produced by the casting industry
and upgrade them at ORNL by identifying flaws with radiography and then
repairing the castings by grinding out the flaws and depositing weld metal
in the cavities until ‘a satisfactory metal structure was achieved. However,
for MSBR salt pumps, the prospect of making pump impellers and casings by
weld joining machined pieces appears to be an attractive alternative to
castings.

Long-Shaft Pump. — The principal problems for the long shaft pump,
we believe, are the design of molten-salt lubricated bearings and the
fabrication of long shafts to precise concentricity, straightness and
dynamic balancing requirements.

The MII study [14] indicated a preference for the self-acting pivoted
pad bearing for this pump configuration and also recommended a rather
extensive bearing design and materials program. Mechanical devices must
be provided te accommodate the relatively large differential thermal
expansion that occurs between the shaft and bearing support constructed
of Hastelloy N and the journals and sleeves constructed of refractory
metals or cemented carbides having much smaller coefficients of thermal
expansion. MII recommended an extensive series of bench and evaluation
tests to select the most promising bearing materials compatible with a
particular molten salt followed by proof tests in molten salt of full-
size bearings constructed of these materials.

Precision shafts of lengths approaching 30 ft and diameters of 7 to
10 in. must be fabricated to provide a good starting point for the pre-
cision dynamic balancing of the machined shaft. The principal idea is
to produce a shaft having dynamic characteristics that are compatible
with the film strength and stability characteristics of its molten-salt
lubricated support bearing.

Potential Improvements. - Improvement in variable speed control of
pumps appears to be a good area for advancing the technology of salt
pumps. In our experience, the squirrel-cage electric motor and a variable
frequency supply system are very satisfactory choices for a salt pump
drive system. Of the many variable frequency supply systems the completely
static "eycloconverter" (or '"diverter-inverter') system shows most promise
for improvement. It couples a wide range of speed control, as much as ten
to one, with the high reliability that one expects from a completely static
system, particularly after that system has received adequate development.

 

Industrial Involvement. - An intensive and widely based involvement
of the pump industry is necessary to the production of religble and eco-
nomic high-temperature pumps for the nuclear industry and should be very

 
234

beneficial to salt pump technology also. An iterative approach with se-
lected vendors should lead to simpler and, hopefully, less expensive pump
designs. It should also lead to lower pump construction costs as exper-— i
tise in identifying and resolving the design problems peculiar to nuclear
pumps is obtained and fabrication and assembly talents are sharpened.
Much of the industrial experience derived from the development of pumps
for LMFBR's can be expected to apply to pumps for MSBRs.

Effects of Uncertainties. - MSBR salt pumps have the usual turbo- er
machinery elements upon which are superimposed the requirements for op-
eration at temperatures in the range 1000 to 1300°F and in a nuclear
radiation environment, These latter requirements generate some problems
of heat removal and radiation damage that will require directed effort.
The larger diameter shafts for MSBR salt pumps will require larger shaft
seals having greater rubbing velocities than our experience has covered.

However, neither of these problems presents a genuine uncertainty that we
will bar the design and production of satisfactory short shaft pumps for
reference MSBR salt systems.

The MSBR designs call for short shaft pumps, but if long shaft pumps i
should be needed, the problems previously mentioned should yield to ade-
quate development effort. Confidence in their long term relisgbility will
require endurance test operation in molten sgt.

If satisfactory operation of the long shaft pump at supercritical
speeds is proven to be difficult to achieve, the design of the pump shaft
may be modified to increase its stiffness and raise the first flexural
resonance frequency of the shaft safely above the pump design speed. i
Alternatively, the hydraulic design may be modified to decrease pump
design speed satisfactorily below the critical frequency of the shaft.

 

Salt Pump Development Requirements

 

The principal features of the development requirements for ‘a short-

shaft salt pump include proof and endurance testing of the shaft seal,

a water performance test of the pump hydraulic design, and endurance

testing of a prototype pump with molten salt. In addition to these items, a
the long=-shaft salt pump will require a bearing materials development
program, a bearing and journal mounting methed program, a rotordynamic
simulation test program, and probably verification of the capability to
fabricate long pump shafts to precise concentricity, straightness, and
dynamic balancing requirements. Each production pump, whether short or
long shaft, should be subjected te a shakedown and molten-salt proof test
prior to installation into an MSBR salt system. .

The diameter and rubbing velocity of the shaft seal for an MSBR salt
pump are larger than any we have experienced. The manufacturer should
select the shaft seal design from among the bellows mount, fluid bearing, a
Visco seal, etec., and provide performance and endurance tests until a
satisfactory design is evolved. The proof test of shaft seals installed
in prototype and production salt pumps is performed as part of the shake-
down and molten-salt proof testing.
235

A test stand should be designed and constructed to perform a series
of tests with molten salt on the prototype pump that will verify its
performance and give confidence in its long term endurability. The pre-
liminary design of such a test stand suitable for MSBE salt pumps was com-
pleted [22, 23] in December 1969; it was estimated to cost $860,000 at

that time. A partial listing of important tests planned for the facility,
5 which are presented in references 22 and 24, includes:

1. Obtain the pump hydraulic performance and cavitation inception char-
i acteristics over a wide range of pump speeds and capacities and tem~
peratures.

. 2. Determine the start and coastdown characteristics of the pump and
= drive motor under load conditions.

3. Determine the characteristics of the purge gas flow in the shaft
a annulus.

4. Determine the distribution of salt aerosols produced by pump operation
Gi and obtain the performance characteristics of aerosol removal devices,
if necessary.

5. Demonstrate the operability of the incipient failure detection (IFD)
devices.

6. Obtain long term endurance operation with a prototypal pump.

7. Make molten-salt proof tests of advanced instrumentation for molten-
salt systems as it becomes available.

Evaluation
wd We know how to make relisble short-shaft centrifugal pumps for
molten-salt reactors, having built and operated many with capacities
to 1500 gpm. Although it may take several years to produce the larger
Eo pumps for demonstration of full-scale MSBR's, the problems are well under-
stood, and there is little question that satisfactory pumps can be ob-
tained on a schedule compatible with obtaining the other principal reactor
components.
We have had very little experience with the long-shaft pump configura-
tion for molten-salt systems. However, it has been used in sodium systems,
and plans are being processed for its use in the liquid-metal fast-breeder
a reactor program (LMFBR). The incentive to use long-shaft salt pumps is
to reduce the total development requirements for MSBR's and LMFBR's. In-
deed, the MSBR short-shaft pumps can benefit from the LMFBR sodium pump

Ge technology programs because the two pump configurations share many common
requirements. The advanced analytical design methods that are being de-
veloped for the sodium pumps should have much direct application to the

- design of molten-salt pumps. We expect that the results of the shaft

“= seal development program for sodium pumps will also have direct applica-
tion to salt pumps. The fabrication technology developed for large sodium

 
236

pumps should have application to the fabrication of components for MSBR
pumps after making some allowances for a probable difference in comnstruc-
tion materials. The thermal shock capability of the Sodium Pump Test a
Facility (SPTF} could be utilized to shock a prototype MSBR salt pump.

However, the requirements for sodium and salt pumps are also suffi-
ciently different that in other important respects they are unique. The
density of salt and sodium are quite far apart and for a given pump ca-
pacity and head, the power required to drive a salt pump and the pressure
developed would be several times the power and pressure for a sodium pump.
However, because of the higher volumetric heat capacities of the salt, es
the total pump power requirements are less for salt than sodium. The
design temperatures for the MSR's are 100°F or more above those for
the sodium reactor systems and therefore the salt pumps will have to be »
designed for slightly lower allowable stresses.

Obtaining materials for molten-salt lubricated bearings that would
be satisfactory for steady running conditions is not likely to be diffi-
cult. However, starting and stopping conditions become more severe as
the temperature is raised above 1200°F. Alsc, as pointed out above,
suitable devices would have to be developed (1) to attach salt-bearing
materials to retainer pieces having a greatly differing coefficient of i
thermal expansion and (2) to maintain alignment between journal and
bearing surfaces with other shaft support bearing at 1300°F.

Economy in design, production, operation, and maintenance favors the -

attempt to make the hydraulic and mechanical designs of pumps for both =
the primary- and secondarv-salt systems very similar, if not identical.
Coolant System
Description
Molten-salt breeder reactor systems require the circulation of an yr
wi

intermediate coolant (1) to provide a barrier for protecting the steam
system from fission products and for protecting the fuel system from
steam system pressures, (2) to transfer the nuclear heat from the fuel

salt to the water-steam system, and (3) to bridge the temperature gap a
between the fuel salt melting point and the steam system feed water

temperature.

A mixture of LiF-BeF; (66-34 mole %) was used successfully in the i
secondary system of the MSRE, but its high liquidus temperature (857°F)
and high cost ($600 to $1400/ft3) prompted a search for other possible
coolants. In this search, special consideration was given to inhibiting
the migration of tritium from the primary salt through the secondary
coolant to the steam system. At the same time the performance character-
istics of the coolants, the associated inventory costs, their compati-
bility with the fuel salt, steam, and the cell environment, and the i
materials required to contain the coolants were summarized for future
reference [25}. Three groups of coolants were considered: molten salts,
liquid metals, and gases at high or moderate pressure. Of the coolants
which were considered, there appeared to be no real incentive for a choice

pd
Shs

237

other than the eutectic NaBFy-NaF (92-8 mole Z) which has a melting point
of 725°F and costs approximately $60/ft3 ($0.5/1b). It appeared that it
might be possible to contain a small concentration of hydroxl ion in
complex in this coolant which could be continuously removed and replaced
to function as a trap for the tritium. Among its disadvantages are (1)
the need for BF3 in the cover gas because of the evolution of BF3 from
NaBF, at MSBR operating temperatures and (2) an affinity for water, which
causes increased corrosiveness in both the salt and cover gas systems.

As will be described below, these problems are not so severe as to affect
our choice of the fluorcborate mixture as the coolant in future MSR's.

A lower-melting-point fluoride mixture of LiF, NaF, and BeF, with a
liquidus temperature of 640°F, a mixture of LiCl and KCl with a liquidus
temperature of 680°F, and a mixture of KF and ZrF, with a liquidus tempera-
ture of 752°F appear to be alternatives. As mentioned in Chapter 2, some
consideration also has been given to a special design using both LiF-BeF;
and a nitrate-nitrite mixture between the fuel and the steam. Additional
information on coolant salts is given in Chapter 5.

The simplified schematic diagram in Fig. 8.3 shows one of four sec-
ondary salt circuits required to cool the reference design 1000 MW{e)
molten-salt breeder reactor. In each circuit sodium fluorcborate salt
flows from the outlet of a primary heat exchanger at 1150°F to the suction
of a sump-type centrifugal pump. Salt discharged by the pump flows in
parallel through several steam generator-superheater and steam-reheater
units and returns to the primary heat exchanger at 850°F. The flow
through each secondary circuit is 20,000 gpm and each circuit contains
2000 ft3 of sodium fluoroborate. The total amount required is “450 toms.
Valves are provided in the salt lines to control the distribution of flow
to the steam-raising units and to bypass coolant flow around the heat-
exchanger under partial load conditions. (These valves need only to
throttle, not to shut off flow.) A pressure-relief system is provided
for each secondary salt circuit whereby high pressure produced by rupture
of one cor more tubes in the steam-raising units is relieved by the burst-—
ing of rupture disks and rapid blowdown of salt, noncondensable gases,
and steam, A common cover-gas system is provided for the four circuits
which supplies a mixture of BF; and helium and possibly other gases to
the tank of each salt circulation pump to provide a protective atmosphere
over the free surface of the sodium fluoroborate, A purification system
is provided to maintain the purity of the salt in the secondary circuits.
As a minimum the purification system is expected to remove some corrosion
products by cold trapping and to convert oxides and hydroxides to fluo-
rides. The processing system may also remove HF from the salt by con-
tacting it with gas or by other means.

Experience with Coolant Salts

 

A LiF-BeF, mixture was circulated at 860 gpm in the secondary system
of the MSRE for approximately 26,000 hr over a temperature range of 1000
to 1200°F. During the lifetime of the MSRE (Vv4-1/2 yr) the chromium con-
tent of the salt remained constant at sbout 32 ppm, indicating remarkably
little corrosion. Metallographic examination of the piping after shutdown

substantiated this conclusion [26]. In the MSRE radiator, air at <100°F
was blown across tubes containing LiF-BeF, with an 857°F freezing peint
for about 15,000 hours with only one significant freezeup. (This occurred
early in power operation when the radiator doors failed to seal tightly
after the coolant pump power was interrupted and salt froze in most of
the tubes.) With the LiF-BeF, mixture there is little density change in
freezing, and the tube bundle was quickly thawed (using installed heaters)
without damage. Aside from the radiator, the only problem encountered
with the secondary system of the MSRE was occasional trouble with partial
restrictions in the off-gas lines due to oil vapor and salt mist carry-
over.

Sodium fluorcborate eutectic salt has been circulated for tens of
thousands of hours in natural- and forced-convection loops constructed
of Hastelloy N to obtain data on corrosion, mass transfer, and materials
compatibility problems. A tabulation of the operating parameters of these
six loops is presented in Table 8.4.

In addition, an MSRE-scale pumped loop (PKP-1) constructed of 44-inch
Inconel pipe was operated at 750 gpm of sodium flucroborate at 800 to
1000°F for over 11,000 hr to obtain experience with both the salt and the
BF;-helium cover gas required for salt composition control [27]. Much
useful information on the performance of sodium fluoroborate was obtained
with this loop, but its configuration was not suitable for ‘conducting the
additional experiments needed and the material of construction was atypi- A
cal of current and proposed molten-salt reactors, Therefore, an all
Hastelloy N loop (Coolant-Salt Technology Facility) was designed and con-
structed by using the pump and piping salvaged from the secondary system
of the MSRE.

There has been considerable industrial use of Hitec, a nitrate-nitrite
mixture, but compared toc LiF-BeF, and sodium flucroborate, there is rela-
tively little basic quantitative information on its high-temperature sta-
bility and corrosion. :

Status of Fluoroborate Coolant Technology

The compatibility of sodium fluorcborate with the proposed MSBR
container material (Hastelloy N) is satisfactory (corrosion rate of 0.1
to 0.2 mils per year) provided that moisture is excluded from the system.
Data from corrosion experiments show that addition of a small amount of
water to sodium fluorcborate salt in a Hastelloy N container at about
1100°F results in the metal corroding at a rate that is initially many
mils per month and that decreases gradually until} it becomes less than
0.3 mil/yr [28]. Until recently chemical analyses indicated that corro-
sion rates this low were obtained with salt containing more than 1000 ppm
of water and of oxide. This led to the suggestion that sodium fluorobo-
rate could contain water in two forms: one that is highly corrosive and
one that is only slightly corrosive to Hastelloy N. More recent intensive
study has revealed that the analytical results were in error. Salts that
were reported to contain more than 1000 ppm of water are now found te con-
tain small amounts of a hydroxyl compound (presumably sodium hydroxyfluo-
roborate) and to contain more than 1000 ppm of oxide.

Heat transfer data obtained with the forced-convection loop FCL-2
are in good agreement with the empirical correlation of Sieder and Tate.
These data indicate that sodium fluoroborate does perform as a typical
heat transfer fluid [29].

Since sodium fluoroborate exhibits an appreciable dissociation pres-
sure, BF3 is carried off in the off-gas stream from the pump bowl and if
not replaced will result in a salt composition shift toward a higher NaF
content. In this event, the time required te produce a change of 1 mole
percent in the salt composition in the reference 1000 MW MSBR is calecu-~
lated to be 30 days.

During operation of the PKP-1 loop, the BF; content of the pump off-
gas stream (as measured by a thermal conductivity cell} was found to be
in equilibrium with the salt composition in the pump bowl over a wide
range of BF3 and/or helium flow rates into the pump bowl vapor space,
and the NaBF, to NaF ratio in the salt was indeed controlled by the rate
at which BFy was admitted to the pump bowl. Also this ratio can be deter-
mined by relating the BF; content in the off-gas stream to the total pres-
sure and salt temperature in the pump. An analysis of the systematic
errors resulting from inferring the NaBF, to NaF ratio from the BFj3 con-
tent of the off-gas stream indicates that this method of detecting changes
in salt composition is accurate to *0.5 mole percent. Earlier experience
had shown the error to be an order of magnitude greater when the mole
fraction was inferred from stoichiometric ratios of the basic constituents
as determined from a number of chemical analyses of the salt.

Near equilibrium concentrations of BF3 in helium are required when
the mixed gas is used in a bubbler-type level indicator. The eutectic
salt mixture is depleted of its BF; content in the vicinity of the bubbler
tube when pure helium is injected below the salt surface. Eventual plug-
ging of the tube by the higher-melting NaF-rich salt mixture results; con-
versely, this type of plug can be cleared by a BF3—~rich gas mixture.

Higher than calculated overpressure was required to suppress pump
cavitation during circulation of the flush salt in the PKP-1 loop (the
first salt charge was used to clean the system of residual salt from pre-
vious operations). Cavitation data for the second batch of fluoroborate
salt correlated with that for other fluids.

A fine salt mist generated in the vapor space of the PKP pump agglom-
erated, solidified, and eventually plugged the off-gas line from this
pump. The line was cleared by the application of heat to the affected
areas with subsequent salt drainage to the pump. Fluorcborate salt mist
is a potential problem with the large pumps contemplated for use in future
molten-salt reactors, but the mist problem with fluoroborate does not ap-
pear to differ from that with other salts.

A bubbler-type level indicator was operated in the PXP pump for over
two years. Near the end of the test the tube showed signs of plugging.
Examination of the bubbler tube revealed that the end of the tube was
plugged with a silver-gray magnetic deposit rich in nickel content. It
is not clear as to the cause of the plug; some speculations are: (1)
moisture in the argon supply, (2) moisture in the BF3 supply, (3) impuri-
ties in the salt, and (4) high-corrosion rate of Inconel in sodium fluoro-
borate. The CSTF will use the float-type level indicator.
242

Although sodium fluoroborate undergoes a solid phase transition at
v470°F, no unusual problems associated with this phenomenon were en-
countered with the operation of the freeze valves used in the forced con-
vection or PKP loops. During the operation of the PKP loop, the freeze
valve was maintained between 200 and 400°F and was subjected to a total
of 16 fill-drain cycles.

Evidence of the corrosion product, NasCrFg, has been found in virtu-
ally all loops circulating sodium fluoroborate. The deposit is found in
the coldest part of the circuit and is expected to deposit on the tubes
of the steam-raising equipment if not removed by some means. Therefore,
the solubility of Na3CrFg in sodium fluoroborate was determined and cold
trapping techniques were used with limited success to isolate this mate-
rial in natural- and forced-circulation loops. Excessive drain times were
encountered that were attributed to the accumulation of the corrosion
product, NasCrFg, in drain lines. As a result of this experience, the
drain line temperatures of sodium fluoroborate loops should be maintained
at, or slightly higher than, the main loop temperature. Also, the freeze
valves should be located near the drain tank rather than near the main
loop. This configuration will lengthen the diffusion path between the
main loop and the cold spot in the drain line. In MSR's the concentration
of NajCrFg will be kept low to protect the steam generators heat transfer
surfaces from fouling.

The purge gas which enters the PKP pump shaft annulus splits into
two streams, the large fraction (0.9) flows down the shaft and into the
pump bowl vapor space; the remainder flows up the shaft, past the rotating
shaft seal, and through the oil catch tank. The shaft purge inhibits
back diffusion of noxious gases from the pump bowl to the seal region
and oil catch tank. The BF3 content of the lower seal purge stream was
maintained below 1000 ppm, and no deleterious operating experience was
encountered.

Uncertainties in Use of Fluoroborate

 

The major uncertainties in the use of sodium fluoroborate in an MSBR
are the following.

a. Will Na3CrFg deposition on steam-generator tubes be difficult to
control? A cold trap is a poor competitor in comparison to the steam
generator because (1) the steam tubes at the feedwater entrance will be
as cold as, if not colder than, the trap, (2) they will see full flow as
compared to fractional flow through the trap, and (3) the surface area of
the steam tubes will be much larger than that in the trap. For effective
corrosion product clean up, therefore, it appears that periodically the
steam tubes will have to be allowed to heat up so that the trapped corro-
sion product can be dissolved from the tubes into the circulating salt
and subsequently redeposited in the cold trap.

b. How serious will the consequences of a small steam leak into the
secondary salt be? A leak of 0.2 ml/min (7.3 Xx 107% 1b/sec) of steam
should be detectable by monitoring for HF in the cover gas. Although a
leak of this size would not be expected to grow rapidly, the concomitant
corrosion rate of 1 mil/yr is higher than desirable for such a small leak.
wa

 

243

A system of injecting hydrogen into the salt circulating system, removing
the bubbles by means of a centrifugal separator, and extracting the HF
from the off-gas could result in the accommodation of a water leak of 1
to 35 ml/min without serious corrosion [30].

c. How effectively can tritium be prevented from passing through the
coolant system into the steam? Possible chemical methods of blocking the
transport of tritium are discussed in Chapter 14. Removal from the coolant
salt is one possibility but it has not as yet been demonstrated.

Further Development Work

The Coolant-Salt Technology Facility (CSTF) will provide a supply of
flowing salt at temperatures and pressures typical of MSR operating con-
ditions to a number of experimental side loops, which will be used to
resolve the important points described below.

Cover Gas Addition to and Removal from the Pump Bowl. ~ Certain im-
purities, variously identified as water, hydroxy fluorcboric acid, BF3;-H,0
reaction products, etc., have caused high corrosion rates in circulating
systems and flow restriction in the off-gas systems of sodium fluoroborate
loops. The identity, source, method of removal, and the maximum impurity
concentrations that can be tolerated in the cover gas and salt need to be
established. The CSTF will utilize the helium purification unit from the
MSRE to purify the incoming helium and thus eliminate one possible source
of moisture and oxygen.

The coolant pump for the reference design MSBR will operate at 1150°F
with a shaft purge rate of not less than 5 liters/min (STP) and a pump
pressure not less than 10 psig. If no recovery provisions are made, the
four pumps would release one cylinder of BF3 (200 ft3 STP) into the atmos-—
phere per day. The CSTF is equipped with a recovery unit that is expected
to reduce the BF3 release rate by a factor of 100. Disposal of the re-
sidual BF3; in the off-gas stream from the BF3 recovery unit (<2000 ppm)
will still be a problem. Past experience indicates that acid-liquid for-
mation and plugging near the exit (where BF; meets the ventilation air
stream) will take place and remain a nuisance unless handled differently.
Bubbling through mineral cil at the release point may be satisfactory.

Other possible alternatives are (1) bubble the effluent through a
scrubber containing mercury and water or carbon tetrachloride and water
and (2) reacting the residual BF; with alkali metal oxides or fluorides
at elevated temperatures.

Corrosion Product Deposition. — To remove the corrosion product,
Na3CrFg, produced by moisture in-leakage into the salt system, an effi-
cient cold trap must be developed. The design of the cold traps must
include considerations of (1} simplicity of operation, i.e., easy temper-
ature control, logical flow pattern to take advantage of differing salt
densities due to temperatures, (2) tenacity of the deposit (powder or
cake), (3) replaceability when loaded with Na3CrFg, and (4) ability to

 
244

detect and cope with the effects of small steam lezks (a steam leak of
0.115 1b/hr would result in the stoichiometric production of 1 1b of
NasCrFg per hour}. Additional information is needed, such as deposition
rate as a function of concentration, temperature, and character of the
deposit — that is, whether the deposit is a mixture of NaBF, and NayCrFg.
The CSTF is equipped with a cold trap which will provide the answers to
some of these questions. Because of the steep rise in liquidus tempera-
ture (Fig. 5.9) with decreasing ratio of NaBF, to NaF and its implications
on cold trap operation near the liquidus temperature, a more precise
method of determining the mole fraction of these constituents is needed.

Mist Control. - Mist generation is associated with pump design; the
smaller pumps, LFB-type on FCL-1 loop and the Alpha pump on the FCL-2
loop, have not exhibited any mist problems. The pump off-gas from the
CSTF pump is routed through a tortuous heated path, a large hot settling
chamber, and a large cold settling chamber before it is discharged through
1/4~in.-0D tubing. This may be sufficient to handle the mist generated
in the pump bowl. If not, then the tests of a mist trap slated for the
Gas System Technology Facility (GSTF) will provide useful information for
designing an alternative means for controlling the mist in the coolant.

On-Line Analysis. — The on-line voltammetic salt monitoring device
developed by the Analytical Chemistry Division needs to be tested on
large-scale pumped loops. This new tool may provide chromium impurity
data for use in the cold trapping operation of the CSTF. Also the ana-
lyzer has the potential of almost instantaneously detecting a steam leak
into a fluoroborate system.

Coolant Leaks. — As explained in Chapter 5, no violent excthermic
reactions occur when flucroborates are mixed with steam or with fluoride
fuel salts. In fact, fluorcborates are immiscible with molten mixtures
of lithium and beryllium fluorides over a significant range of conditions,
Uranium and other tri- and tetravalent elements are not extracted into
fluoroborates, and the only high-melting compound that might be formed
is sodium fluoride. There is some migration of LiF to the fluoroborate
phase, and replacement of NaF by LiF in the NaBF, complex results in an
almost immediate release of some BF gas. The detailed consequences of
mixing of the fuel salt with the sodium fluorcborate depend on {a} the
rate of mixing of the two streams, (b) the solubility of the BF3 gas in
the resultant phase, (c¢) the relative temperatures of the two fluids,

(dé) the kinetics of reactions between the distributed components, and

(e} which fluid constitutes the continuous phase. Present evaluation of
all of these factors indicates that there is no mechanism for the concen-
tration of uranium to produce a critical configuration and no compounds
will be formed which cannot be redissolved through the addition of appro-
priate chemical agents [32]. For MSBR use, moreover, the accidental in-
troduction of fluoroborates into the circulating fuel would cause a large
reactivity decrease because of the boron, and thus even a small leak
 

 

i

 

 

 

245

would be quickly detected. The boron could be removed from the fuel salt
by treatment with HF. Some studies of mixing in a loop system are needed
in order to better evaluate the effects.

Evaluation

Although sodium fluoroborate is somewhat of a nuisance salt compared
with LiF-BeF,, its operational problems are not insurmountable, and its
lower liquidus temperature and cost make it our choice for the MSBR. The
major requirement is sensitive and early detection of moisture inleakage
te minimize corrosion of the container material and corrosion-product
deposition in the steam-raising equipment. Detection of the resultant HF
in the cff-gas line and detection of chromium by the on-line salt analyzer
are two promising methods for detecting moisture inleakage. Processing
of the coolant salt to make it serve as a tritium sink is discussed in
Chapters 5 and 14.

Heat Exchangers

Primary heat exchangers (salt-to-salt) and steam generators (salt-
to-water) comprise the coupling between the circulating fuel reactor
system, the coolant system, and the steam system. Other heat exchangers
less important from the standpoint of development required, are the steam
reheaters (salt-to-steam) and the reheat-steam-preheaters (steam-to-steam).
Some of the important temperatures and pressures within which these heat
exchangers must operate are given in Table 8.5. More specific information
will be found in the references shown.

The steam reheater and the reheat steam preheater are regarded as
conventional heat exchangers and no fundamental problems of heat transfer
or development are foreseen. Even though the 650°F reheat steam enters
the reheater below the 725°F liquidus temperature of the coolant salt,
the low steam~side heat-transfer ccoefficient leads us to conclude that
there will be no significant problem with freezing of the salt. The re-
maining discussion is therefore directed toward the primary heat exchanger
and the steam generator.

Requirements and Criteria for the Primary Heat Exchanger
and Steam Generator

The general requirements and criteria common to the primary heat
exchanger and the steam generator in our reference design are as follows.
Both are shell and tube heat exchangers fabricated of Hastelloy N and both
must maintain their structural integrity during a 30-yr design life that
includes thermal transients caused by normal operations, various plant
upsets, and emergencies. Differential expansion hetween tubes and shell
must be accommodated without the use of bellows, and thermal stresses at
critical locations, such as tube sheets and nozzles, should be minimized
without the use of a gas space if possible.

The steam generator tubes will have supercritical steam on one side
and sodium flucrcborate on the other. The peak temperature of the steam
side will be about 1000°F and that on the salt side will be 1150°F. Both
of these fluids are corrosive under certain conditions. As discussed in
Chapters 5 and 7, sodium fluoroborate is aggressive when water is present
in the salt. Steam is oxidizing to metals and can produce stress corro-
sion cracking when it contains small concentrations of chlorides. Thus,
the material used for steam generator tubes in a molten-salt system must
resist corrosion by both sodium fluoroborate and steam, or duplex tubes
must be used.

With the use of thermal baffles for the protection of the tube sheet,
the 700°F feedwater entering the steam generator will cool some of the
static salt below its 725°F liquidus and freeze it on the colder surfaces.
The design must accommodate the freezing and thawing of this small amount
of salt without structural damage to the steam generator.

We believe that direct maintenance of the steam generator will be
possible even though there is some induced sodium activity in the sodium
fluoroborate. Estimates place the 2%Na activity low enough (about 11 u
curies per gram of salt) for direct maintenance if drained of salt [37].
Although the extent of the problem is uncertain at this time it is possible
that the maintenance plan must be able to accommodate two other sources
of radicactive contamination. Trace elements {such as cobalt) in the
Hastelloy N will be activated and could be subsequently dispersed by the
corrosion process. Failure of a primary heat exchanger tube could allow
fission products to enter and be dispersed throughout the secondary cir-
cuit. The design of the steam generator must accommodate the necessary
maintenance and inspection to meet the requirements for in-service inspec-
tion, for minimizing down time, and for detection, location, and plugging
of leaking or damaged steam tubes.

Two special requirements — minimum fuel salt inventory and maintain-
ability by remote means — are imposed on the primary heat exchanger. The
low fuel salt inventory is desirable to minimize the doubling time and
inventory costs. The use of enhanced heat transfer surfaces on the heat
exchanger tubes will serve to reduce the total surface area, and the use
of small tubes will further reduce the fuel salt volume. The rapid re-
placement of the tube bundle (or the entire unit) by remote means is nec-
essary to minimize down time in the event repair is necessary in the
highly radioactive primary system.

Current Concepts

Conceptual designs of molten salt primary heat exchangers and steam
generators have been or are being prepared by ORNL, Ebascc Services Incor-
porated, Foster Wheeler Corporation, and by Black and Veatch. These are
briefly described and referenced in Tables 8.6 and 8.7.

One steam generator configuration which will receive attention in
future design studies and has promise of alleviating the feedwater temper-
ature requirement is the bayonet or re—entrant tube. Although investiga-
tions thus far indicate the bayonet tube configuration is not practical
at supercritical pressures because of the thick tube wall required, it

has definite possibilities for a subcritical pressure system. Ebasco
has looked at this configuration [38] and the Dutch propose this concept
for a molten-salt-heated steam generator [39].

Heat Transfer Experience

 

The operation of the MSRE represents the most recent large scale
experience with salt-to-salt heat exchangers [48]. This operation pro-
vided a considerable amount of confidence in the design techniques.

The heat transfer correlations used for the MSRE primary heat ex-
changer were based on the previous development tests which showed that
fluoride salts behave as normal fluids. When the MSRE operation revealed
the overall heat transfer coefficient to be less than predicted, a re~
evaluation of the physical properties disclosed that the actual thermal
conductivities of the fuel and coolant salts were below those used in
the design calculations and accounted for the difference [49]. The over-
all heat transfer coefficient of the MSRE heat exchanger did not change
during some 22,000 br of salt circulation and 13,000 equivalent full-
power hours of operation thus indicating no buildup of scale and no
evidence of gas filming.

The salt compositions used in the MSRE are not the same as presently
proposed for the MSBR. However, some preliminary heat transfer informa-
tion from the operation of a small corrosion loop with sodium fluoroborate
indicates general agreement with the Sieder-Tate correlation [50]. Thus
the conclusion is that the use of accurate physical property data with
correlations for normal fluids is adequate for heat transfer design with
fluoride salts. There is, however, no molten-salt heat transfer experience
with the knurled tubes proposed for the primary heat exchanger in the ORNL
reference design.

Correlations for heat transfer and pressure drop were chosen from
open literature and adapted for use in designing the MSBR reference pri-
mary heat exchanger and steam generator. Discussions of the use of these
correlations, certain correction factors applied because of baffle spacing,
bypass flow factors, etc.,, are found in Ref. 51 for the primary heat ex-
changer and 52 for the steam generator.

Although the operating experience with salts is quite extensive, the
available experience in the generation of steam in high-temperature molten-
salt-heated steam generators is nil. There is a considerable amount of
experience, both in the USA and Europe, with the use of low-melting salt
called Hitec for the generation of low-pressure steam and for a heat
transfer medium [53}. This salt would be an effective barrier for tritium,
as described in Chapter 2, and has therefore been considered for use im a
molten-salt reactor designed to be built with a minimum of further devel-
opment [54].

Materials Experience

 

As discussed in Chapter 5 and in the discussion of the coolant salt
earlier in this chapter the operation of the loops has shown that sodium
fluorcborate is compatible with Hastelloy N in the absence of impurities,

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

251

mainly moisture. In the absence of moisture, metal removal rates of <0.1
mil/yr have been obtained, which is low enough for use in a plant designed
for a 30-yr life. However, since the corrosion rate accelerates when
moisture is introduced and since the plant must have the capability of
recovering from a steam leak, a small purification system must be provided
for removing water and corrosion products from the salt. A method for
removing water has been demonstrated on a small scale and the use of cold
trapping to remove corrosion products has also been demonstrated.

The compatibility of Hastelloy N with steam is being investigated in
a test facility in TVA's Bull Run Steam Plant. Unstressed tabs exposed
at 1000°F have very acceptable metal loss rates of <0.25 mil/yr. The
Bull Run facility has been modified to accommodate stressed specimens
and a few have failed to date. The failure times do not seem outside
the scatterband for failure times obtained in inert gas. This work is
being conducted to evaluate the possibilities of stress corrosion of
Hastelloy N in the presence of steam as reported by Spalaris et al. [53]
based on their rather limited work.

Some tests are in progress on duplex tubing manufactured by the
International Nickel Company with Inccloy 80C on the steam side (inside)
and nickel on the salt side {outside}. This combination contacts fluids
with the alloys that have excellent compatibility.

Status of Heat Exchanger Technology

 

With the background of MSRE experience and the subsequent develop-
ment operation, we are confident of being able to predict salt-side heat
transfer coefficients with accurate physical properties available. Much
more testing and operating experience is needed to verify present infor-
mation and the revised salt compositions concerning physical properties,
heat transfer, and pressure drop correlations, and the avoidance of flow
instability and stratification problems.

The experience with Hastelloy N in steam is mostly good, but some
questions must be resolved before a firm conclusion can be reached. The
duplex tubing of nickel-Incoloy 800 looks promising: the compatibility
is excellent, and production methods for the tubing have been developed
so that a high quality product can be obtained at less cost than Hastelloy
N tubing. On the other hand, steam generator fabrication would be com~
plicated by use of the duplex tubes.

A considerable amount of information is available on the use of super-
critical steam: over 140 supercritical pressure steam generator units are
now operating, under construction, or on order in the U.S., Europe, and
Japan [56]. Design of molten-salt steam generators can draw on this
experience,

Some work has been done with analog simulations on the control of
the MSBR system. The results indicated that in order to maintain both
the primary salt and the coolant salt cold leg temperatures above their
respective freezing temperatures, either of two control schemes would be
satisfactory; both require a variable ccolant salt flow. One control
scheme would require attemperation of outlet steam temperature before
reaching the turbine and the second would require a controlled bypass
252

flow of coclant salt around the primary heat exchanger [57]. The attem~
peration of outlet steam between the steam generator and the turbine in-
troduces some uncertainty in turbine protection, while the controlled
bypass flow would require the development of a salt throttling valve. The
problems of attemperation will be explored as part of the steam generator
industrial porgram. The salt valve requirements are discussed later in
this chapter. There is also some work being done at ORNL with a hybrid
computer to identify and define various control and emergency transients
which will be imposed on heat exchangers so that the designer can effec
tively deal with them by either control system design or structural design
[58]. (See further discussion in Chapter 10.)

Some information was obtained from the MSRE on the deposition of fis-
sion products in the primary heat exchanger [59]. However, more informa-
tion is needed for larger systems in which the deposition of fission
products is expected to be much higher. (See Chapter 14, Table 14.2.)

The MSRE provided a background of information on remote and semi-
direct maintenance problems of radicactive systems (see Chapter 12). How-
ever, more information is needed on maintenance and inspection needs and
methods which may have a direct bearing on the configuration and perform
ance characteristics of heat exchangers.

Since many of the problems of molten-salt and liquid-metal systems
are similar, the experience being gained in the LMFBR program will be
helpful in providing information which is either directly applicable or
at least sufficiently similar to provide guidance in planning the develop-
ment program. A few examples of LMFBR development areas in which prcblems
are similar are as follows. Work done in the development of high-temper-
ature design criteria and thermal stress analysis of complex geometries
will be applicable although the materials are not the same. The problems
of stability and flow reversal at low load on the tube and shell sides
respectively are similar to those of a molten-salt steam generator. The
problems of overpressure protection and pressure pulse analysis of the
secondary system are similar and portions of the LMFBR experience will be
helpful in planning the molten-salt tests. The LMFBR experience in the
development of techniques for the fabrication of thick tube sheets and
joining of tubes to tube sheets will be of benefit to the molten-salt
program.

Uncertainties and Their Sensitivity to Nonachievement of Objectives

Feedwater Temperature Limit. — The lower limit of feedwater tempera-
ture that is workable in a steam generator heated by salt which freezes
at 725°F is uncertain. We believe the presently proposed 700°F tempera-
ture and supercritical pressure to be conservative and anticipate develop-
ment testing to resclve this uncertainty will result in simplification
of the steam generator design, the steam system, and the startup system
from that of the ORNL reference design. As described later in this chapter
under the discussion of the steam system, if lower feedwater temperatures
are found tc be feasible, it is possible that a subcritical pressure steam
system can be used. A feasibility study of the use of a lower feedwater
temperature will be performed by Foster Wheeler as part of the industrial
program [601].

 
253

Tube Sheet Protection. — The tube sheet will have to be protected
from rapid temperature changes which could be imposed by thermal tran-
sients in the salt. This can be done by providing a buffer between the
tube sheet and the flowing salt such as a gas space or a layer of static
salt. In the molten salt steam generator it is proposed to provide this
protection by static salt behind a thermal baffle. The use of a gas
space will be avoided if at all possible. Since the salt pump requires
a gas space which operates near the pump suction pressure any additional
free liquid surfaces in the steam generators will require individual
controls which vary the gas pressure according to the circuit flow resis-
tance at that location. Changes of level will occur in a few seconds
when the salt pump stops suddenly. Level control is thus complex requir-
ing salt level measurement and sensitive gas pressure controls with prob-
lems of undetermined seriousness arising from a control failure. If this
liquid level tends te oscillate there could be some undesirable tempera-
ture fluctuations in the tube walls at the liquid gas interface.

As mentioned earlier, the use of a thermal baffle to maintain a static
salt buffer between the tube sheet and the flowing salt may result in some
salt freezing. The sodium fluorchborate coolant salt undergoes a volume
i reduction of about 4-1/2% on freezing [61], and there is some uncertainty

as to the best means of accommodating this volume change. We regard this
problem as an important development objective but do not view it as a
serious uncertainty at this time.

 

 

 

 

Flow Instabilities in the Steam Generator. — The sensitivity to static
and dynamic flow instabilities during full and part load operation is an
important uncertainty. Although the molten-salt reactor is intended to
be a base load power plant, the steam generator must be able to traverse
low loads during steam-system startup and shutdown. Also the steam gen-
erator could be used to remove fission product heat after the reactor is
shut down if it can be shown that this can be done without damage. The
designer can predict and avoid static instability with a reasonably high
degree of confidence. Dynamic instability is much more difficult to
analyze and quantified solutions are not available.

 

 

 

 

Configuration. — The uncertainty in the selection of heat exchanger
configurations lies in the assignment of weighting factors to the various
trade-off design features such as stability at low load (steam generator),
down-time costs associated with maintenance and inspection, fabricability,
reliability, system piping lavout, cell volume, and fuel salt inventory
(primary heat exchanger). Analysis and engineering judgment can go far
in the assignment of conservative weighting factors to these trade-offs.
However, feedback from development testing is necessary to indicate how
realistic these assignments are.

 

Pressure Pulse from Rupture of a Steam Tube. - The magnitude and
duration of a pressure pulse resulting from a credible steam tube rupture
ww must be determined and be factored into the design of the shell and
pressure~relief system.

 

 
254

Correlations and Physical Properties. - The uncertainties in heat
transfer and pressure-drop correlations are probably less than those of
the salt physical properties since it has been established that salts
behave as normal fluids [62]. Although there was no evidence of gas films
or fouling in the MSRE heat exchanger [63], uncertainties remain concern-
ing the possible fouling of the steam generator surfaces and in the use of
the knurled (enhanced) tubes of the primary heat exchanger. Verification
of present information on correlations and physical properties and resolu-
tion of the remaining uncertainties are needed to provide increased con-
fidence in their use. wi

 

Ly

Thermal Transients. — Transients in operating conditions cause thermal
stresses in the piping and heat exchangers by causing the metal surface
temperature to change more rapidly than the interior. Although basic
heat exchanger design may not be very sensitive to the accurate definition
of thermal transients it is a problem which must be more fully explored =
so that necessary accommodations can be made in the design of both the
heat exchangers and the control system. Some work has been done in the

modeling of the MSBR reference system on a hybrid computer system [64]. .

Steam Wastage and Leak Detection (Steam Generator}. — The wastage
rate of a small steam leak against Hastelloy N in the presence of sodium
fluoroborate is an uncertainty. Ancther is the best method of leak de-
tection. Although the basic steam generator design is not very sensitive
to these uncertainties, development is needed to provide basic information i
on leak detection, wastage parameters, and plant shut-down criteria in
the event of a steam leak.

 

Fission Product Deposition. - The existing uncertainties in the quan-
tity and location of fission product deposition on components and piping
{see Chapters 5 and 14) affect not only the heating problem but also the
maintenance planning. In particular, the distribution of fission products
and the heat loads imposed must be evaluated in order to provide for emer-
gency cooling of the empty primary heat exchanger in the event the salts EE
could not remain in the system.

 

Materials Compatibility. = The compatibility of Hastelloy N with the
fluoride salts is discussed in Chapter 7. The compatibility of Hastelloy HN
with supercritical pressure steam is an uncertainty at this time with
tests in progress [65]. The possible use of other materials in the steam wa
generator is mentioned in Chapter 7. Failure to meet the requirement
could cause the change of container material or the use of duplex tubing
for the steam generator [66]. ] a

Fabrication Techniques. - Specific joint designs, fabrication proce-
dures, and inspection procedures have not been chosen at this time. How-
ever, these present no unusual problems and can be expected to evolve
with the heat exchanger design. Specific problems will be resolved as
they arise with the participation of industrial firms. The tubing with
enhanced heat transfer characteristics proposed for the primary heat ex-
changer represents an uncertainty which must be explored. Using unen-
hanced tubing would increase the heat exchanger fuel salt volume about
40 to 507% which means a 6 to 7% increase in total fuel salt inventory.

Development Program for Heat Exchangers

Primary Heat Exchanger. — The most important uncertainty concerning
the primary heat exchanger to be resolved by development is that of mate-
rials. The materials problems are discussed in Chapter 7.

The next most important uncertainty for the primary heat exchanger
is whether the enhanced tubing will have the assumed structural and heat
transfer characteristics necessary for a low salt inventory. Heat transfer
tests with salt would be necessary to verify the structural and heat trans-
fer characteristics. The testing should also include the provisions for
remote maintenance that are incorporated in the heat exchanger design.

 

Steam Generator Materials

We plan to continue operation of the steam corrosion facility at
TVA's Bull Run Steam Plant. This facility will accommodate 100 unstressed
coupons and 13 stressed specimens, The evaluation of Hastelloy N, par-
ticularly in the stressed state, will continue until a conclusion can be
made about its compatibility with steam under stress. Enough information
already exists on Incolcoy 800 and Inconel 600 in steam that evaluation
programs on these materials will not be necessary.

In order to evaluate the use of Inconel 600 in contact with coolant
salt and steam, tests would be needed to determine the compatibility of
Inconel 600 with sodium fluoroborate. The initial tests should be thermal
convection loops, with tests in pumped systems initiated if the results
from the thermal convection loops look favorable.

The work most needed on the duplex Incoloy 800mickel tubing is an
evaluation of the mechanical integrity of the product. Each side of the
tube is compatible with its respective environment, namely Incoloy 800
with steam and nickel with fluoroborate. The tests of mechanical integrity
will be primarily long-term tube burst tests in inert gas environment.

The main questions to be answered concern the integrity of the bimetal
interface and the resistance of the nickel to intergranular separation.
If these tests are favorable, the question of joining techniques must be
evaluated. Welding heads currently exist that permit welds with filler
metal to be made inside 3/4 in. diameter tubes. The evaluation of
joint designs that utilize this equipment will be a part of our future
program. : :
256

Although crevice corrosion is not thought to be a problem in the
nickel-base alloys we do need work to prove it. The main questions to
be answered concern the effect fluoroborate would have on the corrosion
characteristics resulting from water which is not removal from crevices
such as in the tube headers of the heat exchanger and the steam generator.
Unfavorable results would mean that the coolant system would have to be
designed free of crevices.

Steam Generator. — The development plan for molten-salt heated steam
generators is divided into three phases described in [67].

The major effort of phase one, presently in progress, consists of a
conceptual design study by Foster Wheeler Corporation [68]. The study
consists of four tasks as follows:

Task 1. Prepare a conceptual design of a steam generator for the 1000-Mi(e)
MSBR reference plant. This steam generator is to produce steam
at 1000°F and 3500 psia from feedwater at 700°F.

Task 2. ‘Investigate the feasibility of steam generators that produce
steam at 1000°F and 3500 psia and 1000°F and 2400 psia from
feedwater at 500 and 600°F. If the results of the investigation
are favorable, prepare conceptual designs of steam generators
for one or both conditions.

Task 3. Prepare a conceptual design of a steam generator of a size appro-
priate for the 150-MW(t) MSBE based on a design selected from
1 and 2 above.

Task 4. Describe the research and development program required to
establish the feasibility of the steam generator of MSBE size.

In addition to the design study some small-scale tests will be per-
formed and a steam generator development report will be prepared if funding
is adequate.

In the second phase, the plan is to proceed with the preliminary de-
sign of the MSBE size steam generator, to conduct tests and evaluations
necessary to guide the design, and to demonstrate in small tests of pro-
totypes that the design will perform about as expected. Performance tests
of models that contain a few full size tubes would be conducted under full
heat flux conditions in a 3-MW facility as described in [69].

The third phase will consist of engineering tests on prototype steam
generators. The tests would be performed as part of the operation of the
units in the steam system of a reactor experiment or demonstration plant.
One or more industrial companies will prepare the detailed design and
manufacture the steam generator prototypes. With the experience gained
during this phase, the manufacturer would have demonstrated the capa-
bilities needed for supplving reliable steam generators for any future
needs of the MSBR Program. Scaleup requirements will depend on whether
the MSBR design at the time of phase three specifies a modular steam gen-
erator (as presently shown for the ORNL reference design) or a unit steam
generator {such as proposed by Foster Wheeler and Ebasco).

Evaluation

With the exception of the materials problem of the primary heat ex~
changer (see Chapter 7), none of the uncertainties associated with heat
exchangers and steam generators is seen as fundamental. All uncertainties
are considered to be resolvable with the application of an adequately
funded program of analysis and development, The reviews made by the
Molten Salt Group and Molten Salt Breeder Reactor Associates (Black and
Veatch) reached this same conclusion [70, 43 p. 59].

There is little question that primary heat exchangers and steam
generators can be developed for the MSBE and the larger MSBRs. Perform-
ance characteristics that are not quite as good as desired may have to
be accepted in exchange for greater reliability and ease of maintenance.
Much of the technology being developed for the heat exchangers and steam
generators for LMFBRs appears to be applicable to the equipment for molten
salt reactors. Its use is expected to substantially reduce the work that
will be required to develop the unite for molten salt reactors, but a sub-
stantial development and test program will, nevertheless, be required.

We would prefer to use Hastelloy N for all parts that contact salt.
However, our current test results are not sufficient to allow us to con-
clude whether Hastelloy N is compatible with steam. A program is in
progress that will answer this question. A second materials choice would
be the use of Inconel 600 throughout the system. This material is com-
patible with steam, but its compatibility with sodium fluoroberate must
be evaluated. A duplex tube with Incoloy 800 on the steam side and nickel
on the sodium fluorcborate side should have excellent compatibility with
the fluids. The mechanical integrity of this product and the ability to
make sound joints remain to be demonstrated.

Steam System

Present Proposals for Supercritical Steam Cycle

The steam—power system proposed for the MSBR reference design [71]
consists of supercritical cycle and equipment which is conventional except
for the feedwater and reheat steam preheating facilities. The cycle used
in the Bull Run steam station of the TVA was adapted for the MSBR study
to make the cost and performance estimates realistic.

The MSBR cycle uses steam at turbine throttle conditions of 3500 psia
and 1000°F. Steam generator outlet steam attemperation is provided for
the control of turbine inlet conditions at part-load operation. Some
steam is extracted from the high pressure turbine for driving the main
boiler feedwater turbine and for the final stage of regenerative feedwater
heating. Another extraction is made at about 600 psia for the preheater
and reheater circuits. The reheated steam is supplied to the double-flow
intermediate-pressure turbines at about 540 psia and 1000°F (see Fig. 8.4).
The intermediate~-pressure turbine exhausts to two double-flow low-pressure
turbines from which extractions are made for the feedwater heater chain.
The exhaust from the low-pressure turbine is exhausted into four surface

condensers operating at about 1-1/2 in, Hg abs. Full-flow demineralizers
are used to obtain the high purity necessary for once-through steam gener-
ator operation after which the feedwater is raised in temperature and
pressure te the final 700°F and 3800 psia steam generator inlet condition.

One of the two unconventional features in ORNL's adaptation of the
TVA steam cycle is the reheat of extraction steam in two stages by use of
a prime-steam-heated preheater and a salt-heated reheater. The other
unconventional feature is the heating of feedwater to 700°F by direct
mixing of the 866°F steam exiting the above preheater with the high pres-
sure 550°F feedwater leaving the top extraction heater. Two large motor-
driven canned-rotor centrifugal pumps in parallel then each boost about
19,000 gpm of feedwater from about 3500 psia to 33800 psia. Eight steps
of feedwater heating are used in addition to the direct mixing to obtain
the 700°F feedwater temperature. The use of the supercritical pressure
allows the direct mixing without serious problems.

Ebasco examined alternatives but selected essentially the same steam
system as that of the ORNL reference system [72]. They concluded that the
use of the direct mixing for feedwater heating and the special booster
pumps are feasible and within foreseeable technological development.
Ebasco proposes az means of improving the cycle thermal efficiency by re-
claiming reactor decay heat and chemical processing heat. This heat is
introduced into the cycle as an additional source of low pressure feed-
water heating steam [73].

Uncertainties Resulting from the Feedwater Temperature Requirements

Based on the present conservative assumption that 700°F feedwater
temperature is necessary, a supercritical-pressure steam system is the
only reasonable choice. Heating the feedwater toc 700°F in a subecritical-
pressure cycle would require a very large amount of heat transfer surface
or, more likely, use of the Loeffler cycle. The steam generator would
become a superheater requiring a steam compressor and a much larger mass

flow rate,
If use of feedwater at 580°F is determined to be feasible the mixing

chamber, pressure booster pumps, and reheat steam preheaters could be
eliminated from the supercritical cycle [74]. The increase in efficiency
plus the simplification of the steam system would represent a substantial
savings. Alternatively, a subcritical pressure steam cycle becomes feasi-
ble and can be included in the options for a MSBR power system. The feasi-
bility of using lower feedwater temperature will be investigated by Foster
Wheeler for subcritical and supercritical pressure steam cycles [75].
Also, the use of the nitrate-nitrite salt in a tertiary system between

the secondary system and the steam, as proposed for the MSBR, allows the
use of 480°F feedwater temperature and the choice between a supercritical
or a subcritical pressure steam cycle [761].

As previously mentioned, the unconventional feedwater heating needs
of the MSBR reference steam cycle require the use of booster pumps and
mixing chambers. Although both of these components are currently in use
at near the desired conditions, the sizes needed for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR
are not presently available. According to Ebasco’s investigation, the

— a ae ve
tT we we

260

canned-rotor booster pumps needed for the MSBR steam cycle are about 50%
larger than the largest known pump built to date [77]. Consequently, de-
velopment of larger capacity, multistage pumps would be needed. The mixing
chambers needed are also larger than those in use, but this does not appear
to impose a major development problem since a chamber similar to one spec-
ified for the MSBR system and about four-fifths as large is in use at the
TVA Bull Run Steam Plant [78]. As an alternative, a high-pressure heat
exchanger could be used to obtain the 700°F feedwater. The exit heating
steam could be then heated to 1000°F in a salt-heated exchanger and rein-
troduced into the cycle thereby eliminating the pressure booster pumps.

Evaluation

High efficiency can be obtained with the supercritical pressure
steam system (44.5% per Ref. 79) even though the molten-salt steam gener-
ator may require 700°F feedwater. The improvement in the efficiency and
reduction of capital costs which can be realized by lowering the feedwater
temperature requirement provides a strong incentive for the development
effort in this direction. The lowering of the steam pressure and of feed-
water temperature could actually be mutually compatible. For example,
as discussed in the section on heat exchangers, the bayonet tube configura-
tion which was unsatisfactory at high pressure may be satisfactory with
subcritical pressure steam and lower feedwater temperature. Although the
overall plant efficiency would be less with the subcritical pressure
cycle, the simplification and reduced capital costs may be cffsetting.

The molten-salt reactor concept is not strongly dependent on the details
of the steam system. However, since the steam—electric equipment rep-
resents more than half of the cost of the plant, the optimization of this
system merits much development and analysis effort.

There are several options available for the steam system of a molten-
salt reactor plant, none of which involve fundamental uncertainties, All
uncertainties are considered to be resolvable with the application of an
adequately funded program of analysis and development. Since the details
of the steam system are so dependent on the requirements of the steam
generator, it is imperative that these requirements be definitely estab-
lished and verified.

Steam Generator Auxiliary Systems

 

Two auxiliary systems are necessary for the use of liquid-heated
steam generators (either liquid metal or molten salt) which are quite dif-
ferent from those normally required for fossil fired plants: a startup
system and a pressure relief system. The startup system is needed because
the high melting temperature of the coolant salt imposes special require-
ments on the startup of a molten~salt-heated steam generator. Because
of the possibility of a steam-generator—tube failure, a pressure relief
system must be provided to prevent high pressures from being transmitted
through the secondary system to the very radicactive primary system.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

261

Steam Generator Startup System. - The startup system must provide
for the initial coupling of the salt-heated steam generator to the steam
system without freezing of salt and with a minimum of thermal shock. Since
the steam generator operation may be unstable at very low loads and flows,
another of the functions of the startup system will be to traverse the
transition region as quickly and as smoothly as possible.

The startup system consists of an auxiliary boiler which can deliver
supercritical pressure steam at 100C°F, along with its flash tank, boiler
feed pump, and other associated auxiliaries. The reference system and
startup procedure are described in Ref. 80. Studies being made by Ebasco |
[81] and Foster Wheeler [82] in the industrial program will provide input
on startup system requirements. Ebasco proposes a startup boiler and
system which would be capable of supplying enough steam for about 10% of
rated plant load.

As with conventional supercritical boilers, the detailed requirements
of the startup system for the molten-salt steam generator depend a great
deal on the design and operating characteristics of the steam generator
itself. Any uncertainties lie in the application of more-or-less conven-
tional steam system equipment to the detailed startup needs of the molten-
salt steam generator. Although basic portions of the system or certain
startup techniques may be demonstrated in steam—-generator model tests, the
interrelationship between the startup and turbine steam systems is so com-
plex that only a large facility, such as the MSBE, will be able to ade-
quately test a complete startup system. Whatever difficulties arise should
be resolvable with the assistance and experience of qualified industrial
firms.

 

Pressure Relief System. ~ To maintain the secondary salt system as a
buffer between the steam and primary systems, a pressure relief device
must be provided on the salt side of the steam generator. A retention
system of conduits and holdup tanks must also be provided to contain the
effluent mixture of steam and salt in the event a steam tube does rupture
and actuate a relief device.

The relief device must operate at temperatures above the liquidus
of the salt. It must operate either in direct contact with molten salt
(or in close proximity via a gas space buffer) for long periods of time
without loss of reliability. It must be capable of having its reliability
checked during normal shutdown periods. It must contain salt without any
leakage and yet rapidly relieve z mixture of salt and steam in the event
of a tube rupture.

The ORNL reference concept proposes a nickel rupture disk in a com
mercially available snapover-type or reverse-buckling type actuator [84]
positioned on the salt outlet of the steam generator. The Ebascoc study §
concept provides a gas-filled rupture disk housing at the high point of 4
the steam generator loop [853]. Foster Wheeler will propose a conceptual
design of a rupture disk assembly and location as part of their study [86].
Although the other two concepts incorporate a gas space buffer between
the disk and salt, Foster Wheeler has been requested to consider a "hard"
system with no gas pocket. The hard system approach being requested of
Foster Wheeler is more desirable in that the location of the rupture disk

 
— ar ee

262

is not restricted and the uncertainty of maintaining multiple gas pockets
is also avoided.

4s far as we know, no rupture disks have been operated with molten
salt. Although rupture disks have been used with liquid-metal systems
in the LMFBR program, in most cases the disks have been located in a gas
space. The major uncertainty is one of development of a combination of
materials and an actuation device that will operate relisbly after long
periods in contact with molten salt. Although the development of a salt
system rupture disk appears feasible, failure to achieve this goal would
require reversion to the use of a gas pocket for the protection of the
disk assembly.

Little uncertainty is associated with the retention system necessary
to handle the effluent from the relief device. However, a development
program must be established for the components and operating procedures

necessary to provide for separation, handling, and disposal of the gaseous,

liquid, and solid effluents resulting from a rupture. The development
information needed also includes the procedures and equipment necessary
for the cleanup of the remainder of the secondary salt system to allow
resumption of operation in a minimum of time.

Valves

General Description of Valves and Valve Requirements

 

Valves will be needed in future molten-salt reactors for the same
reasons they are needed in other reactor systems, i.e., to isolate por-
tions of the reactor while the remainder operates, to direct flow to al-
ternate paths, and to provide flow variations to meet start-up and off-
design conditions. Two major categories of valves will be required, i.e.,
shutoff valves and throttling valves. For 1000 MW(e) MSBR's, shutoff
valves will be required in sizes up toc 6 inches and for temperatures to
1150°F. Throttling valves, up to 24-in. size, will be needed for service
in the secondary system at temperatures up to 1150°F to control bypass
flow of coolant salt around the primary heat exchanger and to provide
flow diversion at the reheater.

The differences in the requirements of these two types of valves
could lead to greatly differing valve design. To be considered for shut-
off service are (1) conventional mechanical designs, (2) freeze valves,
and (3) "combination" valves which close to restrict most of the flow
mechanically with the final close-off being made by a freeze seal within
the valve. Throttling valves, which do not have tight close-off require-
ments, are expected to be of more conventional design.

Experience with Moclten-Salt Valves

 

Freeze valves have been used successfully in molten-salt service
over the past 20 years. These valves have continued to be used because
of excellent service and because no mechanical valve has been developed
to solve the reliability requirements of molten-salt service. A freeze

wa

valve consists simply of 2 section of sait-filled piping which can be
cooled when desired to establish a short section of frozen salt which
effectively blocks flow. Both the freeze valve and mechanical valve have
specific advantages. The mechanical valve can provide faster opening and
closing and can be used for flow throttling. The freeze valve provides
high reliability and zero salt leakage across the valve and thus is par-
ticularly well suited to applications when tight shutoff is needed for !
long periods of time. {

Freeze valves have operated successfully in the MSRE and in many
out-of-pile tests at ORNL in sizes up to 1-1/2-in. IPS pipe. More than i
125 have been used, and they have accumulated more than 650,000 hr of op-
erating time, These valves operated with salts as diverse as the eutec-
tic mixture of NaBF,~NaF (92-8 mole Z), which has a 725°F melting point,
and LiF, which has a 1560°F melting point.

The operation of the 12 freeze valves in the MSRE demonstrated re-
liability in an actual reactor system [87]. These valves were of two
sizes, 1/2 in. and 1-1/2 in. IPS, and accumulated 200,000 hr of operation
during the reactor's lifetime. One of 1-1/2 in. valves failed and leaked
a few grams of salt during the final shutdown of the reactor. The failure
was due to thermal stresses caused by a field modification of a shroud on
the valve to aid attachment of a larger cooling line. Suitable design
modifications should eliminate this problem in future valves.

Aircraft Reactor Program Development Work on Mechanical Valves. -
Tests of bellows-sealed mechanical valves were conducted around 1957 in
the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Program in an attempt to develop a 1-1/2-
in. IPS shut-off valve for temperatures of 1200 te 1500°F with molten salt.
The valve seat material was considered to be the major problem, and al-
though z successful valve was not developed prior to cancellation of the
work, some promising seat and plug material combinations were investigated.
Five valves were tested with a variety of seat-plug material combinations
and accumulated over 7,000 hr of testing experience. Leak rates in the
more successful tests ranged from 0 to 5 ce/hr with a 50-psi pressure dif=-
ferential across the closed valve seat. The cermet materials were the
most promising seat-plug combinations, This experience will be of value
in future programs to develop shut-off valves for molten-salt service.

 

ORNL 4-in. Throttling Valve. - Five throttling valves were designed
and fabricated at ORNL around 1955 for flow control in five pump loops
that operated with molten salts and liquid metals. The valves were de-
signed for throttling service only and were fabricated completely of In- {
conel, They operated a total time of 114,000 hr at temperatures from ¢
1000 to 1500°F, and no bellows failure or significant mechanical problems
occurred during that time. The valves were manually operated and were
adjusted during operation of the loop to measure pump performance char-
acteristics. These ORNL sleeve valves are the only known bellows—sealed
mechanical valves which have operated routinely and successfully in high-
temperature molten-salt service. This experience leads us to believe
that larger throttling valves can be successfully developed when needed. .

Valve Experience in Sodium Svstems

Bellows-sealed valves have been used successfully in many sodium ap-
plications. For up to a few inches in pipe size, it appears that similar
valves would be satisfactory for use in molten salt if fabricated of
Hastelloy N and proper seat and plug materials. However, there is very
limited experience with larger size bellows—sealed valves even in sodium
and no experience with bellows valves larger than six inches.

The problems in design and development of larger liquid-metal shutoff
and check valves have been discussed by Seim [88], and many of the prob-
lems are common to molten-salt valves. Most sodium valves of larger size,
however, have had sodium freeze seals on the valve stems, and this option
is not available for molten-salt valves. Although larger hermetically
sealed valves for molten-salt reactors consequently have very little sodium
operating experience to draw from, valve design, fabrication, and operation
presently planned in the LMFBR program should in the future provide much
useful information to aid molten-salt valve development.

Status of Valve Technology

The freeze valve technology in sizes up to 1-1/2-in. IPS pipe size
is well developed, but no freeze valves larger than 1-1/2 in. have been
operated. Such valves will require special design to provide cross sec-
tions of salt that are small enough for freezing to be accomplished in
reasonable time periods. Analytical stress analysis of a freeze valve
is difficult because of the irregular shape and unpredictable temperature
distribution during freezing and thawing. It seems likely that prototypes
of each new freeze valve design for future reactors will have to be ex-
tensively tested over the expected number of freeze-thaw cycles.

Mechanical shutoff valves, with their attendant seat-plug material
problems, will provide the most difficult development problems. No satis-
factory mechanical shutoff valve has been developed, even in small sizes,
primarily because freeze valves were available for use where needed. The
experience of the LMFBR program in developing mechanical valves, partic-
ularly the operators, will be directly applicable to the design of valves
for molten salts.

No commercial technology exists for fabrication of Hastelloy N valves
and bellows at the present time. However, there are no known metallurgical
problems which should prevent fabrication of large valves when required.

Effect of Uncertainties of the Mechanical Valves

The two major uncertainties involve selection of the plug and seat
materials for shut-off valves and design and development of the operators.
The seat-seal of the mechanical shut-off valve requires that a high unit
seal force be applied at the seal surfaces and be maintained while the
valve is closed. The valve must alsc open on demand without damaging the
seal surface. If such a valve proves to be unusually difficult to develop,
it would be reasonable for most applications to use a freeze valve in

ig
265

series as a backup to this mechanical valve. In this case the mechanical
valve would be closed to choke-off the salt flow while the freeze plug
is established and then reopened to prevent self welding of the seat and
plug. This combination has been used in the drain line of some test loops.
The valve plug can be mechanically guided into the valve seat or
the throttling sleeve either in the salt or on the gas side of the pene-
i tration seal. The latter scheme requires stronger members but can be done
if the valves are to be located in an area outside of the cell furnace or
if the operator—guide can be in a small separate cell where it could be
cooled such that the bearing materials for the guide are not operated at
high temperature.
The mechanical throttle valves will require operators to control the
valve trim positions. Although there are some differences in the require-
Eo ments for these operators when used with a shut-off valve and with a
throttle valve, these differences are small. If a reliable throttling
valve cannot be developed for use in the coolant salt systems then the
Ee optimum control scheme for the reactor and the steam power plant will be
affected. A description of the use of the throttle valve is given in
Chapter 10.

Development Program Remaining for Valves

i Testing programs must be carried out to select suitable materials
for bearings, valve plugs, and seats for mechanical valves. The fabrica-
tion of reliable bellows must be demonstrated, or some other hermetic stem
- seal, such as the torque-tube seal must be developed [Ref. 89]. A commer-

EEE

cial capability for fabricating large Hastelloy mechanical valves will
have to be developed. Finally, complete valves must be tested extensively
at operating conditions to verify performance. The reliability of large
valve operators must be demonstrated at conditions similar to those in a
reactor system.

 

Evaluation

Little has been done on valve development for molten-salt reactors
since the work on throttling valves for loops in the ANP program and the
development of freeze valves for the MSRE. An active program, spanning
several years, would be required to provide the required valve technology
for molten~salt breeder reactors, with much of the time to be used in
testing prototype valves. We believe, however, that such a program can
produce freeze and mechanical valves that will be adequate for use in the
fuel and coolant salt systems.

 

Control Rods and Drives

General Description and Design Requirements

The reactivity control rods for the MSBR [90] reference design are
of two types, control rods which have both regulating and shimming func-
HE tions, and safety rods used primarily for reactor shutdown.

 
ew wm — —

266

The control rods are movable graphite cylinders about 3-3/4 in. di-
ameter with axiazl passages through them for a cooling flow of fuel salt,
These cylinders move axially within 4 in. diameter holes in 6- by 6-in.
graphite elements near the center of the core. Withdrawal leaves an
undermoderated region at the center of the reactor causing a reduction
in reactivity without a sacrifice in neutrons for breeding. Since the
graphite is considerably less dense than the fuel salt, it will tend to
float out of the core and reduce reactivity if a rod should break. These
rods are connected to drives which move them in and out of the core on
the demand of the control system [91]. Although the reference design
provides for only two of these graphite rods, it is probable that because
of thelr small effect on reactivity at least 4 such rods would be needed
and that they would move in unison at speeds up to 0.4 fps for normal
control of the reactor and perhaps 5 to 10 times that for certain unusual
conditions.

The safety rods consist of boron carbide clad in Hastelloy N and are
used to provide an independent shutdown capability. These rods move within
4 in. diameter holes like those occupied by the control rods. To satisfy
their safety function, it is intended that they would normally be posi-
tioned outside of the reactor during operation; however, it might be that
partial insertion for short periods would be required and therefore the
safety rod drive should have a positioning capability in addition to a
fast-insertion action.

The reference design does not include studies of the rod drives; how-
ever, in a system proposed by Bettis [92] the combined control safety rod
is suspended on a Hastelloy N cable which is taken up on a 12-in.-diam
drum driven by an electro-mechanical drive. The option for a magnetic
clutch between the drum and the motor is suggested tec provide for fast
insertion if such is needed. The combined control safety rod is of boron
carbide and Hastelloy N and would fall into the core if released. The
drive is isolated from the cable drum in a manner similar te that of the
fuel pump shaft gas purge and seal and is maintained in a clean environ-
ment with adequate shielding to protect the motors. The drive for the
graphite control rod for the MSBR reference design would be somewhat
different because of the buoyant effect of the graphite. These rods
would require positive engagement with the drive to hold it in the salt
in its fully inserted position. Drive mechanisms developed for the LMFBR
program possibly could be adapted for use in the MSBR control drive system.
The "roller nut" concept as depicted by the Marvel Schebler drive by Borg
Warner and the “magnetic jack" drive by Westinghouse [93] are possibilities
which should be considered because of the design and development already
accomplished in support of the LMFBR program.

The graphite control rods and the B,C safety rods discussed above
are cooled by the flow of cool fuel salt taken from the bottom entrance
region of the reactor.

Experience

The reactivity control rods for the two previous molten-salt reactors
were of the poison type. The regulating rod and the safety rods of the ARE
[94] and the control rods of the MSRE [95] were operated in metal thimbles

 
267

that separated them from the salt and therefore required auxiliary gas
cooling. Because the rods and drives were separated from the salt, there
was no problem of gas seals for fission product control. The safety rods
HE for the ARE were suspended from magnets which were moved with lead-screw
type drives. This drive was also used for the regulating rod. The MSRE
control rods were suspended from a continuous chain drive which was con-
Eo nected to a motor through magnetic clutches to permit fast insertion.
These rods and drives operated without significant difficulty during the
lives of the reactor experiments.
The poison material for the ARE safety rod was B,C and stainless
steel served as poison for the control rod [96]. The poison element for
the MSRE control rod [97] was a mixture of gadolinium and aluminum oxides,
formed and sintered into a number of short cylindrical tubes which were

wa in turn canned in Inconel. Visual observation of some of the canned ele-
ments at the end of the reactor operation revealed no significant changes
in dimensions or external appearance.

Er There has been no experience with control rods operating directly
in the salt; however, the physical arrangement and provisions for cooling
might be similar to that in the liquid-metal-cooled reactors. In one

os proposal for a control rod for use with a liquid-metal-cooled reactor,

= the poison section is guided within a duct which is positioned within
the core. The MSBR reference design uses graphite ducts for guiding the
safety rods and the graphite control rods.

Status of Control Rod Technology

The materials proposed for the poison elements for the MSBR are sim-
ilar to those used in the ARE. We have had experience with forming rare
- earth oxides and ByC into usable shapes and then canning the elements to
protect them from the environment. However, we have not had experience
with such elements in a high neutron flux field. The major problem with
the canning of the B,C for use in the shim rod or for a control rod is
= dealing with the helium produced by neutron absorption in the 0B, one
method is to provide ample space to contain the helium for the life of
the rod. If this does not appear feasible for the MSBR, one of the rare
earth oxides could be used. Another alternative is the use of a rod con-
structed entirely of Hastelloy N, the size depending on the reactivity
change needed for that particular rod.
The control and safety rods are to fit loosely in and be guided by
Ee the stationary graphite duct. Information is needed on the bearing prop-
erties of friction and wear in salt for graphite on graphite and Hastelloy
N on graphite, and for other materials on graphite if these combinations
: prove to be unsatisfactory.

As described above, the reactivity value of a single graphite control
rod is small and would require ganging several to obtain the necessary
sensitivity for control. More proof is needed that the use of such a rod
is feasible.

The contrcl and safety rod and rod drive development work for the

LMFBR should in part be applicable to the MSBR if suitable in-core guides
ws and contamination contrel seals can be developed. In particular the drives

 
— be

268

should be adaptable to MSR use although some of them require more head
room than we would like to provide above the reactor. In any event many
of the techniques will be useful in designing a drive system for MSBR's,

Effect of Uncertainties

 

The use of a graphite rod to provide the reactivity control and
shimming necessary is uncertain both because of its very low reactivity
worth and the problem of guiding it within the core. If the graphite
rod is determined to be unacceptable, then a poison rod of somewhat
greater worth could be used with an acceptable loss in breeding ratio
of 0.005 for 0.2% Ak/k [98].

The use of B,C as the poison, with the required heat removal and the
venting or storage of the helium produced, might make such an absorber
unacceptable. If so, the B,C could be replaced with rare earths such as
europium or gadolinium oxide which release energy as gamma rays instead
of alpha particles. No helium is generated and the gamma rays should not
deposit as much energy locally as would the alpha particle. The MSER
reference design uses the B,C poison in the safety or shutdown rods and
expects no trouble because they can be held cut of the reactor core until
needed and therefore do not have a helium generation or heating problem.
If further study of the shutdown requirements determines that rapid shut-
down is needed, then the rods might have to be inserted near emough to
the core to again require consideration of the use of other poisons.

Further Work

Any further work done in the development of control and safety rods
and rod drives should be directed toward the exact needs of a specific
molten-salt reactor. Requirements such as the exact amount of reactivity
to be controlled, the change rates of reactivity, and the response times
for the control and safety system should be established before the me-
chanical design of the system is started. Prototypes of the parts of the
design related to the salt-gas interface, the gas seals, the guides or
bearings for the rods within the core, and the transmission of motion to
the rods would be fabricated and operated first in water and air to assist
in optimizing the design, and then in salt and inert gas to proof test
for life expectancy and overall performance. The seals or activity con-
trol, the bearing materials and arrangement, and the method of cooling
the control element over its entire range of travel would receive the
earliest attention. After the initial component testing full scale rods
and drives would be tested under simulated reactor conditions.

Evaluation

No fundamental difficulties are foreseen in designing control and
safety rods and drives for use im MSR's, but a thorough development and
prototype testing program will be required to assure adequate performance
in a high-temperature environment before installation in a reactor. There
pees

 

 

 

 

269

are reasonable alternatives for most of the uncertainties, Perhaps a
problem requiring much attention is the bearing of the moving rod on the
graphite duct and obtaining an acceptable lifetime from such an arrange-
ment. However, because the fit can be loose and the contact pressure low,
we believe that satisfactory guides can be developed.

Fuel Storage and Afterheat Removal

Repositories are needed for both kinds of salts used in the MSBR to
provide safe and convenient storage any time they are drained. The fuel
drain tank, because of the intense radioactivity of the salt, must provide
reliably for the removal of afterheat as well as the sure containment of
volatile radicactive products. In some ways, as discussed in Chapter 14,
it is the major safety feature of the reactor.

The fuel drain tank must have sufficient capacity to hold all the
primary salt plus the amount of coolant salt that is in the heat-exchanger
shell; in a double-ended heat-exchanger tube failure, this much coolant
could drain inte the primary system. Fuel salt cannot enter the secondary
system rapidly because of the pressure differential between the two sys-
tems, and monitoring for fission products in the secondary coolant will
give immediate evidence of outleakage, so that the primary system can be
drained before much fuel salt is transferred. Consequently the cooclant-
salt drain tanks are simple tanks, with no special cooling provisions,
located in heated cells.

In addition to the primary drain tank, there is a fuel storage tank
into which the fuel can be pumped in case a repair of some part of the
primary drain tank system is required. This tank has a heat removal capa-
bility of only 1 MW since the salt can be held in the drain tank until
the radiocactive decay has reduced the heat load to this level.

Draining the Reactor

In normal circumstances, the primary system can be drained into the
drain tank through either of two plug valves in parallel. This arrange-
ment with two valves is, we think, sufficient assurance of an ability to
drain the system. The valve plug does not depend on a valve seat for
sealing, but is provided with a heating and cooling system for the seat
so that the final seal can be made by freezing the salt under the seat.
The valves, described in detail on page 51 of reference 99, are located
in the drain line leading from the low point of the primary system to the
top of the drain tank. For maintenance purposes, they are located in the
drain tank cell with an access plug in the shielding directly over them.

Leakage of Fuel Salt

 

If there is a leak in any part of the fuel system, the leaked salt
must be conveyed to the drain tank and its afterheat removal system. The
leaked salt is collected in a catch pan under the reactor which in turn
fm a em —

Br

270

drains into the drain tank pit. Here the salt enters a funnel-like drain
pan on top of the drain tank which directs the salt to a frangible-disk
valve which can be punctured on demand to drain the spilled salt into the
drain tank. No pipe comes below the catch pan so that unless the drain
tank leaks, all primary salt will positively end up in the drain tank.

To provide for the contingency of a leak in the drain tank, it is enclosed
in a secondary tank. Any crack or break in the drain tank would only leak
salt into the annular space between the drain tank wall and the surrounding
tank.

Afterheat Removal

The drain tank afterheat cooling load reaches a peak of about 40 MW
if the fuel is drained after the reactor is shut down from full power.
This load decreases with time, and therefore it is desirable to have the
cooling system operate over a very wide range of temperatures. We decided
to use NaK as the cooling fluid since it is liquid at the lowest tempera-
ture expected in the heat sink and has an acceptably low vapor pressure
at the highest expected temperature. The NaK is heated by radiant trans-
fer from thimbles in the drain tank to the NaK piping and is cooled by
radiant transfer from the NaK piping to thimbles in a water-cooled heat-
sink tank, thus providing isolating gas spaces between the fuel salt and
the NaK and between the NaK and the cooling water.

The NaK cooling system is circulated by thermal convection and, there-
fore, is independent of mechanical pumps and power supply. Enough water
is provided in the heat sink tanks to provide cooling for the first three
days after a drain if the water is allowed to boil. Thus, if the circu-
lation of water to the cooling tanks is interrupted, there is a three-day
period in which to restore circulation. There are sufficient NaK circuits
to permit adequate cooling if 20% of the circuits are inoperative.

Because NaK is a liquid at room temperature, the NaK circuits can be
filled at room temperature and will come up in temperature as the drain
tank is heated. This avoids any thermal shock that would result from
filling a hot system with cold Nak.

As mentioned above, the coolant NaK is doubly contained at the drain
tank end and at the water tank end. This feature is necessary since we
want to assure that NaK cannot contact either fuel salt or water. The
NaK can leak only into & controlled gas atmosphere.

0ff-Gas Separation and Cooling

In addition to providing safe storage and cooling, the fuel drain
tank also serves as a decay tank and entrainment separator for the gas
coming from the bubble separators in the primary system. Lines from the
bubble separators spray a mixture of salt and gas into the drain tank.
The liquid settles to the bottom by gravity and the gas passes on to the
off-gas system after sbout one hour residence in the drain tank. The
cooling system for the drain tank serves double duty by removing the heat
from the off-gas as well as cooling the drained primary salt. A further
 

 

 

 

 

271

feature of the use of the drain tank for off-gas cooling is that the coocl-
ing system is always in operation and so its performance is constantly
monitored.

Drain Tank Design

The drain tank conceptual design is shown in elevation in Fig. 8.5.
The tank, as shown, is dimensioned for a 300-MW(e)} reactor; however, the
system for the 1000-MW(e) breeder is exactly the same except it is larger
in diameter and has more coolant thimbles. The further details of the
design and the performance of these drain tanks, showing flow rates, tem—
peratures, dimensions, etc., are given in Ref, 113 and Ref. 99, pp. 45-47.
Also described there are the layout of the re-entrant NaK cooling lines
and the arrangement of the jet pumps for automatically returning to the
primary circulating system the salt that is carried in the gas from the
bubble separators.

A drain tank of the same principle was used successfully in the MSRE.
In this case, water was used in bayonet tubes mounted in the reentrant
tubes and the steam was condensed in a water cooled heat exchanger. This
system was used only for removing afterheat from the salt and was not for
off-gas cooling, Introducing water into the bayonet tubes during startup
of the system produced a thermal shock to the water tubes which was not
hazardous but would shorten the life of the tubes. For this reason we
chose NaK cooling in the MSBR drain tank design.

The NaK circuits are thermal convection loops, the hot leg being
heated by radiative transfer (with some gas conduction} between the
thimbles in the drain tank and the bayonet NaK tubes. The cold leg loses
heat by radiative transfer (plus some gas conduction) in pipes which run
through the water tank. The NaK circuits are completely independent, each
with its own expansion tank and control valves which can be used to regu-
late the heat removal and to isolate an NaK system in case of a leak.

Each NaK circuit penetrates the building containment and the drain
tank cell containment. At each penetration a bellows seal is used to pro-
vide for expansion of the lines during heat-up.

Each NagK circuit runs to one of three water tanks through which water
flows and is raised in temperature by 20°F. The operation of any two of
these water tanks will keep the thimble temperature in the drain tank be-
low 1400°F., We believe this is sufficient tec guarantee that heat is re-
moved safely from the drain tank.

The water tanks are cubes about 25 ft along an edge. Pipes run
through these tanks in two tiers at right angles to each other. There
are forty-eight 3-in. sched-10 tubes per row. Two tanks have 36 rows
of tubes and the third tank has 44 rows. They run through the tank wall
at each terminus. The water level is about 5 ft above the top row of
pipes in each tank to provide a water supply for emergencies.

Status of Technology

Many years of experience with liquid metals including NaK form the
background for the design of the drain tank.cooling system. The tempera-
tures at which we intend to use the NaK are well below that at which cor-
rosion is encountered.

As far as the heat load is concerned, the nuclear decay chains and
the energy released by them are well known. The standard energy release
rates have been used in making heat transfer calculations.

We have the MSRE experience, which, although on a very much smaller
scale, is nevertheless helpful in guiding the design of the primary drain
tank system. The experience in the MSRE should be directly useful in
scaling up for the power reactors.

Uncertainties

The only real uncertainty that we find in handling the drain tank
problem is that concerning the deposition of fission products. In the
MSRE, most of the noble metals adhered to metal and graphite surfaces, but
some appeared in the off-gas from the pump bowl (see Chap. 5). How much
of the noble metals will be extracted through the gas-stripping system in
an MSBR is uncertain. We have assumed that the noble metal particles and
their daughters and the daughters of the noble gases that enter the drain
tank will deposit uniformly on the surfaces there, but it is not clear
whether or not special provisions must be made to avoid locally high dep-
osition,

Evaluation

From the experience with the MSRE drain tank cooling system, we be-
lieve that the draim tank system proposed for the MSBR deals with the
afterheat problem in a dependable way. We think it represents a "walk
away" and fail-safe system, protected against everything but well planned
and executed sabotage. We have not strained the technelogy in this design,
and we believe that the unanticipated problems encountered in designing
and developing such a system will be minimal.

Fuel Salt Gas-Handling System

Purposes

The objectives of the MSR gas-handling system are:
1. Protect the fuel salt from an oxidizing atmosphere.

2. Minimize the poisoning of the reactor due to the noble gases and their
daughters — particularly xenon-135.

3. Provide positive containment of the radioactive noble gases and daugh-
ters and any other radioactive material stripped from the fuel salt.

In the conceptual design of the gas-handling systems for the refer-
ence design MSBR, the following criteria have been used.
274

1. Oxide concentration in the fuel salt is to be kept below 30 ppm to
prevent precipitation of U0, (see Chapter 5).

2, Target value for the poison fraction due to the noble gas fission
products and thelr daughters is 0.005,

3. Volume of fuel salt external to the reactor is to be kept to a minimum. ss

4. Fuel salt purge gas is to be recycled.

5. Off-gas system must be able to accommodate various forms of contamina-
tion such as noble metals, hydrocarbon decomposition products, or any
other particulates that may be carried by the purge gas.

6. No radioactive gaseous effluent is to be discharged from the reactor
plant.

7. Positive containment of all radioactive material must be provided for
all operating and accident conditions.

MSBR Gas System

Description. = In the reference design MSBR [100], xenon-135 and
other noble gases are stripped from the fuel salt by injecting bubbles
into a side stream of fuel salt taken from the discharge of the fuel salt Fe
pump as shown in Fig. 8.6. Just upstream of this point, bubbles contain-
ing noble gases are removed from the salt by the use of bubble separators.
This gas along with any salt entrained in it passes through a pipe di-
rectly to the drain tank [101]. In the drain tank, the entrained salt
is separated from the gas and returned to the main circulation loop by
jet pumps. The line running from the bubble separator to the drain tank
is provided with a siphon break to prevent drainage of the main loop in =
case of a pump failure. This siphon break is in the form of a loop that
rises above the liquid level in the pump bowl and has a venturi that com-
municates with the pump bowl gas space through a small pipe. During normal Bi
operation, the gas passing through the pump bowl is drawn inte the venturi

.and is discharged into the drain tank along with the gas-salt mixture flow-
ing from the bubble separator. i

In the drain tank, this gas has a residence time of the order of 1
to 2 hr to permit the separation of most of the particulate matter and
entrained salt and to greatly reduce the decay energy [102]. The gas is
then recycled through a cleanup system back to the bubble generator and wr
the pump shaft seals. Before the gas enters the cleanup system, a par-
ticle trap will be provided if the drain tank is not capable of separating
all the particulate matter and entrained fuel salt from the off-gas. The ws
gas then flows through charcoal beds having a 47-hr xenon holdup time that
is sufficient to allow most of the menon-135 to decay. Most of this gas
flows back te the bubble generator, but part of it is cleaned up further.
Figure 8.6 shows a gas compressor in the line of the gas flowing to the

bubble generator, but present efforts are being directed to developing a
bubble generator that does not require this compressor.

The gas being recycled to the pump seal purge passes through a char—
coal bed with a 90-day xenon holdup time and an off-gas cleanup system.
The additional charcoal bed is sufficient to allow decay of practically
all the noble gases except krypton-85. This gaseous isotope, along with
any tritium present in the off-gas, is removed and stored in the off-gas wa
cleanup system. Although not shown in Fig. 8.6, provisions will be made
to remove any oxygen or moisture that may be present in this recycled gas
stream. These provisions are in the form of molecular sieve beds to dry wi
the gas and titanium sponge beds to remove the oxygen. Makeup cover gas
would enter the MSBR fuel salt gas system just upstream of these beds.

Noble Gas Stripping. - The emphasis on the use of gas bubbles for
removing the noble gases from the MSBR fuel salt is because of the demon-
strated capability of bubbles to strip out these gases in the experimental ws
aquecus and molten-salt reactors that have been operated [103,104,105,106,
107,108]. Also, it appears that such a system would result in the smallest
fuel salt inventory when compared to other noble gas removal systems.

In molten-salt reactors with graphite moderator, the noble gases tend
to diffuse into the graphite and remain there until they decay or react
with neutrons. To limit this, methods are being developed to put on a py-
rolytic coating on the graphite (see Chapter 6). The gas-stripping system
must compete with this gas migration into the graphite effectively to re-
duce the MSBR poison fraction to an acceptable level. Small bubbles cir-
culating with the salt appear competitive because of their relatively Gr
large surface for core void fractions less than 0.01 [106].

Analysis of Noble Gas Stripping. — To evaluate the effectiveness of
the noble-gas-stripping systems, the poison fraction (ratio of the neu-
trons absorbed in the noble gases to those absorbed in the fissile mate-
rial} has been used as the figure of merit. Most of the gas system studies wo
{103,109,110,106] have had as their target the reduction of the poisoning
due to xenon-135 in the salt, graphite, and gas bubbles to 0.005. While
zenon-135 is the major individual absorber, the other noble gases and their dE
daughters would contribute additional poisoning. However, the extension
of an earlier study on the effect of the other absorbers in a two-fluid
reactor indicates that the additional poisoning would be less than 0.001
averaged over the 4-year life of the graphite when the xenon-135 poison
fraction is 0.005 [111].

Quantitative studies of the MSBR gas-stripping system used up to the
present time [110,112,106] assumed that the main fuel salt loop is az well wy
stirred tank having insoluble bubbles of gas of uniform temperature; pres-
sure, and size. The mass transfer coefficient for the gas migrating to
the bubbles was assumed to be uniform throughout the loop. The core was Co
divided into five regions with the mass transfer of the noble gas to each
graphite region being uniform. For the diffusion of the noble gases within
the graphite itself, the graphite was treated as a two-region slab, with
the outer region being the pyrolytic coating and the inner region being
the base graphite stock.

 
EE

 

277

A new calculational model that considers the effects of the gas sol-
ubility and variations in the temperatures and pressures throughout the
fuel salt loop has been developed. The purpose of this new model is to
check the assumptions used in the previous model and to make any necessary
modifications. Results using the new model are preliminary, however, and
it is too early to assess the differences in the results produced by the
two models.

Results from the well-stirred tank model [106] were correlated in
terms of a time constant defined as

Stripping rate = Li

where V is the main fuel salt loop volume, C is the isotope concentration
in the fuel salt, and 1 is the time constant. Figure 8.7 shows the contri-
bution of xenon-135 in the graphite and fuel salt to the poison fraction
for both uncoated and pyrolytic coated graphite. The contribution of the
xenon-135 in the gas bubbles to the poison fraction was about 0.0003 for
most cases that were studied since it was assumed that the purge gas enter-
ing the fuel salt system contained low quantities of this isotope. The
diffusivity and the porosity of the base graphite were assumed to be 107°
ft?/hr and 0.1, respectively. Increasing this diffusivity to 10™3 ft?/hr
had little effect on the results even when the graphite was uncoated,
since for uncoated graphite the migration rate of the noble gases to the
graphite is controlled by the adjacent salt boundary layer. A stripping
system having a time constant of about 30 sec (quite rapid) would be
required to reduce the xenon-135 poison fraction to 0.005 in a reactor
having uncoated graphite. Putting a pyrolytic coating on the graphite
permits us to use a stripping system having much longer time constants.
For example, Fig. 8.7 shows that a coating with a 1078 ft2/nr diffusivity
would require a stripping system having a time constant of sbout 300 sec
to limit the xenon-135 poison fraction of 0.005. The effect of the coat-
ing porosity on this was found tec be small. In this case, the rate of
migration from the salt into the bulk of the graphite is controlled by
the rate of the diffusion through the coating material.

The thickness of the pyrolytic coating for the cases shown in Fig.
8.7 was assumed to be 0.011 in. As shown in Fig. 8.8, varying the coating
thickness can have a great influence on the results. Here for a stripping
system having a time constant of 316 sec, decreasing the diffusivity of
the coating would allow a much thinner coating. The calculations also
showed that not cecating the graphite surfaces in the reflector and plenum
regions had a negligible effect on the core poison fraction.

For the bubbles to strip the noble gases, the migration rate to the
bubbles must equal the stripping rate. If the gas phase resistance to
mass transfer is negligible,

where hy is the mass transfer coefficient, Ay is the bubble surface area,
C is the isctope concentration in the salt, C, is the isotope concentra-

tion in the gas bubble, H is the Henry's law constant, R is the gas con-
stant, and T is the temperature. Assuming a bubble diameter of 0.020 in.,
and a mass transfer coefficient of 2.0 ft/hr, the time constants were
calculated for various void fractions and fraction of bubbles removed per
loop cycle. It was assumed that the gas being returned from the off-gas
system was essentially free of xenon-135. The results plotted in Fig.
8.9 show that a 0.2% circulating void volume and a 0.1 fractional bubble
removal rate gives a time constant of about 250 sec, Comparing this with
Fig. 8.7 yields a target xzenon-135 poison fraction of 0.005 if the graphite
has a pyrolytic coating 0.011 in. thick and 10-8 diffusivity. The knees
in the curves of Fig. 8.9 occur where the partial pressure of the xenon-135
in the gas phase becomes a significant resistance to the transfer of this
isotope to the bubbles.

When this resistance is not significant, the time constant © can be
approximated by the relation

b

where dj, is the bubble diameter and ¢ is the void fraction. This implies
that reducing the bubble diameter and/or increasing the mass transfer co-
efficient and the void fraction will reduce the time constant. It will
be seen later that the bubble mass—~transfer experiments indicate that for
the conditions in those experiments the mass transfer coefficient is pro-
portional to the bubble diameter. In this case, the bubble system time
constant varies inversely with the void fraction. However, as the bubbles
become very small, it is questionable that the bubble mass transfer coef-
ficient would continue to decrease with decreasing bubble diameter. If
this proves to be true, the bubble system time constant would decrease
with decreasing bubble diameter below some limiting size and could possibly
become very small.

The above calculations indicate that the fraction of the bubbles
removed per loop cycle and/or the off-gas recycle time could be smaller
than the values selected for the reference design MSBR since the bubbles
are far from being saturated with xenon-135. Because of the uncertainties
in the model, the parameters above were selected, but as further data and
experience are obtained, it may be possible to reduce these values. How-
ever, it should be remembered that there is some small increase in the
core poison fraction as the xenon-135 content in the bubbles increases.
Also the shorter recycle times in the off-gas system might not greatly
decrease the sum of the volumes of all of the charcoal beds since even-
tually almost all of the noble gases and their daughters will have to be
removed from the purge gas stream before it is recycled to the pump.

Iodine Removal. = Since most of the xenon-135 produced in a reactor is
produced indirectly by the decay of 6.7 hr half-life iodine-135, use of
sidestrear icdine strippers has been suggested as a method for minimizing
the poisoning in the MSBR [114,115]. The "effective" solubility of iodine,
defined as the ratio of the dissolved iodide concentration to the sum of
the partial pressure of the iodine and hydrogen iodide in the gas phase,
has been found to be a function of the salt chemistry as well as the
temperature. This "effective solubility is quite high, so stripping
the iodine with an inert gas stream would require very large quantities
of gas. However, adding hydrogen fluoride to the stripping gas stream
would oxidize the iodide and reduce its "effective" solubility. Of
course the stripped salt must then be reduced before it is returned to
the main fuel circulation loop.

The minimum rate that this fuel salt must be processed for iodine
and xenon to achieve various xenon-135 poison fractions in the reactor
with uncoated graphite are shown in Fig. 8.10. It can be seen that strip-
ping only the iodine from a side stream of the fuel salt is not sufficient
to reach the target poison fraction in the reactor. However, removing the
iodine with the xenon is very effective in reducing the poison fraction.
Therefore, if the graphite cannot be sealed, an iodine stripping system
might have to be used in conjunction with some type of a xenon removal
system in order to achieve a xenon poison fraction of 0.005.

Conceptual design studies were made of stripping units capable in one
case of removing 63% of the xenon and 6Z of the iodine from an 8% fuel
salt side stream, and in another case of removing 60Z of the iodine from
a 0.87 fuel salt side stream [115]. In both cases the atmospheric pres-
sure gas stream contains 1% hydrogen fluoride to oxidize the salt, and
the total gas flow rate through the stripping unit is zbout 80 ft3/sec.
The heat production rate of the stripped gases and thelr daughters along
with any removed noble metals was estimated to be about 6 MW(t). This
would imply a fairly sizable gas system and the drain tank could not be
used as a delay tank because of the presence of hydrogen fluoride in this
gas. The hydrogen fluoride could come in contact with the fuel salt that
is being pumped from the drain tank to the main circulating loop. Also
consideration must be given to removal of the afterheat in the event of
a failure in the gas circulation system.

Spray towers, venturi contactors, ramp flow units, and packed columns
have been considered for the stripper. All appeared to be feasible al-
though much development would be required for any one of them. They were
all fairly large units (roughly 10 ft high and 10 ft in diameter), but
the liquid holdup in mest of them was not excessive.

0ff-Gas Handling. — In the bubble stripping system, the purge gas
leaves the bubble separators and the pump bowls and flows directly te the
drain tank [116]. Since this gas contains many short-lived fission pro-
ducts, nonvolatile fission products including the noble metals, entrained
salt, and decomposed hydrocarbons or any other foreign material, much
attention must be given to the layout of the line discharging from the
bubble separators and the pump bowls. This is to assure that this line

will not become plugged with particulate matter and that it will not

overheat even under reactor accident conditions. Conceptual layout studies
indicate that this can be done.

To separate the particulates and the entrained salt and to remove
large amounts of energy generated by these materials and the radioactive
gas during the first decay period, a large vessel having a large volume
and heat sink is desired [117]. The drain tank appears to meet these
requirements and the off-gas is routed first to it. Here, as described a
earlier in this chapter, about 18 MW(t) of heat and most of the nonvola-
tile materials are removed from the gas stream. After an hour holdup,
the energy generation rate In the off-gas stream drops off by about two i
orders of magnitude due to the decay of the short-lived fission products.

Considerable attention must be given to the development of a draim
tank to assure that these aims are accomplished and things such as short
circuiting of the flow of the gas in the drain tank do not occur. Any
particulate material that is not removed from the off-gas in the drain
tank should be removed by a filter before the off-gas enters the charcoal
beds so that the gas flow through the beds will not be restricted by the ww
accumulation of foreign materials, Not much effort has been directed to
the design of a filter for this purpose in the MSBR. Probably sintered
metal would be used as the filter material and much attention would have
to be given to designing it so it can be cleaned or replaced and cooled
adequately at all times.

Noble Gas Absorption on Charcoal. - Dynamic absorption of the noble
gases in activated charcoal reduces the volume actually required to allow
the desired decay of these gases. The factor by which this volume can be Ga
reduced from that of an empty vessel or pipe varies from 500 at 80°F, to
50 at 250°F, and to 1 at 800°F. The capability of the charcoal beds for
removing the noble gases has been calculated from the computer programs
developed for the HRE~-2 and the MSRE [118,119,120,121]. Both of these
programs consider the effects of the gas and isotope flow rates, pipe
geometry, and temperatures on the amount of noble gases removed. A re-
vised computer program is now being developed, incorporating the informa- a
tion from the previous programs, that will optimize the design of the
charcoal beds on the basis of selected parameters. :

Heat generated in the charcoal beds was calculated by a computer i
program that considers the movement of the noble gases throughout the
off-gas system [117,122]. This code assumes that the nonvolatile daughters
of the noble gases remain at the location of their birth. Typical results
of this program are shown in Fig. 8.11.

This heat is removed from the charcoal beds by having the pipes con-
taining the charcoal immersed in closed tanks of water. Water is allowed
te boil in the 47-hr xenon holdup bed tanks with the heat being removed Gi
from the steam in a reflux condenser. However, the 90-day xenon holdup
bed must be kept cooler and the water in these tanks is circulated through
a cooling unit. Potential problems associated with removing heat this
way that have not been investigated thoroughly are the consequences of a
water leak into the charcoal beds and what happens if the cooling water

dundant parallel charcoal beds and cooling water systems is being con-
sidered.

Purge Gas Cleanup. — After the purge leaves the 90-day xenon holdup
charcoal beds, all the radionuclides have decayed to negligible values
except for the krypton-85 and any tritium present in the gas. It has
been proposed [122] that this gas flow through a cleanup system consisting
of a copper oxide bed to convert the tritium to 34,0 and low-temperature
(0°F) charcoal absorbers where the *H,0 and the remaining krypton and
xenon are removed. A compressor returns the cleaned gas back to the re-
actor through the pump seals, etc. These low-temperature charcoal beds
are regenerated periodically by passing part of the clean recycled helium
through them at 500°F. This helium stream then passes through a liquid
nitrecgen trap where the 31,0, krypton and xencn are removed and stored.
After gall of the radionuclides have been removed from the purge gas

  

stream, there might be some moisture or oxygen remaining in this gas stream.

Potential points of entry for these contaminants into the reactor system
could be impurities in the makeup gas supply or a small leak in one of the
charcoal beds. Molecular sieves at room temperature (“80°F) have been
used successfully to remove moisture from the fuel salt purge gas stream
[123]. These beds were regenerated periodically by purging them with

dry helium at 500°F. It also has been demonstrated that oxygen can be
removed from the fuel salt purge gas stream by passing it through titanium
sponge beds at 1200°F [123].

MSRE Gas Systems

Description. - Most of the experience of stripping noble gases from
molten salt reactors has been in the MSRE. In the MSRE, part of the fuel
salt was circulated through the pump bowl where it came in contact with
the inert cover gas [104,124,106]. Most of the fuel salt entering the
pump bowl was sprayed through the gas space into a pool of salt in the
pump bowl. It then returned to the main fuel salt loop through ports at
the inlet of the pump volute.

Fresh, dried, pure, inert purge gas (usually helium, sometimes argon)
entered the pump bowl mostly through the annulus between the pump shaft
and the shield plug, although small amounts of it entered through the
bubbler. (The method for removing any moisture or oxygen is that de-
scribed for the MSBR immediately above.) This gas then left the pump
bowl, carrying the noble gases and any entrained material, and passed
through a pipe having about 1 hr holdup time. From there it flowed
through a porous bed filter and valves and through another pipe having
about l-hr holdup time to an activated charceal bed immersed in water
and designed for a 90-day holdup of xenon. All the noble gases except
krypton-85 and any tritium that was present decayed to insignificant
levels in these beds. This gas then passed through absolute filters and
was discharged to the atmosphere through a 100-ft-high stack.

 

 

 

 
287

As the salt was jetted from the pump spray ring into the pool of
salt in the pump bowl, a large amount of the cover gas was carried into
the salt pool [104]. This gas formed bubbles which tended to coalesce
and float back up to the pool surface. However, some of these bubbles
were carried into the main fuel salt loop with the salt flowing into the
pump volute inlet at the bottom of the pump bowl. It was found that the
amount of gas carried into the fuel salt loop was a function of the gas
solubility, the salt chemistry and the pump speed, which determined the
velocity of the salt being jetted from the spray ring. The effects of
the salt chemistry are not understood fully, but the amount of gas carried
into the main loop changed significantly after the salt was processed to
change the fissile material and when beryllium was immersed in the salt
in the pump bowl.

Bubbles carried inte the fuel salt loop had a dramatic effect on the
amount of noble gases present in the MSRE [105,106,125]. Early experi-
ments on the spray stripper in the pump bowl indicated that it had an
efficiency of about 15% [126]. However, the reactor operation experience
indicated that the noble gases were being removed at a rate that implied
a much greater efficiency. It was found that the two parameters affecting
the amouht of xenon poisoning the most in the MSRE were the cover gas used
and the core void fraction. The experimental data are summarized in Fig.
8.12, where the loss of reactivity is about 0.8 of the xenon poison frac-
tion for the MSRE. It appeared that the circulating bubbles were quite
small, being in the range of 0.005 to 0.020 in., and that the stripping
efficiency of these bubbles in the pump bowl was 50 to 10CZ.

Analysis of Noble Gas Stripping. ~ The data in Fig. 8.12 did not
agree well with the values predicted by the well-stirred pot insoluble
gas model discussed above for the MSBR, particularly when helium was used
as a cover gas [106,125]. These calculations indicated that the poison
fraction would be a monotonically decreasing curve that is a function only
of the core void fraction and is independent of the cover gas used. Part
of the assumptions in this model had been checked experimentally. It pre-
dicted that the major resistance to the transfer of most of the noble
gases from the fuel salt to the graphite moderator would be the salt
boundary layer. A precritical experiment in which krypton was injected
into and subsequently removed from the MSRE fuel salt system indicated
that the mass transfer coefficients for the noble gases migrating through
the boundary layer adjacent to the core graphite were in reasonable agree-
ment with those predicted by theory [106,125]. Results of an analysis
of data obtained [127] from the measurements of the distribution of the
daughters of short-lived noble gases in samples of the MSRE graphite
showed that the diffusivities of the noble gases in the graphite agreed
with those used in the well-stirred pot insoluble gas model.

Since the well-stirred pot insoluble gas model did not describe the
noble gas poisoning of the MSRE adequately, a new model was developed to
describe this behavior [105, 106]. This model considered the solubility
of the cover gas in the fuel salt by dividing the reactor into four re-
gions, each containing a liquid and a gas phase. Bubble surface tension
effects were neglected and it was assumed that the bubbles in each region

 
288

were of uniform size and that their number was constant. Solution of the ht
relations derived for this model indicated differences in the void frac-
tion in different regions of the reactor, but these differences were not
a strong function of the bubble size. wd

Material balances then were written for xenon-135 and its precursors
iodine-135 and xenon-135m in these four regions using the void fractiom
distribution calculated by the relations described above. A large number
of calculations using internally consistent parameters were made to de-
scribe the noble gas poisoning in the MSRE. The reasonably good fit of
the calculated poison fraction to the measured values shown in Fig. 8.12
was obtained by use of one set of parameters. ss

Consideration of the solubility of the cover gas was not sufficient
by itself to obtain the agreement shown in Fig. 8.12. In addition, the
mass transfer coefficient for the xenon diffusing to the graphite had to
be reduced by about a factor of six, the bubble stripping efficiency had
to vary with the amount of gas ingested by the pump, and an additional
variable mechanism for xenon transport to graphite was required to produce
the maxima in the curves, (Direct interaction of bubbles with graphite
was postulated in order to provide a process amenable to mathematical
formulation.)

Using these same parameters to describe the transient xenon poisoning a
following a sudden power change in the MSRE did not accurately reproduce
the observed behavior. Thus the improved calculational procedure was not
a complete success. More work is necessary to elucidate the xenon be-
havior in the MSRE and to accurately predict the behavior in an MSBR.

Because of the shortcomings and the more complicated nature of this
improved model for the MSRE, the well-stirred pot insoluble gas model has
been used up to the present time to describe the MSBR noble gas behavior
in Figs. 8.7 through 8.9. Another argument advanced for using this sim-
plified model for the MSBR is that the gas bubbles in the MSBR will be
far from being saturated with xenon as compared to the bubbles being clese a
to saturation in the MSRE. So if the bubbles interact with the graphite
in the MSBR, it is postulated that they would not contribute as much to
the poisoning in the MSBR as they did in the MSRE. It is expected that .
the new computer program being developed for describing the noble gas
behavior in the MSBR will shed some light on this. However, more experi-
mental data probably will be required before this situation can be com-
pletely resolved. wr

 

0ff-Gas System Performance. — The MSRE off-gas system generally oper- a
ated satisfactorily although some nuisance type problems were encountered
[104,128,129]. The spray in the pump bowl produced a mist having con-
centrations similar to any ordinary mist. Some of the salt mist drifted PD
into the off-gas line at the rate of a few grams per month, and some of
the resultant salt deposits had to be removed at intervals of six months
to a year. Foreign materials, particularly those resulting from the fuel
pump lubricating oil leaking into the fuel salt found their way to the wi
control valves, flow restrictors, and filters. These items gradually be-
came plugged by these polymerized organics and they had to be cleaned
out or replaced periodically. This problem was corrected by installing i
new filters of a modified design [130, 131]. Considerable attention was

given in this design to the choice of the filter medium and to assure
that the heat generated by the decay of the trapped material could be
dissipated readily.

There was no breakthrough of activity in the charcoal absorbers and
their adsorption capacity was about as anticipated. Intermittent plugging
occurred at the inlet of the charcoal beds during the operation of the re-
actor. It appeared that this plugging was due to the accumulation of poly-
merized organic sclids. This trouble persisted to some extent after the
improved filter was installed presumably because organic material had ac-
cumulated in the off-gas system downstream of the filter. The entrances
to the charcoal beds initially were cleared by blowing helium back through
the beds to the holdup tanks. Later it was found that heating the char-
coal bed inlet lines to about 800°F was sufficient to restore unrestricted
gas flow.

Development Studies

   

Development studies to date have concentrated on systems in which
fission gases are stripped by bubbles circulating with the fuel salt. Ex-
periments have been directed to determining the rate of transfer of xenon
and krypton into the bubbles and to methods of getting the bubbles in and.
out of the fuel salt system. Data for mass transfer to small bubbles
flowing concurrently with a liquid are very limited. A study [132] of the
available literature indicated that the bubble mass transfer ccefficients
could be higher than those used in the analyses for the MSBR and the MSRE.
To see if this dis true; we are measuring the rate that oxygen is stripped
out of glycerine-water mixtures by helium bubbles flowing concurrently
with the sclution [133,134]. These fluids were chosen because the Schmidt
numbers are the same as those anticipated for the MSBR.

In this experiment bubbles are injected upstream of a test section
in a recirculating loop and then are removed downstream of this section.
The bubble size is measured using photographic techniques. Typical re-
sults that have been obtained in this experiment are shown in Fig. 8.13.
411 tests so far have been run in 2-in. tubing mounted horizontally and
vertically. The data for the vertical flow channel where the turbulent
inertial forces predominate over the buoyant forces and for the horizontal
flow channels were correlated by the relation

Sh = 0.34 Re0:%% 5¢0¢5 (ga /D)
vs

where Sh is the Sherwood modulus based on the pipe diameter, Re is the
Reynolds modulus based on the pipe diameter, Sc is the Schmidt modulus,
dyg is the Sauter mean bubble diameter, and D is the pipe diameter. For
the conditions studied so far, it can be seen that the mass transfer co-
efficient is directly proportional to the Sauter mean bubble diameter,
dyg. Pipe diameter, D, was included as a nondimensionalizing parameter
although neo actual variations in pipe diameter were made. In vertical

channels where buoyant forces become significant, it can be seen in Fig.
8.13 that the mass transfer coefficients pass through a minimum and tend
to approach the mass transfer coefficients for bubbles rising freely in
a liquid.

These results are a little surprising in that they are a little lower
than anticipated and show a direct dependency on the bubble diameter.

The reasons for this are not clear and more data are necessary. Additional
data are now being taken using another size test section, Extrapolation

of these results to bubbles in the fuel salt may introduce uncertainties
since the salt physical properties and chemistry are different from those
for the glycerine-water mixtures.

When first considering bubble generator concepts for the MSBR, it
was found that very little information was available in the literature
about this subject for systems similar to the MSBR [106]. This unit should
generate a uniform dispersion of bubbles over the pipe area to give the
desired void fraction and bubble size distribution. Also we decided that
we would attempt to develop a unit that would use the available gas supply
pressure, since we preferred not to design and build a gas compressor for
use in this environment. Both mechanical and fluid-powered generators
were considered. We decided that the fluid-powered type generator is the
best approach since no moving parts are involved. This led to the selec-
tion of a venturi type device in which gas is injected in the venturi
throat and bubbles are generated by fluid turbulence in the diffuser sec-
tion [135,106]. Teardrop" and "multivane" type bubble generators were
also tried and appeared to be capable of giving satisfactory performance,
but we believe that the venturi concept offers the greatest simplicity.
Tests on MSBE size venturi type generators using demineralized water with
and without the addition of surfactants, aqueous glycerine solutions, and
aqueous calcium chloride solutions indicated that the size of bubbles gen-
erated by this unit was not very dependent on the nature of the fluid.
However, a theoretical analysis indicates the diameter should vary as the
0.6 power of the ratio of the surface tension to density, (c/0)0:5, Ad-
ditional tests are in progress to verify this relationship.

A most important observation on these bubble generator tests in a
loop is that the bubble size in the loop is affected strongly by the hy-
draulics of the circulating pump and of the circulating system [136,1061.
The circulating pump in the test loop sheared the bubbles to a very small
size (about 0.001 to 0.002 in. diameter). These small bubbles coalesced
quickly in demineralized water, but not so quickly in the aqueous glyc-
erine and calcium chloride solutions. These observations indicate that
the effect of the pump on bubble size and the coalescence of bubbles must
be studied in fuel salt before the final design can be established for
the bubble generator.

The in-line centrifugal gas separator developed for the aqueous ho-
mogeneous reactor program showed great promise of meeting the MSBR re-
quirements [106,128,137,138]. These requirements are that the gas removal
efficiency must be high over a wide range of gas inlet flows, the pres-
sure drop must be compatible with the pressure drop available in the pri-
mary system, and the amount of entrained liquid in the gas removal stream
must not be excessive. Considerable effort has been directed to devel-
oping a MSBE size separator which has a 4-in. inside diameter and a salt
Cv— —— =

294

flow rate of 400 to 550 gpm [106,139,140,141,142]. Figure 8.14 shows the
test unit that has been developed that appears to give a suitably high
gas removal efficiency. This unit has a 44-in. separation length, a
tapered casing, and gas removal at both the swirl and recovery hubs.

The early test units performed well when using demineralized water,
but had poor gas separation efficiencies when using aqueous glycerine or
calcium chloride solutions with kinematic viscosities similar to that of
the MSBR fuel salt. We postulated that the higher kinematic viscosity
resulted in a reduced radial bubble velocity te the central void of the
separator and an increase in the effect of the fluid turbulence. The pump
produced much smaller bubbles which did not coalesce as readily in these
aqueous solutions as they did in the demineralized water and the smaller
bubbles were removed less efficiently. Increasing the length of this sep-
arator unit gave better separation but resulted in a vortex instability
that limited the amount of gas that could be injected and removed from
the test fluid. By tapering the casing and removing gas from inlet and
outlet hubs the separator was made capable of handling all of the antici-
pated liquid and gas flow rates.

To gain some understanding of bubble formation and coalescence in the
test fluids and in molten salts, a shaker test rig was built [142]. Trans-
parent capsules containing these liquids were shaken to given the desired
bubble size and void fraction. The shaking was stopped and photographs
were taken at frequent intervals to study the bubble behavior im the
liquid. Tests so far indicate that small bubbles coalesce very quickly
in demineralized water, but very slowly in aqueous glycerine and calcium
chloride solutions. A very significant void fraction of small bubbles
remained in these sclutions 20 sec after the shaking had stopped. In
tests using 66-34 mole % LiF-BeF, salt, the coalescence was not as rapid
as in demineralized water, but more rapid than in the glycerine and calcium
chloride solutions, The void fraction of small bubbles in the salt 20 sec
after the shaking had stopped was very small, indicating that there would
be better gas separation from the MSR fuel salts than from the calcium
chloride solutions. This indicates that the probability of thé present
gas separator giving the desired performance in the MSR fuel salt systems
is very high.

Effects of Unknowns and Uncertainties

 

If either the bubble injection and removal system or the graphite
sealing should fail to meet our design objectives, the zenon-135 poison
fraction would exceed the target of 0.005. The fissile inventory, the
reactivity shim requirements, and the breeding ratio would be adversely
affected. In the limit, if xenon~135 is not stripped at all from the
reference MSBR core, its poison fraction would be about 0.042 [111]. This
poison fraction would reduce the breeding ratio of the reactor from 1.06
to 1.02.

Although considerable effort has been directed to the development
and understanding of using bubbles circulating with the fuel salt for re-
moving noble gases from the reactor core, there is still much to learn
about their behavior. Bubble generators have been built and operated in

 
ee]

 

295

loops with aqueous solutions that have kinematic viscosities similar to
that of the fuel salt. The shearing of these bubbles into finer bubbles

by the pumps in the loops suggests that the bubbles in the MSBR fuel salt
will be smaller than we have assumed in our calculations. This observation
and the indications that bubbles circulating in the MSRE fuel were very
small led Ebasco to suggest that an elaborate bubble generator is not re-
quired for the MSBR [143,144,145]. Also these smaller bubbles would result
in a larger bubble surface area for a given void fraction and Ebasco sug-
gested that the desired low xenon poison fraction might be achieved without
sealing the graphite moderator.

We believe that we can generate bubbles in the fuel salt satisfac-
torily, but this still needs to be demonstrated. The shaker experiments
so far suggest that bubbles in the fuel salt will coalesce more readily
than those in the aqueous test solutions, tending to make the bubbles in
the fuel salt larger than those observed in the test solutions in the loops.

Smaller bubbles will provide a greater surface area for a given volume
of bubbles to compete for the noble gases in the reactor. Although the
bubble mass transfer experiments show that the bubble mass transfer coef-
ficient is proportional to Sauter mean bubble diameter over a very limited
size range, there are indications that the relationship does not extend
far outside the measured range. Consequently, it may well be that use in
the fuel salt of bubbles smaller than those in the experiments would result
in a higher rate of noble gas transfer. However, our present knowledge
does not provide proof for such a conclusion.

The bubble separator, like the bubble generator, has been developed
to operate satisfactorily in loops using the aqueous test solutions but is
yet to be tried in a molten-salt system. While we are quite confident that
it will give the desired separation in fuel-salt systems even with smaller
bubbles, it still has to be proven.

If for some reason any part of the bubble system does not work, some
sort of side-stream gas stripping unit would have to be installed in the
fuel salt system. The penalty for this probably would be a larger fuel
salt inventory, much larger amounts of gas would have to be handled, and
a gas compressor would have to be developed for use in a high temperature
and highly radicactive environment.

As discussed in Chapter 6, considerable success has been achieved in
putting pyrolytic coating on graphite, but a coating that reliably retains
its low permeability when irradiated has not been demonstrated. Although
we are optimistic that a satisfactory coating can be developed, we must
consider the consequences of failure to accomplish this goal. Also the
reduction in the cost of graphite would be substantial if it did not have
to be coated. As stated above, smaller bubbles might be able to strip the
noble gases from the fuel salt to the desired level even without the
graphite being sealed, but this must be investigated experimentally. In-
creasing the amount of bubbles in the salt to a core void fraction of 0.02
to 0.03 has been suggested as a means of limiting the poison fraction [143]
that might compensate for lack of graphite sealing. The 0.01 void fraction
selected by ORNL is not a firm limit, but it is believed to be reasonable
based on the MSBR design requirements and the MSRE operating experience
{146}. Also with 0.02 to 0.03 void fraction in the core the void fraction
in the salt entering the circulating pump would be around 0.10 which is
undesirable.

It was shown earlier that iodine stripping plus xenon stripping of
a fuel salt side stream has promise of achieving the desired poison frac-
tion even with uncoated graphite. This method has the several disadvan-
tages that were discussed, but it probably could be made to work. This
process probably would be more expensive than the bubble stripping system
and would require continuous oxidation and reduction of the sidestream and
careful monitoring of the redox condition of the fuel salt.

The fraction of the noble-metal fission products that will find their
way into the MSBR off-gas system is not certain; it has been estimated to
be from 5 to 35% on the basis of MSRE experience [147]. In any case, the
off-gas system must be designed to prevent this material from accumulating
in deposits that would restrict the gas flow or overheat parts of the
piping or equipment. The exact nature of this and other particulate matter
that could be carried into the off-gas system is uncertain, but use of a
filter on the drain-tank exit will probably be desirable to assure that
the operation of the rest of the off-gas system including the charcoal beds
is satisfactory.

Future Work

Work is continuing on extending our knowledge of mass transfer to
bubbles flowing in liquids. The bubble mass transfer experiments are now
being run using other size test sections in the experimental loop. Future
efforts are being planned to investigate mass transfer to bubbles in areas
simulating the highly turbulent regions in the reactor such as the elbows,
sudden expansions, and the pump volute. Attempts will be made to investi-
gate mass transfer to smaller bubbles. Because the present method for
measuring the bubble size is not capable of identifying very small bubbles,
either this method must be improved or another must be devised. Mass
transfer rates from the fuel salt to the bubbles will be determined in a
loop now being built and discussed below. We may have to be satisfied with
obtaining just the product of the mass transfer coefficient and the bubble
surface area in this loop if methods are not devised to measure the bubble
size in flowing salt streams.

Work also is continuing on studying the behavior of bubble generators
and separators under various flow conditions. Pressure drop, velocity,
and flow stability measurements are being made. New units will be built,
tested in the fuel salt test loop now being constructed, and modified if
necessary to obtain the required performance.

This fuel salt loop called the Gas Systems Technology Facility (GSTF)
[148,149] will be used for tests of the MSR fuel salt and off-gas systems.
In addition to the tests mentioned above we plan to investigate noble gas
mass transfer to graphite, the effect of the composition of the salt on
the various test results, the performance of the off-gas system components,
and the behavior of the noble gases and noble metals in this system.

Various components of the off-gas system that must be tested before
they are built and used in a reactor system include the salt mist separator,
filters, and units to remove and store tritium and krypton-85. Also tests
will have to be made to assure ourselves that we can satisfactorily predict
what will happen to the noble metals and any other particulate matter in
the off-gas system.

Overall Evaluation

Present evidence leads us to believe that removing the noble gases
by use of bubbles in the fuel salt is the best approach to achieve the
desired poison fraction in molten-salt reactors. Experimental data in-
dicate that we have a workable bubble generator and separator and that
the mass transfer rate of the noble gases to the bubbles is acceptable.
It may be shown in the future that turbulence in the pump impeller or
other parts of the fuel salt system could reduce the bubbles to small
sizes, but it is premature to assume that now. Use of smaller bubbles
may eliminate the need for sealing the graphite to achieve the desired
poison fraction, but this cannot presently be assured so work should con-
tinue on sealing methods.

Use of a side stream stripper to remove the iodine and xenon from
the fuel salt appears to be a feasible alternative for controlling the
noble gas poisoning, but is not as attractive as using bubbles unless it
is required for tritium removal.

Data are available to show that all the components in the off-gas
cleanup system are workable. Care must be taken jn the design of this
system to assure that particulate matter, radioactive and nonradiocactive,
does not accumulate anywhere in this system such that it would retard the
gas flow or cause overheating.

Although much development and testing of various parts of the molten-
salt reactor gas—handling system have been and will be done, the system
will have to be proved in an operating reactor. Many subtleties and
interactions affect the performance of this system, and a reactor is the
only place where we can demonstrate that they all have been considered.

Summary

The major uncertainties of a fundamental nature in the components
and systems for MSBRs are related to the provisions that must be made for
accomodating the widespread radioactivity and to the exact distribution
of fission products and associated heat production centers around the
reactor system. These uncertainties affect the mechanical design of many
of the components and systems such as the off-gas. Although the MSBE or
a first demonstration reactor would have to be overdesigned in many re-
spects, it should be possible to build and operate it safely and reliably
while obtaining basic information needed to optimize later plants. The
operation of such a reactor is an essential part of a program to provide
the technology for MSBRs.

A summary of the evaluation of the status of each of the important
components and systems is given below.

Operation of the pumps in the ARE, the MSRE, and in the large-scale
pump test loops demonstrated the reliability of the pump designs and the
present state of the technology for salt pumps. We know how to make
reliable short-shaft pumps having capacities up to 1500 gpm for use in
molten-salt reactors. Although it may take several years to produce the
larger pumps for intermediate- or full-scale MSBR's, the problems are well
298

understood, and there is little question that satisfactory pumps can be
cbtained on a schedule compatible with obtaining the other principal re-
actor components. The pump program will benefit from the LMFBR sodium
pump technology program because pumps for liquid metals and for molten
salts have many common requirements.

Our experience with over 11,000 hr of operation of an MSRE-scale
loop while pumping scdium fluorcborate and with the operation of the
smaller thermal- and forced-convection loops for material compatibility
studies have shown that we can safely handle the salt and that it is a
good candidate for the coolant salt for molten-salt reactors. Further
work is needed on methods for early detection of moisture inleakage, cor-
rosion product handling, and the migration of tritium within the coolant
system, At this time we can see no basic problems which would cause elim-
ination of sodium fluoroborate as the coeclant salt; however, there are
alternative salts that have only slightly less favorable characteristics.

The experience gained from the heat exchanger studies in the ANP
Program and from the design, fabrication, and operation of the heat ex-
changers and air-cooled radiator in the MSRE has shown that the molten
salts behave as conventional heat transfer fluids and that, except for
the enhanced heat transfer tubes, none of the uncertainties associated
with heat exchangers and steam generators are fundamental. All uncer-
tainties are related to engineering design optimization and to maintenance
and are considered to be resolvable in a reasonable fashion with an ad-
equately funded program of analysis and development. The review made by
the Molten Salt Group headed by Ebasco Services reached the same conclu-
sion. Another study devoted to steam generators now under way by the
Foster Wheeler Corporation is expected te result in conceptual designs
of steam generators for use with molten salt and to descriptions of the
development programs needed to produce them.

The studies of steam systems for use with molten salts conducted
by members of ORNL and Ebgsco Services have shown that the conventional
steam system of an existing modern steam power plant can be adapted for
molten-salt use by the addition of only three new components. These are
a reheat steam preheater in the intermediate-pressure-turbine circuit,

a mixing chamber for using prime steam for the final stage of feedwater
heating, and booster pumps for delivering this feedwater to the steam
generator. We found also that changes were needed in the startup system
to provide for the high liquidus temperature of the salt. Several options
are potentially available for the steam system for a moltem-salt reactor
plant, none of which involve fundamental uncertainties. All engineering
uncertainties are considered resolvable with an adequately funded program
of analysis and development.

The experience with the design, fabrication, and operation of control
rods and drives in the ARE and the MSRE provide information which will be
useful in the design of rods and drives for the MSBR. The major differ-
ence is in the need to operate the rods in the salt in the MSBR to provide
cooling and reduce the parasitic loss of neutrons. Control rods and
drives for LMFBR's have this design feature and much of the information
produced in developing them should be applicable to the development of
rods and drives for MSBRs. Although a thorough development and prototype
testing program will be required to assure adequate performance in a high

Si

 

po

 

 

 

 

299

temperature environment before installation in a reactor, we foresee no
fundamental difficulties in providing control and safety rods and drives
for MSBRs.

Valves for molten-salt systems have received very little attention
since the ANP program. Here again, there are enough alternative design
concepts available that an active program of selection and testing over
about 5 years should be able to produce the valves needed for the next
molten-salt reactor. In the meantime, the design studies and development
tests being conducted in the LMFBR program will provide additional basis
for the design of valves for molten-salt use.

Although much smaller in size, the MSRE drain tank is very similar to
that proposed for use with the MSBR and the experience acquired during the
MSRE operation provides some confidence in the design concept. The use of
NaK in an intermediate thermal convection system to transport the heat to
water is different but we believe that it is preferable to the more di-
rect water cooling of the MSRE tank, We believe that the drain tank system
deals with the afterheat problem realistically and that it is a safe system.
Information is needed on the detailed distribution of the deposition of
noble metals and noble gas daughters coming from the gas-handling svstem
before a design could be completed for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. We can see no
major difficulties in producing a design of a drain tank that will satisfy
the needs of the MSBE,

The effectiveness of the removal of 13%Xe by gas bubbles was demon-
strated during the operation of the MSRE. The presence of the bubbles
reduced the effect of xenon to below that originally calculated for the
spray chamber in the pump bowl, and later attempts to calculate the ef-
fect of bubbles also led to some underestimation of their effectiveness
in removing xenon. A model for calculating the xenon distribution in the
MSBR is still under development. When finished it is expected alsc to
be useful for further analyses of the MSRE results. Experimental results
from tests using water sclutions indicate that we have a bubble generator
and bubble separator that should work in the fuel salt. We believe that
the bubble stripping method is the best approach to achieving the desired

35%e poison fraction. The effect of bubble size on the mass transfer
rate of the noble gases to the bubbles is not completely defined and
further work is needed before it cam be decided whether coating of the
graphite is needed. Although much development and testing of various
parts of the gas-handling system have been and will be done, the system
will have to be operated in a reactor to demonstrate that all the impor-
tant problems have been solved.

9. CELLS, BUILDINGS, AND CONTAINMENT

E. S. Bettis

Requirements

The meclten-salt reactor plant differs from others in that large
amounts of fission products are dispersed throughout the reactor primary
system and several auxiliary systems. Much of the equipment and piping
must be preheated and held at 1000°F or higher to keep the salts molten.
Maintenance of the radioactive equipment must be accomplished through
shielding by use of remotely operated tools. Facilities must be provided
for the handling and storage of fission products discharged from the fuel
processing plant and for materials removed from. the reactor systems. Be-
cause of the differences, considerable attention was given to the contain-
ment requirements in the MSBR reference design and to a reactor building
and equipment cells that would satisfy those requirements.

The major criterion is that double containment be provided at all
times for equipment that contains the bulk of the radioactive liquids and
gases. The inner containment must remain sealed at all times when the
equipment therein is operating. The outer containment must also be sealed,
but controlled access through airlocks is permissible at any time when the
radiation levels are below the levels specified for human occupancy.

When maintenance of the doubly contained equipment is necessary, the
bulk of the radioactive fluids must be drained or purged from that equip-
ment and secured in tanks in other sealed cells. The inner containment
can then be unsealed and openings made as necessary to accomplish the main-
tenance. A degree of inner containment must be maintained by limiting the
size of opening and providing a flow of air inward through the opening.
Equipment that is removed must be withdrawn into casks for transfer to
repair, disposal, or storage facilities within the outer containment.
During all these operations the outer containment must be kept sealed.

All ventilation streams must be filtered, passed through absorbers, and
recycled where feasible. Gases that are discharged to the atmosphere may
contain only trivial amounts of fission product radioactivity.

Description

MSRE

These general requirements were applied in the MSRE, although less
stringently, because much less radioactivity was involved. The MSRE fuel
circulating system was installed in a reactor cell that was a steel tank
imbedded in concrete. The fuel drain tank system was similarly enclosed
in a steel-lined concrete cell. Salt-containing equipment in the cells
was enclosed in insulation that contained electric heaters to maintain the
salt above the melting point while the cell atmosphere was held to 150°F

309
310

by space coolers. The top closure of each cell was formed by a steel
membrane sandwiched between two layers of concrete shield blocks and
welded to the tank walls. The reactor and drain tank cells were inside
the reactor building. This building was a steel frame structure that
was covered with corrugated siding and lined with steel sheet to make
it moderately tight.

When the reactor was operating or maintenance was in progress, and
at most other times, the reactor building was closed and the interior
was kept at a slightly negative pressure by drawing air from the building
through filters and discharging it up a stack. During operation the at-
mosphere in the reactor and drain tank cells was maintained below 5 per-
cent in oxygen by admitting nitrogen and at subatmospheric pressure by
exhausting a small stream past a radiation monitor and up the stack.
When a cell was opened for maintenance, the size of the opening was
minimized and a flow of air into the cells was maintained by means of a
line from the cells to the building exhaust system. Materials removed
from the cells were withdrawn into casks or bags for storage in other
cells in the building or for removal from the plant. ‘The containment
system worked well and provided satisfactory protection for the public
and for plant personnel.

MSBR Building

The reactor building provides the outer barrier of the double con-
tainment for the equipment in the MSBR plant also. It is cylindrical in
shape with a hemispherical dome, is of monolithic concrete construction,
and is about 189 ft high and 134 ft in diameter. The entire building
rests on one concrete pad, and a metallic membrane encloses all parts of
the building in which radicactive materials are present. The domed build-
ing with 3-ft-thick concrete walls was specified to meet the accepted
requirements for reactor buildings regarding storm-induced differential
pressure and missiles.

During routine operation, the reactor building is maintained at a
pressure slightly below atmospheric by a ventilation system that recycles
the air through absorbers and filters and discharges a fraction up a stack
to compensate for a contreclled inflow of fresh air. Operating personnel
have access to the building at all times through airlocks except when
cells are open during some steps in maintenance operations.

Within the reactor building are three major levels. Under the hemi-
spherical dome is the crane bay area which is serviced by a heavy duty
polar crane with two traveling hoists. As described in ORNL-4541, the
major use of this area is for maintenance of equipment in the cells below
it. ‘

Beneath the crane bay and on the next lower level are located the
reactor cell, the chemical processing and off-gas cells (which extend
through to the bottom level), various hot cells for disassembly of failed
components, and space for the storage of radioactive equipment. The
bottom level of the building has the drain tank cell and the waste stor-
age cell. These cells constitute the inner containment of the double
containment system for confining the radioactivity to the plant.

 
311

MSBR Cells

All cells that contain radioactivity have thick concrete walls for
we shielding and are lined with metal to provide a tight containment. These
cells also provide a controlled atmosphere environment for the equipment.
The reactor cell and fuel-salt drain tank cell require both heating
a and cooling. They must be heated to about 1000°F before the reactor can
be filled with salt. Being able to cool them is useful for removing ra-
dicactive decay heat from the primary system after the salt has been
drained and for lowering the temperature before doing maintenance. For
this reason, these cells are lined with thermal insulation and have a
forced circulation closed gas system in which the gas can be heated or
cooled. The off-gas cell and the chemical processing cells have heaters
HE or coolers on the components themselves, and the ambient temperature is
maintained at about 100°F by space coolers.
Building the reactor and drain tank cells as ovens introduces sev-
si eral problems. The insulation must be able to expand and contract with
the heating and cooling of the cell and be effective for at least 30
years with little repair. Some equipment supports and restraints must
i» operate hormally at 1000°F but be able to accommodate occasional cooling
to 200°F. Reliable blowers must be provided to circulate the cell at-
mosphere. Industrial blowers are available for circulating gases in
ovens at temperatures up to 2000°F, but they probably will have to be
ES upgraded for reactor service. Special attention will have to be given
to penetrations through the cell walls and to disconnects for instrument
and service lines. For some service the inner ends of the penetrations
and the disconnects may be at high temperature. For others the penetra-
tions will terminate behind the imsulation at the inner wall of the cell
and be at low temperature. Some specially cooled thimbles may be required
to bring nuclear instrumentation close to the reactor vessel. Cooling
must be provided in the cell walls to remove the heat that passes through
the insulation and that is generated in the walls by nuclear radiations
in crder to keep the concrete at low temperature.
Ee The benefits, derived from installing the reactor equipment in ovens
as opposed to putting the insulation and heaters on the equipment and
piping are substantial. Insulating the walls is potentially much less
complicated and less expensive than providing many specially fitted and
remotely installable pieces around the vessels and piping. In the oven
the exterior surfaces of the reactor equipment are far more accessible for
remote maintenance and inspection and for installation of instrumentation.
“a The multitude of electrical cables and thermocouples and associated dis-
connects and penetrations that are required for individual pipeline and
vessel heaters are eliminated. Although the heating systems on the MSRE
worked very well, most of the penetrations, thermocouples, and service
lines and much of the complexity in the cells resulted from provisions for
heating the salt-containing equipment and coeling the air in the cells.
During operation the equipment cells are sealed and access is pro-

 

 

= hibited. When maintenance is required, the reactor is shut down and
drained and access is achieved by removing shielding blocks at the top of
the cells and cpening up sections of the steel membrane, as described in

Ey Chapter 12. When a cell is not tightly sealed, building air is drawn into

 
312

the cell, passed through absorbers and filters, and recycled to the re-
actor building or discharged up a stack. Radiation instruments monitor
this effluent gas to prevent release of activity outside the building.

The bottom of the reactor cell forms a catch pan which connects
through a line to the drain tank. Any break in the primary salt circuit
will result in the leaked salt being conducted to the drain tank. This
feature is discussed further in Chapter 8.

The steam cells are located outside the main building containment
membrane. This is to avoid any possibility of a steam leak putting pres-
sure on the containment structure. Because the secondary coolant is ra-
dioactive and toxic, these cells are also sealed when the equipment is
operating.

Status and Uncertainties

The general design of the reactor containment building for an MSBR
can follow the design that has come to be rather standard for nuclear
reactors, and no unusual construction techniques seem to be involved in
building the cylindrical shell or the various cells. Heating the reactor
and fuel drain tank cells in order to handle the high melting point of
the salt, however, is unique.

The method employed for heating requires no inventions and should
have minimal troubles. The uncertainties mainly relate to the method of
insulating the cells and making the penetrations, and, as discussed in
Chapter 13, the way to support the reactor components in the hot cell
and to restrain them against seismic forces. No limiting problems are
foreseen, but the designs remain to be fully worked out. A considerable
amount of development will be needed in proving the design. The MSRE
approach of separately insulating and heating the components can be
adopted if the difficulties of using the cells as ovens prove to be too
great. Scaling up the MSKRE method for an MSBR would require much devel-
opment and testing also.

Top shielding plugs that are removable for maintenance access were
used successfully in the ARE, HRE-2, and MSRE, and a sealing membrane was
used in the same general way at the HRE-2 and MSRE. Flow of air into the
cell through openings was also used to prevent the dispersal of radioac-
tivity during maintenance. Larger cell openings will be required on an
MSBR, the amounts of activity in the system will be greater, and the re-
strictions on discharge of activity will probably be tighter. Methods
and equipment will have to be developed for sealing openings around work
shields and tools to provide better shielding against radiation and to
restrict the required air flow to rates that will not require excessively
large absorber and filter banks.

313

Evaluation

No unusual problems appear to relate to providing a containment
building for an MSBR, but the proposal in the ORNL reference design to
use the reactor and fuel-drain tank cells as ovens for preheating the
equipment -to about 1000°F is unique. Detailed designs are needed and
development and testing will be required to determine whether all design
requirements can be satisfied in this approach. If they cannot, a return
to the MSRE concept of separately insulated and heated components can be
adopted.

The double containment afforded by the reactor building and the
equipment cells should give good control of radioactivity during normal
operation or accident conditions. The containment provided by the re-
actor building should give satisfactory protection to the public against
releases of radioactivity during maintenance operations. Careful design,
well developed equipment and procedures, and careful use of a controlled
ventilation system will be required for protection of plant personnel
during maintenance. The MSRE afforded experience with all of these on
a small scale and there is similar experience from other reactor plants
and from fuel reprocessing plants.

Design, development, and testing will be required, but no problems
are evident that might prevent satisfactory containment structures and
attendant service systems from being provided for an MSBR.

10. PLANT CONTROL AND INSTRUMENTATION

8. J. Ditto and J. L. Anderson

Requirements and Current Concepts

Systeme for Normal Operation

Normal operation of an MSBR includes all phases of startup from
cold or hot standby conditions, production of electric power at demanded
loads between 20 and 100% of design capability, and scheduled shutdown.

The control systems must recognize the different requirements for
the various operating modes and establish and maintain safe and appro-
priate operating conditions. The systems must coordinate the operation
of the reactor, the primary- and secondary-salt lcops, the steam genera-
tors, and system auxiliaries. In general, the load demand is the primary
signal to which the control subsystems must respond. However, while
matching the power generation with the load, the control system must
maintain system temperatures and their rates of change within acceptable
limits. Specific areas of concern are the temperature of the steam at
the turbine throttle, the rate of change of temperature in the salt loops,
and the salt temperatures, which must be maintained well above the freez-
ing point throughout the circulating systems (with the possible exception
of some areas in the steam generator).

The present concept is to control the nuclear power generation by
graphite rods, which are used in an automatic control loop to maintain
reactor temperature at a set point programmed according to the needs of
the steam system. This arrangement is a variation of a scheme success-
fully demonstrated on the MSRE, where the temperature set point was
controlled by the operator. Such a control system makes the reactor
power slave to the load, with a temperature base line independently
determined to provide steam at the desired temperature.

Maneuvering from one power level to another requires control of
steam temperature during the transient. The current concept involves
automatic control of secondary salt flow rate through the steam genera-
tor to take advantage of the thermal capacity of the salt while the
reactor power level is being readjusted to the new requirements.

In the multiloop plant, such as the reference MSBR, the control
system must adequately respond to loop interactions. The most satis-
factory approach appears to be one in which each loop is controlled as
a unit to produce a specified amount of steam under well-defined condi-
tions, with the balancing of the loops under the control of a master
programmer — perhaps a digital computer — that is responsive to the
needs of the power grid. This programmer would adjust set points on
appropriate closed-loop controllers associated with the coolant loops.

The control system requirements of an MSBR are basically the same
as those of other power reactors. However, they do differ in some
detail. These differences will be discussed later.

315
316

Emergency Systems

In addition to providing normal control functions, the instrumentation a
and control system must provide protection against a variety of anomalous
or accident conditions. Although the entire control system should con-
tribute to safe and orderly operations, there is always a system dedicated
to protection of personnel and to the prevention of major equipment damage.
This system, the plant protection system (PPS), includes monitoring
instrumentation to detect off-normal conditions, logic subsystems to
make decisions and initiate corrective actions, and actuators to effect wa
process control actions.

The plant protection system must be capable of shutting down the
plant when necessary and carrying out other protective functions, such i”
as insuring that systems are in order for containing the radioactivity
in the event of a major accident and the removal of afterheat following
an emergency shutdown where normal cooling is impaired.

Whereas the control reds will be graphite partially inserted into
the core so that positive and negative reactivity changes can be made,
the safety rods will be neutron-absorbing poison rods of considerably
more reactivity worth. Because of their effect on neutron economy and wi
breeding, the safety rods probably will be normally withdrawn out of the
active core region. However, in some normal circumstances, having the
safety rods partially inserted for a short time may be desirable. There-
fore, continuous adjustment of their position must be possible.

It is not clear at this time that a fast "scram" capability will be
required. The prompt negative fuel temperature coefficient plus the
considerable thermal capacity of the salt and graphite are factors which a
make the plant less sensitive to reactivity excursions {see Chapter 14).

However, only detailed analyses of a particular plant design will estab-
lish the precise requirements of the PPS. 5

Instrumentation : i.

The operational control systems and the plant protection system will
require extensive instrumentation to provide input intc the automatic
decision-making process of control. Measurements of neutron flux levels, a
as well as of the nonnuclear variables such as flow rates, pressures,
temperatures, etc., will be vital to effective control of the plant.

Some instrument sensors and signal transmission lines, and possibly some di
containment penetrations will be required to operate reliably in hostile
environments of high temperature, high radiation levels, or both. The
high residual radioactivity in the reactor cell will make direct mainte-
nance impossible in many locations, so accessibility of instrument com-
ponents for remote disconnect and replacement will be necessary.

In general, conventional electronic or pneumatic signal conditioning
equipment can meet the needs of the MSBR. However, the size and complexity a
of the plant will make it highly desirable to use digital computer tech-
niques for multiplexing, data storage and retrieval, calculation, and
other functions. Optimization cf the plant output will require develop- i
ment of sophisticated control schemes. A high degree of automation and
 

 

 

 

 

317

supervisory control will be necessary in the MSBR, as in any large multi-
loop plant, because of the large number of interacting processes. Use

of automatic control loops for a large number of process control functions
is commonplace; however, the integration of these into effective system
control is often left to the operator. Significant improvements in oper-
ation can be achieved if overall system control is highly automated using
well-established techniques.

In addition to those instruments necessary for direct control of the
plant, there must be a large number of instruments for monitoring plant
failure detection instrumentation, and the usual complement
of instruments for surveillance of the general health ¢f the plant and
for management evaluation of plant operation.

Features Peculiar to MSBR

 

A number of features which are peculiar to the MSBR affect the
instrumentation and control system requirements.

The high freezing points of the MSBR fuel and coolant salts impose
rather stringent control and protection system requirements. Care must
be exercised to prevent freezing of the salt in auxiliary lines, as well
as in main salt lines and heat exchangers [1, pp. 122-123]. The filling
and startup procedures, although simplified by the oven concept, will he
somewhat complex, as will be the procedure for admitting feedwater into
the system [1, pp. 123]. Reliable instrumentation must be provided for
determining the condition of the salt when it is outside the reactor
vessel as well as within.

The effects of fuel circulation on the effective delaved neutron
fraction must be considered in designing for transient conditions involving
primary system flow changes. As discussed in Chapter 4, these effects are
well understood, and experience in the design and operation of circulating
fuel reactors gives confidence that this feature will not cause any par-
ticular problem.

Fission products in the primary circulating loop present the usual
problems of handling radioactive fluids. The presence of these highly
radioactive loops also has a potential for increasing unwanted background
signals in nuclear instrumentation. Replacement of instrument sensors
and interconnecting signal lines will in some cases require remote mainte-
nance techniques.

The reference MSBR is designed to have a core differential tempera-
ture of 250°F. As in other reactors operating with a large AT, means must
be provided to limit thermal stresses during abnormal operational events.

The MSBR does not require that a large amount of excess reactivity
be available. The ability to adjust fuel concentration during operation
and the reduction of 135%e poisoning by gas stripping reduce two of the
largest reactivity requirements of other types of plants. Total control
reactivity required for operation will probably be on the order of 1%
8k/k. This small amount of excess greatly reduces the potential for
large reactivity excursions, thus easing requirements on safety rods.

The ability to drain the fuel away from the moderator into a noncritical
configuration is a very important feature of the molten salt reactor con-
cept. The intent is not to use the fuel drain for fast shutdown but to
318

assure long-term shutdown margin under unusual circumstances, so fast-
acting drain valves are not required.

The reference design MSBR has the entire primary salt system in an wg
oven where the temperature is maintained at about 1000°F. This arrange-
ment makes it unnecessary to insulate the pipes and vessels and removes
from the reactor cell a multitude of electrical cables, thermocouples,
disconnects, and containment penetrations that would be required for
heaters directly on the pipes and vessels. Some connectors and signal
transmission lines must either be designed to operate properly in such
an environment or must be located in penetrations that are cooled re- “a
liably. .

Experience with the MSRE and Other Facilities

A large number of out-of-pile and in-pile loops and other facilities
have been operated with melten salt at ORNL over the past 20 years, and
all of these have had instrumentation and control systems of varying
degrees of complexity. In addition, we and others have operated high- wd
temperature systems containing molten metals or gases, and a number of
reactors of these types have been operated in the U.S. and abroad.

Although these have provided some experience in instrumentation that is Ga
applicable to MSRs, the most direct and useful information has come from
the operation of the MSRE [2].

Successful operation of hundreds of thermocouples attached to the
salt system walls in the MSRE gives confidence that reliable temperature
measurements can be made at the elevated temperatures of molten=-salt
reactor systems. Although there was considerable scatter in the readings
of the couples under different heaters when the salt was actually iso- Eo
thermal, techniques of biasing the outputs were used to provide thoroughly
acceptable measurements [3, pp. 22-24]. The importance of careful selec-
tion and calibration, details of fabrication and installation, and strict co
quality control was evident, as only 12 of the 330 thermocouples failed
during five vears of operation.

Pressure and differential pressure measurements in the coolant salt
systems were made using NaK-filled transmitters. No direct measurement
of salt pressure was made in the primary system, where gas pressure mea-
surements were used to infer salt-system pressure. Direct measurements
are desirable in an MSBR, and additional development may be required for EE
such applications.

The measurement of salt flow rate in the secondary system was made
by means of a venturi and a NaK-filled differential pressure transmitter.
No direct measurement was made of flow in the primary system. Inasmuch
as the reactor was operated with constant primary-salt flow rate, no par-
ticular problem existed in normal operation. As part of the plant pro-
tection system instrumentation, pump motor current was measured. Though a
not a precise indication of flow, this measurement plus pump speed gave
adequate assurance of flow. That is, the pump motor current would be
less than normal even though the speed was normal if for some reason the

 
319

Sh

salt flow was reduced. Direct measurement of the flow in the primary
system would be desirable for a power reactor, especially if variable
sa flow is used.

Level measurements were made with single-point prcbes as well as
bubblers and float level systems. These operated very well over the
life of the plant, but each has limitations which may necessitate addi-
tional development for application to MSBR service.

Containment penetration cable seals were difficult and costly to
install, and their performance was marginal [2]. In the furnace concept
Ei] of the MSBR it will be desirable to locate the seals in thermally insu-

lated areas.
In addition to valuable experience in instrumenting molten-salt sys-—

i tems, the MSRE gave an opportunity to verify methods of analysis of the
dynamics of circulating-fuel reactors. The operation with 2337 was
particularly interesting because of the unusually small effective delayed

. neutron fraction (Bgeg = 0.0019). Analyses and tests made prior to load-

ing 2337 into the MSRE gave confidence that the system would be well be-
haved with regard to stability and controllability [4, pp. 32-35; 5, p. 44].
Results of tests performed after loading were in good agreement with the

Ee predictions [6, p. 9].

The MSRE rod controller was designed to make the reactor operate in
a load-following, or reactor-slave-to-load, mode in the power range. In
this mode the operator selected the desired temperature of the salt leav-
ing the reactor core, and the steady-state reactor power was determined
by the rate at which heat was rejected by the air-cooled heat exchanger
in the secondary salt system. From an experimental viewpoint this allowed
easy automatic control of temperature and power level, with practically no
interaction between them. For a power reactor this scheme has the poten-
tial for controlling steam temperature independently of power level. The
controller used on the MSRE combined many features commonly used at ORNL
to meet the specific requirements of that reactor. Its performance was
good, as predicted by analysis, and encourages us to use such a controller
as part of the overall MSBR plant control system.

The digital data collecting and computing system for the MSRE was
used extensively with excellent results. The overall availability

after an initial debugging period was over 95% [7, p. 55]. The system

a proved invaluable for the timely and economic collecting, logging, and

analyzing of experimental data generated by the MSRE. In addition, it
was used to provide operator guidance through the standard printout of
signals in the form of routine periodic logs, alarm signal printout,
routine calculations such as heat balance and reactivity balance, and
operator—demanded functions and calculations. It was used extensively
for the control and instrumentation of reactor dynamics tests, such as
frequency response and temperature response experiments [8], for retriev-
ing and processing data previously stored on magnetic tapes for analysis,
and to provide information relative to the time, cause, and effect of

k= abnormal operating events. Programs were developed to aid in calibra-
tion of analog systems and in diagnosis of troubles. A new program was
developed for a fast Fourier transform which was programmed to run on

i line in background time and which was used routinely for on-line analysis
of neutron fluctuation data. By use of this program it was possible to
monitor the bubble fraction in the fuel salt [9,10].

320

The overall experience with the computer system was excellent and
demonstrated the tremendous value of such a system in a complex plant.

We consider a comprehensive data collecting and computing system for an
MSBR to be indispensable.

Many features of the MSRE created special instrumentation and control
problems which were solved in unspectacular ways. Monitoring of freeze-
valve status, manipulating helium flow and pressures to transfer salt, and
other similar problems were solved and valuable lessons learned. These
are described throughout the referenced literature.

MSRE experience was valuable in demonstrating that most of the unique =
instrumentation and control problems associated with circulating fuel re-
actors are amenable to solution with familiar techniques. Those problems
which were not solved or which were circumvented due to limited time or
funds will be easier to resolve for MSBR applications by the insight
gained from MSRE operation.

 

Control Analyses

Preliminary studies of startup, standby, and shutdown procedures
have been carried cut on the reference design MSBR, although only to
the point of determining feasibility. In making these analyses, several
basic restraints on operation of the plant were recognized. The freezing
temperatures of the primary and secondary salts are such that the salt
systems must be filled and circulating isothermally at 1000°F before
power withdrawal can be initiated by decreasing the coclant-salt tempera-
ture. To aveid freezing of the salt and to prevent excessive temperature
gradients, the minimum feedwater or steam temperature to the steam genera-
tors for the reference design system must vary between 1000°F at zero wi
load and 700°F in the 8 to 100% power range. In addition, the afterheat
lead in the reactor system, which decays slowly, possibly requires that
the feedwater and heat rejection systems remain in operation following
shutdown of the main steam system.

Most of the special systems and equipment needed to handle the start
up and shutdown conditions in an MSBR station are therefore associated
with the steam-power system. The requirements impose some departure from t=
the equivalent systems used in conventional fossil-fired supercritical-~
pressure steam plants and will require further study. Different steam
generator designs, for example reentrant or concentric-tube types, would
not require heating the feedwater as hot as 700°F, and would alter the
steam plant arrangement (see Chapter 8). 4n auxiliary boiler is neces=-
sary for startup from the cold condition.

The proposed general arrangement of the steam system of the MSBR
reference design is described in the design report [1, Sect. 5] and in
Chapter 8 of this report.

 

 

 
 

 

 

321

Computer Models

   

The dynamics and control studies of MSBR plants have been concen-
trated about the normal operating power range, and a series of studies
has been made to examine these operating characteristics [11,12]. The
studies have been implemented with analog and hybrid computer simulations
eof the plant characteristics [13,14]. All of the simulations have been
patterned after the MSBR reference design [1], but the nature of the
models is such that they would have general applicability. For the pur-
pose of these analyses the MSBR plant consisted of a graphite-moderated,
circulating-fuel reactor, a shell-and-tube heat exchanger for transferring
the generated heat to a secondary coolant salt, a shell-and-tube super-
critical steam generator, and several pessible control systems.

Due to the very nonlinear nature of the once-through steam generator,
it was deemed necessary to have a highly detailed model of this part of
the system. To get a feel for overall plant performance, the earlier
models used lumped-parameter, log-mean-differential-temperature analog
simulation of the steam generator, although the accuracy was known to be
severely limited. At the same time, a hybrid digital-analog model was
developed and used initially to examine the stability of the steam gener-
ator [15]; subsequently, it was expanded and refined at the newly acquired
ORNL hybrid computing facility. The hybrid model of the steam generator
was combined with the analog model of the other plant components, resulting
in an overall simulation in which considerable confidence could be placed.
Representative transient responses using this model are described in Ref-
erence 14.

The general validity of the all-analog models was confirmed, although,
as expected, some disagreement in absolute values exists, The trends indi-
cated in the analog studies are correct, but the magnitude and rates of
change of variables during transients should be used only as general guides.

The hybrid model has been used to study control schemes and normal
plant maneuvering. Some more severe transients were examined to get a
feel for system response to abnormal situations. The severity of the
transients that can be run on the hybrid simulation model is, however,
somewhat limited by the steam generator model, which uses 0.5-~second cal-
culational time steps. Consequently, an effort is underway to improve
the accuracy of an analog steam—generator model so that its greater speed
capability can be used to study severe transients and complement the
plant safety analysis.

Analysis of Steady-State Conditions

The first step in the formulation of a control system to enable the
plant to undergo changes in load was to determine the steady part-load
temperature and flow profiles for the plant between 20 and 1007.

For initial considerations it was desirable to fix or predetermine
the steady-state values of some variables for part-load operation. Tur-
bine limitations require that the turbine throttle temperature be held
nearly constant (1000°F for the cases studied), and the feedwater temper-
ature was held constant as well (700°F). The primary salt flow rate was
assumed constant at design point for steady-state considerations. With
322

these limitations imposed, we found that the secondary-salt temperature
at the steam generator outlet could not be held above the salt freezing
point at part loads below about 50%. A need is indicated for more effec-
tive decoupling of load effects on salt temperatures. Some possibilities
are: (1) allowing the steam temperature to increase above its 1000°F
design point as the load decreases, with subsequent attemperation of the
steam with injected feedwater; (2) increasing the feedwater temperature
above its 700°F design point as the load decreases; (3) reducing the
number of steam generators in use as load decreases; and (4) using a salt
throttling valve tc bypass some of the secondary-salt flow around the
primary heat exchanger to reduce the temperature of the salt entering

the steam generator. Steam attemperation and secondary salt bypass were
the subject of additional steady-state analysis of the plant concept.
Either scheme or a combination of the two appears to permit the estab-
lishment of acceptable part-load operating conditions.

Analysis of Transient Behavior

 

The models described have been used for transient analysis of the
plant and proposed control schemes.

The power operating range for a typical plant is expected to be from
approximately 20% to 100% of full design load. Throughout this load range
the steam temperature to the turbine throttle must be held essentially
constant, the primary- and secondary-salt temperatures and flow rates must

be kept within acceptable limits, and the resulting stresses due to induced

thermal gradients must remain within acceptable ranges.

A master load programmer may be needed to divide the required load
demand among the multiple coolant loops and steam generators. It should
be possible to operate the plant at partial loads by operating some loops
at 100% capacity while other loops deliver no power. The control studies
have shown that stable plant load control may be accomplished using two
basic control loops: a steam temperature controller and a reactor outlet
temperature controller. To achieve close control of steam temperature
during load transients it is necessary to vary the secondary-salt flow
rate in the steam generator. An additional control subsystem may be
necessary if a salt bypass valve is used in order to maintain the desired
coolant salt temperatures. The reactor outlet temperature controller
examined was similar to that used successfully on the MSRE [16, p. 228].

A load demand signal determines the reactor outlet temperature set
point. The measured reactor inlet temperature is subtracted from the
reactor outlet temperature set point, and since the primary-salt flow rate
is constant, a reactor power set point is generated by multiplying this
AT by a proportionality constant. The measured value of reactor power
(from neutron flux) is compared with the reactor power set peint, and any
error is fed to the control rod servo for appropriate reactivity adjust-
ment. The reactor power set point, generated from the outlet temperature
set point and the measured reactor inlet temperature, is a function of
the reactor inlet temperature during a transient and thus a function of
dynamic load.

 

 

 
 

 

 

 

 

323

There are certainly other possible control schemes for achieving
satisfactory plant performance. Analog simulations have shown that an
integrated control scheme is essential to good performance. If exces-
sive thermal stresses are produced by the transients that accompany load
changes, they can be reduced by varying the primary salt flow rate as a
function of load.

The small isothermal temperature coefficient of reactivity (see
Chapter 4) implies that only modest amounts of control reactivity are
needed to accomplish plant load maneuvering. For the reference design,
a typical maneuver from 50% to 100% power at a rate of 5%/min required
6.05% ok/k and a rate of 0.0001%/sec 8k/k. The maximum system tempera-
ture rate of change for this transient was about 0.3°F/sec at the reactor
outlet.

Accident Analyses

The most likely abnormal power excursions would result from sudden
changes in load demand or rapid changes in salt flow rate in either the
primary or secondary system, as a result of pump or power failure. A few
limited cases of this type have been examined on the hybrid simulation.
Some less-likely reactivity anomalies were also briefly examined on the
hybrid model. As discussed in Chapter 4, conceivable reactivity changes
may result from primary flow variation, fuel addition accidents, core
geometry changes, or failure of one or more control rods.

A reactor shutdown or protection system must be coordinated with the
salt circulation loops and the steam plant. If the load is suddenly lost,
the reactor power generation must be reduced toc avoid overheating.
Similarily, if the reactor is shut down the steam load must be quickly
reduced to avoid subcoeoling or freezing of the salt. Similar situations
arise due to salt circulation pump failure. For example, if primary flow
is lost, followed by an appropriate reduction in load demand and reactor
power, the primary salt could still freeze in the heat exchangers because
of the increased dwell time unless secondary flow is also reduced.

The plant emergency procedures clearly will be somewhat complex be-
cause of the high salt freezing temperatures, and a careful analysis will
be needed to derive satisfactory solutions.

Reactivity Control

Long-term reactivity adjustments are expected to be accomplished by
varying the fuel concentration. Normal regulating and shimming functions
for load following and shutdown are within the calculated capabilities
of a few graphite rods, as proposed for the reference design [17, p. 64].
Some events may be anticipated that would require additional negative
reactivity or reactivity rates beyond the capability of the graphite rods
alone. Poison rods could be used to provide this additional reactivity
control and to provide substantial shutdown margin. Having poison rods
in the core during normal operation is undesirable because of their
adverse effect on breeding. The probable role of the poison rods, then,
is to be held outside of the core, poised for rapid shutdown if needed.
324

They may also be used for additional shimming during core loading or for
other operations or abnormalities but the exposure at power will be short
and the effect on breeding and rod life will be small. We do not presently
anticipate that extremely fast insertion, or "scram," of the rods will be
necessary, although reliable insertion must be assured.

Instrumentation

High-Temperature Flux Sensors

 

In the reference MSBR, the entire reactor cell will be at about 1000°F.
Thus any nuclear detectors which are located in this space must be capable
of operating at such high temperature or else they must be cooled. No
detectors are presently available for operation above 600-900°F, and even
for these temperatures only special developmental models exist. Similar
problems exist in the liquid metal breeder reactor program, and some
development work is being done, but no significant progress has been an-
nounced [18]. A coordinated detector development program is needed for
the Molten-Salt Reactor Program.

It may be possible to locate ionization chambers in specially cooled
wells or thimbles located outside the reactor vessel. For use in the
reactor protection systems, such chamber wells would have to be designed
with performance reliability as required of the protection system, since
failure of the cooling systems would bring about failure of the detectors.

Neutron fluctuation analysis proved to be a valuable tool for moni-
toring anomalous behavior in the MSRE [9, 10]. Unfortunately, one of
the requirements for obtaining good results with this technique is a high
detection efficiency for core-coupled neutrons. While no detailed calcu-
lations have been made of neutron fluxes outside the reflector and vessel,
we estimate that in the MSBR these fluxes will be too low to provide the
desired signal-to-noise ratio for some types of fluctuation analysis.

All of the proposed nuclear detector locations are within the high-
temperature primary containment oven and have in common the problem of
containment penetration seals. Generally, the specifications for pene-
trations for nuclear detectors are mere demanding than those for process
sensors, because of the typically very small signal currents delivered.
The location and detailed requirements of these penetrations have not yet
been determined, but the need for some development work in this area is
anticipated. The signal transmitting lines will require special design
and some development because of the high-temperature environment.

Process Instrumentation

 

Although MSBR process instrumentation can reasonably be expected
to require some designs beyond the present state of the art, no problems
are foreseen that could not be resolved by further development of compo-
nents and techniques [2, 19]. Many instrument components used success-
fully in the MSRE and others being developed for the LMFBR will be directly

 

 
 

325

applicable to the MSBR. Similarly, experience being gained by the util-
ities industry with instrumentation of supercritical pressure steam systems
will be applicable to the MSBR.

MSBR process instrumentation located outside the biologically
shielded areas and not an integral part of the containment system can
be conventional equipment. Some standard components, however, may re-
quire upgrading, and a strict quality control program will be required
to ensure a level of reliability and performance commensurate with MSBR
requirements.

All process instrumentation components located within the contain-
ment cells or as an integral part of the containment system must probably
be considered developmental. These components are predominantly primary
sensing elements for measurement of flow rates, pressures, levels,
weights, and temperatures in the salt-containing pipes and vessels, in
the associated purge and off-gas systems, and in the salt chemical pro-
cessing facilities. Other such components are final control elements
(such as off-gas control valves), lead-wire and piping connections to
the sensing and final control elements, remotely operated disconnects,
and containment penetration seals.

The electrical conductivity of the MSBR salts will be a factor in
selecting the type of primary sensing elements that can be used. The
conductivities of MSBR salts are estimated to be about 1 mho/cm — zbout
the same as MSRE salts. This means, for example, that magnetic flow-~
meters probably cannot be used, and most of the devices will be similar
to those used or the MSRE. Some new techniques are being investigated
which show some promise for use with low-conductivity salts.

Some development will be required to adapt MSRE contrel components
to the higher pressures and temperatures that will exist in portions of
the MSBR. Development of other equipment and techniques, such as elec-
trical penetrations into salt-containing pipes and vessels, would undoubt-
edly lead to improved instrumentation.

Rod Drives

The detailed rod requirements will be a function of the particular
reactor design. The rod worths will vary with type, size, and location,
so that drive speeds cannot be specified until the physical and nuclear
designs are well advanced. The mechanical design of the drive mechanisms
is discussed in Chapter 8.

Salt Throttling Valves

 

One of the more promising plant control schemes depends upon throt-
tling in a secondary salt bypass around the primary heat exchanger.
(Tight shut-off is not required of the valves in this bypass.) The
maximum and minimum flow rates and the rate of change of flow rate nec-
essary to achieve satisfactory plant control will need to be factored
into the development of a valve for this service. Valve design is dis-
cussed in Chapter 8.
326

Digital Computer Application for Control and Data Handling

 

The reference design includes the reactor, four primary loops, four wi
secondary loops, each having four reheaters and four steam generators,
and a multistage turbine. All of the loops interact or require responsive
action from other loops when perturbed, and the correct action to take
may not be simply perceived. Computer control and surveillance of the
plant is desirable to relieve the operators of difficult tasks and can be
expected to improve the safety and reliability of operation. Design
planning should include from the beginning provisions for optimum utili- ss
zation of computer techniques.

Chemical Plant Instrumentation and Control

 

The instrumentation requirements of a full-scale chemical processing
plant have, so far, received only minimal attention from instrument de-
signers. The processes involved have been instrumented and controlled on
laboratory or pilot plant scales, but not with the volumes and radiation
levels expected in the full-scale plant. Early evaluation of potential wi
problems is needed to enable initiation of required development on a
timely basis.

 

Uncertainties and Alternatives

There are several uncertainties regarding the overall control of an
MSBR that will require additional analyses and consideration of alterna-
tives. In particular, the high freezing temperatures of the salts create <@
the need for special considerations in load and flow control. Unusual
conditions or failures, such as a failure of a pump in a salt loop, will
require specific responses to avoid salt freezing. The behavior of mul- i
tiple loops of a large plant will need to be carefully programmed to
avoid freezing problems.

As mentioned earlier in this chapter, maintaining desirable or accept-
able steam and coclant-salt temperatures in the system under part-lcad
conditions is a fundamental prcblem. Several approaches have been investi-
gated for possible resolution of this difficulty. One is the use of flow-
proportioning valves to bypass coolant around the primary heat exchanger, } GE
and this is a very attractive scheme from strictly the contrecl viewpoint.
Relatively complete separation of load effects from the salt operating
conditions 1s possible using one or two valves, and salt temperatures and
steam conditions can be optimized more or less independently. Proportion-
ing valves for molten salt will have to be developed if this scheme is to
be used.

The second approach, which has been briefly examined, is to allow kd
the temperature of the steam leaving the generator to rise at reduced
loads and to attemperate it with feedwater addition to regain proper con-
ditions for the turbine. Attemperation is used in modern supercritical Gi
fossil-fired steam plants but is usually followed by a reheater or super-

 
 

 

 

 

 

327

heater to assure that no feedwater is carried over to the turbines. The
application of this technique to an MSBR plant will require careful study
before its practicability can be assured.

A third possibility for maintaining satisfactory conditions during
part-load operation is the staging of the multiple loops, that is, oper-
ating some loops near design point while others are idling. This method
of operation has not yet been investigated on the computer simulations.

Control and transient studies have not yet produced complete data
on the thermal transients that can reasonably be expected to occur at
critical points in the vessels and piping. The control schemes proposed
go far have involved maintaining the reactor inlet temperature nearly
constant while the outlet temperature varies as some function of lead;
the primary flow remains constant. If thermal stresses are determined
to be a problem at normal maneuvering rates or under other anticipated
transient conditions, then alternative schemes may need to be considered.
One possibility is to vary the primary flow rate so as to maintain the
reactor temperature rise more nearly constant as load is varied. Some
control of primary flow, perhaps on-off reduction to pony-motor flow,
may be desirable to avoid rapid changes in salt temperatures under some
emergency conditions.

It will be desirable to maintain a long-term reactivity balance in
an MSBR system. The established technique involves carefully accounting
for all significant reactivity additions and withdrawals from the reactor
system, including calculating the buildup or burnout of poisons. This
will be difficult in an MSBR, however, because many factors that can affect
reactivity may not be determinable with continuous on-line processing.
Neutren fluctuation analysis was applied to the MSRE for measurement of
void fraction in the fuel and has been used in other reactors for suberit-
icality measurement. With further development, it may prove useful in
the MSBR.

Suitable locations for ionization chambers have not been determined.
The fuel will have a very strong inherent (a,n) source, which is helpful
for easing startup instrumentation sensitivity requirements, but at the
same time the graphite reflector will be an effective shield for detectors
located outside the reactor vessel. It has not been determined at this
stage of investigation whether or not it will be necessary to locate de-
tectors in the core. This determination is an important task to be
performed early in a specific MSBR design.

Complete instrumentation of the primary system, including salt pres-
sure and flow measurements, is very desirable. These measurements will
require development of suitable sensors. The MSRE was operated success-—
fully without direct measurement of primary salt pressure and flow rate,
and possibly they are not essential for an MSBR, but it would be convenient
to know the primary flow rate, especially if the flow is to be varied by
changing pump speed.
328

Evaluation

Assessment of the controllability of an MSBR compared with other
power plant concepts reveals a number of favorable features and a few
features which add difficulty. Among the favorable features are the
nuclear characteristics, which may be described as docile. Comfortably
long prompt—neutron lifetimes and a large prompt negative temperature
coefficient of reactivity yield very desirable control characteristics
[3, p. 62]. Thus the capability for fast transients as a result of
conceivable reactivity anomalies is minimal [1, p. 117}. A positive
moderator coefficient contributes to make the isothermal temperature
coefficient of reactivity fairly small. This results in very modest
control reactivity requirements for maneuvering and permits very small
loaded excess reactivity. The large heat capacity of the molten salt
serves as a buffer to absorb the effects of reactivity transients and
lessen their influence on the plant, and melting of fuel is not a
limitation since it is already molten. Gaseous fission products are
continuously stripped from the salt, greatly reducing their usual
reactivity effects, and the entire reactor fuel system operates from
a low base pressure.

The high freezing temperatures of the salts are negative features
that complicate both control and protection to some extent in that special
provisions must be made to avoid freezing of the salt during power or
load changes. Analysis indicates that special control measures are nec-
essary to maintain proper salt temperatures under part-lcad conditions.
Some abnormal situations, such as loss of salt circulation, require
decreasing the load and reducing flow in adjacent loops as well as re-
quiring reactor power reduction.

The circulating fuel system alters the effective delayed neutron
fraction since some of the delayed neutrons are emitted outside the re-
actor core area. Variation of the fuel salt flow rate, therefore, will
affect reactivity to some extent, but this is not ezpected to present a
significant control problem. With on-line fuel processing, accurate
inventory control and long-term reactivity accounting will be more dif-
ficult than in past experience, since a large number of variable factors
affect the reactivity balance to some degree. The net effect of all these
factors, however, is not expected to present any short-term control or
safety problems — only long-term bookkeeping uncertainties.

The oven concept for heating of the salt systems will make mainte-
nance operations easier than if the piping and vessels were individually
heated and insulated, but more of the instrument systems will be exposed
to the high-temperature environment. Because of this and some other
requirements, adequate instruments for all applications are not available
off the shelf. Development has been slow, however, because the require-
ments are such a strong function of the particular application and
environment.

In summary, some of the control and instrumentation problems will
be challenging, but none is expected to be beyond existing technological
capabilities. Instrumentation and control development problems should
not have a detrimental effect on the overall development schedule for
MSBR's.

11. FUEL PROCESSING

IL.. E. McNeese

Operation of a molten-salt reactor as a high-performance breeder is
made possible by the continuous processing of the fuel salt in a facility
that is located at the reactor site. The most important operations con-
sist in removing fission products (principally the rare earths) and iso-
lating 233pg from the region of high neutron flux during its decay to
233y in order to hold neutron absorption in these materials to an accept-
ably low level. It is also necessary that excess uranium produced in the
system be removed for sale, that the fuel salt be maintained at the proper
redox potential, and that the oxide and corrosion product concentrations
in the salt be maintained at tolerable levels.

The rates at which the fuel salt must be processed for 233pg removal
and rare-earth removal are mutually dependent. It will be convenient to
define the term "processing cycle time" as the time required for process-
ing a volume of fuel salt equal to that contained in the reactor system.
The “removal time" for a given material is then an effective cycle time
that is equal to the processing cycle time divided by the fraction of the
material that is removed in a pass through the processing system. As
shown in Fig. 11.1, for a particular single~fluid MSBR having a breeding
ratio of 1.07, the required rare-earth removal time can range from 50
days for a protactinium removal time of 3 days to about 11 days for a
protactinium removal time of 20 days. The optimum choice of protactinium
and rare-earth removal times is largely dependent on the characteristics
of the processes employed. For example, the present rare-earth removal
process requires that protactinium be removed from the salt prior to the
removal of rare earths. Hence, with this process, the rare-earth removal
time will always be as long as or longer than the protactinium removal
time. As will be discussed later, a protactinium removal time of 10 days
and a rare-earth removal time of about 27 days are used with the reference
processing system.

Reference Processing Plant

Processes involving the selective chemical reduction of materials
from the fuel salt into liquid bismuth appear to be the most promising
processing methods currently available, and the development of these
processes has been the subject of most of the recent work on fuel process-
ing, We have noted previously [1l, p. 170] that the isolation of protac-
tinium is straightforward since its extraction behavior is significantly
different from that of uranium, thorium, and lithium. However, until
recently, the removal of rare earths was difficult since the rare earths
and thorium extract in almost the same manner from molten fluoride mix-
tures. In 1969, Smith and Ferris [2, p. 285] noted that the rare earths
distribute selectively into molten lithium chloride from bismuth solutions
containing thorium; this observation allowed McNeese [3, pp. 2-15] to

devise a significantly improved rare-earth removal system known as the
metal transfer process.

Distribution of Metals Between Molten Salts and Bismuth

Bismuth is a low-melting (271°C) metal that is essentially immiscible
with molten halide mixtures consisting of fluorides, chlorides, and bro-
mides. The vapor pressure of bismuth in the temperature range of interest
(500 to 700°C) is negligible, and the solubilities of lithium, thorium,
uranium, protactinium, and most of the fission products are adequate for
processing applications.

Under the conditions of interest, reductive extraction reactions be-
tween materials in salt and metal phases can be represented by the follow-
ing reaction:

MX (salt) + nLi(Bi) = M(Bi) + nLiX (salt) ,

in which the metal halide MX in the salt reacts with lithium from the
bismuth phase to produce M iff the bismuth phase and the respective lithium
halide in the salt phase. The valence of M in the salt is +n, and X rep-
resents fluorine, chlorine, and bromine. It has been found [4] that at

a constant temperature the distribution coefficient D for metal M depends
on the lithium concentration in the metal phase (mole fraction), Xi io as
follows:

= + #*
log D =n log Xs log K .

The quantity K * is dependent only on temperature, and the distribution
coefficient is defined by the relation:

. mole fraction of M in metal phase
mole fraction of MX in salt phase

 

The ease with which one component can be separated from another is indi-
cated by the ratio of the respective distribution coefficients, that is,
the separation factor. As the separation factor approaches unity, sepa-
ration of the components becomes increasingly difficult. On the other
hand, the greater the deviation from unity, the easier the separation.
Distribution data obtained [4] for a number of materials between
fuel salt (72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,~ThF,) and bismuth at 640°C are summa-
rized in Fig. 11.2. The lines for the various elements have slopes that
correspond to the indicated oxidation states. Under the expected process
conditions, the Pa-Th separation factor is about 1200, which indicates
that protactinium as well as uranium and zirconium can be easily extracted
from a salt stream containing Th¥F,. However, the rare-earth—thorium sep-
aration factors are close to unity (1.2 to 3.5), indicating that removal
of the rare earths from a salt containing thorium fluoride will be diffi-
cult. The previous rare-earth removal system, which was based on these

low separation factors, required a large number of stages, a high metal-
to~salt flow ratio, and a large electrolytic cell for providing thorium
and rare earth reflux at the ends of the extraction cascade [1, pp. 170-78;
5, pp. 52-77].

We have found, however, that with LiCl or LiBr, much more favorable
thoriumrare-earth separation factors are obtained [2, p. 285]. Distri-
bution data for LiCl [6, p. 171; 7] at 640°C are shown in Fig. 11.3. The
data fall roughly intc three groups. The divalent rare-earth and alkaline-
earth elements distribute most readily to the LiCl, with thoriumrare-
earth separation factors of about 108. The trivalent rare earths form
the second group, and the thorium—rare-earth separation factors are about
10%, Tetravalent materials, such as thorium and protactinium, distribute
only slightly to the LiCl. Studies on the temperature dependence of the
distribution data show essentially no effect for the divalent elements,

a minor effect for the trivalent elements, and a somewhat greater effect
for the tetravalent elements. The distribution coefficient for thorium
is decreased sharply by the addition of fluoride to the LiCl, although
the distribution coefficients for the rare earths are affected by only a
minor amount. Thus, contamination of the LiCl with several mole percent
fluoride will not affect the removal of the rare earths but will cause a
sharp increase in the thorium discard rate. Data with LiBr [7] are sim~
ilar to those with LiCl, and the distribution behavior with LiCl-LiBr
mixtures would likely not differ appreciably from the data with the pure
materials.

The potential held by LiCl for selective extraction of the rare
earths from MSBR fuel salt is best illustrated by considering the equi-
librium concentrations of rare earths, thorium, and lithium in fuel salt,
bismuth containing reductant, and LiCl as shown in Table 11.1. The con-
centrations of the rare earths and alkaline earths in the fluoride salt
correspond to a 25-day removal time for these materials in the reference
MSBR. The thorium concentration in the bismuth is 90% of the thorium
solubility at 640°C. As can be seen, the rare-earth and alkaline-earth
elements are present in the LiCl at low concentrations and are associated
with a negligible amount of thorium.

A rare-earth removal system based on this effect will be practical
only if a suitable means is available for removing the rare-earth and
alkaline-earth elements from the LiCl. The distribution coefficients for
these elements are strongly affected by the concentration of lithium in
the bismuth phase, and the best method for removing these materials from
the LiCl appears to be extraction into bismuth containing lithium at a
concentration of 0.05 to 0.50 mole fraction. Sufficient data have been
obtained with lithium concentrations in the bismuth as high as 0.38 mole
fraction to show that no deviation occurs from the relations established
initially with much lower lithium concentrations.

UF, and approximately 0.0035 mole Z PaF, is withdrawn from the reactor.
About 99% of the uranium is removed from the salt by fluorination in order
to avoid the use of large quantities of reductant in the subsequent prot-
actinium removal step. The salt stream is fed countercurrent to a bismuth
stream containing lithium and thorium, where the remaining uranium and

the protactinium transfer to the metal stream. These materials are trans-
ferred from the bismuth toc a captive secondary salt by hydrofluorinating
the bismuth stream leaving the extraction column in the presence of the
secondary salt. The secondary salt which flows through the hydrefluo-
rinator also circulates through a fluorinator, where about 907 of the
uranium is removed, and through a tank that contains most of the protac-
tinium. Lithium is added to the bismuth leaving the hydrofluorinator,

and the resulting stream is returned to the top of the extraction column.
The salt leaving the extraction column is essentially free of uranium and
protactinium but contains the rare earths at essentially the reactor con-
centration. This stream is fed to the rare-earth removal system.

Rare-~Earth Removal Process

 

A simplified flowsheet for the rare-earth removal system [9, pp.
1-15] is shown in Fig. 11.5. Fuel salt, which is free of uranium and
protactinium but contains the rare earths, is countercurrently contacted
with bismuth containing reductant in order to extract a significant frac-
tion of the rare earths into the bismuth. The bismuth stream, which
contains the rare earths and thorium, is then countercurrently contacted
with lithium chloride. Because of highly favorable distribution coeffi-
cients, significant fractions of the rare earths transfer to the LiCl
along with a negligible amount of thorium. The final steps of the process
consist in extracting the rare earths from the LiCl by contact with bis-
muth having lithium concentrations of 5 and 50 at. 7.

This process has a number of very desirable characteristics. Of
primary importance is the fact that there is no net consumption of reduc—
tant in the two upper contactors. The process is not sensitive to minor
variations in operating conditions. Essentially no materials other than
the rare-earth and alkaline—earth elements are removed from or added to
the fuel salt; the major change consists in replacing the extracted rare
earths with an equivalent amount of lithium as LiF. The amount of LiF
added to the fuel salt in this manner during 30 years of operation would
be less than 10% of the LiF inventory in the reactor.

Conceptual Processing Flowsheet

 

The reference processing flowsheet [8, pp. 3-21] is shown in Fig.
11.6. Fuel salt is withdrawn from the reactor on a 10-day cycle; for a
1000-MW(e) reactor, this represents a flow rate of (0.88 gpm. The fluori-
nator, where 99% of the uranium is removed, has an active diameter of 8
in. and a height of 15 ft. The protactinium extraction column is 3 in.
in diameter and is packed with 3/8-in. Raschig rings. The column is
equivalent to five equilibrium stages and has a height of 15 ft. The

bismuth flow rate through the column is (0.13 gpm, and the inlet thorium
concentration in the stream is 90% of the thorium solubility at the oper-
ating temperature of 640°C. The protactinium decay tank has a volume of
160 ft3. The uranium inventory in the tank is less than 0.27 of that in
the reactor. Fluorides of lithium, thorium, zirconium, and nickel accum-
ulate in the tank at a total rate of about 0.1 ft3/day. These materials
are removed by periodic withdrawal of salt to a final protactinium decay
and fluorination operation.

The bismuth flow rate through the two upper contactors in the rare-
earth removal system is 12.5 gpm, and the LiCl flow rate is 33 gpm. These
extraction columns are 7 to 13 in. in diameter and are packed with 1/2-in.
Raschig rings. Each is equivalent to three equilibrium stages.

The trivalent and divalent rare earths are removed in separate con-
tactors in order to minimize the amount of lithium required. Only 2% of
the LiCl, or 0.66 gpm, is fed to the two-stage divalent rare-earth removal
contactor, where it is contacted with a 0,58-gal/day bismuth stream con-
taining 50 at. 7 lithium. The trivalent stripper, where the LiCl is
contacted with bismuth containing 5 at. Z lithium, is equivalent to one
equilibrium stage.

The bismuth stream containing the reductant necessary for the isola-
tion of protactinium is actually fed te the recirculating bismuth stream
in the rare-earth removal system. An equivalent amount of bismuth is
withdrawn from the stream and is fed to the protactinium isolation column.
This allows for more nearly complete extraction of the protactinium and
provides a means for removing materials which might otherwise accumulate
in the recirculating stream.

The remaining steps in the flowsheet consist in combining the proc-
essed salt with uranium and purifying the resulting fuel salt. The
uranium addition is accomplished by absorbing the UFg-F, stream from
the fluorinators into fuel salt containing UF,, which results in the
formation of soluble, nonvolatile UF5. The UFs is then reduced to UF,
by contact with hydrogen. The HF resulting from reduction of UFg is
electrolyzed in order to recycle the contained fluorine and hydrogen.
Recycle of these materials is used in order to avoid waste disposal
charges on the material that would be produced if the HF were absorbed
in an aqueous solution of KOH [31]. The salt will be contacted with
nickel wool in the purification step in order to ensure that the final
bismuth concentration is acceptably low.

The protactinium removal time obtained with the flowsheet is 10 days,
and the rare-earth removal times range from 17 to 51 days, with the rare
earths of most Importance being removed on 27- to 30-day cycles. We
have made calculations [8, pp. 3-21; 9, pp. 1-15] which indicate that
the flowsheet is relatively insensitive to minor variations in operating
conditions such as changes in temperature, flow rates, reductant concen-
trations, etc. It was noted earlier, however, that the thoriumrare-earth
separation factor decreases sharply as the concentration of fluoride in
the LiCl is increased; contamination of the LiCl would result from en-
trainment of fuel salt by the bismuth stream leaving the upper contactor.
The effect is largely an increase in the rate at which thorium is removed
with the rare earths. The thorium removal rate increases from about 0.4
mole/day with no fluoride in the LiCl te about 280 moles/day when the LiCl

 

 
ri

 

343

contains the equivalent of 5 mole %Z LiF. It appears that the fluoride
concentration in the LiCl can economically be as high as 2 mole 7%, which
corresponds to a thorium discard rate of 7.7 moles/day. Discard of tho-
rium at this rate would add only about 0.0013 mill/kWhr to the power cost.
The effect of fluoride in the LiCl on the removal of rare earths is neg-
ligible. In fact, the rare-earth removal efficiency increases slightly

as the fluoride concentration in the LiCl increases. In addition, contact
of LiCl containing fluoride with BClj has been found to result in forma-
tion of volatile BF; [10, p. 106], and thus fluoride can be removed from
LiCl easily by this means.

The reliable removal of decay heat from the processing plant is an
important consideration because of the relatively short decay time before
the salt enters the processing plant. A total of about 6 MW of heat would
be produced in the processing plant for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. Since molten
bismuth, fuel salt, and LiCl are not subject to radiclytic degradation,
there is not the usual concern encountered with processing of short-
decayed fuel.

Waste Streams Produced by Processing Plant

All high-level waste streams produced by the protactinium and rare-
earth removal systems can be combined [8, pp. 3-21] for uranium recovery
prior to disposal, as shown in Fig. 11.7. In this operation, waste salt
from the protactinium decay tank would be combined with the discard stream
of fuel carrier salt. The lithium-bismuth stream from the trivalent-rare-
earth stripper would be hyvdrofluorinated in the presence of the resulting
salt, and the combined stream would be held for protactinium decay. The
protactinium concentration in the combined stream would be only 500 ppm
initially, and the specific heat generation rate would be acceptably low.
The salt in the waste holdup tank would be fluorinated before discard to
recover uranium in order that the loss of fissile material can be made
acceptably low. The composition of the di-~carded salt would be 74.7-13.5-
9.5-0.8 mole Z LiF-ThF,-BeF,-ZrF,, 1.2 molv 7 trivalent-rare-earth fluo-
rides, and 0.3 mole 7 divalent-rare-earth fluorides. The salt temperature
would have to be maintained at about 600°C so that the trivalent-rare-
earth fluorides would not precipitate. This processing scheme would re-
quire that salt be discarded at the rate of 60 ft3 every 220 days. We
anticipate that the waste will remain in this form unless the requirements
of the federal waste repository make further processing necessary.

Thorium is discarded from the system at the rate of about 50 moles/
day. Although the cost of replacing this thorium is low (0.0084 mill/
kWhr), the resulting thorium utilization is only about 20%. Flowsheet
modifications have been developed, however, that will not require discard
of thorium and which will result in almost complete utilization of thorium
if desired.

An additional high-level solid waste stream, which contains most of
the icdine and bromine removed from the reactor, is produced by the Hy-HF
purification and recycle system (shown in Fig. 11.8). The H,-HF streams
leaving the fuel reconstitution step, the hydrogen-reduction columns,
purge columns, and hydrofluorinators are combined, compressed to about

2 atm pressure, and chilled to -40°C in order to condense HF from the
stream for production of hydrogen and fluorine for recycle by electrolysis.
Large fractions of the.HI, HBr, SeFg, and TeFg are expected to be dis-
solved in the hydrogen fluoride condensate. These compounds are more
volatile than hydrogen fluoride and can be separated by low-temperature
distillation at 2 atm pressure.

The gas stream leaving the top of the distillation column, which
will contain HF, HBr, and HI, is combined with the gas stream leaving the
HF condenser, which will contain a small quantity of HF, and the resulting
stream is scrubbed with an aqueous KOH solution for removal of the ha-
lides. The gas stream is dried in regenerative silica gel sorbers and
is recycled. About 5% of the hydrogen is fed through beds of activated
alumina and charcoal for removal of SeFg, TeFg, and noble gases, which
are not removed by the KOH.

The halides are accumulated in the KOH scrubber solution for a period
of 34 days, after which the solution is held for a 45-day decay period.
The solution is then evaporated in 24-in.-diam, 10-fi-long waste con-
tainers. Two waste containers are filled annually.

Alternate Processing Methods

We presently know of no other rare-earth removal method as attractive
as the metal transfer process; however, protactinium and uranium appear
to be removable from fuel salt by alternate methods based on the selec-
tive precipitation of the oxides of these materials. Protactinium is
present in the MSBR as PaF,. Baes, Bamberger, and Ross [10, p. 92] have
shown that Pa*’ dissolved in a molten LiF-BeF,-ThF, solution can be oxi-
dized to the 57 state by hydrofluorination according to the reaction:

2PaF, (d) + 2BF(g) = 2PaFs(d) + Hy (g)

and that the addition of oxide to molten salt containing PaSt results im
the precipitation of a pure phase consisting of Pay0s. The solubility
product for Pay05 appears to be much lower than those for the oxides of
other materials in the fuel salt; this makes possible the selective re-
moval of protactinium from MSBR fuel salt without the prior removal of
uranium. However, if the oxide concentration in the salt is increased
to too high a level, a solid solution of uranium and thorium oxides will
also be precipitated; studies [11] indicate that a U0,-ThO, solid solution
containing about 95% U0; would be precipitated from MSBR fuel salt.

It appears likely that contact of the fuel salt with an HF-H,0-Ar
gas mixture could convert practically all of the protactinium to Pa®
and precipitate a large fraction as Pa,0g without precipitating uranium
oxide. The equilibria involved are presently being studied [12, pp. 196-
99; 12, pp. 64-66; 13], but the extent to which the separation can be
accomplished is not yet known [13] with sufficient accuracy to allow final
evaluation of oxide precipitation processes.
 

 

 

347

We have made preliminary evaluations of several conceptual flowsheets
based on oxide precipitation [14, pp. 237-40]; the most promising of these
is shown in Fig. 11.9. Fuel salt would be withdrawn from the reactor on
a 3-day cycle, and about 607% of the protactinium would be removed as Pa;0s
in order to cbtain a protactinium removal time of 5 days. The Pay,0g pre-
cipitate would be hydrofluorinated in the presence of a captive fluoride
salt phase which would be circulated through the protactinium decay tank
and through a fluorinator in order to maintain an acceptably low uranium
inventory in the decay tank. Part of the salt in the decay tank would
be returned to the reactor periodically to compensate for salt that is
transferred to the hydrofluorinator with the Pajy05. Ten percent of the
salt leaving the Pa,0g precipitator would be processed for rare-earth
removal by the metal transfer process; this would result in a 30-day proc-
essing cycle and a rare-earth removal time of about 50 days. Most of the
uranium must be removed from the salt prior to the removal of the rare
earths. This could be accomplished either by fluorination or by oxide
precipitation. The separated uranium would then be recombined with the
processed salt leaving the metal transfer system and would be returned
to the reactor.

Status of Process Development

Development work on a number of aspects of the reference and alter-
nate processing plant flowsheets either has been completed recently or
is in progress.

Metal Transfer Process Development

An engineering experiment completed recently demonstrated all aspects
of the metal transfer process [15] for the removal of rare earths. The
equipment consisted of a 6-in.-diam compartmented vessel in which were
present about 1 liter each of MSBR fuel carrier salt, bismuth saturated
with thorium, and LiCl. The fluoride salt initially contained l"7NdF,
at the tracer level and LaFj3 at a concentration of 0.04 mole fraction.
During the experiment, the rare earths were selectively extracted into
the LiCl along with a negligible amount of thorium. Provision was made
for circulating the LiCl through a chamber containing bismuth having a
lithium concentration of 38 at. %, where the rare earths and thorium were
removed, The distribution ratios for the rare earths remained constant
during the experiment at about the expected values. About 507% of the
neodymium and about 707 of the lanthanum were collected in the Li-Bi so-
lution. The final thorium concentration in the Li-Bi solution was below
5 ppm, making the ratio of rare earths to thorium in the Li-~Bi greater
than 10° times the initial concentration ratio in the fuel salt and thus
demonstrating the selective removal of rare earths from a fluoride salt
containing thorium.

A larger metal transfer experiment [14, pp. 254-55; 12, pp. 209-12;
13] has been put into operation that uses salt and bismuth flow rates that

are about 1% of the values required for processing a 1000-MW(e) MSBR, and
the preliminary design has been carried out for an experiment that will
use a three-stage salt-metal contactor and flow rates that are 5 to 10%
of those required for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR [13].

Reductive Extraction Studies

We have successfully operated a salt-bismuth reductive extraction
facility in which uranium and zirconium were extracted from salt by
countercurrent contact with bismuth containing reductant [8, pp. 64-89;
13]. More than 95% of the uranium was extracted from the salt by a 0.82-
in.-diam, 24-in.-long packed column. The inlet uranium concentration in
the salt was about 25% of the uranium concentration in the reference
MSBR. These experiments represent the first demonstration of reductive
extraction of uranium in a flowing system. Information on the rate of
mass transfer of uranium and zirconium has also been obtained in the
system using an isotopic dilution method, and HTU values of about 4.5 ft
have been obtained.

Correlations have been developed [3, pp. 102-17; 15] for flooding
and dispersed-phase holdup in packed columns during countercurrent flow
of liquids having high densities and a large difference in demsity, such
as salt and bismuth. These correlations, which have been verified by
studies with molten salt and bismuth [8, pp. 64-89%], were developed by
study of countercurrent flow of mercury and water or high-density organics
and water in 1- and 2-in.-diam columns packed with solid cylinders and
Raschig rings varying in size from 1/8 to 1/2 in. We have also obtained
data on axial dispersion in the continuous phase during the countercurrent
flow of high-density liquids in packed columns [16, pp. 58-89%; 17], and
have developed a simple relation for predicting the effects of axial dis-
persion on column performance [18].

The successful operation of salt-metal extraction columns is dependent
upon the availability of a bismuth-salt interface detector. We [13] have
recently demonstrated the successful operation of an eddy-current-type
interface detector that consists of a ceramic form on which bifilar pri-
mary and secondary coils are wound. Contact of the coils with molten
salt or bismuth is prevented by enclosing the element in a molybdenum
tube. Passage of a high-frequency alternating current through the primary
coil induces a current in the secondary coll whose magnitude is dependent
on the conductivities of the adjacent materials; since the conductivities
of bismuth and salt are quite different, the induced current reflects the
presence or absence of bismuth. The detector appears to be a practical
and sensitive indicator of either salt-bismuth interface location or bis-
muth level.

We have initiated design and development work on a reductive extrac-
tion process facility [13] that will allow operation of the important
steps for the reductive extraction process for protactinium isolation.

The facility will allow countercurrent contact of salt and bismuth streams
in a 2-in.-diam, 6-ft-long packed column at flow rates as high as about
25% of those required for processing a 1000-MW(e) MSBR. The facility will
cperate continucusly and will allow measurement of mass transfer and hy-
drodynamic data under steady-state conditions.
350

Continuous Fluorinator Development

Progress has also been made in the development of continuous fluo-
rinators. We have previously [19] carried out experimental studies of
flucorination of molten salt in a l-in.-diam, 72-in.-long nickel fluori-
nator that allowed countercurrent contact of molten salt with fluorine.
In these tests, molten salt (41-24-35 mole 7 NaF-LiF-ZrF,) containing UF,
was countercurrently contacted with a quantity of fluorine in excess of
that required for the conversiom of UF, to UFg. Experiments were carried
out with temperatures ranging from 525 to 600°C, UF, concentrations in
the feed salt ranging from 0.12 to 0.35 mole %, and a range of salt and
fluorine feed rates. The fraction of the uranium removed from the salt
ranged from 97.57 to 99.9%.

Axial dispersion in the salt phase will be important in the design
of continuous fluorinators, and gas holdup and axial dispersion were
measured in columns having diameters ranging from 1 to 6 in. using air
and aqueous solutions. Data were cbtained for wide ranges of viscosity,
surface tension, and superficial gas velocity. Correlations for gas
holdup and axial dispersion were developed [15] which are believed to be
applicable to countercurrent contact of molten salt and fluorine in a
continuous fluorinator. These correlations and the data on uranium re-
moval in the 1l-in.-diam continuous fluorinator were used for estimating
the performance of larger diameter continuous flucrinators [15].

The combination of molten salt and fluorine results in a highly cor-
rosive environment, and it will be necessary to protect a continuous
fluorinator from corrosion by maintaining a layer of frozen salt on sur-
faces that would otherwise contact both molten salt and fluorine. Pre-
venting molten salt from reaching the surface will allow passivation of
the nickel toc occur.

The feasibility of maintaining frozen salt layers in gas-salt con-
tactors was demonstrated previously [9] in tests in a 5-in.-diam, 8-ft-
high simulated fluorinator in which molten salt (66-34 mole 7 LiF-ZrFy)
and argon were countercurrently contacted. An internal heat source in
the molten region was provided by Calrod heaters contained in a 3/4-in.-
diam pipe along the center line of the vessel. A frozen salt layer was
maintained in the system with equivalent volumetric heat generation rates
of 10 to 55 kW/ft3. For comparison, the heat generation rates in fuel
salt immediately after removal from the reactor and after passing through
vessels having holdup times of 5 and 30 min are 57, 27, and 12 kW/ft3,
respectively.

Operation of a continuous fluorinator with nonradioactive salt re-
quires a means for generating heat in the molten salt that is not subject
to corrosion. We have studied radio-frequency induction heating in fluo-
rinator simulations using nitric acid [20] and have studied autoresistance
heating using 60-Hz power with molten salt (65-35 mole Z LiF-BeF;) in a
6-in.~diam fluorinator simulater [13]. Successful operation with auto-
resistance heating rates as high as 14.5 kW/ft3 has been carried out; the
expected power density in processing plant fluorinators is 12 kW/ft3.
Autoresistance heating is the preferred method, since it can be used over
a wider range of operating conditions and since the electrical power
ds

 

 

 

351

supply is much simpler than that required for induction heating. A fa-
cility is planned in which a continuous fluorinator can be operated that
has a molten zone diameter of 5 in. and a molten salt depth of 5 ft.

Fuel Reconstitution

Studies of the absorption of UFg by MSBR fuel carrier salt containing
UF, are being carried out [13]. Absorption of UFg in fuel carrier salt
containing UF, has been shown to result in the formation of soluble non-
volatile UFg according to the following reaction:

UFg(g) + UF, (4) = 2UF5(d) 5

in which (g) denotes gas and (d) denotes species dissolved in the salt.
The recent studies have also shown that gaseous hydrogen reacts with dis-
solved UF; according to the reaction:

2UFs (d) + Hy(g) = 2UF,(d) + 2HF(g) .

Since both UFg and UF5 are strong oxidants, the initial experiments were
conducted primarily to find a material that was inert to these species.
They showed that, at 600°C, nickel, copper, and graphite are not suffi-
ciently inert but that gold is stable both to gaseous UFg and to salt
containing up to 6 wt Z UF;. Consequently, the recent studies have been
conducted in gold apparatus. Future experiments will be carried out with
UFg-F, mixtures in order to determine the effect of the presence of fluo-
rine in the gas stream. We will also determine the behavior of the fluo-
ides of iodine and meptunium in this step.

Results from several experiments show that UFg dissolved in molten
salt slowly disproportionates to UFg and UF, and that the rate of dis-
proportionation is second order with respect to the concentration of UFj.
The studies also indicate that the solubility of UFg in the salt is low.
Engineering experiments are being designed for further study of the ab-
sorption of UFg-F, mixtures in molten salt containing UF, and the subse-
quent reduction of UFg by contact of the salt with hydrogen.

Uranium Oxide Precipitation Studies

Engineering studies of uranium removal by oxide precipitation have
been carried out [13] that involved the contact of 2 liters of MSBR fuel
salt with H,O-Ar gas mixtures in a 4-in.-diam nickel precipitator. Ex-
periments were conducted at temperatures ranging from 540 to 630°C, and
the composition of the H,0-Ar mixture was varied from 10 to 35% water.
Only a slight increase in the precipitation rate with an increase in tem-
perature was observed, and the rate of precipitation appeared to vary
directly with the rate at which water was supplied to the system. The
values for the water utilization were uniformly low (about 10 to 15%) and
did not vary with the composition of the gas stream. Higher utilization
352

values should be obtained by improving the contact of the gas with the
salt.

From 530 to 90% of the uranium was precipitated as oxide in most of
the experiments. Samples of the oxide contained about 90% UO, even though
at the lower uranium concentrations in the salt the solid in equilibrium
with the salt would contain 50% UO, or less. We believe that under non-
equilibrium precipitation conditions, such as would be present in a proc-
essing plant, U0,-ThO, solid solutions are formed which are in equilibrium
with the salt at the moment of precipitation but which once formed do
not rapidly reequilibrate. Thus, solid solutions that are formed early
in the precipitation process and that contain 90 to 957 U0; are still
present during the final stages of precipitation when solid solutions are
being formed that contain much less U0;. This effect appears to allow
precipitation of 997% of the uranium as a solid containing 85% UO, in a
single-stage batch precipitator. In contrast, earlier calculations
(10, pp. 202-3], based on the assumption that the oxide and salt would
remain in equilibrium throughout the precipitation process, had indicated
that a three-stage batch countercurrent precipitation system would be
required to achieve removal of this fraction of the uranium without the
removal of more than 17 of the thorium in the salt as ThO,.

The oxide precipitate was observed to settle rapidly, and more than
90% of the salt could be separated from the oxide by simple decantation.
This suggests that the removal of uranium from MSBR fuel salt from which
most of the protactinium has been removed can be accomplished easily by
oxide precipitation by contacting the salt with gaseous H;0-Ar mixtures.

Removal of Bismuth from Fuel Salt

In a processing plant, the fuel salt will be contacted with bismuth
containing reductant in order to remove protactinium and the rare earths.
It will be necessary that entrained or dissolved bismuth be removed from
the salt before it is returned to the reactor, since nickel is ‘quite sol-
uble in bismuth (about 10 wt 7} at the reactor operating temperature. Ef-
forts to measure the solubility of bismuth in salt have indicated that
the solubility is lower than shout 1 ppm, and the expected solubility of
bismuth in the salt under the highly reducing conditions that will be
used is very low. For these reasons, we believe that bismuth can only
be present at significant concentrations in the salt as entrained metallic
bismuth.

In order to characterize the bismuth concentration likely to be
present in the salt after it is contacted with bismuth, we have begun
periodic sampling of salt in engineering experiments involving contact
of salt and bismuth. The results to date indicate that the bismuth con-
centration in the salt in most cases ranges from 10 to 100 ppm after
countercurrent contact of the salt and bismuth in a packed-column con-
tactor; however, concentrations below 1 ppm are observed in salt leaving
a stirred-interface salt-metal contactor in which the salt and metal
phases are not dispersed. One of the present difficulties is that of
preventing contamination of the samples with small quantities of bismuth
during cleaning of the samples and the ensuing chemical analyses.
GH

353

A subsequent phase of the experimental program will consist in test-
ing the effectiveness of various devices and materials for removing en-
trained bismuth from salt. It is expected that contact of the salt with
nickel wool will be effective in removing entrained or dissolved bismuth,
since a large nickel surface area can be produced in this manner.

A natural circulation loop constructed of Hastelloy N and filled
with fuel salt has been operated by the Metals and Ceramics Division for
about two years; a molybdenum cup containing bismuth was placed near the
bottom of the loop. To date, the reported concentrations of bismuth in
salt from the loop (<5 ppm) are essentially the same as those reported
for salt from a loop containing no bismuth. We have noted no degradation
of metallurgical properties for corrosion specimens removed from the loop
containing bismuth.

Materials of Construction for Processing Plants*

A number of corrosion environments will be present in the processing
plant, and materials {hat will withstand attack are required. The con-
ditions of greatest severity consist of the following:

1. the presence of molten salt and gaseous mixtures of F, and UFg at
500 to 550°C,

2. the presence of molten salts and bismuth containing lithium and
thorium at 550 to 650°C, and

3. the presence of HF-H, mixtures and mixtures of molten fluorides at
550 to 650°C.

Our present plans call for molten-salt fluorinators to be constructed
of nickel or nickel-base alloys. As discussed earlier, corrosion in these
systems will be limited by frozen salt, so that the protective NiF, layer
will not be removed from the metal surface by dissolution in the molten
salt.

For the past several years, we have been investigating materials
that can be used to contain Bi-Li-Th solutions at temperatures from 550
to 700°C. Most of the conventional metals or alloys have been ruled cut
as possible container materials because of their tendency to mass transfer
when exposed to bismuth under a temperature gradient. Several of the
refractory metals and graphite do appear promising — each having its own
set of advantages and disadvantages. We have devoted the most attention
to molybdenum and are constructing a reductive-extraction experimental

facility out of this material in order to obtain experience with its fab-
rication and use. Other materials that remain of interest include the
tantalum alloy T-111 and several commercial grades of graphite.

Molybdenum

The selection of molybdenum as a processing plant material was based
on corrosion investigations at ORNL [6, pp. 256-59; 10, pp. 189-95} and
elsewhere [22,23] which showed it to resist dissolution and chemical
attack in molten bismuth. The studies at ORNL were conducted in small
thermal convection loops which provided a temperature gradient of 100 to
200°C in the bismuth circuit. Tests were conducted on low-carbon molyb-
denum and the alloy TZM in pure bismuth and bismuth containing up to 0.01
wt % (0.3 at. %) Li. Mass transfer was negligible in the temperature
range 500 to 700°C for periods as long as 3000 hr. Tests carried out in
static bismuth alsc have shown no effect of stress on the corrosivity of
molybdenum.

Although molybdenum has excellent resistance to corrosion, there are
other difficulties with its use. Molybdenum is a particularly structure-
sensitive material; that is, its mechanical properties are known to vary
widely, depending upon how it has been metallurgically processed. The
ductile-brittle transition temperature of molybdenum varies from below
room temperature to 200-300°C, depending both upon strain rate and the
microstructure of the metal. Maximum ductility is provided in the cold-
worked, fine-grained condition. Recent advances in vacuum-melting prac-
tices have led to the production of material with improved and more
reproducible metallurgical properties. The arc-melted low-carbon, low-
oxygen grade of molybdenum, available commercially, affords relatively
good control of grain size and interstitial impurity level. Neverthe-
less, the use of molybdenum as a structural material requires highly un-
orthodox assembly procedures and imposes stringent limitations on system
design from the standpoint of geometry and rigidity.

Several advances in the fabrication technology of molybdenum have
been made at ORNL in building the molybdenum system in which bismuth and
molten salt will be ccuntercurrently contacted in a 1-in.-ID, 5-ft-high
packed column that has 3.5-in.-ID upper and lower disengaging sections.
Salt and bismuth will be circulated in the system by gas-1ift pumps that
will elevate the streams to 3.5-in.-ID head pots for sampling, gas separa-
tion, and flow measurement. A salt-bismuth interface detector of the type
described earlier will be provided in the lower disengagement section for
determining the pressure drop through the column and the holdup of bismuth
in the column.

Techniques have been developed [6, pp. 253-54; 10, pp. 184-853; 14,
pp. 219-20; 12, pp. 167-69] for the production of closed-end molybdenum
vessels by back extrusion, which involves the flow of metal into a die
and the backward flow of metal over an advancing plunger. This process
has the advantages that the diameter of the part produced is as large as
or larger than that of the starting metal blank; the configuration of the
part can be changed by relatively simple changes in the die and mandrel
design; and sufficient deformation can be accomplished that a wrought or
RE

 

355

fine-grained structure having good mechanical properties is produced.
Parts that were free from cracks and had high-quality surfaces were con-
sistently produced with this technique by the use of ZrOj,-ccated plungers
and dies and extrusion temperatures of 1600 to 1700°C. Eleven closed-end
forgings were produced that had a 3-7/8-in. outside diameter, a 3.5-in.
inside diameter, and lengths from 8 tc 12 in. The 5.5-ft-long molybdenum
pipe for the extraction column, having an outside diameter of 1.16 in.
and an inside diameter of 1 in., was produced by floating mandrel ex-
trusion at 1600°C. Three extrusions for producing this material were
performed; the second extrusion produced a pipe 11.5 ft long that was
concentric to within 0.007 in. with excellent external and internal sur-
faces.

In evaluating three sizes of commercially available molybdenum tubing
(1/4-, 3/8~, and 1/2-in.-0D), we found [12, pp. 163-65] that the 1/2-in.-
OD tubing was ductile at room temperature, while the 3/8-in.-0D tubing
was ductile only at temperatures above 150 to 250°C and the 1/4~in.-OD
tubing was ductile only at temperatures above 300°C. We found, however,
that the 3/8-in.-0D and 1/4-in.-0D tubing could be made ductile at room
temperature by the removal of 0.001 to 0.003 in. of material from the
inside of the tubing by etching. Further investigation has led us to
believe that tubing that is ductile at room temperature can be produced
routinely by careful control of surface contamination during tubing fab-
rication.

We have demonstrated that complex components can be fabricated from
molybdenum by welding, using either the gas tungsten-arc or electron-beam
processes [6, pp. 254-55; 10, pp. 185-89; 14, pp. 220-22; 12, pp. 169-72].
Welding procedures were developed to deal with the inherent tendencies
of molybdenum toward hot cracking due to contamination (such as from 0,
or Ny), as well as abnormal grain growth, which results in welds that are
brittle at room temperature. Mechanical tube-to-header joints have also
been produced by pressure bonding, using commercial tube expanders. Tubes
which were rolled into headers at 250°C remained leak-tight after repeated
thermal cycling to 500°C. Welding studies have centered on three major
types of joint: tube~-to-tube sheet, tube-to-tube, and 3.5-in.-diam cir-
cumferential girth welds. Electron-beam and gas tungsten-arc welding
techniques both have been investigated. In addition, a commercial or-
biting-arc welding head was modified to allow us to make helium leak-tight
(<5 x 1078 atm em /sec) tube-to-tube field welds. Two of the most im-
portant factors found to minimize molybdenum weldment cracking have been
stress relieving of components and preheating prior to welding.

Although helium leak-tight molybdenum welds have been consistently
produced using both the electron-beam and tungsten-arc techniques, the
ductile-brittle transition of the weld lies above room temperature.
Therefore, each joint must be designed tc mechanically support the welds.
The joints are also back-brazed or plated with tungsten to provide a
secondary barrier against leakage.

Studies have been carried out for the development of braze materials
for joining molybdenum that are resistant to corrosion by bismuth and
molten salts [12, pp. 211-12; 10, pp. 189-91; 14, pp. 221-25; 12, pp. 172-
73]. An iron-base alloy (Fe-15% Mo~57% Ge-47 C-1% B) has been found to
have good wetting and flow properties, a moderately low brazing tempera-
ture (<1200°C), and adequate resistance to bismuth at 650°C.
356

The results of our work to date on molybdenum fabrication techniques
have been quite encouraging, and we believe that the material can be used
in building processing plants if proper attention is given to its fabri-
cation characteristics.

Tungsten and Tantalum Alloys

Other refractory metals that are resistant to attack in molten bis-
muth include pure tungsten and certain tantalum alloys. Tungsten, be-
cause of its relatively high ductile-brittle transition temperature, is
not amenable to the fabrication and joining operations required for a
full-sized processing plant. However, it is being used as a surface
coating at several points in the molybdenum extraction facility discussed
above. The coatings are deposited by chemical vapor deposition [6, pp.
259-61; 14, pp. 231-32} and serve as additional seals on the joints made
with tube expanders or by welding.

Corrosion tests in molten Bi and Bi-Li solutions have been conducted
on pure tantalum and the tantalum alloy T-111 (87 W, 2% Hf, bal Tz). In
quartz thermal convection loops at 700°C, the mass transfer rate of pure
tantalum in these liguid metals was greater than that of molybdenum, al-
though the rate was still less than 3 mils/year. Mass transfer rates of
the alloy T-1ll were comparable to those for molybdenum, but the mechan-
ical properties of the former alloy were strongly affected by interaction
with interstitial impurities, primarily oxygen, in the quartz—pure-bismuth
loop experiments. A more recent test carried out at 700°C with the Bi-2.5
wt Z Li mixture in a loop constructed of T-111 tubing did not measurably
affect the mechanical properties of the T-111, and the mass transfer
rate again was insignificant.

The resistance of tantalum or T-111 to corrosion by fuel salt is
unknown at this time, but it appears marginal from thermodynamic consid-
erations. However, tantalum should withstand attack by molten LiCl, and
experiments are planned to investigate this.

Several complex assemblies have been fabricated at ORNL using the
T-111 alloy, the largest of which was a forced convection loop which cir-
culated liquid lithium for 3000 hr at 1370°C [24]. In contrast to molyb-
denum, the alloy is quite ductile in the as-welded condition; thus it
appears promising for complex geometries that would operate principally
in Bi or Bi-Li solutions and only occasionally in fuel salt. The tan-
talum alloy, however, would require a higher degree of protection from
interstitial impurities (0, C, N) than would molybdenum.

Graphite

Graphite, which has excellent compatibility with the fuel salt, also
shows promise for the containment of bismuth. Relevant information on
graphite is presented in Chap. 6, which reviews the development of graph-
ite as a moderator for molten-salt reactors. Of course, in a chemical
processing application, the absence of a neutron flux allows greater flex~—
ibility in the selection of graphite grade and fabrication history than
for a reactor core.

Compatibility tests to date have shown no evidence of chemical in-
teraction between graphite and bismuth containing up to 3 wt %Z (48 at. %)
Li. However, the largest open pores of most commercially available poly-
crystalline graphites are penetrated to some extent by liquid bismuth.
Static capsule tests [13] of three commercial graphites (ATJ, AXF-5QBG,
and Graphitite A) were conducted for 500 hr at 700°C using both high-purity
bismuth and Bi-3 wt % (48 at. 7) Li. Although penetration by pure bismuth
was negligible, the addition of lithium to bismuth appeared to increase
the depth of permeation and, presumably, the wetting characteristics of
the bismuth,

There are several approaches that have potential for sealing a porous
graphite against penetration by the bismuth and bismuth-lithium alloys.
Two well-established ones are (1) multiple liquid hydrocarbon impregna-—
tions that are carbonized and/or graphitized and (2) pyrocarbon coatings.
Another possible approach is the use of carbide-forming sealants. Each
of these sealing approaches is being evaluated in bismuth loop experiments.
We are also studying the wetting characteristics of graphite as a function
of surface pretreatments such as dedusting, alcohol wash and oven dry,
and vacuum degassing at 700 to 1000°C.

Fabrication of a processing plant from graphite would necessitate
graphite—graphite and graphite-metal joints. We have conducted develop-
ment studies [25,26] on both types of joints using high-temperature brazes
and also metals which bond by forming carbides. Several of these experi-
mental joints show promise for the chemical processing application. Other
workers [27,28] have pioneered mechanical joints which may be satisfactory
for the proposed application.

Nickel-Base Alloys

Nickel or a nickel-base alloy would be used for the oxide precipita-
tion portions of a plant based on an oxide precipitation-metal transfer
flowsheet, for fluorinators for removal of uranium from molten fluoride
mixtures, and for portions of the plant that contain gaseous mixtures of
¥,, UF, and HF. We have accumulated many years of experience in the
fabrication and joining of this class of alloys, stemming from the con-
struction of reactors and associated hardware (Chap. 7) as well as fluo-
ride salt purification equipment.

Although we would limit the corrosion rate in continuous fluori-
nators by the maintenance of a frozen-salt film next to the container
wall, the chemical corrosion of nickel and nickel-base alloys has been
evaluated at ORNL under the severe environmental conditions endemic to
fluorination processes. Much of this information has evolved from fuel-
recovery operations conducted with metallic reactor fuel elements using
molten fluoride mixtures in which UF, was converted to volatile UFg by
fluorine sparging.

During these studies, a number of materials were exposed to gaseous
fluorine and molten salt. Most of the data were obtained during opera-
tion [29] of two plant-scale fluorinators constructed of "L" nickel at
temperatures ranging from 540 to 730°C. A number of corrosion specimens
358

(20 different materials) were located in the fluorinators. Several spec-
imens had lower rates of maximum corrosive attack than "L" nickel. The
specimen showing the least attack, Hymu 83, had a maximum bulk loss rate
of 11 mils/month based on total time in molten salt. Other corrosion
coupon tests at 600°C [30] showed that INOR-1 is also more resistant to
corrosion than 'L' nickel.

These operations have afforded useful guidelines and background in-
formation for the selection of construction materials for the proposed
process applications. They show the importance, however, of inerting the
metal surfaces in a fluorinator with a passive frozen-salt layer.

Effect of Uncertainties on Processing

The successful operation of a processing plant based on the refer-
ence flowsheet is contingent on the development program meeting several
objectives. These include the following:

1. developing continuous fluorinators having an acceptably low corrosion
rate and an adequate uranium removal efficiency,

2. identifying materials of construction that are compatible with molten
salts and bismuth containing reductant,

3. maintaining the concentration of bismuth in the fuel salt returning
to the reactor at acceptably low levels, and

4, developing on-line instrumentation necessary for plant operation.
The consequences of these chjectives not being met are discussed in the

remainder of this section,

Failure to Develop Continuous Fluorinators

 

Continuous fluorinators are used at two points in the reference flow-
sheet. The first of these is the primary fluorinator, where 997 of the
uranium is removed from the fuel salt prior to the removal of 233Pa by
reductive extraction. The second point is where uranium produced by de~-
cay of 233pa is removed from the secondary fluoride salt in the protac-
tinium decay tank circuit. Under the expected MSBR operating conditions,
the ratic of the uranium to the protactinium concentration in the reactor
is about 100, and removal of uranium from the fuel salt is necessary in
order to limit the quantity of reductant required for protactinium extrac-
tion to an amecunt that is economically acceptable. Failure to develop
continuous fluorinators would seriously affect the removal of protac-—
tinium with the reference flowsheet and would likely require that one of
the fcllowing alternatives be adopted:
 

 

 

359

1. that protactinium be isoclated by an oxide precipitation process,

2. that electrolytic cells be developed for reducing lithium from mol-
ten LiCl produced by hydrochlorinating bismuth streams that contain
lithium,

3. that electrolytic cells be developed for reducing lithium or thorium
from molten fluoride salt streams, or

4. that larger quantities of reductant be purchased for removal of
uranium by reductive extraction.

Only the first two of these alternatives are considered attractive.

Compatibility of Materials with Process Fluids

The successful operation of processing plants based on the reference
flowsheet or on alternate methods, such as oxide precipitation, is com-
pletely dependent on the availability of suitable materials of construc-
tion for the processing plant. The most critical of these is concerned
with the containment of bismuth, since no alternate rare-earth removal
method to the metal transfer process is known.

Entrainment of Bismuth in Fuel Salt

The molten fluoride fuel salt will be contacted with bismuth at sev-
eral points in the processing plant in order to selectively remove prot-
actinium or fission products. Since nickel is quite soluble in metallic
bismuth, it will be necessary to maintain the concentration of bismuth
in the fuel salt returning to the reactor at low levels. We presently
do not know what concentration of bismuth in fuel salt would be accept-
able; however, we assume that the allowable bismuth concentration would
be considerably lower than 1 ppm. Attempts to measure the solubility of
bismuth in fuel salt have been unsuccessful to date; however, thermody-—
namic considerations lead to the conclusion that the solubility is con-
siderably lower than 1 ppm. It will be necessary to identify the bismuth
concentration that is tolerable in MSBR fuel salt and to devise methods
for maintaining adequately low bismuth concentrations in the fuel salt.

Failure to Develop On-Line Instrumentation

We anticipate that on-line instrumentation will be available for
monitoring operation of the processing system and for ensuring that the
fuel salt returned to the reactor does not contain potentially harmful
materials. The instrumentation requirements are not rigid, since meas-
urement of any of several quantities would provide information on the
general state of operation of the processing plant. It would be quite
useful, although probably not necessary, if measurements could be made
360

continuously of the concentration of uranium, protactinium, bismuth, and
chromium as well as the redox potential of the salt leaving the processing
plant. If on-line instrumentation could not be relied upon, it would
probably be necessary that processed salt be held long enough before being
returned to the reactor for the desired analyses to be made. The fuel-
salt inventory would increase about 107, with an accompanying increase

of about 0.04 mill/kWhr in the fuel cycle cost, if a one-day holdup were
required.

Further Work Required to Demonstrate Processing Technology

Experimental work carried out to date on processing has demonstrated
the chemical feasibility of the various process steps. Most of the
further work that is required to demonstrate processing technology is
related to the operation of equipment items of a sufficient size that
evaluation and design can be carried out for the processing system for
a 1000-MW(e) MSBR.

The work required on fluorination and fuel reconstitution consists
of studies of the chemistry involved with these steps, the operation of
a fluorination facility that will be about 25% of the size required for
removing uranium from a 1000-MW(e)} MSBR, engineering studies of fuel re-
constitution, and the operation of a combined fluorination-reconstitution
facility that will be about 25% of the size required for a 1000-MW(e)
MSBR. At the end of this time, sufficient information should be avail-
able to allow the evaluation and design of continuous fluorinators and
fuel reconstitution systems for full-scale processing plants. It is
estimated that this work will require about three vears for completion.

The work remaining on the reductive extraction of uranium and prot-
actinium consists of hydrodynamic studies of countercurrent contact of
salt and bismuth in molybdenum equipment, operation of the continuous
reductive extraction process facility (25% of 1000-MW{e} MSBR scale),
and an engineering demonstration of the steps involved in isolation of
protactinium using representative protactinium concentrations. This work
will require about 3.5 years for completion.

Work on rare-earth removal by the metal transfer process consists of
operation of engineering experiment MIE-3 (1% of 1000-MW(e)} MSBR scale)
and operation of engineering experiment MTE-4 (5 to 10% of 1000-MW(e) MSBR
scale}. This work will require about three vears for completion.

The final area of work required for demonstrating the processing
technology consists of operation of an integrated processing experiment.
The system will be between 25% and 100% of 1000-MW({e) MSBR scale and will
contain all steps required in the processing plant. With a reasonable
funding level, this work could be completed within the next six years.

Overall Evaluation of Processing Capability

We believe that the probability is quite high that we will be able
to develop the technology required for processing the fuel salt from an
MSBR. We presently know of no major obstacles to the isolation of prot-
actinium by the fluorination—reductive extraction method; however, if
some difficulty does arise, oxide precipitation appears to represent a
viable alternate method for protactinium isolation. The work on fluocri-
nation is progressing well and is expected to culminate in the successful
development of continuous fluorinators.

Although the metal transfer process for removal of rare earths re-
quires the use of molten bismuth containing reductant, several candidate
materials of construction for this portion of the plant appear to be ac-
ceptable. We expect that careful design of salt-metal contactors will
prevent entrainment of bismuth in the fuel salt and that the concentra-
tion of bismuth can be reduced to the required low levels. On-line in-
struments have been developed for use in processing experiments, and
efforts to develop the additional instrumentation required for a process-
ing plant should be successful.

12, MAINTENANCE

E. C. Hise, R. N. Haubenreich, R. B. Briggs
Concept

The maintenance of reactors requires the performance of various
mechanical operations on equipment which, because of radioactive con-
tamination and activation, is not directly accessible to maintenance
personnel. Depending upon the level of activity, the size of equip-
ment, and the design provisions for maintenance, anything from simple
local shielding to fully remote manipulation may be required. The
time required to do maintenance and the cost of the maintenance pro-
visions increase with the degree of remoteness required.

The circulating-fuel reactor has fission products and intense
radiation to contend with not only in the reactor vessel but also in
all of the primary circuit through which the fuel salt circulates and
in the off-gas system. If the fuel processing plant is integral or
on-site as it will be for am MSBR, the maintenance of that plant is
essentially part of reactor maintenance. Thus the circulating-fuel
reactor requires radioactive maintenance of a greater scope than does
a fixed-fuel reactor. On the other hand, the refueling operation is
simpler, the radioactivity is retained on-site within one containment,
and the necessity of a separate maintenance organization and equipment
for a fuel reprocessing plant at another site is avoided.

Although maintenance design efforts cannot affect the size and
activity level of the components in a reactor, much can be done in the
design stages of a plant to influence strongly the degree of accessi-
bility and the complexity of the maintenance operation. The maintenance
concept for an MSBR is characterized by the general principles:

1. Each system is composed of manageable units joined by suitable
disconnects.

2. Each unit is accessible and replaceable from directly above through
removable shielding.

3. Failed units are removed and replaced.

The concept is described succinctly in the following quote [1] as
applied to the MSRE.

"Reduced to fundamentals, the MSRE is a collection of
component parts which are capable of being disconnected and
reconnected remotely. Access to these units is provided
through removable shielding sections that make up the roofs
of the various cells. A portable maintenance shield is in-
stalled over the component, the roof section is removed, and

365
366

long-handled tools are used to do the manipulations that are

required. This portable shield provides shielding, access

holes, lighting, and maneuverability. The tools are, for the a
most part, simple, strong, and single purpose. Periscopes

and lead glass windows in the shield provide viewing in the
work area. All preparations for removal are done completely
with the portable shield. After large components are prepared
for removal with the same technique, they are removed by means
of a crane operated by personnel inside a shielded control room

with closed-circuit television and liquid-£filled windows for wa
viewing. Small components are removed by use of suitable
transport shields. A hot-equipment storage cell and a de-
contamination cell can be reached by the crane so that con-
taminated equipment can be disposed of conveniently.

"The ability to completely disconnect a particular
component is basic to this system. The disconnects must
be remotely operable by the long-handled tools. They must
be reliable both for the service conditions and for the
high radiation and in some cases must satisfy nuclear wE
safety considerations of containment leak tightness and
leak detectability. A number of different disconnects
are used at the MSRE for the various applications. Almest ao
all the piping in such auxiliary systems as the offgas,
lubricating oil, air, and cooling water systems have
standard ring joint flanges, with minor modifications.
Special designs were used for leak detector tubing,
thermocouple, electrical and instrument leads.

 

"The maintenance philosophy in use for most parts wk
of the MSRE is to replace a failed, contaminated unit
with a spare component. Spares are built in jigs to
assure interchangeability. Pieces that are small and
not too radioactive are partly decontaminated and re-
paired by direct contact with the help of local shield-
ing to reduce the radiation level. To satisfy the re-
quirements of the MSRE, a constant review was made of
the component and installation design to insure that
it was maintainable and, where necessary, mockups were
constructed to assist in guiding the designers.”

 

 

A detailed description of the MSRE maintenance system is given in

reference 2. In the MSRE, only the simplest of inspections and repairs

could be done on failed equipment in the cell that was provided. In am

MSBR, economy would dictate a larger cell with the capability of repair-

ing large and expensive equipment items. wi

Technological Background

During the past 15 years or so, the nuclear industry has acquired a
great deal of experience in the maintenance of radioactive systems. Some
has come from having to make repairs under very difficult conditions. A
few such jobs have necessitated undesirable exposure of personnel; others
have required ingenious devices and very long times to accomplish. Al-
though these feats have been instructive, they are not models to follow.
The goal in designing a reactor is not only to make maintenance possible,
but to make it as sure, as safe and as economical as it can be. The kind
of experience that points the way is that acquired with these plants in
which maintenance was planned, provided for, and uneventfully carried out
despite high levels of radioactivity. There has been experience of this
sort in various USAEC installations, both with reactors and with chemical
processing plants, that provides a broad technological basis for develop-
ing the maintenance system for an MSBR.

At ORNL we have operated four circulating-fuel reactors (ARE, HRE-1,
HRE-2, and MSRE), besides processing facilities of various kinds. Al-
though the level of radioactivity varied, they all had complex systems
for circulating, processing, and storing radioactive materials whose ac-
tivity levels denied direct access. The need for maintenance was recog-
nized in advance, and provisions were made in their design. Development
programs also included maintenance planning and practice. Some of the
ORNL experience with maintenance has been widely reported. The prepara-
tions for maintenance of the MSRE, the organization, and the conduct of
the maintenance operations actually performed on the MSRE are described
in reference 4 and the MSR Program semiannual progress reports from 1967
through 1971.

MSRE Preparations

Preparations for maintaining the MSRE began with the involvement of
maintenance specialists in the design, and continued through the construc-—
tion and startup phases [4]. The first scheme visualized for the MSRE
featured a bridge-mounted manipulator, operating in an enclosed space
above the reactor cell and controlled remotely with the aid of television.
(A maintenance development facility including a manipulator, viewing de-
vices, and equipment mockups had been used at ORNL to show the feasibility
of this approach.) Smaller jobs in the MSRE were to be done by the semi-
remote technique proved in the HRE-2, using simple, long-handled tools
manipulated by hand through small penetrations in a portable shield set
up over an opening in the cell's concrete roof. Design and planning soon
showed that all the maintenance work anticipated in the MSRE could be done
in this simpler way, and the manipulator idea was set aside.

The MSRE portable maintenance shield was a set of tracks and several
12-inch-thick steel slabs, with holes for tools and viewing devices, that
rolled on the tracks. Inserts for the holes included shielding windows,
lights, and split bushings to fit around tool shafts. When very free tool
movement was required, bags of steel shot around the shaft blocked the
368

radiation. Lifting devices permitted the remotely controlled building
crane to remove shield blocks or major equipment items. Each removable
item had a bail at the center of gravity or other provisions to simplify
lifting. Guides were provided where necessary to steer replacement parts
into place. To ensure proper fit, jigs were built for all the major re-
placeable components. The 5-inch salt lines were provided with flanges
that used frozen salt as a barrier to keep molten salt away from the ring
gasket. Machines were developed (and fixtures installed in the cell for
them) that could cut the 1-1/2-inch lines to the drain tanks, prepare the
ends, bring old and new pieces together, and join them by brazing. The
only tools required for most operations were simple, long-handled hooks,
wrenches, and clamps characterized by their reliability rather than by
their versatility.

During the installation of the reactor equipment and the prepower
testing, many of the maintenance provisions were tested. All of the pri-
mary loop was assembled on a large jig before going into the cell and
optical tooling was used to locate precisely reference points in the cell.
Maintenance items that were tested included the crane, lifting and viewing
devices, and all kinds of disconnects. Freeze flanges were opened and
closed; a cell space ccoler, the control rods, rod drives and a cere
sample array were removed and replaced; the primary heat exchanger and
fuel pump bowl were installed using in part the remote maintenance provi-
sions. After the nuclear startup experiments the fuel pump rotary element
was removed, inspected and reinstalled. During this time personnel were
trained and procedures were perfected.

Extent of MSRE Experience

 

The semi-remote jobs that were accomplished in the reactor and drain
tank cells during the 4-1/2 vears of nuclear operation are summarized in
Table 12.1. With the exception of those carried out in 1965 (before high-
power operation}, all of the jobs involved components that were located
in radiation fields of several thousand R/hr. The radioactivity of the
items that were removed varied widely; some, such as the specimens that
were removed from the core 5 to 7 days after shutdown, would have read
several hundred R/hr at several feet if they had been unshielded. All of
the jobs involved use of the remote maintenance control room, at least
for setting up and removing the maintenance shield. The cell top mem-
brane was cut, welded, and inspected each time maintenance was done.

In addition to the maintenance in the reactor and drain tank cells,
there were several jobs invelving highly radicactive components in other
parts of the building. Valves and filters in the off-gas system were
removed and replaced, and heaters were installed on the inlets of the
off-gas charcoal beds. The fuel sampler~drive mechanism had to be re-
paired on several occasions, which required that a temporary woed-and-
plastic containment enclosure be set up inside the reactor building.

The post-operation examinations carried out between November 1970
and February 1971 involved viewing in the core and in the fuel pump,
cutting out several parts of the fuel salt system, and plugging some

the reactor: long-handled tools through the maintenance shield. Some of
the tools were quite different, however, to handle the special tasks.

The control rods and drives were removed, the 10-inch core access
plug with the rod thimbles was taken out, and a section of rod thimble
was cut off with a grinding wheel. A grinding wheel, mounted on a special
tool, was also used to cut through the pump tank around the sampler cage
so that it could be removed. An ll-inch section of the heat exchanger
shell was cut out with a plasma torch, then sections of 6 tubes were cut
with an abrasive cutoff tool and removed for inspection. Examination
showed that, as suspected, a small amount of salt (v2 in.3) had leaked
near a freeze valve in a drain line. The freeze valve and adjacent
piping was cut out and removed. The holes in the pump tank and the heat
exchanger shell were patched, the latter by welding, and plugs were in-
stalled in the severed ends of the drain lines.

Conclusions from MSRE

 

Although the major components of the fuel system, whose replacement
would have been more complicated than any job that was done, required no
maintenance, the MSRE experience was of sufficient extent to thoroughly
test the general strategy and many of the specific design features.

The MSRE maintenance was reliable: no job arose that could not be
done. An important factor in this was the flexibility of the maintenance
system which allowed cbstacles to be circumvented and unforeseen jobs
(such as those in the off-gas system) to be accomplished.

The experience with the MSRE emphasized that the payoff for prepara-
tion is tremendous in the case of radicactive maintenance. Jobs such as
replacing the core specimens went very quickly compared to others that
were basically less difficult, but for which no special provisions had
been made.

Especially valuable information on fission-product contamination
came from the MSRE experience. Noble gases behaved predictably and could
be purged before systems were opened. Salt-seeking fission products were
no problem — the salt drained cleanly and any that was trapped froze and
retained the fission products. There was no corrosion film or scale to
flake off and form dust. At least part of the noble metals that deposited
on surfaces in the off~gas system were fairly easily transferrable, but
particulate contamination was generally confined to the tools, which were
swabbed and bagged as they were pulled from the shield. Iodine that was
produced by the decay of tellurium on surfaces soon appeared in the gas.
Ventilation air from the reactor building and from the containment cells
was passed through particulate filters and up a stack. The greatest
amount of activity discharged in any week was less than 0.2 Ci (mostly
iodine) and occurred during work on the off-gas system.

Although radiation levels in the reactor cell were typically on the
order of several thousand R/hr while maintenance work was going on, the
general background to which workers were exposed while manipulating tools
was only about 0.01 R/hr. Procedures were planned to minimize personnel
exposure in locally higher radiation fields and the work was never seri-
ously inconvenienced by having to rotate workers. No maintenance worker
ever received more than the normal limit of 3 rem in any quarter.

Reference Design MSER

In designing and planning for the maintenance of the MSBR we have
evaluated and adapted the experience with the MSRE and other radioactive
systems. The maintenance system, as applied to the reference MSBR, is
discussed in some detail in ORNL-4541 [6].

MSBR maintenance requirements fit into the following four general
classes.

Class I — Permanent Equipment. - This category contains all those
items which can reasonably be expected to require no maintenance during
the design lifetime of the plant. Examples are the reactor vessel, the
pump vessels, primary heat exchanger shells, the fuel-salt drain tank,
thermal shielding, thermal insulation, the connecting process piping,
etc. No special provisions are included for maintenance of these items.
Emergency maintenance to some extent is possible, however, because of
the access that is provided primarily for in-service inspection.

 

Class 11 — Equipment Allowing Direct Maintenance. - This group in-
cludes the items which can normally be approached for direct maintenance
within a reasonable period of time (typically after the secondary salt
has been drained and flushed and the remaining activities allowed to
decay for about 10 days). The steam generators, reheaters, coolant-salt
pumps, and the equipment in the heat rejection cell fall into this class.
In the unlikely event that one of these components did become highly con-
taminated with fission products, its removal would be treated as a Class
III or IV item, discussed below. Once the sources of activity were re-
moved from the cell, cleanup and component replacement could proceed in
the normal fashion using direct maintenance.

 

Class III — Equipment Requiring Semidirect Maintenance. — Much of
the equipment in the offgas and chemical processing cells, such as pumps,
blowers, valves, processing vessels, filters, etc., will become radio-
active. In general, the sizes of these items are comparable to the MSRE
equipment. MSBR radiation levels may be a factor of 10 higher than in
the MSRE, however. The maintenance tools for this class of equipment
could be similar to those for the MSRE, but the shielding and containment
provisions would have to be more effective because of the more intense
sources of radiation.

 

Class IV — Large Equipment Requiring Remote Maintenance. - This
group includes items which are clearly beyond present experience because
of a combination of size, radiation level, afterheat removal, and dis-
posal considerations. Examples are the pump rotary element, the primary
heat exchanger tube bundle, and the core graphite.

The reactor primary system, because of the large size of the highly
contaminated equipment, presents the greatest problems in containing the
radicactivity and dealing with afterheat and is therefore used as the
basis for the discussion which follows.

 
372

Containment

Although the fuel salt and highly radioactive gases will be removed .
from any system before it is opened for maintenance, the reactor primary
system will still contain large amounts of radioactivity, some of which
will be transferable. The MSBR building and cells and the maintenance
equipment and procedures must, therefore, be designed so as to limit the ws
spread of radioactive material within the reactor building and to prevent
more than trivial amounts from being released cutside the building during
maintenance. st

The heating and the amounts of short-lived activity that must be
dealt with decrease rapidly during the first few days after cessation of
power operation. For this reason it is unlikely that the primary system
will be opened sooner than ten days after full-power operation is stopped.

Ten days after shutdown from long operation of 2250 MW(t), the noble-
metal fission products on surfaces may total about 2.2 x 108 curies, or
roughly 3 Xx 10° Ci per ft? of metal surface that had been exposed to the Ed
fuel salt. (This figure is based on the assumption that 757 of the noble
metals deposit on metal surfaces in the loop.) The deposited tellurium
will be generating iodine, some of which will go inte the gas or air con-
tacting the surface. At 10% sec (11.6 days) the calculated total rate at
which 2.3-h 1321 is generated from 78-h Te on surfaces is 2 x 106 Ci/hr
or about 30 Ci/hr per ft? of surface in the fuel circulating system.

Eight-day 1311 will be generated on surfaces at a total rate of about ww
5 Ci/hr or 7 x 107° Ci/hr per ftZ,

The noble gases in the graphite after 10 days could amount to as
much as 1.2 x 10° Ci (almost all 133%e), assuming none diffused out during da
the cooling period. The radicactive daughters of noble gases in the
graphite would likely range up to 1 x 1067 ci.

The inventories of the fission products that dominate at 10 days
after shutdown may be as much as 170 times those in the MSRE. (This
factor may be considerably lower if, as expected, the MSBR gas-stripping
system removes much of the noble metals.) The amounts per unit area
should be less than 5 times as great as in the MSRE, however.* Thus the =
observed behavior of the deposited fission products in the MSRE should
be rather similar to that to be expected in the MSBR.

Based on the MSRE experience, we expect that the noble metals on Fo
surfaces will be more or less adherent, depending on whether they are on
surfaces in the salt lcop or in the off-gas system, but that care must
be used to avoid knocking or scraping them off. Although there was un-
certainty in the fraction of the iodine generated on surfaces that came
off into the gas in the MSRE, it is clear that in the MSBR measures must
be provided that are adequate to deal with all of the iodine so generated.

“For the shortlived noble metals that are dominant a few days after
shutdown, the intensity on fuel loop surfaces is nearly proportional to ws
the ratio of power to loop surface area. For the reference MSBR this is
2.25 x 108/5.2 x 10% = 43 kW/ft?; for the MSRE the ratio was 7.4 x 103/8.5
x 10% = 9 kW/ft?, a
 

 

373

The noble-gas daughters in the graphite will not be readily transferable,
and should cause no contamination problem.

The MSBR building and equipment layout described in Chapters 3 and 9
are intended to permit safe containment of the radioactivity during main-
tenance. Before maintenance is started, the fuel salt will be secured
in the drain tank. (Normally it will be circulated for several days to
help remove afterheat before it is drained.) The system requiring mainte-
nance will then be purged of radicactive gases and, if necessary, cooled
down. The containment cell will then be unsealed and a maintenance shield
set up. The cell will be maintained at a slight negative pressure by an
air exhaust system. Tools and other items penetrating the maintenance
shield will be sealed to the shield so as to minimize air leakage into
the cell. (Boots or gas-buffered seals might be used.) Primary systems
will not be left open to the cell longer than necessary; if an equipment
item cannot be replaced immediately a temporary closure will be applied.
This will be required to minimize both the radioactive contamination of
the cell and the ingress of oxygen and moisture into the system. When
contaminated items are removed through the shield, they will be withdrawn
into casks through openings equipped with valves or flanges that will
close the reactor cell and the cask except during the transfer. Gener-
ally the gas streams passing through the cell will be filtered, passed
through absorbers and recirculated. Any excess gas will be stripped of
radioactivity before it is discharged to the atmosphere. Items removed
from the primary system will be repaired or prepared for disposal in a
hot cell where similar precautions must be observed. All operations will
be carried out inside the reactor building to assure complete containment.

The assurance of public protection during maintenance is comparable
to that during operation, although the lines of defense are different.
During operation, the fuel salt and highly radicactive gases are circu-
lating within the vessels and piping, which are in turn doubly contained,
being inside sealed cells inside the reactor building. During mainte-
nance, the fuel salt with most of the fission products will be sealed in
the drain tank, and the precautions that ensure that it will not be
brought out during the maintenance constitute primary containment for it.
Any system to be opened will be drained and purged so that when it is
finally opened, the amount of radioactivity that could conceivably escape
into the cell will be far less than that circulating (and liable to being
spilled through a pipe rupture in the design-basis accident) during oper-
ation. The first line of defense (''primary containment') for this limited
amount of radicactivity is the ventilation system that maintains the cells
at a negative pressure and removes any radioactive contaminants from the
exhaust stream before it is discharged into the reactor building. Sec-
ondary containment during maintenance is the same as during operation —
the sealed reactor building.

Afterheat
The fission products that will remain in the graphite and on sur-

faces in the fuel system will produce significant heating in the large
equipment items while the maintenance operations are going on. This must
374

be taken into account in the provisions for the major operations: re-
placement of the core graphite, the tube bundle of a primary heat ex-
changer, and perhaps the rotary element of a primary pump.

We estimate that 10% seconds (11.6 days) after shutdown from 2250
MW(t) the total heat generation rate in the primary system would be 770 kW,
consisting of 210 kW in the graphite of the core, 125 kW in each of the
four primary heat exchangers, and 60 kW distributed over the other sur-
faces. What the temperature in the primary system must be before it is
opened has not been decided. With the cell cooling system that we have
envisioned, the fuel system temperature 10 days after a shutdown would
likely be in the range of 500 to 1000°F. If further study of the mainte-
nance procedures indicates that this would be unacceptable, additional
heat removal must be provided or additional time allowed to reach a sat-
isfactory temperature. Some cooling must be continued while the item is
being removed, but the rate of temperature rise in the absence of cooling
would be low — 30°F/hr for a heat exchanger bundle and 2.4°F/hr for the
graphite core. The temperatures of the piping and rotary element of the
pump would rise even more slowly.

Graphite Replacement

 

As explained elsewhere in this report, because of neutron irradia-
tion damage, it will be necessary to replace the core graphite several
times during the life of the MSBR plant.* Consideration of the effects
on breeding and possibly on power distribtuion leads te removal of the
graphite while it is still structurally sound. Thus, although the removal
procedure must be capable of dealing with broken graphite elements, the
strength of the graphite should not hamper its handling.

In the ORNL reference MSBR [6], the upper head of the reactor vessel
and the entire core (176 tons of graphite and 97 tons of metal) are re-
placed as ag unit. This constitutes by far the largest maintenance task
in this conceptual design, and explains some important features of the
building layout and equipment described in Chapters 3 and 9. The major
item of special maintenance equipment required for the core replacement
is a 20-ft-diam x 40-ft-high shielded transport cask. The carbon steel
walls of the cask are about 2 in. thick, which is sufficient to reduce
the radiation level on contact with the outside of the cask to about 1008
R/hr and at the outside wall of the reactor containment vessel to less
than 0.1 R/hr after a 10-day decay period for the core. Conservative es-~
timates indicate that the 210 kW of heat being generated in the core can
be safely dissipated through the cask wall so that no cooling system for
the cask will be required. The reactor core assembly is prepared for
removal in a semidirect fashion through a work shield. The lifting of
the core assembly into the transport cask and transport to the spent core

®

An exception would be the low-power-density MSBR discussed in Chap-
ters 2 and 3, in which the core is made large enough and the power density
low enough that the graphite will last for the life of the plant.

 
375

storage cell, the installation of the new core assembly, and the replace-

ment of the shielding are accomplished from the remote maintenance control
room in the same fashion as the removal and replacement of large items of

MSRE equipment.

Ebasco Services and their associates in the industrial design study
questioned the desirability and practicality of replacing the entire core
at once. They elected instead to make the core of individually replaceable
elements, and decided that 15-in. hexagonal elements were the optimum
[7]. They would replace some of the graphite elements at 4-year inter-
vals, during major turbine-generator overhauls. Adoption of this scheme
would obviously greatly alter the requirements for handling tools and
casks for the exposed graphite.

Status

As stated earlier, the MSBR maintenance concept depends upon access
from above, a system of replaceable units, appropriate disconnects, and
tools to operate them. Thus it is clearly essential that maintenance
design be concurrent with plant design. This has been the case in the
conceptual studies to date. The maintenance techniques for fluid-fuel
reactors have evolved as the size, complexity, and radiation levels of
the reactors have increased. Design studies have not indicated any in-
surmountable problem in maintaining a 1000-MW(e) MSBR, and no serious
conflicts have arisen in imposing the maintenance requirements on the
reactor system.

Most of the techniques and many of the tools have been developed.
Several flexible maintenance shields have been built and used. Optical
viewing equipment — window inserts, periscopes, adequate lighting — all
are available. The use of a shielded maintenance control room with win-
dows, remotely-operable TV, and remotely-controlled crane and tooling has
been successfully demonstrated. Remotely-operable disconnects for elec-
trical power, instrumentation, and service piping are at a satisfactory
stage of development. The remote fabrication of brazed joints in small
system piping has been demonstrated in connection with the MSRE [2].

Two important techniques that are requisites for large power reactors
are not available, however. They are remote welding and in-service in-
spection and repair.

It is highly desirable from the standpoint of reliability that the
MSBR circulating fuel system be of all-welded construction. Thus remote
cutting and rewelding of the system piping will be required in the re-
placement of major components. The status of remote welding as of 1969
and the required development program were presented in reference 8. A
portion of that program has been accomplished and the present generation
of automatic welding machines are reliable and capable of making high-
quality welds. These machines are not now capable of fully remote welding,
but appear to be adaptable to this purpose. -

The provisions in the MSBR for access to equipment for maintenance
operation are equally applicable to in-service inspection. The state-of-
the-art of remote inspection of welded joints is reviewed in reference 9.
376

Dependable application of common methods for nondestructive inspection

of welds is difficult or impossible in high-temperature, high-radiation
fields. Some methods promise to be successful, however, and current AEC
and industrial programs are developing equipment, manipulators, and inter-
pretive methods for acoustic emission and ultrasonic holography monitoring
and inspection. These programs are expected to culminate in remote in-
spection methods for reactor welds which should be adaptable to MSBR con-
ditions and needs. The equipment and techniques for remote repair do not
exist; however, much of that development as well as the inspection devel-
opment is interchangeable with remote welding development.

Further Work

The program for maintenance development for the MSBR [1,6] consists
of three major elements:

1. The development of remote cutting and welding capability for replace-
ment of major items of equipment in the circulating fuel system.

2. The development of equipment and techniques for in-service inspection
and repair of fixed items of equipment in the circulating fuel system.

3. The concurrent design of a maintenance system that is integral with
the design of the reactor system and the development and demonstra-
tion of tools and techniques required for that specific reactor.

The development of remote cutting and welding requires the adapta-
tion or development of manipulators for remote placement, pipe alignment,
and control of the automatic welders and the plasma torches that are al-
ready available. Such a program could be started at any time.

The in-service inspection and repair operations will use essentially
the same tools and techniques that are required for the cutting and weld-
ing. Techniques for nondestructive examination should be pursued and the
most promising [9] should be adapted for the particular alloys and con-
figurations expected in the MSBR.

The development of equipment for maintaining a particular MSBR can-
not precede the design of the plant and the development of plant compo-
nents, but it should keep pace with it. The general scheme of semiremote
maintenance that was proved in the MSRE can be used for some parts of the
processing and off-gas systems, with only minor changes in shielding to
compensate for the higher intensity of radiation. For physically large
systems, on the other hand, it would not be practical simply to scale up
the tools used at the MSRE because they would tend to become too unwieldy
for use by hand. Thus some developments in handling equipment and changes
in the tool and component design will be required. The basic philosophy
of designing components to be maintained with simple, reliable tools ma-
nipulated intelligently and flexibly should be retained, however.

377

The conceptual design of systems for limiting the spread of radicac-
tive contamination during maintenance can proceed and should be carried
without delay far enough to define requirements on filters, seals, etc.

Evaluation

An absolute necessity for practical maintenance of an MSBR is the
early recognition of the eventual maintenance requirements. Maintain-
ability considerations must imbue the entire design effort, and mainte-
nance preparations must be thoroughly developed and tested in advance.

We are aware of these needs and they are reflected in our conceptual de-
signs.

The size of the equipment and the intensity of the radioactivity in
an MSBR are greater than we have dealt with before. Nevertheless, the
general philosophy that we have developed, many of our techniques, and
some of our tools are either directly applicable or readily adaptable.
Other tools to handle large, heavy equipment must be developed as the
needs are defined. In addition, the techniques and equipment for welding
and inspection that are now being developed in connection with other
kinds of reactors will have to be adapted and developed further for use
on an MSBR. It does not appear, however, that the maintenance of an MSBR
will impose unreasonable requirements for invention or development.

In summary, consideration of the state of the art and the foresee-
able development of the technology in relation to the needs of molten-salt
reactors leads us to conclude that by adequate planning and preparation,
the maintenance of an MSBR can be made reliable and safe. The costs of
the special provisions that must be made for maintenance of an MSBR have
not been estimated in detail, but they appear unlikely to be a decisive
economic factor.

M. I. Lundin C. W. Collins

Introduction

The Molten-Salt Reactor Program at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
has, since 1968, been focussed on a 1000-Mi(e), one-fluid MSBR. A study
that was completed by ORNL in 1970 produced the conceptual design that is
described briefly in Chapter 3 and in detail in reference 1. The Molten-
Salt Group, as part of their privately funded assessment of MSBR technology,
reviewed this ORNL design and issued a critique of it im 1971 [2]. Mean-
while, ORNL issued a request for proposals for an independent, AEC-funded,
industrial design study of MSBR's. A proposal from Ebasco Services was
accepted and in 1971 Ebasco and its industrial associates began work under
a subcontract with ORNL [3]. Task I of the study included developing an
MSBR plant concept from specified criteria. This task was completed and
a final teport issued in February 1972 [4].

This chapter deals with design work on the ORNL reference concept and
the alternative approaches propcsed by the Ebasco group. It identifies
the information on materials and the developments in high-temperature
design methods that will be needed. Finally it discusses the capital
cost estimates that have been made and their sensitivity to uncertainties.

Primary Systems Layout and Structural Design

Background and Status

 

The ORNL reference concept [1] was based on a "top" supported primary
system utilizing structural members in the cell roof for supporting the
suspended major equipment. The reactor vessel was anchored while the
heat exchanger and pumps were free to move except for the restraints im-
posed by the hangers. The piping flexibility analysis showed all stresses
toc be reasonable. However, only cursory evaluation was made of the ef-
fects of seismic forces, inertial stresses, or stresses due to thermal
shock. The basic assumptions made were that dashpots or other seismic
restraints could be added and that the effects of extreme transients
could be prevented or mitigated by proper system controls.

Ebasco Services, in their Task I conceptual design [4], came to the
conclusion that when the cell roof penetrations for maintenance access
were considered, there would be insufficient space in the structure for
equipment supports. In addition, when consideration was given to response
frequencies and amplification factor due to the 50-ft height of the equip-
ment layout, the requirements for seismic restraints made it desirable to
investigate alternate support systems. The cencept that Ebasco chose to
investigate used "bottom" reactor vessel and heat exchanger supports

379
380

with a three-level system of horizontal trusses {lateral supports} for
control of earthquake motions. They successfully ran flexibility and
stress analyses, and although an arrangement with acceptable stresses

was found, it turned out to be very sensitive te relatively minor changes
in layout and temperature assumptions. The design of equipment supports
and restraints will, therefore, require further detailed analyses.

Ebasco alsc took an alternative approach to ORNL on the question of
thermal transients. They investigated the requirements for directly
accommodating a shock without using special control features or devices.
For example, a system scram on loss of secondary coclant pumps or on a
steam line break could result in the primary system outlet line changing
from 1300 to 1050°F in 14 sec, or the inlet line changing from 1050 to
1300°F in 30 sec. Such transients would result in quite unacceptable
stress levels. As a remedy for this, Ebasco selected and analyzed a de-
sign using a thermal sleeve which isolated the flowing fluid from the
piping by an almost "stagnant" fluid layer between the piping and sleeve.
By taking advantage of the effect of low Reynolds number on heat transfer
coefficient in the annulus, they were able to reduce thermal-shock tran-
sient stresses tc negligible levels.

Sensitivity to Uncertainties

 

The differences in approach between Ebasco and ORNL-4541 concerning
reactor system laycut and structural support center mainly on methods of
supporting primary systems components and controlling temperature gra-
dients in components due to transients.

Neither the primary system supporting arrangement shown in the ORNL
reference design nor the one proposed by Ebasco has been completely
studied to the extent that all problems are known and solutions are in
hand. However, both organizations conclude that it is feasible to design
high temperature systems having flexibility for expansion and yet capable

of resisting seismic loads. The ORNL concept requires yet-to-be-developed

high temperature snubbers for seismic restraint, while the Ebasco concept
must show the effectiveness of a high temperature support system to sus-
tained and shock loads. Final design of the primary systems as well as
its support system will require detailed analysis to achieve an optimum
layout having the required flexibility and meeting the stress limitations
for all operating conditions. The stresses due to expansion have been
shown to be controllable to an acceptable level by adjusting the lengths

of piping while still maintaining a compact layout. Lengthening the lines
involves some increase in fuel salt inventory; however, most of the inven-

tory is in the reactor vessel, pumps, and heat exchangers.

The Ebascc analyses indicate that unless special measures are taken,
transient thermal stresses at several points in the primary system can
be excessive. Ebasco's solution, the use of thermal sleeves or liners
to eliminate direct contact between the coolant flow and the pressure
boundary, appears to provide protection, and in some cases may be the
only way stresses can be held down to acceptable levels. Thermal sleeves
probably involve additional cost, although in some places they may permit
less material in component fabrication, thereby compensating for at least
part of the cost of the liner.

Future Work

Future work on methods for limiting thermal stresses is dependent
upon selection of a material for the salt systems components. Additional
work can then follow to determine temperature profiles throughout the
system for all operating conditions, to perform detailed analysis of
stresses at critical locations in components, and to evaluate temperature
control systems, thermal liners, components supports, etc., that have
potential for enhancing feasibility, safety, and economics of the system.

Other areas which would receive design attention include use of
expansion joints at cell penetrations, methods of vessel fabrication
(e.g., shop vs on-site) and provisions for in-service inspection of com=-
ponents.

Evaluation

Although much work remains to be done before attempting to select
optimum configurations, methods for controlling transient thermal stresses,
and support systems for the primary systems, we believe the conceptual
work of both ORNL and Ebasce have defined the major problems and sug-
gested approaches that will lead to satisfactory solutions.

The mechanical design of MSBR vessels and piping must deal with a
variety of problems. Because of the high operating temperature, large
thermal expansions must be accommodated; but considerations of salt inven-
tory and pressure drop dictate that the piping be no longer than the mini-
mum necessary to provide flexibility and acceptable stresses. The large
temperature differences around the system lead to potentially high stresses
due to temperature gradients, particularly near nozzles, tube sheets, or
other structural discontinuities. Materials must operate in the creep
range, requiring design methods, appropriate for this situation, that are
only now being developed. The material contemplated for the salt systems
is modified Hastelloy N whose allowable design stresses, while expected to
be superior to those determined for standard Hastelloy N, have not been
established. Further, there is a possibility that the surface cracking
problem (Chapter 7) or some other consideration may require a different
material such as Inconel or stainless steel.

Status
Due to the limited effort that has been devoted to conceptual design,

only simplified elastic stress analyses were employed, primarily to size
components and toc evaluate design alternatives. Before actual components
382

could be built to satisfy the stringent requirements of the Nuclear Power
Plant Component Code, the metallurgical development work must be completed
to establish a thorough knowledge of the properties of the chosen alloy
and an exhaustive stress analysis must be made of all components cover the
entire range of design conditions.

Standard Hastelloy N is approved for use under Sections III and VIII.
of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code through code case approval.
Case 1315-3 approves use of Hastelloy N for pressure vessels constructed
in accordance with provisions of Section VIII, Division 1. Allowable
stresses are given for temperatures to 1300°F. Case 1345-1 approves use
of Hastelloy N for Class 1 nuclear vessels constructed in accordance with
provisions of Section III of the Code. Design stress intensity values
are provided only to 800°F, in common with other materials approved for
use under Section IIL.

Case 1331 provides rules for construction of Class 1 nuclear vessels
that are tec operate at temperatures above those provided for in Section
III. However, the recent revision, Case 1331-5, includes only 304 and
316 stainless steels and requires a thorough knowledge of the material
properties to establish the design stress intensities. Extensive stress
analyses are also required using techniques just now coming into use and,
in fact, unproven for many materials, including Hastelloy N. Thus, be-
fore Hastelloy N can be used at elevated temperatures, a materials testing
program adequate for code approval must be completed and Case 1331 must
be revised to include the new material.

Strength of standard Hastelloy N above 930°F is limited by creep
effects, making it necessary to employ design rules, analysis methods,
and stress limits which reflect the time-dependence of material proper-
ties and structural behavior. Modes of failure considered by the design
rules of Code Case 1331-5 include: ductile rupture from short-term load-
ings, creep rupture from long-term loadings, creep-fatigue failure, and
gross distortion due to incremental collapse and ratchetting. Brief out-
lines of design methods are also provided for the following modes of
failure: loss of function due to excessive distortion, buckling due to
short-term loadings, and creep buckling promoted by changes in geometry
due to creep deformation associated with long-term loadings.

Design methods to cover these requirements are currently being de-
veloped and applied to the LMFBR program. They can be used to design
MSBR components and assure confidence in their reliability and safety.

Should current work result in the selection of stainless steel
instead of Hastelloy N, much of the needed materials information would
be available from the LMFBR program. There are indications that Inconel
may be used in some LMFBR components, in which case materials information
for it also would be forthcoming.

Sensitivity to Uncertainties

 

Since no detailed analyses have been made of the thermal stresses
due to rapid temperature changes, stresses at nozzle to shell intersec—
tions, or other secondary and peak stresses, we do not know quantita-
tively what the values may be. The preliminary analyses do indicate that

383

most of the allowable stress is used up by primary and secondary discon-
tinuity stresses leaving very little for thermal and other secondary
stresses. The alternatives are lowering the design temperature, exer-
cising careful control of plant temperature variations, or insulating

the critical region of components against these rapid thermal changes

and careful design of components. All of these alternatives involve

some compromises in the conceptual design and will incur additional costs.

Final selection of the material may involve a compromise between
strength and other material properties, such as corrosion resistance,
resulting in the choice of material with lower allowable stresses than
we have anticipated. It is also possible that rigorous analysis may
show that there are regions in components where stress intensities cannot
be held to allowable levels even with ingenious designs and careful system
controls. In such a situation we could lower the MSBR operating tempera-
ture to a point where the design stress intensities would be acceptable.
This probably would not involve a large temperature decrease; for example,
the current allowable design stress intensity for the standard Bastellcy N
is 6000 psi at 1200°F compared to 3500 psi at 1300°F.

A change from Hastelloy N to either stainless steel or Inconel would
have some advantages. There is much experience in fabrication of compo-
nents using these materials by companies already having manufacturing
procedures and ASME code stamps. Stainless steel and Inconel have strength
similar to standard Hastelloy N but are much cheaper, so that the capital
cost of the MSBR should be reduced. If, however, the change in materials
entails reductions in the fuel salt temperature, there would be some
economic penalties tending to offset the capital cost savings. (See
discussion under "capital ceosts'.)

Future Work

Selection of the reactor material and establishing its mechanical
properties is the most important step before proceeding beyond the con-
ceptual design. The next step would be to obtain approval to use the
material for ASME Section III nuclear components at the design tempera-
tures and then do sufficient design and analysis to show that the compo-
nents are adequate for the design conditions.

The current inelastic stress analysis approach used in LMFBR work
considers the total strain at any instant of time to consist of three
parts: elastic, plastic, and creep strains. Discrete increments of time
are considered in which elastic-plastic and creep strains are computed
separately and added to obtain the total strain. Thus, in the present
state of the art, plasticity and creep are formulated independently, but
they are treated in the analysis procedure in a manner that approxi-
mately accounts for the simultameous elastic-plastic-creep behavior.

For elastic-plastic behavior in stainless steel it has been recom-
mended that the classical kinematic hardening model be used and that for
creep behavior the equation-of-state type constitutive theory based on
strain hardening be used. Cyclic behavior is based on a cyclic stress-
strain curve for the hardened material.
384

If stainless steel is used for the MSBR reactor material, inelastic
methods of analysis developed in the LMFBR program will be directly appli-
cable. If Inconel or Hastelloy N is used, most of the theoretical knowl-
edge from the LMFBR program will be applicable, but additional materials
information will be necessary to establish the hardening model for the
different strain components.

Evaluation

Excellent progress has been made recently in developing codes and
standards through the ASME and the AEC's RDT Standards Program which will
facilitate design and construction of MSBR components. The LMFBR High-
Temperature Design Methods Program is expected to develop analytical
methods for designing components with assurance of satisfactory perform-—
ance over their planned lifetimes. Even though a material other than
stainless steel will likely be used for MSBRs, the theoretical bases for
the design methods will have been established and only a reasonable
amount of testing of the reactor material will be necessary to develop
sufficient information to apply the design methods.

Capital Costs

Background and Status

 

ORNL estimated the capital costs for building the reference 1000-MW(e)
MSBR after completion of appropriate research and development programs and
found them to be comparable to current costs for light-water reactors of
similar size [1]. The Molten Salt Breeder Reactor Associates (MSBRA),
headed by Black and Veatch and funded by midwestern utilities, arrived at
a similar conclusion. In a study completed in 1970, they estimated that
the capital cost of a 1000-Md(e) MSBR would be about 10 percent less than
the cost of a pressurized water reactor of the same capacity [5,6]. The
Reactor Assessment Panel of the Edison Electric Institute, in their 1970
evaluation [7], used capital costs for MSBR's equal those for light-water-
cooled reactors. Ebasco has not yet made a detailed cost estimate, but
will do so as part of their current study.

The accuracy of absolute cost estimates for the MSBR reactor plant
equipment is limited by several factors, including the preliminary nature
of the designs to date, -and especially by the uncertainties discussed
below. Direct comparisons with light-water-cooled reactors are hampered
to some extent by the major differences in design and materials for the
two reactors. On the other hand, only about one-third of the total cost
of a nuclear power plant is for reactor equipment, the remainder being
for the heat-power system, general facilities, and indirect costs, which
are expenses that can be accurately compared. It is the comparative
approach to cost estimation that has led ORNL to conclude that the costs
of a fully developed MSBR will be roughly the same as for a PWR.

We estimate the cost of reactor plant equipment (excluding contin-
gencies) to be about $3 million more for a 1000-MW(e) MSBR than for a
1000-MW(e) PWR. (The MSBR involves more expensive materials, special
provisions for maintenance, and other unusual design features that are
only partially offset by savings due to its lower pressure and lower
thermal rating.) Our estimates allow $6 million more for contingencies
on reactor plant equipment in the MSBR than in the PWR. Special mate-
rials add $1 million more to the cost of the MSBR. On the other hand,
the cost of the turbine plant equipment are $12 millicn less for the high-
temperature MSBR than for the PWR, according to our estimates. After
adding in the indirect costs we arrive at a difference of $2 million
between the two reactors [1, p. 151], which is insignificant compared
with the uncertainties.

Sensitivity to Uncertainties

 

High~temperature stress considerations could conceivably require
lowering the reactor outlet temperature from 1300 to 1200°F. Lowering
the fuel temperature does not necessarily mean that the steam temperature
in the heat-power system must also be reduced. The steam could be held
to the reference design conditions of 3500 psia 1000°F/1000°F, by in-
creasing the primary heat exchanger area by about 60% and the pumping
capacity by the same amount to compensate for the reduced temperature
difference. This would probably be done by adding cooling loops, result-
ing in 60% additional cost for the heat exchangers, pumps, and piping,
plus additional building cost to provide the needed layout area. The
overall capital cost would increase about 6% in this case. Another ap-
proach would be to lower the steam design condition to 3500 psia
90C°F/900°F, thereby reducing the thermal efficiency of the cycle from
about 44 to 427. For a thermal efficiency of 42%, the thermal capacity
of the reactor plant would have to be about 2400 MW{t) rather than the
2250 MW(t) used in the conceptual study. If it is assumed that capital
cost is directly proportional to the thermal capacity, the estimated cap-
ital cost will increase about 6.6% due to the lowered efficiency. Thus
it appears that either approach would result in about the same captial
cost increase. (Fuel costs would be different.) If the same material
is used for the salt systems, lowering the temperature dces allow higher
design stress limits, which could permit thinner sections and less mate-
rial in component fabrication. Alternatively, less expensive material
might be used. No credit has been claimed for these possibilities in
the foregoing estimates.

In our estimates for the reference MSBR, the cost of equipment made
of Hastelloy N amounted to 29% of the total plant capital cost [1]. Only
about one~third was the cost of Hastelloy N, the remainder of the cost of
this equipment being mostly shop labor. Thus, although we recognize that
there is considerable uncertainty in projecting the cost of Hastelloy N
to that which will prevail when MSBR's are being built in quantity, the
effects on the plant cost estimates are not likely to be dominant. If it
were possible to substitute stainless steel or Inconel for Hastelloy N
386

without any penalty from having to operate at lower temperature, signifi-
cant savings might be achieved in the 297 of the plant cost that is
associated with Hastelloy N equipment. a
The cost of the MSBR graphite is particularly uncertain, partly
because it is not yet clear whether sealing, which may account for half
of the cost, is economically desirable. (See Chapter 7.) The graphite
cost is not a large fraction of the plant capital cost, however, amounting
to 6% in the estimate for our reference design [1].
Of equal importance with the capital cost is the plant availability.
Here molten-salt breeder reactors tend to have an advantage since they ws
do not require periodic shutdown for refueling as do solid-fuel reactors.
In the ORNL design, changing out the graphite core is scheduled every
four years to coincide with the major turbine maintenance, so no additional as
time is lost for this. (Ebasco's design involves replacing portions of
the core at similar intervals.) No credit for the additional availability
for not having to refuel was taken in our cost estimates, however, in
order to provide an additional margin in case the maintenance of radio-
active equipment requires more time than is needed for maintenance of
solid-fuel reactors.

Evaluation

 

MSBR capital cost estimates involve considerable uncertainties due
to uncertainties in design. The cost of Hastelloy N and graphite affects
about 357% of the capital investment. Comparisons indicate that the capi-
tal costs of MSBR's will be roughly the same as for light-water-cooled
reactors.

Conclusions

Uncertainties still exist as to what reactor material will be fi-
nally selected for MSBR's and in some of the methods for designing high-
temperature components. Once the choice of materials is made, work under
way for the LMFBR program, plus a reasonable amount of material properties
testing, should provide satisfactory high-temperature design methods for
MSBR's.

Several capital cost advantages of MSBR's over light-water reactors 5
appear to offset additional costs associated with the dispersal of radio-
activity in the liquid-fuel system. Hence, our estimate that the capital
costs of fully developed MSBR's will be about the same as those of present
LWR's seems plausible, and an examination of the uncertainties in the cost
comparison indicates that they do not represent a large percentage of the
total cost.

14. ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS AND SAFETY

R. B. Briggs, J. R. Engel, P. N. Haubenreich

General Considerations

A molten—-salt breeder reactor can be operated with acceptable effect
on the environment and the health and safety of the public provided that
the radioactive liquids and gases that circulate throughout much of the
plant are managed carefully. Thermal effects are like those for any
plant with a high-temperature steam cycle. Because the MSBR processing
plant is attached directly to the reactor there is no need for shipment
of short-cooled fuel. Fission products extracted from the fuel salt are
stored as solids or concentrated noble gases for shipment after long decay.
Tritium that is produced in the fuel salt in substantial quantities
presents special containment problems. Much of the tritium is expected
to diffuse through the walls of the tubes of the primary heat exchangers
into the salt in the secondary system. Tritium can be extracted from
the secondary salt and stored, but unless very special measures are taken
some tritium can be expected to diffuse into the steam system and be

discharged from the plant in the otherwise uncontaminated blowdown.

This blowdown would be the only significantly radicactive effluent from
the plant during normal operation. When the primary systems of an MSBR
are opened for maintenance, the copious amounts of fission products dis-
tributed throughout the systems require that stringent precautions be
taken to prevent undesirable releases into the atmosphere. By use of
evaporators and demineralizers to process laboratory wastes and the
liquids that are used for decontaminating and washing radioactive
equipment during maintenance, the radioactivity discharged in these
liquids can be kept to insignificant amounts.

With regard to safety from large accidents, the use of fluid fuel
places some special requirements on the design and operation of an MSBR.
At the same time it eases or eliminates some requirements that are impor-
tant in solid-fuel reactors. Although it is clear a priori that different
measures must be taken to ensure safety, whether these measures are more
or less complex and expensive in an MSBR than in other reactor systems
can be determined only by a comprehensive analysis that begins with the
most basic considerations. ,

Analysis of the safety of any nuclear power plant involves factors
that can be categorized under two headings — nuclear safety and radio-
logical safety. The first includes primarily those characteristics of
the plant that determine the possible changes in the reactivity of the
core and the resulting response of the nuclear power and the temperatures
and pressures in the primary system. By radiological safety we mean the
protection of the public and the plant operators against excessive expo-
sure to radiation under all conditions. Radiological safety depends on
several measures, including successive containment barriers, to minimize
releases during normal operations and to guarantee that dangerous amounts

389
390

of radioactivity do not escape under the worst credible condition. The
two areas are, of course, interdependent, since the absolute criterion

of nuclear safety is that conditions which could overwhelm the radioclogi-
cal safety provisions must never occur.

In an MSBR, fission products are always distributed throughout the
reactor and the processing systems, in contrast with conventional reactors
where the fission products are normally contained within fuel elements
in the core. Thus, for an MSBR to have equivalent overall containment,
greater requirements must be placed on the containment barriers from
the fuel salt outward. On the other hand, the fuel-coolant barrier in
a solid-fuel reactor, interposed as it is between the heat source and
the cooling fluid, is the barrier most vulnerable to damage in a nuclear
excursion so that its protection and the consequences of its failure tend
to impose more restrictive nuclear safety requirements on a solid-fuel
reactor. These are the obvious differences; others are brought cut in
the discussion of the reference-design MSBR which follows.

Characteristics of Reference-Design MSBR

This section deals primarily with the large MSBR station, includ-
ing a reactor and fuel processing plant, that is described in Chapter 3.
The purpose, however, is to delineate the important factors that must be
considered for any molten-salt reactor. Environmental effects of normal
operations are considered first, then the various topics that relate to
the threat of a large accident.

Environmental Effects of Normal Operation

 

Waste heat must be dealt with as in any thermal power plant, but
the high-temperature MSBR can use the most efficient steam cycle that
is available so that heat rejection is minimal. In the reference design,
with a plant thermal efficiency of 44%, 1225 MW(t) of heat goes into
condenser water when the net electrical output of the plant is 1000 MW(e).
Another 43 MW(t) is rejected from the drain-tank cooling system and plant
heat losses.

The expected rate of discharge of radionuclides in gaseous effluents
during normal operation of an MSBR station is extremely small. Helium
that contacts the fuel salt in the reactor 1s recycled after passing
through a cleanup system whose only output is tritium and noble gases
in sealed containers [1, p. 108]. Gases in the processing plant are also
recycled except for a 0.5-scfm stream of hydrogen that is vented after
its fission products, are trapped on charcoal [2, p. 25]. Alternatively,
this hydrogen might be sent to the reactor part of the plant for use in
removal of tritium. The coolant salt cover-gas system includes provisions
for removing tritium that reaches the coolant system. The tritium that
diffuses out of the high-temperature salt systems into the containment
cells is removed from the cell atmosphere recirculation system as HTO.
Much of the tritium in the steam system blowdown (see below) probably

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

a

3%1

would be discharged into the air if wet cooling towers were used. Other-
wise very little of the steam system tritium would go into the air.

Tritium presents an unusual problem in molten-salt reactors because
about 2400 Ci/day is produced in the fuel salt of a 1000 MW(e) reactor
and it readily diffuses through most metals at the high temperatures of
MSBRs .*

Calculations indicate that in the reference MSBR about 790 Ci/day
of tritium might reach the steam system [3]. Virtually all of this would
be released by normal system blowdown into the condenser cooling water.
Discharge of 790 Ci/day in a 560,000 gal/min stream produces a concen-
tration of 260 x 1073 uCi/liter. This is 52 times the 5 x 1073 uCi/liter
concentration used as a design objective for liquid effluents for light-
water-cocled nuclear power reactors [4]. Presumably molten-salt reactors
will be required to attain similar low concentrations, so the unhindered
discharge of tritium in liquid effluents from the reference-design MSBR
is unacceptable. Several modifications in the design or operation of
the reference plant have the potential for drastically reducing the
amount of tritium that reaches the steam system. These will be discussed
later in this chapter.

Sampling such highly radioactive fluids as those in the MSBR without
releasing radionuclides to the environment is no simple matter. Experience
has shown, however, that zero release is quite practicable when sampling
equipment and procedures are designed for total containment. To accomplish
this, MSBR sampler lines have multiple closures and terminate in chambers
with a controlled atmosphere that is recirculated through a purification
system.

Another occasion that requires special precautions to prevent release
of radicactivity to the environment is the opening of a system for mainte-
nance. As described in Chapters 9 and 12, the MSBR containment and mainte-
nance provisions are designed to confine any radioactive contamination to
restricted areas.

Nuclear Safety

The general principles of nuclear safety are the same for all reactors.
Small fluctuations in reactivity should produce only highly damped power
oscillations. Large, rapid increases in reactivity should be difficult to
produce and be easily controlled before the resulting power excursions pro-
duce damaging temperature or pressure excursions. The characteristics of
the MSBR plant are such that these principles are satisfactorily met.

The continuous removal of fission products and the adjustment of the
fissile inventory in the fuel salt during operation of the MSBR minimize
the amount of excess reactivity that must be compensated by control rods
and hence limit the potential for rapid increases in reactivity associated

*Nearly all is produced by neutron absorptions in lithium. By com-
parison, tritium production in 1000 MW(e) plants amounts to 40-530 Ci/day
for light-water, high-temperature gas-cooled, and fast-breeder reactors
and 3500-6000 Ci/day for heavy-water reactors.
392

with this excess. In the reference-design MSBR, the maximum amount of
excess reactivity that must be compensated by rods under normal conditions
is expected to be less than 1% 8k/k. wi

The fissile material in the on-line processing systems amounts to
less than 1% of the reactor inventory. If all this could be returned to
the reactor, the excess reactivity would be increased only 0.4% or less.
Furthermore, conceivable rates of introduction are quite inconsequential, ,®
and any unwanted reactivity increase from this source can easily be stopped.

Decay of precursors in the fuel circulating outside of the core reduces
the effective delayed-neutron fraction from 0.30% to 0.12% in an operating wa
MSBR. Thus one result of a cessation of flow is a 0.18% &k/k reactivity
increase in a time on the order of the half-lives of delayed-neutron pre-
cursors. Somewhat larger reactivity effects of stopping and starting i
fuel circulation could result from the perturbations of temperatures and
the effects of changing pressure on gas bubbles in the core.

The maximum effect of temperature changes is shown by the following
argument to be quite manageable. The reactivity coefficient for changes
in temperature of the entire core (-0.9 x 1075 °¢™l) is much smaller
than the coefficient for the fuel alone (-3.3 Xx 1075 °c”! for a uniform

 

change of fuel temperature over the entire core). Thus the upper bound i
on reactivity effects due to a temperature change in the core corresponds
to cooling all the core fuel (and none of the graphite) from the maximum
operating temperature (705°C) to the fuel liquidus temperature (500°C). i

This is only about 0.7% ék/k. Effects actually attainable are smaller
and, because they can be produced only by inflow of cocler salt, occur
with time constants of at least several seconds. The safety rod system
is quite capable of preventing power excursions due to such effects.
Because of the strong absorptions in thorium in the fuel salt, dis-
placement of a small fraction by voids has a positive effect on reactiv-
ity. There are, in principle, two ways this could occur: 1) by increases
in the volume fraction of circulating, noncondensable gas and 2) by boiling
of the fuel salt. Neither of these processes appears toc be capable of
producing changes of sufficient magnitude to represent a safety problem.
Under normal operating conditions the fuel salt in an MSBR contains
0.2 to 1.0 vol %Z of helium bubbles. This gas is introduced and removed
continuously to strip 135%e. Thus, changes in the rate of addition or
removal or changes in system pressure will change the core void fraction.
At 1 vol 7%, the voids in the reactor core represent about 0.039% in reac-
tivity. A complete depressurization of the fuel system, which would allow
these bubbles to expand by a factor of 2 to 3, would cause a reactivity
increase of only about 0.1% 8k/k. In addition to the bubbles, the salt
contains some dissolved helium and the pores of the graphite contain
substantially more. Although the total amount of helium in the graphite

 

 

The rate of reactivity increase would be only 5 Xx 107%% Sk/k per n
second if the 3 liter/min salt stream from the processing plant to the

49,000-1liter reactor fuel system contained twice the normal uranium

concentration.
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

393

is large, the rate at which it can diffuse cut is limited so that for
reasonably attainable rates of pressure loss in an MSBR (v -2 psi/sec)
the combined reactivity effect due to bubble expansion and graphite out-
gassing is only 0.005 (% 6k/k)/sec or less.

Voiding of a few fuel channels by local boiling (as might result
if flow blockages occurred in individual fuel passages) 1s not a severe
event. The positive reactivity effect associated with 100 empty fuel
cells® at the average nuclear importance for the central core region is
less than 0.5% 6k/k. Because the boiling temperature (at 1 atm) is more
than 700°C above the normal operating temperature of the salt, the energy
input required to heat the salt to the boiling temperature over much of
the core in a short time would require a nuclear excursion larger than
any produced by credible reactivity inputs. Thus, boiling in the core
will not come into play as a positive reactivity feedback in any nuclear
excursion originating with the reactor at or near normal temperature.

Displacement of small amounts of fuel salt by graphite produces a
positive reactivity effect. At the center of the core {the most sensi-
tive spot) the effect amounts to 2.9 x 107%% 6k/k per cm3. Conceivable
events, including sudden redistribution of clearances in response to
flow changes or accumulated stresses, produce no reactivity increase of

“much consequence.

A unique consideration in fluid-fuel reactors is the possibility of
inhomogeneity of the fissile material in the circulating fuel. Specif-
ically of concern is gradual segregation of fissile material outside the
core, followed by rapid introduction with the incoming stream. The MSBR
fuel salt, as described in Chapter 5, is quite stable over a range of
conditions much wider than the anticipated deviations. Segregation of
uranium could conceivably be produced by introduction of reducing agents
or oxygen into the salt, but adequate protection against this is provided
in the MSBR.

The response of the nuclear power to reactivity increases 1s governed
by the temperature coefficients of reactivity and the action of the con-
trol rods and safety rods. Because the delayed neutron fraction is un-
usually small, the MSBR power responds rapidly tec reactivity increases.

The reactivity coefficients for uniform changes in fuel and graphite
temperatures are listed in Table 14.1. In response to reactivity trans-
ients, core temperature changes will not be uniform, however. In partic-
ular, the graphite will change temperature much more slowly than will the
fuel salt. (In the central core region, graphite comprises about 90%
of the heat capacity but only about 8% of the nuclear heat source is in
the graphite.) Consequently, heating of the fuel salt results in a prompt,
negative response of reactivity to a power excursion. This response is
great enough to limit effectively the initial power surge caused by any
credibly rapid increase in reactivity. Thus safety rods are not required
to operate unusually fast. The total core temperature coefficient (fuel

plus graphite) is quite small, however, and might be positive. (The cal-
culated value is negative, but the margin of uncertainty is such that the
coefficient could turn out to be positive.) As a result, safety-rod action
is required to prevent wide variations in temperature that would otherwise
result from any reactivity change that persists more than a few seconds.

In summary, the nuclear safety characteristics of the reference MSBR
are such that a reactivity excursion leading to a breach in the fuel sys-
tem containment is highly unlikely.

Radicnuclide Decay Heating

From the standpoint of reactor safety, the chief importance of radie-
nuclide decay heat lies in whatever threat it may pose to the integrity
of the primary system.

In an MSBR, the fission products and transmutation products and the
heat produced by their decay are distributed through the reactor systems
and the processing facility in a manner that depends on the physical
features of the plant, the chemistry of the radionuclides, and the extent
of reprocessing of the fuel salt. In the reference design MSBR after
several months of operation at its design power of 2250 MW(t), the total
decay heat rate is about 152 MW, distributed as shown in Table 14.2.

Most of the heat is generated in the fuel salt by the decay of all classes
of radioactive products with half lives of a few minutes or less and of
longer lived products that are soluble in the salt.

Krypton and xenon diffuse into the pores of the core graphite or
into the helium bubbles that circulate in the fuel salt and are removed
to the drain tank. About 807 of the energy of decay of the gases that
reach the drain tank is released in the tank. The remainder is released
in the carbon beds. For the purposes of conservative design, each daughter
atom of a noble gas atom is assumed to deposit on the surface nearest the
point of decay of the parent atom and there to release its heat. This
certainly is the situation in the graphite and in the carbon beds. Depend-
ing on the design, daughter atoms born in the off-gas lines or drain tank
could either be dissolved in fuel salt and returned to the primary system
or be carried on with the gas stream.

The fission products from element 41, niobium, through element 52,
tellurium, are not stable.as metal ions under the normal redox conditions
in the fuel salt and are rapidly reduced to the elemental state.* These
metals are highly insoluble in the salt and are not wet by it, so they
tend to deposit on metal and graphite surfaces and collect at gas-liquid
interfaces. The distribution of the afterheat produced by these materials
then depends on their distribution among the various surfaces. Table 14.2
shows two calculated distributions for the afterheat from metallic fission
products, reflecting uncertainties in their physical distribution. The
first is based on an assumed sticking coefficient — that is, the probability
that a fission-product atom remains on the surface to which it migrates —

*
Because of this tendency to exist in the elemental state, these

fission products are frequently referred to as ''moble metals™ in MSR's.

of 1.0 for metal and graphite surfaces and 0.1 for bubble surfaces. For
the second distribution, the sticking coefficient for gas bubbles was
increased to 1.0 and no reentrainment was allowed in the salt in the
drain tank. The daughters of noble metals are alsc noble metals which
tend to remain where the parent was deposited except for iodine, the
daughter of tellurium. In the presence cof flowing salt, iodine returns
to the liquid phase; otherwise it remains on or near the surface at which
it was formed.

The fuel processing system is the final location in which a sub-
stantial amount of radioactive decay heat is released. The source of
heat there is roughly equally divided between 233pa and fission products
of intermediate to long life. Decay heat generation is a most important
factor in the design of this system. The operation of the processing
system scarcely affects the decay heating in the reacter during operation,
but does reduce the heating rates at longer times after shutdown (and
decay of the shorter-lived fission products). From the foregoing, it
is evident that three conditions of operation must be considered with
regard to release and removal of decay heat: normal operation at various
power levels, reactor shut down but fuel salt remaining in the primary
system, and reactor shut down with fuel discharged to the drain tank.

During power operation, the decay heat is only a small fraction of
the fission heat and is of no consequence in the primary fuel-salt
circulating system. In other parts of the fuel system and in the off-gas
system, the design must accomodate the heating from this source. (Stag-
nant lines and pockets where radicactive liquid or gas can reside must
be avoided, or cooling must be provided as necessary.)

The drain-tank cooling system normally operates at only one-third
of capacity, so here again the primary concern is to assure that the
heat production is reasonably uniform throughout the tank and that lines
leading from the primary system to the drain tank are cooled properly.

In the off-gas system and in the reprocessing plant the heat lcads during
normal operation are the design heat loads. There are no abnormal con-
ditions that could cause these heat loads to be exceeded by significant
amounts, so the primary concern in the design is to assure that the
cooling is distributed properly. Redundant capacity must be provided in
the cooling systems for the reactor drain tank, for the carbon beds in

the reactor off gas system, and for the fuel reprocessing system to assure
that cooling will be available at all times.

When the reactor is shut down, the radioactive decay heat decreases
with time as shown in Fig. 14.1. In a normal reactor shutdown, the fuel
salt is retained in the primary system for many hours, the primary pumps
continue to operate at full flow on the normal electric supply or at 10%
flow on pony motors driven by an emergency power supply. The secondary
pumps alsc continue to operate at flows in the range of 10 to 100%, de-
pending on the power supply. Heat is transferred from the primary salt
to the secondary salt, steam is produced at much reduced rates in the
steam generators and is discharged to the turbine condenser or to other
coolers. With 107 of their rated normal flow, two primary loops and
associated secondary loops will hold the temperature at or below the
normal level until 5 minutes after shutdown when one loop combination.
is sufficient. In the absence of cooling, the temperature of the pri-
mary system would rise to 1400 and 1500°F in 70 and 120 minutes,

respectively. The heat load in the drain tank begins to decrease
immediately after such a shutdown. Heat production in the off-gas
system decays more slowly and the heat production in the processing
plant is little affected for several hours.

Under accident or other unusual circumstances the fuel salt is
discharged to the drain tank for cooling. Discharge of salt from the
primary system into the drain tank could begin at shutdown and be com-
pleted in about 7 minutes. At this time the heat production rate in the
drain tank would be about 40 MW; the temperature of the salt would rise
to a maximum of 1400°F in a few hours and then fall to about 1000°F in
a few days, where it would be maintained by control of the cooling.

Conditions in the off-gas system and in the reprocessing plant
would not be affected significantly by draining the reacter, but the
conditions in the reactor primary system would be markedly different.
Draining of the fuel salt would remove the fluid that transports the
decay heat from the graphite to the primary heat exchangers. If the
secondary salt were drained from the heat exchangers at the same time,
the preferred means for removing the heat from the decay of noble metal
deposits on the heat exchanger tubes would also be removed.

Calculations have shown that the components and piping in the pri-
mary system could be designed to be cooled adequately by providing a
system that would maintain the cells walls at 1000°F. Heat would be
transferred by radiation and conduction within the components and
would be radiated to the cell walls. The temperature at the center
of the graphite core in the reactor vessel of the reference design
was estimated to reach a maximum of 1900°F after 14 hours, but the
vessel walls would not exceed 1400°F. With some modifications of the
current reference design, the center tubes of the primary heat exchangers
would not exceed 2000°F, and the outer shell would nct exceed 1400°F.
These temperatures are believed to be acceptable for the few times that
a drain at shutdown would be expected tec cccur in an MSBR. Delaying
the drain by 24 hours and cooling the plant to 1050°F during that time
would reduce the decay heat rates by a factor of about 10 and would
substantially reduce the temperature rise.

Interaction of Materials

According to the preceding sections, the integrity of the salt con-
tainment is not seriously threatened by either nuclear power excursions
or afterheat. In this section, we consider threats from (a) normal
system corrosion and (b) possible pressurization and enhanced attack
resulting from a small leak between coolant and fuel salt or between
steam and coelant salt.

Corrosion. — Hastelloy N is corroded by MSBR fuel salt under normal
conditions by reactions of the type

2UF, + M0 = 2UF; + MF,
400

The ratio UF3/UFy in the fuel salt is maintained at a value such that
equilibrium is reached with concentrations of Ni2*, Fe?t, and Mo3t in

the salt that are much less than 1 ppm and a chromium concentration less
than one hundred ppm. The predominant corrosion reaction then is reac-
tion of UF, with chromium in the metal to form CrF, which dissolves in
the salt. Chromium becomes depleted near the surface and after the first
few thousand hours corrosion is limited by the rate of diffusion of chro-
mium to the surface. At MSBR temperatures this limit is on the order of
0.1 mil/year of chromium depletion.

Introduction of moisture and air into the fuel system produces HF
and metal oxides, which dissolve in the salt and make it more oxidizing
and more corrosive to all constituents of Hastelloy N. During normal
operation the contaminants can be kept low by controlling the composition

of the cover gas. Maintenance operations will almost inevitably introduce

some moisture, but with reasonable precautions to minimize air inleakage,
corrosion from this cause will have negligible effect on containment.
(Corrosion in the MSRE fuel system which was opened two or three times

a year, averaged only 0.1 mil/vear [5, pp. 71-791.)

A phenomenon that presumably would affect Hastelloy N in the fuel
system of the reference MSBR is the intergranular attack and cracking
observed on surfaces exposed to the MSRE fuel salt. As discussed at
length in Chapter 7, the cause appears to be fission-product tellurium,
but the existing information does not permit a reliable prediction of
behavior over many years and numerous stress cycles. Some indication of
the seriousness is the observed effect on the MSRE heat exchanger tubes
after 24,500 hours at high temperature following the beginning of power
operation (and fission-product deposition). Surfaces exposed to fuel
had cracks at almost every grain boundary, to an average depth of 5 mils
after being strained. If the depth of the intergranular attack con=-
tinued to increase with the one-fourth power of time at temperature (as
theory suggests is reasonable), the average crack depth after 30 years
(2.6 x 10° hours) would be only 9 mils. This depth of cracking in the
reference MSBR would have only insignificant effect on the strength of
the reactor vessel and piping. On the other hand, if the sttack proceeds

much more rapidly, as is conceivable, it could seriously affect the relia-

bility of the fuel containment.®* It is clear that safety considerations
require that these questions be favorably and conclusively resolved.
Possibilities are discussed later in this chapter.

Coolant Salt Interactions. - The eutectic of NaBF, —- NaF (92-8 mole %)

 

was chosen as the secondary salt in the reference MSBR because it has

reasonably good coolant properties, it is relatively inexpensive, and its
melting point (725°F) is low compared to that of other suitable fluoride
mixtures. From the safety standpoint it is important that mixing of fuel

401

and ceelant salt, spillage of ccolant salt inte the containment cells, and
leakage of steam into coolant salt should not give rise to situations that
would endanger the health and safety of the public or of the operators eof

the plant.

The only credible event that would produce mixing of fuel and coolant
salts is a leak in a primary heat exchanger. The largest likely leak is
believed to result from the rupture of one tube in one of the heat ex-
changers. Depending on the location of the rupture, coolant salt would
enter the fuel salt in the primary system at an initial rate in the range
of 0 to 3.5 lb/sec and fuel salt would enter the coolant salt at a rate
in the range of 1.0 to 7.4 1b/sec. That the leszk existed would be sig-
naled by rapid loss in reactivity of the reactor or fission product radio-
activity in a secondary circuit or both. Upon either of these signals
the reactor would be shut down rapidly, the fuel salt would be drained
from the primary system into the fuel salt drain tank, and the coolant
salt in the affected secondary circuit would be drained into a coolant
salt drain tank.

The amount of mixing of fuel and coolant salts would vary widely,
depending on the design of the plant and the course of the event. We
estimate that as much as 450 ft3 of coolant salt could mix with 1700
ft3 of fuel salt in the primary system and 40 ft3 of fuel salt could
mix with 23100 ft3 of coolant salt in a secondary circuit of the reference
MSBR. No chemical reactions that would generate excessive heat or pre-
cipitate constituents of either salt would be expected to occur on mixing.
Fuel salt and sodium fluoroborate are immiscible, however, so two salt
phases would be present in both systems. Although the salts are immiscible,
exchange occurs between the phases with lithium and beryllium fluorides
entering the lighter fluoroborate phase and sodium fluoride and boron
trifluoride moving into the fuel salt phase. Uranium and thorium fluorides
remain in the heavy phase.

In the primary system the exchange of constituents between salts
would have no significant effect on the melting point of the fuel salt.
The melting point of the coolant salt dispersed in the fuel would in-
crease somewhat, some BF3 would be released, and the BF3 overpressure
in the primary system would be expected to rise to about 5 atm. In the
secondary system the interaction between the fuel and coolant salts would
tend to raise the liquidus temperature of the fuel-containing salt but
would not significantly affect the coolant salt. Since much of the
secondary system normally operates at a temperature below the liquidus
of the fuel salt, the fuel salt that leaked inte the secondary system
would initially be dispersed as frozen particles throughout much of one
circuit. Whether the particles remained as solids would depend on measures
taken to heat or cool the secondary circuit after the coolant salt had
been drained.

None of the conditions associated with mixing of fuel and coolant
salts in the primary or secondary systems appear tc be capable of pro-
ducing a break in either system. The secondary circuits must be heavily
shielded against the radicactivity present in the coolant salt during
normal operation. This shielding can be made adequate to protect against
the fission products that would be introduced by the fuel salt. Repair-
ing or replacing the faulty heat exchanger, reclaiming the fuel salt,
402

and disposing of the contaminated ccolant salt promise to be unpleasant
operations. The chemical toxicity of the boron trifluoride precludes
its indiscriminate release from the plant, but the presence of sodium
fluoroborate does not otherwise affect the safety of those operations.

Sodium fluoroborate, if spilled into the reactor cell or inte a
secondary cell, must be contained. The salt contains radioactive sodium
in a concentration of 0.6 Ci/ft3 and some tritium, and the sodium fluo-
ride and boron trifluoride are both toxic chemicals. The containment
creates no special problems, however, because the cells operate at
temperatures below 1100°F at which temperature the BF; pressure over
the salt is only about 0.3 atm.

Water and steam react with sodium fluorcborate to produce primarily
hydrogen fluoride and sodium hydroxyfluorchborate. The reactions are
not destructively exothermic, but the hydrogen fluoride is corrosive to
the metals of the reactor secondary system and the tubes that separate
the fuel salt from the coolant salt. Although the corrosion rates are
not catastrophic under any foreseeable circumstance, the leakage rate of
water from the steam system into the secondary system and the hydrogen
fluoride concentration in the secondary salt must be kept low in order
to maintain a low corrosion rate of piping and equipment.

In the event of a rupture of one or more tubes in a steam generator
or superheater, the rapid pressurization of the secondary system and the
possibility of transmitting that pressure to the primary system is the
major concern. Isolation valves must be provided to stop the flow of
feedwater and steam to the faulty steam generating equipment and pressure
relief devices must be provided on the secondary system to keep the
pressure below the system design pressure. The steam and salt that are
discharged through these devices must be contained. The affected secon-
dary system must be purged of hydrogen fluoride and moisture and the con-
taminated salt must be purified or replaced while repairs are made on the
steam generator before operation of the plant can be resumed.

The use of a chemically reactive coolant in the secondary system of
the MSBR introduces some problems in designing the plant for upset con-
ditions. The interactions of the coolant with the materials, with fluids
in contiguous reactor systems, and with the cell atmospheres, however, do
not appear to be so vigorous or the reaction products so aggressive as
to create major safety concerns.

Engineered Safety Features

 

The basic function of the engineered safety features in a molten-
salt reactor plant is the same as in any nuclear plant — to prevent any
uncontrolled release of radioactivity under accident conditions. The
detailed requirements are unusual, however, because of the nature of the
fuel — liquid, but practically nonvolatile and not highly reactive with
air or water.

Previous discussion has indicated that abnormal conditions within
the primary system of a molten-salt reactor — nuclear excursions and
uncontrolled fission product heating — do not pose major threats to its
integrity. Of the conditions considered, only the prevention of pressure

 
 

 

 

403

excursions that could be initiated by large leaks between the steam and
secondary salt systems require the implementation of specialized safety
devices to protect the primary system boundary. These devices must insure
that the secondary salt system is reliably and effectively vented in the
event of a steam generator failure.

Despite the low probability of a breach of the primary system
boundary, the consequences of such a failure must be considered. Because
the fuel is in liquid form, any primary-system rupture releases large
quantities of radioactive material into the immediate surroundings. To
prevent the dispersion of that activity throughout the reactor building,
the components of the fuel system are enclosed within a primary contain-
ment system of sealed cells from which water is excluded. The systematic
exclusion of water guards against the generation of large volumes of
steam from the sensible heat of the fuel salt and thus limits the
increases in primary containment pressure to small values even for major
salt spills. A secondary containment system that encloses the equip-
ment cells provides additional protection against the release of radio-
activity to the environment.

The most unusual of the engineered safety features in the MSBR is
the provision for dealing with afterheat under accident conditions — the
heat source is led to the cooling instead of vice versa (as in the ECCS
for a light-water-cooled reactor}. As described elsewhere, the bulk of
the fission products stay in the fuel salt, making shutdown cooling for
the fuel salt essential for prevention of excessive temperatures. The
ultimate cooling system is in the drain tank, so the reactor and contain-
ment are designed so that the fuel will get to that tank under any cred-
ible accident conditions. The heat removal system is simple, rugged,
always operating (being used to remove heat from off-gas sources), and
can continue to operate without electric power and unattended to cool
the fuel as long as necessary in the design basis accident.

In connection with the afterheat removal, it is worth noting that
problems associated with it are much less intense in an MSBR because the
major source is inseparably associated with a very large mass of salt.
(The ratio of heat source at shutdown to heat capacity in the MSBR fuel
salt is only about one-tenth of the ratio in the dry core of an LWR.)
Because the heat source is so dilute, the "China syndrome" does not
appear to be a serious problem in an MSBR.

Siting Considerations

Because an MSBR plant is different in so many ways from present-day
power reactors, the question of siting requires penetrating analysis.

We shall begin by making some comparisons to elucidate differences that
are pertinent to siting considerations.

An immediately obvious difference between MSBR power plants and
cthers is that the former includes both a reactor and a chemical-
processing facility. Current federal regulations on radioactivity
discharges are different for reactors and for fuel reprocessing facili-
ties. Perhaps by the time an MSBER is built, they will be the same, or
404

regulations may have been developed for "power parks" that include reac-
tors and a reprocessing plant. For now, the only question that can be
well defined is whether or not an MSBR plant, similar to the reference
design, can meet the guidelines and restrictions on siting that now
apply to commercial power reactors. We shall address this question in
the course of the following discussion.

Factors affecting the siting of a reactor include:

transportation requirements during construction,

transportation of fuel, etc., to site during operation,

transportation of fuel and wastes from site during operation,
discharge of materials and heat to the environment during
normal operation,

5. consequences of credible accidents (inventories of fission
products and actinides, fractions likely to be released,
etc.) , and

6. disposal of materials after decommissioning.

ode

We shall consider each of these in tum.

Transportation During Construction. — The largest components of an
MSBR are the reactor vessel (23-feet diameter x 33 feet high, 155T), the
somewhat smaller drain tanks, and the primary heat exchangers (6-ft
diameter x 24 ft long, 53 T). These are similar in size to items in

 

a 1000-MW(e) light-water reactor and pose similar transpertation problems.

Transportation During Operation. - The flow of materials into and
out of a 1000-MW(e) MSBR plant are as shown in Fig. 14.2. (Graphite
shipments are expressed as average rates, equivalent to replacement of
the 176 T of graphite in the core at 4-year intervals.) Plant inputs
pose no problems of transportation. Because of the on-site processing
and decay of high-level wastes, the amount of intensely radioactive
material shipped out of an MSBR plant each year is far less than that
leaving any other reactor station of comparable electric capacity. In-
stead of short-cocled fuel elements, there are separated fission products
that have decayed for years: high-level wastes from processing are accu-
mulated in tanks for 4-5 years, then stored on site for nine more years
before shipment. The volume and radioactivity of these wastes are about
the same as those of high-level waste and cladding hulls that are ulti-
mately shipped from a reprocessing plant serving a 1000 MW(e) LMFBR [6].
Krypton-85 and tritium will be stored and shipped in 1.5-ft3 cylinders
at 1000 psi — seven per year. The reference-design MSBR provides for
accumulation within the reactor building of all the graphite removed
from the reactor over the life of the plant. Thus, it can be packaged
and disposed of on a convenient schedule, possibly as part of the decom-
missioning program.

Effluents.- Practically the only radioactive effluent; either
gaseous or liquid, from an MSBR plant is the tritium that reaches the
steam system. In the reference design, where 790 Ci/day is released in
a 560,000 gal/min stream of cooling water, the effluent concentration
(0.26 x 107° pCi/ml) is a factor of 12 below the current 10 CFR 20 limit
on releases to unrestricted areas [7]. On the other hand, it is a factor
of 52 greater than the AEC's numerical guidelines for effluents from
light-water-cooled reactors [4].

As described later, there appear to be ways of limiting effluent
tritium to about the same as the LWR guidelines. .In this case, tritium
will pose no unusual siting requirements on the MSBR.

Site requirements connected with the discharge of waste heat are the
same for an MSBR as for a modern fossil-fueled plant of equal electrical
output and less demanding than for current power reactors.

Radionuclide Inventory. - As a result of the on-site processing
facility and the attendant storage of separated fission products, the
inventory of radioactive isotopes expected to be present at an MSBR
site is considerably greater than that present in other nuclear power
plants of comparable size. However, most of the fission products will
be present not in the reactor but in isolated, protected waste storage
tanks in the form of relatively stable fluoride salts. The inventory
of radioisotopes in the reactor will be considerably lower than in other
reactor types as a result of the continuous processing of the salt. The
maximum inventories of several radionuclides expected to be present in
the fuel salt and processing plant of a 1000-MW(e) MSBR are listed in
Table 14.3. Inventories found in a PWR and LMFBR of comparable size are
shown for comparison. The MSBR inventories are given just prior to ship-
ment of high level waste to a federal repository while the PWR and LMFBR
inventories are given just prior to refueling.

 

Design~Basis Accident. - In the MSBR, the design-basis accident is
a rupture of one of the main fuel circulating lines that occurs while the
reactor is at full power and quickly spills the entire charge of molten
fuel. The primary containment is designed to prevent any release of
radioactivity into the reactor building or environs ia this event. Con-
sideration of the fuel salt chemistry, the intensity of afterheat sources,
and the dependability of the drain-tank cooling system support the con-
clusion that this objective is attainable. Thus the design-basis acci-
dent should not affect the health and safety of the public.

 

Decommissioning. - Presumably at the end of plant life the radio-
active equipment and materials in the reactor and processing systems
must be removed to some ultimate disposal facility.

There will be 1700 ft3 of highly radioactive fuel salt, 8400 ft3 of
coolant salt, 175 £ft3 of Pa decay salt, 60 £ft3 of bismuth, and 20 ft3
of lithium chloride, all radicactive. There will also be several hundred

£t3 of NaK and about 3000 £t3(STP) of helium, with little or no radio-

activity. The fuel salt, bismuth, and LiCl are sufficiently valuable

that they will likely be recovered for reuse. The NaK would also be C=
salvaged.

Possibly as much as 1200 tons of graphite may be in the reactor
building at the time of decommissioning (the fixed graphite plus 6 re-
placeable core assemblies). This can all be broken down into pieces
that can be conveniently shipped in shielded containers.

There will be many equipment items that are highly contaminated
with fission products. The largest, such as the reactor vessel, the
drain tank, and the primary heat exchangers, must be cut into pieces for
transportation and disposal. This can presumably be done within the con-
tainment already provided within the MSBR building for use during main- ws
tenance. The pieces then should be as manageable as the most radioactive
portions of other kinds of reactors upon decommissioning.

Thus it appears that disposal of an MSBR, while clearly a major
undertaking, will be manageable within the technology needed for main-
tenance of the MSBR and disposal of other types of reactors.

Summary. — On the basis cf the foregoing comparison it appears that
there should be no major differences in the siting requirements for a
fully developed MSBR and for other tvpes of advanced power reactors. GE

Experience and Knowledge

Reactor technology in general and the years of ANP and MSRP work in
particular provide the information needed to answer nearly all of the Ei
questions that are important to molten-salt reactor safety. This section
contains a brief review of the pertinent information that is in hand,
with some discussion of its adequacy. The few important gaps that remain Gi

wa
to be filled are noted in passing. The significance of uncertainties and
the needs for further work are discussed in the next major section of
this chapter. i
i
Containment
The ultimate reliance for protection of the public from an MSBR
accident rests on the containment system that is in effect during opera-
tion. This system does net involve any untried construction techniques i

but it does have a major untried feature. The inner walls of the reactor

cell and the fuel salt drain tank cell must be insulated and the cells

must be heated and operated at temperatures above 1000°F. This feature

is discussed in Chapter 9. As pointed out earlier in this chapter, the a
characteristics of MSBR fluids impose no severe problem with regard to
pressurization or danger of chemical reactions. Therefore, MSBR cells

and buildings can be mostly designed and built with the containment tech- i
nology that has been thoroughly developed for other reactors.

In order to prevent troublesome releases of radioactivity to the
environment during maintenance of contaminated equipment, it will be
necessary to provide devices (such as the core-removal cask mentioned
in Chapter 12) and closed ventilation systems. We have had experience
along these lines but on a scale much smaller than will be involved with
some of the larger reactor components, so larger, more elaborate equip-
ment will have to be developed.

Instrumentation and Control

 

The situation here can be summarized by simply saying that in our
analyses of the consequences of nuclear excursions, we can assume that
safety-rod action will occur when it is needed. This seems reasonable
when one compares the relatively modest requirements of the MSBR for
sensing and action with the capabilities of reliable safety systems
on all kinds of reactors. The same conclusion is reached, after
detailed consideration, in Chapter 10.

Salt Handling

This 1s a more esoteric area, but even here there is much experi-~
ence, both at ORNL and elsewhere.

At ORNL various fluoride salts, all of them toxic and some highly
radioactive, have been handled safely in scores of experiments and in
two molten-salt reactors. The requirements for salt handling around
an MSBR do not pose problems that are different in kind. Some, such
as protecting the salts from atmospheric contamination, are precisely
the same. Others differ in degree. For example: because salt from
an MSBR will be roughly 10 times as radioactive as that from the MSRE,
shielding on sample carriers must be thicker, but otherwise the carriers
can be essentially the same as those used at the MSRE. (The more intense
radioactivity, coupled with the greater sizes of components, places more
stringent requirements on containment during maintenance. This is dis-
cussed in Chapter 12.)

The high melting point of the salts and the volume changes in
freezing and thawing impose requirements that might seem impractical to
live with, were it not that our experiences with the ARE, the MSRE and
many engineering experiments have proved the contrary. With reasonable
care in design and procedures, freezing of MSBR salts should not detract
from plant operability, reliability, and safety.

Uranium Behavior

It is imperative from the standpoint of nuclear safety to be sure
that dangerous amounts of fissile material are not hiding out in the
fuel circulation system of a molten-salt reactor. In general, there
is no assurance that one could detect gradual segregation of uranium
in a reactor operating at high specific power for long periods of time.
410

Unavoidable uncertainties in the breeding ratio alone will be equivalent

to perhaps one percent cf the reactor fissile inventory per year, and

uncertainties in long-term fission product poisoning further obscure reac- wd

tivity evidence of fissile hideout. The reactivity balance should reveal

significant segregation that occurs within a few days, and there might

be other clues that would permit detection of gradual hideout, but the n

most dependable, safest course is to preclude the possibility. This means

(a) using a salt mixture whose behavior is thoroughly known, and (b) oper-

ating the plant so as to steer well clear of any condition that could re-

sult in segregation of uranium {or plutonium). vas
The phase relations in pure LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,-UF; mixtures are

quite accurately known. Conceivable variations of the fluoride ratios

in MSBR fuel from the nominal composition do not approach any region of cis

fuel segregation. Oxide behavior is alsc well known, but here there is

less latitude. Introduction of oxygen into MSBR fuel would result in

precipitation of a uranium-rich mixed oxide (ThO,-U0,) when the oxide

ion concentration reaches somewhere between 30 and 150 ppm (see Fig. 5.4).

The concentration in an operating MSBR must be kept below about 30 ppm,

and there is good reason to believe that it can be. The ingress of oxygen

can be limited, as shown by MSRE experience, to rates and amounts that a

could easily be removed by the MSBR processing system. In any event it

will be necessary to verify that the oxide concentration in the fuel is

safely low by frequent, accurate measurements. Techniques for oxide anal-
yses that are currently avallable are not adequate for the MSBR needs.

 

Fission-Product Behavior

 

The general behavior of fission products in molten-salt systems

has been largely established by a variety of independent studies and wa

by analyses of the MSRE performance, both during and after its operation.
The details of that behavior were described in Chapter 5, but there are
some aspects that are of particular interest with regard to nuclear
safety. As expected, the noble-gas fission products (xenon and krypton)
were readily removed from the circulating fluid and transported to the
off-gas system. Although there was significant transport of these
materials to the unsealed graphite used in the MSRE, a factor

of & reduction in xenon poisoning was achieved with a simple gas-stripping
system. Once removed, these gases could be effectively and predictably
handled in the off-gas treatment facility. Post-shutdown release of Ca
gases previously held up on the graphite may, however, be a radiological

safety consideration in primary system of an MSBR.

In the MSRE, at least some of the noble-gas daughters formed in the »
off-gas system were carried along by the gas stream, and large quantities ©
were accumulated in the particle traps upstream of the charcoal beds.

Since the off-gas had ne further exposure to the fuel salt, no information
was obtained with respect to redissclution in the salt, which could be E
important in the MSBR drain tank.

The fission products that, from thermodynamic considerations, were
expected to remain dissolved in the fuel salt were shown in the MSRE to in
behave as expected. Among the species of particular interest from a

 
 

 

 

411

radiological safety standpoint, both iodine and strontium showed no
tendency to escape from the salt. Some iodine did appear in the gas
in the reactor loop after salt drains, due to decay of precursors that
had been deposited on system surfaces. Again, special steps will be
required during some stages of post-shutdown operations of an MSBR to
prevent the release of iodine formed in this way.

Many of the noble-metal fission products were found on surfaces in
the MSRE. If the apparent sticking coefficient of noble metal atoms to
metal surfaces is taken as 1.0, then data from the MSRE indicate that the
apparent sticking coefficient to graphite was 0.5-1.0 and to gas bubbles
was <0.1. It is not clear whether the sticking coefficient to the bubbles
was low because the metal particles did not remain on the interfaces as
the bubbles circulated in the primary system or because the metal particles,
after being released in the pump bowl by the bubbles, were resuspended
in the liquid and returned to the primary system. This lack of conclusive
data on noble-metal behavior led to the range of distributions projected
for the MSBR. Unless data are cbtained from other sources to permit better
definition of the distribution, the next molten-salt reactor will have to
be designed to deal with a substantial range of noble-metal distributions.
The principal safety consideration with these materials and their daughters
is ensuring that the heat produced by their decay does not adversely affect
the integrity of the primary system components on which they are deposited.
Prevention of their release during maintenance operations, such as cutting
and welding, must also be provided for.

Kinetic Behavior

The kinetic response of the reactor plant to all sizes and varieties
of perturbations must be evaluated to demonstrate safety in the presence
of large perturbations and stability in the presence of smaller, more
frequent disturbances. The preliminary analyses discribed earlier suggest
that all credible reactivity disturbances are readily manageable, but ne
comprehensive safety analysis has yet been carried out for a large MSBR.
Preliminary studies of the frequency response characteristics of the
reference design, using a detailed analytical model indicate that the
reactor system is inherently stable at all power levels and all perturba-
tion frequencies. As discussed in Chapter 4, basic considerations and
the experimental confirmation of the predicted dynamic stability of the
MSRE indicate that the data and the calculational techniques that are
available can be expected to adequately predict the characteristics of
molten-salt reactors.

Further Work

The preceding sections of this chapter have identified the areas of
greatest significance to MSBR safety and environmental effects and have
indicated the technology that already exists in each area. Now we come
to that which remains to be done. Obviously much more detailed studies
412

must be made and appropriate criterias must be developed by which MSBR
safety can be measured before molten-salt reactors are accorded the
degree of confidence now enjoyed by light-water-cooled reactors.

More information is required on the behavior of fuel salt boiling
in contact with graphite at temperatures to 3000°F. Theoretical con-
siderations and the few data that have been obtained indicate that
there will be no significant interaction but this must be confirmed
in tests of longer duration. Considerable information is available
on the volatility of fission products in fuel salt at high temperature
but additional data are needed that are more directly related to the
conditions of a design basis accident. At high temperature, most of
the iodine released by the decay of tellurium deposits on surfaces
and would be expected to react rapidly with the metals in the reactor
system and be retained there. Experience with the MSRE gives no clues
concerning the distribution of the iodine between the metal and a gas
over the metal. Data are needed for a variety of conditions s¢ that
a good analysis can be made of the behavior to be expected of this
iodine under accident conditions and during maintenance of the reactor.

An area in which modifications in the reference design are certainly
needed and essential information is lacking is tritium containment.

The remainder of this section is therefore devoted to this topic.

The amount of tritium that could reach the steam system of the
reference-design MSBR has been estimated to be about 1/3 of the
2420 Ci/day production rate in the fuel. Modification of the steam
system and its operation to retain that amount of tritium would be
impractical. So would be attempts to separate the tritium from the
normal hydrogen in the steam. Clearly means must be provided to limit
the tritium that reaches the steam to an amount that can be discharged
safely to the plant environs with the cooling water from the turbine
condenser. At least 10 Ci/day of tritium could be released to a river
(or to the atmosphere) in the condenser cooling water from a 1000-MW(e)
plant and still be within the guidelines of the proposed Appendix I to
10 CFR Part 50 "as low as practicable" criterion for light water reac-
tors. A tentative design cbjective for the MSBR is to limit the tritium
release to about 2 Ci/day .or 0.1% of the production. (This is the rate
shown in Fig. 14.2.)

Several modifications in the design or operation of the reference
plant, separately or in combination, have the potential for drastically
reducing the amount of tritium that escapes inte the steam system and
in some instances into the reactor and coolant-system cells. These
modifications involve adding hydrogen to the fuel salt, reducing the
permeability of the metal walls, substituting side-stream contacting
of salt and gas for injection of gas bubbles into the primary and secon-
dary systems, exchanging tritium for hydrogen in hydrogenous compounds
or reacting it with oxide in the coolant salt, and using other fluids
to couple the primary system to the steam generators. Several possibili-
ties are discussed in the following paragraphs.

We have inferred from some of the calculations that the effective
permeability of the metal in contact with air in the MSRE might have
been only 1/1000 of the permeability of unoxidized metal. Oxide films
on metal surfaces have been found at ORNL and by other investigators
 

413

to reduce the hydrogen permeability of the metals by a factor of 10 to
1000. An oxide film would be expected to form in steam on some metals
that could be used for the tubes in the steam generators and superheaters.
Even a 1000-fold reduction in permeability of the steam generator tubes
would not be sufficient by itself to reduce the tritium reaching the
steam system te 10 Ci/day or less in an MSBR. If, however, hydrogen were
added to the fuel salt at a rate 10" or 10° times the rate of production
of tritium, then the corresponding calculated flows of tritium into the
steam system are 5 Ci/day and <2 Ci/day (the limit of precision of the
calculation), respectively.

The rate of removal of tritium from the fuel and coolant salts can
be increased by contacting side streams of the salts with large flows of
purge gas in packed columns, spray towers, or other types cf contactors.
With side-stream contacting of 10,000 gal/min each of fuel salt (15% of
the flow in the primary system} and coolant salt, addition of hydrogen
is effective with a 100-fold reduction in the permegbility of the metal.
Tungsten is compatible with fluoride salts, and a 100-fold reduction in
permeability could be obtained with a sound 0.l-mm coating on the interior
surfaces of the primary and secondary systems. Coating the entire reac~-
tor systems might be impractical, but the amount of tritium reaching the
steam system could be reduced to <2 Ci/day for Hp/To, = 10° by coating
only the tubes in the primary heat exchangers and in the steam generators.
The oxide film on the steam side might suffice as the ccating on the
steam generator tubes.

Tritium exists as the element and as tritium fluoride in the fuel
salt. The fraction present as the fluoride increases rapidly as the salt
is made more oxidizing by decreasing the concentration ratio UF3/UF,.
Side-stream contacting makes possible the use of larger flows of purge
gas than dees the bubble-injection system and the stripping of tritium
fluoride to lower concentrations in the primary salt. If UF3/UF, in the
fuel salt is reduced from 0.0% to 0.001, practically all the tritium can
be discharged into the primary-system off-gas as tritium fluoride. The
feasibility of removing tritium as the fluoride depends on the rate of
reaction of tritium fluoride with the metal surfaces being low at the
low concentrations of tritium fluoride in the salt.

No other manipulations in the primary system seem likely to have
much effect on the tritium distribution, but the secondary system offers
several additional possibilities. The sodium fluoroborate coolant salt
proposed for use in the secondary system seems to contain large amounts
of oxide and small amounts of a hydroxyl compound without being exces-
sively corrosive. Experiments indicate that deuterium, on entering the
fluoroborate, reacts with the oxide in the compound and is retained by
the salt. Tritium would be expected to behave similarly. In the reac-
tor the salt would be processed as necessary to remove the tritium.

Some calculations indicate that a reduction of 10 to 100 in the permea-
bility of the steam generator tubes might be necessary to make this
process economical.

Sorption of tritium by the graphite in the reactor core is helpful
but not sufficient to prevent the release of excessive amounts to the
steam system. However, sorption of tritium on carbon offers promise for
removing tritium from the secondary system.
414

With more drastic changes in plant design, helium containing small
amounts of oxygen and water vapor could be used as the coolant in the
secondary system. Tritium, on diffusing into the helium, would be oxi-
dized to water and prevented from passing into the steam. Objection to
the use of helium in the secondary system is found in the high pressure,
the larger primary heat-exchanger surface, and the larger fuel-salt
inventory that would be required. These objections might be circum-
vented by employing the helium in the annuli of dual-wall tubes in the
steam generators at the expense of larger and more complicated steam
generators.

Use of the nitrate-nitrite salt mixture, generally known as HIS or
Hitec, in the secondary system would also keep tritium out of the steam.
Tritium entering this salt would be oxidized to water, and the water
would be vaporized into the purge gas at high temperature. Thermal
instability above 1100°F and reactions with graphite if it were to
leak into the primary system are objectionable features of this salt,
These difficulties could be circumvented by use of the salt in a circu-
lating system between the rveactor secondary system and the steam genera-
tors.

In view of all the possibilities, it seems certain that the escape
of tritium into the steam can be limited to acceptable amounts. The
tritium problem is not completely solved, however, until methods are
specified for confining the tritium that is removed from the reactor
systems and the cell atmosphere and this has not yet received much atten-
tion. Most of the tritium is likely to be extracted as water or tritium
fluoride. The water could be stored in tanks and the tritium fluoride
could be sorbed on sodium fluoride beds, or those compounds might be
decomposed and the tritium converted to a solid hydride for storage. In
any event, excessive dilution by hydrogen must be prevented. A production
rate of 2420 Ci/day is equivalent to a trivial (.8 ml/day of T,0. The
volume of water resulting from a dilution of 10% with hydrogen would be
of little consequence, but, if the dilution were 10°, 8000 m3 of tritiated
water would be produced during the life of the plant. Safe storage for
such a large volume would be expensive, ané means probably would have
to be provided for concentrating the tritium,

Although there is experience with tritium in the MSRE, analysis of
its behavior in large molten-salt reactors requires more detailed informa-
tion. Some extrapolations of data from the literature can be made, and a
program is in progress to cbtain confirmatory data. The program includes
measurements of (1) the solubility of hydrogen in salts; (2) the perme-
ability of metals and oxide cecatings at low partial pressures of hydrogen;
(3) the capacities of graphite and of potential coolants to retain hydrogen
and tritium under simulated reactor conditions; and (4) reaction rates
of hydrogen fluoride in low concentrations in salts with metals. Inves-
tigation of methods for separating tritium compounds from process streams
and from cell atmospheres and for storing the tritium safely and economi-
cally while it decays will be included later.

Evaluation

Waste heat from a high-temperature MSBR power plant is as low as
from the most modern steam plants. The plant can be designed so that
there is practically no radioactivity other than tritium in the plant
effluents. No shipments of short-cooled fuel leave the plant; instead,
fission products are shipped as concentrated high-level waste after
several years’ decay, while other wastes (such as core graphite and
charcoal) are accumulated on-site to be disposed of at any convenient
time.

Tritium is a special problem because of its high rate of production
in the fuel salt and because it readily diffuses through metals at MSBR
temperatures. In the reference MSBR, with no special measures for block-
ing tritium diffusion, about 79C Ci/day (33% of production) would reach
the steam system. Several modifications in design and cperation have
the potential for drastically reducing tritium escape by this route.

The objective of limiting tritium release to within present AEC guide-
lines for light-water-cooled reactors appears attainable, but the best
measures are vet to be chosen and demonstrated.

The situation with regard to nuclear safety ané afterheat is unique.
The very limited excess reactivity and potential for reactivity increases
in an MSBR, coupled with favorable dynamic characteristics, make damaging
nuclear excursions highly unlikely. Afterheat problems are not intense
because the bulk of the fission products are incorporated in a large mass
of fuel salt. Furthermore, this heat source can be gotten into a reliably
cooled situation {the drain tank) under any accident condition. Radio-
nuclide heat sources in the processing plant, in the reactor off-gas
system, and deposited on surfaces in the fuel system require cooling,
but simple, reliable measures appear to suffice.

Although a breach of the fuel system is highly unlikely, the design-
basis accident is taken to be a major rupture of a fuel line that quickly
spills the entire fuel inventory. Containment of the radioactivity in
this event is the chief safety consideration in an MSBR. This task is
simplified because the actinides and the bulk of the fission products stay
in the salt, the salt has an extremely low vapor pressure, and it is not
highly reactive with moisture or air.

It appears from basic considerations that site requirements for an
MSBR plant should eventually be no different from those for other reac-
tors of like power. Because of the unusual nature of an MSBR, however,
it will be necessary to begin with fundamental principles and develop
criteria appropriate to this kind of reactor, then to perform a safety
analysis comparable in depth to those for reactors now going into
operation.
