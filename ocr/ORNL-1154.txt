SUMMARY

This quarterly progress report
of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion
Program at the Oak Ridge National

Laboratory is divided inte five parts:
Reactor Design, Shielding Research,
Materials Research, Alternative
Systems, and Appendixes, each of which
1s discussed separately in this summary.

Part I. ®EACTOR DESIGN

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment
{8ec. 1). The design of the high-
temperature Aircraft Reactor Experi-
ment has been modified to use the 30-
in. core instead of the 36-in. core,
as proposed in the last report. All
reactor components are on order with
delivery expected this coming quarter.
Design of the external fluid circuit
is essentially complete, and many of
the major components are on order.
Construction of the building facility
is on schedule.

Experimental Reactor Engineering
{Sex. 2). Becent developments have
incloded a frozen-sodium seal for a
centrifugal pump, satisfactory oper-
ation of an electromagnetic pump and
of a canned-rotor pump with sodium,
operation of a liquid-metal valve at
1500°F without self-welding, and oper-
ation of a mock-up of the reactor
liguid-fuel system. Techniques have
been developed further for the handling
and purification of sodium and sodium
systems to minimize oxygen contiami-
nation; this has contributed appreci-
ably to the successful operation of
these systems at high temperatures.

Reactor Physics (Sec. 3). The
reactor physics calculations have been
devoted largely to statics and kinetics

 

 

of the ARE, although some analysis of
a sodium hydroxide reactor and a full
aircraft-size BeO reactor were com-
pleted. The uranium investment in the
ARE is 29.2 1b, the slight increase
over previous estimates being due
largely to increased structural and
material poisons in the completed
design. As the change in reactivity
for normal control is relatively
insensitive to the location of the six
cuter control rods, they have been
located to maintain the most uniform
flux distribution. Calculated kinetic
responses of the ARE to arbitrary
changes in reactivity, as a result of
possible accidents or failures, show
the system to be well damped. Pre-
liminary calculations of a sodium
hydroxide reactor designed at ORNL
have yielded data on leakage and
absorption spectra of the core and
indicate a critical mass of approxi-

mately 32 1b.

Critical Experiments (See. 4). The
preliminary reactor assemblies which
are being, or have been, investigated
include simulations of the air-water
aircraft reactor, proposed by General
Electric, and a graphite-uranium
assembly to study power and flux
distributions. Measurements of this
latter reactor were still being made
at the end of the quarter. The two
modi fications of the air-water reactor
demonstrated the savings in critical
mass to be gained by decreasing the
thickness of the water lavers,

ARE has also been made.

with hydroxides and with hydroxide-

specially pure sodium hydroxide are
extremely corrosive te inconel and to
the stainless steels. Corrosion by
potassium hydroxide is somewhat less
severe. Llests with bariumand strontium
hydroxides indicate these caustics to

of the alkali hydroxides, but still se

are not sufficiently well known to

Radiation Damage (Sec. 14). Although
a2 number of fuel capsules have been
irradiated im both the pile and
cyclotron, complete data are not yet
available owing to the residual activivy
of the capsule. From preliminary
results 1t appears unlikely that
radiation will have a significant
effect on the fuel. On the other
hand, the thermal conductivity of
inconel appears to decreases by a factor
of 2 iu less than a week of exposure
in the X-10 pile. The flux devendence
of this decrease has not been de-
termined, but a temperature anneal of
the effect has been demonstrated.

Part IV. ALTEBNATIVE SYSTEMS

The major effort of the Aircraft
Nuclear Propulsion Project at Oak
Ridge Naticnal laboratory is directed
toward a 1500°F liquid-fusl reactor.
However, research is in progress both
here and at associated laboratories on
several other reactor systems which

show promise. Among these alternative

systems receiving consideration are
the supercritical water reactor and
two configurations for a circulating-
moderator reactor.

Supercritical Water Reactor (Sec.
15). The design of a supercritical
water reactor 1s being analyzed by
Nuclear Development Associates, Inc.
Their present concept of the reactor
and shield is a 2.5-ft square-cylinder
active core surrounded by an 11-ft-
diameter sphere of water. The water
makes two passes through the core
which contains fuel elements of the
sandwich design previously proposed.

Circuylating-#oderator-Coolant
Reactor: HEF (Sec. 18). A circulating-
moderator-coolant reactor ewploying
circulating sodium hydroxide as both
moderator and coolant and a fixed
liquid fuel of a mixture of fluorides
has been proposed by The H. K. Ferguson
Co. The reactor is designed to deliver
140 megawatts at the design point of
0.8 Mach and 35,000 ft in a modified
B-52 airplane, with a maximum power at
level of 230 megawatts. The
uranium investment in this reactor is
high, 187 lb. This is directly at-
tributable to the poor heat-transfer
characteristics of sodium hydroxide,
which necessitates a large amount of
inconel for heat-transfer surface.

Circulating~¥oderater-Coolant
Reactor: ORNL (Sec. 17). A design
of a circulating-moderator-coolant
reactor has also been advanced by the
Reactor Design Group at Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. The working fluid

of this moderator-coolant reactor is
likewise specified as sodium hydroxide.
A 2.5-ft spherical core using liquid
fluoride fuel is expected to deliver
200 megawatts with a maximom wall
temperature of 1500°F. An essential
feature of this design is the ase of
annular fuel elements to attain the
high ratio of heat-transfer surface to
fuel volume necessary with the hy-
droxide coolant.

High-Temperature Power-Plant Studies
(Sec. 18). North American Aviation,
Inc., has conducted an investigation
of high-temperature {above 1800°F)
helium and sodium liguid-vapor power
cycles with regard to their application
to a Mach 1.5, 45,000-ft-altitude
aircraft. They conclude that a helium-
cooled reactor cannot achieve the
supersonic propulsion of aircraft
even 1f reactor temperatures as high
as 3300°F and helium pressures in the
range 1000 to 2000 psi should be used.
On the other hand, a liquid-metal-
cooled reactor operating in conjunction
with a sodium liquid-vapor compressor
jet system does appear feasible for
the supersonic aircraft.

Part V. APPENDIXES
Analytical Chemistry (Sec. 18).
Chemical analysis is required in
almost every phase of the reactor
program. Although some of these
analyses are routine, the development
of many new analytical techniques is
required. In all, over 400 samples
were submitted for analysis during
the last quarter and over 1700 determi-
nations were made. The n-butyl bromide
me thod, which has beer developed for
the determination of oxygen in sodium,
1s extremely accurate for oxygen
contaminations down to 0.015%. The
oxygen content of argon and helium 1s
now determined by 'a colorimetric
method which gives excellent precision
below 25 ppm. Methods are also being
developed for the determination of
metallic corrosion products in fluoride
fuels and metallic coolants and for

the determination of oxygen in lithium
and lead.

List of Reports Issued (Sec. 20).

ANP Division

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment
(ARE) is a 3-megawatt reactor designed
to provide first-hand experience with
a high-temperature (1500°F) reactor.
Recent modifications of the ARE design
have been permitted for convenience
where this has not affected the operat-
itg temperature of the core. In
particular, the smaller core, proposed
in the last report, ¢!) has been adopted
and consideration is being given to
the use of NaK since this coolant would
eliminate the need of preheaters.

The external-fluid, electrical, and
control circuits have been generally
established and detailing is now in
process. The design of the fluid
circuit is sufficiently well defined
to permit ordering of heat exchangers,
blowers, and associated tubing. The
reactor control signal will now be
obtained from both inlet and outlet
coolant temperature. The reactor will
contain six control rods symmetrically
dispersed around a central safety rod.

Construction of the building facility
for the ABE is proceeding as scheduled.
The excavation is complete and most of
the concrete foundation has been laid.

CORE DESIGN

The core arrangement has been re-
designed to provide for an active
lattice (30 in. in diameter and 34 in.
in length, as suggested by the Reactor
Physics Group.(!) (The smaller core
and thick reflector favor critical
mass and power distribution.) The
original core-tube and fuel-tube sizes
have been retained, providing a maximum
fuel capacity of 31 1b of U?%%, using
fused fluorides (NaF-KF-UF,) containing
150 1b of U?*35 per cubic foot. The
current core—pressure shell assembly
provides for seven control thimbles,
located in the core, and two instrument

chambers, located in the reflector.

Material and component orders have
been revised to include the changes
and features referred to above. Detail
and assembly drawings for the entare
core~—pressure shell assembly are
being prepared. The orders for core
components which were placed during
the preceding quarter(?) are still
outstanding. Delivery of most items
is expected within the next twomonths.
After extensive negotiations with the
Norton Company, the Brush Company,
AFC, and Norris, it has been decided
that all moderator and reflector
beryllium oxide blocks will be hot-
pressed by Norton and that the original
block size (3.75 flats)

will be retained. Initial shipments

of BeO have been made.

FLUID CIRCUIT

Detailed layouts of all aspects of
the external fluid circuit are currently
being made. The availability of the
various components from either at-hand
stock or commercial suppliers is being
determined, and in some cases the
procurement of these items has been
initiated. The use of NaK as the
reactor coolant will eliminate the
need of preheaters in the coolant
system. The helium monitoring circuit,
the reactor room and pump-room space
cooling circuits, and the control-rod
cooling circuits are being reanalyzed
in an attempt to obtain dual usage of
some of the components.

Heat-Disposal Circuit. The heat-
disposal systems provide for heat
transfer from NaK to helium to ethylene
glycol to water. The NaK-to-helium
heat exchangers and the helium-to-
glycol heat exchangers have been
studied in detail, and the configu-
rations which appeared to be most
attractive have been reviewed with two
prospective suppliers, the Griscom-
Russell Company and the Vulcan Copper
and Supply Company. Each of these
companies confirmed our basic approach
and have submitted formal quotations
for the heat exchangers. As each of
the prospective suppliers has agreed
to quote on the basis of 1-in. inconel
tubing in the NaK heat exchanger, the
tubing has been requisitioned to favor
the optimum delivery date. The afore-
mentioned companies also confirmed the
calculated helium flow rates and
pressure drops, enabling the release
of requisitions for the helium blowers.
Invitations to bid have been extended
to six blower manufacturers; the bids

10

have been received and currently are
being evaluated. The glycol-to-water
heat exchangers have been found inY-12
surplus, and their custody has been
transferred to the ABE project.

It has been decided to revise the
NaK system to provide for upward flow
from reactor to an expansion tank,
then down from the expansion tank to
the heat exchangers and down from the
heat exchangersto the low point immedi-
ately above the dump tank, and from
there to the pump and the reactor.
This revision places the pump on the
low-temperature side of the heat ex-
changer and obviates the need for
employing the pump as a surge chamber.
It is planned to maintain pump level
control by means of a forced helium
flow through an orifice, the area of
which 1s adjusted by the NaK level.
It has also been decided to employ a
mechanical valve in the dump tank line
rather than to maintain the liquid
level by gas pressure as previously
contemplated.

Contamination of Helium System.
Failure of a fuel element is expected
to release xenon and krypton to the
NaK circuit and in turn to the helium
present at the various NaK free sur-
faces. Studies have indicated that
the helium so contaminated must be
held for several days before being
released to the stack. After several
possible scrubbing arrangements had
been investigated, it was decided to
make this helium circuit a closed
loop with a valved line to the stack,
permitting release after any desired
waiting time. This system will in-
clude a low-pressure reservolr, a
scrubber, a small compressor, a monitor,
and a high-pressure reservoir.

first step toward the solution of the
computor problem has been completed.
A satisfactory multiplier for taking
the product of two analogue voltages
has been constructed. Work will
continue on the computor design at the
present level of endeavor.

ELECTRICAL CIRCUIT

Finalization of some of the major
fluid-circuit features has permitted
an estimate of electric-power require-
ments. Detailed
conditions following the failure of
external power has indicated that the
heat capacity of the system is very

large compared to the post-scram heat
gencration. Accordingly, it 1s un-
necessary to provide for continued
operation of the main heat-disposal
circuit. It is planned to provide for
operation of the NaK pumps, the
monitoring and control rod coolant
blowers, and the space cooling systems,

following failure of outside power.

On this basis it appears that the
maximum battery power requirement will
be less than 10 kw. The a-c¢~d-c motor
generator set appears to be governed
by the design point condition, which
requires approximately 50 kw d-c power.
Warm-up of the entire system {rom room
temperature to 1500°F, within 24 hr,
appears to require 100 kw a-c and
10 kw d-¢. Circuit diagrams are being
prepared on this basis.

REMOTE-HANDLING EQUIPHENT

Conferences have been held with the
Timken Bearing Company regarding bear-
ing selection and other design features
of the remote cutting machinery. On
the basis of these discussions final
layouts are being made, and requisi-
tions have been released for the larger
procured components. Experiments are
in progress involving welding, cutting,
rescarfing, and rewelding a 2-in.-
thick stainless steel plate. These
tests will be repeated with a 2-1in.-

developing and/or testing materials,
methods, and components applicable to
the ARE and ANP reactors. Presently
under development are pumps, valves,
flowmeters,
cators,

level and pressure indi-
preheaters, seals, heat
etc., and, in addition,
studies are being made on static and

and operational techniques for test
equipment. Information derived from
this program provides fundamental
engineering data for component design

and provides a basis for establishing
adequate operational procedures to
demonstrate the reliability of both
laboratory and full-scale systems.

Work has continued on liguid-fuel
systems with the result that a non-
enriched sample of fluoride fuel
mixture has been filtered and trans-
ferred from one fuel container to
another for the first time. A frozen-
sodium seal had been in operation for
700 hr at the end of the period, seal-
ing against 26 psi 1n a system which
contained sodium at 1500°F. A pump
incorporating this frozen-sodium seal
had also been put into operation
successfully. In other tests, a
graphite gas seal showed promise.

inside individual pins and inserted in
the reactor. A second rzactor core
may contain the fused fluoride fuel in
a fuel system consisting of perhaps
ninety fuel tube clusters in which tube
clusters would be filled and emptied
by means of differential gas pressure.
Full-scale mock-ups of portions of the
system are being made to reveal in-

for working with mock-up No. 2.

Mock-up No. 2 was a carefully con-
structed all-glass full-size fuel
system employing tetrachloroethylene
{sp. gr. 1.6} to simulate the liquid
fuel. Work with this system revealed
data on bubble formation, filling and
emptying rates, flushing methods, etc.,
all of which were applicable to mock-
up No. 3.

Mock-up No. 3, which has been
assembled, is an all-metal system
structed from 316 stainless steel
3/16-in.-0.d. tubing and is capable
of operating at temperatures up to
1500°F. In a preliminary test using
tubing of this size the fuel mixture
of fluorides has been successfully
filtered. and transferred through the
tubing in the molten state.

In conjunction with uranium fuel

to investigate the containing of
helium in equipment fabricated from
316 stainless steel and inconel of
0.030 in. wall thickness at tempera-
tures of 1500°F or greater. These
experiments were conducted on weld-
free type 316 stainless steel and
inconel tubing at 1600°F under 54 psi
helium pressure differential and using
a Westinghouse mass spectrograph
helium leak detector for detecting
helium. Tt was found that no helium
diffused interstitially through the
tubing walls during 150 hr, the length
of the test.

 

PUMP DEVELOPMENT

Pumps currently under development
for the ARF and experimental loops
include a variety of electromagnetic
and centrifugal pumps as well as the
unique canned-rotor pump and Mlevel-
tank™ pump. Performance curves of two
electromagnetic pumps have been obtained
up to 1000°F. At this temperature a
high contact resistance created an
open circuit. The centrifugal pumps
currently wnder development are
distinguished by the type of shaft
seal. The centrifugal pump discussed
below embodied a gas seal; other
promising pump seals are discussed
under "Seal Tests.” The canned rotor
pump has operated for 90 hr with Nak
at temperatures up to 400°F with no
discernable wear. Among the pump
developments are a Duriron pump which
operates immersed in the to-be-pumped
fluid and the two-stage electro-
magnetic pump. Other pump information
1s mentioned under "Loop Tests’ and
"Seal Tests."

A loop for testing either electro-
magnetic or mechanical pumps of ARE
size has been designed which contains
approximately 40 ft of 2%-in. pipe and
utilizes 7.5-kw tube furnaces for
heating the circulating medium up to

1500°F. The loop volume, including a
3-ftd sump tank, is approximately
5 ft®. Space is provided for electro-

Canned-Rotor Pump (A. R. Frithsen
and M. Richardson, Beactor Experimental
Engineering Division). The 1%-hp
fluid-bearing pump (Fig. 2.1), de-
scribed in the last report, (?) has
been operated with water and Nak
without detectable wear. The first
test was made in a water-circulating
system and continued intermittently
for a total of 1200 hr running time.
Examination of the pump parts after
dissassembly showed no visible or
measurable wear or corrosion. All
clearances were the same as before the
test was begun.

In a subsequent test the diametrical
clearance between the motor rotors and
motor cans was reduced from 0.017 to
0.012 in. and the pump was then used
to circulate NaK for a total running
time of 90 hr. During most of this
period the temperature was held at
200 to 300°F, although short runs
were made at room temperature and also
as high as 400°F. No indication of
wear or corrosion was found on any of
the parts upon dissassembly, but a
considerable accumulation of alkali
oxides was found at the tabs of the
motor cans and close to the walls of
the pump volute where the liguid is
believed ‘to have been relatively
stagnant. A Fischer-Porter Flowrator
was used for flow measurements and
operated with complete satisfaction
even at the higher (400°C) tempera-
tures.

 

(2)4, R. Frithsen and M. Richardson, ‘Canned
Rotor Pump,’ ANP-65, op. cit., p. 170.

 

The limitation on operating temper-
ature for this pump 1s believed to be
determined by thermal damage to the
insulation in the motor windings. To
increase the permissible operating
temperature, an order has been placed
with the General Electric Company for
winding two motor stators with class H
wire which 1s capable of withstanding
a temperature of 500°F. In addition,
a proposal has been requested from
Allis-Chalmers Company for special
wire which can be used at 7T00°F. With
the latter winding and by cooling the
liquid fed into the moter cans, it is
expected that liquid metals or salts
can be pumped at 1000°F or higher.

A 3-hp fluid-bearing pump has been
designed and has been partially fabri-
cated to test a number of revisions in
the design of the smaller pump and to
determine the practicability of seal-
ing up the smaller model. This pump
is expected to be ready for check runs
with water about October 1.

Level Tank Pump (W. B. McDonald,
ANP Division). A Duriron conventional
pump has been modified for operating
while immersed in liquid metals. This
pump has a capacity of approximately
12 gpm at a 40-ft developed head. A
conventional packing gland is used to
seal the shaft, and a labyrinth fitting
closely about the shaft minimizes the
amount of liquid metal by-passed to
the level tank. This pump will operate
while immersed in liquid metal in a
level tank and will be driven by a
motor on an overhung shaft mounted on
top of the tank. ‘Actual testing
awaits the availability of a test loop.

were taken at lower temperatures, the
larger part of the operation was con-
ducted at 750°F, which was the maximum
temperature recommended for the pump

was increased to 1000°F to obtain
performance curves and to determine

able with the pump cell supplied.

TEST LOOPS

A. G. Grindell, Engineering
and Maintenance Division

The "calibration" loop and the
"sodium manometer" loop, both of which
were designed to calibrate and other-
wise check flowmeters, have been
operated with liquid metals during the
past quarter. To date the more sig-
nificant application of these loops
has been in conjunction with pump
tests.

Calibration Loop. The calibration
loop, which was designed primarily to
check electromagnetic flowmeters
against venturi types and to check the
performance of electromagnetic pumps,
has been equipped with heaters, thermo-
couples, pressure measuring devices,
a lock valve for operating on a con-
stant weight of sodium, and a static
cold leg for continually removing
oxygen from the circulating sodium.

The system was degreased with per-
chloroethylene, evacuated, outgassed
at 800°F, and flushed twice with
sodium at 800°F. In this condition
it has operated satisfactorily as a
test loop for the G. E. electromagnetic
pump described above.

Sodium Manometer Loop. The sodium
manometer loop is an experimental loop
designed to afford means of developing,
testing, and gaining experience on
flow-nozzle manometer type flowmeters
and simultaneously developing and
testing electromagnetic flowmeters.
The first attempt to pump sodium dur-
ing the period resulted in electro-
magnetic pump cell failure and sodium
fire during the start-up.

The loop was dismantled, repaired,
and restarted. In this test the
electromagnetic pump was provided with
a flexible secondary conductor, and
during the first 2 hr of operation at
constant power input, flow increased
from 2.5 to 9 gpm. This increase in
pumping rate was attributed to 1in-
creased wetting of the pump cell wall,
and increased pump input power over-
heated the flexible secondary con-
ductor. Pump power was decreased, but
loop temperature was taken up to 890°F.
The pump failed after 27 hr of operation
owing to the inadequate current capacity
of the flexible secondary conductor;
another conductor 2)% times the cross-
sectional area of the first 1s now
being fabricated.

SEAL TESTS

Development of seals for pumps
handling liquid metals or other coolant
at 1500°F has received attention
throughout the period. Tests have

. aa
 

FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

been conducted simultaneously with
pump experiments in some instances,
while in others tests have been con-
ducted in simulated equipment. The
seal types include a frozen-sodium
seal, metal-to-metal seals, and metal-
to-metal seals at the end of a bellows.

Frozen-Sodium Seal (W. B., McDonald,
ANP Division). A seal employing the
principle of solidifying a column of
sodium around a rotating shaft is
under development. The testing device
consisted of a pot containing sodium
at 1500°F. A sleeve extended from
below the sodium level in the pot to
the outside, and a shaft rotated inside
this sleeve. Sodium was forced by gas
pressure into the annular space between
the rotating shaft and the sleeve. A
refrigeration coil, to cool the sodium
to below 1ts freezing point, was wound
around the outside of the sleeve and
soldered to 1t to increase thermal
conductivity. The rotating shaft was
1% in. in diameter with a diametrical
clearance of 0.032 in. between the
shaft and sleeve. By the end of the
period this seal had operated for
approximately 400 hr against a pressure
of 18 psi. The coolant employed was
kerosene refrigerated by passing
through a coil immersed in a dry ice
and ethylene glycol bath.

At the end of the period a second
test using sodium at 1500°F but with
the pressure differential increased to
26 psi was underway. Also, a con-
ventional centrifugal pump was modified
by adding a frozen-sodium seal and was
installed in a pump test loop (Fig.
2.3). The relatively short space
between the pump and the bearings is
expected to limit the temperature to
which the circulating sodium can be
raised; however, this pump was de-

 

livering 15 gpm of sodium at 650°F at
2000 rpm at the end of the period.

Bellows Seal (A. P. Fraas and M. E.
LaVerne, ANP Division). A Dureg stain-
less steel centrifugal pump(3) was
reworked to provide radial holes in
the rear face of the impeller to keep
the seal cavity dry and was operated
for 80 hr with sodium at temperatures
up to 1000°F. Tests with water showed
that the design is effective in
scavenging liquid that leaks into the
seal cavity through the labyrinth seal
on the rear face of the impeller. The
test with sodium was discontinued when
finely divided sodium was found in the
silicone 0i1il circulated over the outer
side of the bellows seal. Since only
gas should have been in contact with
the inner side of the seals, and since
the liquid level control had given
difficulty with sticking of a solenoid
valve, the rig was disassembled for
inspection. All parts were found in
good condition except the bellows
which found to have two axial
cracks on the periphery of two con-
volutions. The test will be repeated
with another bellows.

Graphitar and Tool Steel Seal
(W. B. McDonald, ANP Division). A seal

Graphite) ring sandwiched between a
stationary member and a rotating member
made of Ketos tool steel sealed suc-
cessfully against a gas pressure of 10
psi at a seal temperature of 350°F for
450 hr. Shaft speed was approximately
2000 rpm. This test was terminated at
450 hr in order to make changes in the
test equipment to enable NaK vapors to
be introduced to the sealing members.

INSTRUMENTATION
J. F. Bailey, Consultant to
ANP Division

The development of suitable ianstru-
ments for indicating flows, pressures,
levels, etc. 1s an important con-
sideration for the adequate testing of
liquid-metal systems and for the
successful operation of the ARE.
Recently considerable thought has been
given to these instrumentation problems,
with the result that a study has been
made of all types of level control
devices to determine the advantages
and the disadvantages of each. The
types studied include electroresistance,
electromagnetic, eleéctroreluctance,
gas flow, and float, and recommended
applications for zach have been com-
piled. This work has been done with
the view to designing a vigorous re-
search program to develop adequate
instruments for application by both
the Experimental Engineering and the
ABE groups.

At the present, spark plug type
probes are being used to control
levels. This method is simple but
unreliable because of periodic short-
ing out of the probes. FElectro-
resistance probes for level indication
are to be investigated in an experi-
mental system which is presently under-
going fabrication. Experimental work
is to determine the merits of this
type of probe as a possible replace-
ment for the spark plug type.

A model of the gas-flow control has
been set up in the Liquid Models Test

 

Laboratory, and the operating charac-
teristics are being studied with water
as the liquid. Experimental work on
other types is in the planning stage.

During the quarter two magnets for
use with electromagnetic flowmeters
were made by using two U-shaped Alniceo
V pieces and cold-rolled steel spacers.
These magnets givea flux of 1500 gauss
across a lX%-in. gap. Using l-in.
stainiess steel tubing with these
magnets, a flow of 20 gpm gives an
induced voltage of 10.6 mv.

The low-flux magnets have advantages
in that their use permits existing
equipment to be used for recording
high flows, and braking effect in the
flow circuit 1s reduced. When flows
are below 10 gpm, the magnet strength
should be above 2500 gauss to allow
the same recording equipment to be
used with higher accuracy.

STRESS~-RUPTURE TESTS
J. L. Gregg, Consultant to:
ANP Division

Stress-rupture tests are being con-
ducted by the Experimental Engineering
Group to determine the strength of
materials at elevated temperatures.
For testing, sections of a tube of
type 316 stainless steel and one of
inconel were machined to 0.015 in.
wall thickness, pressurized to 110 psi
with argon, and immersed in sodium at
1500°F. The gas pressure produced a
hoop stress of approximately 1500 psi
in the thinned section of the tube.
By the end of the quarter, these tubes
had been under test for approximately
500 hr without failure, indicating
that attack of sodium on moderately

is rather small. Equipment is being
assembled for testing sheet metal in
sodium at elevated temperatures.

SELF-WELDING TESTS

J. L. Gregg, Consultant to ANP Division
A. P. Fraas and M. E. LaVerne,
ANP Division

Self-welding tests are being con-
ducted in sodium at 1500°F to provide
information pertinent to seals, valves,
bearings, etc. for the ARE. Preliminary
results show that inconel has only a
slight tendency to weld to 1inconel

true for stainless steel.

The same 1s

Inconel has
shown no tendency to weld to zirconium
in any experiment conducted thus far.

Consideration of their atomic
structure had indicated that zirconium
should be as unlikely to weld to iron-
chrome-nickel alloys as any metal
available. In order to test this
supposition, a 304 stainless steel
standard globe valve was reworked to
provide a zirconium washer floating on
the valve stem between the seat and
the valve disk of 347 stainless steel.
The reworked valve was operated in
sodium for 142 hr, 48 at 1200°F and
and 94 at 1500°F. Operation con-
sisted in a number of closings and
openings, the required opening torque
being taken as a measure of any
tendency toward welding.

No indication of welding was obtained
during the test, and visual examination
after completion of the test disclosed
no signs of welding between the zir-
conium washer and either the seat or

disk. A second test is being made

24

with three valves an parallel on the
same rig, one valve having a zir-
conium washer, one a molybdenum washer,
and one just the standard stainless
steel valve disk.

VALVE-PACKING EXPERIMENTS

W. C. Tunnell, ANP Division

Since the ARE system as designed
requires valves to operate at 1500°F,
a program for determining valve design
characteristics is underway. If con-
ventional valves should prove un-
satisfactory, it 1s likely that a
bellows type valve would be a suitable
alternative. Such a valve would re-
quire packing to provide safety
features and also to permit temporary

Following is a list of the materials
tested and the pressures and tempera-
tures reached during preliminary in-
vestigations:

1. Amosite asbestos: held sodium
for 21 hr at 1500°F under 15 psi
before leaking.

2. Graphite powder: leaked sodium
at 600°F under 10 psi pressure,

3. Met-L-X: held sodium for 2 hr
at 1500°F under 15 psi before
leaking.

4, Lead-mill slag: held sodium for
10 days at 1500°F under 15 psi
pressure; no leaks had occurred
before experiment was terminated.

5. Nickel metal powder: held sodium

psi pressure; no leaks were
observed before experiment was
terminated.

6. Soda ash: leaked sodium at
1300°F under 10 psi pressure.

Since this experiment was considered
a preliminary screening operation for
selecting possible packing materials,
no effort was made to operate the
valve stem when the sodium reached
1500°F. Other equipment is being
designed with smaller clearances be-
tween the sealing parts of the pack-
ing glands to afford more conclusive
tests of powdered or granular materials,

CONTAMINATION OF LIQUID-METAL SYSTEMS

The corrosion of metal containers
by liquid metals, in this case primarily
sodium, is attributed. to the oxygen
contamination in the system. Nominal
precautions to exclude oxygen from
liquid-metal systems, including the
use of inert-gas blankets and cleaned
systems, had been taken, but they did
not succeed in limiting corrosion to
the desired level. It became apparent
that even the small remaining oxygen
contamination was a fault, and conse-
quently provisions for its reduction
have been developed. The three main
sources of oxygen, barring leaks, are
from scale in the mechanical system,
from the sodium charged to the system,
and from the inert-gas atmosphere used
with the system. Oxygen contaminaticn
from each of these sources is minimized
by techniques now in use.

Cieaning of Liguid-Metal Systems
{R. Devenish and H. R. Bronstein, ANP
Division). Ligquid-metal systems re-

quire careful cleaning prior to being

 

1951

put into operation to remove welding
scale, oxides, absorbed gases, etc.,
to reduce contamination of circulating
coolant. These systems are now being
degreased with hot perchloroethylene,
after which they are evacuated and
outgassed at approximately the temper-
ature of operation. An experiment is
underway in the calibration loop to
test the efficiency of preconditioning
a systemwith sodium prior te operation.
In this experiment, in addition to
degreasing and evacuating, sodium was
circulated at 800°F and removed, and
clean sodium was introduced. This
second batch of sodium was circulated
for 3 to 4 hr at BOO°F also and then

dumped. Clean sodium was provided for
operational use. By the end of the
period, the loop had operated for

approximately 175 hr with no apparent
difficulty due to faulty cleaning
procedures.

Equipment has been installed for
descaling stainless steel alloys by
the "Virgo Salts" process promoted by
Hooker Electrochemical Company. In
this process the metal is immersed in
a molten caustic, which converts scale
to salts soluble in hot dilute hydro-
chloric acid. After these salts are
removed by hydrochloric acid, parts
are brightened and passivated by a
dip in nitric acid. No results show-
ing the efficiency of this process
were available by the end of the
quarter.

Removal of sodium from systems after
operation is a problem also receiving
attention during the period. Sodium
is now removed from small tube passages
by immersing the entire assembly in a
water bath which is heated up to 100°C
by live steam. When the residual
sodium has melted, it 1s forced from
the small passages by gas pressure.

25
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Of course, some burning and small
explosions occur which require that the
operation be conducted in the open,
but no damage to equipment has been
experienced. Sump tanks are now
emptied by heating to above the melt-
ing point of sodium and flowing it
either by gravity or gas pressure into
an ash can immersed in a heated oil
bath which keeps the sodium from pro-
jecting above the surface, thereby pre-
venting a combination oil-and-sodium
fire.

Purification of Liquid Metals
{(L. A. Mann, ANP Division). Methods

the oxide content to acceptable levels

eight loops, pump test loops, etc.
In the method
now in use NaK 1s held at
approximately 250°F for at least 24 hr
to allow suspended oxide particles
time to agglomerate. The metals are
then filtered through a 5-4 sintered
stainless steel filter into another
fill tank. From this tank the metal
is again filtered through a 5-u filter
into the operating system. Analytical
results indicate that double filtration
consistently reduces the oxide content
to below 200 ppm. The results also
indicate that no appreciable reduction

Purification of Inert Gases (L. A.
Mann, ANP Division). Inert gases used
for blanketing liquid metals in operat-
ing systems require purification to
minimize oxygen content. Argon gener-
ally contains on the order of 20 to 50
ppm oxygen, and helium cylinders have
shown as high as 65 ppm {chemical
analyses are reported in Sec. 19). A
purification apparatus has been put
into operation which removes oxygen
from blanketing gases by bubbling

26

through a column of NaK. Tests thus
far indicate that use of this system
consistently reduces the oxygen con-
tent of gases used in operating systems
to below 15 ppm, which is considered a
safe level, As an added precaution,
helium cylinders have been set aside
for the exclusive use of the ANP
Experimental Engineering Group, and
these cylinders are never permitted to
go below 100 psi to prevent air from
being introduced, These methods, which
are currently in use,

filtered sodium generally contained

operating equipment. From the time of
fill to termination, the oxygen content
of sodium in thermal-convection loops
rose from 0.02 to 0.03%, while cor-
responding results from figure-eight
loops were 0.02 and 0.06%, respectively.

INVESTIGATION OF SODIUM CONDENSATION

H. R. Bronstein, ANP Division
Condensation of sodium in gas-
pressurizing lines leading to operat-
ing systems was investigated further
during the quarter. Electrostatic
precipitation showed that plugging was
due to a solid aerosol phenomenon, and
that quantities of sodium removed by
the precipitator were of such a magni-
tude that a means of returning this
condensate to the main tank should be
sought. Consequently, the precipitator
was redesigned to allow for periodic
or continuous melting of the sodium
collected. The experiment was rerun
on a dynamic gas flow basis with traps
placed after the precipitator to col-
lect any sodium getting through 1t.
No sodium was detected beyond the
electrostatic precipitator.

NaK traps have been suggested as a
possible solution for the problem of
gas-line plugging. Models of several
types have been built, and their
operating characteristics are being
studied: with air and water. From
information obtained from these tests,
a trap for use with operating systems
may be designed.

A group fromthe MIT Practice School
investigated three methods of reducing
or preventing sodium plugging of

blanketing-gas lines during the period.

These methods were (1) electrostatic
precipitation, (2) a sodium condenser
coil immersed in a hot oil bath, and

(3) a NaK bubbler. Although all methods

 

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

tested proved to be partially effective,
results of work by this group indicated
that the oil-bath trap was the most
practical. Design improvements would
increase the efficiency of all methods,
however.

The oi1il-bath condenser causes
particles to condense on the walls of
the tubing because of its long length
and curvature, and, upon condensation,
the sodium flows back into the main
tank by gravity since the oil tempera-
ture 1s maintained just above the
melting point of sodium. Additional
experiments to determine the effect
of variations in tubing length and size

Fraas,

The heat-exchanger model designed
for testing in the figure-eight loop
has been tested with NaK at 800, 1000,
and 1200°F, and a curve of heat-
transfer coefficient as a function of
the flow rate has been obtained. The
experimental data give values as much
as 40% below those calculated from
Lyon’s formula (*) at low flow rates,
but check closely at high flow rates.
As soon as endurance testing 1s com-
pleted, a report will be issued on the
the flow and heat-transfer tests which
have been carried out on heat-exchanger
and fuel-element models.

visions have been made for placing
barriers around equipment undergoing
test. The exhaust system 1s designed
to give a linear facial velocity of
100 to 150 ft/min. Four power-control
panels similar to those 1n for
thermal-convection-loop operation have

3. REACTOR PHYSICS

N. M. Smith, Jr.,

The principal subjects of activity
have been the calculation of the
static characteristics of the design
referred to here as the "ARE of 10
June 1951" and extensive calculation
of the kinetic behavior of the ARE by
machine techniques. The design of 10
June 1951 refers to an ARE of two-
thirds the core volume of that in the
design of 10 March 1951.

reduction of core size,

Besides
manufacturing
specifications and tolerances required
a reduction of the average density of
moderator in both core and reflector
and an 1ncrease in structure and
coolant volume, The effect of the
density changes overrides the effect
of reduction of core size, resulting
in a nel 1ncrease 1n uranium l1nventory
requirement. Minor changes in the
static coefficients which resulted are
summarized in tabular and graphical

form.

The uranium investment required 1s
estimated to be 27.8 1b +10%, -20%,
for the depleted, hot, poisoned,
instrumented reactor with control rod
thimbles in place. Allowance for
expansion of liguid fuel through the
boron curtain adds a requirement of
1.4 1b to the above figure, yielding
a total inventory requirement of 29.2
1b of uranium,

The effectiveness of mutual shading
effects of a hexagonal array of seven
2-in, B,C control rods has been calcu-
lated using three-group procedure
made equivalent to the 32-group pro-
cedure for a homogeneous reflected
reactor, With one rod in the center,
and six on a ring surrounding the

 

Physics Division

center, the total reactivity ef-
fectiveness is insensitive to changes
in the radius of the ring between 6.5
and 10.5 in. Absorption in the perman-
ently placed thimbles will reduce the
differential effect of the seven rods
to 0.22 in Ak/k. Mutual shading to
the extent of a reduction of ef-
fectiveness of seven isolated control
rods by 14% is indicated by the calcu-
lations.

The kinetic response of the ARE to
arbitrary changes of multiplication
constant and to changes in inlet
coolant temperature for various values
of neutron lifetime and of fuel temper-
ature coefficient has been studied and
graphs are presented. The results
show that the fuel temperature responds
in an overdamped fashion to reactivity
changes well over prompt critical.

A start-up accident throwing the
reactor prompt critical at a low

(300-watt) level was studied, re-
sulting in a tolerable transient.
These calculations have been made

by starting with steady-state initial
conditions and by numerical integration
of the set of nonlinear differential
equations by IBM machine procedure.
Work has continued on the development
of other IBM calculations: multiregion
problems, reactor solutions in cy-
lindrical coordinates, and the effect
of a boron layer between core and
reflector. :

Various problems relating to the
physics of reactor calculations or
to the physics of the ARE arediscussed.
These include a proper formulation for

31
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

the age theory of the relation between
neutron flux and slowing-down density,
the transmission coefficient of a
boron curtain, and heating in the
boron curtain,

Calculations have been started on
the physics of hydrogeneous reactors,
and in particular for a NaOH moderated
and cooled reactor. Results are quoted.

IBM CALCULATIONS

Production Report (F, C. Uffelman
and P. Johnson, Uranium Control
Department). Reactors. During the
period ending September 1, 1951 the
IBM section completed calculations on
84 reactors. Included in these 84
reactors were four bare reactors
calculated by the end-point linear
approximation method and three adjoint
reactors. This brings the total number
of reactors calculated by the EPLA
method since calculations were begun
in February to 182 reactors.

Programing for the calculation of
reactors with an absorbing layer be-
tween core and reflector is very nearly
complete. PRecause the method(!) used
consists in making two parallel calcu-
lations for flux distributions in the
reactor and combining the results of
these calculations for each group be-
fore going on to the next group, the
calculation of a reactor blanketed
with B,C will take between five and
six times as long as the calculation
of a regular reactor.

Cores and Reflectors. During the
period ending September 1, 1951 average
cross-sections and constants were
calculated for 26 cores and reflectors,
and "constant" variations were calcu-
lated for 34 cores and reflectors. Of
the cores calculated, 16 were hy-
drogenous and required calculation of
the following factors in addition to
those calculated for nonhydrogenous
cores:

A new set of cross-section boards
and procedures is being set up for
calculation of special cross-sections
and constants, The new set-up will be
more flexible but slower in operation
than the specialized set-up used for
regular nonhydrogenous cores, so that
the old set-up will continue to be
used for regular cores and reflectors.

Summary of Calculations on the ARE
(B. T. Macauley, USAF). Multigroup
reflected-reactor calculations on the
latest ARE design, hereafter referred
to as the design of 10 June 195] and
illustrated in Fig. 3.1, were made
during the past quarter. The core of
this design, having auranium inventory
of 25 1b, is referred to as Core 93.
The composition of the core and the
design data are given in Table 3.1.

Two series of reflected reactor
calculations were made; the first
consisted of a spherical core having
the properties listed in Table 3.1 and
surrounded by the side reflector
(Reflector 519), and the second series

34

of calculations consisted of a spheri-
cal core having the properties listed
in Table 3.1 and surrounded by the
bottom reflector (Reflector 520).
The constituents in both the side and
bottom reflectors are given in Table

3.2.

Calculations were made using the
compositions of the ARE core (Core 93)
except for varying the uranium con-
centration and using Reflector 520.
The results were plotted showing how
kets varies with uranium investment
(Fig. 3.2). Also, calculations were
made using Core 93 (25 1b uranium
investment) and each of Reflectors 519
and 520, varying the core thickness to
show how k varies with the reflector

thickness Hie. 3.3).

Graphs of k, f Vs. reflector thick-
ness for the ee right cylindrical
core design (Core 84; incomplete curves
previously reported in the last
quarterly), as well as this core re-
duced in volume by one-third (Core 921)
and one-sixth (Core 92) have been drawn
and show the same general relations
as indicated in Fig. 3.3 for the ARE

core (Core 93).

The reflector saving for the ARE
core {Core 93) is given in Fig. 3.4.

Numerical calculations were made to
determine various design and nuclear
coefficients, The results are summa-

rized in Table 3.3.

The total effect on reactivity of

investigated. The pattern was one
axial rod and a ring of six at the
same radius equally spaced around the
center rod, Five different distances
from the axis were tried for the ring

of six. The total Av/v (effect of
thimble not deducted) obtained for the

by the fact that two opposing factors

flux but the shadowing effect of rods
on each other 1s large; on the other
hand, when the rods are put farther
from the axis they are inserted into a
region of lower undisturbed flux, but
any one rod does not tend to feel such
a large flux depression caused by the

 

insertion of neighboring rods. The
two effects counteract to give a rather
broad region of good rod placement. It
is known from previous calculations (®
however, that if the rods are very
close to the axis or very far out
toward the reflector, a sharp loss in
combined effectiveness is incurred.
Since the hexagon moderator blocks are
about 3¥% in. across flats, it develops
that the possible radii available for
rod placement are 3%, 7.5, 11.25 is.,
etc. The closest to optimum place-
ment 1s 7.5 1in., and this has been
adopted in the current ARE design.

BEINETICS OF THE AIRCRAFT
REACTOR EXPERIMENT

M. J. Nielsen, USAF
J. W. Webster, Physics Division

In the last quarterly report it was
mentioned that solution of the non-
linear kinetic equations for the ARE
was 1n progress on the IBM machines.
Three graphs were included showing the
calculated response of flux (or power)
and fuel! temperature toa step increase
in reactivity of 0.009125 (25% over

prompt critical).

This quarter the adaptation of the
kinetic equations to solution by IBM
machines was continued. Three types
of problems were considered: (1) the
response to astep change in reactivity
with the coolant inlet temperature held
constant, (2) the response to a change

48 i |
 

‘FOR

in the coolant inlet temperature with
no contrel rod motion, and (3) the
response to a change in the coolant
inlet temperature with the control
rod being activated by the change in
coolant inlet and outlet temperature.

The equations and method of solution
have been written up in ANP-68.(9)
Solutions for the ARE (3-megawatt) and
ANP (200-megawatt) reactors and for
variations of parameters in the neigh-
borhood of those for the ABE and ANP
will be distributed in report form in
the near future.

The results of kinetic calculations
completed to date by this method are
presented in the form of curves of
flux vs, time, fuel temperature vs.
time, and phase plots of flux vs. fuel
temperature. The latter type of plot
has the advantage that the new asymp-
totic steady-state flux and fuel
temperature can be shown.

Most of the curves bave to do with
the response of the flux and fuel
temperature to a sudden change of con-
trol rod position or to an accident
such as a deformation that might cause
a step increase in k. The changes in
reactivity inserted are Sk = 0.002,
0.004; 0.006, and 0.009125 where the
last represents a 25% increase over
prompt critical. The corresponding
flux and fuel-temperature response

are illustrated in Figs. 3.14, and
3.15. A phase plot combining these
two figures is given ‘in Fig. 3,16.

Various parameters are changed to study
their effect, for example, the neutron
lifetime, the uranium mass-reactivity
coefficient which has to do partly
with the effectiveness of the B,C

of Kinetic Equations of Cylindrical Liquid-Fuel
Reactors, ANP-68 (Sept. 18, 1951).

curtain at the top of the core, and the
conductivity of the fuel. The reactor
is assumed to be at its design power
of 3 megawatts at time zero except in
one calculation ~~ investigation of
start-up accident in which the
power is taken as 300 watts at t = 0.

In none of the cases considered
does the energy release seem sufficient
to damage the reactor, and in all
cases the fuel temperature responded
in an overdamped fashion, The fuel
temperature for the case of 8k =
+0.009125 stabilizes out at a new
temperature 186°C hotter than the
design value of 800°C when no counter
control rod action is taken. There
is, of course, some magnitude of 5k,
which would cause temperatures result-
ing in failure of the fuel tubes or
fuel solution before the stabilization
occurred,

Mass-Reactivity Coefficient. The
investigation of the effect, on the
response, of assuming different values
for the uranium mass-reactivity coef-
ficient (Figs. 3.17 and 3.18) demon-
strated the strong sensitivity of the
response to this quantity. It is
clearly very important that the B,C
curtain be as opaque to neutrons as it
is possible to make it.

Fuel Conductivity. The increase in
the fuel conductivity by a factor of
10 had remarkably little effect on the
response to a dk_ (Fig. 3.19). The
explanation seems to be that the heat
input to the fuel! due to fission 1is
rather large compared to the loss by
heat transfer to the coolant during
the time of the power pulse. Hence a
change in the cooling term {which is
about a factor of 2 rather than 10
since the conductivity affects only

one term of several in the heat-
transfer expression) does not markedly
affect the shape or magnitude of the
power pulse,

Neutron Lifetime. Variation of
neutron lifetime ! was calculated only
for the case of 8k less than the
delayed neutron fraction (and with the
stabilizing effect of the fuel expansion
neglected in order to see more clearly
how the lifetime affects the growth of
flux). For Sk, larger than SB, the
delayed neutron fraction (and no self-
stabilization), the flux grows, of
course, approximately like

PR

When 8k _ is less than the fraction
of delayed neutrons, the flux also
increases very rapidly initially (as
if all fission neutrons were prompt)
with an initial slope inversely pro-
portional to the lifetime. However,
after a time which is directly pro-
portional to the lifetime, the flux
curve flattens out with a rather sharp
Yknee™ and rises from then on with the
"stable" reactor period (when there
are no self-stabilizing features).
The stable reactor period is a function
of the 8k _ but not of the neutron
lifetime. The rapid initial rise in
the flux is due to the fact that the
rate at which delayed neutrons are
being returned to the population is
almost equal to the rate at which
delayed-neutronemitters are being
created, while the flux is still near
the steady-state value. The reactor
thus behaves momentarily as if all
fission neutrons were prompt. These
facts are borne out qualitatively in
comparing the flux response to a ok _ =
0.002 for three different assumed

56

lifetimes (Fig. 3.20). Equation
11.35.3 of TID-386('?) provides a
mathematical interpretation of the
flux behavior as obtained (Fig. 3.20).

Although the effect on reactivity
of the fuel expansion was not included
in these calculations, it is apparent
that for step changes in reactivity
less than the fraction of delayed
neutrons the peak power in the power
pulse (when fuel expansion is allowed)
will be roughly independent of the
neutron lifetime for lifetimes smaller
than 10°% sec.

Start-Up Accident. In regard to
the investigation of the response to a
start-up accident, the results (Fig.
3.21) indicate that a step change in
reactivity at low power will be less
serious than the same step change at
high power from the point of view of
fuel temperatures reached,

Coolant Temperature. The response
of the flux and fuel temperature to a
step increase in the inlet coolant
temperature of 100°C is shown in Fig.
3.22. Since the rise in the coolant
temperature as the coolant passes
through the ARE core (at design power
of 3 megawatts) is 194°C, the drop
through the heat exchanger is roughly
the same. A rise in reactor inlet
coolant temperature of 100°C implies
a rise of heat-exchanger outlet temper-
ature of approximately 100°C. The
temperature drop through the heat
exchanger must have been 94 instead of
194°C, This implies that the external
power requirement was suddenly reduced
from 3 to (94/194) x3 = 1.45 megawatts.

temperature at 100°C hotter than the
steady-state design value, and it was
found that the reactor would, after a
long time, steady out at a new power
of 1.575 megawatts, assuming no change
in control-rod setting. This is very
close to the new power demand, but,
even if the coolant circuit from heat-
exchanger outlet to reactor inlet was
long enough to allow the reactor to
settle to this new power, several more
circuits of the coolant accompanied by
small incremental temperature adjust-
ments would be required before the
power output settled to the new
requirement.

Actually,

error signal which 1s such a function

it 1s planned to set the

of the inlet and outlet coolant temper-
atures that the point in the reactor
coolant pass which is at 1250°F under
design power remains at this tempera-
ture (this point is about one-third of
the way through the reactor). The
temperature, outlet
and fuel tempera-
ture will adjust themselves to new
conditions when a new power require-
ment is made, but always with the
fulcrum point of the coolant at 1250°F,
The scheme ensures that the coolant
pumps which are located at the reactor
coolant inlet end will not be subjected
to high-temperature coolant (approxi-
mately 1500°F) when the reactor is at
low power. This would occur 1f the
control rod was not moved.

inlet coolant
coolant temperature,

An interesting feature of the curves
showing the response of the flux to a
step increase 1n coolant temperature
of 100°C is the "thermometer" effect
of the fuel-tube expansion. This

expansion lets more fuel into the core
momentarily and the power increases.
The fuel itself soon feels the thermal
effect of the coolant temperature,
however, at which point fuel 1s lost
to the core owing to expansion above
the B,C curtain, and the power starts
down.

The Transmission Coefficient of the
B,C Curtainin the ANP and ARE Reactors
(C. B. Mills, Physics Division). A
boron carbide curtain is part of the
design of the ANP and ARE reactors.
The transmission coefficient as a
function of lethargy of this curtain
is required for determination of
criticality coefficients and the
neutron lethargy and space distribution.

The B,C curtain is 2 in. thick in
the ANP and 1 in. thick in the ARE
reactor. In both cases it 1s a dense
layer thickly studded with coolant-
tube holes. For purposes of calculation
the transmission of a solid slab is
first computed and them a constant
correction due to the total aperture
of the holes is added. The transmission
coefficient is almost unity for the
high-energy neutrons. For thermal and
near-thermal neutrons, the holes
provide the only leakage through the
curtain.

The transmission y of a layer of
thickness T and macroscopic absorption
cross-section ¥_ is given by the
integral

 

66

This function has been integrated
numerically, (!*) The leakage through
the holes is evaluated by assuming a
cosine distribution of neutron ve-
locities (as for ¥) with a probability
p(x) of being x cm off the axial line
at each hole being 27x. A projection
of the solid angle subtended by the
reflector side of the hole permits
evaluation of the probability of a
neutron traversing the opening. A
table of the fraction of the neutrons
penetrating the B,C curtain at each
lethargy group is given in Table 3.5.
This table will be used for a trial
solution for the neutron flux in the
vicinity of the absorber, An iteration,
requiring new values of v to fit the
more accurate form of the flux, may be
required,

Heating in the Boron Carbide Curtain
in the ANP Reactor (C. B. Mills,
Physics Division). A solution of the
reflected ANP reactor, including the
effect of the boron carbide curtain
intended to shield the fuelreservoirs,
is not yet complete. The possibility
of some secondary effect preventing
the use of this curtain is of some
interest prior to a more exact calcu-
lation. One such possibility is the
heating in the curtain due to absorption
by the B!%(n,a)Li’ reaction, with a
release of 2.88 Mev.

The model used for an approximate
value of total heating per square
centimeter and power distribution is a
bare reactor with the ANP power distri-
bution, The boron curtain side of the
ANP reactor will be essentially bare
because of the high absorption and low
reflection.

The absorption distribution was thickness of the B,C layer. The power

determined for each of the 31 lethargy
groups by the usual current attenuation
method expressed by the F-function

where bb = zd; 2, is the macroscopic
absorption cross-section and d is the

 

distribution was determined by addition
of the contribution of each lethargy
group at several points through the
B,C curtain. The total power was
46 watts/cm? for the ANP reactor. A
similar calculation gave 0.69 watt/cm?
for the ARE reactor. The power distri-

this power is concentrated near the
core surface of the curtain.

ing factors in reactor power density
is the high temperature at which
the structural and heat-transfer
metals must operate. The highest
temperature to which reactor metals
are exposed is at the inner surface
of the fuel tubes. A rough estimate
of the maximum value of this tempera-
ture is made below. This is compared
to the temperature that would be re-
quired for the same total heat transfer
if the temperature at the inner sur-
face of the reactor fuel tubes is held
constant over the length of the reactor,

THE SODIUM HYDROXIDE REACTOR*

C. B. Mills,

It is necessary to determine the
critical mass of an almost spherical
reactor, 1.25 ft in radius, con-
taining sodium hydroxide as a coolant,
moderator, and reflector. The fractions

are

316 stainless steel structure 20.23
Fuel, uranium, 50 1h/ft3 4.77

This problem is essentially different
from those previously solved by the
ANP Physics Group because of the way
in which neutron diffusion and slowing
down in hydrogen must be treated. Most
methods of solution which treat hy-
drogenous materials correctly are not
correct for this reactor because of
the large absorption and slowing-down
effect of the sodium,
stainless steel, An admittedly
approximate method, ('3) first used
by this group to study the effect of
water on criticality on the ARE
reactor, (18) which sums the effects of
continuous slowing down of neutrons in
heavy materials with the discontinuous

oxygen, and

slowing down in hydrogen, was applied
to this problem. This method of
solution has been discussed in some
detail separately.(17)

4. CRITICAL EXPERIMENTS

A. D. Callihan,

The Critical Experiment Group,
which is responsible for the experi-
mental investigation of preliminary
reactor assemblies, has completed the
investigation of one assembly and is
now taking data on another. The
first mock-up was that of the aircraft
reactor, proposed by General Electric,
which employs water as =a neutron
moderator and air as a heat-transfer
medium. Two modifications of this
reactor with the same hydrogen-to-
carbon-to-uranium atomic ratio were
considered, and the distribution of
thermal neutrons throughout the com-
ponents was compared. The second in-
vestigation, still in progress, 1s a
study of the power and flux dis-
tributions through a graphite-uranium
reactor with carbon-to-uranium atomic

ratio of 990.

CRITICAL ASSEMBLY OF AIR-WATER REACTOR

The study of the proposed air-water-
cycle aircraft reactor, initiated at
the request of the General Electric
Company and executed with the co-
operation of some of their personnel,
has been completed for the present.

In this reactor metallic uranium
of high U??% enrichment was inter-
spersed among blocks of graphite which
simulated the proposed uranium—silicon
carbide core material, and a meth-
acrylate plastic served as an adequate
substitution for water. The plastic
was in 1%-in.-thick horizontal layers
between AY-in.-thick layers of uranium-
bearing graphite. The critical mass

 

Physics Division

of the assembly was about 29 kg.
Measurements of the thermal-neutron
distribution through a unit cell
showed ‘a high concentration in the
hydrogenous material. The thermal
flux in the plastic was 1.8 times the
average 1n the graphite and 3.6 times
that at the surface of the uranium.

The thickness of the individual
uranium pieces was 0.01 in.; this
introduced some self-shielding from
incident neutrons. In an experiment
to evaluate the extent of this effect,
a standard piece of uranium was re-
placed by five pieces, each 0.002 in,
thick, with aluminum foil separating
adjacent ones, In this technique
recoiling fission fragments collect on
the aluminum, and their activity is a
measure’ of the fission rate in, es-
sentially, the surface layer of the
uranium adjacent to the aluminum. A
comparison of the activities on the
successive aluminum surfaces gives,
relatively, the fission rates at
0.002-1n. intervals throughout a fuel
piece. In the reactor under study the
average fission rate throughout a
0.01-1n. fuel piece was 84% of that
occurring at its surface.

The observed large thermal-neutron
concentration in the plastic implied
that the moderator-fuel inhomogeneity
was causing a significant increase in
the uranium requirement. Consequently,
the plastic thickness was reduced to
% in. dnd was placed between ithe
graphite-uranium layers, maintaining
the same H:C:U atomic ratio as before.
Tt was necessary, because of the

79
 

dimensions of available materials, to
alternate the ¥%-in. plastic layers
between 3- and 1}%-in.-thick graphite
layers, thereby probably not achieving
optimum fuel-moderator homogeneity.
The critical mass of this modification
of the original assembly was 18.5 kg,
and a more uniform distribution of
thermal neutrons throughout the com-
ponents resulted.

The data are reported more fully
elsewhere, (1)

dictions. The first of these, de-
scribed in the two preceding ANP
guarterly reports (ANP-60, ANP-65),
was a bare cube having a beryllium
moderator. Further simple reactor
studies were postponed in order to
carry out the air-water-cyecle reactor
investigation described in the above
paragraphs. On completion of these
studies a graphite-uranium reactor was

5. BULK SHIELDING REACTOR

J. L. Meem, Physics Division

The mock-up of the unit shield has
been completed with the water-reflected
Bulk Shielding Reactor. Preliminary
analyses of the data indicate that an
ideal unit shield for a 200-megawatt
reactor with a 3-ft right square
cylindrical core will weigh 124,000 1b.
The construction of the divided shield
is nearly completed, and preparatory
shadow shielding measurements
reported. The spectroscopic instru-
ments required for the divided-shield
measurement appear to be satisfactory.
This reactor; formerly known as the
"swimming pool" or the "Shield Testing
Reactor," is now identified as the

Bulk Shielding Reactor (BSR).

are

REACTOR OPERATION

All measurements during the past
quarter, including those on the unit
shield, have been made with the water-
reflected reactor. (1) Because of the
urgency of the unit shield measure-
ments, the check on the power of the
reactor by measuring the heat rise of

Preliminary measurements using the
gamma-ray scintillation spectrometer
(see below) indicated that to measure
the spectrum at the face of the reactor
a complete set of cold fuel elements
would be required. These cold fuel
elements have been obtained.

MOCK-UP OF THE UNIT SHIELD

During the past quarter the measure-
ments on the mock-up of the unit shield
have been completed and a report is
being written. Preliminary analysis
of the data indicates that an ideal
unit shield around a 3.8-ft-diameter
spherical reactor (approximating a
3-ft right square cylinder) operating
at a power of 200 megawatts will weigh
about 124,000 1b. Final evaluation of
this weight will be given in the above-
mentioned report. The limits of error
of all the measurements will be
analyzed so that the weight for this
mock-up can be definitely bracketed.

Measurements were made of gamma-ray
ionization, thermal-neutron flux, and
fast-neutron dosage along the center-
line beginning at the face of the
shield and proceeding outward into the
water. Runs were made with different
concentrations of borated water up to
0.4% boron by weight.

With the borated water in the
shield, it was observed that the
neutron-flux distribution in the
reactor was altered. Since this would
change the fast-neutron leakage,
neutron-flux measurements with gold
foils were made throughout the reactor

following the procedure in ORNL-1027.

MOCK-UP OF THE DIVIDED SHIELD

The unit shield of lead and borated been reached in the unit shield, and

H,O0 has been optimized for a 3-ft
spherical reactor using double the
boron concentration, now 1.3% boron: by
weight, of the shield presented in
ANP-53.¢Y) Preliminary calculations
now indicate that this results in: an
ideal shield of 50.6 tons, represent-
ing a weight saving of about 3 tons
over the corresponding shield weight
of 53.6 tons, using the data reported
in ANP-53, Appendix B, corrected to a
3-ft reactor. This new low weight
value for a unit shield differs from
that in the preceding section because
of the difference in the core size as
well as in the boron concentration of
the water,

The saving in weight is primarily
the result of the addition of boron
which, by further reducing the number
of high-energy capture gamma rays pro-
duced in the shield, allows the lead
to be placed at smaller radii for the
same attenuation, Jt is doubtful that

therefore work with higher concen-
trations will be continued using
potassium metaborate. With this salt
concentrations of up to 10% boron by
weight can be investigated,

The compositions of the present
shield, the shield of ANP-53, and the
idealized shield for half dose are
presented in Fig. 6.1. The shield had
a nearly constant B?l and therefore
should be very close to the minimum
weight for this concentration of
boron. ¢?? Approximately ten con-
figurations were measured before
achieving the constant R%1 It is
of interest that an additional 6 tons
in shield weight (i.e., 56.5 tons) will
further ‘attenuate both the gamma rays

A simplified design for the patch
required to prevent excess neutron
leakage from ducts perforating a
divided (water) shield can be made on
the basis of the duct test measurements
completed to date. The weight of a
patch needed for a single 6-in.
aluminum- filled duct surrounded by a
l1-in. air-filled annulus was found to
be approximately 1000 1b, exclusive of
duct or container.

The calculation for this patch
weight was based on the data and con-
figuration presented in Figs, 7.1 and
7.2. The duct is straight and extends
beyond the shielda distance sufficient
to attenuate the neutrons to the same
level as 105 cm of water, which is
given in ANP-53¢!) as the thickness of
the divided shield on the rear of the
reactor. The extension is surrounded
by a cone of water which attenuates
neutrons scattered radially to the
appropriate level. This level is the
intensity at the edge of the shield
multiplied by the ratio of the area of
the shield covered by the cone to the
area of the cone.

Some assumption had to be made with
regard to the attenuation radially
from the duct since experimental
limitations prevented measurement of
the thickness required for such a
patch. The attenuation of water for
the Lid Tank source was used as an

testing facilities has permitted the
semiempirical establishment of im-
portant radiation attenuation relations.
An expression was derived for attenu~
ation of neutrons from a point source
in water by analysis of data taken at
the Bulk Shielding Reactor. Similarly,
analysis of Lid Tank data has yielded
an approximate formula for the total
centerline gamma dose which has been
applied to subsequent experiments.

In the continued investigation of
radiation hazards in the ARE, {further
calculations were made on the acti-
vation of the Be0Q moderator, the
detection of leaks in the fuel elements
by means of radioactive tracers, and
the activation of nitrogen and helium
in the reactor pit.

Calculations show the divided-
shield weight to be higher than origi-
nally estimated, owing chiefly to
symmetry and angular distribution
considerations, Some new effects have
been computed relative to the shadow-
shield theory which may prove that
this device is much less useful than
previously believed.

A shield using ammonia in place of
water has been considered which would
provide a decrease in shield weight of
about 7% at takeoff and 13% at landing.

The source was taken to be the
leakage from the side of the reactor

analytical work the source is here
assumed to be circular instead of
rectangular. With these assumptions
1t was possible to fit the shape of
the experimental attenuation curves by
using removal cross-sections for lead
and 1ron of 3.4 and 2.0 barns, re-
spectively, which values are the same
as those obtained in the analysis(*)
of Lid Tank thermal data. The oxygen

INTERPRETATIGN OF LID TANK
GAMMA-RAY DATA

A. Simon, Physics Division

An approximate formula for the
total centerline gamma dose in the
Lid Tank has been applied to several
experiments. The variation in gamma
dose with the number of slabs in a
uniform lead-water shield was re-
produced satisfactorily for several
positions of the detector. In addition,
the variation of gamma dose with
degree of boration of a uniform lead-
water shield was also reproduced.
Differences between experimental and
theoretical normalization factors can
be explained in terms of neglect of
gamma build-up in water.

SHIELDING CALCULATIONS FOR THE ARE

W. K. Ergen, Physics Division

Consideration of the radiation
hazards associated with the ARE has
led to the analytical evaluation of
several such possible hazards. The
instantaneous release of the nitrogen
and helium in the reactor pit could
possibly, but not probably, expose
personnel at nearby sites to a dose
equal to 20 min exposure to the
accepted "maximum permissible concen-
tration" of C!* in air.(%) A means of
detecting leaks in the ARE fuel elements
by the use of radioactive tracers has
been proposed. A re-evaluation of the
activities of the impurities in BeQ,
based upon a later analysis of the
impurities and a revised Co(n,y) cross-
section, still indicates no handling
problem after shutdown.

Activation of Nitrogen and Helium
in the ARE Reactor Pit.(’) Tt is pro-
posed. to fill the ARE reactor pit with
nitrogen during operation as a pre-
cautionary measure in the event of a
sodium leak. Assuming certain average
operating conditions, about 1.3 curies
of C" would be formed by the N*&,p)C!*
reaction. This activity, released in-
stantaneously through a 100-ft stack

under extremely unfavorable and very
rare meterological conditions, would
give personnel at X-10 and the HRE site
a dose equal to a 20-min exposure to
the sccepted maximum permissible
concentration of C'* in air. Twenty
parts per million (by volume) of argon
in the nitrogen would give the same
biological dose as the C!'*. The other
probable impurities of nitrogen as well
as the N'¥(n,¥)N'® reaction, yield
negligible activities.

If the pit were filled with pure
well helium, we would get, by the
He®(n, p)H® reaction, 5.6 % 10°% times
the biological dose computed above for
nitrogen filling.

Activatioe of Impurities in Beo.(®)
Since Memo Y-F20-11 was issued on this
subject, a more accurate chemical
analysis of the Be0O for the ABE showed
the presence of greater amounts of
impurities; also, the cobalt activation
cross-section has been fonnd to be 34
barns, and not 22 barns, as assumed in
Y-F20~11 on the basis of then avail-
able data. Nevertheless, the acti-
vation of the impurities in Be( will
not cause handling problems after the
shutdown of the ARE, under the con-
ditions specified.

with the reactor a point source sur-

a spherical cap of 20° half angle.

emerging out of the calculations:

shield, a change which will not
affect the weight of the ANP-53

neutron shield.

The first-scattered dose at the
crew, with any appreciable
amount of lead crew shielding,
is nearly independent of initial
source energy down to around
1 Mev. Below that it drops off
very rapidly owing to the in-
creased lead absorption. The
SEAC calculations by the National
Bureau of Standards indicate
that the radiation leaving the
reactor shield does not contain
any extremely large proportion
of its energy in low-energy
photons. The current practice
of assuming the source energy
flux to be concentrated at 3 Mev
thus does not lead to error.

Scattering in the lead at the
crew shield has been calculated
using build-up factors computed
by The Rand Corporation. The
resulting increase in dose is a
factor of 2.5 for 1.55 cm of

lead and about 4 for 2.5 cm of
lead.

It has usually been assumed that
in the zone not shielded by the
shadow cap the gamma rays emerge
radially from the reactor shield.
However, if they deviate from
the radial direction, the effect
of the shadow is partly nullified.
Thus, if the emerging rays are
uniformly distributed in angle
from the radial out to 30° and
zero thereafter, the advantage
gained by the shadow shield
drops (in a typical case) from
around 16 to 2. This appears to
be one of the most significant
effects uncovered so far.

An analysis has been completed of
the weight savings realized by re-
placing water in a reactor shield by
anhydrous ammonia. Although the number
of hydrogen atoms per cubic centimeter
is about the same for ammonia and

water, the ammonia density is less
than 70% that of water. The shield
weights for a 4-in.-diameter reactor

delivering 200 megawatts were calcu-
lated for a divided shield employing
water as the hydrogenous material and
for a similar shield with ammonia. The
composite (ammonia) shield is about 7%

lighter at takeoff and, owing te the
evaporation of the boil-off ammonia,
is some 13% ligheer on landing. The
weight savings from use of ammonia
thus appear to be appreciable, but
whether this advantage would be offset
by the obvious disadvantage of carrying
a large volume of a hard-to-handle ma-
terial is still a question.

Mechanical Requirements of an
Ammonia Shield. Anhydrous ammonia has
a vapor pressure of 1 atm at ~28°F and
must therefore be refrigerated to take
care of inleakage of heat from the
atmosphere as well as that due to
neutron and gamma radiation from the
reactor. The mechanical requirements
for maintaining an ammonia shield are
refrigeration equipment, a pressure
shell to maintain the liquid at 120°F
in case the refrigeration fails, and
insulation to reduce heat influx. Since
the heat flux inte the shield due to
nuclear radiations from the reactor
is quite large, a higher temperature
inner shield layer of water, con-
ventionally cooled, and lead is pro-
vided. The lead in this inner shield
is inserted as a "heat trap” to lower
the heat flux into the ammonia.
Approximately 1 ft of water is pro-
vided to remove neutron heat as well
as to reduce secondary gamma production
in the lead heat trap. The heat pro-
duced in the ammonia is calculated from
the gamma flux it will receive. A
section of this shield assembly is
shown in Fig. 8.1.

Calculational Procedure. The total
heat energy (H, inBritish thermal
units) entering the ammonia from the
gamma heating of the iron and lead
heat trap during a 25-hr flight may be
expressed in terms of the thickness
(T, in centimeters) of the lead (assum-

ing a 3-in. iron pressure shell):

"boil-off" of ammonia (B, in pounds)
to dissipate the above heat is:

B = 4.01 x 10% ¢-T7/0.95

The lead heat trap is assumed to
replace some of the lead (for gamma
shielding) on the rear crew shield
disk. But since increasing the thick-
ness of the heat trap increases the
total weight and also decreases the
amount of NH, required for boil-off
refrigeration, the shield must be
optimized with respect to weight for
these two design variables. The
thickness of ammonia neutron shield*
was first calculated to be 35.6 in.,
and the expression for the equivalent
gamma attenuation in the two lead
shields is derived. When this
formation is combined, the total weight
of the ammonia shield, which for the
purposes of this calculation includes
the lead heat trap, the rear crew
shield, and the boil-off ammonia, may
be expressed in terms of the thickness
of the lead heat trap. The weight of
the shield is then minimized by taking
the first derivative of the variable
weights with respect to the thickness
of the lead trap. The thickness of
this trap becomes 1.875 in. and the
thickness of the rear crew shield

3.36 in.

noted that the composite shield is
6550 1b lighter at takeoff and, owing
to the evaporation of the boil-off
ammonia, it will be 12,500 1b lighter

The appeal of the boil-off scheme
for refrigeration lies in its sim-
plicity and in its low weight for
landing, the most critical period of
the flight. In addition, it is possi-
ble that the vapors boiled off could
be burned in the engines for added
thrust. On the other hand, it 1s
entirely possible that the refrigeration
could be accomplished by mechanical
means with considerably less weight.
The Air Force at Wright Field has
agreed to investigate this possibility.

9. NUCLEAR MEASUREMENTS

Continued efforts on the 5-Mev Van
de Graaff accelerator research program
have satisfactorily succeeded in
lowering the machine background,
providing an energy calibration accu-
rate to a few kilovolts, and improving
the ease of operation below 1.5 Mev.

Data taken from a neutron source
with and without beryllium surrounding
the source are being analyzed to de-
termine the (n,2n) reaction in beryl-
lium.

An in-pile lithium loop operating
at 1000°F for one week yielded data on
Bremsstrahlung caused by beta particles
from the Li’ (n,B)Li® reaction. The
average intensicy of the Bremsstrah-
lung was about 2 x 10° Mev/cc/sec with
an average energy of only 0.06 Mev.

THE 3-MEV VAN DE GRAAFF ACCELERATOR
H. B. Willard, Physics Division

Both the neutron and gamma-ray
backgrounds of the 5-Mev Van de Graaff
accelerator have been reduced by the
extensive use of only tantalum in the
vicinity of the beam. Additional
tantalum slits have been provided
during the past quarter in order to
further collimate the proton beam and
reduce these backgrounds to a satis-
factory level. In addition, the
X-ray intensity coming from the reverse
electron current up the tubes has been
found sufficiently low to permit
unshielded operation of a NalI-Thl
crystal counter in the target area.

Gamma-ray vield curves resulting
from the proton bombardment of fluorine

 

and beryllium have been obtained.
These data provide a large number of
energy calibration points in addition
to new information regarding levels in
the compound nuclei involved. By
proper manipulation of the machine, it
was found possible to ochtain data for
proton bombarding energies as low as

0.158 Mev.

In preparation for neutron gross-
section work, the Li’ (p,n)Be’ yield in
the forward direction has been extended
to above 5 Mev. The response of the
Bonner type neutron counter has been
measured. Neutron yield curves for
protons on boron and beryllium have
been obtained from threshold to above
5 Mev.

An experiment has been carried out
in which the neutrons from an (a,n)
source are detected by means of a long
counter. The neutron source isi sur-
rounded by a sphere of beryllium, and
the counting rates with bare source
and source surrounded by the sphere
are measured. Similar measurements are
made with a carbon sphere to estimate
the neutron absorption in the bervyl-
lium sphere.

Measurements have been carried out
with polonium-boron and polonium-
beryllium neutron sources. Beryllium
spheres of 4 and 9 in. diameter and
carbon spheres of 4 and 5% in. diameter
have been measured.

Lithium at 1000°F has been circu-
lated in the X-10 reactor for one week
in a 316 stainless steel loop and sub-
sequently examined. The primary purpose
of this experiment is to study the
Bremsstrahlung activity produced by
beta decay of lithium. Li®, created
by the reaction Li’(n,8)Li%, decays
with a 0.88-sec half-lifes giving a
12.7-Mev beta ray. This beta ray is
absorbed in the lithium stream and the
container walls (1/16-1in. stainless
steel), producing the Bremsstrahlung
activity. Preliminary analysis of the
data indicates the average energy of
the Bremsstrahlung to be about 0,06 Mev
with an average intensity of 2 x 10°
Mev/cc/sec. Actual operation of the
loop 1s discussed in this report in
the section on radiation damage, where
it may be noted that there was no
significant amount of corrosion.

Radiation Detection Equipment. The
1on chambers used in this experiment
were cylindrical in shape (4 in. in
diameter, 4 in. high) with one of the
bases a thin-walled aluminum "window."
The chamber was filled with air at
atmospheric pressure, and its walls
were maintained approximately 150

volts above ground. The chambers and
their amplifying and recording equip-
ment were bench-tested with Co%% of
various strengths so as to simulate
the line sources of the circulating
lithium in the external pile loop.
A lead brick with a 2-in.-diameter
hole was placed between the source and
the counter to act as a collimator for
radiation coming into the counter.
The in situ calibration curves were
approximately linear and of the form
S = AR - b where S is the source
strength per unit length of pipe, RB is
the recorder reading (the amplified
chamber response), A is a constant
inversely proportional to the distance
of the source from the counter, and b
is the background correction which
varies directly as pile power level,
the distance of the

the natural background. The data have
not yet been corrected for the ef-
ficiency of the counter for radiations
of this energy range, and the neutron
flux is still in the process of being
determined.

Bremsstrahlung Activity. The
Bremsstrahlung activity, uncorrected

9.1. By extrapolating back to infinite
velocity we find the Bremsstrahlung
activity for zero decay to be 2 x 10°
Mev/sec per cubic centimeter of natural
lithium (at a flux of about 2 x 10!
neutrons/cm?/sec). Figure 9.2 shows

of the Bremsstrahlung arising from the

of 0.06 Mev. The radiation is identi-
fied as that from Li® since it shows

CORROSION

RESEARCH

WW. D. Manly, Metallurgy Division
H. W. Savage, ANP Division

W. BR. Grimes and F. Kertesz, Materials Chemistry Division

The corrosion program has been ex-
panded to include corrosion by hydrox-
ide and fluoride coolants as well as
the corrosion by liquid metals and
fluoride fuels already under investi-
gation for some time. Although the
majority of the corrosion data are
from static tests, a moderate number
of data on liquid metals are available
for thermal-convection loops. Forced-
convection loops are being developed,
but this development has not yielded
many significant corrosion data as yet.

In general, corrosion of inconel
and stainless steel by pretreated and
carefully handled fuel mixtures in the
absence of radiation is not sufficiently
severe to cause failure in operation
for several hundred hours at 800°C.
Limited experience at higher tempera-
tures suggests that corrosion at 1000°C
will not be excessive. Platinum,
contemplated as thermocouple shield
material, is not appreciably attacked
by the fuel mixture contained in a
platinum or an inconel capsule. Welded
or brazed joints of platinum to inconel
are attacked by the molten eutectic.

Experience with fluoride coolants
indicates that corrosion, at least in
the absence of radiation, will not be
a serious problem with either inconel
or the stainless steels.

Corrosion problems encountered with
hydroxides and with hydroxide-bearing
materials, however, are a great deal
more serious. Sodium hydroxide, either
commercial or specially pure material,

is extremely corrosive to stainless
steel or inconel. Copper, monel, and
nickel are much more resistant although
mass transfer occurs with these ma-
terials, The corrosion by commercial
potassium hydroxide which has been
freed from excess water 1s noticeably
less severe than that by sodium hydrox-
ide but is sufficiently bad to preclude
use of inconel and stainless steel at
the present. Some tests with barium
and strontium hydroxides conducted with
dehydrated commercial material have
that these materials are less

tests is a serious problem,

While the results obtained to date
with hydroxide-bearing systems ‘are
not encouraging, it should be noted
that (1) only in the case of sodium
hydroxide has pure hydroxide been
available for use; (2) inert, rather
than reducing, atmospheres have been
used: and (3) the metal walls have
been in the as-received condition.
While 1t 1s not obvious that changes
in technique will result in improved
corrosion resistance, it 1s suggested
that many variables remain to be tested
before it can be stated that corrosion
of stainless steel and inconel by the
alkalies is necessarily so severe as
to preclude their use.

An extensive number of corrosion
tests, both static and dynamic, have
been conducted with sodium. Jt 1s now
apparent as a result of this work that

103
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

sodium may be contained with little if
any corrosion. Recent static corrosion
tests with sodium at 1000°C in 316
stainless steel for periods up to 1000
hr revealed no surface reaction and
did not indicate any significant weight
change. Operation of thermal con-
vection loops of inconel and several
of the stainless steels with sodium
for 1000 hr at 815°C produced very
little corrosion. Indeed, 1t now
appears that little more can be learned
of sodium corrosion by operating
additional loops of inconel or stain-
less steel with sodium. Tt remains
to be demonstrated, however, that a
circulatory failure will not occur with
sodium in a forced-convection loop in
which flow rates are higher and temper-
ature changes greater.

Metallographic examination of several
lithium- and lead-containing thermal-
convection loops, operated during the
past twee quarters, indicates severe
corrosion of the hot leg and somewhat
less severe corrosion of the cold leg.
Only one of nine such loops completed
the scheduled 1000-hr test; all but
one of the other eight failed because
of an obstruction in the cold leg of
the loop. This obstruction is a build-
up of corrosion products.

and completely satisfactory for
handling the fluorides, since mixtures
thus treated have consistently demon-
strated low corrosion rates on inconel
and a wide variety of stainless steels.
The penetration of inconel by a typical
fuel mixture in 100 hr at 800 and

1000°C does not exceed 4 mils. The
penetration of the stainless steels
(304, 310, 316, 330, 347, 446) in 100

hr at 800 and 1000°C did not exceed
2 mils and was generally less than 1
mil, The corrosion of platinum, in-
troduced in thermocouples, has been
shown to be negligible in the fluoride
fuel at these temperatures.

The Pretreatment Process (G. J.
Nessle, H. S. Powers, and C. J. Barton,
Materials Chemistry Division). In a
previous report(3) the improvement in
corrosion which resulted from treat-
ment of the fluoride fuel with pieces
of stainless steel and inconel at 850
to 900°C prior to filling of the cor-
rosion capsules has been described.
While no mechanism for this improve-
ment has been demonstrated, it appears
likely that this treatment removes
traces of hydrogen fluoride which
result from hydrolysis of some of the
UF, in the fuel. A photograph of an
inconel sample which was used to
"scavenge" the active impurities in a
fluoride bath is shown in Fig. 10.1.
The fluoride thus freed from the active
impurities, and containing some iron,
nickel, and chromium in solution, was
used for making the static fluoride
corrosion tests,

A comparison test has shown that
corrosion by untreated fluorides which
had been vigorously outgassed and then
sealed witha helium atmosphere enclosed
was not appreciably different from
that obtained when the capsules were
sealed with an air atmosphere.

Pretreatments of the metal surface
has not been successful in minimizing
corrosion. Pickling, oxidation, and
decarburization of the metal surface
have seemed to result in increased
corrosion. The oxide film on the
surface as received seems to have
reasonably good corrosion resistance
properties, :

It has been found that some of the
fuel samples, whether pretreated with
structural metals or not, do contain
appreciable quantities of uranium
oxide. Sedimentation experiments in
sealed capsules have shown an in-
crease in uranium content in the lower
section of the capsule without a cor-
responding change in the fluoride
content of the various sections, In

addition, filtration of the molten
fuel through sintered stainless steel
has removed significant amounts of
black uranium oxide. However, uranium
oxide did not increase the corrosion
rate,

Pretreatment of the liguid fuel
with structural metals serves to
introduce appreciable quantities of
iron, chromium, and nickel into the
fuel melt. Chemical analysis of such
fuel mixtures indicates the presence
of 600 to 1200 ppm of iron, 200 to 1000
ppm of chromium, and 30 to 200 ppm of
nickel after pretreatment although
the compounds actually involved have
not been identified. The variation in
concentration observed indicates that
not all these impurities are dissolved,
This is borne out by the fact that some
sedimentation of the iron seems to
occur during the I00-hr corrosion
tests, It also seems evident that the
nickel content of the pretreated fuels
is reduced during the subsequent cor-
rosion testing while the chromium

(H. J. Buttram, N. V, Smith, C. R.

Chemistry Division; A. D. Brasunas,
L. A. Abrams, and E. E. Hoffman,

Metallurgy Division). It appears from
studies to date that corrosion of
inconel and stainless steel by care-
fully handled fluoride fuels is not a
serious factor. Furthermore, improve-
ment of the pretreatment process and
of handling techniques for the pre-
treated material should result in
further improvements. Three different
fuel mixtures, the binary system
NaF-UF, (75-25 mole %), the ternary
system NaF-KF-UF, (46.5-26-27.5 mole
%), and the ternary system NaF-Bel -UF,
(76-12-12 mole %), have each been
tested at 800 and 1000°C with no
significant difference in corrosion.
In general, the corrosion of inconel
specimens in 100 hr with each of these
fuels was of the order of 2 to 4 mils;
that of several stainless steels was
around 1 to 2 mils,

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

In multiplicate experiments im
which individual capsules were removed
at intervals for examination it has
been shown that the major fraction of
the corrosion observed occurs in the
first few hours. Little additional
effect is apparent after 1000 hr of
exposure.

By NaF-BekF ,-UF ,. The ternary
fluoride NaF-BeF,-UF, (76-12-12 mole %)
was also used in corrosion testing.
A 100-hr test with 310 stainless steel
at 1500°F (815°C) showed no metal-
lographic evidence of attack, although
an analysis of the fluoride bath indi-
cated 0.2% iron, 0.02% nickel, and no
chromium to be present. The presence
of nickel and absence of chromium is
the reverse of the findings listed
above for the binary fluoride mixture,
NaF-UF,. However, these differences
may be illusory because tests described
below indicate that gravity segregation
may exist in the container, and the
composition of the fluoride mixture
will depend on the location from which
the test sample was obtained.

A number of fluoride-corrosion
tests were made on commercial alloys
using a mixture of 10.7 mole % BeF,,
68.0 mole % NaF, and 21.3 mole % UF,.
The materials tested are listed in
Table 10.1 together with notes taken
while the exposed specimens were being
studied on the metallograph and results
from bath analyses. The attack in all
cases was not severe, Some decar-
burization was observed, but this 1s
not a highly objectionable type of
surface instability.

Weight losses are undoubtedly caused
by solution of the metal sample into
the fluoride bath as indicated by bath
analyses which are also reported in
Table 10.1. Weight gains, in spite of

110

some loss by solution, must be in-
terpreted as absorption of one or more
bath constituents (fluoride or metal)
into the metal specimen. Comparison
of results of analyses of the fluoride
bath at various levels of the tube
after test with results of the original
fluoride analysis indicate a definite
beryllium, a slight de-
and very little, if

decrease in
crease 1n sodium,
any, decrease in the uranium concen-
tration. These changes in bath
analysis may be directly associated
with the weight gains observed on
several test specimens.

Corrosion of Piatinum (D. G. Hill,
Consultant, Materials Chemistry
Division). Thermocouples are to be
inserted in a number of ARE fuel tubes
to determine the center temperatures
of these structures. Since platinum
was suggested as the material for the
tubular thermocouple wells, it has
been necessary to examine the resist-
ance of this metal and of some welded
joints to the fluoride melt.

Platinum slugs immersed in the raw
or pretreated fuel, NaF-KF-UF_, in
platinum capsules showed no appreciable
corrosion as measured by weight changes.
Microscopic examination of prepared
specimens revealed occasional shallow
pitting which may have been due to
local impurities. In a similar test
using liquid sodium metal instead of
the fluoride fuel mixture, the platinum
metal was completely consumed. These
test data will be reported in detail
later. At this time it appears that
pure platinum will prove satisfactory
although perhaps nickel plating of the
material will be desirable. The brazed
joints must certainly be kept well
above the liquid level.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Platinum specimens exposed in
inconel capsules in a manner such that
the metals were in contact under the
melt level showed similar and some-
what more severe pitting; pretreated
fuels caused 2 slight deposit to form
on the platinum. This deposit has
been tentatively identified as nickel
perhaps electrochemically transferred
from the inconel walls. Platinum
wires suspended so that they were in
direct electrical contact with the
inconel capsule above the melt only
and were partially immersed in the
fuel mixture showed only minor pitting
when examined by metallographic tech-
niques. The wires seemed stiffened
and slightly roughened and may possibly
have had some deposited nickel. This
type of construction, which approxi-
mates that proposed for the special
fuel tubes, will probably prove
satisfactory.

Brazed joints of platinum and in-
conel, prepared with pure silver,
copper, and nicrobraz, were shown to
be completely unsatisfactory when
immersed in the fuel mixture in an
inconel capsule. Both the platinum
and the inconel were seriously attacked;
the platinum virtually disappeared from
the nicrobrazed samples. Chemical
analysis, however, revealed no dis-
solved platinum in any of the fluoride
melts. It appears that the attack on
the welded platinum must have resulted
in finely divided dispersed metal or
electrodeposited platinum, Tt will
probably be necessary to design the
special tubes so that the inconel tube
extends beyond the active lattice and
through the coolant header, with the
brazed joint, therefore, outside
core and well above the coolant
fuel levels.

STATIC CORROSION BY MODERATOR COOLANTS

N. V. Smith J. A. Griffin
Materials Chemistry Division
A. D. Brasunas L. A. Abrams

E. E. Hoffman

Metallurgy Division

Virtually all the work on moderator
coolants has been confined to studies
of corrosion by alkali and alkaline
earth hydroxides. These materials

have been studied under various con-

ditions in copper, monel, nickel,
inconel, and stainless steel Nos. 316,
321, and 347. Thus far corrosion by

sodium hydroxide has been examined at
some length, Preliminary data on
corrosion by potassium hydroxide,
barium hydroxide, strontium hydroxide,
and lithium hydroxide are also pre-
sented.

The corrosion data have all been
obtained in 100-hr tests at 800, 815,
or 1000°C. In general, the corrosion
by hydroxides is more severe than that
by the fluoride fuels. Sodium hy-
droxide, in particular, is about the
most corrosive of the hydroxides
studied; the surface penetration of
inconel and several stainless steels
varies from 7 to 16 mils. Only nickel,
monel, and copper of the metals tested
with sodium hydroxide show better (no
evidence of attack) corrosion resis-
tance. Each of these metals, however,
is subject to mass transfer. Cor-
rosion by potassium hydroxides is
severe ~ around 6 to 7 mils — but not
nearly sosevere as by sodium hydroxide.
The attacks by strontium and barium
hydroxide are of about the same order

of severity, i.e., 5 to 7 mils.

 
 

FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

To date the commercial grade and
the dehydrated commercial grade hy-
droxides have been used in most of
these experiments, and further re-
duction in corrosion rates may be
expected as purer quality hydroxides
become available, Weight changes of a
metal corrosion specimen in pure
(99.8%) sodium hydroxide was less by a
factor of 3 to 4 than those obtained
with commercial grade.

Capsule Technique with Hydrexides.
The capsule technique used so success-
fully in fuel and coolant testing has
required considerable modification for
this study. Most of the molten hy-
droxides, regardless of state of purity,
tend to crawl on the capsule surfaces
and make welding of the closed capsule
virtually impossible. Tt has been
necessary to add the powdered hy-
droxide in a manner such as to avoid
contact with the upper portion of the
wall and to seal the capsule without
melting of the material or to use a
double-capsule technique im which the
inner or test capsule is unsealed.
Neither of these techniques is com-
pletely satisfactory and a better
method is needed.

Corrosion by Sodium Hydroxide.
Commercial sodium hydroxide attacks
stainless steels and inconel strongly.
Monel, copper, and nickel are much
more resistant; nickel slugs exposed
to the alkali resemble electropolished
specimens. The corrosion problem with
these metals is, however, complicated
by the phenomenon of mass transfer for
which the mechanism is still in doubt.

The corrosion tests made with sodium
hydroxide using inconel and stainless
steel specimens and container tubes
gave evidence of appreciable inter-
action. Photomicrographs of inconel

 

and 316 stainless steel specimens
exposed for 100 hr at 800°C to de-
hydrated commercial sodium hydroxide
are shown in Figs. 10.8 and 10.9,
respectively. These should be compared
with Figs. 10.4 and 10.6. A very
heavy oxide layer which contains some
metallic particles is formed on the
exposed surfaces. Purified sodium
hydroxide containing less than 0.15%
each of water and Na,CO; shows asimilar
but considerably less marked behavior
with stainless steel and inconel.
Weight changes observed on the metal
specimens in pure sodium hydroxide ‘are
less by a factor of 3 or 4 than those
obtained in similar tests with com-
mercial material,

A photomicrograph of a nickel speci-
men exposed to sodium hydroxide is
shown in Fig. 10,10. There is no
evidence of a corrosion reaction,
although some metal loss due to solution
may have occurred. The possible
solution-deposition phenomenon
commonly referred to as "mass trans-
fer," remains the major deterrent to
the use of nickel as a hydroxide
container. An intensive study of this
phenomenon has been started, and
apparatus is being constructed to
study solution deposition in a thermal
gradient under static and dynamic
conditions.

Corrosion by Potassium Hydroxide.
Potassium hydroxide tested only as the
dehydrated commercial product also
tends toattack the chromium im inconel
and stainless steel. Typical photo-
micrographs of such tests with inconel
and 316 stainless steel as shown in
Figs. 10.11 and 10.12 indicate that
the corrosion 1s very severe but is
not so violent as for NaOH. Nickel,
monel, and copper containers are also
attacked less severely, It seems

Corrosion by Other Hydroxides.
Corrosive attack by strontium and
barium hydroxides appears to be less
severe than the attack obtained in
tests with sodium hydroxide. Nickel
and copper appear moderately resistant
while inconel and stainless steel are
strongly attacked. Figure 10.13
1llustrates the attack on inconel
obtained in 100 hr at 1500°F with
strontium hydroxide. This should be
compared to the sodium hydroxide attack
on inconel shown in Fig. 10.8. The
attack by strontium hydroxide on iron
and on 318 stainless steel at 1500°F
in 100 hr is illustrated in Figs. 10.14
and 10.15, respectively. The oxide
layer formed is quite heavy, especially
in the case of iron in which several
oxide layers (probably FeO and Fe, 0,)
are evident, The eutectic mixture of
strontium and barium hydroxide did not
differ appreciably from the con-
stituent hydroxides. It should be
noted that the dehydrated commercial
materials have been used in these tests.
It is possible that the pure materials
will be less corrosive.

Lithium hydroxide tested as the
relatively pure dehydrated commercial
material seems to resemble sodium
hydroxide in its corrosive charac-
teristics. A thick layer of corrosion
product is formed on inconel and stain-
less steel; copper and nickel are
reasonably resistant,

Corrosion by Binary Hydrogenous
Systems. A few static corrosion
experiments have been made in which

varying amounts of NaH, Na, and H,0
have been mixed with NaOH. Corrosion
experiments with these mixtures on 316
stainless steel and inconel for 100 hr
at 815°C are summarized in Table 10.2.
No significant decrease in the cor-
rosion of NaOH was observed.

parent metal of the container, in many
cases in a very uniform manner, and
redeposited on certain areas of the
container or in discrete particles in
the liquid 1s referred to as "mass
transfer.” It 1s not certain at
present whether the phenomenon is shown
by all the other hydroxides or whether
metals other than nickel and copper
exhibit the phenomenon. There is also
some question as to whether 1t occurs
in completely isothermal systems.

Mass transfer may be explained in
nonisothermal systems by assuming a
high thermal coefficient of solubility
of nickel in the fused alkali. Such
an explanation is acceptable in the
case of mass transfer in liquid metals,
but true solution of unreacted nickel
in fused alkali 1s somewhat harder to
accept. If the transfer can be shown
completely isothermal
then another explanation is

to occur in
systems,
patently required.

Chemical-Reaction Mechanism for
Mass Transfer. It is possible that
the mechanism of mass transfer can be
explained on the basis of chemical
reactions. For purposes of this dis-
cussion nickel 1s used as the example.
Other metals might, obviously, be
chosen,

The first step in the reaction chain
may be either

Ni + Na,0 -—> NiO + 2Na + H,
or
2Ni1i + 2NaOH —> 2Ni0O + 2Na +H,

actions is found in the work of Villard

cooled end of the tube, the products
depending on the conditions. Thus

the second reaction shown should in-
clude the ‘possibility that the actual
product is NaH, This work demonstrates
that, although the free energy change
is unfavorable to the reactions,
reaction does occur so that, if a
further process displaced the equi-
librium, continued attack on the meval
might take place.

The further reaction may be the

disproportionation reaction
2Ni0 = Ni + NiO,

Under the more common conditions of
agueous solution and strong acids, the
equilibrium in this type of reaction
is far to the left. Jt is considered
possible that, in the extreme con-
ditions of high temperature and very
strongly basic solvent, the equi-
librium is shifted to the right. Such
reversals of equilibrium with a change
in conditions are well known in organic
reactions. The scanty information now
available on reactions in fused sodium
hydroxide does not forbid the theory
for this unexplored medium.

Further reactions are certainly
possible:

NiO, + 2NaOH = Na,Ni10; + H,0

NiQ, + 2Na = NiO + Na ,O

The water produced in the first of
these possibilities would react with

hydroxide for further corrosion, while
the Na,0 produced in the second would
be immediately available for reaction
with more nickel.

Thermodynamically the total process
is only the transfer of nickel from
impure wall metal to very pure nickel
found in the deposit; such a process
operates with a decrease of free energy
even at a constant temperature. If the
temperature varies from place to place
or from time to time, the differing
temperature coefficients of the several
reactions might operate in such a way
as to increase the rate of the process.

Experimental Evidence. One factor
worthy of note is the experimental
observation that NiO remains inert at
the bottom of a platinum crucible under
fused NaOH at 350°C, but at 750°C it
is either suspended or more probably
dissolved in the melt. If a melt of
sodium hydroxide in platinum is treated

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

DYNAMIC CORROSION TESTS IN
THERMAL -CONVECTION LOOPS

E. M. Lees, ANP Division
J. L. Gregg, Consultant, ANP Division
R. B. Day, Metallurgy Division

During the period June 1 to August
31, 1951, the ANP Experimental Engi-
neering Group has continued testing
dynamic corrosion of liquid metals
on various materials in conjunction
with the Metallurgy Division, Tests
of this nature conducted in thermal-
convection loops afford a practical
means of evaluating the usefulness of
certain materials with liquid metals
or other circulating coolant, supply
fundamental information on the suita-
bility of fabricating techniques,
afford opportunities to test certain
instruments under development, and
provide experience from which adequate
techniques for operating larger scale
dynamic systems may be formulated.

Metallographic examination of six
lead-containing and three lithium-
containing loops operated during the
preceding quarter(5’ have been com-
pleted. Operation of all but one of
these loops was prematurely (before
1000 hr) terminated, and all but one
of these failures was due to internal
obstruction in the cold zone of the
loops. In general, the corrosive
attack of both lead and lithium on the
variety of steels and alloys tested
is most severe in the hot zone of the
loop with some attack usually apparent
in the cold zone. The solid particles
released to the circulating lead and
lithium streams are apparently "trapped"
in the cold lead, accumulate, and
eventually plug the loop.

ANP-65, op. cit,, p. 150.

During the past quarter, primarily
sodium was tested in the thermal-
convection loops. In no case was
there a failure with a sodium-con-
taining convection loop in which the
failure was due to sodium corrosion.
The successful operation of loops with
sodium at 1500°F and preliminary re-
ports of metallographic examination on
loops sectioned after 1000 hr of
operation indicate quite strongly that
inconel and types 310 and 316 stain-
less steel suffer very little cor-
rosion by slowly flowing sodium at
temperatures up to 1500°F. The
successful operation of a 310 stainless
steel loop fabricated from %-in.-o.d.
tubing with a wall thickness of only
0.020 in. may be cited to indicate the
relative inertness of stainless steel
to sodium at 1500°F,

Corrosion by Lithium and Lead. A
number of thermal-convection loops
which were operated with lead and
lithium were examined after failure.
The hot-leg temperature was approxi-
mately 1500°F, although much higher
temperatures were obtained momentarily
when internal plugging obstructed the
natural convective flow. Failure
occasionally occurred at these higher
temperatures, not from internal cor-
rosion by the molten metal but rather
from external causes, such as arcing
or high-temperature air oxidation. As
flow restriction, due to corrosion,
was quite frequent with both lead and
lithium, so were the intervals of
excessive temperature, and this
probably contributed appreciably to the
failure rate with these loops.

The life of the various loops tested
with lithium and lead, the compositions
of the loops, and metallographic notes
are given in Tables 10.3 and 10.4,
respectively. The metallographic

notes were made after examination of
random samples of the hot leg,
leg, and welded sections. The
of corrosion was dependent upon the
materials involved, the temperature,
and the time of interaction. It should
be kept in mind that the temperature
was not actually controlled but merely
attained: by initially selecting a
certain power input to obtain approxi-
mately 1500°F at the beginning of the
test, when convective flow was un-
obstructed, When partial or complete
plugging developed as a result of
metal crystal formation in the cold
leg, as shown in Fig. 10.19, heat
losses were reduced and the hot-leg
temperature was increased. This was
corrected manually and the test was

in Fig. 10.20,

appreciable, there is a general mis-
conception that attack in the cold
zone is negligible or

crystals need not necessarily be
bonded directly to the tube walls but
may merely be trapped there. The
oxide layer shown in Fig. 10.23
separates the metal crystals from the
loop material, making bonding im-
possible.

An attempt was made to determine
the composition of the metal crystals
by quantitative analysis. Neglecting
lead, the following elements were
detected:

In the cold zone of a 316 stainless
steel (18% Cr, 10% Ni, 3% Mo) loop
after 138 hr of operation: 67% Fe,
6% Cr, 24% Ni, 3% Mo.

In the cold zone of a 446 stainless
steel (26% Cr) loop after 62 hr
operation: 63% Fe, 37% Cr.

The composition varied somewhat and
these values are averages of analyses
made in different areas of the cold
zones.

Corrosion by Sodium. Materials
tested with sodium during the quarter
included inconel and types 310, 316,
and 347 stainless steel. Eighteen
loops were taken out of service, 14
of which completed the scheduled 1000-
hr tests with sodium at 1500°F, Three
stainless steel (two 347, one 310)
Y4~-in. thin-walled tubing loops failed
after less than 150 br of operation
owing to leaks in the welds, and one
inconel loop failed after 350 hr owing
to a plugged gas line in the liquid
level control system; thus none of
these failures are directly attributa-
ble to the use of sodium. Included in
the 14 loops completing 1000-hr tests
was one 310 stainless steel thin-

 

1951

walled loop. On the three loops
operating with sodium at the end of
the period, one inconel loop was
operated at 1600°F, and one each of
inconel and 316 stainless steel at
1500°F. The increase in successful
runs over the preceding quarter is due
largely to (1) improved methods for
purifying and introducing liquid metals
into the systems (2) improved methods
for degreasing, cleaning, and fabri-
cation, and (3) improved methods for
heating and temperature control.

The sodium-containing loops are now
being examined. Preliminary metal-
lographic examination of some of these
loops indicates very little corrosion,
Small test specimens of similar and
dissimilar composition were suspended
in the hot and cold legs of these loops.
Examination of these specimens has
indicated that although weight changes
are small, the hot-zone specimens lost
weight but the cold-zone specimens
gained weight.

Tt is’ believed that little can be
learned by operating additional thermal
loops with sodium except for the pur-
pose of testing a particular joint or
component. Although it hasbeen proved
that thermal-convection loops can be
operated: without plugging and without
appreciable attack of the loop material
by sodium, it remains to be proved
that a forced-convection loop can be
operated with sodium in one section at
1500°F and 1000 to 1200°F in another
section without plugging. Therefore
future tests in figure-eight forced-
convection loops will determine whether
there will be sufficient attack on
inconel or stainless steel to result
in plugging in addition to testing
simulated components or flow channels.

after 7 hr of operation by failure of
the pump shaft seal. The seal was
repaired, but during the following
start-up period external arcing from
electrical heaters burned a hole in
the main heater section of the loop.
The damage caused by the resulting
fire was sufficient to require com-

insufficient to test revised cleaning
procedures which included repeated
flushing with hot sodium until the

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES AND HEAT-TRANSFER RESEARCH

H. F. Poppendiek, Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The influence of the free-convection
mechanism within liquid-fuel elements
upon the fuel temperature structure 1s
being investigated both experimentally
and theoretically. Mock-up systems
which simulate the actual fuel-element
systems have been studied. Volume
heat sources were produced by means of
resistance heating, and temperatures
were measured with thermocouples. An
apparatus has been built which will be
used to study the velocities of the
free-convection cells. A theoretical
analysis of the free-convection heat
transfer existing in the fuel element
has been completed for the laminar
flow case; the turbulent flow analysis
is currently being completed. These
solutions are to be used to predict
temperature distributions in liguid-
fuel-element systems.

Five Bunsen ice calorimeters for
the measurement of heat capacity are
now in operation. Experimental work
and analyses have been completed for
316 stainless steel, synthetic sapphire,
lithium, molybdenum, and zirconium in

the range 300 to 1000°C.

An improved thermal-conductivity

for liguids has been constructed. A

apparatus for the determination of
thermal conductivity of solids is in
operation and additional conductivity
measurements on various densities of
boron carbide have been obtained. The
radial -flow apparatus has been com-
pleted.

Two pieces of equipment have now
been constructed for the measurement
of liquid densities. The density of
the NaF-KF-UF, eutectic has been
determined in the range 535 to 1000°C.
The apparatus for the measurement of
viscosities is scheduled for com-
pletion by September. Work has been
retarded by delays in fabrication of
parts.

An apparatus which will be used to
determine the heat-transfer coef-
ficients of fused hydroxides and salts
has been nearly completed. These
fluids are potential reactor coolants.
Some preliminary heat-transfer data
for a boiling-mercury system have been
determined and the figure-eight lithium
system has yielded some data.

laminar flow between two parallel and
infinitely long plane bounding sur-
faces. In the system it was postulated
that heat was generated uniformly and
that the long convection cells were in
the laminar flow regime. A report
based on this analysis 1s being pre-
pared. A similar analysis will be
made for a system in turbulent flow.
These solutions will also be duplicated
for cylindrical coordinate systems.
The solution indicates that, for a
system in which the distance between
the parallel plates is 0.18 in., the
axial temperature gradient is 100°F/ft
and the physical properties are identi-
cal to the measured values for the
NaF -KF-UF, eutectic; the temperature
difference which would exist if all
the heat were transferred by con-
duction is reduced by 25.5%. This
result is based on a value of 1 centi-
poise for the dynamic viscosity.
If the viscosity is greater than 1
centipoise, the reduction in tem-
perature difference will be smaller

than 25.5%.

Measurement of the Fuel-Element
Temperature Distribution (F. E. Lynch

Ice 1s melted in the lucite shell and,
by noting the change in volume in the

prevent heat from getting into the
system from any source other than the
sample, the lucite shell was surrounded
by ice. However, impurities in the
surrounding ice lowered 1ts melting
point enough to cause noticeable
freezing of the water in the lucite
shell. The lucite shell was therefore
surrounded by 2 in, of 5:11-0-Cel
insulation contained in a steel shell,
The steel shell was kept at 0°C by
surrounding it by ice. The heat
leakage into the lucite shell was
small,

An appreciable error can occur in
the measurement of the actual tempera-
ture of the sample. At high tempera-
tures, variations of 5 to 10°C have
been found on the surface of capsules
placed in the most uniform tempera-
ture position in the furnace. It is
felt that tube furnaces longer than
those now in use will reduce this
error. Manufacturers are being con-

Thermal Conductivity of Liquids
(M. Tobias, A. BR, Frithsen, and L.
Basel, Reactor Experimental Engineering
Division). The thermal conductivity
of the fused salt NaF-XKF-UF, (com-
position 46.5, 26, and 27.5 mole %,
respectively) has been measured using
the ORNL Deem type apparatus,(!) The
average conductivity of four measure-
ments was 0.53 Btu/hr' fr+°F at temper-
atures ranging from 643 to 700°C.
These data were urgently needed and
no check runs were made with sodium.
As several imperfections in the design
of the apparatus have become apparent,
measurements with this apparatus have
been discontinued.

A new apparatus, the ORNL Deem type
No. 2, which has a bellows seal instead
of the Pb-Bi seal used in apparatus
No, 1, is now approximately 95% com-
plete and is scheduled for operation
in September. A few check runs will
be made on lead, after which data will
be obtained on BeF, -NaF-K¥F salt
mixtures. A hood is being installed
over the apparatus to protect operators
from escaping BeF, vapor.

The construction of the apparatus for

Operation of the system is anticipated
sometime within the next month. The

Heat Transfer in Boilimg-Liquid-
Metal Systems (WW, S. Farmer, Reactor
Experimental Engineering Division).
The boiling-heat-transfer investi-
gations have been continued during
this period on the boiling-mercury
experiment using a flat plate and on
the boiling-sodium and -potassium
experiments using a horizontal tube,

Preliminary results only were
obtained for the boiling-mercury
experiment owing to condenser failure
in the high-frequency induction heater
employed as a heat source. However,
using pure mercury, temperature dif-
ferences of approximately 100°F were
observed between the metal surface
and the boiling fluid for a heat flow
rate of about 50,000 Btu/hr ft2. The
large temperature difference observed
in this case was probably due to non-
wetting of the heat-transfer surface
by the boiling mercury. In addition,
considerable temperature fluctuations
were observed in the boiling liguid,
accompanied by bumping. The apparatus
has been moved to a new location to
utilize another induction heater, and
further results will be forthcoming.

Heat Transfer im Molten Lithium
(C. P. Coughlen and H. C. Claiborne,
Reactor Experimental Engineering
Division). During the past quarter
the figure-eight lithium system was
placed in operation, and preliminary
heat-transfer data were obtained. To
remedy pump and instrumentation dif-
ficulties which were encountered during
operations, extensive alterations have
been made and a new Einstein-Szilard
pump has been obtained on loan from
Allis-Chalmers Manufacturing Company.
The new pump will permit operation
over a much larger range of velocities
in the test heat exchanger.

The experimental results obtained
with a concentric-pipe heat exchanger
are preliminary because of the im-
perfect operation of the auxiliary
squipment which prevented the attain-
ment of complete equilibrium and
because of the low flow rates obtainable
(1140 to 1600 lb/hr in the annulus and
980 to 1150 lb/hr in the core pipe).

1951

Separation of the individual heat-
transfer coefficients was not possible
under these conditions.

efficients determined experimentally
ranged from 4100 to 5160 Btu/hr-ft?-°F,
Heat balances checked to within 24%

A comparison of the Nusselt modulus
computed from the experimental data

to 80% higher than those found by
Isakoff and Drew when using mercury
for an L/D = 58. Since L/D = 30 for
the lithium heat exchanger, the
Nusselt moduli are expected to be
somewhat higher than those for a

The bulki of work to date has been
confined ze basic evaluation of the
guality of ainconel tube-to-header
welded joints described 1m the last
report, (?) A limited amount of fahri-
cation of typical tube-to-header
assemblies has been undertaken, Tensile
tests have shown that tube-te-header
welds can be made which compare favors
ably in both strength and ductility to
the parent inconel tubing. Fatigue
tests of welded joints exhibit astrong
dependency on the degree of penetration
of the weld, 2 condition not evident

arc-welded inconel tube-~to-header
pairs were tested in liquid sodium at
1000°C for 100 hr to determine the
effect on the room-temperature tensile
strength. The only effect nbsarved
was a slight lowering of the tensile

trength and an appreciable increase
in elongation due to annealing.

Tensile Tests. The results of
room-temperature tests of inconel
tube-to-header tensile pairs made
using manual-inert-arc, cone-arc, and

and smaller tubing are attempted.

Strength values for joints brazed
with nicrobraz in preliminary experi-
ments are included in Table 12.1. The
lower tensile strength and somewhat
higher elongation of these specimens
may be attributed to the annealing
received in the brazing operation.
Brazing of basic joints for evaluation
and comparison with welded joints will
receive major consideration in future
work,

Fatigue Tests. In order to evaluate
further the guality of tube-to-header
joints, a rotating tubular beam fatigue
test was developed. The header plate
is immovably clamped with the tube
extending into a rotating eccentric
cam. The test is effectively torsion-
less since the eccentric cam, within
which the tube end rides, is equipped
with roller bearings. Specimens were
5.8 in, long and were rotated at 1125
rpm at a pre-set deflection.

A limited number of data are pre-
sented as an S-N scatter band curve in

1951

Fig, 12.1. Further tests are necessary
for conclusive evaluation. It may be
noted, however, that welds incorpo-
rating complete penetration, whether
manual inert arc, cone arc, or brazed,
exhibited superior fatigue life to
those joints with partial penetration.
This condition was not evident on ex-
amination of tensile data, The lower
fatigue life of these welds may, be
attributed to the lack of penetration,
and, as a result, the presence of a
"notch." The evaluation of fatigue,

All -Weld-Metal Tensile Tests. The
properties of weld deposits in inconel
plate are of interest since the ARE
reactor shell and other components
will be fabricated from thick plate.
A limited number of tests have been
conducted using %-in. inconel plate
and various filler metals to provide
all-weld metal 0,357-1in. tensile
specimens, The remaining weld deposits
were reserved for quantitative analysis
and static corrosion tests in liquid
sodium and a fluoride fuel mixture.

The results of room-temperature
tensile tests are presented in Table
12.2. Tt may be noted that the physi-
cal properties of the inert-arc and
metal-arc weld metal were comparable
with one exception. The weld deposit
of the Inco No, 42 welding rod was
definitely inferior. This rod was
designed for oxyacetylene welding;
however, chemical analysis being con-
ducted may explain these relatively
inferior physical properties.

Inspection of welds of the tube-to-
header type involving a relatively
intricate geometry and numerous small

components is difficult.

is expected that the use of Dy-Chek

in detecting major flaws. This pro-

Corrosion of Welds. The effect of

stainless steel (0.500- by 0.065-1in.
reduced section) have been loaded to
3000, 4000, 6000, 7000, and 8000 ps1
at 815°C in an argon atmosphere. There
is considerable scatter of the results,
and this work is being repeated with
closer attention to details. The
scatter probably reflects the struc-
tural instability of the stainless
steel.

Creep of Inconel, Sheet specimens
of inconel in the as-received temper
(0.500- by 0.065-in. reduced section)
have been loaded to 3000, 5000, 6000,
and 8000 psi at 815°C in an argon
atmosphere. Duplicate tests check
very well, and the results are close
to the published data. Also, speci-
mens were heated to 1120°C in vacuum
for 2 hr and air-cooled; the treatment
increased the grain size by a factor
of about 16. Following this anneal,
specimens were loaded to 5000 and 8000
psi. At B0O0O psi there was close
agreement between duplicate tests, but
the rupture life was much shorter than

the 5000-ps1
vs. time curves for the coarse- and
fine-grained materials were nearly
identical. loadings of coarse- and
fine-grained material will be made at

3000 psi; it is expected that the

coarser grained material will have a
considerably longer rupture life at
this and lower stress levels.

Severe intergranular cracking has
been observed on the inceonel sheet
specimens. These cracks appear to
originate at the edge. To see if this
is truly an edge effect, one inconel
0.505-in. bar specimen has been loaded
to 3000 psi. Unless the same type of
cracks develops on the round bar, it
can be assumed that this type of crack-
ing is an edge phenomenon and need be
considered only in the rare case 1in
which exposed and stressed edges occur.

Creep of Niobium. Two niobium
specimens were loaded to rupture at
815°C in argon. Rupture occurred at
26,000 psi with about 20% elongation.
One specimen loaded to 6000 psi has
been in test for 650 hr with a negli-
gible elongation. Work on niobium has
been temporarily suspended pending
delivery of additional sheet stock.

Creep Test of Loaded Inconel Taube,
A study is being made of the effects
of multicomponent stress systems on
creep. An inconel tube % in. in o.d.
with the wall thickness reduced to
0.010 in. for a length of 34% in. was
sealed at one end and loaded to 66.6
psi internal pressure with argon. The
tube was heated to 1800°F, and the
pressure was maintained until the tube
ruptured, the failure being longi-
tudinal. This loading gave the follow-
ing stresses:

Tangential 1500 psi (tension)

I.ongitudinal 750 psi (tension)

Radial 35 psi (compression)
 

FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

Rupture occurred in approximately
400 hr with the following deformations:

Length 0.8% increase

Circumference 2.8% increase

Internal cross-

sectional area 5.7% increase

Volume 6.5% increase

A similar sheet specimen loaded in
tension to 1500 psi at 1800°F ruptured
in 200 hr with about 6% elongation.

Fight simulated stress-relaxation
tests for type 316 stainless steel
were conducted at stress levels of
5000, 10,000, and 20,000 psi using the
Baldwin creep-rupture machine, All
tests were made at a temperature of
1500°F. After 16 hr the stress was
about 4600 to 4800 psi regardless of
the initial stress level. Stress-
relaxation curves are also to be
obtained for inconel and nickel A.

FUEL-ELEMENT FABRICATION

G. M. Adamson E. S, Bomar
J. H. Coobs

Metallurgy Division

The work on fabrication of solid
fuel elements has progressed along the

 

lines discussed in the last report, (1!)
An additional fabrication technique,
rubberstatic pressing, is now also be-
ing investigated. With all fabri-
cation techniques the use of a screened
fraction of sintered UO, seems to be
desirable.

Hot Rolling. After a plate has
been fabricated by hot-relling it is
desirable that it be drawn to final
size. Since a suitable drawbench is
not available, cold-rolling was sub-
stituted, A set of plates was fabri-
cated by the procedure outlined in
ORNL -987. They were hot-rolled at
1100°C €o a reduction of 75%, Six
plates, each containing 30% vo, , were
made; three had matrices of iron and
three of 302 stainless steel. Plates
from each set were then given additional
cold reductions of 10, 25, and 50% by
hand-rolling. The plates with iron
rolled very well, showing
only minor evidence of segregation
of the UO,. However, the units with
matrices of stainless steel suffered
considerable segregation and striation
of the UO,. In neither case was the
bond between the core and cladding
material altered. Figures 12.2 and
and 12.3 are representative of this
work.

matrices

To determine the effect of using
coarse UO, in the fabrication of cores
a high-temperature induction furnace
was assembled. A total of 330 g of a
special high-purity U0, was sintered
at 2100°C in a hydrogen atmosphere.
The average weight change amounted to
a loss of 0.5%. After being sintered
the coarse fragments of UO, were
uniformly gray in color and quite hard.
The apparent density had been increased
by a factor of 3. The sintered product
was then ground and divided
various size ranges by screening.

FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

The -100, +200 mesh size fraction
of the UO, was mixed in two batches
with -100 and -325 mesh 302 stainless
steel. Compacts were prepared in the
usual manner and rolled at 1120°C to
reductions of 50, 75, and 90%. Me-
tallographic examination indicated
segregation of the coarse UO, (Fig.
12.4a) to be less sensitive to the
particle size of the matrix stainless
steel powder than is normal UO,
(Fig. 12.4b). However, a tendency to
agglomerate into localized groups for
reductions greater than 75% was noted.
There was also some evidence of the
U0, particles penetrating into the
cladding layers.

To conserve on stainless steel an
attempt was made to use mild steel
tubing instead of stainless as the
protective covering. The samples
were rolled at 1100°C; however, they
were heavily oxidized before receiving
the first pass through the mill. On
metallographic examination it was
evident that the oxidizing conditions
had penetrated to the compact and had
prevented adequate bonding. Further
tests will be made, and it is hoped
that a satisfactory atmosphere may be
obtained by changing tle adjustment on
the gas dissociator.

Mechanically Formed Matrix. The
work in the X-10 Shops on developing
a method for punching molybdenum
plates and obtaining a high percentage
of open area, has been held up waiting
the delivery of carbide punches. Qther
methods of forming a suitable mechani-
cal matrix are being placed on an in-
active basis until the accompanying
bonding problems have been solved. A
low-temperature induction furnace iis
being assembled for these solid-phase
bonding studies. Bonding will be
tried both with and without load. The

 

furnace is nearly completed and 1s
expected to be placed in operation. as
soon as the induction furnaces are

ready.

Loose-Powder Sintering. Work on the
sintering of loose powders is
being carried out in our own furnaces.
The first rum was to be one of a series

now

to determine optimum sintering temper-~
ature and was to be run at 1250°C.
Instead of the intended as-received
Uuo,, a size fraction (-100, +325 mesh)
of the high-density sintered U0, was
used by mistake. With 30% coarse UO,
in 320 stainless steel a fair bond was
found at 1250°C., ‘Increasing the
temperature to 1280°C did not give a
definite improvement in the bond.
Another sample using regular U0, was
prepared and sintered as above; how-
ever, very little bond was obtained,

Rubberstatic Pressing. Rubberstatic
pressing has been used during this
quarter as an additional fabrication
technique. A drawing (Fig. 12.5)
shows how this procedure may be used
to press a powder layer onto the inner
surface of a tube. Pressure applied
to the steel punches is transmitted
through the rubber ‘and presses the
powder tightly onto the inner side of
the tube. This is followed by a
sintering operation. This technique
is being used as a fabrication method
on both solid fuel elements and con-
trol rods.

Tu the first specimen tried in: the
fuel-element work the lower half of
the powder layer was 302 stainless
steel, and the upper half was electro-
lytic iron. After being pressed under
40 tsi and sintered at 1250°C, the
stainless steel was well bonded
but the iron had pulled away during
sintering, A series of samples was

high-density coarse UO, with various
particle sizes in -325 mesh 320 stain-
less steel matrices, All the compacts
were pressed at 30 tsi and sintered at
1250°C. The sample with -325 mesh UO,
was not bonded, while another with
-200, +325 mesh UO, was bonded only

superficially. However, two samples
using -100, +200 mesh and -60, +100
mesh UO, were well bonded.

Compatibility of Potential Fuel-
Element Materials. To determine the

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

compatibility of U0,-iron or UO, —302
stainless steel cores in contact with
316 stainless steel, cladding sections
of hot-rolled plates were sealed in
evacuated tubes. The tube and its
contents were held at 1000°C for
100 hr. Metallographic examination
disclosed a diffusion layer of less
than 0.001 in. between the iron cores
and the 316 cladding and none between
the 316 cladding and the 302 cores.
Both of these results were in agree-
ment with earlier tests,

CONTROL-ROD FABRICATION

G. M. Adamson E. S. Bomar
- J. H. Coobs

Metallurgy Division

This group 1s now starting work on
the fabrication of control rods for
the ARE. While hot-rolling and rubber-
static pressing are both being in-
vestigated as possible fabrication
procedures, the most likely method, at
present, seems to be a simple canning
of powders. Materials now being in-
vestigated as possible control ma-
terials are B,C and HfO,, but the
investigation is being expanded to
include development of refractory
boron, hafnium, or cadmium compounds.

As a preliminary investigation ZrQO,
was used as a substitute for HfO,, and
some plates were prepared with the
standard hot-rolling technique. While
these two compounds are similar chemi-
cally, there is a considerable differ-
ence in their density; however, it is
not likely to affect this preliminary
work. Cores with 30% by volume of
Zr0, innickel, iron, and 302 stainless
steel were fabricated. They were clad
with nickel or 316 stainless steel by
hot-rolling at 1100°C. Table 12.3 is
a summary of the results of this in-
vestigation.

The ceramics laboratory located at
Y-12 has been established as part of
the Metallurgy Division. The group
will consist of nine men under the
direction of Dr. John M. Warde. The
 

FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

work of the laboratory is te be of
three types, namely, basic or long-
term ceramic research, engineering
development, and service research for
other divisions of Oak Ridge National
Laboratory. A considerable amount
of equipment has been received, and it
is expected that a large part of the

laboratory will be in operation by
October 1.

Work has already been started on
ceramic fuel elements, and the first
to be studied are alumina~—uranium
oxide compositions. Some work has

 

also been done on the use of hot-
pressed beryllia for valve parts to
handle liquid sodium, as it has been
found that beryllia hot-pressed at
Argonne National Laboratory was re-
sis tent to sodium at 1500°F.

The Metallurgy Division has a work-
ing agreement with the Electrotechnical
Laboratory of the Bureau of Mines,
Norris, Tennessee, whereby the latter
will fabricate crucibles and other small
refractory parts for ORNL and will
carry on some engineering development
projects in the nuclear energy field.

13. CHEMISTRY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIQUIDS

W. R. Grimes, Materials Chemistry Division

Research in the ANP Chemistry
Group has, as indicated by previous
reports in this series, been con-
cerned almost entirely in the past
with development of liquids for use
as aircraft reactor fuels. While
such studies still constitute an
appreciable fraction of this effort,
the program has been broadened in
recent months to include study of
nonmetallic liquids for use as
moderators and/or heat-transfer
fluids (coolants) for such a re-
actor. These researches have 1in-
cluded a small number of physical
property determinations, as well as
the phase-equilibrium and thermal-
stability studies necessary to
demonstrate the chemical properties
of the liquids.

Nine fluoride-fuel systems, both
ternary and quaternary, may be singled
out as covering a useful range of
uranium concentration (up to about
200 1b of uranium per cubic foot)
and with satisfactory melting points
(below 550°C). UF;, which might be
used as a fluoride-fuel component,
has been prepared with only 0.8 wt %
of impurities. In the development
of homogeneous reactor fuels, solu-
tions of UO; in NaOH-Na,B,0, show
promise, together with the NaOH-LiOH
system previously developed.

The moderator-coolant program
requires a stable (at 800°C) hy-
drogenous liquid with good heat-
transfer properties. While sodium
hydroxide, a satisfactory moderator,
is an acceptable heat-transfer
medium, the existence of a corrosion-

resistant container for this fluid
at this temperature has not been
demonstrated. For these studies
quantities of sodium hydroxide
assaying better than 99.8% NaOH by
weight are now routinely prepared.
In addition, potassium hydroxide,
barium hydroxide, strontium hydroxide,
lithium hydroxide, rubidium hydroxide,
and several binary hydrogenous
systems are being considered for this
application.

The development of nonmetallic
coolants has been largely confined
to consideration of non-uranium-
bearing fluoride systems 1n con-
junction with the fuel development
program. Eleven fluoride systems of
usable liquid range and low cor-
rosiveness are listed, although their
heat-transfer properties are not
sufficiently well known to permit
evaluation of their usefulness.

FUEL DEVELOPMENT

Research on liquid fuels 1s still
directed toward development of low-
melting solutions of UF, in alkali
and alkaline earth fluorides and
toward development of self-moderating
fuels, with the former program having
the major emphasis. Research on the
fluorides has progressed so that it
is possible to list nine liquid
systems, covering a wide range of
uranium concentrations, which have
satisfactory melting points. UF,,
which 1s a possible fuel component,
has beer prepared in batch samples
which assay 99.2% UF, by weight.
FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

Solutions of UO; ir NaOH-LiOH and in
NaOH-Na,B,0,both show some promise
as homogeneous reactor fuels.

Low-Melting Fluoride Systems
(J. P. Blakely, L. M. Bratcher, and
C. J. Barton, Materials Chemistry
Division; D. G. Hill, Consultant).
Phase equilibrium studies of systems
containing uranium tetrafluoride have
been continued by the technique of
thermal analysis previously de-
scribed. (!"3) Studies of the ternary
systems have been extended to include
four component systems in an effort
to define systems in which low-
melting regions were available in a
wide range of uranium concentrations.
The system NaF-KF-RbF-UF, 1s con-
sidered the most promising of the
four-component systems investigated
to date.

At present the nine systems listed
in Table 13.1 below are those of
definite promise as fuels. In ad-
dition, at least three systems con-
taining PbF, have been shown to have
suitable melting points at useful
uranium concentrations. [It is not
likely, however, that Pb¥F, can be
shown to be stable in contact with
structural metals. The recent success

investigation of systems containing
lithium fluoride. From an inspection
of Table 13.1 1t 1s apparent that
lithium fluoride would be a valuable
addition to the list of possible
fuel components. The most valuable
mixtures without LiF would seem to be
the first three listed in the table.

The various fuel systems studied
during the period are discussed
briefly under appropriate headings
below.

had indicated the existence of a
low-melting region in this ternary
diagram around 31 mole % UF, and
16 mole % NaF. Recent data have
permitted construction of the equi-
librium diagram, as shown in Fig. 13.1.
The low-melting region covers a wide
area on the diagram; two separate
eutectic points apparently exist
inside the 550°C contour.

KF-LiF-UF,. Substitution of KF
for NaF resulted in higher melting
points in nearly all parts of the

determinations of the purity of the

to the range 850 to 900°C in so far

these preliminary studies products
of varying purity were obtained for
study. Typical material from these
runs was shown to be a black material
of specific gravity 8.83 (X-ray
density 9.06) which was insoluble in
all except oxidizing solvents.
Chemical analysis showed the material
to be about 90 wt % UF,.

Experiments 1n cooperation with
personnel from the Mass Spectrometer
Group of the Stable Isotopes Division
showed that 10 to 12 wt % UF, was
left unreacted in the product. Itc

was shown that at 750°C UF, is stable
under 10°° mm Hg but that at 800°C
the disproportionation into UF, and
metallic uranium is significant; the
disproportionation rate increases
rapidly with temperature.

Since 31t appeared that low-tem-
perature reaction for prolonged
periods with proper precautions to
ensure homogeneity of the reaction
mass and to prevent build-up of re-
action products on unreacted UF,
offered the optimum conditions for
preparation of pure UF;, the following
procedure was adopted: Pure UF, was
vacuum~dried at 450°C for several
hours and ground te pass a 200-mesh
seive. This UF, was charged into a
10-in.~long by 3~in.~diameter stain-
less steel container with the stoi-
chiometric quantity of clean uranium
turnings and several stainless steel
balls. The reagents were again
vacuum-dried at 450°C for several
hours before reduction of the uranium
to powder by repeated formation and
decomposition of UH;. After final
decomposition of the hydride, the
container was evacuated and sealed.
The contents were homogenized by
grinding with the steel balls. The
reaction was allowed to proceed 16 hr
at 900°C, and, after cooling and
grinding of the contents, the sealed
container was maintained at 900°C an
additional 8 hr.

The product of this reaction has
been shown by chemical analysis to
be 99.2 wt % UF;. This material is
of sufficient purity for use in
phase equilibrium studies. It seems
likely that this material is of
considerably higher purity than any
which has previously been produced
elsewhere. A report on this research
will be 1ssued in the near future.

 

Homogeneous Fuels (J. D. Redman
and L. GG. Overholser, Materials
Chemistry Division). The high
solubility of uranium as UO; in
mixtures of sodium and lithium hy-
droxides has been discussed in a
previous report.¢’) This solution
might well be of interest as a
homogeneous fuel if separated lithium
isotopes were available and 1{f the
corrosive liguid could be contained.
A small amount of research has been
done to ascertain whether similar
solubility of uranium can be demon-~
strated with other hydroxide-bearing
materials.

The data in Table 13.2 indicate
that mixtures of barium hydroxide
with lithium or sodium hydroxide are
of little value in this connection.
It 1s established that, at moderately
high temperatures, the solubility of
uranium increases with temperature
and with increasing concentration of
lithium hydroxide; the solubility at
750°C, however, never reaches a value
high enough to be of interest as a
fuel.

MODERATOR-COOLANT DEVELOPMENT

To be effective as a modera-
tor—heat-transfer fluid for the
aircraft reactor the liquid must
obviously have good heat-transfer
properties, must be thermally stable
above 800°C, and must contain hy-
drogen. Hydrogen-bearing compounds

162

with the required thermal stability,
even without regard to probable
radiation stability, are not numerous.

Development of moderator coolants
1s concerned at present primarily
with preparation of very pure alkali
and alkaline earth hydroxides and
with phase equilibrium studies of
various mixtures of these materials
with other compounds. In so far as
liquid ranges, moderating power, and
heat-transfer properties are con-
cerned, several of the materials and
mixtures tested could be considered
satisfactory. In addition to the
pure hydroxides several bimary hy-
drogenous systems, such as hydroxide-
hydroxide, hydroxide-fluoride, and
hydroxide-borate, are being examined.

Preparation of sodium hydroxide
assaying better than 99.8% NaOH by
weight has been placed on a routine
basis. Pure potassium hydroxide has
not yet been prepared in quantity
although small-scale preparations
using recrystallization from isopropyl
alcohol have been accomplished. Pure
barium hydroxide, prepared by re-
crystallization from aqueous solution
followed by dehydration of the re-
sulting octahydrate, should soon be
available in sufficient quantity for
corrosion and physical property
testing. Methods for purification
of lithium and rubidium hydroxides
are still under study.

Obviously, the atmosphere in the

values show that there is virtually
no pickup of silica in the process
used. The yield per batch is ap-
proximately 65 g, and a total of about
5 lb of purified sodium hydroxide
has been prepared by this method.

The results of several runs in-
dicate that pure sodium hydroxide
may also be obtained by removal of
carbonate from a concentrated aqueous
solution of the hydroxide, followed
by dehydration at 450°C under vacuum.
For this method a 50 wt % solution of
sodium hydroxide is made up in a
wax-lined vessel, the suspended
sodium carbonate 1s removed by
filtration, and the clear filtrate
is dehydrated in a nickel vessel,
first at 200°C and finally at 450°C

under vacuum.

The results of the analysis of
sodium hydroxide purified by this
method are given in Table 13.5. A
comparison of these data with those
given previously indicates that the
hydroxide may be about as effectively
purified by this method as by the
ethyl alcohol process. This method
may be applied to quantity production
more easily than the ethyl alcohol
process.

this compound and of other alcohols is
underway.

Limited success

Equipment is being set up for the
purification of strontium and barium
hydroxides. The method used entails
separation of the insoluble carbonate
in aqueous solution, recrystallization
as the octahydrate, and finally de-
hydration under carefully controlled
conditions. The setup, which is
constructed of nickel, should permit
purification of pound batches of the
hydroxides.

Purified lithium hydroxide mono-
hydrate, available commercially, was
dehydrated at 200°C under vacuum.
The dehydrated material so obtained
contains approximately 0.1% lithium
carbonate and less than 0,1% water.
Rubidium hydroxide, reported to be
99.5% pure, was found to contain
approximately 5% carbonate and 15%
water. The dehydration of this
material is being investigated at
present.

Decomposition Pressures of Hy-~
droxides (E. O. Price, Besearch

 

Participant, Materials Chemistry
Division). Experimental work has
been confined to a study of the
decomposition pressures of barium
hydroxide hydrates and anhydrous
barium hydroxide. The existence of
the monohydrate and octahydrate has
been established by numerous ex-
perimenters, but there appears to be
some doubt regarding the existence of
the trihydrate. The decomposition
pressures for the following systems
have been reported: (?:19)

Ba(Ol) , “H,0(s) = Ba(OH),(s) + H,0(g)

Ba (OH) ," 8H,0(s) 2 Ba(OH), 1,005) + TH,0(g)

These references also include com-
parable data for the strontium hy-
droxide systems. It might be noted
that for anhydrous barium hydroxide
the decomposition pressure reaches
1 atm at about 1000°C and the cor-
responding temperature for anhydrous
strontium hydroxide 1s 700°C. The
hydrates exert too high pressures at
elevated temperatures to be of very
much practical value.

Pressure measurements have been
made on barium hydroxide systems by
means of two different types of ap-
paratus. One type uses a nickel
chamber equipped with a diaphragm
for containing the sample, and the
pressure exerted against the diaphragm
is measured by balancing against a
known pressure on the opposite side

The other type of apparatus
employed a tin manometer, using
nitrogen to balance the manometer.
Experiments with this apparatus
using barium hydroxide containing
about 2% water showed no measurable
pressure at 370°C. For material
corresponding to barium hydroxide
monohydrate, a pressure in excess
of 1 atm at 390°C was observed.
These measurements are all of a
preliminary nature and additional
work must be done before any con-
clusive results will be forthcoming.

Binary Hydroxide Systems (K. A.

Research and Production Division;
C. J. Barton and J. P. Blakely,

166

system Ba(OH),-Sr(OH), has been
studied in some detail by thermal-
analysis methods because these
materials have been reported to be
somewhat less corrosive than the
alkali hydroxides. Figure 13.6
shows the completed phase diagram
for this system. There is evidence
for a solid transition in the com-
position range near the eutectic.
While these researches were made with
dehydrated commercial materials
which contained some carbonate, 1t
is safe to say that mixtures of
usefully low melting point are
available in this system. It is
likely, however, that the decom-
position pressures are relatively

high at 1500°F.

The system LiOH-NaOH has been
examined because certain mixtures
of these materials dissolve ap-
preciable quantities of UO;. The
equilibrium diagram is shown in
Fig. 13.7. The low-melting eutectic
(219°C) contains 27 mole % LiOH;
there 1s evidence of a compound
NaOH LiOH with incongruent melting
point. The thermal effects observed
at about 180°C are probably due to a
solid transition.

Phase diagrams for the systems
NaQOH-KOH, NaQH-RbOH, and RbOH-KOH
have been reported. (11) Phase
studies of the other possible com-
binations will be deferred until
more pressing problems are finished
or until it becomes clear that one of
the systems offers appreciable ad-
vantages from the corrosion stand-
point.

It is apparent, however, that materials
with a useful melting point may be
obtained only at high concentrations
of hydroxide; these mixtures would
probably be similar to pure hy-
droxides in so far as corrosion is
concerned.

Addition of NaOH to the ternary

RADIATION DAMAGE

D. S. Billington, Physics of Solids Institute

A. J. Miller, Research Director's Division

Radiation damage and radiation-
induced corrosion in the prime con-
stituents of the airplane reactor core
have been under examination during the
past few months. The X-10 graphite
pile, the Y-12 cyclotron, and the
Berkeley cyclotron have been utilized
as radiation sources. The limitations
in the significance of the information
being obtained are due mainly to the
low flux in the graphite pile and the
lack of methods for correlating effects
of accelerator particles with those of
pile radiations. In addition, the
Berkeley cyclotron has a low beam
and the Y-12 cyclotron needs
a more uniform beam and efficient
target~cooling mechanisms that will
allow it to be used for irradiating
the specimens with the high bean
currents that are available. While
using the presently available sources,
the experimental groups are expending

struct equipment suitable for use in

In the following description of the
experimental procedures and the re-
sults to date, the significant items
are the stability of the molten fuel

hand corner of Fig. 14.1) substantiates
the conclusion drawn from the total
extensions, namely, that irradiation
increases the total creep strain after
the initial stages of the creep history,
1t was alse the main reason for the
summary disregard of curve 0 in
analyzing the data, If the divergence
between the bench and in-pile curves

is real, then the difference in creep
strain should be guite large, per-
centagewise, after longer times.

Accordingly, a set of specimens will
be irradiated for 500-br periods and
the total strain measured after removal
from the reactor. In this way any
possible errors in strain measurement
because of radiation effects on the
microformer will be eliminated. A
more complete description of all the
above work has been given.(?’

The observation of diminished creep
at shorter times is in agreement with
our earlier work.) Other workers(4:%
have reported only decreased creep
under irradiation, but in the tests

reported here the duration of the test
is much longer and the total strains
much smaller than in any other reported
creep tests under irradiation. This
could, in view of the ignorance of the
mechanisms accounting for creep defor-
mation at slower rates, be responsible
for the apparent difference in results.

These creep measurements under
irradiation will be supplemented by a
tensile creep apparatus which is being
designed for use with the LITR. This
tensile apparatus will provide an
independent check of the cantilever
creep apparatus measurements of creep
under irradiatiom., Another creep
apparatus to be operated in the LITR
will provide stress-corrosion creep
data. This apparatus, now in the
design stage, is basically a modified
sodium loop.

SUPERCRITICAL WATER REACTOR

Nuclear Development Associates, Inc.

As a result of an extensive analysis
of the supercritical water reactor
first proposed in WASH-24,(2?) Nuclear
Development Associates has advanced
detailed specifications for a feasible
design, The reactor and shield com-
prise an ll-ft-diameter sphere of
water with a 2.5-ft square-cylinder
active core at its center. The reactor
will deliver 400 megawatts
maximum wall temperature of 1290°F and
a fuel investment of approximately 25
1b. The proposed fuel elements are of
the sandwich design considered in the
last quarterly report, (3) and the core
design utilizes a flat neutron flux.
The pressure shell introduced some
problem of weight, but the overall
shield weight, 180,000 1b, remains well
within specifications.

OUTLINE OF A SPECIFIC DESIGN

visualized as an l1l-ft-diameter sphere
of water, in the interior of which are
spaced some 200 parallel fuel assemblies
to form a 2.5-ft sguare-cylinder

FUEL ELEMENTS AND ASSEMBLIES

Further consideration of the fuel-
element possibilities discussed in
the last quarterly report(3) has led
to the selection of an oxide type
element. The use of powder metallurgy
techniques to form a fuel sandwich
composed of a sintered UO, and stain-
less steel powder layer rolled between
two pieces of stainless steel seems
particularly attractive. The original
work at ORNL¢3**) produced successful
sandwiches of this type with an over-
all thickness of 30 mils; however,
other research has indicated that this

cation,” Metallurgy Division Quarterly Progress

figure might be lowered considerably,
The powder metallurgy technique dis-
tributes the UO, in separate tiny
pockets in the interior of, in effect,
an otherwise continuous piece of
stainless steel. It appears that there
will be sufficient free volume to
accept the fission gases at moderate
pressure, Thus, pending in-pile tests
of this fuel-element type, we are
inclined toward some optimism regard-
ing 1ts chances for ultimate success-
ful development.

A stainless steel (347 or 316 Nb)
sandwich of 20 mils total thickness,
with the central layer about 10 mils
thick and containing, some 10% UO, by
volume, is suitable. There are many
conceivable ways of arranging such
plates into assemblies. Figure 15.2
illustrates one arrangement designed
to give stiffness, maintain spacings,
permit thermal expansions, etc. Here
alternate flat and corrugated fuel
plates are stacked to fill a square
unfueled tube. The contact of the two
fueled walls has been estimated from
NACA-TN-2257 to run 30°F hotter than

the average metal wall temperature.

REACTIVITY

It appears desirable to keep the
thermal-neutron flux radially flat in the
core to minimize the amount of stain-
less steel needed for heat-transfer
purposes. If the amount of fuel
needed was dependent only upon the
amount of steel used, then this flat-
flux design would obviously minimize
the critical mass as well. Furthermore
it is actually found, with appropriate
simplifying assumptions, that uniform
thermal flux in the core does accompany
minimum critical mass. Thus flattening
the neutron flux operates directly to

minimize the fuel content, as well as
indirectly by minimizing the amount of
steel.

The problem solved was the follow-
ing: Given a region containing
moderator and given some fuel (pure
fissionable material, or a definite
mixture of fissionable material and
structure), what 1s the minimum amount
of the fuel and how should 1t be
distributed in the moderator in order
to obtain a critical assembly? By
assuming that (1) the reactor is
thermal, and (2) the volume occupied
by the fuel is negligible, it was
proved that there 1s a region in the
moderator in which fuel should be
placed, and in this region the thermal
flux should be constant. The fuel

distribution can be obtained for
suitably shaped systems.

The above restrictions are well
satisfied for pure U?3% immersed in
an infinite sea of water, heavy water,
beryllium, or carbon. Thus we are
now in a position to calculate the
minimum critical mass of a chain-
reacting assembly moderated by any of
the usual moderators. This calculation
has not yet been carried out. A
calculation for the same power output,
and the results of an illustrative
calculation using the same power
output and with the same assumptions
otherwise, comparing a reactor with
uniform fuel-tube loading with the
flat-flux reactor has been made. Both
reactors had cores 75 cm long and 67
cm in diameter and reflectors with
outer diameters of 100 cm. The flat-
flux reactor had 300 kg of stainless
steel. The uniform fuel reactor
required, for the same power output,
1.54 as much stainless steel and 1.41
as much uranium,

STABILITY

Calculations of the equivalent bare
reactor have been expanded to include
the detailed flux shape in the reflected
reactor and a fairly detailed repre-
sentation of the space variations of
flow and heat transfer. First results

have been obtained and will be reported
as soon as they have been analyzed.

The general procedure is to con-
sider first small oscillations from
equilibrium. The periods of the
system are then obtained as the
eigenvalues of the problem. A vari-
ational principle is used to convert
the system of partial differential
equations to a matrix problem, which

uv
 

FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

is then handled by methods discussed
in a recent report.(®} In this method
of approach the accuracy of the
results for the pericds and time
behavior 1s limited only by one's
diligence and ingenuity in applying
the variational principle.

PRESSURE SHELL

Between the pressure shell and the
reactor core is a layer of heavy
material to cut down the gamma heat
release in the shell. Both this
thermal- shielding layer and the shell
ttself are of substantially constant
thickness all around the reactor and
represent a substantial fraction of the
total gamma-shield weight. Since
divided-shield arrangements tend to
concentrate the heavy material at the
side of the reactor facing the crew,
the pressure shell and its thermal
shield reduce the efficiency of the
overall shield design by putting
substantial amounts of material in the
wrong place.

To keep down the weight associated
with the pressure shell we may (1)
keep the shell nearly spherical and
its radius fairly small, (2} reduce
the thermal-shielding layer until heat
transfer from the shell begins to be
troublesome, (3) make the shell of
high-strength alloys such as U. 8,
Steel stainless W or Armco 17-7 PH or
17-4 PH, (4) run the pressure-induced
stresses quite high in the shell, or
(5) permit thermal strains large

enough to cause yielding in the outer
fibers.*

For ‘application in the above-
mentioned gamma heating problem, methods
have been devised for valculating the
the gamma leakage from spherical
reactors with radial variation in
component concentrations. The gauma
build-up processes occurring inside
the reactor have been included approxi-
mately, and calculations have also
been made of the angular distribution
of the emerging photons. Present un-
certainties in the energy distribution
of gammas produced as a result of
fission prevent accurate calculation
of the leakage; conservative assumptions
have been made, but they could be off
by 50% or more.

SHIELD

Preliminary estimates of divided-
shield weights were made for the super-
critical water cycle for a range of

reactor core sizes, reactor-crew
separation distances, and reactor
powers, The basic shield used was

essentially that described in ANP-
53,3) modified to include several
inches of iron near the core because
of the pressure shell and its heat
shielding. This iren layer was
considered useful shielding material,
since the fast-neutron flux for this
design was considerably smaller at the
pressure shell than the primary gamma
flux, (The thermal-neutron flux
reaching the iron was considered
stopped by a boron layer.) Then an

Atomic Energy Division, The H. X. Ferguson Co., Inc.

A study of a subsonic aircraft
reactor using circulating sodium
hydroxide as beth moderator and coolant
and a fixed fuel of UF, dissolved in
alkali and alkaline earth fluorides
has been completed by the Atomic Energy
Division of The H. K. Ferguson Co.
under contract to ORNL, As a result
cf this study it was conclnded that
the circulating -moderator-coolant
reactor can provide ample power for a
subsonic airplane. Actually the
performance of the aircraft is inter-
mediate between the NaOH homogeneous
and the UBi circulating-fuel reactors
discussed. in previous quarterly re-
ports. ?'3) Principal advantages of
the circulating moderator-cecolant
system over the other two include the
use of a moderator of known properties
and bebavior and the fact that the
secondary coolant is not made radio-
active, which simplifies the shielding
problem. The main drawback, in addition
to the fact that a suitable container
for sodium hydroxide isnot yet assured,
is the multitude of metallic heat-
transfer tubes in the core through
which heat is transferred from fuel to
coolant. The present study was con-
fined to the reactor because it was

known at the outset that the inter-
mediate heat exchanger and remainder
of the power plant would be almost
identical with those designed for the
homogeneous sodium hydroxide reactor
and that the power requirements are
similar. A schematic diagram of this
reactor core is shown in Fig. 16.1.

OPERATIONAL CHARACTERISTICS

reactor is designed to provide power

to operate a modified B-52 type plane
cruising at 35,000 ft altitude and
Mach 0.8. The maximum metal tempera-
ture was set at 1500°F, The problems
of a solid moderator are eliminated
and a simpler structure is adequate.

advantages that it can be drained upon

effect for reactor control.

The reactor delivers 140,000 kw at
the design point of 35,000 ft and Mach
0.8, with a coolant outlet temperature
of 1380°F, inlet 1180°F. The maximum
heat flux is 530,000 Bru/ft?2-hr, At
sea level it provides 230,000 kw.
This increase 1s accomplished by in-
creasing the temperature rise through
the reactor (inlet 1007°F, ountlet
1335°F) while increasing the heat flux
{maximum 870,000), and 1t permits
climb from sea level at 720 ft/min at
a speed of 250 knots.

REACTOR CHARACTERISTICS

The present reactor design has the
characteristics of all fixed- {fuel
reactors: (1) the heat must be trans-
ferred first through the fuel and then
through the canning material; (2) the
coolant flow must be distributed in
accordance with the flux distribution;
and (3) the core must contain a compli-
cated structure subject to thermal and
mechanical stress and to radiation
damage. This reactor utilizes the
type of liquid fuel planned for use in
the proposed ARE reactor at OBNL, the
essential difference being the use of
sodium hydroxide as the combined
coolant and moderator as compared with
the ORNL use of a fixed moderator of

186

BeO and a coolant of sodium. Sodium
hydroxide was specified as the moderator
coolant in the HKF proposal because it
is considered to have the best combi-
nation of properties for this use:
adequate slowing-down power; does not
freeze, or have a high vapor
pressure in the operating temperature

decompose,

range; and its neutron absorption 1s
not excessive for this type of reactor.

An advantage of this design over
the homogeneous sodium hydroxide
reactor and the circulating- fuel
reactor 1s that the fuel does not
circulate outside the reactor during
operation. This tends to decrease the
reactor shield weight, and, more
important, avoids irradiation of the
heat exchanger and outside coolant
fluid with delayed neutrons. It also
eliminates loss of delayed neutrons
outside the core. The large number of
heat-transfer tubes, common to all
noncirculating-fuel aircraft reactors,
1s a disadvantage compared to the
homogeneous reactor. Probably more
important than the problems and
advantages of the mechanical design
are the materials problems. If ma-
terials resistant to corrosion by
sodium hydroxide with good high-
temperature characteristics can be
found, the circulating-moderator-
coolant reactor appears to be capable
of powering the subsonic aircraft.

CORE DESIGN

The reactor core is a square cylinder
32 in, in diameter. The sodium hy-
droxide moderator coolant flows down-
ward through small, closely spaced
inconel tubes, Fuel occupies the
space between the tubes, A jacket of
sodium hydroxide around the core acts

 
 

FOR

as a reflector as does the sodium
hydroxide in the top and bottom headers.
Lead provides a gamma shield to pro-
tect the pressure shell against over-
heating. The sodium hydroxide flows
inside the tubes, thereby ensuring
against hot spots which could be
caused by interruptions in flow, which
would occur if the flow were outside
the tubes. This positive flow path
is believed necessary, as sodium
hydroxide has poorer heat-transfer
properties than sodium, for example.

The fuel was designed to be drain~
able, in order to decrease greatly the
uranium inventory for a group of planes,
This advantage, however, brings with
it a serious leakage problem, Since
the fuel 1s in a common’ container, it
could all escape through a large leak.
The effect of small leaks is minimized
by balancing pressures so that coolant

leaks into the fuel, rather than the
reverse.
‘BEACTOR PHYSICS
The uranium weight is high, 187 1b

because of the large amount of inconel,
necessary for heat-transfer surface.
The reactor could not be much smaller
without exorbitant uranium content.
The uranium could be reduced somewhat
by going to larger sizes, at the
expense of increased shield weight.

The sodium hydroxide reflector
brings up the thermal -neutron flux,
and therefore power production, in the
core near the boundary. The effect
does not extend far toward the
center as would be desired, owing to
the large absorption in the reactor,
and the effect on leveling out the
neutron flux is only moderate.

as

The amount of fuel in the middle of
the reactor is varied to give a total
shim control of 10% reactivity. For
inherent temperature stability the
fuel in the end zones, which is 80% of
the total, can expand to chambers out-
side the reactor. No provision is made
for xenon override, as draining and
replacing the fuel after shutdown makes
1t unnecessary.

17. CIRCULATING-MODERATOR-COOLANT REACTOR:

L. F. Hemphill

ORNL

R. W. Schroeder

H. BR, Wesson
ANP Division

A preliminary design of a hydroxide
cooled and moderated reactor has been
defined. A 2.5-ft spherical reactor
should be able to deliver 200 megawatts
with a maximum wall temperature of
1500°F and a maximum coolant outlet
temperature of 1450°F. Only 115
megawatts 1s believed adequate for
flight at Mach 0.75 at 35,000 ft. An
essential feature of the design is the
use of annular fuel elements to attain
a high ratio of heat-transfer surface
to fuel volume. These design studies
were based on the use of sodium hy-
droxide, as its properties are better
known than those of the other possible
hydroxides.

FLUID-CIRCUIT SPECIFICATIONS

After exploratory investigations, it
was decided to attempt to design a 200-
megawatt reactor with a 2.5-ft spherical
core, with a maximum wall temperature
in contact with the coolant of 1500°F,
and with coolant inlet and outlet
temperatures of 1100 and 1450°F,
respectively, These temperatures
imply a permissible coolant film drop
of 400°F at the inlet end, and 50°F at
the outlet end. The thermal con-
ductivity of sodium hydroxide is poor
relative to the thermal conductivities
of liquid metals, causing heat-transfer
coefficients and film temperature drops
to suffer. Attainment of the 50°F
film drop at the outlet end therefore
indicated special treatment to be
necessary. With all other variables
fixed, film drop varies directly with

188

unit power and inversely with V?2-8
where V is fluid velocity. Therefore
the design should be such as to permit
the coolant to exit from a region of
minimum power, and such as to permit
high coolant velocities at the dis-
charge end of the flow path. Con-
versely, lower velocities can be
employed at stations farther removed
from the discharge end,
mizing pressure drop.

thereby mini-

FUEL-ELEMENT DESIGN

Fuel-element studies indicated the
ratio of heat-transfer surface required
to fuel volume required to be high,
approximately 1000 ft? surface to
0.33 ft? volume. (The fuel volume is
based on the use of fused fluorides
with a uranium density of 150 1b/ft3,
and an estimated critical mass of
50 1b.) The use of cylindrical fuel
elements with fuel filling the elements
would have involved a prohibitive
number of very small tubes, The use
of annular fuel elements, with fuel
in the annulus and coolant moderator
flowing inside and outside the element,
permitted acceptable fuel temperature
gradients, and a mechanical design of
enhanced simplicity and ruggedness.

REACTOR DESIGN

The foregoing considerations led to
the configuration illustrated in Fig,
17.1. The entering fluid is passed
through the reflector region first

North American Aviation,

At the request of Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, North American Aviation
has conducted an investigation of
high-temperature (above 1800°F) helium
and sodium liquid-vapor power cycles
with regard to their application to
the Phase II (Mach 1.5, 45,000 ft)
aircraft, This work has been com-
pleted, and detailed reports are
being prepared for publication.
A brief summary of the conclusions
reached as a result of these studies
1s presented here.

Aerodynamic studies here indicate
that L/D ratios of the order of 4.0 to
5.0 represent a maximum attainable
range for large supersonic aircraft
at Mach 1.5 and 45,000 ft. Values at
the higher end of the range can be
achieved only with an exceptionally
clean and high-impulse
engines. (This 1s in sharp contrast
to L/D values of the crder of 5.7 to
6.5 quoted generally in the literature
for systemswith relatively low-impulse
engines.) A consequence of reduced
aerodynamic performance 1s increased

airframe

power plant impulse, and this in turn
requires engineering a higher tempera-
ture power plant than 1s presently
under consideration elsewhere. As a

HIGH- TEMPERATURE POWER PLANT STUDIES”

Inc.

North American has investigated
compressor Jets as a means for the
attainment of the necessary high
temperatures. In the binary com-
pressor-jet cycles, the working medium
in contact with the high-temperature
components need not necessarily be an
oxidizing fluid. If the operating
temperature of the radiator is main-
tained below 1800°F, the problems of
obtaining suitable high-temperature
materials may be significantly reduced,
since all high-temperature components
are not subject to oxidation.

On the basis of experiments con-
ducted at North American and elsewhere,
there appear to exist materials capable
of withstanding high temperatures
(up to 3500°F) in nonoxidizimg atmos-
pheres. Before these materials can be
considered seriously for engineering
application, a major developmental
effort is required to establish tech-
niques by which they can be fabricated
into useful components. Furthermore,
much has to be learned about the cor-
rosion resistance of these materials
to the various coolants and the work-
ing medium proposed. Some pre-
liminary experimental work along these
lines has

To date, results are
encouraging but not yet conclusive.
For example, static corrosion rates of
3250°F sodium vapor on molybdenum are
apparently well within the required
limits for the aircraft power plants.

FOR

North American has conducted an
analytical investigation of high-
temperature compressor jets to de-
termine the plausibility of such
systems and to provide a guide for any
future experimental work that might be
undertaken. The aim in this work has
not been to establish the feasibility
of systems that might be cornstrunted
in the near future. The aim has been
rather to determine whether an extensive
materials and component development
program for high-temperature com-
pressor-jet application would be
Justified.

An integrated reactor, power plant,
and airframe study has been conducted
for several proposed systems, carried
out in sufficient detail to determine
if a plausible supersonic airplane is
achievable, Some systems quickly
appeared severely limited in per-
formance and only a small amount. of
analytical detail was required. This
was true for the gas-cooled reactors.
The sodium liquid-vapor compressor jet
was developed in considerable detail
and appears to be one plausible
system, In all cases the analysis was
dependent on extrapolations of rela-
tively meager experimental data on
properties of materials and working
fluids. The numerical results that
have come out of these analyses are
not intended to be final and fixed
and should be considered in the light
of their intended exploratory purpose.

crew members and the necessary control
equipment. The power plant is aft of
the reactor; the fuselage diameter is
approximately 13 ft at this section.
The power plant consists of a sodium-
vapor generator heated by molten tin,
located immediately aft of the shielded
reactor, Sodium vapor passes to five
turbines mounted circumferentially
around and entirely within the fuselage.
Each turbine is directly coupled to a
303-1b/sec air compressor which drives
air aft and across a common radiator,
the sodium condenser, which occupies
the entire fuselage diameter. Air
continues aft through a nozzle pro-
ducing the propulsive thrust; the
sodium condensate 1s pumped forward
to the vapor generator,

The task of developing such a power
plant as described above would require
a very extensive effort. However, if
the appraisal of supersonic aerodynamic
performance is correct, and if a manned,
supersonic nuclear vehicle is required,
a program of this sort should be under-
taken. The sodium cycle is suggested
as one possible approach,
sarily a unique one, which on the basis

not neces-

of preliminary studies appears to have
no fundamental limitations that pre-
clude its development,

that a major development effort uti-

supersonic propulsion of aircraft
cannot be justified. In no case does
it appear that a supersonic vehicle
can be achieved, even when considering
reactor temperatures as high as 3300°F
and helium pressures in the range of
1000 to 2000 psi. There are fundamental
limitations involved having to do with
the comparatively poor heat-transfer
characteristics of the gaseous coolants.

A basic requirement for a high-
performance aircraft is light, compact
heat-exchange equipment with minimum
auxiliary power requirement. Jt 1s
well known that at moderate pressures
and temperatures gaseous coolants are
several orders of magnitude poorer in
these regards than the liquid coolants,
Increasing gas pressure tends to reduce
this difference, as does increasing
temperature differentials between hot
and cold fluids. At high pressures
equipment becomes more compact and
pumping power is reduced, but little
or no weight saving 1s accomplished
since heavier walled equipment is
required to accommodate the increased
pressure. The requirement that temper-
ature differentials in heat-exchange
equipment be large forces the maximum
power plant temperatures to 2 high
level without any realizable thermo-
dynamic benefit, While temperatures
in this analysis as high as 3300°F
were considered, air specific impulses
remained relatively low (approximately
30 1b thrust/lb air/sec). In all
specific designs considered for the
helium system, no plausible supersonic
vehicle was found. Specific power
plant weights in excess of 2.6 1b of
power plant per pound thrust were
obtained in all instances, Even
assuming an L/D ratio of 5.0, which is
hardly realizable with these low-
impulse engines, an aircraft of a gross
weight well in excess of 450,000 1b is

Satisfactory chemical methods have
been developed or suitably modified
for the determination of metallic cor-
rosion products ~~ principally iron,
nickel, chromium, molybdenum, and
platinum — in reactor fuels composed
of eutectic mixtures of fluoride
salts. Two colorimetric methods for
low concentrations of cobalt in fluoride
salt mixtures and alkali hydroxides
were found to be too insensitive
(sensitivity, 100 ppm) for the purpose.
Work is continuing on this problem.

A crystalline material, which was
deposited in the lithium at a hot-
cold junction in a coolant test system
during an extended shutdown period, was
identified by X-ray-daiffraction
analysis as a

in lithium, beth carbide and carbonate
carbon, has been developed.

The n-butyl bromide method, which
is now being used regularly for the
determination of oxygen in sodium, is
found to yield excellent results for
oxygen concentrations of 0.015% or
greater. Studies are being made of
refinements of this method so that it
may be applied with reasonable accuracy
at even lower concentrations. A search
is being made to find a liquid medium
suitable for use in melting sodium
samples from metal tube containers;
certain hydrocarbons which are under
test appear to be promising for this
application. Preliminary tests
directed toward the adaptation of
the method of Pepkowitz and Judd?)
(for oxygen in sodium) to the determi-
nation of oxygen and nitrogen in
lithium do not appear premising.
However, an apparatus 1s under con-

which gives excellent precision below

Spectrographic Besults, The eu-
tectic mixture was prepared for spec-
trographic analysis of corrosion
products as described in previous
reports. (**5) The agreement of spec-
trographic and chemical results was
satisfactory for iron, nickel, and
chromium. Molybdenum was not de-
termined spectrographically., Since
the spectrographic preparation is time-
consuming and the results essentially
substantiate the chemical results,
spectographic tests have been dis-
continued.

Development of Colorimetric Methods,
Two reagents for the determination of
traces of cobalt in fluoride eutectics
and fused alkali metal hydroxides,
tetraphenyl arsonium chloride and
sodium diethyl thiocarbamate, were
investigated, Neither showed sufficient
sensitivity under the conditions
imposed in this case, 1.e., the limited
amount of sample available and the
number of other determinations required
on the same sample. The lower limit of
sensitivity for these reagents is of
the order of 100 ppm. Other reagents,
nitroso R salt in particular, will be
tried, and the procedures examined for
possible means of increasing sensi-
tivity.

The procedure for the colorimetric
determination of chromium has been
standardized to give 5% accuracy in
the range 100 to 20,000 ppm by adopting
the procedure of G. F. Smith¢®) which
assures holding all the chromium in
the same valence state.

Excellent precision has been obtained
in determining molybdenum in quantities

Determination of Platinum. Platinum
is currently being used as a therme-
couple material in studies of the
physical properties of the fluoride
eutectic fuel mixtures, and it 1s
therefore necessary to analyze these
mixtures for platinum. Samples
analyzed for platinum have generally
been found to contain less than 100 ppm.

colorimetrically as the yellew chloro-
platinous ion, PeCl, 4", the reduction

complished by stannous chloride in
acidic solution. The color is stable
at acid concentrations of about 0.25 N.
Palladium interferes in the procedure.
The interference of yellow U(VI) ion
is eliminated bv extraction of the
uranium with tributyl phosphate.

OXYGEN IN SODIUM

BR. Rowan, Jr., and J. C. White
Analytical Chemistry Division

The n-butyl bromide method for the
determination of oxygen in sodium is
being used on a routine basis for
samples of oxygen content of about
0.015% or more. Studies are now pro-
gressing to determine the accuracy of
this and other methods (Pepkowitz and

Judd in particular) in the range 0,001
to 0.005%.

OXYGEN IN LEAD

D, IL. Manning and W. K. Miller
Analytical Chemistry Division

The need for a method for the
determination of small amounts of
oxygen in lead has led to the in-
vestigation of the method of Funston
and Reed.(?) This method involves the
measurement of the reduction in volume
of hydrogen when heated in contact
with the sample; however, the total
volume of the apparatus is so large in
comparison with the small change in
volume during the reaction that the
method is highly inaccurate. A new
apparatus is being designed to correct
this failing in which a small known
volume of hydrogen is introduced into
a combustion chamber and allowed to
burn with the oxygen from the lead,
When the reaction is complete, the
remainder of the hydrogen 1s swept out
of the chamber with €CO,, the CO,
absorbed in reaction with KOH, and the
volume of the remaining hydrogen
determined,

OXYGEN IN HELIUM

The method of Brady(?®) discussed in
the last quarterly progress report(®>
has been modified and used with good
results. The new procedure is to
measure the volume of test gas re-
quired to produce a 5% change in
transmission of the sodium anthraquinone
sulfonate reagent, which changes

directly proportional to the oxygen
content of the gas. The precision of
the results is good at oxygen concen-
trations of less than 25 ppm, but
drops off sharply at higher concen-
trations because of the smaller test
gas volumes used. This 1s 1llustrated

URANIUM TRIEFLUOBIDLE XN URANIUM
TETRAFLUORIDE

W. K. Miller and D. [.. Manning
Analytical Chemistry Division

Uranium trifluoride has recently
been prepared in anticipation of its
use in eutectic fuel mixtures for
nuclear reactors. Since its preparation
generally includes reduction of UF,
analytical procedures used to determine
UF, purity must be able to separate
the two fluorides. It was hoped to
find an oxidizing agent which would
oxidize U(IIT) to U(IV) with no effect

on the tetravalent ion already present.

 
 

FOR PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1951

Of those mild oxidizing agents which
were tried, including water, ammoniacal
silver nitrate, and ferric sulfate-—
hydrofluoric acid, only water appeared
promising, although ammeniacal silver
nitrate is still under investigation.

The amount of UF, may also be
determined: by measuring evolved hydrogen
by the reaction

4UF, + 4HCl—> UC1, + 3UF, + 2H,

The apparatus used for this is similar
to that for the Dumas nitrogen determi-
nation except that a reaction flask
fitted with a dropping funnel replaces
the Dumas combustion tube. The evolved
hydrogen is swept into the gas buret
by a stream of CO,. Early results are
not too consistent, but it is believed
that by reducing the volume of the
apparatus better precision can be
attained.

The most promising method so far
considered 1s based on the total
reducing power of the sample. An
excess of standard ceric sulfate is
added to a mixture of the sample and
aluminum sulfate, and the excess is
titrated with standard ferrous ammonium
sulfate. Results obtained from this
method are compared with those from
the hydrogen evolution method on a
single sample in Table 19.1.

portion of the system remained at the
operating temperature of about 500°F
while an adjacent section was cooled
to room temperature. The entire
system was then allowed to cool.
Clusters of pink transparent crystals
were found embedded in the lithium
matrix in the zone of contact between
the cold and hot sections, The
crystals dissolved completely in water
with a vigorous evolution of gas,
indicating that they were probably
lithium carbide or lithium hydride.
A few crystals were mechanically
separated from most of the matrix and
submitted to the Isotopes Physics
Department for X-ray-diffraction
analysis. The sample was identified
as a mixture of lithium hydride
and lithium hydroxide and possibly
small amounts of lithium nitride, It
is probable that the LiOH was formed
by hydrolysis at the surface of the
sample and that freshly separated
crystals are almost pure LiH. A
hydrogen determination by combustion
was unsuccessful, probably because of
the presence of some adhering lithium;

however, it is planned to determine
