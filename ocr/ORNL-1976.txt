STEADY STATE CONTROL CHARACTERISTICS OF
CHEMICAL NUCLEAR AIRCRAFT POWER PLANTS

C B Thompson

SUMMARY

It seems reasonable to believe that the simplest
control system for the nuclear power source In a
combination chemical nuclear aircraft power plant
will result if nuclear power delivery during normal
operational use can be throttled by variation of a
single control quantity Studies to date of the
steady state off design point performance charac
teristics of two such power plants indicate that
satisfactory power control can be obtained by by
passing NaK around the engine radiators alone if
full range NaK bypass valves can be built and if
the fuel temperature at the inlet of the reactor
core can be allowed to rise as high as the design
point mean fuel temperature If the fuel tempera
ture at the tnlet to the reactor core must be limited
to some value less than the design point mean
fuel temperature the control rod must also be
moved as power delivery 1s varied Possibilities
for throttling reactor power delivery by individual
variation of reactor fuel flow control rod position
NaK flow “and radiator air bypass percentage were
also considered but each of these altemate
schemes 1s unsatisfactory

Study of the static stabihity characteristics of a
demand sensitive reactor turbojet load combination
indicates that such a power plant should operate
stably in the high power range At part load op
erating conditions however the inherent static
stability of such a power plant 1s questionable
and appears to depend on the throttling scheme
used In the example considered here the NaK
bypass throttled power plant was stable at low
power part load operating points while the air

 

bypass throttled power plant was not stable

The various engine loads are cross coupled
through their common reactor power source If
the power delivered to one engine 1s varied the
power delivered to the other engines also changes
When NaK bypass throttling 1s used and the con
trol rod position is constant the magnitude of the
coupling effect appears to be relatively small If
rod motion with total power level changes 1s re
quired however cross coupling between engines
will be more pronounced and may be large enough
to make tedious the independent manual adjust
ment of power delivery to each load

Automatic control requirements for the nuclear
heat source can be determined by considering how
the flight engineer might perform typical power
plant maneuvers without the help of automatic con
trol equipment Study of the manual operations
required indicates that the addition of automatic
control equipment for the NaK bypasses 1s very
desirable if not essential to limit movement of
the valves in such a way as to maintain the retum
line NaK temperatures between their upper and
lower limits at all times Automatic control equip
ment 1s also required for the rod if the fuel tem
perature at the inlet of the reactor core must be
held below the design point mean fuel temperature
Such equipment might withdraw the rod to main
tain the mean fuel temperature at as high a level
as possible as limited by the requirements that
both the core fuel inlet temperature and the core
fuel outlet temperature be less than or equal to
thetr maximum allowable values

INTRODUCTION

Most of the control system thinking by the ORNL
ANP group has quite naturally been directed toward
the problems associated with controlling a circu
lating fuel reactor which delivers power to a heat
dump type of load This work 1s of major concern
since a large part of the ANP effort at ORNL 1s
now being devoted to the ART

The control system for the ultimate reactor—
turbojet engine power plant will obviously be dif
ferent from the control system for the ART power
plant because both a reactor control system and a
properly mated set of chemical turbojet controls
will be required The effectiveness of the ART In
clearing up problems associated with controlling
the large aircraft power plant depends largely on
how well the inherent differences between the con
trol requirements of the ART and those of large
aircraft power plants are understood The work
described in this report was carried out to provide
some of the information required for studying these
differences

The ultimate power plant will consist of one
large reactor coupled to a number of turbojet
engines (the number ranging from two to six de
pending on the type of aircraft being propelled)
The over all
teristics of such power plants when manually con
trolled at part power off design operating condi
tions must be thoroughly understood before con
trol system requirements can be determined This
report 1s

These combinations were selected primarily be
cause of the availability of performance data its
not believed that they necessarily represent usable
systems They are considered here merely as
vehicles for studying control problems

Detailed characterishcs of each of the com
ponents of the above power plants are summarized
in the next section Steady state part load per
formance characteristics derived from these data
are then discussed and the effects of potential

throttling parameter variations are described The
static stability of a demand sensitive reactor
power source—tfurbojet engine load combination 1s
and coupling effects between
engines in a multiengine power plant are invest
gated Finally the actions required of the power
plant operator in carrying out typical power plant
maneuvers without the help of automatic control
equipment are outlined to show what types of
equipment are needed

DETAILED POWER PLANT DESCRIPTIONS — COMPONENT CHARACTERISTICS

Detailed performance characteristics of each
power plant component must be known before the
over all composite behavior of a power plant can
be calculated Each of the components of the two

The heat exchanger design described above was
obtained from M M Yarosh This design was
prepared some time before detailed heat transfer
tests were run and before final heat exchanger
designs were completed Heat transfer coefficient
estimates fuel property estimates and the design
power rating have all been changed since the
design described 1n the above table was made
Hence the heat exchanger used here 1s not the
same as the heat exchanger currently planned for
the ART However the external performance char
acteristics of the design considered here and the
current design do not appear to be different enough
to change any of the general conclusions drawn
from this work

The variation of the over all heat transfer coef
ficient of the reactor heat exchanger with changes
in fuel flow rate NaK flow rate and mean reactor
fuel temperature must be known if the part load
steady state performance characteristics of the
power plant are to be calculated The variation of
this coefficient with changes in fuel flow rate has
been estimated for a mean reactor fuel temperature
of 1450°F and a midrange NaK flow rate (320
Ib/sec) by use of a procedure suggested by
Yarosh The result 1s plotted in Fig 1
temperature changes and NaK flow rate changes
also affect the over all heat transfer coefficient
but these effects are thought to be relatively small
for NaK flow rate and average temperature varia
tions in the normal safe operating range

Part load engine performance data that describe
the variation of the turbojet load imposed on the
reactor at off design operating conditions are re

formance determination The curves of Figs 2
through 5 show how pertinent off design steady
state X-61 engine parameters vary with net thrust
output at various altitudes and flight speeds for
power inputs less than 30 Mw These curves were
calculated from the corrected quantity data of
Goodlette | Net thrust output and required power

A hypothetical radiator was designed for the
X 61 engine by use of the procedure and basic
data outlined in Appendix A which were obtained
from R D Schultheiss This radiator was de-
signed to transfer 30 Mw of nuclear power to the
engine load imposed during cruise at 35000 ft
Comparison of the total thrust available from two
X 61 engines operating at 30 Mw power input at
35000 ft with the total thrust required by a repre
sentative seaplane airframe shows that such an
aircraft might be expected to cruise at about

ficient also varies with changes in the NaK flow
rate and the mean temperature of the radiator but
these effects are thought to be small in the normal
operating region

The engine performance curves discussed pre
viously (Figs 2 through 5) were worked out for a

the compressor and turbine Strictly speaking the
increase in pressure loss resulting from the add
tion of a radiator causes all the equilibrium operat
ing characteristics of the engine (Figs 2 through
5) to shift Recalculation of the new steady state
operating characteristics 1s a major job however
which requires engine component performance maps
which are not available

The effects of radiator pressure drop on steady
state engine performance are therefore neglected
in the calculations that follow This should not
cause serious errors in final conclusions because
the radiator pressure drop in this case appears to
be relatively small The over all trends being
sought should still manifest themselves

STEADY STATE POWER PLANT PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS - NUCLEAR

the two power plants under consideration during
operation on nuclear power only can be calculated
by combining the component characteristics sum
martzed in the preceding section Figure 8 is a

The behavior of the hypothetical reactor—X 61

CONTROL ROD THROTTLING

The behavior of the reactor-X 61 power plant
when throttling by control rod motion 1s attempted
at a typical off design flight condition 1s shown
in Fig 9 A sample calculation illustrating the
procedure used to determine these curves Is in
cluded in Appendix B At this flight condition
the radiators have more heat transfer surface area
than 1s required for transferring 30 Mw to each
engine |f the power transferred to each engine 1s
to be limited to the maximum allowable value of
30 Mw one or more of the potential control quanti
ties generally must be reduced with decreasing
altitude

Figure 9 shows that the mean reactor fuel tem
perature must be reduced to about 1260°F f power
delivery 1s to be limited to 30 Mw during flight
at 15000 fi and Mach 045 Under these cond:
tions the reactor NaK inlet temperature drops to
about 900°F Operation of the system at such a
low NaK temperature at the inlet of the main heat
exchanger 1s unsafe because of the possibility of
local cold spot formation and fuel freezing The

made to reduce power delivery to each engine be
low 30 Mw When the rod 1s inserted far enough
to throttle power delivery to only 25 Mw for ex
ample the core fuel inlet temperatsre itself drops
to below 1000°F

From the curves of Fig 9 it 1s apparent that
the thrust output of the power plant cannot be
throttled safely by moving only the reactor control
rod Control rod throttling is also unsuitable if
independent variations in power delivery to each
of the engines are to be made since motion of the
control rod affects all engines in the same way

REACTOR FUEL FLOW THROTTLING

The behavior of the power plant when it is
throttled by reactor fuel flow variation with all
other quantities at their design point values 1s
shown mn Fig 10 At the 15000 ft Mach 0 45
flight condition reactor fuel flow must be reduced
to roughly 60% of its rated value to limit power
delivery to each engine to 30 Mw When this is
done the fuel temperature at the outlet of the

10

reactor rises to 1700°F and the NaK temperature
at the inlet of the reactor falls to 900°F Operation
at these temperatures is unsafe if not impossible
Further reduction in fuel flow does reduce the
power delivered to each engine and reduces the
engine thrust outputs but as the fuel flow 1s
reduced the fuel outlet temperature continues to
rise and the fuel and NaK inlet temperatures con
tinue to fall

Thus reactor fuel flow alone 1s very unsuitable
as a primary power control parameter Virtually
all the critical steady state temperature variations
which result when such a scheme is used are
unsafe and independent adjustment of power
delivery to each load is not possible

NaK FLOW THROTTLING

The behavior of the power plant when it is
throttled by NaK flow variation alone is shown in
Fig 11 The NaK flow must be reduced to 42% of
its rated value to limit power delivery to each

engine to 30 Mw at the 15 000 ft Mach 0 45 flight

condition Such a NaK flow reduction with all
other quantities at thew rated values causes the
NaK temperature at the inlet of the reactor to drop
to around 640°F which 1s far below the 1050°F
safe lower limit Further reduction in NaK flow
does reduce power delivery but 1t causes the
return [ine NaK temperature to drop shill lower
Thus NaK flow alone 1s not a suitable power
control quantity because the NaK temperature at
the inlet of the reactor drops rapidly to dangerously
low values as the flow rate 1s reduced Some
means of protection against return line NaK under
cooling must be added if power delivery 1s to be
throttled safely by NaK flow rate reduction

NaK BYPASS THROTTLING

When the reactor—X 61 power plant 1s throttled
by bypassing NaK around the radiators the thrust
output of each engine and the reactor power de
livered to each engine vary as shown in Figs 12

It seems reasonable to believe that the simplest
over all power plant control system will result
when nuclear power delivery 1s throttled by varia
tion of the fewest possible control quantities
The steady state performance characteristics dis
cussed In the preceding paragraphs indicate that
power plant thrust output modulation through varia
tion of a single control quantity — NaK bypass
percentage or air bypass percentage — appears to
be possible if the fuel temperature at the inlet of

situations will arise in power plant design or

culties in building full range NaK bypass valves

the effect of increasing the complexity of the

STATIC STABILITY CHARACTERISTICS OF A DEMAND SENSITIVE

REACTOR=TURBOJET COMBINATION

Stable operation of a reactor—turbojet engine
combination 1s not assured by a large negative
reactor temperature coefficient of reactivity Such
a characteristic does undoubtedly simplify the con
trol of the reactor but the demand characteristic
of a turbojet load and the demand sensitivity char
acteristic of a reactor having a large negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity are not neces
sarily compatible

The turbojet load imposed on the nuclear heat
source (airflow and radiator inlet temperature)
varies in a complicated way with the power de
livered to it Changes in power delivery to
such a load cause the load characteristics
themselves to change Changes in load charac
teristics however can cause further changes in
reactor power delivery because the large negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity makes the
If it 1s possible for a sub
sequent change in power delivery to reinforce an
original power disturbance the reactor load com
bination can walk or run away The possi
bility for an instability of this type does not exist
when the reactor 1s coupled to a heat dump type
of load because the load characteristics are
externally adjusted by blower speed and louver
and bypass opening variation Changes in these
external load adjustments do cause the reactor
power level to change but changes in the reactor
power level cannot in turn cause further changes
in the load This 1s an important basic difference
between the two load types

The static stability of a demand sensitive reactor
power source and a turbojet load can be studied
from plots showing how the steady state power
available from the radiator and the steady state
power required to run the engine vary with engine
speed when the reactor throttling quantities are
constant Such plots obviously do not provide a
complete picture of the stability of the over all

reactor load sensitive

 

1

power plant but 1t does seem that an unstable
intersection between a steady state nuclear power
available curve and the steady state engine power
required curve 1s a definite indication of trouble

Steady state power required and power available
curves for the reactor—J 71 system at SL static
operating conditions are shown in Figs 19 and 20
for air and NaK bypass throttling (sample cal
culations are included in Appendix C) All the
potential reactor control quantities with the ex
ception of the bypasses are constant at their
rated values The air and NaK bypasses are con
stant along given power available curves at the
values shown

The intersections between the curves of power
available at a constant air bypass setting and
engine power required are unstable in the low
speed range The steady state power available
rises faster than the power required as the engine
speed increases (air flow and compressor discharge
temperature increase)

Idle speed for the J 71 engine is around 3000
rpm Net thrust output at this speed is down to
about 3% of the rated SL static value Stable
operation at speeds corresponding to less than
maximum nuclear power input (5050 rpm 23% of
rated SL static net thrust output) does not appear
to be possible when the reactor—J 71 power plant
1s throttled by bypassing air around the radiators
This apparent difficulty is a serious disadvantage
of the air bypass throttling arrangement When the
power plant 1s throttled with NaK bypasses the
nuclear power available curves intersect the engine
power required curve stably in the low speed region
The power plant behaves differently in each case
because of basic differences in the effect of each
throttling quantity on radiator performance

The power available from the reactor supplying
a number of balanced loads is related to the various
engine radiator and reactor parameter values by
the following expression

The first term in the power delivery expression

delivery curves rise with increasing speed at low
speeds At higher speeds however the effect of
the increase in radiator Inlet temperature pre
dominates (as the compressor outlet temperature
moves closer to the mean fuel temperature) and

the W, png product rises less rapidly These
effects cause power delivery to reach a peak and
begin to fall in the high speed range The increase
in radiator inlet temperature with increasing speed
thus causes the steady state power curves to inter
sect stably in both cases at high engine speeds
tn spite of the destabilizing effect of increasing
air flow with speed

The relative flatness of the curves showing the
variation of the power available with the NaK by
pass percentage constant at low speeds can be
explained from the W_ 5. plot in Fig 19 and
from Eq 4 the power delivered equation The
differences in the performance characteristics of
the air bypass and NaK bypass throttling arrange
ments lie in the behavior of the W_, 5, product
as engine arr flow changes since the (Tp , = T

73)
term varies with speed in the same way in both

cases The power delivery curves rise most
slowly with increasing speed when the W.pmg vs
W,p curves are flattest The destabilizing effect
of an engine air flow change on reactor power de
livery 1s minimized when the variation of W, pon
with changes in air flow 1s minimized

A study of Fig 19 leads to the conclusion that
W,png varies least with changes in air flow when
the air flow through the radiator is high and when
the percentage of NaK flowing through the bypass
1s large Both these requirements are met best
at part load points by the NaK bypass throttling
arrangement

The behavior of the NaK bypass throttled power
plant at 35000 ft and Mach 087 1s shown In
Fig 22 The very large amount of NaK bypassing
required to throttle the engines at this flight con
dition causes the nuclear power delivery curves

to be quite flat This bears out the conclusion
drawn in the preceding paragraph heavy flow of
NaK through the bypass results in flat power
delivery curves

All the nuclear power delivery variations con
sidered so far have been worked out for constant
fuel and NaK pump speeds It might be desirable
in the interests of simplicity to drive these pumps
at engine speed This aggravates the static
stability problem however since increasing the
pump speeds with engine speed causes power
delivery to rise faster with
speed than when the pump speeds are constant

increasing engine

The behavior of the NaK bypass throttied power
plant at SL static conditions when various com
binations of pumps are engine driven 1s shown in
Fig 23 (Pump flow rates were assumed to be
proportional to pump speed ) Driving one or more
pumps at speeds proportional to engine speed
destroys most of the apparent natural static sta
bility of the NaK bypass throttled power plant

Thus from steady state considerations It seems
that a turbojet—demand sensitive reactor combina
tion should operate stably in the high power range
At part load operating conditions however the
stability of such a power plant appears to depend

on the throttling scheme used Relatively speaking
use of a NaK bypass throttling arrangement seems
from steady state considerations at least to result
in more stable power plant operation than does
use of an air bypass throttling arrangement In the
example considered the NaK bypass throttled
power plant was stable at normal part load operating
points when the fuel and NaK pump speeds were
constant the air bypass throttled power
plant was not Whether or not a NaK bypass
throttled system will be stable in other power plant
combinations 1s difficult to say A detailed check
in each particular situation will no doubt be re
quired

If the *hucl®ar power source~turbojet engine load

while

combination 1s not inherently stable or if the
stability 1s not adequate the stability
characteristics can be improved by adding the
proper control equipment Static power plant
stability in the cases considered here for example
would be achieved if some sort of power level
system were added to the nuclear heat

source to maintain nuclear power delivery to each
engine constant at some preset adjustable value
The power available from the reactor would then
be independent of changes In engine speed or
air flow and compressor outlet temperatures and
the power available vs speed curves would be

If this lost power is to be regained the bypass on

Cross coupling between engines can be eliminated
by the addition of automatic control equipment
When the control rod position 1s constant and NaK

of the coupling effect does not appear to be great
enough to justify much complication of the control
system for its elimination If rod motion with

that independent manual power delivery adjustments

required

 

NUCLEAR POWER SOURCE CONTROL REQUIREMENTS

Automatic control requirements for the nuclear
heat source in a combination chemical nuclear
aircraft power plant of the type discussed in the
preceding sections can be determined by con
sidering how the flight engineer might perform
typical power plant maneuvers without the help
of automatic control equipment
altitudes flight speeds and ambient temperatures
at which such a power plant might be operated
can be grouped into three categories for purposes
of discussion those flight conditions at which
the radiators are (1) larger than they need be
(2) ust large enough and (3) too small to transfer
rated nuclear power to each engine If the radi
ators are designed to transfer rated nuclear power
to each engine at the nuclear cruise flight condition
{Mach 09 at 35000 ft in the example considered
here) excess radiator capacity 1s generally avail
able during flight at altitudes below the nuclear
cruise design altitude and the radiators will
generally be too small to transfer rated nuclear

The numerous

power to each engine during operation at altitudes
above the nuclear cruise design altitude

Manual operation of the nuclear part of the
reactor—-X 61 power plant in each of these situ
ations 1s described in the paragraphs which follow
Throttling by means of radiator NaK bypass valves
1s assumed and fuel and NaK flow rates are
assumed to be constant at their rated values
Startup and shutdown problems ground handling
problems and sodium coolant temperature control
problems are not considered

MANUAL OPERATION AT FLIGHT CONDITIONS
WHERE RADIATOR CAPACITY IS EXCESSIVE

The radiators will generally be large enough to
transfer more than rated nuclear power to each

engine load at altitudes below the design nuclear
cruise altitude Power plant maneuvers which
might be performed in this operating range include
engine startup operation on nuclear power only
and operation on chemical plus nuclear power

The engines will probably be started on chemical
power only The higher turbine inlet temperatures
obtainable with the chemical power sources should
result in the lowest possible engine firing speeds
and cranking powers The chemical power sources
are also more maneuverable than the nuclear power
source which probably will be advantageous during
the critical starting and accelerating period

Once the engines have been started nuclear
power delivery can be initiated by diverting NaK
through the engine radiators It 1s assumed that
the reactor has already been brought critical and
1s known to be delivering power at some low level
Care must be exercised in closing the NaK bypass
valves to avoid transient undercooling of the NaK
returning to the reactor Enough hot NaK must
be allowed to flow through the bypass valves to
ensure that the return line NaK temperatures will
remain above their lower limits at all times

Full closure of the NaK bypass valves is not
permissible even during steady state operation
at flight conditions where excess radiator capacity
1s available Rated nuclear power 1s delivered
to each engine in the reactor—-X 61 power plant
during static operation at sea level, for example
when only 45% of the total rated NaK flow passes
through the radiators (Figs 12 through 15) If
the NaK bypass valves ar fully closed at such
operating conditions exces. power demands will
be set up and return line NaK undercooling and
reactor fuel overheating will result

Care must also be exercised in opening the NaK

21
bypass valves to reduce nuclear power delivery
The return line NaK temperature should not be
allowed to rise above the value at which isothermal
idling of the reactor 1s desired when power de
livery has been reduced virtually to zero Limiting
the return line NaK temperature rise during load
removal ensures that the load will be removed
slowly enough to prevent reactor overheating

If the reactor design is such that the fuel tem
perature at the inlet of the reactor core must be
limited to some value less than the design point
mean fuel temperature control rod withdrawal is
required as nuclear power delivery 1s increased
Since the reactor fuel inlet temperature approaches
the mean fuel temperature as power delivery 1s
reduced the rod must be inserted to lower the
mean fuel temperature during operation at low
powers if the reactor fuel inlet temperature 1s
to be maintained below the design point mean fuel
temperature Subsequent rod withdrawal to raise
the mean fuel temperature to the design point
value cannot be initiated until some load has been
reapplied

If operation on chemical plus nuclear power Is
desired engine fuel flows and exhaust nozzle
areas must be controlled Control requirements
for the turbojet section of the power plant during
operation on chemical plus nuclear power will
not be considered here For purposes of this
discussion it is assumed that the automatic control
equipment required 1s available

Each time chemical power delivery to the engines
1s varied or the engine exhaust nozzle areas are
changed the rate of nuclear heat delivery will
also change The changes in compressor outlet
temperatures and in air flow resulting from the
changes in chemical fuel flows or nozzle areas
upset previously established heat transfer balances
in the radiators If nuclear power delivery 1s to
be held constant NaK bypasses must be readjusted
each time the engine thrust outputs are changed
during operation on chemical plus maximum nuclear
power

Continuous readjustment of the bypass valve
positions 1s also required if nuclear power delivery
1s to be maintained constant as the aircraft alt
tude and flight speed change since the engine
air flows and compressor outlet temperatures are
clso functions of the engine inlet total tempera
ture total pressure and flight Mach number The
demand sensitivity of the reactor makes continual

22

NaK bypass readjustment necessary if power de
livery 1s to be held constant as the load charac
teristics change Constant power delivery to a
turbojet load is not necessarily desirable except
when nuclear power only flight at the highest
speed possible is to be maintained Operation In
this manner will probably be required for a large
percentage of the time during typical missions

MANUAL OPERATION AT RADIATOR
DESIGN FLIGHT CONDITIONS

The manual control operations required in the
execution of typical power plant maneuvers at
flight conditions when the radiators are just large
enough to transfer rated nuclear power to each
engine are quite similar to those described in the
preceding section except that full closure of the
NoK bypass valves is now permissible during
steady state operation Return line NaK under
cooling and overheating must be guarded against
during transients but the radiators are not large
enough to cause undercooling during steady state
operation at such flight conditions Full nuclear
power delivery to each engine results when the
bypasses are fully closed Rod control require
ments are the same as those discussed in the
preceding section Rod withdrawal or insertion
during power level changes 1s required if the fuel
temperature at the inlet of the reactor core must
be held below the design point mean fuel tempera
ture

MANUAL OPERATION AT FLIGHT CONDITIONS
WHERE RADIATOR CAPACITY IS
INADEQUATE

Radiator capacity will be inadequate at some
flight conditions becouse the engine air flows
and compressor outlet temperatures are such that
the available heat transfer surface area 1s not
sufficient to transfer rated nuclear power During
dash for example only 71% of rated nuclear power
can be delivered to each engine in the X 61 power
plant even though the NaK bypasses are fully
closed and the mean reactor fuel temperature 1s
at its design point value This operating condition

1s described in Table 2

Since rated nuclear power 1s not being delivered
the fuel temperature at the outlet of the reactor
core 1s less than the 1600°F upper limit Some
increase In nuclear power delivery thus can be
effected by further withdrawal of the control rod

to raise this temperature The operating con
ditions described in the last column of Table 2
prevail after such action 1s taken Nuclear power
delivery to each engine is increased to 74% of
rated power and chemical fuel consumption 1s
reduced by about 22% under these conditions

If the fuel temperature at the inlet of the core
must be limited to 1350°F however rod withdrawal
to the extent shown in the last column of Table 2
1s not permissible and the potential advantages
to be gained in raising the mean fuel temperature
during operation at such a flight condition are
not so great as those described in this column

The discussion in the preceding paragraphs
leads to the conclusion that some sort of automatic
control equipment to raise the reactor mean fuel
temperature to its maximum allowable value during
operation at radiator himited flight conditions 1s
desirable but that equipment performing this
function alone 1s not essential to power plant
operation The potential advantages to be gained
do not appear to be great enough to justify much
complication of the control system unless such
equipment Is also needed for other reasons such
as controlling rod withdrawal during power in
creases

AUTOMATIC CONTROL REQUIREMENTS
DURING OPERATION IN THE
POWER RANGE

The foregoing discussion indicates that some
sort of automatic control equipment Is required
for the NaK bypasses Automatic control equip

ment 1s also required for the control rod if the
fuel temperature at the inlet of the reactor core
must be held below the design point mean fuel
temperature If the reactor can be designed to
operate 1sothermally at the design point mean fuel
temperature however a reasonably conventional
manual type rod control will probably suffice

Movement of the NaK bypasses must be limited
to maintain the return line NaK temperatures be
tween thew upper and lower limits at all times
The lower hmit for steady state operation 1s the
temperature at which rated nuclear power 1s de
livered to each engine The upper limit 1s the
temperature at which steady state isothermal re
actor idling 1s desired

In simplest form the controls for the NaK bypass
valves might be remote positioning servos with
return line NaK temperature overrides and under
rides to limit bypass valve openings to those
values that will result in temperatures in the safe
range Further studies of reactor and engine con
trol integration may show that a more complex
arrangement 1s needed

If the reactor cannot be operated i1sothermally at
the design point mean fuel temperature rod inser
tion with power reduction 1s required to limit the
core inlet fuel temperature rise Rod withdrawal
with increasing power delivery is required either
to restore the mean fuel temperature to its design
point value or to raise the reactor fuel outlet
temperature to its maximum value The discussion
in the preceding section showed that a slight
advantage would be gained during the dash if the

rod were withdrawn to raise the fuel outlet tem
perature to its maximum value rather than to raise
the mean temperature to its design point value
Hence one simple type of rod control for the
reactor—X 61 power plant would be one which
operates as follows
1 withdraws the rod if the reactor core fuel inlet
temperature 1s less than 1345°F and the reactor
core fuel outlet temperature is less than 1590°F
2 inserts the rod if the reactor core fuel inlet
temperature exceeds 1355°F or the reactor
core fuel outlet temperature exceeds 1600°F

The basic form of such a control system is out
lined in Fig 25 Further study may show that
additional stabilizing signals are required but
this question will not be considered here The
diagram 1s intended to be schematic only and
does not necessarily represent the best way to
do the job

The fuel temperatures resulting from the use
of such a control scheme are shown in Fig 26
Either the core fuel inlet temperature or the core
fuel outlet temperature 1s held at its upper limit
at all times Operation with the fuel outlet tem
perature at its maximum value 1s possible only
when power delivery exceeds 83 4% of the rated
value The fuel inlet temperature limiting require
ment does not allow the maximum fuel outlet
temperature to be reached when power delivery Is
less than 83 4% of rated power

RADIATOR DESIGN PROCEDURE

The basic radiator unit from which the engineradiators discussed in this report were composed,

5 Next a number of the basic radiator units are stacked to provide
the required frontal area Four units are needed in this example
Since each basic unit contains 776 12 of heat transfer area the
stacked array contains 3104 ft2 of heat transfer surface The array
must therefore be lengthened to provide the required over all heat &

transfer surface Since a 6 67 in deep stacked unit contains 3104 12

and since 9018 ft2 is required the depth must be increased to

The pressure drop can be estimated by multiplying the calculations
of Schultheiss by the proper ratios Under the following operating
conditions

W,

 

= 579 Ib/sec ft2 p = 00434 radiator depth = 6 67 in
fR

Schulthess has calculated that the pressure drop of this type of radiator 1s
AP, = 285m H,0

At other operating conditions the pressure drop is estimated to be

AP, = 285 Wa/4 1k 0 0434 \ [radiator depth

For the G E X 61 case

 

AP, = 8216 in H,O = 4268 Ib/ft2

At the design point (described in step 1) this pressure drop 1s (426 8/6470) = 6 6% of the com
pressor discharge pressure The same procedure was used in assembling the hypothetical Allison
J 71 radiators

 
APPENDIX B

STEADY STATE PERFORMANCE CALCULATIONS

Control parameter values required to yield given engine thrust outputs during steady state
operation at specified flight conditions can be determined by working backwards through the
engine and reactor performance characteristics The engine load imposed on the reactor (as
described by power compressor outlet temperature turbine inlet temperature and airflow) is first
determined from Figs 2 through 5 When these load quantities are known and when values for all
but one of the unknown potential throttling quantities are specified the value which the remaining
unknown throttling quantity must have in order to meet the load conditions can then be calculated
by use of one of the procedures outlined below For purposes of tllustration it 1s assumed in
each case that the throttling quantity value required to deliver 4000 Ib of thrust output per engine
during flight at 15 000 ft at a speed of Mach 0 45 is to be determined

Example 1 «~ Control Rod Throttling
The engine load quantities resulting when 4000 lb of thrust 1s delivered during flight at
15 000 ft and Mach 0 45 are (from Figs 2 through 5)

Trg = 411°F W_ = 157 Ib/sec Tr, = 931°F

Effectiveness values for both the heat exchanger and the engine radiators will be required for

calculation of the unknown quantities Te, Tey Tepe Tyy Tne These effectiveness values

Twice the power delivered to one engine 1s used in the above expression since reactor power

delivery to two engine loads has been assumed

Thus +f 4000 Ib of thrust 1s to be delivered by each engine during flight at 15000 ft and
Mach 0 45 the control rod must be set to lower the mean fuel temperature to 1051°F if throttling

is to be by means of control rod motion alone

Example 2 —~ Reactor Fuel Flow Throttling

The engine load quantities at the 15000 ft Mach 0 45 4000 Ib thrust output flight condition
were given in the preceding example The radiator effectiveness in this case 1s also the same

as the effectiveness calculated in example 1 (ng = 0768) since the air and NaK flow rates are

the same It 1s assumed in this example that the control rod is adjusted to hold the mean fuel

Since P_ is known from the engine load requirements and 7, Is a function of Wp (since the
NaK flow rate 1s constant) the above expression might be solved directly for W_ However the
complexity of the 5, to Wy relationship makes solution by trial and error more attractive One
procedure for solving this equation involves assuming a value for W calculating the associated
value of 5, and calculating a value for P, The process 1s repeated until the calculoted power

(Tg v © Tra)
NeCnN - 1/2XW Cp.
Condition 1 =~ Variation of steady state power delivery with changes in engine speed when
reactor control quantities are constant and throttling 1s by air bypass with pump speeds constant

In this case the quantities listed below are constant at the values shown in the reactor-J 71
engine power plant

Myx = 08 X =025
Wy, = 1422 1b/sec Wg = 702 Ib/sec
Cy = 025Bt/Ib°F Cp = 027 Bt/Ib °F

Substitution of these values into Eq C 1 yields

The W, png product is a function of the total engine air flow which is a funchon of speed
(Fig 7) and the air bypass percentage The variation of W, png with W_ at rated NaK flow 1s
shown in Fig 21 Steady state compressor outlet temperature variation with speed 1s shown in

Fig 7 Substhtution of values for W,pnhg and T..; at each speed into Eq C 2 yields the power
delivery curves of Fig 20

Condition 2 = Vanation of steady state power delivery with changes in engine speed when

reactor control quantities are constant throttling 1s by NaK bypass and all pump speeds are
constant

Equation C2 applies in this case also The value for W_, is the same as that for W, (the
total engine air flow) Variations of the W, png product with W_o at constant NaK bypass per
centages are shown in Fig 21 The variations of T..; and W, with engine speed are shown in

Fig 7 Substitution of these values into Eq C 2 yields the constant NaK bypass power delivery
curves of Fig 19

Condition 3 = Variation of steady state power delivery with changes in engine speed when
reactor control quantities are constant throttling 1s by NaK bypass and one or more pump
speeds are proportioned to engine speed

Equation C 1 applies to this case The value for Wp 1s equal to that for W, (the total engine
air flow) the variation of Wn, with radiator air flow 1s shown in Fig 21 variations of W, and
T 3; with engine speed are shown in Fig 7 and heat exchanger effectiveness values are calcu
lated from the fuel and NaK flow rates and the heat exchanger effectiveness equation given on
page 29

In calculating the power delivery curves of Fig 23 it was furthermore assumed that the mean
fuel temperature T. was held constant at 1450°F at all times by rod motion if necessary

36

 
and that the pump flows were proportional to the pump speeds Thus

F = Sea0

Substitution of these expressions into Eq C1 yields the desired relationship between power
delivery and engine speed which 1s plotted for various pump drive combinations in Fig 23
