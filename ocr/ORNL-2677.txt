ABSTRACT

The basic physical properties and thermodynamic constants of aluminum chloride have been
calculated to obtain the data required for engineering calculations of thermodynamic cycles
employing aluminum chloride vapor. The possible corrosion problems involved were evaluated
from the standpoint of basic chemical thermodynamics, and it was concluded that high-nickel-
content alloys would contain aluminum chloride satisfactorily.

The advantages of gaseous aluminum chloride as an intermediate heat transfer medium in a
molten-salt-fueled reactor were evaluated. It was determined that the temperature range of the
molten-salt heat transfer system was too low to utilize aluminum chloride effectively. A gas
turbine cycle employing aluminum chloride as the working fluid and a binary vapor cycle employing
water vapor for the lower temperature cycle were also considered. Neither of these studies showed
aluminum chloride to have outstanding advantages. It is believed, however, that special appli-

cations may be found in which it will be possible to exploit the unique characteristics of aluminum

chloride.

 

INTRODUCTION

Gaseous aluminum chloride appears to be attrac
tive as a heat transfer medium and as a thermo-
dynamic-cycle working fluid as a consequence of
the fact that it exists as the monomer AICI, aot
high temperatures and as the dimer AlCl, at low
temperatures. The effective specific heat and
thermal conductivity of a gas that associates are
considerably enhanced because of the association
equilibrium at temperatures at which there is an
appreciable fraction of both monomer and polymer,
and therefore aluminum chloride may be an excep-
tionally good heat transfer medium for some
applications. Its possibilities as the working
fluid in a thermodynamic cycle stem from the fact
that, in an idealized gas turbine with a negligible
pressure drop in the system, the pump compressor
will require work proportional to the compressor
inlet temperature times the specific gas constant
of the dimer for any given pressure ratio. In the
high-temperature region at the turbine, on the other
hond,
same weight of gas will do work proportional to
the turbine inlet temperature times the monomer
gas constant for the same pressure ratio. Because

if the gas is completely monomeric, this

of the relatively large difference in the gas constant
between the monomer and dimer, the ratio of
turbine work to compressor work will be greater
than for a gas that does not dissociate. Further,
the energy losses due to the inefficiency of both
the compressor and the turbine will have relatively
smaller effects on the over-all thermal efficiency
with a dissociating gos as the working fluid.

BASIC PHYSICAL PROPERTIES OF
ALUMINUM CHLORIDE

The objective of this study was to investigate
the possible advantages of aluminum chloride
arising from its dissociation and the consequent
increase in effective specific heat and thermal
conductivity. Qualitatively the reason for these
increases is simple. Lowering the temperature of
the gas will yield not only the heat given off if
the composition of the gas were ‘‘frozen,”’ but,
since the gas is more highly associated at lower
temperatures, it will also give off the chemical
heat due to the association of some of the monomer
molecules as a result of lowering the temperature.
The same phenomenon increases the thermal
conductivity. The thermal conductivity is the
amount of heat that would be transferred in unit
time across unit area from a temperature T + dT
to T divided by the temperature gradient, d7/dx.
The frozen thermal conductivity is that which
would occur if the composition were frozen at an
average weight fraction w_ of the polymer and w,
of the monomer at both temperatures. Since w,
is higher at T + dT and w,_ is higher at T than the
average, relatively more monomer would diffuse
from T + dT to T and more polymer from T to T +dT
than for a frozen composition. The composition
of the higher-temperature gas molecules diffusing
to the lower temperature would change with a
trend toward the lower equilibrium concentration
of monomer at the lower temperature and would
give off heat in the process. This chemical heat
contribution is part of the heat flux.

Quantitative expressions for these phenomena

Effective Specific Heat

The effective specific heat was calculated by
use of Eq. (1). The frozen specific heat of ALCL,
C,, was estimated according to well-known

pr . 2
statistical mechanical methods® by use of the
infrared vibrational frequencies measured or esti-
mated by Klemperer.® The frequencies for ACT,
were estimated by analogy with the compound
BCI, (ref 4). The average value of the specific
heat in the temperature range 500 to 1000°K is
0.16 cal-g™'.(°C)=' for AlCl, and is 0.14
calig™ (°C)! for AICI. At each composition
of the gas, an average value was computed from
the composition-weighted average of these two
values for the monomer and the dimer.

THERMODYNAMIC PROPERTIES

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

In the gaseous phase the state of an equilibrium
mixture of AlCl, and AICI; is determined by any
two independent properties, and knowledge of the
thermodynamic state makes it possible to determine
the thermodynamic properties. The two independent
defining properties used to calculate weight
fraction of monomer, enthalpy, entropy, and specific

volume were temperature and pressure. The
relations used in the computational procedure are
summarized below.

solid, AICI will disproportionate according to
reaction C, and a small concentration of aluminum
will deposit on the surface of the alloy. After a
small activity of aluminum is built up in the metal,
the reaction at the low-temperature zone should
be the reverse of reaction B, with chromium metal
being deposited on the walls. At the hot zone,
after the surface chromium has been depleted, the
reaction will be limited by the diffusion of chro-
mium from the interior of the metal to the surface.
If reaction B is important, this diffusion of chro-
mium to the surface at the hot zone will probably
be the rate-controlling step in the transport of
chromium metal from the hot to the cold zone.

emphasized that these are crude estimates based
on a limited amount of data of varying degrees of

made to make these estimates conservative, some
of the estimates should be checked experimentally.

ENGINEERING PROBLEMS OF SOME
TYPICAL APPLICATIONS

Where aluminum chloride vapor is used as a
working fluid in a thermodynamic cycle or as a
heat transfer medium, the pressures and tempera-
tures must be carefully chosen to exploit to the
fullest the extra performance obtainable from
dissociation. Normally a temperature range will
be defined by the structural strength of the metals
in the system or by other considerations, such as
corrosion, so that the only variable available to
the designer will be the pressure. This means
that the pressure level must be chosen with care
to give the best over-all system design. If is
likely that it will be necessary to compromise the
design of other components if the fullest benefits
are to be derived from the use of aluminum chloride.

Aluminum Chloride as a Heat Transfer Medium

A typical application for which aluminum chleride

may have promise is as an intermediate heat

21
transfer fluid between the fluoride fuel of a molten-
salt-fueled reactor and the steam generator. The
use of a gas rather than a liquid in the intermediate
loop would facilitate removal of the heat transfer
medium; it would not be necessary to design the
system to avoid the presence of low spots which
present scavenge
problems. It would make possible the placing of
flanged joints in cool zones at the top of the

would difficult drainage or

system and outside of the heat exchanger pressure
envelope so that leaks of the molten fuel into the
aluminum chloride would be contained within the
pressure envelope. The pressure required, namely,
20 to 60 psi in the aluminum chloride, would

design of the containing vessel. From Fig. 4,
which is a plot of data obtained from Eq. (7), it
is evident thot there would be no solid aluminum
chloride precipitated at the temperatures and
pressures prevailing in a molten-salt-fueled re-
actor. . Aluminum chloride would have the ad-
vantage as a heat transfer fluid that it would

be chemically inert relative to either the molten
salt or water. This would make it desirable from
the hazards standpoint and would give a system
relatively insensitive to leaks between any two
sets of fluid; that is, a small leak from one
system into another would not lead to the formation
of a set of deposits which would be very difficult
to remove. It would be necessary, of course, to
make the steam generator, as well as the fuel
to—aluminum chloride heat exchanger, of arelatively
expensive high-nickel-content alloy.

The principal disadvantage of this arrangement
is that it would require a larger amount of heat
transfer surface area and a higher pumping power
than would be the case for an inert molten salt,
for example. However, it would have a major
advantage in that there would be no freezing
problem in the intermediate heat exchanger circuit,
The freezing problem presents exceedingly dif-
ficult design problems if a fluid such as sodium
or NaK is employed as the intermediate heat
transfer medium.

The temperature range for such an application
is lower than is desirable in that the heat transfer
surfaces for the molten salt would be at about
1100 to 1200°F, while those inthe steam generator
would be at 700 to 1000°F. As may be seen in
Fig. 1, this temperature range is below that which
gives the maximum obtainable average effective
specific heat if the pressure is maintained high
enough (30 to 100 psi) to keep pumping losses to
acceptable levels.

Aluminum Chioride Vapor in a Gas-Turbine Cycle

The features of a gas-turbine cycle utilizing
aluminum chloride deserve special attention. The
cycle contemplated is indicated schematically in
Fig. 5. The pressures and temperatures should
be chosen so that the gas will be mostly in the
form of AlCl, during compression, while during
the expansion process it will be mostly AICI.

The diagrams of Fig. 6 were prepared for ideal

important of these losses are associated with the
efficiencies of the compressor and the turbine,
which are likely to be of the order of 85%. This
means that, with an 85% efficient compressor, the
ideal work input will be 85% of the actual work
input, while the actual work output of the turbine
will be only 85% of the ideal. In addition, pressure

If allowances are made for these losses to
obtain the actual net outputs for the cycles of

large work input required for the compression
process of the Brayton cycle makes the cycle
efficiency very sensitive to compressor inlet
temperature because the compression work in-
creases rapidly with temperature. As a result, the
net work output and over-all cycle efficiency of
the Brayton cycle drop off so rapidly with in-
creasing temperature at the compressor inlet that,

temperature must be held below 150°F if con-
ventional working fluids are used. At the same
time, the turbine inlet temperature must be at
least 1200°F, and preferably should be above
1400°F if there is to be an appreciable positive
net area for the P-V diagram.

The unusual properties of aluminum chloride
make it possible to go to higher compressor inlet
temperatures than with other fluids. The effects
of variations in both the compressor inlet tempera-
ture and the compressor pressure ratio are indicated
in Fig. 9 for a turbine inlet temperature of 1540°F,
While this temperature is high by steam power
plant standards, the much lower pressures in the
aluminum chloride system reduce stresses suf-
ficiently to compensate for most of the temperature
difference. In any event, it is necessary to go to
peak temperatures in this range to take full ad-
vantage of the unusual properties of the aluminum
chloride. It is evident from Fig. 9 that the aluminum
chloride vapor cycle should be designed for a
compressor inlet temperature of around 540 to
640°F and a pressure ratio of 20 to 40. Further
lowering of the compressor inlet temperature will
do little to enhance efficiency, since ai 540°F
most of the gas is in the dimer state already.

A point of interest is that it was found in the
cycle analysis that during the compression and
expansion processes there was little change in
the percentage of the gas dissociated. This will
simplify the design of compressors and turbines
for such an application.

The heat transfer coefficient for the aluminum
chloride is sufficiently high for the high-pressure
portion of the cycle, and therefore good heat
transfer could be obtained in a reactor core. In
the cooler, however, the heat transfer performance
of the aluminum chloride would be poor, and a
large surface area would be required. The poor
heat transfer coefficient of aluminum chloride in
the cocler stems from the fact that the pressure
at the turbine outlet would be only approximately
1/10 atm, and this would give a low Reynolds
number. The pressure ahead of the turbine, on
the other hand, would be 20 to 40 times greater,
which would give heat transfer coefficients corre-
spondingly higher.

coolant or as an intermediate heat transfer fluid

for a molten-salt-fueled reactor, it appears that a
binary vapor cycle employing aluminum chloride
in the high-temperature portion and water vapor in
the lower-temperature region ought to be con-
sidered. Such a cycle would resemble in many
ways the binary mercury vapor—steam cycle which
has been used in a number of U.S. power plants.
It would have the advantage that it would permit
operation at high temperatures (which would be
advantageous from the thermodynamic standpoint)
while avoiding the expense associated with the
high pressures characteristic of high-temperature
steom cycles. While there are a host of different
combinations of conditions that might be employed,

a typical cose is presented in Table 5. The
aluminum chloride would be expanded through a
turbine similar to that described above. The
cooler for the aluminum chloride would also serve
as the boiler and superheater for the steam sys-
tem. It may be seen from Table 5 that this system
gives a very much higher over-all thermal efficiency
than is obtainable from the gas-turbine cycle
alone. A corresponding steam system designed
for a pressure of 2400 psi ond a peak temperature
out of the superheater of 1050°F would give an
over-all thermal efficiency of obout 38%, some-
what less than the efficiency that the typical
binary vapor cycle chosen would attain.

CONCLUSIONS

Thermodynamic data have been prepared and are
presented in the form of tables and charts to
facilitate engineering calculations on systems
employing aluminum chloride vapor either as a
heat transfer medium or as the working fluid in a
thermodynamic cycle. A number of typical appli-
cations have been considered, but in none of these

26

has the aluminum chloride shown outstanding
advantages over more conventional media. How-
ever, it is believed that for some special appli-
cations it may well prove to have some outstanding
advantages where the characteristics of the other
system components are such as to make it possible
to exploit to the fullest the unique characteristics
of aluminum chloride.
