DESIGN, CONSTRUCTION, AND TESTING OF A LARGE MOLTEN SALT FILTER

R. B. Lindauer and C. XK. McGlothlan

ABSTRACT

The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment uses mixtures of fluoride salts
as fuel. Routine on-site processing of these molten salts results in
formation of corrosion products. This report describes development,
design, construction, installation, and testing of a large salt filter to
remove these corrosion products. The filter is designed to remove
approximately 15 kilograms of corrosion products from 9000 kilograms of
flush and fuel salt at a temperature of 1200°F.

 

INTRODUCTION

The fuel in the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is a molten
mixture of fluoride salts (LiF, BeFp, ZrFy, and UFy). The UF, required
for criticality is less than one mole percent of the mixture. The MSRE,

a forerunner of breeders operating in the thorium-233y cycle, started up
with 235y, sufficient 233U later became availeble and the experimental
program of the reactor was expanded to include operation with this fissile
material.;2 The changeover involved stripping the original UF, from the

other fluorides (carrier salt) by the fluoride volatility process, in an

on-site processing plent,” then sdding Z33UF,-LiF as required.
The fluorination of the salt is accompanied by. formation of corrosion-

product fluorides which, if left in the carrier salt, would interfere with

the routine monitoring of - corrosion during reactor operation. In principle,
the corrosion products could be removed simply by reducing them to in-
soluble metallic form, then filtering the molten salt. A problem was the
filter. Small sintered-metal filters had been used extensively to filter
 

 

molten selts at temperatures to 1200°F, but the design of a filter for
this high temperature and large enough to handle around 15 kg of corrosion
products in 9000 kg of salt was & different order of magnitude. This
report tells how such a filter was successfully developed and used. - It
describes the concept, development tests, final design, construction,
installation, and operation.

DESIGN CRITERIA

Physical layout of the System

Figure 1 shows the piping layout of the filter, storage and processing
tanks. The salt inlet line of the filter is about 6 ft higher in elevation
than the maximum salt level in the. processing tank. From the bottom of
the filter the molten salt drains by gravity to the storage tanks, about
20 ft below in another cell,

Sequence of Operations

Two TO~ft> batches of salt were to be processed — the flush salt
and the fuel salt. Salt properties are given in Table 1. The operation
was to begin with transfer of an entire salt batch, by helium gas pressure
from one of the storage tanks, through the filter to the processing tank.
At this time the salt should contain essentially no solids and should
back-flow through the clean filter element with very little pressure drop.

The salt was to be sparged with gaseous fluorine to convert the UF,
to volatile UFg which leaves the salt to be collected on NaF. During this
fluorinetion corrosion of the Hastelloy-N(2) vessel would produce NiFp,
FeFp, and CrFp, all of which are soluble in the salt. - Since these

soluble fluorides would interfere with corrosion monitoring during re-

actor operation, they would have to be removed from the salt. The NiF2 ‘
would be reduced by hydrogen sparging to metallic nickel and the FeFo

and CrFz would be reduced with pressed zirconium metal shavings to Fe .
and Cr metal, The salt batch would then be filtered to remove these

precipitated metals before being sent to the salt storage tanks.

Quantities of Corrosion Products to be Handled

Since salt of this composition had never been fluorinated in plant-
scale equipment the exact corrosion rate was not known. However, because
of the smaller surface /volume ratio it wes expected that corrosion would
be less than the 0.5 mil/hr experienced in small scale work.

Assuming a corrosion rate of 0.1 mil /hr and a total fluorine sparge
time (flush + fuel salt) of TO hours, it was estimated that 15 kg of J

corrosion products as metal would be produced. One filter element should

heve sufficient volume on the upstream side of the filter media for this
weight of metal if the bulk density is not lower than 50% of the solid
metal density. A large safety factor in the filter capacity was the

large amount of metals remaining as sediment in the feed tank during small

scale filter tests.

Pressure Drop

The filter element must withstand a pressure differential of 18 psig
tending to collapse the filter during filtration. This is 150% of the
minimum pressure at the end of the filtration when the transfer gas
pressure releases through the loaded filter.

The filter element must also withstand a pressure differential of
30 psig tending to burst the filter medias during transfer to the processing
tank, This is 150% of the salt head from the bottom of the storage tank

“to the filter element.

Temperature
The filter element must have the required strength at 1200°F, which

is the maximum expected temperature during selt trensfer. .
Pressure | |

The maximum pressure on the filter housing will be 30 psig.

The filter element must be replaceable by remote maintenance in

~ EXPERIMENTAL PROGRAM

~The selection of & high-temperature filter media for molten salt is
limited to materials that have high-temperature strength, corrosion re-
sistance in molten salt, and adequate filtration efficiency. The tempera-
ture and corrosion requirements limit the material selection to high-nickel

alloys such as Inconel and Hastelloy-N. Inconel was chosen because of

 
 

6

availability. To select the type and size of filter medie that would

~~ satisfactorily remove the corrosion products expected in fluorination of

the MSRE fuel end flush salts required an experimentel progrem.* The
experimentel progrem was composed of two parts. In the first part,

molten salt was prepared to simulete the conditions expected after fluori-
nation of the MSRE fuel salt. The second. part consisted of selt-filtration
tests of two types of filter media under conditions which epproximated
those anticipated in the reactor application.

Reduction of Corrosion Products Fluorides
~

The experimental program was cerried out with a 104-kg batch of the
fluoride mixture, LiF-BeFo-ZrF, (65 - 30 - 5 mole %) which was prepared
from the component fluoride salts by routine production procedures. After
treatment to remove oxygen and sulphur impurities, CrFp, FeFo, and NiFo
were added to the salt mixture to simulate the conditions expected after
fluorination of the MSRE fuel salt. The salt mixture was hydrofluorinated
to insure complete dissolution of the corrosion product fluorides.
Analysis of & filtered sample of the salt taken after dissolution is
compared with expected concentrations in Table 2.

The NiF2 in the selt mixture was reduced with a hydrogen sparge and
the gas effluent periodicelly analyzed for HF. Since equilibrium data
produced very low hydrogen utilizetion during reduction of FeFz and CrFa,
dete were obtained on reduction of these fluorides with pressed zirconium
metal turnings added to the salt mixture. Analysis of filtered samples
teken neer the conclusion of the zirconium addition period are also shown
in Teble 2,

Salt Filtration Studies

Filtration tests were conducted using LO-j pore size sintered porous
nickel (Micro Metallics Corp.) and two grades (20 and kl-j pore size) of
sintered fiber metal (Huyck Metals Co.). Each filter was fabricated as &
2-5/8—in, diemeter plate so that geometric surface areas of all filters
would be identicel.

The experimental assembly used for the filtration tests was essenti-
ally that used for the routine production of fluoride mixtures. Tests were

made under static conditions by allowing the melt to remain quiescent for
a minimum time of 4 hours prior to transfer, and also made by rapidly
sparging the melt with helium just prior to salt transfer et 650°C. The
pressure drop across the filter varied from 22.5 to 20.8 psi &s the level
of salt in: the treatment vessel decreased. A summery of the filtration
tests is shown in Table 3.

The fiber metal medie (designed FM-250 by the manufacturer) which had
& porosity of 78% and a stated removal efficiency of 98% for particles
larger than 10 microns in diemeter was recommended for the MSRE., Fil-
tration times for this material were about 1.19 end 1.36 hours per cubic
foot of salt mixture (Runs 7 and 4). The occasional plugging of the
filter in Tests LU and 5 suggests that the loading cepacity of the 4Q-micron
filters may be about 50 to 75 grams of metal particles or about 9 to 14
grams per square inch of filter surface.

Samples of the salt mixture were taken before the first filtration
experiment and downstream from the filter plate after Tests k, 6, and T.
Analysis of these samples are given in Table 4, Only 1.8 to 3.4% of
metals reduced from solution passed through the FV-250 fiber metal media.

It was concluded that the FM-250 fiber metel medie would filter as
well as the porous metal media that had been used successfully to filter
small batches of the original salt loadings for the MSRE and was less
susceptible to plugging.

Stresses in the vessel are due to the 35-psig internal pressure and

the axial temperature gradient along the vessel from the heated section

at 1200°F through a 25-in, insulated section and a T-1/2-in. bare metal
section at 200°F on the end. The axial temperature gradient causes dis-
continuity stresses because of the resulting differential radial expansion
of the vessel.

The temperature gradient was determined through the use of the "Astra
Heating" computer program at approximately l+in. increments for the
32.5-in, on length outside the heated zone. The maximum temperature
differential of 56°F per linear inch is near the heated zone at the
highest temperature and lowest allowable stress. There is no tempersa-
ture gradient across the wall of the pipe so there are no radial thermal
stresses.

The sum of the stresses due to pressure and the temperature gradient
are less than three times the Code allowable stress for primery stresses,

so the design is therefore satisfactory.
Filter Element Design

In small scale batch operations, sintered porous nickel filters
have been used successfully as reported earlier. However, it was decided
to investigate the use of fiber metal filter media for possible improve-
ment in capacity. Although experimental tests did not show any signifi-
cant improvement in performance, it was decided to use the fiber metal
because of its adaptability and availability to fabrication requirements.

(A cylindrical porous filter would have to be fabricated by the manu-

facturer.) Inconel was chosen as the material of construction not only

_ because of its strength at elevated temperature, but also because of its

_corrosion resistance to molten salt.

Both the burst (from internal pressure) and the collapse strength
.of the inner and outer filter elements were considered in the design of
the filter element. Design deta are given in Table 5. The burst
strength 1s important only during back flow when transferring selt to the
processing tank. The formula®

_ 2st
Pp Tale

 

was used in the calculation where s is the tensile strength of the fiber
metal at 1200°F.

§ = ES x 8 (fiber metal @ 100°) = 22.388 x 800 = 571 psi.
The outer filter element was calculated to have a burst strength of 25 psi
and the inner filter 34 psi with no safety factor. The worst conceiveble
case would be if the filter element were almost completely restricted from
the flush salt filtration and the fuel salt was then transferred to the
processing tank. Since the burst strength of the outer element is less
then the 30 psig specified in the design criterias, the buoyency of the
filter in the salt on transfer to the processing tank is necessary for
the filter to meet the burst strength requirement. The filter element
has a weight of 57 lbs and a horizontal area of 25 in.2, Construction
details are shown on Drawing E-NN-D-49038 and Figures 2 and 3. A pressure
of only 2.3 psi will therefore ceuse flotation of the element and by-
passing of salt through the seat. This pressure is further reduced by
the buoyancy of the element so there is no danger of rupture of the ele-
ment if the filter is above the melting point of the salt. |

To prevent collepse of the filter element it was necessary to provide
a perforated back-up plete against the inner filter surface. The maximum
external pressure is applied to the filter at the end of filtration when
the transfer gas pressure blows into the gas space above the filter ele-
ment. At this time there will also be the maximum restriction of the
filter from collected solids. In calculating the collapse strength, the

2.

formula? ps = rE was used where E is the modulus of elasticity,

ratio (0.3). E for thesfiber metal is 1.75%-of solid Inconel and is
3.5 x 10° psi @ 1200°F. Considering the fiber metal without the backup,
the outer element has a collepse strength of only 6.5 psi and the inner
element 16.3 psi without a safety factor. Since the minimum final trans-.
fer pressure is 12 psi for the fuel salt (without any flow AP), it is
evident that a backup is required. An 0.078-in. thick Inconel perforated
sheet with 32% open area was used 8s & backup because of availebility.
This plate alone has a collapse strength (for the larger element) of
131 psi. To provide a safety factor of 4 the operating procedure speci-
fies a maximum transfer plus gas space pressure of 35 psi.

The filter element can move upward during salt back-flowing and
by-pass salt through the seat, but it has to reseal after flotation to

"minimize leakage in the main direction of salt flow. Mating spherical

seating surfaces are provided between the filter element and pressure

vessel for ease in self-sealing.
Electric Heater Design

Electric heaters are provided to permit preheating of the filter and
to maintain the temperature of the salt during a transfer. Maintenance

requirements are minimized by designing the heaters with excess capacity

- 80 they can be operated at reduced voltage to promote longer life. Also

duplicate spare heaters are installed and connected ready for use with
only minor, out-of-cell wiring changes. The tubular heaters are 0.315-in.
OD Inconel sheath with nichrome elements rated 500 watts per foot of
heater. A layer of stainless steel shim stock is installed between the
heaters and the thermal insulation to prevent the heaters from being in
direct contact with the insulation,

" The controls that are used limit the available installed capacity
to 3500 watts; 2400 watts in the lower control (FSF-1) and 1000 watts in
the upper control (FSF-2). (See Drawing E-NN-D-49036.) Control of the
electricel input to the heaters is from manuel powerstats. The voltage
setting required was determined during startup testing, and manual stops
were set to limit the controls to hold the temperature to 1300°F or below.

‘During startup testing, 1600 watts for the lower section and 500 watts for
 

18

the upper section were required to preheat the filter. Only the heaters
on the lower section are required for normal transfer of salt. If salt
freezes in the upper section of the filter because of unforeseen 4iffi-
culties, heaters on the upper control will be used to preheat this

section,
Instrumentation Design

A helium supply is provided and instrumented to assure the presence
~ of & ges cushion in the filter at all times and to purge the connecting
lines with helium before filtration. Temperature instruments are pro-
vided both to indicete that the equipment is above the salt melting point
and as an indication of salt level. oo |
Figure 4 shows the helium supply to the filter. The solenoid valve
1s interlocked with the salt freeze valves to prevent the accidental
pressuring of molten salt from a salt storage tank to the reactor by
helium through the filter. Accidental filling of the reactor is further
prevented by the pressure control valve limiting the pressure to 15 psig —
sufficient to fill the reactor only 1/2 full — and the flow restrictor
‘which would limit the salt trensfer rate to 5 liters per minute —— only
"30% of the normal reactor fill rate. The check valves prevent back-flow
of radioactive gases to the operating area. PI-B indicates the pressure
in the gas space above the filter element. This pressure is transmitted
to the operating area by a transmitter contained in a cubicle vented to
the processing cell. |
Temperatures are monitored by eleven thermocouples attached to the
outer wall of the filter housing. Nine of these are read out on a
O - 2000°F recorder. The other two (at the same elevation as Points 7
and 9) are connected to temperature switches which actuate annunciators ’
and provide interlock contacts in the pressurization and vent valve
control circuits. Since the upper heater will be normelly off, tempera-
ture points 5, 6, 7, 8, and 9 will be heated only by conduction unless
the salt level rises higher than normal. If this occurs there will be an
- alarm and the pressurization valve will close when point T reaches 1000°F. =
" When point 9 reaches 350°F there will be an elrm, the pressurization valve -

FABRICATION

Procurement of Materials

All selt-containing parts are fabricated from Inconel-600 materiel,

Pipe, fitting, and plate were purchased from vendors eccording to ap-
" pliceble Americen Society for Testing and Materials Specifications®

with certified chemical and physical properties. After receipt in ORNL,

the material received addition liquid ‘penetrant® end ultrasonic inspection, ©
This inspection is routinely given material used to fabricate MSRE equip-
ment that will contain high-temperature radioactive gases and fluids.

This additional inspection is considered partial insurance against equip-

ment failure and the need for expensive and time-consuming remote

wn

me.intenance,
The filter media (sintered Inconel fibers) was purchased in 18 x .

20-inch sheets from Huyck Metals Company. This special meteriel was

selected and purchased after numerous consultations with the vendor about

its unique design properties.

Shop Fabrication

The filter housing and element were fabricated in Osk Ridge National
Laboratory shops from Drawings E-NN-D-49036, E-NN-D-49037, and E-NN-D-49038.
High quality nuclear fabrication specifications and techniques that met
or exceeded the requirements for Class "C" vessels of Section III of the
ASME "Pressure Vessel Code" were used to fabricate the filter. Forming
and welding of the fibrous Inconel filter-media metall! required the de-
velopment of special febrication techniques. Special procedures were also
utilized to prevent the filter-media from becoming contaminated with
foreign material during fabrication.

Welds?! of all Inconel pressure-containing parts were liquid-penetrent oO
inspected® and radiographed.1?® Other Inconel welds received liquid-penetrant |

inspection. Welds of the fibrous metal filter-media were visually in-
spected. All welding was performed by welders qualified in the weld pro-
cedures specified on the drawings.

A pneumatic test was performed on the pressure vessel, without the

filter element, as specified in ASME Code. The inner core can of the

filter element was pneumatically tested at 100 psig to insure against
failure at operating pressure and temperature.

After pneumatic tests, the pressure vessel and inner core can of the
filter element were separately leak-tested by evacuating the inside and
flooding the outside with helium, Helium leakage to the inside was less
than 1 x 108 ce/sec of both subassemblies,

A polydispersed aerosol, dioctylphthalate (DOP) was forced through
the fibrous metal filter element at various stages of fabrication and
monitored to determine if any large cracks had developed during fabri-

cation.

Quality Assurance
The salt filter is designed to operate at 1200°F temperature and

‘35-psig pressure and contain highly radioactive fluids and gases. Since

remote maintenance of radioactive equipment is difficult and time-consuming,
every effort, within practical limits, was made to obtain the necessary
quality level to minimize maintenance on the filter during the life of
the experiment,

~ Once the adequate quality level was esteblished, necessary material
requirements, fabrication specifications, and test procedures were se-
lected and placed on fabrication drawings. These drawings, speclal in-
structions, and inspected material were delivered to the shop for fabri-

. cation. Discussions between shop menagement, inspectors, and MSRE

representatives were arranged to discuss the quality of fabrication de-

sired, possible problem areas, and completion schedule. This was done to

“reduce the possibility of misunderstending and the possible reduction in

quality end/or additional cost and additional time to rebuild the filter.
One of the most important factors for good quality assurance is the

establishment of a strong, working reletionship between project menagement,
 

 

 

22

shop management, and inspection personnel to make sure the requirements

on the drawings are followed and the results reported.
Schedule and Cost |

Conceptual design and development tests began in late November 1967.
They progressed concurrently until completion in lete Jamuary 1968. Pro-
curement began in mid-January 1968 and meteriels were received end in-
spected in time to begin fabrication in late February. Fabrication of
one filter assembly and one spare filter element was completed and tested
by late Merch 1968.

Fabrication costs of one filter housing and two filter elements con-
sists of $4800 for meteriel, $1300 for materiel inspection, and $5200
for shop labor. C

INSTALLATION

The filter assembly wes installed in the fuel-processing system
after all other piping was completed (see Fig. 5). Since the fuel-
processing cell is comparatively small and crowded, some difficulty wes
encountered in locating the assembly. One of the prime requirements in
locating the filter was to provide direct access from above so that filter
elements could be replaced by remote maintenance techniques. Close co-
ordination between the installers and the remote maintenance group in
locating the filter assembly resulted in the filter assembly being in-
stalled in a location which is accessible for element replacement with
minimum difficulty.

Welding caused some problems since part of the piping system was
contaminated with small quentities of non-radioactive salt from & previous
test run. This salt had to be completely removed from the immediate weld
area to prevent contamination of the connecting welds. Valuable assistance
was given by the welding inspection group on the best methods to follow in
cleaning and welding in this conteminated piping system. As a result
of close cooperation, 811 welding passed the necessary inspection end
test specifications.

PLANT PERFORMANCE

On May 6, 1968 an opportunity was provided for determining the
temperature distribution prior to radioactive operation. To compensate
for past and anticipated removals of salt from the reactor fuel system,
3-1/2 £t> of clean carrier salt (67 mol % LiF, 33% BeFz) was passed
through the filter. Figure 6 shows the temperature distribution over the
upper half (gas space) of the filter. Also shown are the temperatures
obtained later with the flush and fuel salt filtrations which correspond
closely. From these temperatures, the temperature switches at points 7
and 9 were set to alarm and stop salt transfer at 1000°F and 350°F
respectively. The temperature 2 inches below the ring joint (Pt. 9)
was only 250°F indicating that the uninsulated flange joint was probably
below 200°F. The remote leak detection on the flange indicated no leakage
during the heat-up, transfer, or subsequent cool-down. }

During August 1968, both flush and fuel salt batches were transferred
to the processing tank through the filter, fluorinated, the structural
metal fluorides reduced and the salt filtered as it was returned to the
reactor drain tanks. In each of these operations there was no detectable
pressure drop across the filter and the filtration wes accomplished in
about two hours. The amount of metals removed from the salt is shown in
Teble 6. The total of both batches is 10 kg. Since visual inspection of
the processing tank after filtration was not possible it is not known
how much of the reduced metals remained in the tank and how much is on
the filter element.
