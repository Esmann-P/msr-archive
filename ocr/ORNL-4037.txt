SUMMARY

Part 1. Molten-~5alt Reactor Experiment

 

1. MSRE Operations and Analysis

 

The reactor power level wag increased in steps to the maximum at-
tainable value of 7.2 Mw. The power limitation was imposed by the heat-
transfer capability of the air-cooled radiator, which was much lower
than the design value. The heat-~transfer coefficients of the primary
fuel-to-coolant-galt heat exchanger were also substantially lower than
had been expected. Two periods, each about two weeks long, of relatively
steady operation at the maximum power were achleved.

Aside from the power limitation, the performance of the reactor
system was favorable. The inherent nuclear stability increased with
increasing power as had been predicted. The nuclear poisoning by 135%e
was only 0.2 to 0.4 of the expected value, apparently because of the
presence of circulating helium bubbles in the fuel salt which had not
been observed in earlier operations at similar conditions. Zero-power
reactivity balances showed a slowly increasing positive anomaly which
had reached a maximum of 0.3% 5k/k at shutdown, Radiation heating of
the primary-system components was in the expected range, and radiation
shielding and containment were adequate.

A system shutdown to remove irradiation specimens from the core,
which wag planned after an accumulated exposure of 10,000 Mwhr, was
advanced when a catastrophic failure of one of the wmaln radiator blowers
occurred at 7800 Mwhr. In addition to the removal and replacement of
the core irradiation specimens and the repair of the main blowers, a
number of other maintenance jobs were performed in the ensuing shutdown.
These included:

1. mechanical and electrical repalr of heat-induced damage to the
radiator enclosure,

2. replacement of the particle trap in the main reactor off-gas line,
which had developed intermittent high resistance to flow,

3. modification of the treated-cooling-water system to eliminate
radiolytic gas,

4. repair of water leaks in the reactor cell,
5

. modification of the component-cooling system to improve reliability,

[@))

general improvement of the in-plant electrical system.

The MSRE instrumentation and controls system continued to perform
well. There was the normally expected reduction in both malfunctions
and misoperation of instruments as instrument and operating personnel
gained experience and developed routines. While there were many design
changes, most of these were improvements and additions to the gystem
rather than corrective measures to the instruments and controls. A
iv

disappointingly large number of faulty commercial relays and electronic
switches were disclosed. These faults were in the areas of both relay
design and fabricatlon, and corrective steps have been taken.

2. Component Develcpment

 

The operation of freeze valve FV-103 was improved by the deletion
of the hysteresis feature of one of the temperature-control modules,
which had caused thermal cycling of the valve before the temperature
reached equilibrium.

The three control rods have operated without difficulty. The
indicated changes in rod length were random and were 0.05 in. for rod
1, 0.16 in. for rod 2, and 0.12 in. for rod 3.

Several small difficulties were encountered in the operation of
the control-rod drive units. In each case the difficulty was diagnosed
and adequate temporary changes were made to permit continued operation
of the reactor. The difficulties involved the failure of a synchro
transmitter and a reference potentiometer, which have been replaced
during the current shutdown. The excellent condition of the gears in
the drive units indicated that there was no high-temperature damage to
the lubricant.

The radiator-door-operating mechanism has performed satisfactorily
since the last modifications. Excessive alr leakage around. the seals
on the doors resulted from damage sustained during the thermal cycling
during normal operation. Laboratory tests were conducted on several
arrangements of the metal seal surfaces, resulting in the choice of a
new hard-geal scheme which was installed on the door. In addition,
alterations were made to the door structure to reduce bowing, and the
installation of a second soft, resilient seal was proposed to back up
the existing seal.

The sampler-enricher has been used to isolate a total of 119 10-g
samples and 20 50-g samples and to make 87 enrichments to the fuel sys-
tem. The only major maintenance required has been replacement of the
manipulator boots, replacement of the drive-unit capsule latch, repair
of an open electrical circuit, and recovery of a capsule which had
fallen into the operational valve area. These repairs were performed
without the spread of airborne contamination or the exposure of the
personnel to significant radiation levels. An increase of the buffer
leakage in the operational valve was determined to be caused by particles
which fell onto the upper seal surface, and it was found that simple
cleaning of this surface was effective in reducing the leakage. Problems
resulting from an increase in the contamination level within the mech-
anism were solved by a partial cleanup of one area, the establishment of
a contamination control area at the sample withdrawal area, and the
modification of the transport container to reduce contamination of the
upper part and to permit inexpensive disposal of the lower part.

Changes were made in the sampler~enricher control circuit to
reduce the chance of rupturing the manipulator boots. In addition, a
fuse and voltage suppressor were installed to protect the electrical
leads from excessive voltages and currents.

A total of 45 samples, including two 50-g samples, have been taken
using the coolant sampler. One electrical receptacle was replaced, and
the leakage of the removal valve was reduced by cleaning.

The design of the fuel processing sampler was essentially completed,
and installation is proceeding as craft is available. The electrical
and instrument work is about 50% complete, and the installation of
other equipment is over 954, complete.

The original off-gas filter in line 522 was replaced with one
which is designed to trap organic materials in addition to particulate
matter. Activated charcoal was chosen as the filtering medium, and
preliminary tests indicated that 1t had good efficiency for the removal
of Cg and heavier molecules. A prefilter was installed to remove the
radioactive particulate matter as well as the organic mists which might
exist. Since one of the purposes of the prefilter was to reduce the
heat load on the charcoal trap, heat dissipation was also a consideration
in the design. The entire filter-—charcoal trap is cooled vy immersion
in watery. Since little was known of the character of the organic ma-
terial at the time of the design of the filter system, one of the pur-
poses was to provide a method of diagnosing the problem. Therefore,
the particle trap will be removed and examined to gain information
needed in the design of a more permanent system.

Diffusion of activity into the fuel pump off-gas line resulted in
two short periods of high activity at the off-gas stack. A small char-
coal trap was installed to provide holdup times of approximately 2-1/2
days for krypton and 30 days for xenon.

Several remote maintenance jobs were performed during the period,
in which the accumulated reactor power increased from 35 to 7822 Mwhr.
Several observations were made as a result of the work. Control of air-
borne contamination is not difficult, and the maintenance techniques and
systems prepared for the MERE have worked well. The flexibility of the
maintenance approach was demonstrated by carrying out unanticipated
tasks such as the installation of a thermocouple on a piece of pipe in
the reactor cell and the thawing out and clearing of a plug in one of
the service gas lines. The major tasks completed during the report in-
cludes (1) opening a section of the off-gas line, inspecting the inside,
and returning the line to operating condition; (2) removal and replace-
ment of both of the reactor-cell space coolers; (3) installation of a
new thermocouple on a horizontal section of the off-gas line; (4) repair
of the sampler-enricher electrical receptacle; (5) installation of tem-
porary piping in the main off-gas line to measure pressure distributions;
(6) removal of the graphite-Hastelloy N surveillance samples; (7) re-
moval, repair, and replacement of two control-rod drive units; (8) re-
moval of a salt plug from a gas-pressure reference line by applying
pressure while heating the line.
[skipped page]5. Reactor Analysis

Rod drop experiments, performed during MSRE run No. 3, were analyzed
and compared with rod worths determined from other independent measure-
ments. Theoretical time~integrated flux trajectories following rod
scrams were calculated, based on negative reactivity insertions obtained
by integrating differential worth measurements. These trajectories were
found to compare closely with experimental records of the accumulated
count following the scram. We have concluded that an approximate 5%
band of self-consistency can be assigned to the control rod reactivity
worths inferred from these two independent calibration techniques.

Part 2. Materials Studies

6. MSRP Materials

The grade CGB graphite and Hastelloy N specimens were removed from
the core of the MSREE after 7800 Mwhr of operation. Their macroscopic
appearances were essentially unchanged by this exposure. Some of the
specimens were damaged physically as a result of differences in thermal
expansion of parts of the assembly. A new core specimen array vas as-
sembled with modifications to correct these difficulties.

A metallurgical investigation was conducted to determine the effect
of aluminum-zinc alloy contamination on the Hastelloy N tubing of the
MSRE salt-to-alr radiator. Contamination occurred from a blower failure
during which shrapnel was blown across the hot radiator tubes. Labora-
tory tests showed that, in general, an aluminum oxide coating contained
the aluminum, even in the molten state, and interaction did not occur.
When the oxide skin wag broken from mechanical abrasion, shock, or other
reasons, wetting occurred. Moderate interaction to a depth of about
0.010 in. occurred in a wetted sample held at 1200°F for 5 hr. The tubes
in the radiator were inspected, and those which were contaminated were
carefully cleaned. As a result of the investigation and cleanup pro-
cedure, the radiator system was Judged to be satisfactory for further
operation. ;

Examinations of new grades of both anisotropic and isotropic graphite
indicate that these 40 not yet meet the requirements of molten-salt
breeder reactors.

Results of a variety of graphite creep experiments performed over
a wide temperature range support a Cottrell model for irradiation creep.
Use of this model will permit easier extrapolation of data. JTmplied in
this concept is the conclusion that as long as the stress acting on the
graphite does not exceed the fracture stress, the graphite will continue
to absorb the creep deformation without loss of mechanical integrity.

The experimental brazing alloy 60 Pd~35 Ni~5 Cr (wt %) was evaluated
for joining graphite to metals. Although it exhibits relatively poor
wettability on high-density graphite, its marginal behavior is enhanced
by preplacing it as foil in the joint. Graphite-to-molybdenum joints
brazed with this alloy preplaced in the joint were thermally cycled
between 200 and 700°C, and metallographic investigation showed that no
deterioration had occurred. Two graphite-to-molybdernum~to-Hastelloy-N
viii

transition Joints were brazed using a tapered joint design. Visual
examination revealed no cracks, and evaluation is continuing.

A new brazing alloy, 35 Ni—60 Pd-5 Cr (wt %), for joining graphite
to molybdenum had less than 2 mils attack after exposure to LiF-Belp-
ZrF,~ThF,-UF, at 1300°F for 5000 hr in a Hastelloy N container.

Since zirconium and titanium have been found to improve the resis-
tance of Hastelloy N to effects of neutron irradiation, the influence
of these elements on the weldability is being evaluated. Titanium ap-
pears to have no deleterious effects. Zirconium in concentrations as
low as 0.06 wt % causes hot cracking. However, reasonably good welds
have been made by the use of filler wire that contains dissimilar metal.
The level of zirconium that can be tolerated has yet to be determined.

Our studies of the behavior of the Hastelloy N under neutron irra-
diation have been concerned with evaluating the heats of material used
in the MSRE and in evaluating several modified heats of Hastelloy N for -
use in an advanced system. In-reactor stress-rupture tests on several
heats of material suggest that there may be a stress below which es-
sentially no neutron damage occurs. Tests on specimens exposed to var- -
ious ratios of fast flux to thermal flux indicate that the damage cor-
relates with the thermal flux. We believe that the damage is due to
helium produced by the (n,&) reaction with °B. We have produced several
heats of material with very low boron, but have had to change from air
to vacuum melting practice. If the low-boron material is irradiated cold,
we find that the properties are superior to those of the higher boron
material; if irradiated hot, the properties are as bad or worse. Thus
the postirradiation properties are not uniquely dependent upon the boron
content, and other factors such as the distribution of boron and the
presence of other impurities must be very important. The addition of
titanium to Hastelloy N has been very effective in improving the prop-
erties.

Limited creep-rupture tests have been run on Hasteloy N to deter-
mine its suitability for use as a distillation vessel for molten salts
at 982°C. This work has resulted in a determination of the strength -
properties to times of 1000 hr. The formation of a second phase was
observed that may influence the ductility at lower temperatures. The
oxidation characteristics under cyclic temperatures remain to be deter-
mined.

Thermal convection loops containing fused salt of MSRE composition
and fabricated from Hastelloy N and type 446 stainless steel have con-~
tinued operation for 4.5 and 3.2 years, respectively, with no sign of
difficulty. A slight decrease in cold-leg temperature has been noted in
an Nb—1% Zr loop after 0.6 year. A Hastelloy N loop has circulated a
secondary coolant salt for 3000 hr, whereas a Croloy 9M loop with the
same salt plugged in 1440 hr.

7. Chemistry

The fuel and coolant salt have not changed perceptibly in composition
gince they were first circulated in the reactor some 16 months ago. The
ix

concentration of corrosion products has not increased appreciably. The
average oxide concentration in the fuel was 54 ppm, which is reassuringly
low.

The viscosity and density of molten BeF, were measured; the vis-
cosity was about 10% greater than previously reported, and the density
of the liguid is not very different from that of the solid.

Vapor equilibria that are involved in the reprocessing by distil-
lation have been measured. Decontamination Factors of the order of 1000
Tor rare earths were evidenced.

Thermophysical properties have been estimated for the sodium potag-
sium Fluoroborate mixture that is a proposed coolant for the MSBR., The
vapor pressure, due to evolution of BFj3, reaches 229 mm at the highest
operating temperature. Interim estimates for density, specific heat,
and viscosity of the proposed coolant were made available.

Possible reprocessing methods were studied in greater detail. Fun-
damental studies related to the thermodynamics of the reduction of fission
product rare earths into a bismuth alloy were carried out. The exceed-~
ingly low activity coefficients of rare earths in the bismuth explained
the feasibility of the process. Further attention was paid to the re-
moval of rare earths by precipitation in a solid solution with UF,.

The removal of protactinium from blanket melts was studied in sev-
eral ways. These included an oxide precipitation with ZrC,, a pump loop
to transfer protactinium in a bismuth-thorium alloy, and attempts at
electrolytic reduction from blanket melts. Moderate success was achieved
in these experiments, but more work is required to arrive at finished
and fully controlled procedures.

Analyses obtained from sampling assemblies that had been exposed
in the pump bowl of the MSRE showed thal noble-metal fission products
were being partially released to the gas space, presumably as volatile
fluorides. At the same time, plating of noble metals from the liquid
was encountered. These puzzling phenomena were reflected in results on
surveillance specimens of graphite and metal which were removed Irom the
MSRE. Some 10 to 20% of the yield of noble-metal fission products was
found to have entered the gas space in the graphite.

Analyses of xenon isotope ratios in concentrated samples of off-gas
from the MSRE showed that the burnup of 135%e was about 8%; the remainder
escaped to the cover gas or decayed. This 1s in accord with the low
xenon poisoning indicated by reactivity behavior.

Preliminary estimates of xenon poisoning and cesium carbide for.
mation in the MSBR indicate that cesium deposition will probably not be
a serious problem, but that stripping for iodine removal will probably
be required to keep poisoning within bounds. Oxide concentrations of
50 to 70 ppm were determined in fuel samples taken from the reactor
during operations at all power levels without apparent interference from
the activities of the samples. Techniques for the regeneration of elec-
trolytic moisture cells were developed to provide dependable replacements
for the hot-cell oxide apparatus and components for future in-line ap-
plications.
Measurements directed toward the development of in-line spectro-
photometric methods disclosed additional wavelengths of potential analyt-
ical value in the ultraviolet absorption spectrum of U(III) and confirmed
the absence of interference from corrosion products. Investigation of
unusual valence states of rare-earth fission products indicates possible
interference from Sm(IT) but none from Eu(IL). An intense absorption
peak suitable for monitoring traces of uranium in coolant salt has been
found in the ultraviolet spectrum of U(IV). A modified optical system
has been ordered which will improve the spectrophotometric measurements
of molten fluoride salts.

By voltsmmetric and chronopotentiometric measurements, the U(IV)
reduction wave was found to correspond to a one-electron reversible re-
action. Diffusion coefficients and the activation energy were measured.
Repeated scans of this wave in quiescent MSRE melts were reproducible to
about 2% over extended periods and better than 1% during short-term
measurements. A new voltammeter is being built to improve the reproduc-
ibility and make possible measurement of flowing salt streams. Design
criteria are being considered for an in-line test facility for evaluating
three types of continuous analytical methods.

Hydrocarbons were measured in helium from simulated pump leak ex-~
periments, and an apparatus was developed for the continuous measurement
of hydrocarbous in MSRE off-gas.

Efforts were continued on the development and evaluation of equip-
ment and procedures for analyzing radioactive MSRE salt samples. The
remote apparatus for oxide determinations was installed in cell 3 of the
High~Radiation-Tevel Analytical Laboratory (Building 2026).

In addition to the analyses performed on the salt samples, radio-
chemical leach solutions were prepared on silver and Hastelloy N wires
coiled onto the stainless steel cable between the latch and ladle.

The quality-control program was continued during the past period
to establish more realistic limits of error for the methods.

Part 3. Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor Studies

8. Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor Design Studies

 

Further design changes were incorporated into the reference molten-
salt breeder reactor concept. The design of the primary heat exchangers
was altered to eliminate the need for expansion bellows, Also, the flow
of fluid in the primary reactor circuits was reversed to lower the oper-
ating pressure in the reactor vessel.

The effect of lowering the feedwater temperature from 700 to 580° F
was evaluated. It was found that this change increased the plant thermal
efficiency from 44.9 to 45.4% and reduced plant construction costs by
$465,000 if there were no accompanying adverse effects. These savings
are canceled if the coolant used with the lower feedwater temperature
costs $2.4 million more than the coolant used with 700°F feedwater.

Molten-salt reactors appear well suited for modular-type plant con-
struction. Such construction causes no significant penalty to either
xi

the power-production cogt or the nuclear performance, and it may permit
MSBR's to have very high plant-availability factors.

at)

improves the potential performance of molten-salt reactors and indicates
the versatility of molten salts as reactor fuels. However, in order to
attain the technology status required for such concepts, a development
program 1s necessary.

Use of direct-contact cooling of molten salts with lead significantly

The molten~galt reactor concept that requires the least amount of
development effort is the MSCR, but it is not a breeder system. The
equilibrium breeding ratio and the power-production cost of the MSCR
plant were estimated to be about 0.96 and 2.9 mills/kvwhr (electrical),
respectively, in an investor-owned plant with a load factor of 0.8.
Although this represents excellent performance as an advanced converter,
the development of MSBR(Pz) or MSBR plants appears preferable because of
the lower power-production costs and superior nuclear and fuel-conser-
vation characteristics associated with the breeder reactors.

9. Molten-Salt Reactor Processing Studies

 

The processing plant for an M3BR would use side streams withdrawn
from the fuel- and fertile-salt recirculating systems at rates that
vield a fuel-salt cycle time of approximately 40 days and fertile-salt
cycle time of approximately 20 days. Among the significant steps in the
presently envisioned process are recovery of the uranium by continuous
fluorination and recovery of the carrier fuel salt by semicontinuous
vacuum distillation. Alternative schemes are also being considered.

Semicontinuous Distillation. Values of the relative volatilities
of NdF;, laFs, and CeFs; in LiF are of the order of 0.0007. These are
from new measurements made using a recirculating equilibrium still.
Farlier measurements made by a cold-fingsr technique were about a factor
of 50 too high. The complexity of still design and operation is consid-
erably eased by these lower values. Retention of over 90% of the rare-
earth neutron poisons in less than 0.5% of the processed salt can easily
be achieved.

 

Continuous Fluorination of a Molten Salt. The uranium in the fuel
stream of an MSBR must be removed by continuous fluorination prior to
the distillation gtep. The significant problems are corrosion of the
flucrinator and the possible loss of uranium. Studies are in progress
on continuous fluorinators constructed as towers with countercurrent
flow of fluorine to salt. Recoveries exceeding 99% have been consistently
attained with towers only 48 in. high. Higher recoveries with longer
towers are anticipated. Corrosion protection may be effected by the use
of a layer of frozen salt on the wall of the fluorinator. Feasibility of
this technique is based on successful experiments with batch systems and
simple heat transfer calculations. The heat generation of the fuel salt
should be adequate to maintain an easily controlled layer of frozen salt
on the cooled metal wall.

 

Alternative Chemical Processing Methods for an MSBR., Reductive co~
precipitation and liquid-metal extraction are being studied as possible

 
xii

methods for decontamination of MSBR carrier salt (LisBeF,) after uranium
removal by the fluoride volatilization process. Adequate removal of La
and Gd is achieved by treatment with near-theoretical quantities of beryl-
lium metal to form beryllides of the type ILnBejs. Either excess Be, up
to 243 times the theoretical amount, or a stronger reductant, Li, is nec-
essary Lo remove zirconium at trace level. The zirconium is removed as
free metal from 5 mole % ZrF, solutions in Li,BeF,;, but from dilute
solutions a beryllide, ZrBep, has also been identified.

Tithium-bismuth liquid-metal extraction experiments were also con-
tinued. Significant removals were observed for La, Sm, Gd, Sr, and Eu,
the latter principally by extraction into the metal phase, the others by
deposition as interface solids, as previously reported for other metal
extractlon tests.

INTRODUCTION

The Molten-Salt Reactor Program is concerned with research and de-
velopment for nuclear reactors that use mobile fuels, which are solu-
tions of fissile and fertile materials in suitable carrier salts. The
program is an outgrowth of the ANP efforts to make a molten-salt reactor
power plant for aircraft and is extending the technology originated there
to the development of reactors for producing low-cost power for civilian
uses.

The major goal of the program is to develop & thermal breeder re-
actor. TIuel for this type of reactor would be 2337, or 2357p, dissolved
in a salt of composition near 2LiF-BeF,. The blanket would be ThF, dis-
solved in a carrier of similar composition. The technology being devel-
oped for the breeder is applicable to, and could ve exploited sooner in,
advanced converter reactors or in burners of fissionable uranium and
plutonium that also use fluoride fuels. Solutions of uranium, plutonium,
and thorium salts in chloride and fluoride carrier salts offer attractive
possibilities for mobile fuels for intermediate and fast breeder reactors.
The fast reactors are of interest too, but are not a significant part of
the program.

Our major effort is being applied to the operation and testing of a
Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment. The purpose of this experiment is to
test the type of fuels and materials that would be used in the thermal
breeder and the converter reactors and to obtain several years of ex-
perience with the operation and maintenance of a small molten-~salt power
reactor. A successful experiment will demonstrate on a small scale the
attractive features and the technical Teasibility of these systems for
large civilian power reactors. The MSRE operates at 1200°F and at
atmospheric pressure and was intended to produce 10 Mw of heat. Initially,
the fuel contains 0.9 mole % of UF,, 5 mole % ZrF,;, 29.1 mole % Bel',, and
65 mole % LiF, and the uranium is about 30% 235. The melting point is
840°F. In later operation, we expect to use highly enriched uranium in
the lower concentration typical of the fuel for the core of a breeder.

In each case, the composition of the solvent can be adjusted to retain
about the same liquidus temperature.

The fuel circulates through a reactor vessel and an external pump
and heat-exchange system. All this equipment is constructed of Hastelloy
w,* a new nickel-molybdenum-chromium alloy with exceptional resistance
to corrosion by molten fluorides and with high strength at high tempera-
ture. The reactor core contains an assembly of graphite moderator bars
that are in direct contact with the fuel. The graphite is a new material?
of high density and small pore size. The fuel salt does not wet the
graphite and therefore should not enter the pores, even at pressures well
above the operating pressure.

Corp.
Heat produced in the reactor is transferred to a coolant salt in
the heat exchanger, and the coolant salt is pumped through a radiator
to dissipate the heat to the atmosphere. A small facility is installed
in the MSRE building for occasionally processing the fuel by treatment
with gaseous HF and Fs.

Design of the MSRE was begun early in the summer of 1960. Orders
for special materials were placed in the spring of 196). Major modifi-
cations to Building 7503 at ORNL, in which the reactor is installed,
were started in the fall of 1961 and were completed by January 1963.

Fabrication of the reactor equipment was begun early in 1962. Some
difficulties were experienced in obtaining materials and in making and
installing the equipment, but the essential installations were completed
so that prenuclear testing could begin in August of 1964. The prenuclear
testing was completed with only minor difficulties in March of 1965.

Some modifications were made before beginning the critical experiments

in May, and the reactor was first critical on June 1, 1965. The zero-
power experiments were completed early in July. Additional modifications,
maintenance, and sealing and testing of the containment were required be-
fore the reactor began to operate at appreciable power. This work was
completed in December.

Operation at a power of 1 Mw was begun in January 1966. At that
power level, trouble was experienced with plugging of small ports in
the control valves in the off-gas system by heavy liquid and varnish-
like organic materials. Those materials are believed to be produced
from a very small amount of oil that leaks through a gasketed seal and
into the fuel salt in the pump tank of the fuel circulating pump. 'The oil
vaporizes and accompanies the gaseous fission products and helium cover
gas purge into the off-gas system. There the intense beta radiation
from the krypton and xenon polymerizes some of the hydrocarbons, and the
products plug small openings. This difficulty was largely overcome by
installing an absolute filter in the off-gas line ahead of the control
valves.

The full power capsbility of the reactor — about 7.5 Mw under design
conditions — was reached in May. The power was limited by the perfor-
mance of the salt-to-air radiator heat-dump system. The plant was oper-
ated until the middle of July to the equivalent of about one month at
full power when troubles with the blowers in the heat-dump system re-
guired that the operation be interrupted for maintenance.

In most respects the reactor has performed very well: the fuel has
been completely stable; the fuel and coolant salts have not corroded the
Hastelloy N container material in several thousand hours at 1200°F; and
there has been no detectable reaction between the fuel salt and the
graphite in the core of the reactor. Mechanical difficulties with equip-
ment have been largely confined to peripheral systems and auxiliaries.

Because the MSRE is of a new and advanced type, substantial research
and development effort is provided in support of the operation. Included
are engineering development and testing of reactor components and sys-
tems, metallurgical development of materials, and studies of the chemistry
of the salts and their compatibility with graphite and metals both in-
pile and out-of-pile. Work is also being done on methods for purifying
the fuel salts and in preparing purified mixtures for the reactor and
for the research and development studies. Some studies are being made
of the large power breeder reactors for which this technology is being
developed.

This report is one of a series of periodic reports in which we de-
scribe briefly the progress of the program. ORNI~3708 is an especially
useful report because it gives a thorough review of the design and con-
struction and supporting development work for the MSRE. It also de-
scribes much of the general technology for molten-salt reactor systems.

At the beginning of this report period the reactor was down to cope
with the problem of plugging in small passages in the fuel off-gas sys-
tem. Investigation showed that the material causing the trouble was a
mixture of hydrocarbons, probably pump lubricating oil that had been
affected by heat and radiation in the off-gas line. With this informa-
tion, a device to clean up the gas stream was designed, bullt, and in-
stalled in the off-gas line upstream of the fuel pressure control valve.
It consisted of a trap for particles and mist, followed by a charcoal
ped for vapor adsorption. Also during this shutdown, the pressure con-
trol valve and the charcoal-bed inlet valves were replaced with valves
having larger trim.

Power operation was resumed in mid-April, and the program of in-
vestigating the performance up to full power was completed by the end of
Mzy. (This period of operation was designated run 6.) During this time,
observations were made as planned on radiation heating, heat transfer,
xenon poisoning, and reactor dynamics. With the exception of heat
transfer, the system behavior was within the expected limits, although
xenon poisoning was somewhat less than predicted.

The power escalation was Interrupted twice, once when the anomalous
behavior of the control system led to a drain and again by an electrical
failure in the fuel sampler, whose repair required the fuel be drained.
The approach to full power also disclosed problems in several areas:

1. After about six weeks of operation, pressure drop across the newly
installed trap in the off-gas line had built up to 10 psig, and it
seemed it would have to be replaced. But during further operation
at high power, the pressure drop went down to less than 1 psig.
Temperatures indicated considerable retention of fission products in
the trap but no evidence of poisoning or deterioration.

DN

After each step up in power the pressure drop across the main char-
coal bed inlets increased, but each time this occurred, backblowing
with helium proved effective in restoring the pressure drop to an
acceptable level.

7
3. Radioactive gas from the Tuel drain tanks diffused back into the
helium supply lines outside the shield, requiring a periodic purge
of these lines to keep down radiation in the North Electric Service
Area.

4. When the power reached 5 Mw, radiolytic gas began to accumulate in
the thermal shield, displacing part of the water. Efforts to elimi-~
nate the gas by venting the shield slides and increasing the water
flow were unsuccessful.

5. The water circulated through the shield contained lithium nitrite as
corrosion inhibitor, and oxidation of the nitrite ion to nitrate was
also observed at the higher power.

6. A discrepancy arose belween the reactor power indicated by the heat
balances and by the neutron instruments (calibrated at low power).

It was found later that the neutron instruments gave erroneously
high readings at high power because of an increase in the temperature
of water in the shaft around the instruments.

The climax of the power escalation was reached when the coolant
heat removal system (air-cooled radiator with adjustable doors, bypass
damper, and two blowers) was extended to its limit, and the capability
proved to be only 7.5 Mw. The coefficient for heat transfer in the pri-
mary heat exchanger was also below expectations, imposing a lower limit
of about 1210°F on the fuel outlet temperature at the maximum power.

In late May, power operation was halted when it became evident that
apparent inleakage of air into the reactor cell had begun to exceed the
specified limit. The cell was pressurized to 20 psig for leak hunting,
and no leak of any consequence was found. It was discovered that the
apparent cell leak was actually nitrogen leaking into the cell from
pressurized thermocouple penetrations. When this was taken into account,
the measured reactor cell leakage at 20 psig was acceptably low.

While the cell leak hunt was in progress, attempts were made to de-
termine the source of water which had appeared in the cell atmosphere
(1 to 2 gpd had begun to condense in the component-coolant pump domes,
the coolest spot exposed to the cell atmosphere). The source was nob
located because elevated temperatures in the cell prevented meaningful
leak rate measurements on separate portions of the water system.

Operation at full power was resumed on June 13 to investigate the
chemistry and reactivity behavior of the reactor and to increase the ex-
posure of the core specimens before their removal, scheduled at 10,000
Mwhr. This was run 7.

Fuel-salt samples, taken at a rate of three per week, showed no
change in the main constituents of the salt, very low oxide (about 50
ppm), and no appreciable growth of corrosion-product chromium in the
salt. The sampler~-enricher was also used to expose metal wires briefly
to the gas in the pump bowl, and these showed more fission products than
expected.
Reactivity transients following changes in power indicated that
the 13%%e poisoning was only 0.4% 8k/k at full power. The presence of
circulating gas bubbles was suggested by the low xenon poisoning, and
experiments on the effect of pressure on reactivity confirmed that there
was as much as 1% by volume of bubbles in the core salt. The system re-
activity showed very little net change connected with power operation
other than that attributed to xenon, even though the calculated samarium
poisoning increased to about 0.3% 8k/k.

Another anomalous behavior was the slow, continuous accumulation of
fuel salt in the overflow tank at pump-bowl levels below that at which
accumulation had been observed before.

There was some encouragement from the treated-water system. Partial
deaeration of water going to the thermal~shield slides significantly re-
duced the holdup of radiolytic gas, leading to plans for more effective
deaeration. Decomposition of the nitrite corrosion inhibitor leveled off
at an acceptable level.

Power operation was interrupted for 14 hr after a shaft coupling on
one of the main blowers falled. Another interruption, this one for four
days, resulted when an electrical short in a component-cooling pump
caused the fuel system to drain. Power operation ended on July 17, when
the hub on one of the main blowers broke up, reducing the air flow and
causing pleces of hub and blades to fly into the radiator. The coolant
system was immediately drained and cooled down to inspect the radiator.
After some experiments at low power, the fuel was also drained to begin
the planned program of maintenance. Integrated power up to the shutdown
was 7822 Mwhr. Same of the operating data are summarized in Table 1.1.

The first step was to flush the fuel system with flush salt in
preparation for the specimen removal. During an experiment to verify the
fuel pump overflow point, flush salt got into some of the gas lines on
the pump bowl and froze there, adding another job to the shutdown.

The assembly of graphite and Hastelloy N specimens that had been in
the core since September 1965 was removed for examination. These showed
practically no corrosion or deterioration. The samples were subjected
to a program of analysis and testing with emphasis on fission product
deposition.

Two control-rod drives were removed and faulty position indicators
repaired. Testing showed that the water leak in the reactor cell was
from one of the space coolers, and it was removed and repaired. Special
tools and heaters were devised, and the frozen salt was thawed from the
plugged gas lines on the pump. All the work in the reactor cell was done
through the maintenance shield because of radiation, which ranged from 1
to A0 r/hr over openings in the top shield. Inspection of the radiator
showed only inconseguential damage due to the blower failure, but con-
siderable repair of: the enclosure and the door seals was necessary be-
cause of heat-induced deformation and failures. Replacement rotary ele-
ments with stronger hubs and lighter blading were procured for the main
blowers.

1.2 Reactivity Balance

J. R. Engel

The reactivity balance, as calculated for the MSRE, is a summation
of all terms which affect the system reactivity. Tt is routinely com-
puted every 5 min while the reactor is critical for the purpose of re-
vealing any anomalous effects that may be developing. The value of the
reactivity balance in revealing unexpected effects is strongly dependent
on the accurate calculation of all the known terms. Very early in the
power operation it became apparent that the 135Xe poisoning was much
less than expected. Accordingly, this term was eliminated from the re-
activity balance until the xenon effect could be evaluated and an accu-
rate representation programmed into the computer. (The considerable
effort directed toward evaluating the xenon effect is described in Sect.
1.3.) In spite of this omission, considerable useful information was
derived from the reactivity balances.
11

Reactivity Balances at Power

 

Figure 1.1 shows the history of the partial reactivity balance (no
135%e correction) during the approach to full power from 1 Mw and steady
operation at high power. The power history for this report period is
included for reference.

Xenon Poisoning. The most prominent feature of the reactlvity-
balance behavior ig the transients that accompany significant changes in
power. The directions of the transients and their time dependence cor-
respond to the expected behavior of 135%e poisoning, but they are much
smaller in magnitude. We used these transients for a tentative evalu-
ation of the xenon polsoning effect.

Power Coefficient of Reactivity. A power coefficient of reactivity
is used to account for the fact that the average graphite temperature is
higher than that of the fuel at high power. Initially we calculated an
effective temperature difference of 44°F at 10 Mw. This leads to a

predicted power coefficient of —0.006(% 8k/k) /Mw when the reactor outlet
temperature is held constant. Observations of control-rod positions
immediately before and after large power changes Indicated a smaller
power coefficient of reactivity. Careful measurements in times that were
short relative to the larger reactivity effects gave a value of —0.001 #
0.001(% 8k/k)/Mw. This value corresponds to an effective temperature
difference between the graphite and fuel of 30°F at 10 Mw. Although the
contribution of the power coefficient to the net reactivity is small, all
the reactivity balances were corrected to the observed value of this
parameter.

Reactivity Balances at low Power

 

A somewhat less~obvious feature of the general reactivity behavior
was a gradual drift in the positive direction of balances taken at very
low power when xenon poisoning was negligible. By the time the reactor
was shut down in July, this drift had raised the apparent net reactivity
to +0.1% ok/k. However, the reactivity balances do not contain a term
to correct for circulating bubbles, and there is some evidence (see
Sect. 1.4) that the bubble fraction increased from essentially zero to
about 1% during this period. Since circulating voids have a negative
effect on the reactivity, proper compensation for the bubbles would re-~
veal an even larger positive drift in the net reactivity. If the bubble
fraction did increase by 1%, the net positive shift in reactivity during
the period in question was about 0.3% 5k/k.

Several of the major terms in the reactivity balance are accurately
known, as demonstrated by the good balances obtained in the initial period
of low-power operation.” These terms include the temperature coefficient
of reactivity, compensation for the operating 235 concentration, and
control-rod poisoning. The terms which were introduced by extended oper-
ation of the reactor at high power are poisoning by low-cross-section
fission products, 2357 burnup, and samarium poisoning. (Poisoning by
135%e has not yet been included because of the discrepancy between pre-
dicted and observed behavior.) One possible explanation for the upward
drift in reactivity 1s overcompensation for one or more of these negative
terms.

Low-Cross-Section Fission Products. Since the yields and effective
cross sections for these fission products are reasonably well known, this
poisoning term can be accurately calculated. Furthermore, at the burnup
achieved so far, this term accounts for only —0.004% 8k/k.

 

235y Burnup. The cross sections for 2350 were adequately treated in
the MSRE calculations, as evidenced by the prediction of the initial
critical concentration and the concentration coefficient of reactivity.
Therefore, compensation for the burnup of 235y, which amounted to —0.128%
8k/k when the reactor was last shut down, is probably not a major source
of error.

Samarium Poisoning. We estimate that the equilibrium samarium
poisoning in the MSRE will be about 1% 8k/k. Both *%%¢m and *°'Sm con-
tribute to this effect, and, since different time constants are associ-
ated with each isotope, the two components are calculated separately and
13

then combined to give the total reactivity effect. The calculated sa-
marium poisoning when the fuel salt was drained on July 24 was —0.364%
5k/k.

Cauges of Anomaly. The apparent reactivity anomaly at low power
must result from an unknown positive reactivity effect, overcompensation
for negative effects, or a combination of the two. The magnitude of this
anomaly appears to be at least 0.1% 8k/k, but it may be as large as 0.3%
6k/k. The uncertainty is related to the uncertainty in the circulating
void fraction during operation.

To date there has been no evidence, either chemical or physical,
that the items which make up the negative reactivity terms are behaving
differently than was assumed in the calculations. However, additional
detailed analyses of future operations will be required to verify the
predictions of samarium poisoning and burnup. There has also been no
outside evidence of any unforeseen phenomenon that could have a positive
reactivity effect of the magnitude observed.

1.3 Xenon Poiscning

B. E. Prince R. J. Kedl J. R. Engel

Before the MSRE was operated at power, estimates were made of the
135%e poisoning that would be encountered. These estimates were based
on detalled models postulated for the xenon behavior in the salt, helium,
and graphite in the reactor. Values for important parameters were ob-
tained wherever possible from various development tests and, in the case
of the circulating bubble fraction, from experiments in the MSRE. (These
early tests indicated practically no bubbles.)? On this basis the
steady-state reactivity effect due to 135%e was estimated to be ~1.08%
8k/k (poison fraction = 1.44%) at 7.5 Mw. The detailed equations which
describe xenon behavior were also used to make predictions about the tine
dependence of this phenomenon.

When the reactor was operated at power, the reactivity transients
that were attributed to 135%e were found to have time constants that were
close to the predicted values, but the magnitudes of the transients were
only about 0.3 to 0.4 of the predicted values. A possible explanation
for the low xenon poisoning appeared when there began to be substantial,
independent evidence that there were now circulating helium bubbles in
the fuel loop (see Sect. 1.4). As a result of these observations, ad-
ditional studies were performed in an effort to obtain better correlations
between our predictions and experience.

Two separate studies were performed using the same basic set of
equations but with somewhat different objectives. The first of these
was an extensive parameter study of the steady-state 135%e poisoning.
The objectives were (1) to see 1f the MSRE experience could be explained
with reasonable values of the parameters and (2) to provide information

about the effects of various parameters that would be required for the
extension of this treatment to other molten-salt-reactor concepts. The
second study was aimed primarily at the time dependence of the xenon
poisoning with fewer variations in the physical parameters. The objec-
tive here, in addition to providing a better insight into the behavior
of xenon in the MSRE, was the development of an adequate computational
model for the inclusion of xenon in the on-line calculation of the re-
activity balance.

Predicted Steady-State '2°Xe Poisoning

 

The steady-state 135%e model described previously? was modified to in-
clude the effects of bubbles of helium circulating in the salt, and calcu-
lations were made. The results are shown in Figs. 1.2 and 1.3. Signifi-
cant parameters which were constant for these plots are as follows:

Reactor power level = 7.5 Mw

Salt stripping efficiency = 12%

Mass transfer coefficient to bulk graphite = 0.060 ft/hr

Mass transfer coefficient to center-line graphite = 0.38 ft/hr

Diffusion coefficient of xenon in graphite = 1 X 107 ft? /hr

Some of these parameters have been changed somewhat from those reported
in the last semiannual report, but this is an updating and does not
change any of the conclusions. While the calculations included transfer
of 1°°Xe from the salt to the bubbles, they omitted any transfer of
bubbles between the salt and the surface of the graphite. There are
arguments to support this omission, but the effect might later prove to
be significant.

Figure 1.2 shows the reactivity as a function of circulating void
fraction. The band shows the variation when the bubble diameter is fixed
at 0.010 in. and {the mass transfer coefficient to the bubble covers a
range of 1 to 4 ft/hr. It also shows the variation when the mass transfer
coefficient is fixed at 2 ft/hr and the bubble diameter covers a range of
0.005 to 0.020 in. For this figure the bubble stripping efficiency is
fixed at 10%. The bubble stripping efficiency is the fraction of *3°Xe-
enriched bubbles that burst in going through the pump bowl and are re-
placed with pure helium bubbles. The actual value of the bubble stripping
efficiency is completely unknown, and 10% was picked only because this is
approximately the value derived from some development tests for the ef-
ficiency with which dissolved gas would be stripped from the salt.

Flgure 1.2b shows the variation of reactivity with void fraction at
various values of bubble stripping efficiency. For this plot the bubble
diameter is fixed at 0.010 in. and the bubble mass transfer coefficient
is fixed at 2.0 ft/hr. The conclusion that can be drawn from these
figures is that circulating bubbles certainly can, and probably do, ac-
count for the discrepancy between measured and predicted values of 135%e

knowledge of the circulating void fraction, bubble stripping efficiency,
and other factors which are unavailable at the present time.

Figure 1.3 shows the contribution of 13%%e in each phase (salt,
graphite, and bubbles) to the total computed 135%e reactivity effect.
16

The various parameters are fixed as indicated. This plot shows how cilrcu-
lating bubbles work to decrease the loss of reactivity to 135%e. As the
void fraction is increased, most of the dissolved xenon migrates to the
bubbles, dropping the dissolved xenon concentration greatly. The con-
centration potential necessary for 135% to migrate to the graphite is
reduced accordingly. Now, since 135%¥e in the graphite was the largest
contribution to reactivity in the "no circulating bubble" case, the over-
all loss in reactivity drops also.

Analysis of Transient 13536 Poisoning

The equations given in ref. 4 were modified to include the possible
presence of minute helium gas bubbles circulating with the liquid salt.
The equations describing the transient concentrations, modified to in-
clude mass transfer of xenon to the gas bubbles, are given below. To
simplify the description, we will assume that the neutron flux is flat
throughout the core. The method described in ref. 4 for correcting for
the spatial dependence of the 135%e poisoning within the graphite-
moderated region is directly applicable to the modified equations given
below. As in ref. 4, we have used a one-dimensional model for the fuel
channels in order to simplify the calculations. The differential equa-
tions governing the concentrations of 13%Xe in the liquid salt, graphite,
and circulating gas volume are as follows:

Equations (1) and (4) are identical in form with those given in ref. 4.

Approximate values of the basic parameters governing the mass trans-
fer of “?°Xe to the graphite were obtained from krypton injection ex-~
periments.’ No direct experimental data are available for the effective
mass transfer coefficients for the bubbles, hy, or the effective bubble
sizes; however, representative values and probable ranges for these pa-
rameters could be estimated.® The dependence of the volume fraction of
circulating bubbles on the reactor operating conditions (fuel pump-bowl
level, temperature, pressure) is not yet well understood. In this study,
volume fractions between zero and 1% were considered. Numerical values
for the mass transfer coefficients, geometric parameters, and graphite
characteristics used in most of the calculations are given in Table 1.2.
The graphite diffusivity and porosity are approximate values for the MSRE
graphite; however, it can be shown that the calculated transients are
relatively insensitive to these parameters.

stripping efficiency. Based on the krypton injection experiments, the
value of E is expected to be about 10%. For this study, this parameter
was varied in the range of 10 to 20%.

Relative values of the calculated time constants in Eg. (3) for mass
transfer, stripping, decay, and neutrcn absorption indicate that the 135%e
in the circulating gas phase should be very nearly in equilibrium with the
135%e in the liquid, independently of changes in the reactor power level.
Hence, this approximation [setting the right-hand side of Eq. (3) equal to
zero for all times] was made to simplify the numerical calculations.

Some typical transient reactivity curves calculated with the pre-
ceding formulas are given in Figs. 1.4 through 1.6. Figure 1.4 corre-
sponds to a step increase in power from zero to 7.2 Mw at time zero.

The separate curves indicate the effectiveness of increasing the volume
of circulating gas in reducing the net 135%e poisoning. Each of these
curves corresponds to a fixed stripplng efficlency of 10% for xenon both
in the liquid salt and the circulating bubbles. The transient at 7.2 Mw
was chosen, since a sustained run was made at this power level during
run 7. In Fig. 1.4, we have also plotted the smoothed experimental data
obtained during this run. These data represent the magnitude of the
apparent 135%e poisoning, determined by subtracting all other known
power-dependent reactivity effects from the reactivity represented by
movement of the control rod. We should emphasize that the experimental
evidence concerning the reproducibility of transients of this type is as
yet insufficient for conclusions To be drawn concerning the amount of
gas bubbles which may be in circulation. The data in Fig. 1.4 suggest
that from 0.5 to 1.0 vol % circulating gas can account qualitatively for
the observed transient poisoning. However, the experimental curve seems
to exhibit a slower approach to equilibrium than is predicted by the
theoretical model.

ing in the graphite, calculations are given both for a flat-flux approxi-
mation (dashed curve) and the weighted poisoning for a flux distribution
approximating that in the actual core (s01id curve). Figure 1.6 illus~
trates that nearly all the 135%e is contained in the bubbles and the
graphite pores, the bubbles providing the additional "sink" which reduces
the effective mass transfer to the graphite. It also illustrates the
difference in the time constants for buildup of these components. The
approach to equilibrium of the 135%e in the graphite is slower than that
in the liquid, owing to the effective time lag introduced by the mass
transfer between the liquid and graphite.

As more experimental evidence is accumulated concerning the tran-
sient behavior of the 37Xe poisoning, attempts will be made to refine
the preceding model. This will include attempts to determine the de-
pendence of the volume of circulating gas on the reactor operating con-
ditions and the degree to which a fixed gas volume might be expected
during further operation of the reactor.

1.4 Circulating Bubbles

R. J. Kedl J. R. Fngel

Early in the development of the MSRE salt pumps, some evidence ap-
peared that the circulating fuel salt would contain a small but measurable
guantity of helium bubbles introduced by the xenon stripping device. This
was a significant finding because of the potential influence of these
bubbles on the reactor dynamics (through a pressure coefficient of re-
activity) and on xenon poisoning. Theoretical analyses led to the con-
clusion that the dynamic effects would not be serious but that bubbles
would substantially reduce the xenon poisoning. Because of the im-~
portance of the bubbles, experiments were planned to measure the circu-
lating void fraction.

The experiment designed to measure the void fraction consisted in
subjecting the fuel system to a rapid pressure release. In these tests
the fuel system would first be pressurized to about 15 psig (normal over-
pressure is 5 psig) with helium and allowed to establish a new steady
state. "The excess overpressure would then be rapidly released by vent-
ing the gas to a previously vented, empty drala tank. Expansion of any
gas in the loop forces salt into the surge space in the pump bowl, where
it can be measured by the level instrument. Tn addition, the expulsion
of salt from the core reduces reactivity, which can be measured in the
critical reactor by observing control-rod motion. A third method of
evaluating the circulating voids, a salt densitometer, was installed for
use in the initial tests prior to operation of the reactor at significant
power.

Three pressure-rclease tests were performed as part of the zero-power
experiments in July 1965.7 Two of these tests, at normal system tempera-
ture and salt level in the pump bowl, indicated that there was essentially
no gas in the core. However, the third test, which was conducted at an
abnormally low pump-bowl level (obtained by lowering the operating tem
perature to 1050°F), showed a void fraction of 2 to 3%. It appeared from
this test that bubbles did nol begin to circulate in the loop until the
pump-bowl level was reduced to about 50% on the bubbler level elements.
Since only one such experiment was performed, the individual effects of
pump-bowl level and salt temperature were not separated.

The results of these zero-power tests led to the establishment of a
minimum pump-bowl operating level of 50% to prevent circulation of helium
bubbles. In addition, the bubble term was removed from the equations
used to predict xenon poisoning. When the reactor was operated at high
power, the observed xenon transients were much smaller than those pre-
dicted by the "no bubble" equations, implying the presence of bubbles.

In addition, a reactivity disturbance occurred on June 19, 1966, which
again emphasized the importance of bubbles. On that date (see Fig. 1.1)
the net reactivity began to decrease sharply, and it was noted that the
lower of two pump-bowl level indications had dropped below 50% because

of the contimiocus transfer of salt from the pump bowl to the overflow
tank. The reactivity recovered rapidly when the salt was returned to the
pump bowl from the overflow tank. Following this event, small increases
in reactivity were noted each time salt was returned from the overflow
tank even though the pump-bowl level was kept above 50%.

Several pressure-release experiments were performed near the end of
run 7 (July 1966) to determine whether the circulating void fraction was
higher than that observed a year ago. Since, by this time, salt was con-
tinuously transferring to the overflow tank at the normal pump-bowl level,
experiments could be performed at different pump-~bowl levels with the
same reactor outlet temperature. Experiments were performed at both high
and low power levels, and cne was performed at an abnormally low temper-
ature.

Preliminary evaluations have been made of the void fractions at each
condition, and the results are shown in Table 1.3. The results of two of
the earlier tests (performed July 2, 1965) are included for reference.
Although additional experiments are necessary to elucidate the situation,
some conclusions can be drawn. It appears that the circulating vold
fraction at the end of run 7 was substantially higher than during the
zero-power experiments. The results also show a substantial dependence

on salt temperature, at least at pump-bowl levels above 50%. This de~
pendence may be related to the effect of salt viscosity on the bubble rise
velocity.

There are some inconsistencies in the measured void fractions. These
may be due in part to the uncertainties in compensating for side effects
during the pressure release, Tor example, pressure sensitivity of the
level-indicating devices and transient nuclear periods during control-rod
adjustment. There is also a basic difference between the void fractions
measured by the two methods in Table 1.3. The pump-bowl level measure-
ments indicate the average void fraction in the entire primary loop, while
the control-rod measurements indicate only the average void fraction in
the core. Thus, 1f there were any tendency for volds to concentrate in a
particular location, either in or outside the core, differing results
could be expected. Furthermore, there may be some dependence on the im-
mediate past history of the reactor. If, for example, the bubbles circu-
lating at low pressure are very stable and are inefficiently stripped, a
level change just prior to a test could produce misleading results. De-
talled evaluations of these and other effects will be included in future
analyses.

1.5 Salt Transport

H. B. Piper

Gradual Transfer to Overflow Tank

 

Early operation of the reactor showed that by some unexplained
mechanism salt gradually accumulated in the fuel pump overflow tank even
when the salt level in the pump bowl was well below the overflow point.
The transfer rate depended on salt level, and the transfer ceased when
the level was about 3 in. below the overflow point. This situation ex-
isted until about April 1966, when transfer began to be observed at lower
salt levels. The rate appeared to increase gradually as time went on
until it leveled off in June and July at 0.57 1b of salt per hour, in-
dependent of salt level as far down as 4.7 in. below the overflow point.
The change occurred at the time of the stepwise increase in power, but
no mechanism connecting the two has been identified. This transfer has
no i111 effect on operation of the reactor other than imposing the require-
ment that the overflow tank be emptied three times a week to keep the
levels in the desired operating range.

Overfill

At the conclusion of operation in July, the fuel loop was filled
with flush salt to rinse out residual pockets of fuel salt, thus re-
ducing the radiation levels for scheduled work in the reactor cell. We
decided to transfer flush salt into the overflow tank for two reasons:
25

to flush out the residual fuel and to check the indicated level at the
overflow point. Transfer began when the indicated level was 9.6 in.

(In January 1965 the indicated level at the overflow point had been 9.2
in.) Approximately 0.6 ft? of salt had been transferred when suddenly
the fuel pump level rose sharply offscale. Rising level in the overflow
tank triggered a drain, but not before salt had entered some of the lines
connected to the top of the pump bowl. What had happened was that the
salt level in the flush tank had been lowered too far, allowing the pres-
surlzing gas to enter the fill line and pass up into the reactor vessel.
The gas expanded rapidly as it rose through the salt, causing salt to
flood the pump bowl. The pump-bowl bubbler reference line was plugged
with frozen salt, and enough salt was frozen In the sampler tube to
obstruct passage of the latch. A thermocouple indicated that some salt
also entered the off-gas line, but this line was not plugged. Salt also
froze in the annulus around the fuel-pump shaft, preventing its rotation.

This incident was caused by human error. The level to which the
overflow tank wag to be filled is within the range easily attainable with
fuel salt. But the volume of flush salt in the reactor is less, and, In
order to reach the specified level in the overflow tank, it was necessary
that the salt temperature be about 1200°F or above. This was overlooked
when the procedure was specified, and the loop was filled at 1140°F. This
temperature is within the range for a normal fill, and the speclal re-
quirement for this experiment was not recognized until after the incldent
had occurred.

Immediately after this mishap the overflow tank was emptied and the
loop was refilled. The pump tank was heated to 1200°F and the shaft was
freed. Subsequently electric heaters were applied to the outside of the
lines to melt out the salt in the bubbler reference line and the sampler
tube. The short flexible portion of the off-gas line was replaced be-
cause of uncertainty over the possible effects of salt in the convolutions.

1.6 Power Measuremenhs

H. B. Piper C. H. Gabbard

Heat Balance

The nuclear power produced in the MSRE is determined by an overall
gystem heat balance. During early operation at low power (below ~1.0 Mw)
uncertainties in measuring small temperature differences ylelded a large
percentage error in the computed heat balance. However, as the power
was raised to intermediate levels, the uncertainties in the heat balance
calculation became less and good confidence was established in the heat
balance power. Since the heat balance is the primary power standard,
all nuclear power instruments were calibrated to agree with it. As the
power was raised, the calibration of the nuclear instruments changed, and
a disagreement in power indication existed between the nuclear instru-
ments and the heat balance. (This disagreement will be'discussed later
in this section.)
The heat-balance calculation in the computer remains unchanged, but
the method for obtaining a zero-power base line has been modified. Ini-
tially, a constant "heat loss" term along with zero-power temperature
biases were used to establish the heat balance zero power. It was noted,
however, that with the reactor producing zero power, the computed heat
balance might vary from run to run by as much as ~ #200 kw. We believe
this occurs because many thermocouples are sensitive to heater settings
and the heaters may not be set exactly the same for each run. This
difference represents an error of only *2.7% when we run at 7.5 Mw.
Nevertheless, at the beginning of cach run, several heat balances are
taken, the value of the discrepancy is determined, and this value is
entered in the heat-balance calculation as a new value of the "heat loss"
term, thus yielding a corrected power for the remainder of each rua.

Nuclear Instruments

The agreement between the heat-balance power and the power indicated
by the nuclear instruments was better than * ~10% from 2 to about 6 Mw.
(Heat balances have a scatter of + ~200 kw, and this is independent of
power; below 2 Mw the percentage scatter is large.) Above this level the
two power indications began to diverge, with the nuclear instruments ine
dicating 15 to 20% high at a heat-balance power of 7.5 Mw. After in-
vestigating, with negative results, several mechanisms which might explain
the disagreement, it was postulated that the effect might have been

caused by a rise in welfer temperature in the nuclear instrument pene-
tration (NIP) as the power was increased. This was found to be the case.
When the ratio of heat-balance power to nuclear-instrument power was
plotted vs NIP temperature, a good correlation with a negative slope re-
sulted. This plot showed that an increase of 10°F in the NIP water tem-
perature produced an increase of 450 kw, or about 6%, in the power indi-
cation from the nuclear instruments at a level power of 7.5 Mw. This
anomaly could be caused by temperature sensitivity of the nuclear instru-
ments, but we believe the most likely explanation of the temperature
sensitivity 1s the change in the attenuation characteristics of water with
temperature. On June 27, a heat exchanger system was placed in operation
to cool the water in the NIP. As the NIP water temperature decreased, the
ratio between heat-balance power and nuclear-instrument power approached
unity. The heat exchanger used was immediately available, but it does

not have the capacity to hold the NIP water temperature constant at all
power levels. From zero to full power, there is now a temperature rise

of ~18°F as compared to ~72°F before the heat exchanger was installed.
There 1s still a shift of about 5% between the two power measurements

from zero to full power.

Radiator Air Flow

Because of the lack of agreement between the heat-balance power and
that indicated by the nuclear instruments, we attempted to verify the
power by determining the amount of heat removed from the radiator by the
air. The inherent uncertainty in determining the reactor power by a heat
27

balance around the air side of the radiator is great because of diffi-
culties in measurement of both the alr flow and the temperatures. These
difficulties arise from the fact that the coolant stack is not long enough
(L/D = 7) for symmetrical flow to be established. Even so, calculations
were made using the best data available for this evaluation. The heat
removed by the alr was determined for reactor power levels of 4, 5.8, and
7 Mw, as measured by the overall system heat balance, and was found to be
1% low, 16% high, and 15% high respectively. This is considered to be a
reasonable confirmation of the system heat-balance method.

1.7 Radiation Heating

C. H. Gabbard H. B. Piper

The effects of radiation heating on some of the MSRE components were
evaluated both during the approach to full power and during sustained
operation at high power. Of particular interest in this area are the
fuel-pump tank, the reactor vessel, and the thermal shield. (The effects
of fission product radiation heating in the off-gas piping are discussed
in connection with other observations of that system in Sect. 1.9, sub-
section entitled "Fuel Off-Gas System").

The upper portion of the fuel-pump tank is subject to substantial
heating from fission products in the gas space above the salt. Since
the useful life of the pump tank is limited by thermal-stress considera-
tions at the Junction of the volute support cylinder with the spherical
top of the tank, close control was maintained over the temperatures in
this region. Design studies’ had indicated that the maximum lifetime
would result if the Junction temperature were kept about 100°F below the
temperature on the tank surface 6 in. out from the junction. Component
cooling air is provided to maintain this temperature distribution. A
secondary consideration in controlling the temperatures was a desire to
keep as much of the pump tank as possible above the liquidus temperature
of the salt.

In operating the reactor, it would be ideal if a fixed flow rate of
air over the pump tank would provide a satisfactory temperature distribu-~
tion for all conditions. Farly design calculations indicated that this
condition could be met with an air flow of 200 cfm. However, temperature
measurements on the pump-test loop and during the initial heatup of the
MSRE indicated that only about 50 cfm would be reguired and that the air
would have to be turned off when the pump tank was empty.

To minimize the temperature effects when the cooling air is turned
on, alr flow during power operation should be the minimum that gives the
desired temperatures. It was found that an air flow of 30 cfm provides
a satisfactory temperature distribution at all power levels up to 7.5 Mw.
Figure 1.7 shows the temperatures in the two regions of interest as a
function of reactor power level with this air flow. The variations in

the individual temperatures are caused by variatlons in pump~bowl level,
salt temperature, and air flow. Both the individual temperatures and

the temperature difference increase linearly with power, as expected.
Although the temperature difference would exceed 100°F at powers much
gbove 7.5 Mw, the reactor could be operated at 10 Mw with the 30-cfm air
flow without significantly reducing the life of the pump tank. However,
variation of the air flow could also be employed to obtain closer control
of the temperatures.

Reactor Vessel

Since radiation-produced heat in the reactor-vessel walls must be
transferred to the salt for removal, the outer surfaces of the vessel
are hotter than the adjacent salt by an amount that is proportional to -
the reactor power. Any deposition of solids on the inner surfaces would
reduce the heat transfer (and increase the heat production) and lead to
st111 higher temperatures at the outer surfaces. There are two locations
in the reactor vessel where solids would tend to accumulate if they were
present in the circulating salt. These are the lower head and the lugs,

Just above the inlet volute, which support the core matrix. Deviations
from the normal surface temperatures might also indicate changes in the
core flow pattern.

Although there has been no evidence, whatever, of solids in the
molten salts, the differences between the reactor-vessel temperatures
and the salt inlet temperature have been carefully monitored. Since
the salt inlet temperature can be measured only at the inlet line and
there is some fisslon heat generation in the salt as it flows to the
areas in question, the observed Al's do not represent the actual tem-
perature drops across the walls. However, the proportionality to power
should exist, and there should be no change with time.
29

Throughout the power operation of the reactor, the temperature dif-
ference between the vessel wall at the core-support lugs and the salt
inlet has been 2.0 * 0.1°F/Mwv, and that between the lower head and the
salt inlet has been 1.5 + 0.2°F/Mw. There has been no indication of
deviation from linearity with power or of changes with time in either
temperature difference.

Thermal Shield

The function of the thermal shield around the reactor vessel is to
reduce the radiation level and radiation heating in the rest of the re-
actor cell. As a result, a substantial amount of fast-neutron and gamma
energy is deposited in this shield. The cooling system for the thermal
shield was designed to remove up to 600 kw to allow for uncertainties in
the rate of heat generation at power. Measurements of the heat load on
the thermal shield gave a zero-power value of 40 kw due to heat losses
from the reactor furnace and an additional 17 kw per megawatt of reactor
power due to radiation heating.

1.8 Reactor Dynamics

T. W. Kerlin 5S. J. Ball

The inherent stability of the reactor system was investigated by
frequency response tests at eight power levels from zero to full power.
The testing methods, analysis procedures, and results of tests at powers
to 1 Mw are described in detail in the last progress report .® Subse-
quently, tests were conducted at 2.5, 5.0, 6.7, and 7.5 Mw using pseu-
dorandom binary reactivity insertions, pulse reactivity insertions, and
step reactivity insertions. At each power level, essentially equivalent
results were obtained from the different tests.

A readily obtainable result is the natural period of oscillation of
the reactor power following a disturbance in reactivity. This information
can be obtained by simply observing the flux transient if the response is
lightly damped or by determining the frequency of the peak in the ampli-
tude of the frequency response. The experimental results agree very well
with previous theoretical predictions,’ as shown in Fig. 1.8.

The measured frequency resconse results for power levels of 2.5 Mw
and higher are shown in Figs. 1.9 to 1.12 along with the theoretical
predictions. The theoretical phase predictions agree with the experi-
mental results within the experimental scatter. All the tests at a given
power level give magnitude ratios having the same shape but differing in
their absolute values. Furthermore, the portions of the frequency re-
sponses above 0.3 radian/sec should be the same for all power levels,
since feedback effects are small in this frequency range and the zero-
power frequency response should dominate. The experimental results for
30

various power levels show the same shape in this frequency region but
different absolute amplitudes. Both of these inconsistencies indicate a
bias problem which is apparently due to equipment limitations.*® These
equipment difficulties are not surprising, since we wanted to be able to
position the control rod with an accuracy better than 0.050 in. in the
dynamics tests; this far exceeded design specifications.

We previously thought ® that a simple adjustment of several paramaters
in the theoretical model could force agreement between theory and experi-
ment. An adjustment made to minimize the error at 1.0 Mw also produced
agreement at 0.075 Mw and 0.465 Mw. This now appears to have been for-
tuitous, since the same parameter adjustments increase the discrepancies
at power levels greater than 1.0 Mw.

The net conclusions are that the dynamic characteristics of the sys-
tem are quite satisfactory and in reasonable agreement with predictions.
The system is stable at all operating power levels, and the stability in-
creases with power level. The theoretical model appears to be satis-
factory in spite of unfortunate equipment limitations which prevent de-
tailed parameter fitting.

1.9 Equipment Performance

 

Heat Transfer — C. H. Gabbard, H. B. Piper, and R. J. Kedl

As the reactor power was raised, the heat-transfer capability of the
air-cooled radiator was found to be less than expected and, in fact, to
limit the attainable heat removal to about 7.5 Mw. The overall heat~
transfer coefficient of the primary heat exchanger was also below the
predicted value, resulting in somewhat larger fuel-coolant temperature
differences than had been planned. fter the first indications of low
heat transfer, we reexamined the reactor data to determine heat-transfer
coefficients as accurately as possible and to see if the coefficients
varied with power level or operating time. Meanwhile, we reviewed the
original design work to see if there were errors in the caleulational
method or physical properties that could account for the discrepancy be-
tween the predicted and observed performance.

Primary Heat Exchanger. Because of the elevated temperatures and
relatively small temperature differences in the primary heat exchanger,
a proper accounting for thermocouple errors is essential to an accurate
calculation of heat-transfer coefficient. The performance was evaluated
by two procedures, which differed mainly in the method of handling thermo-
couple biases.

The essential feature of the first procedure, used routinely at the
MSRE, is a statistical fit of a theoretical relation to a large nuwrber of
temperature measurements at different power levels. The formulation is
such that biases in thermocouples, if constant, do not significantly af-
feet the outcome and need not be evaluated. The effect of random error
in thermocouple output is minimized by using many sets of data. The
relation used to evaluate the overall heat transfer coefficient, U, is

During operation, the terms in the derivative on the left are computed

and logged by the on-line computer. These values can be retrieved and a
slope determined from the plot of one against the other.

The other procedure, used as a check on the results of the first,
is in some respects more straightforward. A set of temperatures 1s meas-
ured, and a value of U is calculated from the conventional heat-transfer
equation

 

where
U = overall heat-transfer coefficient,
Q = heat transferred, computed from a coolant-salt heat
balance,

bends, based on the tube OD,
MN = log mean temperature difference.

Temperatures used in the calculation of Al, and @ are obtained by adding
a bias correction to each thermocouple indication. Biases are determined
by logging a complete set of thermocouple readings when the reactor is
operating at a steady, very low power, so that the salts should be iso-
thermal throughout the fuel and coolant loops. The bias for each thermo-
couple is then taken to be the difference between the average of all the
thermocouples and that particular thermocouple.

Heat~transfer coefficients calculated by the two methods are shown
in Fig. 1.13. The continuous curve for the "derivative" method was ob-
tained by fitting data points taken over two periods of time: three
weeks in April and May and seven weeks in May and June. The two sets of
data gave identical results. The "conventional" points were obtained on
May 26. A dependence of heat-transfer coefficients on power level, as
exhibited in the results of both methods, is to be expected. As the power
is raised with the core outlet temperature held constant, the averages tem-
peratures of the salts in the heat exchanger decrease. According to con-
ventional formulas for heat-transfer coefficients, the changes in salt
properties (primarily specific heat and viscosity) could account for
practically all the observed variation.

REACTOR POWER (Mw)

Design calculations had predicted an overall heat-transfer coeffi-
cient at 10 Mw of 1100 Btu hr~t £t=2 (°F)~t. (This was for the straight
portion of the tubes, in a clean condition.) This is about a factor of
2 above the coefficients observed at temperatures approximating those
used in the design. In an effort to resolve the discrepancy, the design
calculations were carefully reviewed to see 1If the proper procedures were
used and to check for errors in the calculations. The results of this
design review indicated that the heat exchanger had been properly designed
using conventional procedures and that the design should have been con-
servative by about 20%. References 11 and 12 indicate that conventional
heat~transfer relations are valid for molten salts, and therefore the
conventional design procedures should be applicable for the MSRE neat ex-
changer. The most likely explanation for the discrepancy appears to be
erroneous values of salt conductivity in the design computations. Recent
measurements of a salt similar in composition to the MSRE fuel salt have
shown the thermal conductivity to be about one-third of the value that
was believed to be correct at the time of the heat exchanger design (see
Chap. 7). No recent data are yet available on the conductivity of the
coclant salt; but if a similar discrepancy exists, this would essentially
account for the reduced performance of the heat exchanger.

Radiator. The design and instrumentation of the air radiator pre-
clude a calculation of the overall heat-transfer coefficient at all but
two power levels. At most reduced power conditions the radiator doors
are partially closed or the bypass damper is open; thus the effective
tube area, the air flow through the radiator, and the downstream alr tem-
perature are unknown. Therefore the reduced performance was not obvious

power of the air flow rate, agreeing with a theoretical exponent of 0.6.

. . el . el
But the predicted coefficient at full-power conditions was 58 Btu hr
£72 (°F)™', far above the observed value.

The radiator design was reviewed to determine the reason for the un-
expectedly low performance. The design procedures followed conventional
practice except in two important points: the evaluation of air properties
and the allowance for error in the predictions. In the calculation of
the air~side coefficient the pnysical opropertles of air were evaluated at
the tube surface temperature instead of the prescribed "film" temperature,
defined as the mean of the surface temperature and the bulk air tempera-
ture. Had the "film" temperature been used, the overall coefficient would
have been lower by 14%. Use of an erroneous value for the conductivity of
the salt had little effect on the overall coefficient, since the heat-
transfer resistance on the inside of the tubes is less than 5% of the
total in any case. Thus, even when the air-side calculation followed the
prescribed Tormula, the observed overall coefficient was still only 66%
of the predicted value. This is greater than the usual error in heat-
transfer predictions, bul 1s probably not unreasonable considering the
configuration of the radiator and the very large temperature difference
between the bulk of the alr and the surface of the tubes. The radiator
was designed when the nominal design power for the reactor was 5 Mw. The
components were designed for operation at 10 Mw to ensure sufficient
capacity; and when it was later decided to call the MSRE a 10-Mw reactor,
this left them with little or no allowance for uncertainty. The actual
tube area is only 4% more than the minimum required for 10-Mw operation
according to the original calculations.

Effects of Low Heat Transter on Reactor Operation. In the main heat
exchanger the reduced heat transfer causes a larger temperature difference
between the fuel and coolant salts for any given power level. The origi-
nal design temperatures for 10-Mw operation were 1225 and 1175°F for the
fuel salt entering and leaving the heat exchanger and 1025 and 1100°F for
the coolant salt. Actually, operation at a maximum fuel temperature of
1225°F and a minimum coolant temperature of 1025°F results in a heat-
transfer rate of 7.5 Mw. It would be possible to operate the heat
exchanger at higher power levels by increasing the heat exchanger fuel
inlet temperature and/or reducing the coolant inlet temperature. How-
ever, for long-term operation the heat exchanger fuel inlet temperature
is limited to a maximum of 1250°F by thermal stress and stress rupture
considerations, and the coolant inlet temperature is limited to a minimum
temperature of 1000°F by the possibility of freezing the radiator. Op-
eration at these temperature conditions would approach 10 Mw. The heat-
transfer rate could also be improved by increasing the fuel and coolant-
salt flow rates. The flow rates could be increased either by installing
larger-diameter impellers or by increasing the pump speeds by using a
higher~frequency power supply.

 

The reduced performance of the coolant radiator, however, imposes a
definite limit on the heat-removal rate from the coolant system, and there
is no convenient method of increasing the heat removal. The mean tem-
perature difference between the coolant salt and the bulk-alir temperature
is 920°F, and the coolant-s3alt temperature would have to be increased
39

significantly before a gain in reactor power could be realized. The fuel-
inlet temperature to the heat exchanger would then be pushed to an un-
acceptable level.

In summary, the maximum reactor power level is limited by the air-
side heat transfer from the coolant radiator. There is also a less severe
restriction at the main heat exchanger which could ve clrcumvented by op-
erating the reactor system at off-design temperatures. The radiator heat
transfer can be improved only by relatively extensive modifications.

There will be a small increase in maximum power level during the winter
months because of the lower amblent air temperatures.

Main Blowers — C. H. Gabbard

Aerodynamic Performance. The aerodynamic performance of the main
blowers was satisfactory. The vane angle on both blowers had veen set
at 20°, as originally specified by the manufacturer for the design con-
ditions. However, this vane setting did not fully load the drive motors;
20 when the maximum reactor power was found to be below the expected
value, the vane angle was increased to 22.5° to increase the air flow and
heat removal. As expected, this setting loaded the drive motors to their
capacity and increaged the air flow about 10%. The effect was to raise
maximum reactor power by slightly less than 1/2 Mw.

 

Motors. The blowers are driven by 250«hp wound-rotor induction
motors that have four stages of external rotor resistance. Automatic
stepping switches shunt out these resistances in a timed sequence during
the startup of the blower to limit the starting current of the motors.
During the early stages of power operation, difficulty was periodically
experienced In the start of main blower No. 1. The motor current during
the starts was erratic, and sometimes the current was high enough to trip
the circuit breaker. One of the cast-iron resistance grids in the ex-
ternal rotor resistance on MB-1 was found broken. A broken grid was also
found in the MB-3 starting resistors, but this grid was in a less critical
location in the starting sequence and its effect had not been noticed.
Both the grids were weld-repaired, and no further difficulties of this
type have been noticed.

Coupling Failure. The blowers are connected to their respective
drive motors through short floating shafts with disk-type flexible
couplings on each end. On June 14, while the reactor was operating at
full power, the couplings on MB-1 failed. The shaft coupling at the
motor end apparently failed first, and the coupling on the blower end
was then torn apart by the resulting shalt whip. The shaft destroyed
the coupling gaard and damaged the sheet-metal nose that covered the
front bearing of the blower. Debris from the two couplings was scabbered
throughout the fan room, and scratches on the fan blades indicated that
some of the material had gone through the blowers into the radiator duct.

The coupling on the motor end of the shaft showed evidence of op~
erating in a partially failed condition for some time. The nuts holding
the flexible disks were severely worn, indicating that the motor torque
had been transmitted from the motor flange directly to the shaft flange
40

by the bolts rather than through the flexible disks. The initial failure
of the disks was attributed to fatigue where some incorrect, flat washers
had caused high stresses.

The couplings on MB-1 were rebuilt, and new flexible shims were in-
stalled in the MB-3 couplings. Operation was resumed after the radiator
duct wag cleaned and inspection of the hot radiator tubes showed no dam-
age to the tubes.

Blade and Hub Fallure. Power operation was brought to a premature
end on July 17 by the catastrophic failure of the rotor hub and the
blading of MB-1l. The outer periphery of the rotor hub disintegrated, and
all the blading was destroyed. Most of the fragments were contalned in
the blower housing, but numerous fragments of the cast aluminum-alloy hub
and blades entered the radiator duct and some actually passed through the
radiator. The reactor was taken to very low power, and the coolant was
drained to determine the cause of the failure, to inspect the other blower,
and to examine the radiator for possible damage.

 

Inspection of the broken pieces of MB-1 revealed numerous "old"
cracks in the blades and in the hub as evidenced by darkened or dirty
areas on the fractured surfaces. One blade in particular had falled along
a large "old" crack. The hub had contained short, 1-1/2 to 2 in., cir-
cunferential cracks at the base of 8 of the 16 blade sockets, and the
failure generally followed those cracks. Figure 1.14 is a piece of the
hub showing the darkened areas at the base of the blade sockets.

Since the failed blower had contained these old cracks, the top
casing was removed from MB~3 to permit a careful inspection of its hub
and blading. The front hub casting contained a large, continuous crack
which extended about 35% around the circumference. There were also several
of the short cracks similar to those that had been in the MB-1 hub. The
blades were dye-penetrant inspected and found to be satisfactory. A re-
placement blower that had not been in service also contained some minor
surface cracks in the hub.

There is no general agreement on the cause of the failure. The
original soundness of the hub castings is in question because of the
old appearance of portions of the fracture surfaces and the presence of

cracks in the other blower hubs. Shock forces produced during the
coupling failure and vibration due to slight imbalances are suspected
as contributing factors.

The three blowers are being rebuilt in the manufacturer's plant.
The hubs are being reinforced to relieve the bending moment at the base
of the blade sockets, and the centrifugal blade loading is being reduced
by substituting magnesium alloy blades which are 35% lighter. The three
complete rotor assemblies will be given a 30% overspeed test with dye-
penetrant inspections before and after the tests. In the installation,
close tolerances will be imposed on alignment and vibration, and instru-
mentation wlll be provided to monitor vibration during operation.

Radiator Enclosure — T. L. Hudson, C. H. Gabbard, and M. Richardson

Operation of the reactor at power provided the ultimate test of the
radiator enclosure, involving for the first time the operation of the
radiator at the maximum capability with the doors fully open and with
forced air circulation. Operation at power levels up to 1.0 Mw had
been achieved during the last report period. This operation had indi-
cated that the radiator door seals had become less effective during op-
eration. The loss 1n door-seal effectiveness continued during this re-
port period.

Power Level at Various Radiator Conditions. During the power es-
calation phase of operation, the radiator conditions were adjusted to
obtain preselected power levels. Therefore, the complete heat-removal
characteristics of the radiator are not known because the reactor has
operated at steady-state conditions at relatively few power levels. How-
ever, the reactor power levels for some of the key settings are listed
in Table L.4. All intermediate power levels can be obtained by the
proper adjustment of the doors or the bypass damper.

Salt Frozen in Tubes. One of the main considerations during the
design of the radiator enclosure was to avold the freezing of salt in
the radiator tubes. The expansion of salt during thawing was helieved
capable of rupturing a tube if the thawing first occurred in the center
section of a tube, so that the molten salt was confined between two fro-
zen plugs. A "load scram," which dropped the radiator doors and shopped
the main blowers when the radiator salt outlet temperature dropped be-
low 900°F, was provided to prevent salt from being frozen in the radia-
tor. However, salt was frozen in the radiator tubes on two occasions
and was successfully melted out with no apparent damage to the radia-
tor.

 

In both cases, the freezing occurred as a result of a rod and load
scram combined with a stoppage of the coolant pump. The first freezeup
occurred when a defective relay caused a "rod scram" from a 5.0-Mw power
level. The radiator load was scrammed manually at 1000°F because of the
rapidly decreasing temperatures, but the coolant pump was stopped by a
low level in the pump bowl which resulted from the reduced temperature.
With circulation stopped, heat losses froze some salt in 30 or more of
the 120 tubes. The second freezeup occurred as a result of an electrical
failure which caused a stoppage of the coolant pump and a scram of the
rods and load. In both cases the coolant system was drained immediately,
but the drain-tank weight indicated that some salt had remained in the
coolant system.

Recent data indicate that the volume change during the thawing of
coolant salt is relatively small. This low volume change, plus the
fact that the normal temperature distribution during heating of the ra-
distor would cause progressive thawing of the tubes from the top to the
bottom, gave confidence that the radiator could be thawed without dam-
age. In the first freezing incident, the radiator was reheated slowly
and all the remaining salt was recovered in the drain tank. A pressure
test was then conducted on the entire coolant system to check for rup-
tured tubes. There was no indication of leakage. After the second
freezing incident, increased heat leakage from the radiator enclosure
prevented a portion of the radiator from reaching the melting point,
and some salt remained frozen in the tubes. However, the lowest Lem-
peratures were sufficiently near the melting point that the coolant
system was filled and circulated. The radiator temperatures indicated
that four or five of the tubes were blocked at first, but after several
minutes of salt circulation all the tubes thawed and reached the tempera-
ture of the flowing salt.

After the first freezing incident, the control system was revised
so that a rod scram would also cause a load scram. The low-temperature
set point for a load scram was increased from 900°F, which is only 60°F
above the liquidus temperature, to 990°F., Other revisions were made so
that the coolant pump would not be turned off unless absolutely neces-
sary. A scram test was conducted from full power, and these revisions
were adequate to prevent freezing of the radiator as long as the coolant
pump remained running.
43

Damage and Deterioration. The radiator was subjected to possible
damage on two occasions from mechanical failures of main blower No. 1.
Pieces of stainless steel shim stock were blown into the radiator duct
when the shaft coupling failed. The radiator tubes were visually in-
spected from the inlet side while salt was circulated at operating tem-
perature, and no evidence of damage from the coupling failure was found.
A loose sheet-metal cover from an electrical cable tray was found against
the tubes and was removed. Reactor operation was resumed after the ra-
diator duct was cleaned to remove the debris from the coupling.

 

The coolant system was drained and the radiator was cooled and
thoroughly inspected after the shutdown that followed the hub failure
of main blower No. 1. Several radiator tubes were dented, possibly by
aluminum fragments from the blower, and a few small pieces of aluminum
were stuck to the tubes. These pieces were easily removed, and the
tubes were cleaned to remove any adhering aluminum. Visual inspection
and a helium leak test at 20 psig indicated that none of the tubes had
been seriously damaged by the blower fragments, and tests were run that
indicated that the exposure to aluminum would nob endanger the life of
the radiator if the tubes were cleaned.

In addition to the damage that had been caused by the blower failure,
the radiator enclosure was in need of other repair. Heating the empty
radiator to an acceptable temperature distribution prior to a fill had
become increasingly difficult, and on the last fill some of the tubes
could not be heated above the melting point of salt until the radiator
was filled and circulation started. The radiator doors had warped a
little, and the seal strips had been severely distorted. The seal strips
had also been torn loose in some places by the operation of the doors.
Numerous sheet-metdl screws had broken or had worked loose, allowing
sheet-metal cable~tray covers and sheet metal on the inside surfaces of
the enclosure to come loose. There were also numerous broken electrical
insulators.

Although there was excessive heat leakage from the radiator enclo-
sure, this was mainly around the doors, and the overheating of electrical
leads and thermocouple leads that had occurred previously did not recur.

The repalr of the radiator enclosure 1s in progress. Design of
the seal strip has been improved to reduce the thermal distortion and
the overall warpage of the doors. This seal strip is segmented and
free to move to allow for differential thermal expansion, and the T-
bar which holds these segments has been slotted to relieve thermal
stresses which were causing the door to warp. The loose sheet metal
and the loose ceramic heater elements are being held in place with
welded clips rather than the sheet-metal screws.

Fuel Off-Gas System —- A. N. Smith

The difficulties encountered with the fuel off-gas system during
the initial operation of the reactor at power, the findings and con-
clusions relative to the causes of thes difficulties, and the system
modifications proposed to prevent the recurrence of the difficulties
4d,

were all described in the last progress report. The modifications,
which consisted essentially in using valves with larger flow areas and
installing a particle {rap and an organic-vapor trap upstream of the
pressure-control valve (PCv-522), were all completed before resuming
power operation of the reactor in April 1966. Observable pressures
and temperatures in the off-gas system were carcfully monitored during
all subsequent operations, partly to evaluate the effectiveness of the
changes but primarily to identify and correct any undesirable conditions
before they became unmanageable. Some difficulties were encountered
with buildup of pressure drop, bul none were serious enough to force a
shutdown. In addition, there was no observable loss in efficiency of
the primary function of the off-gas system, the retention of gaseous
fission products.

Detailed analysis of the performance of some components, particularly
the particle trap and the organic-vapor trap, was hampered somewhat by the
scarcity of accessible pressure-measuring devices in the system. This was
aggravated by the fact that the pressure drop across the main charcoal
beds occasionally exceeded the 3-psi range of the installed (and inacces-
sible during operation) measuring instrument and also by the failure of
this instrument ten days before the shutdown on July 17.

Line 522 Holdup Volume. When plugging occurred at several points
in the off-gas system shortly after the power was first raised, it was
suggested that the dependence on power might be related to radiation
heating of the off-gas holdup volume in the reactor cell. Off-gas
samples taken while the reactor was shut down in March with the reactor
cell at different temperatures showed more hydrocarbons ab higher tem-
peratures, lending support to the hypothesis that there was a reservoir
of hydrocarbons in the holdup volume. + was nol practicable to clean
the 68-ft-long, 4-in.-diam pipe; but the off-gas line was disconnected
at the fuel pump and in the vent house, and large quantities of helium
were blown through the line in the forward and reverse directions at
velocities up to 20 times normal. Very little visible material was
collected on filters at the ends of the line, but there were fission
products, and the amount doubled when the cell was heated from 120 to
175°. Visual observation showed that the head end of the holdup volume
was clean except for a barely perceptible dustlike film. A thermocouple
was attached to the holdup pipe near the head end for monitoring tem-
peratures during power operation. When the power was subsequently
raised, the temperature rose from cell air temperature (about 130°F)
at zero power to about 235°F at 7.5 Mw. The rise in temperature after
a setup from zero power occurred with a time constant of about 30 min,
not inconsistent with hulldup of gaseous fission products in the line.

 

Line 522 Filter Assembly. The filter assembly that was installed
upstream of the fuel pressure control valve (PCV-522) consists of two
separate units in series. First is a filter to remove particulates and
mist; next, a small charcoal bed to remove organic vapors. (See Compo~-
nent Development, Chap. 2, for a detailed description.) Ag a result of
the experience during this period of operation, the filter part of the
assembly will be replaced with a new one of the same design. The old
unit will be examined in a hot cell to determine, if possible, the cause
for the variations in pressure drop that were observed.

 
45

In the new condition, the pressure drops across the particle trap
and charcoal bed were <0.05 and 0.7 psi respectively. With these in-~
stalled, the total pressure drop in the fuel off-gas system was about
2.3 psi at the normal gas flow rate of 4.2 std Liters nin and PCV-522
wide open. Thus, when the reactor-system overpressure was controlled
at 5 peig, a 2.7-psl pressure drop occurred at the throttling valve.
Because there were no measurements of pressures at intermediate points
between the pump bowl and the upstream ends of the main charcoal beds,
the pressure drop across the filter assembly was known only to be below
3.4 psi. This condition prevailed wmtil May 9, during operation of the
reactor at powers up to 5 Mw. There was no indication that the pressure
drop across the filter assembly reached the detectable limit of 3.4 psi
during this time.

During most of the operations after May 9, PCV-522 was kept wide
open, allowing the fuel overpressure to follow the total pressure drop
through the other parts of the off-gas line. This mode of operation
permitted the monitoring of the pressure drop across the filter assembly.
For the first ten days the overall trend in the pressure drop was upward,
with increases after the power was raised and decreases after it was low-
ered. On May 19, with the power at 5 Mw, the pressure drop was up to 8
psi. The power was shut down to redistribute the electrical load, bub
the pressure drop continued on up, even though the gas flow was reduced.
On May 20, shielding was removed, and a pressure gage was temporarily
attached to a tap between the particle trap and the charcoal filter to
determine which was responsible for the high flow resistance. The drop
measured across the trap was 9.9 psi, while the drop across the charcoal
was only 0.5 psi. Thus the increase in resistance was due entirely to
the particle trap. System pressure was reduced by venting from the drain
tanks, and the power was raised to determine maximum power. With the re-
actor operating at 7.5 Mw the filter pressure drop decreased to about 3
psi. Then when the power was lowered to zero, the pressure drop came
down over a period of a day to less than 1 psi. The pressure drop re-
mained low until July 12, when it began to increase gradually. The in-
crease continued after the shutdown, and the unit will be replaced.

The particle trap was immersed in a tank of water for cooling by
natural convection. Thermocouples on the outside of the trap responded
to changes in power and gas flow, bub the maximum temperature rise was
only about 25°F.

It was expected that accumulation of organic material in the char-
coal filter would result in progressive poisoning along the length of
the trap. Such poisoning would shift the location of maximum fission
product absorption and produce a shift in the temperature profile of
the trap. Figure 1.15a shows two plots of the charcoal temperature
profile, one on May 10, when about 1200 Mwhr had been accumulated, and
one on July 7, when about 7000 Mwhr had been accumulated. Except for
the upward shift due to the increased power level, the basic shape of
the profile is the same for both perlods, indicating that significant
poisoning had not occurred during this interval. Figure 1.15b shows
the effect of variations in pump-bowl pressure on the trap tempera-
ture profile. As would be predicted, the trap temperatures, partic-
ularly near the inlet, vary inversely with system pressure, because

as the pressure increases, the residence time of the gas between the
pump bowl and the trap increases, permitting a greater fraction of the
short-lived activity to decay before reaching the trap.

Main Charcoal Beds. The fuel off-gas was routed through bed sec~
tions 1A and 1B for the entire period of power operation with the ex-~
ception of three days at the very end, when sections 24 and 2B were
used.

The pressure drop across the charcoal beds showed a persistent
tendency to increase during power operation. Pressurization and egual-
ization experiments established that the restrictions were at the in-
lets to the beds, probably where the 1/4-in. gas line opens into a
packing of steel wool above the charcoal. Tt was found that the pres-
sure drop could be reduced, usually to near the normal 1.0 psi, by blow-
ing helium backward through the bed, This was done whenever the pres-
sure drop through the two beds in parallel approached 3 psi. Section
1B plugged more often, but sometimes restrictions built up in voth sec-
tions. The plugging of the beds occurred each time the power was raised
during the approach to full power. The plugging became less frequent
later, but at the end of power operation it was still necessary to back-
blow the beds about once a week,

Stack monitors indicated no breakthrough of activity other than
ten-year 85kr at any time. That this was so, despite the sometimes
unbalanced flow through the parallel beds and the extra volumes of gas
introduced by backblowing, is an indication of a capacity that exceeds
expectations.

Line 524 Charcoal Bed. In the fuel pump, part of the gas admitted
to the shaft annulus (about 100 ce /min) flows up along the shaft to pre-
vent oil fumes from diffusing down into the pump bowl, This gas then

 
47

flows out through the cateh basin and line 524. Originally the line-
524 flow joined the main off-gas stream just downstream of PCV-522,
whose pressure drop supplied the driving force for the gas flow through
524, Line 524 was rerouted to come in downstream of the main charccal
ved for two reasons: to get more pressure drop when PCV-522 was open
and to eliminate a possible way that hydrocarbons could enter the char-
coal beds. Some manipulations of the system pressure caused activity
to get into line 524, resulting in closure of the radiation-block valves
at the end of the off-gas line. Therefore a small charcoal bed was added
in line 524 to hold up fission gases and prevent stack releases by this
route (see "Component Development," Chap. 2).

Auxiliary Charcoal Bed. Prior to the startup on April 11, dif-
ficulty in venting through the auxiliary charcoal bed was found to be
due to a check-valve poppet which had become lodged in the bed inlet
line. The poppet had apparently vibrated loose from a check valve at
one of the drain-tank outlet lines and had been carried downstream dur-
ing subsequent venting operations. After removal of the poppet, venting
operations through the auxiliary bed were uneventful through most of
the power operations. However, an intermittent restriction was noted
early in July, and, after the shutdown on July 17, the restriction be-
came continuous and more severe. Furthermore, the situation was not
relieved by reversing the gas flow (backblowing). Pressure and flow
tests indicated that the plug was in the same area as in the main char-
coal beds, namely, at the place where the gas header connects to the
charcoal bed.

 

An attempt will be made to remove the restriction by local external
heating. At the same time, we are designing and building a replacement
bed, protected by an inlet filter, that can be installed and connected
with a minimum of reactor shutdown time.

Treated Cooling-Water System — R. B. lindauer

 

Chemical Treatment. During power operation of the reactor, radio-
lytic decomposition of treated cooling water in the thermal shield pro-
duced hydrogen peroxide in a concentration of 300 to 500 ppm. This
caused oxidation of the lithium nitrite corrosion inhibitor to lithium
nitrate, Additional nitrite was added periodically until equilibrium
was reached at approximately equal concentrations (~700 ppm) of nitrite
and nitrate. This occurred at about 3000 Mwhr, and no additional ni-
trite addition was required after that time. The presence of the ni-~
trate ion has no effect on the corrosion inhibition.

Radiolytic Gas Formation. Because of the inhibiting effect of the
corrosion inhibitor on the recombination of radiolytic gases, approxi-
nately 2 £52 far of hydrogen was formed in the thermal shield during op-
eration at full power. At steady state, about 8 £53 of radiolytic gas
accumulated in the thermal shield and thermal-shield slides. About one-
fourth of this accumulated gas was removed by partially deaerating, in
a small vented tank, the cooling water supplied to the slides. A larger
degassing tank is being installed to deaerate the entire thermal shield
flow. This 1s expected to keep the radioclytic~gas concentrations below

 
48

the limits of solubility and thus prevent gas pockebs from forming.

The gas that is stripped from the water will be diluted with nitrogen

to below the explosive limit and vented to the area stack. A continuous
hydrogen analyzer will be installed in the off-gas stream at the tank to
ensure adequate dilution.

In~Cell Leaks, Before full-power operation, while the reactor cell
was open, reactor cell cooler No. 2 was observed to have a small water
leak. The cooler was removed, repaired, and replaced. Some time after
the cell was resealed, a steady accumulation in the cell of 1-1/2 gpd
was observed. This water was condensed from the circulating air stream
in the cool suction line of the component-~cooling pumps. After reactor
shutdown in July, the various water-containing components in the cell
were lsolated and leak tested. All components were leak-Light except
reactor cell cooler No. 1. t wag removed, decontaminated, and repaired.
As in RCC-2 earlier, the leak was in a brazed joint between a tube and
a header.

Treated-Water Cooler. About one week before the reactor was shut
down, the total leakage from the trealted-walter system suddenly increased
from ~4 gpd to 3 to 5 gph. Since there was no visible leak or increased
accummlation in the cells; it was suspected that the water was leaking
through the treated-water cooler to the cooling-tower-water system.
After the treated-water system was shut down, the cooler was opened for
inspection and leak checking. A large amount of gray solids was found
in the shell (tower water) side around the tubes and in low-velocity
areas. All tube-to-tube sheet joints were leak tested with air and were
leak free, but a hydraulic test of the tubes indicated that 17 of the
360 tubes had leaks abt the inside surface of the tube sheet. After these
tubes were plugged and the gasket on the floating head was replaced, the
heat exchanger was leak-tight.

 

Component -Cooling System — P. H. Harley

 

The two component~cooling pumps (cep), one of which is a standby
unit, supply cell gas to cool in-cell equipment, circulate gas past a
radiation monitor, and discharge gas to keep the cell at a negative
pressure. CCP-1 operated for 1584 hr and CCP-2 operated 1759 hr during
this report period.

During the previous report period the multiple matched belts on
each CCP were replaced by a single poly-V-belt. Blower operation, al-
though improved, was not completely satisfactory because the output
was low at best, there were times when the operating pump failed com-
pletely to meet the demand, and the standby unit was sometimes slow in
building up pressure. Drive belt slippage caused the loss of a blower
on three occasions. On CCP-1 the belt bad to be retightened after 450
hr of operation and replaced after 870 hr because of damage due to slip-
ping.

The poor performance caused some inconvenience in reactor operation,
and the second loss of CCP~1 contributed to a reactor drain. At the
time of this failure, the containment enclosure of CCP-2 was isolated
49

and undergoing a leak test. An attempt was made to get CCP-2 back in
operation, but the system began to drain before the blower could be
started.

At the shutdown in July the belt on CCP-1 had operated for 1084 hr
and the one on CCP-2 had operated for 2013 hr. Both belts showed some
wear and minor cracking, probably caused by overheating. Both had re-
laxed, so the tension was significantly less than the original adjust-
ment; .

Even when the belts were not slipping, the output of the blowers
was low. The output at the speed at which the blowers were operating
was supposed to be 590 scfm, but conservative flow calculations indi-
cated only 400 scfm. Various leaks might account for the difference.
A rupture disk is being installed at the discharge of the pressure-
relief valves, which are known to leak, The check valves will be in-
spected and repaired if necessary. (One of the check valves failed
completely in 1965.) Leakage through the valve which vents excess
gas to the reactor cell to control blower discharge pressure might
also account for part of the losses.

In August new, larger sheaves were installed on the drive motors
to raise the nominal output of each blower to 740 scfm. Part of the
increase in output will be discharged into the drain-tank cell to pro-
vide better mixing of air between that cell and the reactor cell.

The modifications should result in extended belt life. The larger
drive sheaves will lower the stress on the belts, and stopping the leak-
age through the pressure relief valves should lower the ambient temper-
ature in the enclosures. Another change being made specifically to
lower belt temperatures is the addition of a simple deflector to direct
cool incoming gas over the belts.

After the space cooler began to leak water into the reactor cell,
condensate accumulated in the 10-in., suction line to the CCP-1 dome at
a rate of 1 to 2 gpd. (The water was vaporizing in the reactor cell
and condensing in the suction line, the coolest surface exposed to the
cell atuosphere., ) Simple drains were installed, but these could be used
only when the reactor was subcritical so that radiation in the coolant
drain cell permitted entry. Handling of the drained water was compli-
cated by the tritium (up to 915 pe /ml) produced from the 571i in the
treated-water corrosion inhibitor. During the shutdown in August, pip-
ing was installed to permit draining the domes during power operation
should leakage in the cell require it. Water condensed in the suction
lines now will drain to a tank in the sump room, from whence it can be
transferred to the liquid-waste tank.

Moisture in the component-cooling domes may have contributed to
an electrical failure in wiring to the CCP-1 motor which happened on
June 27. A short in a seal on the end of a copper-sheathed magnesia-
insulated cable destroyed the seal and caused a large breaker to open,
and the fuel drained before services could be restored. Breakdown of

he epoxy potting in the seal is another possible explanation for the
failure. The CCP-1l wiring was replaced at that time, and during the
August shutdown CCP-2 was rewired to eliminate that epoxy-filled seal.

Salt-Pump 0il Systems — J. L. Crowley and H, B. Piper

 

The performance of the salt-pump oil systems during the period was
acceptable although not trouble free. The heat transfer in the coolers
deteriorated because of cooling-water scale, which had to be removed,
and the tendency for oil to collect in the salt-pump motor housings
under certain conditions continued to be a nuisance. Leakage by the
seals in the salt pumps continued to be very low, although there was
some increase in leakage by the lower shaft seal in the fuel pump.

Coolers. The oil is cooled by cooling-tower water passing through
coils in the two oil reservoirs. During March the temperature of the
coolant-pump oil supply gradually increased from its normal 134°F to
140°F. After inspection showed there was scale in the coil on the
coolant-pump oil cooler, it was flushed with a 15 wi % solution of
acetic acid. Considerable material was removed, and the oil tempera-
ture was reduced 7°F. The fuel-pump oil cooler was given the same
treatment, and the oil temperature was reduced 3°F. During subsequent
operation the temperature of the fuel-pump oll gradually rose, and in
August the acetic acid treatment was again given both coolers.

Holdup in Motor Cavity. Holdup of oil in the salt-pump motor hous-
ings continued to occur under certain conditions of flow and pressure.
In July, during a pressure test of the coolant system, the pressure on
the coolant-pump oil tank was increased from 7 to 20 psig. This caused
58 liters of oil to accumulate in the motor cavity, and it took five
days for all of it to drain back to the tank.

 

Shaft Seal Leakage. Oil leaking past the lower shaft seal in a salt
pump drains through a catch basin in the pump to an external catch tank
provided with a level indicator. Changes in the coolant-pump oil catch
tank indicated a steady accumulation of less than 2 en? [day throughout
the period. Until April the accumulation from the fuel pump was also
less than 2 em? /aay. It increased. then to about 6 cm? /aay and again
in mid-June to about 20 em? /day. This indicates some deterioration of
the pump shaft seal, but the rate is still far below the 1000 cm®/day
considered tolerable,

Leakage past Static Seals. 011 can leak past a static seal around
the shield plug and into the salt in the pump bowl. This leakage cannot
be measured directly but, in principle, is detectable by the decrease
in oil inventory. This technique is limited by the accuracy of the
tank level measurements and variations in the amount of oil held up in
the salt-pump motor housings, which cannot be measured. The latter ef-
fect is canceled when data are averaged over a long period of time.

The expected accuracy of the level measurements is equivalent to 1.2
liters. Data for the four-month period from April through July are
shown in Table 1.5. (Inventories for the separate systems were not
obtalned in March because of transfers while the oil coolers were being
flushed.) The apparent losses are about one-fourth the probable error
in the level measurements.

 

Oil Replacement. No deterioration of the oll was observed during
operation, but after the reactor was shut down in July, both systems were
drained and refilled with fresh oil.

associated with the electrical system accounted for six unscheduled
interruptions in the power operation of the reactor during this report
period. These interruptions varied in length from a few minutes to
several days. In all cases the necessary repairs or modifications
were made, and no damage to reactor equipment was Incurred.

AC Power Supply. Five of the six electrical failures that caused
reactor power interruptions were associated with the ac supply system:
three were caused by electrical storms, one by a wiring failure at a
component-cooling pump, and one by a simple overload of the main process-
power breaker.

On two occasions while the reactor was operating at power, momentary
electrical outages during storms caused control-rod scrams by range-switch-
ing the nuclear power safety channels because of dips in the fuel-pump-
motor current. In both these cases the nuclear power was quickly restored
to the value that existed just prior to the outage. Since the low range
of the safety channels is used only while filling the reactor (when the
fuel pump 1s off), rapid response of the range switching is not required.
Therefore, time-delay relays were incorporated in these circuits to pre-
vent their activation on momentary power dips.

The third storm~induced failure occurred when lightning struck a
power substation and parted one wire of the main MSRE feeder. In this
case the electrical load was automatically transferred to an alternate
feeder, and all essential equipment was restarted in time to prevent
draining either the fuel or ccolant system. However, operation at high
nuclear power could not be resumed until service was restored on the
main feeder. The entire supply system has since been reviewed and im-
proved to make it less susceptible to damage by storms.

The short in the component-cooling pump cable seal is described in
Sect. 1.9, subsection entitled "Component Cooling System." When this
52

snort occurred, there was a massive flow of current and the breaker
supplying the entire bus tripped hefore the individual breaker for the
motor.

During the initial full-power operation of the reactor the main
process-power hreaker (breaker R) was loaded to near its set-point
value. When the load on the coolant-radiator main-blower mohors was
increased by increasing the piteh on the blower fan blades (see Sect.
1.9, subsection entitled "Main Blowers"), the increased load on breaker
R caused it to trip on overcurrent. This condition was relieved by
transferring about 200 kw of auxiliary load from the main process trans-
former to an existing auxiliary power transformer. The load transfer
decreased the current through breaker R from about 1700 amp /ohase to
about 1550.

After the shutdown in July all switchgear breakers were removed,
tested, and calibrated.

DC-AC Inverter. To improve the reliability and increase the ca-
pacity of the reliable ac power supply, motor generator 4, a 25-kva
single~phase rotary inverter, was replaced with a new 62-kva three-
phase static inverter. The total load on the reliable power supply,
including the on-line computer, which has some three-phase load, is
40 kva. The static inverter offers a number of advantages over the
old rotary inverter, including higher efficiency (increased 35%),
smaller size, no moving parts; quiet operation, and excellent voltage
and frequency regulation. Prior to the installation of this equipment,
both the capacity and the voltage regulation of “he reliable power supply
were inadequate for the operation of the on-line computer.

During the checkout and testing of the static inverter in April,
after the installation had been completed, trouble occasionally devel-
oped that blew the load fuses. Two times the manufacturer's field en-
gineer made exhaustive tests and could not find any trouble, but all
symptoms indicated that the trouble was in the low-voltage logic power
supply, which supplies 24-v de control power. On April 22 the inverter
failed again while the reactor was operating at low power, causing a
control-rod scram. The inverter load was automatically transferred to
the normal ac power supply. After this failure a new power-supply mod-
ule was installed, and no further trouble has occurred.

The inverter output voltage regulation has been 208 * 1/2 v, and
the output frequency better than 60 cps + 0.01%. On one occasion the
inverter was operated 2-1/4 hr from the 250-v battery system without
the dc generator operating. though the input to the inverter varied
20 v, the output varied only 0.5 v.

Diesel Generators. Three diesel-power generators, each with a ca-
pacity of 300 kw, supply emergency ac power to mobors and heaters in the
MSRE. During this report period there were three occasions on which
this emergency power was needed. The diesel generators were started and
operated without difficulty except in June, when the component-coolant -
pump breaker was closed after the fault in the junction box. This caused
an overload on DG-3, and it was manually shut dowa.
53

In February a crack was found in the block of DG-3 at one of the
bolt holes. All attempts at repairs were less than completely success-
ful, but the unit was operable. Diesel generator 3 is being replaced
with a surplus diesel generator from another installation. The replace-
ment unit is similar to the original except that it is started by com-
pressed air instead of by a storage battery.

Control Rods and Drives — M. Richardson and R. H. Guymon

The control rods continued to operate reliably although there were
failures in position instrumentation.

During this report period there were 16 rod scrams while the reactor
was critical. Six were caused by power failures, six resulted from in-
strument malfunctions, two resulted from operator mistakes, and two were
deliberate experiments. In addition, the rods were scrammed 18 times
in circult tests and 42 times to measure drop times. In no case did
any rod ever fail to scram, nor was any drop time in excess of the
specified maximum.

Drop times for rods 1 and 2 were consistently below 800 msec. The
drop time on rod 3 increased from 900 to 960 msec, still well below the
1.3~sec limit set by safety considerations.

Measurement of the fiducial zeros showed no appreciable change in
rod length nor any shift in position indication. The coarse position
synchro on rod drive 3 failed on July 2 because of an internal short,
and it was necessary thereafter to count turns of the fine synchro in
positioning this shim rod. The potentiometer on rod drive 1, supplying
a position signal to a Till-permit interlock, became inoperative because
of worn windings.

The defective potentiometer and synchro were replaced in August.

Samplers — R. B, Gallaher and R. H. Guymon

The sampler-enricher was used to obtain 35 fuel salt samples, 10 of
which were 50-g samples for oxide analysis. Most of these were taken
without incident. A brief account of difficulties follows; details are
covered in Chap. 2.

On April 29 a lateh with reduced diameter was installed to eliminate
binding which was encountered at the lower bend in the sample line. While
it was being tested, wires to the drive motor shorted out inside the sam-~
pler. The fuel was drained from the reactor, the sampler was removed
and repaired, and operation was resumed in ten days.

After the latch replacement the operation of the sampler went with-
out a hitch except for one time (July 6), when the capsule stuck for
some unexplained reason and no sample was obtained.

Once it was necessary to retrieve an empby capsule which had been
dropped accidentally to the operational valve. A magnet on a cable was
used to retrieve the magnetic latch key with capsule attached.
S4

The interior of the transfer box (area 3A) gradually became contaml-
nated, and on two occasions minor contamination of the cutside resulted
8

as the transport container was being removed through the top. More sirin-
. « ' o_o z 1 . P
ent procedures, including the establishment of a "contamination" zone
g Pp > 2
at the sampler, were adopted to prevent recurrence.

On July 24 accidental overfilling of the pump with flush salt forced
salt into the sampler tube. The tube was found to be obstructed about
2 ft above the pump bowl, preventing sampling. Ixternal heaters applied
remotely were used to melt out the salt.

The coolant sampler was used without difficulty to obtain 18 cooclant-
salt samples.

Containment - H. B. Piper -
Several aspects of contaloment are of interest in the overall op-

eration of the MSRE., Tn addition to the primary consideration, that

of maintaining a low-leakage envelope to prevent the release of exces-

sive activity in the unlikely event of a reactor accident, it is also ;

necessary to prevent activity releases and contamination during main-

tenance periods, when the normal secondary containment and even the

fuel loop itself may be open. The latter consideration is particu-

larly important with a fluid-fuel reactor, where fission product ac~

tivity is distributed throughout the fuel loop. The high chemical

toxicity of MSRE salts (due to their high beryllium and Tluoride con-

tent) also requires careful measures to prevent the release of large

quantities of even nonradioactive salts.

During reactor operation the secondary containment, or primary
accident containment, system consists of the reactor and drain-tank
cells, which are sealed and kept at ~2 psig. The reactor bullding
serves as a third barrier, since it is kept at slightly subatmospheric
pressure and the exhaust air goes through roughing and absolute fil- -
ters before belng released from the containment stack. When the main
containment barrier and the reactor must be opened for in-cell main- -
tenance, primary activity containment is provided by diverting the
building ventilation air into the cell opening and out to the stack by
way of the absolute filters. The reactor building then becomes the
second contalnment barvier.

Secondary Containment System. The initial testing of the secondary
containment system has been covered in detail.*?® The leakage rate from
the secondary containment has been monitored throughout the reporting

eriod. The leakage rate of the containment is determined by measuring
either the change in inventory (cell atmosphere) or the change in pres-
sure as a function of time and then correcting this value for the known
and measured flows both into and oul of the system.

 

A higher than acceptable leakage rate was measured when the con-
talnment system was returned to service in March after a period of in-
cell maintenance. A check valve in the air-steam line leading to the
reactor-cell sump jet was found to be leaking. There is a simllar check
55

valve in the drain-tank-cell sump jet line, and it was suspected of leak-
ing also, so both lines were parted and capped to assure leak-tightness.
After this the containment was found to be acceptable, with a measured
in-leakage rate of 19 £t3 [day at —2 psig. The highest acceptable leak-
age rate at this pressure would be ~75 ft3/day. Starting in late April
and continuing through May, it appeared that a large leak had developed
in the containment envelope, and a great deal of effort was made to find
and stop this leak. It was finally necessary, however, to pressurize

the cell to 20 psig and do extensive leak hunting.

At ~2 psig it looked as if in-leakage had increased by about 100
£3 /day, and after pressurizing to 20 psig the data still indicated a
leak into the cell. The leak was found to be in one or more of the
eight pressurized thermocouple headers. Bach header is constructed as
a box, with cone wall of the box Facing the containment cells and the
other facing atmosphere. Thermocouple leads coming from the econtain-
ment penetrate first the inner wall and then the outer wall of the box,
with the space between being pressurized with nitrogen to a pressure
greater than that of the containment. Three of these headers were
found to be definitely leaking. Assurance was obtained that the headers
were not leaking to atmosphere by soap-bubble checking all penetrations
in 211 headers while they were pressurized. No leaks were found. A
calibrated rotameter was placed in the nitrogen line which is used to
pressurize the headers so that the leakage from the headers to the con-
tainment can be continuously monitored and corrected for in the leakage-
rate calculation. After this work was completed, the leakage into the
containment was again measured at 2 psig and found to be ~25 ft? /day,
an acceptable value.

The leakage rate has been monitored daily since that time, and,
until the reactor containment was opened for maintenance, the comtain-
ment remained acceptable. Although some leaks did occur during the re-
port period, none was large, and all were found and remedied.

Containment for In-Cell Maintenance. Under normal conditions,
whether the reactor is operating or not, the reactor building (high bay)
is kept at suvbatmospheric pressure, ~—0.2 in. Hp0. Air from the reactor
building is discharged from the 100-ft containment stack after particu~
lates have been removed by an "absolute" filter. When in-cell main-
tenance is carried on (the reactor cell is open), a large cell exhaust
line to the filters is opened to assure that air flows down into the
containment cell with a velocity at least 100 fps through the openings,
thus preventing any uncontrolled release of airborne activity.

 

During the report period no detectable particulate activity was re~
leased. There was a total of 97.3 mc of gaseous activity (iodine) re
leased, with 74 me being released during the two weeks that the graphite
samples and flexibile jumper in the off-gas line were being removed. The
total amount released in six months is 0,016 of the total permissible re-
lease from the five stacks in the ORNL area.

Filters and Stack Fans. In October 1965 the filter pit was over-
hauled, and new roughing and absolute filters were installed. Effi-
ciencies measured by the standard ORNL dioctyl phthalate (DOP) test
56

were 99.994 to 99.999% for the three banks (99.95% is the minimum ac-
ceptable). The filters were again DOP-tested in March 1966, and mea-
sured efficiencies were 99.995 to 99.999%. Evidently neither the ab-
solute filters nor the new gilicone caulking had deteriorated. From
the time of installation through August, the pressure drop across the
absolute filters remained unchanged, while drop across the roughing
filters gradually increased to 5.5 in. Hp0, causing a decrease in stack
flow of 15%. The flow remained above the value assumed in safety anal-
yses for stack dispersion, but the roughing filters will be replaced
after in-cell maintenance is completed.

The hearings were replaced in the west stack Tan in March. Indi-
cations were that insufficient lubrication had contributed to the failure,
so the lubrication system was changed from grease to light oll. The same
lubrication revision is planned Tor the east fan. The fans are driven
through V-belts by an external motor, which, as originally installed,
had adjustable sheaves. These sheaves apparently cause greater than
normal belt wear, and even though no belt failure has occurred, re-
placement with a properly sized solld sheave seemed advisable. This
was done on the west stack fan in July and is also planned for the
east unit.

Beryllium. Air is continuously sampled at 15 locations through-
out the MSRE area for beryllium contamination. This is done by draw-
ing alr through paper filters upon which the beryllium would be collected
and then determining the amount of contaminant that is deposited. ‘hese
samples are collected and analywed every working day. The lower limit
of detection is 0.05 ug per sample, and each daily (24 nr) sample rep-
resents the amount of beryllium in 14 m? of air. This represents a
lower limit of detectable concentration of 0.004 ng/m3. The maximum
permissible concentration of beryllium for continuous occupancy of an
area for an 8~hr work day is 2 ng /m>. There has heen no detectable re-
lease of beryllium during this report period.

Air drawn from the coolant-radiator stack is monitored continuously
while the reactor is in operation, A beryllium detector which samples
and analyzes on line is used for this purpose, The limits of detect-~
ability are the same as those described above. Again, there has been
no detectable release during this report period.

Shielding and Radiation — H. B. Piper

 

Complete radiation surveys were made of the reactor area as the
power was raised from 1 Mw to full power, and with the exception of
the areas discussed in the following paragraphs, the shielding was
found to be adequate.

When the reactor power was first raised to 1 Mw in April, the ra-
diation level in the North Electric Service Area (NESA) was found to
be high: 20 mr/hr on the balcony and 8000 mr/hr at the west wall. In-
vestigation showed that there was radioactive gas in the lines through
which gas is added to the drain tanks. Two check valves in each line
57

prevented the gas from getting beyond the secondary containment enclo-
sure, but the enclosure, of 1/2-in. steel, provided little gamms shield-
ing. The pressure in the fuel system at that time was controlled by

the newly installed pressure control valve with rather coarse trim, and
the pressure fluctuated around the control point (normally 5 psig) by
+~2%. These pressure fluctuations caused fission product gases to diffuse
more rapidly into the drain tanks and back through the 1/4-in. lines
through the shield into the NESA, The radiation level was lessened by
installing a temporary means of supplying an intermittent purge to the
gas-addition lines to sweep the fission product gases back into the

drain tanks. At ~7.5 Mv on May 24, the radiation levels were 5 mr/or

on the balcony and 2000 mr/hr at the west wall. During the June shutdown,
a. permanent purge system wag installed to supply a continuous helium purge
of 70 cc/min to each of the three gas-addition lines. This was proved suc-
cessful by subsequent full-power operation in which the general background
in the NESA wag <1 mr /hr.

There are now three areas in which the dose rates at full power
are too high for continuous occupancy. Limiting access to these areas
is not considered a hindrance to the orderly operation of the reactor
and so no further remedial action is planned.

Reactor Cell Top. Two very narrow beams, presumably coming from
cracks between shield blocks, reading 10 wr /hr gamma end 60 millirems/
hr fast neutrons, were found on top of the reactor cell blocks; these
areas were properly marked.

Coolant Drain Tank Cell Access Ramp. Even though shielding was
added inside the coolant drain cell door, the dose rates outside the
door (700 mr/hr gamma, 125 millirems/hr fast neutrons, >75 millirems/
hr thermal neutrons) and halfway up the access ramp (35 mr /hr Ama. ,
2 millirems/hr fast neutrons, 25 millirems/hr thermal neutrons) are
high during power operation. This area is clearly marked with radia-
tion zone signs abt the entrance and halfway down the ramp.

Vent House. Stacked concrete vlock shielding has been added peri-
odically to keep dose rates low in this area. Even so, the background
radiation level is ~7.0 mr/hr at full power, and the area is a condi-
tlonal~access radiation zone.

1.10 Instrumentation and Controls
Jd. R., Tallackson Re. L., Moore

The MIRE instrumentation and controls system continued to perform
well. There was the normally expected reduction in both malfunctions
and misoperation of instruments as instrument and operating personnel
gained experience and developed routines. While there were many design
changes, most of these were improvements and additions to the system
rather than corrective measures to the instruments and controls. A dis-
appolntingly large number of faulty commercial relays and electrcnic
switches were disclosed. These faults were in the areas of both relay
design and fabrication, and corrective steps have been taken.

Operating Fxperience — Process and Nuclear Instruments — C. BE. Mathews,
B. N. Fray, R. W. Tucker, and G. H. Burger

 

Control-System Relays. All 115 of the 48-v dec~operated relays in
both the safety- and control-grade circuits will be replaced because
of heat damage to thelr Bakelite frames. This problem was discussed
with the manufacturer, who stated that overheating is a common problem
with all relays of this particular model if they are continuously ener-
gized for long periods (MERE relays have operated for two years). It
is a borderline condition, which he says has been corrected by changing
the design to reduce by 20% the total power dissipated in the operating
coil and the series-connected dropping resistor. An order was placed
for 139 relays of the latest design.

 

Four new spare solenoid coil assemblies were purchased for the spe-
cial weld-sealed electric solenoid valves. Approximately 40 valves have
been in service on the fuel- and coolant-salt circulating pump level
measuring systems and the fuel sampler-enricher for two years. The first
and only coil failure occurred recently.

Pressure Transducers. A differential pressure cell used Lo obtain
pressure drop in the helium flow through the charcoal bed shifted its
range sebbing. The cell has been removed, but the cause of this range
shift has not yet been determined.

 

Thermocouples. Thermocouple performance has continued to be excel-
lent. Only one thermocouple fallure occurred during this period. This
brings the total number of failures since the start of MSRE operation to
5 out of over 1000 couples in use.

Electronic Switches. The Electra Systems switchest® used for alarm
and control of temperatures in the freeze-valve system performed without
malfunction during this pericd. This improvement in performance is at-
tributed to modifications reported previously ;t? Lo the establishment
and enforcement of more rigorous test and periodic checking procedures;
to the stabilization, by aging, of critical resistors in the switch mod~
ules; and to a better understanding, by operating personnel, of their
use in the system. A check showed that out of 109 switch set points,
83% had shifted less than 20°F over the six-month period. No switches
with double set points were found, and it is likely that this malfunction
will not reappear.

Sporadic malfunctions in control loops containing a particular model
current-actuated commercial electronic switch have been a source of an-
noyance, This faulty behavior was, apparently, associated most frequently
with ambient temperature changes brought on by air-conditioning failures
and with excessive vibration. Thorough inspection, made possible by a
system shutdown, revealed that out of 61 switches in service, 38 had one
or more faulty internal connections. These faulty connections, origi-
nated during manufacture, were imperfectly soldered Joints or joints
which had never been scldered.

Nuclear Instrumentation. Water leakage via the cable into the
counter-preamplifier assembly caused several failures in the wide-range

 
59

counting channels. The cause has been diagnosed as excessive strain and
flexing of the cable, and a redesigned cable assembly will be installed.

Personnel Monitoring System. The reactor building radiation and
contamination warning system was again revised to correct some defi-
ciencies and improve 1ts effectiveness. Four additional beacon lights
were installed. These were located in the coolant cell, blower house,
diesel house, and motor-generator room. The power circuits for the
lights were revised to improve reliability. The test procedures for the
system were revised to include monthly tests that actuate the entire
system, including the air horns, and to actuate and test the systen
trouble alarm features.

Data System — G. H. Burger and C. D. Martin

Several new analog input signals were added to the data system,
bringing the total close to the maximum capacity of 350. These were
added to obtain more information about the operation of the off-gas
system, to measure the reactor cell leak rate, and to monitor the
bearing temperatures of the main blowers and the water temperature in
the nuclear instrument penetration.

New programs were added to supply more reactor operating informa-
tion and to retrieve operating information previously stored on the
magnetic tapes. The two operating information programs calculate an
average of the fuel- and coolant-salt outlet temperatures and the re-
actor cell leak rate. The average outlet temperature calculations
(oAFOT, OACOT) are used extensively by the operators as a guide for
the operation and control of the reactor. The data-retrieval programs
were written to retrieve and process the stored information on line or
at the ORNL computer center. Both programs were used many times to
list and plot old data and were very useful in helping to determine
the time, cause, and effect of several reactor shutdowns. These data
also provided information which was used to redesign the off-gas sys-
tem and resulted in changing some of the reactor operating procedures.
The retrieval program for the computer center was written so that all
stored. information including calculation results could be processed
and listed or plotted. The use of this program is becoming a routine
operation, and data-retrieval requests are handled by a job order card.
The on-line retrieval programs are more specialized and handle only
certain inputs or calculation results. These programs have to be pub
into the system as they are needed and require some operator time when
they are executed. The analysis group 1s now being trained to handle
retrieval with these programs. A new general-purpose on-line program
similar to the computer center program is planned.

Revision of operating programs continued as new requirements were
determined during reactor operation. The heat-balance program was re-
vised and is now used to determine the true level of reactor power.
The reactivity-balance program was revised but is still not entirely
correct due to uncertainties in some of the parameters used in the
calculations,
60

In addition to the routine and periodic collection of operating
data, the data system was used to instrument and control further re-
ctor dynamics ltests similar to those last reported, to I was also
used to control the temperature of a material surveillance test stand
by a program which simulated three three-mode analog controllers. The
control program computes the surveillance specimen temperature control
set point from the reactor power, fuel outlet temperature, and an off-
set temperature To match the temperature profile of the waterial speci-
mens in the reactor core. An error signal is generated by using this

et point and the temperature of the test-gtand specimens. An output
signal is then generated by the computer to control the test-gtand
specimen temperatures by changing the voltage to the heaters by means
of compressed-air-actuated autotransformers.

jo

During the period covered by this report, the data system has be-
come a virtually indispensable tool for the operators and analysts.
The acceptance and confidence in this equipment. which is now shared by
the operators and analysts are the result of the system's ability to
supply reliable and accurate information to assist the operators in

controlling the reactor and to assist the analysts in evaluating the
operation. During this period the system continued to show a steady
improvement in overall reliability. Figure 1.16 shows the availability
of the system on a weekly basis. Some of the downtimes in March and
April were caused by ac power difficulties as a result of installing
and getting the static inverter power supply operating. Since April,
after the inverter shakedown was completed, the system has had only
one unscheduled downtime. For the 11 months the system has been in
operation, the availability is in excess of 97%, and for the past 6
months is about 98%. The system downtimes to data total 19 for 220
hr 40 min.

The data system has met all the objectives for which it was orig-
inally intended, and the operation is approaching routine status. Most
of the programming is complete with the exception of data-retrieval pro-
grams and the reactivity-balance program. It is expected that future
programing and other system changes will be minimum and will only re-
sult from requirements generated by continued operation of the reactor.

Control -System Design — A. H. Anderson, D. G. Davis, and P. G. Herndon

 

Control Instrumentation Additions and Modifications. Further addi-
tions to and modifications of the instrumentation and controls systems
were made to provide additional protection, improve performance, or pro-
vide more information for the operators. One hundred twenty-five re-~
quests for changes in the instrumentation and controls system (or in
systems affecting instrumentation and controls) were received and re-
viewed during the past report pericd. Of these, 52 requests resulted
in changes in instrumentation and/or controls, 19 were canceled, 8 did
not require changes in instrumentation or controls, and 25 are active
requests for which design revisions are elther in progress or pending.
Prior to the initiation of design changes, the requests were reviewed
by persons responsible for operating the reactor and for the original
design. Changes 1n the reactor system were not made until the neces-
sary approvals had been obtained. Some examples of these changes fol-
low.

fuel and Coolant Pumps. The six relays that monitor the fuel-pump
motor current were replaced to prevent unnecessary shutdowns. Relay
chatter was causing spurious operations of the reactor flux scram sebt-
point circuits. Modifications to the existing relays and their current
settings did not correct this condition; therefore, new relays were in-
stalled, Some spurious operations occurred during thunderstorms. It
ig believed that lightning~induced transients on the power distribution
system caused the very fast-acting current relays to drop out and scram
the reactor. To prevent this, the existing relays in the reactor flux
scram set-point circuits were replaced with time-delay relays.

 

After the fallure of a lube oll flow switch interlock had shut down
the coolant-salt circulating pump during a load scram, it was proposed
that all protection interlocks be removed from both the coolant- and
fuel-salt circulating pump control circuits. This would prevent un-
necessary punp stoppages and provide additional protection against freez-
ing of salt in the radiator. After careful consideration it was decided
62

that these interlocks should remsin in the circuits, because the protec~
tion they provide for the pumps outweighs their disadvantages. However,
new operating criteria stipulate that prevention of possible freezing
of salt in the radiator is more important than protecting the pump from
possible damage resulting Trom loss of lube oil or cooling-water flow.
To satisfy these nev requirements, we presently plan to install a manual
switel which (after proper administrative approval) may be operated to
override the pump protective interlocks. Since pump shutdown may result
from other causes, such as action of overcurrent trip in the circuit
breakers, loss of TVA power, etc., additional changes in the power dis-
tribution and switchgear systems will be required if maximum obtainable
pumping reliability is required. Manual switch circuits that will over-
ride all protective interlocks in this pump control circuit are now belong
esigned.

A weld-gsealed electric pressure transmitter was installed on the
fuel-pump helium supply line 516 at a point hydraulically near the fuel
pump. This measurement will be compared to the pump-~-bowl cover-gas
pressure to determine the pressure drop across the lube-0il static seal
between the fuel-pump shield and the 1lmpeller shaft housing. This in-
formation should help to determine if there are periods of conditions
that should favor leakage of an abnormal amount of oil into the pump
bowl.

Master Control Circuits. A new jumper and associated circuitry
were installed to provide a bypass around the freeze valve 111 Frozen
permissive contact in the drain-tank helium supply valve control cir-
cuit. The Jumper will make it more convenient to operate through the
salt-transfer freeze valves. It was previously necessary to freeze
and thaw freeze valve 111 three times when hlowing out the transfer
lines after a fuel-salt transfer.

To prevent radioactive gas backup into the drain-tank helium supply
lines, a continuous helium purging system, compatible with safety re-
quirements, was designed and installed. ach supply line is purged .
through a capillary flow restrictor which is sized to limit the purge
flow rate to 0.07 liter /min. The capillaries are supplied from line -
519 at a point downstream of the containment block valves.

It was proposed that spurious operations of interlocks in the RUN
mode, OPERATE mode, main blower No. 1, and main blower No. 3 control
circuits that were causing unnecessary shutdowns be prevented by re-
placing the existing relays in these circuits with time-delay relays.
This proposal was canceled after investigations indicated that the real
cause of the trouble was erratic operation of the new 60-kva system
power supply. The performance of the power supply has been improved
considerably, and these circuits are now operating normally.

Load Control. To satisfy established operating criteria, addi-
tional control-grade circuits were designed to provide automatic load
setback action when the reactor is in the manual load control mode.
The installation of these circuits is being delayed pending a complete
review of the automatic load control system.
63

Additional safety-grade circuits were installed to provide auto-
matic load scram whenever the reactor control rods are scrammed. The
purpose of this revision is to help prevent salt from freezing in the
radiator.

The design of a system to measure the vibration of the radiator
cooling-air blowers and motors is now in progress. Surplus vibration
instruments suitable for this application are on hand.

Thermocouples. The thermocouple system did not change appreciably,
although a few thermocouples were added. Twelve with in-cell type re-
mote disconnects were installed on the fuel system off-gas filter and
particle trap. These are read on a multipoint recorder located in the
vent house. Thermocouples were also added to the new filters in off-
gas line 524, to the gas holdup volume tank in line 522, and to the
bearings on the main blowers.

Weigh System. The problem of leaking pneumatic selector valves in
the drain-tank weigh system readout was studied. Manometer readout is
accomplished by selecting particular weigh cell channels with the se-
lector valves. The valves are composed of a stacked array of individual
valves operated by cams on the operating handle shaft. Leaks from these
switches cause a slight error in the manometer reading. Efforts to stop
the leaks permanently have not been successful. Leak tests on a quick
disconnect device indicate that it would be a satisfactory replacement
for each valve in the switch assembly. The valves were nob replaced
because the problem is not severe enough at this time to justify the
expense,

Auxiliary Systems. A pressure-reducing valve, a flowmeter, and a
containment block valve were installed in the reactor cell thermocouple
nitrogen-pressurizing supply header. The normal operating pressure was
reduced from 50 to 5 psig because of the excessive leak rate into the
reactor cell.

The component-coolant-pump control circuits were cross-interlocked
to prevent both pumps from being energized at the same time. This was
accomplished previously with contacts mounted directly on the circuit
breaker starter, but this arrangement would not allow one pump to op-
erate normally when the breaker for the other pump is racked out for
maintenance.

A new design of instruments and controls is under way for a 350-
gal-capacity degassing and surge tank which was added to the treated-
water system to remove gases generated in the reactor thermal shield.
A tank level measurement and possibly some flow control are required.
An air purge system, which includes a pressure regulator, flow indi-
cator, and two solenold~operated containment block valves, 1s also re-
quired.

Other minor revisions and additions were as follows:

1. The beryllium monitor was relocated from the vént house to the high-
bay area.

2. The range of helium flow measuring loop FE-524-B was increased.

The range of the differential pressure transmitter was increased from

was replaced with a strip-chart recorder.

A flowmeter was installed in treated-water line 877.

A nev instrument power distribution panel was installed to provide
additional circuits required by other modifications and for future
expansion.

Manual switches were added in the main radiator blower damper con~
trol circult so that the dampers can be closed when the blowers are
not running.

Radiator duct blower air flow switches were added to the annunciator
clrcuits.

A time delay was provided in the high-bay area containment pressure
annunciator,

2. COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT

Dunlap Scott

The development group continued to assist in the operation and test-
ing of the reactor. Much of their effort consisted of helping in diag-
nosing problems and in devising and installing equipment used to solve
she problems. The operational performance of the equipment is covered in
Chap. 1, but the description of problems and their solutions is given
below.

2.1 Freeze Valves

M. Richardson

Operation of the freeze valve since the addition of the modulating
air controllers has been without incident. Operation of FV-103 was im-
proved by deleting the hysteresis feature of the FV-103-1A module, which
caused thermal cycling of the valve before the valve temperature reached
equilibrium. The module FV-103-1A now operates as an off-on switch which
alarms at 1000°F.

2.2 Control Rods

M. Richardson

The three control rods have operated without difficulty. Fiducial
zero positions are listed below. Changes are caused by changes in rod
length.

2.3 Control-Rod Drive Units

 

M. Richardson J. R. Tallackson

The control-rod drive units were operated from installation in
February until shutdown in August with the following difficulties.

1. The coarse-position synchro torque transmitter of the No. 3
drive failed. The transmitter was deenergized, and the drive unit con-
tinued operation using the fine-position synchro transmitter and the po-
tentiometer to indicate position.

2. The "Fill Permit" position potentiometer of the No. 1 drive
began to transmit erratic readings. The potentiometer was Jjumpered out
of the circuit, and the drive continued to operate satisfactorily.

3. The high-temperature (200°F) switches which are mounted 6 in.
from the bottom of the drive-unit housings went into alarm on No. 1 drive
and remained in alarm under normal operating conditions. The switches
cleared when the reactor was drained and the cell temperature was lowered.

The potentiometer and synchro were replaced during the current shut-
down. Examination showed that the potentiometer had developed a region
of open wiper contact. The synchro, mildly radioactive, has not yet been
disassembled to determine the exact cause of failure. Resistance measure-
ments indicate a coll-to-coil short circuit in the stator windings, and
the partially melted plastic end cap is positive evidence of excessive
temperature.

The thermostatic temperature switches! in the lower end of the drive
housing are intended to indicate the approach of high-temperature con-
ditions which would damage the motor and gear box assembly at the upper
end of the housing. The switches are lnaccessible, and it was not possible
to determine absolutely if the high-temperature indication from the No. 1
drive was correct or if one or both of the switches had misoperated. ©Since
neither of the other drive units showed a similar indication, there was
room for doubt. Measurements were taken of the winding resistances of the
drive motor, the fan motor, and the tachometer generator and compared to
those of similar units at room temperature and in the other two rod drive
units. These indicated that temperatures of the sensitive parts of the
questionable unit were normal. Operation was continued with the switches
bypassed but with periodic checks of these winding resistances.

Inspection of the No. 1 and No. 3 rod drive units in August revealed
that the switches on the No. 1 unit were operating correctly, and they
showed evidence (discoloration) that they had been exposed to high tem-
perature. Motors, gear boxes, and other parts of the drive units showed
no evidence of overheating or mechanical difficulty. The gear cases were
opened and were in excellent condition. The APL grease was soft and
adhering to the worm and worm gear. The lubricant had darkened slightly,
but there was no evidence of tarring or lumping of the grease. The wire
insulation was in good condition.
67

It is reasonable to conclude that the air stream introduced at the
upper end of the No. 1 rod drive housing, while sufficient to keep the
gear-box components cooled, was not large encugh to prevent the develop-
ment of the nigh temperature at the lower end of the housing caused by a
part of the heated gas stream rising from the thimble. The temperature
switches on rod drives 2 and 3 went into alarm during periods when the
reactor cell was operated above 150°F. This indicates that the air flow
to all three rod drives is marginal. The good condition of the gears,
motors, and lubricant makes immediate action unnecessary, but a study
will be made of methods of lncreasing the alr flow to the drive housings.

2.4 Radiator Doors

M. Richardson

Modifications? to the radiator-door-operating mechanism permitted
satisfactory operational performance of the doors through the last run.
However, excessive leakage of air into the radiator enclosure due to
poor seals became evident after the doors had been thermally cycled
several times during operation.

Examination of the doors after shutdown revealed that the metal seal
surfaces had been severely damaged. The metal seals, in turn, damaged
the mating soft seal mounted in the Tace of the radiator. The metal
strips had buckled between weld points, broken at some points, and been
torn away completely at the top of the outlet door. Some of this damage
is shown in Figs. 2.1 and 2.2.

The door structure and insulation boxes were in good condition ex-
cept for vowing of the 4-in. H-~beam structural members. The maximum bow,
which was at the top of the outlet door, was 5/16 in.

Laboratory tests were conducted on several arrangements of the metal
surfaces. A method of thermal cycling the test sections was devised
which would duplicate the distortion found in the seal strips on the doors
after the previous operation. Figure 2.3 shows three of the strip ar-
rangements that were tested; the strip support member (or T-bar) was the
same in each case. In the case of sections 1 and 2 of Fig. 2.3, these
strips were welded to the T-bar at intervals of 2 to 4 in. Because of
the heat loss through the door, these strips were operated about 500°F
above the temperature of the support bar, resulting in severe distortion
of strips between the welds. In some places the welds had broken, per-
mitting the seal strips to protrude away from the plane of the seal sur-
face. A similar test was run on a third arrangement of this seal which
consisted of 2-in. segments of the seal held in place at one end by a
plug weld and at the other end by an overlapping tab that interlocked
with the adjacent segment. This arrangement is shown as section 3 in
Fig. 2.3. It was found that thermal cycling did not affect the alignment
of these segments. The segments were spaced 0.031 in. along the T-bar.

It was evident throughout all the test program that the seal-strip
support member bowed about 3/16 in. along the 32-in. length of test
section. It seemed reasonable to assume that bowing of this member would
also occur along the solid 10-ft 4=1/2-1in. length of the T-bar in the
radiator door and contribute to the stressing of the door structure. The
door repair work included cutting the T-bar into segments; when this was
done, the bowing of the door structure was reduced from 5/16 in. to 1/8 in.

Corrective measures to the seals and T-bar are presently in progress.
These include:

1. Modification of the T-bar to minimize bowing by installation of ex-
pansion joints in the bar.

2. Installation of a new hard seal which is composed of 3-1/4-in.-long
overlapping links. The short links will be plug welded to the T-bar
by a single weld per link with a 1/32-in. expansion joint between
overlapping segments.

3. The existing soft-seal retainer, which is mounted on the face of the
radiator, is being modified to permit thermal expansion of the metal
retainer.

4. It is not anticipated that bowing of the T-bar will be completely
eliminated. Thermal expansion of the radiator face may also con-
tribute to the air leakage. An additional seal in the form of a
resilient, soft seal is being proposed as backup to the existing
seals. This seal would form a closure at those points along the
hard seal which are not in contact with the existing soft seal.

2.5 Sampler-Enricher

R. B. Gallaher

During runs 6 and 7, 35 samples were isolated with the sampler-en-
richer, 10 of which were 50-g oxide samples. To date 119 10-g and 20
50-g samples have been taken, and 87 enrichments made to the fuel system.

In the past six months, four major maintenance jobs were done on the
equipment. They were (1) replacement of the manipulator boots, (2) re-
placement of the drive unit latch, (3) repair of open electrical circuits,
and (4) recovery of a capsule which had fallen onto the gate of the op-
erational valve. A brief discussion of each job follows.

Replacement of Manipulator Boots

 

A 12-psi pressure difference which was accidentally placed across
the manipulator boots caused a small puncture in the inner boot. To re-
place the boots the manipulator assembly was removed from the sampler.
The radiation level 3 in. from the hand was 10 r/hr as removed, but this
71

was reduced to 1 r/hr by scrubbing with soap and water. About 2 hr was
required for the Job of replacing both boots. The boots had been used
during the 48 sampling cycles since the operation at power was started.

Replacement of the Capsule Latch

 

Just after the boots were replaced, the drive-unit motor stalled as
the latch which holds the sample capsule to the cable was being retrieved
through the lower bend in the transfer tube. After several tries the
latch was completely withdrawn. Testing showed the latch was Jamming in
the transfer tube near the top of the lower bend. The design was changed
to provide additional 1/8 in. clearance between the tube wall and the
latch. The old latch and part of the cable were pulled through the access
port and the removal valve with the reactor operating at less than 100 kw.
The old latch was pulled 1nto the sample transport cask to reduce the
radiation level in the work area. It was disconnected from the drive unit
cable and the new latch was installed.

Repair of an Open Electrical Circuit

 

While operating the drive unit to be certain that the new latch would
pass around the lower bend without jamming, the cable position indicator
stopped at 15 ft 2 in. from full withdrawn position, and the upper limit
switch activated. Electrical continuity checks showed open circuits to
both insert and withdraw windings of the drive-unit motor and to the upper
limit switch. All three of these leads penetrated the containment wall
through a common 8-pin receptacle.

When the drive motor stopped, the cable extended almost to the pump
bowl, preventing closing of the operational and maintenance valves.
Therefore, the reactor had to be drained before maintenance work could be
started. After the reactor was drained, the 15 ft 2 in. of cable was
pulled out of the transfer tube without exposing the fuel system to alr by
using the one-hand manipulator to pull and the transport container and
access port operators to hold the cable. Then the operational and main-
tenance valves were closed to provide the containment barrier to allow
the motor assembly to be removed for repair.

The assembly, which contains the drive-unit motor, was removed from
the sampler-enricher and placed in the equipment storage cell for decon-
tamination and repair. Shadow shielding and partial decontamination were
used to reduce the radiation level enough to permit direct maintenance.
Partial disassembly revealed that three connector pins had burned off one
8-pin receptacle. The damaged receptacle was removed and a new one was
welded in its place. All six receptacles in this location were filled
with epoxy resin to provide additlonal electrical insulation and mechanical
strength to the connector pins.

As the drive-unit cable was being pulled from the transfer tube it
was bent In several places and needed to be straightened. The cable was
72

serubbed with soap and water until the radiation level was less than 5
r/hr at 3 in. Then most of the kinks were straightened. The remaining
bends in the cable did not appear to adversely affect the operations of
the drive unit when it was operated prior to reinstallation.

The parts were reassembled. All electric circuits were checked for
continuity and for grounds, and all gas lines were leak checked. [The
assembly was then reinstalled in the sampler-enricher and the normal
sampling was resumed.

Recovery of a Capsule

 

As a capsule key was being inserted into the latch, the manipulator
slipped and the capsule was Jerked through the access port and Tell onto
the gate of the operational valve in the transfer line. A magnet was
lowered into the transfer line; the mild steel key? on the capsule was
picked up by the magnet, and the capsule assembly was removed as the
magnet was withdrawn. The radiation level of the magnet after this op-
eration was 10 r/hr at 2 ft.

These four maintenance jobs involved handling equipment that had
been in contact with fuel salt. All work was done in contamination con-
trol zones. Contamination was found outside these zones only twice, and
both times it was from contaminated shoes. Apparently this type con-
tamination is not readily airborne. Personnel exposures did not exceed
a dose of 40 millirads/day for any one individual.

Operational Valve leakage

 

While the assembly was removed for replacement of the electrical
receptacle, the upper face of the operational valve gate was cleaned as
much as possible with the valve closed. Several small, dark particles
were observed on the gate prior to cleaning. After cleaning, the leak
rate of helium through the top seal decreased for a while. After the
capsule had been dropped onto the gate, the leak rate suddenly increased
again, indicating that another particle had lodged in the sealing area.

Contamination of the Removal Valve Seals

 

The surface of the transport container used during the withdrawing
of the cable with the manipulator became very contaminated from contact
with the cable. When the transport container was removed, part of this
contamination was transferred to the removal area seal. During subsequent
sampling procedures particulate contamination was spread to the top of
the sampler-enricher. Since the removal area was cleaned using damp rags
and the top of the sampler-enricher was made & contamination control zone
during sampling operations, there have been no further problems with con-
tamination.
73

Miscellaneous Problems

 

During one sampling sequence as the top of the transport container
was being lowered over the bottom part, which contained a 50-g salt
sample, the steel wire connecting the capsule to the key caught on the
edge of the transport container top and was pulled down into the threads.
When the two pieces were threaded together, the wire caused the threads
to gall before the pieces sealed. The sample and the transport container
were ruined. Since then a long plastic sleeve has been placed in the
bottom of the transport container to hold the wire out of the way. The
sleeve also reduces the amount of contamination transferred from the
sample to the inside of the top piece of the transport container.

About 4 hr is presently required to decontaminate a transport con-
tainer sufficiently to be returned for use. Mild steel bottom pieces
have been fabricated which will be used one time and thrown away without
decontaminating.

Changes to the Control Circuit

Three changes were made to the control circuit.

1. The annunciator, which alarmed when capsule area pressure was
greater than manipulator area pressure, was removed. A permissive light
was installed to indicate when capsule area pressure was equal to or less
than manipulator area pressure. This condition 1s necessary before the
access port can be opened but is not necessary at other times.

2. A fuse was added to the drive-unit motor circuit to protect the
motor and the electric receptacles from excessive currents. The fuse is
located on one of the panelboards.

3. Voltage suppressors were placed across the two motor windings to
limit any high voltage peaks during starting and stopping of the motor.

2.6 Coolant Sampler

R. B. Gallaher

During runs 6 and 7, ten 10-g salt samples were isolated from the
coolant pump bowl. A total of 45 samples including two 50~g samples have
been taken using the coolant sampler.

One pin on an electrical receptacle shorted during a sempling cycle.
This pin was in the circuit to the indicator light which showed when the
capsule had been withdrawn 18 in. from the pump bowl. The receptacle was
removed and a new one welded in place.

A leak rate from the lower seal of the removal valve increased. The
valve was disassembled, cleaned, and reassembled. The valve then sealed
properly.
2.7 Fuel Processing System Sampler

 

R. B. Gallaher

Design of the fuel processing system sampler has been completed ex-
cept for the shielding. The sampler-enricher mockup equipment was modi-
fied to conform with the design. All parts were received, and the re-
visions to the mockup panelboards were completed. The equipment 1s being
installed at Building 7503 whenever craft are available. The tubing in-
stallation is 95% complete, and the electrical and instrument work is
about 50% complete. The final assembly and leak checking remain to be
done.

2.8 0ff-Gas Filter Assembly

 

A. N. Smith

The off-gas filter in line 522 was originally provided to protect
the very fine trim of the reactor pressure control valve, PCV 522, from
becoming fouled by particulate matter. Following the analysis of plugging
difficulties in February and March 1966, efforis were directed toward the
design of a filter which also would trap organic materials. Primary con-
siderations were (1) choice of filter medium and (2) heat dissipation.

Filter Medium

The organic material was presumed to exist in a range of forms ex-
tending from low-molecular-weight vapors to suspensions of droplets and
polymerized solids. Charcoal was selected as the best available medium
for the removal of the heavier organics. Preliminary tests reported in
Chap. 7 confirmed that the charcoal would have good efficiency for removal
of Cg and heavier molecules. It was assumed that lighter molecules would
pass through the main charcoal beds without adverse effects.

Heat Dissipation

The heat load at the filter comes primarily from beta decay of
krypton, xenon, and their daughter products. The contribution due to
krypton and xenon alone is estimated at O.1 kw/liter. The contribution
due to the daughter products would depend on the assumed physical model.
Tor purposes of the filter design, the most pessimistic viewpoint was
adopted, namely, that all daughters formed between the pump bowl and the
filter remain in suspension and are transported to the filter. Since the
efficiency of the charcoal trap would vary inversely with temperature,

a prefilter or particle trap was added for removal of solid daughters and
the entire assembly was water cooled.
75

Particle Trap

The design of the particle trap is illustrated in Fig. 2.4. Gas
from the reactor pump bowl enters at the bottom of the unit through a
central pipe, reverses direction, and passes in succession through two
concentric cylinders of porous metal (felt metal), the first somewhat
coarser than the second, and a bed of inorganic (Fiverfrax) fibers. A
layer of stainless steel wool 1s inserted at the bottom of the unit to
serve as an impingement surface for material which might be thrown out
of the stream by centrifugal action. A bellows section is provided in
the felt-metal zone for thermal expansion. The Fiberfrax (a poor con-
ductor) is compartmented between perforated metal plates to provide for
better transmission of heat to the walls of the filter housing. Three
thermocouples are attached to the outside of the filter housing ~ one
near the top, one adjacent to the lower end of the Fiberfrax section,
and one adjacent to the middle of the felt-metal section.

Charcoal Trap

The charcoal trap consists of 13 ft of 1-in. IPS stainless steel
pipe, arranged in three hairpin sections of approximately equal length.
The trap was loaded with 1092 g of Pittsburgh PCB charcoal to give an
average bed density of 0.5 g/cm’. Six thermocouples were installed at
5, 12, 51, 59, 105, and 113 in., respectively, from the bed inlet. The
77

entire charcoal trap is enclosed in a sealed tank through which water is
circulated at a rate of 10 gpm and an. inlet temperature of 65 to 70°F.
The diameter of the trap piping was selected on the basis of theoretical
temperature profile calculations.” One-inch IPS was selected as the size
which would permit the lowest trap operating temperature consistent with
an acceptable pressure drop.

Flow pressure~drop tests gave the following results at the normal
reactor off-gas flow of 4.2 liters/min:

 

psi
Felt material 0.04
Fiverfrax 0.004
Total particle trap 0.06
Charcoal trap 0.85
Total filter assembly 0.95

The performance of the off-gas system after the installation of this
filter is described in Chap. 1.

2.9 524 Charcoal Bed

A. N. Smith

Diffusion of activity into the fuel pump upper off-gas line (line
524) resulted in high stack activity on two occasions during the report
period and dictated the need for a small charcoal bed in line 524 (see
Chap. 1).

A small upflow of gas (about 100 cm?®/min) is maintained at the fuel
pump shaft to inhibit back-diffusion of oil vapors into the pump bowl.
Iine 524 serves to transport this flow to the off-gas system.

The bed consists of 9 ft of 3-in. sched 10 pipe arranged in hairpin
shape and loaded with 15.8 1b of Pittsburgh PCB charcoal. Bulk density
of the bed is 0.47 g/cm. Holdup time at 100 em? /min helium flow is
estimated as 2-1/2 days for krypton or 30 days for xenon. The bed was
placed in service on June 9, 1966.

2.10 Remote Maintenance
R. Blumberg
At the start of this reporting period, radiation levels encountered

by maintenance crews were mild due to the small accumulated power-hours
produced. This low radiation level permitted the use of temporary, and
78

at times casual, shielding, and in-cell manipulations were thus unhampered
by the restrictions of the shielding, so that the time required for com-
pletion of these early Jobs was shortened. However, by the middle of
July, when the reactor was shut down Lor maintenance after having produced
some 7800 Mwhr, the radiation level was an important factor, adding to the
difficulty, time, and expense of the work. As a consequence the portable
maintenance shield had to be set up for each job, and extensive health
physics precautions, especially in the area of contamination control
(housekeeping), had to be employed. As of this writing, the remote main-
tenance work of the shutdown is about 60% complete.

Based on the experience gained to date one may make the following
observations. (1) Contamination control is not a major difficulty. We
have handled several pieces of equipment that had much wipable and trans-
ferable contamination without spreading contamination throughout the
working area. The contamination does not become airborne readily. Never-
theless, the practice has been to use conservative handling measures;
these involve the use of plastic bag coverings, blotter paper, gas masks,
ete. (2) An encouraging sign is the ease of executing some of the routine
maintenance Jobs. There have been many instances where removal and re-
placement of in-cell components have gone very smoothly and with minimum
supervision. In general, these are items which have standard electrical
and piping disconnects and supports, such as the space cooler, and which
represent a considerable percentage of the equipment that must be main-
tained remotely. (3) Thus far, almost all of the maintenance techniques
or systems have been tried and have worked well. These are the portable
maintenance shield, graphite sample system, vent house shielding, the
remote maintenance control room, and repair techniques in the decontami-
nation cell. The remote maintenance tasks where we do not yet have ex-
perience are in general associated with the handling of the large compo-
nents. The shielding provided for maintenance has been guite adequate.

The following is a summary of the tasks performed during the last
period. The accumulated hours of power operation, together with an in-
dication of the radiation level in the immediate area Just below the work
shield, are given for each task. In general, the work shield was ef-
fective in reducing the background radiation level above it to less than
5 mr /hr except while a tool penetration was partially open, and then the
radiation level at the hands would be near 200 mr/hr. The maximum ac-
cumulated dosage to any one worker was less than 1/4 of the maximum per-
missible level over the period.

March 1 — 35 Mwhr

Removed the flexible jumper which connects the off-gas line
of the pump bowl to the permanent in-cell part of line 522, in-
spected the flange faces and inside of the piping with a bore-
scope and binoculars, obtained specimen of a residue from the
piping for chemical analysis, and restored the system. This
task was part of the effort to diagnose the restriction problem
in the off-gas system. The radiation level was 200 mr/hr at
floor level.
79

March 10 — 35 Mwhr

Removed and replaced the reactor cell east space cooler.
This operation was accomplished mostly by the craft forces.
Readings were 500 mr/hr at floor level.

March 12 — 35 Mwhr

 

Installed a thermocouple on a horizontal section of off-
gas line 522. A C-clamp was modified to provide the contacting
force to hold the couple onto the 4-in. pipe. The thermocouple
leads were connected to a spare thermocouple lead-out box.
Radiation was 500 mr/hr at floor level.

March 31 — 35 Mwhr

The revised PCV 522 valve and filter unit described above
were installed in the vent house area. Changes in the shielding
and containment arrangement were done to make possible the re-
mote replacement of any one of three component parts, that is,
the valve, the particle trap, or the carbon bed, rather than
having to remove the entire assembly. The new installation re-
quired larger maintenance shielding and stronger structural
support for the shielding.

April 3C~May 6 — 820 Mwhr

 

Repaired the sampler-enricher. A large subassembly of the
equipment was removed to the decontamination cell, where it was
cleaned and repaired using local shielding. This was the first
real use of the decontamination cell, which had heen prepared
for this type of work, and it was found to work quite well.
There were contact readings of above 100 r/hr, but the radiation
was soft enough that a little shielding reduced the field to ac-
ceptable levels.

May 20 — 1932 Mwhr

Installed temporary instrumentation piping at the PCV 522
area for particle trap, carbon bed, and valve pressure drop
measurements. Tubing connections were made up remotely; this
was a new maintenance procedure. Readings were 100 r/hr at
floor level and 10 r/hr through an open tool penetration.

July 27 — 7822 Mwhr

This was the start of the shutdown which has extended to
the end of this report period. The reactor was shut down on
July 17, and the graphite-INOR-8 surveillance samples were re-
moved from the reactor core on July 28, 11 days later. The
work required three days. The estimated radiation level while
the sample was being transported was 1500 r/hr at 1 ft. The
remote control room for the crane was used for the first time
and performed satisfactorily. The tools used for the operation
were contaminated to a level greater than 100 r/hr.
80

August 5-10 — 7822 Mwhr

 

Removed, repaired, and replaced the Nos. 1 and 3 control
rod drives. The details of the repair work are described in
Sect. 2.3. The remote handling operation of the removal and
replacement went smoothly. Radiation was 500 mr/hr at floor
level.

August 15 — 7822 Mwhr

 

Removed and replaced the reactor cell west space cooler.
The job went routinely and was accomplished mostly by the
craft forces. Radiation was 1 to 6 r/hr at floor level.

August 17 — 7822 Mwhr

 

A gas pressure reference line which became filled with
a salt plug was cleared by applying pressure while heating -
the line. This task was unanticipated and required some de-
sign, fabrication, and testing prior to installing a heater
on a long-handled tool and safely operating it remotely.
Readings were 60 r/hr at floor level and 10 r/hr through a
tool penetration.

P. Go. Smith A. G. Grindell

3.1 MSRE Pumps

Molten-Salt Pump Operation in the Prototype Pump Test Facility

 

The prototype pump was operated for 2631 hr, circulating the salt
LiF -BeF,-ZrF 4-ThF 4-UF, (68.4—24.6=5.0~1.1~0.9 mole %) at 1200°F. The
fuel-salt pump impeller of 11-1/2 in. OD (size installed in the MSRE
fuel pump) was used. Measurements were made of the concentration of
helium bubbles in the circulating salt, and various tests were con-
ducted on the pump-tank and the catch-basin purge gas lines,t

The radiation densitometer®* was used to determine the concentration
of helium bubbles circulating in 1200°F salt during operation at normal
pump-tank liquid level and with a fuel-pump impeller of 11-1/2 in. di-
ameter running at 1170 rpm. The helium concentration in the salt was
0.1% by volume. This value contrasts with 4.6% by volume measured pre-
viously? in the prototype facility using a 13-in.-diam fuel impeller,
and compares favorably to a barely detectable concentration in the MSRE
fuel circuit.

Tests were performed which included analyses to determine the hy-
drocarbon content of the pump-tank and catch-basin purge gas streams
and. the composition of hydrocarbons. They were done as part of the
effort to establish whether the fuel pump was the likely source of hy-
drocarbons in the off-gas system of the MSRE. During these tests the
flow of gas down the shaft annulus at constant supply pressure decreased,
and this was taken ag an indication of a partial plug in the annulus.
The partial plug increased the pressure difference across the gasketed
joint between the shield plug and the bearing housing from O to 5 psi
at the design purge flow of 4 liters /min. Under these circumstances
the off-gas from the pump tank contained several hundred parts per
million of hydrocarbons. This indicated that the pressure difference
was forcing oil from the catch basin through the gasketed seal, down
the outside of the shield plug, and into the pump tank. The partial
plug could be removed temporarily by stopping the pump for: a short
time or by raising the temperature of the circulating salt from 1200
to 1250°F. When the plug was nob present, the concentration of hydro-
carbons in the off-gas stream from the pump tank was very low. Samples
of the plug material were obtained when the pump was dismantled. Ex-
amination showed them to be salt of the composition that was being cir-
culated by the pump, The mechanism by which the salt reached the shaft
annulus is being investigated.

Other tests were run in which oil was injected into the pump tank
through the sampler-enricher nozzle. Results of the analyses and other
information about both types of tests are reported in more detail in
Sect. 7.5, subsection entitled "Analysis of Helium Blanket Gas.’

 

*Densitometer was provided and operated by V. A. McKay of the In-
strumentation and Controls Division.

Pump Rotary Element Modification

 

The modification? that replaces the gasketed seal between the
shield plug and the bearing housing with a seal weld, which should
eliminate the oil leakage into the pump bowl, was completed on the
spare rotary elements for the MSRE fuel and coolant pumps and on the
rotary element for the MK-2 fuel pump. The spare element for the fuel
pump was tested in the cold shakedown stand and installed in the pro-
totype hot test stand for shakedown. During preheat of the system and
pump, approximately 1 qt of oil passed through the lower rotary seal
into the catch basin. The cause of the poor performance of the seal
is being investigated, and the rotary element is being cleaned and re-
assembled,

Cold and hot shakedown tests of the spare rotary element for the
MSRE coolant pump were completed. The hydrocarbon content in the pump
tank off-gas was not more than 15 ppm.

Tubrication System

The lubrication pump endurance test? was continued, and the pump -
has now run for 27,000 hr, circulating oil at 160°F and 70 gpm.

MK-~-2 Fuel Pump
The pump tank® is being fabricated, and, when completed, it will
be installed in the prototype pump test facility. Then the MK-2 fuel

pump will be tested at operating conditions simulating those required
by the MSRE,

3.2 Other Molten-Salt Pumps

 

PK-P Fuel-Punp High-Temperature Endurance Test .

 

Endurance operation? was halted as a result of a failure of the

drive motor. The pump had operated continuously for 7830 hr, circu-
lating the salt LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,; (65-30-4-1 mole %) at 1200°F, 800
gpm, and 1650 rpm. The rotor windings of the wound rotor motor had
selzed against the stator. The pump has operated for a total of 23,426
hr in four tests.

Pump Containing a Molten-Salt-Lubricated Journal Bearing

 

The gimbals support for the salt bearing” was modified, and a new
bearing and journal were fabricated. Performance of the salt bearing
will be investigated with an oil lubricant prior to molten-salt lubri-
cation.

4.1 Temperature Scanner
Performance of the temperature scanning system® continued to be
generally satisfactory, although some problems were experienced with
the oscilloscopes and mercury switches and some system instability was
noted.

The problems with the oscilloscopes were only continuations of
those previously experienced due to the age and design of the scopes.
The scopes are about 12 to 15 years old and have been a continuing
source of trouble. Manufacture of the scopes was discontinued, so -
no spare parts were available. Two new solid-state-circuit scopes
were ordered and installed. The new scopes have apparently elimi-~ -
nated that problem, although more time is required fo evaluate their
performance.

Although the mercury switches have continued to give much better
service than expected, some problems due to normal wear developed.
Upon ordering replacement parts for the switches, it was discovered
that the switches were no longer manufactured and no spare parts
existed. Some spare parts and switches were obtained from the ORNL
Reactor Division, but it was apparent that a replacement switch was
needed. A possible replacement was found at Union Carbide Corpora-
tion, Olefins Division, in South Charleston, West Virginia. The Olefins
Division has developed a solid-state multiplexer as a direct replacement
for the mercury switch and has agreed to sell one to ORNL for test and
evaluation. An order has been placed for one unit, with delivery expected
about January 1967. In the meantime the Reactor Division will continue
to supply mercury switch spare parts as long as they are available and -
can pe released for our use. -

The scanner instability problems mostly resulted from operating
the system outside its design range. The system was adjusted to ob-
tain more display resolution and to provide easier readout for the
operators. In order to do this the alarm discriminator was required
to operate outside its design range, causing alarm set point insta~
bility. To eliminate this problem while continuing this mode of op-
eration would require redesign of the discriminator, so operation of
the system was changed back to comply with the original design. A
calibration and test unit is being designed and will be installed
shortly to provide the operators with an easy method of calibrating
the system and of checking its stability. This test unit will pro-
vide a variable, accurately calibrated signal to one point on any of
the selected scanners and will allow the operators to check the scan-
ner calibration and alarm set points during routine operation of the
scanner system.

4.2 High-Temperature NaK-Filled Differential-Pressure Transmitter

Testing of the coolant-salt system flow transmitter which failed
in service at the MSRE and which was subsequently refilled with eili-~
cone 0il® was continued. Further testing at temperatures over the range
from room temperature to 1200°F confirmed that the temperature sensi-
tivity had been significantly reduced by the refilling operation but
was still excessive. Before refilling, the zero shifts observed were
of the order of 15 to 20 in. (water column) per degree Fahrenhelt change
in body temperature. After refilling the shifts were of the order of
1 in. HO per degree Fahrenheit. Zero shifts of the order of 0.1 in.
Ho0 per degree Fahrenheit or less are required to obtain the accuracy
desired in measurement of MSRE coolant-salt flow. In all cases the
temperature-induced shifts observed were zero shifts. No shifts of
span calibration were observed. Also, the instrument did not exhibit
a sensitivity to static pressure changes either before or after refill-
ing.

The remaining shifts are presently believed to be due to the con-
tinued presence of some gas vold in the silicone-oil-filled cavities.
Attempts to eliminate these voids will be made by repeating the £ill-
ing operations. To assure that all remaining gas has been removed, at-
tempts will be made to obtain a "harder" vacuun than the 28 in. Hg
vacuum previously obtained. After refilling, the temperature sensi-
tivity tests will be repeated,

The new NaK-filled differential-pressure transmitter ordered for
use as an MORE spare was received; however, acceptance tests showed
that the instrument was extremely sensitive to temperature and static
pressure variations and would, therefore, nob meet specifications.
Negotiations with the manufacturer for repair or replacement of the
transmitter are in progress.

4.3 Molten-Salt Level Detectors

 

Performance of all molten-salt level detectors installed at the
MSEE, on the MSRP level Test Facility, and on the MSRE Prototype Pump
Test Loop continues to be satisfactory.? 3 No failures have occurred
in any of the level devices during the past report period, and, except
for the changes made in electronic equipment associated with the ultra-
sonic level probes reported below, no modifications have been required.
The corrections made in the calibration of the ball-float-type trans-
mitter installed on the MSRE coolant-salt pump? were apparently ade-
quate, and no further adjustments have been necessary.

To correct the excessive frequency drift present in the excitation
oscillator supplying the ultrasonic level probe,” 18 a number of minor
changes were made in the components and circuitry of the oscillator and
detector amplifier circuits. In general, these changes involved the re-
placement of a number of critical components with high-grade components
having very small temperature coefficients, increasing the size of
86

coupling capacitors so that they would have smaller reactance at the
25-kilohertz operating frequencies, and making several minor circuit
revisions to increase the stability of the B+ supply. These changes re-
sulted in a considerable improvement in the frequency stability. Before
the changes were made the oscillator drifted randomly, with a maximum
deviation from the center or resonant frequency of 300 hertzes. This
deviation was sufficient to cause the instrument to become inoperative.
When the changes were made, the maximum drift observed after warmup was
5 hertzes. These drifts were observed in an alr-conditioned laboratory
and are expected to be greater in the field; however, it is expected
that the increased stability obtained will be adequate. A complete
check on the operability of the ultrasonic level probe requires an
actual variation of the level of molten salt in the fuel storage tank

of the MSRE. No salt has been transferred to or from this tank since
the probe circulbtry was modified, and field checks on the effectiveness
of the modifications have not been made at this time. These checks will
be made when salt transfers can he made without interference with MSRE
operations.

4.4 Helium Control Valve Trim Replacement

Modifications and/or repair of two weld-sealed helium control valves
which failed in MSRE service during the previous report period’ have been
completed. The spline-type trim previously used in the main helium supply
control valve, which had failed twice, was replaced with a taper trim.

The use of taper trim was permissible and desirable because of the rela-
tively high flow rates involved.

There have been no further failures of helium control valves during
the past six months.

To determine the feasibility of controlling very low flows of dry
helium with sliding disk valves, a mockup of such a valve was constructed
and tested. The active member of the sliding disk valve 1s a flat disk
attached to the valve stem and held against a seating surface by spring
and pressure action. The surface between the disk and seat is lapped
to light band flatness to assure tight shutoff. Throttling control of
helium flow is accomplished by means of a tapered V-notch in the disk,
which connects a port in the disk to a port in the valve seat. Rota-
tion of the disk causes the effective cross-sectional area of the pas-
sage between the ports to vary in proportion to the degree of rotation.
This type of construction offers promise in the control of dry-helium
flow because of an inherent self-wiping action and because of the pos-
sibility that the valve might be operated without the use of lubricants.

Preliminary results of bench tests were inconclusive because of
excessive leak rates between the lapped surfaces of the disk and seat.
The tests will be repeated after additional lapping, cleaning, and re-
assembly of the valve are completed.

5.1 Analysis of Rod Drop Experiments

 

Deseription of Experiments

 

The series of zero-power nuclear experiments made during MSRE run
No. 3 included several rod drop experiments as part of the control rod
calibration program. The purpose of these experiments was to provide
an alternative and independent measurement of the control rod reactivity
worth, which could be compared with worths determined by other methods -
(rod-bump period measurements and equivalent 235 addition). Three sets
of rod drop experiments were performed, after additions of 30, 65, and :
87 capsules of excess 2357 had been made. Fach set of experiments in-
cluded rod drops both with the fuel circulating and with circulation
stopped. We have analyzed the experiments made with the Tuel pump
stopped, and the results are summarized below.

The rod drop experiment consists of the intentional scram of a rod,
or rod group, from an initially critical configuration, and the recording
of the decay of the neutron flux as a function of time following the
scram. One then determines the amount of negative reactivity required
to produce this flux decay trajectory. The trajectory is characterized
by a sharp drop in the flux immediately following the scram, which corre-
sponds closely with the actual fall of the rod. The curve rapidly and
continuously evolves into one with a much slower rate of flux decrease,
governed by the decay of the initial distribution of delayed-neutron
Precursors.

Due to the requirement imposed by tnils experiment of accurately
recording the flux while it is rapidly falling by about two decades, the
graphical record obtained from the trace of a log n recorder is of limited
usefulness. The combined requirements of fast response, good counting
statistics, and reproducibllity can be served, however, by recording the
integrated count as a function of time following the drop.

In order that the integrated flux-time curve could be recorded with-
out requiring scalars with special accurately timed cycles for count ac-
cumulation and recording, three scalars, together with a photographic
technique of rapid recording, were employed in the following way. One
of the scalars was driven by one of the fission-chamber channels. The
other two were operated as 60-cps timing devices. One of these timers
was synchronized to start with the scram of the rod, while the other
timer and the count-accumulating scalar were synchronized and started a
few seconds before the scram was initiated. The three scalars were
stacked together in a vertical array, and a raplid-action camera was used
to simultaneously photograph the records on the three scalars approxi-
mately once every second, starting a few seconds before the scram and
ending about 30 sec after the scram. From these photographs, the count

88
89

rate at the initial critical condition, the time of the scram signal,

and the integral of the flux, or count rate, as a function of time fol-
lowing the scram could be accurately determined. In these experiments,
the position of the fission chambers was adjusted to obtain an initial
count rate at criticality of approximately 30,000 counts/sec, which was
low enough to result in quite small counting rate losses due to dead-time
corrections. Also, the remote position of the MSRE instrument shaft,
relative to the reactor core, would be expected to minimize errors due to
changes in the spatial flux shape during the rod drop experiment.

Analysis Procedures

The method used to analyze the experiments performed with the fuel
pump stopped was that of comparison with theoretical flux decay curves.
These latter curves corresponded to a negative reactivity insertion with
magnitude determined from the integral worth vs position curves already
obtained from period measurements and critical position comparison tech-
niques,” and with rate of insertion corresponding to the fall of the rod
from its initial critical position. The theoretical time~integrated flux
decay curves were calculated using the MATEXP program? to integrate the
standard space-independent reactor kinetics equations. Since this program
is designed to integrate a general system of first-order differential
equations, the theoretical time-integrated flux following the scram could
be obtained by solving the system:

position; -

t = effective lag time between scram signal and start of rod
drop (~20 msec);

a = acceleration during fall (~15 ft/sec?);

t= time to fall to scram position.

As discussed previously, the value of p(y) used in this analysis was
determined by integration of period differential-worth measurements. We
have also used an algebraic representation of these experimental curves,
obtained by a least-squares curve-fitting procedure.’

In applying the above analysis to the experiments in which rod groups
were dropped, the magnitude of the total negative reactivity insertion
was determined by combining the calibration curve for the single rod with
the results of rod-shadowing experiments (comparisons of critical positions
of’ single rod and rod groups). Typical rod-group drop experiments con-
sisted of the simultaneous scram of the regulating rod (rod No. 1) from
its initial critical position and one or both of the shim rods from the
ol

fully withdrawn position. The normalized shape of the reactivity in-
sertion curve for the rod group was approximated by that corresponding
to a single rod, falling from the fully withdrawn position.

Results

The results of the rod drop experiments made after additions of 30,
65, and 87 capsules of enriching salt are shown in Figs. 5.1, 5.2, and
5.3 respectively. In all three sets of experiments, the analysis of the
single rod drops shows very good consistency with the rod worth cali-
bration obtained by integration of the differential worth measurements.
A similar consistency was obtained from the experiments involving the
scram of all three rods. In the case of the two-rod experiments, results
obtained after 65 and 87 capsules appear to be slightly anomalous with
respect to the experiment with the same rod group after 30 capsules.
Multiplication of the magnitude of the negative reactivity insertion by
a Tactor of about 1.05 brings the calculated and experimental curves for
these experiments into better agreement. IHowever, another source of this
discrepancy could be in the approximation of the shapes of reactivity in-
sertion ve time for the tandem fall of the rods by that corresponding to
a single rod. This source would be expected to have its greatest in-
fluence on the two-rod experiments.

The sensitivity of these experiments to variations in the magnitude
of the reactivity insertion is illustrated in Fig. 5.4. Here the analysis
of the experiment where rod No. 1 was scrammed after addition of 30 cap-
sules is reproduced from Fig. 5.1; the theoretical curves are added which
correspond to an increase and a decrease of 5% of the total magnitude of
negative reactivity insertion. For this particular experiment, this
corresponds to an increment of 0.007% 8k/k in the magnitude of reactivity.
With the exception of the apparent ancmaly in the experiments involving
the scram of two rods, the results of all these experiments were well
within the 5% band of self-consistency with the rod calibration results
obtained from the differential worth measurements.’

Work will continue on the analysis of these experiments and similar
ones performed with the fuel circulating, in an effort to assess the full
potential of the rod drop experiment as a routine method for rapid periodic
redetermination of the shutdown worth of the MSRE control rods.

6.1 MSRE Materials Surveillance Testing
W. H. Cook

Specimens of grade CGB graphite and Hastelloy N (INOR-8) were re-
moved from the core of the MSRE after 7800 Mwhr of operation as part of
the materials survelllance program.’ The visual appearance of the metal
and graphite wag good. The external surfaces were virtually free of salt.
The metal was dull gray, and the graphite appeared unchanged by the expo-
sure, The Reactor Chemistry Division was supplied with graphite speci-
mens for fission product analyses from the top, middle, and bottom of
the assembly. The results of their analyses are reported in Chap. 7.
Other examinations scheduled for the graphite and metal are in progress.

The objective at this stage of sampling was to remove one stringer
(one-third) of the assembly and return the others, plus a replacement,
to the reactor. However, approximately one-seventh of the assembly ion
a zone just above the midplane of the reactor was severely damaged.
Graphite specimens were buckled and broken, and the tensile rods were
beut. Apparently, the assembly had been locked together by frozen salt
during the reactor cooldown, and the large differences in the coeffi-~
cients of thermal expansion of the graphite and metal created high
stresses which led to the mechanical damage. The damage in this zone
occurred in all three Hastelloy N and graphite stringers, requiring that
all three be replaced. The graphite and Hastelloy N in the other por-
tions of the array were suitable for the intended property evaluation
tests.

A slightly modified replacement for the damaged reactor core speci-
mens has been installed in the MSRE. The modifications were made to re-
duce mechanical stresses in the assembly by reactor heating and cooling
cycles, The Hastelloy N tensile specimen rods in the new set are made
from reactor vessel wall and head materials plus two modified alloys of
Hastelloy N, one containing 0.52 wt % Ti and the other 0.43 wt % Zr.
These additions were made for the purpose of reducing the effects of
radiation on the alloy.

In general, the molten salts drained well from the graphite and the
metal specimens, as shown in Figs. 6.1 and 6.2. The near absence of salt
aided the disassembly.

The overall mechanical damage in the reactor core specimens is shown
in Fig. 6.2 and in more detail in Fig. 6.3. A region of minor damage
near the bottom of the assembly is shown in Pig. 6.3a, and the region
of maximum damage is shown in Fig. 6.3b. Approximately 25% of the
graphite specimens were broken in each of the three stringers. The
general appearance of the graphite was the same as it was when it was
machined. Note the reflection of the cross pin in the surface of the
graphite in Pig. 6.32a.

Fig. 6.3. Details of the Mechanical Damage to the Graphite and
Hastelloy N Specimens in Zones of (a) Moderate and (b) Severe Damage.

The graphite specimens had been assembled so that they formed tongue-
and-groove joints that were bound together by Hastelloy N straps, as shown
in Figs. 6.2 and 6.3. ©Slip-fit sleeves had been spot-welded to the metal
straps that hold the rods of tensile specimens in position. The graphite
was held within the cage of tensile specimen rods by cross pinning through
the shoulders of the tensile specimens (Fig. 6.3a).

The total assembled length of the graphite stringers at room
temperature was 62 in. At the reactor operating temperature, 1210°F,
the graphite and Hastelloy N had expanded approximately 0.06 and
100

0.55 in. respectively. At the freezing temperature (850°F) of the

flush salt, the Hastelloy N was approximately 0.32 in. longer than

the graphite. During any heating or cooling of the assembly, the greater
expansion of the Hastelloy N tensile specimen rods requires that their
shoulders slide within the sleeves, which were spot-welded to the straps
that bind the graphite specimens.

On disassembly, it was found that most of the graphite tongue-and-
groove joints had separated during the heatup and allowed salt to become
entrapped in the joints. As the reactor cooled, the salt had frozen in
small rectangular platelets, as shown in Fig. 6.4. These ranged from
0.022 to 0.065 in. in thickness. Their typical thickness was 0.03 in.,
which means that the room-temperature length of each stringer of graphite
and salt was approximately 62.21 rather than the normal 62.00 in.

The third item found was that some of the sleeves were locked to the
shoulders of tensile specimens by frozen salt. The most strongly bonded
sleeves were at the ends of the severest damage.

PLATELET OF FROZEN SALT

and-Groove Graphite Joints.

We conclude that the Hastelloy N tensile specimen rods sought to
return to their original room-temperature length during the reactor cool-
down, but they were obstructed by the sleeves that were attached to the
rods with frozen salt and by the increase in room-temperature length of
the graphite columns created by the frozen salt trapped in the joints.

The graphite specimens were end loaded, and they buckled and broke in

the manner of slender colums. Calculations based on 45,000 psi, the
lowest value, for the yield strength of Hastelloy N, showed that the

end loading would be sufficient to buckle such slender columns of graphite,
assuming that the ends were fixed and the loads were axial. As one might
expect, the thinnest specimens were broken more frequently than the thicker
ones.

We believe that the damage was unavoldably magnified during the re-
moval of the assembly from the perforated basket. We assume that a broken
piece of graphite became tilted in the region that showed the severest
damage, and this tilted piece of graphite acted as a yoke to bind the
assembly in the basket when approximately one-third of the assembly had
been withdrawn from the basket. The additional damage was probably created
by this yoke when the assembly was forcibly extracted the rest of the
way out of the basket.

Because many finished specimens were available for use in a replace-
ment assembly and time was short, we decided not to make major revisions
in the design of the assembly. We did, however, make three minor modi-
fications to the basic design to alleviate these problems.

1. To avoid the entrapment of salt within the tongue-and-groove joints,
0,040-in.-diam pins of Hastelloy N were used to pin the joints so
that the graphite would not separate during the heatup.

2. To minimize the distances that the shoulders of the tensile rods must
slide within their sleeves, the middles of the graphite stringers were
pinned to the middles of the tensile specimen rods. Since expansion
is now forced to work both ways from the pinned middles, the differ-
ential movements are halved. However, the maximum movement, for the
sleeves and shoulders farthest from the middle, is still as much as
0.2 in.

3. To minimize friction, misalignment, and salt entrapment, the sleeves
were shortened and split longitudinally. Compare those of Figs. 6.3a
and 6.5.

The weakest point in the modifications is that salt may freeze in
some of the annular spaces between sleeves and shoulders and that the
pins in the tongue-and-groove joints may shear.

The graphite specimens in the modified assembly were made from grade
CGB graphite that is inferior to the graphite in the first assembly in
that it has more cracks. The Hastelloy N tensile specimen rods of this
second assembly were made from the reactor vessel wall and head materials,
heat Nos. 5085 and 5065, respectively, plus two Hastelloy N alloys modi-
fied with 0.52 wt % Ti and 0.43 wt % Zr, heat Nos. 21545 and 21554 re-
spectively. The modified alloys are attempts to reduce the damaging

effects of irradiation. The specimens are included in the series in
order to study the effects of the alloying additions on damage by irra-
diation and corrosion by molten salt.

Flux monitors of 0.020-in.-diam wires of type 302 stainless steel
and pure iron and nickel had been sealed under vacuum in a protective
sheath of Hastelloy N as shown in Figs. 6.6 and 6.3a. In the postirra-
diation examination, the stainless steel and iron wires were readily
separated from the sheath, although the stainless steel showed some signs
of bonding to it. The nickel wire had solid-phase-bonded throughout its
length to the sheath.

The new set of flux monitors installed in the MSRE with the new re-
actor core specimens are of the same materials. However, to guard against
a repetition of the solid-phase bonding, the flux monitor wires and the
inside of the sheath were heat treated in air to produce thin oxide coat-
ings on them. To minimize vaporization of oxide, the sheath was sealed
with 1 atm of air at room temperature.

6.2 Evaluation of Possible MSRE Radiator Tubing
Contamination with Aluminum

D. A. Canonico D. M. Haseltine

On Sunday, July 17, a cast Al-5 wt % Zn alloy blower failed at the
MSRE site, throwing small shrapnel across the Hastelloy N tubing of the
salt-to-air radiator. The failure occurred at about 10:00, while the
radiator was operating at 1070°F. The protective doors were closed while
the salt was still circulating; the temperature then rose to approxi-
mately 1200°F. This temperature was maintained until 14:30, at which
104

time the salt was drained and the heat was turned off. At 19:00, the
temperature had decreased to 250°F. The doors were opened and the tem-
perature dropped further to 150°F at 20:00.

A metallurgical investigation was conducted to determine the effect
of the aluminum-zinc alloy on the radiator tubing. Since the actual
tubing could not be removed and sectioned metallographically, only spec-
imens simulating the exposure could be prepared and evaluated. Small
segments of the failed blower were tested in compatibility experiments
with representative samples of the tubing.

Laboratory experiments were conducted to determine the influence of
temperature and time upon the Hastelloy-N—aluminum-alloy interaction. Tem-
peratures of 1150, 1175, 1190, 1200, 1225, and 1250°F were investigated,

and times at temperature ranged up to 5 hr. Figure 6.7 shows the samples
after being held at temperature for 15 min. Figure 6.8 shows the samples
with the aluminum removed from the tubing. The refractory aluminum oxide
coating had contained the aluminum, even in the molten state, and inter-
action did not occur. The rounded corners indicate that a liquid phase
was present at 1175°F and above; metallographic examination verified this.

When the oxide skin was broken from mechanical abrasion, shock, or
other reasons, wetting occurred. Figures 6.9a and 6.90 show the appear-
ance of a specimen where an angular drop of aluminum alloy had broken
through its skin and become attached to the Hastelloy N tube. The spec-
imen was held for 5 hr at 1200°F. A metallographic section through the
cone and tube revealed the moderate interaction shown in Fig. 6.9c. At-
tack to a depth of approximately 0.010 in. had occurred.

Since these experiments indicated some possibility of penetration
of aluminum into the MSRE radiator tubes, they were inspected carefully
for both dents and attached shrapnel. The difficulty of this task can
be shown by Fig. 0.10, a photograph of the face of the radiator. The
close-packed spacing of the tubes made the use of mirrors and elaborate
lighting necessary. It is estimated that 80% of the surface area of
the tubing was examined.

Eight smears of aluminum were found on the air-inlet side of the

tubing on the air-inlet side, but no aluminum was detected in these
areas. It is thought that the dents resulted from small rocks, etc.,
which the blowers had drawn in at an earlier date.

The tubes on which aluminum was found were marked and subsequently
cleaned. Stainless steel wool was used to remove most of the aluminum
from a deposit area; then emery paper was employed. The radiator was
then brushed thoroughly to dislodge any pieces of aluminum that might
have been missed during inspection.

Ag a result of this investigation and cleanup procedure, it appears
that the radiator system is satisfactory for further operation. Actual
adherence of the aluminum to the tubing was observed in only a few cases.
Inspection and cleaning of accessible tubes assured that aluminum was re-
moved from those most likely to be contaminated. If intimate contact
occurred in scattered areas, interaction does not appear to be rapid.
Longer time effects are being studied by visual and metallographic
analysis of specimens from tests of duration up to 1000 hr.

6.3 Evaluation of Graphite

 

W. H. Cook

Work has continued on the evaluation of anisotropic and isotropic
grades of graphite as potential materials for molten-salt breeder re-
actors.? The MSRE graphite properties are being used as a hasis for
comparison. The needle-coke, anisotropic graphite has the more desir-
able properties for excluding molten salts and gases but is less stable
under irradiation. Some isotropic materials show promise, but many of
the isotropic grades of graphite tend to be too amorphous for nuclear
use. Isotropic grades of graphite are new, and past development has
not been directed toward the production of material having the low gas -
permeabilities and small pore entrance diameters required of graphite
for molten-salt breeder reactors. :

Table 6.1 is a comparison of the physical properties of the various
grades of graphite. The specific resistances of these indicate that grades .
CGB, CGB-ILB, 14R25-64-1, and H-315 are fairly well graphitized; the rest
are too amorphous. For isotropic graphite, we desire specific resis-
tance less than 900 microhms em? emt. The gas permeabilities are all
very high. We are seeking permeabilities approaching 1077 cm? [sec

The pore entrance diameters are important in that (1) they must be
small enough to prevent penetration by the nonwetting fluoride salts
and (2) they must be grouped to minimize the number of impregnations
necessary to fabricate the base stock into a low-permeability graphite.
For the latter, it has been reported that pore entrance diameters should
be less than 1 pn and be concentrated in a narrow range .> 4 The grades
of graphite shown in Fig. 6.11 are finished grades rather than base
stocks, but only grades CGB, CGB-LB, and EP1924-1 appear amenable to
improvement by impregnation treatments. The third grade had been al-
ready ruled out because of its amorphous nature.

The standard salt screening test was made in which 0.500-in.-diam -
by 1.500-in.-long specimens were exposed for 100 hr to molten salt at
1300°F under a 150-psig pressure. The results are shown in Table 6.1.
The MSRE grades CGB and CGB-LB are included for reference purposes. Of
the new grades, only grade 1425-64-1 showed a pore structure approaching
the quality of the MSRE graphite.

Work is in progress to obtain additional anisotropic and isotropic
grades of graphite with properties superior to those of the MSRE graphite
and approaching those required for the molten-salt breeder reactors.

6.4 The Internal Stress Problem in Graphite Moderator Blocks
C. R. Kennedy

One of the major concerns in the use of graphite-moderated reactors
is the stress generation caused by differential growth. The stress gen-
eration is moderated considerably and generally maintained at safe levels
by the ability of the graphite to creep under irradiation. The problem
resolves itself to a determination of the balance between the differential
growth rate that produces stress and the creep that reduces stress. Al-
though the creep-rate coefficient may be such that the stress level does
not exceed the fracture strength, a second concern is the ability of the
graphite to absorb the creep strain indefinitely without failure. Cer-
tainly, a failure criterion based upon the fracture stress of the mate-
rial is accurate. Therefore, it is of great importance to know both the
restrained growth rate and the creep coefficient for the material under
the operabing conditions. Our purpose has been to determine the general
creep behavior of graphite under irradiation.

Creep experiments were performed at 700 and 1000°C for comparison
with the previous data’ obtained at lower temperatures. The high-tem-
perature experiments were again similar to the previous experiments in

that cantilevered parabolic-beam specimens were used. The main differ~
ence was in the use of four-zone furnaces to obtain the desired Lemper-
atures. The number of specimens was reduced from nine to six because
of the space requirements of the furnaces.

Results from all creep experiments performed from 150 to 1000°C do
demonstrate a generalized creep behavior, as shown in Fig. 6.12. This
type of behavior strongly supports a Cottrell model for irradiation
creep, which allows extrapolation of these data to most reactor grades
of graphite. The Cottrell model for irradiation creep, as given by
Anderson and Bishop,® is

K = Ay/o_ (1)
y
where
K = creep coefficient,
A = accommodation factor,
¥ = shear rate due to anisotropic growth (G, ~ GJ,
oy = yleld strength of the crystallites,

G, and Gy are the growth rates in the ¢ and a directions.

The shear rate ¥ of graphite can be derived from measurements made
on pyrolytic graphites through estimates of polycrystalline graphite
growth rates. The accommodation factor A primarily reflects the degree
of accommodation by microcracks and, in general, the void volume in the
graphite. It is not necessarily constant and is expected to vary with
temperature and neutron exposure. The variation of A with temperature
should not be very large; however, A should exhibit a rather significant
increase as microcrack closure occurs. The closure of microcracks re-
quires a dose of approximately 102%? neutrons /cm?; thus the value of A
will be essentially constant for at least half this dose. The value of

the yield strength or flow stress, 0,, of the crystallites will undoubt-
edly vary under irradiation and with irradistion temperature. The value
of Oy, like that of A, will not vary with temperature, however, as gig-
nificantly as ¥, the shear rate.

The creep-rate coefficient should therefore strongly reflect the
variation of 7 with temperature. This is demonstrated in Fig. 6.12,
where the creep-rate coefficient exhibits a minimum around 350°C. The
creep-rate coefficient K is not exactly proportional to the shear rate
¥ because of the variations of A and Oy. The value of A would be es-
sentially independent of the graphite grade; thus the effect of Gy on
the creep-rate coefficient can be demonstrated by a comparison of var-
ious grades at the same temperature, This was demonstrated previously?
by comparing the modulus of elasticity of six grades of graphite to their
creep-rate coefficients at 400°C. Although this correlation strongly
supports Hq. (1), or the Cottrell model, for the creep of graphite, one
glaring discrepancy in the correlation is the test result at 1000°C for
the CGB grade of graphite. It should be noted that this particular ma-
terial demonstrated a one-third decrease in its modulus of elasticity,
which is also unlike the behavior of previously tested grades. This
particular test result requires confirming data before specific conclu~-
sions can be reached.

One should recognize that the Cottrell model for creep does not sug-
gest an actual mechanism by which the graphite deforms plastically. It
does describe the creep as a process of continuous yielding, which is
not thermally activated as the term creep generally implies. Also, the
manifestation of the creep deformation is actually nothing more than a
stress-induced imbalance of the internal straining occurring in all poly-
crystalline graphites due to anisotropic growth. This implies that the
limit of creep deformation can be as large as the internal strains that
must occur in polycrystalline graphites irradiated without stress. Poly-
crystalline graphite can accommodate 16% shear strain and polycrystalline
carbons 160% shear strain’ without a loss of mechanical integrity. The
obvious conclusion is that as long as the stress acting on the graphite
does not exceed the fracture stress, the graphite will continue to ab-
sorb the creep deformation without loss of mechanical integrity.

6.5 Brazing of Graphite

J. M. Jones We J. Werner

The joining of graphite to structural metals such as Hastelloy N
is of prime interest in advanced molten-salt reactor concepts. Studies
are under way Lo develop methods for joining large graphite pipes to
Hastelloy N tube sheets. Such joints will be needed for test assemblies
and for the reactor core.

The current studies have two primary objectives: (1) to develop a
corrosion-resistant brazing alloy for graphite which does not suffer from
113

the transmutation problem associated with the gold-containing alloys and
(2) to develop means for making transition joints with one or more ma-
terials having expansion coefficients intermediate between those of the
graphite and the Hastelloy N.

Work was focused on the evaluation of an experimental precious-metal-
base alloy having the composition 60 Pd—35 Ni-5 Cr (wt %) . This alloy
appears to have some application for Joining graphite to the refractory-
metal portion of a transition piece. Unfortunately, it exhibits rela-
tively poor flowability on high-density graphite (Fig. 6.13a); however,
its marginal behavior is enhanced by preplacing it as foil in the joint
(Fig. 6.13b). Photomicrographs of such a Joint at low and at high mag-
nification are shown in Figs. 6.14a and 6.14b. The needle-like carbides
of Fig. 6.14a are clearly evident in Fig. 6.14b. The extensive diffu-
sion zone along the molybdenum—brazing-alloy interface in Fig. 6.l4a
suggests that considerable molybdenum was taken into solution in the
brazing alloy.

A series of graphite-to-molybdenum joints brazed with this palladium-
nickel-chromium alloy preplaced in the joint were thermally cycled ten
times between 200 and 700°C, Metallographic investigation indicated that
no deterioration had occurred.

Small arc-melted buttons of other alloys in this ternary system,
but with higher chromium contents, are being prepared in an effort to
improve wetting of graphite without reducing the overall joint proper-
ties. Alloys containing other corrosion-resistant carbide formers, that
is, niobium and molybdenum, are also being prepared.

Two graphite-to-molybdenum-to-Hastelloy-N transition joints were
successfully brazed using the tapered joint design reported previously.®
The 1-1/4~-in.-0D by 3/16-in.-wall graphite tubing was Joined to the mo-
lybdenum with the 60 Pa—35 Ni—5 Cr (wt %) alloy preplaced in the joint;
copper was used to braze the molybdenum to the Hastelloy N. Visual ex-
amination revealed no cracks, and metallographic examination will be used
to further evaluate the joints.

6.6 Corrosion of Graphite-to-Metal Brazed Joints

 

W. H. Cook

As was discussed in the previous section, some success has been
obtained in joining small pieces of graphite to metal by brazing the
graphite to molybdenum and, in turn, brazing the molybdenum to Has-
telloy W.2*0 In addition to making a good Joint, the braze must be
resistant to corrosion by molten fluoride salts. Corrosion of the
brazing alloy is being investigated by exposing joints of grade CGB
graphite brazed to molybdenum to static LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-ThF,-UF, salts
for 100, 1000, 5000, 10,000, and 20,000 hr at 1300°F in Hastelloy N
capsules. The brazing alloy, 35 Ni—60 Pd—5 Cr (wt %), was not at-
tacked by the salt during exposures for as long as 5000 hr. However,
layers of metallic-like crystals appeared preferentially on the braz-
ing alloy in the 1000- and 5000-hr tests. The 10,000- and 20,000-hr
exposures are still in progress.

The method of fabrication of test specimens is shown in Fig. 6.15.
The lateral surfaces of the machined pieces were polished prior to cut-
ting the pieces into 0,62-in.-long specimens. The microstructures of
the left and right edges of the sides (the sides are perpendicular to
the plane shown) of an untested braze in Fig. 6.16a show that this pro-
duces straight, smooth sides suitable for references for determining the

and all others were cut into halves perpendicular to their 0.62-in.
dimension, and these cut surfaces were polished and photographed. This
technique was used to compare the control specimen with those tested
for 100, 1000, and 5000 hr (Fig. 6.16). There is no microscopic evi-
dence of attack on the braze. Deposits approximately 0.5 and 1 mil
thick are evident on the sides of the brazes exposed for 1000 and 5000
hr respectively. These layers are crystalline and metallic in appear-
ance. They have not been identified. The chemical analyses of the
salt from the 1000-hr test did not detect any corrosion products; the
analyses for the 5000-hr test are in progress.

Interpretation of the 5000-hr test is further complicated by a thin
metallic-like deposit on the graphite. It is unlike the layers on the
braze alloy in that it does not exhibit crystalline faces. The deposit
was heaviest on the side of the graphite parallel with the brazed joint.
Its microstructure is shown in Fig. 6.17. The identification of this
layer is being sought. It is suspected that this may be CriCs. In
previous tests that involved only salt, Hastelloy N, and graphite, there
were no deposits on the graphite. The longer-term tests appear necessary
to explain the cause of these deposits.

6.7 Welding Development of Hastelloy N

H. BE. McCoy D. A, Canonico

Titanium and zirconium additions to Hastelloy N appear to improve
the resistance of the alloy to high-temperature embrittlement in an ir-
radiation field.

We have made welds in several experimental heats to evaluate the
influence of these alloy additions on the weldability. Welds have been
made in 1/2-in. plates of Ni—l2 Mo—7 Cr—0.05 C (wt %) with titanium
contents of 0.15, 0.27, 0.33, 0.45, and 0.55 wt %. These welds appear
to be sound. and test specimens have been made for evaluation.

Alloys containing Ni-12 Mo—7 Cr—0.05 C (wt %) and either 0.06 or
0.43 wt % zirconium have also been studied. The alloy containing 0.06
wt % zirconium exhibited extensive weld cracking. It was impossible to
get a complete pass in the alloy containing 0.43% zirconium without a
crack propagating the entire length of the pass. Some attempts have
been made to weld these heats with dissimilar weld metal.

Effect of Irradiation on the Mechanical Properties of Hastelloy N —
H. BE. McCoy

The foremost objective of this effort has been to determine the in-
fluence of neutron irradiation on the mechanical properties of the Has-
telloy N used in ccnstructing the MSRE. We have utilized postirradiation
tensile tests, in-reactor creep-rupture tests, and postirradilation creep-
rupture tests to evaluate the performance of several representative heats
of material used in the MSRE. Portions of this study have been reported

life for the MSRE. One of the most interesting findings in this study

is illustrated by the data in Fig. 6.18. Although the rupture life and
ductility are both reduced by irradiation, the data indicate that there
may be a stress below which essentially no irradiation damage occurs.

One of the current theories of high-temperature irradiation damage
predicts this type of behavior, since some minimum stress is required
to allow the bubbles of transmuted helium to grow without limit.'® The
existence of a stress below which one could design without concern for
gross reductions in ductility due to neutron damage is of extreme im-
portance and needs to be studied further.

The surveillance specimens were removed from the core of the MSRE
after 7800 Mwhr with an effective integrated dose of about 7 X 101°,
So far as neutron dose is concerned, these specimens should be repre-
sentative of the pressure vessel after the reactor has operated about
150,000 Mwhr (equivalent to 15,000 hr at a power level of 10 Mw). The
specimens have been disassembled, but testing will not begin until after
examination with an optical comparator to separate the bent ones. Limited
creep and tensile tests will be run to determine whether the properties
fall in line with those determined previously for material irradiated to
the same dose.

The second objective of this program has been to understand the
mechanism of the damage in Hastelloy N and to determine a means of
making a basic improvement in its resistance to irradiation damage.

We have found that the damage is dependent on the thermal-neutron flux.
This is illustrated by the data in Table 6.2. Specimens were exposed
to neutron environments of various energies, and it was found that

the damage was fairly independent of fast dose and depended primarily on
the thermal dose. It is believed that the specific thermal-neutron re-
action is that of the transmutation of *°B to helium.

Hence, the first approach to the problem has been that of reducing
the boron level. Figure 6.19 shows the postirradiation creep-rupture
properties of several alr-melted heats of Hastelloy N. The materials
contain between 20 and 40 ppm boron. The rupture ductilities are given
in parentheses. There seems to be little effect of irradiation temper-
ature on the rupture life or ductility. Figure 6.20 shows the proper-
ties of two vacuum-melted heats containing 7 ppm (2477) and 9 pri boron
(65-552). When the materials are irradiated at a low temperature, their
properties excel those of the air-melted heats. When these same heats
are irradiated hot, they exhibit properties comparable with those of the
alr-melted heats.

Fig. 6.20. Postirradiation Creep-Rupture Properties of Several
Vacuum-Melted Heats of Hastelloy N at 650°C. Numbers indicate fracture
elongations.

Several of the alloys were irradiated to various doses, and the
helium content was calculated from the dose and the original boron con-
tent of the alloy. Figure 6.21 shows the rupture ductility in a tensile
test at 650°C and 0.002 in./min as a function of helium content. There
is considerable deviation about the line drawn, with some of it probably
being significant. The two vacuum-melted heats (65-552 and 2477) again
show lower ductilities when irradiated hot. The two low points for heat
4065 indicate a possible influence of high irradiation temperature on
this heat. However, the most important observation is that, for a rea-
sonable '°B content and a reasonable lifetime, the helium content will
be between 107° and 107° atom fraction. The variation in ductility over
this range of helium contents is only about 25%, assuming that the line
drawn is reasonably correct.

A similar plot is shown in Fig. 6.22 which relates the helium pro-
duced in the alloy to the fracture ductility. The line drawn seems 10
be representative of the higher-boron air-melted heats (5065, ete.).
The vacuum-melted low-boron heats (65-552 and 2477) exhibit better duc-
tility if they are irradiated cold but actually have lower ductility
when irradiated hot. Hence, the role of boron in these alloys is not
at all clear, We have not prepared a series of alloys where everything
else has been held constant except the boron content. It seems that
the variations in composition and melting practice must influence the

distribution of boron or the effect that the transmuted helium has on
the properties so greatly that the role of boron per se is masked. The
great effect of irradiation temperature on the postirradiation proper-
ties of the vacuum-melted alloys supports this supposition.

Although we have known for some time that the ductility of an ir-
radiated test specimen varies greatly with temperature, we have made
extensive use of postirradiation tensile tests for screening purposes
even when we were interested in long-term applications. Figure 6.23
shows how misleading this approach can be.

The rupture ductility in postirradiation tensile and creep tests
is plotted to illustrate the influence of zirconium content on the
properties. The two sets of points at the left were obtained by tensile
tests ab two different strain rates (0.05 and 0.002 in./min). The trend
is evident that the ductility improves with increasing zirconium content.
However, the ductility in the creep tests (represented by the points at
the right) shows no systematic dependence on the zirconium content. This
material contained extremely high boron (approximately 200 ppm), and we
believe that the data do not warrant the conclusion that zirconium has
no beneficial influence.

The important point is that tensile tests may not be adequate even
for screening purposes in nickel-base alloys. The more expensive creep
test may be necessary.

RUPTURE LIFE (hr)
123

Several small commercial melts have been procured and evaluated.
The basic alloy is Ni—12 Mo~7 Cr—0.05 C, the reduction in molybdenum
content being made to suppress second~phase formation. The alloy addi-
tions investigated include niobium, tungsten, and titanium. To date,
these alloys have been investigated in only one metallurgical state, 40%
cold working followed by 10C hr at 871°C. This treatment produces a very
fine grain size and probably does not result in the optimum properties.
Figure 6.24 shows the postirradiation creep properties of several of
these alloys at 650°C. The very encouraging alloy is No. 21545, which
contains 0.5 wt % titanium. The rupture life is better than the other
alloys, but the rupture ductility is far superior.

Figure 6.25 shows a compilation of all the in-reactor creep tests
run on various heats. All the data are contained in a scatter band
bounded by heats 5065 and 5085. With few exceptions, all the heats ex-
hibit fracture ductilities of 1 to 3%, with no systematic heat-to-heat
variation evident. Three of the heats lend support to the idea that
there may be some critical stress below which irradiation damage be-
comes minimal. One must face the question of why heat 21545 looks ex-
cepbionally good in pestirradiation creep tests (Fig. 6.24) and not in
in-reactor creep tests (Fig. 6.25). With a closer examination, one sees
that the test at 21,000 psi (Fig. 6.25) did not fail during the experi-
ment. This point indicates that the threshold stress for damage in this
alloy may be higher than that for the other alloys (approximately 15,000
psi). Thus the in-reactor creep tests do suggest that the titanium-
bearing alloy may be superior.

Figure 6.26 shows the results of postirradiation creep tests on sev-
eral laboratory heats containing various amounts of titanium, All the
alloys are superior to irradiated standard Hastelloy N with respect to
both rupture life and ductility. Several of the alloys exhibit rupture
lives in excess of that of unirradiated Hastelloy N and ductilities as
high as 10%.

Characterization of Hastelloy N for Service at 982°C — H. EK. McCoy

 

Since Hastelloy N is being considered as the structural material
for a molten-salt distillation vessel, the Mechanical Properties Group
was asked to determine the creep properties of this alloy at 982°C.
The results of this brief study are presented, and several potential
problems associated with the use of Hastelloy N abt such an elevated
temperature are pointed oul, Although the vessel presently being built
will be used only with nonactive salts, it 1s anticipated that a similar
distillation apparatus will be an integral part of a Molten-Salt Breeder
Reactor. For this reason the questions concerning the use of Hastelloy N
for this application should be resolved,

The creep~rupture properties of Hastelloy N are well documentedl® 7?
over the temperature range of 600 to 800°C where it is commonly used.
However, data at 982°C were nonexistent, since this is above the normal
service temperature for this alloy. The results of a brief creep-rupture
program undertaken to supply data at 982°C are shown in Table 6.3. Plots
of these same data are shown in Figs. 6.27 to 6.29. These data were ob-
talned on test specimens of a typical heat of air-melted Hastelloy N (heat
5065). The test specimens were small rods having a gage section 1 in.
long X 0.125 in. in dlameter. All tests were carried out in dead-weight
creep machines in air. The creep properties shown in Fig. 6.27 indicate
that the stresses to produce rupture and 5% strain in 1000 hr are rea-
sonably well defined. However, the stresses for 1 and 2% strain in 1000
hr are not defined sufficiently by experimental data. The minimum creep
rate data in Fig. 6.28 correlate very well, but these numbers are not
very useful for design purposes, since the minimum creep rate only applies
during a small fraction of the life at a given stress. The plot of the
ductility shown in Fig. 6.29 exhibits a ductility minimum for test spec-
imens having rupture lives over the approximate range of 50 to 200 hr.
However, the minimum ductility observed still is slightly in excess of
20%. The reduction in areca decreases rapldly with increasing rupture
life to a value of about 15%. The increase in the elongation for long
rupture lives is thought to be associated with the very extensive in-
tergranular cracking that occurs.

The specimen from test 5768 was examined metallographically. The
extent of intergranular cracking is illustrated by Fig. 6.30. It was
also noted that the quantity of precipitate present after testing was
much greater than that present before testing. Figure 6.31 shows a
typical area of this heat of Hastelloy N prior to testing. Figure 6.32
shows the tested specimen. The precipitate marked "A" is believed to
be that present in the starting material. The larger precipitate, marked
"B," is thought to be induced by the thermal and mechanical history.

Staining with a KMnO4-NaOH solution indicated that the precipitates were

of two different compositions. Although this precipitation does not ap-
pear to impair the ductility at 982°C, it remains to be established whether
the low-temperature ductility is affected. Since the vessel will be ex-
posed to numerous thermal cycles, the high- and low-temperature ductilities
are both of interest.

The results of this study are hardly adequate for the design of a
distillation system that is to be an integral part of a reactor system.
This study has shown the need for (1) strength data extending to longer
times, (2) tests to evaluate the influence of the precipitation on the
ductility, and (3) oxidation data under conditions of constant and cyclic
temperatures.

6.8 Thermal Convection Loops

 

A, P. Litman G. M., Tolson

We are continuing to study the compatibility of structural materials
with fuels and coolants of interest to the Molten-Salt Reactor Program.
Natural-circulation loops described previously8:t° are used as the standard
test in these studies.

Currently, four loops are in operation. Three thermal-convection cir-
cults containing simulated MSRE fuel salt and fabricated from either Has-
telloy N, type 304 stainless steel, or Nb—1% Zr alloy with type 446 stain-
less steel external cladding have operated for approximately 4.5, 3.2,
and 0.6 years respectively. Operating conditions for the loops are de-
tailed in Table 6,4. The Hastelloy N and type 304 stainless steel loops
have continued to circulate salt without incident. However, the refrac-
tory~-alloy circuit has shown some degradation of late, This was evi-
denced by the cold leg gradually losing temperature despite the addition
of insulation. It is suspected that the smaller internal diameter of this
loop (0.3 in.) has contributed to the operational. problems.

The fourth operating loop (Loop 10) is fabricated from Hastelloy N
and contains a proposed secondary coolant (NaF-KF-BF;, 48-3-40 mole %)
for the reference-design MSBR. This circuit has operated for over 3000
hr with the hot leg at 1125°F and a temperature differential of 265°F.
During this reporting period, a Croloy 9M loop (Loop 12) circulated the
proposed secondary MSBR coolant for 1440 hr, after which time it was
shut down dve to plugging. X rays taken of the loop disclosed spotty
high-density regions in the cold leg. A few suspicious areas were also
seen in the hot leg. The loop piping and heat-transfer fluid will be
subjected to complete chemical and metallurgical analysis.

A Croloy 9M (loop 8) natural-circulation locp containing lead with
230 ppm magnesium as an inhibitor plugged after operation for 2950 hr.
A section through the cold leg in the plugged region is shown in Fig.
6.33. Examination of the loop components is proceeding.

To date, all uninhibited lead systems constructed of carbon, low-
alloy, and stainless steels have tended to plug due to the formation of
dendritic erystals of iron and chromium in the cold regions of the loops.
The hot-leg attack has consisted of uniform surface removal with isolated
pits extending to a greater depth. While Nb—1% Zr alloy has exhibited
no measurable hot-leg corrosion during test, niobium crystals have been
found in the cold leg of a loop which operated for 5000 hr at 1400°F,

All these findings are discussed in detail in a report summarizing re-
sults to date on the circulating-lead loop program .2°

7.1 Chemistry of the MSRE

 

Behavior of Fuel and Coolant Salt — R. BE. Thoma

 

Several refinements of analytical methods were made during the low-
power operating period of the MSRE which led us to believe that the
composition and purity of the reactor salts can be ascertained accurately
and economically on a routine basis.! Within the last few months we have -
attempted to confirm this belief by demonstrating that samples of the
reactor salts could be obtained and analyzed on a routine basis with the
reactor operating at full power. In addition we have sought to establish
from the results a practical optimal frequency of sampling. Comparisons
of the current data with previous results indicate that the fuel and
coolant salts have not undergone perceptible composition change since
they were first circulated in the reactor some 16 months ago. The con-
centration of corrosion products has not increased appreciably in these
salts within the report period.

Fuel Salt Composition and Purity. Twenty-five samples of fuel salt
were removed from the MSRE during full-power runs FP-5, -6, and -7 for
composition analysis.? The results of these analyses, listed in Tables
7.1 and 7.2, show clearly the chemical stability of the fuel solution;
it has maintained constant composition since it was constituted in the
reactor in 1965.

 

Structural-~-Metal Impurities. The concentrations of structural-metal
corrosion products found in the MSRE fuel salt in the period January to
August 1966 are compared with previous assays in Table 7.3. Since chro-
mium is the most chemically active constituent of Hastelloy, all cor-
rosion reactions should, on proceeding to equilibrium, result in the .
production of CrF,. The extent of corrosion in the MSRE is currently
monitored by analyzing for the chromium content of the salts. In its
full-power operation during the period February to July 1966, the MSRE
has behaved well with respect to corrosion chemistry; no apparent cor-
rosion has occurred within the fuel or coolant systems. We have con-
cluded in the past that corrosion might be influenced by the presence
of a small amount (perhaps approximately 1%) of UF; formed in the IiF-
UF, enriching salt during preparation. When present, UF; is readily
oxidized to UF, in reaction with CrFj:

 

Crly, + UF3 = cr? + UF,

The presence of MoF, or MoFs in the fuel salt, as inferred from the re-
sults of recent examinations of surveillance specimens removed from the
reactor core,’ is puzzling in connection with the likelihood that UF;
still remains in the fuel salt. The notable freedom from corrosion
during this period therefore is reassuring.

The average concentrations of the structural-metal impurities which
have been found in the MSRE fuel salt since the beginning of reactor op-
erations are given in Table 7.3.

An interesting trend is evident in the above results. As impurities,
iron and nickel are presumed to exist as colloidally dispersed metallic
particles. The concentration of iron has decreased slowly but steadily
during reactor operation, while nickel analyses remained essentially
constant.

Oxide Analyses. Eight samples of MSRE fuel were analyzed for oxide
content during the recent full-power operations. etalls of the proce-
dures employed are given elsewhere.* The average value of oxide concen-~
tration was found to be 54 ppm, significantly lower than that found in

Isotopic Analysis of Uranium. Varistions in the relative concen-
trations of uranium isotopes in the MSRE fuel are determined on a regular
basis by mass spectrometric analysis.’ A summary of the isotopic analyses
of the MSRE fuel is given in Table 7.4, which shows qualitative evidence
of 235y burnup and ingrowth of 236, The limit of experimental accuracy
(#0.1% of individual values) and the low burnup fraction (approximately
1%) render the current values of little use for accurate calculation of
MSRE power levels at present. It is anticipated that as a greater
fraction of 239U is consumed, such determinations will assume greater
significance in corroborating burnup computations which are based on
performance data.

 

Coolant Salt Composition. Coolant salt was circulated in the MSRE
for some 1200 hr during the prenuclear test period. Since flush and
coolant salts were supplied from the same reservoir, the coolant salt
was analyzed during this period only for impurities. At the end of pre-
nuclear testing, concentrations of the structural-metal impurities, Cr,
Fe, and Ni, were established to be approximately 30, 90, and 7 ppm,
respectively, which are remarkably low considering that the circuit had
not been flushed previously with molten salt. The results of spectro-
chemlcal analyses made at that time showed that no significant amounts
of additional impurities were introduced during this period.® As the
reactor was brought to full power early in 1966, coolant salt was again
circulated, sampled regularly, and subjected to compositional and im-
purity analysis. The results obtained from these analyses are given in
Tavle 7.5.

 

In addition to the components, coolant salt was analyzed for, and
found free of, zirconium by wet chemical and spectrochemical methods.
The intention was to confirm that no fuel salt had been transferred to
the coolant circuit.

Analyses of coolant salts are conducted in the General Analysis
laboratory of the ORNL Analytical Chemistry Division, while those for
the fuel are obtained from the General Hot Analyses laboratory of that

division. It is apparent from the contrast of material balances shown

in Tables 7.1 and 7.5 that minor differences in analytical procedures
are employed. These differences were appraised with respect to their
possible influence on compositional analysis and were found to be in-

significant, since compositional analysis is computed from cation assays
without use of the fluoride values.
139

On the basis of the analytical data listed in Table 7.5, the present
composition of the coolant salt is 7IiF-BeF, (63.93-36.07 mole %),
practically identical with values obtained in earlier analyses® of the
flush salt (63.80-36.20 mole %). The unresolved disparity between the
design composition (66.0 * 0.25-34.0 % 0.25 mole %) and that found by
chemical analysis continued to be a puzzling matter. The excellent re-
producibility of chemical analyses throughout the operational period of
the MSRE is, however, of significance in affording the opportunity for
chemical trends to be observed.

7.2 Physical Chemistry of Fluoride Melts

Viscosity and Density of Molten Beryllium Fluoride — S. Cantor and
C. T. Moynihan¥*

The viscosity of molten BeF, was measured over the temperature range
573 to 985°C using Brookfield IVT and HBF5X viscometers. In this tem-
perature range, the viscosity, 7m, varied from 10 to 10% poises and was
ahout 10% greater than previously reported.’

The plot of log =n vs 1/7(°K) showed only slight curvature. A least-
squares fit of the data to an equation quadratic in 1/7 yielded the
following:

1.1494 x 10% 6.39 x 10°

log n (poises) = —8.119 + TR) + 7z ;

 

standard error in log 1 = 0.013. This corresponds to an apparent in-
crease in the activation energy for viscous flow from 57.3 kcal/mole at
985°C to 59.6 kcal/mole at 575°C. These are relatively small activatlon
energy changes, and thus the temperature dependence of the viscosity of
Bef, is basically Arrhenius over the range (10 to 10° poises) covered in
this investigation.

Density measurements were attempted via the Archimedean method, by
determining the apparent loss of weight of a platinum sinker when im-
mersed in molten BeF,. In such viscous melts, the balance is extremely
slow in coming to equilibrium; hence, the method? of extrapolating to
zero velocity the plots of rate of ascent or descent of the sinker under
various balance loads (measured by timing the travel of the balance
pointer) was used to determine the equilibrium weight of the sinker in
the melt. In none of the four attempts to measure the BeF, density was
it possible to eliminate the few small bubbles that adhered to the
sinker. 'The buoyant effect of the bubbles leads to low values of the
apparent weight of the sinker and, hence, to high values of the density.

If a surface tension of 200 dynes/cm is assumed for BeF,, the best
of our density results yielded a value of 1.96 + 0.01 g/cm? for Bel, at
850°C. This result must be considered only as an upper limit to the real
Bel, density, but it may be compared to the value of 1.95 + 0.01 g/cm? at
800°C reported by MacKenzie’ and to a value of 1.968 g/cm? measured for
the Bef, glass at room temperature. These results suggest that the thermal
expansion coefficient of liquid BeF, is quite small.

Transpiration Studies in Support of the Vacuum Distillation Process —
5. Cantor

 

To determine the equilibrium vapor separation of rare-earth fission
products from M3R carrier salts, a series of vapor pressures have heen
measured by the transpiration (i.e., gas-entrainment) method. The melts
were composed of 87.5-11.9-0.6 mole % LiF-BeF,-laFj3. These concentrations
of ITiF and BeF, are approximately those expected in the still pot of the
vacuum distillation process, but the lanthanum concentration is many times
greater than would be permitted as total rare-earth concentration in the
still. This high concentration of lanthanum in the melt was required in
order to give lanthanum concentrations in the vapor that were high enough
to analyze.

Measurements were carried out in the temperature interval 1000 to
1062°C; ary argon, the entraining gas, flowed over each melt at the rate
of about 30 cm’/min. Salt vepor, condensing in a nickel tube, was ana-
lyzed by spectrochemical and neutron activation methods. The latter
method gave higher, more consistent, and probably more reliable lanthanum
analyses. To date, the more consistent results have been obtained at
only two temperatures:

1000 210
1028 1150

SDefined as (mole fraction of lanthanum
in liquid)/ (mole fraction of lanthanum in con-
densed vapor).

At six other temperatures, transpiration pressure measurements yielded
much higher (up to 7300) decontamination factors; however, these deter-
minations either were based on insufficient sample for proper analysis
or else duplicate analyses gave widely different results. It did appear
that the higher the temperature, the higher the decontamination factors.

Although much more study 1s required before the vacuum distillation
process can be shown to be practical, it seems that decontamination fac-
tors close to 1000 can probably be demonstrated.

Estimated Thermophysical Properties of MSBR Coolant Salt — S. Cantor

 

Preliminary phase equilibrium studies have indicated that a mixture
containing 47.5 mole % NaF, 48 mole % BF, and 4.5 mole % KF (melting
point, 365°C) is sufficiently low melting for use as the secondary coolant
of the MSBR. To aid investigations (such as heat-transfer studies) that
will likely be carried out in the near future, estimates are given below
for some thermophysical properties of this mixture. It is anticipated
that certain thermophysical properties will soon be measured. The esti-
mates given herein are meant to serve until such measurements can be
made.

Measurements of dissociation equilibria have shown that KBF 0 is
mich more stable than NaBF,.%t The composition given in the first para-
graph can be recast as a mixture of fluoroborates whose composition is
(in mole %): NaBF,, 83.65; KBF,, 8.65; and NaF, 7.7. This recast form
is useful because it permits estimates of properties to be made in terms
of components which are all molten (or supercooled liquids) in the tem-
perature range of interest (BF; is a gas in this temperature range) .

Vapor Pressures. These were estimated by assuming (1) that the
fluorcborabe mixture behaves in accordance with Raoult's law and (2) that
the only vapor species is BF. Since the dissociation pressure of NaBF, tt
is many times greater than that of KBF,, , 0 then, given the two assump-
tions, the total vapor pressure P may be expressed as

dence of the proposed MSBR coolant is easily derived and is given by

Density. The liquid densities of the fluoroborates have not as yet
been measured. For an estimate of the density at 454°C, the following
assuwiptions were made:

1. The fluoroborate mixture is additive with respect to liquid molar
volumes of the components.

2. The molar volumes of liquid NaRF,'' ana KBF,1? are 1.2 times the
X-ray molar volumes of the respective solids.

3. The molar volume of supercooled liquid NaF at 454°C can be ob-
tained by extrapolation of the stable liquid values.t3

From these three assumptions a value of 2.1 g/cm? is calculated as
the density of the coolant at 454°C. This density is probably uncertain
by 10%. Because expansion coefficients of Fluoroborates are unknown,
estimations of the temperature coefficient of density would be premature
at this time.

Specific Heat. By using the rule’ that each gram-atom of a Tlu-

oride mixture contributes about 8 cal/°C to the molar hest capacity, the
molar heat capacity of the coolant equals approximately 48 cal/°C. But
since the coolant contains the complex ion (BF, 1%, some of the oscil-
lational degrees of freedom of the individual atoms are lost; ny guess

is thal this loss amounts to about 7 cal/°C. Thus, the estimated specific
heat is 41 cal/°C divided by the molar weight of the coolant, 106 g, or
about 0.4 cal g”! (°C)™*. This estimate is probably good to +25%.

Viscosity. The viscosity of NaBF, was measured!’ somewhat crudely

at two temperatures. The results were 7 * 2 centipoises at 466°C and
14 + 3 centipoises at 436°C. Since the coolant is predominantly NaBFg,
these rough values can serve as a guide to viscosity until further ex-
perimental values become available.

7.3. Separation in Molten Fluorides

 

Extraction of Rare Farths from Molten Fluorides into Molten Metals -—
J. I. Shaffer, F. F. Blankenship, and W. R. Crimes

 

This experimental program envisions a liquid-liquid extraction
process for removing rare-earth fission products from the fuel solvent
of the reference-design MSER and a similar back-extraction process for
concentrating them in a second salt mixture for disposal or further
utilization. This process is an alternative to distillation and like
the distillation process would follow removal of the uranium by the
fluoride volatility process. The results of previous experiments have
shown that a mixture of bismuth containing 0.02 mole fraction of lithium
metal sufficed for removing essentially all cerium, lanthanum, and neo-
dymium and substantial quantities of samarium and europium from a mixture
of IiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %).1® The second phase of the reprocessing
143

method would then involve the back extraction of rare earths from the
molten metal mixture into another salt mixture. Hydrofluorination of
such a two-liquid-phase mixture should be very effective for this step,
but the overall process would also result in the removal of some lithium
from the fuel. Since isotopically pure “Ii is used in the fuel, the con-
servation of this material is of economic importance. According to the
experimental data, the removal of 1 g of neodymium would result in the
loss of about 2.2 g of lithium. However, material balances on experi-
ments in which lithium was used as the reducing agent showed that only

25 to 50% of the lithium added to the extraction system was found as a
dissolved component of the metal phase. The quantity of lithium required
for the stoichiometric reduction of rare-earth fluorides was negligible
by comparison. Therefore, additional studies of the behavior of lithium
metal in the extraction system have been conducted.

Duplicate experiments dealt with the material balance of lithium in
bismuth in the absence of a salt phase. As in previous experiments,
about 2.35 kg of bismuth was contained in low-carbon steel at 600°C.
Filtered samples of the molten metal were taken after each incremental
addition of lithium metal to the systems and during prolonged equilibration
periods (100 hr) during which one mixture was maintained under static
helium and the second was sparged with dry helium. The results of spec-
trographic analyses of these samples showed that, as lithium was added,
its concentration in each vessel increased in amounts which corresponded
to about 75 to 80% of the amount added to each system. However, upon
standing, the concentration of lithium in each vessel became constant at
values which corresponded, very nearly, to the amount of lithium added.
These experiments 1llustrated the stability of lithium~vismuth mixtures
contained in low-carbon steel equipment and indicated that the rate of
dissolution of lithium into bismuth in the extraction systems was some-
what slower than anticipated.

The foregoing results showed that the unexplained lithium losses
were not attributable to the analytical procedure nor to the behavior of
lithium in the molten metal phase of the extraction systems. Accordingly,

the next phase of this experimental series was an examination of the ef-
fect of Lhe salt phase on the concentration of lithium in the metal phase.

A previously purified mixture of LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) was now
added to each of the above mixtures of lithium and bismuth in three suc~
cessive tared increments of about 1 kg. Filtered samples of the metal
phases were taken during 24~-hr equilibrium periods after each salt ad-
dition. The results of spectrographic analyses of these samples showed
losses of lithium from the metal phase after each salt addition. As
shown by Fig. 7.1, this loss corresponded to about 0.11 mole of lithium
per kilogram of the salt mixture and was independent of the concentration
of lithium in the metal phase. Although this loss may be attributed to
a number of possible circumstances, it should not materially affect the
economics of the rare-earth extraction process.

In earlier experiments, the extraction of rare earths from a salt
phase into molten bismuth was achieved by the addition of beryllium metal
to the system. This reduction process also resulted in an increase of the
lithium concentration of the molten metal phase. Accordingly, further

study of the reaction

in the two-phase extraction system has been initiated. The first experi-
ment of this series was conducted by adding clean beryllium metal turnings
to a two-liquid-phase system of 3.17 kg of LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) and
2.30 kg of bismuth contained in low-carbon steel at 600°C. Filtered
samples of the metal phase were withdrawn at 4- and 24-hr intervals after
each incremental addition of about 1 g of beryllium metal. These samples
were analyzed spectrographically for their lithium and beryllium content
by groups after 5 g of Be? had been added to the system. As shown by

Fig. 7.2, the lithium concentration in bismuth increased after each ad-
dition of beryllium until a value of about 0.16 mole fraction lithium was
attained. Beryllium concentrations in bismuth remained below the limit
of detection (less than 0.0001 wt %) of the analytical method. Thus, the
analytical results for lithium in bismuth should reflect dissolved lithium
metal concentrations rather than the dissolution or suspension of salt

in the molten metal phase. Since the distribution of rare earths between
the two liquid phases of the extractlon system was found dependent upon
the lithium concentration in bismuth, these results provide extrapolation
limits for estimating extraction parameters. If this limiting value of
0.16 mole fraction of lithium in bismuth is assumed to be in equilibrium
with beryllium metal at unit activity, the activity coefficients y of

Removal of Rare Earths from Molten Fluorides by Simultaneous Precipitation
with UF's — J. H. Shaffer and H. ¥F. McDuffie

 

The relatively low solubility of UF; in fluoride mixtures of interest
to the MSR Program, 2% together with the known similarities of the crystal
structure of rare-earth trifluorides with UFs,°% provides a basis for
studies of the precipitation of solid solutions of these compounds Trom
fluoride melts. Fission product rare earths represent a major portion
of the poison fraction in the fuel of a molten-salt nuclear reactor; this
study has been oriented toward the development of suitable reprocessing
methods for rare-earth removal. Initial experiments conducted in this
program considered the reduction of UF, contained in the reactor fuel
mixture to UF; and the simultaneous precipitation of rare-earth tri-
fluorides with UF; as the temperature of the fuel mixture was reduced.

A second series of experiments 1s in progress to examine the precipitation
of rare earths from a simulated fuel solvent upon addition of solid UFj.

If all the UF, contained in the current MSRE fuel mixture, LiF-Bel,-
ZrF,-UF, (65.0-29.1-5.0-0.9 mole % respectively), were reduced to UFs,
the solution would be saturated with UF; at approximately 725°C. By
lowering the melt temperature to 550°C, approximately 83.5% of the uranium
would be precipitated from solution. Results of preliminary experiments
designed to investigate this reprocessing method demonstrated that laFs,
Cef3, and Nd¥; could be precipitated with UF3. Europlum and samarium
were probably reduced to their divalent states by the in situ reduction
of uranium with added zirconium metal and showed little or no loss from
solution during the precipitation of UF;. Subsequent experiments with
excess reducing agent showed that cerium removal could be related to the
Ut concentration in solution by the equation

In New = kK In Nja+ + const , (3)

where Nem and Nya are respective mole fractions of rare earth and tri-

valent uranium. As illustrated in Fig. 7.3, a value of about 0.55 was
146

obtained for k in Eq. (3) for the simultaneous precipitation of CelFj.
Further investigation would be needed to verify this experimental rela-
tionship for other rare earths of interest to the program.

A more recent experimental program has been concerned with the re-
tention of rare-earth triflucrides on a hed of solid UF; as an alternative
reprocessing technique. In this experiment, UF; was added in 30-g incre-
ments to approximately 2.2 kg of LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) that initially
contained 107% mole fraction of CeFs3 with about 1 mec of l44te as a radio-
tracer. Filtered samples of the salt mixture were taken approximately
48 hr after each addition of UF3 and analyzed radiochemically for cerium.
As shown by Fig. 7.4, these results illustrate a somewhat linear decrease
in cerium concentration as UF; was added which corresponds to a solid .
rhase which contained about 1 mole % Cel's.

Removal of Protactinium from Molten Fluorides by Oxide Precipitation —
J. H. Shaffer, F. ¥F. Blankenship, and W. R. Grimes

 

In a previous experiment, protactinium was removed from solution in
a solvent mixture of LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %), containing ZrF, (0.5 mole
per kg of salt), by the addition of ZrO, at 600°C.%2 An interpretation
of the experimental data according to the equation

n 1 7 J

Fre, salt 2r0z

where D = (Pa)oxide/(Pa)salt, Fo, = fraction of Pa in the salt, and W =

weight of the designated phase, showed that the distribution of pro-
tactinium between the two phases remained constant over the protactinium
concentration range of the experiment. These results could be inter-
oreted as the formation of labile oxide solid solutions or as surface
absorption of 233Pa on the solid ZrQo. Further studies of this oxide
precipitation behavior were conducted In the same fluoride solvent with
Zr0, powders having varied surface areas.

Zirconium dioxide used in the original experiment was purchased
commercially and had a surface area of about 19.6 m?/g. Material having
higher surface areas was prepared from Zr (0H), by dehydration. ?* Suf-
ficient ZrO, for this experimental series was fired at 600, 700, and
1000°C in separate batches that yielded average surface areas of 80, 50,
and 1.32 m?/g respectively. About 3.55 kg of a salt mixture having a
nominal composition of ILiF-Belf,-ZrF, (64.8-33.6-1.6 mole %) with about
1 me of ?33pa {as irradiated ThO, ) was prepared in a nickel vessel by
our usual HPF-H, treatment at 600°C, followed by Hy, sparging at 700°C for
further purification and dissolution of protactinium as its fluoride
salt. Selected ZrO, was added to the salt mixture in 10-g increments;
the mixture was then sparged with helium at a rate of about 1 liter/min
during 24-hr equilibration periods. Filtered samples of the salt mixture
were taken after each equilibration period and analyzed radiochemically
for 233pa by counting its 310-kv photopezk on a single-channel gamma
spectrometer. At the conclusion of the experiment, the mixture was
hydrofluorinated to convert added ZrO, to its fluoride salt and to restore
233pg activity in the molten-~salt phase. This experimental procedure
was repeated with the same salt mixture for all three lots of Zr0s.

In each experiment the addition of ZrO, to the fluoride mixture re-
sulted in the loss of protactinium from solution. However, as shown by
Fig. 7.5, a plot of the reciprocal fraction of 232Pa in solution vs Zr0so
added, according to Eq. (4), yielded distribution coefficients for 233Pa
between the two phases which varied continuously as the precipitation
reaction approached completion. These experimental results are contrary
to those obtained previously with respect to the constancy of the 233pg,
distribution coefficients; they indicate that 233pg removal from the salt
mixture is not proportional to the surface area of the added oxide parti-
cles and also does not conform to an equilibrium solid solution. Experi-
ments in progress will attempt to further elucidate the characteristics
of the oxide precipitation process.

Extraction of Protactinium from Molten Fluorides into Molten Metals —
J. H. Shaffer, F. F. Blankenship, and W. R. Grimes

 

The removal of protactinium from solution in IiF-BeF,-Th¥i, (73-2-25
mole %) by adding thorium metal directly in the salt mixture or by con-
tacting the salt with molten lead or bismuth in which thorium had been
dissolved has been demonstrated in several experiments.” More recent
experiments have examined methods which could be used for recovering
protactinium from the fertile blanket of the reference-design MSBR. The
results of several batch-type laboratory experiments led to the design
and operation of a small pump loop which has demonstrated, in principle,
the removal of protactinium from molten fluorides by a liquid-liquid ex-
traction technique.

In early experiments a molten fluoride mixture containing dissolved
233pa and molten bismuth containing dissolved thorium metal were left in
contact in low-carbon-steel containers under static conditions. Subse-
quent examinations of the container indicated that most of the prot-
actinium had deposited on the vessel walls that were in contact with the
salt phase. The disappointing failure of the protactinium to cross the
boundary of the two liquid phases may have resulted from nonwetting be-
havior. The effects of such behavior could be greatly reduced by the im-
rroved contacting obtainable in a pump-loop system.

In other experiments in which no salt phase was used, solutions of
233pa in molten lead and bismuth were obtained by the addition of irradi-
ated thorium metal to the liquid metals in steel containers. Radio-
chemical analyses of filtered samples taken from these vessels showed
149

that 233Pa did not form stable solutions in either liquid metal. About
40% of the 223Pa activity was retained in bismuth, and less than 5% was
retained in lead during 48-hr contact periods. Much of the 233pa was on
the walls of the vessels, with the distribution shown in Fig. 7.6. The
larger amount near the bottom of each vessel implies loss of 233pg via
sedimentary deposits of insoluble materials rather than by surface ad-
sorption. It is of interest that the concentrations of thorium in bismuth
were found, spectrographically, to be less than the 1000 ppm added and
well below reported solubility values of 3000 to 4000 ppm. 27

The fractions of 222Pa and thorium found in solution in oismuth were
roughly equal. The concentrations of both increased for about 5 hr after
the irradiated thorium was added to the liquid bismuth and then decreased
with time. The behavior in lead appeared to be considerably different.
Although as much as 80% of the thorium dissolved in the lead, the fraction
of protactinium in solution remained very small.

We concluded from these data that bismuth is the preferable extractant
and that formation of slightly soluble compounds can complicate the ex-
traction of protactinium from fluoride salts by causing the effective solu-
bility of protactinium in liquid bismuth to be low. Although a high solu-
bility seems desirable, the liquid-metal phase in the process acts only
as a carrier to transfer the protactinium from one salt to another. High
solubility of protactinium in the liquid metal is not an essential condi-
tion for attaining adequate transfer rates. Thus, a pump-loop experiment
was tried in an effort to achieve transport of vrotactinium from a blanket
salt while maintaining a low concentration in the liquid bismuth.

An experimental loop, shown schematically in Fig. 7.7, was designed
to contact a fluoride mixture containing dissolved 233pa with a recircu-

lating stream of molten bismuth containing thorium. The thorium was intro-
duced by passing the bismuth over thorium chips Just before its entry into

the extraction vessel. Thus, at low flow rates thorium would be introduced
at a rate regulated by its solubility in bismuth. The alloy was then
sprayed into the salt mixture so the protactiniuwm would be extracted at

the surfaces of free-falling droplets of bismuth. A pseudo-first-order
rate of extraction was expected.

Although the blanket reprocessing method involves stripping the prot-
actiniun from molten bismuth into a second salt mixture by hydrofluori-
nation, this feature was not included in the initial pump-loop design.
Instead, the recirculating molten-metal stream was pumped through a bed
of steel wool to provide for the collection of protactinium by absorption
on the iron surfaces or by filtration of suspended particles. This ex-
pedient was based on results of the experiments described above and on
another in which thorium metal was added to a blanket-salt mixture that
contained ?33Pa. The protactinium was found uniformly distributed on
steel wool that had been immersed in the salt.

Accordingly, the steel wool column was designed to provide a large
surface area of iron relative to iron surfaces exposed to the liquid
phases elsewhere in the system without unduly restricting the flow of
bismuth. The extraction vessel was also fitted with an open cylinder of
niobium for primary containment of the salt mixture. The centrifugal
pump was the same as that designed and operated by E. S. Bettis, Reactor
Division, in similar molten-salt-molten-lead systems.

Pump-Toop Operation. Several related experiments were carried out
in the pump loop. The loop was first charged with 13.5 kg of bismuth that
151

had been previously treated with hydrogen at 600°C for oxide removal. This
material was circulated through the system to ascertaln operational pro-
cedures and pump performance characteristics. The steel wool column was
then prepared on its fixture, inserted into the system, and fired with
hydrogen at 700°C in situ while bismuth was static, and the balance of
the system was protected from oxide contamination by flowing helium.

The column contained 12.5 g of grade 1 steel wool having a total surface
areca of 0.49 m? or about ten times that of the geometric surface of iron
that was elsewhere exposed to bismuth in the circulating system. The
salt mixture ILiF-BeF,-ThF, (73-2-25 mole %) was spiked with about 1 me of
233pg from irradiated ThO, by our usual HF-H, treatment in nickel at
600°C and with Hs, alone at 700°C. Approximately 6.7 kg of this material
was transferred into the niobium-lined extraction vessel.

Bismuth was at first circulated without a reducing agent, to estab-
lish the stability of 233Pa in the salt mixture. Then thorium metal was
introduced in small amounts by submerging a basket of thorium chips in
the bismuth stream at the outlet of the column. Five successive additions
of thorium were made in this manner during this phase of the experiment.
The radiochemical results obtained from filtered samples of the two liquid
phases during some 30 hr of pump operation are shown in Fig. 7.8. It is
interesting to note that the 233pg, activity in the salt phase was ex-
tremely stable during the first 17 hr of loop operation and the first
three additions of thorium. After the fourth addition of thorium, the
233py activity in the salt phase decreased at a measurable rate until
apparent exhaustion of the thorium metal and continued after the fifth
thorium addition until 57% of the ?23Pa was removed. As shown by Fig.

7.9, this removal rate reasonably agreed with a first-order rate relation
postulated for the reduction of protactinium by bismuth droplets of con-
stant thorium concentration while falling through the salt phase. The
run was interrupted at this point to correct a malfunction in the pump.
The appareuat collection of sollds about the pump rotor resulted in a
seizure which could not be overcome by the low-torque 1/3-hp motor.

A compilation of material balance data on thorium added to the sys-
tem is shown in Table 7.7. Since the thorium baskets were coated heavily
with bismuth, the actual quantity of thorium introduced into the system
was estimated by volume loss rather than by weight balance. Spectro-
graphic analyses of samples taken prior to each thorium addition showed
that very little thorium or reduced lithium was retained as a soluble
component of the metal phase. Chemical analyses of salt samples from
corresponding periods showed that the chromium concentration of the salt
rhase was reduced from 164 to less than 2 ppm after the first thorium
addition and remained at that level for the duration of the experiment.
Concentrations of iron and nickel were virtually unchanged at about 125
and 30 pom respectively.

During the interruption, the column of steel wool was removed from
the system for examination. Although the column had gained considerable
weight, only the head-end sections (the bottom of the column) contained
appreciable quantities of solids. A quantitative analysis lor 233pg in
the column was made by E. I. Wyatt, Analytical Chemistry Division, by
dissolving the entire assembly into an aqueous solution. Radiochemical
analyses of aliquots of this solution were related to the total volume
of solution and the quantity of 233pg present originally in the salt sys-
tem. On this basis, the column accounted for about 14% of the 223Pa.
Since 43% of the 233Pa activity remained in the salt and 3% remained in
the metal, about 39% of the 233pa was apparently deposited elsewhere in
the system.

The second steel wool column was assembled with coarser grades of
steel wool in the inlet section in an attempt to retain more of the
solids. In the previous column the filterable solids were stopped by the
first three of eight sections of steel wool. It seems possible that
solids held by inertia on the head end of the column settled in the pump
bowl when the pump was stopped. The steel wool on the new column had a
net weight of 18.2 g and a surface area of 0.87 m°.

The results of radiochemical analyses of filtered samples from the
two liquid phases taken during this second extraction experiment are
summarized in Fig. 7.10. Two additions of thorium during 15 hr of pumping
made no change in the 233pa concentration in the salt phase. Because the
pump was operating poorly and the flow rate of bismuth was irregular,
subsequent thorium additions were made through the sampling port directly
to the salt phase. Three l-g additions of thorium reduced the ?33Pa con-
tent of the salt phase to about 27% of its original value before the run
was interrupted to change out the steel wool column. During this op-
erational interval, 16% of the 233pa was removed from the salt phase, 4%
was in the metal phase, and about 7% was found on the column.

The steel wool column for the final extraction experiment was pat-
terned after the preceding one. A total of 28.7 g of steel wool from
grades 3 through O provided a surface of 1.4 m®. Thorium metal was added
in three 2-g increments during 12.5 hr of pump operation. Radiochemical
analyses of filtered samples of the liquid phases are shown in Fig. 7.11.
Protactinium was removed from the salt phase until about 4% of the 233pg
remained at apparent equilibrium. During this period the pump was op-
erated at its maximum allowable speed in an attempt to wash protactinium
from the walls of the extraction vessel and to better suspend any prot-
actinium-bearing solids in the molten bismuth. Material-~balance calcu-
lations show that 23% of the original quantity of 233pg was removed from

the salt phase. About 19% of the 233p3 was on the column, giving an
82.6% recovery for this third experiment.

Chemical analyses were obtained on salt samples taken during the
second and third extraction experiments. Concentrations of iron ranged
randomly from 100 to 170 ppm, while chromium and nickel were virtually
absent at reported values of less than 10 ppm. The niobium content of
the salt phase was consistently below the detectable level of 4 ppm.
Values for the concentration of bismuth in the salt mixture ranged from
67 to 264 ppm in a random manner; the arithmetic average concentration
from all samples was 119 ppm. However, it was not possible, under the
experimental conditions, to ascertain whether these values represented
dissolved bismuth or droplets suspended in the salt mixture. The values
did not, however, reflect the pumping speed of the bismuth or a dependence
on time.

Discussion and Conclusions. The protactinium balance for the com-
plete experiment shows that 96% of the 233pg originally in the salt phase
was removed by thorium metal additions. At least 43% was pumped as a so-
lution or suspension in molten bismuth and deposited on rather small
volumes of steel wool. Since an additional 4% of the 232ps remained in
each of the two liquid phases, we can account for about 51% of the prot-
actinium.

 

Although large amounts of thorium were added to the system, the con-
centration in bismuth remained very low. Considerable thorium had to be
added in the first experiment before any protactinium was extracted from
the salt. Additional thorium was consumed without extraction of prot-
acktinium at the beginning of the second experiment, which followed the
changeout of the steel wool column. Reduction of scme metal fluoride
impurities from the salt was evident, but the amount was not sufficient
156

to account for all the thorium losses. Some high-melting metallic plugs
were taken from the system, and the spectrographic analyses showed them
to contain high concentrations of thorium associated with iron and
chromium.

The collection of protactinium on the steel wool columns appeared
to be primarily a filtration process, although some surface absorption
also was apparent. We expected some mass transfer of iron in the poly-
thermal loop system, but it appears that the transfer was aggravated by
the presence of thorium. We believe that iron, chromium, and thorium,
accompanied by some of the protactinium, formed compounds of low solu-
bility in bismuth at the operating temperature. Precipitates formed,
some of them collected on the filter, but the remainder collected in
other parts of the system to account for the thorium and protactinium
losses. This suggests that a more resistant material, such as niobium,
would be desirable for use in the extraction equipment. .

The pump-loop experiments will be continued. The next one is planned
to demonstrate recovery of protactinium from the liquid-metal stream by
contacting the bismuth with a molten salt that is saturated with a mixture
of HF and Hp.

Protactinium Studies in the High-Alpha Molten-Salt Laboratory — C. J.
Barton

An experiment on the removal of protactinium from a breeder-blanket
mixture LiF-Th¥, (73-27 mole %) having an initial concentration of 25
ppm of ?31Pa was described in the previous report .2” Reduction of prot-
actinium was effected by metallic thorium in the presence of lead at
about 625°C. The fact that only a small fraction of the reduced prot-
actinium was found in the liquid lead encouraged study of other reduction
techniques.

Reduction with 30l1id Thorium. Several experiments were performed to
study the reduction of protactinium in IiF-ThF, (73-27 mole %) by solid
thorium in the form of a rod or turnings. Three different container ma-
terials were used: nickel, copper, and graphite. The first experiment
was conducted in a nickel container with a 3/8-in.-OD thorium rod. The
231pa content of the salt mixture, based on analysis of filtered samples,
dropped from 11.1 to 0,09 mg during the initial 65-min exposure of the
rod to the molten fluoride mixture at 625°C. A further 5-hr exposure at
the same temperature produced an apparent increase in 22*Pa content to
0.54 mg. A large fraction (approximately 70%, or 28 g) of the part of
the rod that was immersed in the molten-salt mixture was lost during the
experiment. We believe that the thorium rod was in contact with the
bottom of the nickel pot during this experiment, causing a current flow
that corroded the rod electrolytically. The salt mixture removed from
the nickel pot contained a large amount of black material, part of which
was magnetic. The analysis of the magnetic part showed 45% Ni, 30% ‘Th,
and 0.015% 231Py, The black, nonmagnetic material contained 22% Ni,

50% Th, and 0.027% 231pa.

 
157

A second experiment, performed under conditions described above ex-
cept that care was exerted to avoid contact of the thorium rod with the
nickel pot, gave more readily understandable results. The 231py concen
tration of a filtered sample of the salt dropped to 30% of the initial
concentration (32 ppm) after a l-hr exposure and to 19% after the second
hour of exposure. A ground sample of the unfiltered salt removed from
the pot at the conclusion of the experiment had a higher concentration of
231pg than the initial filtered sample. This may have been due, in part,
to the fact that the precipitated protactinium was redissolved by HF-H,
treatment in 2 smaller volume of fused salt than was present at the be-
ginning of the experiment because of the removal of a significant fraction
(about 2.5%) of the salt in each filtered sample.

The next experiment was similar to the previous one except that
thorium turnings supported in a nickel-plated copper screen were exposed
to the melt for 65 min and the 221Pa concentration of filtered salt de-
creased to 9% of the initial value. The screen came loose from its sup-
porting rod when we attempted to remove it from the pot, and it remained
in the molten mixture. Consequently, it was necessary to dissolve the
thorium metal by prolonged treatment with an HF-H, mixture in order to
redissolve the precipitated protactinium. The 231pg concentration of a
filtered sample was 92% of the initial concentration after a 170-min
HE-H, treatment, and, after an additional 43-min treatment, an unfiltered
sample showed a content equal to 96% of the initial value.

In the fourth thorium reduction experiment, we again exposed the
melt containing 19 ppm of 231ps to thorium turnings held in a nickel-
plated copper screen and found that a 120-min exposure removed 97.5% of
the protactinium from solution, as determined in a filtered sample. This
time, however, we removed the basket and turnings from the melt, cooled
to room temperature with a helium atmosphere in the pot, and disassembled
the apparatus to determine the distribution of reduced protactinium. The
recovered salt contained 51% of the amount of 231pg present at the be-
ginning of the experiment, the basket and contents had 20%, the wall had
7%, while the dip leg and magnetic material removed from the szlt (plus
particles produced in sawing through the nickel pot) each contained about
19. About 16% of the protactinium was unaccounted for.

Experiments very much like that described in the previous paragraph
were conducted in copper and graphite containers to study the effect of
container material on distribution of reduced protactinium. In both
cases, approximately 60% of the recovered protactinium was found in the
ground, unfiltered salt (and untreated with HF and Hy), although only 5%
of the initial protactinium concentration was present in the final 1il-
tered sample of reduced salt in the graphite container experiment and
29% in the copper container. It appears, therefore, that a large fraction
of reduced protactinium remains suspended in the molten LiF-Thf, mixture
regardless of the container material.

Electrolytic Reduction of Protactinium in IiF-ThF, (73-27 Mole %).
A series of exploratory experiments on the electrolytic reduction of
protactinium in molten IiF-Th¥, (73-27 mole %) has been conducted with a
variety of electrode arrangements. None of these arrangements has been
explored in detail, and the preliminary results obtained in some cases

 
158

are more confusing than enlightening. Consequently, these experiments
will be summarized very briefly.

Graphite anode — nickel vessel cathode — 3.0 v and 0.5 amp: "The
protactinium content decreased during the first hour of electrolysis and
then increased during the second and third hours for reasons that are not
all clear.

Silver ancde — graphite liner or nickel dip leg as cathode — 3.0 v
and about 1 amp: About 20% reduction in 23%Pa concentration after elec-
trolyzing for 2 hr.

Thorium rod anode — thorium rod cathode ~ graphite liner — 3.0 v
and about 1.6 amp: Removed 95% of 231pg during 70-min electrolysis
(filtered sample), but 95% of the initial 22*Pa concentration was found
in the unfiltered salt.

Nickel rod immersed in bismuth connected to negative side of 6.0-v
battery — nickel rod immersed in the molten fluoride connected to positive
pole of battery — 5.0 v and about 2.7 amp: No reduction in protactinium
content of salt, and only a trace amount was found in the bismuth.

Another construction of the previous experiment with bismuth cathode
(i.e., nickel dip leg contacting both salt and bismuth) — graphite anode
contacting fluoride mixture only — graphite liner ~ 5.0 v and 0.5 amp:
Again, there was no significant reduction in the protactinium content of
the salt. About 0.02% of the protactinium was found in the last filtered
sample of bismuth as compared to 0.4% in the unfiltered bismuth. The
latter also contained 6.3% nickel.

Conclusions. Protactinium dissolved in molten IiF-ThF, can be re-
duced to a form that does not pass through a sintered copper filter, but
a large part of the precipitated protactinium remains suspended in the
molten mixture.

Exploratory experiments on electrolytic reduction of protactinium
have not produced encouraging results to date, but we are continuing to
pursue this approach to the protactinium removal problem because of its
potential simplicity.

Xenon Diffusion and Possible Formation of Cesium Carbide in an MSBR
C. ¥. Baes, Jr., and R. B. Evans TIT

Previously, several investigators have considered the neutron poison-
ing effect caused by diffusion of 135%e into the graphite moderator of a
molten-salt reactor.28732 It is the present purpose to consider as well
the effects of the cesium which is born within the graphite by decay of
the various fission product xenon nuclides which have diffused there. In
159

particular, it is of interest to estimate whether or not sufficient con-
centrations of cesium might occur to form (lamellar) cesium carbides, as
by

s%(g) + nC(s) = csC_(s) ,

and whether or not a sufficient amount of CsC, could be formed to damage
the graphite in a full-scale MEBR.

In an attempt to answer these questions, the partial pressure of
cesium within the graphite void spaces was calculated using the following
model and assumptions:

1. Diffusion of gaseous xenon into the graphite vold spaces and dif-
fusion of gaseous cesium out of the graphite were approximated as
one dimensional; that is, the moderator was represented as a slab
of graphite infinite in two dimensions, with a specified thickness
(2L), immersed in the fuel salt.

2. All cesium born in the graphite was assumed to be in the gaseous
elemental form. Cesium born in the fuel salt or reaching the fuel
salt by diffusion from the graphite was assumed to be oxidized to
¢st and to remain in the salt.

3. Steady-state conditions were assumed.

The resulting expressions and the parameters employed (which corre-
spond approximately to the present MSBR reference design’3) are summarized
in Table 7.8. The steady-state partial pressure of each cesium nuclide
(Pg) was a function of the depth into the graphite (x), the porosity of
the graphite (e), the partial pressure of the parent xenon at the salt-
graphite interface (P. ), the diffusion coefficients of cesium and xenon
(D, assumed to be the Same for both), and the appropriate decay constants
(\) and neutron capture cross sections (0). The xenon partial pressure
at the salt-graphite interface (P2.) was, in turn, a function of several
terms: Y corresponds to the xenon production rate; S reflects the xenon
loss from the fuel salt by decay, stripping, and burnup; G reflects dif-
fusion of xenon into the graphite; and, finally, ¥ is a factor reflecting
the effect of the film coefficient H at the sali-graphite interface.

Cesium Carbide Formation. The maximum total pressure of cesium (at
the center of the graphite slab) was found to increase as D was decreased
(Fig. 7.12). This is a paradoxical result since it is usually thought
desirable that the graphite possess the lowest possible D values. In the
range of D values tested here, however, the rate-controlling step in the
diffusion of parent xenon into the graphite appeared to be at the salt-
graphite interface (see below) and did not depend significantly upon D.
162

As a result, lowering D for xenon and cesium appreciably decreased only
the diffusion of cesium out of the graphite, causing the steady-state
accumulation of cesium (Fy) to be higher.

Included for comparison in Fig. 7.12 is the partial pressure of
cesium at which carbide formation might be expected at 600°C, based on
an estimate by Manowitz.2* It appears that in all cases tested the cesi
partial pressure in the graphite was high enough to produce carbide for-
mation. As a consequence, it is likely that the actual quantities of
cesium which could accumulate within the graphite will be higher than
estimated in the present calculations. While no detailed calculation of
this effect was attempted, considerable comfort may be found in the fol-
lowing observations.

1. By the present calculations the amount of cesium accumulation in the
graphite 1s very small; even with a xenon partial pressure as high
as 0.01 atm, for example, there would be only 1 atom of cesium present
for every 25,000,000 atoms of carbon. At acceptably low 135%e poison- .
ing levels, the calculated maximum cesium concentration would be ap-
proximately 100-fold (107% atm) lower than this. Thus, although the
present estimates of cesium accumulation would probably be increased -
if carbide formation occurs, an enormous increase (e.g., 10°-fold)
in the accumulation could occur before it would become a matter of
concern.

2. Fven if it were assumed that all the cesium born in the graphite were
to remain there, the rate of accumulation would be low. Thus, under

the most unfavorable conditions tested (H = 0.02 cm/sec, Agp = 0-001

sec”, and D = 107% cm?/sec, which gave a “?°Xe poison factor of 0.9),
the total of all xenon nuclides entered the graphite at a rate

Vv

= Iie w= TE 5 GE = 1.29 x 107tL mole cm™? sect 5

so low that even if it all were to decay to cesium, 150 days would
be required to produce a cesium-to-carbon ratio of 1:1000. With

more realistic calculations and a more realistic calculation of the
accumulation rate — in particular, a calculation which includes the
diffusion of CsC as well as gaseous cesium out of the slab — much

lower accumulation rates undoubtedly would result.

13%%e Poisoning. For most of the values of D and H chosen here,
the rate-determining step was the transfer of xenon across the film at
the salt-graphite interface (i.e., F >> 1 and G/F — AH/V Q) ence

the poison fraction was not very dependent upon D, but rather was deter-
mined almost entirely by the magnitude of H and Aa (Figs. 7.13 and 7.14).

This result, it should be noted, 1s compatible with the assumption of one-
dimensional diffusion in the graphite; that is, if the rate step instead
had beenn in the graphite, such a crude model would have been more question-
able.

Fig. 7.13. Dependence of the Xenon Poison Factor on the Diffusion
Coefficient.

The 139Xe poison factor, as well as the cesium partial pressures,
could of course be reduced either by increasing Ag or decreasing H (Fig.
2

7.14); however, it seems unlikely that in practice the stripping rate
could greatly exceed 0.01 (corresponding to a removal half-time of ap-
proximately 1 min) or that H would normally be kept below 0.01 cm/sec.
Approximately these conditions evidently must he met if the poison factor
is to be held below 0.1 (poison fraction approximately 0.005).

Todine Removal. Removal of iodine (as HI) by HF sparging of the
salts would be an effective way of reducing the 135%e poison fraction,
provided the overall removal rate is large compared with the decay rate
of 371 (2.89 x 107% sec”, t1,2 = 6.7 hr) — and it seems likely that this
could be done.?? The amount of the reduction in the case of 222U fission-
ing could be as much as a factor of 5, limited by the 18 * 3% of the 135%e
being produced directly From fission.

This treatment 1s relatively ineffective in reducing the cesium
partial pressure, however, because the principal contributors to it are
mass numbers 137 and 138, which have short-lived iodine precursors (A =
0.03 and 0.12 sec™ respectively).

Salt Impregnation. Tmpregnation of the graphite to a limited depth
with the fuel salt would be an effective means to reduce the rate of
xenon diffusion into the graphite by virtue of the fact that both the
xenon diffusion coefficient and the xenon concentration would be roughly
four orders of magnitude lower in an interstitial salt phase than in an
interstitial gas phase.

 

This situation can be represented within the framework of the present
calculations by the simple procedure of considering the interpenetration-
salt—graphite barrier as the film to which H refers. Comparison of the
equation which defines H in a normal film,

J =H (c-cd),
165

with the equation which would define the diffusion coefficient in the salt-
graphite barrier,

od

shows that it is reasonable to approximate H for such a barrier by
H~ D/t ,

where t 1g the depth of salt penetration. The effective D for this salt-
graphite barrier should be in the range 1077 to 108 cm?/sec for MSRE-
type graphite (i.e., D for xenon in the molten salt times the porosity/
tortuosity factor). Assuming a penetration depth of 0.1 cm, we can then
place H in the range 107° to 1077, which is at least three orders of
magnitude below the minimum film factor estimated for an MSBR.

The consequences of such a small film coefficient are that diffusion
of xenon into the graphite is no longer significant in determining the
135%e poison factor (i.e., the terms containing F in the expression for
the poison factor beccme negligible). The 135%e poisoning is then deter-
mined only by Agp®

P.F

Summary. The present calculations indicate that cesium carbide for-
mation can be expected to occur in an MSBR, but in such small amounts as
to be of little concern. In addition, these calculations indicate that
in the sbsence of iodine removal, xenon poisoning in a full-scale MSER
will be controlled primarily by a film coefficient H and will be reduced
most effectively either by iodine removal or by some method which in ef-
feet reduces this film coefficient.

Fission Product Behavior in the MSRE — S. S. Kirslis

 

The behavior of fission products in the MSRE is being studied to
derive information bearing on the practical concerns of corrosion and
neutron poisoning. Significant clues to the basic nature of Hastelloy N
corrosion in a fissioning molten-salt environment are provided by obser-
vation of the volatilization and plating behavior of fission products
whose oxidation states are relatively easily changed. The chemical fate
of a number of fission product poisons is important in determining their
contributions to the overall poisoning of a reactor. Thus, for example,
it is of interest to determine what fraction of the *3°Xe produced by
fission in the melt is released to the cover gas before 1t becomes 136%e
by neutron capture. Likewise, it is important to determine whether
noble-metal fission products which are moderate neutron poisons (Mo, Ru,
Te, Nb, Pd, and Rh) remain in the circulating fuel, volatilize, or deposit
166

on graphite or Hastelloy N. The rare-earth fission product poisons, be-
cause of the chemical stability of their nonvolatile fluorides, are ex-
pected to remain in the circulating fuel.

There are unique advantages in carrying out fission product studies
in an operating reactor rather than in small-scale laboratory or in-pile
tests. Tirst, in small-scale tests it is difficult to mock up realisti-
cally the geometry, the fuel circulation conditions, and other possibly
significant factors of the reactor enviromment. Second, although the MSRE
was not primarily designed for the chemist's convenience, several features
make 1t rather well adapted to chemical studies. Most importantly, a
facility exists Tor taking sizable samples of fuel salt from the pump bowl
during reactor operation. In the same facility it is possible to expose
selected metal samples to both the cover gas and the fuel melt in the
pump bowl. Provisions exist for taking samples of the reactor cover gas
and are being improved to permit continuous monitoring and the taking of
concentrated samples. Finally, provisions were made for inserting re-
movable long-term surveillance specimens of Hastelloy N and graphite in
the reactor core of the MSRE. These facilities and advantages are avail-
able only with great difficulty in small-scale in-pile tests. The prin-
cipal lacks from the chemist's viewpoint are facilities for direct sam~
pling of the pump bowl cover gas and for exposing metal and graphite sam-~
ples to -the pump bowl atmosphere and fuel phase for longer periods of
time.

This report on fission product behavior will cover the initial re-~
sults from fuel salt sampling, from the exposure of metal samples to the
pump bowl gas and liquid phases, from the first examination of the long-
term surveillance specimens of graphite and Hastelloy N, and from the
analysis of the first sample of reactor cover gas taken during reactor
operation.

Fuel Salt Samples. Using the pump bowl sampling facility, a large
number of 10- and 50-g fuel salt samples were taken during reactor op-
eration to monitor changes in the concentrations of oxide, bulk fuel
components, and corrosion products. Metal samples were attached to the
10-g sampling assembly for observation of the volatilization and plating
behavior of Tission products during five of the salt samplings. These
five salt samples were delivered to the analytical hot cells within a
few hours of sampling and were rapidly powdered, weighed, dissolved, and
analyzed radiochemically for the 15 isotopes listed in Table 7.9. The
strontium and cerium isotopes were determined as fission monitors, since
these elements have convenient half-lives and stable fluorides which
should remain in the melt. The ruthenium and molybdenum isotopes were
representative of noble metals. The tellurium and iodine isotopes were
of interest for their volatilization and plating properties as precursors
of 3%Xe. The 2390p and 239Py isotopes were measured as indicators of
the epithermal flux in the MSRE.

The data listed in Table 7.9 show that the strontium and cerium
isotopes behaved in a regular and expected manner. The ?lgr ana *43ce
isotopes appear to be the most reliable fission monitors for interrupted
power operation. The average of the four values for Olgy at the nominal

the nominal value. -

For molybdenum and ruthenium isotopes, the concentrations found in
salt samples showed much more scatter, which may well be real. The first
row of data in Table 7.10 shows the averages of the amounts of these
isotopes found compared to the amounts calculated to be formed using
91sr (arbitrarily) as the Fission monitor in each run. The reason for
the impossibly high values for 05Ru is being sought. The 132m values
varied little among the 7.2-Mw runs but represented low fractions of the
total amount formed (Table 7.10). The iodine isotopes showed relatively
little scatter, and the amounts found corresponded well with the amounts
calculated from the °'Sr values.

The epithermal flux in the MSRE has not yet been calculated from
the neptunium and plutonium values in Table 7.9.

Pump Bowl Volatilization and Plating Tests. Advantage was taken of
the experimental possibilities of the pump bowl salt sampling facility
to carry out some qualitative tests to detect the presence of chemically
reactive fission product species in the pump bowl cover gas and to deter-
mine which fission products would plate on clean metal surfaces from the
fuel salt phase.

 
169

The copper fuel salt sampling ladle is attached by a double stain-
less steel cable to a nickel-plated iron latch which fits into a mscha-
nism for lowering and ralsing the assembly in a pipe leading from the
pump bowl to the sampling cubicle above the reactor. To detect the
presence of chemically reactive fission products in the gas phase, coils
of 0.015-in.-diam silver and Hastelloy N wire were wound on the small
stainless steel cables for a distance of 2 in. below the bottom of the
latch. The latch and the wire coils were later leached and analyzed for
gasaous Tisslon products. The lower 2~in. lengths of the stainless steel
cables just above the copper ladle were leached and analyzed similarly
to determine which fission products plated from the fuel melt. Figure
7.15 shows the sampling assembly with wire coils attached. The sampling
device was submerged in the pump bowl for times varying from 1 min to
10 min. It was then raised 2 ft and allowed to cool for 10 min and then
raised to the sampling cubicle. The metal and salt samples were delivered
in a carrier to the hot analytical laboratory, usually within 3 hr of the
sampling time. The salt sample was prepared for analysis by the procedure
summarized above. The stainless steel cables were clipped to provide
separate samples of the latch, the silver coll, the Hastelloy N coil, and
the stainless steel cable exposed to the fuel melt. The metal samples
were leached first with an alkaline mixture of Versene, boric acid, and
citric acid to remove iodine without volatilization. Then they were
leached with a warm mixture of HNO; and HCl until the radioactivity was
less than 1% of the original reading (usually greater than 500 r/hr at

contact). Dilutions of the original leach solutions were sent to the
radiochemical separations group for overall gamma scans and estimations
of several Individual isotopes.

The overall gamma scans showed that the principal activities in the
metal samples exposed to the pump bowl gas phase were 1320¢ ang 1327,
with smaller amounts of *2I and 2%Mo. The **9Ba-*4Cla and 2°7r-9°Wb
peaks, which were prominent in the gamma spectra of fuel salt samples,
were much lower in the metal samples. This indicates that the observed
activities were not due to condensation of fuel salt mist on the metal
specimens. Similarly, the gamma spectra of the submerged stainless steel
samples were quite different from those of fuel salt. Correspondingly,
no adhering particles of fuel salt were visible on any of the metal soeci-~
mens. It was later found (Table 7.10) that the amounts of tellurium,
ruthenium, and molybdenum deposited on the metal samples corresponded to
the amounts in several grams of fuel salt.

The gamma scans indicated that quantitative radiochemical estimations
for 1327e, 1211 and 29Mo would ve useful. In addition, estimations were
made of 1331, 13°97, 1093, 1051, and T9°Ru. The results of these analy-
ses are summarized in Table 7.10. Although the exposure times for the
five runs were 1, 2, 5, 10, and 10 min, there was no corresponding vari-
ation of amounts of the several isotopes deposited from either the gas or
the liguid phases. The scatter of results for a given isotope between
runs wag large, often a factor of 2 and sometimes a factor of 2 or more.
For these reasons, the averaged results given in Table 7.10 are more
easily interpreted than a tabulation of the individual results. As in
the case of some of the salt analyses, the observed scatter is much
greater than the normal error of radiochemical analyses and undoubtedly

represents real large variations in the amounts deposited. The causes
for these variations are as yet unknown.

The results in Table 7.10 reveal a striking degree of volatilization
and plating of molybdenum, ruthenium, and tellurium on clean metal sur-
faces. Large amounts of 89Mo were found on the metal samples in both
the gas phase and fuel phase of the pump bowl. Correspondingly, only
about 60% of the theoretical yield of %9Mo was found in the fuel salt
17

samples. The results for ruthenium were similarly spectacular. The

fractions of the three ruthenium isotopes remaining in the salt decreased
with increasing half-life, suggesting that slow reactions are removing
ruthenium from the melt. In successive runs, the amount of 41-day 103Ry
that deposited on metals steadily decreased from the first run to the last
(although the exposure time of the samples increased from 1 to 10 min), as
if the amount in solution were decreasing with time. This behavior is not
explained.

For '32Te the amount remaining in the melt is also low (30%), and
the corresponding gas- and liquid-phase depositions are high. For 1311,
1331, and 01, most of the element remains in the melt, although high
activities of 132I were observed on the gas-phase specimens. The short-
lived 321 is, however, a daughter of the relatively long-lived 132Te,
which was shown to volatilize readily. Rather less 1331 and 13171 was
found on the metal specimens than of molybdenum, ruthenium, and tellurium.
However, no 1351 at all was detected on the metal specimens. Corre-
spondingly, the tellurium precursor of 1357 nas a half-life of only 0.4
min, while 133me ang *21Te have half-lives of 63 and 24 min. Apparently
very little tellurium can volatilize or plate in 0.4 min. It thus appears
that the volatilization and plating characteristics of iodine are deter-
mined by the behavior of the precursor tellurium.

Tellurium and iodine had been detected in the gas lines of previous
in-pile tests, but the volatilization of molybdenum and ruthenium was
surprising. The only volatile compounds of molybdenum and ruthenium are
those of valence 4 or greater. The plating behavior of tellurium, mo-
lybdenum, and ruthenium also indicates that these elements are present
with valences greater than zero. However, all positively charged ions
of these elements should be reduced to the metallic state by the metallic
chromium in Hastelloy N. These considerations suggest that the Hastelloy
N container vessel and piping of the MSRE may be protected by a layer of
noble-metal fission products, permitting the existence of higher oxida-
tion states in the melt. If it is assumed that 30% of the noble metals
produced by fission in the MSRE operating at 7.2 Mw are deposited on an
estimated metal surface area of 10° cm? it may be calculated that the
metal film would grow at the rate of about 0.3 A/hr. It is thus not un-
likely that all the metal surfaces exposed to fuel in the MSRE are
presently coated with several hundred angstroms of noble metals.

It is not a simple matter, however, to produce adherent pinhole-free
electroplates, so that a plate hundreds of atoms thick might not protect
against the reducing action of the base metal. Furthermore, it has been
calculated on a very reasonable basis that approximately 1% of the uranium
in the fuel in the MSRE should exist in the trivalent condition. Noble-
metal lon concentrations should be infinitesimal in the presence of this
concentration of the strongly reducing U3*. These very basic puzzles in
elucidating noble-metal fission product behavior in the MSRE have not yet
been solved.

Future pump bowl experiments will involve looking at the behavior of
several more elements (noble metals, other cations with volatile fluorides,
neutron-activated Hastelloy N corrosion products, etc.) and attempts to
172

take small samples of the pump bowl cover gas. The determination of the
reducing power of the fuel salt would also be helpful in explaining fis-
sion nroduct behavior.

Examination of the Graphite Surveillance Specimens. A package cof
MSRE graphite and Hastelloy N surveillance specimens has been exposed to
a fissioning molten-salt environment along the central axis of the MSRE
for 7800 Mwhr of power operation. After the reactor shutdown of July 17,
1966, the package was removed from the reactor and disassembled in a hot
cell. Rectangular bars of graphite, 5 to 9 in. long, 0.66 in. wide, and
0.47 in. thick, from the bottom (inlet), middle, and top (outlet) of the
reactor core were made available for detailed examination. The surveil-
lance specimens were contained in a perforated cylindrical tube of
Hastelloy N, 5-1/2 ft long, 2 in. in diameter, and 0.030 in. thick. Rings
of this tube approximately 11/16 in. in height and 10 g in weight were
sawed out of the bottom, middle, and top regions of the tube to provide
Hastelloy N specimens for fission product deposition studies.

 

The graphite bars were first sectioned transversely with a thin
Carborundum saw to provide specimens for photographic, metallographic,
autoradiographic, x-radiographic, and surface x-ray examination. Speci-
mens were saved for other possible tests (spark spectroscopy or electron
probe). The remainders of the bars, 7 in. long for the middle specimen,
2-5/8 in. long for the bottom sample, and 2-7/8 in. long for the top sam-
ple, were used for milling off successive surface layers for fission
product deposition studies.

(a) Visual, Autoradiographic, and X-Radiographic Examinations. The
graphite specimens showed no visible signs of corrosion or chemical
change. No metallic or salt films were discernible under low-power mag-
nification, which revealed the original machining grooves on the graphite.
The middle sample (Y-2) was known to have a crack near one end before in-
sertion into the reactor. The crack was still visible after removal but
had not propagated further. Some of the graphite specimens in one region
of the package had cracked due to mechanical stresses caused by the un-
even thermal expansion and contraction of the tightly packed Hastelloy N
and graphite specimens. A small piece of the bottom sample (VA-1) had
cracked off during the disassembly of the package. These cracks should
not reflect on the overall integrity of the irradiated graphite speci-
mens. Prints of an autoradiograph and an x radiograph of each of the
three graphite specimens are shown in Figs. 7.16 to 7.18. The x radio-
graphs were taken on thin (0.020- to 0.060-in.) transverse slices of the
graphite bars. The autoradiographs were taken on adjacent transverse
slices after mounting in epoxy resin and polishing for metallographic
examination.

The x radiographs show no general deposition of fuel salt nor of
heavy elements on the surface of the graphite. A hint of penetration or
deposition is visible near one corner each of the bottom and top graphite
samples. The crack in the middle sample is clearly penetrated by fuel
salt. The edge of the cracked bottom sample shows no foreign material,
indicating that the crack occurred after removal from the reactor.

(v-2).

The autoradiographs indicate a thin film of highly radioactive ma-
terial on the exposed surfaces of the graphite and confirm the presence
of salt in the crack of the middle specimen. These pictures also show
that the penetration of the radioactive material into the interior of the
graphite is by no means uniform. The nonuniform nature of the porosity
of graphite has been demonstrated in gas permeability tests.

The observations described here are generally in accord with those
from previous in-pile tests. The graphite is not visibly affected, and
there are no signs of chemical attack, film formation, or salt penetration.

(b) Metallographic Examination. Metallographs of transverse sections
of the three graphite bars are shown in Figs. 7.19 to 7.21. The structure
of the graphite in all cases appeared normal and undamaged under both
bright-field and polarized-light illumination. No metallic, carbide, or
sall fllms were visible on the surfaces of the specimens. No sign of salt
penetration was observed except in the case of the cracked middle speci-
men. Here volds were observed which probably had been filled with salt
before polishing with a water suspension of the polishing compound. The
other graphite specimens were polished under CCl, to avoid dissolution of
fuel salt.

A fuel-salt-exposed surface of the middle graphite bar was mounted
for hot-cell x-ray examination of the surface for metallic films or other
contamination. Only graphite lines were observed. Because of the nega-
tive result of this test, the other graphite specimens were not examined
by the x-ray technique.

(¢) Milling of Surface layers of Graphite. The valuable contribu-
tions of J. G. Morgan, M. F. Osborne, and H. E. Robertson in planning,
developing hot-cell methods for, and starting the work on the sampling of
the graphite specimens are gratefully acknowledged. A very ingenious
"planer" was designed and built by the Hot Cells Operation Group for mill-
ing thin layers from the four long surfaces of each of the graphite bars.
The cutter and the collection system were so designed that a large fraction
of the graphite dust removed was collected. By comparing the collected
weights of the graphite samples with the weight loss calculated from the
initial and final dimensions of the graphite bars and their known den-
sities, the average sampling losses were 4.5% for the middle bar, 18.9%
for the top bar, and 9.1% for the bottom bar.

 

The patterns of sampling of the graphite surface layers are shown in
Fig. 7.22. An identifying groove was cut along the length of the middle
of the graphite surface which was pressed against another graphite sur-
face in the original surveillance package. The other three surfaces were
exposed to circulating fuel salt. The numbers of the layers in Fig. 7.22
indicate the order in which the layers were cut from the graphite bars.
After each layer was cut from a bar, the milling apparatus and the bar
were vacuumed to avoid cross contamination of samples. Each powdered
graphite sample was placed in a small capped plastic bottle and weighed.
The middle bar was measured with a micrometer to determine the depth of
each cut. This time-consuming operation was omitted for the other two
bars, since it became evident that the depth of cut could be more
accurately calculated from the weight of the sample removed. The average
depth of cut was 0.0075 in. for the middle bar and 0.011 in. for the
other two bars. A clean unirradiated MSRE graphite specimen was sampled
with the milling device in the standard manner after the ninth cut and
after the last cut on the middle graphite bar to provide comparison sam-
ples to indicate the level of cross contamination in the hot-cell milling
operation. As seen in Fig. 7.22, the salt-exposed surfaces of the middle
bar were sampled to a depth of six or seven layers, or about 0.050 in.
The surfaces in contact with graphite were more thoroughly sampled in the
other bars.

(d) Fission Product Analyses in Graphite Samples. The powdered
graphite samples were delivered to the Radlochemical Separations Group,
and weighed portions were dissolved in a hot mixture of HNO; and HyS04.
The gases evolved were passed through a condenser, a charcoal trap, and
an alkaline solution to recover any volatilized iodine or ruthenium.
Aliquots of these solutions were analyzed radiochemically for the isotopes
listed in Table 7.11. The first milled sample of each graphite surface
was also analyzed for uranium by the fluorometric method. No uranium was
detected with a sensitivity limit of about 30 pg of uranium per square
centimeter of graphite surface. This finding will be confirmed by more
sensitive neutron activation methcds.

BOTTOM GRAPHITE

 

Fig. 7.22. Scheme for Milling Graphite Samples.

The radiochemical data so far reported are given in Tables 7.11 to
7.13 for the middle, top, and bottom graphite bars respectively. The
data are generally internally consistent for a glven bar, and the agree-
ment between bars is good. Very few individual values are out of line,
which is to the credit of those involved in the sampling and in the anal-
ysis of the samples.

From the neutron poison standpoint, the results of most interest are
those for ?°Mo, 103Ru, and ’Nb. It is seen in Tables 7.12 to 7.13 that
the concentrations of these isotopes are considerable in the first layer
and that the activities fall off by a factor of about 100 in the second
layer. Tellurium-132, which is also noble in the sense of possessing
fluorides of only moderate stability, behaves rather similarly, but its
concentration drops off less rapidly with penetration distance. Beyond
a penetration depth of about four cuts, the activities of molybdenum,
180

ruthenium, and niobium approach the contamination background (samples 10
and 24 in Table 7.11), while that of 132me is distinctly higher. It is
presently thought that the deposition of molybdenum, ruthenium, and proba-
bly niobium in ‘the graphite may be due to the reaction of volatile hexa-
fluorides or pentafluorides with graphite, depositing lower fluorides or
carbides. There is no chemical reason to expect the lower fluorides of
molybdenum or ruthenium to plate on graphite. On the other hand, the
pump bowl experiments definitely established the volatility of molybdenum
and ruthenium, probably in the forms of MoFg and RuFs.

The behavior of 140pa, 89g, 4loe, L4doe, and 1370s, all of which
have xenon or krypton precursors, is distinctly different. The gradient
of activity with penetration distance is much less, and it appears to bear
a relationship to the half-life of the rare~gas precursor involved. Thus
the gradient for 14084 with a 1l6-sec 40Xe precursor is much steeper than
that for 89g, which has a 3.2-min 8%Kr precursor. Apparently, the
longer-half-life rare gases can achieve a flatter gradient by diffusion
before they decay to the observed isotope, which is assumed to remain
where deposited. The penetration data for “%%Ba and 89Sr fitted well a
simple diffusion model which led to xenon and krypton diffusion coeffi-
cients of about 1 x 1077 ££? /hr in MSRE graphite. To explain why 370s,
which has a 3.8-min *37Xe precursor, has a much flatter profile than 895r
in Table 7.11, it may further be postulated that '37Cs itself diffuses,
rather than remaining where it was born. The internal +3705 concentration
of 2 x 107 dis min™* gt, or about 1 atom of *37Cs per 108 atoms of graph-
ite, should have negligible chemical effect on the integrity of the graph-
ite structure. Only a few values have yet been obtained for ?%7r. This
element 1s expected to remain in the fuel salt, with little tendency to
volatilize or plate. Thus the amount found in the graphite should repre-
sent only injection by fission recoil. Correspondingly, the amount in
the graphite is low compared to the noble metals.

The concentration of '?'I in the graphite is also low at the surface,
and its gradient is similar to that of *3?Te. It is possible that the
24-min 2? Te diffused into the graphite as Tel or TeF, and then decayed
to *311, However, it is difficult to see why the iodine did not diffuse
pack out of the graphite, unless it formed a nonvolatile compound with
other fission product atoms in the graphite. While it is nol possible at
this time to account satisfactorily for the fact that the iodine concen-
trations in graphite are low, the implication of the low 1317 concentra-
tions is that the 3°I concentrations will be similarly low. Thus little
135%e will be born in graphite due to the previous immigration of 1351,

Since the depths of cut of the many graphite samples were not the
same, especially for different bars, it is not easy to compare the amounts
of the various isotopes in the first layer from the data in Tables 7.11
to 7.13. ©Since, also, the main practical interest is in the noble-metal
fission products, the bulk of which were deposited in the first layer,
Table 7.14 was prepared, giving the amount of each isotope in the first
layer in disintegrations per minute per square centimeter of graphite
surface. The values in Table 7.14 were obtained by multiplying the values
in Tables 7.11 to 7.13 (disintegrations per minute per gram) by the weight
of sample analyzed (corrected for weight loss in sampling) and dividing
by the measured area of the surface from which the sample was cut. The

deta were condensed by averaging the usually well-agreeing amounts found
on the three salt-exposed surfaces. The amounts found on the other
graphite-contacting surfaces were, on the average, 38% lower. The latter
figure indicates rather free circulation of salt between the contacting
graphite surfaces, Salt may be expected to circulate equally well in the
interstices between the graphite stringers of the MSRE.

It is seen from Table 7.14 that the amounts of noble metals in the
top, middle, and bottom samples of the graphite agree rather well, with
perhaps usually somewhat larger values for the middle graphite. For the
other isotopes, also, the middle graphite usually holds the highest sur-
face concentrations, though seldom in the ratio of the prevailing neutron
fluxes. The last row in Table 7.14 gives the 6000 activities in the
Hastelloy N samples adjacent to the three graphite samples. These numbers
are proportional to the thermal-neutron fluxes. The latter have not yet
been calculated since the chemical cobalt analyses have not yet been re-
celved.

Algo listed in Table 7.14 are the percentages of the total isotope
produced by Tission found on the graphite surface, on the assumption that
all 2 x 10° em? of graphite held the surface concentrations listed to
their left in the table. The total amount of each isotope was calculatad
for a fission rate based on the gr activity (1.32 x 10% dis mint gmt
in the last salt sample taken on July 13, 1966. The percentages in Table
7.14 would be about 20% lower if the nominal power history of the reactor
were used to calculate the total amount of each isotope produced by fis-
sion. It should be recognized that the percentages glven actually repre-
sent the behavior of each isotope only during a few half-lives of that
isotope. Thus the figures for 66-hr Y9Mo characterize only a period of a
week or so before the July 17, 1966, shutdown. It is quite conceivable
that the deposition behavior of the various isotopes is changing with
time. Several sets of surveillance specimens must be examined before Firm
conclusions may be drawn.

Slzable percentages of the total ?%Mo, 1327e, 103Ry, and 2°Nb were
found on the graphite surfaces. Many of the values were close tO 13%, but
two of the 2°Nb values were near 60%. Much lower percentages of the other
isotopes deposited on the graphite, the highest being 3.2% for 89gr and
1.8% for *4Upa.

An attempt was made To snalyze two of the surface graphite samples
Tor all fission product isotopes of molybdenum by mass spectrometry, after
spiking the samples with ?2Mo or ?®Mo. The results indicated somewhat
more molybdenum deposition (20 and 32% of the total) than was measured
radiochemically with ?7Mo. However, confidence in these results was
lessened by the fact that distinctly different combinations of fission
product molybdenum, natural molybdenum, and natural zirconium (used as a
carrier) had to be used to Tit the mass analyses of the two samples.

(e) Fission Product Deposition on Hastelloy N. It is interesbting
to compare the deposition of fission products on graphite with that on
the adjacent Hastelloy N. The samples of the perforated Hastelloy N cb-
tained as described above were weighed and dissolved in a warm mixture of
HNO3 and HCl. From the known dimensions and density of Hastelloy WN, it
was calculated that the surface-to-weight ratio of the perforated metal

gt) could be converted to dis min~t em™?, Table 7.15 gives the radio-
chemical results obtained to date {rom the solutions of the Hastelloy N
specimens. It is seen that large percentages of the total ?%Mo, 132me
and *02Ru deposited on the Hastelloy N. Also given in Table 7.15 are

the ratios of the surface concentrations of each isotope on the Hastelloy
N and on the graphite. Between 3 and 14 times as much molybdenum,
tellurium, and ruthenium deposited on metal as on graphite. It is in-
teresting that a falr material balance ig obtained for 29Mo by adding the
percentages of the total produced found in the salt (approximately 60%,
Table 7.10), in the graphite (approximately 14%, Table 7.14), and on the
Hastelloy N (approximately 45%, Table 7.15). The agreement for the other
isotopes is not so good.

Much lower percentages of the total 1317 deposit on the Hastelloy N,
but the amount compared to that on graphite is high. The data suggest
that the precursor tellurium deposits on the metal and that not all of
the 131T is able to leave when the tellurium decays. The amount of 957
on the metal was low, but higher than the surface concentration on graph-
ite. Very little 14ie and Thee were found on the metal, in fact, less
than on graphite. The finding of more cerium isotopes in graphite may be
due to their short-lived xenon precursors.

General Discussion of the Deposition Results. The principal practical
interest in the fission product deposition results lies in their implica-
tions regarding neutron poisoning by noble metals in the graphite cores
of molten-salt reactors. In most studlez of the physics of reactors such
as the M3BR, it has been assumed that the ncoble-metal fission products
would either plate out instantaneously on metal surfaces or be removed
periodically from the fluoride fuel by the fluoride volatility processing.
Under these conditions, the poisoning effect of noble metals would ve of
minor practical concern. However, it has been calculated®® that if all
of the elements Be, Br, Nb, Mo, Tc, Te, and I remained in the core of the

- MSBR, the neutron poison fraction (capture by these elements per gbsorption
in fissile material) would be 0.0969 in two years, 0.1652 in five years,
0.2104 in ten years, and 0.2585 at equilibrium. If 10% of these materials
remained in the core, the respective poison fractions would be 0.0106,
0.0172, 0.0226, and 0.0275, If this group of elements remained in the
fuel and was periodically removed by fluoride volatility processing, the
average poison fraction would remain constant at 0.0015. The isotopes of
molybdenum and 297: secount for about 90% of the poisoning effect of this
group of elements. The nuclear breeding ratio for the MSBR is expected
to be 1.05 to 1.07 in the absence of deposits of noble metals in the core.
The numbers above indicate that the actual breeding ratio or the time
that the graphite can be left in the core of a breeder can be considerably
influenced by the deposition of this group of elements.

 

It was also reported above that five to six times more 2%9Mo was de-
posited on Hastelloy N surfaces than on adjacent graphite surfaces. In
the MSRE there is approximately 2 xX U ® em? of graphite surface (about
half in the fuel channels and half in the flats pressing against adjacent
flats) and 1.2 X 10% cm? of Hastelloy N surface exposed to the circulating
fuel. In the current MSBR design the ratio of metal surface to graphite
188

 

surface exposed to circulating fuel is about =. It scems likely that the
fraction of molybdenur depcsited on the graphite in the MSBR core would
be correspondingly lower than in the MSRE. The ratio of metal to graphite
surface area could be further increased, but at the experse of fuel in-
ventory, by circulating the fuel through a chamber packed with finely
divided metal.

Another approach to the problem of molybdenum deposition in graphite
is suggested by considerations of the probable chemistry involved. The
volatility of 2940 demonstrated in the pump bowl tests suggests the
presence of Mof'y or MoFs in the circulating fuel. The gaseous form of
molybdenum would explain its observed penetration Lo appreciable depts
into the graphite surface. On the basis of available thermochemical in-
Formation, it is not clear what chemical reaction occurs to fix the
molybdenum to the graphite. For example, the free energies of the reac-
tions of Mol'y with graphite to form CF, and molybdenum or MoC, are posi-
tive by a few kilocalories. The same 1s true for Ruls and NbFs. Only in
the case of tellurium 1s there a definitely negative free-energy change
for the reaction of the fluoride with graphite. Possible chemical ex-
planations of the observed depositions are the formation of stable mixed
alloys of the noble-metal fission products or the reactions of the fluo-
rides with reducing impurities present in the graphite. In any case,
these reactions take place inside the gravhite pores near the surface.
The penetration of volatile molybdenum could be decreased by making the
graphite surface less permeable. It is hoped that graphite specimens
whose surfaces have been made less permeable by impregnation treatments
can be included in futurc surveillance specimen packages to test whether
molybdenum deposition in graphite can be decreased in this way.

IT the deposition of noble-metal fission proaucts in grapnite does
indeed require thelr prior conversion to high-valent fluorides, a third
method of deposition control suggests itself: <The fuel melt may be made
more reducing by increasing the Ut just ratio. Existing thermochemical
data indicate that a sizable percentage of the tetravalent uranium could
be converted to the UST state without causing uranium carbide formation.
A small percentage of the uranium could be made trivalent by adding a few
percent of Hp to the helium cover gas of a reactor. Alternatively, when
fresh fuel is added to compensate for burnup, the added uranium could be
partly trivalent. One or both of these procedures may be feasible in the
MSRE. The effects on volatilization and plating behavior could be easily
observed by pump bowl tests with metal and graphite specimens.

The second major area in which illumination is desired from fission
product behavior is Hastelloy N corrosion. As indicated above, 1t is
difficult to reconcile all the observations with a single consistent
chemical picture. The principal difficulty is that the high-valent forms
of molybdenum, ruthenium, and tellurium indicated by their volatility and
plating behavior may not exist in equilibrium with the appreciable con-
centrations of U2" estimated to be present in the MSRE fuel salt. The
oxidizing effect of burning up about 400 g of 2?°U to date is equivalent
to only one-tenth of the uit originally present in the fuel.

If it is assumed that the U’T concentration was actually much lower
than estimated, the presence of high-valent noble metals in the fuel im-
plies that the Hastelloy N surfaces have been protectively plated with
189

noble metals. Experimental observations of such platings were reported
apove. This protection would explain the observed low corrosion rate of
Hastelloy N as indicated by chromium analyses of the fuel. However, the
absence of iodine volatilization is then difficult to explain. In the
presence of MoFg, RuFs, and TeFg, it is expected that icdides would be
oxidized to Is. It is not expected that the solubility of I, in the fuel
is high encugh to prevent its volatilization.

These problems of consistency make it clear that the nature of
Hastelloy N corrosion reactions in an operating reactor is not under-
stood as well as would be desirable. Of great help in solving some of
these problems would be the development of a method to measure the Ut
concentration in radioactive fuel salt samples.

MSRE Cover-Gas Analyses. Samples of MSRE cover gas were isolated
on June 23, 1966, during steady 7.2-Mw operation in the three shielded
gas-sampling bombs provided for this purpose. The three samples (500,
500, and 1500 em?) represented pump bowl cover gas which had passed
through the first holdup volume (68 ft of 4-in. stainless steel pipe),
the particle trap, and the charcoal filter. The latter should have re-
moved all heavy hydrocarbons and other impurities more easily adsorbed
than xenon.

 

The gas analysis of prime interest was_ that for the 136xe [134%e
ratio, from which the fractional burnup of 135%e in the MSRE could be
determined. To obtain high-sensitivity mass spectrometric analyses for
136%e and 134%e, it was necessary to concentrate the sampled gas by a
factor of at least 50. The concentration was accomplished by adsorbing
the impurities in a helium cover-gas sample on a small volume of molecular
sieve sorbent at liquid-nitrogen temperature, then warming the sorbent to
500°F, and flushing the liberated impurities with helium into a small (20-
em?) sample bottle. In this way, one 500-cm? sample was concentrated by
a factor of 25 and the 1500-cm?® sample by a factor of 75. At the same
time small unconcentrated samples of the cover gas were taken for gamma
spectrometry (1 em?) and for mass spectrometry (2 cm?) to detect impuri-
ties such as HzO which are not readily liberated from the warmed molecular
sieve sorbent. The latter sample also provided more reliable analyses for
very low-boiling impurities like Hp, which would not be completely sorbed
by the molecular sieve.

After cooling for more than two months, the radicactivity of the gas
samples was low, and no activity problems were encountered in the direct
sampling and concentration procedures. The activity in the gamma spectro-
metric sample, taken in a thin-walled l-em® glass bulb, was preponderantly
5.27-day 133%e. The observed counting rate indicated a concentration of
about 7 ppm of 133% in the cover gas at the time of sampling. Minute
traces were also detected of a 0.16-Mev activity which might be 12-day
123s and of a 0.5-Mev activity which might ve 10.3-year 85x, 40-day
103ry, or 1.0-year 106g.

The results of the mass analyses of the unconcentrated sample, the
concentrated 500-cm® sample, and the concentrated 1500-cm® sample are
shown in Table 7.16. From the ratio of the analyses for 136%e ang 134xe
for the concentrated 500-cm’ sample, it was calculated that 7.7% of the
190

135%e produced in the fuel melt captured neutrons to become *36Xe. The
corresponding more accurate result from the 1500-cm? sample was 7.9% 135%e
burnup, with a standard deviation of about 0.5% calculated from the esti-
mated analytical accuracy. It should be emphasized that this method of

. so. 135 pm p op : : .
determining Xe burnup is not affected by sample contamination or by
the exact value of the concentration factor, provided the concentrated

sample contains sufficient xenon for a good measurement of isotoplc ratios.
The low *35Xe burnup values are consistent with indications from MSRE re-
activity measurements and are much lower than values predicted theoreti-
cally for the case of no helium bubbles circulating with the fuel salt
through the MSRE core. Recent measurements indicated an appreclable
bubble volume fraction in the circulating fuel.

From Table 7.16 it is seen that the observed fractions of Xe ana
132%e were much lower than the fractions calculated from the fission
yields. In the case of Y?1Xe, this is well accounted for by the fact that
the precursor 8.05-day 1311 had not yet reached its equilibrium concentra-
tion when the sample was taken. For 132%e, the observed value was some-
what lower than is indicated by a similar explanation involving the 77-hr
132me precursor. The observed krypton isotopic percentages matched closely
those calculated from fission yields (Table 7.16). The observed ratios of
total xenon to total krypton were lower than the theoretical 5.7, proba-
bly because of the xenon precursor effects mentioned above. It may be
noted that the total xenon and total krypton concentrations were a factor
of nearly 5 higher for the 1500-cm® sample than for the 500-cm? sample,
whereas a factor of 3 was expected.

The concentrations of 211 impurities in the three analyzed samples
should have been in the ratios of their respective concentration factors.
This was generally not true. Except for total xenon and total krypton,
the impurity concentration in the 500~-cm? sample was conslderably more
than the expected one-third of the 1500-cm? sample concentration. Most
analyses for impurities are therefore uncertain by a factor of 2 or more.

The analyses for air (N,, Op, and Ar) were higher than expected for
the thoroughly leak-checked sampling and concentration system. A pure
helium sample is being concentrated in the system to provide a quantitative
plank for the air values.

The analyses indicate more than 60 ppm of Hp and CO, and more than 30
ppm of CH, in the MSRE off-gas. Presumably, these gases were generated
from the thermal and radiolytic decomposition of the organic materials
which caused plugging in the off-gas system. The low concentrations of
higher hydrocarbons indicate that the particle trap and charcoal filter
were still effective on June 23, 1966.

ratory and installed therein. Since installation, one coolant salt and

eight fuel samples have been analyzed for oxide. The 50-g fuel salt sam-
ples were taken at levels from zero- to full-power reactor operations.
With an in-cell radiation monitor, the initial sample read 30 r at 1 ft.
This activity increased to 1000 r at 1 ft at the full-power level. Re-
sults of the oxide analyses are given in Table 7.17.

The oxide in the coolant salt sample, 25 ppm, 1s comparable to a
value of 38 ppm obtained for a coolant salt sample taken on January 25,
1966, and analyzed in the laboratory after three weeks! storage. The fuel
analyses are in reasonable agreement with the samples analyzed on the
bench top before the reactor was operated at power. The oxide in these
nonradioactive samples gradually decreased from 106 to 65 ppm. Between
the FP-6 and FP-7 series the sampler-enricher station was opened for
maintenance, and the apparent increase in oxide concentration (ca. 15 ppm)
may represent contamination of the samples by residual moisture in the
sampling system; however, the number of determinations has not been suf-
ficient to establish the precision of the method at these low concentra-
Lion levels.

In an attempt to determine whether radiolytic fluorine is removing
oxide from the fuel samples, sample FP-7-9 was removed from the transport
container and stored in a desiccator for 24 hr prior to analysis. Since
the oxide content, 59 ppm, is comparable to that of the remaining samples
for which analyses were started 6 to 10 hr after sampling, no significant
loss of oxygen 1s indicated. A more direct method of establishing the
validity of these results by measuring the recovery of a standard addition
of oxide will be attempted when reactor operations are resumed.

A method for verifying the performance of the capillary gas stream
splitter and the water electrolysis cell in the remote oxide apparatus
was developed. A tin capsule containing a known amount of SnO, is heated
to 550°C in the hydrofluorinator as hydrogen is passed through the system.
*e

193

The SnO, is reduced to the metal, and the water formed passes on to the
electrolysis cell. Two standard samples of SnO; were analyzed with a
four-month interim, and oxide recoveries of 96.1% and 95.6% were obtained.

It is probable that this slight negative bias is due to momentary
interruptions in the flow of the hydrofluorinator effluent gas through
the water electrolysis cell. Difficulty with cell plugging was en-
countered throughout the period of development of the oxide method. As
an attempt to eliminate the negative bias and also to provide a replace-
ment cell for the remote oxide apparatus, 1t was deemed necessary to find
a method of regenerating the electrolysis cell which would permit a
steady gas flow at relatively low flow rates.

The water electrolysis cell contains partially hydrated P,05 in the
form of a thin viscous film in contact with two spirally wound 5-mil
rhodium electrode wires. The wires are retained on the inside of an
inert plastic tube forming a 20-mil capillary through which the sample
passes. The 2-ft-long tubing element is coiled in a helix inside of a
5/8-in.-diam pipe and potted in plastic for permanence.

During the course of the investigation of the cell, 1t was found
that a wet gas stream in itself did not cause the electrolysis cell to
plug. It was also necessary for current to be flowing through the cell
for flow interruptions to cccur. This indicated that the hydrogen and
oxygen evolving from the electrodes create bubbles in the partially
hydrated P;0s film, which then grow in size sufficient to bridge the
capillary and form an obstructing film.

After many unsuccessful approaches, an acceptable answer to the
problem was obtained by means of a special regenerating technique using
dilute acetone solutions of H3PO, as the regenerating solutions. This
provides a desiccant coating sufficient to absorb the water in the gas
stream and gives a minimal amount of flow interruptions during electrol-
ysis. The cells which have been successfully regenerated in this manner
have yielded oxide recoveries of 99.6 # 1.3% from standard SrO, samples.

Spectrophotometric Studies of Molten-5alt Reactor Fuels — J. P. Young

 

Studies pertaining to a continuous spectrophotometric determination
of U(III) in circulating MSBR fuels have continued. A general description
of the optical design of a facility for performing this determination has
been discussed.’® The facility will be used in conjunction with a com-
mercial instrument, a Cary model 14H recording spectrophotometer. During
this period further and more detailed discussions of the optical problems
involved have been carried out with the designer of this spectrophotometer
and have culminated in a purchase order issued to them for the development
of suitable sample-space optics. The apparatus which will result from
this requisition is to be delivered in six months and will provide optimum
light gathering power and optical design for use with a double convex
lens~shaped drop of liquid. The apparatus will be used with existing in-
strumentation and will be compatible with the optical path extension which
will be required in the final proposed reactor installation.
194

More detailed studies of the spectra of U(ITI) in molten 2I4F Bef,
have provided better resolution of the various absorptions in the complex
ultraviolet absorption peaks of U(ITII). As reported before, the maximum
absorption is 360 nm, but shoulders are observed at approximately 310,
445, and 508 nm. These shoulders might be of analytical value if as yet
unknown interferences prevent the use of the absorption at 360 nm.

On the basis of calculations made to estimate the probable valence
state of fission products, it is expected that dissolved fission products
will be in one of thelr more normal valence states and therefore will
cause no interference at the concentrations expected. Concerning unusual
oxidation states of rare-earth fission products, cursory spectral studies
have been carried out with Sm(II) in molten 2LiF:BeF,. This lower valence
state of samarium exhibits a strong, broad absorption peak with a maximum
absorption at 325 nm with a shoulder at approximately 470 na. The molar
absorptivity is not yet known, but it is believed to be greater than 200.
If conditions are such that Sm(II) is present, possible interference with
a determination of U(III) at 360 nm may be encountered, depending on con-
centrations present. Interference of lower-valent rare earths will not
be a general problem, but only a problem with specific ions; for example,
Fu (IT) exhibits no absorbance at wavelengths above 300 nm.

Although it has been assumed from other spectral studies, mainly in
the solvent LiF-NaF-KF, that corrosion product jlons would not interfere
with the proposed determination, experimental verification has not been
available until this period. The molar absorptivity of Fe(II), Cr(II),
and Ni(II) at their wavelengths of maximum absorbance is 5 at 1020 nm,

& at 760 nm, and 10 at 432 nm respectively. None of these dissolved
species will interfere at concentration levels of 10 to 100 times that
expected in the fuel salt. In general, the spectra of these 3d ions can
be interpreted as arising from essentially octahedral coordination in

the case of Ni(II) and Cr(IT) and distorted octahedral symmetry in the
case of Fe(II). A cursory spectral study of Cr(III) was made. The molar
absorptivity at its wavelength of maximum absorbance, 706 nm, is approxi-
mately 7; Cr(III) is not expected to be present in the fuel salt.

In a study of the absorption spectrum of Fe(II) in several different
IiF-Bel', solutions, an extranecus peak was noted at 432 nm. The position
of the peak suggested an Ni(II) impurity in the melt. Based on a subse-
quent spectral study of Ni(II) spectra in these melts, a molten-salt
spectrophotometric analysis of Ni(II) concentration was possible. The
comparison of this determination to wet chemical analysis of the same
samples 1s given below.

These melts were made in graphite containers but were stirred with
a nickel stirrer. It would seem that this high nickel contamination,
found originally by the molten-salt spectra, may have arisen from the
stirrer.

An extremely sensitive absorption peak attributed to U(IV) which
causes total absorption of most ultraviolet light has been found at 235
nm. The molar absorptivity of this peak is approximately 1500. The peak
has been observed in aqueous absorption spectra at 207 nm, 3? but has not
been reported previously in any molten-salt solvent. A possible analyt-
ical application of this absorption would be a continuous spectrophoto-
metric monitoring of coolant salt for leakage of uranium-bearing fuel
salt.

Voltammetric and Chronopotentiometric Studies of Uranium in Molten LilF-

 

Bef,-Zrl, — D. L. Manning and Gleb Mamantov*

Electrochemical reduction and oxidation of U(IV) in IiF-BeF,-ZrF,
(64-34-1.8 and 65.6-29.4-5.0 mole %) was investigated by rapid-scan
voltammetry and chronopotenticmetry. Well-defined and reproducible
current-voltage curves and potential-time curves were obtained at concen-
trations of uranium as high as 0.8 mole $ (MSRE fuel). From the data
obtained so far, the results are very encouraging from the standpoint of
utilizing the voltammetric approach as a means for in-line monitoring of
uranium in molten fluoride systems of interest to the molten-salt reactor
program. Utilizing a platinum indicator electrode, the relative standard
deviation of peak current for 41 runs over a period of 36 days was 2.0%;
considerably better precision (standard deviation 0.76% for 8 runs) was
obtained over a period of 2 hr. Other indicator electrodes tested in-
cluded pyrolytic graphite, molybdenum, tungsten, and tantalum. Of the
electrodes tested, better reproducibility was obtained at platinum or
platimm=10% rhodium.

At 500°C the reduction of U(IV) at platinum is a reversible one-
electron process, as determined from Nernstian log plots and the diag-
nostic criteria of linear sweep voltammetry. Also from chronopoten-
tiometry, a plot of the current-density—transition-time product (igT) vs
(transition time)t/? yielded a straight line, which is in agreement with
theory for a reversible electrode process. From the slope of the line,
the diffusion coefficient for uranium was calculated to be about 1.5 X
1076 em? [sec in good agreement with the value obtained by voltammetry
(1.5 to 2.0 x 10° cm? /sec). The effect of temperature on the diffusion
coefficient was determined over the range 480 to 600°C; and from a plot
of log D vs 1/T the activation energy which corresponds to the reduction
of U(IV) to U(III) was found to be approximately 11 kcal/mole.

Additional data are being collected to evaluate further the precision
and reproducibility of the voltammetric measurements at different levels

of uranium concentrations, from which it is hoped to obtain a better
assessment of this approach as an analytical method for in-line deter-
mination of U(IV) in molten fluorides.

A new voltammeter is being built that will measure a 20-fold higher
current (100 ma) than existing equipment, so that electrodes with more
reproducible area can be used. With present equipment the electrode is
limited to a 20-gage platinum wire inserted only 5 mm into the fuel, so
that slight changes in melt level introduce a significant change in re-
duction current. The new instrument will also provide a more rapid
voltage scan, up to 500 v/sec, to minimize flow effects in an in-line
cell.

In-Line Test Facility — R. F. Apple, J. M. Dale, J. P. Young, and A. S.
Meyer

 

In view of the value and potential success of methods for the con-
tinuous analysis of circulating salt streams, a facllity to provide salt
streams of known composition is being considered to provide a test of
equipment under simulated in-line measurements. The most practical
facility commensurate with the available space in a California hood con-
sists of a 20-kg salt reservoir fitted with a stirrer, ports for sampling
and for the addition of solid and molten constituents, purge streams and
electrodes for purification, and a helium gas 1ift to continucusly transfer
a gtream of salt to an elevated constant-level vessel. From the constant-
level vessel, salt streams can be gravity-fed to apparatuses for testing
electrometric and spectrophotometric techniques of analysis and for deter-
mining parameters for the continuous determination of oxide by counter-
current eguilibration of a salt stream with anhydrous hydrogen fluoride.
The analyzed salt streams will then be returned to the reservoir. This
facility will also be used to test capillary and orifice techniques for
the control of low salt flows and to design small freeze valves. Tests
of various gas lift designs are being carried out with simulated molten
fuel (aqueous zine chloride solutions) to determine whether a 6- to 8-ft
lift is practical.

Analysis of Helium Blanket Gas — C. M. Boyd, C. A. Horton, A. D. Horton,
and A. 8S. Meyer

 

The Analytical Chemistry Division, together with members of the Re-
actor and Reactor Chemistry Divisions, participated in various experi-
ments to determine possible sources of the organic deposits which have
caused plugging of valves and filters in the MSRE off-gas system. The
analytical support included:

1. the installation of a continuous hydrocarbon analyzer to monitor gas
streams from Reactor Chemistry experiments®® to gimulate oil leaks
into the MSRE pump and to evaluate trapping systems for reducing
hydrocarbon concentration, and to monitor hydrocarbons in the off-
gas from the Y-12 pump test loop; 4t
197

2. the determination by gas chromatographic analysis and by selective
chemical reactions of individual hydrocarbons in "grab" samples
from the above experiments and in a trapped sample from a nonradio-
active MSRE purge line;%?

3. the development of a technique to measure the concentration of hydro-
carbons collected on an experimental charcoal trap by pyrolysis of a
sample of the charcoal followed by gas chromatographic analysis of
the pyrolyzate. By sampling the charcoal bed at various depths, it
is possible to determine the distribution of individual hydrocarbons
as a function of trap length.

The continuous hydrocarbon monitor proved to be the most useful of
these techniques, particularly in measurements performed at the Y-12 test
loop with P. G. Smith, of the Reactor Division, and R. G. Ross, of the
Reactor Chemistry Division. Figure 7.23 is a flow schematic of the in-
Jection experiment. Although the experiment was designed to measure the
effects of deliberate injection of oil into the pump tank, the initial
results revealed an actual oll leak in the pump. The experiment there-
fore afforded an opportunity to study the oll leak and correlate the
hydrocarbon level in the pump tank off-gas with an operating variable
(sp across the shaft annulus) and thus distinguish between possible leak
locations. A typical plot of the hydrocarbon concentration in the pump
tank off-gas is shown in Fig. 7.24. When the pump rotation was stopped,
the shaft annulus Ap decreased from 3 to 0.5 psi, and the hydrocarbon
level in the off-gas dropped immediately to less than 10 ppm methane
equivalent. After about 25 hr the Ap began to recover, and the hydro-
carbon level started to undergo a series of rapid excursions that are
suggestive of discrete drops of oil entering the hot regions of the pump
tank. The average hydrocarbon concentration gradually returned to a level

of about 300 ppm, in parallel with increasing Ap. Similar fluctuations
in hydrocarbon concentrations were observed during three additional
changes in pump operation to reduce the Ap, which was ultimately shown to
be caused by a salt plug at the bottom of the shaft annulus. Because this
differential pressure is exerted across the seals between the shield plug
and the catch basin, the positicn of the leak was defined as through
these seals rather than down the shaft annulus. This was confirmed, on
disassembly, by an oil film and pyrolysis stain on the outside of the
shield plug.

Injection of oil, Gulf Spin 35, into the pump tank showed that es-
sentially all the oil entering the tank appeared as hydrocarbons in the
off-gas. Table 7.18 shows gas chromatographlc analyses of the off-gas
together with those from helium effluents from Reactor Chemistry experi-
ments in which the oil was injected into a helium stream entering an
empty nickel pot at 600°C. These results revealed that, at least in the
absence of radicactivity, oil entering the pump tank is predominantly
cracked to light hydrocarbons, methane, ethane, and unsaturates lighter
than Cs, which are trapped ineffectively on charcoal traps at 100°C.
Conversely, in the Reactor Chemistry experiments the cracking was incom-
plete to yield a substantial fraction of > Cg hydrocarbons, which are
trapped with high efficiency.

A thermal conductivity method to measure the total hydrocarbon con-
centration in the radioactive off-gas of the MSRE continuously has been
developed with the Reactor Chemistry Division. In this method the off-
gas sample is passed over copper oxide at 700°C to convert hydrocarbons
to CO, and HO. This oxidized stream 1s passed through one side of a
thermal conductivity detector and thence to a trap containing Ascarite
and Mg(C10.), to yield a stream of inert gases which is directed through
the reference side of the thermal conductivity cell. In bench-top tests
the response of thls apparatus was linear to total hydrocarbon concentra
tion of 1000 ppm with a limit of detection below 10 ppm. A similar sys-
tem with the trap and copper oxide furnace designed for one year of reac-
tor operation will be installed in the gas-sampling station of the MSRE.

7.6 Development and Evaluation of Equipment and Procedures for
Analyzing Radioactive MSRE Salt Samples

 

 

F. X. Heacker C. ©. lamb L. T. Corbin

The remote apparatus for determining the oxide content of MSRE salt
samples was installed in cell 3 of the High-Radiation-Level Analytical
Iaboratory (HRIAL) (Bullding 2026). Fluoride salt samples and tin oxide
standards were analyzed to check the apparatus and familiarize the HRIAL
persommel with the method. The results were satisfactory, and the phys-
ical manipulations required were performed adequately. Eight 50-g fuel-
salt samples have been analyzed remotely.

The time required to decontaminate the transport containers was
greatly reduced by using disposable mild steel plugs for each sample
submitted.
200

Sample Analyses

From January 1, 1966, through June 30, 1966, 43 MSRE fuel-salt sam-
ples were submitted for analysis. The samples were analyzed as shown
below.

Of the 43 samples submitted, two 50-g oxide samples were not analyzed due
to contaminated ladles. Three samples were analyzed for carbon and found
to contain <50 ppm.

Several of the samples were received with a silver and a Hastelloy
N wire coiled onto the stainless steel cable between the latch and ladle.
The latch, wires, and cable were separated and prepared for radiochemical
analyses.

Quality-Control Program

 

The quality-control program was continued during the first and second
quarters of 1966. A composite of the values obtained by four different
groups of shift personnel is shown in Tables 7.19 and 7.20. Molybdenum
values are not shown since it was not added to the synthetic solutions.

It was evident from the second~quarter control data that a positive
bias of approximately 3% existed in the amperometric zirconium method.
The bias was attributed to polymerization of the zirconium in the standard
solutions used to standardize the cupferron titrant. Although the bias
appears to have been eliminated by the preparation of new zirconium
standards, more data are needed to confirm it.

The positive bias existing in the spectrophotometric nickel method
has been reduced to approximately 8% by changing the color filter in the
filter photometer and constructing a new calibration curve. Further ef-
forts are being made to eliminate the bias completely.

The MSBR reference design concept was presented previously, and
is a two-region, two-fluild system, with fuel salt separated from the
blanket salt by graphite tubes. On-site fuel recycle is employed, using
fluoride-volatility and vacuum-distillation processing, In addition,
results were given for the case of direct removal of protactinium from
the blanket region; the associated concept was termed MSBR(Pa). Since
these studies, additional design conditions were investigated and
evaluated,? and these are discussed below.

8.1 Design Changes in MSBR Plant

 

In reactor design studies it often occurs that certain features of
the detailed design undergo changes as more understanding is obtained of
the overall problems and as new ways are discovered to solve a given de-
sign problem. Such changes have taken place during the MSBR design
studies; the most important are those associated with the primary heat
exchanger designs and the pressures that exist in the various circulating-
salt systems.

An objectionable feature of the MSBR heat exchanger design considered
previously was the use of expansion bellows at the bottom of the exchanger.
These bellows permit tubes in the central portion of the exchanger to
change in length relative to those in the annular region due to thermal
conditions. Since such bellows may be impractical to use under reactor
operating conditions, a new design was developed that eliminated them.

Figure 8.1 shows the revised heat exchanger design. The expansion
bellows were eliminated, and changes in the tube lengths due to thermal
conditions are accommodated by the use of sine-wave type of construction,
which permits each tube to adjust to thermal changes. In addition, the
coolant salt now enters the heat exchanger through an annular volute at
the top and passes downward through a baffled outer annular reglon. The
coolant salt then passes upward through a baffled inner annular region
and exits through a central pipe.

In Fig. 8.1 the flow of fuel salt through the pump is reversed from
that given previcuslyl in order to reduce the pressure in the graphite
fuel tubes, Fuel salt enters the heat exchanger in the immer annular
region, passes downward through the tubes, and then flows upward through
the tubes in the outer annular region before entering the reactor.

The blanket-salt heat exchanger was also revised to give a design
similar to that of Fig. 8.1. The general features of these exchangers
and their placement in the reactor cell are shown in Fig. 8.2. The

blanket-salt pump was also altered so thal blanket salt leaving the re-
actor now enters the suction side of the pump.

From the viewpoint of reactor safety, it is important that the
blanket salt be at a higher pressure than the fuel salt.? Under such
circumstances, rupture of a fuel tube would result in leakage of fertile
salt into the fuel and a reduction in reactivity. In order to achieve
this condition with a minimum operating pressure in the reactor vessel,
the fluid flow was reversed from thet in the initial MSBR design as
stated above. The resulting flow diagram is shown in Fig. 8.3.

In addition, it is desirable that any leakage between the reactor
fluid and coolant-salt systems be from the coolant system into the fuel
or blanket system. In order to achieve these conditions, the MSBR
operating pressures were revised to those shown in Table 8,1.

As given in Table &.1, the minimum pressure difference between the
core and blanket regions is about 15 psi plus the static head differential,
or a minimum total difference of about 30 psi. If it is desirable to in-
crease this pressure differential, the blanket salt pump could be changed
so that it discharges 1nto the reactor blanket region, giving a minimum
differential pressure between the core and blanket fluids of about 120
psi. Whether this change is necessary or whether it would increase the
reactor vessel design pressure is dependent upon the safety criteria
that need to be satisfied. A design pressure of 150 psia was used in
determining the thickness of the M3BR reactor vessel.

8.2 Modular-Type Plant

An important factor in attaining low power costs is the ability to
maintain a high plant-availability factor; design features that improve
this factor are desirable if these features do not themselves introduce
compensating disadvantages.

In the M3SBR plant, use is made of four heat exchanger circults in
conjunction with one reactor vessel in such a manner that if one pump In
the fuel circuit stops, the reactor is effectively shut dowa. If, on
the other hand, it were practicable to have four separate reactor cir-
cults, with each connected to one of the four heat exchanger circuits,
stoppage of a fuel pump would shut down only one-quarter of the station
capacity, leaving 75% available for power production. In order to de-
termine the practicality of using a number of reactors in a single 1000-
Mw (electrical) station, the design features of a modular-type MSBR
plant, termed MMSBR, were investigated.

The MMSBR design concept considers four separate and identical re-
actors, along with their separate salt circuits. The only connections
of the four reactors are through the fuel-recycle plant. The designs
of the heat exchangers, the coolant-salt circuits, and the steam-pover
cycle remain essentially as for the MSBR. Each reactor module gen-
erates the thermal power required for producing 250 Mw (electrical)
net.

The flow diagram given previously for the MSER (Fig. 8.3) also is
essentially valid for the MMSBR. Salt flow rates and capacities of the
various components remain as in the MSBR design.

Figures 8.4 and 8.5 give plan and elevation views of the four dis-
tinct reactor cells, along with their adjacent steam-generating cells.
Any reactor module can be shut down and serviced while the other three
remain operating.

The reactor core consists of 210 graphite fuel cells operating in
parallel within the reactor tank. The design of the graphite tubes
separating the fuel and blanket salts is similar to that used in the
MSBR. The reactor core region is cylindrical with a diameter of about
6.3 ft and a height of about 7.9 ft. The reactor vessel is approximately

The nuclear and fuel-cycle performance of a four-module plant gen-
erating 1000 Mw (electrical) was studied botn for protactinium removal
from the blanket stream and for the case of no direct protactinium re-
moval. The same methods and bases as those for the MSBR studies were
employed. Analogous to previous terminology, these cases are termed
MMSBR(Pa) and MMSBR. The results obtained are summarized in Table 8.3.
Comparison with the results obtained for the MSBR(Pa) and the MSBR indi~
cates that the nuclear and fTuel-cycle performance of a modular-type
plant compares favorably with that of a single-reactor~type plant; the
modular plant tends to have slightly higher breeding ratio, fissile in-
ventory, and fuel-cycle cost.

Capital cost estimates were also made for the modular plant. The
primary difference between the MMSBR- and MSBR-type plants is the use of
four reactor vessels and cells in the modular plant rather than the one
in the MSBR, However, the reactor vessels in the modular plant are
smaller, so that their combined installed cost 1s only about $1 million
more than that of the single large vessel. At the same time, The modular
plant permits better placement of cells and a reduction in building
volume. The resultant capital cost estimate for the modular plant was
about $114/kw (electrical) for a privately owned plant, which is about
the game as that estimated for the single-~reactor plant. Using this
cost estimate, along with the M3BR estimate for operation and maintenance
costs, and the fuel-cycle costs from Table 8.3, gives the power-genera-~
tion costs summarized in Table 8.4. These costs are nearly the same as
those for the M3BR-type plants and thus indicate the desirability of a
modular-type plant if the plant availability factor is improved by its
use.

8.3 Steam Cycle with Alternative Feedwater Temperature

 

In the sbove molten-salt breeder reactor concepts, the feedwater
temperature entering the once-through supercritical boilers was 700°F,
and the temperature of the "cold" steam to the reheater was 650°F.

These temperatures were specified in order to avold any freezing of the
intermediate-coolant salts? and involved diversion of prime steam. It
would be a significant advantage if it were not necessary to divert
almost 30% of the throttle steam for.heating of the feedwater and reheat
steam, since this diversion leads to a loss of available energy. An
even more significant saving could be achieved if the 9.2 Mw (electrical)
of power required to drive the feedwater pressure-booster pumps could

be eliminated; also, removal of the reheat-steam preheaters and the
booster pumps would reduce capital investment requirements. Thus, sav~
ings can be achieved by lowering the temperature of the steam-cycle

fluid entering the boilers and reheaters. To determine the incentive for
developing a coolant salt having a low liquidus temperature, the MSBR
steam-power cycle was studied with conditions of 580°F feedwater tem-
perature and 550°F reheat steam. In order to differentiate and compare
cases, use of 700°F feedwater and 650°F rcheat steam is designated case
A, while case B represents the alternative conditions.

The cycle arrangement for the case B conditions is shown in Fig. 8.6.
In this cycle the 552°F steam from the high-pressure turbine exhaust is
introduced into the reheaters without preheating. The feedwater is
heated from 550 to 580°F by the addition of one more stage of feedwater
heating; steam extracted from the high-pressure turbine is used, The
condensate from this new heater is cascaded back through the feedwater
heaters to the deserating heater in the usual manner. The heat balances
and the analysis of the steam cycle with case B conditions were performed
in the same manner as for case A conditions. Table 8.5 compares the de-
sign data for the two cases.

The elimination of the feedwater pressure-booster pumps required in
case A saves about 9.2 Mw (electrical) of auxiliary power, which, to-
gether with the improvement in the cycle thermal efficiency due to the
additional stage of feedwater regeneration, makes about 2.7 Mw (electrical)
additional power available from the case B cycle. The overall net thermal
efficiency is thus improved from the 44.9% obtained from case A to 45.4%
in case B.

To complete the discussion of case A vs case B conditions, the cost
estimates for the affected items of equipment were compared; the results
are summarized in Table 8.6. As shown, the case B arrangement requires
about $465,000 less capital expenditure, primarily due to removal of the
pressure-booster pumps. [In this cost study it was assumed that the
580°F liquidus-temperature coolant salt has the same cost (about $1.00/1Db)
as the MSBR coolant salt.] The lower construction cost reduces power costs
by about 0.008 mi11l/kvhr (electrical), while the increased efficiency
lowers power cost by about 0.026 mill/kwhr (electrical) (private financ-
ing), to give a total saving of about 0.034 mill/kwhr (electrical) [0.021

mill/kvhr (electrical) for public financing]. This saving in a 1000-
Mw (electrical) plant (0.8 load factor) corresponds to about $238,000
per year. The present worth (6% discount factor) of this saving over

a 25-year period is about $1.5 million. For several MSBR power plants,
the saving would be proportionally greater. Thus, there is an economic
incentive Tor developing a coolant salt with a low liquidus temperature,
so long as its inventory cost does not outweigh the potential saving.

Tf the inventory cost of the coolant salt for case B were about $2.4
million more than that for case A, the potentisl saving would be canceled
by the increased coolant-salt inventory cost (for a privately owned
plant).

8.4 Additional Design Concepts

 

Other molten-salt reactor designs were studied briefly.? In general
the technology required for these alternative designs is relatively un-
developed, although there are experimental data that support the feasibility
of each concept. An exception is the molten-~salt converter reactor (des-
ignated MSCR), whose application essentially requires only scaleup of MSRE
and associated Tuel-processing technology. However, the M3CR is not a
breeder, although it approaches break-even breeder operation. The ad-
ditional concepts are termed MSBR(Pa-Pb), SSCB(Pa), MOSEL(Pa~Pb), and MSCR.
The MSBR(Pa-Pb) designation refers to the MSBR(Pa) modified by use of
direct~contact cooling of the molten-salt fuel with molten lead. Lead
is immiscible with molben salt and can be used as a heat exchange medium
within the reactor vessel to significantly lower the fisslle inventory
external to the reactor. The lead also serves as a heat transport medium
between the reactor and the steam generators.

The SSCB(Pa) designation refers to a Single-Stream-Core Breeder with
direct protactinium removal from the fuel stream.” This is essentially a
single-region reactor having fissile and fertile material in the fuel
stream, with protactinium removal from this stream; in addition, the core
region 1s enclosed within a thin metal membrane and is surrounded by a
blanket of thorium-containing salt. Nearly all the breeding takes place
in the large core, and the blanket "catches" only the relatively small
fraction of neutrons that "leak" from the core (this concept is also
referred to as the one-and-one-half region reactor).

The MOSEL(Pa-~Pb) designation refers to a MOlten-Salt Epithermal
breeder having an intermediate-to-fast energy ‘spectrum, with direct
protactinium removal from the fuel stream and direct-contact cooling of
the fuel region by molten lead. No graphite 1s present in the core of
this reactor.

The MSCR refers to a Molten-5alt Converter Reactor that has the
fertile and fissile material in a single stream. No blanket region is

2h

employed, although a graphite reflector surrounds the large core.

The fuel-cyecle performance characteristics for these reactors are
summarized in Table 8.7; in all cases the methods, analysis procedures,

and economic conditions employed were analogous Lo those used in obtain-
ing the reference MSBR design data. In general, fuel recycling was based
on fluoride-volatility and vacuum-distillation processing; direct prot-
actinium removal from the reactor system was also considered in specified
cases,

The results indicate the potential performance of fluoride-salt
systems utilizing a direct-contact coolant such as molten lead and the
versatility of molten salts as reactor fuels. They also illustrate that
single-region reactors based on MSRE technology have good performance
characteristics. Since the capital, operating, and maintenance costs of
the MSCR should be comparable with those of the MSBR, the power-produc-
tion cost of an investor-owned MSCR plant should be about 2.9 mills/
kwhr (electrical), based on a load factor of 0.8. However, the lower
power costs of the MSBR(Pa) and MSBR plants and their superior nuclear
and fuel-conservation characteristics make development of the breeder
reactors preferable,

M. E. Whatley

A close-coupled facility for processing the fuel and fertile streams
of a molten-salt breeder reactor (MSBR) will be an integral part of the
reactor system. Studies are in progress for obtaining data relevant to
the engineering design of such a processing facility. The processing
plant will operate on a side stream withdrawn from the fuel stream, which
circulates through the reactor core and the primary heat exchanger. For
a 1000-Mw (electrical) MSBR approximately 14 ft? of salt will be proc-
essed per day, which will result in a fuel-salt cycle time of approxi-
mately 40 days.t

The probable method for fuel-stream and fertile-stream processing
is shown in Fig. 9.1. The salt will first be contacted with Fp for re-
moval of U ag volatile UFg. Purified UFg will be obtained from the flu-
orinator off-gas (consisting of UFg, excess Fp, and volatile fission
product fluorides) by use of NaF sorption. It may be necessary to dis-
card as much as 5% of the salt leaving the fluorinator for removal of
fission products such as Zr, Rb, and Cs. A semicontinuous vacuum dis-
tillation will then be carried oul on the remalning salt for the removal

of the rare earths, Ba, Sr, and Y. These fission products will be re-
moved from the still in a salt volume equivalent to 0.5% of the stream.
The barren salt, the purified UFg, and the makeup salt will then be re-
combined. This step involves reduction of UFg to Uy, mixing of these
streams, and sparging the resultant waterial with an Hp-HF stream, Fi~
nally, the salt mixture may be filtered before return to the reactor.

9.1 Semicontinuous Distillation

 

J. R. Hightower L. E. McNeese

New measurements of the relative volatilities of NdF3 and Lak3 in
LiF have been made using a recirculating equilibrium still. These values
are lower than earlier data by a factor of about 50 and are in a range
(around 0.0007) where the proposed distillation step in the MSBR proc-
essing plant should work very well.

The present concept of the distillation step in the MSBR processing
plant uses a continuous feed stream and vapor removal for separating
rare~earth Tission products (Fpis) “rom the fuel salt; the less volatile
rare-earth FP's will accumulate in the still pot and will be discharged
periodically.?t A measure of the decontamination achieved in this step
is the relative volatllity of the less volatile FP's compared to the
carrier salt. The relative volatility of component A compared to com-
ponent B is defined as

Y, /X,

“ap = YR

where
cB = relative volatility of A compared to B,
Y = vapor-phase mole fraction,
X = liquid-phase mole fraction.

For systems in which the concentration of component A is small and X
is nearly unity, the relative volatility can be approximated by

Op Tp/%y (2)

To achieve good decontamination from the less volatile fission products
their relative volatilities must be small.

Since the major constituent of the still pot will be LiF, experi-
mental measurements have been made with mixtures of rare-earth fluorides
in LiF. A cold-finger technique gave approximate values for the relative
volatilities of six rare-earth fluorides with respect to LiF (975 to
1075°C) ranging from 0.01 to 0.05.2 These were high enough to sericusly
limit the effectiveness of the proposed simple distillation scheme. More
accurate measurements of the relative volatilities were called for.

Fig. 9.2. Diagram of Reciraulating Equilibrium Still,

A diagram of the recirculating equilibrium still used in recent
work is shown in Fig. 9.2. The boiling section is a 12-in. length of
2~in.~diam nickel pipe. The condensing section is made from l-in. nickel
pipe wrapped with cooling coils of 1/4-in. nickel tubing. In the bottom
of the condenser is a condensate trap where liquid collects and overflows
a welr to return to the still pot. The vacuum pump is connected near the
bottom of the condenser section.

After charging salt of known composition, the still is welded shut
and purged with argon. The desired pressure is set, and the still is
heated to the desired temperature while cooling the condenser. After
operating the still for a period of time at the selected conditions, the
still is pressurized with argon, cooled to room temperature, and cub
apart for examination and sampling. The concentrations of the rare-earth
fluorides in the condensate trap and in the still pot are used to calcu-
late relative volatilities according to Eg. (2).
230

In these experiments the determination of absolute values for rela-
tive volatilities has been hampered because the vapor samples have rare-
earth concentrations below the analytical limit of detection. However,
upper and lower limits of the relative volatilities for 0,01 to 0.02 mole
fraction CeF3, NdF3, and LaFj in LiF at 1000°C and 0.5 mm Hg were deter-
mined and are given below:

0.0013 <p poo < 0.0029

0.00055 < Ger 1p < 0.00089

= 0.00069.

These values are substantially lower than those previously reported. The
samples have been submitted for analysis by a more sensitive analytical
method (neutron activation). Higher concentrations of rare-earth fluo-
ride will be used in the still pot in future work in order that rare-
earth fluoride concentrations in the vapor phase will be higher than the
limit of detection.

The importance of relative volatility in determining the operating
characteristics of the distillation system is shown by the following cal-
culation. Consider the reboller of a single-stage distillation system
which contains V moles of LiF at any time and a quantity of BeFpy such
that vapor in equilibrium with the liquid has the composition of MSBR
fuel salt. Assume that MSBR fuel salt containing Xo moles of rare-earth
fluorides (REF) per mole of LiF is fed to the still pot at a rate of F
moles of LiF per unit time where it mixes with the liquid in the system.
Let the initial REF concentration in the liguid be Xo moles of REF per
mole of LiF, and let the concentration at any time © be X moles of REF
per mole of LiF. From a material halance on REF,

o (vx) = FXg ~ FX , (1)

where

V = still liquid holdup, moles of LiF,
X = BREF concentration in still liquid, moles of REF per mole of
Liv,
F = LiF feed rate to still, moles per unit time,
Xo = REF concentration in feed, moles of REF per mole of LiF,
& = relative volatility of REF referred to LiF.
This equation nas the solution

x =X [1 — (1 a) THN] (2)

The total quantity of REF fed to the system at time t is (Ft + V)Xg, and

9.2 Continuous Fluorination of a Molten Salt

 

L. BE. McNeese

Uranium present in the fuel stream of an MSBR must be removed prior
to the distillation step since UF, present in the still would not uve
completely volatilized and would in part be discharged to waste when the
still contents are dumped periodically. Equipment is being developed
for the continuous removal of Ur, from the fuel stream of an MSBER by
contacting the salt with Fy in a salt-phase-continuous system. This
equipment will be protected from corrosion by freezing a layer of salt
on the vessel wall; the heat necessary for maintaining molten salt ad-
Jacent to frozen salt will be provided by the decay of fission products
in the fuel stream. Present development work consists of two parts:

(1) studies in a continuous fluorinator not protected by a frozen wall,
and (2) study of a frozen-wall system suitable for continuous fluori-
nation but with which an inert gas is used. Experimental work on the
nonprotected system is well under way; the protected system is being
designed.

The nonprotected system consists of a l-in.-diam nickel fluorinator
72 in. long and auxiliary equipment (Fig. 9.4) which allows the counter-
current contact of a molten salt with Fp. Ixperiments can be carried
out with molten-salt flow rates of 3 to 50 cm [min with fluorinator salt
depths of 12 to 54 in. The system is constructed of nickel with the ex-
ception of molten-salt transfer lines, which are Hastelloy N. The flu-
orinator off-gas passes through a 400°C Naf bed for removal of chromium

fluorides, a 100°C NaF trap for removal of UFg, and a soda-lime bed for
TF, disposal. Analysis for Fa, Ufg, and Np is made prior to the 100°C
NaF bed with a gas chromatograph.

Experiments have been carried out at 600 to 650°C using an NaP-LiF-
ZrF, mixture containing 0.2 to 0.5 wt % UF, and having a melting point
of ~550°C. Salt feed rates of 5 to 21 cm’/min and Fy rates of 75 to
250 em?/min (STP) have been used with molten-salt depths of 40 to 52
in. Uranium removal during one pass through the fluorinator has varied
from 95% to 99.6% as determined from salt samples. Equipment operation
has been smooth although several plugs have developed in salt transfer
lines and in the fluorinator off-gas.

During the best rua to date (cF-10), a molten-salt feed rate of
20.7 em®/min and an Fy feed rate of 250 cm®/min (STP) were maintained
for a 2.5«hr period. The concentration of U in the feed salt was 0.32
wt %, and the fluorinator was operated at 650°C with a salt depth of
48 in. The U concentration in the salt discharged from the fluorinator
during the last hour of operation was 0.0020 wt % as determined from
four salt samples taken at 15-min intervals. Based on inlet and exit
U concentrations in the salt, 99.4% of the U was removed by the flu-
orinator. The equipment operated smoothly during the run, salt and gas
feed rates were constant, and the system appeared to have reached steady
state during the last hour of operation.

Continuous fluorination of the fuel stream of an MSBR with equipment
of the type studied is considered feasible. Study of continuous flucri-
nation will be continued, and the use of a frozen wall for corrosion pro-
tection will be demonstrated.

9.3 Alternative Chemical Processing
Methods for an MSER

 

G. I. Cathers Co. BE. Schilling

Ligquid-metal extraction was studied in a previous search for a salt
reprocessing method to replace vacuum distillation. These tests with
LipBel, salt showed that the lanthanides were removed In most cases by a
reductive coprecipitation with Be to yield refractory lansoluble beryl-
lides deposited at the salt-metal interface. The present problem was to
develop a reductive precipitation using minimum quantities of Li or Be
as reductant and involving simple physical separation of the precipitated
metals by filtration or settling. Decontamination factors were determined
using initial concentrations of 30 to 1000 ppm of Zr, Nd, Ia, Sm, Eu, Gd,
and Sr either singly or in various combinations.

Further studies on the liguid-metal extraction method were made using
Li-Bi alloys to test removal of the same elements with the exception of
Zr and Nd.

Reduction Precipitation

 

The reduction-coprecipitation studies were made on 15~g (7.5-cc)
samples of LipBeF, spiked with cold neutron poisons as the fluorides;
the samples were contained in mild steel under a protective atmosphere
of argon. A typical test consisted of: preparation and sampling of the
original salt while molten; reduction with between 1 and 243 times the
theoretical amount of Li or Be at temperatures in the range 3500 to 1000°C
for about 90 min with stirring by an argon sparge; filtration through a
sintered Cu filter stick; recovery of frozen samples of treated salt from
the filter and, when possible, precipitated metals from the bottom of the
reactor. Salt samples were analyzed for lanthanides and zirconium by neu-
tron activation analysis, spark source mass spectrometry, or emission spec-
trometry. The metal precipitates were examined by x-ray diffraction.

The decontamination factors DF (La) and DF (Gd) shown in Table 9.1,
when compared with the indicated process requirement at the bottom of
each column, show that adequate removals could be achieved with both Li
and Be using excess reductant in the range of 1 to 4 times the theoretical
requirement for LnBeis deposition. The low values obtained in experiment
8 reflect the incomplete removal of Zr, present in this one experiment
as a major component (11.7%). In this case the final concentration of
Zr (500 ppm) was comparable to the initial concentrations of Ia end Gd,
and therefore sufficient to inhibit their reduction. The species iden-
tified in the metal precipitates recovered (see Table 9.1, experiments
1, 3, and 10) indicate that reduction of lanthanides in LisBel, with
either Li or Be leads exclusively to beryllides of the type InBeisz. The
x-ray identifications listed in Table 9.1 represent only the most likely
specific beryllide since all the InBejps compounds of the lanthanide series
are isostructural, with very nearly identical lattice parameters, and
therefore are indistinguishable from each other when codeposited from a
mixture.

 

Examination of zirconium DF's shown in Table 9.1 show it to be re-
moved easily from solutions in LisBelFy, over a broad range of concentra-
tion by treatment with either Li or Be. It is deposited either as free
metal or from very dilute solutions (70 ppm) as ZrBe, (Table 9.1, experi-
ment 4). The value of DF (Zr) = 11 obtained at 1000°C in experiment 7
is of special interest since it suggeste a solution to the high volatility
of ZrF,, a major problem encountered at this temperature in the vacuum-
distillation salt recovery method. Lithium or beryllium could be used
to retain Zr in the still pot as nonvolatile free metal. In experiment
4, due to the low zirconium concentration (70 ppm), ZrBe, was identified
along with O-Zr.

In addition to the elements listed in Table 9.1, Sm, Fu, and Sr
were studied as parts of the mixtures used in experiments 1, 3, and &
plus other tests not listed. Aside from a DF (sm) = 2 observed in ex-
periment 3 and a DF (Sr) = 1.14 in an unlisted test using Ii at 550°,
no encouraging results were obtained by this method for these elements.

Li-Bi Alloy Extraction

Liguid-metal extraction tests with solutions of Li in Bi were made
in the same equipment but without filtration of either phase. Samples
were recovered after settling, quenching to room temperature, and sac-
rificing the crucible. Both salt and metal slugs were cleaned of sur-
face deposits before sampling for analysis.

The decontamination factors (DF's) and distribution coefficients
(kp) obtained in liguid-metal extractions of spiked carrier salt using
1i-Bi alloys are summarized in Table 9.2. For the spectrum of spikes
present (1a, Sm, Bu, Gd, and Sr) adequate decontamination was achieved
for all but Sm. The generally high DF's cannot be explained in most
cases by a true extraction mechanism, a fact indicated by the low dig-
tribution coefficients shown in Table 9.2. Also, poor material balances
were obtained through use of analytical results from samples of the salt
and metal phases, The explanation for removal of the elements in question
is precipitation as interfacial solids which were later identified by
x-ray analysis to be beryllides of the InBeis type. The high Kp observed
for Eu indicates that this element was removed almost exclusively by ex-
traction when using 30 at. % Li-Bi alloy.
