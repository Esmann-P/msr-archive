ABSTRACT

This report summarizes the design and development of the fuel pump and
xenon removal system for the Aircraft Reactor Test. The system is comprised
of two fuel pumps with an expansion tank mounted just above and between them,
and a complex of impellers, seals, and stators arranged to be a. part of the
removable fuel pump assemblies. The xenon removal system is designed to
bleed approximately 1.5% of the main fuel flow rate into the expansion cham-
ber through the xenon removal equipment; The stripped fuel is returned to
the main system by way of centrifuges mounted immediately in back of the fuel
pump impellers. The centrifuges serve to filter out any entrained bubbles
and provide in conjunction with seal impellers a suitable main fuel system
pressure level. |

‘The initial design and development work included as an objective the
achievement of a system insensitive to attitude. That work is included in
this report as an aid to future designs.

This report includes the following:

1. ‘The underlying design precepts and requirements upon

which the development was based.

2. The functioning and principle of operation of the finalized
design. =
3. The chronological evaluation of the finalized design and

the major design changes in the development.’

4. Discussions and calculations pertinent to five design
criteria: |
a. pump impeller design
b. system pressure control
c. swirl stability.
d. bubble removal in the centrifuge

e. seal requirements and performance.

DESIGN CRITERIA

Precepts and Requirements oe

The nign absorption cross. section of £11

makes it extremely desirable
to strip xenon continuously from all or a fraction of the fuel*. in high pover
density redctors:: Xenon can be stripped from liquid fuels’ by exposing the"
fuel to a gas interface where the Xenon molecules can diffuse from the- liquid.
The rate of xenon extraction from fuel at a given temperature is a function
of the Xenon concentration in the fuel, the partial pressure of xenon in the
contacting gas, and the rate of exposure . Thus, & Xenon removal, or "xX -R",
system might function as follows: oo |

1. A fraction of the fuel could be bled into a processing chamber.

2. A large interface in this. chamber could be provided by means

of agitation, bubble. entrainment, or spraying.

3. The xenon-free fuel could be returned to the systen’ in such

a manner as to avoid foam or gas bubble carry-over.

To appreciate. the X-R system as applied to. the. Aircraft Reactor Test, it.
must be clearly understood that the initial conception involved five basic pre-
cepts; namely: : :

Te From 1 to 2% of the. fuel should be bled continuously from
oo the main fuel stream.
2. The interface in. the expansion tank should be. used for the .
: removal of. xenon.
3. The pump shafts should supply any. energy required for ‘the:
operation of the system: ‘ : CL
4, A centrifugal field should be employed + to prevent gas carry-
over into the main fuel stream to. avoid affecting reactivity.
5. The X-R system should operate in stable equilibrium. with the
fuel pump and maintain the desired fuel system pressure .level.

  

 

¥ & reactor Tiherently will reach riTibrium xenon concentration
determined by the balance betyeen Xenon generation on the one hand
and xenon decay and "burn-up" on the other. Any concentration below
this inherent equilibrium concentration implies xenon stripping.

lel
 

These design precepts indicate the intimate..relationship of the design
of the X-R system to the control of the system pressure, -expansion tank liquid
level stability, and the pump design with all of its seal and accessibility
problems, The mul £1 tude of interrelated design requirements mean that the
X-R system mst do a great deal -more than remove Xenon. A summary of the de-
sign requirements is given in Table 1. 1. —.

The interdependence of these design requirements is not immediately. ap-
parent. After preliminary study, it became evident that the complexity of
the complete system demanded that the X-R system and the fuel pump be developed
separately and subsequently tested as a unit. The development of ‘the X-R sys-
tem and the pump is discussed in Sections II and III. So

The basic design data and physical properties used in the design of the
X-R system are given in Table 1.2. Most of the dimensions were predetermined
by the pump configuration and space limitations. ‘Certain critical dimensions

were computed. The detailed calculations are ‘given in the appendix.

To. effect gas removal from the fuel a fraction should be recycled from
the main elreult through a chamber with a helium atmosphere.

To increase the dissolved gas removal effectiveness, the fuel in the

gas removal chsmber should be agitated. to increase the helium entrairment
thereby increasing the surface area and reducing the diffusion path length
in the fuel. |

The stripped fuel must be returned to the main fuel circuit free of gas
bubbles.

To prevent bubbles from entering the core. the return circuit must be
designed without leakage.

.The system pressure must be maintained at a predetermined level.

An expansion volume must be provided for the fuel.

Circulation must be maintained through the expansion tank to avoid over-
heating from fission product decay heat.

Reactor off-gas and fuel vapor contamination of the pump Jabricating oil

should be a minimum.

Circuit Description
. The ART fuel circuit is most readily understood by referring to Figs.

1.2 and 1.3. For clarity the circuit will be divided into zones and described

 

separately.
Zone 1. Primary Fuel Circuit

Circuit wise the main fuel loop consists of two pumps operating in Fe
lel with a common discharge. Half of this circutt is shown in Fig. 1. b,
fuel discharges into. the core header and flows through the core and the heat
exchangers to the pump suction. Co

The core header serves as a plenum and as.a mixing chamber into which

processed fuel is discharged from the centrifuge (shown dotted -in Fig. 1.k4).
Since the centrifuge and the fuel pump have a common discharge, it is seen
that the fuel pump discharge pressure is regulated by the centrifuge discharge
pressure and that the fuel pump suction pressure is regulated by systen. resis-

tance of the circuit.

Zone 2. Bypass Fuel Circuit.

The bypass pump passes approximately. 2% . of the main fuel pump flow rate
into the sparging chamber where it is intimately mixed with helium to dilute
and remove from the fuel the Xenon™3? produced in the reactor core (see Fig.
1.5). The liquid-gas mixture is jétted into the expansion tank where part of
the gas is separated from the fuel by allowing the mixture to form a relatively
quiet pool from which the gas escapes to the off-gas system. The fuel in. the
expangion tank, with small amounts of entrained gas, feeds by gravity into the
centrifuge where the last of the gas is removed .and fed back to the sparging
chamber. The centrifuge discharges into the discharge of “the fuel pump there-
by returning the fuel to the main circuit as well as maintaining the discharge

pressure of the main pump.

Zone 3.- - Dynamic Seals
There are three dynamic seals.-which are essentially centrifugal pumps,
in the bypass fuel circuit arranged to pump against the pressure of fuel
entering the seal impellers from what is normally the discharge end of. the
blades. The interrelationship of these seals is shown in Figs. 1.2 and 1. 3.
The. upper slinger seal serves to prevent the fuel from leaking up the
pump shaft towards the bearings and to allow the helium to flow down the
pump shaft and into the sparging chamber. The lower slinger seal serves |
to prevent the fuel from leaking from the sparging chamber into the centri-.
fuge and to allow the gas removed by the centrifuge to flow into the sparging
chamber. The centrifuge slinger seal limits the amount of recycle around the
top of the centrifuge. |

Xenon Benoval. System Design

The X-R system ‘described in this section is the finalized ART design.

The system originally envisioned for application to the ART was one that
would-be insensitive to attitude. Before the development work on an atti-
tude-stable. system vas completed, it. was. found that the. "north head" region
of the reactor would have to be revised because of a severe stress problem.
Another factor which contributed to the decision to radically modify the
original system was a 50% increase in the anticipated reactor fuel volume.

. The redesign of the "north head" region and the increased fuel volume
necessitated a change in. both the vélume and shape of the fuel expansion tank.
The. shape of the tank was changed from cylindrical. to ellipsiodial with the
pump barrels. passing through each end of the oval. The original requirement
for this system to be. insensitive to attitude was to ‘be accomplished by spin-
ning the fuel volume ‘in the expansion tank and using the resulting centrifugal
force to stabilize the liquid-gas interface. Changing the shape of the expan-
sion tank to its final design made the problem of stabilizing the fuel gas
interface much more complex and resulted in a decision. to eliminate the atti-
tude stability requirement for the . sake of an expeditious design. The develop-
ment work completed on the original ‘design is included in Section. III of this
report to give a background for the final configuration and for. possible future
application in an aircraft reactor with an attitude-gtability. requirement.”

A simple plastic model of the X-R system was designed and built to test
its gas removal ability and. to calibrate the bypass flow through the centri-
. fuges. A cross section through this model is shown in Fig. 2.l.

Xenon Removal System Flow

As “the - design of. ‘the reactor progressed, the estimated fuel volume ine
creased. This increased fuel volume necessitated a larger expansion tank and
a. larger bypass flow rate through the expansion’ “tank and centrifuge for the
following reasons Co Co Lo

1. The fuel ‘expansion tank volume: increased in capacity in
. proportion to the total fuel ‘system. volume.
2. To maintain “the xenon concentration the same as for the
smaller fuel volume, the stripping rate increased in
‘direct proportion to the’ fuel. volume.
3. To keep the greater expansion volume from overheating
| and creating a serious zirconium snow problem, the
‘quantity of low temperature fuel recirculated through
the expansion tank increased in proportion to the fuel
volume: :
~The metering of the bypass flow taken from the main fuel” circuit nad to
be done by properly sizing the hole up the center of the pump shaft and the.
four radial holes forming “the bypass puzp. A second factor affecting the. by=-
pass ‘flow was the difference between the. pump suction pressure and the expan-
sion tank gas pressure. This second factor could. not be determined in the
model as it is controlled by the combined ‘performance of the centrifuge, fuel
pump and pump volute. "

During the model tests the atfeérence ‘between the pump suction pressure
and the expansion tank gas pressure was caloulated from performance data ob-
tained from separate tests of ‘the fuel pump and centrifuges.

From Fig. 2.1 it can be seen that there are two principle volumes to the
model. The volume between the two upper plates. simulates the ‘expansion tank
and the volume between the ‘two lower plates represents the high Pressure
region at the discharge of . the fuel ‘pump in the main fuel circuit. At the
lower end of the shaft is a bearing and seal arrangement. to ‘separate the
large high pressure. volume from ‘the hole in ‘the. center of the shaft. The
reason for this arrangement was to control the pressure in the small volume
at the lower end of the shaft at a value near that expected in the suction

region of the main fuel pump.

 
 

To calibrate the bypass flow through the model a line containing a flow
meter was connected between the high pressure discharge region and the low.
pressure region at the lower end of the shaft. A valve in the line was used
to control the flow until the pressure at the entrance to the shaft matched
that expected at the suction of the main fuel pump. If the flow up the shaft
was greater than that desired in the X-R system, then the bypass pump holes
were reduced, and conversely if the flow was too small the holes were opened.
The reasons for metering the flow with the bypass pump holes were that changes .
in the holes size were simple to make and also were highly effective as the
pressure drop in this region is very large.

The bypass flow rate which was measured by the flow meter was that bleed
from the discharge region to the region below the seal while the measurement
desired was that of the flow up the shaft. In the actual test the leakage
around the seal was large (approximately 2 to 4 gpm), and amount to 15 to 30%
of the total bypass rate. As this leakage could only be estimated, the first .
calibration could easily be in error by.1l0 to 15%. This bypass rate was later
determined much more accurately in the single pump Inconel hot loop test rig
to be described later.

Xenon Removal System Gas Removal

The increased bypass flow necessitated by the increased reactor fuel
volume increased the velocity of the fuel passing out of the centrifuge to
such an extent that gas bubbles were carried into the main system. This in-
gassing was eliminated by increasing the flow area available to the fuel.
This increase in flow area vas accomplished by increasing the number of holes
in the outer wall of centrifuge from 8 to 33. |

A skirt connected to the lower end of the shaft shroud was added to the
system after it was originally built to prevent the incoming liquid from
falling to the bottom of the centrifuge cup and being thrown directly out-
ward toward the exit holes. Without the skirt the liquid which is thrown out-
ward carries entrained gas bubbles into the high velocity region of the exit
holes where the smaller bubbles will then be carried on into the main fuel

circuit.

 

20.

 
 

Two other items which were added to the model were centrifuge baffle
and blades. As the direction and magnitude of the flow in the centrifuge
cups are not known, the point at which the smallest gas bubbles are screened
out in the cup. is not known. However, it is logical that. any direct passage
through the cup would enable the liquid to. carry. more gas ‘through the cup
than if the velocity were more evenly distributed over the full height of the
cup. . The baffle was added to prevent the - “incoming fluid from having a direct
passage to the exit holes.

The centrifuge blades were added to decrease the slippage betwen the
incoming fluid to the centrifuge cup and the cup. Prevention of this slippage
improves the system in two ways. The effectiveness of the centrifuge dépends
primarily upon the speed of rotation of the fluid. It is obvious then that
any slippage between the fluid and the cup decreases the effectiveness of
the centrifuge. } | ; | ) LL

The second reason for reducing this slippage stems from the necessity
of having to balance the discharge pressure of the centrifuge against the.
pressure rise across the centrifuge slinger seal. "The discharge pressure of
the centrifuge must be maintained above that of the centrifuge slinger dis-
charge to prevent the fluid from bypassing the - centrifuge and carrying gas
into the main system. With the blades installed it is possible to predict

the centrifuge discharge pressure very closely from the. equation:

H = vu?
= 72
where .
H = Head, ft 1b per 1b
U0 = Tangential velocity, ft per sec
g = gravitational constant, 32.2 ft per geet.

The presence of slippage in the cup ‘introduces an unknown coefficient to
this equation ‘and also makes the nead delivered by the centrifuge 1 more depend-
ent on the flow through the centrifuge. g

There is one advantage to having the slippage in the cup. During test
with the model it bécame apparent that the discharge pressure of the centric:
fuge 1s a function of the liquid level in the expansion tank. As the liquid

 
level in the expansion tank decreases the centrifuge pressure. decreases, re-
sulting in a. like decrease in: pressure at the pump’ suction. region, This
reduced pressure at the pump suction results in a smaller flow up the pump

shaft and through “the centrifuge. ‘The decreased flow’ there causes a reduction
in the slippage which tends’ to’ increase: the centrifuge discharge pressure. This
stabilizing ‘effect on the pressures ‘was not advantageous enough to overcome ‘the
disadvantages stated above,

The opening between the sparging chamber and. the expansion tank was made
as large as possible. During tests made with this opening restrictive it was
found that the fluid. was backed into the sparging ‘chamber. When the fluid
level moved radially inward from the tip of the lower slinger seal, it re-
stricted the gas flowing upward around the shaft from the centrifuge to the -
expansion tank. With this normal path restricted, the gas was forced to
leave the centrifuge through the same opening ‘ag that used by the incoming
fluid vhich reduced the effectiveness of the centrifuge for larger bypass flows.

ART Fuel Pump Development

The operability of a. face-type ‘gas-seal sump pump pumping liquid metals
was experimentally demonstrated in the summer of 19519 1a the fall of 1953,
G. F. Wislicenus designed an impeller (Fig. 2. 2) to produce the head and flow
required of the ART reactor using Flinak as the fuel. A volute was designed
within the space limitation of the reactor for this impeller in late 195k,
Throughout this paper sections of the pump will be located by numerical sub-
scripts. The position of these sections and their numbers are shown in Fig.
2.2. The subscript (0) designates the "eye" of the passage just before the’
impeller; (1) the impeller vane outermost inlet edge, and (2) the impeller
vane outlet edge or impeller rim. A full scale model was built and water
performance test data were obtained in early 1955. The model was installed
in a test loop built of 6 in. pipe with head and £lov measuring instrumenta~
tion and a throttling valve, The pump was driven by 15=hp variable-speed,
d-c motor. The first experiment was: performed by using a pump-suction cone
riguration that simulated the’ ART reactor design. The entrance region of the

pump vas obscured by a flat plate located 1 in. below and parallel .to the -
pump suction. A second test was performed with the plate removed and replaced
by an 8 in. pipe connected directly. to the pump suction. The. results of these
two experiments are shown in Figs. 2.3 and 2.4. The pump performance as indi-
cated by these two experiments was not affected by the simulated reactor en-
trance conditions. Since the flat plate was very difficult to install, the
8 in. pipe suction was used for all subsequent testing.

The test conditions and results from a series of experiments performed in
the test loop are given in Table 2.1. The performance data from these experi-
ments are plotted in Figs. 2.3 through 2, 13. The performance data given in
Fig. 2.13 are representative of the best operation obtained during this series
of tests. The pump efficiencies are not considered accurate on an absolute
basis, because the motor was not calibrated and the motor efficiencies were
obtained from the manufacturer's computed data. It is estimated that the
efficiency of ‘the pumps, exclusive of seal and bearing losses, is approximately
75% at the design point.

The impeller blade tip angle, Bos was increased to 26.5 deg from 22 deg in
order to produce the reactor design head and flow and a pump speed approaching
‘the design speed; the results of this change are given in Fig. 2.5. Data ob-
tained by varying the impeller radial clearance from 0.010 in. to 0.040 ‘in.
indicated a loss in pump performance of approximately 8% at. low-flow high-head
conditions and’ of approximately up near the design point. These data are given
in Fig. 2. Te

A: cavitation-like ‘noise persisted throughout Experiments 1 through 12 at
flows above 400 gpm and speeds in excess of 2000 rpm. The intensity of this
disturbance increased with increased flow or speed above the threshold values.
It was suspected that the noise mightcbé thecredilts: of poor! fluid giidance at
the leading edges of the impeller vanes. An attempt was made to improve this
condition by changing the entrance angle of the blade to match that of the
fluid by machining the leading edges so that they lay on the surface of a cone
whose apex went through the shaft centerline. The performance data from these

-26-
changes are given in Figs. 2.6 and 2.8. Modifications were also made to the.

inlet radius of the suction eye and to the impeller nut to improve the entrance
conditions.. These changes had no noticeable effect upon the character of the .
noise.. A new impeller blade was designed to give better entrance conditions
with no noticeable improvement. The performance data of this impeller blade. is
given in Fig. 2.10.

It was determined that the noise was not primarily due to cavitation at the
blade leading edge but rather to a local condition that existed at the tongue |
of the volute. This was established by the use of a carbon microphone probe..
A circuit was devised so that the microphone signal could be observed on a.
cathode-ray os¢illoscope. With this arrangement, the region of maximum noise
was located near the volute tongue. The volute tongue was cut back to allow
more area for the flow. This modification gave a decrease. in performance with
no improvement in the noise. The performance date for this modification is
given in Fig. 2.9.

The need for additional flow area in the volute is evidenced by the hy-
draulic unbglance of the impeller at the design point and the occurrence of
the. design speed maximum efficiency at approximately 20% less than the design
© flow. A structural change in the design of the reactor north head region to
improve the stress conditions allowed the pump volute flow area to be increased;
however, this increase’ only compensated for the increase in-the fuel flow rate.
required for improved heat exchanger performance. To. obtain the additional
‘required flow area, the pump volute was redesigned without diffusion cones.

Results of the water performance tests as given in Fig. 2.11 with the re-~
designed volute indicated excessive leakage losses between the impeller dis-
charge and the impeller suction. This is indicated by the sag in the perform-
ance curve at high-head low-flow conditions. The shroud radial seal slingers
were extended to the impeller full diameter to increase their developed back
pressure. The results of this modification are given in Fig. 2.12. To further
reduce this leakage, the impeller axial clearance was reduced from 0.102 in.

to 0.053 in. The results of this modification are given in Fig. 2.13.

-27-
 

The difference in the pump total discharge head and the average impeller
blade static discharge head asia function of pump speed and flow, as deter-
‘mined from Experiment No. 15, is shown in Fig. 2.14. The data shown in
Fig. 2.14 allows the éalculation of the: volute efficiency (k). This effici-
ency, k, (Fig. 2.15) is defined as the fraction of the absolute impeller dis-
charge velocity head which.is converted to static head at the pump discharge.

© It may be seen from Fig. ‘2,13 that the design point lies in the region of
maximum efficiency and that the condition of hydraulic force balance on the
impeller occurs near the design point. ‘The noise present with the previous:
volute design was completely eliminated. “Based on the performance of the pump
indicated by Experiment No. 15, it was decided that ‘the redesigned volute and
the original impeller with a B, of 26.5 deg would be used in the reactor.

FIG, 2.15 ART FUEL PUMP VOLUTE PERFORMANCE CHARACTERISTICS
Combined ART Fuel Pump and Xenon Removal System Development oo

The final development work on the X-R system was’ done with a single pump
Inconel hot loop test rig (see Fig. 2.16). . This final work was originally
planned to be done. ‘with a twin pump test loop very similar to the’ north head
regioh of the ART. Construction difficulties with ‘the ‘twin pump ‘160p delayed
its completion and’ ‘the development work was shifted to the single: pump 1600p.
This loop combined the’ latest X-R system tested. with the plastic model and the
final’ ‘pump design determined. from, the pump vater tests. | All development work

done with the single ‘pump rig, used water as the’ working fluid.

System Pressure Fluctuations

At high liquid levels. in the expansion tank (above 3 in.) it - was found
that the pressure throughout the main: system was subject to ‘rather large and
irregular fluctuations. These fluctuations ‘decreased as the expansion tank -
level was decreased from 3 in. to about 3/4 in. where the fluctuations again’
began to increase. This increase at low levels was ‘expected. The fluctuations
at low expansion: ‘tank levels were observed in the plastic model and attributed
to a fluctuating liquid-gas interface in the centrifuge. The flow into the
centrifuge is by gravity from the expansion tank and any decrease. in the level
in the expansion tank will decrease the flow to. the centrifuge. As the main
fuel circuit is filled with an essentially non-compressable fluid it is necces=-
sary’ ‘that the flow to and" from this system be equal; thus, . any. change in the
flow to the centrifuge will result: in a change in the pressure of the main .
system and therefore a change ‘in the flow from the main systen back to the
expansion tank. It can then be. seen that as the liquid level in the expansion
tank decreases, “the flow to and ‘through the centrifuge decreases and the main
system pressure decreases. As shown ‘previously. the main. system. pressure is
controlled by the discharge ‘pressure. of the centrifuge and any decrease in main
system pressure results from a decrease in the centrifuge discharge pressure.
In the case being discussed the centrifuge is running at constant speed and has

+ a fixed outside diameter. Therefore any decrease in discharge pressure must

result from a decrease in the suction pressure of the centrifuge. or increase
in the effective. inside diameter.’ .In the case of ‘the low expansion “tank level
the effective inside diameter of the liquid-gas interface moves radially out-
ward decreasing the pressure rise ‘through the centrifuge. This change in liguid-
gas interface was observed in some of the earlier tests with plastic models. For
very low liquid levels this condition becomes. unstable with the centrifuge alter-
nately trying to become first empty and then as the outflow decreases to become
fall. a > TTT RE
The cause of. the fluctuations at high expansion tank liquid level was not
nearly . so obvious. During the development work each of the various flow paths
were investigated and the difficulty aS found to be caused by a fluctuation
in the pressure at the ‘inside ‘diameter of the centrifuge. The cause of this }
fluctuation was traced to the “Lower slinger seal. At very high liquid levels
the centrifuge will run in a flooded condition and it is: ‘probable that slugs
of liquid. as well as gas will flow upward between the shroud and shaft to the
inlet of the lower slinger seal. ‘This gas and liquid flow through the slinger
impeller would cause it to surge with the surges being transmitted ‘back to the
centrifuge as irregular periods of high and low pressure. ‘fhese surges ‘would
then be transmitted through the centrifuge to the main system. ’

To alleviate these surges the vanes were ‘removed from the lower slinger
seal. By removing these ‘vanes the head of the ‘lower slinger seal is reduced

and any flow surges in ‘this region will: be .dampened.

System Pressure Level

A aifficulty encountered in the. carly testing of the combined systen was
an excessive system pressure level which results’ in a high stress condition.
being imposed on the plate. which separates ‘the expansion “tank ‘and ‘the fuel
pump discharge. Since this pressure level is fixed by the centrifuge ‘pressure
rise, attempts were nade to reduce the centrifuge pressure rise by two different
approaches. First, ‘the inside diameter. of the" centrifuge cup vas increased, and
- second, the exit ares from the centrifuge was decreased. There were several ad-

vantages to the first method. The change in the existing centrifuges were very

“k7-
 

simple to make, and ‘also it was possible. to calculate very closely the new. in-
side diameter of the centrifuge cup to get the desired change in the main system
pressure level. Another advantage is that the cross sectional area of the en-
trance to the cup 18. increased. and. will lead to a more stable system pressure
at lower expansion tank liquid levels. One disadvantage is that the radial
depth of the liquid in, the centrifuge is decreased. This thinner layer may
enable gs bubbles to pass into the main system under operating conditions
where they would have been stopped with the thicker layer. In the case of the
small exit area from the centrifuge the major disadvantage was the difficulty
of making the change. Any decrease in the exit area by decreasing the number
of exit holes or the diameter of these holes will increase the velocity through
the cup and thus reduce the degassing ability of the centrifuges. To overcome
this difficulty the holes would have to be tapered with the hole area at the
inner wall of the cup remaining the same and with ‘the area at the exit in the
"outer diameter being reduced. Not only would the construction of these holes
be difficult but their size would have to be determined by trial and error.
One advantage of this system is that the liquid level or liquid gas interface
- in the centrifuge does not change. .The second and more important advantage
was never confirmed by test. This second advantage would show up only in the
case where one of the two reactor pumps had stopped while the other was running.
For this one pump out operation it is very desirable that the centrifuge have a
head flow characteristic such that the head decreases very rapidly with any in-
crease in through flow. All of the clearances around the centrifuges are large
and the leakage is controlled by a. dynamic seal. When one pump stops the seal
is also lost s0.that the. leakage becomes very large unless the pressure drop
across this clearance is decreased.. In. the case where the exit area is small,
the pressure. drop across the exit holes of the operdting] pump disclarge and will
increase rapidly with the increased flow resulting from leakage around the in-
operative pump. In the case. of the enlarged inside centrifuge diameter the
head of the centrifuge mst also ‘drop off. rapidly as’ the ‘through flow, increase;

~ but in this case, the decrease in head must’ be accomplished by the centrifuge

 

 

 
the centrifuge becoming partially empty and increasing the effective inside

 

diameter even more. This increase in the diameter of the gas-liquid inter-

face leads to a breakdown in the effectiveness of the centrifuge.

Bypass Flow Determination and Control

One of the most important purposes of the combined system tests was to
determine and control the bypass flow. As. previously noted the plastic model
served only to give an approximate rate because of leakage of the lower seal.

In the combined single pump--system the bypass flow passage was identical to

that for the ART. A disadvantage of this system ig the lack of a method of
directly measuring this bypass flow. The procedure used was to plug the hole

in the center of the pump shaft through which the bypass flow normally passes
and substitute an external line between the pump suction region and the expan-
sion tank. This external line contained a valve and flow meter to regulate

and measure the flow. During these tests runs the pump speed and main system
flow were held constant while the flow through the external line was varied.

The expansion tank gas pressure and the pump suction pressure were measured.
This" method yields a pseudo head-flow curve for the centrifuge and is used as

a calibration for test runs where the actual flow up the pump shaft cannot be
determined directly. The use of the pump suction pressure rather than the
centrifuge discharge pressure for calibration purposes is arbritrary. The use
of the suction pressure does simplify the immediate reduction of the data, and

© more important, the pressure differences between the pump suction and the ex-
pansion tank is one of the factors: controlling the ‘bypass flow and is of more
interest than the pressure difference. between the centrifuge discharge and the
expansion tank. ‘After this pseudo head-flow curve was established for a series
of operating points, the plug was removed from the pump shaft and the external
line closed. The operating point used in the above calibration runs were then
repeated and again the pump suction pressure and the expansion tank gas pressure
were determined. The data for the runs with the pump shaft plugged were plotted
as shown . in Fig. 2.17. The difference between the pump suction pressure and the
expansion tank gas pressure for the pump shaft open runs were then checked against
the identical calibration run and the bypass flow up the shaft was read from the

curve.

The flow through the external line or up the pump shaft. is not the total
flow through the centrifuge. - Part of the centrifuge flow recirculates over
the centrifuge slinger sedl and back -into the cup. This recirculation flow
is not ‘accurately know but since. it: is not a function of the manner in which
the. flow gets ‘from the pump suction to the expansion tank, but instead is only
a function of the flow through the" centrifuge, it does not enter into the cali-

bration.

Fuel Leakage Past Upper Slinger Seal

One’ item inherent in the X-R system design vas the cause of much concern.
This was the possibility of fuel passing over the upper -slinger seal and being
forced or drawn up into’ the narrow annulus between the pump shaft and the bar-
rier shield. plug. If any fuel from the system were to rise into this region
it could freeze because of the cooling of the lubricant circulating in this
region. The fuel on freezing becomes hard and could do damage to the shaft
and shield plug can ‘and could. possibly freeze the shaft to the stationary
shield plug can. ‘This would necessitate a change of the pump rotary element.
If the reactor had been at power this task would be. unpleasant.

- In the ‘early test in the Inconel hot. loop, the upper slinger seal design
was the same ‘as ‘used in. the plastic model: This design had twelve radial vanes
about 3/16 in. high for. the full radial distance. (see Fig. 2. 18). In these
early tests’ it was found that the gas pressure in the expansion tank was. greater
than that in the oil catch basin region: of the rotary element. In many cases,
this. pressure difference was as large as three to four feet of ‘working fluid:
head. For the first design this pressure difference was found to depend upon
the pump ‘speed, the gas flow down the pump shaft ‘annulus, and the liquid level
in the expansion. tank: There:was & gmoticeable "break point" in this. pressure
difference as the expansion tank liquid level ‘passed 2 in. This is also the
"level at which the liquid: will uncover the. ports between the sparging chamber
and the ‘expansion tank. As the liquid level was reduced from a" ‘high level to

‘about 2 in., there was no significant change in the pressure difference. At:

5 }

 
 

-51-
approximately 2 in. the pressure difference ‘dropped sharply and was then again
fairly.independent of the liquid level as it was reduced further. The level
‘at which the break point occurred was not fixed but was dependent on whether -.
the liquid level was increasing or decreasing. The level for this break point
was higher for the case when the liquid level was increasing. than when the
level was decreasing. It was also noted even at the highest liquid levels:
that as the rate of gas flow down from the catch basin was increased the pres-
sure difference was decreased and for extremely high flow, several times the
normal 500 liters per day, the pressure difference would reverse with the

_ catch basin gas pressure being greater. than the gas pressure in the expansion
tank. It was also found that this undesirable pressure difference increased:
as the pump speed increased. o

Under: normal operating conditions a gas pressure reversal in this region
will not cause any damage. . The potential head of the slinger is greater than
the pressure difference s0 that no liquid will be drawn over the vanes. The
real danger of .this condition is for the case where one or both pumps stop
suddenly asin theccase.of a power failure. If the slowing down rate of the
pump is so rapid that the inflowing gas cannot build up the pressure in the
lower pressure region at the same rate the dynamic head of the seals is de-
creasing due to. the decreasing speed, "then the liquid will be drawn up into
the annulus ‘around the pump. shaft and probably require a replacement for the
rotary assembly.

All of the above observations show that the upper slinger seal .is.acting
as a gas pump. - The actual gas pressure buildup in the expansion tank is. far
greater than a pump of the size and. type used should be able to normally pro-
duce using gas as the working fluid. It appears that the pressure buildup is
due to the recirculation of liquid through and over the vanes. The upper
slinger seal acts the same as an open face centrifugal pump operating under no
flow conditions. Due to the rather large axial clearance over the top of the
seal and recirculation is large. This recirculation appears as a flow: outward

through the vanes and an inward flow through the clearance above the vanes.

    

eh ot vr
_

The outward flow carries gas bubbles to the outer tip where it then escapes into
the sparging region and then into the expansion tank. As this process continues
the pressure difference will increase and the - length of vane which is covered
by liquid will increase as- the liquid is drawn radially inverd to produce a.
large head to offset this rising pressure difference. As this radial dimension
of the liquid increases, the centrifugal effect of the spinning liquid begins
to screen ‘or centrifuge the gas inward toward the pump shaft, These counter-
acting effects thus limit the magnitude of the - pressure difference the upper
 slinger seal can produce. This also explains the observed dependence of the
pressure. difference on ‘the liquid level, speed and. gas flow. As the gas flow
is increased it will reach such a flow that. the upper slinger seal cannot en-
train and pump -the gas as fast as it, enters. When this flow. is ‘reached the
pressure difference will reverse. In. the case of the effect of the liguid
level ‘the observed hysteresis becomes clear. Before the upper slinger seal
can act as 8 gas pump it must become primed. When: the liquid level is in-
creasing the upper slinger seal will "throw". the liquid away from its tip |
until the level has’ reached a point higher. than the ‘upper slinger seal or un-
til the liquid which obstructs the exit ports from the sparging chamber causes
the pressure to build up in the region of the tip of the upper slinger seal.
When the expansion tank is filled to about 2-1/2 in., the liquid level is

above the upper slinger seal and it is primed when the pump is started. To
break this prime the level must be reduced until the exit ports from the
sparging. chamber are open and the pressure at the outer radius of. the upper
slinger seal is reduced. This also’ accounts’ for the sudden ‘ghange in pressure
when these points are reached. The ability of the upper slinger seal to en-
train and pump gas. is obviously a function of the speed.

In trying to overcome ‘this problem, the basic idea was to reduce the
large recirculation over the upper slinger seal which with the large axial
clearance required is impossible to completely stop. The first attempt was
to replace the vaned upper slinger seal with one whose ‘top surface was smooth.
The axial clearance was held the same as for “the vaned upper slinger seal.

This reduced the unfavorable pressure difference but did not reverse it.

-53-
 

Several other methods were tried with some improvement but were not completely
satisfactory. All of these changes. were attempts to reduce the outward flow Co.
potential at the rotating surface. I
The design Which finally gave a pressure difference in the desired direc- . .
‘tion, i.e., the. catch basin’ pressure greater than the pressure in the expansion
tank, is ‘shown in Fig. 2. 19. The top surface. of the upper slinger seal was cut
back for a’ radial distance of 3/k in. This configuration gave a catch basin
pressure higher than that in the" expansion tank by about 10 to 1b in. at design
conditions and nigh liquid levels in the expansion tank. This increased clear-
ance reduces the potential head of the upper slinger seal, but as it has far
| more head capacity than required to protect the rotary element when operating
normally there is no deleterious effect in making this change. The outside
diameter of the upper slinger seal could not be decreased to obtain the fabor-
able pressure gradient.’ It was found that a liquid seal must be maintained be-
tween the face of the upper slinger seal and the sparging chamber. With this’ .
favorable pressure gradient, the fuel cannot enter the shaft annulus during
the slowing down of the pump. Also once the pump has stopped, the gas flow : -
to the expansion’ tank through the shaft annulus maintains the favorable pres-
sure gradient. ’
Experimental Results
* The test results of the final design configuration are shown in Figs.
2.20 through 2.28. Figs. 2.20 through 2.23 give the -head flow characteristics
of the system as a ‘function of speed. The value of the difference between the
pump suction and expangion tank pressure is ‘also shown. The small variations
in the head«flow curves from one liquid level to another are probably not sig-
nificant and are within the accuracy of the data. The values of the difference
‘between the pump suction pressure (7, ) and the expansion tank gas pressure (Pg )
are definitely a function of liquid level at lower levels, especially at 1 in.

The reason for the scatter in the data can be seen.by examining Figs...
2,2k through 2.27. -These figures show the pressure fluctuations throughout
the test loop as a function of speed, flow, and liquid level. - While these
fluctuations are not large enough to cause any damage to the reactor, they
did make analysis of the data difficult. The reason these relatively small
fluctuations were so important can be seen by studying Fig. .2.17. If the

value of-P - Phe on the figure are shifted. by 0.2 ft, the error in. deter-
mining the actual bypass .flow at 645 gpm amounts to about 5%. At lower
liquid levels the fluctuations become larger and the experimental values of
the bypass flow erratic. For this reason, the bypass flows for the lower

: liquid levels are calculated (see Appendix E).

Calculated and experimentally determined flow up the pump shaft or
that amount which bypasses the main fuel pump is shown in Fig. 2.28. This
is not the total recirculation through the expansion. tank. In the test loop
in which ‘the data was obtained there was a leakage of approximately 0.6 gpm
from a point near the pump suction to the expansion tank. This leakage
should be added to the bypass flow to get the actual total flow through the
expansion tank. In the reactor there is also a leakage very similar to the
one in the test loop. This leakage is around the island where it passes
through the floor of the expansion tank. The amount of this leakage is
estimated to be about k gpm or 2 gpm per pump and like the leakage in the
test loop will depend upon the operating pump speed and flow.

The total flow through the centrifuge cups is equal to the sum of the
bypass flow, leakage and recirculation over the top centrifuge seal vanes.
The leakage over the vanes is large, about 6 to 8 gpm at design conditions.
This large leakage does not effect the degassing ability of the cup. The
reason for this is that when the flow has increased to the point where in-
gassing occurs the head of the centrifuge has dropped to the point where it:
is less than the head of the vanes. Under this condition it is probable that
the centrifuge is not completely full and that the inside diameter of the
vanes receive gas only. The vanes then act as a slinger and there is no flow
through them in either direction, the location of the liquid-gas interface
being determined by the head required to match that of the centrifuge."

FIG, 2.28

CALCULATED AND EXPERIMENTAL ART FUEL PUMP BYPASS FLOW CHARACTERISTICS
ART Fuel Pump Cavitation Characteristics
| Cavitation refers to conditions where, because of a local increase in

velocity as in regions of either boundary curvature or eddy generation,

vaporization of the flowing liquid creates vapor filled cavities. These

cavities collapse in regions of higher pressure elsewhere in the system,

In order to form such vapor cavities, the pressure first has to drop to

the vapor pressure of the working fluid; a condition that can be realized

as a local condition without a change in the average system pressure. For

a pump operating at a constant. speed a local pressure drop results from

separation and contraction of flow and deviation of streamlines from their

normal trajectory such as takes place in a turn or in passing an obstruction

to the flow. The evils of the cavitation phenomenon are essentially three

in number: (1) reduction in efficiency due to constriction of flow and loss

of energy, (2) objectionable ~ if not structurally dangerous - vibration and

and noise; and (3) possible extensive pitting of boundary materials in the

zone of bubble ‘collapse, due apparently to failure through fatigue after

countless stress reversals.

The local pressure drop caused by the difference in the pressures on
the leading and trailing sides of the ‘impeller blade is the major cause of
cavitation in a centrifugal pump. This local pressure drop is a function of
the relative inlet velocity. Ww), “the number of blades (Z), the thickness
of the blades (t) and the local absolute velocity (cy).

The .test loop from Which the original pump, development date was obtained
was not constructed in a manner to allow operation at an elevated temperature
or at a. suction pressure below atmospheric. For this reason the ‘determination’
of the fuel pump. cavitation characteristics was delayed until the construction
of .a suitable loop. The loop designed for the hot testing of the fuel pump
vas used for obtaining the cavitation data. The Thoma cavitation parameter
(or) (NE vas determined for the final impeller design as a function of the
percent change in the pump maximum head at a constant flow and speed. The
parameter o is

-66-

oe
where BH, is ‘the pump total suction pressure measured close to the. pump eye in
order 0 avoid frictional losses, Bap 18 the vapor pressure of the working
fluid, -and H max is the pumpmaximum total head.

The results of these’ experiments are ‘shown in Figs. 2.29 through 2.31.
From these cavitation data and the data previously obtained on the difference
between the expansion tank pressure and the pump suction pressure, Fig. 2,32
was made on the assumption that the: suction pressure required to. prevent cavi-
tation was independent of the liquid level in the expansion tank. Fig. 2.32
gives the minimum expansion tank pressure required to prevent cavitation as a

function of the expansion tank liquid level and the pump speed and flow.

DESIGN OF AN ATTTTUDE-STABLE XENON REMOVAL SYSTEM

In addition to the design precepts’ and requirements of a stationary up-
right xenon removal system, one. suitable for. application to aircraft must meet
the additional requirement of attitude stability. ©) An over- all picture of”
the original attitude stable X-R systen is given. in Fig. 8.1. Illustrated
particularly are the swirl chamber in relation: to. the rotary elements, the
interconnecting parts, and the direction of fuel passage. The swirl chamber
acts as an expansion tank in ‘the fuel system and as a processing tank for.
xenon stripping. All other’ required functions ‘are carried out in the rotary
assembly, & cross section of which is shown in Fig. 3.2, which shows a full
scale test model of the rotary assembly. The nomenclature of parts as used
in the description is identified in Fig. 3.2.

Fig. 3.3 depicts the system as a hydraulic circuit. } The numbers are
only illustrative to. point out the pressure interdependence between the X-R

system and the main fuel circuit.

Circuit Description

The bleed circuit is most readily understood by referring to. Figs. 3.2

and. 3.3. In the description below the circuit will be described in zones,

as follows:
Zone 1: Centrifuge, core neader region and nozzles
(pressure control)

Zone 2: Nozzles, swirl chamber; and flow split stators
(primary swirl)

Zone 3: Flow split stators, swirl pumps, ‘and swirl chamber
(secondary swirl)

Zone l. System Pressure Control
Circuit. wise, it is best to consider the centrifuge as a radial vane

centrifugal pump (see Fig. 3.4) discharging fuel to the core header region,

which serves as a mixing chamber into which processed fuel is discharged

and from which an equal volume of fuel is bled for processing. Two nozzles
direct the bleed flow into the expansion tank as tangential Jets to induce

a swirl. These nozzles represent the major resistance in the circuit.and,

| together with the centrifuge speed, determine the bleed flow rate and the
header region pressure. Since the header region is also the discharge region
for the main fuel pumps (shown dotted in Fig. 3.4) it is seen that the bleed
circuit in effect determines the main pump discharge pressure and thereby

the reactor system pressure. By making the pressure drop across the nozzles
equal to the main system fuel pressure drop, the main fuel pump suction pres-
sure can be maintained at swirl chamber pressure (controlled by the off-gas

system).

Zone 2. Primary Swirl

This part of the bleed circuit serves the primary purpose of agitating:
the fuel. The fuel in the swirl chamber is made to spin (reinforced by the
circuit of Zone 3) by the tangentially directed discharge of the fuel from .
- the nozzles (see Fig. 3.5) and careful contouring of the swirl chamber walls.
The resulting high peripheral velocities induce violent agitation, mixing,
and gas entrainment in the spinning fuel. The spin also serves to make the
fuel level insenstive to attitude. As seen in Fig. 3.5, ducting designed
into the swirl chamber wall directs fuel into two protruding ports in the |
pump housing. The fuel scooped up by the ports is directed to the flow split
stators which divert such fractions of the fuel axially downward into the
‘centrifuges as’ is required to balance the centrifuge. discharge’ (see Zone 1).
Under normal operating conditions the centrifuge is simply flooded, the ex-

cess being diverted upwards into Zone 3.

Zone 3. Secondary Swirl

The upward directed excess of Zone 2 is passed to two auxiliary centri--
fugal "swirl". pumps mounted on the main fuel pump shafts. The discharge of
these pumps is directed by suitable porting and contouring (see Fig. 3. 6) to
reinforce. the spin in the swirl chamber. This additional energy is not re-
quired until the level in the swirl chamber rises to about 40% full. : By

virtue of its elevated position the swirl pumps automatically cut in when the

level in the swirl chamber rises sufficiently to prime the swirl impeller.
The swirl impeller also serves to vent the gas liberated from the fuel

in the centrifuges. A gas passage connecting the swirl impeller suction side

with the centrifuge center is formed by a shroud around the shaft as shown in

Fig. 3.7.

Dynamic Seals
- To complete the circuit description two important seals will be described
briefly. Both seals are essentially radial vane centrifugal impellers arranged
to pump against the pressure of fuel entering the impeller from what is normally
the discharge end of the blades.
In the case of the upper slinger seal, its function is to prevent any fuel
"leaking past the swirl pump from moving up the pump.shaft toward the bearings.
The upper slinger seal impeller radius exceeds the swirl impeller radius in
order to provide some safety margin and to permit inverted operation. -
The centrifuge slinger seal is an integral part of the centrifuge (see
Fig. 3.8) and serves to limit the amount of recycle around the top of the
centrifuge. The blade diameters must be such as to .develop nearly centrifuge
pressure but never to exceed it. A more detailed discussion regarding design

and performance is appended.

Test Development

The chronological stages of the development of the ART-XR system are
summarized diagrammatically in Table 3.2. Excerpts of a summary by A. P. Fraas
of the development of the first six models are appended to this report. These
models first indicated the need of employing a centrifuge and pointed out
several instability problems which led to the decision to build the swirl
chamber as a separate physical entity.

Denoted as Model No. 7 in Table 3.2 and illustrated in Fig. 3.10, such
a swirl chamber was tested independently of the pumps by supplying feed from
the plant sanitary water supply line. Tests were run at 2.6, 4.6, 8.9 psig

inlet pressure with various resistances in the discharge lines simulating
lift and friction losses. The test data are summarized in Table 3.3.

In conducting the tests it was observed that the liquid level in the
swirl chamber sought its own equilibrium level for any combination of inlet
and back pressure. Efforts to change liquid level independently. of pressures, .
by adding ater directly to the swirl chamber, were unsuccessful; either the
level reverted promptly to its original equilibrium level or a non-equilibrium
condition resulted with the level continuously rising to overflowing.

The nature of this swirl instability was subsequently analyzed and is
schematically represented in Fig. 3.9 in terms of an energy balance. The

sequential dependence is as follows:

1. The amount of liquid retained by the centrifuge controls the

centrifuge delivery pressure.

‘2. The centrifuge delivery pressure acting on the nozzle deter-
mines the flow rate out of the centrifuge and into the swirl
‘chamber. BN

3. With the flow rate and pressure established the energy input
to the fluid is established.

bh, For equilibrium conditions the input energy must equal the

losses. The losses can be broken down into:

a. nozzle loss - a function of flow
b. swirl chamber discharge loss - a function of flow
c. lift - fixed
d. swirl chamber agitation loss - a function of swirl chamber
| liquid level i
_ e. swirl chamber drag loss - a function of swirl chamber |
liquid level.

5. Since the swirl chamber also serves as the expansion volume for
the fuel systems, a rising fuel temperature will initially cause
a rising level in the swirl chamber. . This changing level by way
the 4d and e dependence above, affects the system equilibrium in
a manner dependent on the initial equilibrium liquid level.

FIG. 3.9- ATTITUDE - STABLE SYSTEM SWIRL CHAMBER ENERGY BALANCE
]

From Fig. 3.9 it is seen that the agitation losses decrease
“with rising level and is the predominant loss at "low" liquid
levels. The drag losses, however, rise with increasing level

and ‘predominate at "high" liquid levels.

Instability A:

With the swirl chamber at an initially "low" liquid level, a
rising level (due to a rising fuel temperature) reduces the

swirl chamber loss and thereby increases the flow out of the
swirl chamber. With the centrifuge cup initially full this.

does not, however, . increase the flow into the swirl chamber. |
In effect, then, the swirl chamber reverts to its initial
stable level, transferring the extra inventory to the space

above the centrifuge. . As born out by test experience, the

swirl chamber "refuses to act as an expansion chamber".

Instability Bs
With the swirl chamber at an initially "high" liquid level,
a rising level increases the. swirl chamber loss and thereby
decreases the flow out of the swirl chamber and into the
centrifuge. cup. With its supply reduced the centrifuge liquid
level drops thus reducing the energy supplied to the swirl
chamber, With energy losses increasing (due to rising liquid
level from (a) the extra inventory due to temperature rise and
(b) the volume no longer retained by the centrifuge) and input
energy decreasing, the system is more and more unbalanced, re-
sulting in a run away condition as born out by test experience.
The. swirl chamber may overflow and the centrifuge cups will lose
their primes.

At pressures above 7 psig sufficient flow was obtained to give good spin
and agitation. However, the tests indicated definite instability tendencies

for certain combinations of liquid level, back pressure and inlet pressure.

The instability tendency was more clearly apparent in Test Model No. 8 (Table
3.2) when the swirl chamber was placed” in series with one centrifuge.

The analysis of the swirl chamber indicated a marginal energy balance be=
tween the energy in the fluid issuing from the jets. .and the fluid friction los-
ses in the swirl chamber. At some minimum swirl chamber level a metastable

operating condition was attained. "Any small increase in frictional resistance

a

unbalanced the system to the point where the centrifuges lost all prime and
freely passed air. It was not possible to reestablish stable operating con-
ditions. In. Test Model No. 9 every effort was made to reduce connecting line
friction losses. Furthermore, the swirl chamber was raised such that the
centrifuge could be supplied by gravity. However, even under these conditions,
the system could not be stabilized over the full range of liquid levels.

It was, therefore, decided to augment the energy supplied to the swirl
chamber by an auxiliary impeller as shown in Model No. 10, Table 3.2. The
centrifuge discharge was passed upward through the clearance space between the
centrifuge cup and. the wall where it joined the auxiliary bypass fluid discharged
by the impeller mounted on top of the centrifuge cup. .

Although the centrifuge flow rate could not be determined, this model was
able to remove bubbles. from the plenum chamber below the centrifuge. Swirl
chamber operation was stable. . However, no appreciable system pressure could
be developed. :

The performance of Model 10, Table 3.2, and the analysis leading up to it
indicated that the system was. sufficiently well understood to make an attempt
at an improved design appear promising. A two-pump integral plastic model was,
therefore, designed. incorporating the following features:

1. Locating the swirl chamber above the centrifuge cup to permit priming.

2. Incorporating an auxiliary impeller which by superimposing a re=
circulating £1ow supplied excess energy to the swirl: chamber.

3. Designing a configuration such as to make passages between swirl
chamber and centrifuge assembly as short as possible to minimize

friction losses.

an

4. Introducing the centrifuge delivered flow: into the swirl chamber
©. through highly restrictive nozzles to maintain the system pres-:

sure and to provide: spin at low swirl levels.

* The assembly as originally built is illustrated in Fig. 3. 11.

“The development of this unit to the final working model involved ‘changes
in the rotary assembly only. "These are illustrated in Table 3. 2, ‘Models 11 -
through 15. The problems encountered were primarily sealing problems to prevent
recirculating short circuits. This development work is outlined in Table 3. 2.
Finally, the entire assembly was mounted ona rig to permit inverted operation.
The performance is summarized in Table 3.k. The final critical dimensions for
Model 15, Table 3.2, are listed in Table 3.4. The final design is illustrated
in Fig. 3.12.

System Analysis (Refer to Fig. 3.3)

The manner in which the X-R system controls the main system pressure is
most easily seen from a study of the characteristic curves of the two systems.
Figs. 3.13 and 3.14 illustrate the characteristic curves for the main fuel
pump circuit and bypass flow circuit respectively. The ordinates. are drawn to
the same scale but intentionally do not have their origin defined. The labeled
points have the following physical significance:
(a) fuel pump discharge pressure
(b) centrifuge discharge pressure
(¢) centrifuge inlet pressure
(d) fuel pump suction pressure
As previously described and. illustrated in Fig. 3.4, both the centrifuge
and fuel pump discharge into a common header and therefore points (a) and (b)
must be at the same pressure. Secondly, since the centrifuge inlet, because of
its gas interface is essentially at swirl chamber helium pressure, i.e., since
point (c) is at p = O (reference), all the other pressures are fixed relative to

(c) as shown in Fig. 3.15.

-91-
FT esi }

The system pressure, particularly the pump suction pressure, is therefore

controlled by the helium. pressure .and the bypass flow pressure drop. The bleed
flow Ap is primarily controlled by the nozzle resistance. This nozzle is made
highly restrictive in order to keep the pump suction pressure high enough to

~ prevent cavitation. .Any pressure drop across the centrifuge. cup holes reduces
the system pressure by an equivalent amount. Thus any condition that simulates
an increased flow through the centrifuge cup holes effects a reduction in the -: =

system pressure level.

SUMMARY OF WORK (TO JULY, 1954) LEADING TO THE
DESIGN OF PUMPS FOR THE CFRE
 

 
 

- SUMMARY OF WORK (TO JULY, 1954) LEADING TO THE.
DESIGN OF PUMPS FOR THE CFRE

(Refer to Models 1 through 6 Table 3, 2)*

“The face-type gas-seal sump pump is attractive for use with high tempera-
ture liquids because, by inserting a heat dam, the seal can be operated at -
conventional temperatures with conventional materials, for example, hardened .
steel and graphitar in a petroleum ‘oil bath providing both lubrication and
‘cooling. . An experimental unit was prepared in the summer of 1950 on the thesis
that the free surface. could be maintained in a centrifugal field and hence could
be made insensitive to -the variations in pump attitude and negative "g" loads to
be expected in flight. A particular feature of the design was. that it should:
act to de-aerate the system -- a feature considered essential in a full-scale
aircraft type pump. . The principles of operation were demonstrated by operating
the pump with water in the fall of. 1950 and approximately. 80-Hr of: further testing
with sodium at temperatures up to 1000°F was carried out in the summer of 1951.

- As the design :of the ART progressed. it became evident that there is a
strong incentive to remove xenon, and. that this might be done by agitating the
fuel in the expansion tank so that it would entrain bubbles. . This would serve
both to: increase the’ surface area by a large factor and to bring a high Propor-
tion of the fuel close to a surface within a short period of time. Thus ‘1 or
24 of the fuel could be by-passed through the expansion tank and the bulk of
the xenon stripped before returning it to the main stream. . The arrangement had
the additional advantage that it would avoid overheating of the fuel in the
expansion tank as a result of fission product decay activity. While a separate
agitator could be provided, it was felt that the number of moving parts should
be minimized and that the pump impeller shaft could serve a double purpose.

The notion of utilizing a centrifugal field. in back of the impeller to stabi-

lize a free surface ‘there had worked so nicely in the pump. mentioned earlier

that a modification of it to effect xenon removal seemed promising. A simple
model of work, glass, ‘and plastic was prepared to investigate the possibilities.
A section through this model is ‘shown in Fig. A.l. The model was designed to
operate with the fluid in the expansion tank swirling under the impulse of fluid
accelerated and thrown off by the impeller. A considerably higher swirl velocity
was expected ‘in the annulus just above the impeller, and a diaphragn. vas inserted
to separate this region from the main part of the expansion tank above. It was
hoped that the swirl velocity in this lower region would be high enough 50 that
the outer periphery would operate free of bubbles. Thus, fluid lesking upward
through the labyrinth seal between the impeller and the casing would pass into
the expansion tank where it would be violently agitated and mixed with bubbles.
" This bypass flow from the high pressure region at the impeller discharge into
the low pressure region in the expansion tank would be returned to the impeller
inlet through holes in the periphery of the swirl chamber under the expansion
tank. It should be noted that the resistance of the main fuel system was simu-
lated in the model of Fig. A.l by a set of twelve 1/4-in.-dia orifices in the
lower of the two disks bounding the annulus into which the impeller discharged.
Thus the main stream flowed directly from the impeller discharge through these |
orifices back to the pump inlet while the bypass flow through the expansion
"tank followed a more devious route. A slinger was mounted on the impeller
shaft :just under the roof of the expansion tank to prevent fuel from entering
the clearance between the shaft snd the heat dam between the expansion tank and
_ the gas seal.
When the model was built and tested, it was found that it performed
substantially as desired except that the swirl velocity in the expansion tank
was not adequate to centrifuge the bubbles out of the fluid returning from
the expansion tank to the impeller inlet. Tengential jets in the floor of the
swirl chamber were drilled from the high pressure region at the pump discharge
to give a higher swirl velocity in an effort to get better bubble separation.
No improvement was obtained. Two features of the pump did perform surprisingly
well, however. The slinger was eminently effective in preventing the entrance
of fluid into the region between the slinger and the seal, and the agitation
and bubble entrainment. of the fuel in the expansion tank gave good promise of

removing the xenon.

The results of this analytical work clearly showed the need for a centri-
fuge operating with at least as high a tip speed as the impeller. On this basis
the impeller was modified as indicated in Fig. A.2 to include a centrifuge cup
on its rear face. Holes were drilled in the periphery of the cup so that fluid
would discharge into the swirl chamber. This arrangement was found to be much
superior to the first model, but it proved difficult to get fluid to flow into
the centrifuge cup at speeds above about 1200 rpm. Various scoops were tried,
including airfoil-shaped radial structs. The latter were hollow with inlet
SCOOpS in their leading edges near the outer periphery so that ram pressure from
swirl in the expansion tank would force fluid through the strut and into the
centrifuge cup. The best of these scoops worked fairly well up to about 1400 rpm,
and would give positive de-aeration at speeds fram about 800 to 1400 rpm.

A careful re-examination of the system led to the decision to make several
major changes. Since the first model had deteriorated considerably in the course
of the several modifications, it was decided that a new model should be built as
shown in Fig. A.3. The baffle or diaphragm at the top of the centrifuge cup was
amitted and the fluid allowed to discharge from the centrifuge through 3/16-in.
holes into the regions behind the impeller vane tips. It was expected that
omitting the diaphragm would increase the liquid level range in the expansion
tank for which it might be hoped that the pump could operate. The centrifuge
cup was made as long as possible in the space available to minimize the radial
through<flow: vélocity. A new type of scoop was designed to fit in the bottom
of the expansion tank to lift the fluid through the annulus between the tank
wall and an internal liner, and deliver it to the centrifuge. This srrange-
ment was found to be satisfactory in every respect except that, at high speeds,
if the liquid level dropped so that the free surface of the expansion tank
vortex dropped below the top of the céntrifuge cup, the fluid would be thrown
off the stheel intermittently and long streamers of air would extend down to and
into the labyrinth seal at the top of the impeller and severe bubble entrain-

ment in the main stream would result.

Separating the expansion tank from the pump impeller seemed - to be a
promising arrangement if sufficient agitation could be produced by jet action
to take care of both xenon removal and pumping the bypass flow from the expan-
sion tank to the centrifuges. A circular tank between the two pumps as shown
in Fig. 3.10 was designed to accomplish both functions. Tangential jets in the
bottom of the tank were designed to allow fluid to discharge from the high’
pressure region at the pump discharge into the expansion tank, which would run
at essentially pump impeller inlet pressure. The large scale swirl induced in
the expansion tank could be made to entrain gas bubbles through the use of
aspirator tubes. The ram pressure on tangential scoops in the outer walls should
serve to pump fluid through the scoops to the centrifuge chamber. |

CENTRIFUGE THEORY AND CALCULATIONS

The centrifuges serve two purposes essential to the system. First, they
remove "the mixture of helium and enert fission gases from the fuel before it
‘reenters the main fuel system; and . secondly, ‘they serve as pumps to return the
fuel to the main system under pressure.

The ability of the centrifuges to remove “the gas ‘bubbles from the fuel
depends primarily upon four factors: the speed of rotation of the centrifuges,
the radial distance to the point of discharge, the velocity of radial flow
through the centrifuges, and the size of the bubble to be removed.

The relationship between these. factors may be shown as ‘follows:

The drag force on an object vith motion relative to a Fluid ‘is glven

by the ‘equation oo
of
Fa = Ca 2a og A
where oo
Fs = drag force (1b)
Ca = coefficient of drag
FP = ‘density of the fluid (1b-£¢” 3,
V. = velocity of the “object relative 0 the fluid
(ft-sec” Ly
_g. = gravitational acceleration rise?)
A = area of object projected to the flow (£t°).

The centripetal (flotation) force on a bubble in a rotating fluid (assuming

density « of! object 4 is negligible) is given by the eguation

Joh L3 3
Fo = 3. Ir p=
where a
= centripetal force (Ib)
= bubble radius (ft)

a
ty (sec )

= radial dis noe from center of rotation to
center of bubble (ft).

For the relative motion between the centrifuge cup and the bubble to be

zero, the two forces mist’ be equal.

The value of Cy is is a function of Reynold's Number and is as shown in | Fig.
B. 1.(10) Figs. B.2 and B.3 are plots of radial liquid velocity versus bubble
radius for zero relative motion between the bubble and the centrifuge cup. The
radial distance to the bubble is assumed to be 2- 7/8 in. in each case.

The above analysis indicates several desirable design features, namely, a
large diameter centrifuge to increase the centripetal force on the bubble and
also reduce the radial velocity, a tall cup to reduce the radial velocity and
a high speed to increase the centripetal force on a bubble. The diameter and
height of the cup are limited by shielding considerations and the speed is
limited by the main fuel pump design.

Another method of increasing the effectiveness of the centrifuge is to
increase the area of the holes that feed fuel back to the main system. This
reduces the radial velocity of the fluid at the periphery where the centrifuge
is most effective. This also reduces the tendency for the radial flow through
the holes to disrupt the pressure field set up by the rotating. liquid.

It has been calculated that any bubble smaller than approximately 0.003 in.
radius will pass out of the ART centrifuge if it reaches the exit holes when
operating at 2700 rpm on Fuel 30 (see Fig. B.2). It is probable that there
exists a point. at a smaller radius and lower radial velocity where bubbles
smaller than 0.003 in. radius will be screened. The number of these small
bubbles which enter the system is a function of the surface tension of the
liquid. With clear water ‘the number of bubbles entering the systen was very
small, By adding a small amount of soap, thus decreasing the surface tension,
the system became very cloudy from the air bubbles passing through the centri-
fuges. - All of the fuels presently being considered have a surface tension ap-

proximately twice that of water.
* The length dimension in the Reynold sige is the diameter of the bubble.

Soe

-116-

 
The second function of the centrifuge is to deliver the stripped fuel to
the system under pressure. The pressure delivered by the centrifuge is a
function of the outside diameter of the cup and either the diameter of the
free surface when the cup is not running full or the inside diameter of the.
centrifuge top when the cup is flooded. The pressure buildup in a rotating
fluid with-no flow is identical to that of a radial vane. pump. As the thorough -
flow increases, there will ve some slippage between the cup and the fluid, giving
a pumping characteristic similar to that of a pump with backward swept vanes.
There will also be ‘a pressure drop across the outlets from the centrifuge de-

pending on the through flow and hole sizes.

DYNAMIC SEALS
DYNAMIC SEALS

In the X-R system seals ‘are required in two critical locations, namely,
on the shaft to prevent fuel leakage up into thé bearing housing and in. the
region of the pump to prevent high pressure fuel from lesking around the
centrifuges. In the case of ‘the upper slinger seal, no leakage can be tole-
rated, while in the ‘centrifuge seal a small amount of leakage, properly directed,
does not seriously affect ‘the system. The centrifuge seal is essential to the
system for two reasons: 1) to determine the pressure in the main fuel ¢ircuit,
and 2) to control the amount of leakage. All fuel which passes through the
centrifuge seal is recirculated through the centrifuge, thus increasing the
radial velocity and: consequently ‘the size of the bubbles which will escape to
the main fuel circuit.’

A very similar sealing arrangement was used for each location. The shaft
seal used was a slinger attached to the shaft (see Fig. 1.2). The potential
delivery pressure of this slinger was greater than the pressure of the fuel in
the region of the seal. As the theoretical pressure rise across the seal was
greater than its discharge pressure; a gas pocket exists around the shaft.

In the case of the centrifuge seals, radial vanes were attached to the top
of the centrifuge cups (see Fig. 3.8). For this arrangement to stop all leak-
age, the discharge pressure from the seals must exactly match the pressure from
the centrifuges. This condition would be impossible to maintain in operation.
In the actual system a radial vane impeller was designed to deliver a pressure
slightly less than that fram the centrifuges. The leskage around the centri-
fuge cups will then be so directed that no fuel bypasses the centrifuges. As
the head potential of the seal and the centrifugecare very close, the leakage
is small and the additional flow through the centrifuge is held to an accept-
able amount. Figure C.l shows the head delivered as a function of vane length
or cup diameter for various speeds. The net head delivered may be determined
by subtracting the pressure corresponding to the inside diemeter from that

for the outside diameter.

-123-

 
EE. )

Figures C.2 through C.5 give the amount of leakage through the centri-
fuge seals as a function of speed and the difference in pressure delivered
by the centrifuges and seals for several axial clearances. These axial
clearances are the distance from the top of the seal vanes and the stationary
plate above (see Fig. 3.8). CL Co

As the speed increases, the difference in pressure delivered by the centri-
fuges and the seal impellers will increase and the flow delivered by the centri-
fuges will also increase. In order to reduce the bypass leakage caused by the
larger pressure differential, it is necessary that the holes in the centrifuge
cups be slightly restrictive. This restriction will also add stability to the
system by enabling it to sense and counteract any variations in leakage.

Tt was found experimentally that the ability of the system to screen gas
bubbles depended upon the precision with which the centrifuge seal impellers
were made. ‘One unit in which the blades were glued in place passed bubbles
very badly. Upon replacing these seals with new ones in which the vanes were
milled into the top of the centrifuge cups, the system operated satisfactorily.

Figure C.6 gives head and speed characteristics of a seal at no flow

conditions.

To. align the fluid along the shroud with the blade, the streamline of the
fluid along the shroud is assumed to follow a portion of a two to one ellipse.
‘The relative entrance angle of this streamline is equal to By and the relative
exit angle equal to By. The ordinate of this partial ellipse represents the
arc length of the fluid passage at the shroud in a plane parallel to the pump
centerline, and the abscissa represents the circumferential distance along the
shroud blade trace in a plane perpendicular to the shaft centerline. The arc
length of the partial ellipse is the arc length of the blade trace in the plane
perpendicular to the shaft centerline. The fluid passage arc length is obtained
from the pump layout as shown in Fig. D.2. The angles By and By are determined
by W and U. The tangents of By and Ps are the tangents of the ellipse at the
blade entrance and exit. With these values, “the portion of the ellipse between
By and Bs is defined as is shown in Fig. D.2.

the shroud contour in a plane parallel to the shaft centerline. This construc-
tion is done by plotting on the plane perpendicular to the shaft. centerline
concentric circles (see Fig. D.Ub) whose radii are the distance from the shaft
centerline to a set of arbitrarily chosen points. on the shroud contour (see
Fig. D. ha). oo i ’

Starting at the ‘discharge end of the blade, measure a chord length (c) ob=-
tained from Fig. D.4tc on an average circle as shown in Fig. D. bp, ‘and connect its
termination to the shaft center. The point of intersection of this radian and
the next smaller concentric circle lies on the shroud blade trace. This process
is continued as shown in Fig. D.4b until the smallest concentric circle is
reached. The points of intersection obtained determine the blade trace as
shown in Fig. D.2.. oo

‘The shape of ‘the blade blank is determined from the blade trace and the
fluid passage, Figs. D.5a and D.5b. Plane sections perpendicular to the refer-
ence radius are taken through the blade as shown in Fig. D.5a, as sections A,

B, C. etc. These sections are constructed as shown in Fig. D.5c with the

 
distance "a" obtained from Fig. D.5a and the distance. ng obtained from Fig..
D.5b. From the plane. ‘sections shown in Figs. D.5a and D. 5c, sections -B, E,

F, etc., parallel to the reference perpendicular plane are constructed. The
center:of curvature and radii of these sections is also the center of eurva-..
ture and radii of the blade ‘blank. The blade mean. line. and ‘blank is laid out
from these radii as shown in Fig: .D. 5a. Since this impeller is of welded con-

struction, it was desirous to make the blades and fluid passage parts of sur-

required to closely determine the bypass flow rate directly was greater
than the accuracy of the data that could be obtained. This is especially
true at the lower expansion tank liquid levels where the systen (pressure)
fluctuations were quite large. ’

An equation Was derived to determine the pressure losses in the bypass
circuit, that is, from the pump suction to the expension tank. This circuit
was then tested ‘separately with water to determine the validity ‘of the de-
rived equation. "In the water tests the shaft sand spool piece were not rotat-
ing so that the test was only a check of the assumed loss coefficients. It
was found that the predicted value wes within 4% of the experimental value.
Also a check of the experimentally determined value of bypass flow at high
expansion tank liquid levels agreed very well with the calculated values (see
Fig. 2. 28). The total loss in this circuit was comprised of the following:
1) “the loss entering the punp shaft, 2) the loss entering ‘the four radial
shaft holes, ‘3) the loss entering the four holes in the spool piece, and
Lt) the loss leaving the spool piece. The driving force or pressure differ-
ential was taken as the difference between the pump ‘suction and the expansion
tank pressure plus the head developed in the radial ‘holes which were assumed
to be acting as radial impellers. :

‘The equation used is as follows:

2 2
» = 0.5(11) = a 502) 3 +0. 23(11) =~ + 15 ;
where: :
v, = velocity in the hole up shaft, ft/sec,
ve = ‘velocity at exit of radial spool holes, ft/sec,
op = (Pg - Pg) + oP (head developed by radial holes), Pt.

Calculated bypass flow to the fuel expansion tank through cach pump shaft
is shown in Fig. E.l.

The temperature of the fuel in the expansion tank will depend upon four
factors: 1) the fuel volume in the tank, 2) the total recirculation rate
through the tank, 3) the power density of the fuel in the tank, and 4) the
temperature of the fuel entering. The temperature of the fuel entering the
tank will be approximately that of the fuel leaving the heat exchangers and
will depend on the manner in which the reactor will operate. Figure E.2 shows
the entrance, exit, and equatorial temperatures of the fuel in the core. These
temperatures are based on an operating procedure where the system 1s started
from an isothermal temperature of 1200°F. As the power is increased, the core
equator temperature is held constant until the inlet NaK temperature drops to
1070°F; at higher operating power the NaK temperature is held at 1070°F while
the fuel temperature increases. The power shown in Figs. E.2, E.3, and E.l
is that which is received by the fuel and not the total nuclear power. The
design power to fuel is about 55 Mw.

Figure E.3 gives the expansion tank liquid level as a function of the
power to the fuel. In this figure it is assumed that the reactor is filled
at 1200°F to a level of 1/2 to 3/4 in. The final level was based on the mean
fuel temperature and is approximately 25°F less than that of the core equator
temperature at 55 Mw of power to the fuel. The slight rise in liquid level
from 0 to 20 Mw is due. to a shrinkage in the.reactolr volume. It has been
estimated that the volume decreases by about TO in.”

‘RADIOACTIVITY IN THE ART FUEL
PUMP OIL SYSTEM
 
 
 

RADIOACTIVITY IN THE ART FUEL PUMP OIL SYSTEM

This section treats the transfer of radioactive gases from the expansion
tank region of the ART reactor to the fuel pump lubricating oil system. A
report by W. K. Stair(19) covers tests on the back transfer of helium against
argon in the fuel pump to give some indication of. the ‘back transfer. of xenon
and krypton against helium. Two numerical values from this report were used
for the calculations of this ‘section, i.e., an attenuation of 10% between the
concentration of radioactive gases in the expansion tank region and the con-
centration in the oil catch basin, and a leakage rate of gas from the oil catch
basin to the oil reservoir of 0.8 in.3/day. In determining the leak rate of
0.8 in.3/day, it was assumed that the oil was completely saturated with argon
at the beginning of the test run and that all leakage across the seal was col-
lected in the oil reservoir. The value of 10 for the attenuation in concen-
tration between the fuel expansion tank and the pump seal is a minimum... The
helium concentration in the argon buffer gas used in the experiment reported
by Stair was 107k, hence the actual attenuation in concentration between the
tank and the seal may have been greater.

Because of the short half-lives of the fission product gases the attenua-
tion .in the amount of activity between the fuel expansion tank and the oil
reservoir is greater than the attenuation in gas concentration. Thus the rate
at which the fission product gases enter the oil system is of significant im-

portance.
Method of Calculation

In the ART, as well as in the above mentioned test, 500 liters per day of
buffer gas flows down through the clearance around the pump shaft into the ex-
pansion tank and 50 liters per day will be bled directly from the oil catch
basin. The attenuation of 10 represents the back transfer of helium against
the 500 liters per day of argon. This back leakage was determined from analy-
sis of the 50 liters per day bled from the catch basin. |

To calculate the dose rate near the oil reservoirs all of the radioactive
nuclides are assumed to be concentrated as a point source in. the oil reservoirs.
In the calculations it is assumed that the 3/8 in. thick steel wall of the
reservoir will give no attenuation for gamma energies above 0.03 Mev, an attenu-
ation of 10 in the energy range of 0.01 to 0.03 Mev and 75 for energies below
0.01 Mev, In cases where the exact percentages of the gamma, energies are not
known, the maximum possible percentages are used. The data for yields, ener-
gies, and percent gammas are taken from Blomeke (16) The data for dosages

are taken from Rockwe11 (17),
Calculation:Results

The results of the calculations are given in Table F.1l. Columns 6 and 7
give the PB and y energy release rates in the fuel expansion tank. These are
equal to 15.7.and 0.1 Kw, respectively. Column 9 tabulates the disintegration

per sec of each nuclide and Column 10 converts the PB energy release of these

~160-
   

disintegrations to Mev/sec. Columns 9 and 10 refer to the activity and Foray
release of only one of the two oil systems. Column 11 gives the y dose at a
distance of 1 ft from either of the two fuel pump oil reservoirs. This y dose
rate is about 30 mr /hr at a distance of 1 £t ‘and is tnversely proportional to
.the square of the distance from these reservoirs. . ]

The approximate volume of oil in each pump lubricant system is 30 gal.
If the total B emitters in the oil are assumed equally dispersed throughout
the system, the dose to the oil is found to be about 20 rads/hr. This dose for
500 hr of operation at 60 Mw after equilibrium is reached amounts to 10% rads,
which is insignificant compared to the 10° rads which the oil is capable of ab-
sorbing without serious damage. .

If one distinguishes between the fission gases and their daughter ‘products,
it is found that the fission gases account for about 70 to 75. per cent of the
total activity in the oil system but only 25 per cent of the y dose calculated

in Column 11. = °

Xe? POISONING

This final section is concerned with the xenon poisoning in the ART.

In the calculations which follow the removal of Xe12? by neutron capture
is neglected. As the neutron capture rate of removal is only about 5% of
the total removal rate, the calculations will not be greatly affected. Also;
the: results for poisoning will be conservative in that it would be smaller
were the burnup rate considered.

The derivation for the equilibrium xenon concentration in the fuel can
best be followed by referring to Fig. G.l. The total fuel flow through the
expsnsion tank including the leakage around the island is about 23 gpm or
1450 cm/sec. | The helium flow rate is treated as a parameter and is varied
from 1000 to 5000 liters/day at standard temperature and pressure. The
solubility (18) of xenon in fuel is shown in Fig. G.2. If the value of the
sparging efficiency is defined as -

For equilibrium conditions, vy must be equal to the rate of formation of
xenon minus its decay before reaching the sparger and is the rate at which
xenon enters the sparger and thus the expansion tank. This term is the
same as ‘the source to the expansion tank as defined in Appendix F, ‘and is:
shown in the last column of Table G. ole The value of Pe can be determined

-165-

from the total xenon nuclides in the expansion tank. The value for the total
nuclides present are taken for the case where the free gas volume in the ex-
pansion tank is 90 in.>, and the method of calculation is again the. same. as
Appendix F.-

The nuclides of each xenon which is present in any appreciable amount
is shown in Table G.l. A total pressure of 2 atm and a temperature 1300°F
were used to determine the partial pressure of xenon. The partial pressures
at helium flow rates of from 1000 to 5000 standard liters per day are given.
in Table G.l. - Substituting the values in Table G.1 in Eq. (2) gives the
Xenon concentration in the fuel. Figure G.3 gives the total xenon concen-
tration in the fuel for helium flow rates of 1000 and. 5000 standard liters
per day. Also shown in Fig. G.3 is. the Xe 135 concentration in the fuel.
This was obtained by taking 14% of the total xenon (the percent shown in
Table G.1 is 13.63). oo

The Xel? poisoning 19) in the reactor is the number of thermal neutrons
absorbed by the xe? to those absorbed by the fuel or

For a fuel with 5 mole % of UF), the ©? concentration is about .

mately 22% of the xenon cross section is scattering, the value of ¥ © pF is

multiplied by 0.78. Therefore

P= h66x 1078 pe. | (1)

The results of Eq. OD) are shown in Fig. G.4 (upper curve). This equation
is only for the poisoning effect on the ‘thermal ‘neutrons. . In the ART about
40% of the neutrons reach thermal energy. The lower curve of Fig. G. i shows
the poisoning based on the total neutron density of the reactor and is
assumed to be 40% of that for the thermal neutrons. This is a gross simpli-
fication of the actual case, but in the present reactor in which the purge

-166-
rate is high compared to the em rate te assumption should be fairly
accurate. -

The effect of the poisoning may be more easily understood by comparison
to the temperature coefficient » which for the ART is expected to be about
2x10 w/e F. Thus, a poisoning of 1 x 10° -3 is equivalent to a temperature
change of 50° F. ‘

: - ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS |

A: pumber of pecple and groups played important roles in the design
and development of the ART fuel pump and xenon removal system. The authors
are indebted to the following: people: oo

' W. Lowen contributed to the design of the attitude-stable
xenon removal system.

E. T. 0'Rourke was ‘responsible for the’ assembly and function-
ing of all equipment involved in the Plastic models of the
xenon removal system.

G. D. Whitman and J.J.W. Simon followed the assembly and
construction and subsequently operated the iron fuel pump
and the combined Inconel fuel pump and xenon removal system
test loops, respectively.

We G. Cobb and L. Wilson were responsible for the layout of
the fuel pump and xenon removal system. :

The authors also wish to thank the members of the Power Plant Engi-
neering and ‘Experimental Engineering Groups of the Aircraft Reactor Engi-
neering Division for their contributions and assistance in the design and
development of the ART fuel pump and xenon removal system.
