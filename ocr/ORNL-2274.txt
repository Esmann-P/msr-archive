FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at ORNL
records the technical progress of the research on circulating-fuel reactors and other ANP
research ot the Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided into
five mojor parts: 1. Aircraft Reactor Engineering, 2. Chemistry, 3. Metallurgy, 4. Radia-
tion Damage ond Fuel Recovery and Reprocessing, ond 5. Critical Experiments and
Reactor Shielding.

The ANP Project personnel are engaged in many phases of reseorch directed toward
the achievement of nuclear propulsion of aircraft. A considerable portion of this research
is performed in support of the work of other organizations participating in the national
ANP effort. However, the bulk of the ANP research at ORNL is directed toward the
development of a circulating-fuel type of reactor.

The design, construction, and operation of the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART), are the
current objectives of the project. The ART is to be a power plant system that will in-
clude o 60-Mw circuloting-fuel reflector-moderator reoctor and adequate means for heat
disposal. Operation of the system will be for the purpose of determining feasibility and
for studying the problems associated with the design, construction, and operation of a

high-power circulating-fuel reflector-moderated aircroft reactor system.

SUMMARY

PART 1. AIRCRAFT REACTOR ENGINEERING

1.1, Aircraft Reactor Test Design

Tests ore under way or have been proposed
with which to evaluate the ART structural design
criteria, since experience in the design of
structures for operation at temperatures in excess
of J000°F is limited and in general not directly
applicable. The high operating temperature will
greatly affect the creep ond relaxation of the
structure, and temperature cycling will couse strain
The only test completed in this study
thus far was the initial core-shell low-frequency
The results of this
one test indicate that the strain-cycling criterion
used for the core shells is conservative. In-
formation on strain-cycling and creep character-
istics of Inconel, as well as on the effects of

exchanger tests that ore now under woy. An
attempt to predict the life of the heat exchanger
revealed the need for creep measurements of
Inconel in fused salts at rates
expected in the reactor.

The distribution of stresses in the various shells
that will result from design-point temperature and
pressure profiles is being analyzed. Shells V

and final designs for the junctions of these shells
have beon prepared on the basis of the anolyses.

Efforts are being made to predict the stress-
rupture life of tubes subjected to a bending stress
on o short section. The results of this study
indicate that the calculated maximum stress is
quickly reduced to about 80% of the predicted
elostic value and remains essentiolly constont for
the life of the member. The study also indicated
that constant-stress data are required for calcu-
lations of this type, rather than constont-load data.
An experimental attempt to verify the ‘‘reduced-
stress effect’’ is being made.

Detailed stress analyses of the ART fin-type
NaK-to-air radiators are under way. Several critical
areas in the design hove been identified, and

 

alterotions required by stress considerations have
been made. Studies were made of weight ond air
drag loads, relative thermal expansion between
fins and header, and relotive thermal expansion
between adjacent tubes in the event of flow
stoppage as a result of oxide plugging.

Series of tests ond experiments are under way
in order to determine the fatigue life of Inconel
under simulated ART conditions, since the core
shells might be subjected to surface temperature
oscillations as large as 80°F ot frequencies of
from Y to 4 cps. If it is found that Inconel does
not possess adequate fatigue strength, design
modifications moy be required to alleviate the
temperature oscillations. One proposal being
studied provides for mounting a pair of thin Inconel
shells in the core to serve as '‘thermal shields”
for the structural core shells.

Flow studies of the full-scale 21-in. plastic
model of the ART core were continued in order
to investigate wall temperoture fluctuations, which
may be analogous to the fluid temperature fluctu-
otions observed in the one-half-scale volume-heot-
source experiment. Various types of probes and
thermocouple arrangements are being investigated
for use in these studies. The flow-guidance ex-
periments continued with tests of the core entrance
region alone, the core entrance and equatorial
regions simultaneously, and the core island bellows
region within the center volute of the oxial-flow
type of header. Some improvements in flow distri-
bution, both radictly and circumferentially, were
obtained with an inlet guide vane, a conical baffle
plate, and a slotted disk, which wos located 6 in.
above the equator.

1.2. Reactor Physics

The gamma-ray dose rate at the outer surface of
the ART neutron shield was computed as o first
step in a re-evaluation of the shielding of the ART
ond auxiliary equipment, Gamma-ray source
strengths were obtained through the use of two-
dimensional neutron-diffusion calculations.
ondary gamma rays from the lead shield were
neglected, since Lid Tank Shielding Facility

Sec-

WERE xvi
(LTSF) experiments showed that the dose varied
exponentially with lead thickness up to about
4.5 in.; the ART leod is 4.3 in. thick. The LTSF
dota ore interpreted to mean that the intensity of
gamma rays penetrating the 4.3-in.-thick lead
shield of the ART will be much greater than the
intensity of gamma rays produced in the lead.
The calculated dose rate at the surface of the
shield was found fo be 1840 r/hr. The relative
importance of each source is indicated by the
percentage contribution fo the total dose rate:
core, 22%; outer core shell, 9%; reflector, 12%;
reflector sheil, 35%; heat exchanger, 22%.

The fast-neutron dose rate at the shield surface
was computed from LTSF data. It was found that
ot a distance of 50 f+ from the center of the ART
operating at 60 Mw with a 4.3-in.-lead and 31.5-in.-
water shield, the calculated gamma-ray dose is
22.8 rem/tv and the fast-nevtron dose rate is
0.05 rem/hr.

1.3. ART Instruments and Controls

The ART NaK circuit flow-decay characteristics
were investigated as an initial step in evaluating
the significance of a pump power failure in terms
of temperoture and pressure transients in the ART
heat-dump system. Experimental data were ob-
tained for a loop in which an ARTY prototype NaK
pump was being tested ot high temperatures.
During shutdown tests, complete tabulations of
pump shaft revolutions as a function of time were
obtained from which speed vs time dota could be
obtained through numerical differentiation. The
data thus obtained were correlated with computed
volumes of segments of the ART primary Nok
heat-dump circuit.

Tests of commercially available resistance-type
liquid-metal-level tronsducers were continued, and
when the tests were terminated at 3732 hr, during
which time the NeK level of the system was cycled
65,000 times, oaly one of the four instruments was
in operating condition. The other three units failed
becouse NoK seeped into the insulation through
cracks aot the U-bends. The reaction of the NaK
with the insulation caused visible deformation.
ORNL-designed units, which will be clomped into
place rather than welded, are being prepared for
further tests, The ORNL units will have improved
temperature compensation, and the weld design has
been modified.

All-welded resistonce-type on-off level probes
are being developed as replocements for con-
ventional spark-plug probes, which are not suitable
for pressurized systems and temperatures obove
450°F. An especially fabricated spark plug with
a beryllivm oxide insulator was tested in NaK as
on on-off level probe, but it failed in 20 hr of
operation because of short circuiting of the in-
sulastor. Several special plugs with insulators high
in olumino ond mognesium content were received
for testing.

Tests of the helium-bubbler-type fuel-level in-
dicators were continued, and tests to determine
the cause of bubbler plugging were initiated. It
is thought that the materiol which plugs the
bubbler tubes is Zr0,. Special static-level tests
are to be run therefore in which the oxygen content
will be carefully controlled. [tf is hoped that the
present average life of 1100 hr in a static-leve!
system can be increased to the specified 3000 hr.

Evaluation tests of commercial pressure trons-
mitters for use ot high temperatures were continued.
Units that employ differential transformers were
found to be difficult to use because the field of
the Calrod heaters used to maintain the operating
temperature has on effect on the output readings.
A unit that employs o varioble-permeance type of
pressure transducer was unsolisfactory because

of pneumotic-output fronsmitters completed a suc-
cessful 3000-br life test in a NaK-filled test loop.

meters will be acceptable for ETU installation.
Six 2-in. magnetic flowmeters are available for
calibration, and the %-in. models designed for
plug indicators and cold traps are being fabricated.

Two prototype models of remotely adjustable
pressure regulators were tested. These units were
found to be stable under line-voltage, supply-

pressure, and normal ambient-temperature vari-
ations. Life tests are to be run on these
instruments,

A lin. turbine flowmeter ceased to operate after
340 hr of an endurance test scheduled for 3000 hr

in a circulating fused salt.  X-roy examination
showed that the unit was not broken, and it is
thought that oxidation resulting from previous
operation in NaK systems may have caused the
unit to bind. The unit will be removed for ex-
amination when the loop is drained. A 3%-in.
turbine flowmeter operating in a NaK system failed
some time during the first 40 hr of operation.
Disassembly of the loop showed eight of the ten
blades to be missing; the remaining two blades
were bent; and both shafts were broken. The
cause of this failure is being investigated.

Tests of closure welds of Inconel-sheathed
thermocouples in sodium and in fused salts are
under way. The Heliore welding process has been
found to yield 30 to 50% acceptable welds. Bend
tests were made, and single U-bends on a %-in.
radius were found to have little effect on accuracy.
Repeated bending caused a 2 to 3°F shift. The
drift of data obtained with sheathed and with
beaded Chromel-alumel thermocouples as a function
of time and temperature is being studied.

1.4. Component Development and Testing

Irradiation tests of a full-scale ART fuel pump
rotary assembly ore to be run in a gamma-irradiation
facility in the MTR canal. The final selection of
a lubricant-coolant for the reactor pumps will be
based on the results of these tests.

On the basis of further satisfactory test per-
formance, modified Durametollic seals have been
specified for use in the ART NaK pumps. Hf the
irradiation tests show either UCON LB-140-X or
Gulfcrest 34 lubricants to be satisfactory, buna-N-
base O-rings will be specified for the reactor pump

become a problem.

The development tests with water of an oc-
ceptable impeller configuration (designated modet
32) for the ART fuel pump were completed. The
tests showed that flow rate, head, and pumping
power remained fairly constant when the liquid
level in the expansion tank wos reduced from 3 to
% in. Further reductions in the level resulted in
definite decreases in flow rote, head, ond pumping
power.

expansion tonk at 3 in. and the pump operating of

with NaF-Zrf -UF, (50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30) as
the circulated fluid were started. The pump head
is 110 2 ft lower than that obtained with water,
ond this discrepancy is being investigated. Per-
formance and cavitation dota are being obtained.

A similor pump that operated with fuel 30 in an
endurance test was shut down after a total of
2587 hr of operating time and 120 thermal cycles
in the temperature range of 1400 to 1100°F, Ex-
amination showed the pump to be in good condition,
ond it has been cleoned, reassembled with new
seals, ond put back into operation. There was
no trouble with the hydraulic drive during the lost
1240 hr of operation because a back pressure was
maintained on the discharge side of the motor to
ensure that the piston shoes were seated on the
wobble plate af oll times,

in which the pump is installed. Since free move-
ment between the sodium pump barrel and volute
will be required in the ART to ollow for radial
movement, a seal is being developed for this
region to minimize leakoge of sodium between
the heat exchanger inlet and the pump centrifuge
outlet. Two types of multiple-ring seals are being
considered, as well as a simpler seal with a single
ring.

An ART sodium pump is also being tested in an
endurance test with sodium ond has accumulated
1584 fr of operating time with 300 thermal cycles
in the temperature range of 1250 to 1050°F. The
pump priming difficulties encountered previously
were solved by stopping the pump when transferring
sodium to the pot. The off-gos line plugging
problem was resolved by lowering the liquid level
in the pump pot.

High-temperature testing of an ART primary
NoK pump was continued, and performance and
efficiency curves were obtained ot a NoK temper-
ature of 1200°F. The data are in good agreement
with the data obtained with water, An ART
auxiliary NaK pump is being tested with water
and an Inconel impeller in ploce of the brass
impeller used previously. Cavitation performance
of the Inconel impeller has been found to be
entirely satisfoctory. After a vent wos provided
for gos trapped during filling, the pump primed
satisfactorily. A specific fechnigue for starting
and stopping the pump was developed.

Fuel-toNaK heat and NaK-to-air
radiator test operations were continued. One test
was terminated by a NoK leck in the circulating
cold-tfrap economizer after o total of 1845 hr of
operation. The heat exchanger and the radiator
in this system hod been operated nonisothermally
for 1456 hr, including 552 hr at a fuel inlet temper-
ature of 1600°F and 29 thermal cycles. Dato
obtained in this test are being analyzed as part

of a study of mass transfer in a NaK circuit.

A 20-tube semicircular heat exchanger was de-
signed ond is being fabricated that simulates the
tube geometries of the ART main heat exchangers.
This heat exchanger will be subjected to o thermal
cycling program in order to verify the stress
analysis of the ART heat exchangers.

The ART twin fuel pump system was tested
further as part of the water flow tests of the
aluminum north-head mockup. With the improved
model 32 impellers in the pumps, the liquid
spraying and sloshing noted previously in the
expansion tank and the resultant wetting of the
tank ceiling were greatly reduced. The model 32
impeller olso resolved she problem of liquid rising
in the shaft annulus of a stopped pump if the other
pump wos stilt running.

Tests of ART prototype dump valves were con-
tinued. Valves which have rigidly mounted plugs
are now considered to be essential for satisfactory
operation. The seat and plug materials which have
been found to be the most satisfactory are the
Kentonium cermets K.151A vs K-152B and KM vs
K-162B. All tests to date have been made with
fuel 30, but a test stand is now being modified
for tests with NoK.

The second of the two proposed thermal-stability
tests of the outer core shell was started under
conditions similar to those used previously. Di-
mensions were carefully taken for later comparison
with dimensions to be taken after the test.

Orifice plugs were tested for controlling sodium
flow through the cooling hales in the ART be-
ryllium reflector in order to obtain o uniform
temperature throughout the beryllium. A full-scale
wooden mockup of one-half of the symmetrical
sodium circuit in the reflector entrance region was
olso tested. The head ond flow distsibution
measurements obtained in these tests are being
used in design analyses. A water test was also
conducted on a proposed bypass slot to be cut
between the sodium-to-NaK heat exchanger shell

and the external pressure shell of the reactor.
This slot will allow some sodium to bypass the
present slots between the pressure shell ond the
upper-deck outer shell and will provide a more
direct entrance for flow into the heat exchanger
inlet.

The high-frequency thermal-cycling test loop
designed for studying the effect of thermal cycling
on Inconel tubing was completed. The loop has
operated satisfoctorily at design specifications in
water tests, and data are being taken on temper-
ature amplitudes at the test section as a function
of frequency and flow rate. The water tests will
be continued until thorough fomiliarization with
the aperation is achieved.

The plugging indicators that are to be provided
in each of the eight NoK cold-trap circuits of the
ART level were
calibrated against chemical onalyses. The cali-
bration obtained include most of the
practical range of plugging-indicator application.

One set of beryllium island parts is complete,
and work is under way on the pressure shell liner.
The dual effort on fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger
fabrication was evaluated, and Black, Sivalls &
Bryson was selected as the fabricator.

Extensive tests of reactor assembly methods
have been performed, and the assembly procedures
have been developed. The assembly area and
fixtures are almost completed.

Much installation work on the ETU assembly has
been done, and preliminary estimates show an
expected ETU facility completion date, exclusive
of the reactor and its associated equipment, of
September 1, 1958. A further study of the items
to be ploced within the ETU cell that simulates
the ART cell brought about several changes,
including the elimination of the equatorial and
south-head lead shielding. Design of the cell
components (other thon the reactor) is well under
way, and fabrication of mony ifems has been
initiated.

Much of the outside contract work on the ART
focitity has been completed. The work to be done
by ORNL forces on the installation of process
piping ond equipment remains, ond design work
on this phase of the project is well under way.
Procurement was initiated on a few items.

Plans for removing ond sectioning the ART after
operation were studied further. A %,-scale model
of a proposed hot cell is now avoilable as an aid
in visualizing the complex techniques that will
be involved and in designing the tools and fixtures
that will be required.

dicated thot the peak work toad during operation

A study of manpower

As the result of o design review, additional
provisions have been made for the containment
of activity oft the ART focility in the event of
concurrent heat exchanger and radiator leaks; a
number of design and instrument changes have
been incorporated into the system; ond additional
component development tests have been scheduled
to demonstrate the odequacy of the system for the
prescribed test program. Procedures for filling
the various systems were prepared.

The planning for ETU operation is paralleling
that for ART operation, with the maintenance of
ETU flow sheets, instrument lists, ond valve
tabulations being emphasized. A preliminary study
of ART emergency conditions to be simulated with
the ETU is under way.

Procedures for disassembling the ART were
studied further, Possible methods for performing
the remote cutting operations that will be required
within the cell were studied, and several dis-
odvanfoges of a proposed underwater operation
hove developed.

Developmental work is under way on the higher
performance pump and heat exchanger thar will
be required for in-pile loop experiments with the
new nickel-molybdenum alloys and lithium-base
fuels. A pomp is now available that will be
suitable for a loop with maximum temperatures in
the range of 1600 to 1650°F, which correspond to
o pump temperature of 1500°F. In on effort to
increase the copocity of the heat exchanger, a
unit with machined nickel fins has been designed
and is being fabricated for testing.

In-pile tests of moderator materials continued
with the preporation for insertion in the MTR of
copsules containing beryllium oxide, graphite, and
zirconium hydride specimens.
1.7. Heat Tronsfer and Physical Properties

Heat transfer studies with the delta-array heot
exchanger were continued. Flow in the laminar
region wos investigated fo establish the effect
of natural convection on the total heat transfer.
No effect could be observed over the Reynolds
modulus range exomined. The fluid friction chorac-
teristics on the fuel side of a straight-tube model
of the ART fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger were tested
further, with measurements being token down to
a Reynolds modulus of 150. The early transition
in the date indicates the effect of the turbulent
spacer wakes on the system pressure drop. Pre-
liminary designs have been made for an apparatus
to study the heat transfer and velocity structures
in a single fuel-side channel of an ART type of
heat exchanger.

Additional data on the
screens in reactor cores ore to be obtained with
the use of the swirl entrance system. A mathe-
matical onalysis indicated that even under fuel

records have been mode of lominar and turbulent

Quantitative data on the turbulent velocity structure
of water flowing through a circular tube were
obtained by superimposing the velocity profile

A volume-heat-source experiment is plonned with
which to establish the effect of screens on the
thermal structure in the ART core. A series of
vortex tube heat transfer and hydrodynamic ex-
periments have been outlined for determining
quantitatively the characteristics of this system.

PART 2. CHEMISTRY
2.1. Phase Equilibrium Studies

A simple modification was mode to the thermal
analysis apporatus in order to minimize losses
by voporization. With the modified opparatus
it hos been possible to analyze samples containing
up to 80% ZrF, with negligible loss in weight of
the sample.

A new vacuum furnace that is adaptable fo
microscopic observations was developed ond
fabricated for use in visual observation of liquidus

and solidus points and for differential thermol

analyses of small quantities of fused salts.
Preliminary visual observations indicate that
reasonably accurate melt temperatures can be

measured with only 150 mg of material.

Quenching studies of LiF-UF, systems thot
contain 20 to 32 mole % UF, confirmed the
liquidus ond relationships previously
reported. It was found that the compound 4LiF-UF
undergoes very slow subsolidus decomposition to
LiF and 7LiF-6UF, at bout 470°C. Thermal
anclysis studies showed that these mixtures
undercooled readily if the melt wos first heoted to
over 800°C. In order to be sure that the quenching
results characterized the equilibrium conditions,
a seeding experiment wos conducted on a mixture
contoining 24 mole % UF,. The results were in
accordance with the results of the quenching
studies, except thot the temperatures of the thermal
effects were about 10°C lower.

A study of the

similarities of the systems

NaF-HtF and NaF-ZrF, hos revealed three
NaF-HfF, compounds that ore analogous to
NoF-Zrf compounds. The high-temperature

furnace wos used for visual observations of
liquidus temperatures of mixtures in the LiF-CeF
system. A diagrom of the system was prepared.
Examination of slowly cooled melts showed only
LiF and CeF, to be present and confirmed thermal
indications of the absence of complex compounds.

Thermal analysis of the system KF-BeF indi-

cated on incongruent melting point of 390°C and o
peritectic composition with about 52.5 mole %
BeF,. The phase equilibrium diagram for the
system was prepared.

Quenching studies of the system NaF-RbF-BeF,
were initiated. For mixtures containing 33.3 ond
40 mole % NoF, the ternary compound is the
primary phase, the solidus temperature is 452°C,
ond Rof.BeF, is the other phase below the
solidus. The phase relationships between the
liquidus and solidus have not yet been established.

A large aumber of quenching experiments were
completed thot showed the tentotive phase equi-
librium diagrom presented previously for the

system NaF-LiF-UF, fo be in emor in several

respects. A revised diagram was therefore
prepared.
Phese equilibrium studies of the systems

NaF.CrF -ZrF , NaF-FeF -Z/F , and NaF-NiF -
ZrF, were undertaken in order to determine the
formula and phase relationships of the ternary
compound in each of these systems. Only one
ternary compound wos observed in each system.

In o careful determination of the solubility of
nickel as NiF in NaF-ZrF (53-47 mole %) at
550°C, a volue of 352 + 11 ppm was obtained.
The dota indicated that the solubility remecined
constant when the omount of saturating phase
changed from a trace fo a total of 1310 ppm Ni**.
Further, the value of 352 is in substantial agree-
ment with a value of 400 ppm previously reported
for the solubility obtained with an oddition of
1700 ppm Ni **.

Additional experiments on the reduction of UF

reaction showed that the chromium concentration
increases in the order of use of RbF, KF, NaF,
Lif, which is the order of decreasing ion size.
Additional data on the reaction of UF, with Cr®
in the RbF-Zrf, reaction medium at 600 ond at
800°C indicate that the fluoride
increases only slightly when the RbF concentration
is increased from 50 to 58 mole %.

Rore-earth Huorides labeled with Ce 141, La'40,
and Sm'33 were used to study the solubilities of
CeF, and LoF,
Sm, alone and in combination with CeF, in
NoF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %) at vorious tem-
peratures. The addition of both LaF and SmF,
decreased the solubility of CeF,. Similarly addi-

A direct equilibration method was used for

1.25 x 103 moles of HF per cubic centimeter of

and processes for dissolution of solid fuel
elements for uranium recovery.

NaF-ZrF mixture. In order to obtain more infor-
mation regarding the chonge of solute activity

under way to develop more reliable types of Daniell
cells and to measure a series of these cells in
ditferent media with varying but dilute concen
trations of the metal fluorides, NiF,, FeF,,
CrF,, and possibly other solutes.

The possibility of obtaining activities from emf
measurements of molten and solid solutions of
salts was studied further with measurements of the
LiCl-AgCl system. The main deterrent to the
application of similor techniques to fluoride fuels
is the lack of a suitable substitute for a fluorine
electrode.

Electromigration in molten salts has been shown
to be a successful means for separating isotopes,
ond therefore it is of interest to determine the
usefulness of this technique for the presumably
eosier problem of separating ions of different
elements in fuel Some preliminary
experiments with Li* and Ni ** ions in a chloride
melt shawed that if the chloride lattice is con-
sidered to be stationary, the Li* ions moved about
20 times faster than the Ni** ions.
electromigration should be a very efficient means
of recovering Li from o spent fuel, but the

formidable problems. Even the chloride systems

standpoint.

2.3, Theory of Molten Fluoride Behavior

An attempt hos been made to correlate the
behavior of molten Huorides on the basis of chorge-
to-ion radius (Z/ R) roties. If the Z/R ratios of
the salts in o mixture differ
especially if the salts are of widely different

considerobly and

valence states, the extra stobility of the mixture
will be large, and the structure will be considerably
distorted in comparison with the structures of the
component salts, that is, the larger the difference
in Z/R ratios, the more stable the mixture relative
to its components. For components which mix
without o change in coordination number and with
little distortion, the negative deviation from ideal
solution behavior is accounted for, in general, by
a decrease in cation repulsive energy upon mixing.

 

XXiv

It is also coavenient to correlate the behavior of
the complex molten fluoride mixtures in terms of
the attraction between the fluoride ions ond
neighboring cations. The ions in a solution tend
fo arrange themselves
energy. Accordingly, the mutual energy value
determines the position of the fluoride ions with

in positions of lowest

respect to oltornative cations, and fluoride ions
will prefer as nearest neighbors those cations
which yield the largest Z/R ratios. An increase
in the difference in the Z/R ratios of the cations
of a fluoride solution will resvit in an increase
in the negative deviations from ideal solution
behavior shown by the mixture.

A useful qualitative model for describing the
liquid structure of fuel mixtures based on the
NaF.ZrF system was devised in which liquid
ZeF , is considered to be a somewhat disorganized
lattice of fluoride bridges connecting zirconium
ions. The addition of NaF to Z¢F , results in the
breaking of the bridges to give zirconium ions
which are surrounded partially by bridging fluorides
Since the
complexing potentialities of o fluoride melt depend
on the fluoride ion activity, it is very important to
know how this activity, which conaot be measured,
varies with composition.

and partially by nonbridging fluorides.

The fluoride ion activity con be correlated in a
qualitative manner by an acid-base scheme in
which cations are rated according to their tendency
to behave as fluoride donors or acceptors. If
fluoride denors ore defined as bases and fluoride
acceptors as acids, the cations fall into the same
general pattern as thot used for the classification
of oxides as acidic or basic. The NaF compound
is on exomple of a sirong base and ZrF, of a
strong acid.

In order to map the relative acidity of o fuel
solvent, Z/R ratios are plotted vs solvent compo~
sition. Such a plot permits estimates of the
relative negative deviations of solutes, and, hence,
also relative solubilities in case the pure solute

2.4. Physical Properties of Molten Materials

The vapor pressures of the less volatile

components in fuel mixtures are being studied.
In order to determine the vopor species, the
absolute vapor pressures of molten alkali fluorides
were measured by a quasi-static method, A suf-
ficiently wide temperature range was covered to
give curvature on a log p vs 1/7 plot. Equations
were established ond constants evaluated for the
compounds LiF, NaF, KF, RbF, ond Csf. Tento-
tive estimates were also made of the percentage
of monomeric molecules in the saturated vapor of
the various molten alkali fluorides.

A preliminary value for the density of molten
UF | was obtained for use in o determination of the
surfoce tension. At 1075°C, a density of
6.80 * 0.09 g/cm® was found by using graphite
pycnometers. The density of the molten material
being greater than that of solid UF, (6.63 g/cm®
based on x-ray data) and the behavior of the salt
surface level upon freezing in the pycnometer
indicate that UF, either contracts or expands
only very slightly upon melting.

2,5. Production of Purified Fluoride Mixtures

The hydride of yttrium is being studied for use
as a moderator in high-temperature reactors.
Considerable quantities of YF, (~1400 g) were
therefore prepared for use in manufacturing the
metallic yttrium from which the hydride is prepared.

The product of the reduction of MoF with FeF
was collected in o condenser and redistilled, and
the yellow product was found to melt at 78°C
rather than the 60°C previously reported for the
material before distillation. It has not yet been
determined conclusively that the material is MoF ,.

In the pilot-scale equipment, 42 batches were
processed that totaled 1575 Ib of various fluoride
compositions, with a mejor portion of the material
being Naf-KF-LiF-UF (11.2:41-45.3-2.5 mole %).
Nickel storage receivers are unsatisfactory for
the lithium-bose mixture because of the large
exponsion of the material upon melting. Inconel
cons are now being used for 50-Ib batches, but
when inadvertent exposure of the mixture fo air or
water occurs in Inconel cans, extensive contami-
nation of the melt with CrF, and FeF, results.
Since

material must be discarded,

In the production-scale facility 46 batches

was dispensed in botch sizes ranging from 1 to
250 Ib. Approximately 4000 Ib of processed
fluorides and 2500 Ib of liquid metals were charged
into test units.

2.6. Compatibility of Materials ot High
Temperature

The study of the penetration of graphite by
molten fluorides was continued. An experiment
was performed in which commercial APC graphite
was impregnated with Naf-ZrF (53-47 mole %)
and then subjected fo a sublimetion step in order
to raise the melting temperature of the residual
to above that of the uranium-becring
mixture. The sublimation procedure increased
the NaF-to-Z:F ratio in the graphite, with the
final ratio being about 16:1. This material wil)
be tested in o molten uranium-bearing mixture to

determine whether a solid impregnating material
will resist penetration.

Two types of graphite (code Nos. R-28 and M-80)
obtained from the National Carbon Company were
immersed in Naf-ZeF UF (53.5-40-6.5 mole %)
ofter impregnation with Naf-ZrF , (53-47 mole %).
Examinations revealed that these specimens were
not penetrated to ony considerable degree by either
of the salt mixtures.

{t hos been established through electrolytic
studies of the NaOH-Ni system that in a non-
isothermal system the hot nickel electrode is
usually anedic and the cold electrode is cathodic.
This situation can, however, be reversed by the
use of a hydrogen atmosphere. Since NaOH is o
potential moderator-coolant material, attempts are
being made to balance the current in an effort to
find o way to eliminate the moss-transfer effects
observed in NaOH circulated under a temperature
gradient.

In service tests of valve seat materials exposed
to helium saturated with NaK vapor, G-E SE-550
and SE-450, Dow-Corning Silastic-80, and Du Pont
5570 withstood NaK fairly well, with SE.550
possibly being superior to the other materials.

PART 3. METALLURGY

3.1. Dynamic Corrosion Studies

Three forced-circulation loops fabricated of
Hastelloy B were examined thot had circulated
NaF-KF-LiF-UF {11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel
107) at a maximum fluid temperature of 1650°F.
Two of the loops operated with maximum wall
semperotures of obout 1750°F ond showed no
evidence of mass transfer after 407 and 1000 hr,
respectively. A third loop, which operated with @
maximum wall temperature of 1710°F and at a
relatively low flow rate, showed slight evidence of
deposits near the pump. The hot legs of afl loops
were found to be badly pitted after the tests, but

OnE
much of the surface roughness could be attributed
to the condition of the inner surfaces of the tubing
before the tests.

An Inconel forced-circulotion loop was operated
with NaF-ZrF UF, (50-464 mole %, fuel 30) ar
a maximom fluid emperarure of obout 1700°F
and a maximum wall temperature of 1840°F. After
1000 hr of operation the loop was found to have
been attacked to a depth of 9 mils, and there were
some deposits in cold-leg sections. The fuel
mixture No. 70, NaF-ZrF UF, (56-39-5 mole %),
was tested in another Inconel forced-circulation
loop operated at o fluid temperature of about
1500°F. Loop operotion was terminated after
716 hr, and attack to a depth of 5 mils was found
in the hot leg. A thin metallic layer wos afso
noted in the cold feg. An examination of another
Inconel  forced-circulation loop that operated
500 hr with fuel mixture No. 30 also revealed hot-
leg attack to a depth of 5 mils, but no cold-leg
deposits were found.

An evalustion was made of the effectiveness
of cold traps in the removal of oxide impurities
from circutating NaK and the resultant effect on
mass transfer in Inconel-NeK forced-circulation
foops. Cold traps maintained at temperatures of
100, 300, 600, and 800°F, respectively, were
utilized in conjunction with loops operating at a
maximum NoK temperature of 1500°F ond a fluid
temperature drop through the loop of 300°F. A
definite increase in the amount of deposit ma-
terial was noted in the loop which contained the
cold trap operated at 800°F os compared with
the loop having the cold trap operated at 600°F.
The change in the amount of deposited material
accompanying a decrease in the cold-trap temper-
ature below 600°F was less thon the change from
800 to 600°C. The average sizes of the particles
comprising the deposits also varied with the
cold-trap temperature, becoming coarser as the
cold-trap temperature increased. The deposits
found in these NaK systems were less than one-
half the weight of deposit found in sodium systems
operated under similar temperature and time con-
ditions.

Two laconel-sodium loops
which operated at flow rates of 1.5 and 3.0 gpm
were also examined. The maximum sodium temper-
ature in these tests was 1500°F, and the temper-
ature gradient was 300°F. Operation of the loops
for 1000 he ot the higher flow rate produced

forced-circulation

 

deposited material that weighed 14 g compared
with 10.4 g for the loop operated with the lower
flow rate. The average thickness of the deposit
was also higher in the loop operated with the
higher flow rate.

A type 304 stainless steel forced-circulation
loop after operation with sodium at 1500°F showed
only slight traces of mass-transfer deposits. This
loop was operated for 1000 hr with a thermal
grodient of 300°F.

Long duration tests of Inconel forced-circufation
loops were made with both NaK and sodium circu-
lated at a maximum fluid temperature of 1500°F.
The test with NoK, for which a temperature
gradient of 600°F was used, was terminated ofter
2760 hr. The cooled section of this loop was
found to contain extensive crystolline deposits
that ronged to 14 mils in thickness. The loop
operated with sodium for 4000 hr with o temper-
ature gradient of 800°F showed considerobly larger
deposits thot reached a thickness of 50 mils in
some areos.,

Thermal-convection loops fabricated from various
experimental nickel-molybdenum alloys were tested
with sodium and with NeF-KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41-
45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107), for 1000 and 500 hr,
respectively, at maximum fluid temperatures of
1500°F. There was attack by the fuel mixture to
on average depth of 1.5 mils in all loops except
those constructed of alloys containing aluminum
additions. For the alloys containing oluminum a
maximum depth of attack of 3 mils was found.
Correspondingly the pickup of aluminum by the
fuel was high in the loops fabricated from alloys
containing aluminum. Similarly
picked up by fuel circulated in alloys containing
tungsten; however, no appreciable increase in
attack accompanied the buildup of tungsten in the
fuel. Vonadium, titanium, and niobium additions

but the fuel picked up slight amounts of titanium
and niobium.

An average hot-leg attack of 1 mil was found in
several nickel-molybdenum alloy loops operated
with sodium, and deposits were visible in the cold
legs. These deposits did not adhere tightly to the
loop woll, and consequently difficulty hos been
encountered in examining them metallographically.

A series of standard Inconel thermal-convection
joops was operated with NaF-Z:F -UF, (50-46-4

results showed that the migration of voids into
Inconel did not proceed when the leaching of the
chromium was stopped.

Three stainless-steel-clad niobium loops showed
only slight hotleg attack in tests with NeF-KF-
LiF-UF, (11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107) at
1500°F; however, some cold-leg deposits were

or longer. A niobium loop was also operated

A seesaw-fumace test of 500 ht at a hof-zone

compatibility of a 15% Mo—6% Cr—bal Ni alloy and
molybdenum when exposed fo No F-KF-LiF-UF,
{11.2-41-45.3-2,5 mole %, fuel 107). The presence
of nickel on the surface of the molybdenum
specimen ofter the test indicoted dissimilar metal
mass transfer. Similar results were found with

loop were quite similar to the results obtoined
with sodium in Inconel thermal-convection loops.

A third sodium-beryllium-Inconel compatibility
test has shown that chromium plating of Inconel
reduces the amount of intermetallic compound
formation to approximately one-third thot found
when Inconel and beryllium are placed in direct
contact. Thermal cycling did not result in spalling
of the Be, Cr phase.

A zirconium specimen exposed to sodium for

3.3, Fabrication Research

The nickel-molybdenum alloys fobricated and
tested thus far have,
resistance ond

in general, significantly

better corrosion strength than
Inconel without sacrifice of fabricability and
weldability, These alloys now eppeor to offer

definite possibilities of use as structural materials
of reactors that utilize more efficient fuels at
higher temperatures. The corrosion resistance of
most of the alloys is equivalent fo that of Hastel-
loy B, and the stress-rupture data for oll olloys
tested show an average life of 400 hr at 1500°F at
a stress of 8000 psi, The fabricability depends
largely upon the kinds ond quantities of elements
added to the basic nickel-molybdenum alfoy, and
with proper control reasonable yields of material
are obtained from laboratory heats.

At present an alloy designated INOR-8, which is
bosed on the Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe system, seems fo best
fulfill all the requirements. In order to investigate
the ronge of mechanical properties developed in
alloys of this system, the tensile and stress-rupture
properties are being determined for a series of
compositions, with the maximum content of the
major components, other than nickel, being 20% Mo,
10% Cr, and 10% Fe. The alloys tested to date
with {ow and intermediate contents of Mo, Cr, and
Fe are ofl stronger than Inconel and opproach the
strength of type 316 stainless steel. There is
evidence that alloys with higher Mo, Cr, ond Fe
content will respond to aging and show even
higher strengths.

A series of alloys designated INOR-9 are being
investigated, in which the elements Cr, Al, Ti,
ond W have been eliminated because of their poor
corrosion resistance in fuel 107. Alloys with o
maximum of 15% Mo and with significant additions
of niobium and iron were prepared, and the limits
of solubility and oxidation behavior were de-
termined.

Six tube blanks of each of three nickel-molybdenum
base olloys prepored at ORNL have been extruded
and submitted to Superior Tube Co. for redrawing
to tubing. These alloys were designed for studies
of the effect of 10% Cr and 7% Fe, singly and to-
gether, on the corrosion resistance of a 17% Mo—bal
Ni base alloy.

Sheet, plate, wire, and bar products fabricated
from the six 4800-1b heats designated INOR alloys
1 through 6 have been received. Alloys INOR-4
and INOR-& became virtually 100% scrap because
of fabrication difficulties, while alloys INOR-2
and INOR-5 were processed with considerable
success, The tube shells of the INOR alloys, two
each of INOR alloys 1, 2, and 5 and one each of
INOR alloys 3 and 6, are presently being tube
reduced for conversion to smotl-diometer seamless
tubing at Superior Tube Co.

The contract with the Westinghouse Electric
Corporation covering the fabrication of large pilot
heats of nickel-molybdenum base alloys has been
signed, and work will begin immediately. Initially,
one 3600-ib heat of alloy INOR-8 will be cast and
fabricated into sheet, plate, wire, bar, and tube
products for evaluation.

Various techniques are being utilized in studying
the phase relationships of the Ni-Mo and Ni-Mo-Cr
alloy systems under a subcontract at the University
of Tennessee. Results show that the beta ond
gammo phoses transform at somewhot higher tem-
peratures than those previously reported.

A total of 16 tube blanks of four Ni-Mo base
alloys which were extruded for Battelle Memorial
Institute last quarter failed during tube reduction
at Superior Tube Co. These processing failures
substantiate earlier evidence that these alloys
with 0.12% C are not amenable fo tube-drawing
operations. Battelle has prepared new of loys with
a lower carbon content and has submitted twelve
billets of each of two of the alloys to ORNL for
tube-blank fabrication. The tubing processed from
these blanks is scheduled for forced-circulation
loop tests at Bottelle.

Large amounts of composite tubing may be re-
quired ta circumvent mass tronsfer in nickel-base
alloy systems. To demonstrate the feasibility of
producing the material, several composite tube
shells of Inconel over type 316 stainless steel
were processed on a production schedule. Ex-
cellent yields of sound tubing were obtained from
the coextruded material,

Two full-sized gomma-ray shielding plugs com-
posed of tungsten carbide and Hastelloy C were
prepared for the ART fuel pumps. However, a die
failure produced lateral expansion of the plugs,
with the result that the parts are considerably over-
size and will be used only for brazing tests. A
redesigned die has been obtained.

xxix
Continued difficulty in producing the stainless-
stoel-clad Cu-B,C shield material at Allegheny
Ludlum has required considerable coordination and
evoluotion of moterials. Recent work based on
recommendations made by ORNL hos resulted in
good yields of sound material.

In attempts to eliminate lack of ductility resulting
from stringering of fine dispersions of Lindsay
Oxide, a technique was developed for producing
dense, hard particles of the desired size, Three
cores for extrusion billets were prepared with this
material dispersed in electrolytic nickel powder.

The recovery and recrystollization of arc-cast
and powder-metallurgy niobium are being studied
prior fo comparing their mechanical properties.
Nearly ideaticol microstructures were finally pre-
pared from the two materials by an initial anneal
at 1450°C followed by severe cold reduction and a
long anneol ot 1250°C. This material will be used
in determining the recrystallization kinetics of the
two types of niobium,

An in-pile test capsule of hydrided zirconium
clad with molybdenum was fabricated. Equipment
for the production of yttrium metal was designed
and built. Studies on the cladding of molybdenum
with nickel-molybdenum afloys were started.

3.4. Welding and Brazing Investigations

An investigation was conducted to determine
optimum brazing procedures for fabrication of the
ART sodium-to-NaK heat exchangers. The most
influential variable was found to be the rate-of-rise
to brazing temperature. A similar investigotion is
being conducted to determine the minimum rate-of-
rise to lxazing temperature required to effect a
satisfactory back braze of the tube-fo-tube sheet
joints of heat exchangers.

The techniques developed previously for the
fabrication of valve components were used in the
preparation of various valve materials for testing
under simulated service conditions,

A study of the problems associated with the
fabrication of the ART fill-and-drain tank is under
way. Tests are being run to establish welding and
brozing procedures and joint designs that will re
sult in crock-free fusion welds. A promising joint
design now being investigated is a trepanned type.

Additional results were obtoined in the investi-
gation of the mechanical properties of Hastelioy B
and W welds on Yin. plate, and the results of all
the tensile test data have been anclyzed. The

Y-in. plate required for welding and brazing studies
of some of the nickel-molybdenum experimentol
olloys wos received ond tests were initiated, No
cracking tendencies were found in tests of INOR-7
and -8,

Results of tests at Rensselaer Polytechnic
Institute on experimental ond commercial nickel-
base alloys indicate that it is usually sufficient
ta evaluate the hot ductility as measured at 2300°F
during cooling from some higher temperature and to
compere these data with the hot ductility measured
at 2300°F during heating. The test results show
that none of the INOR alloys behave in as ductile
o manner os Inconel and thay they behave more
like Inconel X than like Hastelloy B.

The effects of brazing variables on braze ad-
herence in NaK-to-air radiators were studied further
in order to assist the vendor in fabrication prob-
lems. Specific recommendations regarding the
equipment, cleaning methods, and brazing tech-
niques were made,

The initial result of o study of the effect of
brazing and heot-freating operations on the grain
growth of Inconel tubing indicates that stress
relief treatments at 1500°F do not result in grain
growth, Significant grain growth resulted, however,
from Y-hr brazing cycles at approximately 1922°F,
It was also noted thot groin growth proceeded more
rapidly in the grains locoted along the outer wall
of the tube than in those located along the inner
wall, Straightening and polishing operations had
only minor effects on the grain growth, The in
fluence of prior cold work is being studied.

In the molybdenum welding studies under sub-
contract at Battelle Memorial Institute the effect of
atmosphere purity, various types of shields, and
several cleaning techniques were investigated.
Acid etched specimens were somewhat better than
samples prepared by other methods, Also, the use
of a trailing shield in open air welding was found
to yield weldments with
ductility,

significantly greater

3.5. Mechanical Properties Studies

The behavior of Inconel when subjected to re-
peated thermal cycles is being investigated by
means of relaxation tests and mechanically induced
cyclic strain tests at ORNL; the University of
Alabama is contributing to this study by conducting

thermally induced strain cycle tests; and the

the creep characteristics by additions of carbide-
forming elements, such as niobium and tungsten,
without seriously affecting the other good choroc-
teristics. Several alloys of this type have ex-
hibited a stress-rupture life of 1000 hr when
tested in fuel 107 at 8000 psi and 1500°F,

Studies were made of the elevated-temperature
properties of the beryllium blocks being fabricated
for the ART by the Brush Beryllium Co. The tests
indicate that the strength properties do not vary
appreciably from those predicted on the basis of
tests of smaller pressings.

3.6. Nondestructive Testing and Inspection of
Materials and Components

The recently developed Impedograph, which
measures both the a-c resistonce and the reactance
of its testing coil over a wide range of frequencies,
was applied successfully in eddy-current inspec-
tions, This instrument simultaneously presents
inspection information from both the inner ond
outer surface of tubing, regardless of the material
or size of the tube.

Equipment and techniques were developed for
using an eddy-current probe coil to measure the
thicknesses of coatings or cladding. Measurements
made of the cladding thickness on Mark X MTR fue)
plates demonstrated the feasibility of the inspec-
tion techniques. With further experience it should
be possible fo measure cladding thicknesses of
most alloys on a cermet core, of any of the oxida-
tion-resistant alloys over molybdenum or niobium

nickel-molybdenum core, of a nickel-molybdenum
alloy over an austenitic stainless steel core, or of

austenitic stainless steel on Inconel is currently
considered to be marginal.

Exposure dota are being compiled for the radi-
ography of various thicknesses of Inconel, stainless
steel, nickel-molybdenum, and similar alloys, Also,
test weldments in lin, Inconel sheet are being
radiographed through 8 in. of beryllium to explore
techniques for the inspection of the closure welds
of the ART fuel-annulus core shells.

A 6ein.-dia cop, for use as a catch basin, which
had been welded to the bottom of the sump tank of
the Pratt & Whitney high-temperature critical
assembly, was removed when leakage was detected
ond was found to be severely cracked. It wos
learned that the cap had been machined from bar
stack rather than being a forged fitting, os speci-
fied.

PART 4. RADIATION DAMAGE AND FUEL
RECOVERY AND REPROCESSING

4.1, Radiation Damage

Metallographic specimens were cut from in-pile
loop No. 4 which circulated a fluoride fuel mixture
in the MTR, None of the specimens examined thus
far hove shown attack greater than L5 mils in
depth, and no signs of mass transfer hove been
found, Colored amorphous deposits were found on
the pump slinger and on the forward bellows that

were similar to deposits found in in-pile loop No. 3.

The MTR-irradiated Inconel capsule containing
beryllium oxide slugs was disassembled and ex-
omined. There was no evidence of BeO powder in
the capsule, and no significant changes were ob-
served in either the lengths or diameters of the
slugs.

An opparatus for stress-rupture tests of Inconel
tubing under irradiation in the MTR was essentially
completed. Eight separate specimens will be
tested simultaneously. Duplicate specimens will
be tested out-of-pile at stresses of 2000, 3000, and
4000 psi ot 1500°F,

Rupture times of 1050 and 1650 hr were obtained
for two specimens of Inconel tubing tested at 2000
psi ond 1500°F while being exposed to a thermal-
ond fast-neutron flux of 6 x 1012 neutrons/cm? sec
in hole HB-3 of the LITR. These tupture times for
this 0.010-in.-wall tubing were in good agreement
with out-of-pile data. A third in-pile specimen,
stressed to 1000 psi at 1500°F, did not rupture ia
1670 hr, ond the total creep deformation will be
measured upon disassembly of the apparatus.

Examination was completed on o tubular inconel
specimen that wos stressed in bending at a mexi-
mum stress of 1000 psi ond irradiated for 1120 hr
ot 1500°F while exposed to NaF-ZrF UF, (63-25
12 mole %, tuel 41) on the inside and sodium on
the outside. Corrosion on the fuel side was negli-
gible and did not oppear to depend on the sign or
magnitude of the stress. On the sodium side there
was attack fo a depth of obout 3 mils,

Two MTR-irradiated ond two control capsules
fabricated of Inconel and filled with fuel mixtures
of the NaF-ZrF -UF, system containing 2 mole %
UF, were opened and examined. The capsule
exposed to a flux of 1.5 kw/em? for 676 hr ot
1500°F and its control capsule showed corrosion
penetration so negligible as to be confused with
surface faults. The capsule containing 4 mole %
UF, which was exposed to a flux of 3.7 kw/cm®,
was attacked at the mid-point to a depth of 5 mils
in 235 hr at 1500°F, The distribution of the attack
was that anticipated on the basis of the tempera-
ture profile. The contribution of irradiation to the
attock cannot be judged until control data ond
chemical onclyses of the fuel are available.
Hastelloy B capsules were tested out-of-pile, and
similar capsules have been inserted in the MTR,
Means for applying oxidation resistant cootings
to the Hastelloy B capsules ore still being investi-
gated.

Out-of-pile tests of the pump designed for circu-
lating fused-salt fuel in the LITR vertical in-pile
loop have demonstrated that the newly designed
ZrF ~vapor control features are satisfactory. An
in-pile loop incorporating a similar pump is being
prepared for insertion in the LITR. Facilities are
being plonned for the operation of similar foops in
the Oak Ridge Research Reactor.

During preparations for filling the LITR vertical
in-pile loop, it was discovered that the interior of
the dry box was contaminated by on unknown
gaseous sulfur compound. Sulfur in the Neoprene
rubber gloves was found to be the source of the
contamination,

Irradiotion exposures of nine Cu-B,C samples
were completed in the MTR. Exominations of six
of the samples ore under way.

The applicability of polarographic techniques ta
the study of the fission-product chemistry of fused
salts is being investigated. Means for accommo-
dating the high electrical conductivity of the fused
salts, as compared with aqueous solutions, are
being developed.

A survey was made of the relative variation of
aeutron flux with distance in hole 5IN of the ORNL
grophile reactor by using sulfur ond cadmiom-
covered gold detectors. A plot is presented of the
relative activities of the detectors as a function of
distance from the concrete shield.

The minority carrier lifetime of n-type germanium
has been found to change under irradiation according
to a power law for both fast-neutron and gamma
irradiation. Irradiation with Co®® gamma radiation
and subsequent annealing show o complicated
structure in the barrier change of diodes and
transistors. The results of tests indicate that the
properties of such devices would be changed by a
pulse of gamma irradiation ond that there would
not be immediate recovery upon removal of the
pulse.

A safe was designed for the removal of samples
from the ORNL graphite reactor without subjecting
personnel to radiation, The device can be used
at the reactor loading face, or, by transferring it to
another dolly, at holes 50, 51, and 52.

An exposure device has been designed for use
in hole 30N of the Graphite Reactor with which o
sample can be moved from the external shield to
the irradiation position in about 10 sec. This
device will focilitote measurements on semicon-
ductor components under irradiation.

The loss tangents of polyethylene, polystyrene,
Teflon, Nylon, and phenol formaldehyde were
measured before and after a series of Co®? iradia-
tions. All samples showed measurable changes
after exposures of 108 r; however, the dielectric
constant changes of these materials were less than
the accuracy of measurement, that is, £5%,

4.2. Fuel Recovery and Reprocessing

Construction of the fused salt—fluoride volatility
pilot plant is essentially complete, except for the
facilities for handling the ARE fuel, which will
not be installed until runs with nonirradiated
material are completed, Shakedown tests have
been started,

The embrittlement of nickel ond nickel alloys
with sulfur was studied to determine the allowable
sulfur contamination in the volatility process. A
nickel foil fest wos devised which will detect
S$ ppm of sulfur in a fused salt, Under ordinary con-
ditions, however, in equipment with heavy nickel
walls, o sulfur contamination of 200 to 500 ppm is
necessary to produce any effect in ane exposure,
but the sulfur effect is cumulative, It appears that
the scavenging of sulfur by nickel means that if
the salt is once exposed in the fused state to
nickel equipment it becomes relatively free of
sulfur. The sulfur embrittlement of Inconel was
found fo be much fess than that of nickel.

The gas-phase oxidation resistance of types 316
and 347 stainless steel was found to be quite un-

There was little difference between different lots
of Harshow Chemical Co. material,

Experiments were conducted to test whether
plating aut of ruthenium on metal surfaces could
be used to achieve additional decontamination, In
the initial tests, low decontamination was achieved
in o nickel trap, but there wos only a small amount
of activity involved and the surface area of the
nickel was small. It is anticipated that the re-
moval of ruthenium with a nickel column moy be
made more effective by using a greater surface area
or by operating at @ higher temperature.

PART 5. CRITICAL EXPERIMENTS AND
REACTOR SHIELDING

5.1. Critical Experiments

A critical assembly mocking up the circulating
fuel reflector-moderated reactor under study by
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft was operated at tempera
tures neor 1250°F, The fuel consisted of a molten
mixture of sodium, zirconium, and uranium fluorides,
and the control rod contained a mixture of 30% rare
earth oxides and 70% nickel. With the control rod
out, the critical concentration was 10.97 wt % U
(5.1 mole % UF,) at 1258°F; with the rod inserted
to the midplane, the critical concentration was
12,20 wt % U, The temperature coefficient of
reactivity over the range of 1200 to 1350°F was
-3.6 x 1075 (Ak/k)/°F,

5.2. Shielding Theory

Several Monte Carlo calculations have been per-
formed on the Oracle to determine the dose rate,
energy flux, energy deposition, and in some cases
the energy spectra in laminated shields as a func
tion of the energy of the gamma-ray source and the
angle of incidence of the gamma rays on the shield.
Since it is impractical to publish ali the results
from these calculations in ao progress report, a
summary of the problems is presented along with
references to the published data,

5.3. Lid Tank Shielding Facility

A new instrument positioner has been installed
ot the Lid Tonk Shielding Focility (LTSF) which
will indicate the absolute position of any radiation
detector in the tank water to within £0.5 mm. This
is o considerable improvement over the oid posi-
tioner with which absolute positions could not be
to an accuracy greater than +5 mm.
The new system also provides for remote control of

Under Subcontract No. 390, Metal Hydrides, Inc.,
has investigated the physical propesties of fithium
borohydride-ammonia, which has been suggested as

relationships hove been determined for material
temperatures ranging from 0 to 80°C, The ammo-
nolysis reaction, which was found to occur fo a
small extent, was studied briefly between 50 and

xxxiii
100°C, The densities of liquid lithium borohydride
ammoniates were also determined,

A survey of shielding materials, which was per-
formed by the Technical Research Group under
Subcontract No. 931, confirmed that lithium hy-
dride and polyethylene are the most effective neu-
tron shields known to date. Lithium hydride is
the only lightweight neutron shield material that
can be used in the temperoture range of 700 fo
1200°F, which is the range thot may be expected
in some parts of the direct-cycle reactor shield.
The high-density materials required for gamma-ray
shields still center around lead, bismuth, tungsten,
uranium, etc,

The diameter of the internal water reflector will be
17.5 in., ond the radial thickness of the core will
be 5.5 in., with an aluminum-fo-water volume ratio
of 0.7. This will permit the use of the standard

Tests of ART Structural Design Criteria

Experience in the design of structures for opera-
tion of high temperatures, that is, temperatures
in excess of 1000°F, is limited. Some experience
has been gained throughout the technology from
the design of jet and rocket engine components
and very high-performance steam power plants,
but little of this experience is directly opplicable
to the design of a system such as the Aircraft
Reactor Test (ART). Therefore considerable
effort has been devoted to establishing suitable
design criteria for this reactor.

The high-temperature phenomena that will be
encountered in the ART are creep, relaxation,
and strain-cycling. The design problems associoted
with creep were discussed previously in connection
with the stress analysis of the north-head structure,
and the design criterio used for this analysis
in a previous report.! The design
criteria for strain-cycling and relaxation onalyses
were discussed in connection with the core shell
tests.? The only test to date which could yield
any information on the validity of the design
criteria selected for the ART was the core-shell
low-frequency thermal-cycling experiment? Only
one such test has, as yet, been completed, but
the results indicate thot the strain-cycling criterion
used for the core shells is conservative,
not possible from this single test fo deduce the
degree of conservatism of the criterion.

Further tests are under way or have been pro-
posed with which to evaluate the adequacy of
the selected design criteria. In the heat exchanger
test program presently under way it should be
possible by suitable control of test procedures

first of these tests wos completed on Black,
Sivalls & Bryson heat exchanger type IHE-8 in
IHE-B (see Chap.
Development and Testing’). This test was made
under steady-state conditions
metal temperature in the heat exchanger tubes
of the order of 1650°F. Since only a few relatively
minor thermal cycles were imposed on the system,
the principal loads on the structure were those
due to the fluid drag forces on the tubes. The
life of the heat exchanger was estimated on this
basis, and the cafculations indicated that the
system should have operated for 600 hr before
failure occurred. The test was shut down after
500 hr without a failure. This ottempt to predict
the life of o complex structure under creep and
corrosion conditions demonstrated the importance
of obtaining creep measurements of Inconel in
fused salts at the corrosion rates expected in
the reactor.

Additional heat exchanger tests, which will
include power-cycling, ore presently being pre-
pared. These tests will be conducted on both
the intermediate {IHE) and the small {SHE) straight-
tube types of test heat exchangers,3

The tubes in this unit ore in the form of 180-deg
arcs, and the composite design will incorporate
many structural features found in the ART heat
exchangers. When tested under conditions which
simulate the ART design conditions, this heat
exchanger should demonstrate the adequacy of
the reactor component.

phosis is being placed on the determination of the
thermal stresses produced in the shells, The
temperatyre distributions summarized in the previous
progress are being used as a basis for
these calculations. In the computations of the
corresponding thermal stresses, it is assumed
that the entire structure remains elastic, This
is not a valid assumption in certain local regions
of the shells wherein the temperature profiles
are extremely steep. In these regions, plastic
deformation will occur. Nevertheless, it is ex-

report?

pected that except for a few regions of extreme
distortion the elastic analyses will give adequate
estimates of the sirains induced in the structure.
The strains thus obtained are being used fo de-
termine the stain-cycling life of the structure.
This procedure was applied in a study of shells
V and VI.% The analysis of shell V was completed$
ond is summorized here.

The function of shell V is to separate the boron-
tile curtain around the outer surfoce of the heat
exchanger from the fuel, and thus it serves pri-
marily os a container. Mts importance as a
structural member stems from the foct that a rupture
in this shell would expose the files to the fused
salt, ond it is possible that such exposure might
cause o significant change in reactivity because
of the high boron content of the tiles.

Shell V consists of three ports, as shown pre-
viously,® and each part is ottached separately to
shell WI {the pressure shell liner), The boron
tiles ore contained between these concentric
shells, The inner surface of shell V is bathed
with fuel from the core, ond the outer surface of
shell VI is bathed with sodium from the island
circuit. At full power’ these fluids operate at
markedly different temperatures, and this situation
gives rise to differential expansion be-
tween the two shells, Because of the apprecioble
difference in thickness of these shells th in.

shell V is limited by shell VI, ond thus the stress
analysis is reduced principally to a study of
shell V,

The most critical area in this ossembly is the
intermediate section which extends from just below
the equator to about 30 deg south latitude (Fig.
L1.1). This section is exposed to large tem-
perature variations relative to shell VI, which
produce free radial expansions at the equator of
0.021 in. and ot the 30-deg south latitude junction
of 0.035 in. (note that these growths represent in-
terferences between the shells V and VIL. In od-
dition, there is a relotive axial growth of 0.028 in.
Much of the distortion produced by these relative
expansions appears as locol effects in shell V ot
the attachment points to shell VI. Because of
the smoll thickness-to-radius ratio of shell V,
however, the stresses arising from the edge dis-
placements and rotations diminish ropidly with
Yatitude ongle.

The final design for the junction, selected on
the basis of this study, is a Yi goin flat plate with

configuration is used at other junction of shells

temperature differences are oppreciably lower.
A 20,500-psi valve for the octohedral shear stress

Design Analysis far Creep Bending
D. L. Platus

It was mentioned above that the Black, Sivalls &
Bryson heat exchanger type IHE-8 used in the
design criterion test was operated at steady state
and thot under these conditions the tubes ore
subjected to a steady fluid drag force. These
forces ploce a bending stress on o short section
of each tube (Fig. 1.1.4), and in a first approxi-
mation the tubes behave os cantilever beams in
the vicinity of the headers. In order to predict
the stress-rupture life of these tubes it is neces-
sary to toke into account the effect of creep on
the stress distribution over the cross section of
the tube. Coleulations indicote thot if this effect
is included o reduction of about 20% can be
realized in the moximum fiber stress in comparison
with that predicted by the elastic theory. This
could result in as much as a fivefold increase in
stress-rupture life, as indicated by the tensile
stress-rupture data. The calculations® were based
on a method” in which tensile creep data are

utilized to predict the creep rate and stress distri-
bution in a beam under o bending stress. In this
method it is assumed that @ quasi-viscous state of
creep exists, by considering the stresses fo be a
function of creep rote ond time and to be inde-
pendent of strain, and that the cross sections
remain in a plane during bending. The latter
assUmptign 1eads to the relation

where é(y) is the strain rate in the beam at distance
y from the neutral oxis, € is the sirain rate in
the extreme fiber at y = 5/3, and b is the outside
diameter of the tube. If the tensile creep data
can be eosily expressed analytically, the equation
may be used in on integral statement of the moment
at any section to obtain an analytical solution
of the stress distribution and the maximum strain
rate as o function of time and the applied moment.
If the creep data cannot be represented by a con-
venient mathematical expression, the equation
must be solved with the moment relation by o
aumerical technique. For this purpose a set of
stress vs creep-rate curves with time as a pora-
meter is required, such as those in Fig. 1.1.5.

This general approach was used to analyze an
Inconel heat exchanger tube in pure bending stress
at 1500°F in on Naf-ZrF -UF (50-46-4 mole %,
fuel 30) environment, and @ numerical calculation
was made for which the creep-rate data presented
in Fig. 1.1.5 were used. A determination of the
stress distributions and the maximum creep rate
for a constant moment gave a calculated maximum
elastic stress of 6500 psi (these conditions were
selected in order to shorten the time required for
a creep-rupture bend test). The results of the
calculations are shown in Figs. 1.1.6 and 1.1.7,
Figure 1.1.6 gives the maximum stress and creep
cate in the tube, and Fig. 1.1.7 gives the stress
distribution at various time intervals.

Two important observations may be based on
this study. First, the calculated maximum stress
is quickly reduced to about 80% of the predicted
elastic value and remains essentially constant
for the life of the member. Second, constant-stress
creep data are required for calculations of this
type, rather than constant-load data.

An experimental attempt to verify the

several critical areas in the design hove been
identified, ond alterations required by stress con-
siderations have been made in the design, Three
problems have been examined, in particular, which
oppear to account for some of the foilures ex-
perienced with these units, In these three analyses,
studies were made of weight and air drog loads,
relative thermal expansion between fins ond header,
ond relative thermal expansion between adjacent
tubes os a result of flow stoppage from oxide
plugging.

The ART radiator consists of a butterfly arrange
ment? of fins and headers with the fin banks
resting on support plates rigidly attached to the
headers. Expansion of the headers relative to
the fins will lift the tube-fin banks off the support
plotes during power operation and thereby cause
the tubes to behove as cantilever beams subjected
to a uniform distribution of drag and weight loads,
Since the tubes are connected by the fins, the
tube bonk will The effect of
the fins is to produce a restoring moment at each
tube-fin connection that is proportional to the
slope of the tube at that point (Fig. 1.1.8). This
complex array of connected tubes may be treated
as a homogeneous matrix if the system of discrete
restoring moments at each fin-tube joint is replaced
by a continuous distribution, The problem is then
analogous to the classical ‘beam on elastic
foundation.” A colculation based on this model
was performed for the ART radiator, ond the air
and weight loads were found to give tube stresses
at the headers of the order of 1500 to 2000 psi.

By treating this discrete set of forces as a con-
tinuous force distributed along the tube, it is
possible to write a differential equation for the
axiol tube and a corresponding
equation for the bending stress in the fins as a
function of the position along the tube, This

ART SHIELDING
C. M. Copeahaver A. M. Perry

A program of calculations hos been undertaken
to re-evaluate the shielding of the ART ond such
auxiliory equipment os the fuel fill-and-drain
tank, fuel-recovery tank, etc. The first step was
to compute the gamma-ray dose rate at the outer
surfoce of the ART neutron shield, without taking
into account the effects of the several penetrations

source strengths in the equatorial plane of the
ART. The plane-to-sphere transformation? wos
then applied to each portion of the source.
Secondory gomma rays from the lead shield were
neglected. The justification for this is that in the
Lid Tank Shielding Facility (LTSF) tests of the
gammo-ray dose rates in reflector-moderated
reactor mockups with various lead thicknesses,
the dose varied exponentiolly with lead thickness
up to about 4.5 in.; the ART lead is 4.3 in. thick.
These dato are interpreted to mean that the
intensity of gommo rays penetrating the 4.3-in.-
thick lead shield of the ART will be much greater
than the intensity of gamma roys produced in the

The calculoted dose rate ot the surface of the

importance of each source is indicated by the
percentage contributions to the total dose rate:
core, 22%; outer core shell, 9%; reflector, 12%;
reflector shell, 35%; heat exchanger, 22%.

in such a calculation the question arises of
whether the buildup-factor method can yield volid
results for the reflector-moderatedreactor geometry.
The gamma rays penetrate o substantial thickness
of lead, and, since the lead absorption cross
section has a minimum for gamma-ray energies
from 3 to 5 Mev, it might be supposed thot most
gomma rays entering the water would have energies
in this ronge. For the higher energy sources, use
of water buildup factors might then lead to appreci-
able errors. In order to check this point, on
ottempt was mode to determine the energy spectrum
of the gamma rays entering ond leaving each

FLOW DECAY IN ART PRIMARY NoK SYSTEM
FOLLOWING POWER LOSS

WE, Werts!

A NaK pump power failure will produce temper-
ature and pressure transients in the ART heat-dump
system. The Nol circuit flow-dscay characters
istics were therefore investigated for use as o
guide in evaluating the significance of such o
power loss. This investigation was based on the
premise that flow is proportional fo pump speed
when other fluid cirenit conditions are constant.

Experiments! data os the transient chorocter-
istics of a Nak circuit were obiained for o foap
in which an ART prototype NaK pump was being
tested af high temperatures. The loop contained
about & 1% of circulating Mak. During shutdown
tests, high-speed mation pictures were taken of
the pump shoft ond of a pointer atached to a
synchronous timing motor. This photographic
record provided a reliable and accuiote method
of determining the number of pump-shail revolutions
oz a function of time. With a complete tabulation
of pump.shoft revolutions vs time established,
speed vs time data could be obtained through
aumericol differentiation,

Several shutdown tests were mode from each of
two initial conditions, The NoK flow wos es-
sentiolly the some for both conditions, but the
initial pump-shaft speed in one case was about
three-fourths the initial speed in the other case.
A hand volve wos adjusted, as required, fo provide
the desired flow for the pump-shaft speed used.

The data were compared and evalusted according

The data were analyzed in detail for two shut-

downs from the following initial steady-state
operating conditions:
Condition Rua 1 Ron 2
Shaft speed, rpm 3506 2678
Fluid flow, gpm 1220 1216
Dischorge head, ft 394 212
Power supplied, hp 119.3 68.8

Partial checks of data from several other tests
indicated almost identical results for the con-
ditions involved. All the analyzed test dota

closely matched the computed decay characteristic
shown on Fig. 1.3.1 for on initial kinetic energy-
to-power ratio of 2, that is, KEg/HP, = 2, ond
speed decay down to about 30%. Below the 30%
speed-decay region, the system mechanicol friction
becomes increasingly more significant, since the

system kinetic-energy driving force has dropped
to less shan 10% of the original value.

The operating decay characteristics were sub-
stantially the some for both sets of conditions,
and therefore only the test data for the shutdown
from a shaft speed of 3506 rpm were fully reduced
to completed plots, as shown in Figs. 1.3.2 ond
1.3.3, The pressure characteristic curve shown
on Fig. 1.3.2 was obtained by using the premise
that pressure varies as the square of the speed
and the flow rate. With other conditions constant,
the flow rote is considered to be proportional to
the pump-shaft speed, as previously indicated.

The anclytical expressions for the two fest
conditions would be identical if the initial kinetic
energy-to-power ratios were the same. The power
ratio for she two conditions is 119.3/68.8 = 1.735,
and the experimental data indicated that the decay
characteristics for the two sefs of conditions were
identical; therefore, the kinetic energy ratio must
be neorly the same as the power ratio, An investi-
gation of the rotating kinetic energy ratio for the
two conditions reveoled that

Thus it can be seen that the rotating kinetic

the two test conditions.

to the system kinetic energy. If the foregoing
deductions are considered to be the case, the
major contributors to continuing system operation
after a power loss are the rotating elements of
the pump and the electric drive motor. This also
means that the only appreciable contribution to
any extended continuing fluid circuletion during
the decay period is received from the stored
kinetic energy in the mechanically rotating parts,
ond that the pump is still the driving force and
is inducing fluid displacement in a manner sub-
stantially the same as during the previous steady.
state operation.

Since the fluid flow is dependent upon the pump
driving force, fluid travel around the circulating
loop should be substantially proportional to the
pump angular displacement. The information pre-
sented on Fig. 1.3.3 was determined by applying

One of the three units which failed soon after the

failure of the unit was caused by NaK seepage

on-off probe and its control circuit to give better
control and a better safety margin in operation.

The on-off leve! probe being tested consists of
a Yrin.-dia copper wire contained in and insulated
from a -in.-OD, 0.025-in.-wall Inconel tube at
all points, except the bottom, where it is welded.
A current of 8 to 10 amp, &0 cps, is supplied to
the probe. A relay across the probe is energized
when the NaK level is below the probe ond de-
energized when NoK touches the probe. A similar
on-off probe with an Inconel center wire and a
bridge amplifier for the control circuit is being
studied. The probe would consist of a ¥ 4-in.-dia
Inconel wire insulated in a % (in.-OD, 0.025-in.-
wall Inconel tube. The bridge circuit would be
balanced when the NaK touched the probe and
unbalanced when the NaK level was below the
probe. Since the temperature coefficient of resis-
tivity of Inconel is low, the zero shift resulting
from a temperature change would not be so large as
in the present probe. A specification has been
prepared ond submitted to manufacturers for a
packaged amplifier to be used in this bridge
circuit.

An especially fabricoted spark plug with a
beryllium oxide insulotor wos tested in NaK as
on on-off level probe. The plug failed after 20 hr
of operation because of short circuiting of the
insulator. The plug was removed and reworked,
and it is to be retested when the NaK-level test
facility (referred to in previous section) is back
in operation.

Several special plugs with insulators high in
alumina and mognesium content were received from
the Champion Spark Plug Co. for testing and
evoluating. These plugs will also be tested in
the NaK-level test focility or other test rigs as
soon os possible.

The usefulness of the conventional type of spark
plug as o reliable on-off probe is very doubtful
at this sime. The plug life is very short when the
probe is operated at temperatures above 450 to
500°F, and there is always the danger of gas
leakage through the insulator, This leokage
oroblem could be very serious if the plug were
used with radicoctive fluids, and it would be
necessary to completely can or seal the plug.
Therefore the use of the spark plug as a reactor
type of level element is not recommended, ond
the development and testing of the resistance type

of on-off probe is continuing. It is expected that

22

this unit will replace the spark plug except in
systems which can be operated safefy ond reliably
within the spark-plug limitations, or in systems
in which the process fluid electrical conductivity
is too low for use with the resistive type of on-off
level probe.

FUEL-EXPANSION-TANK LEVEL INDICATOR
R. F. Hyland
Dynamic-Level Tests

Four helium-bubbler-type fuel-level indicators
completed 1000-he tests at 1500°F in the dynamic-
level test rig, described previously,” without
plugging of the bubbler tubes, Two of the bubblers
were fabricated of %-in.-OD, 0.085-in.-wall Inconel
tubing, aad the other two were %-in.-OD, 0.085-
in,-wall Inconel tubing. The helium used for these
tests wos passed through o Drierite filter and
through copper turnings maintained at 1000°F in
order to getter the oxygen and remove the moisture.

After completion of these tests, the focility was
modified in an attempt to obtain a better series
of level calibrations. The modifications included
a means for accurately varying the fuel level
continuously in the two vessels by using gos
pressure; a anew bubbler design with a shallow V
in the bottom of the tube wos used; and the
bubblers were positioned within 0.010 in. of the
correct level while the vessel was af the operating
temperature. An improved type of variable coli-
brating probe was designed, installed, and cali-
brated at the operating temperature. Also, the fuel
was thoroughly mixed prior to calibration fo
preclude density errors due to thermal gradients.
As a
accurate, reproducible series of static level cali-

result of these modifications, the firss

brations was obtained. The maximum level error
was 0.08 in. in 5 in., or 1.6%.
reproducible within 1.5%.

A dynomic-level test scheduled to operate for
3000 hr at 1500°F has completed 750 hr without
bubbler plugging. Prior to startup, however, with
the bubblers operating in static fuel ot 1350°F,
Gt four bubblers plugged in a period of 24 hr, for
reasons unknown, Two bubblers were removed ond
the contents sent for onalysis. The other two
were unplugged by raising the fluid temperature

The results were

to 1500°F, The bubbler plugging problem has
become so serious that a separate series of tests,
described below, is to be made to determine the
cause.

Static-Level Tests

The average life of a helium-bubbler type of
level indicator hos been found to be about 1100 hr
in a static-level system in which a NoK scrubber
is used fo reduce the moisture content of the
helium and in which copper turnings maintained
at 1000°F are used to reduce the oxygen content.
Since the average life falls for short of the 3000-hr
life specified, ottempts are being mode to de-
termine the cause of plugging of the bubbler tubes.
Although the techniques for analyzing fuel mixtures
for oxygen compounds are not precise, it is thought
that the moterial which plugs the bubbler tubes
is Z¢0,. Therefore a special batch of oxyflucride-
free fuel will be used in the next series of fests.

It has been suggested that a cold trap be used
in place of the NeK scrubbers for removing
moisture from the hetium, since NaK entrainment
might contribute to the plugging. Methods for
checking the oxygen content of the helium and
for reducing the oxygen content are being studied.
Further, the vessels used for future tests are to
be hydrogen fired.

These recommendations are to be incorporated
into a simple series of bubbler tests in static
fuel, without level instrumentation, and the ad-
ditional precoutions described below will be taken.

1. An all-silver-soldered spectrometer-leak-tight
system, with bellows valves, will be employed.

2. The system will be flushed thoroughly by
alternately pressurizing with helium ond evacu-
ating.
content of the
supply helium will be continuously monitored.

4. The purge helium will be preheated to the
temperature of the fuel.

As a further check on the role of oxygen impurity
in the helium as a cause of plugging, one test
series will be run with helium of known oxygen
content, as furnished in commerciol gas, and
another test series will be run with helium passed
over uranium turnings held at 600°C fo reduce the
oxygen content to as low a value os possible.

PRESSURE TRANSMITTERS FOR USE AT HIGH

W. R. Miller

Evaluotion tests of commercial transmitters for
use at high temperatures were continued. Two of

The first
unit tested was not satisfactory in that the over-all
occuracy was only 3.3% full scale at 1200°F. The
other unit was somewhat better, with an over-all
accuracy of 2.1% full scale at 1200°F. The
differential-transformer method of detection has
proved to be vausually difficult to use in that the
tield of the Calrod heaters used to maintain the
operating temperature has on effect on the output
readings. The use of magnetic shielding is
helpful but does not relieve the situation com-
pletely. At present two more units of the type

variable-permeance type of pressure transducer
was tested, but no date were obtained. Lack of
suitable aligning guides allowed the core of the
transducer to rub the coil housing. This unit
(Fig. 1.3.6), which wos on consignment, has been
returned to the manufacturer,

Redesigned models of the four-legged strain-
gage type of transmitters (Fig. 1.3.7) were also
tested. Armor was added to protect the capillary,
ond o shock-mounted sub-base was added within
the _ase for vibration isolation. The redesigned
case eliminates zero shift when the cover is
tightened. Because of a poorly designed shipping
clamp the strain goges were domaged during
shipment, and therefore the test results for these
models were not up fo the stondord set by the
results obtained with the original six prototype
models. The shipping clamp hos now been
modified by the manufacturer.

The next lot of four-legged strain-gage trans-
mitters will feature a sensor housing with improved
stress choracteristics for use with more corrosive
process fluids. The details of this design change
have been satisfactorily resolved with the mano-
facturer.

MAGNETIC FLOWMETERS
G. H. Burger C. L. Pearce’

Six of the 3)4.in. magnetic flowmeters purchased
for the ETU and the ART were installed in the
tHowmeter test loop filled with NaK for calibration
agoinst a water-calibrated (0.25% accurate) venturi.
As stoted previously® the units will be calibrated
over the widest temperature and flow-rate ranges
possible with the test loop. These ranges will
cover, in general, the design ranges of the ETU
and the ART.

Operation of the loop began on February 12,
1957, and it had operated a tote! of 40 hr when it
became necessary to drain the NaK for repairs
ond modifications of the loop. During the 40-hr
operating period, fluid flow rates of up to 1600 gpm
and fluid temperatures of up to 1350°F were
achieved.

The data obtoined with the mognetic flowmeters,
while not at all conclusive becouse of the short
operating time, did give general indications of
the operating characteristics to be expected. [t
appears that ot least four of the six flowmeters
now installed in the loop will be acceptable for
the ETU if the accuracy specifications are met
in subsequent tests.

Six of the ART-ETU 2-in. magnetic flowmeters
are being installed in another test loop for cali-
bration against o water-calibrated (0.25% accurate)
venturi. Operation of this loop will probably start
in May 1957.

The %-in. magnetic flowmeters designed for plug
indicator and cold-trap flow rate measurements
are being fobricated. Several of the units will
be tested for temperature effects on the magnets.
These units will not be calibrated because the
accuracy requirement is +15%.

TURBINE FLOWMETERS FOR USE AT HIGH

The 1-in. turbine flowmeter, designoted unit No.

a forced-circulation gos-fired Inconel loop con-
taining NoF-ZrF -UF , (50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30)

operated satisfactorily for approximately 340 hr.
It was then noted that the turbine output frequency
was considerably different from what it should
have been bosed upon the orifice-measured flow
rate, and an investigotion showed that the unit
was not operating. An x-ray examination of the
unit showed, as for as could be determined, that
the unit was not broken. It was therefore believed
thot, since the unit hod been operated in NaK
systems three times previously, the bearing had
been oxidized to some extent and that operation

operating time.

Prior to installation in the {oop the unit had been
tested and calibrated at a high flow rate in a loop
containing water, The unit performed satisfactorily
during the calibration tests. The calibration data
are shown in Fig. 1.3.8. The only unusual
operating characteristic was noted at a flow rate
of 600 gpm, at which point the turbine ‘‘chattered"’;

The total test time with
water was approximately 6 to 8 hr, and flow rates
of up to 1100 gpm were recorded. lt wos felt on

Turbine Flowmeter,

Operation of the loop wos started on February 12,
1957, and the turbine flowmeter operated os
expected for approximately 12 min. The loop flow
was started at 420 gpm ond was rapidly increased
to 1220 gpm, as indicated by the turbine flowmeter,
At some point between the flow rates of 970 and
1220 gpm, however, the unit failed in some manner.
At the approximate time of failure and possibly
during all or part of the operating time, the loop
operators could hear chattering of the unit. The
temperoture of the circulating NaK at the time of
failure was 155°F. The loop continued to operate
ofter the turbine failure and eventuclly reached
a flow rate of 1680 gpm and a maximum fluid
temperature of 1350°F, which wos held for only
a short time and then lowered. The loop operated
a total time of approximately 40 hr before pump
surges necessitated shutdown. The surges may
have resulted from ingassing brought about by
improper operation of the surge tank level system
while measuring venturi pressures.

On February 14, 1957, before disassembly of
the loop, a radiograph was made of the turbine
flowmeter which showed that the bearings were
broken and that o number of blades were missing.
On Febrary 18 the flowmeter wos removed from
the loop, and the indications of the rodiograph
were confirmed, as shown in Fig. 1.3.9. Eight
of the ten blades were missing; the two remaining
blodes were beat opposite to the direction of
rotation; and both bearing shafts were broken.
The main throttling valve was removed from the
system, and six of the blades were found therein.
A seventh blade was found under the valve housing

in the drain line. The eighth blade has not yet

been found, but the search is continuing; the
piping is to be x-rayed, flushed, and swabbed.
The turbine hos been disassembled and will be
carefully examined in an effort to determine the
cause of failure.

The dynamic tests of lubricants under irradiation
that were to be run in the LITR3 ore, rather, to be
run in a gommo-irradiation facility in the MTR
canal. With the MTR facility it will be possible to
use a slightly modified full-scale pump rotary
assembly and to examine the unit for damage
immediately upon removal from the gamma-irradi-
ation field. The present schedule calls for test
operations to begin next quarter.

The final selection of a lubricant-coolant for
the reactor pumps will be based on the results of
the gamma-irradiation tests in the MTR. Since both
organic liquids ond highly refined paraffin-base
mineral oils are being considered ot this time, all
parts of the pumps and the external lubricant-
pumping system are designed to be compatible
with either liquid. For exomple, copper is incom-
patible with organic liquids, and therefore copper
parts in the seals and journal bearings ore being
replaced. All-stainiess-steel bellows-seal test
assemblies were ordered ond will be incorporated
into the MTR test units. Journal bearings fabri-
coted from Alcoa alloy 750-T5 were selected to
replace the original bronze bearings. The small
percentage of copper (0.7 to 1.3%) in this alloy is
probably insignificant with respect to the organic
liquids of interest, but a sample of the alloy will
be tested in UCON L8-140-X, an organic liquid,
before the MTR test is made. There are no copper
parts in the external lubricant-pumping system.

Two 1000-hr tests were conducted to determine
the suitobility of the aluminum olloy, Alcoo 750-T5,
for this particular bearing application in which
the effective journal bearing area is 2.4 in.2
Gulfcrest 34 was used os the lubricant in both
tests. The test conditions are given in Table 1.4.1.

Neither test gave any evidence of bearing mal-
function, and both the bearings were equally as
good os bronze bearings tested under simior

placed in rotary elements for use in various other
tests, and if satisfactory service is obtained the
aluminum alloy will be used for all reactor pump

Continued tests of the modified Durametallic
seals? being developed for use as seals in NaK
pumps have produced further encouraging results.
More than 5000 hr of operating time was logged for
such seals, including 2500 hr in a rotary element
pumping NoK of 1400°F ond 2500 hr in a me-
chanical shakedown stand with the seals subjected
to a wide range of differential pressures from
20 psig, which simulates a vacuum filling operation,

to 275 psig, which is more than a maximum
catastrophe pressure, and to rubbing speeds from
0 10 60 fps.

It was found that for the very high differential
pressures, obove 200 psig, a shight design modifi-
cation will be necessary to prevent relative motion
boiween the positioning collor for the lower seal
ond the shaft. On the basis of these good test
results, the Durametallic seals have been specified
for use in the ART NaK pumps.
Tests have shown the buna-N-base O-rings
recommended by outside vendors for use with
UCON LB-140-X lubricant to be quite satisfactory.
Similar tests showed the buna-N-bose O-rings to
be satisfactory for use with Gulfcrest 34 lubricant,
and therefore this elastomeric seal can be used
for the reactor pumps if either of these lubricants
is acceptoble. If, however, the MTR tests prove
these lubricants to be unsatisfactory, the seal
material may ogain become a problem. For the
NaK pumps, similar commerciatly available
elastomer seals will be sotisfactory, since Guif-
crest 34 will be the lubricant used.

shifts from doy to day, and in order to obtoin
reliable pressure data it is necessary to calibrote
these instruments before each test run by pressur-
tzing the loop with helium to as high as 100 psig.

The off-gas riser connecting the pump pot to the
Z¢F pvopor trap has been replaced twice during
the course of operation. The first time the riser
had to be replaced because a ZrF, plug formed
when the fuel temperatures were
inadvertently 1500°F. The

comparison with the fuel temperature to couse
ZrF, to deposit and plug the riser. The line
was replaced without terminating the test. The
off-gas riser had to be reploced o second time
when a leak developed. This time the test oper
ation had to be shut down. Partial plugs of ZrF,
have also occurred in the gas passage through the
pump barrel, possibly as the result of reverse flow
or back diffusion of gas through the pump barrel.
Performance and cavitation data are being ob-
tained, and endurance tests are planned.

Fuel Pump Endurance Tests
P. G. Smith

The ART fuel pump being tested for endurance
was shut down on November 29, 1956, with a total

There was no evidence of lube oil leakage from
the pump seals during the fests, but upon disas-
sembly the lower seal was found to be worn to
such an extent that it should have permitted a
small amount of leakage. There was evidence of
this leakage inside the thermal barrier con, which
was not filled with barrier material for this test
and which contained a small amount of carbon
deposit.

The pump wos cleaned and reassembled with
new seals and placed back in operation for further
testing. It hos accumulated a total of 550 hr mere
of continuous operation and 35 thermal cycles
over the temperature range of 1400 to 1100°F.
The lube oil leckoge rates are 5 cm3/day from
the lower seal and zero from the upper seal.

There had been no trouble with the hydraulic
drive for the past 1240 hr of pump operation. This
may be attributed to a back pressure of 100 to
120 psig being maintained on the discharge side
of the motor, as recommended by the manufacturer,
to ensure that the piston shoes are seated on the
wobble plate at all times.

Sodium Pump Development Water Tests

The hydraulic problems to be solved in the ART
sodium pump are not yet fully delineated. An

pump and the fuel pump, for which five major points

through the centrifuge before ingassing occurs,
pressure levels based on ART stress limitations,
and cavitation. In considering each of these
problems in relation to the sodium pump, it is
apparent that, bosed on tests made to dote, the
pressure fluctuations are small, the flow required
into the expansion tank is small enough (5 gpm
maximum, per pump) not fo cause ingassing through
the centrifuge, and the ART stress limitations do
not impose stringent requirements on the pressure
levels. The sodium pump will require a decreosing
gas-pressure gradient in the direction of gas flow
from the oil catch basin down the shaft annulus
into the exponsion tank (Fig. 1.4.6). Cavitation

gation must be made of the loop ingassing which
has occurred at throttled flow rates.

A new pump barrel was designed and is being
fabricated that more closely mocks up the ART

ation. The differences between the present con-

The volute in the new configuration is now fully
instrumented for measuring the radial unbalance
force ot the centrifuge discharge area. Also, the
effect on pump performance of fluid leakage be-
tween the heat exchanger inlet and the volute can
be determined,

The tests to date have been hampered by
ingassing of the system, which becomes more
pronounced when the flow rate in the main loop is
reduced. Several runs were mode to obtain
performance data, however, and data obtained in a
low-speed run correlated reasonably well with
data obtoined in the earlier development tests.8
The data obtained in runs at speeds sufficiently
high to bracket the design head are shown in
Fig. 1.4.8.

No work has been done, as yet, toward the
solution of the gas-pressure gradient problem.
At present the expansion tank operates at a pres-
sure level greater thon that in the rotary element
oil catch basin. A modified degassing disk will be

J. W. Cooke’

Free movement between the sodium pump barrel
and volute will be required in the ART to allow
for radial movement to accommodate thermol ex-
pansion and axial misalignment resulting from
accumulative assembly tolerances. A seal must be
provided in this region to minimize leakage of
sodium between the heat exchanger inlet and the
pump centrifuge outlet regions. Two designs of
multiple-ring seols, Fig. 1.4.9, have been tested
with water.

The maximum leakage rote for seal design No. 1
was 2.1 gpm at a pressure differential of 50 psi
and on axio} spacing of 0.015 in. The moximum
leakage rate for seal design No. 2 wos | gpm at a
pressure differential of 80 psi ond an axial spacing
of 0.0135 in. Both the pressure differential and
spacing at which these maximum leakage rates
occurred are more severe thon the estimoted ART
values. It is onticipated that the maximum leakage
rates given above will not seriously interfere

along lines of constant flow and then against flow
along lines of constont speed. From the latter
plot, the static suction pressure required to
suppress cavitation over the normal pump operating
range was plotted, as shown in Fig. 1.4.12, for
two NoK temperatures, 1200 and 1400°F. The
vapor pressure of NoK inceeases by 5.33 psi from
1200 to T400°F, and the constant spread between a
given constant speed line for eoch of the two
temperatures is very nearly 5.33 psi. The gos
pressure on the pump surge tank is 0.5 psi less
than the static suction pressure and therefore con
be determined from Fig. 1.4.12.

In order to further show the effect of vapor
pressure on cavitation, data were taken at a given
head and flow rate for NoK temperatures from
720°F, where the vapor pressure is essentially
zero, to 1400°F, where the vapor pressure is
approximately 7.5 psia. The results of these
tests in terms of the cavitation parameter, o, are
indicated by Fig. 1.4.13. If cavitation varied only
with vapor pressure at a given pump operating
point, it would be expected that o would remain
constant over the temperature range. As may be
seen in Fig. 1.4.13, there wos essentially o
constant o at temperatures from 1180 to 1400°F,
and o slightly higher but constant o ot 720 and
914°F. It is believed that the results would
be more significant if speed and flow rote were
held constant instead of head ond flow rote in
order to hold constant impeller inlet conditions,
and therefore additional cavitation data are to be
obtained.

This pump and its associated loop have now
been operated approximately 2100 hr at temper-
otures from 1100 to 1400°F. The rotary element
of the pump was removed and inspected after
1700 hr operation, ond it was confirmed that, as
suspected, some NaoK had entered the oil catch
basin when the NaK level rose in the pump tank
as the result of ingassing after approximately
800 hr of operation. The pump hod, however,
continued to operote satisfactorily for the next
900 hr. A considerable amount of carbon from the
oil was deposited on the pump shaft and on the
radiator baffles in the pump tank, and thus it was
apparent that the oil seol leakage had run down
the pump shaft, even though there was a 50-liter/day
helium purge from the oft catch basin and o
500-liter/day helium purge down the pump shaft
annulus and out the pump tank reflux condenser.

It is believed thot a cylindrical riser around the
shaft to above the seal interface will direct the
leakage oil inte the catch bosin and prevent
leakage down the shoft into the NaK. On the
pump being tested the riser was below the seal
interface. Further examination showed that there
were no signs of rubbing of the impeller against
labyrinth seals, even though the pump was oper-
ated occasionally at conditions well off the volute-
balance line.?® The impeller ond volute appeared

not affected the oil seal leakage purge system.
The impeller surfaces had an etched appearance,
but approval for further operation was given by the
metalluegists. The critical dimensions of the
rotary assembly were measured before and after
this test run, and it was found that all dimensions
had remained constant, except the volute mouth,
which had opened up from 0.003 to 0.010 in.,
probably because of stress relief and pressure
stresses. An additional test is planned to provide
further data on operation without a helium bleed
down the pump-shaft annulus.

Heat removal from the pump berrel by the lubri-
cation and cooling oil was measured at several
NoK temperatures and liquid levels in the pump
tank. At lubricating and cooling oil flow rates of
approximately 3.5 gpm, the heat removal ranged
from 1.8 kw at 1200°F, the normai operating level,
to 2.3 kw at 1400°F, the maximum operating level.

A resistance type of level indicator was used in
the pump tank, and the level readings were com-
pared with the indicated by spark-plug
probes. The resistance type of level indicator
gave very satisfactory performance at temper-
otures ahove 50°F.

the cold-trap economizer inlet and all but four of
the radiator tubes were plugged with oxide. The
oxide had apparently been deposited in the main

York radiotor No. 15 hos heen thoroughly cleaned
and will be installed in SHE test stand B as the
heat dump for the test of the semicircular heat

exchanger.

The first part '8 of the endurance test of Black,
Sivells & Bryson heat exchangers Nos. 1 and 2
{type IHE-8) was completed in IHE test stand
B. The test included 503 hr of operation of heat
exchanger No. 1 with a NaK inlet temperature of
1700°F and the other conditions of temperature,
pressure, and flow rate shown in Fig. 1.4,18.
The NaK pressure drop through heat exchanger
No. 1, calculated on the basis of constant flow,
increased to approximately 5.4 times the initial
level, and the NaK pressure drop through the
radiator increased to approximately 1.3 times
the initial level. These pressure drop increases
in the NaK circuit ore attributed, as before, '?
to the buildup of mass-tronsferred material in
the small-diameter tubing of the test units. Black,
Sivalls & Bryson heat exchanger No. 1 is being
replaced by Black, Sivalls & Bryson heat ex-
changer No. 3, which is of the same type os No, 1.

result with regard fo reactor operation is that any
tendency for local overheating in an intermediate

The model 32 impeller has greatly reduced the
problem of liquid rising in the shaft annulus.
With the original impeller, liquid rose into the
shaft anauius of a pump which was stopped if the
other pump was still running. In tests of the new
impeller over a wide range of pump speeds and

Valve 5C was assembled by using refinished
parts from valve 5B. The conical surface of the
seat wos remachined and the spherical surface of
the plug was polished, The high initial leakage
rates that occurred when tests of volve 5C were
started made it necessary to use a stem closing
force of 1000 Ib. The average leckage rate was
0.5 cm3/hr during the first 25 operating cycles
with this stem force. No measuroble leakage
occurred during the 500-hr closure test, and leakage
rates during eleven operating cycles since the
500-hr closure test hove been erratic, with on
average of 2.5 cm3/hr. The leakage rate has
increased rapidly since the thirty-third operating
cycle. This valve hos now been operated for
1100 hr, and the test will continue until an oper-
ating time of 1500 hr has been reached.

is to be tested again with the diametrical clearance
of the inner stem guide increased from 0.008 to
0.080 in. This valve has given the best over-all
performance of any valve tested to date.

A valve of a modified design is being fabricated
for testing. The new design incorporates backup
bellows to supplement the seal bellows and im-
proved stem-alignment control. Also, a valve that
will have a spider guide mounted in the end con-

tested in mockups?? in order to determine the
pressure drops. Three of these regions were
tested this quarter. Since the heat loads, lengths,
ond entrance conditions of the five rows of cooling
holes through the beryllium reflector are different,
the sodium flow through these cooling holes must
be controlled to achieve a uniform temperature
pattern throughout the beryllium. A convenient
method of control is to orifice individual holes ot
the beryllium equator joint with ¥.in.-thick arifice
plugs. Such plugs with orifice holes of 0.0595
to 0.1875 in. in inside diometer were tested.

The results of the tests are shown on Fig. 1.4.2]
as pressure loss coefficients, which include the
total loss for the entrance orifice and 4.56 in. of
hole length, vs the orifice diameter. A range of
orifice sizes was tested, with the smallest orifice
in the reflector cooling hole reducing the flow to
obout 20% of the flow with the lorgest orifice.

ment. This misalignment will introduce an extra
heed loss ot the equator joint, but it can be
compensated by proper selection of the orifice
size. A second series of orifice tests was run to
determine the effect of this misalignment on the
loss coefficient. The results of these tests are
also shown on Fig. 1.4.21.

Another fest involved a full-scale mockup of
one-half of the symmetrical sodium circuit in the
reflector entrance region where the sodium supply
to the reflector flows down from the two pump
tees, impinges on the circular boron cans, and
spreads out over the top of the reflector and the
core shell. The wooden test model of the top of
the beryllium reflector with the circular boron-
containing can in place and the spacer bars
assembled is shown in Fig. 1.4.22, and Fig. 1.4.23

was fitted into an aluminum-inconel-Piexiglas
piece that simulated the underside of the Inconel
north-head shells just above the reflector.

The head loss in this reflector entrance region
at the design flow rate of 1.28 f13/sec was found
to be 3.0 ft compared with an estimated 7.5 ft.
The relative flow distribution through the beryllium
cooling holes was obtoined by measuring the
height of the water jet from each hale with the
complete test assembly turned upside down, and
loss coefficients (Fig. 1.4.24) were calculoted for
each hole based on the jet height ond the hole
orientation shown in Figs. 1.4.22 ond 1.4.23. The
measurements showed that the cooling holes on
the shoulder around the pie-shaped depression in
the reflector carry much less flow (2 to 3 times)
than the rest of the holes.

result of slight thermocouple protrusion (~0.002

which was not far enough away from the enkonce
for uniform turbulent flow to be definitely es-
tablished.

Measurements of the axial fluid temperature
amplitude attenuation in turbulent flow through a
straight tube as a result of heat exchange with the
tube wall were made for comparison with theo-

results from

retical predictions for metal and plastic wolls.
In addition, the results enabled an estimate of the
wall attenuation ratio to be made, independent
of direct wall measurements, which is in reosonable
agreement with the Jakob equation. This work is
being continued.

High-Frequency Thermal-Cycling Test Loop

A. G. Smith, Je.3)

The high-frequency thermal-cycling test loop,
described previously,?? wos completed, and
Fig. 1.4.27 shows the pulse generator, pulse pump,
and test piece. The pulse generator consists of
two pistons which produce helium pressure pulses
180-deg out of phose. These pressure pulses are
transmitted to the pulsers which force alternate
hot and cold slugs of fluid through the test piece.
A helium bubbler type of level device is used to
record and control the fluid level in the pulse
pump. The maximum and minimum fluid temper-
otures will be 1650 and 1150°F, respectively,

oture of £250°F. The frequency of these pulses
con be varied from 0.5 ta 10 cps. The maximum
flow anticipated is 12 gpm, which will permit a
calculated heat transfer coefficient. of 5500
Btu/hrft2°F in the test section, a Hin. sched-40
pipe.

Most of the control panel is shown in Fig. 1.4.28,
including the gas panels for both the high- ond
low-temperature loops and sumps, alarm and motor
control panels, and two of the four Yariac cabinets.
There are two 16-point Brown temperature recorders,
and each contains an integral high- or low-temper-
ature alorm os a safety measure. These recorders
will monitor the 150 thermocouples mounted on the
loop. The four Varioc cabinets contain 42 separate
control circuits for preheating ond for normal
secondory heating. The 250-kva transformer for
main loop resistonce heat ond the auxiliory gas
panel are not shown.

The loop hos operated sotisfactorily at design
specifications with water, and data are being taken
on temperature amplitudes as the test section as a
function of frequency and flow rate. This infor-
mation will form a basis for high-temperature
operation. Some control difficulties have occurred
during startup and shutdown, but these are being
eliminated, The woter tests will be continued
until thorough familiarization with the operation
is achieved.

Cold Traps and Plugging Indicators
R. D. Peak D. A. Gardiner

Plugging indicators ore required in each of the
eight NaK cold-trap circuits of the ART to monitor
the sodium oxide level. The plugging indicator

same as the type which hos been used successfully
on all the heat exchanger test stands during the
past two years. Since the plugging indicators
used in the heat exchonger tests were never
calibrated, calibration tests of an ART prototype

The results of a fypical test with the ART
plugging indicator are shown in Fig. 1.4.29. The
test is started by turning the Calrod heater off ond
the cooling air on so that the NaK flowing through
the plugging plate gradually cools. At a certain
temperature the NaK flow rate storts decreasing
abruptly because precipitated oxide has begun to
plug holes in the plugging plate. This temperature,
called the break temperature becouse of the change
in flow rate, is on indication of the oxide content
of the NaK. After the break temperature is de-
termined, the air is turned off and the Calrod is
turned on in order to dissolve the precipitated
oxide,

All plugging indicator tests were made at o
nominal NoK flow rote of 0.5 gpm. Experience on
the heat exchanger test stands has shown that the
break temperoture is insensitive to this flow rate.
Since the flow rates in ART applicotion may vary,
data on pressure drop vs flow rate were obtained
and are shown in Fig. 1.4.30. Air flow rates were
also voried, and it was found that the break temper-
ature was duplicated to within 5°F at o 400°F
breck temperature with air flow rates varying from
30 to 80 scfm, and to within 20°F at a 800°F break
temperature with air flow rates varying from 8 to 40
scfm. The air pressure drop is shown in Fig.
1.4.31.

The plugging indicator wos calibrated against
chemical anolyses for sodium oxide obtained by
the Argonne sampler distillation method.34 The
chemical anolyses showed much greater inherent
variations thon did the breok temperatures. In on
attempt to determine the causes for these vari-
ations, the Argonne sampler data were subjected
to the standard techniques of analysis of variance.
There appeared to be no significant differences
in instrumentation or sampler units from test to
test, but somples taken by one technician were
significantly higher in sodium oxide thon those
obtained by the other nine technicians. The
standard deviotion of the analyses was very large
and increased as the number of the anolyses
Although 86 samples were taken, only
46 were analyzed successfully and used for the

however, and the obove phenomenon may not occur

Three tests of AIO, reaction traps, also
described previously, 38 were conducted in order to
determine the effect of temperature on the Al 0O.-

The reaction products fused in the tests made at
1600 ond 1700°F, but they did not fuse in the

was coused either by the formation of complex
reaction products or by impurities in the ALLO,

ART-ETU REACTOR CONSTRUCTION
AND ASSEMBLY

G. D. Whitman
H. M. Abele C. K. McGlothlan
G. W. Peach

The schedule for ossembly of the ETU ond ART
reactors was revised on the basis of delayed
delivery of components being produced by outside
vendors. It is planned to increase the local shop
load by transferring the fabricotion of all pres-
sure shells, additional strut-load ring assemblies
and filter plates from outside vendors’ plonts to
the shops at the Y-12 plant. The local shop is
fabricating the ETU north head and will assemble
the reactors.

The detailed design of the reactor is essentially
complete, with some work remaining to be done on
the design of the sodium annuli surrounding the
fuel overflow, off-gas, and fill-ond-drain lines.
Numerous design changes have been made based
on further design studies, development tests,
component fabrication difficulties, and weld shrink-
age tests. The status of the major reactor sub-
assemblies and components is described befow,

North-Head Assembly

Work has been stopped on assembly of the north
head pending the arrival of the sodium-to-NaK
heat exchangers. The lower deck assembly has
been fabricated; the lower deck skirt has been hot
formed ond rough machined; and numerous other
small subassemblies have been completed. Ap-
proximately 30% of the assembly work is completed.
The work on the sodium-to-NaK heat exchangers
is now progressing at a more satisfactory rate
than previously. All 30 of the offset-bend-forming
dies hove been completed. The Griscom-Russell
Co. has completed assembling the tubes for the
first unit, and assembly of the tubes to the headers
of the second unit has been started.
brazes are now being made, and it is felt that no
further brazing development work will be needed.

surface. An upper beryllium hemisphere is com-
plete, except for contouring the top surface im-
mediately below the two sodium coolant inlet
pipes.
Fig. 1.5.1 during the machining operations on the
top surface. A second set of beryllium hemi spheres
for the ART has been received, and hole-dritling
operations are nearly complete in the lower half.

Work is progressing on o strut-load ring as-
sembly, ond the struts have been welded to the
upper ring. The load ring forging has been re-
ceived from the outside fabricator, and machining
operations have storted on this piece.

The majority of the boron carbide tiles, and
spares, required for two reactors have been re-
ceived, and no difficulty is anticipated in obtaining
the remoinder. The fabricatorof the stoinless-steel-
clod boron-copper shielding has hod difficulty in
rofling the material to desired tolerances, and a
relaxation in the toleronce on ratio of cladding to
cermet in the matrix has been authorized. Dif
ficulty has been encountered in rolling o product

This beryllium component is shown in

thot is consistently acceptable metollurgicolly,
ond more development work remains to be done on
this operation.

The fabrication of Inconel shells, notably the
islond and outer fuel core shells, continues to be
ao major problem. The effort has been concentrated
on the shear spinning process, and to date no
completely satisfactory component has been pro-
duced. The development problem has turned out
to be more difficult thon originally estimoted.
Raw material quality requirements have had to be
improved in that the surface finish must be better
than thet normolly obtained in the stock sizes
used. The physical properties of the material,
particulorly hardness and grain size, must be
carefully controlled throughout the forming process
to prevent cracking. The tool forces on the stock
during final forming of the inner and outer fuel
core shells produce resultant forces that tend to
pull the shells away from the mondrel. This
occurs because of the reverse curve in these
shells, and several light sizing passes have had
10 be employed to ocquire satisfactory dimensional
control.

Despite these problems a dimensionally ac-
ceptable outer shell has been produced, but over-

pickling after one of the heot-treating operations
has resulted in excessive intergranular attack. It
is possible thot the surface of the shell may be
cleaned without going below the tolerance on wall
thickness.

A small parallel program has been initiated in an
effort to fabricate the thin core shells by hot
forming oversized parts and then finish machining
them to final thickness. This seems fo be a more
positive approach to the problem; however, the
metallurgical risks are theoretically greater since
thicker stock, in which there is greater chance for
flows, must be used, and there is none of the cold
working of the row material which is beneficial to
the metallurgical structure if properly controlled,

Island and Pressure Shell Liner

One set of beryllium island ports is complete,
including the instaliation of the spacer ferrules.

66

No acceptable Inconel shell parts have been
produced, however, as discussed above.

The lower section of the pressure shell liner is
now to be fabricated by hot pressing and machining
inlieu of combination cold forming, shear spinning,
and machining. It is felt that the present plon is
a safer approach, since there were so many un-
knowns in the cold forming ond shear spinning
aspects of the original plon. Bids for the fabricae-
tion of this component are being evaluated.

No fabrication work has been done to date on the
Y g-inthick shells to cover the shielding in the
reactor. It is planned to fabricate the spherical
sections of these parts by spinning and to fabri-
cate the other sections by cold pressing.

Fuel-to-NoK Heat Exchangers

The dual effort on fuel-to-NoK heat exchanger
fabrication was evaluated, and Black, Sivells &
Bryson was selected as the fobricator. All jigs,
tool's, and fixtures ordered and made by York Corp.
are being transferred to Black, Sivalls & Bryson.

In the course of machining the first channel at
Black, Sivalls & Bryson an error was discovered
in the IBM doto which was used to construct the
cam. Corrections were mode and the second
channel machined showed the machining method to
be satisfactory but demonstrated the need for
changes in the method of forming the rough chan-
nel. The third chonnel is now being machined,
and the second channel will be incorporated into a
rough prototype assembly. The resistance-heating
method of setting the tubes appears to be satis-
factory, and enough tubes for the prototype have
been formed.

Assembly Methods Development

Weld shrinkage tests have continued, with a
total of 24 tests being completed for the welds
required for the Y%-, Y-, and l-in.-thick reactor
shells. These tests have been performed in order
to determine the magnitude of transverse ond
radial shell shrinkage as a result of the welding
and to develop welding fixtures and procedures
that wil} enable reasonably accurate prediction of
shrinkage, distortion, and quality of the reactor
core shell welds.

Test results have indicated that transverse
shrinkage can be predicted to within +0.010 in.
for Yein-thick shells. Insufficient tests have
been run with the heavier shell sections to esti-
mate shrinkage voriation. Very little success hos
been obtained in controlling the radial shrinkage.
The concentricity of the parts hos been held to
within 0.010 in. totel indicoted reading, but the
amount of radial shrinkage has varied from negligi-
ble valves to 0.050 in. in the in thick shells.
Many of the tests have been performed on very
poor quality rejected spun shells which have been
very difficult to weld. The tests on shells that
were closer to the required metallurgical and
dimensional specifications hove given much more
usable welding dato.
shell and welding fixture are shown in Fig. 1.5.2.
This fixture is used in a lathe to align and support
the shell during the welding operations.

An inner fuel-annulus core

The first test on the I-in.-thick, 54-in.-dia hoops
that simulated the reactor pressure shells showed
the necessity of changing the reactor design to
accommodate the radial shrinkage. These hoops

pulled in almost Y in. on the radius. The pressure
shell design was changed from 1- to Jin. thick-
ness at the weld by tapering the cross section
above the equator on the inner surface so that
radial shrinkage would not restrict the flow pos-
sage or interfere with the shell liner. Additional
tests must be performed on the thicker shells, and
preparations ore under way now to perform these
tests,

Tests hove been completed on spot welding
0.100-in.-thick stainless-steel-clod Cu-B,C cermet
shielding material to 0.250-in.~thick Inconel, and
satisfactory results were obtained. Satisfactory
results have also been obtained in spot welding
the 0.005-in.-shick stainless steel cons of the
copper-coated B,C tiles to the stainless steel
cladding of the Cu-B,C cermets.

The reactor assembly procedures are being re-
viewed continually, and revisions are being in-
corporoted as design changes and better assembly
techniques are conceived. The reactor assembly
area is complete except for one main section of
floor reinforcement. The security enclosure around
the assembly, inspection, cleaning, and storage
areos is complete, and isolation from the remainder
of the building will be effected when major reactor
assembly operations begin.

Major efforts will be expended on these items
since they affect the facility completion date.
Some of these items are still in the development
and testing stage, and therefore delivery dates
cannot be quoted. Flowmeters are being coli-
brated in NaK pump component development tests.
The delivery of these flowmeters is contingent
upon the calibration test results, which are, in
turn, contingent upon the success of the NaK
pump tests.

The NaK-to-air radiators are being fabricated by
the York Corp., ond severol development problems
in brazing techniques must be resolved before a

brazed fin sections hove been produced, but a
recent design change makes the fin bank more
flexible, and sagging may occur during the brazing
cycles.

The lube oil systems are nearly completed, but

A re-evaluation of the ETU program has brought
about several changes in connection with items to
be placed within the test cell that simulates the
ART ceil. The equatorial and south-heod lead
shielding on the ETU has been eliminated, and
this part of the shield contract with Knapp Mills
was canceled. Design ond fabrication of the
equatorial section of the ART lead shielding was
stopped until a review of the shielding require-
ments con be completed. This review and neces-
sary engineering work is to be completed by
June 1, 1957. The design of the south-head shield
is being continued by the vendor.

Contracts for detail design and fabrication of
the ART fuel fill-and-droin tank and reactor sup-
port structures wese canceled. The detailed lay-

The ETU fuel fill-and-drain tank supports that
have been fabricated will have to be reworked
because design changes hove increased the length
of these supports.

The present status of procurement and fabrica-
tion of other components is given below:

1. The ETU fuel fill-and-drain tank hos been
received,

2. Prototype fuel dump volves have been re-

ART NaK manifolds has been let to the Midwest
Piping Company, and they are now in the process
of doing development work on bends ond nozzle-
to-header welds and of qualifying welders.

5. Design of the hydraulic oil piping inside the
cell has been completed, and purchase orders were
issued for procurement of the materials required
for both the ETU and the ART cells.

6. The sodium system plugging indicator for use
on the ETY and the two ART auxiliary piping
junction panels were completed.

Contract work on the ART facility hos been
contracted in four stages established by the design
program. The first two stages, packages | and

additions, cell instollation, and installation of
auxiliary services piping, have been completed.
The third stage, package 2, which included the
instaliotion of diesel generators and facility, efec-
trical control centers, and spectrometer-raom elec
trical ond air conditioning equipment, wos com-
pleted on February 20, 1957. The fourth stage,
package 3A, which includes a distribution system
for supplying electrical power to the pipe heaters
and equipment heaters, a dry-air plant, and a build:
ing to house the air plamt and wound-rotor-motor
controllers, is 28.2% complete.

As reported previously, the contract for package
3A work wus awarded to the Rentenbach Engineer-
ing Company, effective December 7, 1956, af a
contract price of $114,434, with o contract com-
pletion date of Aprid 25, 1957.

Work periormed during the quarter on package 2
included the completion of installation of anchor
bolts and support plates in the penthouse wolls,
wiring of diesel-generator control ponels, tests of
the oir compressor and fuel oil piping for the
diesel units, and diesel-generator equipment op-
erational and performance tests.

During the testing of the diesel-generator equip-
ment the Coterpillar unit generator bearings were
damaged because of improper lubrication ond had
to be replaced. The control equipment required
minor design ond wiring changes. The performance
testing consisted in opesating each generofor in
parallel with a common generator and loading with
two 250-hp main blowers, which is approximately
60% of full capacity of the two units. Necessary
voltoge-regulater, and cross-current-
compensotor adjustments were made fo give sotis-
factory load and current division. The five gen-
erator units were paralleled and satisfactorily
loaded with the available load. Additicnal per-

cutting device used to remove the ART from the
test cell. The locations of lines within the test
cell have been studied to assure their accessi-
bility if they must be severed with a remotely
controlled device. The detailed operations to be
undertaken in the hot cell ore also being studied.
In general, welds will be cut away and the reactor
components will be removed in the reverse order of
their assembly.

Conceptual designs based on the interlocking
drifled or milled hole method of disassembly have
been made for the principal items of heavy equip-
ment needed in the hot cell. The interlocking
hole technique was selected because it permits
the greatest flexibility in the cut location with the
minimum spread of activity. it is planned currently
that the two main hot-cell tools will be a turntable
mounted on a hydraulic lift, which will support
the reactor, and a Bridgeport type of universal
milling head carried on a cantilever floor mount,
which will drive the cutting tool.

Tentative design criteria were prepared for the
proposed disassembly facility. A large hot cell,

A Yp-scale model of the hos cell is now ovail-
abje. It is onticipoted that the model will be a
substantial oid in visualizing and analyzing the
complex hot-cell techniques. The model is shown
in Fig. 1.5.3 with the approximately 57-in.-dia
reactor mounted on a tumtable after the water and
lsad shields have been removed. Two floor-
mounted milling machines are shown forward of the
turntable, and proposed carriers for two overhead
manipulators and a 30-tfon crane are shown over
head. The longitudinal openings in the cell wal
will provide means for determining optimum loca-
tions for viewing windows. Beyond the reactor can
be seen a tank for decontamination of parts, as
well as several parts and tools lying on fhe floor.
The openings in the floor of each room provide
access to the proposed underground tunnel for
transfer of hot materials to storage or to smaller
hot cells for subsequent component parts dis-
assembly and close examination work.

ART OPERATION PLANNING

A critical review of the reactor system oper-
ability is being made, and conflicts among the
design, construction, and instrumentation phases
of the project are being resolved. A study was
made of the manpower required during the various
phases of operation of the ETU and the ART and
the disossembly of the ART. The peak work load
during operation of the ART will require 40
engineers and 18 technicians. Although the ETU
operating crew will be chout one third this size,
all ART operating personnel will receive ETU

majority of project engineers have no experience
in nuclear operotions, arrangements are being
made for training in the theoretical aspects of

to provide for the containment of activity in the
event of concurrent heat exchanger ond radiator
leaks, the NaK system pressure will be maintained
above that of the fuel ot all points where o leak
between the two systems could occur. In the
event of a leak or leoks, this pressure will be
maintained until either the activity has decayed fo
below seriously hazardous levels, or the NaK

clamps in order to seal the activity in the reactor
away from the radiator leaks.

Further studies of the off-gas system have indi-
cated the advisability of directing the reactor off-
gas through the ZrF,-vapor trap on the reactor
without the option of using the vapor trap on the
fill-and-drain tank if the reactor trap became re-
stricted. Thus, the vopor trop on the fill-ond-
drain tank will never receive vapor from the reac-
tor and should be in good condition when needed
during o dump. Thus, it is expected thas normal
operation could continue without increased hazard
even though the reactor vapor trap became re-
stricted. Provisions are being made to bypass
both traps. The equalizer line around the reactor
vapor trap witl be used during every dump, but the
byposs around the vapor trap of the fill-ond-drain
tank will be for one-time emergency use only.
Appropriate development tests that will simulate
the different conditions to which the two traps will
be subjected are to be performed. Unfortunately,
it wifl not be possible to include fission gas heat-
ing, 20 w/cm®, in these tests. The postpower
fuel-sompling system aad the helium supply vent
and bypass provisions to the fuel expansion tank
are to be tested also.

The effect of xenon solubility in the ART fuel
on the ability of the helium purge system toremove
the xenon hos been studied,” ond recent meas-
urements have established a value for the solu-
bility of xenon in the proposed reactor fuel (see
Chap. 2.2, *‘Chemical Reactions in Molten Salts’).
Therefore it wos possible to predict the amount of
xenon that will remain in the fuel for any given
purge condition.3 Measurements will be taken in
the ART of the xenon poisoning, which when com-
pared with the calculated xenon poison effects
should give a measure of the purging efficiency of
the ART xenon removol system.

Procedures were prepared for filling the various
systems with helium by pressurization and venting
and for filling the NaK system with NaK. Although

bleed lines will have to be installed in the special
NaK systems in order to fill the fill-and-drain tonk
tubes and annulus with NaK, recent pump tests
indicate that the trapped gos in the auxiliary NaK
system may be removed by the pump. [f this is not
so, bleed lines will have to be added to both
auxiliory NaK systems. A drain line will be in-
stalled in each of the two special NaK systems in
order to remove the NaK from the fili-and-drain
tonk. There will be some holdup of NaK in all
NaK systems, but they will be flushed with
kerosene and alcohol prior to disassembly.

Two independent analyses are to be made of the
ART off-gas. First, o source from a branch of the
off-gas line will be analyzed with o gamma-ray
spectrometer. Because of the complexity of this
off-gas and because of background, Compton scat-
tering, shielding, and other effects, use of a 5-in.
crystal is plonned. The output of the crystal will
be analyzed with o 256-chonnel analyzer. For the
second analysis o suitable gas chromatography
method will be used.

As a result of the various design studies, sev-
eral significant chonges have been made in the
ART instrumentation and controls. The pressure
regulator bypass around the fill-and-drain tank
vent valves has been removed, and a pressure
regulator has been added to the helium supply to
provide better contro! and to limit the maximum
pressure available for the filling operation. As
stated above, an equalizer line has been provided
from a point downstream of the vapor trap on the
fill-and-drain tank to cach of the fuel pump helium
inlets to permit a fuel dump in the prescribed time
even in the event that the reactor vapor trap is
plugged. The equalizer line contains two solenoid
valves in parallel, and check valves are located
both in these bypass fines ond in the helium supply
tines where the two join chead of both fuel pumps.
The solenoid volves will be interlocked fo open
when the fuel drain valves are opened, ond they
will be manually operable from the control room at
other times.

A line from the helium supply will be provided
to admit gas into the fil}-and-drain tank to periodi-
cally test the vapor trap for plugs. This line will
have o fixed orifice ond will include a solenoid
valve, a pressure transmitter, and a check volve.
The solenoid volves will be operated from the
control room where the pressure will be continu-
ously recorded.

74

The frangible-disk-operated valve for bypassing
the vapor trap on the fill-and-drain tank will be en-
ergized on an emergency basis in the event of a
plug in this vapor trap. A separate nitrogen supply
has been provided for enecgizing the valve. The
downstream taps of the two fuel expansion tank
level indicators were moved to improve the reli-
ability of the instruments in the event of a plug of
the reactor vapor trop.

Provisions were made for venting the gas from
the NaK pumps and dump tanks through a common
vent header to the cell off-gas line. Two vacuum
pumps in parallel with a bypass line and an isola-
tion volve were provided in the cell off-gas line
upstream of the charcoal bed ond sample station.
With these provisions it will be possible to main-
tain the cell at o pressure of 5 psia so that in the
event of concurrent radiator and heat exchanger
leaks, the cell may act as o sink for activity by
venting the reactor fuel system to the cell. A vent
connection was provided from the reactor off-gas
line to the cell atmosphere that consists of a
frangible-disk volve and a solenoid valve in a tee
in the off-gas line downstream from the pressure
control valve which maintains the reactor expan-
sion tank pressure.

ETU OPERATION PLANNING

C. W. Cunningham R. A. Dreisbach
S. M. DeCamp

The operation of the ETU is prerequisite to that
of the ART, ond the maintenance of ETU flow
sheets, instrument lists, and valve tabulations is
being emphasized. An instrument opplication
tabulation was prepared which gives maximum,
minimum, and normal values of the quantities to
be measured, as well as the type of pickup instru-
ment, location, and number required and the foca-
tion, type, accuracy, and range for the reading
instruments by which the various quantities are
presented. A valve tobulation is currently being
prepored.

A preliminary control block diagrom wos used as
a basis for preparing a list of “‘emergency condi-
tions for ETU operations.'' There will be no em-
ergency conditions in the nuclear sense for the
ETU reactor, but for training purposes it is pro-
posed to set up annuaciations of emergencies
similar fo those provided for in ART operation
planning, and insofor as possible the same pro-
cedures will be followed as would be required by
such on emergency during ART operation.

ART DISASSEMBLY PROCEDURES
W. B. Cottrell

W. E. Browning R. P. Shields

A number of studies have been made of proce
dures for disassembling the ART, including dis-
posal of radioactive materials. Water used to
spray the inside of the test cell after operation of
the ART will be highly contaminated. The Health
Physics Division has recommended that this water
be taken by truck to the tank farm at X-10. The
Operations Division has a tank truck with o
shielded cab and has indicated thot it can be used
for this purpose. One stipulation is that the water
must be slightly alkaline. The problem of sodium
and NeK disposal is still being investigated.

The method for effecting the remote cutting op-
erations required within the test cel! for removal
of equipment is being studied, and several dis-
advontages of o proposed underwater operation
have developed, The following factors are perti-
nent to this study.

1. Iron oxide and hydroxide are good scavengers
for many types of radioactivity, especially stron-
tium, and can be expected to concentrate activity.

2. The following radiation levels would exist
above the surfoce of water containing the indi-
cated concentrations of radioactive strontium:

Dose 10 in, Above
Sucface (mr/he)

Concentration of Activity in
the Water (curies/ml}

0.35 18
1.5 85
1.9 110

3. Lead oxide metal paint adsorbs activity and
is not easily decontaminated.

4. Buoyancy and solubility effects in underwater
cutting tend to remove contaminated materials
from partially restricted areas where they might
undisturbed in a gaseous atmosphere.
Therefore, greater precautions must be taken to
prevent escape of activity.

IN.PILE EXPERIMENTATION
J. A. Conlin
In-Pile Loops

A shift of emphasis in ART supporting research
has resulted in the cancellation of further in-pile
loop tests of zirconium-fluoride-base fuels in
lnconel systems. The information thus far ob-
tained from the in-pile loop program has verified
the results obtained through irradiation of capsules
and through out-of-pile corrosion tests. The
irradiation tests indicate that no substantiol
change in fuel properties of corrosion rate is to
be expected because of radiation. Further in-pile
loop tests will be initiated when suitable nickel-
molybdenum alloys and lithium-base fuels are
available.

In-pile loop No. 6, the operation of which was
described previously? was cut up at NRTS and
returned to the ORNL hot-cell facilities where it
is owaiting disassembly and metallographic ex-
amination.

Prototype [n-Pile Pump

Future in-pile loop work will require a pump
capable of operating for longer times and at higher
temperatures than those used thus far. Therefore
a development program hos been initiated to ex-
tend the established operating range of the in-pile
pump.
foop operation, the pump should be capable of
operating at 1500°F at about 150% of the present
solt flow requirement and for 2000 hr. The shofts
of each of the first two test pumps seized after
approximately 1000 hr of operation as a result of
zirconium fluoride accumulation around the shaft
slinger. A third test, previously described,” was
set up for which a zirconium fluoride vapor trap of
alumina was used ond the circulated fuel mixture
was NaF-ZrF UF, (56-39-5 mole %, fuel 70).
This pump satisfactorily met the required condi-
tions by completing the 2000-hr test at 1500°F and

1.75 gpm ot a 19-ft head. Postrun disassembly
showed all pump parts to be in the as-built condi-
tion, There was some zirconium fluoride buildup
on the pump housing surrounding the slinger but
not enough to contact the shaft. The alumina in
the vapor trap, which had operated for its design
life, appeared fo be fused and the trap was almost
plugged; no difficulty had been ex-
perienced with the purge flow through the trap.

The results of the test justify the use of this
pump in in-pile loops with maximum temperotures
in the range of 1600 to 1650°F, which correspond
to a pump temperature of 3500°F. This conclusion
carries the limitation for zirconium-fluoride-base
fuels, however, that the zirconium fluoride vapor
pressure at pump temperatures must not exceed
that of this test, 3.6 mm Hg. Loop flow and test
duration may also be increased safely over the
previous fimits.

pump for injecting 0.12 gpm of water into the inlet
oir stream through a small showerhead nozzle.
Preliminary calculotions indicated that about 15 kw
of heat should be absorbed by the heat of vaporiza-
tion of the water alone. The test results showed
an increase of only 2 to 3 kw, however, at oll air
flows. It was apparent that cémplete vaporization
of the water was not obtained. Further develop-
ment of this system was dropped because of the
complications foreseen in developing on efficient
water dispersion system for in-pile use. A second
test heat exchanger with machined nickel fins has
been designed and fabrication has been started.

In-Pile Test of Moderator Material
C. C. Bolta

The first in-pile test of moderator materials for
use at high temperatures was completed. In this
test four samples of beryllium oxide were irradiated
in the HB-3 beam hole during two MTR cycles with
gamma heat estimated af between 2 and 5 w/g and
a fast neutron flux of about 10'3 neutrons/cm?.sec.
The high-temperature end of the capsule was
normaly at obout 1500°F. The capsule was
thermally cycled 32 times os a result of reactor
power fluctuations, with temperature differentials
ranging from 200 to 1400°F. The results of ex-
amination of the irradiated specimens are pre-
sented in Chap. 4.1, “Radiation Damage.”

To obtain quantitative information on the fluid

imposed on a grid photograph. The grid is ploced
within the test section so that it lies in the plane
of the collimated light beam used to obtain the

HEAT TRANSFER IN REFLECTOR-MODERATED

ART Core Heat Transfer

The hydrodynamic experiments in which screens
were used in the 10/44-scale plastic core model
indicoted the need for further volume-heat-source
studies of a similar geometry. A heat-generation
analysis has shown that a number of fine-mesh
plastic screens can be placed

of the flux field. In the pores of the screens (the
region in which the flux density is highest) the
heat generated will be 2) times that in the free
fluid. The effect of these regions of high tem-
perature on the over-all temperature field is made
negligible by two factors: (1) the volume of fluid
affected is only a very small percentage of the
total fiuid volume, and (2) the stringers of high-
temperoture fluid issuing from the screen pores
are rapidly dissipated in the highly turbulent
wakes behind the screen wires. Such local in-
creases in heat generation would be limited to
resistance-heated systems, and thus similar screens
in the ART core would not be subjected to the
higher temperatures. Wall-temperature
urements will be made in the regions between the

A volume-heat-source experiment was designed
that utilizes the vortex flow principle. For these
measurements a uniform volume heat source will
be generated electrically within a sulfuric acid
solution flowing through on insulated cylindrical

created by vanes in the entrance section of the
tube. Both steady-stote and transient temperature
measurements will be obtained by using surface,

mocouples will be located at the tube exit and
will provide a radial traverse of the tube.

THERMAL-CYCLING EXPERIMENTS
H.W. Hoffman D. P. Gregory®

Studies with the system for thermally cycling
Inconel tubing were continued in order to determine
the effects of fluctuating temperatures and stresses
on Inconel exposed to flowing NaF-ZrF UF,
(50-46-4 mole %, fuel 30). The results obtained
to date are summorized in Tobles 1.7.1, 1.7.2,
and 1.7.3. Figures 1.7.7 through 1.7.14 show the
maximum penetration observed in the test sections
used for the experiments described in Tables
1.7.1, 1.7.2, and 1.7.3.

In order to investigate the pessible effect on
the depth of attack in Inconel of the interaction
between the heater section and the test section
and of the heater length, an experiment was per-
formed (ET-S) in which the entire 12-in. test unit
served as a heoter. The heater was subjected to

temperature cycling under the same wall-temper-
ature-difference conditions as existed in the test
sections used in runs ET-H ond ET-O. The test
unit for run ET-H was divided into a 4-in. heoter
and an B-in. test section, while the test unit for
run ET-O wos on 8-in. heater and o 4-in. test
section. From the dota in Table 1.7.1, it may be
seen thot the general subsurfoce-void formation
was approximately the same in oll three test
sections. However, the ET-H test section showed
deeper intergranular stringers than the ET-O test
section. The specimen taken from the test unit
for run ET-S showed a tendency toward inter-
granular attack in the regions of deepest pen-
etration. The exposure times for runs ET-H and
ET-O were approximately the same, while run
ET-S losted 16 hr less than ET-H. Although it
is difficult to draw specific conclusions on the
bosis of these three runs alone, it appears thot
the heoter-test section interaction and the heater
length may not have significant effects on attack
in this thermal-cycling system. This resuls
possibly could have been predicted on the bosis
of the surface area-to-velume ratios in the system.

The results of run ET-S probably connot be
compared directly with those from runs ET-H and
ET-O from the stress standpoint. The temperature
difference across the volume-heoted metal wall
of the ET-S test section was less thon that of
the test sections used for runs ET-H ond ET-O.
Since the thermally induced stress is a function
of the temperature grodient in the woll, it is to
be expected thot the stresses in sun ET-S were
lower than those in runs ET-H ond ET-0. There-
fore, run ET-T was made under temperature and
geometry conditions identical to those of run ET-S
with, however, continuous thermal cycling. Since
run ET-T lasted for 97 hr, while run ET-$ lasted
for only 50 hr, the test unit used for run ET-T
was at the system maximum temperature approxi-
motely four times as long os was the test unit
used for run ET-5. A comparison of Figs. 1.7.12
ond 1.7.13 shows thot somewhot deeper attack
occurred in run ET-T than in run ET-S. Further,
while the number of voids in the specimen from
run ET-T is less than in the specimen from run
ET-S, the ET-T voids are much larger. Additional
doto must be obtained before hypotheses can be
based on these results.

The series of runs ET-O, ET-P, and ET-Q was
designed to obtain a comparison of the effects of

low-frequency, high-frequency, and isothermal

Enthalpy and Heat Capacity

The enthalpy and heot copacity for the mixture
NaF-Z:F -UF, (50-25-25 mole %) were redeter-
mined with the use of the copper-block calorimeter.
In the previous measurements made with the use
of Bunsen ice calorimeters, the heat capacity of
this mixture was found to be 10.90 cal/g-atom,
which wos considerobly higher than the average of
8.11 cal/g-atom found for all the other zirconium
fluoride~containing salts studied.® It wos felt
thot this difference resulted in part from the high
melting temperature of the saolt mixture ond the
subsquent
the liquid was tested. The more precise measure-
ment capable in the copper-block
resulted in a new value of 9.16 cal/g-atom for the
NoF-ZeF -UF, (50-2525 mole %) mixture. The

Measurements are being made for obtaining the
heat of fusion of the compound UF,. To date only
the enthalpy and the heat copocity in the solid

After several measurements of the liquid state
(melting point of UF, = 1036°C) were made, the
capsules had weakened and one broke. A stronger
capsule wos therefore designed and is now being
fabricated. The enthalpy data from both the solid
ond the liquid stote measurements will be used to
establish the heat of fusion of UF.

Thermal Conductivity

The variable-gap device for the measurement of
thermal conductivity was redesigned to eliminate
the effects of varying the heating rate. Erratic
results were obtained from measurements with two
somples of the mixture NaF-ZiF -UF, (56-39-5
mole %) as the rate of heat flow was voried. The
first modification of the system involved provisions
for the measurement of the heat flow above ond
below the sample, and the modified system is
currently being tested with liquids of known thermal
conductivity. The design of a second device that
incorporates @ major modification of the varioble-
gap device was completed. The new design in-
corporates three sets of individually controllable

in addition to a number of external guard heaters.
Provisions were also made for many times the
present number of thermocouples. With the many
more heating circuits and thermocouples, it should
be possible to ensure that one-dimensional heat
flow will exist in the salt sample regardless of
the rate of heat input.

Electrical Conductivity

An Inconel conductivity cell for use in determining
the specific electrical conductivity of liquid sodium
and sodium-potassium alloy wos designed and
fabricated. The purpose of this investigation is
to obtain reliable, abselute values of the con-
ductivities of these metals in the temperature
ronge of 200 to 1400°F for use in calibrating the
ART electromagnetic flowmeters. The measure-
ments of sodium-potassium alloys will cover those

MODIFICATION OF APPARATUS FOR
THERMAL ANALYSIS

H, A, Friedman

Thermal analysis has been the most important
exploratory technique used in phase-equilibrium
studies at ORNL. For such analyses relatively
large charges of melt (50 to 200 g) are maintained
under a flowing atmosphere of helium and are
stired to assure homogeneity and to minimize
temperature gradients in the liquid. Since several
thermal excursions through the solidus and liquidus
ara used in each experiment, mixtures containing
high concentrations of a volatile constituent
change appreciably in composition during the ex-
periment.

In order to minimize the losses by vaporization,
a simple modification was mode to the apparatus.
The thermal anolysis crucible is fitted with a disk
of graphite that is drilled to accommodate the
stirrer shaft and the thermocouple well. The
diameter of the graphite disk is 0.1 in. less thon
the inside diameter of the crucible. When the
charge of salt is melted, the graphite disk floats
on the molten mixture, whose free surface is thus
reduced nearly to zero. By using this technique
it has been possible to subject samples containing
80 mole % ZrF to thermal analysis with negligible
loss in weight of the sample.

VISUAL OBSERVATION AND DIFFERENTIAL
THERMAL ANALYSIS OF SMALL
QUANTITIES OF FUSED SALTS

R. J. Sheil

The Leitz vacuum hot.stage microscope, which
it was hoped could be used for visual observation
of small quantities of fused salts in an inert
atmosphere ot high temperatures, was found to be

and made measurements of melt temperotures ex-
tremely unreliable. Since equipment that permits
thermal date to be obtained with less than 1 g
quantities of fused salts would be highly desirable
for work with radioactive or toxic materials, the
experience obtained with the commercial equipment
was utilized in designing a new vacuum fumace
that is adaptable to microscopic observation. This
apparatus contains two concentric tubes of Alundum
or other suitable insulating material. The inner
tube is wound with a spiral of platinum-thodium
wire to provide resistance heating. A cylindricot
nickel block 1 in. in diometer ond 1 in, in
thickness hos a Y-in.-dia tube drilled in it to
provide a sample compartment which can be lined
with thin metal foil to facilitate removal of fused-
salt samples. The furnace is enclosed in a
vacuum-tight container equipped with a glass
window through which the samples can be observed
by means of o low-power microscope. Melt temper-
atires are measured with a thermocouple junction
immersed directly in the melt.

This apparatus wos tested initially for visual
observation of liquidus and solidus temperatures
by using approximately 0.15 g of the NaF-KF-LiF
eutectic as the test material. When the sample
was heated at a rate of about 17°C/min, volves
ranging from 444 to 457°C were obtained for the
first appearance of liquid and from 464 to 475°C
for complete melting. More consistent results were

 

 

obteined upon cooling ot approximately the same
cote. Values ranging from 455 to 460°C for the
first appearance of crystals and from 451 to 460°C
for the solidus temperature were observed. A
value of 459.5 1 1.5°C for the freezing point of
this mixture wos obtained by a different method
by another ORNL investigator.2 The use of slower
heating and cooling rates would uvadoubtedly
improve the reproducibility of the data, but these
preliminary visual observations indicated that
reasonably accurate melt temperatures can be
measured with only 150 mg of material.

block, symmetrically arranged, and two opposed
thermocouple junctions, one for the sample ond
the other for the reference material (alumina),
were introduced. The instrumentation is the some
as that previously used for similar determinations.
A Leeds & Northrup d-c amplifier is used to
amplify the difference in emf between the opposed
junctions before it is fed into an X-Y recorder.
The temperature of the sample is recorded on the
Y-axis of the recorder. Sharp breaks in the differ-
ential trace were obtained with the NaF-KF-LiF
eutectic in both the heoting and the cooling cycles.
The heating breaks in three experiments varied
from 457 to 459°C, and the cooling breaks occurred
at 461 and 459°C.

The principal difficulty observed with this oppa-
ratus has been foilure to keep NaF-ZrF, mixtures

composition of the liner material. Similar behavior
was observed with an NaF.UF, mixture, in which
case the liquid was seen to be leaving the com-
partment by way of the thermocouple wires. It is
expected thot wider spacing of the thermocouple
wires and the use of taller containers will help
to minimize and possibly eliminate the creep
probfem.

THE SYSTEM LiF-UF
H. A. Friedman R. E. Moore

Recent quenching work with mixtures in the
LiF-UF, systems that contain 20 to 32 mole % UF,
has confirmed the liquidus and solidus relation
ships previously reported.’ It was found, however,
that the compound 4LiF-UF, undergoes very slow
subsolidus decomposition to LiF and 7LiF.6UF,
at about 470°C. A series of samples of a mixture
containing 28 mole % UF, which originally con-
tained no free LiF, was heated overnight ond
quenched from temperatures both above and below
470°C. Just below 470°C, LiF and TLiF.8UF
were found, but, at still lower temperatures,
4LiF.UF, was found in addition to the other two

phases. Complete decomposition was apparently
not achieved at the lower temperatures.

Thermal analysis studies showed that liquids
containing 20 to 32 mole % UF, undercool readily
if the melt is first heated to over 800°C. Two
undercooling halts occur in the cooling curves ot
about 460 to 480°C, and the resulting mixtures
contain 4LiF.UF,, LiF, and 7LiF-6UF,. If the
liquid is first heated only to 600°C, the under-
cooling effect is absent, and a eutectic type of
halt is obtained at about 490°C. The solidified
mixtures from this type of experiment contain only
LiF and 7LiF-6UF,, which are the phases to be
expected if 4LiF.UF, decomposes during the
cooling; in this event the cooling curve should
indicate ao thermal effect at 470°C, as well as
the eutectic halt at about 490°C. Because of
the absence of the 470°C effect and the sluggish
nature of the decomposition of 4Lif.UF,, it did
aot seem to be likely that the absence of 4LiF-UF
could be explained by its decomposition. These
mixtures therefore had apparently cooled to o
metastable eutectic between LiF and 7LiF.6UF,,
which must freeze only a few degrees below the
freezing point ot 490°C of the stable eutectic
between 4LiF-UF and 7LiF-6UF,.

In view of the existence of the peculiar thermal
effects in the range 20 to 32 mole % UF,, o
seeding experiment on a mixture containing 24
mole % UF, was conducted to be sure that the
quenching results previously obtained truly charac-
terize equilibrium conditions. The mixture was
heated to over 800°C and seeded upon cooling
with small amounts of a mixture of the same
composition that contained oll the phases found
in that region [LiF, 4LiF-UF,, TLiF-6UF,, and
“3LIF-UF,’" (ref 4)). The seed material wos
added at intervals of about 10°C after the mixture
had cooled to about 560°C. The cooling curve
had halts at 485 and 480°C, with no evidence of
undercooling.  Petrographic examination of the
mixture ofter it hod cooled to room temperature
showed that it consisted of 4LiF.UF, TLiF-6UF,,
and a smell amount of LiF. These results are in
accordance with the results of quenching studies,
except that the temperatures of the thermal effects
are about 10°C lower.

it appears that the thermal aaclysis apparatus
in use at that time was not sufficiently sensitive
to detect the small heat effect associated with
the separation of CeF; from the melt. This
difficulty was probably associated with heat con-
duction by the thermocouple well used to protect
the thermocouples. With a Pt—Pt + 10% Rh thermo-
couple immersed directly in the melt, it was
possible to detect thermally the crystallization
of CeF, at the some time the crystals were
observed visually to be forming in the melt. The
diagram shown in Fig. 2.1.1 is a composite of
the thermal analysis dota obtained earlier {solid
circles) and the recent data {open circles). The
melting point of CeF, used in Fig. 2.1.1 (1460°C)
is the literature value.” Examination of several
slowly cooled melts showed only LiF and CeF,
to be present, and this confirmed the thermal
indications of the absence of complex compounds
in this system.

Quenching studies of the NaF-RbF-Bef, system
were started recently. The only temary com-
pound previously reported in the low-BeF, part
of the system was tentatively identified’ as
2NoF-RbF.Bef, on the bosis of petrographic and
x-ray studies of slowly cooled melts.
nations of quenched compositions on the join
NaF-RbF-BeF, indicate that the compound probably
contoins closer to 45 than 50 mole % NaF, but
further study is needed to establish the identity
of this phase conclusively. Previous exominations
of slowly cooled compositions established the join
NaF-RbF.8eF, os a binary system. Quenches of
mixtures on the join containing 33.3 and 40 mole %
NaF have shown that the ternory compound is
the primary phase, that the solidus temperature
is 452°C, and that RbF-Bef, is the other phase
below the solidus. The phase relationships be-
tween the liquidus and solidus are not clear, as
yet, and more work is required in this region.

A lorge number of thermal-gradient quenching
experiments completed during the quorter have
shown the tentative phase-equilibrium diagram

The compound 3NaF.UF, is unstable below
497°C, and it is accordingly impossible for the
primary phose field of LiF to contact that of

The identifying characteristics of some new com-
pounds encountered in phase studies are listed
below. The symbol &(A) denotes the distance
between reflecting planes meosured in ongstroms.
The term I/i, refers to the relative intensity of
the lines as compared with an arbitrary value
of 100 for the strongest line. Under optical
properties, N, and N,, refer to the lowest and
highest indices of refraction, respectively, for
bioxial crystals, and 2V refers to the acute angle
between the optic axes in biaxial crystals; N
and N, refer to the ordinary and extraordinary
indices of refraction of uniaxial crystals.

SUBCONTRACT WORK AT MOUND
LABORATORY AND AT BATTELLE
MEMORIAL INSTITUTE

During the period covered by this report the
Mound Laboratory continued investigations of
beryllium-containing fluoride mixtures of interest
to the ANP program. This work included phose
equilibrium studies of the following systems:
LiF-BeF,-UF,, NoF-BeF,-UF,, LiF-RbF-BeF,.
In addition density and viscosity values were
obtained for various compositions of these mixtures
at 600, 700, and 800°C. This work is reported in
detail in Mound Laboratory memoranda aumbered
57-1-28 ond 57-2-24.

Studies of interest to ANP were also continued
at the Battelle Memorial Institute under subcontract
No. 982. Determinations of the vapor pressure
of three compositions of the RbF-ZrF, system by
the tronspiration method were carried out, and
fabrication and assembly are under way on appa-
ratus for the stafic method of determiniag vapor
pressures. The fronsport of chromium from Inconel
exposed to the NaF-ZrF UF, salt system is being
studied by using Cr®'-lobeled CrF,. Apparatus
is being built for determining the obsorption
spectra of fused mixtures of the fluorides of
sodium, uronivm, ond zirconium. Studies of the
stability of uranium-bearing liquid-metal slurries
are continuing. This work is reported in detail
in report BMI-1171, issued February 20, 1957,

SOLUBILITY OF NIF, IN NoF.ZrF,
C. M. Blood

Considerable attention has been given to
determining the solubility of NiF, in NaF-ZrF,
(53-47 mole %). It was shown previously? that
the solubility of NiF, in this solvent was o
function of the total amount of NiF, odded in the
range 0.5 to 10 wt %, but no determinations were
made with only traces of the saturating (nickel-
containing) phase present. The results obtained
electrochemically’ were of considerable interest
in this regard, but unfortunately these results

2-4

appear to be high by approximately a factor of 2.
Consequently, on accurate determination of the
solubility ot 550°C was undertaken with only
traces of the saturating phase present.

In order to approach the saturation concentration
gradually, a mixture of HF, hydrogen, and helium
was bubbled through NaF-ZrF, contained in nickel
apparatus at 550°C. The apparatus was the same
as that used for equilibrium studies (see preceding
section on "Equilibrium Reduction of NiF, by
H, in NaF-Z(F,"). The HF-H, ratio of the
gaseous mixture was set at appropriate values so
that nickel metal from the container was converted
slowly to NiF,. The changes in NiF, concen-
tration of the molten NaF-Z¢F, were followed by
chemically analyzing liquid semples drown through
filtering tubes. The filtrates were taken in pairs —
one at 550°C and another from the apparatus
temporarily heated to 700°C. For the unsaturated
solution the concentrations of NiF, were identical,
within the analyticol precision, in both filtrates.
As the solution became saturated, the 550°C
filtrate indicated the solubility of Nif,, and the
700°C filtrate gave a measure of the total amount
of NiF, in contact with the liquid. The results
of these measurements are presented in Fig. 2.2.2.

The data obtained for o saturated solution gave
a solubility of 352 + 11 ppm Ni as NiF, in molten
Nof-ZrF, (53-47 male %) at 550°C. The data also
indicate that the solubility remains constant when
the omount of saturating phose is chonged from o
trace to a total of 1310 ppin Ni**. The value of

STABILITY OF CHROMIUM FLUORIDES IN
LiF-ThF, AND LiF-BoF,-ThF, MIXTURES

J. D. Redman

The stability of CrF, and CiFy in two ThF,-
bearing melts at 800°C was examined by application
of the equilibration-filtration technique described
in previous reports in this series.’ (This work,
while of interest to the ANP project, is more
directly applicable to the Fused-Salt Power Re-
actor Project.) These experiments were performed
by charging pure LiF-ThF, (72-28 mole %) or
LiF-BeF ,-ThF ; (67-23-10 mole %) along with pure
CrF, or CrF, to hydrogen-fired nickel apparatus,
equilibrating for 5 hr at 800°C under helium,
filtering ot the equilibrium temperature, and an-
alyzing the cooled filtrate for Cr** and total
chromium ion.

The dota obtained, os given in Table 2.2.2,
indicate that CeF, is stable in both these solvents.
The disproportionation reaction

It appears, however, that CrFy reacts with the

these experiments, presented in Toble 2.2.3, show
that equilibrium is estoblished within 5 hr and
thot the equilibrium concentration of Fe'' is
significantly higher at 600 than ot 800°C. The
concentrations obtained in this reaction medium
fall in the range thet has been found in the other
alkali fluoride~ZrF, binory mixtures. No satis-
factory explanation con be given for the fact thot
the Fe®-UF, system is not morkedly offected when
different alkali fluoride-ZrF, mixtures are used
os the reoction medium. In contrast the studies
of the Cr®-UF, reaction showed thot the chromium
concentration increases in the order of use of
RbF, KF, NaF, or LiF, in the reaction medium,
which is the order of decreasing ion size.

Data for the reaction of UF, with Cr at 600
and 800°C when RbF-ZrF, (52-48 mole %) is used
as the reaction medivm are given in Table 2.2.4.
Approximately 2 g of Cr® wos reacted with UF,
(89 wt % UF, 4.0 mole % UF) dissolved in
opproximately 40 g of the RbF-ZrF, mixture ina
nickel container.

The chromium values given in Table 2.2.4 show
that the UF,-Cr® reaction has a very small tem-
perature coefficient over the temperature range
studied. These equilibrium chromium concentrations
are slightly higher than those found® in RbF-ZrF
(60-40 mole %) aot both temperatures. The small
differences indicate that the fluoride ion activity,
as measured by the Cro-UF, reaction, increases
only slightly when the RbF concentration is in-
creased from 50 to 58 mole %, the RbF con-
centrations of the ternary mixtures containing
4 mole % UF.

It has been determined that the addition of BaF,
or StF; to a melt containing CeF, dissolved in
NoF-ZrF,-UF , (50-46-4 mole %) reduces the solu-
bility of the CeF 5. In one experiment approximately
7 wt % Ce os labeled CeF; was equilibrated with
NoF-ZrF -UF, ot 900°C, and then filtrates were
obtained at approximately 800, 700, 600, and
550°C, os described above. After these filtrates
were obtained, about 1.0 wt % Bo was odded as
8aF, and equilibrated at 900°C, and another set
of four filtrates wos taken, More Bof, was then
added to bring the barium content to 7 wt %, ond

the procedure was repeated. The activities of the
filtrotes were then counted to determine the cerium
concentration.

A similar experiment was performed in which
StF, was added to the extent of 4.6 wt % Sr too
previously equilibrated CeF y-NaF-ZrF ,-UF , mixture
containing 6 wt % Ce. Filtrates were obtained
by using the procedure described for the BoF,
additions, and the octivities were counted to
determine the cerium concentration. The results
of these experiments are given in Tables 2.2.12

SOLUBILITY OF XENON GAS IN NaF-ZrF ;-UF,
N. V. Smith

The determination of the solubility of xenon
gas in molten NaF-ZeF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %) as
a function of pressure and temperature was suce
cessfully completed. As a consequence of the
high cost of xenon, a recovery system for the xenon
used in the determination was added to the apparatus
previously described? for the determination of the
solubility of helium in NaF-ZtF,-UF,. In this gas-
dispensing and recovery system three xenon cylin-
ders were connected through their conventional
pressure-regulating valves to a manifold which served
to introduce the gas at the desired pressure into
the solubility equipment. Between each cylinder and

its pressure regulator an odditional connection,
which could be closed with a needle valve, was
made to a second manifold which received the
xenon gas emerging from she solubility apparatus.
With the use of a liquid-nitrogen cooling bath the
xenon could be recovered in one of the cylinders
while the experiment was fed from a second
cylinder.
a standby in cose the source cylinder became
depleted during an experiment. This assembly is
shown as Figs. 2.2.6 and 2.2.7.

The xenon was obtained in cylinders from Linde
Air Products Co. Mass spectrometic analysis
showed its purity to be better than 99.99%, as
received. The high purity gradually decreased to
95.9% after eight complete experiments.

The limited supply of xenon ovailable necessitated
a constant wotch during the experiment in order
to avoid exhausting the source cylinder below
a sofe preset pressure. Accordingly, the saturating
time wos lowered to approximately 5 hr. The
results appeared to correlate satisfactorily re-
gardless of whether the time was 4 or 5 hr. In a
single experiment in which the saturation was
attempted in 1 hr, the amovat of xenon found in
solution was only about one-half as much as that
obtained with 4- or 5-hr saturation times. From
the previous experience with helium, it appeared
that 3 br of saturation time was sufficient.

The results shown in Table 2.2.17 and Fig.
2.2.8 appear to be consistent to within approxi-

The third cylinder wos maintained as

mately £10%. All the experimental variables
appear to have been controlled to within con-
siderably closer vuriations than 10%. The mass
spectrometer analyses agree, on an average, with
the synthetic compositions of the stondard gas
mixtures to within approximately 10%. As o
consequence, it does not appear unreasonable to
assume thot the resulss presented are correct to
within £20%, if it is assumed that the saturating
Appropriate
experiments are under way to demonstrate gquan-
titatively the time required for saturation.

It may be seen that, as in the case of helium,
the solubility of xenon in NaF-ZiF,-UF, (50-46-

This effect is discussed in more detail in the

SOLUBILITY OF HE IN NaF-Z/rF,

Knowledge of the solubility of HF in molten
fluoride mixtures would be valuable in studies

of methods of salt purification, some aspects of cor-
rosion problems, and processes for dissolution of

solvents,

solid fuel elements for uranium recovery. No record
of direct measurement of the solubility of HF in
molten fluorides has been found. As a byproduct
of studies of salt purification, attempts'® have
been made ot times during the post severol yeors
to estimate the solubility of HF in molten salts
from rotes of stripping of the HE by inert gas
carriers. The results obtained have not, however,
been conclusive.

In recent months it has been possible to measure,
by a direct equilibration method, the solubility of
RF in on NoF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) melt at 600°C.
When data are available at other temperatures,
comparisons of these values with those estimated
from measurements of stripping rates will be
discussed.

The direct equilibration procedure consists, in
brief, of soturating the melt with HF at constant

M. Blander

An attempt has been mode to correlate the be-

affinity has, however, largely obscured the effects
of repulsion of like charges in the melt, which
ore probably more important shan cation-apion

To the extent that emphasis on cation-

complex ions in all fluoride melts, the concept is
misleading.

A mixture of salts with slightly different Z/R
(charge-to-ion radius) ratios, in which no structural
change from that of the molten components results,
will be energetically more stable than the unmixed
salts, although the anion-cation attractive forces
are not altered by the mixing. An example of this
is shown in Fig. 2.3.1. Configuration A for the
mixture is more stable than the average of config-
urations B and C, which represent the pure com-
ponents, in that the larger the difference in 1/r for
Li* and K* or in Z/r at equal r for the two cations,
the more negative becomes the energy of mixing,
AE {mixing}. If the Z/R ratios of the two salts
differ only slightly, the siructure of the mixture
will differ only slightly from the structures of
the components, and the extra stobility of the
mixture will be small.

It the Z/R rotios differ considerably ond es-
pecially if the salts are of widely different valence
states, the extra stability of the mixture will be
lorge, and the structure will be considerably dis-
torted in comparison with the structures of the
component salts, that is, the larger the difference
in Z/R ratios, the more stable the mixture relative
to its components. For components which mix
without o change in coordinotion number and with
little distortion, the negative deviation from ideal
solution behavior is occounted for, in the main,
by a decrease in cation repulsive energy upon
mixing.

SOME ASPECTS OF SOLUTION BEHAVIOR
OF FLUORIDE MELTS
R. F. Newton F. F. Blankenship

The polarizability of ions, which can be inter-
preted in terms of partially covalent bonds between
ions, is a factor in the solution behavior of molten
fluoride melts that is usually secondary but which
moy be important in many molten electrolytes.
Fortunately, the fluoride melts of interest os
reactor fuels represent a rather extreme case in
which the effects of polarization of the ions appear
to be of little consequence.

Foremost among the factors controlling the
solution behavior of molten electrolytes is the
effect of ion charge ond size on the coulombic
force between neighboring ions.  Progressively

between next necrest neighbars, and so on, uatil
the effect becomes negligible with distance. This
electrostatic behovior has long been recognized
as a controlling factor in the lattice energy of
ionic crystals.

All the molten fluorides which have been con-
sidered as possible fuels in the large deve lcpment
program contain cationic components of widely
different valence state (U**, Zr", Be”, No¥)
which may be expected, from any standpoint, to
show large negative deviations from ideal solution
behavior and large distortions from the structures
of the pure molten components.

of these complex liquid systems in terms of the

In order to predict the behavior of solutes in
binary solvents it is necessary to know the effective
2/R for the binary solvent. Presumably the
effective Z/R for the solvent (as for ony mixture)
varies with composition between the values for
the pure components; however, the precise shape
of the curve (or surface) for Z/R vs composition
is not readily ascertained. If the Z/R ratio for a
simple solute is identical with the effective Z2/R
ratio for the complex solvent, the solution com-
position at this point can be termed the neutral
composition. The activity coefficient of the salute
is ot a maximum at the neutral composition, and
the further the composition of the solvent from
this composition the smaller will be the activity
coefficient of the solute. This principle provides
a basis for evoluotion of effective Z/R rotios for
the NaF-ZrF, system, for example, as a function
of composition.

Mixtures of NaF (Z/R = 0.43) and ZrF, (Z/R

negative deviations from ideality, and the vapor
pressure of ZrF , from such a mixture is much less
than would be expected. The addition of UF,
(Z/R = 1.68) to such a melt serves to increase
the averoge Z/R for the mixture and thus to lower
the activity coefficient of NoF and to raise the

There were some difficulties in calibration of the
pycnometer which prevent this value from being
regorded os final. It leads to a surface tension
of UF, of about 180 dynes compared with the
value of about 140 dynes found from the pre-
timinory estimates given in the previous report. 0
Further experiments are currently being made in
order to obtain a firm value for the density.

The tentative experimental value given ohove
for the density of liquid UF, is, surprisingly,
greater thon the density of solid UF; (6.63 g/cm”

PREPARATION OF VARIOUS PURE FLUORIDES
B. J. Sturm L. G. Overholser

Preparation of YF,

The continuing interest in moderators for use of
high temperotures encouraged considerable study
of the hydride of yttrium. Since the hydride is
prepared from metallic yttrium, which is made by
reduction of YF, it has been necessary to prepare
considerable quantities of YF for evaluation in
the metal manufacturing step.

The method of preparation used to date has been
to dissolve Y,0, in the minimum quantity of
aqueous HC! solution and to precipitate the
fluoride by the addition of aqueous HF solution.
The solid product is washed by decantation,
recovered by centrifugation, and given a pre-
liminary drying at 150°C in air.

The crystalline product is dried for 4 to 6 hr
at 250°C under flowing helium in nickel) equipment
and then treated, in this equipment, with anhydrous
HF at 700 to 750°C for 12 hr. About 1400 g of
YF, has been prepared in this fashion.

Preparation of Fluorides of Molybdenum

A previous report in this series! described the
preparation of what appeared to be a lower fluoride
of molybdenum by reduction of MoF with FeF,.
In additional experiments this reduction product
has been collected in a condenser maintained at
110°C and subsequently redistilled in glass appa-
ratus. The yellow product, which is very unstable
toward traces of moisture, melts ot 78°C. This
is considerably higher than the 60°C previously
reported! as the melting point of the material
before distillation.

The unstability of the material to air and moisture
makes it difficult to obtain a clear x-ray pattern,
The best data available to date indicate the solid

material.

Preparation of Other Materials

The method of preparation of FeF, from
FeCl,-4H,0 has been improved considerably by
partial dehydration of the commercial materia
before the hydroflucrination step. The substitution
of anhydrous CrCl, for hydrated CrF, as the row
material for CrF, preparation results in a pure
product; this improvement is entirely due to the
higher purity of the commercial chloride.

Hydrofluorination of CrCl, at 700°C yields a
product containing a smalt quantity of Crf,. Most
of this contominant can be removed by treatment
with H, ot 700°C. When this reduction is per-
formed in silver vessels, fess Cr’ contaminates
the product than when nicke! vessels are used.

totaling 1575 Ib of the various fluoride compo-
sitions needed in phase equilibrium studies,
physical property measurement, small-scale cor-
rosion tests, and other experiments. A large
fraction of this material was NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
{11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %). Usage of this material
seems to be fairly constant at about 500 Tb per

for the 50-Ib batches. No failures have occurred
in the ten tests made to date; it is not certain,

exposure of the molten salt mixture fo air or water
occurs in Inconel cans, extensive contamination
of the melt with Crf, ond FeF, results, Since

This acceleroted program was adopted of the
request of the AEC to meet the estimated re-
quirements for processed fluorides to be used in
the ANP program by Pratt & Whitney Aircraft and
by ORNL. During the last month of this quarter,
however, the Prot & Whitney requirements were
greatly reduced. The projected total requirements
for the last half of fiscal year 1957 dropped from
37,000 to approximately 12,000 [b. Because of
the firm commitments made for the large amounts
of row materiots, the personnel, ond the operating
aceded for the highly accelerated
program initiated in November 1956 and becouse
of the economies achieved by continuous operation,
it was deemed adviseble to maintain the high
production rate until the end of this fiscal year.
However, the main objective has changed from
to stockpiling
sufficient quantities of processed fluorides for
maintaining the ORNL effort in the ANP program
in fiscal year 1958. If this objective is ottained,
the production facility will not be operated during

commercial APC graphite specimens
complished by immersing them for 24 hr in the
fluoride mixture melt kept at 800°C. After this
treatment, the impregnated specimen was heated
in vacuum for 24 hr at 500°C in order to remove
part of the ZrF, and thus to obtain a residual
mixture with o higher melting temperature. It
would be expected that on impregnating material
that was solid when exposed to the uronium-

cessfully than one thot was liquid and could thus
diffuse from the pores. Both the treated specimen
and a control sample that had not been heated in

The olpha counts obtained from these specimens
were compared with the counts obtained with
specimens immersed directly into the uranium
bearing mixture without preliminary impregnation.
The data obtained are presented in Table 2.6.2.
The results indicate that the graphite specimens
were not penetrated to any considerable degree by
either of the salt mixtures, ond thus these speci-

eliminate the mass-transfer effects observed in
sodium hydroxide circulated under a temperature
gradient.

The experimental orrangement being used con-
sists of three closed concentric nickel crucibles,
which serve as electrodes, as shown in Fig. 2.6.1.
The outer vessel is 6 in. long ond 2% in. in
diameter. The middle container is 1% in. in di-
ameter and 8 in. long, and a small hole was drifled
in the bottom to aflow the molten sodium hydroxide
to rise to the same level as in the outer container.
The inner electrode consists of a -in.-dia nickel
tube, The bottom of the tube was closed ond o
thermocouple was welded inside. For tests, the
three electrodes were placed concentrically in
the furnace in a controlled atmosphere. About
150 g of sodium hydroxide was used as the charge.
in this orrangement the outer electrode had hy-
drogen gas on side and molten sodium
hydroxide on the other side. The middle electrode
had molten sodium hydroxide on both sides. The
effect of voricus arrangements could be studied
by connecting the electrodes to the positive or
negotive poles of batteries.

In one experiment a relatively low test temper
ature (550°C) was used; the middle electrode was

one

134

connected to the negative pole; and the inner
electrode was connected to the positive pole of
the outside battery. Current and voltage measure-
ments were made by slowly raising the applied
voltage and measuring the corresponding current.
Two sets of measurements were made with the
system under o hydrogen ofmosphere and also with
the system under vacuum.

The results, plotted in Fig. 2.6.2, show that
under a hydrogen atmosphere the current increased
much foster than it did under vacuum, which
indicates that hydrogen participated in the current
carrying mechanism.

Measurements were ofso made at 800°C, with o
hydrogen atmosphere, for which the current flowed
either from the inner electrode to the outer elec-
trode or in the reverse direction, It may be seen
in Fig. 2.6.3 thot, when the current was flowing
from the inner electrode toward the middle elec-
trode, the current increased continuously with the
voltage. In the reverse case o definite ploteau
was reached, that is, os the voltage was increased,
the current remained constant up to a value some-
what below 2 v. A theoretical interpretation of
these results will require a more systematic study
of the effect of current density, The polarization
of hydrogen electrodes is probably involved.

In the tests which were carried out, a 5-in.-1D sube
furnace was placed between the two optical com-
ponents of the instrument. Absorption cells, con-
structed of 24-in. lengths of ¥-in.dia Inconel
tubing ond fitted with end windows of optical
quartz, were placed in the furnace so that each
light beam traversed an obsorption cell. After the
furnace wos heated, the optical components were
aligned and the instyument was balanced by rotating
the apertures until a minimum signal wos observed
on the output meter of the amplifier, A sample of
sodium-containing air, prepared by
admitting meosured quontities of helium thot had
been saturated with sodium vapor to a stream of air,
was introduced into one of the absorption tubes, and
the deflection of the output meter wos observed.

When o somple calculated to contain 250 ppb of
sodium was introduced into the absorption tube,
the observed signal produced a deflection equal to
twice that of the original balance of the meter. On
the basis ofthe observed stability of the instrument,
it was found that 100 ppb of sodium could be easily
detected. As was reported, ? however, the technique

which wos

used for the preparation of somples of sodivm-
containing air did not yield quantitative iransfer of
sodium to the air, and thus these preliminary
measutements may not truly reflect the sensitivity
of this instrument. It was found that no evidence of
sodium could be observed when the effluent gases
containing the sodium from the absorption tube were
passed through an air-propane flame, It appears
that the stipulated limit of detection of 10 ppb of
sodium can be achieved by appropriate sampling
techniques and refinements in the alignment of the
instrument.

Tests were carried out for selecting a suitable
material to use in the fabrication of orifices with
which to inject small quantities of NaK into air.
Zirconium was the only satisfactory material found
among the materials tested. A 0.003-in. orifice in
crystal-bar zirconium was enlarged less than 20% by
the ejection of NaK for a period of 30 min at o
temperature of 450°C. Under these conditions

A method is being tested for the determination of
traces of oxygen in metallic lithium that is based
on the following reactions

and the subsequent measurement of the water by the
Karl Fischer titration. The procedure, which was
developed by Nuclear Development Corporation of
America® offers o unique advantage in that the
sample can be washed free of surface contamination
immediately before the determination is performed.

The determination is carried out in the apparatus
shown in Fig. 2.7.2. A sample (~ g) is placed in
the reaction vessel, and the apparatus is freed of
oxygen by evacuation and purging with helium.
Surface oxide is removed by transferring three 20-ml
portions of dried methanol from the titration flask to
the reaction vessel ond allowing each portion to
react for 1 min of room temperature. After she final
wash solution has been withdrawn, a 60-ml volume
of methanol is tronsferred from the titration flask
to the reaction vessel, and the sample is dissolved
by gentle heating. A 20-ml portion of a 50% solution
of salicylic acidin pyridine that has been pretitrated
to the Karl Fischer end point is admitted to the
titration flask, ond, when the dissolution is com-
pleted in the reaction vessel, the sofution of lithium
methylate ond water is tronsferred to the titration
flask. The solution in the titration flask is then
retitrated to the Kor] Fischer end point. The
titration is corrected by substracting the volume of
Karl Fischer reagent thot is required to titrate a

60-ml portion of methanol.

titanium in the presence of niobium and molybdenum.
Since niobium and molybdenum interfere with the
determination of titanium by the Tiron method, '® it

is then determined by the methyiene blue procedure,
The coefficient of variation of the method was found

A standard solution of potassium dichromate was
used in order to establish a calibration curve for
the chromium determination by the diphenylcarbazide
method. The chromium in a portion of the standard
solution was reduced with hydrogen peroxide to
yield o standard solution of chsomium{lll). The
calibration curve obtained from the solution of
chromium(lll) after oxidation of the chromium with
argentic oxide was identical, within experimental

SOLVENT EXTRACTION OF MOLYBDENUM FROM
ACIDIC SOLUTIONS WITH
TRI-n-OCTYLPHOSPHINE OXIDE

W. J. Ross

Previous success '8in the isolation, concentration,

and determination of elements encountered in ART
fuels, corrosion products, and fission products
through solvent extraction of these elements with
tri-n-octylphosphine oxide (TOPO) has led to o
continued study of the analytical applications of
this reagent, It wos found that hexavalent molybde-
num is amenable to separation from acidic solutions
by extraction with trimn-octylphosphine oxide. A
systematic study of the variables involved in the
extraction showed that hexavalent molybdenum
can be concentrated greater than a hundredfold by
a single extroction with 0.3 M TOPO in cyclohexane
from HCI and that as much as 20 mg of Mo®* con be
quantitatively extracted by 0.5 mmole of this reagent.
Less efficient extractions are obtained from H,S0,,
HNOg, or HCIO, systems. The extent of the ex-
troction is highly dependent on the acid concen-
tration of the aqueous phase, and therefore under

YAPOR-PHASE POLYMERS IN
ALKALI-HALIDE SALTS

L. 0. Gilpatrick

Aknowledge of the composition of the vapor phase
of the fused-salt fuel mixture is important to the
investigation of the vapor-deposition problem in
circulating-fuel reactors. It is also indispensable
for the measurement of activities of components of
salt when vopor-pressure methods of
measurement ore used. Therefore a study of the
vapor phase of alkali-halide salts was initiated.
It has been reported??=22 that the equilibrium
vapor phase of many simple materials, such as
copper chloride, carbon, and potassium chloride,
contain simple polymeric species that are most
frequently dimers and trimers. When the olkali-
halide salts ore heated in on effusion cell, it is
possible to meosure the change in the vapor com-
position as o function of cell temperature. The
mass spectrometer is well suited for application

mixtures

to this problem, since with it the species which are
derived from polymers in the vapor can be measured
independently. Only relative values can be measured
with the use of this technique; however, energies or

The
mass spectrometer is also o sensitive tool for the
qualitative examination of the vapor phase of halide
salts and other materials.

A satisfactory effusion cell wos developed, and
potassium chloride is currently being examined at
temperatures from 550 to 750°C. Preliminary values
for the energy of vaporization of KCI monomer and
dimer were found to be 49.3 and 58.3 kcal/mole,
respectively. No higher polymers were detected.
The next salts to be examined will be the alkali

FORCED-CIRCULATION LOOP TESTS
J. H. DeVan R. S. Crouse

Fuel Mixtures in Inconel and in Hastelloy B

Three forced-cicculation loops fabricated of
Hostelloy B were examined that had circulated
NaF.KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41-453-2.5 mole %, fuel
107) at a maximum fluid temperature of about
1650°F, The loops were heated by direct elec-
trical resistance and were constructed from kein,-
OD, 0.060-in.-wall tubing. The operating con-
ditions for these three loops are given in Table
Ll.

Two of the loops completed 1000 hr of operation,
although interruptions that required temporary
shutdowns occurred during both tests. Loop
7641-18 developed o leak while fuel was being
admitted to the loop for a test run. The loop was
successfully repaired, and it then operated for
the scheduled 1000-hr period without further diffi
culties. Loop 7641-2B developed a leak after
66 hr of operation and was likewise repaired and
operated for the remainder of the scheduled 1000-hr
period. Operation of the third loop, 7641-3, was
terminated by a pump failure after 407 hr of opera-
tion,

The hot legs of all three loops were found to be
badly pitted after the tests, with the pits in the
most heavily attacked areas reaching to a depth

received Hastelloy B tubing were rough, as shown
by the sample in Fig, 3.1.1, and thus a large part
of the pitting was probably present before the
test. The cold-leg sections of loops 7641-1B and
7641-3 were entirely free of metal deposits, but
they had deeper surface imperfections than those
found in the hot-leg sections, In some areas of
the cold legs the pits reached a depth of 7 mils;
however, os may be seen in Fig. 3.1.2, which
shows a cold-leg section of toop 7641.1B, the
surface imperfections appear to be the result of
corrosion deepening of the pits present before the
test,

The examination of loop 7641-2B likewise re-
veoled deeper pits in the cold leg than in the hot
leg. In contrast to the other two foops, joop
7641.2B, however, was found to have o few small
metal crystals in the cold leg. These crystalline
deposits occurred in clumps, approximately 2 mils
thick, that were confined to a short section of the
loop near the cold-leg outlet, As shown in Fig.
3.1.3 the crystals were completely detached from
the Joop wall. The quontity of deposited material
was insufficient for o chemical analysis, and it
is not known whether the crystals resulted from
groins becoming detached from the extremely rough
as-received surfaces or from a mass-tronsfer
mechanism, Loop 7641-2B operated with the
lowest Reynolds number used in the three tests,

of 4 mils. Unfortunately, the surfaces of the as- and if is doubtful that mass transfer would take

loop (7425.25) that operated 500 hr with fuel mix-
ture No, 30 olso revealed hot-leg attack to a depth
of 5 mils, but no cold-leg deposits were found.

A third Inconel forced-circulation loop was
operated with fuel mixture 70, NaF-ZrF,.UF,
(56-39-5 mole %). The results of two other forced-
circulation loop tests which compared the corrosion
properties of this fuel mixture with those of the
more commonly used mixture 30, NaF-ZrF UF,
(50-46-4 mole %), were reported previously, In
this latest test in the series the {oop operated with
o maximum fuel temperature of approximately
1500°F and a maximum wall temperature of about
1600°F, Other operating conditions for this loop,
7425.26, are given in Table 3.13. Although
scheduled for 1000 hr, operation was terminated
after only 716 hr because of a pump pulley foilure.
Void formation during operation progressed fo a
depth of 5 mils. A thin metallic layer was noted
in the cold leg that wos similar to the layers found
in the Inconel loops operated previously with this
fuel mixture. The layer wos too thin to provide
sufficient material for chemical

The attack to a depth of 5 mils in this loop is
similar to the 7 mils of attack in each of the two
loops operated previously with fuel 70 for 1000 hr.
One of these latter loops operated under tempero-
ture conditions identical fo those for loop 7425-26,
while the other loop operated with a maximum fluid
temperature of about 16509F. The depths and type
of attack in these loops are similar to the results
obtained for loops that circulated fuel 30 under

loop was 1500°F ond the temperature drop across
the cold-leg section was 300°F. All the loops
were operated for 1000 hr.

An investigation of the design of the cotd trap
used in these loops was made prior fo beginning
these studies to determine the effectiveness of
such a trap in controlling the oxide level. In a
special test loop containing a bypass cold trap
and a device known as a “plugging meter,’ NaK
was circulated isothermally ot 1500°F, and meas-
urements were made of the oxide concentration of
the NaK under vorious conditions of cold-trap
temperatures and flow rates, The plugging meter
was used to indicate the soturation temperature of
sodium oxide in the NaK under each of the cold-
trap operoting conditions, The saturation tempera-
ture, together with published information on the
solubility limits of sodium oxide in NaK os a
function of temperature, was used to establish
the oxide concentration, These tests demonstrated
that the cold-trap operating temperature in the
range from 100 to 1200°F accurately reflected the
oxide concentration; that is, the oxide concentra-
tion which existed in the NaK corresponded to the
limit of solubility for sodium oxide in NaK at the
cold-trap temperature.

were more easily seporated from the loop walls.
The weights of the deposits in these loops show
thot a noticeable increase in the quantity of ma-
terial deposited was brought about by an increase
in the cold-trap temperature from 600 to 00°F,
This increase is also reflected in the deposit
thickness. A smaller difference in deposit thick-
ness is apparent in comparing the results for the
test with a cold-trap temperature of 600°F with
those for the two tests with lower cold-trap tem-
peratures,  Metallographic examinations of cold-
leg sections from these loops also indicate that
the change in the amount of deposited material
accompanying a decrease in cold-trap temperature
below 600°F is less than the chonge from 800 to
sooo

As mentioned above, the size of the particles
comprising the deposits is apparently affected by
the cold-trap temperature and the oxide concentra-
tion. Deposits taken from similor sections of the
toops operated with cold-trap temperatures of 100
and 800°F are compared in Figs, 3.1.6 and 3.1.7.
As con be seen, the average particle size of the
crystals found in the loop which included o cold
trap operated at 800°F was considerably larger
than that of the crystals from the loop aperated
with a cold-trap temperature of 100°F, The compo-
sitions of the deposits did not vary with cold-trap
temperature; in ali the loops, the deposits were
found to contain approximately 90% Ni and 10% Cr.

The results of these studies of the effect of
oxides in Inconel-NaK systems show trends quite
similar to those found in the resutts of tests of

Inconel-sodium systems. The tests of Inconel-

sodium systems, which were discussed previously’
were carried out by making oxide additions directly
to the sodium. The effects on mass transfer were
small for oxide additions of 0.05 wt % and less but
became significont at higher concentrations. Addi-
tionot data (not presented previously) showed that
the deposit particle size also increosed as the
oxide level increased.

A difference in the quantity of mass-tronsferred

recently tested NaK-Inconel systems are somewhat
Jess than one-half the weights of deposits found
in sodium-inconel systems tested under similar
temperature conditions. The thicknesses of the
deposits found in both systems ore comparable,
although as discussed in conjunction with the first

The composition ond manner of deposition of the
crystals in the two systems appear to be identical,
The average size of the crystals comprising the

appears that the same mechanism for mass transfer
exists in both systems but that the process pro-
in NaK-lnconel systems than in

Sodium in Inconel and in Stainless Steel

Two Inconel forced-circulation loops of a design
similar to that shown in Fig. 3.1.4 were operated
with sodium at different velocities to evaluate
the effect of flow rate on mass transfer. The
sodium temperatures ranged from a maximum of
1500°F in the hot leg to a minimum of 1200°F in
the cold leg. The pumps were operated at different
power levels to establish sodium flow rates of
1.5 and 3.0 gpm, respectively,
tained bypass cold traps fo maintain low oxide
levels.

Examinations of the loops following 1000 hr of
operation revealed a substantial difference in the
of deposited material recovered from
the cold legs. In the loop operated with a sodium

flow rate of 1.5 gpm (loop 7426-22), the deposit
weighed 10.4 g. A doubled flow rate of 3.0 gpm
(loop 7426-23) resulted in an increase in the weight
of the deposit to 14.0 g. Hot-leg attack in both
toops was in the form of intergranular penetration
and reached maximum depths of 2 mils in each
The average thickness of the deposit also
varied with the flow rate, The thickness at the
lower flow rate was 12 mils, while at the higher
flow rate the thickness increased to 22 mils.

Several other sodium loops have been operated
at flow rates of 2.5 gpm, and the results con be
compared with the results of tests described above.
White the mojority of the loops operated with
sodium flow rote of 2.5 gpm, each loop test in-
corporated some variable which introduced a sight
difference from the conditions described above.
An average value of deposit weight for the tests
which most closely simulated the conditions given
above is 13 g. A plot of the data given above and
the 13-g volue is presented in Fig. 3.1.8 to show
the effect of flow rate,

A type 304 stainless steel forced-circulation
loop completed 1000 hr of operation with sodium at
a maximum temperature of 1500°F and a tempera-
ture drop of 300°F. The loop contained an oxide

examination of this loop revealed only slight traces

1500°F. Fluid flow was moinsained at 1,28 gpm.
After 2480 hr of operation, a leak developed in the
heater coil of the loop, and the NaK had to be
dumped. The heater coil was replaced, and the
loop wos again put into operation. After an addi-
tional 280 hr, operation was terminated when a
similar leok developed in the new heater coil,

Metallographic examination of the hot leg which
was removed from the Joop after 2480 hr revealed
light-to-heavy intergranular attack te a depth of
1.5 mils. A needlelike deposit, 7 mils in depth,
was also observed in the section just beyond the
heater coil where the loop first experienced a
thermal gradient. The cooled coil, which was in
operation an additional 280 hr, showed only tight-
to-moderate pits, along with intergranular attack to
a depth of 1 mil. Metal deposits reached a maxi-
mum thickness of 14 mils in the section at the
entrance to the cooled coil.

A similar loop was operated with sodium as the
circulated fluid. Operation of this loop (7426-51)
wos terminated after 4000 hr, when a leak developed
near the pump. The operating conditions, with the
exception of the temperature gradient, were similar
to those for loop 7439-51, Because of the better
heat transfer properties of sodium, a thermal
gradient of 800°F was achieved, Sodium attack in
the hot-leg section of the loop reached a maximum
depth of 5 mils. A heavy deposit of metal crystals
that reached a maximum thickness of 50 mils was
found in the section at the entrance fo the cooling
coil. The deposit is shown in Fig. 3.1.11.

Carbide precipitates were found at the surfaces
of the inner walls of the tubing which had been
exposed to sodium and, to a lesser extent that
varied with depth, in the wall of the tubing. The
diffusion of carbon therefore appears to have pro-
ceeded from the inner wall of the tubing into the
tubing, ond thus the source of the carbon must have
been the sodium. This Joop contained a mechanical
pump, and a slight leak through the pump seal of
the oil for lubricating the pump could have been
responsible for the carburization found,

The loops for these long-duration tests were of
a unique design, and therefore the cesults cannot
be compored directly with the results of other
tests of shorter duration. The extensive deposits
observed in the loop which circulated sodium indi-
cate that mass transfer proceeds at a rate which
is not significantly diminished with time, although,
based on the carburization observed in this loop,

Fuel 107, — Corrosion tests of the experimental
nickel-molybdenum alloys exposed to sodium and
to Na F-KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41-45,3-2.5 mole %, fuel

The compositions of the alloys tested, the test
conditions, and the results of metallographic ex-
aminations of as-lested specimens are given in
Table 3.1.5.

The data show that a maximum hot-leg attack of
3 mils occurred in loops 1105 (16% Mo-2% Al—
1.5% Ti-bal Ni) and 1108 (17% Mo—2% Al-bal Ni).
These results are in good agreement with the data

shown in Table 3.1.6.

Loop 1093 (17% Mo-7% Cr~bal Ni} showed hot-
leg attack which was somewhot higher than that
found previously in loops fabricated from material
containing comparable amounts of chromium.® Also
the attack changed from the moderate general sub-
surface-void formation in the loops operated pre-
viously to heavy general subsurface-void formation.
Loop 1094 (20% Mo-7% Cr-2% Nb-1% Fe~bal Ni)

The addition of niobium and iron thus appecrs to
have little effect on the corrosion of a nickel-

of 2 mils in this loop (1101) is comparable to the
attacks in the above loops containing 7 wt %
chromium, However, the chromium content in the
fuel after test was noticeably lower in the case of
loop 1101 (5 wt % chromium) than in the oops
with 7 wt % chromium,

Additions of 2 to 4 wt % tungsten to the nickel-
molybdenum alloy did not affect the depth of attack.
The hot-feg attack to a depth of 1.5 mils found in
loop 1113 (17% Mo-2% W-bal Ni) is shown in
Fig. 3.1.14. As may be seen the attack was pre-
dominantly intergranular, which is uncommon for
nickel-molybdenum alloys exposed to fuei 107.
Another loop fabricated of material from the same
heat alse showed intergranulor ottack after opero-
tion with sedium, The attack by fuel 107 in loop
120 (17% Mo—4% Webal Ni), fabricated from a
different heat containing 4 wt % tungsten, was of
the usual general subsurface-void-formation type
and there were surface pits to a depth of 1 mil,
The differences in the attack of the alloys con-
taining 2 and 4 wt % tungsten moy result from
differences in the groin-boundary constituents of
the two olloys. The chemical analyses of the fuel
mixtures circulated in the two loops show sizable
amounts of tungsten, as high as 1465 ppm,

Sodium, — Data on the nickel-molybdenum atloy
loops operated with sodium are presented in Table
3.1.5. Mass-transter deposits were visible in
nickel-molybdenum alloy loops 1023 (11% Mo~2%
Al=bal Ni), 1088 {20% Mo—1% Nb=2% Ti-0.8% Mn—
bal Ni), 1089 (15% Mo-3% Nb-0.5% Al-3% W-bol

and 1117 (17% Mo—2% W-bal Ni}, which operated
for 1000 hr with sedium at a maximum temperature
of 1500°F; however, deposits were found metallo-
graphically only in loop 1102. These deposits
differed from deposits in Inconel-sodium systems
in that they did not adhere tightly to the loop wall,
Consequently, the deposits could be mechanically
removed, and thus they were lost during preparation
of metallographic samples, The quantity of de-
posited materiol visible in these joops was com-
parable to the quantities found in Inconel locos
operated with sodium under similar conditions.
Chemical analyses of the deposited material found
in loop 1102 showed 650 ppm Mo, 3400 ppm Al,
94% Ni, and 3.57% Cr.

The moximum hot-leg attack in atl these loops
averaged slightly more than 1 mil. The attack
appeared as subsurface voids and pits, and thus
was similor to that found in the hot legs of loops
thot circulated fuel 107, With the exception of the

Void Migration in Incanel Exposed
to NaF-ZeF UF,

Three standard Inconel thermai-convection foops
were operated with NaF-ZsF ,-UF , (50-46-4 mole %,
fuel 30) at o bulk fluid temperature of 1500°F,
One foop (1085) was terminated ofter 277 hr of
operation; the fuel in the second loop (1086) was
replaced with helium after 280 hr, and the loop
was held at test temperature for the remaining
scheduled operating period of 1000 hr; the third
loop (1010), included as a control loop, operated
the scheduled 1000 he with fuel.

An analysis of the corrosion process in Inconel
systems containing fluorides indicates that the
rate of attack (that is, void formation) becomes
constant when the test period exceeds 250 hr.
This linear relationship of attack with time is
reached foflowing on initial period of rapid attack
resulting from the equilibration of the fluorides
with Inconel. It was first assumed that the linear
migration of voids into Inconel with time repre-
sented a constant rate of chromium removal with
time. However, questions were posed as to whether
even in the absence of further chromium removal
some void formation might continue as a result of
the rapid stage of attack represented by the equili-
bration of fluorides. The purpose of these fests
was therefore to determine whether the migration
of voids into the Inconel, instituted by the leaching
of chromium during the corrosion process, would
continue if a loop were left at test temperature
without fuel,

Me tallographic examination of loop 1085 revealed
heavy surface roughening and heavy general sub-
surface-void formation to a depth of 1 mil in the
hot leg, accompanied by heavy intergranufar
subsurioce-void formation to a maximum depth of
8 mils. The cold leg showed only heavy surface
coughening, Comparison of the hot legs of loops
1085, 1086, and 1010, shown in Fig. 3.1.15, indi-
cated the attack in loops 1085 and 1086 to be
identical in depth, extent, and type of void forma-
tion, Further metallographic examination theough-
out both loops revealed similar corrosion of re-
spective metalfographic samples. In control loop
1010, which operated with o different batch of fuel,
the maximum hot-leg attack was 12 mils, which
represents the normal depth of corrosion of Inconel
under these conditions,

The results of these tests provide evidence that

NaF-KF-LiF-UF, and Sodium in Niobium

The compatibility of niobium with NaF-KF-Lif-
UF, {11.2:41.45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107) and with
sodium was studied in thermal-convection loops
operated at a maximum fluid temperature of 1500°F.
The loops, which were fabricated by Battelle
Memorial Institute, were slightly smaller than
the standerd loops employed for corrosion studies
of more common materials, The niobium tubing
used in the loops was fabricated from welded
sheet and had an inside diometer of 0.53 in. ond
a wall thickness of 0.020 in, In order to eliminate
the niobium oxidation problem which would exist
at the test temperature, the niobium was encased
in on outer sheath of type 321 stainless steel.
This sheoth completely surrounded the nicbium
loop but was not integrally bonded to it. Fabri-
cation of a sound loop of this design was difficult
in that cracks often developed in the niobium
tubing while the sheath was being assembled,

Three niobium loops (1072, 1073, and 1022) were
operated 1664, 1000, ond 775 hr, respectively,
with fue} 107 of a hot-leg temperature of 1500°F.
Termination of operation of loops 1072 and 1022
was caused by o power failure and loss of flow,
respectively. An analysis of the fuel circulated in
foop 1022 revealed a high buildup of chromium,
715 ppm, and pointed to the probability of a teak
that allowed the fuel to contact the cladding. The
examination of this loop showed an absence of
cold-leg deposits and only slight hot-leg attack in
the form of shallow pitting. Loops 1072 and 1073,
on the other hond, apparently remained sound
during operation, since no elements other than
niobium were found in the fuel after the tests,
However, macroscopic examination of the loops
revealed metallic crystals in the fuel layer close
to the cold-leg wall. These crystals were evideat
metallographically, and are shown in Fig. 3.1.16.
Hot-leg attack in these loops occurred as shallow

THERMAL-CONVECTION LOOP TEST OF

A thermal-convection loop fabricated of Hastelioy
B ond filled with sodium was operated to obtain
a comparison of the moss transfer and corrosion
resistance of Hastelloy B and Inconel in sodium
systems. The loop operoted for 1008 hr at a

were found between the amount of attack and
mass transfer found ia this loop and in two Inconel
loops operated under similar conditions.? In all

bottom of the cold leg was used to effect a very
sharp temperature drop and thus concentrate any
mass transfer deposits. Only o few very small
mass-transfer crystols were detected in the Hostel-

EFFECT OF ZIRCONIUM ON CORROSION IN
AN INCONEL-SODIUM SYSTEM

R. Carlander?

An Inconel-sodium thermal-convection loop with
a zirconium sleeve in its hot leg was operated
for 1000 hr with the hot leg at 1500°F and the
cold leg at 1230°F in order to determine whether
the zirconium would remove oxygen from the
sodium and thus affect the corrosion of the Inconel.
Since no mass transfer and little attack occurred,
the test indicated that the presence of zirconium
had a beneficial effect.” In an effort to sub-
stanticte Inconel standpipe
test copsules, one containing a zirconium speci-
men, the other an Inconel specimen, were 50%
filled with sodium and tested for 400 hr with the
top and bottom of the sodium bath at 1000 and
1600°F, respectively.

Mass transfer occurred in both capsules, and,
although the weight of the crystals found in each
capsule was approximately the same, the com-
position of the crystals (75.5% Ni—-10.4% Cr-14.1%
Fe) from the capsule containing the Inconel speci-
men differed markedly from that of the crystals
(95.6% Ni=3.5% C¢~0.9% Fe) from the capsule
which contained the zirconium specimen. The
effect of zirconium on the mass-transfer crystal
composition is not understood.

had formed. Metollographic examination revealed

that a transition from alpha to beta zirconium
occurred in the center of the specimen, as was
expected as a result of heating the zirconium
from room temperature to 1600°F. The outer
surfaces of the specimen, however, retained the
alpha structure to a depth of 40 mils, as shown
in Fig. 3.2.8. The retention of the alpho-structure
on the outer surfaces was thought to be due to
oxygen absorption which raised the alpha to beta
transition temperature, which is normally 1548°F,
to above the test temperature of 1600°F and thus
stabilized the clpha phase. In order to test this
hypothesis, two sets of millings from the surface
of the tested specimen, one to a depth of 40 mils
(alpha region) ond the other from a depth of 40
to 80 mils (beta region), and two sets of similar
millings an as-received

Table 3.2.2, revealed that the alpha region did
absorb oxygen during the test,

metals diffused from the alpha region to the beta
region during the test, as shown by the analytical

a three-phase diffusion zone formed in the 500-hr

four cermets were roughened to depth of 0.5 mil,
but the K152B and K16ZB specimens appeared
to be the most severely attacked. The attack
in each case may have been on on Ni-TiC solid
solution along the TiC-binder interface, since
it appeared that the metal binder had been removed
and that the TiC groins were slightly reduced
in size. The typical appeorance of the attack
is shown in Fig. 3.2.11. Chemical analyses of
the sodium baths after the tests showed erratic
scatter of the results from less than 15 to approxi-
mately 60 ppm of fitanium or nickel in 20-g
samples.

BORON CARBIDE AND BORON NITRIDE IN
MOLTEN SODIUM

W. H. Cook

The ceramics boron carbide and boron nitride
are of interest as refractory materials for use
in reactors as thermal-neutron obsorbers. In
recent standard screening tests of ceramics in
liquid metals, two boron carbide specimens,
with theoretical densities of 85 aad 90%, re-
spectively, had better corrosion resistance to
molten sodium than that previously observed.’

Each of the 8,C specimens wos exposed to
static sodium for 100 hr at 1500°F in Jnconel
The results of these tests are com-
pared with a result of an earlier test in Table
3.2.3. Since it is difficult to completely remove
sodium and sodium compounds from a porous
ceramic body, it is surprising that the calculated

A specimen of boron nitride (nominally, J x J

severely attacked in a 100-hr exposure to molten
sodium in a seesaw furnace operating at | cpm
with hot. ond cold-zone temperatures of 1500
ond 115(°F, respectively. The specimen container
was Inconel.

The measured weight loss of the specimen was
10.8%, ond the weight loss based on chemical
onalyses of the sodium after the test wos 8.2%
if all the boron found wos in the form of BN before
the test. Since the BN was extremely soft even
in the dense state, some of the weight loss could
have been due to offrition between the specimen
and its container. However, metallographic exami-
nation with reflected light showed thot the as-
tested specimen hod developed cracks below
and parallel to its surfaces. Under polarized
light, the specimen appeared to have altered
throughout. There wos a dense, shell-like ma-
terial approximately 0.003 in. thick surrounding
the core of the specimen. This ““shell’’ contained
the cracks observed with the reflected light. The

Considerable
improvement of enalytical techniques for deter-
mining the nitrogen, oxygen, and carbon contents

1956 and has been continued into fiscal year
1957. The thermal-convection loop design was

could be correlated. A lithium stitl has been in
operation at NDA for several months, and oll
tests are performed with the high-purity material

NICKEL-MOLYBDENUM ALLOY DEVELOPMENT

H. fnouye T. K. Roche

General Status of Development Program

The program for developing nickel-molybdenum
alloy container materials for fluoride fuels that
have better heat transfer properties than those of
Inconel was continued during this quarter. The
mos$ favorable characteristics of the new olioys in
comparison with [nconel are their superior corrosion
resistonce and strength. The corrosion resistance
of nearly every one of the new alloys tested in
NaF -KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel
107) was equivalent to that of Hastelloy B, and the
average stress-rupture life at 1500°F and a stress
of 8000 psi was about 400 hr, which is better than
that of Inconel by a factor of 4. These properties
attained without seriously affecting the
fobricability, ond the new alloys do not become
brittle during aging or welding.

In terms of reactor performance, it appears that

were

the nickel-molybdenum alloys will permit the use
of a more efficient fuel than that planned for use in
the ART and probably an increase of 150°F over
the ART operating temperature. Consequently,
every effort is being made to translate laboratory
data into commercial practice. With this objective,
the effort is being concentrated on one or two
promising compositions that are to be made in
pilot-plant quantities at the Westinghouse Electric
Corporation plant at Blairsville,

The properties of the alloys that have been
prepared in the laboratory are summorized below:

Fabricability, — The fabricability of the nickel-
molybdenum alloy depends on the quantities of
other elements that must be added to provide the
necessary strength. The indications ore that the
fabricability will be between that of Inconel and
that of Hastelloy B.

Corrosion Resistance, — The corrosion resistance
of the new alloys in fuel 107 and in sodium at
metal temperatures of 1650°F is equivalent to that
of Hastelloy B when the criterion is the depth of
corrosion. A more sensitive indication of corrosion
susceptibility is the change in the chemical compo-
sition of the fuel as a result of contact with the
alloy. indicoted that

Pennsylvania.

The corrosion tests hove

chromium, aluminum, and tungsten should be held
to a minimum in the new alloys.

Stress-Rupture Properties, — The stress-rupture
dato show that, in most coses, the new alloys fall
short of the goal of a rupture life of 1000 hr at
8000 psi and o temperature of 1500°F; however,
the considerable scotter of the data prevents
accurate strength estimates, The average creep
and stress-rupture properties of the various compo-
sitions tested to date are plotted in Fig. 3.3.1,
Since dota from all the alloys tested were averaged,
it is expected that the composition selected for
further development will have properties somewhat
better than those shown in Fig. 3.1.1.

Joining Characteristics. — The weldability of
these alloys has not been determined as fully as
desired. Hot ductility tests on some of the olloys
indicate that titanium and aluminum are undesirable,
as are niobium and fungsten when used in con-
junction with a high carbon content. Similarly, for
dry-hydrogen brazing the alloys should contain o
minimum of aluminum and titanium.

Oxidation Resistance. — The oxidation rate of
nearly every composition has been determined to be
tolerable in that over 60 thermai-convection loops
have been operated in air without failures of-
tributable to oxidation. The metal temperature
attained in these tests was approximately 1650°F
for periods of up to 1000 hr. The alloys that showed
the most oxidation contained tungsten ond niobium,

Aging Characteristics. — The stobility of each
alloy wos determined by observing the changes in
tensile strength, stress-rupture properties, and
hardness after agingat 1300°F. The agingresponse
was significant in compositions that contained 0.25%
Be or 2.0% Al + 1.5% Ti, Aslight response to aging
was observed for alloys containing 1.0% Al + 1.5%
Ti.

Properties of Alloy INOR-8

It appears ot this time that the alloy INOR-8,
which has as its basis the Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe system,
will offer the best compromise for meeting the
requirements of a container material for fused
fluorides.

Eighteen compositions, approximotely 3% ib
each, were melted under vacuum ond cast in
graphite. Aluminum, manganese, and carbon were
odded to each charge, primarily for deoxidation of
the melt. Each ingot was rolled to 0.065-in.-thick
strip from which two 11-in,-long creep specimens
were prepared. The remainder of the material was
rolled to 0.040-in.-thick strip from which die-cut
rensile specimens will be blanked,

Stress-rupture data were obtained for six of the
alloys in the solution-anneoled condition ot a

182

stress of 10,000 psi and a temperature of 1500°F
in argon. The results are presented in Tabte 3.3.9.
Although the stress-rupture properties do not follow
the anticipated trends, the alloys are stronger than
laconel aot this stress level and approach the
strength of type 316 stainless steel.

A Torced-circulation loop is to be fabricated from
an INOR-8 alloy containing 17% Mo-10% Cr-7%
Fe-0.06% C-bol Ni in which NaF-KF.LiF-UF,
(11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107) will be circu-
lated. Therefore two 3.5-1b ingots with the some
nominal composition, alloys VT-51 and VT-52, were
cast for preparing stress-upture specimens for
testing in fuel 107. One melt, VT-5}, was prepared
from elemental stock, and the other, VT-52, from
Inconel diluted with Ni, Mo, and Fe. Actual
analyses of these two alloys showed the molybde-
Aum content to be approximately 19.5%; however,
the composition is stifl bracketed by the limits
described for the study of the INOR-8 alloy system.
Both these alloys had 1000-hr rupture strengths of
8000 psi ot 1500°F in fuel 107. Metollographic
studies of alloys VT-51, VT-43 (10% Mo-5% Cr~4%
Fe-0.06% C-bal Ni), ond VT-49 (15% Mo-7%
Cr-4% Fe-0.06% C~bal Ni) indicated that VT.51
responded to aging ot 1300 and 1500°F and thus
had higher strength than alloys VT-43 and VT-49,
which did not show this gross aging response. It
therefore appears that higher strengths can be
achieved in the Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe system by raising the
quantities of the elements odded to the nickel.

and aging characteristics of the materials.

Properties of Alloy INOR-9

Compositions designated INOR-9 are prepared by
adding Nb, V, or Fe plus C to the bosic Ni-Mo
composition. Certain elements, namely, Cr, Al, Ti,
and W, are excluded becouse of their corrosion
tendencies in fuel 107. Previous studies of the
oxidation choracteristics of nickel-molybdenum
alloys showed that stable oxide scales were formed
when the molybdenum content was lower than 15%.
The strengths of the solid-solution alloys of nickel
ond molybdeaum show strong dependence on the
molybdenum content, and thus support is given to
the theory that solid-solution strengthening is
dependent upon the extent of alloying.! In order to
maintain the molybdenum level as low as possible
for oxidation resistance and yet to have the highly
olloyed composition needed for strength, niobium
additions are being made to the nickel-molybdenum
base alloy. The compositions which exhibit maxi-
mum solid solubility ore being determined, and their
oxidation characteristics in the temperature range
of interest are being studied. For practical reasons
the alloys contain iron, which is derived from the
ferroniobium melting stock. The compositions and
the properties of the alloys being studied are given
in Table 3.3.10.

Alloy Development at Battelle Memorial Institute

Work on the nickel-molybdenum alloy development
program being conducted by Battelle Memorial
Institute under Subcontract 979 continued along the
lines described previously. *> ORNL has assisted
Battelle in their program by determining the stress-
rupture properties of selected olloys in the fuel
mixture NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (11.2-41.45.3.2.5 mole
%, fuel 107) and by extruding numerous tube blonks
of their alloys for corrosion evaluation, From the
tubing successfully fabricated to date, ORNL has
operated thermal-convection loops with both fuel
107 and sodium. Emphasis is now being placed on
the fabrication of tube blanks of alloys selected
for forced-circulation loop tests with fuel 107 to be
performed at Battelle.

Four tube blanks of each of the Battelle alloys
B-3404, B8-3407, B-3412, and B-3418, described
previously, were extruded and sent to the Superior
Tube Co. for redrawing to small-diameter tubing.
However, all the blanks failed on the tube reducer
and thus substantiated ecrlier evidence that afloys
with 0.12% carbon are not amenable to tube-reducing
operations, At the recommendation of Superior Tube

Thus it appears that temperoture-
gradient mass transfer is an inherent characteristic
of aickel-base alloys and thot it increcses in
severity with increasing temperatures. Since the

a considerable quantity of duplex tubing was pre-

composite billets were coextruded to produce 3-in.-

SHIELD PLUGS FOR ART PUMPS
J.P. Page

Two full-sized gamma-ray shielding plugs for
ART fuel pumps were prepared. The plugs are
composed of 75 wt % tungsten carbide and 25 wt %
Hastelloy C. The first plug was hot pressed in a
large horizontal press, and the die material was
CS-312 graphite rather thon the AGHT-grade previ-
ously used. The die fractured ot about 1800 psi
ond caused loteral expansion of she pressed plug
and the die parts.

A vertical hot-pressing facility was adapted for
pressing the second plug, and co die identical to
the first one wos used. Even though the pressure
was limited to 1600 psi, this die also failed of the
end of the pressing cycle, and some lateral ex-
pansion occurred. However, the pressed plug had o
uniform density of 12,1 g/cm®,

These plugs will be surface ground on one end
face and used for brazing and thermal-shock tests.
A new graphite die has been designed and ordered
for which the dimensions ore such thot the hot-
pressed plugwill require little or no grinding on the
inner or outer surfaces. This die was made some-
what stronger by increasing the outside diameter
and eliminating the sight hole.

TUBULAR CONTROL RODS
M. R. D'Amore

The feasibility study of extrusion of control rods
was continued. Previous studies indicated that
cracking of the cermet core (30 wt % Lindsay oxide—
70 wt % Ni) in extruded three-ply tubes may have
been coused by thermal stresses between the core
and Hastelloy X cladding. Therefore the cladding
material for the tube-extrusion studies has been
changed 10 Inconel, which has a thermal exponsion

nearly equal to that of the cermet core moterial.
The dispersion of fine particles of Lindsoy oxide,
which form a nearly continuous network in fobricated
cores, may also contribute to the poor duct
observed in tensile specimens and in extruded
three-ply tubes, '?

The major effort has been directed toward the
production of strong, high-density 44- to 105-
particles of Lindsay oxide. The procedure de-

lies between 1100 and 1350°C, depending on the
omount of cold work to which the material is
subjected.

Several techniques are being considered for
conducting the numerous onnealing treatments
required, These include vacuum encapsulation
with and without the addition of getters, treatment
in dynamic vacuums of various orders of magnitude,
and treatment in high-purity argon. Each of these
techniques hos an advantage in certain conditions:
the orgon otmosphere is recommended for short-
time, high-temperature treatment, the dynamic
vacuum for intermediate temperature and times, and
the vacuum capsule for extended times of lower
temperatures. A quontitative survey of the effects
of time and temperature on the microhardness and
the lattice parameter of powder specimens is being
conducted for each environment.

Identical microstructures for powder-metallurgy
ond arc-cast materials have been achieved. The
niobium specimens were severely worked (reduced
in thickness by 90%) and annealed for 1 hr at
1250°C in a dynamic vocuum of approximately 10-6
mm Hg. The resuftont material is very fine-groined,
but the grains show elongation in the direction of

192

rolling. Also, the severe reduction limits the
thickness of the material available for the recrystal-
tization study. Further work will be done with
lower reduction ratios ond longer annealing times
in an attempt to develop a more randomly oriented
microstructure in a thicker material.

METAL HYDRIDES FOR USE AS MODERATORS
IN HIGH-TEMPERATURE REACTORS

R. A. Potter R. E. McDonald!
T. Hikido'2

The realization of the great potential improve
ment in performance of circuloting-fuel reactors
which is offered by the NaF-KF-LiF-base fuels
and the nickel-molybdenum olloys will depend to a
large extent on the development of an adequate
moderator for use at high temperatures. Of the
possible moteriols, BeO, beryllium canned in
molybdenum, and the hydrided metals, the last
appear to offer the most promise, Research at the
General Electric Company and other organizations
has shown that certain metals, notably zirconium
and yttrium, are able to absorb and retain large
quantities of hydrogen at high temperatures ond yet
retain their metallic characteristics, However, at
the temperature of interest for advanced reactors,
over 2000°F, yttrium is the only material known at
this time which offers promise of being satisfactory.

Capsule for In-Pile Tests

An active research and development program on
hydrided metals was initiated, with one of the
first projects being fabrication of the capsule
shown in Fig. 3.3.8 for in-pile tests. The speci-
men consists of hydrided zirconium (N, = 3.5)
contained in a 0.025-in.-thick arc-cast 0.5% titanium-
molybdenum alloy capsule. The ends of the capsule
ore J in. thick ond the over-all dimensions ore,
nominally, J in. dio x 3 in. long. No protective
cladding was put over the molybdenum, because the
test will be made in a helium atmosphere,

The molybdenum capsule was machined from J-
india rod. A rod of reactor-grade zirconium was
machined to 0.460 in. in diameter ond 2.75 in. in
length ond o india hole drilled through it
lengthwise. This zirconium cylinder was iron-
ploted fo o thickness of 1.75 mils to aid in achieving

was inserted into the molybdenum capsule and
bydrided in situ to an Ny of 3.7, calculoted on the
basis of weight gain. The lin. hole was reamed

fitted into the hole. The colculoted N, after homo-
geneization of the rod is 3.5. A l-mil iron-foif
disk wos placed over the hydrided zirconium, and
the molybdenum ead plug was inserted and copper-
brozed in place. After hoving been brazed, the
capsule was machined fo size (0.025-in.-wall thick-
ness) and tested at 1650°F for 1 hr under a vacuum
of 3 x 107% mm Hg. The weight loss of 4.2 mg
under these conditions was not considered to be
serious. After the capsule was inspected by
radiography, six Chromel-Alumel thermocouples
were attached by spot-welding. The completed
assembly was heated in an argon atmosphere to
1650°F, cooled to approximately BOOF, reheated
to 1650°F, and cooled to room temperature, The
thermocouples remained securely attached after
this treatment.

A second specimen was processed simultaneously
with the in-pile test capsule in order to provide o
control sample for examination, However, this
specimen wos over-heated during the brazing
operation and is therefore not truly representative
of the in-pile test capsule, Metallographic exomi-
nation of the control somple showed evidence of
she over-heating in the form of melting ond de-
composition of the hydride ot the brazed end of
the capsule. Although o tight fit was observed

between the hydrided zirconium and the molybdenum
in the other areas of the capsule, the metallurgical
bond was not uniform.

The in-pile test capsule was scheduled to go into
the MTR on February 18, 1957. The calculated
maximum operating temperature will be 1550 to
1600°F, and 100 thermal cycles will be imposed by

moving the test container in and out of the reactor.

Electric Company and Sylvania Electric Products,

Yttrium Metal Production

Research on hydrided yttrium is being seriously
hampered by the unavailability of the material.

193
ANP PROJECT PROGRESS REPORT

Although a considerable amount of work is being
done at the Ames Laboratory, lowe State College,
to alleviate this shortage, it was deemed advisable
to produce some yttrium at ORNL. The available
experience in fluoride technology was a major factor
influencing this decision, because the conversion
of Y,05 to YF, is an important step in the process.
The purity of the fluoride controls the purity of the
final product to a large extent. Accordingly, 15 Ib
of Y,0, was obtoined and 1000 g was converted
to the fluoride. In the reduction process, which
was developed at the Ames Laboratory, the yftrium
fluoride will be reduced with a mixture of calcium,
magnesium, and calcium chloride. The yttrium-
magnes ium-calcivm alloy thus formed will be refined
by vacuum distillation to remove the magnesium
and the calcium. The resulting yttrium sponge will
then be vacuum melted.

Fabrication of the equipment for producing the
metal hos been completed, and it is now being
assembled and checked. The entire process from
mixing of the starting material to the vacuum dis-
tillation of the alloy will be performed under a
vacuum or an inert-gas atmosphere, It is expected
that the first metal will be produced in March 1957,

HEAT EXCHANGER FABRICATION
ART Sodiumete-NaK Heat Exchangers
G. M. Slaughter

Brazing procedures are being developed for use
in the fobrication of ART sodium-to-NaK heat
exchangers by the Griscom-Russell Co. Ex-
amination of a variety of tube-to-hecder samples
from several brazing experiments performed at the
Griscom-Russeil Co. has revealed inconsistent
flow and fitleting. A typical example of this
condition on a tube-to-header join is shown in
Fig. 3.4.1.

Attempts have been mode at ORNL to duplicate
the difficulties experienced by the vendor and then
to alleviate them by suitable variotions in brazing
procedure. For the initial tests, the vendor's
heating rate of approximately 100°F/hr wos used.
Samples taken from a typical test assembly before
and after brazing at this rote of temperature rise
are shown in Figs, 3.4.2 ond 3.4.3, The influence
of the following variobles was studied in these
tests: (1) type of Coast Metals brazing alloy
No. 52 ring (ORNL cast ring vs York Corp. sintered
ring), (2) differences in Inconel base material
(ORNL headers vs Griscom-Russell headers),
(3) angle of countersink in headers, and (4) direct
impingement of hydrogen on samples vs slight

complished at 1920°F if oll variables such as
hydrogen purification, hydrogen flow rate, material
cleanliness, etc, are carefully controlled. How-
ever, only minor deviations from the optimum
conditions may result in inconsistent brazing at a
100°F /hr rate of temperature rise.

Additional experiments were then conducted at
200°F/hr and ot 300°F/hr rates of temperature
rise, As can be seen in Figs. 3.4.4 ond 3.4.5,
samples brazed at 300°F/hr had satisfactory
fillets on oll joints. With the faster heating rates,
it appeared thot brozing could be conducted under
slightly reloxed conditions with a reasonable
assuronce of success. The 300°F/hr heating rate,
which should be readily ottaincble with most
industrial equipment, provides a high degree of
assurance of successful brazing.

Investigation of Rapid Heating Cycles

E. A. Franco-Ferreira

Tests were run to investigate the feasibility of
using very short heating cycles (of the order of
5 min) for the back brazing of heat-exchanger
tube-to-tube sheet joints. The experimental
procedure consisted essentially in heating the
welded side of a small Inconel tube sheet while
providing a vacuum or an inert atmosphere for
protection on the opposite side, which was to be
brazed. The heat source used in the experiments
was a salt-bath furnace.

It is felt that certain advantages might ocerue
from this method of brazing, such as minimization
of grain growth in the tubes and reduction of
tube-wall dilution, while avoiding distortion and
the jigging problems associated with conventionol
furnace brazing of entire assemblies. One of the
experimental configurations is shown in Figs.
3.4.6 and 3.4.7. A section through a typical joint
brozed by this method is shown in Fig. 3.4.8.

This method of brazing is not limited fo the use
of a salt-bath furnace as a heat source. It is felt
thot high-energy radiant heat sources based on
surface combustion units could also be used to
odvantoge. Although the experiments described
above were preliminary, the results do indicate the
feasibility of using rapid heating cycles for some
high-temperature heat exchanger brazing operations.

ART FILL-AND-DRAIN TANK FABRICATIOR

E. A. Franco-Ferreira G. M, Slaughter

A study of the problems associated with the
fabrication of the ART fill-and-drain tank is under
way. Specifically, fests are being run to establish
welding and brazing procedures for the tube-to-tube
sheet joints in the tonk heads. As a result of the
high degree of restraint exerted by the 14-in.-thick
tube sheet, tube-to-tube sheet welds made with the
standard fusion procedure used for thin tube sheets
consistently exhibited root cracking of the type
illustrated in Fig. 3.4.9. The direct aim of the
welding investigations has been to arrive at o
welding procedure which “will produce joints free
of such root cracks. A promising joint design
currently being investigated is o trepanned type,
an example of which is shown in Fig. 3.4.10.

Brozing experiments ore also under way to
determine the proper amount of preplaced brazing
alloy, the type of preplacement procedures, and a
suitable brazing cycle. In the initial experiments,
the Coast Metals brazing alloy Ne. 52 was preplaced
in the form of rings, two per tube, as shown in
Fig. 3.4.11. A photograph of a typical as-brazed
test sample is shown in Fig. 3.4.12.

The optimum procedures for welding and brazing
have not yet been determined. Various modifi-
cations in technique are to be studied in subse-
quent experiments.

Hostelloy B specimens and acceptable ductilities
(greater than 10% elongation} in all but two speci-
mens. Aging for 200 hr at 1300 and 1500°F re-
sulted in considerable loss of ductility.

5. Hastelloy W is notch-sensitive at 1300°F.

6. Failures in Hastelloy W weldments exhibit a
tendency to occur of the interface between the
weld and the base metal,

7. Hostelloy W weld metal appears to be stronger
and less ductile than the base metal.

8. Weldments of Hastelloy B plate with Hastelioy
W welding wire showed a morked tendency to fail
at gage morks in the bose metal or of weld defects.
No apparent advantage is gained by using this
filler wire instead of Hastelloy B filler metal.

9. Vacuum-melted Hastelloy B welding wire has
essentially the some choracteristics as those of
commercially available Hastelloy B wire.

Welding and Brazing Studies of Experimental
Nickel-Molybdenum Alloys

The Yin. plate required for welding studies of
some of the nickel-molybdenum experimental
alloys was received and tests were initiated to
determine the welding ond brazing characteristics
of these materials. The test specimens were
prepared by the methods described previously.’
The observations made in the fests thus far are
presented in Table 3.4.8. Since alloys INOR-7
and -8 are currently of maximum interest, it is
encouraging to note that no cracking tendencies
were found in these tests. Tensile data for other
promising alloys will be reported as they become
available,

recommended thot the retort be boffled to obtain
more positive circulation of hydrogen, particularly
through the fin bank, during the brazing operations.
The size of the retort should be held to a minimum
to lessen channeling of the gos flow and to reduce
the total mass. Very stringent cleaning and
storage procedures should be followed throughout
the fabrication process. It was suggested thot the
assembled fin banks be placed in airtight con-
tainers before brozing. The fins should be de-
greased immediately prior to assembly. A rate of
temperature rise of greater than 300°F/hr (prefer-
ably 400 to 600°F/hr) should be used through
the temperature range of 1700 to 1900°F. Further

STUDIES OF GRAIN GROWTH IN
INCONEL TUBES

E. J, Wilson G. M. Slaughter

The interest in maintaining @ fine-grained
structure in the Inconel tubing used for reactor heat
exchanger and radiotor components has led to a
preliminary study of the grain growth that results
from various brazing and heat-treating operations.
The initial results of this study indicated that
stress-relief treatments at 1500°F did not result in
groin growth, while significant grain growth re-
sulted from hr brazing cycles at approximately
1922°F. It was also noted that growth proceeded
more repidly in the grains located olong the outer
wall of the tube than in those located along the
inner wall,

Since high-temperature back-brazing is required
in the fabrication of many components, o more
detailed study was undertaken to determine the
influence of the different variables on the grain
growth choracteristics of the tubing. The infor-
mation obtoined from an onolysis and evaluation of
growth behavior will be useful in determining the
optimum procedures for fobricating the various
components,
 

Influence of Brazing Temperature

Two different lots of CX-900 Incone! tubing were
used for an investigation of the effect of the
brazing temperature on grain growth, These lots
of tubing were identified as heat 5759 (0.187 in. OD,
0.025 in. woll) and heot 5789 (0.229 in. OD, 0.025
in. wall).
cleaned with ocetone and subjected to various
brazing temperatures for 30 min in dry hydrogen.
After the heat treatment the samples were sectioned
and examined in both the transverse and the
longitudinal direction. Photomicrographs of the
structures of the heat-treated specimens of 0.187-
in.-OD tubing are presented in Fig. 3.4.16 in the
order of increasing brazing temperatures. Although
wide variations in grain size occurred along the
outer peripheries of the tubes, the photomicrographs
shown are typical of the oreos thot experienced
After the 30-min
heat treatment at temperatures os low as 1814°F
ond up to and including 1904°F, the grain growth
wos found predominantly in the grains along the
tube. The fine-grained
structure along the inner surfoce appeared to be
relatively stable. After heating at 1922°F and
above, general grain growth wos evident, that is,
grains along both the inner and outer surfaces
had grown to significant proportions and many of
those which originated on the outer surface had

One-inch segments from each lot were

outer surface of the

grown completely across the tube wall. As would
be expected, the frequency of large grains in-
creased with increasing temperature,

The trends observed in these tests are illustrated
in Fig. 3.4.17, in which the grain size is plotted
as a function of temperature for both the outer and
the imner tube surfaces. The grain dimensions
selected for plotting were representative of the
grain sizes in areas that exhibited definite grain-
coarsening tendencies. At the higher temperatures
the curves reflect the coexistence of large ond
small grains in the tube wall. For example, the
tube heated ot 1922°F for 30 min had grains that
penetrated radially from the outside surfoce com-
pletely through the tube wall, but there were
adjacent areas that contoined smaller grains.

Influence of Time at Temperature

It was felt that the time at temperature might
also be an important factor in grain growth, and

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 31, 1957

therefore a study was initiated in which both time
and temperature were varied. For these experi-
ments, 0.187-in.-0D, 0.025-in.-wall CX-900 Inconel
tubing from heat 5759 was cleoned with acetone
and sectioned into 1-in. segments, which were then
heat treated at various temperatures for vorious

times. The heat-treated segments were then
sectioned in the transverse and longitudinal
directions for grain-size determinations. Photo-

micrographs of the structures of the heat-treated
specimens are shown in Fig. 3.4.18. As may be
seen the lowest temperature employed (1868°F)
and the 5- and 10-min time intervals produced no
appreciable grain growth along the outer periphery.
The specimens held at 1868°F for 30 min, however,
showed sporadic grain coarsening at the outer
periphery. More extensive grain coarsening oc-
curred in the specimen held at temperature for
1 br, as was expected. After 5 and 10 min ot
1904°F, no grain growth was observed, but after
30 min at this temperoture, some growth was
evident. After 1 hr, grains occasionally penetrated
completely through the tube wall, and the inner
surface grains afso had grown.

In the tests at 1922°F outer periphery groin
growth became quite noticeable after 5 min at
temperature, Since it hod been estoblished previ-
ously that excessive grain growth would occur in
30 min at 1922°F, no further experiments were
conducted.

Influence of Tube-Straightening and
Tube-Polishing Operations

A group of experiments was conducted to study
tube-straightening and tube-
polishing operations on grain growth in CX-900
laconel tubing. Since these operations impose a
small degree of cold deformation on the tubing, it
was desirable to determine whether this cold work
was a major confributor fo the outer-surface grain

the influence of

growth noted upon heating at high temperatures.
Samples of 0.187-in.-OD and 0.229-in.-OD tubing
were obtained in the following conditions: (1) an-
nealed, (2) anneoled and straightened, and (3) an-
nealed, straightened, and polished. The somples
were then examined os-received, or subjected io o
brazing cycle of 30 min at 1868°F and examined,
or subjected to a brazing cycle of 2 hr at 1922°F
ond examined. The specimens were cut transversely
and mounted for microscopic examination.

As may be seen in Figs. 3.4.19 ond 3.4.20 the
two sizes of tubing reacted somewhat differently
when subjected to the brazing cycles. However,
it is evident that the straightening ond polishing
operations had only minor effects on the grain
growth. The as-annealed tubing also showed
definite grain growth at the outer surface.

Influence of Cold Work

The recrystallized grain size of a metal de-
creases with increasing amounts of cold work, ond
therefore it was thought that cold working could
be used to produce ¢ medium-sized grain structure
after brazing. Preliminary studies of the influence
of cold work were conducted on small segments
cut from onnealed Inconel sheet, The segments
were cleaned with acetone to remove dirt and
grease ond then examined in the os-received
condition and ofter they had been reduced in
thickness 2.5, $5, 8, 12, ond 15%, respectively,
by cold rolling.

The samples that were cold rolled were placed in
a retort and subjected to a typical brazing cycle
(heated at 300°F/hr to 1922°F, held for 30 min af
1922°F, and cooled at 600°F /br) before they were
prepared for metallographic examination of grain
growth,

A medium-sized grain structure was observed
after heat treatment of the samples which hod been
cold reduced 5, 8, 12, ond 15%. Some grain
coarsening wos observed, however, in the sample
reduced 2.5%. The smallest grain size was ob-
served in the sample heat-treated after 15% cold
reduction.

A length of Yhord (approximately 15% cold
reduced) Inconel tubing was therefore acquired
from the Superior Tube Co. for further experiments.
Samples of this 0.250-in.-OD, 0.035-in.-wa!l tubing
were prepared and subjected to various simulated
brozing cycles,

studying the effect of atmosphere purity, vorious
etching and abrasion techniques were employed
in preparing the surfaces, and several types of

shields were used in welding the samples in the
open atmosphere.

The series of samples prepored by various
cleaning techniques were welded in a dry box.
They showed that acid etching resulted in welds
with somewhat better ductility than those prepared
by other methods, They exhibited bend angles at
fracture of 40 deg at room temperature and 76 deg
at 75°C compared with average bend angles of
28 ond 62 deg, respectively, for other samples.
For weldments prepared in air, the samples welded
with a trailing shield showed significantly better
ductility thon all other samples.

Relaxation tests of Inconel annealed ot 2050°F
for 2 hr were completed at 1300, 1500, and 1650°F,
and the results are presented in Figs. 3.5.1, 3.5.2,
and 3.5.3. The tests were run ot total strains of
0.05, 0.1, and 0.2% at 1300°F and of 0.05 and 0.1%
at 1500 and 1650°F. One specimen was used at
each temperature to determine the relaxation rates
for all strains. The procedure was to run four
successive 100-hr tests with 0.05% total strain and
then tun the tests with higher total strains. This
wos done to determine the effect on the relaxation
rates of prior strain at the test temperature. It was
found that the prior strain only slightly affected the
relaxation properties of annealed Inconel tested of
1300°F, as shown in Fig, 3.5.1. It may also be
seen that, at oll temperotures, when the total sirain
is greater than 0.05%, which is the strain of the
proportional limit for coarse-groined Inconel at
these test temperatures, the relaxation rate is the
same os that of the 0.05% total strain test. Since

at these test temperatures strain hordening is
small and recovery occurs rapidly, it follows that
the plastic strain given the specimen on loading to
total strains greater than the elastic limit hos no
effect on the relaxotion rate of the material.
However, at temperatures less than 1300°F, this
may not be the case, and the motericl may reflect
the effects of strain hardening in its relaxation
rate.

The stroin-cycling equipment described pre-
viously? was in operation during the quarter and
preliminary results were obtained at a test tempera-
ture of 1500°F. The greatest number of tests were
run with rod specimens in two conditions, os-
received ond annealed at 2050°F for 2 hr. The
test results are shown in Fig. 3.5.4, in which the
log of the plastic strain (€,) per cycle is plotted
vs the log of the number of cycles to failure. The
procedure of operation has been to apply a load

and then to reverse the load to produce the same
plastic strain in the opposite direction. The
plastic strain vs time wave has the shape shown
on Fig. 3.5.4. It may be seen thot the coarse
grained specimens (annealed at 2050°F for 2 hr)
exhibit fewer cycles to failure for all values of

that will result in failure from fatigue can be

show that, at o temperature of 1400°F, application
of constant load stresses up to 4000 psi will not
significontly alter the stress to produce a fatigue

ALLOY DEVELOPMENT
J. W. Woods

Evaluation studies were made of the creep and
creep-rupture characteristics under a constant load
of two experimental nickel-molybdenum alloys
being developed for reactor use. The environment
used in these tests was the fused salt NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, {11.2-41-45.3-2.5 mole %, fuel 107). The
two olloys tested were vacuum melted at ORNL.
Heat VT-51 had the nominal composition (in wt %)
17 Mo—10 Cr-0.5 AI-0.5 Mn-0.06 C-7 Fe~bal Ni,
and heat VT-52 contained (in wt %) 17 Mo-10
Cr-0.06 C-7 Fe-bal Ni. The results of the tests
are presented in Table 3.5.1. The corrosion of the
unstressed surfaces of the specimens from both

220

heats thot were solution annealed at 2000°F for |
hr and aged at 1300°F for 50 hr was 0.5 to 1 mil.

The compositions of the two alloys were virtually
identical, but the methods of preporotion were
different. Heot VT-51 was prepared from elemental
melting stock, and heat VT-52 was prepared from
Inconel diluted with Ni, Mo, and Fe. Alloy VT-51
demonstrated an aging response, while alloy VT-52
did not. Because the alloys were prepared in
small heats, variations in mechanical properties of
of the two alloys were to be expected. Both alloys
exhibited good ductility.

Photomicrographs of the specimens are shown in
Figs. 3.5.6 and 3.5.7. The formation of a con-
tinuous network of carbides around each grain is
shown in Fig. 3.5.6, whereas in Fig. 3.5.7 the

carbide precipitate in the grain boundories has a
more random arrangement which could account for
the lower strength exhibited by alloy VT-52. In
general the precipitates were well dispersed in
both specimens.

Hastelloy B hos received considerable attention
in the olloy development program because it is
commercially ovailable and it hos excellent high-
temperature strength ond corrosion resistance.
However, the absence of chromium in Hastelloy B
results in characteristically poor oxidation re
sistance. One aim of the development program,
therefore, is to introduce sufficient chromium to
provide good oxidation resistance but not enough
to result in severe corrosion. Hastelloy C, which
is alsa a commercially available nickel-molybdenum
alloy, contains 15 wt % chromium. It was recognized
that this amount of chromium would lead to con-
siderable corrosive ottack, but, since the composi
tion of this alloy represents an upper limit of

222

chromium, it was decided that a certain amount of
data on its strength properties in fused salts would
be pertinent to the problem. Therefore, stress-
rupture data were obtained ot 1300, 1500, and
1650°F in fuel 107 for comparison with data for
other alloys being investigated.

The results of the tests are shown in Fig. 3.5.8.
The data show quite good stress-rupture properties,
and it appears that for 10,000 psi at 1500°F
Hastelloy C will have a rupture life of over 1000
hr. The two specimens tested at 1500°F in
Hastelloy B creep test chambers had poorer stress-
rupture properties than those tested in a Hastelley
C test chamber. This moy be explained by the
fact that the creep test chamber made of Hastelloy
B contained no chromium and thus provided,
through alloying ond diffusion, a strong '‘sink’’ for
chromium and accelerated the removal of chromium
from the specimen.
The results of the alloy development program
thus far indicate that considerable progress has
been mode toward ochieving the objective of de-
veloping a material that is as fabricable as required
for reactor possesses adequate
strength, ond resistant in high-
temperature fuel mixtures, liquid metals, and air.

strength, will have to be avoided, since, at the
temperatures of interest, they precipitate a brittle
phase that causes poor fabricability and low
ductility. Experimental nickel-molybdenum alloys
of the single-phase or solid-solution type have the
desired fabricability and corrosion resistance, but
they lack adequate creep strength. In spite of the
poorer creep strength, however, these alloys are
stronger than Inconel.

In the current contractual year the work has been
concerned with measuring the elevated-temperature
tensile and stress-rupture propeities of samples
trepanned from the blocks being hot-pressed for
the ART. It was felt desirable to determine
whether the lineor relationship between oxide
content and strength revealed by the past work
would be evidenced in the larger pressings. Also,
some evaluation of the blocks is required to ensure
that the strength does not fall significantly below
the strength on which design calculations were
based. The results of the tests, as reported in

Below the traces are plots of the average outside

These traces were made at an operating frequency
of 189 ke, for which the ///_ ratio is approximately
15 for the 0.229-in.-OD, 0.025-in.-wall Inconel
tubing. This frequency and wall thickness (11%
of OD) have an operating point on the graph of
Fig. 3.6.2 such that the resistive component is
at a maximum as a function of wall thickness.
At this point small changes in wall thickness
cause afmost no change in the resistive com-
ponent, but do cause maximum change in the
reactive component. Theoretically, changes in
diameter should affect both channels. However,
the traces of Figs. 3.6.3 and 3.6.4 cleorly indicate
that the diameter signals are predominate in the
resistive component and have o negligible effect
on the reactive component. Unfortunately, the
variations in both diameter and wall thickness
characteristically follow each other at about the
same period, ond therefore close analysis is
very difficult. Further investigation of this effect
is planned with the use of machined tubes in
which changes in diameter and wall thickness
moy be introduced and controlled separately.

Cladding Thickness Measurements
J. W. Allen R. A. Nonce

The feasibility of determining the thickness of
the cladding on Mark X MTR fue! plates with an
eddy-current probe coil was investigated. Although
this study hos no immediate application to ANP
work, mony of the problems involved are very
similor to problems associated with inspections
of control rods ond other clad or shrouded os-
semblies.

The Mark X MTR fuel plates are composed of
© 0.022-in. nominal thickness core of 52 wt % Al-
48 wt % U alloy clod with o 0.020-in. nominal
thickness of type 6061 aluminum alloy. The defor-
mation choracteristics of the core ond the cladding

alloy are not the same; hence, during the rolling of
the plate to a uniform thickness, the deformation of
the core is frequently nonuniform. The result
is a thick section at each end of the core, the
longitudinal cross section of which resembles a
““dog bone.” Since the plate is of uniform thick.
ness, the cladding over the thick sections at the
extremities of the core is of course much thinner
than the 0.020-in. nominal thickness. The pos-
sibility of a 0.003- to 0.005-in. depth of corrosion
attack necessitates the location and rejection of
fuel plates which have excessive ‘dog boning.”

To facilitate the investigation of this problem
and to determine the best operating parameters
for the eddy-current test, the prototype instrument
described in the block diagram of Fig. 3.6.5 was

instrument was to determine the best coil design

and the optimum operating frequency, it is more
complex and contains more controls than would
be required on a production inspection instrument.

The instrument consists of a vorioble-frequency
oscillator which supplies alternating current to
the probe coil through an isclating network and
to a balancing network. The isolating network
prevents the presence of the probe coil from
affecting the voltage supplied to the balancing
circuitry, and supplies the probe coil with current
of constant amplitude. Since the probe coit current
is constant in amplitude, the voltage at the
terminals of the probe is directly related to its
impedance, which in turn is influenced by the
metal specimen in proximity with it. The balancing
network is adjusted manually until the voltage
at the network output terminal is equel to the
voltage across the coil, of the initial test con-
dition, in both amplitude and phase. Any chonge
of the test condition changes the voltage at the
coil in phase or amplitude or both. The difference
in the voltage of the coil and of the balancing
network is amplified, and hence any change in
coil voltage causes a meter deflection.

After some experimenting, the probe design
shown in Fig. 3.6.5 was established. The coil
consists of approximately 540 turns of No. 40
enameled copper wire in a small, cup-shaped

eliminates spurious signals caused by the varying
coupling associated with a hand-held probe.

Three considerations were of primary importance
in selecting an optimum test frequency. First,
the frequency was to be sufficiently high to
sensitively detect the difference between the
type 6061 aluminum atloy cladding {conductivity =
45% ACS?) and the uranium-aluminum alloy core
(conductivity = 22.8% IACS). Second, it was to
be sufficiently low to penetrate the nominal 0.020-

in its thickness. Also, it was to be sufficiently
high that the 0.022-in.-thick core underneath the
0.020-in.-thick cladding would appear infinitely
thick {that is, no eddy-current penetration through
the core). This is necessory to prevent the clad
thickness on the ‘‘back side’ of the plate from
influencing the thickness determinations made
The optimum
frequency determined experimentally to satisfy
these conditions was 20 kc.

Correlation of the meter deflection with the
cladding thickness was experimentally determined
by first odjusting the instrument to read neorly

on the side under surveillance.

of bare uronium-aluminum core, and to read zero
with the probe coil placed on an apparent “‘infinite’’

the cladding alloy, which varied from 0.003 to
0.020 in. in thickness, were then used to obtain
the information for the calibration curve shown
in Fig. 3.6.6.

Three Mark X fuel plates were examined, and
only one showed sufficient variation in cladding
thickness to warrant a more detailed inspection.
This plate was scanned on both sides, with each
pass of the probe coil overlapping the previous
pass to ensure complete coverage of the surfoce.
The greater portion of the clodding was indicated
to be from 0.017 to 0.020 in. thick. All deviations

cases where the metaliographic measurement differs
from the eddy-current measurement, the difference
is 0.001 in. below the value obtained by the eddy-
current technique. It is therefore concluded that
upon choosing the optimum operating porameters,
the cladding thickness on Mark X MTR fuel plates
can be determined to within 0.001 in.with the
use of an eddy-current probe coil.

There is no comprehensive theory for the ap-
plication of eddy-current probe coils on metal
surfaces such as the theory which exists for
the use of coils encircling rods or tubes. This
Jack of theoretical background requires that each
problem be considered separately and that general
statements regarding the capabilities of the probe-
coil technique be carefully qualified. The ex-
perience gained in the measurement of the cladding

230

thickness of the Mark X fuel plates indicates
that if the two metals, forming a system, have a
in the order of 2:1 or
greoter, the thickness of the accessible layer
can be accurately measured. As the conductivities
of the two materials approach the same value,
this system of measurement becomes useless.

Continued the eddy-current
probe-coil technique should result in the satis-
factory measurement of cladding thickness of
most alloys on o cermet core, of any of the oxi-
datioa-resistant alloys over molybdenum or niobium
cores, of an austenitic stainless steel over a
nickel-molybdenum alloy core, or of a nickel-
molybdenum alloy over an austenitic stainless
steel core. The ability of this method to measure
Inconel on austenetic stainless steel or austenetic
stainless steel on Inconel is currently considered
to be marginal,

The eddy-current probe-coil method of measuring
thickness is of the existence or
condition of the bond between the two layers,
and it is best suited to the measurement of thin
layers. This method appears to be well adapted
to measuring cladding thicknesses on solid-fuel-
element assemblies or on moderator assemblies.
It is also well adapted to measuring the thickness
of the outer layer of duplex tubing, such as might
be used in future heat exchangers and radiators,
provided the conductivities of the two layers are
sufficiently different. Both the total wall thick-
ness of the duplex tubing and condition of the
bond between the two loyers can be evaluated
by ultrasonic techniques.

RADIOGRAPHIC INSPECTION TECHNIQUES
R. B. Oliver W. J. Mason

The voltage ond current settings required for
radiographic inspection of various thicknesses of
Inconel, stainless steel, nickel-molybdenum, and
similar alloys are not available, and therefore a
program of compilation of such dato has been
initioted. Test weldments in %-in. Inconel sheet
are being radiographed through 8-in. of beryllium
to explore techniques for the inspection of the
closure welds of the ART fuel-ornulus core shells.
Beryllium, an element of low atomic number,
causes excessive scatter of the incident x-ray.
The scatter reduces image contrast and shorpness
so excessively that the radiograph is not capoble
of revealing any but gross defects. Higher x-ray
energies are being explored, but the reduction of
image increasing energy appears
to nearly offset ony reduction of scattered photons
that might be expected.

Shortly after the Pratt & Whitney high-temperature
critical assembly was looded with barren fuel-
carrier salt, o leak wos detected in the sump tank.
The insulation was removed and the source of
the leakage was found to be severe cracks in the
6-in.-dia cap which had been welded to the bottom
of the tank as a catch basin. Since such cracking

surmised that the cap hod been machined from

that forged pipe caps were not immediately avail
able and that o cap machined from ber stock had
been used. The cap was removed and o forged
cop wos welded to the tank.

Examination of Calrods attached to the tank
revealed that they were glazed with salt-vapor
deposits, and therefore all bottom and side Calrods
were removed, the tank was cleaned extesnally,
and new Calrods were installed.

Visual examination of the faulty cap showed
separate cracks which penetrated through
the cap. Examples of the cracks are shown in
Figs. 3.6.8 and 3.6.9, which are outer ond inner

As moy be seen the cracks run to the weld and
stop, and thus it is apparent thot they were in the
cap before it was installed on the tank. X-ray

less time was required to realign the incident
beam. Another aid in increasing the inspection
rate is the use of the B-scan, which displays the
signal received as an instantaneous cross section
through the plate being inspected. This permits
an increase in linear speed of the transducer from
approximately 10 to 25 fpm.

In general, it appears that for plate of average
quality, inspected from either face, the inspection
cate will be about 10 ft2 per shift. This of course
allows for all the downtime necessary for setup
and may increase or decrease with plate quality;
also, on increase in the inspection rote might be
expected with larger areas.

The rate of rejection increased slightly during
the quorter, ond three prime criteria for rejection
were established: (1) the detection of a dis-
continuity which produces a signal comparable
to or greater than that from o standard %-in.
flot-bottom hole; (2) the presence of smaller dis-
continuities with their centers nearer than 1 in.
to each other; and (3) excessive ultrasonic atten-
uation, which may be due fo porosity or precipitates
within the plate.

Typical Intergranular Attack, Fissures, and Rough Inner Surface of As-Received Hastelloy B

Boryllium Hot Prossings

R. W. McClung R. B. Oliver J. W. Allen

One of the six, forge, beryllium hot-pressings
fabricated by The Brush Beryllium Co., Cleveland,
Ohio, was ultrasonically inspected at ORNL.
Previously, three of these items had been in-
spected at the producer's plant. However, it was
felt that ¢ more methodical, complete ultrasonic
examination under [aboratory conditions by several
different techniques {some of which could not be
used at the Brush facility) was needed as o check
on techniques which were previously used in the
field.

The instrument used for the inspection at ORNL
was a Curtiss-Wright 424A Immerscope with o
Y-in-dia Li,SO, high-resolution transducer. An
attenuation curve was plotted which demonstrates
the comparative signal strength as received from
a constant-size discontinuity when seen through
varying thicknesses of beryllium, Fig. 3.6.14.
The instrument was calibrated for all the in-
spections by using a %-in. flat-bottom hole and
applying its presented signal to the appropriate

relative size of any defect could be approximated
by comparing its signal with that of the standard
ond by using the attenuation curve. The general
shape of a hot-pressed beryllium piece is shown
in Fig. 3.6.15; however, the contours and di-
mensions varied from piece to piece.

The section denoted A was inspected completely
by three different pulse-echo ultresonic techniques.
The first was a simple immersed method in which
the hot pressing wos completely immersed in a
tank of water and the surface was scanned in a
finer fashion with o Yin. index between suc-
cessive scans. Three smali discontinuities were
located which were estimated to be less than the
rejectable size. For the second inspection the
colyma-coupled, gimbal-mounted mechanism? illus-
trated in Fig. 3.6.16 wos used. Section A was
scanned in a series of overlapping circular scans;
however, the part was still completely immersed
and this technique merely gave comparative in-
formation. The inspection results were identical
with those obtained by the conventional immersed
technique. For the third inspection the gimbal
mounting, the circular scan, and also the column-
coupled ‘‘squirter’” principle were used. More

spurious signals were noted in the third in-
spection, but the results were equivolent to those
obtained by the other two techniques.

The sloping section, B, wos inspected with the
squirter technique, the transducer being aligned
so that the refracted ultrasound beom was per-
pendiculor to the bottom surfoce. In this portion
of the inspection, one discontinuity that was larger
than the standard hole was located, but it was in
o region that was to be removed by subsequent
mochining and thus was not cause for rejection.

The hot pressing was also inspected completely
by measuring the variation in ultrasonic at-
tenuation throughout its volume.
sistency of back reflections obtained, the pressing
seemed to be quite homogeneous. Since no
rejectable defects were located which would
not be removed by subsequent machining, the
piece was considered to be acceptable.

In oddition to the welds listed in Table 3.6.3,
115 C-type welds on piping manifolds for the

were removed, and the results of these measure-

were taken of Yin, intervals along the length of
the can, and two series of readings were taken
90-deg aport, The slugs were arbitrarily numbered
1, 2, 3, and 4, with slug 1 being closest to the
reactor and slug 4 being farthest from the reactor
during irradiation,

An attempt was made to remove the BeO slugs
with the use of a remotely controlled lathe, Siugs
3 and 4 were removed in this manner, but they
were damoged slightly by the lathe tool while the
can was being machined away. Figures 4.1.7,
4.1.8, and 4.1.9 show the condition of the slugs
removed on the lathe as compared with a similar
slug of unirradiated BeO. It was therefore de-
cided to remove the remaining two slugs by using
the remote milling machine. A portion of the cap
on the remaining half of the can was cut off with
an abrasive cut-off wheel to remove the brace
which secured the cop to the can, and the open end
of the can was trimmed on the cut-off machine,
Successive cuts were then made with a milling

until the BeO slug surface was exposed and the
con sprang open. The slugs were then easily
removed from the open con. Slugs 1 and 2, which

Apparatus for Stress-Rupture Tests of Tubing
in the MTR

Effort has been concentrated recently on com-
pleting apparatus for MTR in-pile tests of the
stress-rupture properties of Inconei tubing. Diffi-
culty was encountered in the ossembly of the

30n assignment from Pratt & Whitney Aircraft,

apparatus in that the pure helium atmosphere be-
came contaminated by insulating and constructional
materials, and the assembly work during the finol
stages was necessarily slow because the size
and complexity of the apparatus limited the number
of people who could work at one time.

The general design of the apparatus was described
previously,® and the nearly assembled specimen
chamber, a sample specimen, and a specimen fur-
nace are shown in Fig. 4.1.15. An end plate and a
water jacket will be welded on in order to complete
the specimen chamber. Water and boral will be
used os shielding in the plug. Each specimen is
a section of 3.8-in, sched-40 Inconel pipe machined
down to a wall thickness of 0.030 to 0.050 in.
over the gage length, and each specimen is pro-
vided with three thermocouples for temperature
measurement or control. A 4 .-in.-OD capillary
will supply gas pressure (to supply the stress) to
each specimen.

Each of the eight specimen furnaces has three
windings. A rheostat in series with each of
the 24 separate furnace windings permits separate
control,
“'G" oir controllers with pneumatically driven
Variacs) control the temperature in three zones
corresponding to the front end (the end closest to
the reactor), the middle, and the back end of the
specimen. This system is necessary becouse of
the gammo-ray heoting gradient ia the MTR. The
only alternative would have been the use of 24
coatrotlers or 8 controllers and a system of furnace
shunts that would be controlled by reoctor power.

leads {copper} were insulated with a total length
of 12 ft of ceramic insulotion,

Four racks of power and thermocouple instrumen-
tation and the connecting cables were completed,
and an ovailoble safety circuit was adapted for
use with this apparatus, A rack of helium pressure
control circuits, including 8 pressure recorders to
monitor specimen pressures (ond thus stresses),
was designed, built, and leak tested.

Duplicate specimens are to be tested out-of-pile
ot stresses of 2000, 3000, and 4000 psi at 1500°F,
The in-pile apparatus will probably be installed
in the MTR during March 1957,

Tube-Burst Tests in the LITR

Two tube-burst stress-rupture tests of Inconel
tubing in a helium atmosphere were completed in

the LITR. The thermal and fast (> 1 Mev) neutron
fluxes in hole HB-3 where these tests were con
ducted are both on the order of 6 x 1012 n/cm2 sec,
Rupture times for the 0.010-in.-wall Inconel tubing
(ART stock) at 2000 psi and 1500°F were 1050 and
1650 hr and thus were in good agreement with out-
of-pile data obtained in on argon atmosphere,’
The specimens in corresponding out-af-pile fests
in a helium atmosphere have passed 1770 hr with-
out rupture, A third in-pile specimen, stressed to
1000 psi ot 1500°F, did not rupture ia 1670 hr,
and the total creep deformation will be measured
upon disassembly of the opparotus.

An unstressed Inconel tube was exposed in the
LITR (HB-3) with nitrogen inside to determine
whether radiotion-induced nitriding would occur,
This specimen was also in a temperature gradient

Two irradiated and two control capsules were
opened and analyzed metallographically, and fuel
samples were submitted for chemical analysis.
The operational histories and the results of metallo-
graphic analyses’ of the capsules are given in
Table 4.1.3. In this series of tests only two
capsules, Nos. 247 and 248, constituted a matched
pair, that is, an irradiated capsule ond an identical
heat treated but not irradiated copsule. As may be
seen in Figs. 4.1.16 ond 4.1.17, the attack was
of about the same intensity in both capsules, The
depth of penetration was so minute, however, in
both cases, that it may be confused with surface
faults and perhops can be considered to be negli-
gible.

Capsule 276 showed (Fig. 4.1.18) corrosive
attack and subsurface voids to a depth of 5 mils.
The area of maximum penetration was near the
mid-point of the copsule, and the distribution of
the attack tapered slightly toward the ends. This
distribution of the attack was anticipated on the
basis of the temperature profile of the capsule.
The appearance of the affected areas in this cap-
sule indicates that the corrosion attack is real
and considerable; however, the contribution by
control

irradiation cannot be ascertained until

data and chemical analyses of the fuel are avail-
able. Capsule 264 (Fig. 4.1.19) will be compared
with its irradiated counterpart in a latter report.

The excellent temperature control achieved with
the capsule control system at the MTR is indicated
in Table 4.2.3. Capsule 247 experienced only one
temperature excursion, which was 32°F above the
set point for less than | min in an operating period
of 676 hr through 16 reactor shutdowns, Capsule
276 was operated for 235 hr with no excursions
greater than 10°F above the set point.

Details of the plating of Hastelloy B corrosion
capsules with nickel and chromium by electro-
deposition were reported previously.’

Other methods of applying nickel and chromium
coatings are being studied in an attempt to improve
the yield of successful coatings. Deposition of
nickel coatings by the ‘electroless’ method
appears to be promising. A nickel salt is reduced
by sodium hypophosphite and deposited on the
surface of the metol fo be coated. The metal
surface does not enter into the reaction. Nickel
deposited by this method is uniform in thickness
on all surfaces, and the plate is reported to be
relatively nonporous.'® This method is superior
to electrodeposition in that articles of irregular
shape receive uniform deposits.

The deposition of chromium by vacuum metalizing
is also being studied. In this method chromium
metal is vaporized from a tungsten filament, under
vacuum, and deposited on the metal surface to be
plated!’ It is difficult to plate articles of irregular

as might be the case with an electroplate, and
thus a large percentage of the coated specimens
should survive high-temperature exposure to air,

Tests specimens of Hastelloy B have been nickel
plated by electrodeposition and then chromium
plated by vacuum metalizing, Other specimens
have been nickel plated by the ‘‘electroless’
method ond then chromium plated by vocuum
metalizing. These specimens were then heated to
815°C in a muffle furnace and cooled to room
temperature daily to study the characteristics of
the oxide film, The preliminary results are promis-

Out-of-Pile Test of Pump for LITR Vertical Loop

Operation of the full-size pump designed for cir-
culating fused-salt fuel in the vertical in-pile loop,
which was started in an out-of-pile test loop during
the previous quarter,'? was terminated after
3525.5 hr at 1570°F with NaF-ZrF UF, (50-46-4
mole %, fuel 30), The pump was stopped for re-
pairs to the cooling coils which had been over-
heated when o water main broke and interrupted
the water supply. The pump could not be restarted,
presumably because the overheating had domaged
the bearings.

The pump wos therefore cut open for examination
and is shown in Figs. 4.1.22, 4.1.23, and 4.1.24.
The design of this canned-rotor pump may be seen

Every surface on the fuel side of this baffle should
be above the vapor-deposition temperature. This
temperature is about 1370°F for fuel 30 at 1570°F
(ref 13). The vapor-deposition isotherm, shown in
Fig. 4.1.22, wos deduced fom the location of
vapor deposits in the pump, and if is approximately
of the design point. The small amount of vapor
which diffuses through the baffle is spread over
the large surface provided for that purpose above
the isotherm and below the lower bearing. Heavy
local deposits which could stop the shaft after
short running times are thus avoided.

The distribution of vapor deposits is shown in
4.1.23 and 4.1.24. The spongy masses
above the baffle are fine needle crystals, loosely
clustered, that resemble hoarfrost, These de-
posits did not touch the shaft or the baffle. The
deposit just below the bearing was obout as hard
as cholk and about Ye in. thick. The deposit ot
the top of the fuel chamber was quite dense and
hard. The growing surface had reached an equilib
rium position where its temperature was just egual
fo the vapor deposition temperature, No vapor

no scratch marks could be seen on the two facing
surfaces of the shaft and baffle. Hydrodynamic

performance tests, thermal mockup tests, ond
bearing tests of this pump were described pre-
viously.’ ¢

Examination of the furnaces used in this bench
tess, which were identical with the furnaces to be
used in-pile, showed several points where foreign
materiols deposited and caused sections of the
furnace to burn out. Analyses of these deposits
showed them to be from soft solder and flux used
in the ottempted emergency repair of the cooling
coils. No traces of other construction moterials
were found in these deposits.

Irradiation Facilities in Oak Ridge Research
Reactor

In cooperation with the ORNL Operations and
the Engineering and Mechanical Divisions, facili-
ties are being plonned for the future operation of
a miniature corrosion-testing loop in the Oak Ridge
Research Reactor (ORR). The routing of insiru-
ment and power leads, locations of off-gas lines
and carbon traps, location of the motor-generator
set, location of a fail-safe nitrogen supply, and
design of the reactor vessel flange seal for the
Jeads are being worked out. A new control panel,
to be located in a third floor laboratory in the ORR
building, is being designed by the Instrument
Department.

INVESTIGATION OF SULFUR CONTAMINATION
OF A DRY BOX BY NEOPRENE RUBBER

W. E. Browning
R. E. Adams H. L. Hemphill

During preparations for filling the vertical in-pile
loop, it was discovered that, while under vacuum,
the interior of the dry box was contaminated by an
unknown gaseous sulfur compound, The presence
of the contaminant was monifested by the appear-
ance of a Cu,S film on the copper-cooling coils of
the loop assembly. The Cu,S film was identified
by chemical analysis and x-ray diffeaction.

The vorious lubricants and oils used in the
vacuum system and loop assembly were therefore
analyzed for sulfur, and the concentrations of the
sulfur found ranged from less than 10 to 92 ppm.
These quantities are to be expected in pump oils
and lubricants, Tests of the foop assembly elimi-
nated it as a source of the sulfur contaminant,
The helium supply was also investigated for sulfur
contamination by bubbling the helium through a
silver nitrate solution. No evidence of a silver
sulfide precipitate was noted.

Access to the interior of the dry box is provided
by Neoprene rubber gloves. A glove and a copper

specimen were enclosed in a vacuum system inde-
pendent of the dry box, and after several hours
under vacuum Cu,$ was found on the copper
surfaces. This indicated thot the sulfur contami-
nont was present in the Neoprene rubber and was

sulfides are used as a plasticizing agent.

The Inconel surfaces of the loop assembly were
investigated by electron diffraction, Samples of
the surface film were removed from the loop motor
assembly which had been exposed to the contami-
nated dry-box atmosphere, Similar samples were
removed from another motor assembly which had an
identical history except for exposure in the dry
box. These surface samples were removed by the
lacquer-stripping technique used in preparing rep-
The samples were
found to be identical, and crystalline sulfides of
nickel, iron, and chromium that were sought were
not found.

tent was found to be below the limit of measure
ment (20 ppm S) of the analytical method being
used, Since the loop surfaces and the fluoride
fuel revealed no sulfur contamination, the filling
operation was completed and the loop was removed
from the dry box.

In the case described the quantity of sulfur com-
pounds present was not considered to be harmful,

licas for electron microscopy.

In both cases the sulfur con-

but elimination of contominonts would be desirable,
and various methods are being studied, The ovail-
able sulfur content of the gloves might be removed
by chemical treatment without changing the physical
characteristics of the gloves, and, although diffi-
cult, the Neoprene gloves might be replaced vith
gloves of another suitable material.

irradiation that was significantly greater than the
increase noted in the examination of samples 4, 5,
and 6, The copper cladding and the core of the
specimen showed no significant changes in hord-
ness. Although the center of the core decreased
in hardness, it is felt thot this was the result of
the severe cracking, which could cause erroneous
measurements.

The ends ond sides of specimens 1, 2, and 3 are
shown in Fig. 4.1.28. The core cracking and the
core~cladding separation apparent in all specimens
varied in degree from specimen to specimen. Specie
men 2 was selected for metailographic examination,
and typical sections of the core are shown in Fig.
4.1,29. The particular area shown in Fig. 4.1.29
gives no evidence of cracking or porosity of either
the boron carbide particles or the copper matrix
material. However, as the etched photomicrograph
shows, the etching revealed a heavily attacked
area immediately adjacent fo the B,C particles.
In addition the structure of the copper matrix
appears to be somewhat disturbed when compared
with the structures obtained in irradiated specimens
4, 5, and 6, Both these conditions were noted
throughout repeated polishing and etching,

Longitudinal cracks were found in the core at
both ends of the specimens, which usually started
at the center of the core and progressed approxi-
mately one-fourth the length of the specimen, A
typical crack is shown in Fig. 4.1.30, and the
intergranular attack in the vicinity of the crack is
shown in Fig. 4.1.31,

Significant core-cladding seperation was found,
as shown in Fig. 4.1.32. It is interesting to note
that no evidence of separation was found at the
stainless-stee|-to-copper interface. Occasional
large voids and partial intergranular separation
were noted in the grain boundaries of the copper
cladding, aos shown in Fig. 4.1.33, Examination
of the entire length of a specimen indicated that
the core-cladding seporation was approximately
70 to 80% complete.

FUSED SALT POLAROGRAPHY
R. J. Carter

The applicability of polarographic techniques to
the study of the fission-product chemistry of fused
salts is being investigated, The polarogroph which
is being used is similar to that used in aqueous

20

potarography; however, the high electrical con-
ductivity of the fused salts as compared with
aqueous solutions makes it impractical to vary
the potential applied to the polarographic cell
linearly with time. For this reason, current-voltage
curves are recorded with on X-Y recorder rather
than with a conventional strip-chart recorder.

Both silver and platinum microelectrodes of
various sizes and shapes are being tested for use
as cathodes. The platinum crucible which contains
the fused salf is used as the anode. The platinum
crucible is mounted in an Inconel container which
can be filled with helium in order to maintain a dry,
inert atmosphere around the fused salt. The neces-
sary electrical connections are mode by using
Kovar seals which are soldered into the laconel
can, Vertical movement of the microelectrode is
accomplished by mounting the electrode support
on a Hexible bellows.

In order fo test the equipment, current-voltage
curves were obtained at 350°C for several solu-
tions containing from 0.4 to 1.0 parts per thousand
of cadmium chloride dissolved in potossium nitrate.
Five or six current-voltage curves were obtained
for each solution, The reproducibility of the
curves was good in the initial portions but poor in
the diffusion-current region, where large fluctua-
tions in current were observed. The fluctuation of
the diffusion current has since been found to be
caused by vibration of the laboratory floor, and a
suitable means for shock mounting of the furnace
used to heat the fused salt is presently being
sought.

these diodes are commercial units, there is no
indication of the initial carrier concentration or the
initial mobility, Thus there is no reason to expect
that the maximum observed previously?’ would
occur at the same integroted exposure for a different
type of unit,

Upon removal from the gamma-ray source, the
change in I, indicated that an annealing process
was taking place in the bamier. As con be seen
from Fig. 4.1.38, recovery of the unit was not
complete, and the onnealing was not a simple
first-order process. The minimum in / after 125 hr
of annealing may be real.

The surface-leokage current, I, is obtained by
subtracting 7; from the reverse current measured at
a bias of 1 v. The value /, may thus be considered
to be the leakage conductance. The change in i,
os a function of exposure is shown in Fig, 4.1.39,
It con be seen that 1, saturates after a rapid initial
increase of about one order of magnitude. This
saturation may indicate that the depth of surface
attack is limited.

The annealing of I, upon removal from the gamma-
ray source, shown in Fig, 4.1.40, is complicated,
as it was in the case of {,. A definite minimum
can be seen at about 40 hr. The fact that annealing
occurs indicates that the surface leakage is not
caused by simple chemical attack alone. Since a
commercial unit is being studied, it is not practical

trends in behavior can be established by using
commercial units, but the quentitative date neces-
sary for reliable interpretation of the effects will
require the use of ingots or samples specifically
prepared for such on investigation. In particular,

A Safe for Removal of Samples from the Reactor

The removal of somples from the ORNL Graphite
Reactor subjects the personnel engaged in the work
to beta and gamma irradiation from the activated
material being removed and to contamination by
the radioactive dust associated with the decay of
msulation. This problem is particularly acute
when samples must be removed from the reactor
loading face, As a first step in solution of this
problem, o sample removal safe was designed,
Fig. 4.1.43. The sofe can be handled by two men,
and yet it is thick enough to provide odequate
shielding for the levels of activity normally en-
countered. All access facilities can be operated
by one man. The device can be used either at the
reactor loading face, or, by transferring to another
dolly, at holes 50, 51, and 52. Provision hos been
made Sor vacuum removal of radiooctive dust ond

Madifications to Hole 30 of the ORNL
Graphite Reactor

In order for measurements to be made on semi-
conductor components under irradiation, the ex-
posures must be conducted at flux levels one to
two orders of magnitude lower than those found in
the central region of the ORNL Graphite Reactor,
Unless such low flux levels are used, the measure-
ments cannot be made in o time interval that is
short compared with the fime interval which pro-
duces o significant chonge in the parameters being
measured.

If exposures are conducted in hole 51, where a
fission spectrum, a removal facility, and provisions
for instrumentation are available, the reactor must
be operated at power levels between 50 and 400 kw.
The time available for such operation is limited
and the reproducibility of flux levels is difficult.
Exposure near the periphery of the reactor couses
a positioning problem and provides an undesirable
ratio of thermal to fast flux,

ln order to eliminate these disadvantages and to
supply several advantageous features, an exposure
device has been designed for use in hole 30N of
the Graphite Reactor, as shown in Fig. 4.1.44, The
device consists of a cart which may be moved from
a loading shield at the reactor shield face to a
fission chamber located inside hole 30N, The sam-
ple can be moved from the external shield to the
irradiation position in about 10 sec.

The fission chamber position may be adjusted to
give o range of flux levels. The external shield is
designed to facilitate removal of the fission
chamber should such action become necessary.

the basis of the change in attenuation observed?
in polyethylene cable measured at 4 mc and the
results shown in Fig. 4.1.45, it seems clear that
the loss tangent of irradiated polyethylene has a
maximum in the frequency range between 4 and
800 mc, Such a maximum probably exists also for
Teflon. Measurements in this frequency range are
needed to substantiate these conclusions.

Any chonges in the dielectric constants of the
five materials studied are less than the error of
measurement, Since the limit of accuracy of the
present meosurements of dielectric constants is
5%, changes smaller than this value would not be
observed. In the case of Teflon there is a con-
sistent trend in the data which suggests that a

Evidence has been obtained, however, that the

contained in a graphite reactor. A nifrogen at-

this test the sulfur concentrates in the nickel

at about 100:1. A major portion of the S-mil foil
is available for sulfur penetration in o few hours
in this test if a diffusion rate of 0.4 mil/hr is
assumed. |

A 2-hr test of foil at 600°C in a solt mixture
containing 100 ppm of sulfur os Na,SO, resulted
in essentially complete loss of mechanical strength,
and the foil broke under very slight stress. The
embrittlement became progressively less as the
sulfur concentration was decreased to 1 ppm.
When no sulfur was added to the salt, o foil im-
18 hr retained its mechanical strength,
but there was evidence of some embrittlement
at the salt-vopor interface.

taining 100 ppm of sulfur resulted in almost ne

servations that some types of nickel alloys are
more resistant than pure nickel to the sulfur
effect.

A comparative test

The effect of sulfur on nickel is believed so
be dependent an the initial chemical state of the
sulfur and its subsequent reactions, as well as
on the rate of diffusion of sulfur or nickel sulfide
through the metal. Comparative time studies
indicate thot in the case of Na,S0,, 1 to 4 hr
is required for moderately complete reaction.
This was confirmed by studying the behavior of
tracer $3% in an experiment in which a totol of
15 ppm of sulfur was added to the salt mixture.
The disappearance of the $3° activity wos 90%
complete in 2 hr. Less thon 5% of the sulfur that
disappeared was found in the walls of the nickel
capsule, and thus it appears that only a small
part of the sulfur present in the fused salt actuolly
causes the embrittling effect. A sulfur material

278

balonce experiment with an Inconel capsule also
showed that only a fraction of the sulfur actually
transferred from the salt to the metal. With 100
ppm of sulfur in NoF-ZrF at 600°C and a salt-to-
metal ratio of 160:1, the sulfur actually found in
the Inconel after a 4-hr exposure accounted for
only 3% of the sulfur in the original salt mixture.
The sulfur content of the Inconel increased from
less than 130 ppm to more than 630 ppm, as
determined by activation analyses.

The tests consisted in holding comosion speci-

type of NaF obtained from Allied Chemical & Dye

an over-all porosity of 35 instead of 65%. The
over-all porosity is defined os the percentage of
total void space (bed voids plus particle voids)
in o bed of the material. The porosities were
colculated from determinations of the bulk densities
and the particle densities as given in Table 4.2.2,
along with the use of the crystolline or x-ray
density of 2.79 g/cm’. Weight-volume and dis-
placement methods of measuring density were
used in determining both the bulk and the particle
densities of the J-in. pellet material. Mercury

RUTHENIUM DECONTAMINATION

not particularly effective in removing activity
from the UF; product collected. The decontam-
ination factor, calculated on the basis of the
activities found in the nickel! column ond in the
final product, was only 1.6. The activity in the
nickel packing was removed with an alkaline-
tartrate-peroxide solution, and the effectiveness
of this method has not been fully evaluated. About
0.025% of the processed uranium was found in
the nickel trap.

The low ruthenium decontamination in the nickel
trap is perhaps not too surprising in view of the
small amount of activity involved and the small
surface area used. The product contained only
28 ruthenium gamma counts per minute per mil-
ligram of uranium. The activity removed by the
nickel was calculated to be 200 counts per minute
per square centimeter of nickel surface. It is
anticipated that the removal of ruthenium with
a nickel column moy be made more effective by
using a greater surface area or by operating at
a higher temperature.

Oracle code based on Monte Corlo techniques have
been published at intervals? during the past year.
A topicol report is now being prepared which will

tions.3 In addition, the results of all the colcula-
tions are being collected in a separate report con-

summary of the various types of problems is pre-
sented here, along with corresponding references
to the data.

The summary {Table 5.2.1) designates the ma-
terials, thicknesses, gamma-ray energies, and
angles of incidence investigated. For oll the
problems the information obtained directly from the
machine calculations includes dose rate, energy
flux, and energy deposition; for some problems it
also includes energy spectra. Dose- and energy-
buildbp “factors, as well as heating in the shield,
may be computed directly from the information, and
in some cases they have been. In the compilation
of data? comparisons of the shield attenuations
are also made.

Two studies, which have been designated the
CE137 and COBS0 series, respectively, were
carried out to determine the penetration of Cs!37

a doubling technique wos used which tends to

In this way statistics were obtained near the final
boundary for which excessively large

nique hod not been used. The transmitted and
reflected energy spectra from this study have been
stored in o systematic order on magnetic tope and
are available for calculations. The energy spectra

vals) for both the reflected and the transmitted

5.3. LID TANK SHIELDING FACILITY

NEW INSTRUMENT CARRIAGE AT THE LTSF
W. Zobel

The necessity of taking progressively more pre-
cise data ot the Lid Tank Shielding Facility (LTSF)
made it obvious thot one of the uncertainties which
had to be eliminated was that associated with the
location of the detectors, While the position of a
detector in the tank could be reproduced to within
about £2 mm, the absolute position was open to
doubt within about +5 mm, It was therefore de-
cided fo replace the detector holder and positioner.

The new equipment was required to be more
rigid thon the old so that the absolute position and
the indicated position would always coincide, and
it had to have an inherent accuracy of about £0.5 mm.
The system (Fig. 5.3.1) which wos adopted is very
similar to that in use at the Tower Shielding
Focility (TSF). This system provides for remote
control of the carriage from the control room and
thereby greotly increases the ease of operation,
The new instrument carriage has been installed
ond is now in use. It appears to give very satis-
factory service, and it is expected that the con-
fidence level of future data taken at the LTSF will
be increased.

The detector carriage is driven in the y-direction
by two ball-bearing lead screws which, however,
do not support the carriage. Thus greater accuracy
and longer life can be obtained. The use of the
ball-bearing nut eliminotes backlash. The load
is carried on the channel base, which con be made
as strong as required, A guide rail on one side
assures that the carriage will run true,

In the z-direction the load is supported by two
large shafts, which also serve os guides. The

The drive in the x-direction is of the rack-and-
pinion type, with the rack cut into the vertical
This is a large tube ond was chosen
to provide sufficient rigidity for the holder.

Control of the drive motors in the three directions
is manual at present. The position of the detector
support, located at the end of the vertical shaft,
is indicated of three panels in the control room.
Two indicators are provided for each direction.
One is a dial for coarse control, driven by a torque

other is a fine control, indicated by an Amerac

dial, which uses a selsyn system to drive the diol
by the usuol null technique. The indication of
the fine control is to the nearest millimeter, with
interpolation on the dial to 0.5 mm eosily possible.
Provision has been made to permit later conversion
of the controls to a closed-loop system by which
the desired position on the detector can be selected
and the corrioge will then ‘hunt’! until it reaches
that location, Provision is also made for future
installation of a readout system for vse with an
isodose plotter,

Preliminory tests showed that the instrument
carriage, as finally constructed does not deviate
from a given plane by more than 0.006 in. over the
full range of the water tank at the LTSF. This
indicates that the absolute position of an instru-
ment can be determined to at least +0.5 mm and is,
at present, limited by the accuracy with which the
indicators can be read. Jt is felt, however, that
10.5 mm is sufficiently accurate for the purpose,
and therefore no changes are contemplated,

INVESTIGATION OF THE PHYSICAL
PROPERTIES OF LITHIUM BOROHYDRIDE-
AMMONIA UNDER SUBCONTRACT NO. 390

E. A, Sullivan S$. Johnson
Metal Hydrides, lac.

One of the materials which has been suggested
as a neutron shield for a mobile reactor is lithium
borohydride. This relatively new compound is
particularly attractive because it contains 18.5 wt %
hydrogen, which is the most efficient lightweight
neutron absorber known, as well as lithium and
boron, both of which suppress secondary gammo
radiation arising from neutron capture by the shield
material, in oddition to being good neutron ab-
sorbers, Lithium borohydride is a white crystalline
solid which is stable to its melting point of 275°C
ard has essentiolly no vapor pressure even ot this
elevated temperature, In on attempt to achieve a
liquid shield which could be cooled externally and
would avoid difficult fabrication problems, empha-
sis has been altered to consider shield components
utilizing this compound in combination with an
inexpensive diluent that would aot change the
shielding properties appreciably. Ammonia, which
contains 17.8 wt % hydrogen, is ideally suited for
this purpose. Since the physical properties of

Pressuvre-Temperature-Compos ition Relationships

The ammonia vapor pressure in equilibrium with
mixtures of lithium borohydride and ammonia was
determined os a function of concentration ond of
temperature, The lithium borohydride mole frac-
tions used ranged from 1.0 to slightly less than
0.2 in the temperature range 0 to 80°C. Lithium
borohydride forms four stable adducts with ammonia:
litnium borohydride monoammoniate, LiBH NH,
which has a melting point of 56.5°C; lithium boro-
hydride diammoniate, LiBH +2NH,, which melts
ot 17.0°C; lithium borohydride triommoniate,
LiBH -3NH,, which displays on incongruent
melting point of 32.5°C; and lithium borohydride
tetraammoniate, LiBH ,-4NH ,, which melts ot
approximately 68°C,

The phase diagram in this temperature range has
been constructed from the experimental dato, The

Where necessary {at temperatures 40°C), small
corrections were made in the equilibrium data to
account for the effect of ammonalysis on the com-
position of the samples. When precautions were
taken, this reaction did not interfere with equilib
rium measurements,

Density Relotionships

The densities of liquid lithium borohydride
ammoniates were determined as a function of both
composition and temperature. Five conditions
between LiBH, 1.06NH, and LiBH,-2.74NH , were
studied. The temperature range in which each
composition was studied depended on the liquidus
temperature at the given composition and on the
vapor pressure encountered. Two of the composi-
tions studied, LiBH -1.73NH, and LiBH ;-2.36NH,,
correspond to the eutectics on either side of the
diammoniate of lithium borohydride,
positions hove the lowest liquidus temperatures
in the entire phase diagrom, both ot 15°C, and
therefore have the longest temperature ronges for
the liquid state. ln general, the study encompassed
temperature ranges between 15 and 85°C.

The density for a given composition was found to
be a linear function of temperature, os expected,

SURVEY OF SHIELDING MATERIALS UNDER
SUBCONTRACT NO, 931

R. Aronson K. Held
Technical Research Group

A recent survey of shielding materials confirms
that lithium hydride and polyethylene are the most
effective neutron shields known to dote. Lithium
hydride is by for the best solid shield material in
curved geometries. The use of LiSH is expected
to lead to a further weight savings of approximately
12%. Lithium hydride is the only lightweight neu-
tron shield material which can be used in the range
of 700 to 1200°F without developing high pressure
or decomposing. This is the range of temperature
which may be expected in some parts of the direct
cycle reactor shield. Neutron shield materials for
use at temperatures above 2000°F may be required
for the direct-cycle reactor, Reactor outlet air at

5.4. TOWER SHIELDING REACTOR Il

C. E. Clifford

As was stated previously, a reactor which will
have a higher and more uniform fast-neutron and
gamma-ray leakage flux than that ovailoble with
the present Tower Shielding Reactor is needed for
future aircraft shielding experimentation. To fill
these requirements a 5-Mw solid-fuel Tower
Shielding Reactor Il (TSR-11} has been proposed
which will be spherical in shape. The TSR-II will
be controlled by umbrella-shaped boron-loaded
plates located in an interna! water reflector, in
which position they will give o minimum perturba-
tion to the reactor leakage flux.

In order to establish the dimensions of a core
configuration that would fit the requirements of
the reactor, the following cal culational procedures
were followed. A nuclear porometer study was
carried out first to determine the critical mass
and control available for various core sizes,
internal water reflector thicknesses, and aluminum-
to-water volume ratios. From this study o configu-
ration was selected which appeared to be the
optimum configuration from the viewpoint of critical
mass ond small reactor diameter. This configuration
was then examined to ensure that the surface
density of the U23% in the fuel plates would be
below 0.0283 g/cm?, o density which was estab-
lished during operating experience with the MTR.2
Finally the configuration was exomined to deter-
mine whether the water flow available fo remove
the heot from the core was sufficient to prevent
local boiling. The results of these tests are
presented below.

the cores ranged from 0.250 to 2.000. All possible
reflector-core combinations were investigated for
each oluminum-to-water ratio, For the calculations
the external water reflector was considered to be

for this reactor showed that 4% excess reactivity

below the ratio of 0.7 used in the BSF reactor.*
Also, if this ratio is used the standard arrangement
of 60-mil-thick fuel plotes separated by 120 mils
of water can be used. Since the amount of control
available increases with a decrease in core thick-
ness, an approximately 14-cm core thickness
{5.5 in.) appears to be the optimum. This thin
core, which requires less thon 6.5 kg of UZ3% for
criticality, will also be an advantage with respect
to the heat removal problem (see below).

The configuration having a 17.5-in.-dia internal
water reflector and 5.5-in.-thick core region wos
then examined to ensure that the U?3% fuel plate
loading would not exceed the 0.0283 g/cm? surface
density previously designoted. Jt wos found thet
the maximum loading possible for this surface
density wos 9.5 kg. This allows for an error in

Oracle calculations to be as high as 45%. The

HEAT REMOVAL STUDY

The heat flux from the fuel plates will be approxi-
mately 5 x 10 Btu/ft2.hr. To remove this heat o
two-pass cooling system hos been proposed. It
was previously determined® that a 1000-gom flow
rate with a 40°F temperature rise of the water over
the inlet water temperature would provide sufficient
cooling to prevent boiling or excessive fuel plate
temperatures in o reactor core with higher alumi-

It is felt that if
turbulent water flow could be maintained in each
channel, adequate cooling could still be achieved
with the 1000-gpm flow rate. Using o log meon
flow oreo and essuming equal How per channel,
the Reynolds number was calculated ond found to
vary from 11,000 in the inner channels to 8500 in
the outer channel. It appears, therefore, that
sufficient latitude will exist over which to adjust
flow rates to obtain uniform outlet temperatures
and still maintain turbutent How.

ratio is somewhat detrimental.

FUTURE STUDIES

Preparations are being made for several develop-
ment experiments to further estoblish the TSR-It
design. Several controf system mockups consisting
of solid stainless steel plates, perforated stainless
steel plotes, or boron-loaded aluminum plates will
be tested in a 6-in.-square water-filled hole in the
center of the BSF reactor. A prototype of the
octual control design is olso being constructed
for other dynamic tests. In addition, the fuel
element drawings are now complete, and a model
will be fabricated to establish a heoder arrange-
ment for the cooling system.
