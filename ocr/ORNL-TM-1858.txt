SAFETY PROGRAM FOR MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTORS

Paul R. Kasten

I. INTRODUCTION

The purpose of this report is to discuss important aspects of
molten-salt breeder reactor plants which are related to the opera-
tional and ultimate safety of such systems, and to present a program
for investigating reactor characteristics and associated cost require-
ments. In order to be relatively specific, the Molten Salt Breeder
Reactor plant (MSBR) described in Ref. 1 forms the basis for this dis-
cussion. However, genersl studies which also consider other design
concepts will need to be performed; the general studies required will
come into better focus as MSER safety and design information is

developed.

Briefly, the MSBR design concept concerns a two-region, two-fluid
system with fuel salt separated from the blanket salt by graphite tubes.
Circulating-fuel temperatures are high (~1300°F), and reactor pressures
are low (~100 psi). The energy produced in the reactor fluid is trens-
ferred to a secondary coolant-salt circuit, which couples the reactor
to a supercritical steam cycle. The fuel salt consists of uranium
fluoride dissolved in a carrier salt containing a mixture of lithium
and beryllium fluorides, while the blanket salt contains thorium fluo-
ride dissolved in a similar carrier salt. The blanket salt also cir-

culates through passages in the graphite moderator region of the core.

The coolant salt is a mixture of sodium fluoride and sodium fluoroborate.

Fuel processing is performed on-site, in a processing plant integral
with the reactor plant. Figure 1 gives a flowsheet of the 1000-Mw(e)
MSBR power plant, ‘while Figure 2 gives the associated processing flow-
sheet. Details of these flowsheets are discussed in References 1 and 2.
The safety of MSBR's has not as yet been investigated in detail;
however, it can be discussed in a qualitative manner, pointing out areas
and items which need to be investigated. The operating philosophy and

the organization for safety in MSBR power plants will have to satisfy \o
the licensing and regulatory requirements which exist; also, MSBR plants
must satisfactorily pass safety reviews, inspections, and testing.
Plant operations will have to be safe and efficient so that the health
and safety of plant personnel and that of the general public will not
be endangered, and so that the plant can operate economically on a long-
term basis. While it appears that the safety of MSBR systems can be’
assured at costs as low or lower than the safety-requirement costs of
other reactor power plants, a definitive evaluation cannot be made until
detailed safety studies have been performed.
In discussing MSBR safety, credible incidents which would normally
never occur must be considered. Plant systems involved are primarily
the reactor system, the supercritical-steam system, the fuel processing
system, and the off-gas system. These are discussed below relative to
their influence and function on reactor safety. Also, a discussion is
included of possible events which can be described qualitatively, but |
which need detailed investigation to be evaluated adequately. These o>
involve reactivity coefficients, control rod function, possible inci- v
dents, and reactor stability. Finally, a summary is given of the MSBR
safety program, along with estimates of the costs associated with re-

solving safety design questions.
2. MAJOR PLANT SYSTEMS INFLUENCING REACTOR SAFETY

The reactor system is the primary one of interest, but other systems
can also influence reactor behavior. For example, rupture of the super-
critical boiler-superheaters could lead to high pressures in the secondary
coolant system, which in turn could lead to rupture of the primary heat
exchanger if proper safeguards are not employed. Such a train of events
would influence the reactivity of the reactor core, and need to be con-
sidered relative to the adequacy of reactor plant containment.
Another plant system of importance is the fuel recycle system, since
it is integrated with the reactor plant and operates "on-line." This
operation could introduce reactivity changes into the reactor system. o

Also, the off-gas system is an important protective system relative to

the reference of radioactive gases from the plant site.
2.1. Reactor System

As considered here, the reactor system contains the reactor core,

the primary and secondary circulating-salt loops, and associated pumps

the heat transfer equipment. Important items in this system are indi-

cated in Figure 3.

The reactor vessel is housed in a circular cell of reinforced con-
crete, about 36-ft-diam by 42-ft-high. This volume also contains the four
fuel- and blanket-salt primary heat exchangers and their respective cir-
culating pumps.t The wall separating this cell from the adjoining cells
is h-ft-thick, and the removable bolt-dovn roof plugs total 8 f£t in

thickness. The pump drive shafts pass through stepped openings in the

special concrete roof plugs to the drive motors which are located in
sealed tanks pressurized above the reactor cell pressure. The control
rod drive mechanisms pass through the top shielding in a similar manner.
The coolant-salt pipes passing through the cell wall have bellows seals at
the penetrations. oo CL
The cell is lined with 1/4 to 1/2-in.-thick steel plate having

welded joints, which, together with the seal pan that forms a part of
the roof structure, provides a cell leak rate less than 1% (volume)
per 24k hr. The cell is heated to above 1050°F by radiant heating sur-
faces located at the bottom of the cell. The liner plate and the con-
crete structure are protected from high temperatures by 6 in. or more
of thermal insulation and by a heat removal system. The reactor and
heat exchanger support structures are cooled as required.

~ Thus, there are several barriers to protect against the escape of
radioactivity. The first is the primary reactor piping and equipment,
the second is the seal-welded containment vessel, and a third is the
reactor building proper which is maintained at a negative pressure by
ventilating fans which discharge through a stack-filter arrangement.
All penetrations into the reactor cell, such as those associated with
instrument, electrical, and service lines, are equipped with sealing

devices.

The four cooling-salt-circulating circuits are housed in individual
compartments having Y-ft-thick reinforced concrete walls and bolted-down,
removable roof plugs. Each compartment contains four boiler-superheaters,
two reheaters, one coolant-salt pump serving the boiler-superheaters, and
one coolant-salt pump supplying the reheaters. All piping passing into
these cells from the turbine plant has sealed penetrations and valving
located outside the walls. The coolant-salt pump drive shafts extend -
through the roof plugs and the cells are. sealed and heated in the same
menner as in the reactor cell. Normally the temperature need not be
maintained above T50°F, however. |

The secondary .coolant lines are maintained at a higher pressure than
the reactor system (about 200 psi, compared with ~100 psi in the reactor),
so that in the event of a primary heat exchanger tube failure, leakage of.
radioactive fuel salt into the secondary circuit will be minimized. Ordi-
narily, the activity of the coolant salt will be that due to N'® (formed
from the N,x reaction on fluorine and having a half life of T.4k sec) and

Ne®% (formed by an n,y reaction and having a half life of about 15 hr).

.In each case the neutron source for activation is the delayed neutron

emission in the primary heat exchanger.

The design pressure for the reactor cell and the four adjoining
compartments is expected to be about 45 psig. - Pressure-suppression
systems are provided, the reactor cell system being separate from the:
system used for the other compartments. These suppression systems would
contain water storage tanks so that vapors released into a cell would
pass through these tanks and be condensed, maintaining the cell pressure
below ‘the design value. Noncondensable gases would be contained until
they could be disposed of by passage through the off-gas system. When the
coolant salt is discharged into the water in the pressure suppression
system some HF will be produced. The quantity and the effects need to
be evaluated. Studies made for the MSRE suggest that corrosion of the
steel liners and tanks by the HF will not be a serious problem.

The fuel drain tanks maintain subcritical storage of the fuel and
also remove decay heat for maintaining proper fuel temperatures. Evapora-
tive cooling is provided. The coolant drain tenk is similar to the fuel

drain tank except no cooling is required. An inert cover gas system is

provided to protect the molten salt from oxygen and moisture at all
times. In order to keep stresses within equipment low, normal heating
and cooling of the reactor will be done slowly at rates of 100°F/hr or
less, applying temperature differences less than about 100°F. However,
the reactor system should withstand several severe thermal shocks (such
as a rapid fuel-salt temperature rise of about 4LOO°F) without breaching.

The homogeneous and fluid nature of molten-salt fuels permits ready
transport of material from one system to another.. From the viewpoint of
safety, it is important that the fissile fuel remain homogeneously distri-
buted in the carrier salt, This has been demonstrated repeatedly under
both nonirradiation and irradiation conditions; in addition, chemical
stability of the fuel salts improves with increasing temperature, a
favorable relation. Also, the fuel salt expands with increasing tempera-
ture, effectively leading to expulsion of fuel from the core region and
leading to a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity. Because of
the ease of fuel addition and removal, very little excess reactivity is
provided within the reactor during normal operating conditions. +

Fission gases are continuously removed from the reactor core on a
very short cycle time (less than one minute) by sparging the salt with
inert gas. Fuel processing takes place on about a 30-day cycle (for the
fuel salt), so that the fission product content of the reactor system
is always relatively low.

Since the fuel salt does not wet the container material or the moder-
ator, drainage of the fuel salt plus flushing the system with carrier
salt should remove & large fraction of the fission products from the
circulating-fuel system. The actual behavior will need to be studied
experimentally.

2.2. Steam System

The steam system is indicated in Figure 4 and consists of the
- coolant-salt heat exchangers, boiler feed pumps, feedwater heaters, the
turbine-generator, and associated equipment. The steam-power system
uses steam conditions of 3500 psia -- 1000°F/1000°F, which are repre-

sentative of modern steam power plant practice. The feedwater enters |

the boiler at TOO°F so that little or no freezing of the secondary \o/
coolant salt takes place.
The 16 boiler-superheaters consist of U-tube-U-shell heat exchangers,
which transfer heat from the 1125°F coolant salt to ‘the TOO°F feedwater
and generate steam at 1000°F and 3600 psia. Variable-speed, coolent-

{

salt pumps are used to permit control of the outlet steam temperature.
There are eight shell -and-tube heat exchangers which function as re-
- heaters and transfer heat from the coolant salt to 570 psia steam from
the high-pressure turbines exhaust, raising its temperature to 1000°F.
Reheat steam preheaters are used to heat this exhaust steam to about
600°F before it enters the reheaters. : .

The heat-exchange ‘equipment is located within containment cells
which communicate with the reactor cell by means of coolant-salt lines,
and with the turbine room by means of steam and water lines. In addi-
tion, these cells communicate with the fuel processing area by means of
small coolant-salt lines and with the control and service areas through
Penetrations for gas, cooling water, instrumentation lines, etc. These *
cells also communicate with a vapor suppression volume through a large |
conduit equipped with a rupture disc. The vapor-condensing system pro-
vides pressure control of the coolant-salt cell in the event of a rupture
of the steam or water circuits. Biological shielding is provided. for the
cells, and a controlled inert gas atmosphere is maintained. |

Molten salts do not undergo a significant chemical reaction with
water; however, high-temperature steam is produced when water contacts
molten salt. In order to provide for accidents producing steam, or for
leakage of high-pressure steam into the coolant-salt cells, a vapor-
suppression system is used to provide pressure relief, and maintain
pressures below the containment design value of about 45 psig. Auto-
matic block valves are provided in the steam lines to reduce the likell-
hood of draining the water in the steam system into these cells in the
event of a rupture.
To protect against high pressures in case of failure of a super-
heater tube in the heat exchanger, rupture discs are provided on the

shell side of the superheaters and reheaters for venting the coolant

system into the vapor condensing system. These rupture discs protect
against overpressure in the coolant-salt circuit and thus protect the
reactor system, which is separated from the coolant salt by the tube

walls of the primary heat exchanger.

2.3, Fuel Recycle Processing System

 

\ The flowsheet for the MSBR processing system has been given pre-
viously in Figure 2. ‘The core fuel is processed by the fluoride vol-
atility process to separate the uranium from the carrier salt and fission
products. The valuable carrier salt is separated from the rare-earth
fission products by the vacuum-distillation process. The fuel salt is
reconstituted by absorbing UFs in uranium-containing carrier salt,
followed by reduction in the liquid phase by bubbling hydrogen through
the melt. Excess uranium from the reactor is sold as an equilibrium
mixture of the fuel isotopes. Fuel salt is returned to the reactor as
needed. | ~
The blanket salt is processed by the fluoride volatility process
along with a Pa-removal process in which Pa is extracted by liquid bismuth
containing dissolved thorium. The same process also removes uranium.

Small side streams of fuel salt and blanket salt are continuously
withdrawn from the reactor circulating systems and routed to the process-
ing plant located within the same building. At the same time, makeup
streams are returned to the fuel and blanket systems at the same rate
they are removed. These rates are low enough that no significant reac-
tivity additions to the reactor should normally be possible. |

© The fuel-recycle processing ‘plant is located in two cells adjacent
to the reactor shield; one contains the high- radistion- level ‘operations,

‘and the other contains the lower-radiation-level operations." ‘Each cell

is designed for top access through a removable biological shield having

a thickness equivalent to 6 ft of high-density concrete. A general plan
of the processing plant and a partial view of the reactor cell is shown

in Figure 5. The highly radioactive operations in the fuel-stream proc-
essing are carried out in the smaller cell (upper left). The other cell
houses equipment for the fertile stream and the fuel-makeup-stream

operations.

The highly radioactive cell contains only fuel-stream processing
equipment consisting primarily of the fluorinator, still, waste receiver,
NeF and MgF, sorbers, and associated vessels. The other cell houses the
blanket processing equipment and fuel- and fertile-stream makeup vessels.

The processing plent will use hydrogen and fluorine gases in the
treatment of the salts. Care must be taken in utilizing these gases
because of the hazards associated with obtaining explosive mixtures of
hydrogen and oxygen, or fluorine. Thus, hydrogen must be isolated from
the fluorine and from the reactor cell. Also, fluorine must be isolated
from the reactor system, and organic lubricants must not enter the fluorine
system.

The processing plant Will utilize the same off-gas disposal system
as the reactor plant. This combined use should not introduce operating
hazards. The integrity of the cooling systems needed for cooling of
processing equipment must be assured, both during continuous processing
and during storage of waste.

Criticality considerations must be considered, such that recovery
of fissionable material constitutes no criticality hazard; however, due
to the relatively small quantities of fissile fuel held up in the proc-
essing plant and the character of the materials handled, no difficulty
is anticipated.

Reactor fuel additions will be done primarily through the return
line from the processing plant. The associated components would be of

all-welded construction and would be maintained by remote maintenance

procedures.

) 2.4. Off-Gas System

~ Xenon and krypton as well as tritium are stripped from the fuel
salt in the reactor circulating system vy sparging with an inert gas,
such as helium. This gas along with the gases generated are treated

In addition to removing the }®®Xe, this system of circulation effectively
transfers a large fraction of the other gaseous fission products to areas
where the decsy heat can be removed more readily.

About 0.1 scfm of the gas stream leaving the initial charcoal beds
(or 0.4 scfm total for the four fuel-salt circulating loops) is passed
through additional charcoal beds and then through a molecular sieve
(operated at liquid nitrogen temperature) to remove 99% or more of the
88Kr and other gaseous products. The effluent helium can be recycled
into the reactor system or passed through filters, diluted, and dis-
charged into an off-gas stack. The molecular sieves can be regenerated,
and the radioactive gases that are driven off can be sent to storage
tanks.

Concentration and storage of the tritium will probably require
additional equipment; this operation needs additional study.

A helium system provides cover gas for the blanket pump bowls,
the drain tanks, fuel-handling and processing systems, etc. Essentially
all helium will be recycled to the cover-gas system. Any discharged
cover gas passes through charcoal adsorbers and absolute filters, is
diluted with air, and discharged through the off-gas stack.

Relative to the off-gas processing of the fuel recycle system, most
of the facilities are located in the processing plant proper. In the
processing plant, off-gas comes primarily from the continuous fluorinators,
while smaller amounts are formed in various other processing vessels. The
gases are processed to prevent the release of any contained fission prod-

ucts to the atmosphere. Excess fluorine used in the fluorinators is re-

‘cycled through a surge chamber by a positive displacement pump, and a

small side stream of the recycling fluorine is sent through a caustic
scrubber to prevent gross buildup of fission products. ‘Each of the
processing vessels and holdup tanks has off-gas lines which lead to the
scrubber for treating HF, fluorine, and volatile fission products.

The scrubber operates as a continuous, countercurrent, packed bed
with recirculating aqueous KOH. A small side stream of KOH solution is
sent to waste, and the scrubber off-gas is contacted with steam to hydro-
lyze fission products such as tellurium. A filter removes the hydrolyzed
products. The noncondensable fission products are sent to the reactor

off-gas facility.
 

 

18

The off-gas system must be designed to handle the very radioactive
gases and to provide cooling of these gases. Also, while the vapor
pressure of molten salts is very low, MSRE experience indicates that
some particulate matter can be carried into the off-gas stream. Cold

trapping or filtering must be provided in the off-gas lines for removing
these mist-like particles. Any oil leakage and associated decomposition °
products entering the off-gas system must be removed by a filter system.

The off-gas system primarily removes fission products, recirculates
sparge gases back to the reactor system, and holds up fission products
until they have decayed sufficiently for disposal. If fission products
are not held up sufficiently, radioactive gases are discharged prematurely,
leading to high activity levels.

3. REACTOR SAFETY ASPECTS

In operating a reactor power plant there always exists the possi-
bility that reactivity can be inadvertently added to the system, lead-
ing to a system disturbance. If this disturbance is very small, no ill
effects result. Increasing the degree of disturbance can lead to con-
ditions which affect reactor operation (operating safety) and eventually
to conditions which affect the safety of the general public (ultimate
safety). In this section the MSBR operations are discussed from the
viewpoint of items which need to be evaluated from a safety standpoint
such as reactivity coefficients, control rod function, possible reactivity
events that could cause reactivity additions to the reactor, and the
stability requirements of the reactor power plant. In general, the
specific situations which need to be evaluated are dependent upon the

design and operational features of the system.
3.1. Reactivity Coefficients and Kinetics Parameters
A number of reactivity coefficients are associated with an MSBER

system. These include those associated with temperature, voids, pressure,

fuel concentration, graphite concentration, xenon concentration, fuel

burnup, fuel flow rate, and involve the fuel and blanket fluids separately
and together. From the viewpoint of reactor safety, the most important
coefficients appear to be the temperature coefficients of reactivity for
the fuel salt, the blanket salt, and the graphite moderator, and the fuel
concentration coefficient of reactivity. There are special circumstances
where others are also of importance. All of these need to be determined
specifically.

Molten-salt reactors have, in general, a relatively large negative
fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity, due to the expulsion of fuel
from the core region with increasing temperature. The value for MSBR
systems will be in the range of —1 x 107% Mk _/°F to 5 x: 1078 Ak _/°F, the
value being a function of design and operating conditions. This coef-
ficient gives inherent control and safety to molten-salt systems, since
any increase in power level tends to decrease the reactivity and thus
decrease the power level. Since MSBR's will normally operate with only
low values of excess reactivity available, the temperature coefficient
appears sufficient for controlling the reactor without excessive tempera-
ture variations. This inherent control feature permits use of control
rod mechanisms which have relatively slow action. ~~ :

+ Increasing the prompt temperature coefficient of reactivity generally
improves the safety and stability margins of reactor operations, provided
that the reactivity is added by means other than the temperature coeffi-
cient. However, the temperature coefficient itself cen add reactivity:
by means of "cold slug" type occurrences. - Such an occurrence in an MSBR
would be normally associated with an increase of fluid flow rate; however,
increasing the flow rate tends to decrease reactivity due to the associated
increased loss in delayed neutrons. The effective value for the delayed
neutron fraction in 233y- fueled reactors is about 0.003 in fixed fuel
systems; in MSBR systems, the effective value for beta during fuel cir-
culation would be about 0.001. }

Reactivity coefficients need to be determined in order to properly
evaluate the safety of MSER ‘systems. Primary values appear to be the
temperature coefficients associated with the fuel and blanket fluids and
with the graphite; the void coefficients associated with both the fuel
 

 

 

20

and blanket fluids; concentration coefficients associated with the fissile
and fertile salts in the core; reactivity coefficients associated with
loss of fuel flow;. effective delayed neutron fraction as a function of
flow and power conditions; and the reactivity effects associated with
graphi te shrinkage, graphite breakup, and fuel soakup by graphite.

The reactivity coefficients need to be consistent with the kinetics
model used in the safety evaluations, and time- and space-dependent criti-
cality effects need to be included in such studies. These time- and’
space-dependent effects should include consideration of the different
heating and flow, rates within the reactor, afterheat generation, and the
change in the effective delayed neutron fraction during a power pulse.
Other parameters needed in the kinetics“ analysis include the prompt

_ neutron lifetime and xenon poisoning effects.

35.2. Control-Rod Function

 

One or more control rods are provided in the MSBR in order to provide
flexibility in reactor operations, and to control reactivity additions
such that fuel temperatures and associated temperatures do not become
excessive. As mentioned in Section 3.1, inherent control is provided
through the negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, which pro-
vides prompt protection against reactivity additions. At the same time,
if reactivity additions take place over a long-time interval, the total
reactivity added may lead to undesirably high fuel temperatures if only
the temperature coefficient is utilized (however, such temperatures may
be permissible for relatively short times -- order of hours). Installa-
tion of control rods which are slow acting (response time of about one
second) appears sufficient for controlling maximum fuel temperatures, and
would permit reactivity control independent of fuel temperature. Control
rods provide an easy means of controlling reactor power at low power
levels where the temperature coefficient is a poor operational control;
during power operation, control rods would normally be fully withdrawn
from the core. : /

21

The required reactivity worth of control rods is a function of shim
and shutdown margin requirements, and needs to be investigated in detail.
Control-rod worth as a function of fuel concentration, power conditions,
and reactor design should be studied. In particular, use of "control
rods" which use fertile blanket salt as absorber material need to be
evaluated.

The action and position of control rods during reactor startup need
to be examined. It appears reasonable that the rods be fully inserted
prior to start of fuel circulation, with eriticality achieved by with-
drawal of the rods.

In general, the control rods of the MSBR need not be used for shim

requirements (e.g., change in steady-state Xe level, or fuel temperature);

rather, associated reactivity changes can be made by adjusting the fuel

concentration. Reactor shutdown can be obtained by insertion of a con-
trol rod, or by stopping a fuel pump which leads to fuel drainage from .
the core region.

It does not appear that control rods need to control large amounts
of reactivity (probably less than 1/2% in reactivity) or to have fast |
response times (response times of about a second are probably sufficient).
However, detailed studies need to be performed relative to specific re-
quirements as a function of core design. The results obtained will be
used to determine general considerations concerning control rods and MSBR
safety.

3,35. Reactor Incidents

Items to be considered here concern physical events which influence

system reactivity, as well as some which do not influence reactivity

per se. Operational safety, or the ability to continue reactor operation
after abnormal events, is involved, as well as ultimate safety where con-

tainment of gross radioactivity and public safety are the important con-

‘cerns. These definitions are illustrated below.
 

 

 

22

As normally considered, a reactor incident involves a core reactivity
addition. If the reactivity addition is small enough, there is primarily
a small disturbance in reactor power, with no deleterious effects to the

reactor plant. Under these circumstances, operational safety is main-
tained. If the reactivity addition is large enough, a graphite tube
separating the fuel and blanket fluids may break because of the pressure
rise, with no other untoward effects. Under these circumstances the
reactor plant has produced no public hazard, but must be shut down for
repairs. Under these circumstances operational safety has not been
maintained, but ultimate safety has not been involved. If the reac-
tivity addition is so large that the reactor vessel ruptures and gen-
erates a disruptive force which results in penetration of the reactor
containment, both operational and ultimate safety may be violated.

Reactor plant incidents can also occur without the reactor itself
being involved. For example, if mechanical failures occur which permit
water or supercritical steam to contact secondary coolant salt within
the cell containing the steam generators, high pressures could occur in
the cell and lead to rupture of this containment. Release of steam con-
taining particles of radioactive coolant salt could involve personnel
hazard and ultimate safety.

The design of an MSBR plant must consider both operational and
ultimate safety aspects; the resulting reactor plant must have opera-
tional safety assured under nearly all credible circumstances, and
ultimate safety assured under all credible circumstences. Items which
need to be considered in such safety design studies are discussed below
and are separated into those which involve reactivity additions to the
reactor proper, those associated with mechanical and physical integrity,
and items not covered in either of the above categories. In nearly all
cases, these events require malfunction of equipment or reactor operation
as indicated below. |

)
3.3.1 Reactivity Additions
| Reactivity can be added to the MSBR by. mechanisms and events similar
to those considered for the MSRE;? in addition, the use of two fluid

streams separated by graphite tube walls and the supercritical steam-

 

power cycle requires that several other events be considered. Possible
reactivity additions need to be investigated in detail.

The protective devices available to the MSBR are similar to those
in the MSRE. "Prompt" protection is afforded by the negative temperature
coefficient of reactivity and "delayed" protection is provided by the
control rods and also by drainage of fuel salt from the core region.
Since all reactivity changes involve rates of addition rather than re-
activity steps, an important factor in protection is the minimum neutron
source strength which cen exist in the core. The MSBR fuel contains an
inherent neutron source of nearly 10” n/sec due to the a,n reactions re-
sulting from the alpha decay of °33U and 234U in the fuel salt. An addi-
tional neutron source exists from the y,n reaction resulting from the
decay of fission products within the fuel salt; the photoneutron source
is greater than 10” n/sec for about four months after reactor shutdown
following a month's operation at power. Thus a strong internal neutron
source is always present; if reactivity is added at low rates, multipli-
cation of this source. results in a significant increase in reactor power
before large amounts of reactivity can be added to the system, which in
turn permits the temperature coefficient to become. effective after rela-
tively small gross reactivity additions.

Net Fuel Addition to Core. Probably the largest reactivity addition

 

that can take place in an MSBR is that associated with breakage of one or
more graphite tubes with net addition of fuel salt to the core region.
However, special circumstances have to exist for this to take place since
the blanket region operates at pressures higher than the fuel region, and
tube breakage under normal conditions would add fertile salt to the fuel
region and reduce reactivity. Thus, to add reactivity, the fuel pressure

- would have to rise higher than the blanket pressure at the time of, or

shortly after, breakage of & graphite tube. This is possible if the
high pressure of the supercritical steam system is at least partially
 

 

2h

transmitted to the fuel-salt system, or if there is a decrease in the \o
blanket pressure without a concurrent decrease in the core-fuel pressure.

Failure of the tubing in the boiler-superheater could allow the
high-pressure steam to enter the coolant-salt system. To protect against
a buildup of pressure in the coolant system, rupture discs are provided
in the steam generator and reheaters, and also could be provided on the
shell sides of the fuel and blanket heat exchangers. If these rupture
discs fail to operate, or fail to operate quickly enough, it is con-
ceivable that a buildup of pressure in the coolant system could cause
failure of the primary fuel heat exchanger. The likely means of failure
would be rupture of the shell or collapse of the tubes, neither event
transmitting the pressure increase to the fuel fluid. However, if there
were localized weakness in a fuel-heat-exchanger tube, due to a defect
in manufacture, fretting corrosion, ete., failure of a tube could occur
leading to a buildup of pressure in the fuel system. Alternatively, loss
of overpressure in the blanket region could permit operation with fuel
pressures higher than blanket pressure. If a graphite tube failed under ¥
such operating conditions, there would be & net fuel addition to the
core region. The reactivity addition would depend upon the pressures
and flow passages involved and their variation with time.

If steam does contact coolant salt, no exothermal reactions of any
consequence are involved. Mixing of steam with coolant salt would oxidize
the coolant salt, but no safety hazard would be introduced because of this
action. However, the corrosiveness of the mixture to the container ma-
terial needs determination. There are no fission products in the coolant
salt, and the induced activity present would decay (the primary activity
is associated with Na2®% and Ne, having half lives of about 15 hr and 7
sec, respectively). Cleanup of the system and repair or replacement of
damaged equipment appears possible.

The coolant salt is compatible with the fuel salt, so leakage of
coolant salt into the reactor system does not involve safety; any such
leakage would reduce reactivity. The BF; added to the reactor fuel could
be readily removed by heating the salt, with the BF; removed as a gas.
 

 

[2]

25

Contacting fuel salt with steam would oxidize the uranium, but
probably would not cause any problems other than those associated with
subsequent cleanup of the fuel.- However, possible reactivity effects
due to fuel precipitation need to be studied specifically.

At this time it appears reasonable that engineered safeguards, such
as installing rupture discs within the heat exchangers of the coolant
system, and providing strengthened primary system heat exchanger tubes
can either protect against such an accident, or keep. the amount of fuel
salt added to the core region small enough that ultimate safety is not
involved. However, detailed studies are needed to examine this situation.

Reactivity Changes Due to Graphite Behavior. In addition to the

case discussed sbove in which breakage of graphite tubes was assumed

 

to take place, other graphite behavior can effect reactivity changes.
For example, shrinkage of graphite during radiation exposure can effec-
tively influence fuel concentrations; however, the associated reactivity
changes should take place at rates such that they can be readily com-
pensated by adding or removing fuel through normal: operations.

Reactivity can be added if part of the graphite inside a fuel tube
were to break away from the tube proper and be swept out of the core
region. Only small amounts of reactivity could be involved so long as
this action took place in single tubes, and no difficulty for this situa-
tion would be anticipated... Alternatively, if graphite were removed from
the blanket portion of the core region, it would be displaced by fertile
salt, leading to a decrease in reactivity such that safety is not involved.

Graphite is compatible with molten salt, but fuel penetration into
the graphite could take ‘place with time. Here again, the ‘time element
involved would make such events insignificant from a safety viewpoint.

- If, on the other hand; a pressure rise took place in the ‘core which caused
the fuel to penetrate and fill voids in the graphite, perhaps a signifi-

cant reactivity addition could be obtained. The actual addition is de-
pendent upon the physical properties of the graphite employed. If the

~ pressure rise occurs because of a previous reactivity addition, the

pressure buildup itself would expel fuel salt from the core and tend.

to decrease reactivity.
 

26

Fuel-salt penetration in graphite appears to present little problem
during normal operation, but may present difficulties during emergency
shutdowns which require fuel-salt drainage. Fuel remaining in the graphite
would generate decay heat which could lead to undesirably high temperatures
(temperature distributions and levels influence thermal stresses and creep
rates, which can affect the mechanical integrity of the graphite). The
ebility of blanket salt to remove this decay heat needs investigation.

Reactivity Changes Associated With Changes in Flow Conditions. In a
circulating-fuel reactor, an appreciable fraction of the delayed neutrons
can be emitted external to the core under normal flow conditions. In-
creasing flow thus tends to lower the contribution of delayed neutrons
to the fission chain and also decreases the average neutron. lifetime of
the reactor. While lowering the delayed neutron fraction (beta) is nor-
mally considered detrimental to safety, this is in the context of systems
having instrument control. Lowering the value of beta in a system having
inherent control under the condition that reactivity additions take place
at relatively low rates does not significantly decrease the ultimate safety
of the system. Also, the effective value of beta increases during a rise
in power, a favorable condition.

Since delayed neutrons are "lost" because of fuel circulation, stop-
page of flow due to pump power failure would tend to add reactivity to
the system. However, in the MSBR the reactivity addition would only be
about 0.002. In addition, stoppage of flow leads to drainage of the core,
which would make the reactor subcritical. The fuel temperature rise due
to afterheat during drainage of the core may be the most significant vari-
able, and needs detailed study. Also, time delays in fuel drainage from
the core following pump stoppage needs to be investigated experimentally,
and the results interpreted relative to reactor safety.

Another reactivity incident possible with systems having a negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity is that of the "cold slug" accident.
Such an accident could occur by starting the fuel-circulating pump at a
time when the fuel external to the core has been cooled well below that .
of the fuel in the core. The. cooler fuel would edd reactivity when it
entered the core; this addition could exceed the reactivity decrease due

a]
 

 

 

 

«3

x

27

to the "loss" of delayed neutrons associated with fluid transport. By

going critical only with the pump on, making use of the control rod for
this purpose, would avoid the "cold slug" incident. The seriousness of
the cold slug incident and the control mechanisms needed under various

circumstances needs investigation.

Drainage of the reactor fuel system begins automatically due to
gravity forces when the fuel pump stops. Fuel from the core drains by
gravity into the sump tank of the fuel pump where afterheat is removed
by cooling coils. Convective circulation may be assisted by flow of gas

used to sparge xenon from the fuel salt. However, as pointed out above,

fuel and graphite temperatures also need to be studied during fuel drain-

age from the core. In general, the ability and need for afterheat re-

moval requires detailed studies.

Changes in Fuel Concentration. Reactivity can be added by increasing

 

the concentration of fissile material within the fuel fluid; examples of’
possible events are filling the fuel tubes with salt containing abnormally
high fissile concentrations, and returning salt having abnormally high
fuel concentrations from the processing system to the reactor system.

The reactor would initially be "filled" by adding fissile material
to the carrier salt while the latter was circulating. If, however, follow-
ing criticality and drainage of fuel salt from the reactor core, the
fissile concentration in the drained fuel salt were increased inadvertently,
refilling the core could result in a supercritical reactor. Such an event
is highly unlikely, since fuel would not be added in large amounts to the
drained system; also, partial freezing of the ‘fuel salt does not appear
to lead to significant increases of fissile concentration in the fluid

- portion of the fuel. Specific cases need to be evaluated, however,

The rate of return of fuel from the processing plant is low, and it

© will be difficult to add reactivity at a high rate through the processing
‘lines because of the limited rate at which fuel cen be added. A more

likely way to increase fuel concentration above the normal value would

“be to fill the core with fuel having & temperature lower than the critical

temperature. A reactivity added by this means would correspond to a low-
rate addition and should cause no difficulty.
 

28

If fuel were to accumulate outside the core region, and inadvertently
“return to the core, reactivity could be added rapidly to the reactor.
Since the fuel is homogeneous and chemically stable, this event does not
appear to be likely; also, any such possibility would be indicated by a
previous reactivity loss. Nonetheless, the consequences of. uranium
precipitation or accumulation outside the core and its ‘subsequent addition
to the core region requires general evaluation. Such studies will help
determine operating procedures consistent-with reactor safety.

While none of the above events appears to constitute an operational
or ultimate safety hazard, all should be considered in detail.

Reactivity Addition by Control-Rod Movement. - The presence of a con-
trol rod permits reactivity addition to the reactor by rod movement.
Normally the reactor would be critical with the control rod completely
removed, . but there could be conditions where criticality is achieved
with the rod partially or completely inserted. The amount and rate of
reactivity addition associated with control rod movement under these con~
ditions would be limited by the control rod worth. (which will probably
be under 0.005 Ak) and the rate of withdrawal (which will be limited to
a low value). As with the MSRE, no difficulty is foreseen, particularly
if rod withdrawal does not continue after the power level reaches an
initial peak value as a result of rod movement.

Reactivity Addition Due to Positive Pressure Coefficient. The MSBR
design specifies use of helium as a sparge gas to remove xenon from the
circulating fuel. As a result of this operation, some gas will undoubtedly
circulate through the MSBR core, resulting in a positive pressure coef-
ficient of reactivity. The importance of this coefficient on safety is a
function of the gas content of the core, which in turn is related to the
ease of stripping xenon from the fuel salt and the efficiency of the gas
separator used to remove sparge gas before it enters the core region. An
increase in pressure would decrease the fraction gas in the core and in-
crease reactivity. Experience with the MSRE indicates that the above is
not a serious problem, but it needs to be evaluated specifically for the
MSER. -

3.3.2 Mechanical and ‘Physical Integrity — Containment

© This subject is related to the reactivity additions discussed above.
Here, the discussion is concerned with containment relative to events
which do not necessarily require or result in reactivity additions to
the reactor system. Some of the questions which arise are: What are
the consequences of having water and salt in a cell if these materials
accidentally make contact? What are the cooling conditions required if
there is mixing of salt and water? What are the consequences of fuel-
salt leakage or diffusion into the coolant-salt system? How practicable
is it to maintain low leakage from a containment cell at the temperatures
involved (leakage of no more then 1% of the containment volume per day)?
What are the consequences of a major spill of fuel salt within the reactor
cell?

The containment of the reactor plant has to be assured even though
there is rupture of, or leakage from, the primary and secondary salt
systems. Rupture and/or leakage may result from overheating, overstress-
ing, corrosion, or other unexpected material failures. The severity of
the containment problem will depend on the amount of salt spillage, the
rate at which water mixes with hot salt, and the amount of water added
to the cell. Consequences of a spill accident are heat generation,
pressure buildup, and release of fission products into the cell, and
these will need to be evaluated for specific cases. Problems associated
with a major spill of fuel salt within the reactor cell must be considered
in the detailed design of MSBR systems and must also be studied experi-
mentally. If water is present, “corrosion of steel by HF must be considered.
The effects of local thermal expansion or energy deposition due to hot
salt spillage needs evaluation. Provision should also be made that oil
from the pump lubrication system does not contact hot components, al- -

though if this does occur, there normally would not be sufficient oxygen

to support combustion in the cell atmosphere of inert gas (nitrogen).

In order to assure containment, knowledge of the very long-term creep .
behavior of materials under plant operating conditions is needed. Infor-
mation is also needed on’ the conditions required to produce "steam ex-
plosions" upon mixing of salt end water; similar information is needed

for the mixing of oil and salt.
 

30

The containment of fission products should be assured, and release \o/
of these through the off-gas system must not constitute a safety hazard.
This involves the amount of volatile material which is to be released
and the amount of fission products carried in very small, mist-like salt
particles. In any case, the release of material through the off-gas
system should be controlled so that exposure of individuals is not ex-
cessive. This can be accomplished by filtration and retention systems
as required. Beryllium and fluorine hazards, as well as radioactive
iodine, must be considered relative to permissible release rates during
normal operation as well as following a severe incident. The release of
fission products upon mixing of fuel salt and water, or of salt and oil
also needs determination. A fission product flow and inventory sheet
will be made as MSBR design studies are made in more detail. Also, in-
vestigation of the plating out of fission products throughout the reactor
system is an important part of the chemical development program. The
implication that fission product plating have upon reactor safety needs

to be considered. : =

In designing the reactor system containment, consideration must be
given to the possibility of earthquakes. The effect of such an event on -
reactor containment is, of course, dependent upon its severity, which in
turn is a function of local conditions. The possibility of flooding amd
associated consequences is also dependent upon local conditioms.

The most likely method of rupturing the secondary containment is
through sabotage, missile damage, acts of nature, or excessive pressure.
The generation of missiles in the reactor cell is not likely, since the
reactor pressure is low. Missile damage and high pressures are more
likely in the coolant cell and steam plant, and, although massive concrete
shielding is provided, such events need further investigation. The con-
tainment cells will be protected by vapor-suppression systems, which’
should prevent the pressure from exceeding the containment design figure
(~45 psig for present MSBR design) in case of buildup of steam pressure.
In designing the vapor-suppression systems, it is necessary to consider
the amount of salt and water that can come together and/or the leakage

of high-pressure steam into the containment volume. Valves are located J

in the steam lines which can be closed to prevent draining all the steam
system into the coolant cell. The reservoir of condensing water should
be adequate to keep the cell pressure below the design containment pressure.
Also, the supercritical steam systems contain relatively small amounts of

water in comparison with subcritical systems.

3.3.3 Miscellaneous Incidents

 

Included here are possible incidents which are not covered in the’
above sections. These involve vessel criticality, heat removal, and heat
addition conditions.

Studies are needed relative to the possibility of attaining super-
critical conditions in fuel drain tanks and in vessels of the processing
plant, along with consequences of such occurrences. Also; criticality
conditions might occur as a result of fuel spills. In general, tanks
which hold fuel should store it indefinitely in a subcritical condition.
Accumulation of spilled fuel salt should be in regions which cannot attain
criticality.

The afterheat conditions which can exist within the reactor plant
particularly need to be studied in detail, and cooling and heating pro-
vided and assured as needed. The temperatures occurring in the core
following fuel drainage need to be evaluated as a function of fuel re-
tention by the graphite. The influence of air contact on fuel salt needs
study for conditions associated with core maintenance operations. The
effects of salt freezing and melting in various parts of the primary and
secondary salt circuits require evaluation, with equipment designed to
minimize undesirable effects (e.g., rupture of equipment).

‘The consequences of flow blockage with the reactor system require
investigation. A partially plugged fuel tube would normally not be
detected and could lead to salt boiling and" temperature gradients which
may affect the mechanical integrity of the fuel tube. Flow blockage may
also lead to inability to remove all the fuel salt from the core, which

may lead to afterheat problems and/or maintenance difficulties.

3.4. Reactor Stability

Although usually treated separately, reactor safety and stability
are intimately related. Reactor safety normally considers relatively
large reactivity additions and their influence on system behavior for
small time intervals, while reactor stability studies normally consider
small reactivity additions and determine whether they result in a buildup

of oscillations to the point where reactor safety is involved.

For the MSBR, investigations of stability are required to study
the influence of inherent characteristics on instrumentation and control
system requirements. Although the MSBR has a negative temperature coef-
ficient of reactivity, this in itself is not sufficient to insure stability,
particularly if the system has time delays. The MSBR has a number of
builtin time delays which can either help or hinder reactor stability,
such as the time lags associated with heat transport from the graphite to
the fuel, with fuel and fertile salt transport, and with delayed neutron
production. Because of the complexity of the three-loop system from a
dynamics enalysis point of view, a preliminary linearized analysis should
first be made to evaluate the current design and aid in establishing ap-
propriate means of system control. -

It is estimated that an adequate preliminary analysis for the com-
plete system (reactor core to turbogenerator) would involve about 60 first-
order equations (about 1h for ‘the fuel stream, 14 for the fertile stream,
7 for nuclear kinetics, 15 for coolant streams, and 10 for the steam
system). These equations would consider fuel and blanket nodes, transport
delays, heat exchanger nodes, and fuel leakage effects. Work is required
in formulating the specific equations and in compiling and evaluating the
physical parameters. Present computer codes could be utilized in the
initial analysis. In particular, codes are available for performing a
dynamic analysis utilizing a general linear model. These can be used to
give system eigenvalues, system frequency response, and/or system trans-
ient response. oo : (

the reactor system, the relative importance of the fuel temperature and
graphite temperature coefficients of reactivity, and the influence of
delayed neutron fraction and flow effects on reactor system behavior.
The effect of fuel flow on the effective delayed neutron fraction may
reduce this value from 0.003 to less than 0.001. This reduction is not
necessarily bad from either the viewpoint of inherent safety or inherent
stability. In fact, lowering the delayed neutron fraction can increase
the degree of stability, as was the case for the Homogeneous Reactor Test
(HRT). Also, the tendency (in circulating-fuel systems) of the effective
delayed neutron fraction to increase during the power rise portion of a
power pulse tends to aid stability. Plans for the MSRE call for operating
that reactor with 222U fuel beginning in the fourth quarter of FY 1968.
Studies will be made of the stability of the MSRE with the 2337 fuel and
the results will be used where applicable in the analysis of the stability
of the MSBR.

More detailed stability analysis studies would be dependent upon
the results obtained from the initial evaluation but presumably would
include investigation of nonlinear effects and their relative influence

on results.
4. MSBR SAFETY PROGRAM
4.1. Summary

The studies and investigations associated with MSBR safety are

summarized here in terms of general and detailed studies which need

to be done in order to evaluate MSBR safety; these constitute investi-

gations which will be carried out in the MSBR Safety Program.

~The favorable safety characteristics of MSBR systems arise from the
low excess reactivity available to the reactor, the prompt negative tem-
perature coefficient of reactivity, the low system pressures, the low
level of fission gases and fission products retained within the reactor,
the mobility of fluid fuel, and the ease of fuel drainage from the re-

actor. At the same time, there are a number of possible incidents and
 

3h,

safety aspects which need detailed investigation; these aspects are re-
lated to the specific plant design and involve both mechanical and nuclear
design features. Plant systems which have a major influence on MSBR
reactor safety are the reactor system proper, the steam system, the fuel-
recycle-processing system, the coolant systems, and the off-gas system.
These are described above (Section 2), along with safety features that
were incorporated in the plant design.

Safety analysis requires a study of possible incidents, their conse-
quences, and their avoidance. Types of accidents which can take place

include those due to reactivity additions. Reactor behavior under such

circumstances. is influenced by reactivity coefficients and kinetics param-

eter values. Reactivity coefficients which will be considered include
those associated with temperature, voids, pressure, fuel concentration,
and graphite concentration, and involve the fuel and blenket fluids .
separately and together. The function and design of control rods will

be fully investigated; these studies will determine the number, reactivity
worth, placement, and response requirements of control rods, as well as
the ability to utilize blanket salt as a control rod. Possible reactor
incidents will be evaluated as to their probability and their consequences;
also, the influence of design changes (including alternate core designs)
on safety aspects will be obtained.

Under normal operating conditions, the MSBR should be load-following
and self-controlling because of the prompt, negative temperature coeffi-
cient of reactivity associated with the fuel salt. The temperature coef-
ficient also protects against excessively high reactor temperatures and
pressures in case of reactivity incidents. This situation is partielly
due to the large inherent neutron source strength present in the fuel
salt (nearly 10” n/sec due to the a,n reaction), which permits the tem-
perature coefficient to become effective as a reactivity control agent
soon after initiation of rate additions of reactivity.

Reactivity additions and their safety implications which will be
considered in detail involve: breakage of graphite fuel tubes and the
possible net fuel addition to the core region; other types of graphite
behavior; changes in fluid-flow conditions; changes in fissile con-
centration within the fuel fluid; abrupt changes in fission product

concentrations; change in control rod position; and the effect of pressure
increases on reactivity. Relative to graphite’ tubes, a study of the cred-
ibility and the consequences of single and multiple failures of graphite
tubes in the reactor will be made.

The integrity of plant containment under both reactivity incident
conditions and under circumstances where reactivity itself is not involved
will be evaluated for a number of physical possibilities; these include
events such as mixing of coolant salt with water or steam; spills of
fuel or coolant salt and associated thermal, chemical, corrosion, and
criticality affects; temperature changes due to afterheat generation;
container damage due to high temperature and/or corrosion; criticality
in regions outside the core; flow blockage within the fuel or coolant
streams; and blockage of flow in the off-gas system. The consequences
of credible accidents will be determined in all cases.

- The application of pressure-suppression systems to molten-salt
reactor plants will be investigated, and problems associated with their
use will be analyzed. Additional design studies will be performed to
better define such systems and their operation in detail.

There are a number of areas which will be investigated experimentally
in order to determine the general safety problems of molten-salt reactors.
Some of these are closely related to areas studied as part of the
engineering-development and research programs of the MSBR Program. These
include determination of the effects of reactor operating conditions on
the physical behavior and properties of graphite, of graphite-to-metal
joints, and.of Hastelloy N. The long-term creep properties of Hastelloy N
and graphite need to be known and understood; also, the physical and
chemical properties of salts and of salt-water mixtures need to be known.
In addition, the ability to drain the fuel from the core under credible
conditions needs study; also the desirability of alternative core designs:
relative to afterheat removal will be evaluated.

‘Experimental. information will be obtained on salt permeation of
graphite, fission-product deposition in reactor systems, the ability to
remove fission products from surfaces, and the abllity to remove after-

heat generated in the fuel salt. Experiments will be performed concerning
 

 

36

the release of fission gases from solid as well as molten fuel salts,
and concerning the fission-product flow and inventory throughout the
reactor system. Retention of fission products as well as tritium in
off-gas systems will be demonstrated.

Measurements will be made concerning the conditions required to
produce "steam explosions" when molten salt and water are mixed. The
release of fission products from fuel salt upon mixing it with water,
or with oil, also will be measured.

Investigations will also be performed concerning the reactivity
effects associated with precipitation of uranium, rapid movements of
fission products, "cold slug" accidents, fuel leakage into the blanket
region via a plenum chamber, boiling of blanket salt within the core |
region, and buckling of a fuel-plenum wall with associated change in
graphite distribution. |

A stability analysis of the reactor Plant systems will be made to
determine the operating, control, and/or design requirements for obtain-
ing satisfactory plant characteristics. Items to be considered are time-
lag events, spatial-distribution effects, the effect of fuel tube
oscillations upon reactor behavior, and the relative importance of

various parameter values upon system behavior.
4.2. Cost Estimates

The planned safety studies are to resolve the basic safety problems
associated with MSBR plants. This means that enough information will be
obtained to know which problems are the most important ones and how they
can be overcome or eliminated (e.g., by changing either the reactor de-
sign or methods of operation). These studies will also provide experi-
mental information which is necessary in order to resolve safety problems.
On this basis, the cost estimates required to carry out the investigations
indicated above are those given in Table 1. These estimates take into
consideration the efforts planned in other parts of the MSBR Program
which are related to reactor safety, but do not include costs of such
studies. However, the MSBR safety program depends on these other in-
vestigations for major contributions. Information which will be obtained

from other parts of the Program include the physical and chemical prop-
erties of salts and structural materials, the characteristics of pressure-
suppression systems and containment structures, and the behavior for
reliaebility of reactor components.

The safety program outlined above includes the specific mathematical
and physical formulation of the various problems, the compilation and
evaluation of parameter values, and -determination of reactor plant be-
havior under the postulated conditions. Experimental studies will be
performed in conjunction with other MSBR investigations, which will in-
volve modifying or initiating new experiments so as to give pertinent
safety information. The objective is to determine design and operating
conditions which are compatible with reactor safety and economic power
production. The present MSBR design would serve as a starting point in
these studies; however, general safety information related to molten-
salt reactors will be obtained as problems become more clearly defined.
