oo INTRODUCTION

In this document we have compiled physical property infor-
mation, either measured or estimated, on seven salt mixtures
that are presently of importance in the design of advanced
molten salt reactors. The primary user of this compilation
will, no doubt, be the nuclear reactor engineer who requires
these data for the design and development of molten salt re-
actors. Specialists in the chemistry of molten salts may be
another audience interested in this report. We earnestly hope
that all who critically examine or otherwise use these data
will give us the benefit of their advice so that future ver -.
sions ofthis document can be greatly improved.

Basis for Selecting the Salts

 

The choice of salt mixtures has been primarily governed
by recent changes in the Molten Salt Reactor Program: (a)
the combining of fissile and fertile material within the same
circuit (the "single-region" concept), and (b) the testing of
coolant salts which are mainly NaBF,.

Four mixtures have been selected for possible use as
single-region fuel melts. These are:

Composition (mole %)

 

 

Salt Mixture LiF BeF, ThF, UF,
F,; 73 16 10.7 0.3
F, 72 21 6.7 0.3
F, 68 20 11.7 0.3
F, 63 25 11.7 0.3
4

Salts F;, and F; are fuel mixtures appropriate to a
prismatic configuration of the graphite moderator; the lesser
concentrations of BeF, and ThF, in F; may be more favorable
with respect to rare-earth fission product removal by reduc-.
tive extraction.

Salt F,, containing a relatively low concentration of
thorium, might be used in a reactor (e.g., with random-packed
graphite spheres) where good breeding performance is not a
prime consideration. Mixture F,, on the other hand, could
contribute to improved breeder performance mainly because
the higher the beryllium concentration, the greater the
opportunity to increase neutrons by the (n, 2n) reaction.

It is worthwhile noting that for the purposes of
estimating physical properties of salts F,-F,, the effects
of the small concentration of UF; was almost always assumed
to be the same as for the corresponding increase in the ThF,
concentration.

Although no firm decision has been reached as to the
exact composition of the fuel salt for the next molten salt
reactor, it is highly probable that the concentrations of
LiF, BeF, and ThF, will be within the limits given for these
components by the above four mixtures.

Physical property information is also provided for:

LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) symbolized as L;B.
This mixture has been used in the MSRE as the coolant and as

the flush salt for the fuel circuit. The inclusion of L,;B
5

in this report is justified by the good possibility that it

Eo

will be a flush salt (and perhaps a coolant) in future molten
salt reactors.

As intermediate coolant (in this case the fluid which
transports heat from the fuel salt to the steam generators)
the salts which presently appear attractive contain mostly
NaBF;. Two such salts are considered:

Composition (mole %)

Coolant NaBF, NaF
C; 92 8
C, 100

The salt symbolized as C; is a eutectic composition
which melts at 385°C (725°F). Although a lower melting
fluoroborate mixture would be desirable, it is not presently
clear how much and which additive will substantially depress
the melting temperature. Moreover, it seems likely that
lower melting fluoroborate mixtures will not be very differ-
ent from C; ; hence mixture Cy seems, at present, the leading
candidate for the next coolant to be tried in a molten salt
reactor.

Another salt for which estimates are tabulated in this
report is '"pure' NaBF,, symbolized as C,. Since stoichio-
metric NaBF, does not exist in the molten state without a
very high partial pressure of BF; gas, C, cannot be considered
a practical coolant. However, estimations of the physical
properties of hypothetically pure molten NaBF, are useful

for evaluating the contributions of NaBF, as a component in
a salt mixture. In solution, [BF,] ion may be imagined to -
behave like a halide ion, slightly larger and more polarizable
than iodide ion. By applying this analogy, several properties
of C, were estimated from the measured properties of molten
Nai,

For convenience, a list of salt compositions and their
corresponding liquidus temperatures are given after the

abstract (page 2) and at the end of this report (page 46).

Uncertainties Listed with the Physical Property Values

Each contributor has stated what he believes is the
error associated with the experimental result or with the
estimated quantity. For most cases, the uncertainty repre-
sents considerably more than either ''goodness of fit" of an
interpolation or internal consistency available from thermo~-
dynamics. Instead, the uncertainty may be considered as the
largest probable combination of systematic and random errors
associated with the value given for the property. Where the
listing is a property-temperature equation, the uncertainty
is for the property calculated at the temperature substituted
in the equation. In properties where the number of signifi-
cant figures are not justified by the specified uncertainties,
the extra significant figures are given to aid the reader in
judging whether a particular salt is "less than" or ''greater
than" another salt for the property in question.

Although the magnitudes of the uncertainties are highly

intuitive and often disappointingly large, they should be
it taken seriously. Each contributor, while not necessarily
qualifying as "expert" in the physical property, either
possesses long experience in measuring the property or has
carefully (and usually critically) reviewed the literature
for that property. In other words, for each property the
person whose name is given is at least a very interested

observer and may also be an active participant.

For Further Information ---

It is best to contact the person (or persons) listed
under the property heading. The editor hopes to provide
addenda to this report as newer, more reliable, data become

available.

} Discussion
Viscosities of Reactor Fuel Mixtures

From the reported viscosity measurements?’ of the systen
LiF-BeF, -UF,, two trends can be observed:

(a) for LiF concentrations of 60 mole % or greater, substitu-
tion of UF, for BeF, (at const. temp.) causes an increase in
viscosity,

(b) increasing LiF from 60 to 70 mole %, at const. temp. and
at const. UF, concentration, decreases the viscosity by, at
most, a factor of 1/2; for most compositions the factor is
closer to 3/4.

The data and trends observed for the system LiF-BeF, -UF,
can serve to predict reliably (i.e., to within 25%) the
viscosities in the slightly different system, LiF-BeF,-MF,

(M is Th and/or U). Assuming that all single-region fuel
mixtures will be restricted to the following ranges of component
composition:

62 - 73 mole % LiF

15 - 30 mole % BeF,

6 - 16 mole % MF, ,
then one may conclude that the predicted viscosities have a

rather narrow range of values, e.g.,

 

at 600°C, 9 - 16 Centipoise

at 700°C, 5 - 9 Centipoise

As a first approximation, the temperature dependence of
thermal conductivity may be neglected. Although the
thermal conductivity of molten salts does vary somewhat
with temperature, uncertainties in measurements at a
given temperature are usually greater than the tempera-
ture dependence over the whole range of temperature
(usually an interval of 200°C).

Ppefore assuming anything about the relative values of

the four fuel melts, please read the caveat in the
Discussion.

Sources of Data and Methods of Estimation

expression derived by Raolt and adapted to molten salts by
Turnbull. The expression is

ions per molecule. Part of the expression,

11.9 x 10-3 T 1/2 01/3 /(u/m) 5/6 |

is a good approximation to the average maximum Debye lattice
frequency for single ionic salts.” It was found for eleven
molten mixtures (nitrates or chlorides) that the above
expression agreed with experimental results, on the average,
to within 15%. For two fluoride melts, one L,B,°> the other,
LiF-BeF, -ThF,-UF, (71.2-23-5-.8 mole 7% > the theoretical
expression yielded values approximately 25% less than experi-
mental. Note that the latter is very similar in composition
to F,.

In applying the theoretical expression the liquidus tem-
perature was substituted for I, in computing n, the following
ions were assumed: Li®, F~, (BeF,)2~, (ThFg)~', (UF;)7!.
Assumption of the more plausible ions, (ThF,)~® and (UF,)”3
leads to a lower and less reliable estimated thermal conduc-
tivity. Also, 15% was added to the estimated value because of
the previously noted discrepancy for the cases of the two
similar fluoride mixtures.

L,B: Measured’

C,, C,: Very preliminary measurement’ on C, agrees with

the theoretical expression.
Discussion

The relative conductivities of the four fuel mixtures,

F,-F4, are not mere reliable than the absolute values. The

tabulated conductivities were obtained from a theoretical
13

equation that was greatly extended to apply to these mixtures.

The dearth of accurate experimental data prevents adequate

testing of the extended theoretical expression either absolutely

or relatively.

Sources of Data and Method of Estimation

 

For 6 salts x was estimated empirically from data on related
or analogous salt melts. Often the assumptions employed were not
those which seemed physically most reasonable, but those which
resulted in the most self-consistent correlation of the data.
Therefore, estimated k's are believed to have relatively large
uncertainties. The number of significant figures in the equations
for « vs. t .are not meant to contradict the listed uncertainties,
but rather are intended to show differences between salt mixtures
whose conductivities are predicted to be very similar.

Salts F; - Fy: The following equations were employed in

these estimates:

Kg = specific conductivity at ©
Po = density at ©
Mg = equivalent weight of a mixture
M = formula weight of a component
X = mole fraction
X' = equivalent fraction

At several values of © smoothed curves of Ag VS XThF, were
obtained from conductivities of the system LiF-ThF, measured by
Brown and porter.’ Liquidus temperatures reported in references
2 and 3 were used in calculating ©. Similar curves for LiF-BeF,
were derived by plotting the experimental results for a single
composition (66 mole % LiF)? and assuming that the variation of Ag
with X' in the LiF-BeF, system was equal to that in LiF-ThF,.

(For these estimates UF, was treated as indistinguishable from
ThF, .) The equations of vs. t given above were then derived
by assuming that Ag is additive in XTnr, and XBer, for a given

concentration of LiF.

Ci: Specific conductivity data in the range 47 to 77 mole

? were combined with those calcu-

% NaBF, in the NaF-NaBF, system
lated for pure NaBF, (see C,) to interpolate «x for the composi-
tion NaBF,-NaF (92-8 mole %). The large uncertainty listed

reflects a lack of confidence in the data reported in reference

9.

Discussion
Specific conductivity is determined from resistance measure-
ments according to the relation

kK = _L (4/2)
Ry

where (g/a) is the cell constant. For a given apparatus and

set of experimental conditions, the measured value of resistance
can vary with the frequency of the applied potential wave form. 1°
The values of x listed above are valid for resistance extra-
polated to infinite frequency (denoted as Rg). Thus predicting
the resistance of the melt which will be measured in a particu-
lar experimental arrangement not only requires a value for

conductivity «, but also presupposes a knowledge of the

frequency dispersion characteristics of the measuring device.

Salts F;, - F,: Liquid heat capacities were estimated by

assuming mole-fraction additivity and assigning 16, 24, and 44

assuming that (a) temperature coefficient and (b) difference in
Cp between liquid and solid are the same as that measured for
LiF-BeF, -ThF, (72-16-12 mole %).'

Discussion

The values of 16 and 24 cal mole~! ©C-! were chosen for
the respective CG contributions of LiF and BeF, because 8 cal
(g-atom)! Oc! is the average observed for alkali and alkaline
earth halides.’ The Go of 44 cal mole”! °C! for the contribu-
tion of ThF, was assumed from the average value of 8.8 cal
(g-atom)~! ©C-! for lanthanide halides.®
The validity of using the indicated additive contributions

for estimating liquid heat capacities was checked by comparing

with measured values of three related salts:

Salts F; - F,: Although there is no isothermal heat of
fusion, estimations were made as if all the melting (or
freezing) occurred at 500°C. The salts were treated as
additive mixtures of the components, Li,BeF,, Li,;ThF,, and
LiF or ThF,. Li,BeF, was considered to be "formed" first
from the BeF, present and the appropriate quantity of LiF.

The remainder of the mixture was then considered to consist

of Li; ThF, and either LiF or ThF,, whichever was "in excess."
For example, for 1 mole of salt F,, .16 moles of BeF, and .32
moles of LiF form .16 moles of Li,BeF, while..1ll moles of ThF,
and the remaining .41 moles of LiF give .1l1 moles of Li, ThF,
and .08 moles of LiF. The estimation is then made on the basis

of .16 moles Li,BeF,, .11 moles ThF, and .08 moles LiF.
26

The following heats of fusion were used in making the hd
estimations:

Li, BeF, 10,600 cal mole~! (ref. 1)

Li; ThF, 13,960 cal mole~! (ref. 2)

LiF 6,470 cal mole! (ref. 3)

ThF, 11,000 cal mole! estimated by

assuming the entropy of fusion
is the same as that of UF, (ref. 4)

L,B: Measured.’
C; and C;: Measured.’ C, agrees within experimental

error with that calculated by subtracting the .contribution
of the heat of fusion of NaF® from C, .

D1 scussion
Although the assumptions used in estimating OHe Sion
for salts F, - F, are highly intuitive, it is encouraging to

note that the estimated and measured’ LH are respec-

fusion
tively 57.5 and 59 cal g~! for the salt mixture LiF-BeF, -ThF,
(72-16-12 mole %).

For salts F;, - Fy; to obtain the heat necessary to convert
the solid at the solidus temperature to the melt at the
liquidus temperature, an additional 10 to 15 cal g-! should
be added to the above listed heats of fusion. For convenience
in calculating the quantity of heat necessary to raise the
salt from room temperature to any desired temperature, the

following heat content equations (based on measurements) are

included:

densities that are approximately the average of the densities

Salt C, - The relatively small concentration of NaF in
C, would be expected to increase the density slightly over

calculated by subtracting the contribution of NaF (ref. 1)

from the molar volume of Cj.

For estimating the expansivity at other temperatures,
please substitute in the appropriate density-temperature

Sources of Data and Methods of Estimation

 

The expansivity is defined as

1 ,8V
a = = (—
where V, T and P are volume, temperature and pressure. Since

density is inversely proportional to volume, the expansivity

is usually derived from density-temperature data:

Most density data for liquids are linear with and decrease
with temperature, i.e.,
p= po- at (1)

po and a are constants; t is usually in degrees Celsius. Thus, Ed
31

= expansivity is very simply

oe = 2 (2)
p

The tabulated expansivities are consistent with the
corresponding density-temperature equations in the "Density
of Liquid" section of this report, To calculate the expansivity
for any temperature, substitute in equations (1) and (2). As a
rough approximation, the expansivity is one half to one third
of the temperature coefficient of density as given by the

constant a in eqn. (1).

2rsothermal compressibility is a function of pressure
as well as temperature. The tabulated equations are
less reliable at higher pressures (>50 atm).

Reasonable values derived for Co’ Cy and for sonic veloc-
ities (see Appendix A of this report) lend support to these

estimated compressibilities.

Discussion - The Dissociation Pressure of NaBF,

When NaBF; is thermally equilibrated at a temperature
above its melting point the following dissociation occurs:
NaBF, (¢) = ©NaF(g) + BF;(g) (1)
The dissociation product, NaF, dissolves in the NaBF,. The
system described by the above equation is bivariant; thus,
a constant partial pressure of BF; above the melt requires
that the temperature and the melt composition both be
constant. For reaction (1) the BF; pressure is related to

the composition of the melt by the equation:

a

P =
BF, NaF

where K is the equilibrium constant and aj is activity. The
temperature dependence of K has been derived from experimental

data’ and is given by

 

-29,800 + 26.41 (3)

In K (in atm) =
RT (in 9K) R
[29,800 cal and 26.41 cal (°k)~! are the enthalpy and entropy
of the reaction; R, the gas constant, is 1.98717 cal (°k)-t
(g-mole)™!].
A consequence of the bivariance of the NaBF,-NaF system
is that the equilibrium BF; vapor pressure is difficult to
predict for melts in which the concentration of NaBF, is very

large (>98 mole %). For these concentrations, a is
NaBF,

virtually unity, but ANaF is very small (<0.1); hence, by wa
equation (2), P

35

BF tends to be quite high. Thus for any
3

experiment in which crystalline NaBF, is encapsulated, the

temperature of the sample should be kept as low as necessary

or else sufficient vapor space should be included so as to

permit the dissociation reaction (1) to occur.

The rather large uncertainty in the gas solubilities can

be rationalized from the following considerations:
40

a. Experimentall™3 and calculated (using the equation
given in the previous paragraph) solubilities agreed
to within a factor of three,

b. Calculated solubilities depend exponentially on the
assumed value of the surface tension; for the salts

Solubilities of BF; were assumed to be analogous to
solubilities of HF. For LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-ThF,-UF, (65-28-5-1-1

negative temperature dependence (inert-gas solubilities in
fluoride melts are much smaller and show positive temperature
dependence). The ratio of BF; to HF solubility in the range

500-800°C for this melt was the multiple used to estimate the
42

bility.>

Solubility of HF in F;-F, was estimated by assuming the
