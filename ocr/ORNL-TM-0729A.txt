I. MSRE INSTRUMENTATION AND CONTROL SYSTEM — GENERAL
1.1 INTRODUCTORY REMARKS

Instrumentation is required by the MSRE to provide information and
control for routine operations, to obtain experimental data, and to
protect against hazard or damage to personnel or equipment resulting
from abnormal conditions.

Both nuclear and nonnuclear instrumentation are used for measure-
ment, for control, and for protection; however, because of the nature
of the system, nonnuclear instrumentation predominates. Vital oper-
ational instrumentation on the MSRE is that which measures and controls
levels, flows, and temperatures of molten salts, helium gas, cooling air,
and water and which is required for operation and control of the auxil-
jary systems.

Two grades of instrumentation, control grade and safety grade, are
found in the MSRE. Control-grade instrumentation is used where a fail-
ure of control or a loss of information or protective action (though
undesirable) can be tolerated. Safety-grade instrumentation is used
where such failures or losses cannot be accepted. The choice between
the two systems is based on considerations of cost vs consequences.
Safety-grade systems involve the use of redundant, relisble instruments
and interconnections and tend to be much more expensive than control-
grade systems. Hence safety-grade instruments are used only where nec-
essary; control-grade instrumentation predominates.

The experimental nature of the reactor has increased the instrumen-
tation requirements if compared to a power reactor. In some cases e€X-
perimental data are obtained from instrumentation required for operation;
however, in many cases, additional instrumentation was installed pri-
marily for data. A second-generation, nonexperimental version of the
MSRE will require less instrumentation.

The MSRE system, ® the components comprising the system, and its
nuclear and operating characteristics have been fully described pre-
viously.?™? It is not inappropriate to introduce a description of the

 

lThe MSRE has been operating since June 1, 1965, and as of May 9,
J 2
1967, had developed a total of 32,654 Mwhr.

MSRE instrumentation and control system by repeating some of the essen-
tial features of the MSRE.

Figure 1.1.1 is a pictorial drawing of the reactor installation,
and Fig. 1.1.2 is a schematic drawing of the primary and secondary
molten-salt loops in which nuclear power is generated and transferred.
The primary (fuel) salt is a mixture of fluorides of lithium, beryllium,
and zirconium with sufficient uranium fluoride to achieve criticality at
the desired temperature. Several compositions of salt are under con-
sideration for the MSRE, 2 differing principally in the concentration of
Es as a consequence of the degree of enrichment in 235y. The use of
233y is also being studied. These variations or changes in composition
are not expected to affect the design of the instrumentation and con-
trols.

The coolant salt, containing no uranium, is similar to the fuel
salt in its nonnuclear characteristics. The use of sodium fluoroborate
coolant salt®:7 is under consideration, but this experiment is expected
to have little or no effect on the instrumentation.

Table 1.1.1 gives the composition and characteristics of the fuel
and coolant salts currently (March 1966) being used in the MSRE.

Since these salts are frozen below 840°F, it is necessary to apply
heaters to the tanks and the piping throughout the salt systems.

Figure 1.1.3 shows the reactor core vessel after assembly. The re-
actor is graphite-moderated, with the grephite in the form of long
vertical bars, or stringers. These stringers are essentially square in
cross section with grooves cut into the four faces to channel the flow.
Figure 1.1.4 is a horizontal cross section through the axial center line
of the core, showing the shape of the graphite moderator bars and the
location of the control rods.

Whereas the fuel is a homogeneous salt, the core itself has many of
the nuclear characteristics of a heterogeneous reactor. Table 1.1.2
lists some of the nuclear parameters of interest to the control and safety
system designer. ?’

Control rods are employed for both safety and routine operational
control. Nuclear excursions are not incredible, but none have been
postulated that cannot be. averted by well-established techniques using
a reliable protective system.

Both the fuel and coolant salt loops are blanketed and purged with
flowing helium at a slight positive pressure, nominally 5 psig. This
is accomplished in the salt pumps, which are designed to provide a gas
space for the helium; see Fig. 1.1.5. The volute around the pump im-
peller is enclosed in a larger tank, the pump bowl. The pump bowl is

kept about half filled with fresh circulating salt by means of a bypass oO
flow of 50 to 65 gpm (~5.0%) around the pump. The salt, at pump outlet
pressure, is delivered to the relatively quiescent volume in the pump
bowl through a toroidal spray ring which allows the escape of gaseous
materials from the salt. These released gases, composed mainly of
fission products and, perhaps, hydrocarbons, are carried to the off-gas
system by a continuous flow of helium which sweeps across the free salt
surface in the pump bowl. Hydrocarbons, if present, will originate with
small leaks in the lubricating oil seals in the pumps.

While MSRE fuel at 1200°F has & vapor pressure of only 4.47 X 1073
mm Hg, the 5-psig overpressure substantially reduces the amount of long-
term salt carry-over into the off-gas system; it also helps to prevent
large-scale contamination of the pump itself by salt deposition. The
gas spaces in the pump bowl and the overflow tank provide extra volume
for fuel expansion from excessive temperature should the need arise.

A second helium flow is used to purge the lubricating and cooling
oil passages in the pump to prevent the entry of contaminants from the
pump bowl.

Helium is used as a cover gas in the fuel and coolant salt drain
and storage tanks and, by increasing the pressure, becomes the driving
force used to fill the circulating loops.

The off-gas system conveys the helium from the tanks and the pump
bowls to particle traps, filters, charcoal beds, etc., and thence to
discharge via the off-gas stack.

In addition to the main nuclear heat rejection system, described in
Sect. 2.8, auxiliary cooling is required in the reactor and drain tank
cells. The ambient air temperature in these cells is maintained at 150°F oO
or less by two air-to-water space coolers. Direct forced air cooling is
used on the freeze valves and on the control rods and their drives. This
forced air pumping system is also used to evacuate the reactor and drain
tank cells to their operating pressure of —2.0 psig. The in-cell cooling
water system is used to cool such in-cell components as the thermal
shield, salt pump motors, and space coolers.

Fuel additions and the removal of samples for analyses are made with
the sampler-enricher. This is a device connected with a pipe to the fuel
salt pump bowl and which, of necessity, penetrates all containment barriers.

Freeze valves are used in the interconnecting salt pipelines between
the various tanks and the reactor vessel. A length of flattened pipe
that can be cooled and heated is a conceptual and perhaps oversimplified
description of a freeze valve. Valve closure is obtained by freezing a
salt plug in the flattened portion of the pipe.

The complex of reliable instrumented subsystems used solely for pro-
tection forms the MSRE safety system. In the MSRE the protection may be
categorized as (1) protection against nuclear excursions, (2) protection
against loss of containment, and (3) protection of vital equipment.

From the standpoint of extent and quantity, a majority of the safety
system instrumentation is in category 2. These are process-type instru-
ments based on measurements of pressure and radiation level. Their out-
put actions are to close valves, shut down pumps, etc., in lines which
are possible escape routes for contamination.

The preceding paragraphs highlight those features of the MSRE that
are of particular interest to the instrumentation and controls designer. oO
 

Two of the major problem areas created by the reactor system's design
are containment and temperature (its measurement, control, display, and
recording).

The first containment barrier, cladding, always present in a
heterogeneous reactor, is missing. This placed more stringent require-
ments on the instruments used to measure pressures and levels inside the
reactor loop. The problems were magnified by the higher than usual tem-
peratures encountered in this service. Obtaining high-grade satisfactory
measurements of important flows, pressures, levels, and temperatures is
complicated by the general requirement that the number of primary con-
tainment penetrations be minimum and, even more so, by the environments
of molten salt, fission products, and radiation inside the primary con-
tainment or in the coolant salt loop, where measurements involve either
molten fuel or coolant salt.

It is impossible to operate the MSRE and not breach the primary snd
secondary containment volumes with process lines for helium, air, and
water (Fig. 1.1.6). In many cases these containment penetrations violate
design criteria unless they are capable of being reliably blocked with
instrumented systems when potential hazards are detected; hence the ex-
tent of the process-type instruments in the safety systems and the
extensive use of sensors and transducers designed to meet containment
requirements. In addition, wide variations of reactor and drain tank
cell temperatures and pressures complicated the containment aspects of
pressure-measuring instruments since this large and convenient contained
volume could not serve as a stable reference.

To a degree the apparent emphasis on problems of containment is a
result of the inherent characteristics of unclad, fluid-fueled reactor
systems. However, the design of the MSRE was complicated by having to
shoehorn it into an existing facility with size and general configuration
less than ideal. This housing situation generated additional design
problems with both the reactor system and the instrumentation and con-
trols. Auxiliary systems for air, oil, water, helium, and emergency
power are of necessity spread out and remotely located, cable and piping
runs tend to be long and tortuous, power and signal cables could not be
properly separated, and it was not feasible to put all the controls in
one central area. Instead, some of the auxiliaries are provided with
local control panels that are periodically supervised by the operators.
These problems of interconnecting and integrating the various subsystems
into an operating entity would have been substantially reduced in a
facility engineered specifically for the MSRE. In particular, problems
of containment and the amount of instrumentation for containment could
have been substantially reduced.

Temperatures throughout the two salt systems are the most numerous
and possibly the most vital single type of measurement in the MSRE. Both
salt systems (freeze valves excepted) must be maintained above the freezing
temperature (850°F) and should not exceed 1300°F. This upper temperature
limit? is based on stress and metallurgical considerations and, depending
on location, a reasonable and safe allowance for fuel expansion caused by

any unscheduled temperature excursion. Stress producing temperature ,
gradients are to be avoided. If salt freezes, it may rupture the con- o
taining pipe or vessel on remelting. The coolant salt radiator is par-

ticularly vulnersble in this respect. Accurate, reliable temperature

information is essential to successful operation of the afterheat removal

system, to freeze valve operation, to heat balance calculations, to re-

activity balance calculations, to all operations involving criticality,

to routine operational controls, and as input information to the safety

system.

There are over 1050 thermocouples installed on the MSRE. A prepon-
derance of these are on the salt loops, on the storage and drain tanks,
and on associated piping. These salt systems are equipped with many
manually controlled heaters; safe and effective control is only possible
if the operators have & clear, reliable picture or profile of temperatures
in the system and if they are assisted by suiteble off-limit interlocks
and alarms. For these reasons, high-speed temperature scanning and dis-
play and continuous data logging are extensively used. These logging and
display systems also provide off-1limit alarms. It is worth while to note
that these temperature instrumentation systems are most intensively used
when the salt loops are being heated prior to filling or before taking
the reactor to power. When the reactor is on line and generating power,
the loop temperatures become more uniform and certain; hence the control
and monitoring problem is sharply reduced.

Other areas which called for more than usual care in design or for
nonroutine solutions are:

1. measuring and controlling low flows of helium and off-gas to and \
from the cover-gas system, -

2. measuring helium cover-gas pressure in the fuel salt pump bowl,
3. measuring salt level in the pump bowls,

4. measuring coolant salt flow rate,

5. measuring and controlling salt levels in the drain tanks,

6. designing containment penetrations for instrument lines,

7. designing in-cell instrumentation and related disconnects, piping,
and wiring to accommodate remote maintenance requirements.

It was recognized at the onset of the MSRE design that suitable and
eminently satisfactory instrumentation for some of these measurements
was nonexistent. Therefore, in some cases the methods and components now
in use have developmental status.

Sections 1.2 to 1.5 are concerned with broad and quite general

"descriptions which are intended to convey design philosophy and criteria.

Detailed descriptions of MSRE instrumentation and control are contained
in Sects. 2 to 8. The outline which follows will give the reader an
idea as to the scope and the arrangement of this report.

1.2 DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

l.2.1 Introduction

The design of the MSRE instrumentation and controls system and the
selection, procurement, and/or development of components involved con-
sideration of & number of operational, safety, and physical require-
ments. Table 1.2.1 lists the more important considerations, together
with an indication of the design areas in which these considerations
apply. In many cases, these considerations are similar to those en-
countered in the design of industrial plants and research facilities,
such as high-temperature liquid-metals systems, chemical processing
plants, petroleum refineries, and other types of nuclear reactors.
Wherever possible, the design was based on existing technology, and
components were procured from commercial sources of supply; however, in
some cases, individual considerations (or combinations of considerations)
presented problems which required special design or the development of
special components. A discussion of the considerations listed in Table
1.2.1 is presented in the following paragraphs.

1.2.2 Operational Requirements
1.2.2.1 Compatibility with Centralized Control Philosophy

As discussed in Sect. 1.3.1, the MSRE instrumentation is centralized
in the main control area so that the information and controls needed for
routine operation of the reactor are immediately available to the oper-
ator. This philosophy of operation dictates that modular-type systems
with signal transmission from primary element to receivers and from con-
trollers to final control elements be used rather than integral field-
mounted systems. For example, in the MSRE pressure transmitters and
receiver indicators are sometimes used when a simple pressure gage would
have sufficed for a noncentralized system. This example, however,
should not imply that all the measured variables are transmitted to the
main control area. There are, in fact, many direct-reading field in-
struments, such as pressure gages, rotameters, thermometers, etc., in
use in the MSRE. This type of instrumentation is used mainly where the
instrument is located in an accessible area, usage is low, and quick
access to information is not required. Where frequent or fast access to
information is required; where containment, personnel safety, or basic
instrument installation requirements dictate that the primary sensing
elements be located in inaccessible areas; or where transmitted signals
are required for operation of controls or interlocks or for logging of
data, transmitters are used and the receiving equipment is located in
the central control area. or in other centralized locations such as the
transmitter room and various field panels (see Sect. 1.3.1).

Similar considerations apply to the selection of final control ele-
ments. Where the final control elements are located in inaccessible
areas or where control is either automatic or restricted by control

interlocks, remotely controlled pneumatic or electric actuators are
used.

Where frequent control adjustments are required, where the operator
must have quick access to the control, or where it is desirable to pre-
vent operation of the control element by persons other than the reactor
operator, the control signal originates in control devices (automatic
controllers, control interlocks, manually operated switches, etc.)
located in the main control area.

Where centralized control is not required, the final control ele-
ments are operated either directly by hand or indirectly by means of
control devices mounted individually on local control stations or grouped
on field panels.

1.2.2.2 Ease of Operation

The layout of control areas, the placement of instruments and con-
trols within control areas, and the selection of receiving instruments,
control switches, etc., were strongly affected by considerations of
operator convenience and ease of operation. Insofar as possible, con-
trols and adjustments needed for routine operations of the reactor were
placed on the central control console, and the receiving instruments
which provide the information required for routine operation were lo-
cated on either the console or the main control board.

To reduce the need for frequent reference to flowsheets and to re-

"duce the chances of operational error, a graphic presentation was used

in the layout of the main control board and of the jumper board. This
graphic presentation is also a valuable aid in training of operators.
As nearly as possible and consistent with other considerations, the
prime space in the center of the main control board and console was re-
served for the most important instrumentation and controls components.
Components of lesser importance were located in auxiliary control areas
or in the field. Instrument components and control devices on the
graphic panel were placed so that they are visually associated with
specific components or portions of the reactor system. Attention was
also given to the vertical placement of components so that receiving
instruments could be easily read from various positions in the control
room and so that control switches would be within reach of an operator
of average height.

Where a given operation requires frequent simultaneous observations
of a receiving instrument and operation of control switches or adjust-
ments, the controls and adjustments were located near the receiving in-
strument and were placed so that the receiving instrument would not be
obscured by the operator's arms.

To implement the above design objectives and to minimize space re-
quirements in the control areas, attention was given to the physical
size of instrument components mounted in the control boards. In general,
preference was given to small-sized instrument components where the use
of such components was consistent with other considerations. Attention
was also given to readability in the selection of receiving devices such
as recorders and indicators.

 
 

20

Where possible and consistent with other considerations, systems -
were automated to relieve the operator of the necessity of performing
numerous manual operations and thus free him to devote more time to the
more important aspects of reactor operation. For example, the freeze
valve circuits were designed to perform "freeze" and "thaw" operations
automatically. Also a number of other variables, such as helium inlet
purge flow, which might have been amenable to manual control are
automatically controlled.
Further simplification of operations was obtained by use of the
Computer-Data Logger described in Sect. 2.12.

1.2.2.3 Flexibility

The experimental nature of the MSRE dictated that the design of the
instrumentation and control systems be flexible, that is, that it be
amenable to change. To accomplish this objective the use of point-to-
point wiring was avoided, and control circuit interconnections were made
at centralized locations in the relay cabinets. Similarly, most thermo-
couples were routed to a patch panel in the main control area, where
they were connected to readout instrumentation by patch cords. Further
flexibility was provided by the use of ORNL standard modular hardware
for fabrication of control panels and by selection of instrument compo-
nents which permits ranges to be changed and control switches to be reset
easily in the field. In addition to gaining the capability to change
the system design after startup of the reactor, the flexibility designed
into the system was of great value during the initial design since it “
permitted portions of the system to be designed, fabricated, and in-
stalled before the final design criteria were established.

1.2.2.4 Experimental Data

The requirements for experimental data from the MSRE resulted in
more instrumentation than would be required for a nonexperimental
(second-generation) reactor of the same type. Also, in many cases, the
accuracy requirements imposed by the need for experimental data were
greater than would have been required by process control considerations
alone. Since the data inputs to the Computer-Data logger are electrical
(de) voltages, first preference was given to the use of electrical
transmission systems in these applications. However, in some applica-
tions, such as weigh cells, it was found that the use of pneumatic
transmitters offered significant advantages. In these cases strain-gage
pressure transducers were used to interface the pneumatic systems with
the Computer-Data Logger.

1.2.2.5 Remote Maintenance

The requirement that all major components located within biological
shielding or containment be amenable to remote servicing or removal and
replacement was a primary consideration in the design of instrumentation
 

 

21

systems and the selection of instruments in these areas. In general, the
design philosophy was to locate instrument components outside biological
shielding so that they could be maintained directly. Where this was not
possible, provisions were made for remote removal and replacement, or
adequate operating and installed spares were provided. The major problem
encountered in providing remote maintenance capabilities for in-cell
instruments was the development of disconnect devices and methods of
mounting instrument components. Disconnects were required for pneumatic
tubing, electrical power wiring, and for low-level electrical signals.
Because of the quantity involved, providing thermocouple disconnect
capability required the greatest effort. With the exception of the
weigh cell mountings, the design of in-cell instrument mountings did not
present any special problems. The design of the weigh cell mountings
required special attention because side loads must not be impressed on
the cell and because the cells must be aligned so that the direction of
force is parallel to the center line of the cell (see Sect. 6.6).

Remote maintenance requirements also imposed severe restrictions on
the design of in-cell instrumentation and control systems. To permit
unrestricted vertical access for tools and for component removal, in-
strument components were located and associated wiring and tubing were
routed in a manner that would not interfere with these operations.

1.2.2.6 Maintainability

Consideration was given to the maintainability of all instruments
whether located in-cell or not. Whenever a choice between instrument
component types existed and other considerations were equal, preference
was given to the type that was easiest to maintain. Plug-in instruments
were used extensively. The use of this type of instrument permits quick
replacement of faulty components with minimum disturbance of operations
and subsequent repalr of the faulty components in field or central
shops. Attention was also given to the location of instrument compo-
nents to ensure that they would be physically accessible for maintenance.
Wherever possible, provisions were made so that components could be
tested, adjusted, or replaced without excessive disturbance of operations.

1.2.3 Safety Requirements

1.2.3.1 Containment

Since many of the primary instrument elements associated with meas-
urement of variables in the reactor system are attached to, or require
penetrations of, the reactor primary or secondary containment, these
instruments and/or associated lines are, in themselves, a part of con-
tainment. To avoid compromising the reactor containment, special pre-
cautions were required in the selection of these components and in the
design of associated systems.

The MSRE containment criteria require the presence of two inde-
pendent barriers against the release of activity. Preferably these

 
 

22

barriers would consist of fixed barriers such as a pipe or a vessel :
wall; however, the need for piping connections to auxiliary systems and w
for transmission of instrumentation and control information to and from

the in-cell reactor system dictated that containment barriers be pene-

trated.

In general, the measurement of varigbles within the secondary con-
tainment involves the penetration of at least one containment barrier.
However, in cases such as measurement of nuclear flux and process ra-
diation, the desired information is obtained without penetrating either
primary barrier. In other cases, such as measurement of primary system
temperatures, drain tank weight, and pump speed, only secondary contain-
ment penetrations are required.

Penetrationst may take the form of electrical penetrations, piping
penetrations, or special penetrations that are physically a part of the
containment vessel, with the type of penetration being determined by the
type of signal transmitted. Such penetrations were made in a manner
that did not seriously degrade the integrity of the containment barrier
or were provided with instrumented closures that will restore the in-
tegrity of the barrier if unsafe conditions occur (see Sect. 1.5).

The most difficult penetrations to close or protect were those
associated with piping penetrations of primary containment. Weld-sealed
(helium leak-tight) construction is used on all instrument components
associated with such penetrations; connections are made by means of
butt welds, leak-detected ring-joint flanges, or "autoclave" (or
equivalent) connectors; and valves are provided with welded bellows stem
seals.

In all cases where weld-sealed construction was required, the compo- Oo
nents were designed and tested to ensure that leakage through the body
was less than 1078 cm® of helium per second under conditions of 50 psig
internal pressurization. Also, those valves which form a part of the
primary blocking system were designed and tested to have very tight
shutoff characteristics (see Sects. 6.5 and 6.20).

Wherever possible, the instrument systems having primary system
penetrations are designed to dead-end the penetration in a sealed compo-
nent located inside the secondary containment. However, in some MSRE
instrument systems, the penetration extends through both primary and
secondary containment barriers. Examples of such penetrations are the
helium purge lines associated with measurement of level and pressure in
the fuel salt system and with the leak detection system used to deter-
mine whether sampler-enricher valves and ports are closed and sealed
(see Sects. 3.12 and 6.8). A similar type of penetration is found in
the lines connecting the drain-tank pressure transmitters to drain
tanks. This latter example differs from the preceding one in that the

 

1In some cases, such as the helium flow elements, the coolant salt
flow venturi, valves, and the helium flow restrictors, the instrument
components are an integral part of the system piping, and the required
penetrations may be made on the instrument component rather than on the
system piping. For the purpose of this discussion it will be considered
that the component itself is the penetration and the connections to the
component are extensions of the penetration.

C
 

23

lines also serve as process lines which are used to pressurize the drain
tanks during filling and transfer operations. Similarly, the purge lines
that supply helium purge flow to the reactor as well as the flow elements
and differential pressure cells associated with measurement of flow in
these lines are part of the primary containment. In all the above cases,
reliance is placed on the flow of helium purge gas to prevent the back
diffusion of activity, with check valves and instrumented closures being
provided to prevent the escape of activity. In general, the rule was
used that two block valves or one block valve and one check valve were
equal to one barrier. In some cases, two series check valves were in-
stalled, but in the primary system the use of redundant check valves
alone was not considered to be adequate protection. Weld-sealed solenoid
and pneumatically operated valves of the type discussed in Sects. 6.5
and 6.20 were used to provide the instrumented closures of these lines.
Blocking action is initiated via the electrical control circuitry in the
event of occurrence of unsafe conditions such as high activity in process
lines, low helium supply pressure, high reactor cell pressure, etc.
Operation of these protective systems is discussed in more detail in
Sect. 1.5.

Other examples of instrument components that form a part of primary
containment are the pneumatic and hand-operated valves located in primary
system piping, the charcoal bed differential pressure cell, and the
conductivity-type drain-tank level probe (discussed in Sect. 6.10). The
drain-tank level probes are an example of an instrument penetration where
the instrument component is physically a part of the containment vessel.

The most numerous (and fortunately the easiest to seal) penetrations
of MSRE containment are those required for the 495 thermocouples attached
to pipes and vessels within the secondary containment. These penetrations
are closed by using ceramic (or glass) to metal feed-through seals inside
and epoxy seals outside of the reactor containment vessel and biological
shield (see Sect. 6.7). Similar techniques are used for sealing elec-
trical penetrations required for in-cell heater, motor, signal, and con-
trol wiring. Examples of devices requiring electrical signal penetration
of secondary containment are given below:

Primary system pressure and differential pressure transmitters

Primary system solenoid valves

Fuel salt pump speed pickups

Fuel salt pump microphones

In-cell valve position switches

Conductivity level probes

Primary system thermocouples

Rod Drives

At this point it should be noted that, with the possible exception
of the conductivity level probes, there are no electrical penetrations
of primary containment in the MSRE heated salt systems. This lack of

electrical penetration of salt system primary containment is due partly
to the lack of a suitable feed-through penetration seal and partly to

 

 
 

 

24
the fact that the high temperatures, high radiation, and low salt con-
ductivity associated with the primary system tended to discourage the -

use of electrical techniques for measurement inside the primary system.

The next most numerous penetrations are the instrument piping
penetrations of the secondary containment required for operation of
valves, weigh systems, etc., within the secondary containment. With a
few exceptions, these lines connect to closed systems or instrument com-
ponents and are essentially inward extensions of secondary containment.
To protect against possible rupture of these lines in the event of the
maximum credible accident, a blocking system is provided which will
close these lines if the reactor cell pressure rises above atmospheric
(see Sect. 1.5). Some instrument penetrations of secondary containment
vent directly to the space inside secondary containment and connect to
components outside containment. These form an outward extension of
secondary containment. Where the lines are short and the construction
of the components satisfies the requirements for containment, as is the
case for the pressure switches used in the blocking system, no blocking
protection is provided. However, where the connecting lines are long
or where the components do not meet the containment requirement, block
valves operated by the systems discussed in Sect. 1.5 are provided.

Instrument components that form a part of secondary containment
are, for the most part, standard commercially available items; however,
consideration was given in their selection to maintenance of minimum
overall leakage of the secondary containment. While containment require-
ments for these components were much less stringent than for components
that formed a part of the primary containment system, more attention was
given to the leak-tightness of these components than was given to similar -
components not associated with containment. Gasketed construction and
standard tubing and pipe fittings were considered acceptable in most
applications; however, the components were tested before installation,
and systems were tested after installation to ensure that leakage was
acceptably low. Although weld-sealed construction was not required for
secondary containment, many components of the helium, lube oil, sampler-
enricher, coolant salt, and chemical processing systems were weld-sealed
and tested for helium leak-tightness to conserve helium; to prevent re-
lease of activity from potentially dirty systems (such as the lube oil,
chemical processing, and coolant salt systems); to minimize the possi-
bility of inleakage of oxygen to the heated salt systems during periods
of abnormal operation; and to maintain the performance characteristics
of the instrument system. In some cases, weld-sealed components were
used because they were commercially availeble at costs comparable with
similar components using standard construction.

Examples of instrument components of secondary containment using
standard construction are:

1. block valves in the cell penetration blocking system, 2

 

2Wherever possible, valves were installed so that the pressure (or
reactor) side of the valve was under the seat. Also, "fail-closed"
(air-to-open) operator action was used so that loss of supply air pressure
would cause valves to close. oO

 

 
 

25

2. all components in the cooling water systems,
3. pressure regulators in the helium supply system,

4. pneumatically operated off-gas system valves downstream of the
charcoal beds? (these valves were, however, ordered with weld
nipple connections and were welded into the system),

5. solenoid block valves in the chemical process system sampler, ?
6. drain tank weigh cells and associated piping (special attention,
beyond that required for containment, was given to the leak-

tightness of this system to obtain maximum accuracy),

7. some components connecting to penetrations of the outer barrier of
the fuel sampler-enricher and chemical processing system sampler.

Examples of instrument components of secondary containment using
weld-sealed, helium leak-tight construction are:

1. All components of the helium supply system and associated purge and
supply lines, except regulators. Included in this category are
pressure switches; flow elements; differential pressure and pressure
transmitters; control valves; hand control valves in the bubbler
purge lines; and capillary flow restrictors in the sampler-enricher
purge lines, in the fuel and coolant system bubbler purge lines, and
in the main helium supply to the fuel salt system drain tanks.

 

2. Flow elements, capillary flow restrictors, and differential pressure
transmitters in upper gas letdown lines from the fuel and coolant
salt circulating pumps.

 

3. All fuel and coolant lube oil system instrument components except
the oil tank level transmitters. Included in this category are flow
elements, pressure and differential pressure transmitters, control
valves, and pressure switches. The level transmitters utilize
gasketed construction but were shop tested for leak-tightness before
installation.

 

4, Components of the chemical processing system associated with reactor
secondary containment and with containment of radioactive salts and
gases during chemical processing operations. In addition to those
components covered in item 1 above, this category includes the ultra
sonic level probe, described in Sect. 6.11, and pressure and differ-
ential pressure transmitters, flow elements, and pressure switches
in the associated HF, Fy, N2, Hp, and SO; gas supply systems. In
general, a quality level intermediate between the weld-sealed con-
struction required for reactor primary containment and the gasketed
construction allowed in secondary containment was used in the chemical
process system. For example, silver solder was accepted in lieu of
welding, and Hoke type 5-26 fittings were accepted in lieu of auto-
clave-type connections. Gasketed construction and standard tubing
and piping fittings were not acceptable in this service because of
the relatively high activity that will be present in the system
during fuel processing operations.

 
 

26

5. Components of the chemical process sampler connecting to inner con-
tainment barriers. Although, for containment. purposes, the quality
of construction required in this system is the same as that for the
chemical processing system, many components in this category have a
higher quality of construction than required because of sampler
operational requirements and because the chemical process sampler
was originally the prototype for the fuel sampler-enricher. Instru-
mentation for this system is discussed in more detail in Sect. 3.12.

6. Components of the coolant salt system associated with reactor second-
ary containment. In addition to those components covered by items
1 to 3 above, this category includes the ball float level transmitter
described in Sect. 6.9, the coolant salt venturi described in Sect.
6.13, the NaK-filled differential transmitter described in Sect. 6.12,
the coolant-salt drain-tank supply vent and bypass valves, the coolant
pump-bowl pressure transmitter, the coolant-salt drain-tank pressure
transmitter, and the coolant-salt pump bubbler-level system. Weld-
sealed construction was used in these applications because of the
consideration of conservation of helium and exclusion of oxygen
noted previously and because of the high operating temperature of
the venturi, NaK-filled differential pressure transmitter, and the
ball-float level transmitter. Because the coolant salt system is
considered secondary containment, less protection was provided on
the coolant-salt helium-supply purge and vent lines than was pro-
vided on similar lines in the fuel system.

From the above discussion, it should be noted that operational con-
siderations, in many cases, dictated a quality of construction greater
than that dictated by the containment considerations. Also, it should
be noted that no mention has been made of sealing or closure of penetra-
tions associated with signal and control wires or tubing for those in-
strument components that form a part of secondary containment. In almost
all such cases the components are installed so that the bodies of the
components form outward extensions of secondary containment and no
penetrations were required. In the case of the few exceptions (notably
the cell radiation monitors, cell ambient temperature thermocouples, and
some components of the sampler-enricher and chemical process sampler),
the signals are electrical, and the required seals are made by means of
feed-through penetration seals.

With the exception of the cell ambient temperature thermocouples
noted above, the measurement of temperature in the secondary containment
systems posed no containment problems since all such measurements were
made by means of thermocouples located on the outside of pipes and
vessels (or in wells), and no penetrations were required. Other possible
exceptions to the above are the thermocouples installed on the charcoal
beds and the off-gas sampler (see Sects. 3.5 and 6.7). Penetration seals
are provided where these thermocouples penetrate enclosures; however,
since the enclosures are vented to the stack, these seals should probably
be considered part of building containment rather than secondary contain-
ment.

1.2.3.2 Redundancy, Separation, and Identification

As discussed in subsequent sections of this report, the instrumenta-
tion and control systems assoclated with reactor safety are required to
be redundant. In the MSRE, this redundancy is in the form of one-out-of-
two or two-out-of-three logic. ORNL practices require that all compo-
nents, wiring, and tubing be installed so that redundant safety channels
are physically separated from each other and from control-grade compo-
nents, wiring, and tubing and that safety channels be identified as such.
Where possible, separation was accomplished by means of separate con-
duits, wireways, junction boxes, cabinets, and metallic barriers. In
some cases, complete separation was not possible, and physical separa-
tion with appropriate identification (painted signs, labeling, and color
coding) was used.

1.2.3.3 Hazards to Operating Personnel

Attention was given to providing protection against hazards to oper-
ating personnel beyond that provided by the reactor safety system.
Wiring was installed in accordance with the National Electric Code and
with ORNL recommended practices. Instrument lines that presented possible
pressure or radiation hazards were either protected or confined to areas
not normally accessible to operating personnel.

1.2.4 Performance Characteristics

1.2.4.1 Overall Accuracy

Accuracy was a prime consideration in the selection of instrumenta-
tion associated with the acquisition of experimental data and with some
process and nuclear control systems. However, in reactor safety systems,
accuracy was considered to be secondary to relisbility. Also, in many
process instrumentation applications, high accuracy was not required, and
accuracy was considered to be secondary to other considerations, particu-
larly cost. Since accuracy is a poorly understood and often misused
term, the performance requirements for those instruments associated with
the acquisition of high-accuracy data or information were specified in
terms of individual performance characteristics such as linearity, zero
drift, span shift, hysteresis, ambient temperature and pressure effects,
process temperature and pressure effects, etc. In general, an effort was
made to match accuracy specifications to the application; however, in
some applications, considerations of minimization of the number of instru-
ment types used and reduction in requirements for operating spares re-
sulted in the use of instruments having a higher accuracy than required.

1.2.4.2 Reliability

Reliability was a prime consideration in the selection of all instru-
ment components and was of particular importance in the selection of re-
actor safety system components. However, since obtaining high reliability

 
 

 

 

28

can be very expensive, the degree of reliability needed for a particular
component was based, in general, on considerations of "cost vs conse-
quences." Where high reliability was needed, reliability requirements
were incorporated in the specifications, and components were tested before
and after installation. Where moderate religbility was sufficient,
selection of component was based on experience and engineering judgment,
and performance was proved during system shakedown testing and subsequent
operations. At this point the distinction between component reliability
and system reliability should be noted. As discussed in the following
section, overall reliability can be enhanced by the use of redundancy

in system design. Conversely, improper use of redundancy can reduce the
overall system reliability below that of the individual components.

1.2.4.3 Failure Modes

Insofar as possible, components of the safety system (and of most
control systems) were selected and installed in such a manner as to
"fail safe." That is, the components were selected and systems were
designed to produce the desired corrective or control action in the
event of component failure or loss of supply power. A fail-safe action
is sometimes referred to as a "failure toward danger,” since such an
action appears to the controlled system as a dangerous condition and is
therefore in the safe direction. A single "failure toward danger” in a
system using two-of-three logic converts it to one-of-two logic. The
fail-safe mode of failure is the direct opposite of the "unsafe failure"
mode, which results either in an unsafe or undesired action or in no
action at all. Examples of the latter would be an upscale failure of
an instrument channel having a downscale trip, an open-circuited coil in
a relay which must be energized to produce the desired action, a welded
contact which must open to produce the desired action, and an "in-place"
failure of an instrument resulting in the controlled system remaining in
the state that it was in when the failure occurred. In~place failures
are characteristic of motorized equipment and occur mainly in servo-
controlled equipment such as potentiometric recorder-controllers. This
type of failure can be caused by loss of supply power, by desensitization
of amplifiers by excessive noise on the signal, by dirty slide-wires, or
by component failures.

It should be recognized at this point that an "unsafe failure" of
one channel in a safety system utilizing redundancy can be very serious.
In the case of systems using one-of-two logic, an "unsafe failure" of
one channel will convert the system to a "single-tracked" system with
full dependence for safety being placed on each and every component of
the remeining channel. The situation is even more critical in the case
of systems using two-of-three coincidence logic, since an "unsafe
failure" of one channel will convert the system to a two-of-two coinci-
dence logic system, with full dependence for safety being placed on each
and every component of both remaining channels. Routine testing is re-
quired to detect such conditions.

While fail-safe action is desirable, it is usually difficult or
impossible to obtain in practice. Few (if any) devices have only one
failure mode. For example, an otherwise fail-safe device or system in-
corporating a feedback loop will usually fail "unsafe if the feedback
 

 

29

loop is opened. Most devices have two possible modes, and some have more
(such as upscale, downscale, and in place). However, the devices will
usually have a "preferred" or "most probable" failure mode. Where one
mode is predominant the device is said to fail in this mode, and circuits
are designed accordingly. In some cases smbiguity of modes can be reduced
or eliminated by the use of "confidence" circuitry and monitoring devices
(such as "power-failure" relays), which produce a corrective action in
the safe direction in the event of the occurrence of a condition that
could result in an unsafe or unwarrented action. Although it is possible
to design around some undesirable failure modes, components and system
are, in general, too complex and too unpredictable to use this crutch
extensively. In the final analysis the use of fail-safe design tech-
niques must be recognized for what it is — a means for reducing the
probability of unsafe or unwarranted actions — and reliance must be
placed on the use of the principles of redundancy and diversity together
with surveillance, testing, and monitoring to obtain a level of reli-
ability commensurate with the requirements for reactor safety and con-
tinuity of operations.

1.2.5 Effects of Process Conditions

1.2.5.1 Operating Temperature

Temperature effects were an important consideration in the selection
of all primary sensing elements and were a primary consideration for
those components which were attached to the heated salt systems. In
these systems the 1200°F operating temperature presented problems which
necessitated the development of special instrumentation. In other MSRE
systems the temperatures were within the range where satisfactory per-
formance was obtainable with commercially available instrument compo-
nents. The effects of variations of temperature on accuracy and other
performance characteristics are of interest at low temperatures (below
150°F) and become increasingly important as the temperature increases.
At higher temperatures (above 300°F), damage to materials such as
plastics and elastomers becomes important; at elevated temperatures
(above 600°F) the general operability becomes a matter of concern. Also,
since corrosion is accelerated and structural strength of material is
degraded as the temperature is increased, the choice of materials be-
comes a prime consideration at elevated temperatures. The philosophy
adopted in the design of MSRE salt system instrumentation was to avoid
operation of instruments at high system temperatures wherever possible
and to obtain readings indirectly with instruments operated under more
favoreble conditions. Where this was not possible or desirable, de-
velopment of special instrumentation was initiated (see Sect. 6).

1.2.5.2 Operating Pressure

As in the case of temperature the effects of process operating pres-
sure and of pressure variations on performance characteristics and
structural strength become increasingly important as the pressure in-
creases. These pressure effects are most important in applications

 
 

30

where the operating temperature is high. Fortunately, MSRE pressures
are low (below 50 psig) in those portions of the system where tempera-
tures are @bove 150°F; so the required structural strength was, in most
cases, obtainable with a minimum of effort. Close attention to effects
of pressure was required in the selection or development of components
which operate at temperatures above 600°F, and in cases such as the
molten-salt level probes, the requirements for structural strength and
containment imposed severe restrictions on the design. In other cases,
such as the NaK-filled differential pressure transmitters, the effects
of pressure variations were the boundary conditions which limited the
accuracy of the instrument.

1.2.5.3 Corrosion

Corrosion was a prime consideration in the selection or development
of all instrument components which were exposed to process fluid. How-
ever, in all reactor systems except the fuel processing system, the
requirements for corrosion resistance were easily satisfied by use of
standard materials available for commercial components or by use of
INOR-8 (Hastelloy N) materials for developmental instruments,

In the fuel processing system the high corrosion rates expected
during fluorination precluded the use of the thin-walled conductivity
level probes for level detection in the fuel storage tank and forced a
redesign of the ultrasonic level probe to obtain adequate corrosion
allowance.

In some cases materials were used which gave corrosion resistance
beyond that dictated by the process conditions. This was done to permit
decontamination of components with acid rinses.

Exposure of components to corrosive conditions was avoided where
possible by obtaining readings indirectly with components operated under
more favorable conditions. For example, pressure in the fuel storage
tank was obtained by measurement of pressure in a purge line connecting
to the tank. This technique is similar to that used to avoid tempera-
ture problems (see Sect. 1.2.5.1).

Since corrosive conditions did not exist in the MSRE operating
areas, no special precautions were required for the selection of compo-
nents and design of systems located in these areas.

1.2.5.4 Salt Plugging and Vapor Deposition

Consideration was given to the possibility of plugging of instrument
lines with salt wherever these lines penetrated lines or vessels contain-
ing salt. Such plugs can occur as a result of expulsion of salt into
cold instrument lines or as a result of vapor deposition of salt in the
lines. Iines can also be plugged by formation of oxides where gas is
purged into the system below salt level.

The consequences of plugging range from minor to very serious,
since the resultant loss of information could further result in loss of
experimental data, loss of control, or loss of one or more channels of
safety protection.

During initial stages of MSRE design, it was believed that vapor
deposition and oxide formation might be very serious problems and might
preclude measurement of pressures, differential pressures, etc., with

C
 

31

instruments attached to purged gas lines. This belief was based on ex-
perience in earlier molten-salt systems in which considerable difficulty
with plugging was experienced. Further investigation revealed that the
vapor pressure of the MSRE salts and the expected oxygen content of the
MSRE cover gas would be much lower than those of previous systems. On
the basis of this information the indirect measurement approach was
adopted.

To minimize the possibility of plugging, all instrument lines which
penetrated salt-containing lines and vessels were made as large as was
consistent with other considerations, and instrument taps were located
as far above salt level as possible. In almost all cases MSRE instrument
components are located on inlet gas lines, and a small purge flow is
maintained in the lines. This purge flow also serves to minimize back
diffusion of radioactive gases. Some components, such as the fuel off-
gas letdown valve, the charcoal-bed differential-pressure transmitter,
and the fuel-pump gas-letdown flow transmitters, were located on lines
downstream of the reactor. In these cases the components were placed
as far downstream as possible and were protected by filters. In cases
such as the bubbler level indicator, where instrument lines are required
to extend below salt level, provisions were made to ensure that pressure
transients will not expel salt into cold lines (see Sect. 6.8).

Experience to date on the MSRE and on related engineering test
facilities indicates that the philosophy adopted was sound and that the
provisions made in the design to prevent plugging were adequate. Some
plugging has occurred in off-gas lines; however, this plugging was due
to hydrocarbon plugging and was not expected during the initial design.

While the MSRE instrumentation and controls system has been essen-
tially free of salt plugging problems, the need for purge flow, together
with other considerations (such as operating temperature and radiation
damage), resulted in a complexity of instrumentation beyond that re-
quired for the basic measurement. This increased complexity resulted
from the additional instrumentation needed to prevent the escape of
activity through instrument lines which penetrated both containment
barriers. If radiation-resistant transmitters capable of operating in
direct contact with the salt had been available, this complexity of
instrumentation (and the probability of salt plugging) would have been
reduced. NesK-filled transmitters offer promise for use in future -re-
actor systems, provided the possibility of release of NaK into the sys-
tem can be tolerated. Also the ball float level transmitter described
in Sect. 6.9 may be a satisfactory replacement for the bubbler-type
level system in some applications.

1.2.5.5 Electrical Resistivity of Molten Salts

The electrical resistivity of the MSRE fuel and coolant salts was
determined to be approximately 1 ohm-cm at 1200°F and 1 kilohertz
(1000 cps). While this resistivity indicates that the MSRE salt is
a fair conductor, it is high in comparison with the 120-microhm-cm
resistivity of Hastelloy N and Inconel and even higher in comparison
with the 35-microhm-cm resistivity of sodium and 80-microhm-cm re-
sistivity of NaK at 1200°F. Conversely, the resistivities of NaK and

 
 

 

32

sodium are low in comparison with Hastelloy N and Inconel. Therefore, |
while Inconel can be considered as a poor insulator in comparison with

NaK and sodium, Hastelloy N is a good conductor in comparison with the

MSRE salt. For this reason, devices such as magnetic flowmeters and

"J" probe type level indicators, which are used extensively in liquid-

metal systems, are not suiteble for use in the MSRE molten-salt systems.

However, the conductivity properties of the MSRE salt were utilized to

obtain single-point indications of level in the MSRE drain tanks (see

Sect. 6.10).

1.2.6 Environmental Effects

1.2.6.1 Ambient Temperature

Ambient temperature effects did not impose severe restrictions on
the selection or development of any MSRE instrument components, since
the in-cell ambient temperatures are kept below 150°F by the use of space
coolers and the temperatures in operating areas do not exceed 100°F.
(The main control areas are air-conditioned, and temperatures are kept
relatively constant at about 75°F). However, the effects of variations
of ambient temperature on the accuracy of measurements were important,
and they were considered during procurement of components and design of
the system. Also, in some areas where natural circulation was restricted
or density of heat-generating equipment was high, forced-draft air cooling
was required to maintain the ambient temperature of the components and ow
that inside the cabinets within acceptable limits.

1.2.6.2 Ambient Pressure

The effects of ambient pressure were important in the selection or
development of all components that were referenced, directly or indirect,
to atmospheric pressure or to in-cell pressures.

In some cases, such as determination of cell leak rate and monitoring
of building containment, the pressures themselves were of direct concern.
In all other cases, the interest lay in the effects of pressure on the
accuracy of the measurement.

Instrument components which are (or may be) sensitive to ambient
pressure generally fall into one of the following three categories:

1. those which sense the difference between an internal pressure and
the pressure of the surrounding medium and which generate a
mechanical or electrical signal or indication (pressure gages,
manometers, pressure switches, and pneumatic receivers);

2. those which convert a force, motion, or electrical signal into a
pneumatic pressure (current-to-pneumatic converters and pneumatic
valve positioners);

3. combination of 1 and 2 (pneumatic pressure transmitters and pneumatic
weigh cells).
 

33

Such instruments usually incorporate a bellows or a Bourdon tube in
the mechanism.

Pressure in the drain-tank cell can vary over a wide range (+5 to
—4 psig) during the course of normal operations. The pressure can vary
less in areas ventilated by the containment air system since pressures
in these areas are maintained slightly negative with respect to the
atmosphere (approximstely —0.2 to —2 in. H0 gage). Also, variations of
atmospheric pressure are of interest in many instances. Variations over
the range from 28.7 to 29.5 in. Hg were observed at the MSRE site over a
six-month period, and larger variations are possible during extreme
weather conditions. The observed variations correspond to approximately
0.5 psi. Although this value is small, it amounts to 1% of the 50-psig
measurement span of most MSRE pressure transmitters and 4% of the 12-psi
output signal span of 3- to 15-psig pneumatic transmitters.

The philosophy adopted in the design of the MSRE instrumentation and
controls system was to avoid the use of pressure-sensitive components in
areas where pressure variations occurred. Where this was not possible,
or where the use of pressure-sensitive components offered significant
advantages, the effects of pressure variations were eliminated by internal
compensation of the device or by correcting the data. The drain-tank
weigh cells are an example of the use of internal compensation. Data
correction was used to correct gage pressure data such as obtained from
the reactor cell pressure transmitter. Another form of compensation,
which is not usually recognized as such, is the location of associated
pneumatic transmitters and receivers in the same pressure environment.
Although this technique is common practice, significant errors can occur
when this effect is overlooked and transmitters and receivers are in-
stalled in areas having different ambient pressures.

1.2.6.3 Radiation Damage

All instrument components located within the reactor and drain
cells are subject to damage from nuclear radiation. However, some com-
ponents of the sampler-enricher, the chemical process system, the
chemical process system sampler, the off-gas system, and the off-gas
sampler are less subject to radiation damage. The radiation level in
the coolant salt and waste cells is relatively low, and radiation damage
in these areas was not considered serious. The maximum radiation levels
in various areas of the MSRE are listed in Tsble 1.2.2. The values
listed are for peak conditions and assume that activity in the system
has built up to saturation levels after sustained full-power operation.

In general, the selection of materials for use in high-radiation
areas was governed by considerations of total integrated dose rather than
dose rate, and the use of plastics and elastomers was limited to those
areas where the total gamma dose expected during the lifetime of the re-
actor was less than 107 r and the expected neutron dose was less than
1017 nvt. Where higher dosage was expected, component materials were
restricted to metals and inorganics. Exceptions to this rule are the
rod drive motors and all semiconductor devices. The rod drive motors
have organic insulation and lubricants and are designed to be replaceable.

Semiconductors are known to be extremely sensitive to both dose rate and
total dosage. The use of instrument components utilizing semiconductors
was restricted to areas outside biological shielding, where radiation
levels were expected to be relatively low. For example, the transistorized
amplifiers used with the Foxboro ECI pressure and differential pressure
transmitters were placed remote from the transmitter body when the trans-
mitter was located in a high-radiation area. In areas such as the fuel
sampler-enricher and the off-gas sampler, the maximum (peak) radiation
levels are very high but the duration of the peak is relatively short.

In these areas, radiation-resistant components and materials were pre-
ferred, but plastics and elastomers were permitted.

1.2.7 Physical Requirements

1.2.7.1 Weld-Sealed Construction

All instrument components which are an integral part of primary con-
tainment were weld sealed, inspected, and tested to ensure that helium
leakage through the body to the surrounding area would be less than 108
cm3/sec at maximum expected internal pressures. To conserve helium,
most instrument components of the cover-gas system were also weld sealed.

1.2.7.2 Ruggedness

The gbility to withstand shock and vibration without permanent
damage or temporary loss of performance was a consideration in the
selection of all instrument components and was a prime consideration in
the selection of field-mounted instrumentation. Of particular importance
was the ruggedness of those components which are located within the reac
tor and drain cells and which may be subject to abuse during remote
maintenance operations.

1.2.7.3 Size

Small physical size is generally desirable since reduction of the
size of individual components results in an overall reduction in the
size of control panels and minimizes interferences in the field. In
areas such as the sampler-enricher the availability of space dictated
that small-sized components be used; however, in most applications, other
considerations predominated. For example, readability of receivers and
general performance characteristics were considered to be more important
than small size.

1.2.7.4 Materials of Construction

In addition to the requirements for physical strength and resistance
to the effects of corrosion and radiation, discussed in Sects. 1.2.5.1,
1.2.5.2, 1.2.5.3, and 1.2.6.3, consideration was given to compatibility

 
 

36

of materials used in instrument components with the general metallurgical
requirements of the MSRE. For example, the use of metals (such as lead,
tin, and aluminum) with melting points below 1600°F was not permitted in
areas where they could conceivably come in contact with heated pipes and
vessels. Also, the use of dissimilar-metal welds for attachment or con-
nection of instrument components to heated pipes and vessels was not per-
mitted. The use of dissimilar-metal welds for thermocouple attachments
was avoided by the use of a Hastelloy N tab which was welded to the
Inconel thermocouple sheath in the shop and subsequently welded to the
pipe or vessel when the thermocouple was installed.

1.2.7.5 Cleanliness

Since accumulation of dirt and other foreign materials will cause
degradation of performance of most instrument components and systems,
cleanliness was an important consideration in the procurement and instal-
lation of all MSRE instrument components. However, the degree of
cleanliness required is dependent on the application and varies over a
wide range. In most applications moderate cleanliness was adequate, and
reliance was placed on the manufacturers! integrity and on preoperational
checks and inspection for cleanliness control. A much higher degree of
cleanliness was required for components which were an integral part of
the heated salt systems or of pipes and vessels connected to these sys-
tems. To preclude the possibility of foreign matter being transported
from these components to the molten salt or to heated surfaces in pipes
and vessels, stringent cleanliness control was maintained during fabri-
cation, transportation, and installation. Components fabricated outside
ORNL were inspected by Company representatives during assembly. The de-
gree of cleanliness was determined by wiping with dry surgical gauze.
Discoloration of the gauze was cause for rejection. After assembly and
testing, openings were capped, and the components were sealed in plastic
bags and cartons and remained sealed until they were installed in the
MSRE system.

1.2.8 Cost

A continuing effort was made during the design of the MSRE instru-
mentation and controls system and during specification and procurement
of components, to minimize the overall cost of the system. In noncritical
applications, cost was a primary consideration; however, in applications
where safety, operability, and continuity of plant operations were in-
volved, other considerations predominated. Also, where conflicts of
objectives arose, decisions were based on consideration of "cost vs
consequences."

1.3 PLANT INSTRUMENTATION LAYOUT

1.3.1 General Description

Instrumentation is centralized in the main control ares, where a
graphic control panel and operating console are located. Only informe-
tion needed to operate the reactor is displayed on these panels. Auxil-
iary instrument and electrical panels, relsy and thermocouple cabinets,
and a data-logging system are adjacent to the main control room.

A second area, the transmitter room, is adjacent to the reactor cell.
The available space and the desirability of mounting certain components
close to the point of measurement dictated that this be a control ares.
With the exception of control-rod drives, thermocouples, pump speed
pickups, microphones, high-level gamma ionization chambers, weigh cells,
and some control valves, all instrumentation components are located in
areas external to the reactor containment vessels.

Other instrument panels for suxiliary systems are located at con-
venient operating points throughout the building.

Sixty-one 2-ft modular instrument panel sections, one operating
console, two relay cabinets, one thermocouple patch panel, and two equip-
ment racks are required for the MSRE.

1.3.2 Main Control Area

The main control area, shown in Figs. 1.3.1 and 1.3.2, contains 12
control panels and the control console. The 12 panels comprise the main
control board, which is in the form of an arc centered on the console.

The main control board, Fig. 1.3.3, provides a full graphic display
of the reactor system and its associated instrumentation. These panels
contain the instrumentation for the fuel salt system, the coolant salt
system, the fuel and coolant pump oil systems, the off-gas system, the
Jumper board, and a push-button station for the various pumps and blowers.
The primary recorders for nuclear control are also on the mein board. The
instrumentation on the console consists of position indicators, control
switches, end limit indicators for the control rods, radiator doors, and
fission chembers, and other switches required for normal and emergency
operation of the reactor. Routine control of the resctor is accomplished
from the main control area. Some of the auxiliary systems are also con-
trolled here, with remaining portions controlled from the local panels
shown in Figs. 1.3.1 and 1.3.4.

1.3.3. Auxiliary Control Area

The auxiliary control area, Fig. 1.3.2, consists of eight auxiliary
control boards, five nuclear control boards, .one relay cabinet, one
thermocouple cabinet, four diesel and switching panels, and a safety re-
lay cabinet. The eight auxiliary panels contain the signal amplifiers,
power computer, switches and thermocouple alarm switches, auxiliary in-
dicators not required for immediate reactor operation, the fuel and

 

 
 

38

coolant pump microphone amplifier and noise level indicator, and the sub- ,
station alarm monitors. All the safety circuit control relays are lo-
cated in the safety cabinet, and most of the operating circuit relays are
in the control relay cabinet. The relay cabinet contains only the relays
for the main control circuitry. The thermocouple cabinet contains a
patch panel with pyrometer jacks. All thermocouples in the system except
those on the radiator tubes are terminated in this cabinet. The thermo-
couples on the radiator tubes are routed to the temperature scammer and
then to the patch panel.

The five nuclear panels contain some of the instrumentation for the
process radiation system, the oil system, and the sampling and enriching
system. The health physics monitoring alarm system, the high-level gamma
chamber electrometers and switching panel, and the reactor control nuclear
amplifiers, servo amplifiers, and other equipment for the nuclear control
system are also located here. Four panels contain the instrumentation
for the operation of the emergency diesel generators. The distribution
panels for the control circuit and instrument power are located on the
south wall of the auxiliary control room.

1.3.4 Transmitter Room

The transmitter room, Fig. 1.3.5, consists of nine control panels,
one solenoid power supply rack, and a transmitter rack. Panels 1 and 2
are for the leak detector system, and panels 3 and 4 are for fuel drain
tanks 1 and 2, the coolant drain tank, the fuel flush tank, and the fuel
storage tank weigh instrumentation. Panels 5 and 6 are for the fuel and
coolant pump bubbler-type level control, panel 7 is for the freeze valve
air control, panel 8 contains the power supply and alarm switches for the
drain tank level probes and a transducer for the float-type coolant-salt-
pump level transmitter, and panel 9 is for the sump bubbler system. The
solenoid power supply rack contains most of the solenoids for the fuel
salt system and the power supplies and distribution panels for the elec-
tric transmitters and differential transmitters. The transmitter rack
contains the remote amplifiers for the electric signal transmission sys-
tem and also the current-to-air transducers.

Al] electrical and pneumatic lines that connect transmitter room
equipment to input signals from the reactor, drain tank, water room, and
all other areas outside the building enter through sleeves in the floor.
Output signals from the transmitter room equipment are conducted via
feeder cable trays to the main cable tray system, which runs north and
south in the building on the 840-ft level.

C

1.3.5 Field Panels

Additional panels are required for the auxiliary systems. These
(see Figs. 1.3.1 and 1.3.4) are located near the subsystems which they
serve. Four panels for the cooling oil systems are located in the service
room and service tunnel; one cooling- and treated-water system panel is
located in the fan house; three panels are located on elevation 852 ft
 

 

39

at column line C-7 for the sampling and enriching system. Two cover-gas
system panels are located in the diesel house. Two containment-air sys-
tem panels are provided: one at the filter pit and the other in the
high-bay area.

The reactor cell air pressure monitoring instrumentation and testing
facilities are mounted on a single panel located in the north electric
service area, which is directly below the transmitter room. Five panels
for the fuel processing system are located in the high-bay area above
the fuel processing cell. Two of these control the process, and the other
three are for the sampler. One panel located in the high-bay area on top
of the coolant cell serves the coolant salt sampler. Three panels for
the fuel off-gas analyzer and one panel for the reactor-cell-air oxygen
analyzer are located in the vent house. Two panels for the thermocouple
scanning system are located on the 840-ft level near the heater control
panels.

1.3.6 Interconnections

The control areas and the controlled systems are interconnected by
cable trays and conduit. This system includes the main cable tray sys=-
tem running north and south in the building, with branch trays and con-
duits joining the main tray. These main trays carry all tubing for the
pneumatic system, thermocouple lead wire, and the ac and dc control
wiring. Each category of signal runs in a different tray to avoid mixing
of the signals. Risers connect the panels and cabinets in the control
area on elevation 852 ft with the main trays. No exposed trays are in
the main or auxiliary control rooms. Safety system wiring is completely
enclosed in conduit and junction boxes and is separated from control and
instrumentation wiring.

1.3.7 Data Room

The data room is designed to house the data logger-computer; see
Sect. 2.12. It contains all the dete system equipment except one logging
typewriter, which is located in the mein control room. The layout of the
equipment in the room is shown in Fig. 2.12.4 (Sect. 2.12). This room
is located in the north end of the reactor building, next to the main
control room. There are entries from the hallway and the main control
room. A large glass window is located so that the main control panel
can be seen from the data room.

The date system cabinets are installed in two rows, back to back,
running east to west about the center of the room. The front row of
five cabinets facing the control room contain the computer proper, and
the six rows facing the north end of the room contain the analog input
signal terminals and the control circuits for the typewriters, magnetic
tapes, and other input equipment. The data system operator's console is
located so that the reactor control panel can be seen by an operator sat
the console. Two desks and several tables are located in the room for

 
 

40

use of reactor operating and analysis personnel and the computer mainte-
nance engineer. A storage cabinet for magnetic tapes is located at the
west wall of the room, and a spare parts storage cabinet is located at
the north wall. The electrical power panel for the system is located in
the northwest corner of the room. The installed equipment is shown in
Figs. 2.12.1 and 2.12.3 (Sect. 2.12).

The input signal cables for the data system are brought up to the
bottom of the room in cable trays. Holes are cut in the floor beneath
the cabinets for routing the input signal and control cables to the
cabinets.

The data room is air conditioned by two 7.5-ton air conditioners.
These same units can be used to supply air to the main control room in
an emergency, and the control room air conditioner can supply air to the
data room when necessary.

1.4 PLANT CONTROL SYSTEM

The MSRE and its control and instrumentation complex may be viewed
as a primary reactor system which generates nuclear power and rejects
heat to the atmosphere plus the collection of auxiliaries or subsystems
required to run this primary system. This discussion of MSRE plant
control is concerned with how the control system interconnects these
various systems and how they are coupled to the reactor; it is little
concerned with the reactor safety system. It is sufficient to point
out that the safety-grade instruments are not used as operational con=-
trols and that every effort is made to keep the safety system instru-
ments completely decoupled from the operational control equipment. The
MSRE safety system, what it does, and why are discussed in Sect. 1.5.

It is appropriate to separate the various systems and equipment
and their associated instruments and controls into categories, thus:

1. Those operator-controlled items which exert a direct and im=-
mediate influence on the state of the reactor; collectively these are
the operator's "handle" which runs the MSRE.

2. Redundant, essential auxiliaries not in (1) which, should one
unit malfunction, require immediate transfer switching by the operator
if the redundance is to be effective. Examples are the instrument air
compressors and the component cooling pumps.

3. Vital monitoring and control instrumentation not subject to
adjustment or control by the operator. These instruments produce off-
limit alarms and control actions and provide continuous information as
to the conditions in the monitored systems. Examples are the process
radiation monitors, health-physics alarm instrumentation, safety sys-
tem instruments, etc.

4. Nonredundant but essential auxiliaries which operate as self-
contained devices, These instruments either require no control or are
controlled locally and automatically. They are expected to operate
continuously and unattended. An example is the 60-kva battery-powered
solid-state ac power supply.

5. The remaining instruments whose effect on the reactor system
is either peripheral and indirect or is further modified by the in-
strumentation in (1). Instruments used for chemical and physical anal-
yses, for gathering experimental data, and for monitoring slow trends
in noncritical areas of the system are in this group.

This grouping, or categorization, has been strongly implied by

Sect. 1.3, which discusses plant instrumentation layout as it is related

to the reactor operator's use of the instruments and controls. Figure
1.4.1 is a functional diagram of the instrumentation in and directly
adjacent to the main control room. Generally, the diagram shows that
the main control room instruments are composed principally of those in
the first three groups, and the instrumentation on the operator's con-
sole is almost entirely in the first category.

There is a strong incentive to maintain continuous operation at
the MSRE; therefore the plant and the instrumentation and control sys-
tem are designed to minimize unscheduled total shutdowns caused by
equipment failures and electrical power (TVA) interruptions. Critical
operating auxiliaries such as instrument air compressors, water pumps,
cooling blowers, etc., are redundant, and switchover to the spare unit
 

45

is accomplished at the main control board. Each lube oil package serving
the salt loop pumps contains a spare oil pump. Transfer switching to
the spare oil pump is automatic on loss of flow (pressure).

Electrical power interruptions are a leading cause of shutdown
conditions. Design of the MSRE assumes that TVA-supplied electrical
power will be interrupted several times a year by thunderstorms. ILocal
emergency power from diesel generators is provided.! The diesels are
started and stopped in the auxiliary control room just a few steps
from the operator's console. Short-term power interruptions to the
operating equipment will not produce a total system shutdown. This
allows sufficient time for manually controlled diesel generator startup
and necessary transfer switching. Total shutdown is defined to include
a reactor drain, which produces a completely quiescent system incapable
of achieving criticality. The design and operation of the reactor and
its controls do not assume unperturbed operation with a loss of TVA
power. In fact, if the reactor is at power, the rods and the load will
scram, and it will not be possible to resume high-power operation until
TVA power is restored. The procedure following a loss of TVA power is
to restore criticality and operate at heat loss power until TVA power
is again available.

The on-line reliability required by the instrument and control
power system must meet more stringent requirements with respect to
continuity. The operator's need for good information is never more
acute than during abnormal conditions such as those produced by an
interruption of TVA power. Safety systems and high-grade interlocks
normally act toward shutdown when their power is lost, even momentarily.
Therefore, the operation of essential plant controls and instruments
does not depend on the normal TVA supply. The two-out-of-three re-
dundancy extensively employed in the plant safety system is intended to
eliminate such a dependency. The plant safety system and a typical
example of three-channel redundant design are discussed in Sect. 2.5.
Figure 1.4.2 is a simplified one-line diagram of the power system used
for the instrumentation and controls.

This power distribution system will be thoroughly described in
Sect. 4.13, but it is worth while to point out that:

1. The three-channel safety systems receive their power from three
practically independent sources within the distribution system.
Two of these are battery-powered: and will not be affected by short-
term interruptions of TVA power.

2. The controls and information channels essential to continuous oper=-
ation are battery-powered.

The control requirements of the MSRE differ, depending on whether
or not the reactor loop is filled or empty and, if filled, on the amount
of power being generated. These different requirements must be ac-
commodated within the control system; that is, the interlocks which pro-
hibit or permit in one operating regime must not prevent routine and

proper operation in another, Mode control, superimposed on the indi-
vidual subsystem control channels, resolves this problem of accommodation. w
It does so by making all the subsystem alterations required for accom-
modation to operating regimes responsive to a single, manually operated
control.
Figure 1.4.3 is a diagram of the fuel and coolant salt systems,
showing the location of the instrumentation and controls which provide
mode control. It can be seen from this figure that mode control in the
MSRE is concerned with:

1. The location of the fuel salt and the flush salt, that is, whether
in the drain tanks or the reactor loop. Note that the control sys-
tem makes no distinction between fuel salt and flush salt. This is
because reliable and certain sensors which differentiate between
the two are not available,

2. The ability to transfer salt among the drain tanks or to and from
the reactor loop.

3. The power (flux) being developed and the rate of change of power,
both actual and potential.

4. The operating integrity of important flux instruments used to monitor
and control reactor power.

The scope of the mode control system is not extended to the aux-
iliaries, to the helium supply system, or to the off-gas system. Equip-
ment or control system deficiencies and operating errors which affect
these areas will be reflected, indirectly, to the mode control system
or will become immediately apparent because of alarms and/or interlocks oO
or by the action of the safety system. Furthermore, the operating re-
strictions imposed by the mode controls are more numerous during tran-
sitions from one operating mode to another as power is being increased.
This limits the rate of change of power to reasonable values. After
the new reactor mode has been established, many of these restrictions
required to enter the mode are bypassed by relay seals.

Figures 1.4.4 and 1.4.5 are condensed block diagrams which indicate
the function and purpose of the mode controls. The manually selected
operating regimes have heen designated as Off, Prefill, Operate, Operate-
Start, and Operate-Run; a discussion of these follows:

1. Off. — The "Off" mode could be designated "Not in Prefill or
in Operate” (see 2 and 3 below) without sacrificing accuracy. In "Off"
the entire MSRE system is not inoperative but the reactor is shut down.
When the reactor is "Off" the following conditions obtain:

a) rod withdrawal is prohibited,

b) not in automatic load control,
c) rod control servo is "Off,"

d) prohibits opening of the helium valves used to fill the reactor
vessel,

e) prohibits raising the radiator doors by manual control, above
the intermediate limit if reactor power is above 1 Mw,

f) provides a control rod "Reverse" if the power (flux) exceeds oo
1.5 Mw or if the reactor period is less than 5 sec, W
 

47

g) prevents starting the fuel and coolant salt pumps; if the
pumps are running and the control system is switched to "Off"
these pumps will continue to run because of seal contacts in
the pump control circuits,

h) "no thaw" — transfer freeze valves,

i) "no thaw" — fill and drain freeze valves.

2. Prefill. — Intended to establish the necessary and sufficient
conditions required to precede a reactor start. During this period
the reactor loop is empty so that helium may be circulated to establish
uniform temperature conditions in the loop. Safety system checkouts
are being conducted, and other routine and nonroutine operations involving
maintenance and equipment verification may be under way. Salt transfers
among the drain tanks, to the chemical processing plant, or to or fron
the fuel storage tank are permitted during Prefill. The primary re-
quirement during Prefill operation is that the reactor loop be main-
tained empty. Prefill allows complete freedom in the use of the jumper
board for testing and maintenance checks and, excepting the reactor
fill restrictions, does not superimpose additional interlocked prohi-
bitions on operating MSRE equipment.

3. Operate. — This mode establishes certain conditions required
to fill the reactor loop. Entering "Operate" requires that the transfer
freeze valves between the fuel storage tank and the drain tanks be
frozen and that at least one freeze valve between the reactor drain line
and one of the fuel drain tanks be open.

4. Operate-Start. — The Operate mode automatically becomes Operate-
Start when the reactor loop is filled to the correct level and the re~
actor drain valve (FV-103) is frozen. This mode permits reactor start
with power generation not exceeding 1.5 Mw provided the conditions for
control-rod withdrawal, described in Sect. 2.6, have been established.

5. Operate-Run., — This mode is obtained by manual selection when
conditions requisite to high-power operation have been met. Operate-
Run and Operate-Start are, by direct switching, mutually exclusive.
Depending on whether or not the operator chooses to control the reactor
automatically or manually, the requirements for going into the Operate-
Run mode differ somewhat (see Fig. 1.4.5).

If the operator chooses to use the automatic rod controller or
programmed load control, or both (see Sects. 2.6 and 2.8), certain initial
conditions must be met which provide a smooth transition in reactor
power generation as it becomes responsive to its load-following charac-
teristics and as the rod servo assumes control. These initial conditions

are as follows:
A. Using the Automatic Rod Controller

1. The demand signal computed by the automatic rod controller is
asking for less than 1 Mw.

2. The regulating rod is not being restricted in motion by its
limit switches (see Sect. 2. 6).

 
 

B. Using Programmed Load Control

1. The radiator doors are positioned so that power extraction is
limited.

2. The set-point signal which controls the radiator bypass damper,
described in Sect. 2.8, is zero.

Entering the Operate-Run mode is subject to additional restrictions
which are not contingent on the use of the automatic rod controller:

l. At least one main radiator blower must be on.
2. The fuel salt pump must be operating (rpm > 1100).

3. The range selectors in the linear power channels (Sect. 2.4) must
be in the 1.5-Mw position.

4. At least one wide-range counting channel must provide "confidence"
“and indicate that reactor power is above 0.5 Mw and that the reactor
period is over 30 sec.

Once Operate-Run has been established, most of the requirements
listed in the preceding paragraphs are bypsssed by a seal, as shown in
Fig. 1.4.5. When reactor power reaches 1 Mw the "confidence" interlock
(Sect. 2.6) is bypassed and, insofar as the mode control circuitry is
involved, the only requirement for continuing reactor operation in this
mode is that the fuel salt pump be running, one main blower be on, the
transfer freeze valves be frozen, at least one drain line freeze valve
be thawed, and no safety system jumpers be used.

The data logger-computer, adjacent to the main control area, oc-
cupies a singular position in the hierarchy of MSRE instrument and
control systems, It is added to the MSRE as an experiment intended to
evaluate the merit of such devices in reactor systems. Therefore, the
MSRE control system continues to operate whether or not the data logger
is in service, Although no direct reactor system control functions
are vested in the logger-computer, it is capable of exerting consider-
able influence on reactor system operations. This is because it pro-
vides the reactor operator with a large amount of current information
on system status and gives alarms for off-limit conditions.

The available space in the main and auxiliary control areas re-
stricted their use to instrumenting the functions shown in Fig. 1.4.1.
It was necessary, and for no other reason, to obtain the additional
space required for the remaining instrumentation by decentralization
with local control systems. In many cases, and regardless of available
space considerations, local control was a preferred choice for one or
more of the following reasons:

1. it results in control loops which are less costly to build and are
more reliable,

2. 1it eliminates problems of data transmission or retransmission over
long lines with consequent improvement in sccuracy,

3. it improves operation by locating the control system directly ad-
Jjacent to the controlled equipment.
 

49

These decentralized controls, whose location has been discussed
in Sect. 1.3, are in categories 4 and 5 (listed previously in this
section) and are not needed continuously by the reactor operator.

Monitoring by annunciation is augmented by scheduled, routine inspection
(the "walking log") as required.

1.5 SAFETY SYSTEM

The MSRE safety system is composed of instrumentation which must
be highly reliable because it augments the containment or protects
vital and expensive equipment, or both. This section is confined to a
broad, overall description of the reliable protective subsystems in the
MSRE and the basic principles which guided their design.

Reliable protective systems for reactor installations have, in the
past, been focused principally on the reactor core, and their operation
has been centered on the behavior of the flux. In designing the MSRE
the use of reliable protective instrumentation was not limited to pro-
tecting the reactor core from the immediate effects of excessive flux.
It will be seen, as we review and describe the protective subsystems,
that safety-grade instrumentation is extensively employed to enhance
the primary and secondary containment and to ensure a reactor drain.

It is worth while to describe, briefly, some of the characteristics
of the MSRE that are responsible for the safety-grade protective instru-
mentation with which it is provided.

1. The MSRE, being liquid-fueled, does not have fuel cladding as
the first, unpenetrated containment barrier. The core vessel, heat ex-
changer, fuel salt storage tanks, and all interconnecting piping become
the primary containment barrier to the molten salt. In addition, this
primary containment is pierced by inlet and outlet lines carrying helium
used for sweep gas across the pump bowl, for bubbler level instruments,
and for drain tank pressurization. These lines violate the primary con-
tainment barrier unless they are reliably blocked.

2. In common with solid-fueled reactors the MSRE uses conventional
poison rods for control and safety. Analyses, 13 tests, and operating
experience have shown that this reactor is a very docile and stable ma-
chine having a relatively long neutron lifetime, a large heat capacity,
and an effective negative temperature coefficient of reactivity. All
hypothetical nuclear excursions in the MSRE proceed slowly and do not
develop high transient vapor pressures; undesirably high temperatures
are the consequence.

The control rods are not capable of providing absolute reactor
shutdown under ell conditions. The shutdown worth in the rods, at re-
actor operating temperature, is lost because of the negative temperature
coefficient if the fuel salt in the core vessel is cooled sufficiently.

Transference of fuel to the drain tanks is the certain method of
obtaining absolute shutdown, and the ability to effect such a transfer
(reactor drain) must be assured. .

3. The chemistry of the fuel salt does not disallow segregation4+3
of the different fluorides with a consequent increased concentration of
uranium in one of the segregated phases. Segregated salt has been pro-
duced in the laboratory under very carefully controlled conditions. The
accidental and undetected segregation of salt in a drain tank is highly
improbable but has not been demonstrated to be incredible. Filling the
reactor with segregated salt may produce a nuclear excursion during the
filling operation which, ultimately, exceeds the limiting capacity of the
control rods. Rigid, reliable control of the reactor filling operation
is a necessity.

4. A temperature excursion will cause the fuel salt to expand faster
than its containment. The volume available for such expansion is limited;
therefore, it is essential to have rigid, reliable control of temperature
and fuel salt level. See also No. 3 above.

5. Fuel and coolant salts freeze at temperatures in the region of
840 to 850°F. Freezing the salt is not harmful, but remelting is accom-
panied by expansion, which is capable of rupturing the piping. The
coolant salt radiator is particularly vulnerable. Loss of the radiator
would be costly and would be an intolerable setback to the MSR program.
Reliable protective measures (see Sect. 2.8) are included in the MSRE.

Principles employed in achieving reliability in reactor safety sys-
tems® 18 have been applied extensively to the MSRE. These principles
are summarized as follows:

1. Redundancy is employed so that no single failure of an instru-
ment, component, or wiring having a reasonable probability of failure
could cause system failure. A single failure could involve all coa-
ductors in a single conduit, all contacts of a switch, or, unless special
barriers are provided, the entire contents of an enclosure.

2. Testing is employed, preferably on line and without disconnecting
equipment or otherwise impairing the ability to protect during the test.
Each channel is tested separately so as to disclose a failed component
which would prevent protective action or a failure which could intercon-
nect two otherwise independent channels and thereby destroy channel in-
dependence and redundancy.

3. Diversity is employed wherever feasible; that is, unlike channels
are paired to accomplish a desired result. For example, a flow loss caused
by stopping the coolant salt pump is detected by both the pump speed mon-
itors and the flowmeters in the coolant salt piping.

4. Safety and control are separated so that loss of control result-
ing in an excursion will not occur simultaneously with loss of protection.
Separation is also employed so that improvements intended to enhance con-
trol or other functions unrelated to safety will not be made, unwittingly,
to the detriment of safety.

These precepts constitute recommended design practices for what are
now thought to be the best safety systems we know how to build. Figure

1.5.1 shows an example of a three-channel, high-reliability subsystem
in the MSRE. This is a simplified diagram of the instrumentation which
closes the block valves in the instrument air lines to the secondary
containment cell if the pressure in the cell rises above 2 psig. It is
a representative example of a safety subsystem in the MSRE. The follow-
ing description of its design and operation is included here to illus-
trate how these general precepts have been reduced to practice.

The instrumentation is simple; three high-grade pressure switches
provide the switching contacts which operate the solenoid valves in the
valve matrix. This matrix is arranged so that, if any two of the three
pressure switches are actuated, the pneumatic actuators (diaphragms) of
the block valves are vented to the atmosphere, the air supply to the
valves is shut off, and the spring-loaded valves close and block the in-

strument air lines.

The two-out-of-three redundancy permits on-line testing without ;
system perturbation. The completeness of the test procedure employed oO
is an operational decision and is not limited by the design of the in-

strumentation. Testing is done by simulating an increase in cell pres-

sure by using the nitrogen cylinder (Fig. 1.5.1) as the source of pres-

sure and noting the response of the pressure gages in the valve matrix

or, if desired, by actually closing the block valves. A typical test

in channel A proceeds thus:

1. The hand valve in the line which connects the nitrogen cylinder
to the line from PSS-RC-B to the reactor cell is opened, and the pres-
sure is adjusted to the 2-psig set point. The sintered disk snubbers
provide sufficient flow restriction to maintain this pressure without
undue loss? of nitrogen to the reactor cell.

2. The increase in pressure actuates pressure switch PSS-RC-B and
this, in turn, deenergizes solenoid valves ESV-1Al and ESV-1A2.

3. These valves, ESV-1Al and ESV-1A2, in the valve matrix change
their aspect, but not so as to affect the pressure in the 80-psig air
header; valve ESV-1A2 vents pressure gage PI-1A5. During normal opera-
tion pressure gages PI-1Al, PI-1A4, and PI-1A5 indicate header pressure,
80 psig. Pressure gage PI-1A5 will now go to zero. The block valves
will be unaffected since there is still no open line or lines between
the block valve operators and the vent line and because the connection
between the 80-psig header and the valve operators is still maintained
through ESV-1B2, ESV-1A1, ESV-1Bl, and ESV-1C.

This test, steps 1 to 3 above, can be conducted with any channel
and without disturbing reactor operation. It does not test the actual
closure of the block valves. Now, suppose any two channels are tested
coincidentally. For example, if channels 1 and 2 are tested simulta-
neously, solenoids ESV-1Al, ESV-1A2, ESV-1Bl, and ESV-1B2 will be de-
energized, and, referring to the valve matrix in Fig. 1.5.1, the block
valve operators will be opened to atmospheric pressure through ESV-1CL
to ESV-1B1 to ESV-1C2 to ESV-1Al to BSV-1B2 to vent. Valves ESV-1A1l
and ESV-1B2 now prevent transmission of pressure from the 80-psig air
supply to the block valve diaphragms, and the spring-loaded valves will
close. Such a two-channel test checks operation of the entire system.
Failure of any block valve to close can be detected by observing the
response, or lack of response, of the in-cell instruments supplied via
the block valve.

This same basic scheme is used for protection elsewhere in the
MSRE. The protective instruments which close block valves in the inlet
helium lines operate when the pressure in line 500 falls below 28 psig
(see Figs. 1.5.7 and 1.5.2). In this situation, where protective action
is initiated by an undue reduction in pressure, testing is accomplished

 

19The containment is normally held at —2.0 psig, and the test pres-
sure needs only to produce a differential across the snubbers of 4 psig.
The nitrogen cylinder has a volume of approximately 2 £t2 at 2000 psi.
Should this entire volume be introduced into the secondary containment,
with a volume of 18,000 £43, the pressure rise in the containment would
be negligible. Also, the cell atmosphere is specified to be more than
95% nitrogen and would not be degraded. o

by venting the pressure switches to atmospheric pressure by opening an
individual hand valve and, as above, by observing the response of the
pressure gages in a valve matrix or the block valves themselves.

This same design is used for protecting against too great a re-
duction in reactor cell pressure below atmospheric (see input No. XII,
Fig. 1.5.2). In this particular system the pressure switches are en-
closed in boxes which are vented to atmospheric pressure through snubbers.
Testing is accomplished by pressurizing the boxes. This increases the
differential pressure across the pressure switches and thereby simulates
a reduction of pressure within the cell,

It is worth while to examine this particular safety subsystem from
the standpoint of the "recommended practices" previously cited. Up to
but not including the output elements (block valves), redundancy and
testing requirements are completely satisfied by the design. It should
be pointed out that an on-line test of this particular subsystem which
includes closing the instrument air line block valves is operationally
intolerable. The addition of a second valve in each line would improve
the reliability of the instrumented blocking system but, of course,
would not improve the on-line testing situation. It was established
while the MSRE was being designed that the closed system of instrument
air lines, tanks, and compressors, with associated valves, etc., con-
stituted the second effective containment barrier (see Sect. 1.5.4).

This particular system does not employ diverse channels in obtain-
ing redundant input channels. In this particular case there is no suit-
able and reliable substitute for the simple, direct measurement of cell
pressure as it is done. The use of diverse sources of control power
substantially reduces the likelihood of spurious action caused by failed
or faulty power sources.

The pressure switches are installed in the north electric service
area and are within 10 ft of the cell wall. The piping to and from the
switches is of autoclave tubing with autoclave fittings. The electrical
interconnections are run in separate conduits, channel by channel, and
contain no other wiring. The solenoid valve matrix is located in the
north electric service area in a safety instrumentation cabinet.

As the MSRE design proceeded, a few situations and conditions de-
veloped which resulted in departures from the ideal recommended practices
outlined previously in this section. Two examples, with reasons, follow:

1. All three of our safety system neutron sensors are located in
a single penetration because both the amount of space and its configura-
tion absolutely prohibit three separate penetrations at different loca-
tions (see Sect. 2.1).

2. In some cases the reliable instrumentation which automatically
closes block valves closes only one valve in each line rather than two
separate, independent valves in series. MSRE system design established
a criterion that a single block valve in series with a pair of check
valves was a necessary and sufficient alternate for two block valves in
series (see, for instance, Sect. 4.8).

On-line testing of the "load scram" system (refer to Sect. 2.8) con-
flicts, seriously, with reactor operating schedules and will produce
highly undesirable thermal transients. These, in turn, produce thermal
stress cycles which reduce the life of the system. In order to test the
door drive mechanism and the ability of the doors to scram when the re-
actor is down and the coolant system drained, it is necessary to bypass

 
 

 

60

the safety instruments that scram the doors since these same instruments co
prevent raising the doors to perform the test. This dilemma is solved oC
by using the jumper board to bypass these safety instruments. The jumper
board circuitry (refer to Sect. 4.11) is interlocked so that safety system
bypassing is permitted only when the reactor is empty, Safety system
Jumpering is resorted to only when absolutely necessgéry and, where em-
ployed on the MSRE, was adopted only when no altgfnate method could be
found. In this particular case the ability to test was retained by this
compromise.
It is usual and obvious practice to operate relays, solenoids, tem-
perature switches, etc., so that power losses cause them to change state
toward safety;%° e.g., safety system relays are operated "energized,"
and their contacts break circuits to produce the safety action. The
relay contacts which stop the component cooling pump motors (see Sect.
1.5.5) must be closed to energize the battery-powered "Stop" trip coil
in the motor starter. Motor starters, typically, operate this way, and
it is not in the best interests of reliability to attempt to redesign
or modify well-engineered, time-tested equipment of this type for reverse-
mode operation. Furthermore, this particular sgfety action is diverse
in that protection is also obtained by closing a valve (see outputs XI
and XII, Fig. 1.5.2).
Because of the very strong incentive to keep the primary containment
simple and structurally uncomplicated, the MSRE does not have a multi-
plicity of fuel salt drain lines, each with an individual drain valve,
controlled by the safety system.
The foregoing is intended to provide a broad, overall view of the
application of reliable, safety-grade instrumentation to the MSRE. De- . oO
tailed descriptions of the design and operation of these reliable sub-
systems are contained either in the remainder of this section or else-
where in this report and may be located by referring to the "Supplemen-
tary Information" column in Table 1.5.1, or the last column in Fig.

sion of similar material, now partially obsolete, originally presented

1.5.1 Reactor Fill and Drain System

A simplified diagram is shown in Fig. 1.5.4 of the reactor vessel,
the drain tanks, the interconnecting piping, and the control elements
required to fill and drain the reactor system with fuel salt in a safe,
orderly way. The control rods are essential to a safe filling procedure
but are omitted from this diagram in the interest of simplification.

The reactor is filled by applying helium pressure to the gas space
in the selected drain tank and forcing the molten fuel salt up and into
the core vessel. As a typical example, if the reactor is to be filled
from fuel drain tank 1 (FDT-1), pressurizing helium is admitted via
lines 517 and 572 (see Fig. 1.5.4). The filling pressure is controlled
by pressure-regulating valve PCV-517-Al. The pressure setting of this
valve is controlled by the operator. The upstream capillary flow re-
strictor in line 517 limits the maximum inlet flow rate of pressurizing
helium. Valves HCV-544-A1 and HCV-573-Al in the pipes which connect the
gas space in FDT-1 to the pump bowl and to the charcoal beds are closed.
Since the net pressure head available to produce flow decreases as the
fuel level rises in the core vessel, the fill rate hecomes progressively
slower as the fill proceeds if constant inlet helium pressure is main-
tained and if the pump bowl pressure remains constant.

Helium pressure in the pump bowl is the second component of the
differential pressure that drives fuel salt into the core vessel. A
sudden reduction in pump bowl pressure during the reactor filling op-
eration would cause an unscheduled rise in salt level in the core. If,
at this time, the reactor is on the verge of becoming critical, an un-
expected nuclear excursion cannot be ruled out. The safeguard provided
is to allow filling only when the positive pressure in the pump bowl is
equal to or less than +2 psig and thus keep the maximum possible increase
in net filling pressure within safe limits. Two causes for a sudden de-
crease in pump bowl pressure are considered. First, opening valve HCV-
533-Al1 after reactor filling has started would vent the pump bowl to the
auxiliary charcoal beds, which normally operate at close to atmospheric
pressure. The resultant pressure change in the pump bowl would be —=2
psi. Administrative control is used to maintain HCV-533-Al open just
before and during filling. Second, a rupture or leak would allow the
escape of pump bowl helium to the reactor cell atmosphere, which is held
at —2 psig (12.7 psia). This condition would cause a maximum pressure
decrease in the pump bowl of 4 psi. If the fuel pump bowl pressure ex-
ceeds 2 psig, the safety equipment (1) initiates a drain by opening by-
pass valves HCV-544-Al, HCV-545-Al, and HCV-546-A1, thereby equalizing
helium pressure in the drain tanks and pump bowl, and (2) shuts off the
supply of pressurizing helium by closing valves PCV-517-Al, HCV-572-A2,
HCV-574-A1, and HCV-576-Al. This is the helium valve condition shown in
Fig. 1.5.4 and is required by normal operation with the pump bowl at 5
psig; therefore, the 2-psig channel need not be disabled during normal
operation. Additional safety considerations involving pressure in the
fuel salt system and the instrumentation used for measuring helium pres-
sures are discussed in the following section.

Excessive pressure, 25 psig, in the pump bowl is relieved by opening
HCV-533-A1l. During reactor operation, with the bypass lines open, one or
more of the drain tanks would be subjected to this pressure. The input
signal used to open HCV-533-Al originates in either of a redundant pair

 

 
 

68

of pressure transmitters, PT-592B and PT-589B, on inlet lines to the pump
bowl and overflow tank respectively. These same input channels provide
the +2-psig safety signal discussed above.

As a further safeguard during filling, the safety system requires
that all three control rods be partially withdrawn in order to pressurize
the drain tanks. The weigh cells on the drain tanks provide information
used to monitor the total amount of fuel salt moved into the core vessel.

The possible filling accidents are discussed in ref. 1. Briefly,
these accidents are (1) premature criticality during filling caused by an
overly high concentration of uranium brought about by selective freez-
ing?1+22 jp the drain tank; (2) premature criticality during filling of
low-temperature (900°F) fuel salt of normal concentration, whose normal
critical temperature with the rods withdrawn approximately half stroke
is 1200°F; and (3) premature criticality during filling of normal fuel
salt at normal tempersture with all control rods fully withdrawn. Pro-
tective action is the same for all three cases: the control rods are
scrammed, and the reactor vessel is drained to ensure permanent shut-
down. Rod scram is produced and vent valves HCV-573-Al, HCV-575-A1,
and HCV-577-Al are opened by the excess flux signal. Since a premature
criticality occurs before loop circulation is attained, the outlet tem-
perature sensors are ineffective. The safety system also invokes a re-
cator emergency drain to enhance containment if there is evidence that
radicactivity is escaping from the primary fuel loop. These subsystems
are covered subsequently in this section.

Anergency drainage is effected by the following actions (see Fig.
1.5.4):

1. The freeze valve in line 103, which connects the reactor drain
tanks, is thawed. Thawing is accomplished by closing valves HCV-919A
and 919B, a redundant pair, to stop the flow of cooling air. The system
is designed with a heat capacity sufficient to thaw the plug in less than
15 min.

2. The helium pressures in the fuel drain tank and the unfilled
portion of the fuel salt loop are equalized by opening bypass valves
HCV-544-A1, HCV-545-Al, and HCV-546-Al.

3. Vent valves HCV-573-Al, HCV-575-A1, and HCV-577-Al, which re-
lease pressurizing helium in the drain tank to the off-gas system, are
opened,

4. Pressure regulating valve PCV-517-A1 in line 517, the inlet
header that supplies pressurizing helium to all the drain tanks, is
closed and shuts off the supply of pressurizing helium.

5. The drain tank pressurizing valves, HCV-572-Al, HCV-574-Al, and
HCV-576-A1, in the helium supply lines are also closed to halt further
addition of fuel salt.

Actions 2 or 3 are immedistely and independently effective in re-
versing a fill, and hence the valves are redundant. Similarly, PCV-517-

Al and the individual pressurizing valves, referred to in 4 and 5 above,
form series pairs and provide redundancy. For example, it can be seen
from Fig. 1.5.4 that, taking fuel drain tank No. 1 as typical, pressure
equalization and venting are accomplished by opening HCV-544-Al and HCV-
573-A1 respectively. Administrative control is used to ensure that when
the reactor is filled with fuel salt, both drain tanks, FDT-1 and FDT-2,
are empty and both of the freeze valves, FV-106 and FV-105, are thawed.
The tank condition is monitored by reference to the weigh cell and level
instrumentation on each tank.

1.5.2 Helium Pressure Measurements in the Fuel Salt Loop

One channel of the instrumentation which measures helium pressure
in the fuel pump bowl and the overflow tank is shown in Fig. 1.5.5. The
components and their installation are designed to meet containment re-
quirements.

The pressure transmitters are installed just outside the main sec-
ondary containment shell. From the standpoint of containment, the trans-
mitter housings are "blisters" on the main containment cells. Contain-
ment criteria would be satisfied by

1. venting the reference pressure side of the transmitter diaphragms
to the inside of the containment cell,

2. sealing the vent port at the transmitter,

3. connecting the transmitter's vent port to a contaimment-grade volume
which is maintained at a known and constant pressure.

If the transmitter's reference pressure port is vented to the containment
cell, the pressure measurement includes cell pressure. This pressure is
controlled nominally at —2.0 psig during operation, is at atmospheric
pressure during in-cell maintenance, and is well above atmospheric pres-
sure during periodic checks to verify the containment capability of the
cell. The normal and acceptable fluctustions around the nominal -2.0-
psig value would reduce the accuracy of the transmitted measurement by
an unacceptable amount. If the reference port of the transmitter is
merely sealed shut, the reference pressure and hence the transmitted
pressure would fluctuate with temperature changes in the sealed refer-
ence volume In the transmitter. Evacuating the reference side of the
transmitter was deemed unscceptable because these vital measurements
would then rely entirely on the long-term reliebility of the vacuum.

The variable-volume reference chamber (see action 3 above) re-
solves these conflicting demands of containment and measurement ac-
curacy. Conceptually, it acts as a strong but extremely compliant bag
which automatically adjusts its volume to maintain an internal pressure
very nearly equal to the externally applied pressure. By connecting
the reference ports of the transmitters to these reference chambers
which are located outside the containment cells, the dual requirements
of the containment and measurement accuracy are satisfied. At the MSRE
the reference volume is housed, and the housing is vented to the off-gas
duct near the blower inlet. During operation the ambient pressure in
the off-gas duct 1s approximately —2.0 in. H20, the blower inlet pres-
sure. This -2.0-in. H30 offset is not significant. The reference

 

 
 

70

chamber is shown in diagram in Fig. 1.5.5 and is described in detail in To
Sect. 6.2. Oo

Two channels are used, one in the pump bowl and the other in the
overflow tank. These normally operate at the same pressure. Any safety
signal from either channel initiates the appropriate safety action.

The system may be tested periodically during reactor operation by:
(1) observing system response to small operator-induced pressure changes
and (2) shunting the torque motor in the pressure transmitter. These
tests will establish that, in the channel undergoing test, the lines
from the pump bowl (or overflow tank) are clear and the electronic equip-
ment and associated wiring are capable of operating the output relays.

Since it takes from 10 to 15 min to thaw drain valve FV-103, this
time can be used to cbserve the response of the thermocouples on the
freeze valve as it heats up but before actual salt flow begins. The
valve can then be refrozen before an actual drain is initiated. In
such a test, valve HCV-533 (Fig. 1.5.4) will be opened, and the con-
trolled pressure (5 psig) in the pump bowl will be lost for the dura-
tion of the test. The response of HCV-533 can be noted by observing
the actuation of the position switch on the valve stem. This test pro-
cedure checks the entire safety channel, except the ability of the trans-
mitter measuring bellows and the associgted linkage to transmit the pres-
sure.

Monitoring of these channels is accomplished by indicating and
alarming the pressure downstream from the hand throttling valves in
each helium line serving the primary elements (the bubbler tubes) in
the pump bowl and in the overflow tank. A downstream flow stoppage by
a blocked line is indicated by a high-pressure alarm; low flow caused oO
by a loss of upstream (supply pressure, an upstream blockage by foreign
matter, or a hand valve closure is indicated by a low-pressure alarm.

The fuel level in the overflow tank is measured by the differential
pressure across the helium bubbler probe which dips into the fuel salt
in the tank. The design criteria for testing and monitoring these dif-
ferential pressure measuring channels are the same as those which guided
the design of the pressure channels described in the preceding paragraphs.
The reference chamber is not required. Two channels are employed for
safety, and either will initiate a reactor drain if the fuel salt level
in the overflow tank exceeds 20% of full-scale level indication.

1.5.3 Afterheat Removal System

The drain tank afterheat removal system, typically the same for both
drain tanks, is shown in Fig. 1.5.6. Once placed in operation the evapo-
rative cooling system is designed to be self-regulating and to operate
without external control. Reliable operation of the afterheat removal
system requires (1) that the feedwater tanks contain a supply of cooling
water, (2) that an ample supply of cooling water is available to the
condensers, (3) that the system includes reliable valves to admit feed-
water to the steam drums, and (4) that reliable block valves be provided
 

71

in the drain lines®? from the steam drums. Administrative control is
relied on to ensure that the feedwater tanks contain water. Valve ESV-
806 opens to admit water automatically to the steam drum when the salt
temperature in the drain tank exceeds 1300°F and recloses at approxi-
mately 1200°F. This valve is in parallel with manual valve LCV-806A,
and the pair are a redundant means of admitting water to the steam drum.
Normally the condensers are cooled by tower cooling water, but diver-
sion valve HCV-882-Cl provides an alternate supply of water. Loss of
tower water pressure caused by a loss of water or pump shutdown is de-
tected by pressure switch PS-851-Bl, which operates diversion valve
HCV-882-C1. When this valve operates, the cooling water supply is
shifted from the tower to the process water main.

Since it takes over 12 hr for excessively high afterheat tempera-
tures to develop after a drain, there is sufficient time to effect a
transfer to the other drain tank in the event of a failure or malfunc-
tion. This is also ample time to make connections from the cooling
water system to a tank truck in the event that the normal water supply
is inoperative.

The drain lines, 806-2 and 807-2, are used to keep the tanks dry
during normal operation. They are extensions of the secondary contain-
ment and are provided with block valves. Reliable, safety-grade con-
trol instrumentation closes valves ESV-806-2A and 806-2B, a redundant pair,
when the reactor cell pressure exceeds +2.0 psig or when the radiation
monitors, RM-565A and B, in the cell evacuation line indicate excessive
radicactivity in the cell atmosphere.

1.5.4 Containment System Instrumentation

Containment requirements are met by providing at least two inde-
pendent, reliable barriers, in series, between the interior of the pri-
mary system and the atmosphere. For example, the two-barrier concept
is fulfilled by:

l. two independent, reliable, controlled block valves with independent
instrumentation,

2. one controlled block valve plus a restriction such as a charcoal bed
which will limit the escape of activity to the stack to less than the
maximum permissible concentration,

3. one controlled block valve plus two check valves,
4. two solid barriers (vessel or pipe walls),

5. one solid barrier and one controlled block valve,

[0]

6. one solid barrier and one check valve.

 

23These drain lines, 806-2 and 807-2, shown in Fig. 1.5.6, were added
after the MSRE was in operation. Development tests disclosed that par-
tially filled steam drums tended to corrode at the water line.

 
 

 

72

The recommended design practices outlined previously in this section
apply to the reliable instrumentation and control equipment used to op-
erate the block valves. Block valves, generally, are not located at such
a distance from the containment penetration that the lines become tenuous
extensions of the containment vessel. Valves and other devices used in
lieu of solid barriers will be routinely tested and demonstrated to be
capable of maintaining leakage below the specified tolerance when closed.

1.5.4.1 Helium Supply Block Valves

Figure 1.5.7 shows the helium supply lines to the primary contain-
ment vessel and the associated valves used for control and blocking these
supply lines against the escape of radioactivity from the primary system
as a result of reverse flow or back diffusion. This sketch does not show
the fuel storage tank (FST) and line 530, which supplies pressurizing
helium to this tank. This line is blocked by HCV-530-Al. Two types of
input signals are used to initiate helium supply block valve closure.

The first, a reduction in the supply pressure from its normal value of
40 psig to 28 psig, actuates pressure switches and closes all the inlet
helium block valves. The second, excess radiation measured by RM-5964A,
B, and C in any of the helium lines supplying the level probes (bubblers)
and pressure measuring instruments in the pump bowl and overflow tank,
closes the block valves in these lines. A reduction in helium supply
pressure in line 500 from its regulated value of 40 psig indicates a
leaky rupture disk or leaky piping and, possibly, a loss of primary con-
tainment.

In-service testing of the loss-of-pressure channels is accomplished
by opening the hand valves on the lines to the pressure switches on the
main supply pipe (Line 500), one at a time, and observing the action of
the relays in the two-out-of-three coincidence matrix in the control room.
Actual block valve closure is not tested with this procedure. Low- and
high-pressure alarms are provided on line 500; these will actuate before
the safety system pressure switches close the block valves. Additional
testing of the solenoid block valves in the helium bubbler lines is pro-
vided by closing each valve individually and observing the pressure change
downstream of the hand throttling valve.

The three radiation monitoring safety input channels, RM-596A, B,
and C, are tested by exposing each individual radiation element to a
source and noting the response of the output relays which produce valve
closure. Since two-out-of-three coincidence is used, this test will not
perturb the system; neither does it provide a valve closure test.

1.5.4.2 0ff-Gas System Monitoring

The off-gas system (Fig. 1.5.8) is monitored for excess radiation
in four places:

1. Iine 557. — This line receives off-gas from the main and auxiliary
charcoal beds, helium from the coolant salt pump, and helium from
the salt pump lube oil systems and the sampler-enricher.

2. Line 528. — This line carries helium from the coolant salt circu-
lating pump. Its primary purpose is to detect an internal leak in
the fuel-to-coolant-salt heat exchanger. Should such a leak occur,
 

73

fission product activity will be carried into line 560 by the purge-
gas flow across the coolant salt pump bowl. This line is monitored
by RM-528B and C. Note that RM-557A and B provide a redundant indi-
cation of this activity level.

3. Line 565. — This line is used to pump the reactor and drain tank
cells down to the operating pressure of 12.7 psia. A portion of
this line continuously carries a small flow of cell air, via bypass
line 566, across the component cooling pumps which circulate cell
alr (see Fig. 1.5.8). This continuous flow is monitored by RM-
565A and B.

4, Off-Gas Stack. — Stack gas monitoring is not a part of the MSRE safety
system but is noted here for completeness. Refer to Sect. 2.11 for
a description of this monitor. Its only output function is to pro-
vide alarms. The stack gas monitor, located on the off-gas stack,
provides a final check on the off-gas just before it is discharged
to the atmosphere and after it has been filtered. Excess radio-
activity in the stack gas is alarmed in the MSRE control room, and
an alarm signal is also transmitted to the ORNL Central Monitoring
Facility.

It can be seen from Figs. 1.5.8 and 1.5.2 that an excess radio-
activity signal from either RM-557A or B produces three output actions,
all intended to preserve containment; these are as follows:

1. Closes HCV-557-ClL in line 557. This line is, in effect, the main
helium off-gas exhaust header leading to the off-gas stack filters
and carries off-gas from several sources, namely:

a) the fuel salt circulating pump,

b) the fuel salt drain tanks,

c) the coolant salt pump,

d) the coolant salt drain tanks,

e) the fuel salt sampler-enricher,

f) the fuel and coolant salt pump lube oil systems (Fig. 1.5.9).

2. Closes valve PCV-510-A2.
3. Closes valve PCV-513-A2.

Actions 2 and 3 block the helium off-gas lines from the lube oil sys-
tems (Fig. 1.5.9).

Radiation monitors RM-528B and C in line 528, carrying helium from
the coolant pump, are necessary because they will provide an indication
if a leak exists in the salt-to-salt heat exchanger (from the fuel salt
loop to the coolant salt loop). Such a leak could put fission products
in the coolant salt; however, when the coolant salt circulating pump is
running, the coolant salt pressure in the heat exchanger tubes is greater
than the fuel salt pressure in the shell. The fission product gases would
be carried from the free surface in the coolant salt pump bowl into line
528. This activity will be read first by RM-528B and C and then by RM-
557A and B. The output actions produced by RM-528B or C (see also Fig.
1.5.2 and Table 1.5.1) are the following: (1) drain the reactor vessel,

 

 
 

74

and (2) stop the fuel salt pump .24 This also produces a rod scram if O
the reactor is operating above heat loss power, 15 kw. The sequence
of control actions which scram the rods is described in Sect. 2.6.
Excess radioactivity in either the reactor or the drain tank cells
is detected by RM-565A or B., Either monitor will produce protective
actions thus:

1. Closes HCV-565-Al in line 565. This line, the cell evacuation line
(Fig. 1.5.8), is used to exhaust the reactor and drain tank cells
when they are being pumped down to thelr operating pressure of 12.7
psia.

2. Closes the steam dome condensate drain valves ESV-806-2A and ESV-
806-28 (see Fig. 1.5.6).

3. Closes block valves HCV-566-A1l, A2, A3, and A4 to and from the ana-
lyzer which monitors the oxygen content of the in-cell atmosphere.
This analyzer (Fig. 1.5.12), is located in the vent house.

4. Closes block valve HCV-915-Al, which carries exhaust cooling air to
fhe yrod drives and the control rod thimbles (see Fig. 2.7.12 in Sect.
2.7).

5. Drains the reactor vessel. The reactor drain system is described
in Sect. 4.7.

These systems may be tested by inserting a radiation source in the
radiation monitor shields and observing (1) the radistion-monitor indi-
cator, (2) the control circuit relays, and (3) the output actions of the
control valves and other controlled elements which provide protection. oO
The three pairs of radiation monitors, RM-528B and C, RM-557A and B,
and RM-565A and B, all operate so that sn excess radiation signal from
either channel in a pair will produce safety action.

Since these are all one-out-of-two systems, on-line testing of any
channel will produce protective control actions and, to an extent, perturb
the operating system. The system disturbances caused by on-line testing
of RM-557A and B and RM-565A and B can be tolerated if the test is of
short duration. It was necessary to provide jumpers for on-line testing
of RM-528B and C. Without jumpering, a test of either channel will stop
the fuel salt pump and, if the reactor is at power, scram the rods. This
is unacceptable operationally. Jumpering is the preferred alternative
to omitting in-service testing. Testing these safety channels is, there-
fore, subject to very strict administrative control. The jumpers bypass
contacts K-26C and K-27C in circuit 147, which starts and stops the fuel
salt pump. As has been pointed out in footnote 24, these contacts do
not produce a safety-grade protective action.

The MSRE off-gas sampler will (1) utilize on-line instruments to
provide a semicontinuous indication of contaminant level and (2) iso-
late samples which may be transferred to a hot cell for analysis. The
off-gas sampler (Fig. 1.5.10) was designed and installed after the re-

 

245topping the pump is not required to ensure safety. It may tend
$0 reduce the rate but will not eliminate leakage.

C
 

75

actor was placed in operation. Reference 25 contains a brief, conceptual
description of the sampler as originally proposed. In the current ver-
sion the chromatograph cell has been omitted pending further development
work. Figure 1.5.8 shows the location of the sampler with respect to
the main off-gas system.
The samples are obtained from line 522, which carries fuel pump
bowl sweep gas to the off-gas system. Bypass lines with valves across
the piping to and from the analyzer permit taking the sample either be-
fore or after the gas has passed through the charcoal filter and the
particle trap. The sampler is located in the trench immediately south
of the vent house. The reactor off-gas is highly radioactive, and since
this equipment is an extension of the primary containment into an area
frequented by operating personnel, the use of block valves in the supply
and return piping to the sampler is mandatory. The sampler is well
shielded and, except perhaps for the thermal conductivity cells (these
cells are tested at 20 psig), meets the general MSRE containment require-
ments with respect to pressure rating and leak-tightness. The sampler
is housed in a ventilated enclosure which is exhausted to the off-gas
stack. Continuous circulation within the enclosure is maintained by two
(for redundancy) blowers. This flow loop is monitored by two flow switches,
FS-54-D and FS-54-C, connected to a single alarm. Excess radioactivity
in this circulating air is detected by two separate, independent channels
of radiation detection equipment, RM~-54A and RM-54B. A high-radiation
signal from either monitor will close block valves ESV-537A and B and
ESV-538A and B, redundant pairs in the inlet and outlet lines to and
from the sampler. The circuits which control these valves are shown in
Fig. 1.5.11. These valves are also closed (see output XVI, Fig. 1.5.2)
if the pressure in the reactor and drain tank secondary containment cells
rises above +2.0 psig or if the fuel pump bowl pressure exceeds 10 psig.
The cell pressure safety channels and the protective instrumentation
used to measure pump bowl pressures were described earlier in this section.
The atmosphere in the MSRE containment is kept at no more than 5%
oxygen, with the remainder being nitrogen. Oxygen content is continuously
monitored by an on-line analyzer which measures the magnetic susceptibility
of the cell atmosphere. The analyzer and its operation are described in
detail in Sect. 6.4.
Figure 1.5.12 shows the analyzer flowsheet and the final control
circuitry which closes the block valves to and from the analyzer. The
inlet gas to the analyzer is taken from the cell evacuation line, 565,
and is discharged to line 566. These two lines form a low-flow bypass
loop across the component cooling pumps which continuously circulate the
air within the containment cells. The piping to and from the analyzer
meets containment requirements; the analyzer, rated at 30 psig, does not.
Block valves are required for containment and because the instrument
is located in an accessible, frequently used area and is not entirely
protected from mechanical damage. The block valves also permit main-
tenance and routine operations such as changing the cylinders of ref-
erence gas and purge nitrogen.

Block valve operation is apparent from Fig. 1.5.12. The valves :
are automatically closed if either channel, RM-565B or C, in the two- \
channel radiation monitor, signals excess radioactivity in the cell

atmosphere or if the pressure in the secondary containment cell ex-

ceeds +2.0 psig. These input channels have been described previously

in this section. Complete on-line testing is possible, since block

valve closure can be checked by observing the rotameters in the ana-

lyzer. A complete test involving any two channels of the cell pres-

sure input instrumentation is not conducted during reactor operation,

since this same test, described earlier in this section, causes un-

acceptable system changes elsewhere. The radiation channels are tested

with a source, on-line, and the block valves and the control circuits

are redundant.

1.5.4.3 In-Cell Liquid Waste and Instrument Air Block Valves

The in-cell (secondary containment) liquid waste lines are blocked
if the reactor cell pressure exceeds 2 psig (see Fig. 1.5.13 and input
XIII, Fig. 1.5.2). The normal operating pressure in the containment
cells is 12.7 psia. Excess cell pressure is a symptom of system mal-
function or, at worst, the maximum credible accident.! The protective
instrumentation and control hardware and blockage of instrument air
lines have been described earlier in this section.

1.5.4.4 In-Cell Cooling Water Block Valves

A simplified flow diagram of the in-cell cooling water system, with
instrumented block valves, is shown in Fig. 1.5.14. The signal to close
the block valves is provided by an excess radiation level in the pump o
return header. Three independent sensors, RE-827A, B, and C, initiate
block valve operation when any two of the input channels indicate excess
radiation in line 827. Operation of the system is apparent from Fig.
1.5.14. Testing is accomplished during operation by manually inserting
a radiation source in the monitor shield (refer also to Sect. 2.10) and
observing that the indicated radiation level increases and that the
proper relays operate. The construction of the sensor shield is such
that each radiation monitoring channel can be tested individually. Since
the monitor contacts are arranged in two-out-of-three coincidence, test-
ing of individual channels does not close the valves. The valves may
be tested individually by operating a hand switch and observing that
flow stops in the line under test. The complete system is tested during
shutdown.
Valve ESV-DGT serves as a backup to FSV-837-Al, FSV-841-Al1, FSV-
846-A1, FSV-847-Al and provides redundant blocking in the system. The
thermal shield is protected from excess hydraulic pressure by the rupture
disk in line 844. Pressure control valve PCV-844C and block valve FSV-
844-A1, actuated by either pressure switch PSS-844-Bl or valve position
switch ZS-847-A2 on valve FSV-841-Al, prevent breaking the rupture disk
with the transient pressure surge produced by closing FSV-847-Al., Valve
FSV-844~A1 is also closed by the action of pressure switch PSS-855-Al
when the pressure downstream from the rupture disk exceeds 5 psig.
This action serves two purposes: (1) maintains some protection of the
thermal shield if downstream pressure develops on the rupture disk, and
(2) minimizes the loss of cooling water when the rupture disk does burst. O
 

77

Any water discharged through a burst rupture disk passes into the
vapor condensing system and is contained.

1.5.5 Underpressure Protection for the Secondary
Containment Cells

Failure or malfunction of the pressure control system for the com-
ponent cooling pumps, if undetected, could lead to a dangerous subatmos-
pheric pressure reduction, causing a buckling type of failure of the
secondary containment structure. Protection against such an event is
provided by a three-channel, reliable system, schematically identical to
that used for cell overpressure protection described above and earlier
in this section.

If cell pressure falls to less than 12.2 psia, a control-grade alarm
sounds. The safety-grade instruments (pressure switches) actuate at 10.7
psia (input X1I, Fig. 1.5.2) and produce two protective actions: (1) shut
off both component cooling pumps, and (2) close HCV-565-A1 in the cell
evacuation line (Fig. 1.5.8), thereby preventing further outflow of cell
air to the stack.

 

1.5.6 Fuel Salt Sampler-Enricher Containment Instrumentation

The sampler-enricher is fully described in Sect. 3.12 and in refs.
2629. When in use it must penetrate the primary containment and, there-
fore, is potentially capable of contaminating the area and exposing its
operators to all the various types of radioactivity associated with nu-
clear fuel. The material in this section is limited to a functional de~
scription of the more important instrumentation and controls whose sole
purpose is to prevent a loss of contsinment.

Figure 1.5.15 is a simplified line drawing which illustrates the
operation of the sampler-enricher. It can be seen that sampling or en-
riching is accomplished by lowering and raising the cable-suspended cap-
sule into and out of the fuel pump bowl. Throughout most of its travel
the capsule 1s guided by and contained in the transfer tube, which pro-
vides direct access to the molten salt in the pump bowl. The sampling-
enriching operation may be likened to withdrawing or adding water to or
from a well with the "old oaken bucket” powered by a motor-driven winch.
Containment is effected during these operations by subdividing the region
through which the capsule travels into compartments which are opened and

closed in sequence so that two containment barriers are maintained. The
regions which are considered to be primary containment are:

1. area 1A, the transfer tube between the maintenance valve and the
pump bowl;

2. area 1B, the transfer tube between the maintenance valve and the
operational valve;

3. area 1C and the short length of transfer tube which connects area
1C to the operational valve. Note that area 1C houses the motor-
driven winch which raises and lowers the capsule.

Compartmentalization and closure of these primary contaeinment regions is
obtained by the maintenance and operational valves and by the port which
closes the access to area 1C.

Since a complete sampling or enriching procedure requires that the
material, either fresh salt or hot sample, pass through both the primary
and the secondary containment barrier, the latter is also compartmented.
These compartments are maintained by

1. The access port, which separates the primary and secondary contain-
ment regions, 1C and 3C respectively.

2. The removal valve, which when closed, is the secondary containment
barrier across the path traversed by the capsule. Note that area
3C contains the output side of the manually operated manipulator
which the operator uses to unlatch the capsule from the cable, move
it into area 3C, and thence to the transfer cask via the removal
valve.

Figure 1.5.16 is an austerity version of the sampler-enricher in-
strument flowsheet and shows only the high-quality instrumentation whose
sole purpose is to effect containment. Figure 1.5.17 diagrams the func-
tions of these instruments and controls. Table 1.5.2 shows the normal
aspects or status of the valves and the access door during use and when
not in service. It is proper to point out that the sampler-enricher is
used intermittently and by personnel well trained in its operation. In-
termittent usage and functional requirements resulted in the arrangement
of containment instruments in accordance with Figs. 1.5.16 and 1.5.17.

Where redundancy is not obtained by duplicating individual instru-
ment channels which produce the same specific output action, it is be-
cause the desired protection is obtained by diversity (explained earlier
in this section).

There are additional instruments and alarms required by the device.
These lend support to the high-grade interlocks discussed herein; the
reader 1s referred to Sect. 3.12 for more information.

2. SAFETY INSTRUMENTATION AND REACTOR CONTROL

2.1 NUCLEAR INSTRUMENTATION: INSTALLATION AND LOCATION

All permanent neutron sensors are located in a single penetration.
The penetration is a 3-ft-diem pipe installed at an angle of 42° to the
horizontal so that its lower end is opposite the midplane of the reactor
core and its upper end terminates on the main floor in the high-bay area.
Figures 2.1.1 and 2.1.2 are plan and elevation views, respectively, of
the installed penetration. The lower end of the penetration passes
through the thermal shield, and the end closure plate is essentially
flush with the inner periphery of the thermal shield. The penetration
is, from a containment standpoint, an extension of the secondary contain-
ment shell. The lower end of the tube is welded to the containment shell,
and the upper end is embedded in the earth fill and the concrete floor.

A bellows-type expansion joint accommodates thermal expansion between
these points. ©Since penetration was installed during modifications to
the containment shell, it was stress-relieved and pressure-tested at the
same time.

The penetration is filled with water to within approximately 1 ft
from its upper end. A float-type instrument monitors the water level and
gives an alarm when the level changes more than 4 in. Water is added
with a hand valve adjacent to the upper end of the penetration in the
high-bay area. A 5-gpm pump circulates the water in the penetration to
reduce temperature gradients and maintain a uniform concentration of cor-
rosion inhibitor. The inhibitor, containing lithium nitrite (LiNO,) and
lithium borate (1LiH,B03), has 810 ppm of NO, and 57 ppm of boron. The
solution is sampled periodically and tested to maintain the pH at 9.0 #*
0.2.

The penetration is designed to accommodate ten ion chambers. Each
chamber is located in an individual guide tube; four tubes are 5 in. ID
and six are 4 in. ID. The configuration of these tubes within the
penetration and the types of chambers assigned to them are shown in Fig.
2.1.3. The guide tubes are not made of single lengths of 30-ft-long
tubes; instead subassemblies, each approximately 10 ft long, were made
by welding the tubes into end plates, or bulkheads, and the subassemblies
were bolted together when installed in the penetration. The tubes were
constructed this way (Fig. 2.1.4) because there was not enough headroom
behind the upper end of the penetration to ease the handling problem at
assembly. The tubes are open to the water in the penetration, and the
upper, or last, bulkhead plate serves as the cover plate over the end of
the penetration. Individual, smaller cover plates are used over the
upper end of each tube. These contain the necessary gland-type fittings
for signal leads and push rods for chamber positioning. Figure 2.1.5
shows the upper end of the penetration with the guide tubes and individual
cover plates installed. One of two ORNL model Q-2545 wide-range counting
channel drive units (see Sect. 2.3) is shown installed in the penetration.

97

 
 

98

The mounting flanges on these drive units fit the drilling for the cover
plates, so that a complete drive unit is handled as a module which is in-
serted in a tube and bolted in place.

Early critical tests disclosed that the curve of neutron flux in
the penetration vs distance deviated grossly from the desired exponential
type of curve. The deviation was beyond the capabilities of the compen-
sating function generator (see Sect. 2.3) in the wide-range counting
channel. Cadmium sleeves! were placed around guide tubes 6 and 9 to
shield the fission counters from neutrons which entered from the side
end distorted the curve of count rate vs distance. The design of the
shields, their location, and their effect on the count rate as a function
of distance in guide tube 6 are depicted in Fig. 2.1.6.

Figure 2.1.7 is a diagram of the interconnection wiring layout. As
much as possible the safety system wiring was separated from control and
power wiring. It was not feasible to separate the first runs of cabling
from the drive units to the junction boxes on the reactor cell wall.
These jumper cables (described in more detail in Sect. 2.7) contain all
the electrical leads in a single well-protected bundle.

The safety system interconnections, consisting of the wiring to the
clutch coils and the potentiometers in the rod drive unit and the signal
and chamber voltage leads to the safety chambers in the instrument pene-
tration, are in individual and separate conduits to the control room.
Except where absolutely necessary, these safety interconnections are
unbroken by terminal blocks, connectors, ete. All the in-cell wiring
(excluding jumper cables) is entirely with mineral-insulated, copper-
sheathed cables.

Control-grade wiring, not subject to the restrictions imposed by
separation, protection, and independence, is run in trays and conduits
as dictated by cost and convenience.

2.2 BF; INSTRUMENTATION o

2.2.1 General

The MSRE is equipped with one channel of sensitive BF3 counting
equipment. The counting chamber is located in guide tube 2 (Figs. 2.1.4
and 2.1.5). The electronic instruments used with these chambers follow

typical practice (Fig. 2.2.1).

This sensitive BF; channel is required to get counting-rate "con-
fidence" at the neutron source level when the reactor is less than half
filled or when it is being filled with flush salt. Except for the pre-
amplifier, the electronic instruments shown in Fig. 2.2.1 are mounted in
the nuclear instrument cabinet in the auxiliary control room. As soon
as confidence is established by one or both wide-range counting channels,
the BF3 chamber is withdrawn manually to prevent its being damaged.

2.2.2 BF3 Counter

The neutron counter is a BF; counter from Reuters-Stokes Company,
No. RSN-28A, procured on UCNC purchase order No. 568-1724, May 11, 1964.
The specifications and characteristics are as follows:

107

For use in the MSRE, the counter is encased in a weighted water-
proof can, described by Instrumentation and Controls Division drawings
Q-2719-3 and -4. A jointed push rod is used as a handle to position the
counter within the guide tube in the penetration.

2.2.3 High-Voltage Power Supply

The high-voltage power supply is manufactured by Electronic Research
Associates, model 25/10UC. The output from the power supply is contin-
uously adjustable from 500 to 2500 v dc, positive or negative, by six
step-switch positions and a fine control. Maximum load current is 10 ma
for any voltage. The total amount of ripple, hum, and noise is less
than 5 mv rms. ILine regulation is 0.005% for a +10% change of line
voltage. load regulation is a 60-mv change from no load to full load;
recovery time is less than 10 msec. Front panel meters indicate from O
to 10 ma and from O to 2500 v dec. The input is 115 + 10 v ac, 60-hertz,
single-phase, l-amp.

2.2.4 Preamplifier, ORNL Model Q-1857

The preamplifier consists of a three-stage feedback loop, followed
by a resistance-capacitance differentiator, and a second three-stage
feedback loop. The third stage of the second loop is a power stage to
drive a long, low-impedance transmission line. The gain of each loop is
about 20. A 2.5:1 voltage loss occurs in the differentiator, so that
the overall gain is about 150. Variable compensation is provided across
the feedback resistor in each loop to produce satisfactory transient
response. The preamplifier power supply is self-contained.

2.2.5 Pulse Amplifier, ORNL Model Q-1875

The output of the ORNL model Q-1857 preamplifier is developed across
a 100-ohm resistor in the amplifier chassis. This resistor serves as
the characteristic impedance termination for the transmission line from
the preamplifier. The signal is coupled to a gain control whose output
supplies the signal to the pulse amplifier.

The pulse amplifier has two separate three-stage amplifiers with
feedback loops. The compensation on each feedback loop is adjustable:
compensation is used in the first amplifier to adjust the rise time of
the amplifier and in the second amplifier to make the transient response
satisfactory. The gain of each loop is approximately 100, but, due to
losses in the output cathode followers, the overall gain is about 5000.

The output of the main amplifier is available at "low" and "high"
output jacks. The low output is intended for driving long cables and
has a maximum value of 5 v. The high output will deliver approximately
100 v.

A pulse-height selector (PHS) is included on the amplifier chassis
for measuring pulses between O and 100 v. The PHS is direct reading with

 
 

108

an accuracy of approximately 0.5 v. Two PHS outputs are provided: the
first, a positive pulse with an amplitude of 3 v and a width of 0.4 usec,
intended for driving a count rate meter, appears at CN6; the second, with
an amplitude of about 20 v negative and of slightly longer duration, ap-
pears at CN5. The second is intended for driving a scaler.

The amplifier contains its own power supply and is designed to
operate with 115-v, 60-Hz power.

2.2.6 Scaler, ORNL Model Q-1743

The scaler has a fast input decade consisting of a type 6700 beam
switching tube, a Schmitt trigger, and slow decades which are Ericsson
GC-10B glow transfer tubes. Each glow transfer tube is driven by a de-
coupled 1AG4 tube. The glow tube stages are followed by a pulse shaper,
register driver, and a six-digit mechanical register. The instrument
contains a regulated power supply. The input resolving time is 1 psec,
with a counting loss of less than 0.2% at 20,000 random counts per
second.

2.2.7 logarithmic Count Rate Meter, ORNL Model Q-751

This instrument measures the average rate of a series of electrical
pulses. The input pulses are the output from the pulse-height selector
(Sect. 2.2.5). The pulses are randomly spaced, positive 3 v amplitude
and 0.4 psec long. The output of the instrument is logarithmic and spans
four decades. The average counting rate, in counts per second, is dis-
played on a meter. In addition, provision is made for remote readout on
either a remote meter or a 10-mv recorder, or both. The indicating meter
is graduated from 1 to 10,000 counts/sec.

2.2.8 Confidence Trips

This instrument is composed of two Control Data Corporation,
Magsense level comparators. Each unit is designed to accept an input of
O to 100 pa de. The trip is continuously adjustable in this range. The
trip level and hysteresis are adjustable by potentiometers mounted on
the rear panel. The output consists of two SPDT relay contacts.

2.3 WIDE-RANGE COUNTING CHANNELS

2.3.1 Principle of Operation

The wide-range counting channel employs a 2-in.-diam, 6-~1/2-in.-
long fission chamber as the neutron sensor and is useful from startup
(with a fully fueled core vessel) to full-power operation at 10 Mw. The
principle of its operation, described elsewhere,l? is repeated here as
a convenience to the reader.

The design of this wide-range counting system is explained by ex-
amining the behavior of a movable neutron sensor submerged in, or sur-
rounded by, & neutron reflecting and absorbing medium in which the neu-
tron attenuation with distance is approximately exponential. For purposes
of explanation it is sufficient to consider the idealized case in which
neutron attenuation as a function of distance from the neutron source is
exactly exponential. For this idealized situation

CR = Pe M* | (1)

where CR is the count rate in counts per second, P is the reactor power
(assumed proportional to flux), x is the distance from the reactor, and
pi is the attenuation coefficient of the medium surrounding the fission
chamber. Rearrangement gives

log P = log CR + EX . (2)

It is apparent from Eq. (2) that log P is the sum of two easily obtained
numbers: the logarithm of the counting rate (log CR) and the distance,
x, of the sensor from the neutron source multiplied by a constant, u.
Inverse reactor period is obtained in the usual way by differentiating
Eq. (2) with respect to time.

Pigure 2.3.1 is a simplified diagram of the arrangement of the in-
struments that perform the operations of measuring the neutron flux and
distance, obtaining a logarithm, adding, and differentiating. In the
MSRE (or any other installation), neutron attenuation is not ideally ex-
ponential,? as assumed in the preceding paragraph; instead, uL varies
with x, and the form of this variation can only be established by exper-
iments with the equipment installed for use at the reactor. An adjust-
able position-sensing device, the ORNL model Q-2616 function generator,
produces a signal proportional to ux, The adjustment feature provides
a means to compensate for variations in p with x and, further, permits
these adjustments in situ.

The fission chamber is moved toward or away from the reactor by a
servomechanism which attempts to maintain a constant output from the
count rate meters. The value of this constant output (the count rate
set point) is, within limits, arbitrary. It should be high enough to
ensure a good signal-to-noise ratio in the input to the count rate
meters, but it should not be so high that fission counter life is seri-
ously reduced. A typical value for the count rate set point is 10,000
counts/sec. These wide-range channels can provide useful operating and
control information as long as the counting rate is in the range from 1
to 100,000 counts/sec. Limiting values of count rate are used to pro-
vide control system interlocks, discussed in detail in Sect. 2.6. The
operation of a wide-range counting channel is explained in the discus-
sion by tracing its response as the reactor goes from subcritical to
full-power operation. Figure 2.3.2 shows curves of count rate and
chamber position during a traverse of the reactor through its power
range. The curves are based on the assumption that the count rate set
point has been established at 10,000 counts/sec.

In the source and very low power region, where the count rate is
less than the set-point value of 10,000 counts/sec, the error signal,
which is the algebraic difference between the actual count rate and the
set point, is negative. This causes the servomechanism to drive the
chamber toward the reactor until its lower limit is reached. The cham-
ber will remain inserted at the lower limit until the reactor power is
sufficiently large to produce a count rate of 10,000 counts/sec. While
the chamber is at the lower limit, px is constant, and (see Fig. 2.3.1)
the rise in reactor power is followed by the output of the logarithmic
count rate meter. When the reactor power is high enough to produce
10,000 counts/sec with the chamber at the lower limit, the error signal
becomes positive and the servomechanism withdraws the fission chamber
to maintain the count rate constant at 10,000 counts/sec. Changes in
reactor power are now indicated by changes in the "compensated position,’
ux, the output of the ORNL model Q-2616 function generator.

If, for example, the count rate set point is changed arbitrarily
from 10,000 to 12,000 counts/sec while the chamber is partially with-
drawn and the reactor is in steady state, the servomechanism will insert
the chamber a sufficient distance to satisfy the increased count rate
request. The decreased value of px will exactly equal the increase in
log CR, and the sum of the two, log P, will remain constant, as it
should. Again, suppose that, with the reactor in steady state, the
operator switches from servo control of position to manual control and
arbitrarily withdraws the chamber a short distance, The decrease in
log CR will be balanced by the increase in px, and their sum, log P,
will remain constant. Now, suppose the operator continues to withdraw
the chamber manually so that the counting rate approaches 2 counts/sec,
which has been established as the useful threshold operating value for
the system. The count rate signal will contain a higher percentage of
spurious electrical input "noise," and, also, the random variations in
the neutron flux will become more apparent as the count rate is de-
creased,

In common with all counting instruments of this general type, the
response of the count rate meter becomes progressively slower as the
count rate decreases. The loss in response is such that when the count
rate is reduced to about 500 counts/sec, the logarithmic count rate
 

113

meter is unable to follow the change in count rate produced by manual
chamber withdrawal. Therefore, in such a case, the indicated power
would lag and would be higher than actual power. This response lag
would continue to produce an error, and the indicated power reading
would be higher than actual power until the chamber had stopped moving
and enough time had elapsed to attain steady state in the new position.
This situation obtains regardless of whether the chamber is being in-
serted or withdrawn manually. In manual insertion at count rates below

500 counts/sec, the indicated power will lag and appear lower than actual
power. As the count rate is lowered, the output of the counting system,
log P, may become erratic and fluctuste about the average value. At
very low counting rates the ratio of useful signal to noise decreases
and accuracy suffers. If chamber withdrawal continues until the count
rate becomes less then 2 counts/sec, the confidence circuits will be
actuated and the "no-confidence" interlocks governed by that channel
will be established. If the reverse process takes place, the chamber
may be inserted until the counting rate becomes 50,000 counts/sec, at
which point the confidence circuits will also be actuated. This upper
bound of system operation was established at this value to keep the
instruments within their operating range. The confidence circuits and
their functions are discussed in Sect. 2.6.6.

From the foregoing it is evident that, if the count rate is 500
counts/sec or more, the servo need be fast enough to follow only normal
maneuvers; any transients too fast for the servo to follow will change
the count rate so that the channel will read correctly. This technique
has several advantages: the operator need not switch range or take any
other action, the system covers a very wide range of reactor power,
manual withdrawal of the chamber and the dead time induced when the
chamber is withdrawn are eliminated, and the constant, optimum count
rate of the amplifier is maintained when sufficient flux is available.

Figure 2.3.3 is a detailed block diagram of a wide-range counting
channel as used in the MSRE and includes the ORNL model Q-2609 fast-trip
comparators (described in Sect. 2.5) which produce the trip signals re-
quired by the reactor control system. The increased number of operational
amplifiers shown in Fig. 2.3.2 are required to obtain signal gain for
impedance matching to output devices and for signal inversion (sign
change).

The detector, preamplifier, and radistion-resistant interconnecting
cable are contained in an integral assembly, ORNL model Q-2617. This
assembly, approximately 2 in. OD, is flexible so that a guide tube or
thimble, curved if required, can be installed in the reactor shielding
leading to the core. The assembly is waterproof and can operate con-
tinuously in an ambient temperature of 100°C while surrounded by either
air or water.

The detector is a fission chamber with concentric cylindrical elec-
trodes coated with 1 mg/cm? of 235U over a total area of 860 cm?®. The
chamber is well saturated with 200 v applied; the operating polarizing
potential is 270 v. The collection time is approximately 80 nsec. The
pulse-height characteristics of the chamber, obtained by using the pre-
amplifier described below, are shown in Fig. 2.3.4. It is evident that
gamma. pileup presents no problem, even in fields as high as 2 X 10% r.
The chamber has ceramic insulation entirely, and the special cable con-

 
 

114

necting the chamber to the preamplifier is designed to withstand a
gamma-ray dose of 1010 r, "

The output stage of the preamplifier drives one side of a balanced
line, the other side of which is terminated symmetrically. This sym-
metry and careful attention to shielding and grounding make the assembly,
as demonstrated in many field tests, very insensitive to electrical noise
pickup.

The receiving end of the balanced line feeds a pulse transformer
for common-mode rejection and clipping to give an approximately sym-
metrical waveform. This avoids base-line shifts due to changes in
counting rate and aids in keeping the discrimination level constant.

Pulses from the pulse transformer are sent to the pulse amplifier
and count rate meter, ORNL model Q-2614. Following a calibrated at-
tenuator the pulses are amplified in two feedback stages, each with a
gain of 10, and enter a biased amplifier whose variable bias level de-
termines the discrimination level. Only pulses that exceed the dis-
crimination level are counted. The output pulses from the biased-ampli-
fier discriminator are shaped and applied to a conventional logarithmic
count rate circuit of the Cooke-Yarborough type. The time constants
are a compromise between the desire to have rapid response and the
necessity to prevent excessive fluctuation in the period signal.

The output of the log count rate circuit is applied to an ORNL
model Q-2605 operational amplifier (1A in Fig. 2.3.3) whose gain is
adjusted to give an output of 2 v/decade, or 10 v full scale. The
function generator output is applied to amplifier 2B through the nor-
mally closed contacts of Kl. The gain gives an output of 2 v/decade.
Amplifier 2B is also used in a test mode and will be described later. (
The outputs of amplifiers 1A and 2B are summed, with a gain of 1/2, in
amplifier 2A, yielding an output signal proportional to reactor power.
The span of the summing amplifier 2A is 10 v, or 1 v/decade. The out-
puts of the log count rate amplifier (1A), the summing amplifier (24),
and the gain amplifier (3B) are indicated on panel meters in drawer W-1.

The generation of a period signal from the reactor flux signal is
accomplished with operational amplifiers 3A and 3B. The output from
amplifier 3A is the approximate derivative of the log P input with a de
gain of 4 (product of C 308 and R 331). To prevent excessive noise in
the period signal a 250-kilohm input resistor and a l-uf feedback ca-
pacitor are provided to limit the low- and high-frequency noise gain
respectively. The output of amplifier 3A is amplified by amplifier 3B
and is offset so that 0 to +10 v corresponds to a period of —30 to +5
sec, An infinite period is +1.428 v provided by the offset network at
the input of the amplifier, The amplifier gain is 24.6. The pulse
amplifier and count rate meter module, ORNL model Q-2614, has, in ad-
dition to the log count rate output, a simple diode pump circuit (linear
count rate circuit) whose output is used as the signal for the chamber
position servo. This circuit has an output of approximately 1.75 v at
10% counts/sec. This signal is compared with the demand potentiometer
(servo level) in amplifier 1B. Amplifier 1B has a voltage gain of 50;
further voltage and power gain are provided by a servo amplifier, ORNL
model Q-2615, which has an approximate voltage gain of 3 and whose output
drives the servo motor directly. In addition to the chamber, the motor
drives a tachometer whose output is applied to the servo preampiifier o
 

115

1B and with a polarity opposite that of the input signal; this negative
feedback loop provides servo stability.

To provide control interlocks, eight fast-trip comparators, ORNL
model Q-2609, are used. Two fast-trip comparators receive their input
from the log count rate amplifier (1A). Comparator 1 trips if the
counting rate is less than 2 counts/sec, whereas comparator 2 trips if
the counting rate is greater than 50,000 counts/sec. Their output
(relay contacts), in series with the “"calibrate-operate" relay contacts,
provides counting channel confidence if all eight comparators are prop-
erly plugged into the instrument cabinet drawer (see Sect. 2.5 for ad-
ditional discussion of confidence). Summing amplifier 2A provides the
input to three fast-trip comparators. The first comparator operates if
the power "sags" below 200 kw while in the "Run" mode; the second oper-
ates when the power is above 500 kw, thus giving permission to enter the
"Run" mode; and the third initiates a control rod "reverse" if the
power exceeds 1.5 Mw in the "Start" mode.

Several tests are provided to ensure that the system is operating
properly. There is contained in the pulse amplifier module (Q-2614) a
10%-~ and 10-cps oscillator which may be applied to the input of the
pulse amplifier by proper positioning of the gain switch on the front
panel. In addition, with the gain switch on period test, the period
test relay (KL) must be actuated by a push button in drawer W-l. This
switches out the normal inputs and feedback resistors of the function
generator amplifier and switches in a 10-pf feedback capacitor and a
selectable input resistor. With an input of 25 v applied through the
gain switch, this amplifier thus generates a voltage ramp which pro-
duces a 5-, 25-, or 30-sec period indication as selected. An additional
push button in drawer W-1 causes an adjustable voltage source to be ap-
plied to amplifier 2A to test its fast-trip comparator. "In" and "out"
push buttons on the same drawer provide normal override of the normal
servo signal from the output of the Q-2615 module.

The chamber drive mechanism is a ball-bearing lead screw with a
linear speed of approximately 72 in. /min and a total stroke of 90 in.
The direct-current, variable-speed drive motor has an integral tachom-
eter and is protected from overload by a slip clutch. The position~
sensing components are connected directly to the lead screw shaft ahead
of the slip clutch.

The position-sensing train contains a ten-turn potentiometer whose
output is connected to a meter in drawer W-l. In addition, a one-turn
data-logger potentiometer and synchro transmitter for driving a position
indicator on the console is provided. Upper and lower limit switches
restrict the overall travel of the unit.

placed with one of more typically standard dimensions (2 in. diam) with
greater sensitivity. The excerpted text has been altered accordingly.

2.3.2.1 Introduction

To meet the space and environmental requirements for high-perform-
ance reactors, an articulated assembly (Fig. 2.3.5) consisting of a
fission chamber, a preamplifier, and flexible cables has been developed.
Because high-flux reactor cores are usually inaccessible, it becomes
necessary to use a detector that is small and movable in a tube which
can be bent to resolve the access problems at each reactor. The rel-
atively low sensitivity of a small chamber is compatible with the large
neutron source level encountered in such reactors. Locating the pre-
amplifier close to the fission chamber drastically reduces the suscep-
tibility of the counting channel to electrical noise pickup, so that the
system responds predominantly to neutrons; consequently, the reactor
operator is assured of an adequate source. The assembly is particularly
suitable as part of a wide-range counting channel,l but also can be used
as part of a conventional counting channel.

The entire assembly is waterproof and can operate continuously at
a temperature of 100°C ambient. The maximum outside diameter of the
assembly is 2 in. (chamber diameter). The fission chamber and the cable
connecting it to the preamplifier can withstand a total integrated gamma
radiation dose of 10}Y rads; the preamplifier can withstand at least 108
rads.

2.3.2.2 Preamplifier

Circuit
The preamplifier circuit (Fig. 2.3.6) consists of two cascaded
feedback amplifiers: a charge-sensitive input configuration (vy and

Vou) followed by a voltage-sensitive amplifier (Vp Vis and v,) with

symmetric output. The signal pulses are differentiated both at the in-
put and at the output of the preamplifier, giving the pulse shape shown
in Fig. 2.3.7. The gain of the preamplifier is 0.75 x 101? v/coulomb.
This corresponds to a system output pulse height of 150 mv for a nominal
50-Mev fission fragment. The counting loss for randomly spaced pulses
is 10% at a counting rate of 10° counts/sec.

The advantages of a charge-sensitive configuration are that, over
a wide range of detector capacitance, (1) the output signal height de-
pends only on the charge generated within the detector and is insensitive
to the capacitance of the detector and connecting cable (variation of
input capacitance from O to 200 pf produces a gain change of only 10%),
and (2) the decay time of the detector pulse is also insensitive to the
capacitance of the detector and cable (variation of input capacitance
from O to 200 pf produces a decay time change of only 10%).

The preamplifier output is connected to a balanced and shielded
cable which is terminated at its receiving end by a pulse transformer.
The common-mode electrical fluctuation signals picked up by the two
signal leads are canceled in the pulse transformer. In one application
at a reactor the common-mode rejection was greater than 95%.
 

117

The double differentiation reduces the effects of pulse pileup.
With the first differentiator at the input to the preamplifier, the max-
imum counting rate is limited by coincidence loss rather than by bias
shifts. The pulse transformer serves as the second differentiator. The
second differentiation time constant is determined by the ratio of the
primary inductance of the transformer to its terminating resistance.

The combined effect of both differentiators eliminates any duty-cycle
shift in the main-amplifier discriminator threshold. Figure 2.3.7 is a
photograph of the fission pulses at the main amplifier input. The in-
tegrals of the individual pulse areas on either side of the reference
are equal.

Component Selection

The operating temperature, the radiation requirements, and the per-
missible overall diameter of the assembly demanded prudent selection of
the components used in the preamplifier.

Tubes. — Temperature and radiation conditions precluded the use of
transistors; consequently, flying~lead subminiature tubes were selected.
Nuvistors were considered but were rejected because their diameter is
too large to mount components side by side with the tubes in the allotted
space.

Resistors. — Resistors were limited to those of wire-wound and de-
posited-carbon types. The wire-wound resistors (miniature power ratings)
were used in all critical circuit locations sensitive to the value of a
resistor; deposited-carbon resistors were used in noncritical circuits.

Capacitors. — Capacitors were limited to those of porcelain and
solid tantalum electrolytic dielectrics. The particular ceramic capac-
itors used (Vitramon type VK20) have maximal operating conditions of
150°C and 200 v. A 108-rad gamma dose results in a capacitance variation
of less than 1%. The tantalum capacitors (Texas Instrument type SCM)
are used only for bypassing in circuits which can tolerate high leakage
currents and considerable capacitance variations. The operating tem-
perature of the tantalum capacitors is limited to 125°C. As a result,
they are located in the preamplifier layout, where negligible heat power
is dissipated (see the following section). Irradiation tests made at
ORNL on four type SCM tantalum capacitors to an accumulated dose of 108
rads showed an increase of less than 5% for the dissipation factor.

 

Provisions for Operation at 100°C Ambient

For continuous operation of the preamplifier in air or water at
100°C ambient, the following provisions were made:

1. The preamplifier was potted in a mixture of 70 wt % epoxy Helix
P-430 and 30 wt % epoxy Dow Chemical DER 732 to which was added 6% of
Helix hardener B. This particular potting compound improves the heat
transfer and increases the mechanical rigidity of the preamplifier.

The advantages of using this compound are that it is only slightly brit-
tle at room temperature, it shrinks minimally during curing (the shrink-
age of some epoxies during curing has caused tube and tantalum capacitor
breakdowns), and its thermal expansion coefficient is compatible with
that of the preamplifier components.

2. The tube filaments are heated with a voltage of only 5.5 v
(6.3 v rating) to minimize the heat-power generation.
 

 

118

3. The tantalum capacitors (125°C max) are located at the ends of
the preamplifier, whereas the subminiature tubes are positioned in the
center of the preamplifier. The ceramic capacitors (150°C max) are also
located at the ends, except for a group which is placed in a gap between
the first and the second tubes as shown in Fig. 2.3.8.

Two different tests were performed to establish that the capacitors
operate below the manufacturers! specified maximum temperatures when the
preamplifier is in a region with an ambient temperature of 100°C. In
the first test the preamplifier was placed in still air at 100°C in an
oven, In the second test the preamplifier was immersed in water at 98°C.
In both tests five thermocouples were located inside the preamplifier
close to the components of interest, and the time profiles of the tem-
peratures were recorded. The results indicated that the equilibrium
temperatures of all capacitors were at least 6°C below the manufacturers!
maximum specified temperatures in the first test and 14°C in the second
test. The first test lasted ten days; during this time no change in the
preamplifier gain or output pulse shape was observed.

Separation Distance of Preamplifier to Chamber

The separation distance between the preamplifier and the fission
chamber should be short to satisfy the electrical noise pickup consid-
eration, but must be long enough to limit the radiation damage to the
preamplifier. (The preamplifier was designed to withstand an accumu~-
lated dose of 108 rads over one year of continuous operation.) The
evaluation of the effects of the accumulated dose should be separated
into two parts: the dose accumulated during operation of the reactor
at power and the dose accumulated during reactor shutdown. In light-
water-shielded reactors, the dose accumulated during reactor shutdown
is considerably alleviated if the neutron counting rate is restricted
to 10% counts/sec or less. The reason for this is that photoneutrons
generated in the water by the residual fission product gamma rays will
give a neutron counting rate that makes the insertion of the fission
chamber and preamplifier assembly into a higher gamma flux unnecessary
(see Sect. 2.3). For application in light-water-moderated reactors, a
separation length of 4=1/2 ft between the fission chamber and the pre=-
amplifier is adequate, This distance is also sufficient to maintain
the preamplifier in a gamma flux less than 10% r/hr (or 108 r/year)
when the reactor is at full power.

2.3.2.3 Flexible Cables

Cable Between Fission Chamber and Preamplifier

The cable between the fission chamber and the preamplifier is a
BIW 50-ohm coaxial cable enclosed in an external inorganic insulation
sheath (spaghetti). The sheathed cable is inserted into a 1/4-in.-ID
corrugated flexible metal tubing fitted with stainless steel braid and
casing. The BIW cable is a flexible, high-temperature (500°C max),
radiation-resistant coaxial cable. It consists of a 24-gage stranded
nickel-clad copper center conductor, an inorganic insulation, and a
nickel-clad copper outer braid 0.200 in. in OD. Its capacitance is 35
pf/ft. The corrugated tubing provides watertightness and flexibility
 

119

with negligible elongation. The measured linear-expansion coefficients
of the cable assembly are approximately 2 X 10™* per 1b and 1 x 107°
per °C.

Cable Between Preamplifier and Main Amplifier

This cable is a Raychem No, 10023 cable, It has preirradiated
polyethylene dielectrics and jackets, is radiation resistant, and is a
multilead coaxial cable. The center member of this composite cable is
a shielded and jacketed two-conductor coaxial cable for the signals;
around the center member are wound three 26-gage and two 20-gage hookup
wires for preamplifier supplies, and over all of these are a nickel-clad
copper shield and a preirradiated polyethylene jacket. The maximum
overall OD is 0.324 in. The cable will withstand a maximum temperature
of 125°C and an accumulated dose of 5 x 10% rads. Following this ex-
posure the cable can still be coiled on a form whose diameter is ten
times the overall cable diameter.

The Raychem cable is also enclosed within a watertight metallic
envelope which may be varied for different reactor applications. The
metallic envelope also serves as an electrical shield. For example, a
stainless steel hose covered with polyvinyl chloride is used at the Oak
Ridge Research Reactor (ORR).

2.3.2.4 Electrical Shielding Layout

Multiple electrical shields are provided to prevent excessive elec-
trical noise pickup in the fission chamber and preamplifier assembly.
Figure 2.3.9 shows, schematically, the general shielding and grounding
layout. A first (or inner) shield covers the entire path of the signal
from the fission chamber to the main amplifier input. This shield in-
cludes the cathode of the fission chamber, the outer braid of the BIW
coaxial cable, a solid brass foil surrounding the preamplifier, and the
two braids of the Raychem multilead coaxial cable. The preamplifier
common mode, or ground, is electrically connected to the inner shield,
which is electrically insulated from an outer shield, or shell, of the
assembly. This outer shield includes the fission chamber casing, the
corrugated flexible metal tubing between the chamber and the preamplifier,
the preamplifier casing (insulated from the brass foil shield), the me-
tallic envelope surrounding the Raychem cable (described previously),
and a shielding which forms an extension of the metallic envelope to
the main amplifier in the reactor control room. The grounding of the
inner and outer shields is discussed in Sect. 2.3.2.5.

2.3.2.5 Low Pickup~Noise Performance of the Assembly

Extensive experimentation with different counting channels using
this assembly was required to reduce its susceptibility to electrical
noise pickup. The principal source of electrical noise pickup is elec=-
tromagnetic radiation from ac power lines which are shock excited where
some piece of equipment is turned on or off. The sensitivity to noise
pickup has been minimized by the short separation distance between the
preamplifier and the chamber, the large output signal from the pream-
plifier, the balanced configuration with common-mode noise rejection,
and the multiple electrical shielding.

 
 

120

The lowest noise pickup is achieved with this assembly when the
inner and outer shields are connected together in several places, for
example, at the junction box and at the main amplifier, as shown in Fig.
2.3.9, This is contrary to the generally accepted precept of avoiding
ground loops. Apparently, the capacitive coupling between shields de-
feats any attempt at isolation of the system from the building ground.
With the connections described herein and shown in the Fig. 2.3.9, the
pulses from pickup are no larger at the main amplifier input than the
pulses of the alpha particles produced in the fission chamber, even
when the assembly is located in the noisiest reactor installations
available at ORNL.

2.3.3 Preamplifier Power Supply

2.3.3.1 General

The fission chamber and preamplifier dc power supply provides three
regulated output voltages from an unregulated input supply of —32 + 4 v
for use with the fission chamber and preamplifier assembly ORNL model
Q-2617-1. The three outputs are: +300 v for polarization of the fission
chamber, +110 v for the preamplifier anode supply, and —22 v for the
preamplifier vacuum tube heaters and for biasing.

The —22 v is derived directly from the —32-v battery supply through
a series regulator and a current-limiting circuit. The other two volt-
ages, +300 v and +110 v, are developed by a dc-to-dc converter with a
series preregulator.

2.3.3.2 Construction

The fission chamber and preamplifier dc power supply is contained
in a module 4.25 in. wide, 4.72 in. high, and 11.90 in. deep. It is a
standard "three-unit" plug-in module of the ORNL modular reactor in-
strumentation series depicted on drawings Q-2600-1 through Q-2600-5.

The circuits are on two printed circuit boards mounted parallel to
each other and enclosed in a perforated metal shield to reduce electrical
radiation and coupling to other modules. Adjustments and test points
are accessible through the shield from the top of the module.

2.3.3.3 Application

The module is intended to supply all required voltages to the fis-
sion chamber and preamplifier assembly. Because the assembly is potted
and unrepairable, the power supply is designed to limit currents and
voltages to protect both the assembly and the power supply against
damage from almost any conceivable combination of crossed connections
or short circuits.

2.3.3.4 Specifications

2.3.3.5 Circuit Description of the —22-v Supply

The —22-v supply consists of a voltage regulator (Q8, Q9, Q10) and
a current-limiting circuit (Q7, D12, D13). The limiting circuit pro-
tects the series heater string of the preamplifier from damage when ary
of several possible fault conditions occur.

The action of the limiting circuit is similar to that of a con-
stant-current circuit. The base voltage of Q7 is held constant at +2 v
with respect to the —32-v supply by the two Zener diodes D12 and D13.
The breakdown voltages of the diodes are 12 and 10 v, respectively, but
they are connected in opposition so that the reference voltage is the
difference in the two voltages. This arrangement yields a sharper knee
and a stiffer reference voltage than a single low-voltage diode. The
emitter voltage is different from the base voltage only by V. be? the base-

emitter voltage drop of the transistor, which is fairly constant. Thus,
the emitter voltage is constant across a fixed resistance R22 and R26,
yielding a constant current in the emitter of Q7, provided that the
collector-emitter voltage is large enough to keep the transistor out of
saturation. When "normal" output current is flowing (less than the limit
current), the voltage at the collector of Q7 is less than 2 v more pos-
itive than the —32-v supply, and Q7 is saturated. In this condition

Q7 simply acts like a series resistor and does not control the output
current. It is only when the output current tends to increase above
normal that Q7 comes out of saturation and limits the output current to

Vv —-¥

Lint poe + Ro2

 
 

122

where v, is the difference in the breakdown voltages of D12 and D13 and (
Vy 1s the forward base-emitter voltage drop of Q7.

The voltage regulator consists of Q8, Q9, and Q10. The output
voltage is sensed by the base of Q9 and is compared with the voltage
of reference diode D1l4 in the emitter of Q9. The amplified difference
on the collector of Q9 is applied to the base of Q8; Q8 provides current
gain only to drive the base of the output transistor Q10. The regulated
output voltage appears between the emitter of Q10 and ground. Diode D15
is used to protect Q8 from turnon transients.

The output voltage is adjusted with trimpot R30. The current at
which the circuit limits is set with the "current limit" potentiometer
R22.

2.3.3.6 Circuit Description of the +300-v and +110-v Supply

The supply is designed to operate from a nominal 32-v station
battery with a terminal voltage variation from 28 to 36 v dec. This
wide variation makes necessary a voltage preregulation, which consists
of transistors Ql, Q2, Q3, and Q4.

The preregulator output voltage is sensed by resistors R7, R8, and
R9 and applied to the base of amplifier stage Q3. A reference voltage
(16.8 v) generated by Zener diode string D2, D3, and D4 is applied to
the emitter of Q3. The amplified difference appears at the collector
of Q3 and is applied to driver Q2 and pass transistor Q4. A constant
collector current is provided for Q3 by transistor Ql, Zener diode D1,
and the associated network. (

The preregulator output (test point TPL) is filtered by Cl, C2, and
R27 and is applied to the dec-to-dc converter.

Q5, Q6, Tl, and the associated circuitry comprise a free-running
square-wave oscillator inverter. Networks Cl5-R32 and Cl6-R33 round
the edges of the square wave somevhat to avoid the generation of sharp,
high-frequency spikes, which may be coupled to other circuits. The
110-v output is obtained from a full-wave rectifier and filter, and the
300-v output fram a voltage tripler. The supply can be short circuited
without damage. Most transistor inverters will stop oscillating when
overloaded. The oscillator transistors can be damaged unless their non-
oscillating current is limited to a safe value. Current limiting by’
series resistance in a primary lead is undesirable because power will be
wasted and the inverter will have poor load regulation. On the other
hand, biasing so that the transistor current goes to zero in the non-
oscillating condition will not allow oscillations to start when the
short is removed. The current-limiting scheme used here consists of a
combination of clamping and series-emitter resistance to set the current
to a predetermined value. R11 and R12 bias the bases of Q5 and Q6 into
conduction. R13 and Rl4 limit the transistor currents in the nonoscil-
lating condition to a little less than the oscillating currents. The
voltage drop across these resistors is less than the value that causes
apprecisble current flow through D5, D6, and D7 until oscillation begins.
In the oscillating condition, the drops across R13 and Rl4, respectively,
are limited by the diodes to 1.4 v. The low dynamic resistance of the
diodes assures a stable, nonoscillating current value.

2.3.4 Pulse Amplifier

2.3.4.1 General

The pulse amplifier and count rate meter amplifies and counts
pulses from a fission chamber. The input sensitivity is such that some
preamplification is required. The module consists of a pulse amplifier,
a pulse-height discriminator (PHD), a logarithmic count rate meter of
the Cooke-Yarborough type, a linear count rate meter, and two calibration
oscillators (10 and 10% counts/sec).

2.3.4.2 Construction

The pulse amplifier and count rate meter is constructed in a module
5.6 in. wide, 4.72 in. high, and 11.9 in, deep. It is a standard "four-
unit" plug-in module of the modular reactor instrumentation series de-
picted on drawings Q-2600-1 through Q-2600-5,

The pulse-height discriminator and the linear and log count rate
circuits are constructed on one printed circuit board. The pulse am-
plifier and the two oscillators are constructed on separate boards.

The pulse amplifier and discriminator count rate boards are housed in a
cadmium~-plated steel compartment which covers the entire top of the
module. The two boards within this compartment are shielded from each
other by a cadmium-plated partition. The oscillator printed circuit
board is mounted horizontally at the back end of the module beneath the
compartment.

The front panel controls include a ten-turn potentiometer for the
pulse-height discriminator and an 18-position switch for amplifier gain
control (13 positions) and module calibration control. A BNC comnector
is mounted on the front panel to provide a signal for a scaler.

2.3.4.3 Application

The pulse amplifier and count rate meter is one element of a wide-
range counting channel! for monitoring neutron flux over a ten-decade
span. It amplifies pulses from a fission chamber and preamplifier as-
sembly* and provides logarithmic and linear count rate output signals.
An output pulse is also provided to operate a scaler.

The pulses from the preamplifier assembly are bipolar in shape,
which eliminates the problem of duty-cycle shifts in the pulse amplifier.
The pulse amplifier, however, can be used with positive unipolar pulses.
Count rates up to 10% counts/sec of unipolar pulses 1 psec wide can be
accommodated, with a resulting shift in effective pulse amplitude of less
than 1%.

The logarithmic output signal is a current which drives an external,
conventional operational amplifier, The output of the operational am-
plifier is used to operate indicators and other circuits.

The linear output signal is also a current which drives an external,
conventional operational amplifier. The output of the operational am-
plifier is used to operate other circuits. In the wide-range counting
channel, this linear signal is used as the control signal for a servo
system.

The following description of the module (Fig. 2.3.10) is divided
into five main groups: (1) pulse amplifier and control switch; (2)
pulse-height discriminator, which includes the shaper stage and emitter-
follower; (3) pump driver, which includes the flip-flop, Q-25 as a

 
 

 

126

limiter-amplifier, and Q16 and QL7 as the complementary emitter-follower
drive; (4) pump circuits, which include both the log and linear pumps;
and (5) test oscillators.

Pulse Amplifier and Control Switch

The pulse amplifier consists of two fed-back groups which are cas-
caded to achieve an overall gain of 100. Each group has a voltage gain
of about 10. These two stages of amplification are preceded by a ladder=-
type attenuator, where the input impedance is a constant 100 ohms at all
settings and the impedance, looking back from the amplifier input, is
50 ohms. The attenuator is part of an 18-position switch that (1) pro-
vides attenuation of the input signel in 13 positions, (2) disconnects
the amplifier input from the attenuator and grounds it through 100 ohms
in two "off" positions, (3) disconnects the amplifier from the attenuator
and applies 10% counts/sec to its input, (4) disconnects the amplifier
from the attenuator and applies 10 counts/sec to its input, and (5) dis-
connects the amplifier fram the attenuator and supplies a dc voltage for
application to a 5-sec period generator circuit that 1s external to the
module. Also, in all positions other than attenuator positions, the
control switch provides a dc voltage which actuates a front panel light
and can be used to actuate an external alarm.

The pulse amplifier design is tailored to amplify pulses of the
shape shown in Fig. 2.3.11A. This pulse shape is produced by a pre-
amplifier which double differentiates the pulses from a fission chamber
with a 0.125-usec time constant. (The second differentiation is made
at a pulse transformer which terminates the balanced transmission line
driven by the preamplifier.) The preamplifier has a O.l-psec integrating
time constant. The amplifier may also be used to amplify unipolar pulses
clipped to 1 psec width or less, with the possibility that appreciable
base-line shift may occur at counting rates greater than 5 X 10%
counts /sec.

Both fed-back groups are of identical design. Each fed-back group
is a three-transistor configuration, with the first two transistors Ql
and Q2 constituting a differential pair. The output from the second
collector Q2 drives the third transistor Q3, which is an emitter-follower.
Feedback is made from the emitter of Q3 to the base of Q2. The output
signal is taken from the emitter-follower, and the input signal drives
the first base Ql of the differential pair. This results in a group
with an output pulse of the same polarity as that of the input signal.
The pulse gain of the stage is very nearly (R6 + R7)/R6, neglecting the
shunting effect of R8 and R6. The measured” high-frequency feedback
factor for the stage was 10.

The fed-back group is dc-coupled and has excellent de stability by
nature of the differential input and a dc feedback factor in excess of
100. The bias in the amplifier has been selected so that both positive
and negstive portions of the bipolar input signal will be clipped pro-
portionately under overload, thereby retaining its bipolar nature.

 

5The procedure for measurement is given by E, Fairstein, Pulse
Amplifier Manual, ORNL-3348, p. 20 (Oct. 26, 1962).
 

127

A closed-loop analysis, utilizing the hybrid-=n equivalent circuit,
shows that the predominant time constant is nearly C obR16 [(r] +

R15)/R15], where Cop and Ry are the collector transition capacitance and

base resistance of Q2 respectively.

The output impedance of the stage was computed to be 12.6 ohms.®

The ac input impedance of the stage is very nearly equal to that
of the base resistor RL of the input transistor Ql, because the emitter
impedance of Ql is R2 (5.1 kilohms) in parallel with the looking-in
impedance of Q2, which is nearly 300 ohms because of the feedback to
the base of Q2. Thus, with an effective emitter impedance of about 300
ohms, the impedance looking into the base of Ql is about 30 kilohms for

an h_, of 100,
fe

Capacity coupling is used between the two fed-back stages and on
the output to the pulse-height discriminator. These coupling time con-
stants are in excess of 300 usec, which is adequate to eliminate the
effects of any further differentiation. The bipolar nature of the input
signal eliminates any possible duty-cycle shifts across these capacitors.

Pulse-Height Discriminator

The pulse-height discriminator (PHD) is based on a biased amplifier
scheme which is very similar to that used in the pulse amplifier. The
PHD control potentiometer R26 has ten turns, and the dial has 500 divi-
sions. The position of R26 determines the differential bias that exists
between the bases of Q7 and Q8. Since Q8 is conducting at any position
of this potentiometer, any positive input signal applied to the base of
Q7 must exceed this differential before Q7 is brought into conduction,
and any portion in excess of this differential is amplified by a factor
of 10.

The voltage drop across the PHD potentiometer R26 must be 5 v to
achieve the full-range control of 5 v for pulse-height discrimination.
The voltage can be trimmed to this value by adjusting R32. The "zero"
of the PHD can be trimmed by adjusting the values of R24 and R27.

An ac-coupled Schmitt trigger is used to shape the pulse from the
biased amplifier. The trigger sensitivity is 2.5 v. A more sensitive
trigger will create stability problems even though any sensitivity
changes are reduced by a factor of 10 when referred to the pulse am-
plitude. The sensitivity cannot be less than 0.5 v, because this is
about the amplitude of "feed-through" pulses of the biased amplifier.

Another consideration for keeping the Schmitt trigger sensitivity
large is to relax the bandwidth requirements of the biased-off amplifier.
The triangular-shaped character of the positive portion of the amplifier
pulse places a bandwidth burden on the biased-off amplifier for the
pulses which barely exceed the threshold level. The larger the pulse
required to actuate the Schmitt trigger, the greater the output required
from the biased amplifier, These larger pulses, because of their tri-
angular shape, will be wider at the base line and will require less
bandwidth from the amplifier.

The 2.5-v sensitivity of the Schmitt trigger results in PHD poten-
tiometer control that is ineffective below a pulse amplitude of 0.25 v.
This is only 5% of the 5-v full range and is considered to be only a
minor limitation. Trigger sensitivities in excess of 2.5 v would result
in even less usable portions of the PHD potentiometer and would not be
desirable,

Transistor Q7 of the biased amplifier must have a base-to-emitter
breakdown voltage greater than 5 v. The 22432 transistor designed for

inverted chopper applications has a 15-v Beno rating.

The pulse out of the Schmitt trigger is applied to emitter-follower
Q12. The magnitude of this pulse is +3.5 v, and its width depends on
the amount that the pulse amplifier pulse exceeds the bias setting (of
the PHD). The emitter-follower output drives the succeeding binary
stage and an external scaler. The recovery of the pulse at the emitter-
follower will be slow at the termination of each pulse if an untermi-
nated cable is used to make connection to a scaler, becsuse the charged
cable will hold Ql12 off and must be discharged through R47, a 6.2-
kilohm resistor.

Pump Driver

The pulse from the Schmitt trigger and its emitter-follower does
not have the proper amplitude or the width to drive the log and linear
pumps. A binary stage (also called a flip-flop) is used to further
shape the pulse. The output pulse of the flip-flop is rectangular,
having a width equal to the time elapsed between two successive pulses,
This method of shaping automatically provides the pump circuits with
wide pulses without any increase in dead-time losses. The consequent
division of the pulse rate by a factor of 2 must, of course, be con-
sidered in the pump design.

The flip-flop design composed of Ql3 and Ql4 is a saturated type
(i.e., the "on" transistor is driven into saturation) with resolution
capabilities of 107 counts/sec. When either Q13 or Ql4 is "on," the
other is "off." The positive pulse from the emitter-follower acts to
turn the "on" transistor off, and the regenerative nature of the circuit
then switches the state of the flip-flop. Diodes D2 and D6 serve to
steer or apply the pulse to the base of the "on" transistor. To under-
stand how the steering is achieved, assume Q13 to be "on" and Ql4 to be
 

129

"off." The collector of Q13 will be near +8.5 v, and the collector of
Ql4 will be near ground. Diodes D6 and D5 are in series and are back
biased by the difference in potential between the collector and base of
Ql4 (about 8.5 v). The base of Ql4 is clamped to a potential slightly
more positive than +8.5 v by D4. (The only purpose for D3 and D4 is to
limit the back bias applied to Q13 and Ql4 when they are turned off.
With these diodes the back bias can never exceed about 0.5 v.) In con-
trast, diodes D1 and D2, which are also in series, are only back biased
by a few tenths of a volt. Thus, a positive input pulse will take the
route through D2 (and to the base of the "on" transistor) in preference
to that through D6 because of the greater bias on Dé.

Diodes D1 and D5 aid in another manner. They help discharge ca-
pacitors C19 and C20, respectively, by providing a low-impedance path
to 021 (a 2.2-uf capacitor) through the collector of the "on" transistor
between input pulses. These capacitors will acquire some charge as the
input signal proceeds to turn off the "on" transistor and, if permitted
to accumulate or to not sufficiently recover, can cause a malfunction
of the flip-flop.

The collector swing of Ql3 and Ql4 is approximately 8 v. This
value is marginal to provide reliable operation of a pump circuit. Also,
the pump circuit input impedance is quite low and would drastically load
the flip-flop and impair its speed. Thus, some further amplification is
still required, and some impedance isolation is needed. It should be
recognized that any amplification process must also achieve high ampli-
tude stability to achieve good pump performance. Transistors Ql5, Q17,
and Q16, along with diodes D13, D14, D15, D16, and D17, are used to
perform this task. Diodes D13 and D14 are fast-recovery conventional
diodes, and diodes D15, D6, and D17 are 5.2-v Zener diodes. The role
of D7 will be explained below.

Amplification with controlled amplitude is accomplished by Q15,
the two fast diodes, and the three Zener diodes. The collector current
of Ql4 forward-biases diode D7 and turns Q15 off "hard." The collector
of Ql5 is caught at approximately —=17 v by the series string of the two
fast diodes and the three 5.2-v Zener diodes. When Ql4 is turned off,
D7 is released and Ql5 is turned on "hard" by the base drive through
R53. Thus, the collector swing of Ql5 is from —17 v to essentially O v.
The two diodes in series with the Zener diodes isolate the large capac~
itance of the Zener diodes from the collector of Ql5, permitting fast
rise and fall times. One diode is adequate for this isolation, but
two diodes give better temperature compensation for diode effects on
the diode pumps. The Zener diodes have a specified rating of 0,005%
per °C change, and the variation of the saturation voltage of Ql5 is
less than a few tenths of a millivolt per °C.

It should be apparent that the scheme just described is one where
the collector current of Ql4 is sampled, rather than its collector
voltage, so that amplification is not achieved in the usual sense. How-
ever, the method employed is one where no loading is placed on the flip-
flop, permitting it to operate at maximum speed.

Transistors Ql6é and QLl7 comprise a complementary emitter-follower
driving stage which applies the 17-v pulses to the pump circuits. The
necessity of a complementary design over that of a single emitter-fol-
lower can be explained 1f we momentarily include the pump circuits in

 
 

130

the discussion. The following section will discuss these in greater
detail. The negative-going step of the 17-v pulse proceeds to charge
the feed capacitors of the pump circuits (C26 through C30 for the log
pumps and C39 for the linear pump) through their respective diodes

(p18, D20, D22, D26, D28, and D32) to the full 17 v. On the positive-
going edge of the pulse (or the return to ground), these capacitors -
must now be discharged quickly to O v to be prepared for the next pulse.
This discharge path must proceed through the second diode of each pump
into the smoothing capacitor or output capacitor of each pump for proper
action of the pump. At this time Q17 is blased off and cannot provide
this discharge. Q17 is off, since its base is at or near ground, and
its emitter is at —17 v because the feed capacitor is behaving as a 17-v
battery. With Q16 in the circuit as the NPN complement, it will be
biased "on" and will permit the feed capacitor to discharge.

Pump Circuits

Logarithmic Pumps. — The log pump design is composed of six pumps
and is based on the earlier work of Cooke-Yarborough.”? The dc currents
from each pump are summed at the common junction of R88, R90, R92, R%,
R96, and R98 and are delivered to the summing junction of an external op-
erational amplifier. The composite response of six pumps is shown in
Fig. 2.3.12. Since the output voltage of each pump is positive, the
conventional current flow will be out of these resistors. An additional
current of opposite polarity is supplied through R113 and is adjustable
by the "calibrate" control potentiometer R112. The gain of the externsl
amplifier and hence the "span" of the log count rate meter are con-
trolled by the parallel cambination of R115 and R116. For trimming
purposes the value of R116 is adjusted. A 250-kilohm feedback resistor
for the operational amplifier, in addition to a l-kilohm resistor which
forms a voltage divider network with R115 and R116, is located at the
operational amplifier, If these resistors were located in the pulse
amplifier and count rate meter module and the module were unplugged,
it would open-circuit the feedback loop on the operational amplifier
and cause the operational amplifier to saturate. It is not advisable
to leave these amplifiers in this state for extended periods of time.

The operation of the pump circuit, discussed briefly in the pre-
ceding section, will be described in more detail here. As charge from
the feed capacitor is transferred to the smoothing capacitors C32 through
C37, a voltage is developed across these capacitors which causes the
current flow through any shunt resistance such as R88 and R87 of the
first pump. R88 is essentially returned to ground since it is tied to
the suming junction (a virtual ground) of the external operational
amplifier. At a steady count rate, there is an equilibrium condition
established where the rate of charge, or current inflow, is equal to
the current outflow, and a steady dc voltage (with superimposed statis-
tical variation) is established across each smoothing capacitor.

total shunt resistance across smoothing capacitor.

This response is shown graphically by any of the six curves in
Fig. 2.3.12. For small values of n, where nRC is small compared with
unity, the response is nearly linear as a function of n, the count rate.
As n becomes larger, the response becomes nonlinear (appearing to be
linear on a semilog plot) and ultimately reaches a saturation value of
Vs when nRC is much greater than unity. As the count rate increases,

each pump becomes successively saturated (pumps with the largest RC
product saturate first), resulting in a constant output current from
each pump.

The Cooke-Yarborough principle will show end effects when a limited
number of pumps are used to approximate the logarithmic response. To
compensate for this, the two end pumps deliver sbout 10% more current
than the four middle pumps. This is accomplished by making the value
of the feed resistors R88 and R98 smaller than that of the other four
feed resistors R90, R92, R9%, and R96. The values of the shunt re-
sistors R87, R89, R91, R93, R95, and R97 are adjusted to keep the pump
time constant RC at values which differ by a factor of 10.

The value of the total shunt resistance R across each smoothing
capacitor was made as small as possible, but still permitting reasonable
values of smoothing capacitors (i.e., values less than 100 uf). The
product of the resistance and the smoothing capacitor values determines
the statistical noise superimposed on the de current. The values shown
were determined by experiment on the complete wide-range counting chan-
nel, The first three time constants involving C32, R33, and C34 were
selected to keep the period noise at reasonable values while the wide-
range counting channel was behaving as a straight counting instrument.
The remaining three time constants were selected to optimize the speed
of response of the counting channel,

The leakage of the smoothing capacitors and diodes D19, D21, D23,
D25, D27, and D29 behaves as an additional shunt resistance across the
various pump outputs. The 1IN914A is specified to have a maximum leakage
of 0,025 pa at a reverse bias of 20 v at 20°C. This will have negligible
effect on the performance of the pumps. The electrolytic capacitors
C32, C33, and C34 were purchased with a specified leakage not to exceed
0.2 pa at 25°C at a working voltage of 20 v, which is equivalent to a
dc leakage resistance of 100 megohms. A reduction in leakage resistance
to 50 megohms would represent an error of 2.5% of reading over only a
small range of the scale. Also, errors caused by leakage of the capac~-
itors will not accumulate, because as each pump goes into saturation,
its output current is a function of only the pulse amplitude and the
magnitude of the resistor feeding the summing junction of the opera-
tional amplifier, In addition, any errors caused by the three electro-
lytic capacitors, since they apply to the pumps at the low end of the
scale, are negligible at the high end.

The other critical components of the various pumps, such as the
feed capacitor and output resistors, are high-quality, high-stability
+19% components, or better.

The effect of the variation of diode potentials in the pump is
equivalent to a variation of the amplitude of the input pulse. The
effect is such that, at higher temperatures, the input pulse appears
bigger and there is greater output from the pump. More clearly, as the
forward drop of D18 reduces with a temperature increase, the feed ca-
pacitor will charge to a larger voltage. Also, the forward drop across
D18 is less, and more charge is transferred. The two diodes D13 and
D14 in series with the three 5.2-v Zener diodes have a tendency to com-
pensate for this. As the temperature rises, the forward drop of these
two diodes will be less and will result in a reduced pulse amplitude.

Linear Pumps. — The linear pump circuit is designed to give a linear
output current signal up to a value of about 170 pa for 10% counts/sec.
This current is fed through R99, a 10-kilohm resistor, into the summing
junction of an external operational amplifier. This amounts to a voltage
of +1.7 v at the output of the pump.

Without any attempt (such as bootstrapping) to improve linearity,
the output signal would depart from linearity by nearly 9%. This can
be computed from the general count rate expression given in the preceding

counts/sec. The bootstrapping circuit consisting of Q18 and Q19 serves
to effectively increase the magnitude of the input pulse by an amount
equal to the output de voltage. Discounting the small drop in R117,
any change in the output voltage appears at the anode of D32 and is in
a direction to increase the voltage to which the feed capacitor is
charged with each input pulse. Thus, the output current without boot-
strapping is

(vy - ve
i = e—
1/n

This becomes

[(v, + v,) - v lc
 ————

1/n

which is independent of v_. Here all terms have the same meaning as in
the preceding section.

The cascaded emitter-follower arrangement (Darlington pair) is used
to raise the looking-in impedance of the bootstrapping circuit, thereby
reducing its loading effect on the output voltage. The voltage drop of
the base-to~-emitter voltages of QL8 and Q19 plus the drop across R117
is of sufficient magnitude to ensure that D31 is sufficiently back
biased during the charging time of the feed capacitor to avoid a leakage
of charge from the smoothing capacitor.

Temperature effects in the linear diode pump are due primarily to
changes in the two diodes D31 and D32. Variation in the forward volt-
ages of these two diodes is compensated for by changes in input pulse
amplitude in a manner described in the preceding section. Diode leak-
age currents and leakage in the electrolytic smoothing capacitors are
negligible, particularly since the value of the output resistor is only
10 kilohms. :

Temperature effects caused by the bootstrapping scheme are small,
but are not negligible. Vie changes of Ql8 and Q19 will have a signif-

icant effect on the output. These changes will predominantly show up
as a change in emitter potential of Q19 of sbout 4 mv/°C. Only slight

‘changes of Vie due to temperature are seen at the base of Ql8, because

the 10-kilohm base impedance of QL8 is so much smaller than the looking-
in impedance of Q18. The variations at the emitter of Q19 will change
the magnitude of the bootstrapping voltage with temperature. At 50°C
(assuming 4 mv/°C) the change in bootstrapping signal from the 30°C
value is 120 mv, which is a change in output signal of [0.120/(17 x
20)1100, or 0.03%/°C, where 17 v is the amplitude of the input pulse.
This change is in a direction to increase the output signal. If the
output signal from the bootstrapped configuration had been taken from
the emitter of Q19, the 0.03%/°C value will be increased by an addi-

 
 

134

tional [0.120/(1.7 x 20)]100, or 0.3%/°C, at 10* counts/sec. This oc- oO
curs because the pump output voltage (1.7 v at 10% counts/sec) receives

the full effect of the Vee changes.

The actual temperature drift observed on the pump operating at 10%
counts/sec is three times worse than 0.03%/°C. At 5000 counts/sec the
measured drift is more nearly 0,03%/°C. The cause of the increased
drift at the 10%-count/sec rate, which nearly amounts to an additional
2 mv/°C, is not definitely known.

I, and the base current of Q18 will flow through R99 into the

suming junction of the external amplifier and appear as signal currents.
I. effects will be negligible, because 0.001 pa is typical for Q18 and

Q19 (NPN silicon). Temperature effects on hen are also small, since the

base current of QL8 is about 0.5 pa, or about 0.3% of the full-scale out-
put (i.e., 170 pa at 10% counts/sec). The hp, value varies sbout 0.4%/°C
in the range 0 to 50°C.

Test Oscillators

10-count/sec Oscillator. — This is a Swiss-made (Zenith model
E59GJ) electromechanical oscillator with a spring balance wheel mounted
in ruby bearings. The spring balance wheel is driven by an electronic
circuit containing two transistors and two coils. The two coils are
fixed and are located coaxially above and below a permanent magnet set
in the rim of the balance wheel, The axis of the magnet is parallel to
the axis of rotation of the spring balance wheel. As the magnet passes o
through the region between the coils, a voltage induced in one coil
(the pickup coil) turns on a transistor amplifier which has the second
coil (the drive coil) as a collector load. The current in the drive
coil imparts a force to the balance wheel in a direction to sustain its
movement. The output pulse is taken from the collector of the amplifier
transistor. The other transistor is connected as an emitter-follower
and provides the necessary power amplification for the signal from the
pickup coil.

The oscillator produces an output pulse of the same polarity each
time the magnet passes under the coils. This results in two pulses for
each complete cycle. The time duration between successive pulses can
differ by as much as 3 msec; however, the sum of the two intervals re-
meins precisely at 0.1 sec (i.e., a 10-count/sec rate). The variation
in time duration arises because the spring on the balance wheel is
wound in one direction and is unwound in the other direction.

10%-count/sec Oscillator. — The 10%-count/sec oscillator is crystal-
controlled by a 10%-count/sec quartz crystal. The oscillator consists
of an Engineered Electronics Company. (EECO) plug-in unit T-107, re-
quiring a standard nine-pin miniature tube socket. The quartz crystal
(EECO type H145~31) 1s mounted separately. The T-107 unit contains
three transistors, two of which are used as a two-stage common emitter
amplifier with feedback from the second collector to the first base
through the impedance of the crystal. There is a full 360° phase shift,
and the circuit will oscillate at a frequency which experiences neither
phase shift nor appreciable attenuation through the crystal. The third
transistor serves as an emitter-follower output stage. oO

 
 

135

Oscillator Shaper. — Since the output waveforms of the 10- and the
10%*-count/sec oscillators are widely different, preshaping is required
if a uniform pulse is to be applied to the pulse amplifier. Q20 and
Q2l form a conventional Schmitt trigger for this purpose. Q21 is nor-
mally on and Q20 is off. The sensitivity is such that about 4 v is
needed for triggering. The output pulse from the collector of Q21 is a
positive pulse which is sharply differentiated by C38 and R86. The
resultant pulse is about 0.1 v in amplitude. A negative pulse of about
the same amplitude is obtained, but it is of the wrong polarity to
trigger the pulse~height discriminator.

2.3.5 0,1-hp Servo Amplifier, ORNL Model Q-2615

2.3.5.1 G@General

The O0.l-hp dc servo amplifier is a dc power amplifier that can
supply a maximum of 75 w power at voltage and current limits of 25 v
and 5 amp respectively.

2.3.5.2 Construction

The servo amplifier is constructed in a module 4.22 in. wide, 4.72
in. high, and 11.9 in. deep. It is a standard "three-unit" plug-in
module of the modular reactor instrumentation series depicted on drawings
Q=-2600-1 through Q-2600-5,

The four output transistors are mounted on separate heat sinks;
these are supported by four rods that connect the front and back plates
of the module. The four intermediate transistors of the amplifier are
mounted on smaller separate heat sinks; these are clustered on a metal
plate supported by the four tie rods.

The input transistor and most of the other components of the am-
plifier are mounted on a printed circuit board near the front panel of
the module.

The series limiting resistors for the output transistors are
mounted on the rear plate. All decoupling resistors and capacitors are
mounted on a metal plate supported by the four tie rods and located near
the rear of the module. This metal plate also shields the amplifier
from the heat that is dissipated in the limiting resistors.

2.3.5.3 Application

The servo amplifier drives a Globe Industries, Inc., type BD dc
motor with a 27-v armature. It can drive this motor under all con-
ditions from no load to blocked rotor. The motor is used as the servo
motor to position a fission chamber in a wide-range counting channel.

The O.l-hp dc servo amplifier is a de-coupled amplifier with feed-
back around two voltage-gain stages and two cascaded emitter-followers.
The emitter-follower stages are complementary NPN and PNP pairs to per-
mit the output to swing negative and positive with respect to ground.
The last emitter-follower stage is a parallel combination of two
transistors to increase its power handling capabilities,

Circuit Description

Reference is made to Instrumentation and Controls drawing Q-2615-1.
The input signal is applied to the base of Ql, a PNP silicon transistor.
A l-kilohm resistor R2 in series with the base limits the maximum load
placed on the input signal in the event of any failure in the servo
amplifier, Diode D2 limits the bhase-to-emitter voltage on Ql when large
negative input signals are applied under blocked rotor conditions,

Negative feedback is applied to the emitter of Ql through the re-
sistive network R3 and R8. The feedback ratio is R3/(R3 + R8), which
gives a closed-loop voltage gain of approximately 3.

The circuit shown produces a dc offset between input and output.
With no input, the voltages will be as shown (+2.4 v on the output and
0 v on the input). For the output to be at a zero potential, the base
of the input transistor must be at a negative 0.8 v to keep Ql in a

conducting state.

 
 

 

137 .

Voltage gain in the loop is obtained from Ql and Q2. Q3 is a cur-
rent source which functions as a high-impedance collector load for Q2
while still providing adequate current to drive the emitter-follower
stages under all design conditions. When the servo amplifier is driving
positive with respect to ground, part of the collector current of Q3 is
diverted into the base of Q5. When the servo amplifier is driving neg-
ative with respect to ground, all the Q3 collector current flows through
Q2, and Q2 must be capable of handling this current plus the required
drive current into the base of Q4.

Transistor Q4 and transistors Q6 and Q8 in parallel function as an
emitter-follower chain; they operate when the servo amplifier is driving
negative with respect to ground. Transistor Q5 and transistors Q7 and
Q9 in parallel operate when the servo amplifier is driving positive with
respect to ground. The transistor not operating is held in a back
biased state by the base-to-emitter voltage of its complement.

Diode D1 in the emitter of Q2 permits Q2 to be turned off "hard"
when the amplifier is delivering its full positive output. Any small
collector current could create a large dissipation in Q2, since Q2
will have in excess of 60 v from collector to emitter.

Capacitor Cl, connected from the base to the collector of Q2, along
with the collector impedance of Ql, shapes the open-loop response to im=
prove the high-frequency stability. The total capacitance at the col-
lector of Ql is increased in magnitude by the Miller effect. This re-
sults in a smaller value of capacitance for the same shaping of the
open-loop response. This internal time constant, coupled with the
compensating effect of C2 across R8, stabilizes the amplifier over its
entire range of operation with as much as 0.22 pf capacitance in shunt
with the output.

The behavior of the amplifier with a step input signal is different
with positive and negative input signals. With a negative input step,
Ql and QR are immediately driven into a higher conducting state, and the
output rise time is exponential in character and is controlled primarily
by the value of C2. With a positive step, Ql and Q2 are both immediately
turned off in the absence of a return signal from the feedback network.
Thus, the current from Q3 flows into Cl, generating a ramp until there
is sufficient signal from the feedback network to return Ql to a con-
ducting state and thereby restore the closed loop. Under these con=-
ditions the output wave shape will have a ramp-type leading edge.

~ Resistors R9 and R12 in the emitter of Q6 and Q8 tend to balance
the current contribution of each transistor, even with large differences
in transistor parameters, such as current gain and transconductance.
Resistors R10 and R13 are used for the same purpose with transistors
Q7 and Q9. o

Resistor Rll, which is a series combination of three l-ohm resistors,
protects transistors Q6 and Q8 under severe load conditions. With a
blocked rotor condition the Globe Industries type BD motor will behave
as a.3-ohm load, and the maximum dissipation possible in either parallel
transistor is ebout 27 w. This is assuming supply voltages of +36 v.
These potentials are possible when the batteries that normally power
this module are fully charged. Resistor R14 provides similar protection
for transistors Q7 and Q9.

 
 

138

The collectors of Q4 and Q5 are connected to resistors Rll and Rl4 OU
respectively. This prevents damage to these transistors under overload
conditions,

2.3.6 Vernistat

2.3.6.1 General

The Vernistat adjustable function generator is composed of two
separate, but integral, units: a function adjusting assembly and an
interpolating Vernistat potentiometer. A function is set up simply by
manually adjusting the positions of sliders on the function adjusting
assembly panel. The panel is marked off in rectangular coordinates,
with percent output as the ordinate and shaft position as the abscissa.
The sliders provide a visual plot of the function that is set into the
function generator. By rotation of the shaft of the interpolating
Vernistat with an excitation voltage applied, the output voltage curve
conforms to a series of straight-line interpolations between voltages
set up by the slider. Clockwise rotation scans the function from left
to right (i.e., from slider 1 to slider 34).

2.3.6.2 Construction

Vernistat Function Adjusting Assembly

The function adjusting assembly is approximately 1 by 7 by 8 in.
and contains (1) a 10l-tap voltage divider; (2) a 34-pole, 1OL-position w
printed-circuit switch; and (3) a function adjusting panel.
The voltage divider has a total of 101 equally spaced taps. These
taps divide the input voltage into 100 equal voltage increments.
The 34-pole, 10l-position switch is a rectangular coordinate array.
A printed-circuit grid consists of 101 parallel lines connected sequen-
tially to the voltage-divider taps. Each of the 34 sliding contacts can
be moved independently across the grid lines so that each slider may
contact any of the 101 voltage divider taps. The voltage divider taps
are spaced at 1% increments, and therefore any voltage may be selected
to within *0,5%.
A panel, marked off in rectangular coordinates, mounts directly
over the printed circuit switch so that the 34 sliders protrude through
slots in the panel and can be manually adjusted. The Y axis is pro-
portional to voltage, and the X axis is proportional to the position of
the interpolating Vernistat shaft. The X axis represents a range of
approximately 11 shaft turns.

Interpolating Vernistat Potentiometer

The interpolating Vernistat consists of (1) a series of commutator
bars which correspond to the sliders of the function adjusting assembly,
(2) a switching mechanism, and (3) a 360° toroidal resistance element
precisely tapped at 120° intervals. Connection of the function adjusting
assembly to the commutator bars of the interpolating Vernistat is made
through a multiconductor cable. This cable is an integral part of the
 

139

interpolating Vernistat and plugs into the function adjusting assembly.
This is the only connection made to the function adjusting assembly.

Rotation of the shaft of the interpolating Vernistat switches the
taps of the interpolating resistance element one at a time along the
commutator and simultaneously controls the potentiometer output wiper.
There are approximately three interpolations per shaft turn of the
interpolating Vernistat.

2.3.6.3 Application

The Vernistat adjustable function generator provides a convenient
means of generating mathematical and empirical nonlinear functions.

The function generator is used in the wide-range counting instru-
ment to modify a linear position signal so that it is equal to the
logarithm of the neutron attenuation.

2.3.6.6 Theory of Operation

Figure 2.3.13 shows the electrical relation of the Vernistat in-
terpolator commutator bars, interpolating resistance element, and out-
put wiper. By synchronization of the switching of the interpolating
resistance element taps along the commutator bars with the movement of
the potentiometer wiper arm, the voltage output becomes a series of

 
 

140

linear voltage interpolations between adjacent commutator bars. The
interpolating resistance element, used repetitively for each shaft
turn, is a 360° toroidal potentiometer precisely tapped at 120° intervals.

Switching of resistance element taps from one commutator bar to
the next only requires about 30° of shaft rotation, whereas a complete
interpolation requires approximately 120°. Therefore, the switching
process of the interpolating resistance element is a noncritical oper-
ation. No discontinuities of output occur, since in each instance as
the output wiper approaches a new commutator bar, the next interpolating
resistance element section is already in position. Switching of the
taps of the interpolating resistance element along the commutator bars
is accomplished with a planetary gear reduction.

The output wiper is so synchronized with the switching operation
that it is always on an energized section of the resistance element.
This results in continuous, smooth interpolation throughout the output
voltage range.

The heart of the switching mechanism is a planetary gear reduction
that consists of three elements: an internal tooth gear with as many
teeth as there are commutator bars, a planetary gear with one tooth
less, and an eccentric on the shaft which keeps the two gears in mesh.
These gears are shown schematically by the eccentric circles in Fig.
2.3.13. Because of the one-tooth difference, one shaft rotation results
in a counterrotation of the planetary gear, which is equivalent to the
angular spacing between commutator bars.

The resistance element is mounted on the planetary gear and rotates
with it at a reduced speed. The commutator wipers, connected to the
resistance element taps, are also mounted on the planetary gear. The
output wiper is attached to the Vernistat shaft. Because the resistance
element rotates, the output wiper moves from one tap to the next in less
than 120° of the shaft rotation.

The 34 sliders of the function adjusting assembly equal the number
of commutator bars in the interpolating Vernistat. Eleven shaft turns
(3960°) are required to generate an entire 34-chord function. Each
chord represents 116.47° (3960°/34) of shaft rotation.

Sliders 34 and 1 are adjacent electrically; therefore, a repetitive
function may be generated by continuous rotation of the input shaft.

2.3.7 Dual DC Amplifier

2.3.7.1 General

The ORNL model Q-2605-1 dual dc amplifier is designed and manu-
factured by Electronic Associates, Inc., as the EAT model 6.720. The
unit consists of two independent high-gain amplifier circuits packaged
on an etched-circuit board. The amplifiers are transistorized and de-
signed for optimum stability and frequency response. Each amplifier can
be used in conjunction with appropriate networks to perform linear com-
putations such as summation, integration, and multiplication by a con-
stant.

2.3.7.3 Amplifier Balancing

The amplifiers should be periodically balanced to assure accuracy.
Under normal circumstances, the amplifier will remain balanced for
periods of weeks. However, at intervals it is desirable to check this
condition, and if an amplifier is found to be unbalanced, then an ad-
Justment should be made. The period between balance checks depends to
a large extent on the application of the amplifier. For uses which
might be unusually sensitive to amplifier unbalance or integrator drift,
the amplifier should be balanced at more frequent intervals. In any
case, maintenance personnel should recognize the fact that many amplifier
and network malfunctions can be detected by checking amplifier balance.
Consequently, it is recommended that a check of amplifier balance be
made biweekly. If the check indicates that the amplifier balance is
within tolerance, no adjustment need be made.

2.3.7.4 Theory of Operation

Basic Block Diagram

The dual dc amplifier consists of an EAI model 6.715 dual dc ampli-
fier card housed in a special package. The components for one channel
are shown in Fig. 2.3.14. The major components consist of the stabi-
lizer amplifier, the chopper, and the dc amplifier. The circuit is ar-
ranged so that the drift-free characteristics of an ac amplifier are
used to maintain constant de amplifier balance by providing a voltage
to the input of the de amplifier which tends to maintain the summing
Junction at virtual ground, The resulting circuit has excellent long-
term stability and allows the use of a wide-bandwidth dc amplifier
without the necessity of frequent manual balancing.

Inputs to the amplifier are applied through an external input im-
pedance Zin The dc and low-frequency components of the signal voltage

at the suming junction (87) cannot pass directly to the input of the
dc amplifier section because of Cl. Instead, they are connected through
R3 to contact 9 of chopper Dl. A chopper, or synchronous vibrator, con-

 
 

142

sists of a coil-driven vibrating reed 8 (Fig. 2.3.14) that alternates
between contacts 9 and 7 on each half cycle of the coil excitation volt-
age. The chopper alternately grounds contact 9, producing a 60-cps
square-wave input to the stabilizer amplifier. After amplification, the
resulting signal is demodulated (or synchronously rectified) at the
second contact 7 of the chopper. The resulting signal at contact 7 is
a pulsating dc signal whose polarity is the same as the polarity of the
signal at the summing junction. The dc signal is filtered by R8 and C2
and applied through R7 to the input of the dc amplifier section. Thus
de and very low-frequency signals are amplified by the stabilizer am-
plifier and by the de amplifier.

The circuit from contact 9 of D1 to contact 7 is a modulated
carrier-type amplifier that provides high-gain de amplification with
no drift. The stabilizer is phase-sensitive; if the polarity of the
suming junction signal changes, the phase of the modulated signal
changes and the polarity of the pulsating dc output voltage changes.

High-frequency components of the input signal are passed through
Cl to the dc amplifier and are amplified by the gain of the dc amplifier
only. The open-loop gain of the amplifier thus depends on the frequency
of the input signal. At very low frequencies the gain is extremely high
because the stabilizer amplifier is placed in series with the dec am-
plifier. At higher frequencies the gain is decreased but remains high
enough to satisfy all expected operations when the feedback loop is
closed.

Any component of the amplifier output voltage due to drift in the
dc amplifier section is fed back through the feedback impedance Zp to

the suming junction of the amplifier. Since any drift-produced voltage
has a very low frequency, it will be amplified by the stabilizer section,
filtered, and then applied as a drift-correction signal to the input of
the de amplifier section. The drift-produced component in the output is
reduced by a factor equal to the effective gain of the stabilizer sec-
tion. The amplifier would require balancing every few minutes without
stabilization. The drift compensation produced by chopper stabilization
allows the amplifier to be used for weeks without attention.

The amplifier in the stabilizer section has a very high gain. Since
it is connected to the summing junction, it serves as a monitor of the
summing junction voltage. Under normal circumstances the input current
of the operational amplifier is equal to the feedback current, and the
suming junction is at virtual ground. If the currents are not equal,
the amplifier is not performing properly, and the summing junction de-
parts from virtual ground. This rise in voltage is amplified by the
stabilizer and results in an output signal which msy be connected through
the appropriate push-button switch to the balance monitoring meter cir-

cuit.

DC Amplifier Section

Refer to Fig. 2.3.15 for the following description. The summing
junction of the operational amplifier is connected to the input ter-
minal. The ac components of the input signal are applied to the base
of transistor Ql through R2 and Cl. The input signal is also connected
through R3 to the input of the stebilizer section. Two reverse-connected
 

143

diodes CR1 and CR2 are connected from the input to ground so that Cl
cannot be charged to a high voltage should an overload occur. This
feature allows the amplifier to recover rapidly following an overload
condition. The voltage at this point is normally less than the diode
conduction point.

Transistors Ql and Q2 comprise the amplifier input stage. Tran-
sistor Q2 is connected in a common-emitter configuration, with R7 (in
etched-circuit resistor network NWl) and thermistor R15 providing self-
bias. Transistor QL is used in the emitter-follower configuration and
uses the voltage drop (approximately 0.3 v) across the base-emitter
diode of Q2 as its operating voltage. The emitter-base resistance of
Q2 provides a load for Ql. This configuration gives the amplifier a
relatively high input impedance. The base circuit of Ql is completed
through R8 (in NW1), Rl, and the balance potentiometer. These compo-
nents form a voltage divider between —15, +15, and +25 v., The balance
potentiometer sets the optimum operating point for Ql, as indicated by
a zero output from the stabilizer section.

The high-frequency rolloff of the input stage is controlled by C3
and R5.

Temperature compensation is provided by thermistor RL5 and resistor
R6, which tend to keep the collector of Q2 at a constant potential re-
gardless of temperature variations. The stabilizer output is connected
through R8 and R7 to the input of Ql.

The output of Q2 is coupled to the base of Q3 through NWi-R5. Bias
for Q3 is provided by NWl-R4 and NW1l-R5. The feedback network consisting
of R10 and C5 provides the proper high-frequency rolloff for the Q3
stage.
Capacitor C4 provides correct phasing for higher frequencies. The
collector load for Q3 consists of resistors NW1l-R3 and NWl-Rl.

Resistor NW1l-R3 provides direct coupling from the output of Q3 to
the base of Q4, as well as forming a voltage divider with NW1-Rl to set
the operating point for Q4. The Q4 stage is connected in the common-
emitter configuration. The emitter is connected to +15 rather than
ground, to establish the correct operating points for Q4, Q5, Q6, and
Q7. The collector load for the stage consists of NWl-R2. Capacitor
C7 provides high-frequency degenerative feedback for this stage, and
the network consisting of C6 and Rll controls the high-frequency rolloff
for Q4 and Q5.

The collector of Q4 is connected to the base of Q5 through an in-
candescent lamp DSL. The filament of this lamp has a high positive
temperature coefficient of resistance, providing an increase in resist-
ance with an increase in current flow. This stabilizes the operation
of Q5 by limiting base drive. The Q5 stage is connected as an emitter-
follower, with resistor R12 providing the emitter load resistor. Diode
CR3 provides a small forward bias for output transistor Q7, eliminating
crossover distortion in the output stage.

The output stage consists of transistors Q6 and Q7, connected in a
complementary-symmetry configuration. This circuit arrangement provides
the advantages of push-pull operation with a single-ended input. Both
transistors are connected as emitter-followers. Since transistor Q6
(PNP) conducts with a negative input and transistor Q7 (NPN) conducts
with a positive input, one of the transistors delivers current to the

 
 

144

load regardless of input polarity. With a zero input, both transistors
conduct equally, and the voltage drop across the load is zero. Incan-
descent lamps DS2 and DS3 perform a function similar to that of DSl;

by providing an increase in resistance with an increase in current,
they protect the output transistors from excessive current flow. Re-
sistor R13 provides a dc feedback to the base of Q4 which tends to keep
the output of the amplifier at zero volts with a zero input and compen-
sates for minor transistor and temperature variations.

Stabilizer Section

The stabilizer section consists of a four-stage direct-coupled
amplifier (Q8, Q9, Q10, and Qll), input and output coupling capacitors
(c8 and C12 respectively), and a 60-cps chopper (D1). The stabilizer
preamplifies the dc and very low-frequency components of the signal
appearing at the amplifier summing junction and applies the resulting
signal as an input to the dc amplifier section.

Stabilizer Amplifier. — The stabilizer amplifier receives its input
from the summing junction through resistors R3 and R9. The chopper
grounds the junction of R3 and R9 60 times each second, making the input
appear as a series of pulses between ground and the input level. These
pulses are coupled through C8 to the base of transistor Q8.

The input stage of the stabilizer consists of transistors Q8 and
Q9. Transistor Q8 is connected as an emitter-follower and uses the
base-emitter voltage drop of Q9 to provide operating voltage. The cir-
cuit arrangement of Q8 and Q9 is similar to the arrangement of Ql and
Q2 in the dc amplifier section and provides a relatively high input
impedance. Resistors NW2-Rl and NW2-Rll provide bias for Q8. Capacitor
C9 filters high-frequency transients from the input waveform. Resistor
NW2-R2 provides the emitter load for Q8 and, together with NW2-R12, pro-
vides bias for Q9. Transistors Q9, Q1l0, and Ql1l are connected in the
common-emitter configuration and are directly coupled through resistors
NW2-R4 and NW2-R6. Capacitor ClO provides high-frequency degeneration
for the Q11 stage, removing unwanted high-frequency components from the
output waveform. Resistor NW2-R8 provides a feedback to the junction
of NW2-R1l and NW2-R1l, adjusting the bias on Q8 to maintain the stabi-
lizer amplifier transistors at the correct operating point. The net-
work consisting of R14 and Cll provides phase correction for very low
frequencies and filters high frequencies from the NW2-R8 feedback loop.

The stabilizer amplifier consists of an emitter-follower input
stage which is noninverting and three common-emitter stages which pro-
vide an overall phase shift of 540°, This constitutes an apparent 180°
phase shift, or an inversion from input to output. This cannot be
tolerated by the overall amplifier, since the dc amplifier section pro-
vides a 180° phase shift. Any feedback under these conditions would be
regenerative, and the amplifier would not be usable. For this reason
contacts 7 end 8 of the chopper demodulate the output of the stabilizer
amplifier to provide a pulsed output to the filter network (RS and C2)
having the same polarity as the input. This is accomplished as described
below.

Chopper. — The chopper used in the EAT model 6.720 amplifier is a
specially designed high-speed relay. It consists of a double-pole

 
 

145

armature assembly which is driven by a 60-cps ac source and which al-
ternates in position from one set of contacts to the other at this rate.
Figure 2.3.14 shows how one pole of the chopper (pin 8) alternately
grounds the stabilizer input (pin 9) and the stabilizer output (pin 7).
The closing of contacts 8 and 9 at a 60-cycle rate causes the stabilizer
input to appear as a series of pulses, This permits amplification of
very low frequencies or dc levels while isolating the amplifier operating
levels through the use of a coupling capacitor. The closing of contacts
8 and 7 effectively shifts the phase of the output by providing a short
r-c charge or discharge time for C12 when closed and a longer time
(through R8) when open. This operation is more easily understood with
the use of examples,

If the input to the summing junction tends to go positive, the in-
put to the stabilizer amplifier consists of a series of positive pulses.
The output waveform at the collector of Qll then consists of a series
of negative-going pulses. However, during the time that the input pulse
is present (positive), the output (negative) at the junction of C12 and
R8 is connected to ground through contacts 7 and 8 of the chopper. This
allows Cl2 to charge rapidly to the level at the collector of Qll. The
chopper arm then closes to contact 9, driving the stabilizer input to
ground.

The collector of Ql1 goes from its negative level toward ground
at this time, and the positive change is coupled through C12 and R8 to
the input of the dc amplifier. The de restoring action of contact 7
and the arm of the chopper thus makes the apparent output a series of
positive pulses which are filtered by C2 and R8 and provide a dec input
to the dc amplifier through R7.

If the input to the summing junction tends to go negative, the
stabilizer input is a series of negative pulses. The output at the
collector of Qll is a series of pulses from a negative level toward
ground. In this case, the chopper provides a short-time-constant dis-
charge path for Cl2 when the collector of Qll is close to ground. As
contacts 8 and 9 of the chopper break and contacts 8 and 7 close, the
collector of Qll goes negative and the change is coupled through C12
and R8 to filter capacitor C2.

Stabilizer Filter. — The stabilizer output filter, consisting of
capacitor C2 and resistor R8, has a time constant of 3 sec. This is
extremely long with respect to the stabilizer output waveform, conse-
quently reducing the ripple at the junction of R8 and R7 to a negligible
level.

‘Stabilizer Functions. — The stabilizer performs the apparently dual
functions of preamplifying dc and very low-frequency input signals and
maintaining the amplifier summing junction at a point very close to
ground potential over wide variations in amplifier balance. When the
amplifier feedback loop is closed (as it must be) and no input is ap-
plied, the amplifier output should be zero volts. Any departure of the
amplifier output from this point is coupled through the feedback resis-
tor to the summing junction. This causes the stabilizer to generate a
correction voltage which returns the amplifier output and, consequently,
the summing junction to zero. If an input signal is applied to the
summing junction, the stabilizer again generates a voltage. In this
case, however, the output of the dc amplifier is shifted from ground

potential to produce an output with a polarity opposite to that of the
input and a magnitude equal to the input voltage multiplied by the ratio
of the feedback resistance to the input resistance. This output pro-
duces a potential at the summing junction equal in magnitude and opposite
in polarity to the input signal, returning the absolute potential at the
suming junction to a point very close to ground. It is in this way that
the stabilizer attempts to keep the suming junction at ground regard-
less of input voltage changes or variations within the de amplifier,

2.3.8 Fission Chamber Drive

2.3.8.1 Description

The fission chamber drive, ORNL model Q-2545, is shown in Figs.
2.3.16 and 2.3.17. This unit contains a direct-current motor and as-
sociated drive train for positioning the preamplifier and fission cham-
ber assembly. In addition, there is a position-sensing train for pro-
viding position signals to the servo power amplifier and to the data
logger.

Performance specifications are:

Stroke 20 in,
Chamber velocity 72 in./min
Environment 150°F in water containing 2000 ppm

sodium nitrite corrosion inhibitor

A ball-bearing lead screw turning at 288 rpm provides the rota-
tional-to~linear motion conversion with an efficiency rating of ap-
proximately 90%. A water-resistant calcium-complex-base grease was
selected as the lubricant for the lead screw. The ball-bearing nut is
attached to a guide block which rides on nylon runners between two
aluminum guide rails mounted within a 3-3/4-in.-OD stainless steel drive
tube.

A thrust tube connected to the guide block is attached to a cabling
rig which is connected to the preamplifier and fission chamber assembly.
The fission chamber signal cable, sheathed in Tygon tubing for water
protection, and a piece of music wire are coiled into a helix. These
are held together with nylon spiral wrapping to form a spring-loaded
coiled cord. This helix provides the necessary cable takeup and is
coiled loosely around the thrust tube between the cabling rig and the
lover end of the drive tube. This cabling rig rides on nylon rollers
inside the 4-in.-ID instrument penetration tube. (This tube is not a
part of the positioner assembly.)

The direct-current drive motor with integral gear reducer and
tachometer is protected from any torque overloads by a disk-type slip
clutch. The position signal system is directly connected to the lead-
screw shaft ahead of the slip clutch by a pair of precision gears.

The position signal system consists of a ten-turn auxiliary posi-
tion-sensing potentiometer driven by a 48:1 ratio reducer, to provide
7-1/2 revolutions for 90 in. of chamber travel. This, in turn, drives

o
 

147

a 10:1 ratio reducer which is connected to a one-turn position-sensing,
data~-logger input potentiometer. On the same shaft there is a synchro
transmitter for driving a position indicator on the console.

A ten-turn Vernistat interpolating potentiometer, previously de-
scribed, is gear-driven from the shaft of the ten-turn auxiliary position-
sensing potentiometer to provide ten revolutions for 90 in. of chamber
travel. This interpolating potentiometer provides the position feed-
back signal to the function generator amplifier (ORNL model Q-2616).

Upper and lower limit switches are actuated by rods which are
tripped by the guide block at each end of its travel. These rods are
held captive in grooves between the guide rails and the drive tube.
This permits mounting of the limit switches in the motor drive assembly
where they are readily accessible,

2.4 LINEAR POWER CHANNELS

2.4.1 Description

These linear power channels (Fig. 2.4.1) comprise the instruments
used for the most accurate determination of reactor power and for input
to the rod control servo system. These compensated ion chambers and
associated power supplies, ORNL models Q-1045 and Q-995, respectively,
were removed from the HRT and reconditioned for use in the MSRE. The
design of the chamber, testing and compensation procedures, and its
high-current saturation characteristics have been described in two
ORNL documents, 12? applicable portions of which are included later in
this section. The MSRE chambers, unlike the illustration in ref. 1,
are equipped with motor-driven remote compensation adjustment and do
not use a continuous flow of nitrogen.

The Q=-995 power supply is a conventional regulated supply designed
to provide the requisite positive and negative voltages to the two sec-
tions of the chamber. The negative voltage adjustment is used to assist
compensation in accordance with ref. 1. For the circuit diagram see
Tig. 2.4.2.

The picoammeter is a Keithley Instruments, Inc., model 418-20
(Sect. 2.4.3). It has an overall range from 10732 to 1072 amp, ac-
complished by range switching. Range switching is described in Sect.
2.6; it may be done locally at the instrument or remotely at the con-
sole, Detailed specifications and performance characteristics, ab-
stracted from the manufacturer's instruction manual, are given in Sect.
2.4.3. Figure 2.4.1 shows only one channel of linear input instru-
mentation. For a more complete diagram the reader is referred to Sect.
2.6.

Either of the two channels may be used to supply input to the
linear recorder on the main control board and to the regulating rod
controller. The output channel not being recorded is read out on a
console-mounted meter. The strip-chart recorder is a two-pen, self-
balancing potentiometer type arranged in a somewhat unorthodox fashion
in order to record both the output voltage of the picoammeter and the
range switch setting unambiguously.

This simultaneous record of picoammeter output and range setting
is unambiguous because the range setting uses the left-hand 40% of the
chart width and the picoammeter output is restricted to the remaining
60%. Therefore the chart traces do not overlap or cross over at any
time, and there can be no question as to trace identification after the
paper roll is removed. The above is illustrated by Fig. 2.4.3, the
chart paper used for this power recorder.

2.4.2 Visual Readout Device, Series 360

A visual readout device, mounted above the linear power recorder
and legible to personnel in both the control room and the visitors!
area, displays the range setting multiplier so that the reactor power
can be read at a distance by simply noting the position of the indi-
cating flag on the right-hand pen of the linear power recorder. This

readout device (Fig. 2.4.4) consists of an assembly of optical pro-
jection modules which display selected characters (numbers, letters,
symbols, etc.) on a translucent screen located flush to the main board.
In the MSRE the projection lamps in the modules are selected by the
range selector switches on the console.

2.4.4 Procedure for Field Testing and Compensating
Compensated Chamber Q-1045>

2+4.4.1 Description

The compensated chamber (Fig. 2.4.5) really consists of two cham-
bers, one of them boron-coated. The output current is the sum of the
currents of the individual chambers; since the high-voltage electrodes
of these individual chambers are at potentials opposite in sign (one is
+600 v; the other, —300 v), the output current will be the difference
of the two chamber currents. The current from the boron-lined chamber
is proportional to the neutron flux and to the gamms flux, while the
uncoated chamber responds to gammas only. By making the gamma responses
equal, the output current is proportional to neutron flux alone, even
in the presence of a high gamma flux.

It would not do to make the coated and uncoated chambers identical;
they would then have to be placed in the same location in the reactor.
What is done is to build them very close together and then make one
adjustable to accomodate differences in gamma flux at the two chamber
locations. The process of finding the best adjustment is known as
compensating the chamber. It must be done in the reactor at the exact
location where the chamber is to be used. The reactor itself is used
as a source of gamma radiation.

2.4.4.2 Testing

Insulation Tests

The purpose of these tests is to determine whether the leakage
current of the chamber is negligible compared with the operating cur-
rent. To do this, one applies a high direct voltage to the high-voltage
electrodes and observes the leakage current with a sensitive device.

Two high-voltage supplies are needed: +1000 v and +500 v. They need
not be well regulated, but they must be well filtered and have a low
noise and hum output. It is desirable to operate them from a sine-wave
Sola constant-voltage transformer. Connect the +1000 v to the positive
high-voltage receptacle on the chamber; the +500 to the negative high-
voltage. Connect the output to a current-measuring device capable of

indicating a current of 1071? amp, This may be an electrometer; often
it is convenient to use the log N amplifier, calibrated as per Q-915-6.
The ground (or low) side of the log N or electrometer must be connected
to the ground side of the high-voltage supplies, since the receptacle
shells are not connected to the chamber. This may be done with a clip
lead, but in view of the high voltage involved, a wire properly secured
to a screw is safer. A leakage current greater than 1 X 1012 amp is
excessive, and the chamber must be disassembled and cleaned by someone
experienced in this job. Do not attempt this in the field.

Compensation

1. The preferred method of compensation consists in varying pile
power level and comparing the output of the chamber to be compensated
with the pile level as read on another instrument, usually the fission
chamber. The pile is run at a high level for half an hour or more (to
build up gammas); the flux is then changed as quickly as possible to a
lower level. The procedure is trial and error; increase the high-to-
low flux ratio as the compensation gets nearer and nearer the correct
value. The reference instrument will give the ratio of the two flux
levels; compare this with the ratio as measured on the test chamber.

If the ratio from the test chamber is too low, the chamber is under-
compensated, and the compensation must be increased. If the ratio from
the test chamber is too high, the chamber is overcompensated, and the
compensation must be decreased.

2. The compensation may be varied by screwing in or out the com-
pensating adjustment on the chamber and by varying the negative potential
on the compensating electrode. Changing the adjustment of the chamber
varies the relative volume of the uncoated chamber; this is how the
compensation is usually changed. The adjusting screw is turned clock=-
wise to decrease the compensation of an overcompensated chamber; turning
it counterclockwise increases the compensation. When the adjustment is
nearly correct, turning the adjusting screw 30° will change the (nega-
tive) gamma current by about 1%. The effect of this change on the total
current will, of course, depend on how large the gamma current is with
respect to the neutron current, and this will in turn depend on how
large the gamma flux is compared with the neutron flux. Changes in
negative potential on the high-voltage electrode of the uncoated cham-
ber may also be used to adjust the compensation. Decreasing the voltage
decreases the compensation; increasing the voltage (more negative volts)
increases the compensation. The magnitude of the change in compensation
depends on the gamma current and on the position of the negative high-
voltage electrode, which is moved by turning the compensating adjustment.
The effect of a 30-v change may be equivalent to as little as 1/20 turn
change in the compensating adjustment, or to as much as 1/2 turn,

At never installations, means are provided for turning the compen-
sating adjustment remotely, so that it is not necessary to dismantle
lead cables, shield plugs, and the like, Compensation of chambers so
installed is far better carried out using the compensating adjustment
exclusively, with negative high voltage set at its maximum value, since
the uncoated chamber has better saturation characteristics at higher
voltages, Where chambers are installed without means of remote ad-
Justment, it will, in some cases at least, require considerable time

o
 

167

and effort to meke each change in the compensating adjustment. One may,
if access is difficult or time short, aim at slight overcompensation
with full negative high voltage and then decrease the voltage as a final

adjustment. It is especially necessary in this case to guard against
leaving the chamber slightly overcompensated (see No. 6 below). A
principal reason for avoiding this method lies in the variable effect
of the voltage adjustment — it is quite possible that compensation can-
not be achieved at any reasonable voltage and that the chamber adjust-
ment will have to be turned again.

DO NOT adjust a compensated chamber to operate with the negative
high voltage less than =50 v.

3. The choice of flux level at which to perform this experiment
is not easy, in some cases. Usually the only instrument one can believe
as a reference is the fission chamber, because only that device permits
rejecting all signals due to gammas. One must use flux levels such that
the low level gives a sufficient counting rate to permit good statistics
in a reasonable time and the high level gives a counting rate less than
10,000 counts/sec, at which rate the error due to resolving time in the
A-1 amplifier starts to be important.

4. One must take care that the control rod positions are as
nearly alike as possible for the two flux levels; variations may cause
"shading" effects which impair the validity of the experiment.

5. In reactors where the y-n contribution to the shutdown flux is
negligible, the compensation may be checked, at least approximately, by
leaving the log N recorder chart running during any shutdown of 6 hr or
more. The flux will decrease on a period which approaches the 80-sec
half-life of the longest-lived delayed neutrons. If, at some point,
the flux deviates from this 80-sec-period straight line, and this is
not explained by lattice or experiment changes or something similar,
then one can usually assume the chamber compensation is incorrect.
Upward deviation (toward a constant level instead of a constant period)
indicates undercompensation; downward deviation indicates overcompen-
sation.

6. It is best in the period channel to err on the side of under=-
compensation. Overcompensating the chamber will result in a negative
output current; as the current passes through zero during startup the
period circuits will scram the reactor. Prolonged negative current
will induce "sleeping sickness” in the 9004 diode in the log N.

7. It is not a foregone conclusion that every compensated chamber
can be exactly compensated in every reactor. In cases where the cham-
ber cannot be compensated with the adjustment available, the dimensions
of the cups will have to be changed. This is not a job for the field;
the ORNL Instrument Department Counter Laboratory should be consulted.

2.4.5 The Use of a Colloidal Dispersion
of Boron in Oil to Obtain a Uniform
and Easily Applied Coating of Boron

(This specification supersedes ORNL drawing Q-1045-11)

The process of applying a boron coating to graphite,’ as developed
at ORNL, is to quickly heat the boron-painted graphite electrode in an
inert atmosphere to a temperature sufficient to drive off the oil car-
rier. The following specific steps are used here to obtain a known
thickness of boron coating.

1. Heat to a dull red color by means of an induction furnace, the
graphite electrode which is to be costed, to drive out some of the
collected gases and surface contamination. A flow of nitrogen®
over the piece during heating and cooling prevents oxidation.

2. Weigh graphite electrode.

3. Apply the dispersion of boron in oil with brush to the graphite
electrode, A thick coat, but not sloppy, on fine-grained graphite
results in a final coating thickness of approximately 0.8 mg/cm?

4. Weigh the painted graphite electrode; 20% X weight of applied dis-
persion + cm? of painted surface = desired coating thickness (20%

by weight of the dispersion is boron). The desired coating thickness
for a single-plate chamber is 0.8 mg/cm? (£0.4 mg/cm? =~ 90% current).

The desired coating thickness for a 4-plate chamber is 0.5 mg/cm?;
the desired coating thickness for a l6-plate chamber is 0.3 mg/cm? .

5. Under a strong flow of nitrogen, heat the painted graphite electrode

to a temperature at which no more oil is being driven off (dull red
heat) and allow to cool quickly. It is important that the nitrogen®

flow carry away the oil vapors quickly and that the flow is continued
until the coated graphite electrode has cooled to near 100°C. Boron

oxidizes quickly at temperatures above 200°C.

6. The coated electrode may be weighed again to check the thickness of
coating. It is expected that some amount of the graphite will be
lost by oxidation.

2.4.6 High Current Saturation
Characteristics of the ORNL Compensated
Ionization Chamber (Q-1045)7

The saturation voltage and current characteristics of the ORNL
compensated ionization chamber (Q-1045) have been measured with special

regard to high voltage and current ranges. The chamber was sealed in
an enclosure containing dry nitrogen at 15 to 20 psia.

The chamber was secured at a position in the grid plate of the
Bulk Shielding Reactor such that the sensitive volume was approximately
15 in. from the reactor core face on the horizontal center line of the
reactor. This position was chosen so that the chamber current at full
power would be of the order of 1 ma with only a small gamma background
error (5%) at a reactor power three decades lover.

The chamber was connected as shown in Pig. 2.4.6. The output of
the regulated high-voltage power supplies was measured with a D'Arsonval
microammeter (1/2% F.S. accuracy) with 1% precision resistors in series.
High currents (1075 amp and up) were measured with a D'Arsonval micro-
ammeter and lower currents with a Leeds and Northrup micromicroammeter
(model 98364).

The reactor was held at power levels between 1 kw and 1 Mw, and
the chamber voltage was varied in 200-v increments. The data are shown
in Fig. 2.4.7. The actual reactor power was 4% lower than the indicated
power at 100 kw and 10% low at 1 Mw due to the decreased neutron at-
tenuation in the shielding caused by decreased water density at higher
temperatures.

It can be seen from the curves in Fig. 2.4.7 that the neutron-
sensitive volume is well saturated for currents less than 100 pa at any
voltage above 600 v. For high accuracy the chamber should therefore be
operated only at currents of 100 pa and helow with the standard power
supply Q-995. The saturation voltage for 800 pa is approximately 2000
v. The inaccuracy at 400 pa at 600 v is about 20%. Since the chamber
can easily withstand high potentials, there is no reason why it cannot
be operated at 1 ma with a suitable power supply.

Thanks are due K. M. Henry and the staff at the Bulk Shielding
Facility for their help in making the measurements.

The IEE Series 360 readout meets human engineering require-
ments for distance viewing by displaying characters up to 2” in
height. The unit operates on a rear-projection principle. When
one or more of the 12 lamps at the rear of the unit is lighted,
it illuminates the corresponding film message, focuses it
through a lens system, and projects it onto the viewing screen
at the front of the unit.

2.5 ROD SCRAM SAFETY SYSTEM

2.5.1 Rod Scram Safety Channel — Input Instrumentation

The control rods are scrammed by excessively high flux, short reac-
tor period, and excessively high reactor outlet temperature. The safety
system employs three independent channels for inputs to the safety sys-
tem logic and requires that any two out of three indicate unsafe con-
ditions in terms of either flux, period, outlet temperature, or circuit
integrity to produce a scram. Teble 2.6.1 in Sect. 2.6 lists control
rod actions and the conditions which produce them.

A typical channel of neutron flux input instrumentation is diagrammed
in Fig. 2.5.1. It consists of a neutron-sensitive ion chamber, a period
safety module, a flux amplifier? and ion chamber high-voltage supply, a
test module, and fast-trip comparators. ? The outputs from the period
safety module and the flux amplifier are the reactor period and power
level signals which become the inputs to the fast-trip comparators.

Flux amplifier sensitivity is adjusted by changing the size of a feed-
back resistor. In the MSRE the flux level trip point has two settings,
depending on whether or not fuel salt is being pumped around the loop.
Current relays in the fuel salt pump motor three-phase supply are used
to determine whether the pump is circulating salt or idling in helium.
These relays provide the signals used to actuate switching relays which
change the value of the flux amplifier feedback resistance by a factor
of 1000 and thereby provide rod scram trip points of 15 kw or 15 Mw.
Figure 2.5.2 diagrams the circuitry which shifts flux level trip point,
and Fig. 2.5.3 is a block or signal flow diagram of this circuitry. The
fast-trip comparator is a fast-acting electronic relay with sufficient
power-handling capacity to operate small relays and similar logic and
control devices external to the instrument. It also contains two small,
fast-acting electromechanical pilot relays which have greater power-
handling capacity with somewhat reduced response time. The "on-off"
outputs of the pilot relays in the comparators are the primary input
signals to the safety system logic and to the control system. Detailed
descriptions of these instruments are given in Sects. 2.5.3 to 2.5.8.

The temperature input signal instruments are block diagrammed in
Fig. 2.5.4. The measuring thermocouples (refer to Sect. 6.7) are com-
posed of two individual thermocouple wires, Chromel and Alumel, welded
adjacently but separately to the fuel salt outlet piping, thus forming
a grounded junction. Each thermocouple wire is contained in an individual
Inconel sheath and is insulated from this sheath by magnesium oxide. This
construction, using individual, separated wires for each leg of the
thermocouple, is used in preference to a dual thermocouple assembly (both
wires in a single sheath), so that if a thermocouple breaks or becomes

detached from the pipe, an open circuit is created. An open-circuited
thermocouple causes the emf-to-current converter to indicate a failure
toward safety, that is, upscale.

Thermocouple emf (in the 25-mv region) is amplified by a Foxboro
Company type 693 emf-to-current converter which provides an output cur-
rent, linear with input emf, of from 10 to 50 ma into an impedance of
from 600 to 150 ohms for the selected input range of the thermocouple,
in this case 0 to 1500°F. The type 693 converter uses magnetic amplifiers
to obtain voltage and power amplification, contains no moving parts, and
employs solid-state diodes where required in the circuitry.

The 10- to 50-ma output from the type 693 converter is the input
signal to the high-temperature trip switch. This switch, a Foxboro model
63 alarm, compares a set-point voltage with a voltage developed by the
input current from the type 693 converter and actuates an alarm relay
when the input signal voltage is greater? than the set-point voltage. A
contact on the alarm relay, closed during normal reactor operation, pro-
vides the high-temperature input signal to one channel of the rod scram
safety system, as will be pointed out subsequently.

The emf-to-current converter also supplies a signal, the voltage
drop across the 400-ohm resistor, to an isolation amplifier. This ampli-
fier provides a barrier between the safety system instruments and the
remaining nonsafety instruments which make up an input channel. The
isolation amplifier transmits the input signal in the forward direction
to the remaining current-actuated switches but decouples the safety
instruments in the reverse direction. This virtually eliminates the
possibility that the effects of malfunctions or misoperation, calibrations,
etc., of the nonsafety instruments will be transmitted in the reverse
direction to the safety system.

The isolation amplifier is a Foxboro Company N111LF magnetic ampli-
fier designed specifically to amplify the output of Foxboro type 630
pressure transducers and to be compatible with the other Foxboro compo-
nents in Fig. 2.5.4. The amplifier has an input of 0.2 to 4.0 ma into
10,000 ohms impedance and an output of 10 to 50 ma into 600 ohms load.

The remaining two current-actuated switches in Fig. 2.5.4, whose
outputs are labeled "Alarm" and "Control Rod Reverse," are Foxboro dual
type 63 alarms, both in a single case.

The meter is a Foxboro model M65PV-OHT. This is a D'Arsonval cur-
rent meter designed to operate over an input from 10 to 50 ma dc.

2.5.2 Rod Scram Safety Channel — Output Instrumentation

The output section of a typical safety channel (channel A) is
diagrammed in Fig. 2.5.5. From the left side of the figure, it can be
seen that the four trip relay contacts in the input instruments are in
series and are maintained closed during normal reactor operation. These
contacts are located as follows:

 

3In other applications an alarm may be produced when the input
signal is less than set-point voltage. This mode of operation (low
alarm) is accomplished by a simple wiring change.

4. reactor period trip (tv £ +1.0 sec) in a Q-2609 fast-trip comparator.

A fifth set of normally closed contacts formed by a manual "Test" button
is also included, followed by a seal contact in parallel with a "Reset"
push button. During normal reactor operation relays K,1 to K,5 are

energized. These relays, push buttons, and associated indicating lamps
make up the ORNL model Q-2623 relay safety element, which provides the
contact multiplication needed to produce the safety actions required.

The contacts of relays K,1 to K,3 are interconnected with similar con-

tacts from corresponding relays in channels B and C to produce three
two-out-of-three coincidence matrices in the power circuits to the rod
drive clutches. A typical matrix appears on the right-hand side of Fig.
2.5.5. Relay Ky provides one of the control rod "Reverse" signals and

the "Seal" contact, and relay K,5 is used to open the drain tank vent

valves and close the radiator doors (load scram). Figure 2.5.6 shows a
block diagram and the additional circuits which operate the vent valves,
radiator door, etc.

Each rod drive clutch (see Sect. 2.7) receives its power through
its corresponding contact matrix, and it can be seen that a loss of clutch
current (rod scram) requires that relays in at least two safety channels
be deenergized. This permits testing of individual channels during
operation without disturbing the reactor and also allows the disabling of
any one channel for maintenance. Each leg in the two-out-of-three matrix
shown in Fig. 2.5.5 contains a 100-ohm resistor and a current meter in
series with a pair of relay contacts. These meters function as input
channel monitors, as can be seen from the following example. Assume that
channel A is being tested during operation. This may be done with either
the test routine built into the Q-2634 test module (see Sect. 2.5.6) in
channel A or, by using the thermocouple test assembly .* A less complete
test is initiated by pushing the "Test" button in the Q-2623 relay safety
element shown in Fig. 2.5.5. In any case, relays K,1 to K,5 will be

deenergized and thereby produce open circuits in two of the three branch
circuits in each of the Q-2623 coincidence matrix monitors. From Fig.
2.5.5, it can be seen that the meters labeled "A and C" and "A and B"
will change to show zero current. The total clutch current will now be
carried by the third leg in the matrix, and meter "B and C" will change
upscale to reflect this change. The 100-ohm resistors are required to

ensure equal current division among the three legs in the matrix. With-
out these resistors very small differences in relay contact resistance
would produce large inequalities in the currents normally carried by the
three meters. This resistor is sized so that its resistance must be at
least an order of magnitude larger than any anticipated value of total
relay contact resistance in series with it. Also, it must not be so
large that it reduces clutch current to the "Scram" point when it assumes
the total current load of the clutch, as it must, when one channel is in
"Scram" mode. Tests on the prototype rod drive show that a typical
clutch will transmit 39 in.-1b torque at 22.6 v, whereas the scram torque
produced by the weight of the rod and unbalanced drive mechanism compo-
nents is approximately 12 in.-1lb. Thus, it can be seen that there is
ample margin to prevent undesirable scrams during testing or in the event
that a single channel be tripped as by removal for maintenance or mal-
funetion.

The 32-v Zener diode across the clutch coil prevents high peak re-
verse voltages that would otherwise take place when the clutch coil cur-
rent is interrupted.

2.5.4 Period Safety Module,® ORNL Model Q-2635
2.5.4.1 Description

General

The input, or current-sensing element (logarithmic diode), of the
period safety module (see Fig. 2.5.10) is connected in series with the
flux amplifier input. The voltage across the logarithmic diode is
differentially amplified with a very high input impedance amplifier so
that the chamber current passes undisturbed into the flux amplifier
module. This voltage is further amplified and differentiated to give
outputs proportional to the logarithm of the current and its period

Manual, pp. 4-9, written by E. N. Fray, Instrumentation and Controls

(time required for the current to increase by one e¢ factor) respectively.
The input current range is from 10~'0 to 10~4 amp. In the usual appli-
cation the period output serves as an input to a nuclear reactor safety
system; hence the name "period safety."

Construction

The period safety module is 1.40 in. wide, 4.72 in. high, and 11.90
in. deep. It is a standard "one-unit" plug-in module of the ORNL modular
reactor instrumentation series depicted on ORNL drawings Q-2600-1 to
Q-2600-5.

The circuits are on a printed circuit board which is completely en-
closed by a shield. The outputs are displayed on front-panel meters.
Test points and access holes to trimming potentiometers are located
along the top of the shield enclosure.

Application

The period safety module is primarily intended to continuously
monitor the neutron flux and period of a nuclear reactor. Since the
module is not intended to measure reactor power accurately, the panel
meter on the output of the logarithmic amplifier is calibrated in "log
current” from 10~20 to 10% amp. The output of the period amplifier is
displayed on a panel meter which is calibrated in seconds from —-30 to +1.

The voltage drop across this "log" diode is approximately

The diode voltage is

applied to a very low leakage differential amplifier, whose output is
further amplified with a second differential amplifier to give the "log

current” output.

The "log current" output is differentiated with an

operational amplifier to generate the "period" output.
It is required that the leakage of the input difference amplifier

be small compared with the flux amplifier input leakage.

This leakage

current must come from the ionization chamber current, and if the leak-
age current is excessive, the current amplified by the flux amplifier

will be in error.

Circuit Description

The input current flowing through the thermionic diode V1 develops
a voltage across the diode that is essentially logarithmic over the cur-

rent range of 10710 to 10% amp.

This voltage is applied to a difference

amplifier which uses insulated-gate field-effect transistors (FET's) as

active elements (Ql).

The gate leakage current of the FET's is extremely

small, so that essentially all the signal current flows through the diode

and then into the flux amplifier.

not adequate to furnish this protection because of their high leakage

resistors R7, R8, and R9, furnishes the bias current for the difference

smplifier and appears as a large source load impedance to improve the
common-mode rejection ratio. The gain of the difference amplifier is
approximately 2.5. Its output is applied to a Fairchild type ADO-3
differential amplifier whose gain is adjustable from 2.67 to 4 by the
trimming potentiometer R11 ("Io Cal"). The particular gain required is
determined by the characteristics of log diode V1, and it is adjusted
to give approximately 1.67 v/decade at the output of the "log current”
amplifier. Trimming potentiometer R18 ("Hi Cal") is required for proper
scale adjustment of meter Ml.

The "log current" output is differentiated by an additional ADO-3
amplifier whose gain (product of C4 and R25) is such that a 1-v output
corresponds to a l-sec period.

Two significant smoothing time constants are associated with the
"period" amplifier. They are determined by the product of R20 and C4
and R25 with C5, and each is approximately 100 msec.

2.5.4.3 Operating Instructions

Installation

The period safety module is a module in the ORNL modular reactor
instrumentation series. Like the other modules in this series, it has
standard connectors and dimensions and has a pin-and-hole code on the
rear plate so that the module will not be inserted in a wrong location
in a drawer. The module is installed by placing it in its proper lo-
cation, inserting the module firmly, and tightening the thumbscrew. The
module may be plugged in with power on without damage.

Operating Controls

Log Current Panel Meter. — The log current panel meter is calibrated
to indicate current from 10-1° to 10~% amp. This represents a voltage
swing of —10 v; however, the output voltage measured with respect to
ground at a particular current will vary from unit to unit. This is de-
termined by the "Hi Cal" setting, which adjusts for variations of input
diode characteristics.

Period Panel Meter. — The period panel meter is calibrated to in-
dicate reactor period from —30 to +1 sec. This is a voltage range from
-0.033 to +1.0 v. The meter is mechanically zeroed to give an "«" in-
dication with no voltage applied.

Zero Adjustment. — "Bal 1" is for zeroing the output of the insulated-
gate difference amplifier Ql with TPl and TP2 shorted together. "Bal 2"
is for zeroing the output of the "log current" amplifier with TP3 and
TP4 shorted to ground. "Bal 3" is for zeroing the output of the "period"
amplifier any time when the input is not changing.

Test Points. — The test points are located at the top of the front
side of the shielding enclosure. These are used primarily when zeroing
or balancing the instrument, as described sbove.

 

 

 

Connections

All connections are made through the rear connector P29 when the
module is inserted.
 

185

Operating Procedures

 

The balance of the insulated-gate difference amplifier, log current
amplifier, and the period amplifier should be checked periodically for
drift. If correction is required, the following procedure should be
followed:

1. Place a jumper between TP1 and TP2 and measure the voltage between
TP3 and TP4 with a Triplett meter (or equal). Adjust "Bal 1" until
the voltage is zero.

2. Place the jumper across TP3 and TP4 and TP6 (ground). Adjust
"Bal 2" until the voltage between TP5 and TP6 is zero.

3. The period amplifier may be zeroed at any time the input is not
changing by adjusting "Bal 3" until the front-panel meter indicates
"wo" or until the output is zero.

2.5.5 Flux Amplifier and Ion Chamber High-Voltage
Supply, ORNL Model Q-26027

2.5.5.1 Description

General

The flux amplifier (Fig. 2.5.11) is a low-level dc amplifier that
amplifies current in the range of 10710 to 10™% amp from an ionization
chamber. The current from the ionization chamber is proportional to
reactor neutron flux in the usual application; hence the name "flux
amplifier.”

An ion chamber high-voltage supply, a dec-to-dc converter, is con-
tained in the same module with the flux amplifier to provide +250 v to
polarize the ion chamber. The two sections are electrically independent.

Construction

The ion chamber high-voltage supply and the flux amplifier are in a
single module 2.83 in. wide, 4.72 in. high, and 11.90 in. deep — a
standard "two-unit" plug-in module of the modular reactor instrumentation
series depicted on ORNL drawings Q-2600-1 to Q-2600-5,

The circuits are on two printed circuit boards mounted side by side.
The output is displayed on a front-panel meter. A balance meter, mounted
in the top front of the module, is visible when the module is plugged in
and the drawer is withdrawn. Near the meter is a "zero" push button and
a trimming potentiometer for balancing the flux amplifier.

Application

The ion chamber high-voltage supply and flux amplifier are intended

this end the panel meter is calibrated in percent power from O to 200%.
However, the amplifier may be used, with or without the ion chamber
high-voltage supply, wherever it is desired to measure current in the
range 10~8 to 107% amp full scale.

The amplifier has two internal feedback resistors and provisions
for connecting an external feedback resistor to establish any desired
scale calibration vs current within the capability of the instrument.

A flux reset mechanism Q-2603, a companion unit, can be used with
the flux amplifier to continuously adjust the feedback factor or gain
over a 3 to 1 range. The flux reset mechanism is a small instrument
servo that adjusts the feedback ratio of the flux amplifier so as to
force the flux amplifier output to agree with another signal, typically
computed heat power.

2.5.5.2 Theory of Operation

General

The ion chamber high-voltage supply and flux amplifier consist of a
steble, direct-coupled low-leakage amplifier and a self-contained high-
voltage supply for ionization chamber polarization. The chamber voltage
supply consists of a series preregulator, to regulate the battery input
voltage, and an unregulated dc-to-dc converter.

Circuit Description of the Ion Chamber High-Voltage Supply

The power supply is designed to operate from a nominal 32-v station

- battery with a terminal voltage variation from 28 to 36 v de. This wide
variation makes necessary a voltage preregulator consisting of transistors
Q9, Q10, Ql1, and Q12.

 
 

188

The preregulator output voltage is sensed by resistors R24 and R26
and applied to the base of amplifier stage Qll. A reference voltage
(16.8 v) generated by Zener diode string D4, D5, and D6 is applied to the
emitter of Qll. The amplified difference appears at the collector of Ql1
and is applied to driver Q10 and pass transistor Q12. A constant col-
lector current is provided for Qll by transistor Q9, Zener diode D3, and
the associated network. The preregulator output (test point TPl) is
filtered by C3, C4, and R27 and is applied to the de-to-dec converter.

Q13, Qi4, Tl, and the associated circuitry comprise a free-running
square-wave oscillator; D7, D8, and D9 assure that the circuit will be
both self-protecting and self-starting. Capacitors C6 and C7 round the
edges of the square wave somewhat to avoid the generation of sharp, high-
frequency spikes which may be coupled to other circuits.

A square wave of approximately 250 v peak-to-peak smplitude and
frequency of approximately 8 kc appears on winding 1-3 of transformer
Tl. This voltage is rectified by diode bridge D10-D13 and is filtered
by a pi-section RC filter composed of C8, C9, and R32. The output is
approximately 250 v dec with less than 50 mv of 8- or 16-kc ripple.

The output voltage vs load current is shown in Fig. 2.5.12. When
the output is short-circuited, the circuit continues to oscillate at a
very low amplitude and supplies about 1 ma of current. The circuit will
recover undamaged upon removal of the short circuit or overload.

Circuit Description of the Flux Amplifier

The flux amplifier converts & low-level current from an ionization
chamber to a usable voltage. The current range is determined by feed-
back resistor R33, which may be paralleled by R10 or an external re-
sistor. The input current is converted to a full-scale voltage of 10 v
at the output of the amplifier.

The amplifier is an operational type with a high open-loop gain and
a high open-loop impedance (Fig. 2.5.13). Only a small leakage current
flows in the input of the amplifier; therefore, all the signal current
flows through feedback resistor Ree The voltage produced at the output
is

Eg (v) = IR. ’

where I, is the signal current in amperes and Re is the resistance in
ohms.

The sensitivity of the flux amplifier can be adjusted by flux reset
mechanism Q-2603. Instead of feedback resistor Ry being connected di-
rectly to the output as shown in Fig. 2.5.13, it is connected through a
voltage-dividing network to the output as shown in Fig. 2.5.14. Poten-
tiometer R6 is motor driven to adjust the output voltage (with constant
input current) until the flux amplifier output agrees with an independent
signal as might be derived from a heat-power computer. The output volt-

age is then
R6 + R7
Fo = I; ne (oe yy ):

where O is the potentiometer setting as indicated in Fig. 2.5.14.
 

189

The flux amplifier is composed of eight silicon transistors and a
silicon diode. Input device Ql is a field-effect transistor which has
low gate-leakage current. In the specified range of input current, the
field-effect transistor is a satisfactory electrical replacement for an
electrometer tube and is far more rugged.

Some unusual characteristics of the field-effect transistor are
used advantageously in this particular amplifier. The field-effect
transistor drain-voltage drift with temperature is a function of the
drain current. When the drain current is larger than approximately 30
pa, the temperature coefficient is positive. When the drain current is
less than approximately 30 pa, the temperature coefficient is negative.
The field-effect transistor is biased at approximately 45 pa so that its
net current drift will be in a positive direction to cancel out drifts
of opposite direction due to the remaining transistors and diodes. The
voltage gain from gate to draln of the field-effect stage is about 20.

The remaining transistors are operated in standard configurations.
Transistor Q2, an emitter follower with near unity voltage gain, imped-
ance matches field-effect transistor Ql to the following gain stage.

Q3 and Q4 comprise a differential high-voltage-gain stage. The gain
from the base of Q3 to the collector of Q4 is about 500.

Transistors Q5, Q6, Q7, and Q8 are complementary emitter-follower
power-gain stages with unity voltage gain. The function of these four
transistors is to allow the output to swing plus and minus 10 v and
deliver up to about 30 ma of current to the load.

2.5.5.3 Operating Instructions
Installation

The chamber high-voltage supply and flux amplifier is a module in
the ORNL modular reactor instrumentation series. Like the other modules
in this series, it has standard connectors and dimensions and has a pin-
and-hole code on the rear plate so that the module will not be inserted
in a wrong location in a drawer. The module is installed by placing it
in its proper location, inserting the module firmly, and tightening the
thumbscrew. The module may be plugged in with power on without damage.

Operating Controls

Panel Meter. — The panel meter is calibrated to indicate power from
0 to 200%; this corresponds to a voltage output of 0 to —=10 v. If the
amplifier is to be used with a“ negative input current, the meter leads
should be reversed.

Balance Meter. — A sero-center balance meter on the top of “the
module is visible with the module inserted and the drawer pulled out.
The meter is used with the push button and zero adjustment located at
the edge of the printed circuit board nearby to correct for drift
periodically.

Zero Adjustment. — The zero adjustment is used to balance the de
amplifier to correct for drift.

Zero Push Button. — This push-button switch short-circuits the in-
put of the amplifier so that it may be balanced even when signal current
is present.

 
 

190

Connections

All connections are made through the rear connector PO when the
module is inserted. A jumper between pins 2 and 3 of PO is provided so
that if the module is removed from a drawer a warning signal is given.

Operating Procedures

The balance of the flux amplifier should be checked periodically by
depressing zero push button S1 and observing balance meter M2. If the
meter reads anywhere on scale less than plus or minus full scale when
the push button is depressed, the balance is satisfactory. With the
push button released the meter should read upscale the same amount as
the front-panel meter reading. If adjustment is necessary, turn zero-
adjustment potentiometer R3 clockwise to move the indicator in a positive
direction or counterclockwise to move the indicator in a negative di-
rection.

There are no adjustments on the chamber high-voltage supply.

Precautions

Since the output of the high-voltage supply can be lethal, care
should be taken not to place fingers in the rear portion of this module.

External connections to the ionization chamber should be made with
the power off or the module unplugged to avoid possible damage to field-
effect transistor Ql.

2.5.5.4 Maintenance Instructions

General

This module is designed to operate continuously with a minimum of
maintenance and adjustment. Zero adjustment and voltage test points
are accessible from the top of the drawer with the module inserted and
the circuits energized.

Periodic Maintenance

The amplifier balance should be checked (see Operating Procedures,
above) once every three or four weeks.

The high-voltage output should be checked every three or four
months by measuring with a voltmeter at the test points. The white
point on the module is ground test point TP3; the red point is the high-
voltage output test point TP2; and the gray point is the preregulator
output test point TPl. The voltages at the test points should read
(with respect to TP3); TPl, +25 + 1 v; and TP2, +250 = 25 v.

Calibration Procedures

There are no calibration procedures.

2.5.6 MSRE Test Module, ORNL Model Q-26348
2.5.6.1 Description

General

The MSRE test module (Fig. 2.5.15) is a special-purpose unit designed
to supply calibration signals for testing the response of parts of the
safety system of the MSRE. The module provides two calibrated current
ramps at different rates to check the response and approximate calibration
of the flux amplifier and associated fast-trip comparators. An adjustable
steady-state current can be substituted for the ramps for more precise
calibration. In addition, the module provides two steady-state currents
for calibration of the "log current" portion of the period safety module
and two voltage ramps for calibration of the "period" portion of the
period safety module and associated fast-trip comparator. An ion chamber
undervoltage monitoring circuit is provided in this module. All these
are initiated by push buttons from the module front panel.

Construction

The module is 2.83 in. wide, 4.72 in. high, and 11.90 in. deep. It
is a standard "two-unit" plug-in module of the ORNL modular reactor in-
strumentation series depicted on drawings Q-2600-1 to Q-2600-5.

The circuitry is constructed on two large printed circuit boards
mounted within the module.

Application

The module is intended to supply signals for both preoperational
and on-line testing of the nuclear safety system of the MSRE. Although
the signal types and circuitry used are generally applicable to any re-
actor safety system employing the ORNL modular reactor instrumentation
series, the signal levels and rates for this module are tailored es-
pecially for the MSRE.

Specifications

Output Ramps. — The basic ramp generator supplies a voltage ramp
of O to +14 with a rate of +1 v/sec. This ramp voltage is applied to
suitable multiplier resistors to obtain the required current ramp. The
output currents are: high rate (300 kilohms), O to 46.7 x 10™° amp; and
low rate (300 megohms), O to 46.7 x 10™° amp.

Output Currents, Steady State. — The output currents are adjustable
with a ten-turn precision potentiometer on the front panel calibrated to
be direct reading from O to 100. The output currents are: high current
(200 kilohms), O to 100 x 10~% amp; and low current (200 megohms), O to
100 x 10~°9 amp.

log Current, Steady State. — Two calibration currents are derived
from the ion chamber high-voltage supply by suitable multiplier resistors

192

for current calibration of the period safety module. They are: high
(25 megohms), 10° amp; and low (250,000 megohms), 10~° amp.

Period Calibration. — The +1-v/sec ramp is applied to the log cur-
rent amplifier in the period safety module through a suitable input re-
sistor. This produces a constant output at the period amplifier for
calibration purposes. Two approximate calibration points are provided:
+1 sec period (500 kilohms) and +2 sec period (1 megohm).

Undervoltage Monitor. — The circuit continuously monitors the
polarizing voltage of the ionization chamber on a return lead from the
chamber. When the chamber voltage is greater then 200 * 10 v, a green
light labeled "Normel" on the front panel is lit. When the chamber
voltage for any reason drops below 200 * 10 v, the circuit changes state
and lights both a red "Low" indicator lamp and a yellow "latch" indicator
lamp. When the voltage is restored, the "Low" indicator is extinguished,
and the "Normal" light again comes on. The "Latch" light remains on
until the front-panel "Reset" push button is depressed. The relsy that
actuates the indicator lemps has additional contacts (single pole, double
throw) for use in external circuits. An additional front-panel push
button labeled "Test" simulates a low-voltage condition to the monitor
circuit without affecting actual chamber voltage.

Power Requirements. — The module requires +32 * 4 v unregulated and
+25 v £ 0.1% regulated.

Ambient Temperature Range. — The ambient temperature range is 10 to
55°C.

2.5.6.2 Theory of Operation

General

The MSRE test module is a special-purpose module designed to pro-
vide signals to test parts of the nuclear safety system of the MSRE.
 

193

Although it was originally intended to have a general-purpose test
module which would be applicable to several reactors, and such a module
Q-2601 was designed, it soon developed that a single test module would
not suffice because of the different instrument sensitivities and varied
functions of the several reactor systems under design. Consequently, a
separate test module was designed for each reactor that uses this type
of instrumentation. In spite of the unique project application of the
module and because of the general applicability of the circuits used in
the module, a "Q" number was assigned to the MSRE test module for the
convenience of designers of future systems.

Circuit Description

Ramp Generator. — A linear voltage ramp is generated by charging a
capacitor with a constant current. In circuit diagram Q-2634-1, it is
seen that the base of transistor Ql is held at a constant potential with
respect to the +25-v supply by Zener diode D1. This in turn causes the
emitter voltage of Ql to be constant across a fixed resistor R2, estab-
lishing constent emitter current. To a first approximation, transistor
collector current is equal to emitter current, regardless of collector
voltage, until saturation is reached, that is, until the collector volt-
age equals the emitter voltage. Thus, the collector current of Ql is
constant and flows into capacitor Cl.

In the standby condition, the capacitor is short-circuited by con-
tacts of relays Kl and K2 and by contacts of push buttons S7 and SS.
When any one of these contacts opens, the capacitor begins to charge.
The rate of change of voltage across the capacitor is determined by the
magnitude of the current and the size of the capacitor. In this case

y_1
tc
-6
20 X 1077 amp _ v/sec .
20 x 107% r

The voltage across Cl is sensed by a very high beta Darlington-pair
emitter follower Q2 and Q3. The maximum amplitude of the ramp is limited
by saturation of Ql and Zener diode D1 to about 15 v across Cl or 14 v
at the emitter of Q3.

Current Switching. — The MSRE test module is designed to provide
test currents for both the flux amplifier and the period safety module.
Since the input of the flux amplifier is in series with the log diode of
the period safety module, any test current will be sensed and indicated
by both instruments. Since the flux amplifier has 100% feedback to the
input terminal, there is no input voltage offset. This means that a
relatively low-voltage current source is adequate for generation of its
test currents. For application to the period safety, a better current
source is required, since the voltage across the log diode is not con-
stant but changes with input current. To this end the calibration cur-
rents for the period safety are produced by using the chamber high-voltage
supply and suitable multiplier resistors. The "Rate" test currents and
the "Adjustable" test currents are intended for use with the flux ampli-
fier only; further, application of either of these currents causes the

 
 

194

period safety to indicate an incorrect current, which should be ignored.

Since all test currents are applied by way of a second ionization
chamber signal lead, which is separate all the way to the chamber plates,
a test signal must travel to the chamber and back to the safety channel
input. In this way a successful current test verifies that the chamber
is connected.

Flux Amplifier. — For steady-state calibration or checks, a voltage
adjustable from O to 20 v by a front-panel Helipot may be applied through
either a 200-kilohm or a 200-megohm resistor to the amplifier input by
energizing relay K4 or K3 respectively. The corresponding currents are
0 to 100 pa and O to 100 na. The Helipot dial labeled "Current Adjust"
is read directly from O to 100 units.

The voltage ramp described above may be applied through a 300-kilohm
or a 300-megohm resistor by energizing relsy Kl or K2, respectively, re-
sulting in current ramps ranging from O to 46.7 pa and O to 46.7 na. The
ramp is initiated by a second contact of Kl or K2, which removes the
short circuit from capacitor Cl.

Period Safety. — Fixed calibration currents for the period safety
module are generated by applying the chamber high voltage (approximately
250 v) through either a 25- or a 250,000-megohm resistor, resulting in
currents of 107° or 10~° amp. These currents are initiated by energizing
relays K5 and K6 respectively.

To check the calibration of the period amplifier, the voltage ramp
is applied to the input (terminal 6) of the log current amplifier. Sub-
sequent differentiation in the period amplifier results in a constant-
voltage output (constant indicated period) whose magnitude is determined
by the generated ramp rate and the gain of the log current amplifier.

Two calibration points are provided by applying the voltage ramp through
either a 500-kilohm or a l-megohm resistor; the result is a period in-
dication of about 1 and 2 sec respectively. Actually, the l-sec period
test should always generate a period slightly less than 1 sec, so that
the 1l-sec fast-trip comparator will trip. These tests are initiated by
depressing push buttons S7 or S8 to generate the 1- or 2-sec period.

Chamber Voltage Monitor. — In a manner similar to the signal lead,
a separate high-voltage lead is returned from the plates of the ioniza-
tion chamber. This voltage is continuously monitored by a circuit con-
sisting of transistors Q4 through Q8. If the voltage, normally 250 v,
is interrupted or reduced below approximately 200 v, an undervoltage
alarm occurs.

The sensed voltage is reduced from 250 to 100 v at R5 by two Zener
diodes, D2 and D3. The voltage is further reduced to 20 v at the base
of Q4 by the dividing action of R5 and R6. The emitter of Q4 is biased
at 10 v, so that the transistor is reverse biased and not conducting
under normal conditions. Since the collector of Q4 is near ground po-
tential, the Darlington emitter follower Q5 and Q6 and the relay drivers
Q7 and Q8, driven by the emitter-follower output, are also not conduct-
ing. A normally closed contact of K7 energizes the green "Normal" lemp
on the front panel.

When the input voltage drops below 200 v, the Q4 base voltage is
reduced to below 10 v, and @4 conducts. The collector voltage of @4 in-
creases to 10 v, turning on Q5, Q6, Q7, and Q8 and energizing both K7
and K8. The contacts of K7 extinguish the "Normal" lamp and light the

 
 

 

195

red "Low" chamber voltage lamp. A second set of K7 contacts controls
external circuits. K8 seals itself in and will remain energized, light-
ing the "Latch" lamp, until input voltage is. restored and "Reset" button
S2 is depressed. This enables the operators to identify a momentary
chamber voltage fault.

The voltage monitor circuit is tested by pressing "Test" push button
S1 on the front panel. This reduces the voltage at the base of Q4, simu-
lating a low input condition without causing significant reduction of
the chamber voltage itself.

2.5.6.3 Operating Instructions

2.5.7 Fast-Trip Comparator, ORNL Model Q-2609°

2.5.7.1 Description

General

The fast-trip comparator circuit (Fig. 2.5.16) compares the magni-
tude of two input dec signals having opposite polarities and produces an
output voltage having either of two possible values, depending upon which
input voltage is larger. Two electronic outputs drive logic circuits ex-
ternal to this unit, and there are also two reley drivers within the
unit. The change in voltage from one level to the other is completed in
less than 200 psec after the trip signal occurs. The relays can change
states in approximately 10 msec. Each relay has one set of contacts for
external connections and one set to perform an indicating function on
the front panel. One relay can be connected to hold a trip indication
after the trip has cleared, and the other relay indicates the immediate
state of the circuit.

Several external connections can be made that allow the circuit to
trip for a variety of input conditions. With a reference serving as one
signal, the circuit can trip on a positive or a negative input signal
and on an increasing or a decreasing signal. For the case of two ex-
ternal signals A and B, tripping action can take place when the magni-
tude of A is greater than or less than that of B, provided A and B have
opposite polarities.

Construction

The fast-trip comparator is constructed in a single module 1.40 in.
wide, 4.72 in. high, and 11.90 in. deep. It is a standard "one-unit"
plug-in module of the modular reactor instrumentation series depicted on
drawings Q-2600-1 to Q-2600-5.

The circuit is constructed on & printed circuit board mounted within
a shielding enclosure with removable sides.

Application

The fast-trip comparator is intended primarily to be used as a
voltage level discriminator for safety and control functions in a nuclear
reactor. For maximum flexibility the unit has two inputs, so that it
may be used either to compare two signals or to compare one signal with
an external reference. The circuit is bistable in nature; that is, there
is no change in output indication until the predetermined trip level is
exceeded, at which time the output suddenly changes from one state to
the other. The trip level is nominally zero volts; that is, the two in-
puts must be of opposite polarity, so that when the magnitude of one in-
put exceeds the magnitude of the other, the circuit changes state. By
use of suitable external jumpers the circuit can be arranged to trip on
either net positive or net negative input.

Two types of output are available. The logic output, intended for
use in fast safety systems, is —10 v normally and O v when tripped. The
switching time is less than 200 usec. Normally the logic level will
revert to normal as soon as the input signal drops below the trip level.
However, by use of external jumpers, the circuit can be made to latch,
or seal, the logic output in the trip state until manually reset, pro-
vided the trip signal persists for 10 msec or more.

The second type of output is provided by two relays. Both relays
are driven by the logic signal described previously and respond ac-
cordingly. Kl may be arranged to latch if the trip signal persists for
more than 10 msec; the relay will go to the trip state and remain there
until manually reset, regardless of whether or not the logic level
signal is arranged to latch. This arrangement is sometimes called a
"scram catcher," in that it allows a momentary trip to be located and
identified after it has disappeared. K2 operates directly off the logic
signal and will be in the same state. Contacts of both relays are
available for actuating external circuits.

Specifications

Specifications for the fast-trip comparator are as follows:

Trip range The trip range shall be adjustable
from +1 v to +10 v or from —1 v to
-10 v

Trip point accuracy Once the trip point has been set,

variations in temperature from

2.5.7.2 Theory of Operation

General

The fast-trip comparator is composed of three functional parts: sa
voltage comparator, logic switching circuits, and relay drivers.

The input stage, consisting of Ql and Q2, is a compound (Darlington)
differential amplifier having a high degree of temperature stability and
a high input impedance. This stage drives a simple differential ampli-
fier Q3, which, in turn, drives a Schmitt trigger circuit Q4. These
three stages make up the voltage comparator.

All transistors after the Schmitt trigger circuit act as switches
and are either off (open) or saturated (closed). Transistor Q5 acts as
a buffer to prevent the Schmitt trigger circuit from being affected by
variations in the load. Electronic output points are located at the
collectors of Q6 and Q7.

Two double-pole, double-throw relays Kl and K2 each provide one set
of contacts for the operation of external circuits and one set for the
operation of indicator lamps on the front panel of the trip circuit. Re-
lay Kl may be connected to hold the "Latch" indicator lamp Il from the
time a trip has occurred until the manual reset switch S2 has been de-
pressed, even if the signal level decreases below the trip point. Relay
K2 energizes indicator lamp I2 ("Trip") or I3 ("Normal"), depending upon
the existing state of the circuit. Either or both of the relay drivers
Q8 -and Q9 may be driven from either electronic output. For operational
flexibility the connections to the electronic outputs and the relay
drivers are made externally through plug P7. The following sections
provide a detailed discussion of the design and operation of the various
stages of the circuit.

The Voltage Comparator

 

The input stage Ql and Q2 is a compound differential amplifier. The
compounding Ql provides high input impedance. The two inputs are applied
to a single base, rather than differentially to the two bases, so that
no shift in output will occur when the two inputs are of equal magnitude

 
 

200

at various levels from —10 to +10 v. The 2-kilohm trimming adjustment
R2 is used to balance the input resistors R1 and R3. The output of the
first stage appears at the collector of Q2A and is coupled to the second
stage through R10 and R1lOa.

The second stage Q3 is a simple differential amplifier that provides
additional voltage gain to increase the sensitivity of the amplifier.
Overall negative feedback is employed from the collector of Q3B to the
base of QLA (R36) to adjust the sensitivity to the desired level and to
improve the temperature-drift characteristics. The dc level is adjusted
by trimpot R10 to establish the correct trip point.

The output of the second stage Q3 is directly coupled to the Schmitt
trigger circuit Q4. The Schmitt trigger circuit is a regenerative bi-
stable circuit that provides the actual voltage level discrimination.

The output of the Schmitt trigger circuit and all succeeding stages have
only two stable states, "Normal" and "Trip."

Jogic Switching Circuits

loading effects on the Schmitt trigger circuit are buffered by an
isolation stage Q5. The bistable signal is then coupled to Q6, where
the logic levels are established. When the collector of Q5 (and the base
of Q6) is in the "high," or more positive, state, Q6 is biased off,
allowing Zener diode D1 to be fired through R25. The logic level output
at pin A of P7 is then -10 v, as determined by the breakdown voltage of
Dl.

In the "low" state, when the voltage at the base of Q6 is less
positive (actually slightly negative), Q6 is saturated, shunting Zener
diode D1, and the magnitude of the output at pin A is near zero (less
than 0.2 v). The Q7 stage is nearly identical to Q6 and provides an in-
verted logic level output for maximum flexibility; that is, when the
level at pin A is -10 v, Q7 is saturated, producing "zero" level at pin
J. Conversely, when the level at pin A is "zero," Q7 is cut off and the
output at pin J is =-10 v.

The inherent speed of response of the entire electronic circuit, from
a sufficient level change at the input pin T to a logic level change at
either pin A or pin J, is about 10 psec. However, this speed of response
has been intentionally lessened to about 120 usec by capacitors Cl to C4
to reduce the tendency to respond to sharp noise spikes.

Relay Drivers

Either logic output may be connected to either or both of the two
relay drivers Q8 and Q9. Normally KL is intended to pick up when a trip
(abnormal) condition exists. To accomplish this, the base of Q8 is con-
nected through R30 and pin K of P7 to a logic output that is at —10 v in
the "Trip" state, namely, either pin A or pin J. Note that "Trip" and
"Normal" are related to the character of the input signal and refer to a
signal which may be either too large or too small and either positive or
negative. The proper connections for a desired signal and function cen
be determined by referring to the connection table on circuit diagram
Q-2609-1.

One set of contacts of Kl is used to latch in the coil of Kl to keep
it energized after a trip has occurred and cleared. This optional func-
tion is accomplished by connecting pin d of P7 to battery ground (pin W).
 

201

Relay K2, driven by Q9, is normally connected so as to drop out in
the trip state. This relay is intended to show the immediate state, and
no provisions are made to latch it.

One set of form C contacts is available from each relay to operate
external circuits.

The logic level output may be latched in the trip state by using
the output contacts of relay Kl. Pin b is connected to pin B, and either
positive or negative 15 v is connected to pin F, depending upon the nature
of the input signal. When this connection is used, K2 also latches, he-
cause it is driven by the logic signals.

2.5.7.3 Operating Instructions

Installation

The fast trip comparator Q-2609 is a module in the ORNL modular
reactor instrumentation series. Iike the other modules of the series,
it has standard connectors and dimensions and has a pin-and-hole code on
the rear plate so that the module will not be inserted in a wrong location
in a drawer. The module is installed by placing it in its proper location,
inserting the module firmly, and tightening the thumbscrew. The module
may be plugged in with power on without damage.

Operating Controls

The only integral operating controls are the "Trip Test" and the
"Reset" push buttons. The "Trip Test" push button causes the circuit to
trip by overriding the input signal. The circuit will remain in the trip
position if the screwdriver-actuated push button is rotated clockwise
after being depressed.

"Reset" is a momentary push button that releases relay K1 and the
"Latch" indication. :

In a good many applications of the fast-trip comparator, a single
signal will be compared against a reference. The reference can be fixed
by a simple external voltage divider, or it can be adjusted by means of
a Helipot located in the drawer into which the trip circuit is plugged.
This adjustment is shown on the circuit diagram as R4 and is, in effect,
an operating control of the trip circuit.

Connections

All connections to the fast-trip comparator are made through the
rear connector P7 when the module is inserted. After initial calibration
is completed, there are no adjustments or connections to be made within
the module itself. However, a high degree of flexibility is provided
through external connections. The various possible modes of operation
and the connections required to achieve them are detailed in the con-
nection table on circuit diagram Q-2609-1 and in the following section.

Operating Procedures

Input Signals. — The input signals to the trip circuit should be
supplied from a low-impedance source (500 ohms or less). A single signal
nay be either positive or negative within the range of *10 v. The magni-

 
 

202

tude of two different signals may be compared, but they must be of oppo-
site polarity. The input terminal for a single signal is pin T, and an O
external reference voltage of opposite polarity is required on pin M.

If two signals are compared, the reference voltage is not required, and

the second signal is connected to pin M.

Reference Voltage. — The external reference voltage is required on
pin M when the input is a single signal. This reference must be exactly
equal in magnitude to the desired signal trip point and of opposite
polarity. The source impedance should be 500 ohms or less. In applica-
tions where the trip point is to be changed occasionally, the reference
may be derived from a 500-ohm precision potentiometer connected to a 10-v
supply. A potentiometer with 0.1% linearity will be sufficiently ac-
curate to allow direct reading of the potentiometer dial as the trip
voltage. Such a potentiometer is shown on the circuit diagram as R4.

In applications where infrequent or no changes in trip point are
anticipated, the reference should be derived from a 10-v supply and a
fixed voltage divider with a total series resistance of approximately
500 ohms.

It should be noted that, within the accuracy specifications of the
trip comparator, the trip point is directly equal in magnitude to the
reference voltage, and any drift or inaccuracy of the reference will re-
sult in equal error of the trip point. The accuracy specifications do
not apply in the range —1 to O to +1 v, and adjusting the reference to
a trip point in this range should be avoided.

Signal Polarity and Direction. — Since the comparator is designed
for general-purpose use, it is capable of providing a trip signal for
any of the following conditions: o

1. positive input signal increasing to a value greater than arbitrary
positive reference value;

 

2. positive input signal decreasing to a value less than arbitrary
positive reference value;

3. negative input signal decreasing, becoming more negative than
arbitrary negative reference value;

4. negative input signal increasing, becoming more positive then
arbitrary negative reference value;

5. when input signal "A" is greater (more positive) than input signal
"B," both "A" and "B" positive;

6. when input signal "A" is less (more negative) then input signal "B,"
both "A" and "B" negative.

Different external connections are required for different types of
input signals to achieve proper output sense. These connections are
shown in the table on the circuit diagram (Fig. 2.5.16). The column
headings refer to the nature of the signal; for example, the second
column is headed "Pos. Signal, High Trip." This means that the input
signal may range from O to +10 v, and trip will occur when the signal is
greater in magnitude than the reference. The fifth column is headed
"Neg. Signal, Low Trip," which means that the signal range is 0 to =10 v
and that trip occurs when the signal is smaller in magnitude than the oO
 

203

reference. The column entries under the selected heading show the volt-
age or destination for the pin or terminal in the same row of column 1
on the left.

The preceding discussion of the second column, labeled "Pos. Signal,
High Trip," is continued. The first row shows pin T as the signal in-
put. Pin M connects to terminal 1, which is the wiper of the reference
potentiometer. Pin M could go instead to the pickoff tap of a fixed
divider if a fixed trip point is desired. Pin L connects to +10 v to
provide the proper test voltage. Pin A is jumpered to pin K to provide
proper drive to Q8. Pin J is jumpered to pin Z to provide proper drive
to Q9 and is also the correct logic level output for driving external
circuits.

Latching. — Latching instructions are not shown in the table in
Fig. 2.5.16, but they are shown at the appropriate connector pins on the
circuit disgram. With no latching, K1, K2, and the logic level outputs
will all indicate the immediate state of the comparator. Connecting pin
d to battery ground causes only Kl to latch, that is, to remain in the
trip state after a trip signal has cleared until the reset button is
pressed.

If it is desired to also latch the logic level outputs in the same
manner, it is necessary to Jumper pin b to pin B and connect an appropri-
ate voltage to pin F, as shown in the table. In this condition all out-
puts, Ki, K2, and both logic levels will latch and remain in the trip
state after a trip-level signal occurs.

Precautions

Relay Contacts. — The contacts of the relays used in the fast-trip
comparator circuit are rated for resistive loads only. If inductive
loads are necessary, appropriate contact-arc suppression techniques
should be employed.

Transistors. — Some of the transistors used in the circuit un-
avoidably have small reverse base-emitter voltage ratings. Most ordinary
laboratory-type ohmmeters, such as the Triplett 630 or the Simpson 260,
have sufficiently high voltage on some resistance scales to permanently
damage these transistors. The common practice of using an ohmmeter to
check transistors when trouble-shooting should be avoided in this unit.

Trip Point near Zero Volts. — The trip-point accuracy specifications
do not apply at trip voltages near zero. Owing to possible inaccuracy,
trip points between —1 and +1 v should be avoided.

2.5.8 Coincidence Matrix Monitor, ORNL Model Q-26241%
2.5.8.1 Description

General

The coincidence matrix monitor is designed to monitor and indicate
on front-panel meters the current through each leg and the total current
in a two-out-of-three relay matrix.

 

1lmgken from Instruction Manual, written by E. N. Fray, Instru-
mentation and Controls Division, July 23, 1965.

 
 

204

Construction

The coincidence matrix monitor is constructed in a module 5.66 in.
wide, 4.72 in. high, and 11.9 in. deep. It is a standard "four-unit"
plug-in module of the ORNL modular reactor instrumentation series depicted
on drawings Q-2600-1 to Q-2600-5.

Application

The coincidence matrix monitor is intended to monitor and to regu-
late the current supplied to a safety-rod scram clutch, or magnet, in a
nuclear reactor. Figure 2.5.17 is a diagram of a typical application,
where relay contacts A, B, and C come from separate safety channels.

partment drawing numbers) and subtitles for the coincidence matrix
monitor.

2.5.8.2 Theory of Operation

As indicated in Fig. 2.5.17, the total current delivered to the
clutch is adjusted by resistor Rl. If all the relay contacts are closed,
and since resistors R2, R3, and R4 are equal, the current will divide
equally in the three legs of the matrix. The total current goes through
the clutch and returns to ground through the "clutch current" meter.

The maximum voltage that can be applied to the clutch is limited by Zener
diode Dl to +30 v. An external meter may be connected between pins 10
and 14.

If a single channel trips, two legs of the matrix are opened and
all the current flows through the remaining leg. Therefore, the tripping
of either of the two remaining channels causes the third leg to open,
which interrupts the clutch current. With two legs open, the resistance
of the matrix is increased by & factor of 3; thus resistors R2, R3, and
R4 must be small enough so thet the current delivered to the clutch is
not decreased to less than a reliable holding current. To ensure that
the clutch coil can be deenergized, the monitor must be able to detect
leakage paths around the relay contacts. If the leskage resistance is
small enough, sufficient current can be supplied to keep the clutch
energized with the contacts open. For example, suppose channel A has
been tripped. However, one contact, instead of completely opening, can
now be represented by resistance Rye The minimum resistance value of

interest can be found by the equation

. E
tem T R, +R +R?’
c x
 

205

where
1m = minimum clutch holding current,
R, = clutch resistance,
E = maximum supply voltage.

The clutch current will divide between the branches B-C and A-B, where
the current through A-B is given by the equation

Ro

x = tem Ry, + R,

The requirement is that the current i, be easily detected on the meter
A-B .

2.5.8.3 Operating Instructions

Installation

The coincidence matrix monitor is a module in the ORNL modular re-
actor instrumentation series. Like the other modules of this series, it
has standard connectors and dimensions and has a pin-and-hole code on
the rear plate so that the module will not be inserted in a wrong lo-
cation in a drawer. The module is installed by placing it in its
proper location, inserting the module firmly, and tightening the thumb-
screw. The module may be plugged in with the power on without damage.

Operating Controls

Current Adjustment. — A recessed screwdriver adjustment, labeled
"Clutch Current Adjust," is located on the front panel. The proper
operating clutch-coil current determines this adjustment.

Panel Meters. — The panel meters are calibrated to indicate from O
to 250 ma. These meters are in series with the clutch and indicate coil
current directly.

2.6 SHIM AND REGULATING ROD CONTROL SYSTEM
2.6.1 Introduction

This section is concerned with the circuitry and circuit components
which are used routinely for operational control of the reactor. The rod
control system should be considered as a separate system from the rod
safety system described in Sect. 2.5. It is true that there is weak
coupling between the systems, but only to the extent that certain inter-
locks in the control system depend on information received from safety sys-
tem channels. Reverse coupling is not designed into the system; that is,
the rod control system circuits and components do not perform any safety
functions, either as input or output elements.

The design of the control rods and the drive units is described in
Sect. 2.7. The location of the rods with respect to the core, their
mounting and installation, rod worths, etc., are discussed in Sect. 2.7
and in refs. 1-4.

2.6.2 Rod Control Circuits

Figures 2.6.1 to 2.6.4 are block and elementary diagrams that pro-
vide the basic criteria for the design of the rod control system. Table
2.6.1 lists the interlocks, safety actions, prohibitions, and permitted
actions governing control rod action.l?

The reactor system is designed so that rod manipulation is either
a 100% manual operation or, optionally, an automatic rod control servo-
mechanism is used to maintain either constant flux or constant core out-
let temperature, depending on the power being generated in the core. The
rod servo is used to control one rod only; this rod is arbitrarily des~
ignated “control rod 1" on MSRE design drawings and in the text and fig-
ures in this report. The rod drive units (see Sect. 2.7) are inter-
changeable, and individual rod worths (ref. 3, p. 58) do not differ
widely from thimble to thimble. Therefore, the control system is de-
signed so that any one of the three rods may be selected as the servo-
controlled rod (rod 1). From this it can be seen that, without supple~
mentary information, the rod numbers used in design drawings, reports,
etc., cannot be used as the only information required to designate thimble

system calls for "Insert." All manual switches
and relays are cross-interlocked so that "Insert"
mode (see preceding Nos. 3, 4, 5, this table)
takes precedence over "Withdraw" mode. The ex-
ceptions are:

1. The servo can withdrew rod 1 within the span
of the regulating rod limit switch, approxi-
mately 6 in., while rods 2 and 3 are being
inserted

2. By manually actuating two switches simulta-
neously, two rods can be withdrawn while the
third is being inserted

Prohibited during Operate-Start control system

mode unless one of the following conditions is

met:

1) ‘YConfidence" is established in one or more
wide-range counting channels and the re-
actor period in the channel(s) providing
"Confidence" is greater than +25 sec

2) Confidence is established in the BF; count-
ing channel and the reactor vessel is less
than half full of fuel salt

3) Confidence is established in BF3 counting

1) Control system must be in Operate-Start mode "Start" is a submode of the "Operate" mode
(Sect. 1.4); Start and Run are mutually ex-
clusive

2) Reactor drain valve (FV-103) must be frozen

3) Pump bowl must be filled

NOTE: Group withdrawal is only intended for use during startup and at powers less than 500 kw. Power limitation is by means
of a circuit interlock in the radiator door control circuitry which requires that the reactor control system be in the "Operate-
Run" mode in order to raise the doors and thus demand power levels sbove 500 kw.

locations in the core. The selection of "control rod 1" as the servo-
operated regulating rod is administrative and is accomplished by making
the appropriate interconnections between the rod drive units and the
control and servo system circuits. These interconnections are made in
Junction box 120, located in the north electrical service area. Control
rods 2 and 3, designated as shim rods, are always manually controlled.
Figures 2.6.5 to 2.6.7 show the contacts and relays which directly govern
control rod operation. Figures 2.6.5 and 2.6.6 are concerned only with
the control of rod 1, the regulating rod. The dynamic brake (Fig. 2.6.6)
is an addition to the design (see ref. 5, pp. 41-42), and while it does
not appear on Fig. 2.6.5, it is always used in the circuit controlling
rod 1. Because it is the servo-controlled rod, the circuitry is more com-
plex than that required by the manually operated shim rods 2 and 3. The
automatic rod control servo and the principles governing its design and
operation are described in Sect. 2.6.3.

Certain interlocks are common to all control rod "Withdraw" cir-
cuits. The contact arrangement of these interlocks is shown in the
upper left corner of Fig. 2.6.5. These interlocks are shown in block
diagram form in Fig. 2.6.8. The "Confidence," "No Confidence," and
"Reactor Period" interlocks originate in the BF3 counting channel and
the wide-range counting channels described in Sects. 2.2 and 2.3 of
this report.

The "Automatic Reverse" (group insertion of all rods) has been out-
lined in detail in Table 2.6.1, and the circuitry is diagrammed in Fig.
2.6.9. The reactor operating modes are discussed in Sect. l.4.

The interlocks diagrammed in Figs. 2.6.5 and 2.6.8 meet the follow-
ing criterias:

1. Control rod withdrawal, during reactor start and at low powers
("Start" mode), is prevented unless at least one chammel of the low-
level flux instrumentation is complete, is operating correctly, and
is on scale. This defines "Confidence." "Confidence" is established
by a wide-range channel when all the following conditions are met:
a) the indicated count rate is not less than 2 cps and not greater

than 50,000 cps,

b) the selector switch on the model Q-261l4 pulse amplifier and
logarithmic count rate meter module is in the "Operate" posi-
tion, :

¢) all the Q-2609 fast-trip comparators (a total of eight — see
Fig. 2.3.3, Sect. 2.3) are plugged into their cabinet drawers
and the channel is selected by the operator.

"Confidence" is established by the BF3 counting channel when these re-
quirements are met:
d) the indicated count rate is not less then 10 cps and not greater
than 10,000 cps,
e) the "Use-Calibrate" switch on the count rate meter is in the
"Use" position.

2. Control rod withdrawal during the "Start" mode is prevented if the
reactor period, measured by either or both of the wide-range count-
ing channels in which there is "Confidence," is less than 25 sec.

 
 

 

226

3. Control rod withdrawal, either by the operator or by the servo con- .
troller, is prevented if an automatic "Reverse" is in force. OU

4. Simultaneous withdrawal (group withdrawal) of all rods is desirable
only during reactor start and at low powers and should be prohibited
8s a means of shimming when the reactor is in the power range (the
Run mode).

5. Once the reactor is in the power region (the Run mode) and develop-
ing more than 1 Mw, the wide-range counting chammel "Confidence"
interlocks in the Run mode circuitry (see Sect. 1.4) are bypassed
so that a loss of "Confidence" will not require a return to the
Start mode and consequent reduction in reactor power. This bypass-
ing requires that two of the three safety channels be in operation.
This bypassing is accomplished by control signals from the model
Q-2609 fast-trip comparators in the control rod safety system (see
Fig. 2.5.1, Sect. 2.5) and a seal contact on the Run mode relay. This
is done to permit long, sustained runs at power uninterrupted by mal-
functions in, or maintenance of, the wide-range counting channels.

The block diagram in Fig. 2.6.8 may be difficult to interpret at
first glance. It may be instructive to list and comment on the dif-
ferent conditions which produce continuity to point A in the diagram.

The combinations listed in Table 2.6.2 are consistent with the design
criteria and the characteristics of the instruments involved. Note

that if either one of the wide-range counting channel log count rate
meters is functioning correctly as defined by "confidence," but if the
reactor period is less than +25 sec, rod withdrawal is prevented re-
gardless of whether the reactor system is in Start or Run mode. This o
may appear inconsistent with the criteria in paragraph 5 above and con-
dition 4 in Table 2.6.2. This arrangement recognizes that it is highly
desirable to have at least one wide-range channel in service at all
levels of reactor power and that when they are in service the interlocks
which they provide will be in force. For example, suppose that the MSRE
was in the middle of a long, sustained power run at, say, 5 Mw and that
wide-range counting channel 2 was out of service for routine maintenance.
This is condition 2 in Table 2.6.2. Now, suppose that a malfunction de-
velops in the ICRM in the remaining wide-range counting channel 1, re-
sulting in a loss of "Confidence" in this remaining channel. This is
condition 4; reactor operation may continue unaffected by the loss of
the remaining wide-range channel as long as power is above 1 Mw. Again,
suppose that a malfunction not in the ICRM develops which produces a
spurious, short (less than 25 sec) reactor period signal. This inhibits
rod withdrawal, and the indication that a trip has taken place appears
on the panel of the Q=-2609 fast-trip comparator (see Fig. 2.3.3, Sect.
2.3). If a thorough check shows conclusively that the period indication
is spurious, operation can be restored by manual selection of the other
channel with the switch on the console or by putting the switch on the
Q-2614 ICRM in the "Calibrate" position, thus going into "No Confidence"
on the offending channel and establishing a signal path per condition 4.
Similarly, if it develops that, in this remaining channel, one of the
Q-2609 fast-trip comparators requires removal for servicing, the loss

of "Confidence" so produced will not inhibit reactor operation if power
is above 1 Mw. -

"Reverse" is the insertion, in group, of all control rods. It
takes place when the instruments indicate that system conditions have
exceeded operating limits to the extent that rod insertion is the pru-
dent action to be taken. The conditions or situations producing "Re-
verse" are listed in Table 2.6.1, and the circuitry which actuates the
"Reverse" relay is depicted in Fig. 2.6.9.

2.6.3 The Automatic Rod Controller

The linear power channels (refer to Sect. 2.4) and automatic rod
controller of the MSRE are shown in block diagram in Fig. 2.6.10. The
purpose of this system is to provide automatic control of the reactor
by the movement of one of the three shim rods in either of two controller
modes (refer to Sect. 1.4). There is also a provision for disabling,
through the servo "on-off" switch, the automatic controller in either
mode to permit manual operation of the rod by the operator. The other
two shim rods are always operated manually, as pointed out above.

One of the two automatic modes is called the flux mode and provides
automatic control of neutron flux at a level selected by the operator
when the reactor is in its "Start" mode of operation. The power range
in which this mode is used extends from about 10 w to 1 Mv. The second
mode is used to control the temperature of the fuel salt leaving the
core and is called the temperature mode. This mode is used when the
reactor is in the "Run" mode and is capable of adjusting the neutron
flux to maintain the reactor outlet temperature at a set point estab-
lished by the operator. In this mode the steady-state reactor power is
a function only of the thermal load, which may be varied from about 1
to 10 Mw. The instantaneous power levels depend upon the thermal load
and any changes in system temperatures required to achieve the desired
outlet temperature. Switching between these two modes of controller
operation is automatically accomplished when the reactor operating mode
is changed. Reference 1, pages 104 to 108, is suggested for additional
reading to augment this paragraph.

Significant features of the controller and its auxiliaries will be
described below by referring to Fig. 2.6.10. The actual circuit dia-
gram is shown in Fig. 2.6.11.

2.6.3.1 Basic Rod Control Circuit

The output element of the rod controller (Fig. 2.6.10) is a pair
of pilot relays which operate as simple "on-off" switches to actuate
the "Insert" and "Withdraw" relays in the rod drive motor circuit of
control rod 1. These "Insert" and "Withdraw" relays must always be
actuated to produce controlled rod movement regardless of whether the
reactor is being operated manually or automatically. The pilot relay
contacts are identified in Fig. 2.6.5 as contacts R,SS-NARC-Al and A2
for "Withdraw" and "Insert" respectively. The power contactors which
they control are relays K183 and K176, whose contacts are in the power
leads to the servo motor in the control rod drive selected as "control
rod 1." Amplifier 8 acts as a comparator with three inputs: (1) meas-
ured neutron flux, (2) flux demand, and (3) a signal proportional to rod
speed, The model Q-2627 synchronous demodulator” is used to convert
 

229

the ac signal from the tachometer to a dc voltage with an amplitude pro-
portional to rod speed and a polarity that depends upon the direction
of rotation of the rod drive motor. This dc signal provides negative
feedback to optimize the response of the servo mechanism.

When the controller is in the "flux" mode of operation, the operator
chooses the flux at which the reactor is to operate and at which the con-
troller output is zero by adjusting the demand potentiometer and the
range of the picoammeter in the channel selected as the control input
channel, This demand signal is identified as "¢ demand" in Fig. 2.6.10
and originates with the operator at the console. The "¢ demand" setting
determines the voltage from the picoammeter that is required to bring
the output of the comparator to zero (assuming no tachometer signal) and,
with the range selection, determines the value of neutron flux required
to produce that voltage. As indicated in Fig. 2.6.10, the range and the
output voltage level of the picoammeters are recorded by the data logger.

In addition, the range setting and level of the selected channel are re-
corded on a strip-chart power recorder located on the main control board.
Although not shown in Fig. 2.6.10, there is an illuminated indicator on
the main board immediately above the recorder, which displays the range
of the selected channel.

In the "temperature control" mode the demand voltage is generated
by the rod controller complex, and the range of the picoammeters is
fixed. The way in which this is accomplished is described in the next
section.

2.6.3.2 Temperature Control

The control of reactor outlet temperature is achieved by continu-
ously computing a flux set point so that the temperature rise of the
fuel salt through the core is just equal to the difference between the
outlet temperature set point [To 1gp and the measured reactor inlet tem-

perature Ty. Figure 2.6.12 is a diagram of the array of Q-2605 opera-
tional amplifiers that accomplish this computation.

The system is best explained by neglecting, for the moment, am-
plifier 5 and its connection to amplifier 6. Considering the other two
inputs to the summing amplifier 6, we note that, by proper choice of
polarity, the algebraic sum of these two inputs is equal to the differ-
ence between the desired outlet temperature [Tle (selected by the

operator through the model Q-2628 temperature servo demand drive unit)
and the measured inlet temperature T;. The output of amplifier 6 is
(still neglecting the third input) proportional to the desired tempera-
ture rise through the core and, at constant flow, is a measure of the
nuclear power required to achieve the desired outlet temperature. This
output, through a sign-changing amplifier 7 and limiting circuits not
included on Fig. 2.6.12, becomes the flux demand or set-point signal

to amplifier 8. Because of the varying conditions, both in the relation-
ship of neutron flux to total heat generation and possible sensor errors,
it is necessary to modify this set point if the measured outlet tempera-
ture is to be truly equal to the desired set-point value. The modifica-
tion of the set point is accomplished by use of amplifier 5, the reset

 
 

230

amplifier, to generate a correction term. The reset amplifier is an in-
tegrator which continuously compares the measured flux ¢, the measured
core differential temperature (z, - Ts) , and a correction term whose
value is a function of the sum of the other three inputs and slowly
alters the value of the correction term until the sum of the four in-
puts is zero, with the proper algebraic signs of the inputs considered.
Since the correction term, the output of amplifier 5, is forced by this
integration to be numerically equal to any discrepancy between measured
flux and measured differential temperature, applying this same correc-
tion term with the proper polarity alters the flux demand as required
to assure that the steady-state value of the measured outlet temperature
is exactly equal to the set point. The response of the integrator is
purposely adjusted to be considerably slower than the response of the
other amplifiers on this computing system. Therefore, if either the
reactor flux or inlet temperature, or both, experience a rapid change
caused, for example, by a load transient or high rate of manual shimming,
the error signal computation will initially proceed as if the integrator
were not .present. The controller will respond immediately to the tran-
sient, as explained in the first part of this paragraph.

Because of the rapid response of flux demand, and therefore flux,
to a change in inlet temperature or outlet temperature set point, it is
desirable that neither of these be permitted to change rapidly under
normal operating conditions. Inlet temperature changes, assuming con-
trol of outlet temperature at a constant set point, are caused by load
changes. These load changes are not normally permitted at a rate that
exceeds the capability of the rod controller to hold the outlet tempera-
ture constant. The rate of change of outlet temperature set point is
limited by using a motor-driven potentiometer to determine the refer-
ence voltage. This rate is necessarily very slow to prevent undesirable
thermal gradients in the system when the controller is operating in the
temperature mode, and, since it is desirable to match the outlet temper-
ature set point to the actual outlet temperature prior to changing from
manual to automatic control, a faster rate of altering the set point is
available to the operator when the temperature is not being automatically
controlled.

2.6.3.3 Flux Demand Limiting

Because components and devices do occasionally fail or malfunction
and may thereby cause an unscheduled increase or decrease in flux de=-
mend in the temperature mode, a limiting circuit, block disgrammed in
Figs. 2.6.10 and 2.6.11, has been provided which prevents the flux de-
mand signal from departing appreciably outside its normal range. This
feature 1s also useful to mitigate the consequences of an operator error
such as turning on the controller when the outlet temperature set point
is grossly different from the measured value.

In addition, a Q-2609 fast-trip comparator, shown in Fig. 2.6.10,
is used to provide an interlock (see Sect. 2.5, Fig. 2.5.8) to prevent
initiation of the Run mode of reactor operation while under automatic
control unless the computed flux demand is less than about 1 Mw. Since
the transfer from Start to Run must be made (by circuits not related to
the automatic rod controller) at a power level of about 1 Mw, this com-
parator assures that no significant power excursion will occur.

2.6.4 Regulating Rod Limit Switch Assenbly, Q-2586

It is good practice to limit the reactivity change that can be pro-
duced by the automatic controller to an amount equal to or slightly less
than the effective delayed neutron fraction B.r.. Since each rod in the
MSRE has a total full-stroke worth of approximately 2.2% in Lk /k (ref.

3, Sect. 4.3, Table 4.1, p. 58), the regulating rod limit switch as-
sembly, hereinafter referred to as RRLSA, is provided to limit the stroke
of No. 1 control rod to 6 in. when the automatic controller is in use.

Figure 2.6.13 is a simplified functional diagram of the RRISA, This
diagram does not depict the actual configuration of the system. The rod
drive unit does not actually contain any intermediate movable limit switches
as implied by the diagram. The actual short stroke limit switching takes
place in the control room, and the mechanism which accomplishes this is

shown in Figs. 2.6.14 to 2.6.17. Figure 2.6.18 is a mechanical diagram
of the drive train, and Fig. 2.6.19 is a detailed block diagram of the
assembly.

An ac servomechenism is used to position the limit switch cam when
the automatic reactor controller is operating. This follows typical po-
sitioning servo practice? when a synchro control transformer is used as
the position error sensor. The servo loop (Figs. 2.6.18 and 2.6.19)
consists of a size 15 control transformer whose output goes to an ac
amplifier (Fig. 2.6.20) s which drives the positioning servo motor. The
control transformer is mechanically coupled to the positioning servo
motor and is driven in a direction which reduces the error signal toward
zero. When the rod controller is "on," the electromechanic clutch is
engaged (the brake is off) and the cam is also comnected, through speed
changing gears and the differential gear set, to the ac servo motor. The
shim-locating motor is also directly connected to the limit switch cam
vy gears and through the other input of the mechanical differential. Be-
cause the differential gear set is included in the drive train, both the
ac servo motor and the shim-locating motor may be used independently and
simi taneously to obtain cam motion. The net cam rotation is proportional
to the algebraic sum of these two input rotations. The electromechanical
clutch-brake in the output gear train between the shim-locating motor and
the differential (see Figs. 2.6.18 and 2.6.19) is a design modification
which does not appear in the photographs. It was added to eliminate the
undesirable effects of coastdown of the shim-locating motor and of back-
lash in the motor's built-in gear reducer. Table 2.6.3 gives the rota-
tional characteristics of the various components in the system when the
reactor is in the subomatically controlled mode and with the gear ratios
in accordance with Fig. 2.6.18.

When the reactor is in the "Manual Control" mode, the control cir-
cuitry (Fig. 2.6.5) causes the electromechanical clutch-brake to become
deenergized; the mechanical drive connection from the ac servo motor to
the cam is broken and the brake is applied. Control eircuit interlocks
also prevent applying power to the shim-locat motor. Because of the
very high built-in reduction gearing (2400 to 1) in this motor, it is
not susceptible to being driven by torque applied to the output shaft.
The brake prevents rotation of the other input to the differential.
Therefore, both inputs to the differential are locked, and the limit
switch cam is not free to rotate when torqued externally.

From Table 2.6.3 it is seen that the cam speed resulting from re-
locating the span of the limit switches with the shim-relocating motor
is slightly less than the cam speed produced by control rod motion. With
the gear ratios shown in Fig. 2.6.18, these speeds are 2.25 and 2.50 rpm
respectively (see Table 2.6.3). The cam is cut for a maximum of 180°
rotation between limits, which is equivalent to 6 in. rod motion. The
position of the limit switches is adjustable; hence, the effective span
Aya (Fig. 2.6.13) of the regulating rod may be adjusted within this maxi-
mum of 6 in. From Fig. 2.6.14, it can be seen that the gearing, clutch,
‘motors, etc., are supported on movable mounts and bearing hangers. There-
fore, it is simple and inexpensive to change the cam speeds and the span.
A detailed description of the major components used in this unit is given
in Sect. 2.6.5. :

As noted sbove (see also Figs. 2.6.5 and 2.6.19), the net rotation
of the limit switch cam is the resultant of two components: (1) the
rotation produced by the balance motor and (2) the rotation of the
shim-locating motor. When the reactor is in the servo control mode
and if the operator is not relocating the position of the regulating
rod span, the balance motor, driving through the clutch (the brake is
disengaged) and the differential, rotates the limit switch cam through
an angle that is directly proportional to the linear motion of the servo-
controlled rod. Assume, for the sake of discussion, that the reactor is
being operated in steady state and that no fuel is being added. Burnup
and poisoning will cause slow withdrawal of rod 1, the servo-controlled
rod, unless the reactor is manually shimmed by the other two rods. If
no shimming takes place, the limit switch cam will continue to rotate
olookyise (see Fig. 2.6.5), and, unless the shim-locating motor is ac-
tuated to produce counterclockwise cam rotation, the upper shim regulating
rod limit switch will be opened, its associated relay K240 will drop out,
and contact K240F will open. This will prevent the servo system "With-
draw" relay contact R,SS-NARC-Al from transmitting power to the rod with-
draw relay K176. Note that the servo system is not turned off and that
it continues to exert control in the "Rod Insert" direction; that is, if
for any reason the servo calls for the insertion of negative reactivity
with the servo rod at the upper limit of the regulating rod span, the
rod insert requirement will be transmitted to relsy K183, which causes
the rod drive motor to insert the rod. This rod 1 insert relay, K183,
cross-interlocks the rod withdraw relay K176 so that an "Insert" request
from any source overrides all "Withdraw" requests. This cross interlock
is included in all rod drive circuits. The operator must now shim the
reactor. If he chooses to shim by using rod 1, the servo-controlled rod,
he does so by means of the individual rod control switch, S19, used for
manugl operation, This closes contact S1L9A and energizes K175, the re-
lay which causes the shim-locating motor to turn the cam counterclock-
wise. The limit switch closes, contact K240F closes, and the servo is in
command of rod 1. The servo now withdraws rod 1 until the upper limit
is again reached or until shimming requirements are met. The shim-
relocating motor moves the cam at a slightly lower speed than does the
balance motor, and the actual withdrawal of rod 1 in these circumstances
is a series of start and stop movements until the span of the regulating
rod is relocated. The alternate method of shimming is to withdraw either
or both of the manually controlled rods 2 and 3 until the servo automati-
cally returns rod 1 to a suitable place within the regulating rod span.

 
 

 

234

Should the servo controller malfunction and ask for a continuous
out-of-control withdrawal of rod 1, the withdrawal will only persist
until the upper regulating rod limit is reached. The "on-off" power
amplifier relays in the servo controller do not exert direct control
of the rod drive motors (see Fig. 2.6.5); instead they control the
"Withdraw" end "Insert" relays K176 and K183, and a servo malfunction
has to be accompanied by failure of other control-grade interlocks to
become of consequence.

Should the regulating rod limit switch mechanism misoperate in con-
Junction with a servo controller malfunction so that the cam fails to
rotate as the rod is being withdrawn by the servo, the control system
interlocks may call for a "Reverse" (group insertion of all three rods)
if the failure produces any of the situations listed in Table 2.6.1.
"Reverse" by the control system is independent of the condition of the
servo controller and may also be invoked should the operator inadvert-
ently withdraw either shim rod so as to produce any of the listed con=-
ditions.

If one of the shim regulating rod limit switches remains actuated
or if the cam fails to move off the mechanical stop, rod 1 is inhibited
from further motion in one direction only. The operator can provide con-
trol with rods 2 and 3 and can switch over to manual control until the
trouble is cleared.

A detailed step-by-step breakdown of the circuit and RRLSA responses
to various situations is included in Sect. 2.6.6.

2.6.4.1 Range Switching

The range switching circuits of the flux channels are extensive be-
cause of the large number of operating conditions possible. Figure 2.6.21
shows these circuits, as well as those associated with the various reactor
and rod controller modes.

The first two stages of the operator's range switches are used to
connect the proper feedback resistors by energizing appropriate relays
in the picoammeters. Contacts K204A and K204B (Fig. 2.6.21) are used
to disconnect the range selector switches and to automatically connect
a feedback resistor corresponding to a full-scale range of 15 Mv when
a "range seal" condition exists. The "range seal" is described below.

Stages 3 and 4 of the range switch are used for proper switching
of the inputs to the range indicator light assembly. This range indi-
cator displays, in exponential form, the nominal full-scale range of
the selected channel in watts. The range switching is by alternate
steps of factors of 3 and 3-1/3. Stege 3 monitors the position of the
range switches and the console channel selector switch and causes one
of two multiplying factors (1.5 and 0.5) to be illuminated. In the
event that K205 (another "range seal" relay) is energized, the 1.5
light 1s operated regardless of the position of either range switch.
Stage 4 causes illumination of the proper exponent in the range indi-
cator, thereby completing the identification of the range. The range
seal condition causes a 7 to appear in the exponent position, indie
cating a range of 1.5 X 107, or 15 Mw, when the range seal condition
exists.
 

235

Stage 5 is a voltage divider used to provide range information to
the date logger and range recorder. K208B contacts are used to switch
the range recorder input to the selected channel range switch. Again
K205 contacts disconnect the range selector switches and insert signals
corresponding to the 15-Mw condition when the range seal is energized.

Stage 6 is a permissive switch used to enforce the 1.5-Mw range
required to switch the operating mode of the reactor from Start to Rum.

Stage 7 is used for the range seal function, which will now be de-
scribed.

2.6.4.2 Range Seal

The transfer from Start to Run or Run to Start in reactor operation
involves a number of distinct, but related, operations. To assure that
all these are performed and that no severe transients are introduced as
a result of such transfer, the range seal circuits have been developed.

The range seal, as the name may imply, is an electrical latching
circuit which is energized whenever the reactor operating mode is
switched by the operator from Start to Run. This transfer is restricted
to power levels in the vicinity of 1 Mw. Energizing the range seal,
represented in Fig. 2.6.21 by relays K203, K204, and K205, disconnects
the range selector switches and causes the range of each picoammeter to
become 15 Mw, as described above. Inasmuch as the range selector switches
are now totally ineffective, 1t is reasonable to assume that they may
be in any position during subsequent operations in the Run mode. It
should be noted that the Run mode may be terminated automatically under
certain conditions. Should this occur, the range seal circuits are used
to automatically force the rod controller flux set point to about 1 Mw.
The operator can then assume control of flux set point by putting both
range selector switches in the 1.5-Mw position, at which time the flux
set point becomes 1.5 Mv multiplied by the setting of the flux demand
potentiometer.

The above features are shown in Fig. 2.6.21 at the bottom of the
sheet. Relays K203 through K208 are operated in the following manner:

A contact from the Run relay in the rod control system operates K206,
called a run auxiliary relay. This relay in turn energizes K203, K204,
and 205. If either of the range selector switches is turned from its
1.5-Mw position, the relays are sealed in their energized condition
through S1 or S2 and K202A. Relay K207 is the relay which defines, for
the controller and for the reset of the control system, the temperature
mode of operation. Although it is clear that K204 should always be en-
ergized when K206 is energized, the interposition of K204C between K206
and K207 has a purpose. Inasmuch as the temperature control system
cannot function properly unless the picoammeter range is 15 Mw, it was
decided to initiate the temperature mode by the operation of the same re-
lay, K204, that switches range. K208 is the relay which selects either
channel 1 or ‘channel 2 signals to be the input to the controller at the
request of the operator.

At the bottom of Fig. 2.6.21 is also shown the switching circuit
for the servo amplifier demand input. As described earlier, in the
temperature mode the computed flux demand serves as a reference to be
compared with the measured flux level. KX207A, normally open, serves

 
 

236

this function. If K207 is deenergized, as it will be whenever the "run" \
relay 1s deenergized, the controller will be in the flux mode, and a -
flux demand voltage is supplied through a K203, or range seal, contact.
If K203 is energized, the picoammeters are on their 15-Mw ranges, and
the setting of the operator's demand potentiometer is in terms of per-
cent of full scale and could represent as much as 15 Mw if used as a
reference to the controller. Therefore, K203 is used to introduce a
demand of 1 Mw, based on a 15-Mw range, whenever the range seal is en=-
ergized and the run relay deenergized, as described earlier.
The temperature reset amplifier, described earlier, compares flux
and temperatures to compute a correction term so that the reactor out-
let temperature is equal to its set point in steady state. Since the
flux signal into the controller depends upon the range of the picoam-
meter and the temperature signal does not, the reset mechanism would
be saturated during most operations at low power. To provide a means
for minimizing the error in the correction term at the time of transfer
from Start to Run, a fictitious signal representing a 1-Mv flux level
has been introduced whenever the range seal is deenergilzed. Since 1 Mw
corresponds to a differential temperature of 5°, the correction term
will at most be 5°, even if the power level is so low as to produce an
unmeasurable differential temperature. As the reactor power approaches
1 Mw, prior to initiating the Run mode, the reset amplifier begins to
operate properly. If the flux level is held actually at 1 Mw for a few
minutes prior to transfer to the Run mode, there should be no appreciable
change after transfer, since energizing K204 transfers the input to the
reset amplifier from a fictitious 1-Mw signal to a real 1-Mw signal com-
ing from the selected picoammeter. O

B. The active contact chain during "Withdraw," in servo, is:
1. Ry¢SS-NARC — Al — K24(0F — KA170D — K228A — K220A —
K183C — relay K176.
2. K240F opens and prevents further withdrawal by the servo.

II. Regulating rod at upper limit of the RRLSA; operator acts to let
servo continue rod withdrawal

A. This requires that the circuit to relay KL76 be restored to en-
ergize relay K240 (see A above).

B. This is permitted if the RRLSA is withdrawn so that its upper
limit switch 1s not actuated. This is accomplished by manual
operation of S19A to energize relay Ki75. The contect chain
in circuit 175 is: S19A — S20B — S21B — K170H — K241A — relay
175 energized.

 

SThis synchro was also designed for use as a control transmitter. ( "—-
 

III.

Iv.

239

C. When relay 175 is energized, the RRLSA cam moves off the upper
limit and these actions follow:

1. K240F closes.

2. K176 is energized since, by hypothesis, the servo error
signal requesting withdraw rod 1 still exists and servo
relay contact R SS5-NARC-AL is still closed. The RRLSA cam
is now receiving motion from two sources:

a) Clockwise rotation produced by the actual withdrawal of
rod 1, which rotates the position synchro in the RRLSA.

b) Counterclockwise rotation produced by the operator's
closure of the manual shim switch (819), which operates
the shim-locating motor in the RRISA.

c) Since the cam speed produced by withdrawing rod 1 is
slightly faster than the speed in the opposite direction
produced by the shim-locating motor, the net rotation
of the cam tends to be clockwise. Therefore, the motion
of rod 1 will tend to keep the cam at its upper limit,
while at the same time the operator is continuing to re-
verse the cam. Rod 1 will move up in steps as long as
the servo requests withdrawal.

d) When the servo error signal becomes zero:

1) R,SS-NARC-Al opens and relay K176 is deenergized.

2) If the operator continues to request withdrawal of
rod 1 by actuating S19A and energizing relay K175,
the cam continues to move counterclockwise. Pre~
sumably the operator will stop the cam so that it
is midway between limits. If the cam reaches the
lower limit and energizes relay K24l1, rod 1 is pre-
vented from responding to a servo error signal call-
ing for rod insertion.

Servo inserts regulating rod to lower limit of the RRLSA

Control system response is same as in I, but in opposite directions.

Regulating rod at lower limit of the RRLSA; operator acts to let

servo continue rod insertion

Control system response is same as in IT, but in opposite directions.

Manual insert of rod 1 (regulating rod) or manual or automatic re-

verse of all rods is requested

A. Any one of contacts S22B, S19D, or K186F is closed.

B. Assume that rod 1 is between limits of the RRLSA; then the
pertinent contact chain becomes: (S22B, S19D, or K186F) —
KA170E — K240A — relay K182.

C. The shim-locating motor rotates cam in the "Insert" direction.
Note: Rod 1 does not move during this step as the cam approaches
the upper limit switch in the RRILSA.

D. The upper limit switch is actuated by the cam and relay K240 is
deenergized.

1. Contact K240A opens and stops the shim-locating motor.
2. Contact K240C closes and the relevant contact chain be-
comes: (S22B, 19D, or K186F) — KAL70E — KA240C —

K230A — K231A — relay K183.

E. Relay contact K183A closes, causing the drive motor for rod 1
to insert the rod. The cam will be rotated opposite in direc-

 
 

240

tion to its original rotation per VC above, and this action \U
will continue until it is backed away from the upper limit
switch in the RRISA. Relay K240 is energized, and the cycle,
starting with VB above, is repeated. The action is similar
to that described above in IIB.
F. Once rod 1 has reached either of the limit switches in the
RRISA, its speed is limited by the speed with which the posi-
tion of the RRLSA can be changed. This is approximately 10%
less than that of rod 1.

G. If, during a request for "insert" per VA above, the servo
also requests rod 1 insert, the resulting action is to im-
mediately insert rod 1 until the lower cam limit switch in
RRISA is reached. During this time the rotational speed of
the cam will be the absolute difference of two speeds; namely:
1. The speed, counterclockwise, of rod 1 reproduced by the

rod position synchro which drives the cam.
2. The speed, clockwise, of the RRLSA produced by the shim-
locating motor.

The shim-locating motor moves the cam at a slightly lower rate (approxi-
mately 10% less) than the position-transmitting synchro. The net speed
is the algebraic sum (absolute difference) of the two, thus (refer also
to Sect. 2.6.4 and Table 2.6.3):

Cam speed

+ (speed produced by shim-locating motor)
- (speed produced by rod 1 motion)

+ 0.9 (rod speed) — (rod speed) <

— 0.1 rod speed.

Therefore, in these circumstances, the cam will be turning, slowly in
a counterclockwise direction until the lower limit switch in the RRLSA
is actuated. As long as the servo is calling for rod 1 to insert, the
rod will be nudging the lower limit switch in the same manner as de-
scribed at the upper limit (see IIB).

H. If, during a reverse, the servo is requesting withdrawal of
rod 1, the reverse relay contact K186A (see Fig. 2.6.9) is
open and prevents energizing relays K174, K175, and K176.

This, in turn, prevents group withdraw of all rods, withdraw

RRISA, and individual withdraw of rod 1.

J. If the operator requests "insert rod 1" while the servo is re-
questing "withdraw," the result is, in terms of pertinent con-
tacts:

1. RySS-NARC-Al — K240F — KA170D — D228A — K229A — K183C —
energize relay K176 — (withdraw, rod 1). Rod 1 withdraws,
and the position transmitter rotates the cam clockwise
toward the upper limit of the RRLSA.

2. S190 — KA170E — K240A — energize relay K1.82. The shim-
locating motor rotates the cam clockwise toward the upper
limit RRLS.

3. The net result of 1 and 2 sbove is to make the RRLSA cam
approach its upper limit switch at a rate nearly twice as
fast as normal; that is, net speed, the absolute sum of the oO
 

241

two speed components, instead of the difference as described
in VG.
4. When the upper limit switch of the RRLSA is actuated, the
closed circuit, per 2 above, is broken because contacts
-K240A, K24(0F, and KA240C change their aspect. This ener-
gizes relay K183 and deenergizes K176, thus:

a) S190 — KAL70E — KA240C — K230A — K231A — ener-
gize K183. This calls for "insert rod 1." Note that
K176 hecomes deenergized for either of two reasons:
1) Energizing K183 opens K183C (see Jl above)
2) K240F opens.
In addition; contacts K183A and K183D appear in both "insert" and
"withdraw" power leads to the motor in rod drive 1, so that "insert"
overrides "withdraw." Note that, when the servo is controlling, this
overriding interlock is not in effect until the upper limit switch
in the RRLSA has been actuated.

b) Rod 1 is inserted, and the RRLSA cam is rotated counter-
clockwise and away from the upper limit of the RRLSA.

¢) Insertion of rod 1 continues momentarily until the RRLSA
cam leaves its upper limit switch.

1) KA240C opens.

2) Relay K183 is deenergized.

3) Rod 1 stops inserting.

4) K240A closes and the shim-locating motor drives the
cam clockwise toward the RRLSA upper limit.

5) K24OF closes, K183 closes, and relay K176 is ener- .
gized, causing rod 1 to withdraw.

6) The RRLSA cam is also now being driven toward its
upper limit by the position transmitter.

d) This condition (4, 5, and 6 above) is the same as that
originally postulated, assuming that the servo is still
requesting rod 1 withdraw and the operator is manually
calling for "insert."

2.7 CONTROL RODS AND ROD DRIVES

2.7.1 General Arrangement

The control rod drive unit and its housing are shown in Figs. 2.7.1
to 2.7.3. Figure 2.7.4 ig a simplified electromechanical diagram which
shows the functional location of the essential elements which comprise
the drive train. The gearing and the clutches are inside a cast-alu-
minum gear box. The drive motor, the two position-transmitting synchros,
and the position-indicating potentiometer are mounted on and outside the
gear box with thelr shafts carrying their drive gears projecting inside
the box so as to mesh with the sppropriate gears in the drive train
(Fig. 2.7.2).

The gear box subassembly, which includes the position transmitters
and the clutches, is located at the upper end of the drive unit in an
effort to keep the radiation-sensitive components (electrical insulation
and lubricant) as far from the reactor as feasible. Figure 2.7.5 is a
diagram of the gear train and the clutches. The worm and gear set is
of somewhat unorthodox design, if compared with typical standard prac=-
tice for this type of gearing (see Sect. 2.7.9.10). The other gears
are conventional.

The rod is scrammed by interrupting current to the electromechanical
clutch. During scram, the driven element of the overrunning clutch is
free to rotate and, except for a small amount of friction and inertia,
does not interfere with rotation of the output sprocket in the "rod
insert" direction.

The electromechanical clutch and the overrunning clutch provide
parallel power transmission paths between the motor and the output
sprocket, The arrangement is such that the overrunning clutch transmits
motor torque in the "rod insert" direction only and can be used to ap-
ply motor torque to the drive sprocket in the event that a rod sticks
or binds following a scram. If external torgue is applied to the output
sprocket in the "rod withdraw" direction of rotation, the overrunning
clutch provides a solid mechanical coupling between the drive sprocket
and the input side of the drive train. The worm and gear set are in-
herently self-locking with respect to torque in either direction origi-
nating at the output sprocket. This combination of overrunning clutch
and worm and gear set prevents rod withdrawals by upward forces applied
to the control rod or by a torque applied to the drive sprocket.

The drive unit housing, with the drive unit secured thereto, is
attached to the control rod thimble by means of a flange welded to the
bottom of the housing. Figure 2.7.6 is a photograph of the rod thimble,
which extends into the core vessel, and shows the mating flange. The
radial slots in the rim of the thimble flange mate with pins in the
housing flange and are required to ease the problem of orientation dur-
ing remote maintenance operations, The milled slot in the face of the
flange accepts the T-shaped flange fitting, which is cap-screwed to the
rod drive tow block (see Figs. 2.7.19, 2.7.20 and 2.7.14). It prevents
the rod from twisting when it is being detached from the tow block dur-
ing remote maintenance. Figure 2.7.7 is a photograph of the subassembly
formed by the thimbles and the graphite sampler taken before installation

 
 

264

on the reactor vessel. This illustration also affords a good view of
the lower, stationary halves of typical thermocouple disconnects de-
signed for remote handling. Figure 2.7.8 shows this subassembly mounted
on the reactor vessel; Fig. 2.7.9 is a line drawing of the control rod
drives and rod thimbles on the reactor vessel, The rod drives are off-
set radially to make room for the graphite sampler tube (not shown on
this sketch), which occupies space on the vertical center line through
the core vessel. Figure 2.7.10 shows the top of the control rod drives
installed on the reactor. This picture was taken looking down through
the access hole in the top of the secondary containment cell. The
electrical jumper cables and cooling air hoses with their disconnects
are visible in this picture. Electrical interconnections between drive
units and junction hoxes on the wall of the reactor cell are made with
flexible jumper cables. Each drive unit has its individual cable as-
sembly, which is designed for remote handling. The wires meking up the
cable are designed for high temperatures and use radiation-resistant
insulation (see Sect. 2.7.9). The wires are tightly bundled by means
of heat-shrinkable plastic tubing. This wire bundle is sheathed in a
loose-fitting, spirally wound stainless steel hose to give mechanical
protection. The fittings at each end use ceramic pin and socket inserts
of standard pattern in shells and receptacles which have been designed
to meet remote handling requirements. The interconnection cabling and
Junction boxes are described in Sect. 2.1.

2.7.2 Position Indication

Continuous indication of rod position is provided by two synchro
torque transmitter-receiver pairs, one "fine" and one "coarse." The
location of the transmitters on the gear box is shown in Fig. 2.7.2.

The "coarse" rod position transmitter rotates 5° per inch of rod
travel. Since this is less than one full turn for the maximum rod
travel of 60 in., the indication is unambiguous. The "coarse" position
receivers, one for each rod, are located on the main control board.

The "coarse" transmitter also supplies the ac error signal to the synchro
control transformer in the torque amplifying rod position follower.

This unit (see Fig. 2.6.20) drives the potentiometer which provides the
rod position input signal to the logger. On rod 1, the same ac signal

is used as the input to the Honeywell servo amplifier in the Instru-
mentation and Controls drawing Q-2586 shim regulating rod limit switch
assembly. This device is discussed in Sect. 2.6. The "fine" trans-
mitter rotates 60° per inch of rod travel and is expected to be capable
of resolving incremental sprocket chain motions to within £0,050 in.

Since both the "coarse" and "fine" synchro transmitters are geared
to the sprocket shaft, they indicate sprocket shaft rotation and do not
take into account changes in rod length caused by thermal expansion,
stretching, etc. In order to locate the control rod as accurately as
possible with respect to the reactor core, a single-point, pneumatically
operated, position device is employed. The position sensor consists of
an air nozzle at the bottom of the control rod which carries the flow
of rod cooling air from the hollow inside of the rod to the thimble.
When the rod is at the bottom of its normal stroke the nozzle is op-
 

265

posite a flow restrictor built into the thimble, The increase in pres-
sure drop caused by the restriction is the position indication. The
nozzle and restrictor are shown in Fig. 2.7.11, and the schematic dia-
gram of the pressure measuring instrumentation is shown in Fig. 2.7.12.
This device is manually operated and is used to check the zero readings
of the position-indicating synchros and, inferentially, provides in-
formation on how temperatures and stresses produce small changes in the
relative position of the rod with respect to the thimble.

2.7.3 Shock Absorber

The shock absorber is a development of the Vard Division of Royal
Industries, who built the drive units. It uses the general principle
of a typical hydraulic shock sbsorber but differs in that the working
"fluid" consists of 3/32-in.-dlam steel balls, Figure 2.7.13 is a
vertical cross-section view of the shock absorber installed in the drive
unit. Referring to this figure, the piston is the knob, which is an
integral part of the plunger. The latter is a tubular rod which is
threaded into the carriage and which connects the control rod tow block
to the carriage. The closed cylinder, partially filled with steel balls,
travels with the carriage and is positioned relative to the carriage
(and the plunger) by the buffer return spring. At the end of a scram
the bottom face of the cylinder strikes the stationary steel blocks
which are bolted to the housing flange. The plunger continues to move
downward and is decelerated by the forces developed by the springs and
by the flow of the steel balls around the knob on the plunger.

Shock~absorbing characteristics are adjusted by changing either
the spring constants or the preloading of the buffer return and ball
reset springs, or both, by changing the quantity and size of the steel
balls, and by sizing the knob on the plunger. A stroke of from 2.75 to
4.00 in, is considered satisfactory. During tests? of the prototype,
the shock absorber performed consistently and provided a stroke of 3.4
0.2 in, following rod scrams from a height of 51 in. This produced an
average deceleration of 6.2 g.

2.7.4 Cooling Air Flow and Temperature Monitoring

The drive is provided with two separate flows of cooling air. The
first is conducted into the thimble by means of a thin-walled tube that
projects into the stainless steel hose which supports the poison ele-
ments of the rod. This flow of air exits through the nozzle at the
lower end of the rod (see Fig. 2.7.11) and returns up through the an-
nulus formed by the outside of the rod and the inside of the thimble.
The second air stream is admitted at the top of the rod drive housing
and flows downward within the housing. This air flow is counter to the
first flow and prevents heated air from the thimble from rising into
the drive unit. Both streams are discharged into the reactor cell at
the upper end of the thimble.

Two bimetallic thermostatic switches are mounted on the support
colum of the drive unit approximately 8 in. above the lower sprocket.

 

IMSR-64-7, Feb. 10, 1964 (internal memorandum).

 
 

266

Their contacts are in series for redundancy and are set to open at
200°F. Switch actuation is annunciated in the control room; no control
action results.

These switches (Fig. 2.7.14) were added to the drive units after
they had seen service during the initial critical tests and low-power
runs of the reactor; hence they do not appear in the photographs of the
drive unit assembly. Their purpose is to signal the control room that
the drive unit is in danger of being subjected to damaging temperatures,
a condition which could result from loss of air flow into the housing,
excessive thimble temperatures, stoppage of the exhaust line, or ex-
cessively high ambient cell atmosphere temperature. The switches are
described in Sect. 2.7.9.9.

A second, or backup, method of checking temperatures within the
rod drive is shown in Fig. 2.7.15. This method uses the temperature
coefficient of resistance of the cooling fan motor windings (part of
the rod drive motor assembly) to measure the temperature within the rod
drive unit housings. The fan motor field windings typically have room-
temperature resistances of 520 ohms. Copper has a temperature coef-
ficient of resistance of 2.18 Xx 1073 ohm/ohm-°F over the temperature
range of interest. The slightly more than 10% change in resistance for
a 50°F change in winding temperature provides more than ample sensitivity.
Periodic measurements made during reactor operation showed that the dec
resistance of these windings gave a good linear correlation in following
in-cell air temperature. The duty cycle of the rod drive motors is ex-
ceedingly light; for example, the servo motor was "on" for a total of
51 sec in a 2-1/2-hr period with the reactor at an intermediate power
level and in servo control of the outlet temperatures. Manual shimming
is an infrequent operation and requires only a few seconds to accomplish.
In addition, the servo motors operate at a fraction of their rated ca-
pacity. The light load and duty cycle permit shutting off the fan long
enough to measure the dc resistance of one of the fan motor field wind-
ings. It is likely that the motor cooling fans are not needed in the
MSRE. As can be seen from Fig. 2.7.15, the fan motor being checked for
temperature is turned off temporarily by energizing the selector-switched
relays, and the temperature is indicated on the meter in the output cir-
cuit of the regulated voltage supply. The diodes across the motor wind-
ings prevent insulation damage by preventing high-voltage switching
transients caused by opening the highly inductive field winding.

2.7.5 Limit Switches

Limit switches and their actuators are a frequent problem area in
devices of this type. The MSRE rod drive unit was no exception; during
the first critical tests, the actuator became stuck at the lower limit.
This was caused by excessive wear and galling of soft steel sliding
bearing surfaces in the switch actuator guide. The design was altered
by providing hardened-steel, spring-loaded, floating bearing pads to
replace the galled bearing surfaces. Tae revised design is shown in
Fig. 2.7.16. The slide assembly is lubricated with Neolube (see Sect.
2.7.3.8). Figures 2.7.17 and 2.7.18 are photographs of the limit
switches and actuators installed on the drive unit.
 

267

2.7.6 Control Rods

Figure 2.7.19 is a photograph of the upper end of a display model
of the MSRE control rod with the poison elements? removed. The poison
elements? are shown in Fig. 2.7.11. There are three control rods, which
are identical in construction, each weighing approximately 11.2 1b.

The rod lengths are slightly different because of the required offset
of the control rod thimbles. The rod lengths are: rod 1, 11 ft 9-7/16
in.; rod 2, 11 £t 9 in.; and rod 3, 11 ft 7-3/16 in.

The control rod is attached to the control rod drive by means of a
two-bolt (3/8 in, X 16 thread) flange or tow block made of 304 stainless
steel. The drive mechanism contains a matching flange containing the
captive bolts. The assembly is designed to permit attachment of the
control rod drive flange to the control rod flange through an access
hatch in the drive unit case using a remote, manually operated extension
wrench,

The upper hose consists of a length (~6-1/2 ft) of 0.850-in.-0D by
1/2 in.-ID annularly corrugated, 321 stainless steel, flexible metal
hose with a single exterior layer of wire braid. The corrugated hose
provides a leaktight passage for the low-pressure (~8 psig, ~5 scfm)
rod cooling air to reach the poison elements. The wire mesh serves the
purpose of protecting the hose from abrasion, minimizes stretching of
the hose, and acts as an emergency retainer in the event of hose failure.
The 1/2-in. inside diameter of the hose permits passage of the 7/16-in.-
OD stationary cooling air tube which is attached to the upper drive
mechanism. When the rod is in motion, the corrugated hose and tow block
move up and down over the air tube.

The weld adapter serves to align the two types of metal hose used
in the rod construction. It also serves as the upper anchor point for
a 1/8-in.-0D INOR-8 retaining rod, which is located inside the lower
hose.

The lower hose is 5 ft 2 in. long, Inconel 600, fully interlocked,
unpacked, strip-wound flexible metal hose 47/64 in. OD and 5/8 in. ID.
The 38 Inconel~-clad poison elements, detailed in Fig. 2.7.11, are beaded
over the strip-wound hose, as shown in Fig. 2.7.20.

The lower end of the strip-wound hose is welded to the air exhaust
nozzle, which acts as the element retainer and lower anchor point for
the 1/8-in. retaining rod, The rod supports a portion of the weight of
the poison elements, contains the stretching of the strip-wound hose,
and acts as safety retainer in the event of hose failure.

During the two years of rod testing, there have been three inci-
dents of rod failure. Two failures were due to misoperation of the
equipment, and one incident was due to misalignment of 7/16=in.-0D air
tube in the corrugated upper hose. The upper hose was worn by the air
tube rubbing the inside surface of the hose so that when the rod was

released in scram, the hose broke away from the tow block when it hit
the mechanical stop in the shock absorber mechanism,

A bronze bushing was installed in the tow block to assure alignment
of the air tube and hose. Subsequent examination revealed only minor
wear at this point.

2.7.7 Rod Drop Timer

Routine operation of the MSRE? requires that the drop time for
each rod be checked each time before filling the reactor with fuel salt.
Figure 2.7.21 diagrams the timing circuitry used to measure drop times.
The timer consists of a continuously running synchronous motor connected,
via gearing, to a fast-acting electromechanical clutch-brake whose out-
put shaft drives an indicating pointer. The elapsed time indicated by
the pointer, therefore, is the time during which the clutch is engaged.
The drop time is easily measured. The rod is scrammed using the manual
scram switch on the console. This closes relay contact K29A, and the
timer clutch is engaged and remains engaged until a lower rod limit
switch is actuated by the rod at the end of the drop.

2.7.8 Performance Characteristics

This list of performance characteristics is derived from prototype
test data:

1. Rod speed with either 25- or 10-w motor running continuously at
rated voltage (115 v ac, 60 cps), 0.53 in./sec. Note: The change
in speed in going from "Up" to "Down" is approximately 1%.

2. Rod speed with the 25-w motor in "inching" mode (1/2 sec "On," 1/2
sec "Off," etc.), motor at rated voltage, 0.22 in./sec.

3. Motor speed as a function of applied voltage, see Fig. 2.7.22.
Note: Rod speed (in./sec) = 1.53 x 10™ X rpm of motor.

4. Scram performancel

a) Elapsed time to drop 51 in., 0.80 sec (see Fig. 2.7.23).

b) Average acceleration during scram for a 51-in. drop, 13.2
ft/sec? = 0.41g.

¢) Clutch release time, inferred from a curve of the square root
of distance vs elapsed time (see Fig. 2.7.24), 0.012 sec.

d) Figure 2.7.25 compares actual and required reactivity insertions
during scram. These curves are calculated from curves "A" and
"8B" on Fig. 2.7.23 and the calculated percent of total rod worth
vs distance curve, Fig. 1.19, p 59, ref. 2, and a total worth
of 4.1% Ne/k. This value of totel worth approximestes the total
reactivity Inserted by scramming any two of the three rods.
The initial height prior to scram was teken as 51 in.

2.7.9 Component Descriptions and Specifications
2.7.9.1 Rod Drive Motor Assembly

General Description

The drive motor is a 115-v ac, 60-hertz, two-pole, two-phase servo
motor rated at 25 Ww maximum output. As used in the MSRE, the input
pover is single-phase 115-v sc, and phase splitting is obtained with a
10- to 12~uf capacitor in series with one of the field windings. An ac
tachometer is mounted integrally on the motor shaft. The tachometer
output is used as a feedback signal to stabilize the servo controller,
Tachometer output is 6 v per 1000 rpm. A small blower is included as
part of the assembly. The blower is powered by a separate, capacitor-
type two-phase motor and runs continuously whether the servo motor is on
or off. These three units (motor, tachometer, and blower) are incorpo-
rated into a single unit supplied by the Diehl Electrical Division of the
Singer Manufacturing Company. The unit specified for the MSRE is sim-
ilar in shape, size, and performance to a standard Diehl 25-w motor No.
FPF 49-91-1. They are special in that they call for class H radiation=-
resistant electrical insulation and use radiation-resistant grease.
Performance data are given in Figs. 2.7.26 and 2.7.27.

Refer to UCNC Purchase Order 5651446, Item 1 (Requisition L-8824),
January 29, 1965,

2.7.9.6 Limit Switches

Limit switches are Micro Switch type V3-1301, a high-temperature
nuclear-radiation-resistant design, manufactured by Micro Switch Di-
vision, Minneapolis-Honeywell Regulator Company, Freeport, Illinois.
Catalog information describing this switch is supplemented by two let-
ters written by V. J. Brown, Los Angeles 22, California, to Povilas
Butkys, Vard Corporation. The letters are dated December 20, 1962, and
January 9, 1963.

2.7.9.7 Electrical Wiring

Internal wiring within the rod drive unit from the terminals on the
disconnect to the various components is of high-temperature, radiation-
resistant hookup wire. The prototype used Supertemp type MGT, manu~
factured by American Super-Temperature Wires, Inc., 50 West Canal Street,
Winooski, Vermont.

Micatemp, a similar type of wire manufactured by Rockbestos Wire
and Cable Company, Division of Aero Corporation, Nicoll and Conner
Streets, New Haven, Connecticut, is equally acceptable.

2.7.9.8 Iubrication

The gears, overrunning clutch, and the bearings in the gearbox,
motor, synchros, etc.,; are lubricated with a nuclear-radiation-resistant
grease: Shell Corporation type APL or California Research Corporation
type NRRG-159. This latter grease’’® is composed of "Cy¢_jg-alkylbi-

phenyl fluid inhibited with didodecyl selenide and gelled with a sodium
terephthalamate." The sprocket chain and the limit switch actuator are
coated with Neolube, a film of colloidal graphite deposited as a dis-
persion of graphite in a volatile carrier (isopropanol). Neolube is
manufactured by Huron Industries, Post Office Box 104, Port Huron,
Michigan.

2.7.9.9 Thermostatic Switches

The thermostats are small bimetal-type units with the bimetal
mounted in a ceramic tube. Sample switches were tested well beyond
destruction by heating to over 1200°F, and no release of solder or
other low-temperature melting point material was observed.

Technical data on these switches, based on the seller's catalog,
are as follows:

Electrical rating 50 wv at 115 to 230 v ac, non-
inductive load
Operating temperature Adjustable, by means of a screw,
range to 300°F.
Physical appearance 1/4 in. diam, 1-1/8 in. long;

terminal at each end with a 2-56
tapped hole for making electrical
connection

Contact operation To open on rising temperature

She range specified for the MSRE was 150 to 200°F.

The thermostats were purchased from the George Ulanet Company,
413-415 Market Street, Newark, New Jersey, their model No. 17-L3.
Refer to UCNC Purchase Order 59Y-17341, Requisition No. L-9682 dated
August 10, 1965.

2.7.9.10 Gears

All gears are of carbon steel or stainless steel. The 24 diametral-
pitch gears in the power train between the motor and the output sprocket
are of steel and designed particularly for the drive unit. The 32 di-
ametral-pitch gears which drive the synchros and the position potentiom-
eter are commercially available components with minor modifications
where required for mounting, ete.

The worm and gear set is the end product of test stand experience
with the prototype unit. The original design specified an aluminum
bronze worm wheel mating with a steel worm. The worm had a hardness of
38 to 42 on the Rockwell C scale and a surface finish of 64 pin, maxi-
mum roughness. These gears failed at a rapid rate by abrasive wear.

The final design of this gear pair, based on additional test stand ex-
perimentation and life testing with the prototype unit specified type
440C stainless steel, hardened to R, 55 or better, for both the worm

and gear. The worm thread was ground and had a surface finish of ap-
 

 

273

proximately 20 pin, The gears were lapped to form selectively fitted
pairs, Gear sets of other hardenable steels were tried in the proto-
type, and it was concluded that the determining factor for the steels
used in this service is probably surface hardness and finish, not any
particular type or alloy. :

2.8 LOAD CONTROL SYSTEM

The reactor loading system in the MSRE has been described in detail
in ORNL-TM-728.% Some design changes to improve the effectiveness of
the air seals and the annulus cooling air flow have been made since the
publication of TM-728, but the basic design remains unaltered. Briefly,
the nuclear power generated by the reactor is finally dissipated by a
coolant-salt-to-air radiator and discharged to the atmosphere via a
stack 70 ft high and 10 ft in diameter. Air flow through the radiator
is supplied by two large, 250-hp (nominal), axial flow fans. The ra-
diator consists of a bundle of 120 thin-walled tubes (0.750 in. diam,
0.072-in. wall, 30 ft long) bent in the shape of a zee (Fig. 2.8.1).

The radiator is enclosed by two vertically sliding doors which act, to
a degree, as alr flow control elements. Additional control of air flow
is obtained with a bypass damper and by selecting either one or both
fans. When the doors are fully lowered, cams on the gulde roller track
force the gasketed door against a flat sealing surface to prevent the
entry of alr to the radlator. Figure 2.8.2 shows the radiator, the
doors and their drive mechanism, and the coolant salt pump as they are
installed in the duct. Figure 2.8.3 is a simplified drawing of the
door drive mechanism. Note the flywheel which reduces the door ac-
celeration during a load scram when the clutch and brake are relessed.
The flywheel is connected to the shaft by an overrunning clutch so that
it continues to coast after the door reaches the lower limit.

The coolant salt experiences a calculated temperature drop (subject
to small changes caused by slight variations in flow) in the radiator
of 56°F at full power of 7.5 Mw. When ambient inlet air temperature is
in the 40°F region, typical operating parameters at the radiator are as
follows:

Coolant salt inlet temperature 1015°F
Coolant salt outlet temperature 1073°F
Air inlet temperature 42°F
Air outlet temperature 151°F
Air flow 200,000 cfm

Coolant salt freezes at 850°F, and the operating margin above the freez-
ing point is therefore 165°F. This margin will be less on cold days,
when the ambient temperature is reduced.

The remainder of this section is concerned with the instrumentaticn,
control, and protection of the complex of equipment that is used to re-
ject the reactor's energy output to the atmosphere.

It has been pointed out in ref. 2 (pp. 107 and 140) that the MSRE
is a load-following reactor and is inherently self-regulating when de-
veloping any appreciable power. In any realistic power reactor system,

the operators have little or no direct control over the public's demand
for power. There was, therefore, no incentive to control closely the
load on the reactor. The only requirement in the MSRE is that the op-
erators be able to establish and adjust the load about a point in any
region within the operating range, up to 7.5 Mw, of the reactor and to
do so in an orderly fashion. It can be seen from Fig. 2.8.4 that the
reactor load (the heat rejection at the radiator) is determined by five
independently variable elements, namely: (1) inlet radiator door, (2)
outlet radiator door, (3) main blower 1, (4) main blower 3, and (5) by-
pass damper. Over a considerable portion of the range, the same value
of load can be obtained by two or more different operating configurations
of the above equipment. It follows that load changing and adjusting, if
done strictly by manually manipulating these five different components,
may add considerably to the duties of the operator at a time when he
least needs such additional responsibility and, in addition, may produce
unnecessarily high thermal shocks with accompanying high stresses,

In view of the foregoing, the adjustment of the thermal load of
the reactor has been designed for either manual or programmed control.
With programmed control, load changes are accomplished by means of a
single control at the console (Fig. 2.8.5) when the selector switch
(8-23) is in the "Auto" position.

2.8.1 Blower Operation

The main blowers, 1 and 3, are axial flow propeller-type fans.
They are driven by direct-connected, 250-hp, 1750-rpm, three-phase,
440-v ac wound rotor induction motors. High rotor resistance starting
is incorporated in the power circuits to limit starting currents to ac-
ceptable values. During start, the motor windings are connected in
series to external resistances. As the motor accelerates, the external
resistance in each winding is successively reduced by timer-controlled
switching. This requires approximately 30 sec. After attaining full
speed, when all external resistances have been disconnected, the motors
operate as typical squirrel-cage induction motors. This startup cir-
cuitry operates automatically when a motor circuit breaker is closed to
start a blower and, in the following discussion, is not included as a
part of the reactor control system. The control system relays control
the blowers by operating the "Close" and "Trip" coils in these circuit
breakers.

2.8.2 Door Operation

Figure 2.8.6 is a diagram of the door drives. A single gear-reduced
motor provides power to raise both doors; individual door control is ob-
tained by means of clutches and brakes located on the separate sheave
drive shafts. Operating conditions of the elements governing door move-
ment in different situations are shown in Table 2.8.1.

Door position is indicated on the control console (Fig. 2.8.5) by
synchro position receivers driven by synchro transmitters. The trans-
mitters are mechanically connected, through gear reducers, to the sheave
drive shafts. The intermediate limit switches (Fig. 2.8.7), used as
control interlocks, are actuated by cams on the transmitting synchro
drives. The position of these switches is adjustable over a wide range.
The upper and lower limit switches are in redundant pairs and are ac=-
tuated directly by the doors. These limit switches are an integral part
of the control system used during normal operation. Additional switches
used solely to protect the doors and the drive mechanism from overtravel
and overload are provided. These are described in Sect. 2.8.6.

The bypass damper is positioned by an air cylinder with a built-in
positioner, as diagrammed in Fig. 2.8.6. Cylinder position, directly
proportional to cylinder pressure, is controlled either directly and
manually or with a pneumatic servo. The servo positions the bypass
damper to maintain the differential pressure drop AP across the damper

equal to the set-point value Pep

Direct manual control of damper position may be obtained by man-
ually adjusting the inlet pressure to the air cylinder with a pressure
regulator in the manual control station mounted on the main control
board. A three-way valve transfers cylinder air supply from the servo
to the pressure regulator.

Assuming that one or both blowers are on, servo control of AP
across the damper is accomplished from the console by operator adjust-
ment of Per with the switch labeled DP Demand (see Figs. 2.8.5 and

2.8.6). This switch operates an electric-motor-driven pressure regu-
lator, P X-AD2-Al, whose output ov goes to the pneumatic servo. If

the condition of other elements in the system (doors and blowers) is not

 
 

304

altered, a request for an increase (decrease) in Pop will cause the

bypass damper to close (open). If, however, the doors are moved or
blowers are turned on or off, the damper will also respond to maintain
AP equal to AP oo

When load control is being automatically programmed, the adjust-
ment of Pon is included in the program and is not directly manipulated

by the operator. In either control mode the values of AP and ep and
the damper position are indicated on the console.

2.8.3 Automatic Load Programming

As the reactor system is brought from zero to full power, the
various elements (as stated previously) governing reactor load are pro-
grammed in accordence with Fig. 2.8.8. This diagram is based on tests
conducted on January 31, 1967. The dashed portion of the door position
curve merely connects the end-point values of power obtained by moving
the doors from the fully closed to fully open positions. The curves
will shift slightly with changes in ambient temperature.

The programmed control system was designed with these fairly ob-
vious assumptions:

1. When the radiator is presenting a constant frontal area to the air
stream, heat transfer therefrom is closely related to static pres-
sure drop across the radiator.

2. Heat transfer from the radiator increases as the doors are raised
as long as the operating condition of the other flow elements
(blowers and bypass damper) remains unaltered. The tests referred
to above and in Fig. 2.8.8 indicate that the last 2 or 3 ft of door
travel exerts little influence on the load; that is, the doors are
most effective during the early stages of their movement.

3. The static pressure drop measured across the bypass damper (see
Fig. 2.8.6) differs only slightly from the static pressure across
the radiator; that is, the pressure drop in the branching ducts to
and from the radiator doors and the bypass damper, respectively, is
small compared with the pressure drop across the radiator tubes.

The programming control system diagremmed in Fig. 2.8.6 uses the
air flow differential pressure AP across the bypass damper and the limit
switches (Fig. 2.8.7) to program the sequence in which the doors are
raised, the blowers are turned on, and the bypass damper is opened or
closed. Control system pressure and limit switches also provide re-
strictive and permissive interlock signals. Figures 2.8.9 to 2.8.11
are, respectively, the block diagram snd the relay circuits which im-
plement the block diagram. The operation of the load control system
when the programmed load control ("Auto" control) is in use is best ex-
plained by tracing the sequence of events and operations which take
place as a particular power level is established following a reactor
start.

Suppose that operation at 7.5 Mw is required and the operator will
establish this value of reactor load using the programmed or automatic
load control mode of operation. Procedure and system actions are out-
lined below (refer to Figs. 2.8.5 to 2.8.11 in following the discussion):

Actuate the load control selector S23 to the "Auto" position. This
switch is spring-returned to the "Hold," or center, position; but, if
the conditions required to establish automatic operation have been met,
automatic load control is in force. These conditions are (see circuit
150, Fig. 2.8.10):%

1. reactor system in "Operate" mode, contact KA136F closed (see Sect.
1.4);

2. salt level in the fuel-pump bowl above 43% of full-scale level,
contact K97C closed;

3. fuel-salt pump speed greater than 1000 rpm, contact K96D closed;
4. coolant-salt pump speed greater than 1400 rpm, contact KLOE closed;
5. drain valve FV-103 frozen, contact K659D closed;

6. static air pressure drop AP across the radiator equal to the oper-
ator-established set point Fon in the bypass damper controller

(Fig. 2.8.6), contact K211A closed.
Alternate conditions to 6 above are:

7. system not in Run, contact KA139C closed;
8. bypass damper 100% "Open," contact K214A closed;

9. operator-established set-point signal Por to the bypass damper
controller set at zero.

With the automatic load control mode established and, in the case
under discussion, the conditions listed above obtaining, reactor power
is increased from near zero to approximately 1.0 Mw by the operator
turning on main blower 1 or 3 and requesting the load increase with the
load demand switch S24. Assume that it is decided to begin the ascent
to 100% power (7.5 Mw) using main blower 1. The operator will actuate
the main blower 1 Start switch S29, and, if system conditions are not
producing preventive interlocks, the following conditions prevail (refer
to the hock diagram in Fig. 2.8.9 and the circuits in Figs. 2.8.10 and
2.8.11): Co

1. The bypass damper is being held 100% open (ap, = 0),
2. both radiator doors are closed,

3. main blower 1 is "On,"

4, main blower 3 is "Off,"

 

“Conditions 1 to 5 must be met at all times to maintain automatic
load control; that is, they are not sealed. The remaining conditions
are required only to enter automatic load control but are not required
to stay in this mode.

 
 

306

5. main blower 3 has been selected to turn on automatically when the
load demand cannot be met by a single blower, Had the operator
elected to start with main blower 3, he would then have selected
main blower 1 to turn on automatically when the load demand requires
both blowers.

After main blower 1 is turned "On," the operator starts to load the re-
actor by actuating load demand switch S24. This causes the radiator
doors to start opening and, as long as S24 is actuated, they will con-
tinue to do so without restriction until the lower intermediate limit
is reached. The operator follows the course of reactor power by ob-
serving either the linear power recorder on the main control board or
the two indicators, RI-NLC1l-Al and RI-NLC2-A2, on the console. The
doors will continue to rise until the lower intermediate limit is
reached and the system power level is approximately 1 Mw. The doors
may be stopped at any point before this if it is desired to operate at
powers less than 1 Mw.

When the doors have been raised to the lower intermediate limit,

system conditions are:

1. main blower 1 is "On,"
2. bypass damper is being held 100% open (2p, = 0),

3. reactor power is approximately 1 Mw.

The 1-Mw level is the transition point from "Operate-Start" mode to
"Operate-Run," and further increases in power level require that the
Run mode of system operation be established. This has been discussed
in Sects. 1.4 and 4.2.

Once the system is in "Run" mode the operator can again request
additional load, using S24 as before. This can be seen by referring to
circuits 162 and 164, in which "Run" relay contacts KA139G and KB139D
bypass the intermediate limit relay contacts K219A and K223A respectively.
Note that if the automatic rod controller has been used during the pre-
ceding operations, it has been in the "Flux" control mode during "Start."
Going from "Start" to "Run" automatically puts the automatic controller
into the "Outlet Temperature" mode (see Sects. 1.4 and 2.6). As the
operator continues to request more load, the doors continue to rise
until fully open. As the doors are going from the partially raised,
intermediate limit, position to the upper limit position, the bypass
damper remains fully open since the control system, by means of contact
824A in circuit 151, Fig. 2.8.10, is keeping Pon = 0. The load is in-

creasing because of the increasing exposure of the radiator to the flow-
ing air stream. Once both doors reach their upper limits, the bypass
damper must start closing to divert more air through the radiator and
thus increase heat rejection. This is accomplished in circuit 153,

Fig. 2.8.10, by switch contact S24C. Closure of this contact turns on
the motor which drives the Pon device, P X-AD2-Al, in Fig. 2.8.6;

LL is increased, and the bypass damper controller P4C-AD2-A closes the

damper to satisfy the requirement for increased AP; more air is diverted
307

through the fully exposed radiator and more heat is extracted from the
system. Reactor power rises to meet this increased load. As before,
the operator continues to request increased load with S24 and to follow
the power by watching the linear channel instruments on the console and
the main board. Any power level in this region can be established by
the operator. This type of system response continues until the bypass
damper is fully closed and the entire output of main blower 1 is flow-
ing through the radiator. A summary of system conditions is:

1. main blower 1 "On,"
2. main blower 3 "Off,"
3. bypass damper 100% closed,
4. Aen at intermediate value,
5

. power level at approximately 5 Mw.

The only way now remaining to increase heat rejection (load) by
the radiator is to turn on the second blower, main blower 3 in this
discussion. Note, in Fig. 2.8.10, circuits 153 and 154, that when the
bypass damper is fully closed, the following circuit actions take place:
(1) contact K215A in circuit 153 opens, preventing further increases in

AP? and (2) contact K215F in circuit 154 closes and permits energizing
of relay 154, which will turn on the second main blower. At this point,
the value of ep is established and is equal to or greater than the

actual AP across the radiator. With the radiator presenting a constant
frontal area to the air stream, as it will when the doors are fixed at
their upper limits, the heat rejection is related to the AP across the
radiator. Now, when the operator asks for more load via the Load Demand
switch, S24, the circuitry (see action 2 above) is such that relay K154
is energized; this initiates the start of main blower 3. As this

blower picks up speed, it delivers additional air through the radiator,
thus raising AP above AP? and the bypass dsmper will open an amount

sufficient to bypass some or all of the additional air flow produced by
main blower 3, depending on whether or not AP and Pep were or were not

exactly equal when main blower 3 was turned on. The load may change
slightly when main blower 3 is turned on. This is attributed to the
large duct and the nonuniform shape of the radiator, which permits
slight changes in air flow which are not measured by the single probe
in the center of the duct. :

After the second main blower (3) is turned on, the bypass damper
is open, and the control circuit configuration (circuits 153 and 154)
is as it was just before the damper was completely closed with only
one blower running; that is, (1) contact K215A in circuit 153 (rig.
2.8.10) is closed, permitting changes in Loo by energizing relay 153,

and (2) contact K215F is open, and main blower 3, once "On," is sealed
and is no longer controlled by relay 154.

With both blowers "On" and with the bypass damper partially open,
the heat rejection (load) is increased, as before, by actuating Load

 
 

308

Demand switch S24. This causes Pep to increase, and the automatic

damper controller (Fig. 2.8.6) closes the bypass damper to divert more
air through the radiator. This mode of operation continues until the
bypass damper is from 75 to 100% closed” and the load, somewhat de-
pendent on ambient temperature, is in the 7- to 8-Mw region.

Reduction in load under automatic load control proceeds in the
reverse direction.

2.8.4 Manual Control

When the reactor load is in the Manual Control mode, the separate
components governing heat rejection (see earlier part of this section)
are treated as independent units and are controlled separately, Refer-
ring to Figs. 2.8.5, 2.8.10, and 2.8.11, it can be noted that each
door, Inlet and Outlet, has its own "Raise" and "Lower" switch and that
bypass damper position is controlled by a AP demand switch. The blowers
are not cross-interlocked with each other or controlled by door position
as they are during Automatic Load Control. The selection of a partic-
ular operating configuration of these components and the operational
path required to arrive at the desired configuration are entirely at
the operator's discretion. :

2.8.5 Interlocks

In either control mode the reactor loading system is subject to a
number of interlocks and control actions whose primary purpose is to
prevent or reduce the possibility that the coolant salt will freeze in
the radiator. These interlocks and control actions and their purpose
are listed and described in Teble 2.8.2 and, in some cases, amplified
in subsequent paragraphs of this section.

2.8.6 Load Scram

Load scram (or emergency closure of the radiator doors) is pro-
vided to prevent freezing of coolant salt in the radiator tubes. A
pessimistic, worst case, calculation® showed that salt freezing can
take place is less than a minute. Operating experience tends to con-
firm this calculation.

Figure 2.8.12 is a diagram of the instrument system used to provide
load scram, and Figs. 2.8.13 and 2.8.14 are elementary diagrams of the as-
sociated control circuits. The primary input information is coolant
salt temperature at the radiator outlet. Three independent temperature
measuring channels are used so that if any two of the three indicate
an abnormally low temperature, the clutches and brakes in the door drive
mechanism are automatically deenergized and the doors drop to the closed
position.

 

5Final damper position is adjusted to keep system temperatures at
reasonable values.

This augments III above. Except that
only one excess current relsy is used,
it has same degree of reliability and
redundancy. The excess current relay
hae its contacts in series with the
final upper limit switches and hence
the output actions are identical

This consists of a manually operated
switch with contacts in the control
power circuits of breaker K, This
circult breaker controls ac power to
the coolant salt pump

This switch bypasses all the interlocks
in eircuit 142, which controls the coolant
salt pump (refer to Sects. 3.3 and 4.2.3).
It is used only for short periods, when
it is absolutely mandatory, regardless of
other considerations, that the coolant
pump be operated to prevent a radiator
freeze.® This switch does not bypass the
overcurrent protection which is built into
the circuit breaker. Coolant pump opersa-
tion by this switch is annunciated

Refer to Fig. 2.8.17 for circuit details

11€

This is not a true lower limit (Sect. VII,
this table). These switches are actuated
approximately 8 in. above the fully closed,
or sealed, position. The doors then fall
freely as in load scram and acquire suf-
ficient velocity to ensure an effective

seal against leakage air flow across the
radiator (door sealing is described in

ref. 1, p. 298)

Redundancy: Two switches for each door
with contacts in series connected to one
relay

For details refer to:
a) Limit switch circuits 217 and 221,
Fig. 2.8.7

b) "Lower" door(s) circuits 163 and 165,

Clutch disengagement via either of
limit switch contacts in each clutch
circuit; refer to circuits 13 and 15,

Clutch disengagement by either of
two limit switch contacts which de-
energize "lower door" relay(s).
Refer to circuits 163 and 165, Fig.
2.8.11

Drive motor shutdown by either of
two limit switch contacts which de-
energize "lower" contactor in the
motor starter. Refer to circuit
568, Fig. 2.8.13

Drive motor shutdown by contact on
"lover door" relay, which de-

the motor starter. Refer to circuit

Brake actuation by either of two
limit switch contacts in circuits 14
and 16 (refer to Fig. 2.8.13)

If, because of malfunction, drive
motor is "On" when a door {or doors)
is sealed and brake is engaged, the
excess motor current relay (see IV,
this table) will shut motor off

Figure 2.8.15 depicts a typical temperature input signal chennel.
Note that this is virtually identical to the temperature instrumentation
used to provide rod scram (Sect. 2.5) except that the polarity of the
thermocouple in the test assembly’ is reversed; therefore, the appli-

cation of heat and the resulting temperature increase of this test
thermocouple appear as a reduction in temperature to the rest of the
instruments. Each temperature input channel can be tested by turning
on the heater in the test assembly and observing the response of the
relays, which are controlled by the Foxboro temperature switches. The
equivalent drop in temperature produced during the test procedure can
be observed on a meter by the person conducting the test.

A loss of coolant salt flow will inevitably produce freezing if
the doors are open and there is any sppreciable air flow through the
radiator. Therefore, the doors are also closed automatically by com~-
binations of signals from the flowmeters on the radiator outlet line
and from the coolant salt pump speed monitors. These signal combina=-
tions are tabulated in Fig. 2.8.12.

The pump speed measuring instrumentation is discussed in Sect. 6.
A "loss of speed" input signal to one of the speed monitors is simulated,
for testing purposes, by means of the calibration switch built into the
speed monitor. Output relay action indicates whether or not the sys-
tem is responding properly.

The instrumentation used to measure coolant salt flow rate is de-
scribed in Sect. 6. For test purposes, a simulated loss of flow signal
may be produced in each channel by shunting a leg of the resistance
bridge in the differential pressure cell, Observation of the output
relays gives an indication of input channel response.

Redundant door travel limit switches (Fig. 2.8.16) are employed
to protect the ability of the doors to drop when the safety system
calls for a load scram. Door limit switching has been described in
Table 2.8.2, but it is worth while to emphasize here that the primary
purpose of this redundancy is to prevent jamming of the doors or the
drive mechanism which, in turn, is likely to compromise their ability
to drop. An excess current relay in the motor circuit (Fig. 2.8.16) is
used to detect an overload caused by a jammed door, snarled cable, or
similar malfunction if it occurs either in the normal motion span of
the doors or at the limits, The action of both of these limiting cir-
cuits is to stop the drive motor by deenergizing the relays in the motor
starter. Manuel reset (refer to circuits 255 and 256, Fig. 2.8.16) is
required before restarting the drive motor.

Insofar as possible the limit switch design and installation follow
the recommended safety-system practices outlined in Sect. 1.5.

The predominant requirement in controlling and operating the load
control system is to prevent a frozen radiator, To this end the cir-
cuitry diagrammed in Fig. 2.8.17 was added. The time required to freeze
the salt in the radiator is extended if circulation is maintained with

 

"Molten-Salt Reactor Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Jan. 31, 1964,

the coolant pump. The coolant pump control circuit (see Sect. 4) con-
tains interlocks which stop the pump if it experiences a loss of motor-
cooling water or lube oil. The salt pumps cannot run for any appreciable
length of time without oil or cooling water, but no harm will come to
either pump or motor during the first minute or so following a loss of
either. The manual switch, S127, located on the main control board,
overrides these interlocks which are capable of stopping the coolant
pump. It does not bypass the overload protection in the coolant pump
circuit breaker. Use of this overriding switch is controlled adminis-
tratively and is only permitted if the pump stops and a frozen radiator
is imminent.

2.9 HEALTH PHYSICS MONITORING
2.2.1 Introduction

The purpose of the Health Physics Monitoring System? is to provide
personnel protection at the reactor site from radiation hazards due to
airborne and fixed source activity. The monitors composing this system
are placed at strategically located points throughout the reactor build-
ing. Those monitors which measure ares activity and airborne activity
make up the Facility Radiation and Contamination System!™3 and produce
signals which are transmitted to a central annunciator panel located in
the reactor auxiliary control room and to the Iaboratory Emergency Con-
trol Center in Building 2500. The Facility Radiation and Contamination
System also produces a building evacuation signal based upon finding a
coincidence of at least two monitors in an alarmed state. The other
monitors composing the general system are mainly for personal survey and
include such items as beta-gamma survey meters, a hand-and-foot counter,
and smear counters for use by Health Physics personnel.

2.9.2 Facility Radiation and Contamination System

2.9.2.1 Introduction

A Facility Radiation and Contamination System was installed in the
Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment Building 7503 to continuously and auto-
matically monitor gamma radiation (by seven gamma monitrons) and air
contamination (by seven beta-gamma air monitors) in the entire facility.
These instruments and other components in the network provide health
physics monitoring information, sound local alarms when gbnormal con-
ditions occur, and indicate the abnormal conditions on a central panel-
board and at the Laboratory Emergency Control Center in Building 2500.

Operating personnel are first given warning when a "caution level"
of 7.5 mr/hr or 1000 counts/min is detected by a monitron or beta-gamma
air monitor respectively. A second warning is given when a "high level”
is detected, that is, 23 mr/hr by a monitron or 4000 counts/min by a
beta-gamma air monitor.

The building evacuation system operates automatically when two or
more monitrons or two or more air monitors from a specific group of
instruments detect a "high level" of radiation or air contamination. An

 

The system is further described in ORNI-TM-1127, Description of
Facility Radiation Contamination System Installed in the Molten-Salt
Reactor Experiment Building 7503, May 13, 1965, by J. A. Russell and
D. J. Knowles. Parts of this report have been extracted verbatim from

audible alarm in the building will be actuated, warning lights outside
the building will flash, and an alarm signal will be transmitted to the
Laboratory Emergency Control Center, Building 2500.

2.9.2.2 System Description

The gamma radiation level is monitored by seven monitrons located
throughout the building (Table 2.9.1). Air is monitored for beta-~-gamma-
emitting particles by seven constant air monitors located throughout the
building. See Figs. 2.9.1 and 2.9.2 for the location of all the instru-
ments.

Since none of the health physics functions originally designed into
the monitrons and air monitors were altered, each instrument is an in-
dependent unit that retains all its local alarm features. Each instru-
ment, however, is connected to an individual indicator module on the
monitoring panel located in the Auxiliary Control Room, Nuclear Board 5.
By means of three colored lamps, which normally give a dim light, an
indicator module indicates the condition of the instrument to which it
is connected; that is, a white lamp burns at full intensity if the in-
strument is inoperative, an smber lamp burns at full intensity if the
"caution alarm level" (7.5 mr/hr for a monitron and 1000 counts/min for
a beta-gamms air monitor) is reached, and a red lamp burns at full in-
tensity if the "high level" (23 mr/hr for a monitron and 4000 counts/min
for a beta-gamma air monitor) is reached (Table 2.9.2). Any change in
the intensity of any lamp, that is, from dim to bright, is announced by
the sounding of a buzzer at the monitoring panel and by annunciation on
the main board.

The high-level alarm outputs of six selected monitron indicator
modules are connected to a coincidence module, and the high-level alarm
outputs of four selected constant air monitors are connected to a coinci-
dence module. If a coincidence module receives a high-level alarm signal
from any two or more constant air monitors or monitrons in a group, the
building evacuation system is actuated (see Table 2.9.1). See Fig.
2.9.3 for a block diagram of the system and Fig. 2.9.4 for the control
schematic.

2.9.2.3 Components

Panelboard

The central panelboard for the entire system, located in the Auxil-
iary Control Room on Nuclear Panel 5, consists of two 1l2-module racks,
one central control chassis, and one dc power supply (Fig. 2.9.2). The
12-module racks contain one indicating module for each instrument, coin-
cidence modules for the beta-gamma radiation alarm system and the con-
tamination alarm system, a remote alarm module, a buzzer module, and a
manual evacuation module. The remote alarm module transmits a signal to
a single annunciator on the main control panel. The racks and modules
are made of anodized aluminum. The modules have anodized Metalphoto
front panels. A Metalphoto text strip is provided at the top of each
rack for instrument identification. The central control chassis contains
menual switches, timers, relays, and monitoring equipment which are parts
of the system but not located in modules. For circuit details on the
central control chassis, see Fig. 2.9.5.

Monitron

The remote monitron (ORNL model Q-1154B) is an ac-powered, null-type
radiation detection instrument for monitoring gamms radiation. The
monitron consists of two basic units: (1) a control chassis, which con-
tains the power supply, the main amplifier, a radiation-level indicating
meter, and the controls; and (2) a preesmplifier and ion-chamber detector
assembly. The detector assembly can be located remotely 50 ft or more
from the control chassis. A O-to-10-mv recorder or a O-to-1l-ma meter oO
can be connected to the monitron. The range of the meter is O to 25
mr/hr, and the calibrated accuracy of the meter is within 3% for gamma
radiation. The zero setting may be checked by means of a push button.

When the set point of an alarm circuit in the main chassis is
exceeded, a bell is rung and a red lamp on the instrument is lighted.

A connection on the instrument for an external alarm is used to operate
the caution-level alarm for the system. In addition to these standard
features, the monitrons installed in Building 7503 have two other
features: (1) warmup time delay relays installed on the main chassis
and (2) a high-level alarm meter relay installed on an accessory chassis.

The instrument and alarms operate as follows:

1. A power failure or a disconnected power cord will cause the white
lamp on the central control panel to burn brightly. After power is
restored and a l-min delay for warmup, the white lamp resets itself.
During this l-min delay, caution and high-level alarms at the instru-
ment might sound, but the same alarms on the central panel are locked
out and will not sound.

2. If the caution level of 7.5 mr/hr is exceeded, an electronic alarm
circuit causes the yellow lamp on the central panel to burn brightly
and the bell at the instrument to ring. The alarms are automatically
reset at the instrument when the radiation level decreases below 7.5
mr/hr, but they must be reset msnually at the central panel.

3. The O-to-1l-ma meter output terminals are connected to the accessory
meter relay, which is set to operate when the 23 mr/hr (high-level) CJ
335

alarm set point is exceeded. At 23 mr/hr the bell at the instrument
will be ringing, since it started at 7.5 mr/hr, and the red lamp on
the central panel will burn brightly. When the radiation level de-
creases to less than 23 mr/hr, the high-level alarm at the instrument
is automatically reset by a signal interrupter (allows a reset every
30 sec) from the central panel. The central panel alarm is reset
manually.

Beta-Gamma Constant Air Monitor

This monitor consists of an aspirating system, a paper-tape filter,
a halogen-type Geiger-Mueller tube detector, a linear count-rate meter,

a recorder, and visible and audible alarms. Air is drawn through the
filter by a Roots blower. A sample containing beta-gamma-emitting parti-
cles is collected on the paper-tape filter (collected sample size of

1x 2-1/2 in.). The sample tape is advanced automatically every 24 hr.
The tape may be advanced manually at any time by the operator. The de-
tector counts the sample as it is being collected. The count-rate meter
is a linear duty-cycle type utilizing a single range and having an in-
ternal high-voltage supply. The normal range is O to 5000 counts/min,
and ranges of 0 to 250, 0 to 1000, O to 10,000, and O to 25,000 counts/min
at full scale may be obtained by various interconnections of two jumper
wires under the chassis. The input voltage sensitivity of the rate meter
is 200 mv. The overall accuracy of the rate meter, including the effect
of long-term drift, is within 5%. The corona-regulated high-voltage
supply is nominally 900 v with #150 v adjustment. The maximum load cur-
rent is 20 pa.

The rate meter has adjustable high-level and caution alarms and
puts out a l-ma full-scale signal to drive an integrally mounted Rustrack
recorder. The caution alarm is adjustable over the range of approximately
2 to 58% of full scale, and the high-level alarm is adjustable from the
caution-alarm set point to full scale. The caution alarm is an electronic
circuit which employs a dual triode and plate relay with potentiometer
adjustment. The relay is energized below the trip point and is deenergized
by current transfer from one triode to the other by a diode that couples
the cathode circuits. Hysteresis is approximately 4% of full scale. The
high-level trip is accomplished by the high contact on a contact-making
meter which energizes the high-level trip relay.

When the set point is reached, the meter contacts and relay are
locked in; these are released by depressing the reset push button. A
low-level pointer on the panel meter has no contacts and is used only as
a visual indicator. The pointer should be set at the level corresponding
to the caution-alarm set point.

The instrument has an alarm panel with four lights, a bell, and a
buzzer. When the caution set point is reached, an amber lamp is lighted
and the buzzer is energized. There is no switch to silence the buzzer,
and the operator is expected to advance the tape when this point is
reached. When the high-level trip point is reached, a red lamp is
lighted and the bell rings. The bell can be silenced by a toggle switch,
and when this is done, an amber neon indicator is lighted.

When the filter tape breaks, a red neon indicator is energized and
the caution circuit is energized through a flasher. The amber neon bulb

 
 

336

burns continuously, and the caution light and the buzzer come on inter-

mittently. If a tape breaks and, the caution alarm sounds at this same

time, the tape-break neon light, the caution light, and the buzzer will

be on continuously. A test push button permits checking the alarm panel
by simultaneously simulating tape break and high-level alarm signals.

In addition to these standard features, all air monitors at Building
7503 have an accessory "instrument-inoperative' chassis containing a
meter relay. The instrument and alarms operate as follows:

1. An accessory meter relay connected to the O-to-l-ma output of
the count-rate meter will cause the white "inoperative" light on the
central panel to burn brightly whenever the meter pointer drops to zero,
indicating no signal from the instrument. After power is restored and
a 60-sec delay, this alarm clears itself. During the 60-sec delay,
local caution and high-level alarms do not sound since they are locked
out.

2. At the caution level of 1000 counts/min, an electronic alarm
circuit will cause the yellow lamp in the control room to burn brightly.
With an ORNL model Q-2240 air monitor, a buzzer will sound at the instru-
ment. The alarm is automatically reset when the filter is changed.

3. At the high level of 4000 counts/min, the panel meter relay on
the instrument causes the red lamp in the control room to burn brightly.
Also, the bell sounds. These alarms are reset by advancing the filter
and by pressing the manual reset button on the monitor.

Indicator Module

The indicator module (ORNL model Q-2563-1) consists of three inde-
pendent transistorized channels, each operating an indicator lemp and
providing a dc voltage shift signal for alarm or control purposes and a
voltage pulse signal for operating the buzzer module. The three lamps
and a push button are on the front panel. Each module is 35.8 mm wide,
120 mm high, and 125.8 mm deep. All connections are made on printed
strip connections at the rear edge of the plug-in module.

When the instrument connected to an indicator module is operating
normally, all lamps on that module are dim (Table 2.9.2). When the
module receives a signal that the primary instrument is operating ab-
normally or that the caution or the high-level alarm values have been
exceeded, the lamps burn at full intensity: white for inoperative in-
strument, yellow for caution level, and red for high level. A signal
is also generated by the module which causes a buzzer to sound. The
white lamp indication will remain until the condition causing the alarm
is cleared, at which time the lamp will return to the dim condition.
The red and amber lights will remain bright until they are manually reset
by a push button on the indicator module. If the indicator module is
reset when the alarm or abnormal condition still exists, the lamps will
momentarily become dim when the reset button is depressed and then will
become bright and the buzzer will sound again when the reset button is
released.

All indicator modules are identical and can be interchanged or re-
placed without alteration (see Fig. 2.9.6 for circuit details).
 

337

Coincidence Module

The coincidence module (ORNL model Q-2563-2) consists of one tran-
sistorized circuit which accepts a de shift voltage alarm signal from
as many as six indicator modules. The circuit can be adjusted by in-
ternal jumper connections to operate a relay for alarm or control pur-
poses on any combination of one to six input signals. All coincidence
modules at Building 7503 are arranged to operate the relay when there
is a coincidence of any two alarms from a selected group of instruments.
Each module is 35.8 mm wide, 120 mm high, and 125.8 mm deep. All con-
nections are made on printed strip connections at the rear edge of the
plug-in module.

Four selected air-monitor indicator modules are connected to a
coincidence module. Six selected monitron indicator modules are con-
nected to a separate coincidence module. When two or more monitron
indicator modules or two or more air-monitor indicator modules receive
high-level alarm signals, the associated coincidence module will actuate
the building warning and evacuation equipment and will transmit a signal
to the Emergency Control Center, Building 2500. A red lamp on the af-
fected coincidence module will indicate which set of instruments has de-
tected an abnormal condition.

When the indicator modules showing an sbnormeal condition are reset
manually, the coincidence module will also be reset.

Al] coincidence modules are identical and can be interchanged or
replaced without alteration, except for an internal jumper connection
which determines the number of coincidental input signals required for
an output signal (see Fig. 2.9.7 for the circuit schematic).

Relay Module

To alert the reactor operator, a relay in the relay module operates
an annunciator at the main control panel whenever the buzzer module
operates; that is, any alarm at the auxiliary panel also annunciates at
the operating position. The annunciator at the main control panel op-
erates in the same manner as all other Tigerman annunciators at that
point. To reset the annunciator, the operator must first silence the
buzzer at the suxiliary control panel.

Buzzer Module

The buzzer module (ORNL model Q-2563-4) consists of a transistorized
trigger circuit that operates a silicon controlled rectifier to actuate a
buzzer when a voltage shift pulse is received from an indicator module.
The buzzer module is the same size as all other modules and is interchange-
able with other buzzer modules (see Fig. 2.9.8 for the circuit schematic).

The buzzer module gives audible notice that an indicator module has
received any one of three input signals. The buzzer module, which serves
all indicator modules, is reset by a push button at the front of the
module. oo

After being reset, the buzzer will sound again whenever an input
signal is received by one of the indicator modules. For example, a
change from a normal condition to a "caution alarm level" at some location
will start the buzzer. After it is reset, a change to "high alarm level"
or to "inoperative instrument" will start the buzzer again.

 
 

338

Air Whistle and Beacon Lights

When a coincidence module has been energized by two or more monitrons
or air monitors, four air whistles are activated by nitrogen gas bottles
(one for each whistle) to notify the building occupants to leave the
building. The air whistle, a "Clarion whistle" by Westinghouse Air Brake
Company, will sound from 2 to 4 min on one filled gas bottle. A control
box for each whistle contains a pressure valve, pressure switches which
monitor tank and regulated pressures, and a solenoid valve that is opened
by an electrical signal from the coincidence module. A momentary signal
will open the solenoid valve, and the valve will remain open until it is
closed manually by pressing the mushroom head of the valve stem inward.
See Fig. 2.9.1 for the location of the whistles and Fig. 2.9.9 for the
control circuit schematic.

The normal gas pressures for proper operation of the whistles are
not less than 1000 psig tank pressure and 80 to 120 psig line pressure
to the solenoid valve. Abnormal pressures are indicated by red lamps
(labeled "horn trouble") on the central control panelboard, one lamp for
each whistle. A dim lamp indicates normal pressures, and a bright lamp
indicates abnormal pressures. Inspection of the gages will indicate
whether the tank pressure or the line pressure is abnormal.

Federal Sign and Signal Corporation model 27S 110-v beacons with
magenta-colored lenses are installed at 15 locations (Fig. 2.9.2) in
and around the reactor building complex and the office building to warn
personnel to evacuate the building. These beacons are actuated simul-
taneously with the air whistles by a signal from a coincidence module,
and they are automatically stopped when the coincidence module has re-
turned to a normal condition.

A key-operated switch, labeled "normal-disable," on the central
control panelboard may be used to disconnect the air whistles and beacons
during maintenance or abnormal operation periods. Since the Emergency
Control Center receives an alarm signal when the switch is moved to the
"disable" position, the Control Center should be notified before the
switch is set at this position.

A large red push button located on a module in the central control
panel, labeled "manual evacuate," actuates the air whistles and beacons
and transmits an alarm signal to the Emergency Control Center (if the
Center has not already received an alarm). Remote manual evacuation
switches are provided on the reactor control console and in the mainte-
nance control room. If one of the manual evacuation push buttons has
been used, the system may be restored to the normal condition by pressing
the "reset" push button on the "manual evacuate" module.

Power Supplies

The main power for the system is 120 v, 60 hertz, supplied from
instrument power panel 5 in Building 7503 to the 24-v dc power supply
and the monitoring instruments.

The 24-v dc transistorized power supply is a regulated voltage and
current unit. A green "power on" lamp on the control chassis and a neon
lamp on the power supply panel will be brightly lighted to indicate that
the power supplies are operating. Also a "dec failure relay" is used
which triggers an annunciator on the main control panel should the dec
power supply fail.

2.9.3 General System

2.9.3.1 Introduction

This part of the Health Physics Monitoring System consists of all
the instruments used for health physics purposes which are not included
in the Facility Radiation snd Contamination System. In general, these
instruments are for use by the area health physicists and for operating
personnel in conducting personal surveys of their bodies and clothes.
Included in this system are seven beta-gamma survey-type monitors, a
beta-gamma sample counter, an alpha sample counter, and a hand-and-foot
monitor. See Fig. 2.9.1 for location of these instruments.

2.9.3.2 Beta-Gamma Monitors, Q-2091

The beta-gammea monitors are mostly placed in contamination-free
areas to provide a means of personal survey of clothing and body. How-
ever, when not used for this purpose, they are left operating and serve
as backup monitors. for the monitrons. In four places (the cooling-water
equipment room, the hallway between. Buildings 7503 and 7509, the instru-
ment shop, and the venthouse) their Primary purpose is area monitoring.
They are used instead of the monitron because of the lower unit cost end
low area background expected. They provide a local aural alarm only
and are not tied to any central alarm system.

The Q-2091 monitor consists of a G-M tube and a count-rate meter
with integral power supply. The G-M tube has an adjustable beta shield
and is attached to the rate meter by a 3-ft length of coax cable.

 
 

 

340

The count rate meter (Q-2091) is of the duty-cycle, linear-scale
type. It includes an amplifier designed to accept the G-M beta-gamma
tube input. A high-voltage power supply, a high-level alarm circuit,
an aural monitor with volume control, and a l-ma full-scale output for
recorder or telemeter are included features. The unit weighs 19 1b and
is enclosed in a cabinet approximately 8 in. wide, 9 in. high, and 12
in. deep. It operates from 115 v, 60 hertz ac.

2.9.3.3 Hand-and-Foot Beta-Gamma Monitor, Q-1939-B

The hand-and-foot monitor is located in an area which serves as the
main entrance and exit from the reactor building (7503).

This instrument is an ac-powered four-channel monitor for beta-gamma
radiation with a channel for each hand, a channel for the shoes (feet),
and a channel with a movable probe. The probe is mounted approximately
waist high in order to monitor the front of clothes when not used for
special monitoring. Three channels are identical modular-constructed
units, actuated by & halogen-quenched stainless-wall G-M tube. The count-
ing rate is indicated by glow transfer scaler tubes and electrical reset
registers. The fourth channel, the survey probe, is an aural channel.
The count in this channel is not totalized. Maximum counting rate in the
probe channel is approximately 5000 counts/sec. To start the instrument,
a manual push button is depressed which energizes a timer, after which
the operation is automatic. The instrument resets itself, and there is
a 5-sec waiting period before the counting cycle starts, to give the user
 

341

time to get both hands in position for monitoring. The actual counting
period is 23 sec. The total cycle is 30 sec. The maximum count rate
per channel is approximately 250 counts/sec, and the input resolving
time per channel is approximately 200 psec. The instrument is contained
in a rack cebinet 68-3/8 in. high, 21-1/16 in. wide, and 220 in. deep.
A detachable base, 4 in. high, 18 in. long, and 21 in. wide, contains
the foot-monitoring assembly. The power requirements are 115 + 10 v,

60 hertz, 75 w, 0.7 amp. Operating temperature limits are O to

135°F. :

2.9.3.4 Beta and Alpha Sample Counters

The beta and alpha sample counters are located in the health physics
counting room at the north end of the reactor building.

Beta Sample Counting System, Q-2344-1

The Q-2344 beta counting system includes a Tracerlab end-window G-M
tube mounted in a vertical lead shield (ORNI~Q-2089). The lead shield
also contains a card sample holder. Attached to the shield is a pre-
amplifier and cable. The preamplifier signal is transmitted via this
céble to a decade scaler containing the high-voltage power supply (ORNL-
Q-2188-1), A timer is also included in this unit. The complete assembly
is usually mounted on a table or a laboratory bench.

Alpha Scintillation Counting System, Q-2345-1

This system uses a scintillation detector composed of a 2 x 2 Nal
crystal and a 2-in. photomultiplier tube (ORNI-Q-2287). The tube and
crystal are mounted in a housing which is attached to a smear or slide
sample holder. The system uses a preamplifier and the combined power
supply unit used for the beta sample counter (Q-2188). This system,
like the beta system, is mounted on a table or a laboratory bench.

2.10 PROCESS RADIATION MONITORS

2.10.1 Introduction

The process radiation monitoring system monitors radioactivity
levels in process pipelines, vessels, and operating components. This
system is distinct from the Health Physics Monitoring System, Sect. 2.9,
which is designed to warn personnel throughout the reactor area. Signals
from the process monitoring system detectors located on or near pipes and
components are used to produce alarm control signals and safety system
input signals when activity levels indicate abnormal conditions. These
monitors also provide information which indicates operating conditions of
various parts of the reactor system.

2.10.2 System Description

Two kinds of detectors are used in the process monitors, ion chambers
and Geiger-Mueller (G-M) tubes. The G-M tubes are used to monitor levels
up to 100 mr/hr. Three types of ion chambers are used. One is a stand-
ard, commercial Reuter-Stokes chamber (Fig. 2.10.1) used to cover a range
of 30 mr/hr to 300 r/hr. The second (Fig. 2.10.2) is an ORNL model Q-2818
and is used to cover a range of 100 mr/hr to 5 x 10% r/hr. The third
(Fig. 2.10.3) is a special high-level ion chamber used to cover a range
of 10° to 107 r/hr. This chamber is of special design to withstand the
high radiation intensity and temperature present in the reactor and drain-
tank cells during reactor power operation. It also has mineral-insulated
cables sheathed with stainless steel to satisfy the cell containment re-
quirements.

A typical G-M tube monitoring channel’ consists of an Anton 106C
G-M tube supplying the input signal to an ORNL model Q-1916 logarithmic
response gamma radiation monitor. This model Q-1916 instrument was de-
veloped to meet the requirements of most gamma radiation monitoring of
reactors and in-pile loop systems. It has been in use at ORNL since
1958. The G-M tube (Fig. 2.10.4) is enclosed in a stainless steel housing
less than 1 in. in diameter and 8 in. long, and it can be located up to
500 ft from the electronics. No preamplifier is used. The scale indica-
tion on the monitor is proportional to the logarithm of the radiation
level over a three-decade span. Full-scale indication is normally 100
mr/hr, but it can be increased to 1 r/hr by use of a different G-M tube
and by appropriate changes in the electronics. While the unit has a
normal range of 100 mr/hr, it can handle levels in excess of 100 r/hr
without impairing its alarm and control functions. The monitor provides
an upscale electronic alarm. The alarm level may be set at any point
over the readout range, and the alarm point may be read on the meter
while the setting is being made without tripping the alarm circuit. A
relay which is energized during normal in-limit operation provides the
alarm and control signals.

Figure 2.10.5 is a block diagram of a typical Q-1916 monitor, with
circuit details shown in Fig. 2.10.6. The G-M tube detector is operated
at 900 v, and the radiation level indicated is determined from the average
current through the tube rather than from the pulse rate. Radiation in-
tensity causes the tube to conduct. The voltage drop across a resistor
in series with the G-M tube provides the input signal to the averaging
filter. The filter's output, an analog signal, is fed to a dc amplifier
having a logarithmic response. The amplifier is used to drive the alarm
limit detector, panel meter, and recorder. The alarm limit detector
drives a DPDT relay which is used for alsrm and control signals.

The monitor is fabricated using modular construction; the Q-1916
monitor assembly contains three plug-in modules (Fig. 2.10.7), each of
which is a complete monitor. A single power supply (Fig. 2.10.8) for all
three modules is located along the back of the chassis. A single-channel
unit with integral power supply is also available. The Q-1916 monitor
was chosen because of its operating simplicity, availability, small de-
tector size, ease of monitor replacement, fast response, and fail-safe
features.

An E-H Research laboratories model 202 electrometer is used to
measure and indicate the signal produced by the ion chambers. This
electrometer incorporates a 5889 low-leakage input tube and double feed-
back. Negative feedback reduces the effect of cable and source capaci-
tance, thereby improving transient response; positive feedback reduces
the input capacitance at low frequencies and further extends electrometer
response. The seven input resistors from 10° ohms to 3 X 1012 ohms,
selectable in seven steps, provide a wide operating range. The elec-
trometer has an adjustable alarm set point on the front-panel meter. An
alarm reset button is provided to reset the instrument after an alarmed
condition has cleared. It contains a DPDT relay to provide alarm and
control signals and it produces an output signal scaled to drive a O-to-
10-mv recorder. A 150-v power supply is provided for chamber polarization.
Figures 2.10.9 and 2.10.10 are a front panel view of the electrometer and
the circuit schematic respectively.

Excluding the Chemical Processing Plant a total of 16 G-M tube
monitors and 12 ion chamber detectors are used for process monitoring at
the MSRE. A list of these monitors, their function, and their location
is shown in Table 2.10.1.

The column in Table 2.10.1 labeled "Number of Units and Type of
Coincidence Circuit" describes the number of complete monitor channels
at one location and how they are used to increase reliability. In a
one-of-two circuit, either monitor reaching the alarm set point initiates
the desired alarm or control action. If either monitor fails, the other
unit is still available to monitor the system and produce the required
action should it be required. With but one exception a failure of the
monitor power supply produces control and alarm signals as does any other
failure which causes the monitor response to appear like that caused by
a high radioactive level (see sect. 1.5). The one-of-two system is used
in those applications where the output control action can be tolerated
during an on-line test.

In the two-out-of-three coincidence systems, two monitors are re-
quired to produce an alarm or control action. This arrangement allows
Teble 2.10.1.

the monitors to be tested, channel by channel, without actuating the
final alarm and control or safety circuits. Each monitoring channel o/
can be tested completely up to and including the alarm light and the

alarm and control relay in the module. The two-out-of-three coincidence

arrangement is used where maintenance and on-line testing of any single

channel must be accomplished without producing control action and where

false output control action caused by a failure or malfunction of a

single channel is highly undesirable.

All the detectors, except the high-level ones in the reactor and
drain-tank cells and the radiator pit, are capable of being tested with
a radiation source. A %0Co source is used to test each location.

In areas where substantial background radiation exists, the low-
level detectors are provided with lead shields (Fig. 2.10.11). Shielding
reduces the background and improves the signal-to-noise ratio, thus pre-
venting spurious slarms from a rise in activity level at another lo-
cation. These shields consist of lead sheet formed into the required
shape or of concentric lead-filled pipes. The shields are designed? to
facilitate the replacement of detectors and are built with access holes
to accept a radiation source for calibrating and testing the monitors.

No shields or test sources are provided for the high-level ion
chambers since their operating range is in the neighborhood of 10° r/hr.
The high-level chambers are mounted at selected locations in the reactor
and drain-tank cells. Three chambers are located near the wall of the
reactor cell, one at elevation 844.5 ft, one at elevation 838.5 ft, and
one directly over the reactor to measure control rod drive dose. Two
of the three chambers in the drain-tank cells are mounted on the walls,
and a third is mounted between the two fuel tanks on the thermocouple oO
tray.

The chambers are filled with nitrogen, employ alumina insulators,
and are built with mineral-insulated signal and high-voltage cables.

The chamber is 7-7/8 in. long and 1-1/16 in. in diameter. The chamber
sensitivity is 4 x 10713 amp r~! hr; 98% saturation is obtained in a
field of 107 r/hr with 350 v applied.

Only one chamber is monitored at a time. This is done by using a
single electrometer and a six-position selector switch. The selector
switch connects the signal from any selected chamber to the electrometer.
Two high-voltage power supplies are used, each supplying 350 v to three
chambers.

All the process monitoring electronic instruments except those used
with the sampler-enricher system and the pump lube oil tanks are mounted
in nuclear boards 4 and 5.2 The other detectors are mounted in panels
associated with their respective systems. To obtain the required
reliability for the monitoring system, the ac input power to the monitors
is obtained from the 25-kva emergency power system. In addition, in the

one-out-of-two monitor system, each channel has its own separate power
bus, providing added operating reliability.

With the exception of the six high-level, in-cell monitors, all
monitor outputs are transmitted to the data system for alarm detection
and logging. Each monitor is provided with an individual alarm indica-
tion. In addition, the alarm signal from each monitor station is trans-
mitted to annunciators in the auxiliary control room. These annunciator

signals are interconnected and transmitted to a single annunciator in
the main control room, labeled "Process Radiation Monitors."

2.11 STACK MONITORING SYSTEM
2.11.1 Introduction

The MSRE stack monitoring system monitors the MSRE off-gas for ab-
normally high radiation levels in the 100-ft-high off-gas stack. The
level of activity of the gas emitted from the stack is recorded on in-
struments located in the reactor auxiliary control room and by the com-
puter data logger. Abnormally high levels of activity generate an sural
and visual alarm in the reactor control room and in the Laboratory Waste
Monitoring Control Center located in Building 3105.

All hot-cell ventilation, some building ventilation, and all waste
gas (off-gas from process vessels and experiments) at ORNL are monitored
and discharged through one of several stacks. This section describes the
principal features of the MSRE stack monitoring system. This stack is
the main disposal facility for gaseous waste at the MSRE.! Cell ventila-
tion air (nigh flow, low contamination) makes up the bulk of the air flow;
reactor off-gas (Low flow, high contamination) is also disposed through
this facility. Filtering equipment consisting of multilayer fiber glass
roughing and absolute filters (see Fig. 1.5.10) is also located near the
stack. These filters are, in general, a second line of defense, since
all air and gas is cleaned near its source by the use of particle traps
and charcoal beds before entering the roughing filters.?l

All continuous waste effluent monitoring systems at ORNL feed in-
formation to panelboards at the Waste Monitoring Control Center located
in Building 3105.2 The information is displayed by signal lights indi-
cating alarm conditions or by records on single-point or multipoint
strip-chart recorders.

2.11.2 System Description

The basic concept of stack monitoring installations divides the
channels of information into two functional parts. One part provides
day-to-day information necessary to arrive at monthly and quarterly in-
ventories of radionuclides emitted from the stack. The other part pro-
vides a continuous surveillance of the minute-to-minute condition of the
stack inventory in order to sound an alarm if an unusual burst of activity
occurs.

The function of this second part of the system, in addition to pro-
viding an early warning of unusual conditions, is to provide gross in-
formation about the incident useful in locating the source and in assisting
all emergency groups involved to evaluate the extent of the incident. At
present there are five channels of information available from the MSRE
stack to meet these requirements. All the primary instrumentation for

scription of Reactor Design, ORNL-TM-728 (to be issued).

Nucl. Safety 6(4), 41420 (Summer 1965).

these channels is located on a balcony 40 ft up the stack, with the in- )
dicating instruments located in the reactor building (Fig. 2.11.1). w
These information channels are given below.

2.11.,2.1 Flow Channel FT-S1

A Pitot tube in the stack at the 40-ft level continuously measures
the total flow of air in the stack (approximately 18,000 cfm). This
measurement provides surveillance to detect unusual changes in air flow.
The flow date are also required, to calculate the average concentrations
of material passing through the stack. The stack flow rate is recorded
by the data-logger and printed on the hourly log.

2.11.2.2 In-Stack Sampler

An in-stack sampler is located at the 40~ft level. This sampler col-
lects a sample from the air stream by means of a cartridge with an inte-
gral filter and a charcoal trap (Fig. 2.11.2). Isokinetic sampling is
attempted, and the cartridge is removed once a day routinely for counting
room analysis and would be removed and replaced as often as necessary
during an incident or any unusual situation.

2.11.2.3 Particulate Monitors

Beta-Gamma Monitor, RE-S1A

 

A sample is continuously withdrawn from the stack stream at the 40-
ft level and passed through a filter paper which is monitored by a G-M
tube. The buildup of beta-gamma-emitting particulates provides the first
clue as to the physical form and characteristic radiation of contamination.
Exit gas from this monitor is sent to the 3'I monitor (refer to 2.11.2.4
below).

Alpha Monitor, RE-S1B

 

A similar device monitors the stack stream for alpha activity. Exit
gas from the alpha monitor is returned to the stack.

2.11.2.4 Iodine Monitor, RE-S1C (Fig. 2.11.3)

After pessing through the paper filter of the beta-gamma monitor
(sect. 2.11.2.3), the gaseous sample passes through a charcoal trap at
ambient temperature; here it is monitored by G-M tubes. The charcoal
bed receives the sample free of particulates and detects iodine and
other materials, such as tellurium, in volatile gaseous form. These
gases are poorly trapped by the preceding filter; 1317 is the contaminant
usually detected, thus explaining the name, iodine monitor. A second
clue as to the physical form and identification of stack gas material
is, therefore, provided by this channel.

A sample of stack air is constantly pumped through the heta-gamma
monitor RE-S1A at 2 cfm by a Roots blower. A 2-1/2- by 1l-in. section ow
 

369

of filter-paper tape catches better than 90% of the particulate matter
of greater than 0.3 pu size which passes, and any radiation of sufficient
energy is detected by a G-M tube. The paper used is Whatman No. 4 and
is in rolls 3 in. wide and 145 ft long. No regulation of air flow is

provided. Since the filter is changed at least every 8 hr, the air flow
remains reasonably constant at the blower-rated flow of 2 cfm. A pres-
sure switch in the intake air line is held closed during operation and
sounds an alarm in Building 3105 if there is a blower failure. The sample
is collected inside a stainless steel shield that provides approximately
2 in. of metal in all directions except where an opening is necessary
to admit air and tape. A mica end-window G-M tube (Lionel Electronic
Laboratories type 210T) is used as the detector. Window thickness is
1.4 to 2 mg/cm nominal and will pass beta particles of energies down

to 35 kev. Since stack gas may contain practically any isotope, good
energy sensitivity is required.

Details of the assembled filter, detector, and shield are on In-
strumentation and Controls Division Dwg. Q-2325-5. The design of this
assembly allows the filter tape to be advanced by a 24-v dec signal from
the control center in Building 3105 and also includes broken tape detec-
tion before and after the shield. If the filter-paper tape breaks or
runs out, it cannot be advanced, and an alarm signal is sounded in Build-
ing 3105. A method of calibration is described in ref. 3. The tape as-
sembly is based on the ORNL Q-2118 design used in the standard Q-2240
constant air monitors except that the intake portion has been altered
to allow easier disassembly for decontamination (see Instrumentation and
Controls Division Dwg. Q-2218-1 for details). Also, the air intake di-
ameter has been altered to match the sample probe and to reduce the number
of diameter changes in the sampling line.

At the time of installation, isokinetic sampling conditions were ap-
proximated by estimating the flow, assuming 2-cfm sample volume and sizing
the sample pipe accordingly. In addition, the end of the pipe was sharp-
ened, placed close to the center of the stack, and headed into the air
stream. The number of degrees of turn between the pipe entry and the
filter were minimized, and all pipe bends were at the maximum allowable
radius. All piping is of stainless steel except for a small section of
plastic tubing where flexibility is needed. The sample is taken approxi-
mately ten diameters downstream from the input to the stack.

The G-M tube is connected with RG59/U coaxial directly to the indi-
cating instrument located in Building 7503. The cable runs are in con-
duit, and lengths are typically 100 to 250 ft. The indicating instrument
(RI-S1A) is a Q-2313 count rate meter with a current-sensitive input end
is located in nuclear panel board 5 (NB5) in the auxiliary control room.
The current-sensitive input allows the signal and high voltage for the
G-M tube to be put on the coaxial cable without using preamplifier at the
G-M tube. The count-rate meter chassis also holds the +HV supply, an
audio output, a Rustrak recorder, and a panel meter. Range and time
constant switchings are manual. The count-rate meter ranges are 0-250,

0-500, 0-10,000, and 025,000 counts/min. Damping time constants are 1,
11, and 22 sec. In addition to display by the rate meter and recorder,
the beta-gamma level is also checked for alarms recorded by the computer-
logger and output once a shift on the 8-hr log. The signal to the logger
is 0 to 10 mv and is obtained from the output of the ratemeter.

The alpha monitor (RI-S1B) is similar to the beta-gamma particulate
monitor. The stack-gas sample is withdrawn by means of a separate sample
ripe at the 40-ft level. The 2-cfm sample is drawn through a filter tape
deck, as with the beta-gamms monitor, by a Roots blower. In this monitor,
however, the radiation detector is a thallium-actuated zinc sulfide screen
(see Instrumentation and Controls Division Dwg. Q-2218-5 for details).
The area viewed is 1-5/8-in. in diameter (2 in.2), and the detector is on
the top (intake) side of the filter tape to avoid absorption of alpha
particles by the filter paper. No shielding is necessary owing to the
low sensitivity of the screen to beta-gamma radiation. The indicating
instrument, a Q-2313 count rate meter labeled RE-S1B, is located in the
same panel as the beta-gamma rate meter. The alpha level is also moni-
tored for alarm condition, recorded by the logger-computer, and output
on the 8-hr log.

After leaving the beta-gamma particulate monitor, the gas is passed
through the model Q-2725 iodine monitor detector RE-S1C (Fig. 2.11.3) and
returned to the stack. A charcoal trap, made of a disposable plastic
bottle and containing 6-14 mesh coconut charcoal about 3 in. in depth,
is used to trap *3I (and other materials such as tellurium that adsorb
on charcoal). The trap, placed within a standard 2-in.-thick lead shield
(Q-1907-15), is monitored by four Lionel 106C G-M tubes. The air flow
is 2 cfm, and the measured cross-sectional flow area of the charcoal bed
is 5.41 in.2. From curves given in ORNL-2872, the pressure drop is ap-
proximated at 2 in. H20 or less, and the air velocity is 55 fpm. The
decontamination factor is estimated from the above report to be 103 or
better. As a rough rule of thumb, 6-14 mesh charcoal will collect 90%
of 131 per inch, so that the high concentration is at the upstream face
of the charcoal. Data presented in the report are for velocities of 200
fpm and less. Actually the charcoal is easily recoverable and can be
used for analysis since the trap is easily replaced. When sensitivity
is too great, the number of G-M tubes can be reduced. About 75 g of
charcoal is used in each trap.

The output of the G-M tubes (operated in parallel) is connected by
RG59/U coaxial cable to the input of a Q-2313 count-rate meter (RI-S1C)
located in NB5 in the auxiliary control room. The 10-mv output of the
rate meter is transmitted to the data-logger, which prints out the iodine
level on the 8-hr log.

The collected material is monitored by a halogen-filled G-M tube
(Lionel 106C) which has a 30-mg/cm? wall that excludes all heta energies
below about 300 kev. The G-M tube also sees inert and volatile gases
which are not collected by the filter paper. These show as only a rise
in count rate on the recorder for the time of their passage through the
monitor. Iodine-131 will collect on the filter paper but with very low
efficiency, depending on the stack conditions and the physical form of
the iodine.

Inert gas such as 85Kr will be seen in both the particulate and
1317 channels for the duration of its presence in the stack flow. It
 

371

will not collect to any extent on the filter or the charcoal. While
some adsorption on the charcoal has been noted, collection and retention
are very poor at ambient temperatures.

As can be seen, particulate matter is immediately identifiable since
it is collected by the beta-gamma monitor filter before it reaches the
iodine monitor.

Jodine-131 will cause a long-term (8-day half-life) buildup on the
charcoal; inert gas can be identified since it shows on both channels
in a transient rather than an integrated manner.

As stated previously, the indicating instruments for the stack
monitors are located in NBS in the auxiliary control room (Fig. 2.11.1).
The indicating instruments consist of the three rate meters with the
integral recorders for the three monitor channels, beta-gamma, alpha,
and iodine, plus the alarm detection and display circuitry for the three
channels. The alarm detection equipment provides a local annunciation
of the alarm from any of the detection channels and transmits the alarm
signal to the Waste Monitoring Control Center in Building 3105. Figure
2.11.4 1s the functional block diagram of the system.

The alarm-detection equipment consists of three transistorized
switches which operate two alarm relays, a buzzer, and a lamp, all pow-
ered by a 24-v dc power supply. The equipment, except for the power
supply, is mounted on modular cards located in an integral panel (Fig.
2.11.5). The modular card panels are slightly modified, but the eircuits
are identical with those used in the Health Physics Monitoring System
(Sect. 2.9). The three alarm switches are actuated from signals derived
from the three rate meters. See Fig. 2.9.6, Sect. 2.9, for a schematic
of the switch circuit. Any channel in an alarmed condition will cause
the appropriate alarm switch to trip, which turns the alarm lamp "On"
on the switch, turns on a local buzzer (Fig. 2.9.8, Sect. 2.9), actuates
a local annunciator, turns on a local alarm lamp, and actuates a relay
all through the action of the alarm module (Fig. 2.9.7, Sect. 2.9), which
also trips the stack monitor alarm in the Waste Monitoring Control Center
also. The alarm for each channel is set by the contact meter on each
rate meter. Once a channel is in the alarmed state, the alarm will con-
tinue until the signal has decreased below the alarm set point, the in-
dividual alarm switch is reset, and the common buzzer is reset. There
is an additional module, called the remote alarm relay module (Fig. 2.11.5),
which trips an annunciator in the main control room should the 24-v dec
power supply fail. See the ORNL Q-2563 series of drawings listed in Sect.
2.11.3 for details on the transistorized alarm circuitry. See Fig. 2.11.6
for the operational schematic and elementary diagram of the beta-gamma,
alpha, and iodine monitors.

2.12 DATA LOGGER-COMPUTER

2.12.1 Introduction

A digital data collecting and computing system is used on the MSRE
to augment the conventional instrumentation system (Figs. 2.12.1 and
2.12.2). It is designed to collect and process 350 analog and 112 on-
off contact signals (at present it processes only 291 analog signals).
The remaining signals can be added by merely wiring in the signal leads
and altering the system program. Signal processing includes conversion
of the analog signals to digital values in engineering units; alarm
monitoring by comparing the signals against preset upper and lower
alarm limits; and calculations to provide heat balances, total power,
reactivity, and other operational and analytical information. These
digital values may be logged on typewriters, displayed by a digital
lamp unit, or recorded on magnetic tape, at the system operator's option.

2.12.2 Basic System Equipment Description

The system consists of a Bunker-Ramo model 340 digital computer,
operating console, analog and digital input-output cabinets, typewriters,
x-y plotter, digital display lamp bank, and two magnetic tape unitst
(Fig. 2.12.3).

The analog input-output equipment is housed in three 23- by 84-in.
cabinets (Fig. 2.12.4). These cabinets contain four dc amplifiers, an
input signal multiplexer composed of mercury wetted contact relays, an
analog-to-digital converter, a thermocouple reference unit, power
supplies, and the input-output terminals with associated filters and
signal conditioning circuits. The dec amplifiers and the converter were
manufactured by the Redcor Corporation, Canoga Park, California. The
analog signals from the process instruments are transmitted by signal
leads to the first two cabinets, where they are scanned by the multi-
plexer, then amplified, digitized, and transmitted to the computer
memory.

The analog input system is designed to handle analog input signals
ranging from millivolts dec to 220 v de or ac.122 The lower-level sig-
nals are amplified to 10 v dc, while the higher-level dc signals are
attenuated to the 10~-v range and ac signals are rectified before at-
tenuation.

The analog input signals are transmitted to the input terminals
and then through 60-cycle noise filters before reaching the input

multiplexer. These filters have a manually set variable 60-cycle re-
jection of from 6 to 50 db. They are mounted on plug-in cards in the OU
two analog input cabinets. In addition, digital filtering (integration)

is applied to selected input signals, most of which are thermocouple

signals used in precise calculations. The analog-to-digital converter

operates on a O- to 10-v dc range. All analog signals are converted to

digital values on this basis, with the proper scaling done under program

control. Digital signals are compared with preset alarm limits and can

be selectively transmitted to digital-to-analog converters to produce

up to 36 analog signals for recorders, oscillographs, an x-y plotter,
or for control.

Three cabinets, indicated as I/O Nos. 1 to 3 in Fig. 2.12.4, house
the digital input/output equipment. This equipment handles the contact
input signals from relays, typewriters, and the input keyboard and
contains the control units for all the output devices, The contact in-
put signals are transmitted to the arithmetic and control unit of the
computer to perform operations under computer program control. The
digital output signals from the arithmetic and control unit are trans-
mitted through the digital input-output unit to operate relays, type-
writers, and the digital lamp display unit.

The computer consists of the basic digital computer, the master
input/output control unit, and the memory units. The computer con-
taining the basic electronics is housed in three labeled cabinets,
central processor, core memory, and drum memory (Fig. 2.12.4). Input/out-
put is housed in one cabinet labeled Master I/O.

The basic 340 computer has all-solid-state circuitry with the fol=-

lowing specifications. ( )

2.12.3 Peripheral Equipment Description

Aside from the computer itself and the analog input and output
subsystems, there are a number of peripheral devices which provide
communication between the operators and the machine. The devices are
listed below and can be seen in Fig. 2.12.1.

Four typewriters: two with 30-in. carriage
and two with 16-in. carriage

Two magnetic-tape units
Paper-tape punch, reader
Input keyboard
- x=-y plotter
Console: function matrix and digital display

In normal operation, four IBM typewriters are used to provide
hard-copy records of reactor data (see Fig. 2.12.4 for location of the
typewriters). Two 30-in.-carriage typewriters are used to record es-
sentially all logs and calculation results. The periodically appearing
results are all typed on one device on preprinted forms; results of
demanded operations are typed on the second typewriter. One of the two
l16-in.-carriage typewriters is installed in the reactor control room to

 
 

382

record alarm conditions associated with analog signals and calculation
results. The second 16-in. typewriter (console) records all operations
performed at the computer console.

The principal depository for reactor data is magnetic tape. The
values of all the analog signals are stored on magnetic tape every 5
min. In addition, all intermediate and final calculation results are
stored on tape. (The typeout of calculation results is generally less
frequent and more limited in extent.) Two tape drives (IBM model 729-2)
are available, with the second unit normally in standby. However, the
second unit can be used for off-line functions such as data processing
or program development while the first unit is on line.

The paper-tape punch and reader (Teletype model BPRE-2 and Digi-
tronics model 2500 respectively) are used primarily in connection with
programming functions, for example, assembly and compiling. There is
normally no input or output of reactor information through these devices.

The input keyboard (Invac model PK-164) operates in conjunction
with the on-line program development package (OLPD) in the computer.
From the standpoint of reactor operation, it is the means of entering
data for the trend logging and plotting functions.

The x-y plotter (Moseley type 2D2) is capable of plotting any
input variable as a function of time or of any other input variable.
Parameters for both coordinate axes must be entered by the operator.

The computer console is the focal point for use of the computer by
the reactor operators. It contains the function matrix as well as the
digital switches for the selection of the various request functions.
The console also houses the panel for digital display of signal values
(Fig. 2.12.5).

2.12.4 System Operation

2.12.4.1 Collection and Processing of Analog and Digital Input Signals

At the present time there are 291 analog signals from the reactor
system connected to the computer. The types and numbers of signals
are summarized in Table 2.12.1.3?% See Fig. 2.12.6 for a complete list
of all input signals. These signals are arranged in a scan table that
contains 350 entries. Under normal conditions the raw analog signals
for all 350 points are scanned, compared with high and low alarm limits,
and stored in core once each 5 sec,

In order to provide a more frequent look at selected variables,
some analog signals appear at several points in the table. For instance,
the outputs of the three neutron safety channels are arranged so that
one of the signals is read every 200 msec. Another reason for multiple
entry in the scan table is to permit integration (digital filtering

over 1/60 sec) of the signal for greater accuracy and resolution. Tem~
peratures that are used in calculations are integrated and converted to
the nearest 0.1°F in the range from 900 to 1300°F. Thus, the signal
must appear a second time, unintegrated, to provide information over
the entire operating range. As a result of these multiple appearing
signals, the 350-entry scan table contains 346 actual analog signals
with four spare locations.

Realistic high and/or low process limits are imposed on most of
the analog signals. In the remaining cases the limits are set at the
instrument extremes. The normal computer response to an out-of-limits
condition is to actuate the logger annunciator in the main control room
and to print a message on the control-room typewriter identifying the
varisble, its value, and the time. Such a message is typed in red when
the variable first goes out of limits and in black when it returns
within limits. No other information (except for a 4-hr out-of-limits
log) is typed while the signal is either out of or within limits.

There is one group of 65 analog signals (type 2) that is recorded
on magnetic tape, in engineering units, each 5 sec while any one of the
signals is out of limits. The typed messages for this group of variables
are similar to those for the other signals. The recording function can
be inhibited by operator request on any or all of the signals that will
produce this action. :

An out-of-limits condition on any one of another group of 22 analog
signals (for instance, neutron flux) switches the computer to a "fast
scan" mode of operation. In this mode the scan table is reduced to 64

 
 

384

important variables and all 64 are scanned, converted to engineering
units, and stored on magnetic tape once each 1/4 sec. This mode of
operation continues for 1 min, without 1imit checking, after its ini-
tiation. At the end of that minute the normal scan is resumed until
another signal to start "fast scan" is detected. The "fast scan" mode
of operation can also be inhibited by operator request on any or all
of the signals that will produce it.

Once each 5 min, regardless of the scanning mode, all 350 signals
are read, converted to engineering units, and stored on magnetic tape.

2.12.4.2 logging Functions

The computer generates and types out a number of periodic logs,
which are tabulated below:

1-hr log (54 analog signals)

8-hr log (175 analog signals)
Daily report (21 parameters)
Out-of-limits log (once every 4 hr)
Calculation results

The 1- and 8-hr logs simply present the values of selected analog sig-
nals to record the status of the system. In both cases the values that
are printed are the same as those that were recorded on magnetic tape
during the last 5-min taping operation. The daily report summarizes a
number of operating parameters such as integrated power, time at tem-
perature, and numbers of thermal cycles on important components. The
out-of-limits log is an hourly summary of all analog signals (up to 40)
that are out of limits at that time along with their current values.
Selected results of some calculations, such as the average reactor in-
let and outlet temperature, are also typed on the log sheet periodically.

2.12.4.3 Calculations

Aside from the routine functions, such as units conversion, the
computer performs a number of on-line calculations using current reactor
data. 4% Many of these calculations include alarm functions to call at-
tention to abnormal conditions. The calculations are normally performed
on a periodic basis with the results being printed usually less fre-
quently. Many of the calculations can be performed at nonscheduled
times on operator demand; results of nonscheduled calculations are al-
ways printed.

Table 2.12.2 summarizes the schedule for some of the major calcu-
lations.

2.12.4.4 Miscellaneous Functions

Some of the miscellaneous functions that are, or can be, performed
by the computer are listed below.

Trend log (up to 26 variables)
Trend plot

Digital display

Contact and analog outputs
On-line program development (OLPD)
Data retrieval and processing

General-purpose computing

The first three items, trend log, trend plot, and digital display,

are means of providing visual information for operator guidance. The
variables to which these functions are applied can be selected at will
by the operators. The last three items in this list are all related in
that they are nominally off-line functions that can be performed with
the computer on line. The system program requires only about 30% of the
capability of the computer under normal circumstances; this utilization
increases to about 40% in the "fast scan" mode of operation. In ad-
dition, the system program requires only about two-thirds of the core
memory. Thus, there is ample capability for background processing of
off-line material. :

The purpose of the computer is to provide close surveillance,
rapid processing, and compact storage of large amounts of reactor data.
Since it is associated with a reactor experiment, it is not possible to
define all the data and calculations that are required for a complete
analysis of the system. Therefore a great deal of data are being col-
lected which may be used much later or which may never be used.

2.13 MSRE Beryllium Monitoring System®

Atmospheric beryllium concentration is monitored by 15 air sampling
stations located at strategic places throughout the reactor building. The
beryllium content of the air is monitored by drawing air through filter
papers which are then collected and analyzed for beryllium content.

The radiator air stack air is monitored by an arc spectrograph. Air
is drawn through the spectrograph for a set period and then analyzed by
the light spectrographic method. The result of the analysis is printed
on a recorder located in the spectrograph cabinet.

The spectrograph is equipped with a manual switch so that the coolant
cell can be monitored during reactor maintenance operations.
