FOREWORD

The Subcommittee on Radiochemistry is one of a number of
subcommittees working under the Committee on Nuclear Science
within the National Academy of Sclences = Nationel Research
Council. Its members represent government, industrial, and
university laboratorles in the areas of nuclear chemistry and
analytical chemistry.

The Subcommittee has concerned itself with those areas of
nuclear science which involve the chemist, such as the collec-
tlon and distribution of radiochemical procedures, the estab-
lishment of specifications for radiochemically pure reagents,
the problems of stockpiling unconteminated materials, the
availability of cyclotron time for service irradiations, the
place of radlochemistry in the undergraduate college program,
etc.

This series of monogrephs has grown cut of the need for
up-to-date compilations of radiochemicel information and pro-
cedures. The Subcommittee has endeavored to present a series
which will be of maximum use to the worlkdng sclentist and
which contains the latest availeble information. Each mono-
graph collects In one volume the pertinent information required
for radiochemical work with an indlvidual element or a group of
closely related elements.

An expert in the radiochemistry of the particular element
has written the monograph, following a standard format developed
by the Subcommittee. The Atomic Energy Commission has sponsored
the printing of the series.

The Subcommittee 1s confident these publications will be
useful not only to the radiochemist but also to the research
worker in other fields such as physics, blochemistry or medicine
who wishes to use radiochemical techniques to solve a specific
problem.

INTRODUCTION

This volume which deals with the radiochemistry of thorium
is one of a series of monographs on radiochemistry of the elements.
There is included a review of the nuclear and chemical features
of particular interest to the radiochemist, a discussion of prob-
lems of dissolution of a sample and counting techniques, and
finally, a collection of radiochemical procedures for the element
as found in the literature.

The series of monographs will cover all elements for which
radiochemical procedures are pertinent. Plans include revision
of the monograph periodically as new techniques and procedures
warrant. The reader is therefore encouraged to call to the
attention of the author any published or unpublished material
on the radiochemistry of thorium which might be included in a
revised version of the monograph.

IV. REVIEW OF THOSE FEATURES OF THORIUM CHEMISTRY OF CHIEF
INTEREST TO RADIOCHEMISTS

1. Metallic Thorium

Thorium metal is highly electropositive and its preparation is a matter
of no mean difficulty. Methods which are used for this purpose include re-
duction of thorium oxide with calcium, reduction of thorium tetrachloride or
tetrafluoride or tetrachloride by calcium, magnesium or sodium or electrolysis
of fused salts. Thorium metal has a high melting point (1750° C) and is
highly reactive in the molten state. The potential of the thorium-thorium (IV)
couple has been estimated as + 1.90 volts.t A fresh surface of thorium tar-
nishes rapidly in alr and the finely divided metal is pyrophoric. The pres-
ence of oxygen and possibly of nitrogen and other light element impurities
on the surface of thorium can be a matter of some importance in some experi-
ments in nuclear chemistry or physics where thin foils of thorium are employed
as targets.

The reaction of thorium metal with aqueous mineral acids has some features
of great interest to radiochemiets. Dilute hydrofluoric acld, nitric meid,
sulfuric acid and concentrated phosphoric acid or perchloric acid attack mas-
sive thorium metal slowly. Concentrated nitric acid renders thorium passive
but the addition of fluoride ion ceuses the dissolution to continue. In the
dissolution of small thorlum targets, 1t is found that concentrated HNO, con-
taining 0.01 molar (rm), SiF, (or HF) makes a good solvent mixture. The sol-
vent should be added in batches with heating and stirring in between rather
than all at once, Hydrochloric acid attacks thorium vigorously but a mysteri-
ous black or blue-black residue remains on completion of the reaction. As
mich as 25 percent of the original metal may be converted to the black solid
by either dilute or concentrated hydrochloric acid. Most or all of this resl-
due can be dissolved by adding fluoride ion in small corcentration to the

hydrochloric acid. The black résidue may be ThO or it may be a hydride REG:
For a further discussion of this material see Katzin , James and Strsumanis”,
and Katz end Seaborg*.

Thorium oxide targets can also be dissolved by a mixture of hydrochloric
acid plus (mm, ), BiF¢ or of nitric acid plus (WH, ),BiF¢. A good discussion of
the fluoride ion catalyzed disaolution of thorium metal or thorium dioxide is

given by Schuler, Steahly and Stoughton.'®

2. Soluble Salts of Thorium
8ince thorium exists in solution as a comparatively small highly charged
cation, it undergoes extensive interaction with water and with many anions.
There 1s one great simplification in the agueous chemistry of thorium in that 1t
has only one oxidation state gnd hence oxlidation-reduction reactions do not
need to be considered.

The water soluble salts of thorium include the nitrate, the sulphate, the
chloride ard the perchlorate.

3. Insoluble Balts of Thorium-Precipitation and Coprecipltation Character-
istics of thorium

The common insoluble compounds of thorium are listed in Table 1. An
inspection of the table suggests a number of precipitates which may Le sultable
for the removal of tracer emounts of thorium from solution. Good descriptions
of the insoluble compounds of thorium and thelr use in analysis are glven in the
general references listed in Part I.

Thorium hydroxide is a highly insoluble compound forming a gelatinous pre=-
clpitate when alkall or ammonium hydroxide 1s added to an aqueous solution of
ett, It 1s not amphoteric. Thorium hydroxide dissolves in aqueous solutions
containing ions such as citrate, carbonate, or sulfosalleylie acid which
complex thorium ion. Tracer amounts of thorium will coprecipitate quantitetive-
ly with a wide variety of insoluble hydroxides; lanthamumm, ferric snd zircon-

lum hydroxide bave been used. Since hydroxide carrier precipitates are notori-
ously non-specific, they should be counted on only to remove thorium from a
simple mixture of contaminants or as a group separation to be followed by more
specific chemical purification steps. In some of the classical studies of the
uranium series’ ux, (T?3%) was separated from uranium by precipitating ferric
hydroxide and ammonium uranate together and leaching the uranium from the pre-
cipitate with ammonium carbonate.

Thorium peroxide forms when hydrogen peroxide is added to a dilute miner-
al acid containing thorium. It is highly insoluble. The formula is often
glven es Thy0- but recent investigations suggest that anions are incorporated
into the solld as integral components. The precise formula of the precipitate
varies with the condltions of precipitation. The physical form is aleo greatly
different depending on the acidity’? when precipitated from a neutral solu-
tion it 1s gelatinous and contains many coprecipltated anions; when precipitated
from & slightly basic solution, it 1s not so gelatinous and has & lower perox-
ide content; when formed in an acid solution, it is opaque and readily flltered.
Insoluble peroxide compounds are rare in the Periodic System so that preciplta-
tion of thorium peroxide can provide clean separation of thorium from most other
elements. Plutonium (IV) forme & peroxide similar to that of thorium (IV). Other
(IV) state elements such as cerium (IV) and zirconium (IV) also form such in-
soluble peroxides. Uranium (IV) and neptunium (IV) also form insoluble precipi-
tates upon the addition of peroxide, but these seem to be of a ascmewhat differ-
ent type than those formed by thorium and plutonium. These peroxide precipil-
tates are readily dissolved by the addition of reagents such as Sn(II), I,
Muop or Ce(IV) which can destroy peroxide. For a more camplete discussion of
the peroxide and for references to the original literature, see Katz and Sea-
vore®.

Lanthamm Flupride as Carrier for Thorium. Thorium will coprecipltate
quantitatively with lantharmm precipitated as the fluoride from strongly acidic
solutions. Thie 18 a very useful method for the separation of small amounts of

5
thorium from uranium solutions. The fluoride may be converted to the hydroxide
by direct metathesis with alkall hydroxide pellets or strong elkall solutions,
or it may be dissolved in an eluminum nitrate-nitric acid aclution (which
thoroughly complexes the fluoride ion) and then be precipitated as the hydroxide.
The coprecipitation of rare earth impurities is, of course, complete. Zircon=-
ium and barium in trace concentrations are carried but, if milligrem quantities
of these elements are added as "hold-back carriers", no coprecipitation is ob-
served. Hence coprecipitation wlth lanthanum fluoride serves as an excellent
method of freeing thorium from the zirconlum carrier used 1n a previous step.
An alternate method would be the removal of zirconium on an anion exchange
resin from an 8-10 molar solution of hydrochloric acid.

Other lmeoluble fluorides may serve as carriers for trace amounts of thor-
ium.

Zirconium Jodate as Carrier. Zirconium in a concentration of 0.1 to 1.0
“mg/ml may be precipitated as the iodate from a strongly acidic solution to
carry thorium nearly quentitatively. The iodate concentration is not critical.

 

Elements which form insoluble lodates are also coprecipitated, but many, such
as uranium, are separated. The rare earths and actinium are decontaminated if
the preclpitation is from a strongly acidic solution and the precipitate is
washed with an iodate containing solution. Under conditions of low acidity
and low total ionic strength, the carrylng of these elements may be gulte high,
as shown for actinium by McLane and Peterson’. If cerium is present it is
necessary to reduce Ce(IV) to Ce(III) with some sulteble reducing agent such as
hydrogen peroxide, before precipitation.

The zirconium lodate may be dissolved in nitric acid contalning sulfur
dioxide or some other reducing agent, and the zirconium may be repreclpitated
as the hydroxide after the solution is boiled to remove iodine.

Hagemann and his co-workers® applied this method to thelr study of the
isotope Th229 in the 4n + 1 series. Their procedure is reproduced in Proced-
ure 16 of Section V below. Ballow used 1t as a means of substituting zircon-
lum carrier for rare earth carrier after an initial lenthanum fluoride precipi-
tation. See Procedure 13 in Section V below.

Phosphate Precipitates. Thorium precipitates in a variety of ill-defined
forms in the presence of phosphorous-contalning enions. These compounds are
extremely insoluble in water and in acid solution. The hypophosphate is parti-
cularly insoluble. Even in 6 Hcl the solubility is only 2.1 x 16" moles per
liter. Other insoluble phosphates such as zirconium phosphate serve as good
carriers for the removal of trace amounts of thorium from-aqueous eolution.

Thorium Oxalate. A widely used method of quantitative analysis of thorium
is the precipitation of thorium oxalate followed by ignition to thorium dioxide

and weighing of the dioxide, ©
Some complexing agents lnterfere with the precipitation of thorium oxalate
by the formation of soluble thorium complexes. Gordon and Shaver report a meth-
od for the separation of rare earth ions from thorium by precipitation of phos=-
phate-free rare earth oxalates in the presence of the strong chelating agent,
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA).

"Organic acids which form water-insoluble compounds with thorium vhich are
of possible analytical or radiochemical importance include sebacic, sathranitie,
phenylarsonic, gallic, tennic, quinaldic and aspartic acids.

4. Complex Ions of Thorium
The highly-charged positive ion, , has a strong tendency to form com-
plex lons with enlons which may be present in solution. Some familiarity with
the more common of these complex ions 1s required for a proper understanding of
the behavior of thorium 1m ion exchange separations , ln the extraction of thori-
um into organic solvents and so on. Quantitative measurements which have been
made on the equilibrium constants for complex ion formations are summarized in

A large number of other complex lons are known although not much quantita-
tive information is available on the strength of the complexes. Ions derived
from many organic acids such es cltrete, phthalate, maleate, succinate, malo-
nate lon and ethylenediaminetetraacetic (called EDTA or versene) form a series
of complex compounds or lons with thorium, The soluble EDTA-Complex of thorium
forms the basis of an excellent titrimetric determination of small amounts of
thorium? 12, It 1s of great significance to radiochemistry that thorium forms
a negatively-charged nitrate complex in nitric acid solutions greater than 3
molar in concentration. This 1s discussed further in connection with anion
exchange methods.

In connection with complex ion formation we may mention briefly the hydroly-
sis of thorium ion. In acidic solution throughout the entire range below pH3
hydrolysis of mt is negligible. At higher pH values there 1s extensive hydroly-
sls. There is a considerable disagreement in the published literature on the
products of hydrolysis end a number of mononudlear and polynuclear complexes
have been postulated. For interesting experimental studies and theoretical in-
terpretation of the hydrolysis of htt see Kraus and Holmberg 3 and s111n 15,

5. Chelate Compounds of Thorium

A few 1,3 diketones form chelate complexes of thorium which are readily ex-
tractable from aqueous solution into organic solvents. This fact forms the ba-
sls of a widely used method for the radiochemical purification of tracer thor-
ium, namely the extraction into benzene of the thenoylirifluorvacetirre acid com-
plex of thorium which 1s discussed in section 6. Before discussing this speci-
fic system, 1t will be worthwhile to review briefly the other known complexes
of this type which thorium forms.

The very strong and rather volatile complex of thorium with acetylacetone
has been knwon for many years. 6 In a 1,3 diketone complex of this type, four
molecules of the organic compound react wlth the mt ion to form a neutral
complex. Thorium acetylacetonate, like the other metal acetylacetonates,
posses a cyclic structure with the metal incorporated as part of a six-membered
ring. Rydberg! hes made a particuarly careful study on the complex formation
between thorium end acetylacetone and of the extraction of the complex into

organic solvents. Other 1,3 diketonee which form similar complex compounds mich
more stable toward acidic solutions are trifluoroacetylacetone, thenoyltrifluoro-

-20
acetylacetone, benzoylacetone and dibenzoyl methane’ . A comprehensive in-
2
vestigation of thorium chelate complexes was carrled out by Dyrssen 1 Some of

his results are quoted in Table 3 where the complexing constants of the proton
and thorium complexes of several chelating agents are given.
Thorium forms complex compounds with sellcylic acid, methoxybenzoic acid

and cinnamic scia’?, The thorium-sallicylate complex extracted into methyl
isobutyl ketone has salicyclic acid assoclated with 1t and may have the formule
Th(HA),, - EA. Covan22® developed a procedure for thorium analysis based on the
extraction of the thorium salicylate complex into a mixed solvent of chloroform
and ethyl acetate. :
Cupferron (nitrosophenylhydroxylemine) forms a complex which can be ex-
tracted into cholorform. Thorium forms a complex with quinolinol which 1s sol-
uble in organic solvents.23 The thorium complex with the reagent, thorln, 1s

widely used in a colorimetric analytical method.23%23P

6. Extraction of the TTA-Complex of Thorium into Organic Solvents

Many of the chelate complexes mentioned in the last section of this report
are soluble in organic solvents. By sultdable adjustment of reagent concentra~
tions and acldlty, thorium can be cleanly separated from conteminating iome by
such an extraction procedure. We single out for special attention the complex
formed with a-thenoyltrifluoroacetone, (called for convenlence, TTA), which
has been more widely used in rediochemigtry than any of the others. Some of the
reasons for this are the stabllity of the reagent toward acidic solution, the
favorable Keto-enol equilibrium in the reagent, the strength of the thorium com-
plex in slightly acldic solutions and the moderate solubility of the complex in
such solvents as benzene, chloroform and ketones.

Hagemann? studied the acid dependence of the extraction of trace quantities
of thorium, actinium and other elements into an 0.2M solution of TTA in benzene.
A typlcal curve 1s shown in figure 1. The extraction of thorium is essentially
quantitative above pHland drops rapldly in solutions of higher acidity. The
acld dependence is fourth power so that rather sensitive control of the extrac-
tion cen be made by control of the acldity. Thies control is highly useful since
thorium mey easily be separated from elements of lower lonlc charge such as the
alkall elements, the alkaline earths and even the rare earth elemente by extrac-
tion of thorium in the pH range of 1 to 2. Elements which extract more readily
than thorium are left in the benzene phase when the thorium is later removed by
contact with an aqueous solution. of slightly lower pH. The chief ions which are
extracted more strongly then thorium In solutions of acidity greater than pHL
are zirconium (IV), hafnium (IV), plutonium (IV), neptunium{IV), iron III, and
protactinium (V). These ions show high partition coefficients into the organic
phase for solutions as strongly acidic ss 1 molar or greater.

Further control of thorium extraction can be achieved by changing the con-
centration of TTA or by using another solvent in place of benzene. The presence
of ions which form strong complexes with thorium (see Table 2) interferes with
the extraction of thorium; therefore, it is best to perform the extraction from

a dilute nitric acid, perchloric acid or hydrochloric acid solution. Most of
the complex ion formation constants listed in Table 2 were measured by noting
the changes in the extractability of the thorium-TTA complex into benzene when
various anions were added to the aqueous phase. Hence the references quoted in
Table 2 can be consulted for very specific information on the extraction of thori-
um in the presence of complexing anions.

TTA extraction of thorium is an important step in several of the procedures
written down in Section V below.
Thorium may be separated from uranium when both are present in small con-
centrations 1f the solution contains no great quantity of neutral salts, but
the acidity must be adjusted carefully, There are better methods for meking
this particular separation. The extraction of tracer thorium from concentrated
golutions of uranium is not satisfactory because of the formation of insoluble
uranium complex compounds at the interface and it is necessary to remove the
bulk of the urnalum by some preliminary step.

In the isolation of small amounts of thorium from a comple initial mixture
of elements TTA extraction provides an excellent final step. Carrier precipitates
such as lanthanum fluoride and zirconium lodate may be used to remove the bulk
of the impurities and the finel purification as well as the elimination of the
carrier material, may be effected by a final TTA-extraction cycle.

The solubility of the thorium-TTA complex in benzene ie rather small so
that large volumes of solution are required to handle bulk amourits (gram amounts)
of thorium. Some workers.’ report good results with the reagent, 1-(3,4 dichloro-
phenyl) - &,4,5,5,6,6,6 heptafluoro-1,3 hexanldione which forms a thorium complex
with a considerably higher solubility in benzene. Unfortunately, this reagent
1s not availsble commercially. With this ‘reagent 20 grems of thorium can be dis-
solved in 100 millileters of cel, compared to 0.3 grams of thorium as the TTA-
complex.

T. Extraction of Thorium Into Organic Solvents oo

The extractability of thorium from equeous solutions into organic solvents
has been studied for dozens of representative solvents of all types. Most af
these studies have been concerned with hydrochloric acid systems, nitric acld
systems or mixed nitric acid - neutral nitrate salt systems. A great desl of
the information on the extraction of thorium, uranium and plutonium was origl-
nally published in dlessified reports of the Manhattan Project or of the Atomic
Energy Commission or of the governmental laboratories of Canada and Great Britain
and France. This information is now declassified, but there has never been a
complete systematic covermge of the basic chemistry in books and Journals readi-
ly avallgble in any scientific laboratory. Solvent extraction processes have
been developed for the recovery of thorium from monazite sands, for the separa~
tion of U?33 from neutron irradiated thorium, for the recovery of the irraiisted
thorium for reuse, and for other purposes. In this brief review, we conflne
our remarks to the chief solvents and the principal effects of experimental
conditions of the laboratory scale treatment of small or tracer quantities of
thorium.

Ethyl ether ie often used to purify uranium. If the aqueous phase is
slightly acidic with nitric acid (perhaps .0l to .05 Molar) and highly salted
with a neutral nitrate such aa ammonium, cdlcium or magnesium nitrate, then

12
uranium ie reedlly extracted into ethyl ether leaving nearly all impurities ins
cluding thorium in the aqueous phase. Thorium will not extract into ethyl ether
unless the concentration of acid ard neutral salts in the aqueous phese is so
high that numerous other impurites would also extract.

Methyl isobutyl ketone will extract thorium with a distribution coeffl-
clent as high as 9 (orgenic/ aqueous) provided the nitric acid concentration
of the aqueous phase 1s malntzined at 1M to 3M and if, in addition, a high
concentration of such strong salting egents as calclum, magnesium or aluminum
nitrate 1s mainteined. At the Towa State College in Ames Towa, large quantities
of thorium were purified from monazlte sande by a process which included a sol-
vent extraction separation of thorium from rare eexrth impurities 26 The sol-
vent was hexone and the aqueous phase feed solution was 3 Molar in calcium ni-
trate and 3 Molar in nitric acid. }

Rydberg and Bernstr8m’| have studied the distribution of Th(IV), U(VI),
Pu(IV), PU(VI), Zr(IV), Ca(II), La(III) and HR, between methyl isobutyl ketone
and aqueous solutions of nitric acid and calcium nitrate of yYarying composition.
Figure 2 taken from their work shows the malin features of the extraction of
these lons. A 1955 Geneva Conference paper of Bruce? 2 discusses the extraction
of fission products into hexone.

Pentaether (dibutoxytetraethylene glycol) will extract thorium from
aqueous nitrate solutions under moderate salting conditions? °. For example,

3 and 1M or greater in calclum
nitrete are removed to the extent of 90 percent or more from the aqueous phase
by an equal volume of this solvent. Fifty percent ies removed from a hy HNO.
solution and 80 percent from an BM HNO, solution by an equal volume of solvent.
If the aqueous phase 1s 1M in HNO a saturated with ammonium nitrate, the
extraction is quantitetive. Pgppard = has reported the use of pentaether in
the purification of ibnium (rn?39) from pitchblende residues. He states that
90 percent of the thorium 1s extracted from a solution €M in KE, FO, and 0.3 M
in HWO_ into an equal volume of solvent consisting of a mixture of pentaether
(2 volumes) and diethylether (1 volume). Under these conditions less than 1
percent of yttrium end the rare earths are extracted.See alpo epalytical method

vent for thorium. Levine and Grima1a1?? have used it in an analytical procedure

for the determination of thorium in thorium ores. The ore sample ie decomposed

by fusion with a mixture of NaF “8,04. Thorium is precipitated as the oxalate.

The oxalate precipitate 1s dissolved in nitric acid end the solution is pre-
pared for solvent extraction by adjusting the HNO, concentration to 1.2 Molar
and edding aluminum nitrate to 2.5 Molar. The solution is contacted with an
equal volume of mesityl oxide which extracts the thorium quantitatively and
separates it from nearly all impurities including rare earths. Traces of

Hiller and Martin3® have used mesityl oxlde to extract thorium away from
rare earth fission products in a thorium target solution. The thorium metal
was dissolved in HCl with a small amount of fluosilicate ion present to clear
up the solution. The solution was saturated with AL(m0,) and the thorium was
extracted by contacting the solution with mesityl oxide.

 Marechal-Cornil end PicciottosT used mesityl oxide for the quantitative
extraction of thorium, bismuth and polonium from a mixture of natural radio-
elements present in concentrations 1079 grams per c.,c. The solution was sabt-
urated with A(m,) 3° Radium and lead did not extract.

The edjustment of equeous phase composition for the optimum radiochemical
purification of thorium depends greatly on the nature of the impurities present.

The principal heavy elements or fission producte which show high extrectability
into TBP are the following:

thorium (IV) < Leptunium (IV) < plutonium (IV)
plutonium (VI) < neptunium (VI) < uranium (VI)
protectinium (V)

cerium (IV) hafnium (IV) zirconium (IV)

rare earths (III) (considerably less extracteble than
above under most conditions).

An excellent overall view of the extraction of these elements from hydro-
chlorie or nitric acid systems of varying composition into an undiluted or
diluted THP solvent phase is presented in the articles listed in Table k.

The high extractability of thorium into undiluted TBP from hydrochloric
acid and nitric acid systems are given in figures 3 and 4. Thorlum nitrate 1s

placed by some nitrate salt such as sodium nitrate, calelum nitrate or alumimm
nitrate. This is dramatically shown in Table 5 where some data taken from a
publication of H.A.C. McKay are presented. The main reason for the difference

is that the neutral nitrate salts are not soluble in TEP whereas HO, forms a
soluble complex with TEP.

tant separations which can be made with such a mixture of "salting agents" in the
- aqueous phase are apparent from an inspection of figure 5.

The viscosity and density of undiluted TBP makes 1t somewhat troublesome to
use. Hence 1t is frequently diluted to a 10 to 40 volume percent solution in
some inert diluent solvent such as n-butyl ether, ether, benzene, carbon tetra-
chloride, kerosene or some industrial mixture of hydrocarbons. The diluted THP
extracts thorium with a reduced extraction coefficlent but, as a compensatory
change, the extractability of a number of other ions 1s reduced below the point
where they will extract to an appreciable extent,

Thorium may be recovered from a TBP phase into an aguecus phase by back-
washing the TBP with dlstilled water or with very dilute acid.

Important Note: All of the data quoted here for extraction of thorium by
tributyl phosphate are for a pure solvent pretreated to remove monobutylphos-
phate and dibutyl phosphate. Most THP "as received" is contaminated with these
hydrolyeis products. Since these compounds have a mich stronger ability to com-
plex thorium and contaminating impurities, quite different extraction and purifi-
cation behavior is obtalned when they are presnt. Hence it is good practice to
pretreat TBP by washing it thoroughly with aqueous sodium carbonate end pure
water.

Monoalkyl and Dialkyl Phosphates mixed with inert carrier solvents show
phenomenally high extraction coefficients for thorium even from aqueous solution
in which the concentration of acid and neutral salts is quite low. The general
equations for such solvents are

(co)ro(om),,
and (G0),PO(OH)

Some specific solvents are those in which G is butyl or 2-ethyl hexyl or octyl
phenyl {more specifically para (1, 1,3, 3-tetramethylbutyl) phenyl]. Dilute solu-
tions of these acldic esters of orthophoephoric acid in toluene are able to
pull th(IV), the rare earth ions, Zr(IV), Kp(IV), Pu(IV), Bk(IV) and many other
ions into the organic phase with partition coefficients ranging up to several
thousand. The partition coefficients are strong functions of the concentra-
tion of the extracting agent and of the acid so there 1s considerable opportuni-
ty to manipulate experimental conditions to favor the preferential extraction
of certein lons, particularly such highly extractable ions as th(IV). No de-
tailed date on the extraction of thorium has been published and there are no
detalled descriptions in the literature on the use of solvents of this type for
the radiochemical separation of thorium. It seems clear, however, that the
extraordinarily high partition coefficients for thorium in the presence of these
acldic esters of orthophosphate will find many applications in radiochemistry.
"Some idea of the necessary pretreatment of the solvent and of the solvent power
of these solvent systems can be obtained in publiéetions by Peppard and his co-
a A —— on the extraction of Bk(IV) from rare earths and other °
impurities indicates the type of separation of tetrapositive and tripositive ions
which can be achieved. Peppard, Moline and Mason! put Cm(III) end Bk(IV) into
an aqueous solution 10M in HNO, and 0.1M in KBrO, (to maintain the Bk in an
oxldized state) and contacted the aguecus phase with an 0.15 M solution of
di-ethyl hexyl phosphate in n-heptane. The curium remained in the agueous

phase (Kop = lh x 1073) while the berkelium was quantitatively extracted

(Ky, = 1900). :

In addition to tributyl phosphate and the mono and dialkyl esters of

phosphoric acid, there are several other clssses of phosphorous containing
componnde which have received considerable study as possible extracting solvents

20
for urenium, thorium and other elements. B8everal of these compounds have ex-
tracting power much greater than that of tributyl phosphate. Some of the

most promising solvents are of the following types, where the letter R represents
an alkyl group.

Esters of pyrophosphoric acid

Other classes of solvents which are very promising for many applications in
the extractive metallurgy of the heavy elements are the mono - di ~- trl - and
quaternary alkyl emmines. A number of reports have been written on these phos-
phorous and ammine solvents and most of them can be located with the ald of
Nuclear Sclence Abstracts. It 1s premature to discuss these solvents in any
detail here because very little has been published concerning their use in the
radiochemical separation of thorium. There is no question, however, that radio-
chemists will find several of these new solvents highly useful to them.

As 8 single example, the solvent tri-n-octylphosphine oxide is reviewed
briefly in Tables 7 and 8 . This data is teken from an Oek Ridge Report by
Ross and White, Tt can be seen that thorium is very highly extracted into
en 0.1 M solution of tri-n-octylphosphine oxide in cyclohexane from dilute HCI,
EC10,, and particularly, dilute HO. Tt is particularly well extracted when

the aqueous phase is 1M in ENO, and 1M 1n sodium nitrate.

8. Ton Exchange Behavior of Thorium
Cation Exchange

The tetrapositive thorium ion is adsorbed on cetion exchange resins more
strongly than most other ions. This fact makes 1t possible to adsorb thorium
tracer from a large volume of solution onto a smell amount of resin. It mekes
it feasible to separate thorium from most other ions by washing the resin on
which the thorium is adsorbed quite thoroughly with a mineral acid solution or
some other suiteble leaching agent to remove the less-strongly-bound ions.
When both the thorium and the unwanted contaminents are present in small con-
centrations the method 1s particularly applicable,

Diamond, Street and Seaborg studied the adsorption of tracer lons on the
resin Dowex 50 (a copolymer of styrene and divinyl benzene with nucleonic sul-
fonic acid groups as exchange sites) and the elution of the ions with hydrochlor-

21
ic acid of varying concentration. At all concentrations of HCl, thorium (IV)
was very strongly held by the resin and such ions as 8r{IT), La(III),CE(III)
and Ac{IIT) were mich more rapidly eluted. Thorium (IV) on the resin is readily
washed free of heavy element tetrapositive ions such as Fp(IV) or Pu{IV) with
HCl 6 molar or greater in concentration because the higher elements in the tetra-
positive state form strong complexes with hydrochloric acid. This is true also
of uranyl lon. .

Thorium ie removed from a cation exchange resin by passing a complexing
agent through the column of resin to reduce the effective concentration of free

Bane’? separated emall amounts of thorium from 0.15 M urenyl nitrate solu-
tion containing 0.1 M HNO, by passing the solution through a bed of Amberlite
IR-1 resin. The column was thoroughly washed with 0.25 M H,80, to remove all
the uranium. The thorium was then eluted with 1.25 M NaHS0, -

Dryssen’t separated vx, (m23%) from uranium by adsorbing the UX, on Wolfat-
it XS from a 2M HCl solution of uranium. The pure UX, is then eluted with 0.5 M
oxalic acid. The solution is evaporated to dryness and the oxallc acld is
sublimed off leaving a carrier-free thorium sample.

Asaro, Stephens and Perlman’? prepared radiochemically pure samples of
mmZ28 for a and ry spectrum studies by adsorbing an Impure mixture of 228 and

its deughter products on a short Dowex-50 resin column (3mm diameter x 3 em
height) from a dilute nitric acid solution. The columm was jacketed to allow
operation at 87° C (the temperature of the vapors of bolling triethylene glycol).
The radium, lead and bismuth fractions were eluted with 4M nitric acid, after
which the thorium wes stripped with s 50-volume-percent solution of lactic acid
at pH3. One ml of lactic acid sufficed to remove the Th2C from the column.

The lactic acid could be removed by sublimation. The high temperature opera-

23
tion was essential for the rapid removal of the thorium in a small volume of
eluting solution.

Procedure 9 1n Bectlon V of this report contains additional comment on the
adsorption and desorption behavior of thorium on cation exchange resins.

Anlon Exchange - Hydrochloric Acld Bystems

The remarks on ‘the use of anlon exchange resins in the radiochemical puri~
fication of thorium will be divided into two parts. The first part will discuss
hydrochloric acid syétems in which thorium forms no negative complexes and
hence is not edsorbed by anion exchange resins. Several other heavy elements’
end several fission product elements do form negative ions im concentrated ‘hy--
drochloric acid and can be readily removed from a thorium solution by adsorp-
tion on a small amount of ion exchange resin. A number of possible separations
are readily apparent from a consideration of the following data on adsorption
behavior ln the cese of the resin Dowex-1 (a coplymer of styrene and divinyl
benzene with quaternary smmonium functional groups.)

Uranium(VI), neptunium (VI) end plutonium (VI) readily adsorbed
from hydrochloric acid solutioms 6 M or greater ln concentration. Readily
desorbed with 0 to 3 M HCl.

Neptunium (V) readily adsorbed above 4 M HCl. Protactinium (V)
readily edsorbed ebove 8 M HCl.

Thorium (IV) not adsorbed at eny HCl concentration. Neptunium(IV)
adsorbed sbove 4 M HCl. Plutonium (IV) adsorbed strongly sbove 2.5 M HCL .

Plutonium (III) not adsorbed at any HCl concentration, Lanthanide
rare earths not adsorbed at any HCl concentration. Americlum and higher
actinide elements in the triposltive oxidation state very slightly adsorbed
in highly concentrated HCl.

Kraus, Moore and Nelson’3 investigated the anlon exchange behavior of thor-
lum, protactinium and uranium in hydrochloric acid solutions and suggested sev-
eral alternate procedures for the clean separation of these three elements from
each other. For example, a mixture of the three lons in 8 M EC1 may be passed
through a Dowex-1 column to adsorb uranium and protactinium at the top of the
colum. Thorium pasees through the column quantitatively. The protactinium is
rapidly eluted with 3.8 M HCl. The uranium elutes somewimt later. Alternatively
the protactinium may be eluted with a ml xture of T M HC1 plus 0.11 M HF leaving
the uranium firmly bound to the resin. The presence of fluoride ion causes a
dramatic decrease in the distribution coefficient for protactinium without affect-
ing that for uranium. After the protactinium is off the column the uranium is
rapidly desorbed with 0.5 M HCL.

Many of the fisslon product elements form adsorbable negatively-charged
chloride complexes in hydrochloric acid. Those which do can be removed from a
solution of thorium by contact of the solution with a sample of resin. An

24
excellent overall review of all elements in the periodic system and a good

bibliography is to be found in the 1955 Geneva Conference paper of Kraus and
54

Nelson” ".

Dowex-1 resin are zirconium(IV), hefnium{IV), iron(III), zinc(II), cobalt{II),

gallium(III), molybdenum(VI), cadmium({II), tin(IV), tin(II), antimony(III),

antimony(V), mercury(IT), bismth{III), and polonium{IV). It is noteworthy

that thorium appears to be the only metallic element of the fourth group of

Some important ions which may be removed from a thorium solution by

the Periodle System which cannot be adsorbed by a strong base anion-exchange
resin from concentrated hydrochloric acid solution. The differing behavior of
thorium(IV) and zirconium(IV) is particularly noteworthy in this connection be-
cause In some radiochemical procedures zirconium lodate or some other zirconium
" compound is used as a carrier precipitate for thorium. The carrier ion can be
removed easily by placing the thorium tracer and zirconium carrier in 9-12 M
HCl and removing the zirconium with anion exchange regin.

Polrier and Bearge’ 8 of the Battelle Memorial Institute wrote a report
on the separation of uranium and thorium with particular reference to the pro-
cessing of monazite sands. The separation of uranium from thorium in carbonate,
HCl and H,80, solutions by anion exchange resins was studied in some detail
including the effects of extraneous lions, types of resin, ete.

Anion Exchange Nitric Acid Systems

In the second maln part of the discussion of the anion exchange behavior
of thorium, we turn to a consideration of nitric acld systems. A few years ago
the surprising discovery was made’? that Shoriun. forme adsorbeble nitrate com-
plexes in nitric acid solution over a wide range of nitric acid concentration
with meximm sbesorption occurring near TM ERO, « This fact can be made the basis
of a number of lmportant radiochemical separations such as the separation of
thorium from rare earths, from zirconium, from uranium, from actinium and a
number of other elements.

Danon”’ reports that the ebsorption of thorium on Dowex-1, 8% divinyl-ben-
zene 50-100 mesh, expressed &s a distribution coefficient D (amount of thorium
per gram of dry resin divided by the amount of thorium per ml of solution),
increases from D = 300 and decreases slowly to D = 210 at 10 M HNO, . The
thorium is immediately desorbed from & Dowéx-1l column with dilute HCl.

carsve119 investigated the adsorption of Th>3° and 0233 tracer by De-
Acidite FF (nitrate form) from HNO4 solutions. Some of his values are glven
in Table 9. Using these results Carswell separated a mixture of thorium and
uranium by adsorbing both on the top of a 2 mm diemeter by 8 cm long column of
De-Acidite FF from a small volume of 6 M ENO, and then eluting the uranium slowly
with 4 M nitric acid. The separation was not good at room temperature but was
satisfactory at 77°C. The thorium was eluted from the column with pure water.
The number of elements which form negative complexes with nitrate ion is
smell and a large number of ions such as the alkalis, the alkaline earths, the
rare earths, etc. can be separated rapidly and cleanly from thorium by adsorb-

ing the thorium on Dowex-1l, Dowex-Z2 or De-Acidite FF resin from 6-10 M HNO,

Even zirconium can be separated as it 1s only weakly adsorbed. Same comblina-
tions of impurities might best be removed by a two step anipn exchange treat-
ment based on the differing behavior of thorium and its contaminants in chloride
systems and secondly in nitrate systems.

2. Evaporate to dryness (wash twice wlth water and teke these washings also to
dryness) and teke up in acid pH 1.0. TTA extract with equal volume (0.25M
TTA in benzene) stirring 15 min. (Th into TTA but not U or Ac.)

3. Repeat TTA extraction of step 2 with fresh TTA and combine the extractions,

4. Wash TTA with equal volume of pH 1.0 solution for 15 min. (U contamination
into acid.)

5. Wash TTA with 6N acid (equal volume) and stir 15 min, (Th into acid.)

6. Repeat steps 2, 3, and 4. (Repeat wash as in step 4 if necessary for
further U purification.)

7. Plate out the 0,25M TTA on Pt plates end flame.

Remarks:

Bee curves of Hegemann (JACS 72, T68 (1950) )} for percentage of extraction
into TTA ve. pH for Th and Ac, At pH of 1, Th should go lnto the TTA
almost campletely, but U should only go in less than 10 percent, perhaps
as little as 2 percent. Ac will not go into TTA until about pH 3 or so,
and of course Pe goes in up to about 6K or 8M acid.

PH conditions for separating Th from U by TTA extractions are quite

critical!

Equivalent and molecular weight of TTA is 222 g.

Yield: 50,000 to 10,000 c/m from 20 g URH
Degree of purification: Factor of ~10~ from U

Adventages: Good yield with small amount of inert carrier. (Very voluminous
insoluble precipitate. Uranium does not precipitate at all.)

Procedure:

1. Dissolve 20 g of UO 2{803) 6H, 0 in 20 to 30 ml of 0.01 N HEO, in 40-ml
centrifuge cone and warm eolucion to about 80° C in a hot water bath. Add
0.5 to 1 mg of Zr carrier as nitrate.

2. Add 5 ml of a saturated solution of m-nitrobenzoic acid in water and con-
tinue warming for about 1 hr. Let stand overnight.

3. Centrifuge, decant supernatant, and wash Zr (cgH FO,C00), twice with
0.01N HNO, + m-nitrobenzole acid.

Remarks:
Saturated solution of m-nitrobenzoic acid made up by dissolving 400 mg of

the material in 100 ml of E,0. Heat to 80°C. Allow to stand sveral hours and

filter to remove excess and impurities.

PROCEDURE 3

Milking experiment Equipment required: Standard

Yield: Only ~40 to 50 percent Th per cycle

Degree of purification: 2 to 3 percent Accarried per cycle, other elements
decontaminated by factor of at least 100.

Advantages: Good procedure 1f Th is present in approximately the game amount
as other activities.

Procedure: Pa daughters in 6N HCl after milking from Pa in TTA (procedure

Centrifuge. Wash once with alkaline water.
PROCEDURE 3 (Cont 'd.)

L. Dissolve in HCl and repeat steps 1 to 3, reducing amount of La carrier.
5. Plate as the LaCl, solution, flame, and count,
Remarks:

Zr (PO), precipitate quite specific for carrying mH from other elements
in the heavy region. Yield lost in the LaF -La (OH), precipitation.

Do not use this procedure if more purification is needed than 1s glven by
two cycles, since the Th yleld will be very low.

LaCl, solution when evaporated sticks to Pt plates much better than the

precipitate encountered in this procedure.

PROCEDURE 4

Solution of Thorium Metal and Thorium Dioxide
Source Rewton, Hyde, and Meinke in report AECD-2738.

Thorfum metal can be dissolved rapidly in conc. HCl, but a considerable
amount of black insoluble residue is formed in the process. If a few drops
of (mm), ) S1F solution (enough to make ~0.1.M) are added to the HCl before
solution 1s started, the black residue ia dissolved, leaving only a small
residue of thorium oxdde (< 1 percent) in the clear solution.

Thorium metal can be dissolved in conc. ENO, with the addition of (mm),
BiF, (or BEF) to 0.01M. The metal becomes passive to solution from time to
time, requiring further additions of acid and Sif, .

If the excess HRO, is evaporated off, care should be taken not to allow
the solution to go completely to dryness, or difficulty soluble Tho, will be
formed. }

If it is desired to dissolve ThO,, the HNO, (NH, ) 51F¢ solution should be
used, and the mixture should be heated with stirring for several hours. ThO
when first formed, is much more soluble than after prolonged heating.

Purification:

Thorium isolated from uranium targets showed no evidence of forelgn alpha
particle groupe upon pulse analysis. The complex beta decay and growth was
always reproducible and could be accounted for on the basis of the isotopes
known to be present. This reproducibility suggests a high degree of beta
purlty.

Yield: At least 50 percent.

Equilibrate benzene solution with 5 ml 3N ERO, for 15 minutes. Separate
layers and discard benzene phase. The 3N HNO, solution will contain

carrier-free thorium, unless mh232 was present in the original solution.

232 should be present in the originel solution,

the above procedure might become awkward because of large precipitates
and the difficulty in extrecting large macro amounts of thorium into
TTA. In this case, the use of an associated chelating compound,
"Dagmar," (1-(3,L4-dichlorophenyl)-4,4,5,5,6,6,6, heptafluoro-1,3
hexanedione) in place of TTA is preferable because of the much

greater solubility of this thorium chelate in benzene.

A. Determination of Ionium(ThZ3®) in Corel Samples
l. Introduction

The determination of ionium (Tn?3°) in coral samples involves carrier free
separation of the total thorium content by use of TTA[4,},k4,trifluoro - 1 -
(2-thienyl) ~ 1,3 - butanedione]. Thorium is finally adsorbed on a cation
exchange column and eluted with oxalic acid. It is then @-counted and pulse
enalyzed, with m?228 being employed to determine chemical yleld. - The chemical

yield is 50-70%. Duplicate samples may be run in about 6 hours.
2. Procedure

Step 1. Transfer about 2 g. of coral, weighed to the nearest 0.1 g., to
a 600-ml beaker. Add Th?28 tracer in known amount (5-100 c/m) end wash down
the sides of the beaker with H.0. .

Step 2. With a speedyvap watch glass in place on top of the beaker,
gradually add 75 ml. of conc. HRO,, dropwlse at first to prevent excessive
foaming. Place the covered besker on a hot plate and allow the solution to
boll until the begetable fibers present in most samples have disintegrated and
brown fumes are no longer evolved. Cool to room temperature and cautlously
add 70% EC10, . (During this and subsequent steps which involve fuming with
HC10, , the operator should wear a face shield and rubber gloves.) Evaporate
to dense white fumes and continue heating for at least an additional 5 minutes.
Cool to room temperature and dilute to about 200 ml. with H,0.

Step 3. Add conc. NH, OH until the solution is Just acid, and then adjust
the pH to 2.0-2.5 with the use of 3M RH, OH and 3M HC10, .
Step 4. To a special separatory funnel add the solution

from Step 3 and 150 ml. of 0.5M TTA in benzene. Stir for at least 1.5 hours
with a vortex stirrer driven at high speed by means of an air motor. Permit
the layers to separate, draw off the aqueous layer, and discard. (Note 1).

Step 5. Wash the benzene layer, containing the thorium complexed with TTA,
for about 30 seconds by stirring with 100 ml. of H,0. Discard the washings.
Wash again with 50 ml. of H)0 and discard the washings.

33
. PROCEDUEE 7 (Cont'd. )

Step 6. Extract the thorium fram the benzene by stirring for 3 minutes
with 100 ml. of 3M HCl.

Step 7. Transfer the aqueous phase to a baker and evaporate with an air
Jet on a steam bath until the volume has been reduced to 20-30 ml. Transfer
the solution to a 40-ml. centrifuge tube and continue evaporation to a volume
of 1-2 ml.

Step 8. Add 1 ml. of conc. ERO, and boil over a flame until brown fumes
are no longer evolved. Cool to room temperature, then add 0.3-0.4 ml. of 70%

HC10, , and boll to the appearance of white fumes. .Cool to room tempera-
ture and dilute to about 3.5 ml. with H,0.

Step 9. Transfer the solution to the top of a Dowex 50 - x L cation
exchange column (Note 2) and rinse the centrifuge tube with 0.5 ml. of water,
adding the rinsings to the colum. (If air bubbles are present in the column,
they should be removed by stirring with Pt wire.) Force the solution through
the column under 2 pounds of air pressure, and then wash the column with 3a
ml. of 3M HCl under the same pressure. Discard the first effluent and the wash.
Step 10. Pour 2 ml. of 0.5M H,C,0, onto the column and allow the solution
‘to run through under atmospheric pressure. Collect the drops from the column
on 1" squere (1-3 mil) Pt plates, which are placed Just far enough below the
column so that drops separate from the tip before hitting the plate. ' Nine
drops of effluent are collected on each of four plates. Dry the plates under
a heat lamp; then flame in an open flame.

Step 11. a-count the individual plates and then pulse analyze those
plates which carry the activity (Note 3).

Hotes

l. The chemical yield may be increased slightly by taking the aqueous
layer through an additional extraction. This was done with some of the samples.

2. The tubes which are used to support the resin columns were constructed
by blowing out the end of a 15 ml. centrifuge tube and sealing on a-length of
‘3-4 mn. 1.d. tubing.

Dowex 50-xli resin vas water-graded and the fraction which settled at the
rate of 2-5 cm./min. was selected for use. This was washed several times with

cone, HCl and then with HO.
To support the resin column, a layer of HCl-washed send about 5 mm. thick

is placed in the tlp of the column tube. A slurry of graded, HCl-washed resin
is then added by means of a syringe pipet, the resin slurry being introduced
into the tube near the bottom so ms to eliminate air bubbles, The emount of
slurry added should be sufficlent to produce a column 7-9 cm. in length after

3%
PROCEDURE 7 (Cont'd.)

settling. B8ettling of the resin may be hastened by application of up to 10
pounds air pressure to the top of the colum. To permit pressure control, the
connection from the air line to the top of the column is made through a
reducing valve. Slurry liquid is allowed to flow through
the column until the liquid level® reaches the top of the resin; the stopper is
then removed from the top of the column tube. Ailr must not be permitted to
enter the resin column. If air does enter, the resin is reslurried to
remove air bubbles. The cation column prepared as described above 1s washed
with 2-3 ml. of 3M HC10), and is then ready for use.

3. Pulse analyses were made with 100 channel analyzer operated at a

window setting which placed the 228 peak in the 83-87 channel region.

Determination of Ionium in Old Fission Product Material.

l. Introduction

The method described for the determination of ionium (hZ3°) in coral

samples (Procedure 7) is not satisfactory for fission product solutions ilnas-
much as the plutonium present in the latter comes through the separation
procedure and seriously intereferes in pulse analyses. To overcome this
difficulty, plutonium is removed on an anion exchange column from concentrated
hydrochloric acid medium immediately before thorium is absorbed on the cation
column.

2. Procedure

Step 1. To en liquot of the sample in a 150-ml. beaker add Th’20 tracer

in known emount (5-100 c¢/m) and then boil to white fumes. Dilute to 40 ml.
with H,0.

Step 2. Repeat Steps 3-7 of Procedure T except cut down amounts of all
reagents by a factor of five.

‘Step 3. Add 0.3-0.4 ml. of 70% HC10, end boil to the appearance of vhite
fumes. Cool to room temperature and dilute to ebout 4 ml. with Solution A.
(Solution A comeists of come. ENO, mixed with conc. HCl in the ratio of 0.1
ml. HNO, to 15 ml. of ECL.)

Step 4. Transfer the solution to the top of a 5 cm x 2 mm. Dowex Alx2
anion exchange colum (Note 1) and rinse the centrifuge tube with about 0.5
ml. of Salution A, adding the rinsings to the column. (Observe the usual pre-

PROCEDURE 8 (Cont'd.)

cautions to avoid introduction of air bubbles. ) Force the solution through
the column under 1-2 pounds of air pressure and collect the effluent in a
4O-ml. test tube. Rinse the column with 3 ml. of Solution A under the same
pressure and collect the effluent in the same test tube. Pu 1s retained on
the column and thorium comes through in the effluent.
Step 5. The effluent is evaporated with an air Jet to about 1 ml. on a

steam bath.

Step 6. Add 1 ml. of conc. ERO, and boil over a flame until brown fumes
are no longer evolved. Cool to room temperature and add 1 ml. of ‘70% of BC10, .
Boil until white fumes appear, then cool to room temperature, and dilute with
H0 to about 3.5 ml.

Step 7. Repeat steps 9, 10, and 11 of Procedure T.

Notes

1. The anion exchange column is prepared in essentially the same manner
as the cation column (See Rote 2, Procedure 7). The resin used is'a 0.5-2

cm/min. fraction of Dowex Al-x2. The resin 1s prepared for use by washing
wlth Solution A.

Tracer Methods for Analysis of Thorium Isotopes

l., Imtroduction

The principal purification step in tracer work with thorium isotopes
depends on the fact that the relatively small, highly charged thorium lon 1s
more tightly bound to a cation exchange resin such as Dowex 50-X4 than the ions
of most other elements. Thorium 1s adsorbed on the resin bed and washed with
dilute hydrochloric acid solutions to remove most Impurities; them it 1s
eluted from the column in a very narrow band with oxalic acid. Since thorium
oxalate is insoluble, macro quantities cannot be‘eluted from the colum in
this way. The Dowex 50-X4 resin with 4% divinyl benzene in the original poly-
styrene bead is more satisfactory for this eeparation than any of the other
cross-linkages. Dowex 50-X2 does not adsorb tharium strongly enough under the
experimental conditions to be describeds the higher cross-linkages in Dowex

 50-X8 or -X12 do not allow impurities to be removed at a reasanable rate, and
also cause so much tailing in the elution that the thorium is not concentrated

36
PROCEDURE 9 (Cont'd. )

in the small volume desired. In tracer work with thorium, it is well to avoid
solutions containing nitrate, fluoride, sulfate, or phosphate, since these cawme
considerable losses in either anion exchange or cation exchange column steps.
In the analysis for any thorium lsotope in a solution containing organic
matter such as lhcompletely.decomposed filter paper, it 1s deemed necessary
as a first step, after the addition of a suitable tracer, to boll to demse
fumes with perchloric acid. Even though thorium has only the cne stable valence
state in solution, there 1s very strong evidence for lack of exchange between
added tracer and the radioisotope already in the solution when a hydroxide pre-
cipitation 1s performed without the fuming ahead of it. Whether this apparent
lack of complete exchange results from complexing of thorium by organic mole-
cules that survived the initial solution of the sample in nitric and perchloric
acids, or from the existemce of thorium in the sclution as some polymeric ion,

is probably difficult to determine. Routine fuming of this type of sample has
markedly improved the precision of the analysis. If the analysis is performed

on solutions containing macro amounts of calcium, two precipitations of thorium
on some carrier hydroxide such as iron or a rare earth will result in a much
cleaner plate. Since most of the snalyses were done on solutions containing a
very large excess of fission products, (Section 5A), two Dowex 50-X4 columms
were used.

Some of the zirconium and probably a few other unknown contaminants are
eliminated by adsorbing them from concentrated hydrochloric acid solution om a
relatively high cross-linked, astrong-base anion exchange resin such as Dowex
1-X8 or -X10. Two of these columns are used, ome after the other, if ome of
the beta-emitting thorium isotopes is being separated. If an alpha-emitting
thorium 1s belng purified, one of the anion columns may well be sufficient,
and if the sample contains fission products which are several days old and
excessive amounts of plutonium and neptunium are not present, the two cation
colums provide sufficient decontamination.

Tracer amounts of thorium can be separated from uranium in quentities up
to about a gram with one Dowex 50-Xh column. Amounts of urenium up to about
10 grams can be adsorbed on a 150~ to 200-ml bed of Dowex 1-X8 from concen-
trated hydrochloric acid, leaving thorium inthe effluent. A carrier-free
source of m3 was prepared from 2 kg of oralloy by doing several -ether
extractions; then finally a cation column was employed to concentrate the:
activity in 1 to 2 drops of oxalic acid (Bectiom 5C).

Section 5B describes the application of the principles of separation
noted above to the specific analysis of thorium in coral or limestone samples,
as developed by W.N. Backett.
PROCEDURE 9 (Cont'd.)
2. Resins
Anion exchm ge resin AG 1-X8, 100-200 mesh, stored in conc. HCL.
(AG resins are analytical grade Dowex materials supplied by the Bio-Rad
Laboratories, 800 Delaware, Berkeley, California.)
Cation exchange resin AG 50-Xk, 50-100 mesh
Cation exchange resin AG 50-X4, 100-200 mesh.

Both of the cation resins are stored in 3M HCl. It may not be necessary
to do any further purification on the resins if they are obtained from Bio-Rad
Laboratories. However, it may be well to treat the resins as follows. Place
.a quantity of the resin In a large fritted disk funnel of medium or coarse
porosity. (In this Laboratory, we use a 1l2-cm fritted dick fummel sealed to a
foot-long piece of glass tubing so that much larger quantities of resin can be
handled.) The treatments described below are speeded considerably by draining
reagents into a large (2 to 44) suction flask connected to vacuum to allow more
complete removal of a reagent before the next one is added. It is helpful when
adding a reagent to the partially dried resin to stir it up with a heavy
porcelain spatula, then let it settle and flow by gravity awhile to prolong the
treatment time before suction 1s applied and the reagent removed, The success-
ive reagents used for treating the resin are: An orgenic solvent, such as
acetone, or alcohol, which removes short-chain organic polymers not firmly
anchored in the resin matrix; water to rinse out the organlc solvent; conc.
HCl, containing esbout 1 ml of ZM HaBro, per 100 ml, to dissolve extraneous
inorganic matter. This is removed with water or dilute HCl in an amount equal
to 10 to 20 times the volume of resin being purified. The resin can be washed
with 3M EH, OH and then with water at this polnt, but it probably is not
necessary. It should now be washed with 5 to 10 times its own volume of
whatever solution it is to be stored in. If there are fine particles that are
undesirable, they can be removed by running distilled water upward through the
fritted disk at such a rate that they will float over the top, leaving the
bulk of the resin in the tube.

and one that is 0.35 cm 1.d. and 7 cm helght.

The glass contalner for the column of resin 1s most canvenienlly made
by sealing a piece of the proper size of tubing, in this case either 0.6 cm
1.4. by 7 cm or 0.35 cm 1.4. by 7 cm, to the bottom of a tapered 15-ml cen-
trifuge tube. Ir glass wool is to be used as a support for the resin, the

sige of the opening in the tip at the bottom of the colum is not very eritieal,
from ebout 0.3 to 2 mm being satisfactory. The hole size for a sand support
should not be much larger than 0.3 to 0.5 mm, and it is beat to put a layer of
coarse sand in first, and then cover this with a layer of finer material to
guarantee that the column will not be part .of the effluent. The sand should

be boiled and leached with HCl, or better, be made from glass.

The cholce between sand and glass wool ge a8 column support 1s mostly a
matter of personal preference. A glass wool colum plug 18 made by cutting
off a short piece of fiber, wetting it, rolling . into a ball, and pushing
this to the bottom of the column with a rod.

The pressure of air used in pushing solutions through columms is
regulated by a diaphragm reducing valve with a scale reading from zero to

4. Preparation snd Standardization of Tracers and the
Calculations Involved in their Use

In analyses for the beta emitters m231 and 234 m230 is the best

tracer since no daughters grov into it within a time that could affect the
mpalysis. It 1s desirable to use around 10,000 ¢/m of 230 grecer. It 1s
well to have on hand several standards made with the amount of tracer being
used in the analysis; then the chemical yield is determined by a ratio of
sample-to-standard counted very close together, thus eliminating any small
error due to change in response of the alpha counter.

The beta counting efficiencies for m231 and 3% are determined by

39
PROCEDURE 9 (Cont'd.)

mixing a known amount of 230 tracer with a known quantity of the appropriate
wanium parent, either u?35 or 3, After a perchloric acid fuming to
guarantee exchange and eliminate the nitrate that is probably present, the
solution is diluted to 2 to 3M in "5 ion concentration and an AG 50-X4 column
step performed as in the last step of the fission product decontamination
(Step 9), with the one’ exception that a drop or two of 0.5M HaBro, is added
to the initial solution and to the wash to insure that the uranium will be
present as U(VI). T(VI) behavés the same as Th(IV) on this column and will
lead to enougi deposit an the plate to cause errors in the alpha counting.
The directions for obtaining large quantities of mm?23L or m2

tracers are given under- Section 5C.

for use as
: 231 228

The best tracer to use in analysis for Th is Th, as free from
229 ae possible. Since 230 and 228 are both alpha emitters, the final
plate 1s pulse-analyzed to get the ratio of the two. The alpha energy of
229 (as compared to that of 228) 1s 80 much closer to that of m23° that
tail corrections are much larger and more subject to error when ad is
present 1n the 228 tracer. This tracer ie made by the (a,2n) reaction on

It 1s possible to standardize a solution of mm 228 by allowing it to

decay until all its daughters are at equilibrium, then alpha counting it
and subtracting the contribution of the rest of the decay chain. It is,
however quicker and more rellable to mix accurately-measured quantities
of 228 and a known mh?3° solution, fume with HC1O, , and then separate
"from daughter activities with an AG 50-Xi column ae in Step 9 of the regular
fission product purification. The resultant plete 1s pulse-analyzed to get
the ratio of ThZ20 to ThZ3° which, when multiplied by the slpma count of
m23°, gives the correct alpha count rate for Th22 . If this tracer is to be
used for an appreciable length of time, a decay correction for its 1.9 year
half-life will have to be made. There is another correction to be made in
pulse analyses involving Th 228 me energy from L.6% of the alphas of the
RaZ2* daughter of 228 coincides with the alpha peak of Th220, The time of
last separation of the daughter is noted. This 1s the time when the last HCl
wash comes off the last AG 50-Xh column.

This parent-daughter relationship falls into the classification of tren~
slent equilibrium, where the equation of radioactive decay is simplified to

‘the following:

where the subscript 2 refers to Ra and 1 refers to Th22 . N is constant
for the times involved, so it is convenient to make up a plot of N/K against
time using the above equation. The elapsed time from the end of the HCl wash
on the last cation exchenge column to the midpoint of the pulse analysis 1s
noted on the curve, the fraction N/K read from the gm ph, multiplied by
0.046, and subtracted from the counts under the Th220 peak.

To get the counting rate of 23° in a sample with Th? “tracer, the
ratio of the rn 230 fp, 228 peaks is multiplied by the alpha counting rate of

SA. Procedure for Thorium Isotopes in a Solution of Fisslon Products

Step 1. Pipet the tracer into an Erlenmeyer flask of the proper size;
use a 50-ml flask when the volume of sample plus tracer 1s less than 10 to 15
ml; a 125-Erlenmeyer for 12 to 50 ml. Plpet the sample into the flask, using
a clean pipet for each sample so that the solution wlll not become contaminated
with the tracer. Add a few drops of .Fe carrier (carrier sclution 10 mg iron
per ml) and about 1 ml of conc. BC10,,. Evaporate to dense white fumes and con-
tinue heating for at least 2 minutes after their first appearance. This
evaporation is most rapidly done over & Fisher burner, but if there is no
hurry it may be done using an air Jet and either a hot plate or an oll bath.
Cool and add 10 to 15 ml of H,0 and transfer to a short-taper hO-ml centrifuge
tube.” There may be a fine-gralned residue of 810, in the Erlenmeyer, but
thorium loss at this point is not very great. }

Step 2. Add an excess of conc. NE) OH, mix well, centrifuge, and discard
the supernate.

Step 3. Dissolve the precipitate from Step 2 in 1 ml of 3M HCl and dilute
with H,0 to half the volume of the tube. Add ‘conc. NE) OH to precipitate the
hydroxide, centrifuge, and discard the supernate.

Step 4, Dissolve the precipitate from Step 3 in about 5 ml of 3M HCl.

If there is a very heavy precipitate of Fe(OH), it may be necessary to add
more 3M HCl to obtain complete solution. Again ignore a small residue of 510,

Prepare a column 0.6 cm in diameter and ebout 7 cm in height filled with
AG 50-X4k, 50-100 mesh resin. Pour the HCl solution onto the top of the resin
and allow to run through by gravity. Wash the columm with 10 ml of 3M HCl end
discard both the wash and the first effluent. Put a 50-ml Erlenmeyer contain-
ing 1 ml each of conc. HC10, and HNO, under the column and add 3.5 ml of O.5M
H,C.0, to the top and allow this to pass through by gravity.

Step 5. Evaporate the solution from Step 4 to dense white fumes and con-
tinue heating for about a minute.

ha
PROCEDURE 9 (Cont'd.)

Step 6. Transfer the solution to a L4O-ml long-taper centrifuge tube and
rinse the contents of the flask into it with 2 ml of come. HCl. Add 2 to 3
drops of 0.5M NaBr0, and saturate with HCl gas while the tube is surrounded
by water at room temperature. Prepare a wash solution by adding a few drops
of NaBro, to conc. HCl and saturate it at the same time.

Step 7. Prepare two columns for each sample. The diameter of each column
is 0.6 cm and each 1s filled to a height of about 7 cm with AG 1-X8 or AG 1-X10,
100-200 mesh resin. Add the solution from Step 6 to the top of one of the
columns and collect the effluent in a dry centrifuge tube. Rinse the original
tube and column with about 1.0 to 1.5 ml of the wash solution prepared ln Step
6. Combine this wash with the effluent end pass through the second column.
Rinse this 1n the same manner as the first and collect the combined effluents
in a@ 50-ml Erlenmeyer. It may be desirable to use very light air pressure to
push the solution through these two columns.

Step 8. Evaporate the solution fram Step T to 2 to 3 ml and add 1 ml of
conc. HNO, and 0.5 ml of conc. HE1O, , and continue heating untill dense white
- fumes ave been evolved for about a minute. Cool and add 2 ml of water.

Step 9. Prepare a column 0.35 cm by about 7 cm filled with 100-200 mesh
AG 50-Xh resin. Pour the solution from Step 8 on the top of the column and
force it through with light pressure (2 to 3 1b). Wash the colum with 4.5
ml of 6M HCl and discard this wash and the first effluent. Add 0.3 to 0.4
ml of 0.5M H,C.0, and push down the column with very slight pressure. Make
sure that the leading edge of the oxalic acid band does not get to the bottom
of the resin and get discarded with.the other effluent. Add O.7 ml of O.5M
H,C.0, to the top of the column and collect the sample on a 5-ml Pt plate.

If 1t is for alpha counting only, use a 1-3/4" to 2" diameter plate. If beta
counting 1s to be performed also, the sample is collected on a 1" diameter
plate. The samples are dried under heat lamps and are left there umtll most
of the H,C.0), is sublimed. Then they are heated to red heat in a flame.

5B. Thorium Procedure for Coral or Limestone Samples

Step 1. Dissolve 100 to 125 g of coral (accurately weighed) in 250 ml of
conc. ENO, and make up to 500 ml with HO. This gives a solution containing
about 0.2 g of coral per ml. ‘

Step 2. Add a 50 ml aliquot of the well-mixed solution to a 90-ml cen-
trifuge tube together with 1 ml of m3 (see Section 5C) tracer solution mnd
1 ml of Fe carrier. Stir and heat in hot water bath for an hour; then cool (Hote 1).

Step 3. Add canc. NH, OH slowly with stirring until Fe (0H), precipitates
and then centrifuge for 5 minutes (Note 2).

conc. ERO, and with H,0 wash the solution into a Pt dish. Add 10 ml of cond.
H ) and 5 m! of conc. HF.

Step 6. Take to fumes of HC10, three times, washing the sides of the dish
with water after each fuming (Note 3).

Step 7. Dilute the HC10, solution to about 25 ml with E,0.

Step 8. The first colum (4 x 150 mm with 40-ml reservoir) is filled with
an AG 50-X4, 200-400 mesh resin-water mixture and packed to ebout 120 mm. Wash
the resin with 3M HC10,, and add the solution from Step 7. Allow to flow at
atmospheric pressure or ad)ust the pressure to give a flow of about one drop
every 30 sec.

Step 9. When the solution reaches the resin, add 3M HCl acid in several
l-ml portions, washing down the sides of the column. Continue until the ferric
chloride color disappears.

Step 10. Elute the Th with 0.5M H,C.0), (2 to 3 ml), catching the effluent
in a centrifuge tube. Add to the H,C,0y solution 5 ml of conc. HNO, and 5 ml
of conc. HClO, and take to fumes of HC10, three times, washing the beaker down

mh? 15 isolated from a solution of oralloy, approximately 93.5% v3 ,
and 234 is obtained from normal urenium end the h?3t present allowed to
decay. For preparation of tracer using either of these thorium isotopes, the
Pinal step is an AG 50-Xk4 cation exchange column as in the determination of
comnting efficiency of Th>3' or Th?3* under Section k, except that the final
oxalic acid effluent is fumed nearly to dryness with 1 ml each of conc. ERO,
and HC10,, If an emount of uranium up to about a gram 1s sufficient to supply
the amount of tracer needed, the AG 50-XA column can be used as 1n Section k,
except that the final oxalic acid effluent is fumed nearly to dryness with 1
ml each of conc. ERO, and EC10, . "If an amount of uranium up to about a gram
is sufficient to supply the amount of tracer needed, the AG 50-X4 column can
be used as in Section 4. Bources of 23% or mn23% can be milked from a "cow!
of the appropriate uranium isotope adsorbed on an AG 1-X8 column. The uranium
is dissolved in conc. HCl, and some oxidizing agent such as bromate ion or bro-
mine water or chlorine gas 18 used to oxidize the uranium to U(VI). The
solution is then saturated with HCl gas at room temperature and adsorbed on
an AG 1-X8 column.

For 10 g of uranium a column aout 25 mm in diameter and holding 150 to
200 ml of resin bed is satisfactory. The resin is pre-washed with conc. HCl
containing about 0.5 ml of 2M NeBr0, per 100 ml of acid. The uranium solution
is parsed through the column and then re-cycled two or three times to get more
of i, adsorbed. Then the column is washed with about twice the resin bed
volume of conc. HCl containing a drop or two of the bromate solution. After
a suitable growth time for the thorium daughter, the column 18 treated with
conc, HCl as above. The solution is evaporated to a small volume, fumed with
1 ml each of conc. HERO, and HClO, and treated with an AG 50-X4 column as in
Section 4. A 3% source reading over 1 roentgen was prepared from 2 kg of

oralloy as follows: the uranium metal was dissolved in an excess of conc.

at about 118°.

This is the boiling point of UO 2{NO0, ), © 6H, 0. This solution freezes at
about 60° , 80 it can be cooled to 0 to 30s and fae molten hexahydrate poured
into a 5-liter separatory funnel containing about 3 to 4 liters of diethyl
ether that is being rapidly stirred with an eir-driven stirrer. This must
be Jone in a good hood with explosion-proof fixtures, or out of doors. As
long as the molten hexahydrate is added in a slow stream to the ether with
good stirring, ‘the operation is perfectly safe and the ether losses are not too
large, since the vapor pressure of the ether decreases rapidly aes the uranium
1s dissolved. It 1s a far more rapid and easler operation to add the molten
hexahydrate than it 1s to c 'ystellize it and &dd the crystals. The final
solution in ether from the 2 kg of oralloy should have a volume of about 4
liters. An aqueous layer of about 600 ml 1s withdrawn. The ether solution is
scrubbed with three 3-ml portions of H, 0 to insure complete removal of any
thorium that might be present. Th 231 te allowed to grow for 1 to 2 days and
then is removed with three 3-ml portions of H,0. This aqueo-:: layer is shaken
with two 200-ml portions of ether to remove more of the uranium. The
residual water layer 1s first evaporated on a steam bath to remove ether, then
fumed with 1 ml each of conc. HRW. and EC10, and the AG 50-X4 column used as in

Los Alamos Report LA-172l. Jan. 1958
l. Introduction

In the separation of thorium from large amounts of fission products
(10%? fissions or more), four principal decontaminstion steps are employed:
(1) Th(I0 N precipitation gives separation from the rare earths.

(2) T(c 20) precipitation effects separation from zirconium.

45
PROCEDURE 10 (Cont'd.)

(3) Ion exchange from a concentrated (greater than 12M) hydrochloric acid
solution on a Dowex A-l1 anlon resin results in the adsorption of
zirconium, iron, meptunium, mlutonium (VI), and uranium (VI), the
thorium passing through the column.

(4) Extraction of thorium from ¢ aluminum nitrate - nitric acid solution
by means of mesityl oxide (cay), C=CH- c - CH) gives excellent

decontamination from the alkall sand alkaline earth metal ions
{including radium), lanthanum, and cerium. This e: raction is
ineffective for the separation c¢~ thorium from zorconium, plutonium
(V1), and uranium (VI), and gives only poor decontamination from
neptunium.
Thorium is finally precipitated as the oxalate and 1gnited to the dioxide,
in which form it is mounted and weighed. The yleld is 70 to 80%, and quadrup-
licate analyses can be carried out in approximately 8 hours.

L. Preparation and Stendardization of €arrier

If the purity of the thorium 1s known, the metal may be weighed out
directly as a primary standard. It is dissolved on a steam bath in a small
excess of concentrated HNO, in a Pt dish, with periodic additions of small
amounts of O.1M HF. If thorium nitrate is used as carrier, it is dissolved in

about 0,001M HHO, and filtered. To a 10.00 ml aliquot (four stendaraizatioms

are usually carried out) of the carrier, 10 drops of cone. HCl are added and
the solution is boiled over a Fisher burner. Four ml of staurated B,C.0, are
then added and the solution 1s bolled for 2 min. The thorium oxalate pre-
cipitate is filtered through No. L42 Whatman filter paper (9 cm) in a 2", 60°
funnel and washed with about 1 percent H,C.0, solution (the saturated solution
is diluted 1 to 10). The precipitate 1s transferred to a tared porcelain
crucible (Coors 000) and is carefully ignited at 900° for 1 hour. The carrier
is weighed as Tho,,.

5. Procedure

Step 1. Into a 4O0-ml short taper centrifuge tube, pipet 2.0 ml of
standard Th carrier; add the fisslon product solution and 5 drops of La
carrier. Precipitate Th(OH), by means of an excess of conc. NH, OH, centri-
fuge, and discard the supernate.

Step 2. To the precipitate add 8 ml of cone. ERO, 15 ml of H,0, end 7
ml of 1M HIO,. Centrifuge the Th(105),, precipitate and discard the supernate.
Wash the precipitate with.1l5 ml of a solution which is 4M in HNO_ and 0.25M in
HIO,. Centrifuge and discard the supernate.

Step 3. To the precipitate add 1 ml of canc. HCl and 5 drops of Zr hold-
back carrier. Heat with stirring over en open flame until the precipitate
dissolves and the solution boils. Dilute to 5 ml and bubble in 80, £88 until
the solution becomes essentially colorless. Dilute to 10 ml and boil until the
solution is water white. Add 4 ml of saturated H,C,0, solution and continue
boiling for about 1 min. Centrifuge the oxalate precipitate and discard the
supernsate.

Step 4. To the precipitate add 1 ml of conc. ENO, and about 100 mg of
solid KC10,. Heat cautiously to boiling to destroy oxalate. Dilute to 15 ml

and precipitate Th(OH)), by means of an excess of conc. KE, OH. Centrifuge and

discard the supermnate.

Step 5. Add 10 drops of cone. HCl to the precipitate and bubble in HCL
gas through a transfer pipet until the solution 1s saturated. With the aid of
a hypodermic syringe and the same pipet, transfer the solution (which hae a
volume of approximately 1 ml) onto a Dowex A-1 anion resin (10% cross-link)
column (Before use, ‘the resin column is ‘treated with a
wash solution made up by adding 1 drop of come. ERO, (Note 1) to 20 ml of conc
HCl end saturating with HCl gas at room temperature.) By means of air
pressure , force the sample solution through the column in
approximately 3 min, but do not allow the meniscus to go below the top of the
resin. The effluent is collected in a 4O-ml short taper centrifuge tube. Add

1 ml of the resin wash solution to the original centrifuge tube end transfer
the washings by means of the same pipet onto the column. The washings are
forced through the column in the same manner as the semple solution, and are
collected along with the sample solution. This wash - y be rep ted.

Step 6. Dilute the collected semp.. plus washes to ap~—oximately 25 ml
and make the solution basic with conc. NH, OH. Centrifuge the Th(OH)), preclipi-
tate and discard the supermate.

Step 7. Dissolve the precipitate with 6 drops of 6M E ES Use 10 ml of
2.4 m(m0,), - 1.4 ENO, mixture (hereafter called the extraction mixture) to
transfer the semple solution to a 60-ml separatory funnel. Add 10 ml of
mesityl oxide to the separatory funnel, shake for 15-20 sec, and discard the
water (lower) layer. Wash the mesityl oxide layer twice with 5-ml portions of
extraction mixture, discarding each washing. Back-extract the thorium with two
5-ml washes of distilled H,0, collecting both H,0 layers in a 40-ml short taper
centrifuge tube. Dilute to 15 ml and add 8 ml of conc. ERO, and 7 ml of 1M HIO
(Note 2). Centrifuge the Th(105)), precipitate and wash as in Step 2.

Step 8. Repeat Steps 3, 4, 5, and 6.

Step 9. To the Th(OH), precipitate, add 5 drops if Bi carrier and 10
drops of conc. E50, - Dilute to 10 ml and saturate the solution with HS.
Filter through a No. LO Whatman filter paper (9 cm) in a 2", 60° funnel,
collecting the filtrate in a 4O-ml short taper centrifuge tube. Wash the pre-
cipitate with a small amount of water and combine the wash with the filtrate;
discard the precipitate. Maske the filtrate basic with conc. NH) OH, centrifuge,
and discard the supernate.

Step 10. Repeat Step T.

Step 11. Repeat Step 3, but do not add Zr holdback carrier end do not
centrifuge the oxalate precipitate.

Step 12. Filter the hot solution containing the oxalate precipitate onto
a 15/16" Ro. 42 Whatman filter circle, using a ground-Hirsch funnel and filter
chimey (see illustration 2). Wash the precipitate with 1% H,C,0, solution.

l. The purpose of the HNO, is to maintain an oxidizing medium on the
resin to prevent reduction of Pu(VI).

2. At this point the solutlon will be somewhat colored as a result of
oxidation of dissolved mesityl oxide. This, however, does not affect the
results.

6. P-Counting of Th
Whenever Th p activities such as isotopes 231, 233, and 234 are counted
and Th?32 is used as carrier, one 1s faced with the problem of the growth of B
activities from the carrier. Examination of the decay chein of M232 shows

that the amount of B activity depends upon the quantity of m228 present. In

the chain the longest lived parent of m228 (half-life 1.9 y) is Ra220, the
half-life of which is 6.7 y. Thus, the amount of Th? 228 present in 232 depends
upon the time of separation of Ra228, The Pp emitters succeeding M228 grow in
essentially with the half-life of Ra22H which is 3.64 4. Therefore, the B
activity that one observes from natural Th which has had all of its decay
products chemically removed grows in with a 3.64 d half-life. One mg of
natural Th in equilibrium with its decay producte has 494 disintegretions per
minute ° B activity. Since ome does not usually know the history of the Th
used as carrier, the moet convenient way to correct for these coun... is the

fo owing:

Pipet out as much carrier solution as will glve approximately the same
weight as a true sample would when carried through the whole separation
procedure. Perform Steps 9 through 13 of the procedure. Note the time
of the last mesltyl nxlde  msh of Step 10. After the sample is mounted,
count 1t every few hours over & period of several days. It is convenient
to use the time of he last mesityl oxlde wash as t . In this manner, one
can correct for the growth of betas from the carrier.
The counting of m23t is rather difficult because of its week Pf radiations
[0.302 (44%), 0.216 (11%), 0.09% (k5%)]. This. isotope has nine y-rays ranging
in energy from 0.022 to 0.230 Mev. Since the efficiency of y-counting, even
with 1 in. Nel crystals, is quite low, one usually counts the betas. This means
that extreme care must be taken to insure uniform thickness of samples. mh?33

and 23% do not present such difficulty. The former has a 1.23 Mev p and decays

50
PROCEDURE 10 (Cont'd.)

to pa?33 which has a 0.530 Mev B. The latter, although it has week radiations,
decays into Pa23% (1.175 m) which bas a very strong B.

7. Absolute p-Counting of Some Th Isotopes

The relation between counts and disintegrations for thorium isotopes of
mass numbers 231, 233, and 234 can be obtained from y?32, mp3, and ¥?38,
235 238

respectively. If a weighed quantity of U or U is taken, Th carrier added,
and a chemical separation of Th made, one can calculate in each case the number
of Th disintegrations present. By counting the sample and correcting for decay
from time of separation, one has a direct relationship between counts and dis-
integrations. The self-absorption of the sample can be taken into account by
the use of this technique on several different weights of Th carrier with
identical specific activity. ror example, one adds 100 mg of Th carrier to a
weighed amount of either y?3° or 238 mixes the solution thoroughly, takes
several aliquots of different sizes, and separates the thorium. In this way, one
can plot a curve of sample weight vs disintegrations.

In the case of Th?33 the situation is somewhat different. The decay
product of this isctope is Pa’33, which is also the immediate decay product
of wp23T, By separating pa?33 from a known weight of np237 and counting the
former, one has a direct relationship for pa?33 of counts vs disintegrations.
For a sample of mhe33 one takes two known aliquots, differing by a factor of
about 1000 in activity. (The ratio of Pa’33 to Th%3S half-lives if 1693.5.)
The wesker aliquot is counted for mh?33 immediately upon separation of Pa.
The stronger one is permitted to decay until it is all pa?33 and is then
counted. From the previous (p237y calibration one then can find the disin-
tegrations of pa?33 for this sample. The sample is corrected for decay back to
the time the wesker sample was counted for 233, thus obtaining the number of

atoms of the latter when the aliquot correction is made.

l. Introduction

The older procedure for the determination of m3 ux, ) activity in
fission material depended on the separation of 23h with the rare-earth
fraction and on a later removal with thorium carrier. The procedure
described here is much improved and shortened.

Thorium is used as & carrier for its isotope UX,. Thorium iodate, together
with zbrconlium activity, precipitates from a come. HNO, solution on the addition
of HIO, » but the other fission products, including the trivalent rare earths
(cerium is present in the reduced state), remain in solution. Thorium is then
precipitated as the oxalate from a solution containing zirconium holdback
carrier. Xrconium remains in salution as the soluble oxalate complex. The
thorium oxalate is ignited to the oxide, mounted, and counted for ox, activity.

2. Procedure

Btep 1. To an appropriate amount of uwrsnyl nitrate in a 50-ml centrifuge
tube, add a known amount of thorium carrier (about 20 mg) and 10 mg each of
cerium(IIT), lenthenum, and yttrium carriers (Note). Add 8 ml of come. HO,
warm on a steam bath, and stir zu ml of 0.35M HIO, into the solution. Recard
the time of precipitation. The mixture is cooled in an ice beth with stirring.

Step 2. The Th(I0,),, precipitate is dissolved in 5 ml of conc. HCl, and
10 mg each of cerium(IIT), lanthanum, and yttr... carriers and 10 +- 5 ml of
E,0 are added. The centrifuge tube is placed . ice bath, and 80, is passed

1. Introduction

The precipitation of thorium with HF and KF (probably as K,ThF,) removes
mh234 (ux) from uranium and the fission products except the rare earths, zirco-
nium, and the alkaline earths. The addition of zirconium holdback carrler
markedly reduces the coprecipitation of zirconium. Large amounts of uo," cause
some oF, to come down with the fluoride precipitawc; this 1s re. _1y removed
by washing the precipitate with 6M HF.

The dolution of the thorium precipitate 1s accomplished by warming with
HNO, and HBO. The precipitation of Th(OH)), removes the alkaline-earth con-
tamination. Additional decontamination from all the fission products except
zirconium end niobium (columbium) is brought about by the precipitation of
Th(10,)), from a 4M HNO, solution. The precipitation of thorium with oxmlic acid
serves as an additional separation from zirconium and niobium and also converts

the thorium to a welghable form.

2. Procedure

Step 1. To 5 ml or less of uranium and fission-product ple in a
lusteroid tube, add 1 ml of conc. HNO, , 20 mg of standard thorium carrier, and
10 mg of zirconium holdback carrier. Dilute to 20 ml and add 3 ml of conc. HF
and 3 ml of GM KF. Centrifuge, and wash with 5 to 10 ml of 6M HF.

Step 2. Dissolve the precipitate with 2 ml of 6 percent HBO, and 2 ml of
conc. HKO, (Rote 1). Dilute to about 15 ml, add 5 mg of barium holdback carrier,

less. Add 5 ml of conc. NH, OH and centrifuge.

5 mg of Ce(III) carrier, 0.5 ml of 3 percent B,0,, and 20 ml of 0.35M HIO,.
Cool, and let the Th(I05)), precipitate stand for 5 min. Centrifuge, and wesh

weighing as in the rare-earth procedures (Note 3). Count without excessive
delay (Note 4).

3. The precipitate is weighed as Th(C,0, ),,-5H,0. The carrier must be
standardized in the same manner.

4. The thorium precipitate should not be allowed to stand very long

3 may be necessary if much lanthanum was

before the activity measurements are made, since the pB-active disintegration
products of thorium contribute an increesingly larger fraction of the total
activity with time.

3. Discussion

The procedure has been tested by using carrier-free tracers of cerium,
yttrium, ruthenium, strontium, zirconium, and tellurium. The final thorium
oxalate precipitate was contaminated to the extent of 0.06 percent of the
gross added tracer activity.

Opne- to two-tenths of a milligram of zirconium nitrate and sufficient
lodic acid solution to give a final iodate concentration of 0.05M were added
per milliliter of solution of u?33 in 0.1K nitric acid. The precipitated
zirconium iodate was washed by centrifugation, dissolved in sulfur dioxide-
water, heated to remove liberated iodine, diluted, and the zirconium
reprecipitated with iodic acid. Four to five of these cycles served to de-
contaminate completely from uratium, radium, and most of the actinium. Bismuth
and lead activities were removed by ome or two lead sulfide by-product
precipitates.

In order to prepare samples sufficlently free from carrier for alpha-
particle range measurements in the pulse analyzer, and to remove any traces of
actinium activity, the following procedure was used. The thorium lsotopes were
co-precipitated from the final zirconium iodate solution with lanthanum fluoride
carrier (0.1-0.2 mg/ml), the fluoride precipitate was metathesized to hydroxide
with concentrated potassium hydroxide and the hydroxide dissolved in O.05M
nitric acid. Separation of the thorium activity from the lanthanum carrier was
accomplished by extraction with a solution of 0.15M thenoyl trifluoracetone
(TTA) in benzene. The change from zirconium to lanthanum carrier was necessary
since the former extracts into TTA solution under the canditions used, whereas
the latter does not. In some cases, TTA extraction of the thorium isotopes was
made directly from the uranium solution. The TTA benzene solution was in either
case evaporated directly on the counting plate or reextracted with 8F nitric
acid and the latter solution evaporated. Ignition of the resulting ple .s left
an essentially weightless film of the thorium activity.

Abstract

In order to study the geochemistry of thorium lsotopees in the hydrosphere,
particularly in the ocean, a method has been worked out by which Th232, Th?

228 an eet can be determined separately. Eight samples of 20 to 40 liters

PROCEDURE 17 (Cont 'd.)

of sea-water, from 23.0 % to 34.97 % salinity, were collected in Rovember
1953, in the Skegerak and the Gullmarfjord (Sweden). Thorium was isolated by
the following procedure: Just after collection, the samples were brought to pF
2.and a given amount of Tn23% ( ) wae added as tracer. Thorium was first
precipitated with Fe(OH), as carrier. Further purification was obtained by ion-
exchange column chromatography followed by solvent extraction; the final
fraction was obtained as the citric complex, a form suitable to incorporation

in the photographic emulsion. The total yield varied from 1 to 23% according

to the sample, as determined by the P activity of the tracer. The various Th
isotopes were measured through their «a activity, using nuclear photographic epul-
sions, more precisely the double-ermulsion techni gue. RdTh and RdAc both generate
five-branched stars; more than 90% of these originated from RdTh, as indicated
by the length of the tracks: while Io and Th only yield single tracks of

range 18.8 pu and 15 p respectively in the emulsion. Most samples showed a much
1¢ :r activity then expected; this did not make it possible to discriminate
between Io and Th through the range distribution of their tracks, thus we could
only ascertain upper limite of Io and Th concentrations.

gave an activity of about 9,000 counts per minute (c/m) at the highest
geometry factor used. }

The uranium was precipitated from this volume with base, and the pre-
cipitate was dissolved in 1 ml of acid solution and transferred to a 3-ml
lusteroid test tube. This transfer caused no detectable loss. Lanthanum
carrier (0.25 mg) was added and precipitated with KF. The precipitate was

Discussion

From the characteristics of the elution peaks from the fluoride columms,
1t seems more likely that negative fluoride complexes are sorbing rather than
that insoluble fluorides are precipitating in the resin. The behavior of Ra is
surprising as formation of a negative complex seems rather unlikely and RaF, is
not particularly insoluble. It has been suggested that Ra may be coprecipitat-

ing with CaF, which is much more insoluble.

products, fluoride, uranium-234 end -238, neptunium-237, and plutonium-239. The
present method (60) for the radiochemical determination of the thorium
isotope, thorium-23L4 (ux), in the presence of uranium and fission products is
satisfactory, as the gamma radloactivity mey be counted efficiently in the
presence of the thorium carrier prescribed. However, a carrier-free method was
desired for the determination of ionium to avoid self-absorption losses of the
alpha particles. The method for wy does not provide for the separation of

neptunium and plutonium. A method for the determination of ionium in coral

limestond® appears rather lengthy, because both anion and cation exchange steps
are necessary to eliminate the plutonium interference.

The radiochemical method described gives satisfactory results on uranium
ash process solutions. Most interferences are eliminated by a combination of
lanthanum hydroxide and fluoride precipitations which carry the ionium quantita-
tively. Uranium, neptuntun and plisbonium are effectively eliminated by mainte n-
ing them in the £1uoride-soluble sexivalent oxidation state. The lanthanum
fluorlde technique is en adaptation c of the familiar nethod®of carrying
plutonium (111, v) in the presence of plutonium (VI). Iron (III) forme =e

plate for alpha: counting,

 

Procedure

Pipet a suitable aliquot ¢ of the sample solution into a 5-sl. Pyrex Brand
8060 centrifuge cone. Add o. i ml. of. lanthanum carrier (5 mg. per ml.) and mix
well with 8 GLASS, sbiTTel Add 1 ml. of 19 M sodium hydroxide, mix well,
and digest for 5 ninites at room temperature. Centrifuge in a clinical
centrifuge for 3 minutes. Remove the supernatant solution with mild suction.
Wash the nrecipitate by stirring with 2 to 3 ml. of 0.05 MN sodium hydroxide.
Centrifuge for 3 minutes, remove the supernatant solution, and repeat the wash
step.

Dissolve the precipitate in several drops of concentrated nitric acid and
"add 8 to 10 drops in excess. Add 0.3 ml. of O.4 M potassium dichromate, mix
well, and digest for 10 minutes in a beaker of water at approximately bolling
temperature. Add 0.3 ml. of 2T M hydrofluoric acid, mix well; and digest at room
temperature for 5 minutes. Centrifuge for 3 minutes. Add 0.05 ml. of
lanthanum carrier and stir the’ ‘supernatant solution, being careful not to dis-

turb the precipitate. "Digest for 2 minutes at room temperature. Centrifuge
PROCEDURE 20 (Cont'd.)

for 3 minutes and carefully remove the supernatant solution, leaving about 1
drop. Wash the precipitate by stirring with 0.5 ml. of 1 M hydrofluoric acid-

1 M nitric acid containing 1 drop of 0.4 MN potassium dichromate. Centrifuge for
3 minutes, remove the supernatant solution, and wash the precipitate with 0.5
ml. of 1 M hydrofluoric acid-l M nitric acid.

Dissolve the lanthanum fluoride precipitate by adding 0.5 ml. of 2 M
aluminum nitrate and several drops of 1 M nitric acid. Carefully transfer the
solution to a 10-ml. beaker using several distilled water washes. Adjust the
pH to 1.4 to 1.5 with a pH meter and extract for 10 minutes with a one-half
volume portion of 0.5 M thenoyltrifluorcacetone-xylene. After centrifugation,
evaporate an aliquot of the organic phase on a platinum or stainless steel
disk, fleme to a red heat, cool to room temperature, and count in a proportional
alpha counter. An alpha energy analyzer is useful for occasionally checking the
disks, when small amounts of lonium are determined in the presence of high
levels of other alpha radloactivities.

If radium, protactinium, americium, or curium 1s not present, omit the final
extraction step. Blurry the lanthanum fluoride precipitate with several drops
of 1 M nitric acid and transfer quantitatively to a platinum or stainless steel
disk. Rinse the cone with three 3-drop portions of distilled water, transferring
the rinses to the disk. Dry under an infrared heat lamp, flame to a red heat,
and count the disk in a proportional alpha counter. .

The initial hydroxide precipitation may be omitted if the sample solution

does not contain aluminum or chromium.

Discussion
The procedure described yields 97 * 3% on process solutions. Most losses
are in the pH adjustment prior to the final extraction. By rinsing the centri-
fuge cone with seversl distilled water washes before pH adjustment and by using
several portions of the organic phase to wash the beaker afterwards, essentially

quantitative recovery of ionium can be effected. Quadruplicate analysis of a

63.
PROCEDURE 20 (Cont'd.)

dilute nitric acid solution containing 1.4 x 10° alpha counts per minute per
milliliter of ionium gave 99.4, 98.0, 98.1, and 99.5% recovery, which is
satisfactory for a carrier-free technique. The radiochemist may desire to apply
a yleld correction for the lonium recovery, particularly if many chemical
separations are performed. The beta, gamma emitter, thorium-234 (ux), is very
useful in such cases.

' The major alpha radioactivity present in this particular process was
neptunium-237 along with much smaller amounts of plutonium-239 and uranium-23k4
and -238. Decontamination from these alpha emitters was satisfactory. A
solution containing 2 x 10° alpha counts per minute per milliliter of neptunium-

3 alpha counts per minute per milliliter of ionium was analyze

237 and 5.6 x 10
by the prescribed procedure. An alpha energy analysis of the final plate
indicated pure ionium with no neptunium-237 detected. This analysis should be
performed occasionally, if very low levels of lonium are being determined in the
presence of high concentrations of other aipha emitters.

Although radium, polonium, protactinium, americium, and curium were not
detected in solutions of this particular process, these elements are often present
in uranium wastes. Radium will be eliminated in the hydroxide precipitation and
traces that do carry will be eliminated very effectively in the final extraction
of icnium. 2 Decontamination of ionlum from polonium was excellent: 0.02, 0.03,
0, 0.03, and 0.02% in five experiments. Solutions containing 7.6 x 10% alpha
counts per minute per milliliter of polonium-208 were analyzed using the ionlum
procedure. Analysis of the various seperated fractions in the procedure
indicated that essentially all of the polonium was in the oxidized supernatant
solution from the lanthanum fluoride precipitation. Thus, polonium behaves
like uranium, neptunium, and plutonium in the procedure. As quadrivalent
polonium readily carries on lanthanum fluoride from nitric acid solution, the
polonium may be in the sexivalent fluorilde-soluble state in the presence of
potassium dichromate. Approximately 50% of the protactinium originally present

remained in the supernatant solution as a fluoride soluble complex upon the pre-

(21
PROCEDURE 20 (Cont'd.)

cipitation of lanthanum fluoride. If protactinium-231 1s present, the lonium
should be stripped from the 0.5 M 2-thenoylfrifluorcacetone-xylene by stirring
with an equal volume of 2 M nitric acld for 5 minutes. Ionium strips quentita-
tively, leaving the protactinium in the organic phase. Typlecsdl decontamination

© data for protactinium in four experiments {including the final strip with 2 M
nitric acid) gave 0.03, 0.20, 0.07, and 0.05%. A 2M nitric acid solution con-
taiming 6.5 x 10° gamma counts per minute per mi11iliter of protactinium-233 was
analyzed in 1-ml. aliquots by the lonium procedure. The final 2 M nitric acid
strip solution wae counted for protactinlum-233 gamms radioactivity using e
scintillation counter having a sodium iodide crystal. Although it is rarely
necessary, the last traces of protactinium mey be removed by re-extracting the

2 M nitric acid strip solution with an equal volume of 0.5 M 2-thenoyltrifluoro-
acetone-xylene for 5 minutes. Americium and curium are readily eliminated along
with the lanthanum carrier when the lonium 1s extracted with thls reagent.

The method should prove useful in the carrler-free isolation of thorium
isotopes. Although the procedure hes been used specifically to determine ionlum
in uranium flaorination ash, 1t should be useful for the determination of
ionium in various waters and rocks. Ionium may be isolated from complex
mixtures of elements by lanthanum hydroxide and fluoride carrying, followe. by
extraction with 2-thenoyltrifluorcacetone-xylene. In analyzing materials con-
taining natural thorium, a final alpha energy analysis should be performed to

differentiate lonium from other thorium isotopes.
