'FROZEN-WALL FLUORINATOR DEVELOPMENT: EXPERIMENTS ON
INDUCTION HEATING IN A CONTINUOUS FLUORINATOR SIMULATION
Twenty-one additional ; runs were made in the continuous fluorinator
simulator to determine heat generation rates in nitric acid, in the pipe
surrounding the acid column, and in the induction coil. Three additional

induction coil designs were tested, and the effect of bubbles in the acid

on the heat generation: rate was determined, Results of the tests estab-

lished conditions that will allow induction heating to be used in a con-
tinuous fluorinator experiment in which the fluorinator vessel is pro-
tected from corrosion by a layer of frozen salt. Equations vere developed
for predicting heat generation rates in the molten salt, the induction
coil, and the fluorinator vessel. These equations predict a high effi-
ciency for heating molten salt in a fluorinator for one of the four coil

designs tested.

 SEMICONTINUOUS REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION EXPERIMENTS
IN A MILD-STEEL FACILITY

The new salt feed-and-catch tank was installed in. the system, and
iron oxide was partially removed from it and from the system by contacting
the equipment with nydiogen. Reductant was added to the bismuth, about
20 liters of salt (72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF o~ThF y) was charged to the sys-
tem to replace salt that had been aleuardes vith the original salt feed-

and~catch tank, and both phases were circulated through the system in

_ order to. ‘complete the removal of oxides. After. the addition of a small
amount of zirconium to restore ‘the system inventory to about 15 g, both
phases were treated: vith a 30% HF--H,, stream in order to remove oxides
from the salt. CL

About 1 g-equiv of - reductant, in the form of thorium and Li-Bi

alloy, was added to the treatment vessel for the purpose of establishing

8 ‘zirconium distribution coefficient value: in the range of 1 to 5. After

the bismuth and salt had been transferred to their respective feed tanks,

My tracer was added to ‘the salt. ~'Mass transfer experiment %TR- 1 was

 
 

 

 

. vi

then carried out using bismuth and salt flow rates of 216 ml/min and 99
ml/min, respectively. Counting of the flowing-stream samples showed

97

that no transfer of the ° Zr tracer had occurred. The reductant that

had been added to establish the proper D,_ value had apparently been -

Zr
oxidized by HF and FeF, which were present in the salt in the treatment

vessel.

DEVELOPMENT OF THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS:
INSPECTION OF EXPERIMENT MTE-2

The equipment used for metal transfer process experiment MTE-2, com-
pleted previously, was disassembled and inspected. Some blistering and
cracking of the 20-mil-thick nickel aluminide coating had occurred during
the 2370-hr period that the vessel had been held at 650°C. The vessel
was sectioned in a manner such that the salt and bismuth phases could
be observed. The salt and bismuth phases appeared to be clean, and
the interfaces were free of contamination. A black material which
covered the vessel wall in the fluoride compartment is thought to be

a mixture of salt and finely divided bismuth.

Deposits containing unusually high concentrations of rare earths
were observed on the 1ip and overflow spout of the Li-Bi alloy container
and in the bottom layer of the Th-Bi solution, The total quantities of
rare earths in these deposits were only 5 to 10% of the rare-earth in-

ventories in the system.

The inside of the carbon steel vessel appeared to be in good condi-
tion except for corrosion on items that were constructed of thin carbon
steel. The carbon steel pump, which used bismuth check valves, was in
good condition at the completion of the experiments (i.e., after being
operated to circulate a total of T02 liters of LiCl). |

DEVELOPMENT OF THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS:
AGITATOR TESTS FOR EXPERIMENT. MTE-3
Equipment was: constructed in order to test the shaft seal design
that is proposed for use in metal transfer experiment MTE-3. The system

in salt in a mechanically agitated system, and to evaluate a vapor-
deposited tungsten coating as a means for protecting carbon steel from

corrosion by molten salt and bismuth,

Several shaft seals were tested for various time periods at agita-
tor speeds ranging from 150 to 750 rpm. It was found that the seal life
could be increased and that the seal leakage rate was decreased consid-
erably by lubricating the seal with mineral oil. A seal design which
allowed satisfactory operation for T1 days ‘was Judged to be acceptable

for use in experiment MTE-3.

Unfiltered salt samples taken during a TUS-hr period in which salt
and bismuth were mechanically agitated showed that the concentration of
bismuth in the salt increased from 8 ppm to 200 ppm as the agitator |
PU was increased from 150 rpm to 750 rpm. During this period, the

concentration of nickel in the bismuth increased from 20 ppm to 1000

ppm, which indicated that the bismuth had penetrated the tungsten coating

on the interior of the test vessel, Inspection of the coating after

completion of the test revealed cracks in the coating in a number of

places. Also, it appeared that the coating had not been applied over

the entire surface of the drain line at the base of the test vessel. It

was concluded that protection of a vessel from attack by bismuth via'a

tungsten coating would be difficult because of the tendency for such a

- coating to crack.

DISTRIBUTION OF RADIUM BETWEEN LiCl AND Li-Bi SOLUTIONS
Data on the distribution of radium between molten LiCl and Li-Bi

solutions containing 13 to 35 mole % lithium were obtained previously

 .during metal transfer experiment MTE-2, ‘Additional data were obtained

by diluting a portion of the Li-Bi solution from the experiment (con-
taining radium) and equilibrating the resulting solution with LiCl at
650°C, All of the radium distribution data could be correlated well in

-the manner used previously for correlating distribution data for a large

number of elements if radium was assumed to be divalent in the LiCl

phase. It was found that the distribution characteristics for radium

 
 

viii

are quite similar to those of the divalent rare-earth and alkaline-
earth fission products (Sm, Eu, Sr, and Ba); in fact, the data for
radium and barium are almost identical.

~ DEVELOPMENT OF MECHANICALLY AGITATED SALT-METAL CONTACTORS

Efforts involving the development of mechanically agitated salt-
metal contactors of the Lewis cell type were continued. Preliminary
tests were carried out in contactors of several sizes and with differ-
“ent agitator configurations in order to determine the factors that will
limit the agitator speed in stirred-interface contactors. The agitator
speed was found to be limited by the transfer of the low-density (water)
phase via entrainment in the circulating high-density (mercury) phase.
The limiting agitator speed was essentially independent of the size and
shape of the contactor but was strongly dependent on the agitator diam-
eter, A test made with a low-melting alloy and water, which resulted in
‘a density difference of 7.1 rather than 12.6, indicated that the limiting
agitator speed is not highly dependent on the difference in densities
of the two liquid phases. It is believed that entrainment of salt in
the bismuth.in metal transfer experiment MTE-3 will occur at essentially
the same agitator speed as was observed with the mercury-water system
(300 rpm), and that the experiment should be operated initially with

agitator speeds well below this value.

Two tests were carried out for determining the rate at which bismuth
circulates between the two sides of a compartmented salt-metal contactor
containing a captive bismuth phase. These tests, in which mercury and
water were used rather than bismuth and salt, indicated mercury flow
rates of 11.2 and 19.3 liters/min for agitators (speed, 195 rpm in each.
case) having straight and canted blades respectively. It was concluded
that the bismuth circulation rate in metal transfer experiment MTE-3

will be adequate and much greater than the minimum desired value of 0.5

.liter/min.

ANALYSIS OF MULTICOMPONENT MASS TRANSFER BETWEEN
MOLTEN SALTS AND LIQUID BISMUTH DURING COUNTER-
CURRENT FLOW IN PACKED COLUMNS
The transfer of materials between a molten salt and liquid bismuth

results in a condition where the fluxes of the transferring ions are
dependent on both concentration gradients and ‘electrical potential gradi-
ents. This greatly complicates the mass transfer process and mekes the
design of continuous reductive extraction columns difficult. Calculations
were completed for both binary and multicomponent mass transfer in order

to determine the conditions under which the presence of an electric

potential gradient significantly alters the mass transfer rate. Con-

: ditions which typify I molten~salt--bismith and aqueous—organic ‘systems

were examined.

The effect of the electric potential gradient was found to be of
greater importance when the electrolyte is a molten salt than when it is
an aqueous solution. In the latter case, the nontransferring coions
redistribute in the electrolyte phase in a manner which suppresses the

effect of the electric potential gradient. However, it was shown that

significant errors in calculated mass transfer rate values will result

under some Ppsvating contitions in both cases.

Two cases involving reductive extraction of uranium from a molten

fluoride salt phase into a liquid bismuth phase containing reductant

indicate that neglect of the effect of an electric potential gradient

probably causes essentially no error in calculated mass transfer rates

for reductive extraction operations of interest in MSBR processing.

ENGINEERING STUDIES OF URANIUM OXIDE PRECIPITATION
Studies of the chemistry of protactinium and uranium oxide precip-
itation have indicated that oxide precipitation may be an attractive.

alternative process to fluorination--reductive extraction for isolating

- protactinium and removing uranium from the fuel salt of an MSER. . An

experimental facility has been designed and equipment is “being installed
in order to study the kinetics of uranium oxide precipitation, to investi-
gate the size distribution and settling characteristics of oxide precip-

-itate, and to gain experience with oxide precipitation systems.

 
 

 

The experimental facility will allow for batch precipitation studies
to be made in a b-in.-diam vessel containing approximately 2 liters of

72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeFp-ThF), salt that also contains UF) at an initial

concentration of about 0.3 mole %. Oxide will be supplied to the pre-

cipitator in the form of a water-argon gas mixture that will be introduced
through a l-in.-diam draft tube to promote contact of the salt and oxide.

The salt will be decanted to a receiver vessel after allowing the oxide

to settle for a short time. The facility also includes a system for

supplying hydrogen-HF gas mixtures that will be used for converting oxides
to fluorides at the conclusion of an experiment. The off-gas system
includes caustic scrubbers for removing HF from the precipitator off-gas |
stream in order that additional information relative to the extent of

precipitation of oxides can be obtained.

STUDY OF THE PURIFICATION OF SALT BY CONTINUOUS METHODS

Salt purification studies were continued on the continuous reduc-
tion of iron fluoride by countercurrent contact of the salt (72.0-1l.k-
13.6 mole % LiF-BeF,~ThF) ) with hydrogen in a packed column. Tests carried
out to investigate the possibility that iron particles in the molten salt
might be the cause of occasional high iron analyses showed that iron
particles are not present. Sampling tests with various sampler designs
showed that iron particles, if present, do not remain in the salt during

one pass through the experimental system; that iron analyses below 100

ppm are unreliable with sample sizes of 1 g or less; and that salt samples

taken in nickel samplers are more subject to iron contamination during

removal than samples taken in copper samplers. Comparison of flooding data

taken during the countercurrent flow of molten salt and argon indicate

. that flooding occurs at throughput values below those predicted by the

Sherwood correlation.

2. FROZEN-WALL FLUORINATOR DEVELOPMENT: EXPERIMENTS ON INDUCTION
HEATING IN A CONTINUOUS FLUORINATOR SIMULATION

J. R. Hightower, Jr,

An experiment to demonstrate the usefulness of layers of frozen salt
for protection against corrosion in a continuous fluorinator requires an
internal heat source that is not subject to corrosion by the molten salt.
High-frequency induction heating has been proposed for this purpose, and
the estimated performance’ of a frozen-wall fluorinator having an indue~
tion coil embedded in the frozen salt near the fluorinator wall has indi-
“cated that such a method may be. acceptable.’ However, there are uncer-
tainties associated with the effect of bubbles in the molten salt and
} with the amount. of heat that will. be. generated in the metal walls of the
fluorinator. Equipment hes. been installed” for studying. heat generation
in a simulated frozen-vall. fluorinator containing provisions for induc-
tion heating.. In the simulation a 31 wt. % HNO, solution, which has
electrical properties similar to those of molten salts, is being used as
a substitute for molten salt in a fluorinator vessel. We have previously
reported> results for the first eight experiments with the earlier induc-
tion heating coil design. During this report period, experimental work
‘on induction heating in the fluorinator simulation was completed, Twenty-
‘one additional runs were carried out in order to test three other induc-~
tion coil designs. Relations were derived for predicting the rates of
heat generation in the molten salt, the induction coil, and the pipe wall

in a fluorinator having frozen-wall corrosion protection,

2.1 Modification of Power Generation and Transmission Systems

The electrical diagram showing the rf power generation and trans-
mission. systems for the induction heating experiment is shown in Fig. 1.
The. generator, a Thermonic. Model. 1400. oscillator, is rated at 25 kW,
‘operates at. a nominal frequency. of 400 kHz, and develops a terminal
voltage of gbout 13,000 V (rms). The terminals: of the generator are.

- connected to the primary side of en.oil-filled. rf step-down transformer;

this arrangement reduces the voltage to approximately one-sixth that

of the input in:order to not exceed the voltage ratings of the coaxial
transmission cables, The coaxial cables (Model T-20-D and Model T-10-D
made by L. C. Miller Company) are connected in series and allow trans-
mission of power to a point about 30 ft from the generator. ‘During the
current report period, the 10~ft segment (Model T-10-D) of the cable
was replaced with a 5-ft-long coaxial conductor, This conductor was
made of 3/8-in.-diam copper tubing enclosed within 1/2-in,~diam poly-
ethylene tubing, which was, in turn, placed inside 3/b=in.~diem copper
tubing. The new section of the transmission line operated satisfac-

torily,

In order to obtain a high current through the induction. coil and to

minimize. the current in the coaxial. cable, additional inductances and

capacitances were incorporated into.the. circuit with the induction coil

to form a parallel RLC resonant circuit. Two capacitors (General

Electric, Cat. No. 19F234), ‘each having a capacitance of 0.0105 uF, were.

used. These capacitors were. rated for a maximum current of 196 A at Sh0
‘kHz ‘and a maximum voltage of 5500 V.. For the induction heating, coils
tested, it was possible. to achieve conditions near resonance by |substi-
tuting coils of different sizes for the resonance and coarse-tuning .
‘coils. (see Fig. 1). Resonance was then approached more closely by
adjusting the slide-bar on the fine-tuning loop. It was not possible
to obtain precisely resonant conditions because the operating frequency
‘of the generator was affected by each tuning adjustment, However, with
the circuit adjusted as close to resonance as possible, we were able to
drive up to 250 A through one induction coil (Coil III) with a current
of only 190 A in the coaxial cable, When the resonant circuit was not
‘used and the coaxial cable was connected directly to the induction coil

~ leads, we could drive only about 160 A through the induction coil.

2.2 Experimentel Results

. To date, 29 runs have.been made with the continuous fluorinator
simulation to determine heat generation rates in the nitric acid, in
the pipe surrounding the acid, and in the four induction coils. Each

‘induction coil had a length of 5 ft and an inside diameter of 5.6 in.,

~~)
 

w

and vas made of a number of smaller coil sections connected in parallel

electrically, The characteristics of the individual induction coil

designs are. shown in Table 1. Coil Iv was chosen as the best design

because it produced the highest heat generation rate in the nitric acid

for a given current in the induction coil.

Table 2 gives the experimentally determined heat generation rates
in the acid, coil, and simulated vessel wall, along with the run condi-
tions, Coil currents ranging from 100 to 250 A and oscillator frequen-
cies ranging from 390 to 426 kHz were used in these experiments, Heat

generation rates as high as 1559 W were developed in the acid,

The experimentally determined heat generation rates were used to

‘calculate correction factors for use with design equations that were
“derived for induction coils having idealized geometries. The design
“equations, which define these correction factors, are listed below. The

‘rate of heat generation in liquid inside an induction coil is given by

coil design is apparently the result of having all of the small coil
‘sections wound in the same direction since the remaining characteristics
of the coil are similar to those for the other coils. “Coil II would
require the largest current in order to produce a given heat generation
rate in molten salty however, it might have a high efficiency for
“heating the salt if the diameter of the molten region were sufficiently

large.

The value of k, for coil I was smaller than that for coil III,
although the two coils have essentially the same design and comparable
values were observed for the other constants. This variation in kg
values is probably due to changes in experimental technique and operating
conditions incorporated after tests with coil I were carried out. The
new technique consisted in using alcohol-in-glass thermometers to measure
the acid temperatures, since the temperatures indicated by thermocouples
used in the runs with coil I were affected to some extent by the rf power
generation. Also, the coil designs tested after coil I resulted in )
higher heat generation rates in the acid which, in turn, led to smaller

relative errors in the measured heat generation rates in the acid,

0 value for coil IV and the kj values

for coils I and II is probably due, in large part, to the different

The difference between the k

spacing of the small coil sections. Coil IV had l-in.-long small coil
sections, with 11.7 turns in each section (see Table 1), and the sec-

tions were separated by a space of 2 in. in which turns were not present.
wy}

«9

The smaller sections in the other ‘three coils were placed closer together
so that the coil turns were spaced uniformly over the length of the acid
colufn; the total number of turns was about the same for each coil. In
the case of coils I and III this spacing compressed the magnetic field
between each of the small coil ‘sections, thereby effecting a decrease in
the axial component of the field, It is the axial component that pro-~

vides the proper eddy currents for heat genevsiion, -

Although any one of the four coils could be used to generate heat
in the proposed fluorinator, coil IV would require the lowest coil
current to produce the required heating and, for this reason, would be
the most desirable. Calculations have shown that, for a 5-in,~diam |
molten~salt zone, a 5.56in,~ID coil made from 1/b4~in. nickel tubing
(using a coil IV design in which each small section has 9,5 turns over
a 3. 75-in. length, with a 2. 25-in. -space between small sections), and
a 6- 9/16-in.-ID nickel fluorinator vessel, an efficiency of heating the
salt (with no bubbles) of about 49% would be achieved with a total
current of less than 150 A. With coil 1171, the efficiency of heating
the salt would be ‘about 6 58%, but a coil current of 267 A would be

required.

3. SEMICONTINUOUS REDUCTIVE EXTRACTION EXPERIMENTS
So IN A MILD-STEEL FACILITY

B. A. Hannaford = C. W. Kee
i oo 'L. E. McNeese

We have continued operation of a facility in which semicontinuous
reductive extraction experiments can be carried out in a mild-steel sys-
tem. Initial work with the facility was directed toward obtaining data
on the hydrodynami cs of the countercurrent flow of molten salt and bis~
muth in a 0.82-in.-ID, 2l-in.-long column packed with 1/b4-in. molybdenum
Raschig rings. We were able to show that flooding data obtained with
>

this column are in agreement with predictions from a correlation based
on studies of the countercurrent flow of mercury and aqueous solutions
in packed columns. We have carried out several experiments for deter-
mining the mass transfer performance of the packed column in which a
‘salt stream containing UF), was countercurrently contacted Eo bismuth
containing reductant over a range of operating conditions. 7 It was
found that the rate of uranium transfer to the bismuth was controiled
by the diffusive resistance in the salt film under conditions such that
the concentration of reductant in the bismuth remained high throughout
the column. The extraction data could be correlated in terms of the E
height of an overall transfer unit based on the salt phase. In order
to measure mass transfer rates under more closely controlled conditions
where the controlling resistance is not in the salt phase, preparations
were begun for experiments in which the rate of exchange of zirconium
isotopes will be measured between salt and bismuth phases otherwise at
chemical equilibrium. Difficulty was encountered at the beginning of
the first run of this type because of a salt leak in the vicinity of the

salt feed-and-catch vessel.

3.1 Replacement of the Salt Feed-and-Catch Tank

A new salt feed-and-catch tank of the initial design’ was fabricated
and installed in the system. Thermal insulation was removed from all

transfer lines to allow their inspection, and lines that were more than

C .
 

-

od

13

moderately oxidized were replaced. The salt transfer line from the

feed tank to the salt Jack-leg was rerouted to a point 11 in. higher

than in the original design in order to improve control of the salt

feed rate and to prevent the backflow of bismuth into the salt feed

tank during column upsets...

After its installation, the new salt feed-and-catch tank was stress
relieved by the same technique used for the original feed-and-catch
tanks; that is, the rate of heating to the operating temperature (650°C)

was maintained at less than 60°C/hr. The bismuth feed-and-catch tank,

which had been allowed to cool: during the time required to fabricate and

install the new salt tank, was heated to the operating temperature (550°C)
at the same controlled rate. Both the salt and bismuth feed-and-catch

tanks were subjected to a pressure-proof test at the operating tempera~-
ture after frozen bismuth seals had been established in the freeze valves
in order to isolate the feed tanks (rated at 50 psig) from the receiver
tanks (rated at 25 psig). - After the pressure tests had been successfully

completed, the salt feed-and-catch tank -and the newly installed salt-

transfer lines were contacted with a hydrogen stream for 13 hr at 600°C

in order to remove accumulations of iron oxide from the internal sur-

: faces of the system.

3. 2 Preparation for Mass Transfer Experiment ZTR-1

After “the system had been treated with hydrogen for removal of most

of the iron oxide, it was necessary to (1) add reductant. to the bismuth

Phase, (2) increase the salt: inventory in the system to about 20 liters,

and (3) circulate ‘the salt’ and bismuth phases through the system in

order to remove impurities ‘that might ‘have been introduced during the

maintenance operations. It was also necessary to increase the zirconium

inventory in the system, to remove impurities from the salt phase by

hydrofluorination, and finally, to add a sufficient amount of reductant

- to the bismuth phase to produce’ a zirconium distribution ratio of about

1. These operations are discussed in the remainder of this section.

A 103-g quantity of thorium was suspended in the bismuth phase in’
T

‘the treatment vessel in a perforated container as described earlier’ in

 
 

 

Wn

order to increase the reductant concentration in the bismuth to about

~ 0.002 equiv per g-mole of bismuth. During dissolution of the thorium,
the treatment vessel was held at 650°C, and argon was fed to the draft
tube in the vessel at the rate of 2.5 std £t3/nr. Only 5 g of thorium

- remained undissolved after a period of 41 hr; analyses of bismuth sam-
ples for uranium and thorium showed that about 80% of the thorium had
dissolved during the first 24 hr. About 18 liters of salt (72-16-12
mole % LiF-BeF ,-ThF) ) was then charged to the treatment vessel in order
to replace salt that had been discarded when the original salt feed-
and-catch tank was replaced.. The salt and bismuth phases were equili-
brated in the treatment vessel for about 20 hr before they were trans-
ferred to their respective feed tanks. Bismuth and salt were then
circulated through the system in order to complete the removal of oxides
‘that had not been removed from the internal surfaces of the system after
the previous treatment with hydrogen. In addition, column pressure drop
measurements were made during a period when only salt was. flowing through
the column. The observed pressure drop was about 2 in. H,0 at the salt
flow rate of T0 ml/min, which is in agreement with data obtained soon
after the column was installed. Tt was concluded that the flow charac-

teristics of the column hed not changed during runs made to date.

The zirconium mass transfer experiments require that a significant
quantity of zirconium be present in the salt and bismuth phases to ensure
that only a negligible change will occur in the zirconium distribution

97

ratio during the transfer of “'Zr tracer from the salt to the bismuth
phase. A 5.2-g quantity of Zircaloy-2 was dissolved in the bismuth to

increase the zirconium inventory of the system to about 15 g.

The salt and bismuth were then contacted in the treatment vessel
with a 30% HF--hydrogen stream having a flow rate of about 16 std ££3/
hr at 650°C in order to remove oxide (from the salt) that might have
accumulated during the previous transfer of the salt and bismuth through
the facility. ‘Treatment of the salt and bismuth with the HP-H,, stream
“was interrupted after about 2 hr by a restriction caused by deposition
of material on the sintered-Monel filter in the off-gas stream from the

treatment vessel. The filter, which has an external surface area of
 

-r

of

wy

15

about 20 in.2, is used for removing. particulates which would otherwise
cause restrictions in valve ports in the off-gas systen, The filter

was removed and replaced by a LY-in.-diam, 8-in.~long cylinder of com-

‘pacted copper mesh. Analyses of the black solids removed from the

Monel filter showed that the material consisted primarily of carbon,
along with substantial amounts of thorium, uranium, and lithium. After

the treatment wish HF-H,, the salt and bismuth were contacted with argon

23
at about 3 std ft 3 mr for a 20-hr period in order to remove HF from the

salt. The bismuth and salt were. subsequently sampled, and a perforated

“basket containing 48 g of thorium metal was suspended in the bismuth

phase. After a period of 66 hr at a temperature of about 620°C, only

-25 g of the thorium had dissolved. In order to add reductant to the

bismuth phase more rapidly, 240 g of Li-Bi alloy containing 1.75 wt q
lithium was added to the treatment vessel. The total quantity of

reductant added during these periods was about 1 g-equiv. The resulting

zirconium distribution ratio should have been about 5 if it is assumed

that all of the added reductant was present in the bismuth as uranium,
zirconium, thorium, and lithium. However, the results. of experiment
ZTR-1, described in the following section, indicate that this assumption

is not valid.

3.3 Mass Transfer Experiment ZTR-1

At the conclusion of a 22~-hr equilibration period which followed

the final addition of reductant to the treatment vessel, the salt was

transferred to.the salt feed: tank. ‘The transfer of bismuth from the

treatment vessel was only sbout 50% complete when a failure of the
transfer line inside the vessel at the weld which joins the molybdenum

tubing to ‘the mild-steel ‘transfer line made it necessary to cease this

“operation. The affected portion of the transfer line was ‘replaced at

a later date; however, the intended duration of experiment ZTR=-1 was

. reduced in order that the run_could be carried. out, with the smaller

- amount of bismuth that was “available in the bismuth feed’ tank.

~ 96

A 6.7-ng quantity of 7°Zr0,, that had been irradiated for 12 hr at

2 -1

a thermal neutron flux of about 2 x 10t% neutrons on 2 sec = was

~

 
 

 

16

transferred to a 0. 75-in.-diam steel capsule after an 18-hr decay period
to facilitate addition of the Map tracer to the salt phase. Periodic
salt samples taken after immersion of the capsule indicated that mixing
of the tracer with the salt phase was complete after 2 hr. In order to
verify that most of the tracer had entered the salt phase, the steel

97

addition capsule was counted for 7'Zr activity. The counting results
for the bulk salt and for the capsule showed that greater than 99% of

the tracer had been transferred to the salt phase.

The volumetric flow rates for bismuth and salt during experiment
ZTR-1 were 216 and 99 ml/min respectively; these values are equivalent
to about 90% of the combined coluim flow capacity at flooding. Seven
sets of gr Vine stream samples were taken over a 29-min ‘period. Counting
“of the 7 no-27

~~ transfer of Myr tracer from the salt to the bismuth phase had occurred

Zr activities in the samples showed that no measurable

during the experiment. It was later found that the lack of transfer was
due to an unexpectedly low distribution coefficient for zirconium, which
resulted in essentially no zirconium being present in the bismuth phase.
Wet-chemical analyses of post-run, equilibrated samples for lithium and
uranium implied a zirconium distribution coefficient value of about
0.001. A more precise value (O. 023) was obtained by counting the samples
r IM ep. activity. It was concluded that essentially all of the
reductant that had been added to the system had been consumed by one or
more side reactions, for example, the reduction of FeF, in the salt
phase to metallic. iron, or the reaction of reductant with HF that was
desorbed from the graphite crucible. It is also possible that a fraction
of the lithium in the Li-Bi alloy reacted with air or water vapor during

its addition to the treatment vessel.

3.4 Variation of Reductant Inventory in the
Bismuth Phase in the Treatment Vessel
During this report period, we observed a considerably greater varia-
tion in the reductant inventory in the bismuth phase in the treatment
vessel than had been expected; consequently, we have begun to give addi-

tional attention to this subject. Reductant can be removed from the
 

wy

17

bismuth phase by a number of side reactions, including:. (1) reaction

of reductant with materials. in the salt phase such as FeF_, HF, or

’
oxygen-containing compounds; and (2) reaction of reduced tals (uranium,
thorium, zirconium) with the graphite crucible in the treatment vessel.
Information related to the variation of reductant inventory in the bis-
muth phase, as-well as the inventory of uranium in the system, will be
reported here and in future reports covering work in this experimental
facility so that the phenomena responsible for the observed effects can

be identified.

Data on the variation of inventories of reductant, uranium, and

zirconium during this report period are summarized in Table 4. At the

beginning of the period, the treatment vessel contained 17.7 liters of

bismuth and 1:4 liters of salt (72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF)). After
a 118-day period in which the salt and bismuth were held in the treat-
ment vessel, the reductant inventory in the bismuth had decreased from
0. 80 g-equiv to 0.058 g~equiv. The average rate of decrease in redue-
tant concentration during this period this period was 0.26 meq/hr. The
addition of 1.69 g-equiv of thorium metal to the bismuth phase resulted
in approximately the expected change in the reductant concentration in -
the bismuth based on uranium: and zirconium analyses. Following the
addition of salt to the system to increase the salt volume to about
21.5 liters, samples taken from the treatment vessel showed that the
reductant inventory had decreased slightly to 1.33 g-equiv; & decrease

‘was expected because of the probability of introducing small amounts

of oxidants during the addition of salt to the system. Subsequently,

“the salt and bismuth pheses were circulated through the system (run

HR-13) in order to remove oxides which may have been introduced during

the installation of new carbon steel lines and equipment. "Analyses of

bismuth samples showed that about half of the reductant ‘was removed
from the bismuth during this operation. Next, zirconium metal (0.23
g-equiv) was dissolved in ‘the ‘bismuth phase in order to achieve the
desired ‘zirconium inventory in “the system. Following this addition,

the salt and bismuth were contacted with an HF-H,, mixture. At this

point, the salt phase should have contained all of the uranium and

zirconium, and samples ‘shoved a uranium concentration in the salt that

was within ‘about 4%" of the expected value. We then added to the bismuth

a quantity of reductant (0.43 g-equiv of thorium, 0 .61 g-equiv of lith-
ium) theoretically sufficient to produce a zirconium distribution coef-
ficient of about 5, in the absence of reductant-consuming side reactions.
However, analyses of bismuth and salt before and after tracer experiment
ZTR-1 showed that the reductant had been consumed almost entirely before

the experiment was performed ; as discussed earlier.

The material balance for uranium throughout the report period was
excellent, -as shown in Table h; the zirconium balance was satisfactory

in view of ‘the greater difficulty encountered in enelyzing samples for

‘zirconium at low concentrations.

3.5 Operation of the Argon Purification System

The argon purification system, described earlier,” was modified by
the addition of a parallel. purification system (Englehard Deoxo Puri-
fiers, Models D and C in series). The purpose of this modification was
to evaluate the ‘effectiveness of Englehard units relative to that of
the ‘regular purification train, which consists of a bed of molecular

sieves followed by a bed of uranium turnings at 650°C.

The Delphi trace oxygen anelyzer indicated an oxygen concentration
of 3.6 ppm in the argon stream leaving the Deoxo units, as compared
with a value of 1.6 ppm measured in the argon stream leaving the regular

purification train. The comparison ‘was not completely conclusive, how-

Ce ever, because of the possibility of: ‘slight air inleakage and the possi-
“bility of catalyst’ poisoning in the Deoxo units. The Delphi analyzer

had also. shown symptoms - indicative. of silver cathode poisoning, although

it had been restored to service by heating the cathode grids to 800°C

+ in air to remove suspected surface contamination. Recurring failure of

the Delphi analyzer militated against our obtaining 8 reliable compari-
son of the two purification systems. Prior to the first evidence of
maloperation, the Delphi analyzer indicated that the regular purification
system was ‘reducing the oxygen level from about 0. 75. ppm in the inlet

argon stream to about: 0.2 ppm in the outlet stream.

 
 

 

 

20

Measurements of the same argon streams showed water contents of
<0.1 ppm; the concentrations were usually <0.01 ppm. It was observed,
however, that the water concentration indicated by each of the Pana-
metrics probes tended to diminish over & period of many weeks. This
suggested that the calibration was shifting downscale with time, since =
a new probe installed in the same location would generally indicate a

significantly higher concentration (i.e.; 2 ppm vs 0.01 ppm).

Despite the difficulties experienced in measuring the level of
oxygen and water in the purified argon, the concentrations were estab-

lished to lie within limits which were acceptably low.

4. DEVELOPMENT OF THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS:
INSPECTION OF EXPERIMENT MTE-2

E. L. Youngblood L. E. McNeese

It has been found that rare earths distribute selectively into mol-

ten LiCl from bismuth solutions containing rare earths and thorium, and

an improved rare-earth removal process based on this observation has
been devised. J Work that will demonstrate all phases: ‘of the improved
rare-earth removal method, which is known as the metal transfer process,
is presently under way. Ri

We previously? carried out an engineering experiment (MTE-1) for .

studying the removal of rare earths from single-fluid MSBR fuel salt by

this process. During the experiment, approximately 50% of the lanthanum

and 25% of neodymium originally present in the fluoride salt were removed

at .about the expected rate. - Surprisingly, however, the lanthanum and
neodymium removed from the fluoride salt did not accumulate in the Li-Bi
solution used for removing these materials from LiCl. It is believed
that reaction of impurities in the system with the rare earths caused
this unexpected behavior. | oo

A second engineering ; experiment (rE-2) was recently completed. 11,12

A brief description of the equipment used’ for this experiment and the

results of an inspection carried out after completion of the experiment

are presented in the reminder. of this section.

Soka Description of Equipment
 Experinent MTE-2 was performed in a vessel constructed of 6-in.

sched ho carbon steel pipe. The outside of the vessel was spray coated

with: a 20-mil thickness of nickel aluminide for protection against oxi-

dation. The vessel, “shown schematically in Fig. 3s was divided into two

ment also contained a cup (1. ob in. in diameter, 8.25 in. high) which
was initially filled to a depth of 4 in. with a 35 at. 4 Li-Bi solution.
The cup was constructed of 0.031~in.-thick ‘carbon steel sheet metal and
was held in place by a holder made of 2-in. sched 40 carbon steel pipe.
Alumina spacers were used to electrically insulate the cup from the

holder.

During operation, LiCl was circulated through the cup containing
the Li-Bi solution via a pump constructed of 1-1/2-in.-diam carbon steel
pipe (0.083-in. wall thickness). The pump used molten bismuth as check

valves. During the 3.3-month period in which the experiment was in
operation, 702 liters of Lici was circulated through the cup containing
the Li-Bi solution. Gas-1ift sparge tubes were used in both compartments
of the vessel and in the cup containing the Li-Bi solution to improve
contact between the salt and metal phases. The sparge tubes were con-
structed of 1/h-in. carbon steel tubing which was placed inside 3/8-in.

tubing as shown in Fig. k, Thermowells, constructed of 1/4-in.-diam

at the operating temperature (650 to 660°C) ‘by an 8-kW furnace. The
upper 6 in. of the vessel was wrapped with a cooling coil through which

water was circulated in order to maintain the flange at about 100°C.

tion.

the external oxidation that had occurred did not cause difficulty with

To facilitate inspection of its interior, the vessel was cut in
such a manner that the lower 11 in. on each side of the partition could
be removed to expose the salt and metal phases. A view of the fluoride
compartment is shown in Fig. 6. The fluoride salt and Th-Bi phases

appeared. to be clean and free from any accumulation of material at the

salt-metal interface; however, the vapor region of the fluoride compart
ment was covered with a black powder having the composition (by weight) .
of: 2.4% Li, 2.2% Be, 70.2% Bi, 1.1% Th, 0.02% Fe, and 19.9% F. The
deposit was greatest (about 1/8 in. thick) in the cooler portions of
the compartment near the upper flange. Some of the powder had also
discolored the surfaces of the salt that had contacted the vessel wall.
The black powder is thought to be a mixture of salt and metallic. bis-

muth that had been entrained into the gas space by the argon sparge.

A view of the LiCl compartment (with some of the LiCl removed) and
the Li-Bi container is shown in Fig. T. The vapor region in the LiCl
compartment was covered with a white powder consisting of LiCl containing
0.6 wt % Bi.. This material is believed to have resulted from vaporiza-
tion and from entrainment of LiCl and smaller amounts of bismuth in the
argon stream fed to the gas spargers. The LiCl and Th-Bi phases appeared
to be clean, with no accumulation of impurities at the salt-metal inter-

face as had been seen in metal transfer experiment MIE-1.°

There were only two areas in the system where deposits containing
unusually high concentrations of rare earths were found. A 1/8-in.-
"thick layer of gray material (shown in Fig. 8) had deposited on the lip
and overflow spout of the Li-Bi container. This deposit had the following
composition (by weight): 23% LiCl, 59% Bi, 10% La, and 2% Th. The lan-
thanum contained in the deposit was equal to 5 to 10% of the lanthanum -
inventory in the system. ‘The mechanism by which the material was depo~-
sited on the rim of the lithium-bismuth cup has not been determined;
however, it may have resulted from the Li-Bi solution wetting the con-.

tainer wall and subsequently flowing up it. The lanthanum could then

have been deposited from the LiCl that was in contact with the metal
film. The lanthanum concentration in the bottom layer of the Th-Bi
solution was approximately eight times higher than that observed in
| filtered samples taken during the run; however, this does not represent
a significant fraction of the total lanthanum in the system. The bottom
layer of the Th-Bi phase also contained 20 wt % thorium and is assumed
to have been a mixture of thorium bismuthide particles and bismuth. The
higher lanthanum concentration in this material is not surprising

3 that rare earths distribute prefer-

since it has been shown previously
entially to the solid phase via formation of compounds of the type

ThLaBi.

Inspection of the carbon steel vessel interior revealed little evi-
dence of corrosion, as shown in Figs. 6 and 7. However, some corrosion
did occur on the cup that contained the Li-Bi solution, and on thermo-
wells and sparge tubes. All of these items were constructed of thin
carbon steel. The corrosion of the Li~Bi cup occurred mainly at the
salt-metal interface, A crack and a 5/8-in.-diem hole had developed
in the vicinity of the interface and had allowed a portion of the Li-Bi
solution to run into the holder. Data from the experiment indicate :
that the hole had developed after sbout two months of operation; how-
ever, it did not cause serious difficulty since the Li-Bi solution was
contained in the holder and did not mix with the other phases in the
experiment. The lower portions of the carbon steel sparge tubes and
thermowells that were in contact with the salt and bismuth phases during
the experiment are shown in Fig. 9. The sparge tubes in both the fluo-
ride salt and the LiCl compartments were severely corroded, particularly

in the area near the salt-bismuth interface. The 3/8-in.-diem tubing
| was absent from the sparge tube that was removed from the fluoride salt
compartment. The sparge tube from the Li-Bi vessel and the thermowells
were less severely corroded. “The corrosion observed on the carbon.
steel components is thought to be due mainly to mass transfer of iron
due to a thermal gradient in the bismuth phase. Iron has a solubility
of about 80 ppm in bismuth at 650°C, 1 and thermal gradients in the
experiment could cause iron to be dissolved in hot areas and deposited

in cold areas.

The carbon steel pump, which used bismuth check valves, was in good
condition at the completion of the experiment. Figure 10 shows a view
of the lower portion of the pump after it had been sectioned to show the
bismuth check valves. Little evidence of corrosion could be found by
visual examination of the pump. There was no appreciable loss of bis-
muth from the check valves by its entrainment in the LiCl during the
experiment. The bismuth in the top check valve contained 130 ppm of Li,
less than 50 ppm of Th, and less than 20 ppm of La after 702 liters of
LiCl had been circulated through the pump. |

While carbon steel is not being considered as a material of con-
struction for an MSBR processing plant, it appears to be suitable for
use in experiments such as MFE-2, where a limited amount of corrosion

is acceptable.

5. DEVELOPMENT OF THE METAL TRANSFER PROCESS:
AGITATOR TESTS FOR EXPERIMENT MTE-3

E. L. Youngblood ~ W. F. Schaffer, Jr.

Mechanical agitators will be used to promote contact of the salt
and metal phases in metal transfer experiment MTE-3, which is currently
being designed and constructed.’ The shaft seals for the agitators must
‘be capable of operating in .a dry argon atmosphere and must have a low
leakage rate in order to prevent air and moisture from entering the exper-
‘iment. Equipment has been constructed in order to test the shaft seal.
design that is proposed for use in metal transfer experiment MTE-3. The
system will also allow us to measure the extent to which bismuth is
entrained in salt in a mechanically agitated system and to evaluate a
vapor-deposited tungsten coating as. a means for protecting carbon steel

from corrosion by molten salt and bismuth.

5.1 Description of Equipment

" Figure 11 shows the test equipment before installation of the elec-
trical heaters and thermal insulation. The agitator drive assembly (shown
in Fig. 12) consisted of a 1-1/b-in.-diam stainless steel shaft held in
position by two ball bearings that were separated by a distance of 4 in.
After passing through the ball bearings, the shaft diameter was reduced
to 1 in.; the shaft passed through two Bal-Seals (product of Bal-Seal
Engineering Co.) before entering the test vessel. The seals were con-
structed of graphite-impregnated Teflon and were spring-loaded in order
to hold the sealing surface against the shaft. The portion of the shaft
that was in contact with the seals was plated with chromium and polished
to a 10< to 12-pin. surface that would produce satisfactory sealing.

The region between the two seals was pressurized with argon in order to
reduce the rate of air inleakage past the seals. A lb-in.-long cooling
water jacket was located below the shaft seal as a means of protecting
the seals from damage by heat from the lower portion of the system (which
operates at 650°C). A thermowell was provided for measuring the temper-

ature in the vicinity of the seals.

The agitator used for the test, shown in Fig. 13, wes machined from
a single bar of molybdenum. The agitator shaft was 12.31 in. long and

had a diameter of 0.5 in. Separate blade assemblies were located in the

‘salt and bismuth phases. Each assembly had a diameter of 1.12 in. and

a height of 0.5 in.; each blade was 0.13 in. thick. The upper end of
the agitator was threaded to facilitate its attachment to the drive unit.

The vessel used to contain the salt and bismuth for the agitator
test was constructed of 3-in. sched 80 carbon steel pipe (ASTM A 106
Grade B). A standard pipe cap was used for the bottom of the vessel.
The overall length of the vessel was 20.8 ‘in. Four baffles (3 in. long,
1/2 in. wide) were welded to the inside of the vessel beginning at a
point 2-1/4 in. above the bottom of the vessel. A 1/h-in. sched LO pipe
was attached to the side of the vessel to allow sampling of the salt and

bismuth phases, and a 1/4-in. pipe was attached to the bottom to allow

the salt and bismuth to drain from the vessel. The lower 10 in. of the

vessel interior was costed with tungsten in order to evaluate the effec-

tiveness of this type of coating for reducing corrosion in systems con-
taining bismuth.
In applying the tungsten coating, the inside of the vessel was first

plated with nickel (approximately 1 mil thick) by ‘electrodeposition. The

‘nickel layer was bonded to the vessel by maintaining the vessel in vacuum

at 800°C for 4 hr. Heaters were then installed on the vessel, and the

tungsten coating was vapor deposited from a H, 5 WFe. mixture. 16 The temper-

‘ature of the vessel varied from about 400 to 650°C along its length

during the coating operation; consequently, the coating thickness varied

from 0. 00k to 0.020 in., ‘with the ‘thickest deposit being located near
‘the bottom of the vessel. Figure 14 shows a view of the interior of the
: vessel after the coating had: ‘been applied. Examination of the coating

vith: a borescope revealed no obvious signs of cracking or. blistering.

The exterior of the carbon steel vessel was spray coated with a 20-

mil layer of nickel aluninide in an effort to retard air oxidation. How-

~ ever, before the nickel aluminide was applied, half of the vessel was

first sprayed with stainless steel to determine whether such a coating

would provide improved protection against oxidation. During operation,

order to maintain the shaft seal temperature at about 50°C. The agitator
was driven by a 1/4-hp variable-speed motor that was coupled directly

to the drive unit.

5.2 Experimental Results

The shaft seals used in the first test were Bal-Seal No. R30LA-
(s2)6120. The agitator vas initially operated at 200 rpm for 100 hr with
no salt or bismuth in the system. During the first 50-hr period the
vessel was held at room temperature; during the remaining 50 hr, temper-
atures for the vessel and the seal were maintained ‘at 650°C and about
50°C respectively. Throughout the test, the. seal leakage rate was: deter-
mined by pressurizing the region between the two seals with argon and
- measuring the rate of decrease in pressure when the argon supply was shut
off. The seal leakage rate during the first 100 hr, as measured at 1
atm and ambient temperature, was about 3 en3/nr. The internal pressure

in the region between the seals was 15 to 20 psig initially. -

After the initial testing of the seal, 3549 g of purified bismuth
and 915 g of fluoride salt (72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF,-ThF) to whieh 0.3
mole % LaF, had been added) were charged to the system. The salt-bismuth
interface was located at a point about 1 in. above the lower agitator
blades, and the salt-gas interface was located about 1 in. above the
upper agitator blades. During the following one-month period, the agi-
tator speed was increased stepwise from 150 to 750 rpm; the salt and
bismuth phases were maintained at 650°C. The operating time at each
speed is summarized in Table 5. During most of the test period, the
seal leakage rate remained constant at about 10 cm 3/hr; however, near

the end of this period it increased to greater than 100 em /hr.

After a total operating period of 84S hr, the salt and bismuth
were drained from the system and the seals.were removed for inspection. .
The upper seal was found to be badly deteriorated, while the Teflon
had worn through to the spring in some areas. The lower seal, although -

‘slightly worn, appeared to be in good condition. Evaluation of various

seals was “continued without the use of. salt and bismuth in the system.
Short tests were made at agitator speeds. of 100 to 500 rpm using Bal-
Seals having a light expander spring: however, these seals leaked exces-
sively and were replaced with Bal-Seals (No. R3-6A-(1.000)G) having a
moderate expander spring and & thicker cross section than the seals used
initially. The leakage . rate using these seals was satisfactory, and

testing was continued at ambient temperature for 70 days using agitator

speeds of 150 to 300 rpm. During the first 31 ae of operation, the
. rate gradually ‘increased from 0.3 em’ /hr. to 2 cm 3 nr. At ‘that time,

3

| 1 cm ~of mineral oil vas injected into the region between seals to

determine whether this would reduce the seal leakage rate and increase
the seal life. After. the oil had been injected, the leakage rate decreased
to 0.05 em3/hr During oe next 24 days of operation, however, it grad-

3 of oil between

the seals. resulted in a decrease in. the leakage rate to 0. 02 em3/hr, and

confirmed that the use of oil is effective in reducing. the seal leakage

rate.

 
 

42

After Tl days of operation the seals were removed for inspection.
Although both seals showed some wear, a sufficient wall thickness remained
to allow a considerably longer operating time, Based -on these test
results, it was determined that this type of seal is acceptable for use

in metal transfer experiment MTE-3.

At intervals throughout the period during which salt and bismuth
were present in the system, unfiltered samples of the salt phase were
taken to determine the extent of bismuth entrainment in the salt. Also,
unfiltered bismuth samples were taken for nickel and iron analyses in
order to determine whether the tungsten coating vas intact. During the
test, the bismuth content of the salt increased from 8 ppm to 101 ppm
as shown in Table 6; however, there was no indication that large quan-
tities of bismuth were being entrained in the salt. The purified bismuth
charged to the experiment contained 10 ppm of iron and less than 20 ppm
of nickel. During the test the concentration of nickel .in the bismuth
" inereased to about 1000 ppm (shown in Table 6), which indicated that
the bismuth had penetrated the tungsten coating. The concentration of
iron in the bismuth phase increased from 20 ppm to 50 ppm (the approx-—
imate solubility of iron in bismuth at 650°C during the test. The tungsten
and molybdenum concentrations in the bismuth remained below 20 ppm and

10 ppm, respectively, throughout the test. .

After completion of the agitator test, the equipment was disassembled
for inspection (see Fig. 15). During operation, the vessel and agitator
had been maintained at S00 to 650°C for a period of 1150 hr, and salt and
‘bismuth had been present in the system for 1005 hr. Visual examination
revealed no evidence of corrosion. The portion of the agitator submerged
in the bismuth phase had been wet by the bismuth. Also, droplets of salt
and bismuth could be seen clinging to the agitator shaft at points above
the salt surface. The upper portions of the shaft and the drive unit
were covered with a black material that may have formed as the result

of decomposition of oil from the shaft seals.

The tungsten coating on the inside of the vessel was examined by
members of the Metals and Ceramics Division.l! The nickel plate and tung-

sten costing were found to be intact and adherent in two samples taken

from the main vessel. However, cracks in the coating were noted in

several places, and there was evidence that bismuth had penetrated

these cracks and had attacked the nickel substrate. The cracks are

thought to be the result of thermal cycling since the coefficients of
thermal expansion of the tungsten coating and iron vessel are consid-
erably different. In samples taken from the 1/k-in. drain line at the
bottom of the vessel, the tungsten coating was not in contact with the
metal substrate and the nickel layer was absent. The carbon steel was
also attacked to a depth of about 2 mils in that area. Although the

nickel and tungsten coatings were fairly adherent in the 1/b-in. sample

line attached to the side of the vessel, numerous cracks were found in

the tungsten coating. It was concluded from examination of the vessel
that complete protection of a vessel of this type from exposure to bis-
muth by tungsten coating will be difficult because of the tendency of
such a coating to crack. However, although considerable dissolution
of the nickel coating hed occurred, attack on the carbon steel base
metal was relatively minor in the samples examined.

- The nickel aluminide coating on the exterior of the vessel appeared

to be in good condition after the test; however, the vessel was not held

 

‘at elevated temperature for a sufficiently long period to determine

whether the use of the stainless steel coating under the nickel aluminide

on half of the vessel was beneficial.

‘6. DISTRIBUTION OF RADIUM BETWEEN LiCl AND Li-Bi SOLUTIONS

'E. L. Youngblood L. E. McNeese

Radium is present at tracer levels in metal transfer process ‘experi-
ments as a decay product of thorium. Redium would be expected to have
distribution characteristics similar to those for divalent rare-earth
fission products (Sm and Eu) and alkaline-earth fission products (Sr end
Ba). Thus, it is of interest to obtain information concerning the behavior

of redium in metal transfer systems.

Date relative to the distribution of redium between molten LiCl and
~lithium-bismuth solutions containing from 13 to 35 mole % lithium, obtained

. during metel transfer experiment MIE-2, were reported previously. 2 After Bh

the completion of metal transfer experiment MIE-2, & portion of the Li-Bi
solution from the experiment (containing radium) vas diluted with bismuth
and contacted with purified LiCl at 650°C in order to obtain additional
distribution data for redium et lower concentrations of lithium in bismuth.

These data ere discussed in the remainder of this section,

6.1 Description of Equipment

The distribution coefficient measurements were made in 8 12-in.-high

vessel constructed of 2-1/8-in.-diam cerbon steel tubing. A thermowell
end a gas-lift sparge tube, also constructed of carbon steel, were installed
in the vessel for temperature meesurement and for contacting the salt and
metal phases. The carbon steel vessel conteining the LiCl and Li-Bi phases
‘was enclosed in & heated, 4-in.-diem steinless steel vessel which was
‘maintained under an argon atmosphere. Samples of the salt and metal phases
‘could be teken by the method described previously. t® Before the LiCl and

: the Li-Bi solution containing redium were charged to the system, the
carbon steel vessel and bismuth were contacted with hydrogen at 650°C for

- 12 hr to remove oxide impurities. The LiCl was purified in a separate
. vessel by contact with bismuth that had been saturated with thorium et
650°C.

Initially, 272.4 g of Li-Bi solution from metal transfer experiment
MTE-2 was charged to the system along with 48k. 0 g of purified bismuth
and 97.0 g of purified LiCl. The system was then heated to 650°C and

maintained at that temperature during the subsequent operations. Semples

"were taken periodically of the LiCl and Li-Bi phases for determination

of the radium concentrations in the phases. The radium content of the
samples was determined by counting the 0.9-MeV gamma radiation emitted

by the 228, Ac after a decay period. of about 24% hr to ensure that the 228,

(half-life, 6.13 hr) was in secular equilibrium with the 228;

6.2 Experimental Results

Samples of the LiCl and Li-Bi phases were taken 23 hr and 70 hr
after the temperature of the system had reached 650°C. The concentration
of lithium in the Li-Bi solution was then lowered by the addition of

193.0 g of purified bismuth, and additional measurements were made over

Thus, at a given temperature, a plot of the logarithm of the distribution
coefficient for radium vs the logarithm of the mole fraction of lithium:
in the bismuth phase should give a straight line having a slope equal

to the valence of radium in the LiCl phase. Figure 16 shows radium dis-
tribution data from this experiment and previously reported dats from
metal transfer experiment MTE-2, along with the line having a slope of
2-that best fits the data. It is geen that the distribution data can be
correlated quite satisfactorily by assuming that radium is divalent in.
the LiCl phase.

It should be noted that only about 30% of the distribution data from

metal transfer experiment MIE-2 is based on LiCl samples taken from the

Li-Bi alloy container, while the remainder is based on samples taken from
the main LiCl pool. We believe that the LiCl and Li-Bi phases in the Li-Bi
container were essentially at equilibrium at all times; however, during
the early stages of the experiment, the main Licl pool and the Li-Bi phase
would not have been at equilibrium with respect to the distribution of
radium. For this reason, the data based on LiCl samples from the Li-Bi

alloy container and from the main LiCl pool during the latter part of

the experiment were weighted more heavily in correlating the information

than data based on LiCl samples taken from the main LiCl pool early in

the experiment. The distribution coefficient data for radium at 650°C

in the LiCl--Li-Bi system can be represented by the following relation:

log D = 2 log N., + 1.757 , (6)
D radium distribution coefficient, and
Nis

“the mole fraction of Lithium in the bismuth phase.

A comparison of the relation summarizing the radium distribution data
20,21

and previously reported distribution date for Sm, Eu, Ba, and Sr is

“shown in Fig. 17. ‘As expected, the distribution characteristics for

radium are quite similar to those of the divalent ‘rare-earth and alkaline-

“earth fission products; in fact, the data. for" radium and barium are almost

jdentical.

7. DEVELOPMENT OF MECHANICALLY AGITATED SALT-METAL CONTACTORS

H. 0. Weeren . L. E. McNeese

As reported previously,>? a program has been initiated for the develop-
ment of mechanically agitated salt-metal contactors as an alternative to
packed column contactors presently under consideration for MSBR processing
systems. After brief experimentation with several contactor types using
mercury and aqueous solutions, it was decided that the Lewis type contac-

23,2L
or °°

te has the greatest potential for achieving acceptable mass transfer

rates with minimum dispersion of the salt and metal phases. This is an

important factor since entrainment of bismuth in processed fuel salt that

is returned to the reactor cannot be tolerated. The Lewis contactor has
two agitators — one in the salt phase and one in the bismuth phase — that
are located well away from the salt-metal interface. These agitators

are operated in a manner such that the phases are mixed as vigorously as

possible without dispersing one in the other.

A review of the literature-> revealed the existence of considerable
data concerning mass transfer coefficients in aqueous-organic systems in
Lewis cell contactors having agitator diemeters of 2 to 4 in. and indicated
that the mass transfer coefficient is strongly dependent on both the speed

and the diameter of the agitator. However, before Lewis cell contactors

. can be designed and evaluated for salt-metal systems, it will be necessary

to obtain data for larger contactors, as well as hydrodynamic and mass
transfer rate data for systems having physical properties that more closely
resemble the salt-bismuth system.

During this report period, data were obtained on (1) the maximum
agitator speed that can be used with a mercury-water system before entrain-
ment of water in the mercury is observed, and (2) the rate of circulation
of mercury between the two compartments of a stirred-interface contactor
of the type being considered for the metal transfer process.’ Results

from these studies are summarized in the remainder of this section.

T.1 Studies for Determination of Limiting Agitator Speeds

Preliminary tests were carried out in contactors of several sizes

and with different agitator configurations in order to determine the

factors that will limit’ the agitator speed in stirred-interface contactors.
The contactors used in these tests contained two compartments and were

of the type ‘shown schematically in Fig. 18. Aqueous solutions and mercury
or a low-melting alloy were used to simulate molten salt and bismuth
during the studies. It was found that the common factor that limited

the agitator speed was the transfer of water between the two compartments

via entrainment in the circulating metal phase. For a given contactor

and agitator configuration, this phenomenon was found to begin at a defi-
nite agitator speed; below this speed, no entrainment was observed. The
tests were carried out in compartmented, cylindrical contactors having
diameters of 5.5 and 10 in. and in a ¢ompartmented, rectangular contactor
measuring 12 x 24 in. In each case, the vessel contained no baffles and
a single four-bladed paddle was used in the metal phase on one side of

the contactor.

The limiting agitator speed was found to be essentially independent
of the size and shape of the contactor vessel but. strongly dependent on
the diameter of the agitator. Data obtained during these studies are
summarized in Fig. 19, where it is seen that the allowable agitator speed
is inversely proportional to the 1. 43 power of the agitator diameter.

24,2 2 indicates that the mass transfer coeffi-

Since the Lewis correlation”
cient is ‘dependent on the sgltator diameter to ‘the - 3.7 power, it appears
that at speeds slightly below the limiting agitator ‘speed the mass transfer
coefficient will be dependent on the agitator diameter to the 0.94 power.

Thus, it should be advantageous to operate a contactor ‘having the largest

‘possible agitator diameter.

It should be noted that the data shown in Fig. 19 are valid only for
the operating conditions under which they were obtained. The use of
baffles, canted agitator blades rather than straight blades, an agitator
on each side of a contactor, or other changes in the cell design could

make a considerable difference in the limiting agitator speed. The

following observations relative to this point were noted during the

studies: oo
(1) The limiting agitator speed was relatively independent of

the vertical position of the paddle in the mercury phase as

long as the paddle was located well below the mercury-water
interface. However, when the paddle was located near the

interface, the limiting speed was decreased appreciebly.

(2) The limiting agitator speed was appreciably higher when the
. bismuth phase in each compartment of the contactor was agitated

than when the bismuth in only one compartment vas agitated.

| For example, the difference in limiting agitator speeds for

a 3-in.-diam agitator blade was sbout 60 rpm. The limiting

agitator speed was essentially unaffected by the degree of

“agitation of the aqueous phase.

(3) The size of the opening below the partition that separated
the two contactor compartments could be increased from 0.25 in.
to 0.75 in. without appreciably affecting the limiting sgitator
speed. On the other hand, the limiting agitator speed was
reduced considerebly as the separation distance was increased

above 0.75 in.

(4) The use of baffles or the location of the agitator at an off-
center position increased the limiting agitator speed. This
effect was more important with small-diameter agitators, where
the variation in limiting agitator speed was about 30%, than
with large-diameter agitators, where the difference was only
sbout 10%.

(5) When the agitator blades were canted rather than being vertical
and when the direction of rotation was such that the agitator
lifted the mercury phase, a considerably higher agitator speed
could be attained without entrainment of water between the two
compartments of the contactor. - The limiting agitator speed
under these conditions was sbout twice that shown in Fig. 19

for both 1.5- and 3-in.-diam agitators, but was only about

[03
57

10% higher than the value shown for a 9-in.-diam agitator.
‘The limiting agitator speed was found to be affected signif-
icantly and ‘unpredictably by baffles in ‘the contactor.

A test was carried out using a lov-melting alloy (Cerrolov 105) and
water in a heated contactor having a diameter of 5.5 in. in order to
determine the effect of changes in the properties of the liquid phases
on the contactor performance. The alloy (42.9-21.7-8.0-5.0-18.3-h.0 wt
# Bi-Pb-Sn-Cd-In-Hg) has a specific gravity of 8.1 and a liquidus tem-
perature of about 38°C. At an operating temperature of 60°C, the limiting
agitator speed was essentially identical to the limiting speed observed
with the mercury-water system. Thus, it appears that the limiting agitator
speed is not highly dependent on the difference in densities of the two
liquid phases. “This observation increases our confidence in predicting
the performance of a bismuth-salt. system at 650°C by extrapolating data
obtained with da mercury-water ‘system.

It was concluded that these data constitute sufficient information
for designing the selt-metal contactor for. experiment. MTE-3 and for
suggesting the limiting agitator speed to be used with molten salt and
bismuth in the contactor at 650°cC. It is believed that entrainment of
salt in the bismuth will occur at essentially the same agitator speed
as was observed with the mercury-water system (300 rpm) and that experi-
ment MI'E-3 ‘should be operated initially. with agitator speeds well below
“this value. Ti

7. 2. Determination of Metal Flow Rate Across. Contactor Partition

Proper operation of ‘the salt-metal contactor proposed for use with

metal transfer experiment MIE-3 will require a bismuth circulation rate

of O. 5 liter /min. or’ ‘higher between the two parts of the contactor. Two

tests vere carried out with agitator speeds of 195 rpm to obtain data

k ‘relative to. this point.

In the first test, the agitator consisted of a four-bladed paddle
having vertical blades; in ‘the second test, the blades were canted at

45° in a manner such that the mercury was lifted toward the metal surface.

 
 

 

58

During each test, only one side of the contactor cell was agitated. The
experimental technique consisted of temporarily preventing circulation

of mercury between the two halves of the contactor, establishing a temper-
| ature differential between the mercury pools in the two compartments, and
allowing resumption of the circulation of metal between the compartments.
The rate of change of the temperature of the mercury in one compartment
was then measured in order to determine the rate of mercury flow between
the compartments. Results of previous tests had shown that the rate of
conductive heat transfer across the contactor partition and the rate of
heat loss to the surroundings were negligible as compared with the rate
of convective heat transfer resulting from circulation of the mercury phase

" between the two compartments.

A mathematical analysis vas carried out to aid in interpretation of
the experimental measurements made for the purpose of determining the
rate of flow of mercury between the two contactor compartments. In

making the analysis, the following assumptions were made:
(1) Only mercury is present in the contactor.
(2) Equal quantities of mercury are present in the two compartments.

(3) The mercury in compartment 1 is initially at temperature Typ»

and the temperature in compartment 2 is at temperature Tp.

(4) Mercury circulates between the two compartments at a constant
rate. | |

The first test was carried out using a 3-in.-diam straight-bladed

from the bottom of the contactor vessel and was operated at the speed of

"195 rpm. The mercury in one side of the contactor was heated to 30.5°C,

and the mercury in the other compartment was cooled to 26°C. Seven seconds
after the flow of mercury was resumed, the temperature of the mercury in
the heated side of the contactor had decreased to 29°C. The resulting
mercury flow rate, calculated from Eq. (4), for this condition was 19. 3

conditions except that the blades of the ‘agitator were canted at 45°.

agitator blade, canted agitator blades, and no baffles. For such a

vessel, the degree of agitation that cen be achieved will be limited by

carry-over of the light phase between the contactor compartments. Carry-
over will probably occur in the salt-bismuth system at the approximate

agitator speed observed with the mercury-water system (300 rpm). There-
fore, agitator speeds well below this value should be used initially for

8. ANALYSIS OF MULTICOMPONENT MASS TRANSFER BETWEEN
MOLTEN SALTS AND LIQUID BISMUTH DURING
COUNTERCURRENT FLOW IN PACKED COLUMNS

C. P. Tung J. S. Watson

Reductive extraction, an important operation in the removal of prot-

actinium and rare earths from MSBR fuel salt, involves the exchange of

metal ions in the salt phase with neutral (reduced) metal atoms in the
bismuth phase. Since no net electric current flows between the salt

and metal phases, the rate at which metal ions are reduced must equal
the rate at which metal atoms are oxidized (taking into consideration
differences in the charges of the ions involved). In the bismuth phase,
the fluxes of the transferring atoms are dependent only on concentration
gradients. In the salt phase, however , electric potential gradients are
generated near the salt-metal interface as the result of differences in
the mobilities and/or charges of the various diffusing ions. This
results in a condition where the fluxes of the transferring ions are
dependent on both concentration gradients and electric potential gradi-
ents. These effects greatly complicate the mass transfer process and
make difficult the design of conti Taos (differential) reductive extrac-
tion columns. We have previously ? carried out a mathematical analysis
of mass transfer during reductive extraction processes to aid in under-
standing the results from present and proposed experiments in packed

columns and to aid in using these data for design of larger reductive

extraction systems. During this report period, calculations were com-

pleted for both binary and. ‘multicomponent mass transfer preparatory to

determining the conditions under which the ‘presence of an electric
potential gradient significantly alters the mass transfer rate. In the

remainder of this section, examples are given for cases that ‘represent

either molten-salt--bismuth or aqueous-organic systems.

8.1 Mathematical Models
The mathematical model being considered represents a modification of

the two-film model frequently used for solvent extraction applications.

One liquid phase is considered to be an electrolyte (molten salt or an’
aqueous solution), while the other is considered to be a solvent (bismuth
or an organic phase). The behavior of materials in the solvent phase is
similar in the two cases in that the transferring. components are assumed
to be present in an uncharged or neutral state. However, the behavior of
materials in the electrolyte phase differs for the two cases. In repre-

senting a molten salt, it was assumed that the concentration of electro-

lyte coions (ions which have a charge opposite to that of the transferring

ions) is constant throughout the electrolyte phase since the equivalent
volumes of the fluorides or chlorides of interest are essentially equal.
In representing an aqueous phase, it was. assumed that the concentration
of coions varies across the electrolyte film adjacent to the. solvent-
electrolyte interface. In each case, there was no net transfer of coions

across the solvent-electrolyte interface.

As shown previously ,> the rates at which components transfer bet-

ween an aqueous phase and an organic phase are defined by the relations

be normalized to the transfer rate that would be observed under the same

the absence of electric potential effects are defined by Egs. (1)-(5)

and the. following relation:

Joi = — Dg; grad Cos . (18)

8.2 Calculated Mass Transfer Rates for the Case of Binary
Ce Exchange with Uniform Bulk Concentrations

The extent to which an electric potential gradient alters the rates
at which components transfer between electrolyte and solvent phases
having uniform bulk concentrations depends upon (1) the valences of the
transferring and nontransferring ions in the electrolyte phase, (2) the
diffusion coefficients of the transferring components in the electrolyte
and solvent phases, (3) the resistance to transfer of components through
the electrolyte and solvent films adjacent to the electrolyte-solvent
interface, (4) the equilibrium constants for the transferring components,
(5) the relative concentrations of the transferring components in the
electrolyte and solvent phases, (6) the concentration of nontransferring
ions in the electrolyte phase, and (7) the behavior of the nontransferring

ions.

Because of the large number of variables involved, it is not possi-
ble to portray in a simple manner the complete solution to the set of
equations that defines the effect of the electric potential gradient on
the rates at which components transfer between the electrolyte and sol-
vent phases. Instead, results for selected cases involving two trans-
‘ferring components will be given in order to show the importance of the
various factors. In each case, the rate at which a component transfers
between a solvent and an aqueous or molten salt phase in the presence of
an electric potential gradient will be compared to the rate at which the
component would transfer in the absence of an electric potential gradient.
In the remainder of this chapter, the term relative flux value (RFV) will

be used to denote the ratio of the flux of a transferring component in

«“
65

the presence of an electric potential gradient to the flux in the absence.

of an electric potential gradient.

In all cases involving binary exchange with uniform bulk concentra-
tions, the valences of the transferring and nontransferring ions were
assumed to be unity. The concentrations of components 1 and 2 in the
solvent phase were assumed to be 0. 1 and 0.05 g-mole/cn, respectively,
and the concentrations of components 1 and 2 in the electrolyte phase

were assumed to be 0.05 and 0.01 g-mole/cm>.

8.2.1 Effect of Diffusion Coefficients of Transferring Tons in Electro-
lyte Phase
The effect of the diffusion coefficients of the transferring ions
in the electrolyte phase during binary exchange is shown in Fig. 20,
“where the RFV (for either component) is given as a function of the ratio

of the diffusion coefficient of component 1 in the electrolyte phase to

. the diffusion coefficient of component 2 in the electrolyte phase. In

obtaining these results, the equilibrium constant was assumed to be
‘unity, and the thickness of the solvent film was assumed to be negligible
(negligible resistance to transfer in the solvent film). It should be
“noted that the RFV is affected by the relative values of the diffusion
coefficients for the transferring species except in the case where the
diffusion coefficients (as well as the valences) are equal. The effect
of an electric potential gradient on the mass transfer rate is greater
.. in the case of. a uniform ‘concentration of coions in the electrolyte
phase (molten salt solution)’ than for the -case of a nonuniform concen-
tration of coions in the electrolyte phase (aqueous solution) because
the mobile coions in the aqueous electrolyte distribute across the
* electrolyte £ilm in a manner which suppresses or reduces the effect
of the electric potential gradient. If the ratio of the diffusion
coefficient for component 1 to that of component 2 is 0. 25, neglect of
the effect of an electric ‘potential gradient would result in errors in
the calculated mass transfer rate of 23 and 50% for. aqueous and molten

salt electrolyte phases respectively.

8.2.2 Effect of Individual Mass Transfer Coefficient in Electrolyte
Phase
The effect of the individual mass transfer coefficient in the elec-
trolyte phase is shown in Fig. 21, where the RFV (for either component) is

given as a function of the ratio of the individual mass transfer coeffi-

cient for component 1 in the electrolyte phase to the individual mass

transfer coefficient of component 2 in the electrolyte phase. The mass
transfer coefficients for components 1 and 2 in the solvent phase were
assumed to be equal to the mass transfer coefficient of component 2 in
the electrolyte phase. The equilibrium constant was assumed to be unity.
The error caused by neglect of the effect of an electric potential gra-

dient is greater in the case of the molten salt electrolyte than in the

case of an aqueous electrolyte and becomes ‘significant for the case where

the individual mass transfer coefficient for component 1 in the electro-

1yte phase is small relative to the other individual mass transfer coef-

ficient values.

8.2.3 Effect of Individual Mass Transfer Coefficient in Solvent Phase

The effect of the individual mass transfer coefficient in the sol-
vent phase is shown in Fig. 22, where the RFV (for either component) is
given as a function of the ratio of the individual mass transfer coef-

ficient for component 1or2 in the solvent phase. (assumed to be equal)

© to the individual mass transfer coefficient for component 2 in the
_electrolyte phase. In obtaining these results, it was assumed that the
equilibrium constant was unity and that the ratio of the individual mass
transfer coefficient for component lin the electrolyte phase to that

for component 2. was ‘equal to or

‘When the ‘transfer coefficient in the solvent film is very ‘high, as

a on the right side of Fig. 22, “the transfer rate is controlled by the
resistence in the’ electrolyte film. As in the earlier cases, the effects

of an electric potential gradient are more evident in the case of a

molten salt electrolyte than in the case of an aqueous electrolyte. At
very high values of the solvent film transfer coefficient, mass transfer

resistance is ‘solely in the electrolyte film, and the influence of an

electric potential gradient approaches an asymptotic value. As the sol-
vent phase transfer coefficient decreases, the effects of electric fields
decrease since the transfer rate is no longer controlled by the electro-
lyte film, Eventually, for very low values of the solvent film transfer
coefficient (left side of Fig. 22), the transfer rate is controlled by
the film resistance in the solvent and is not significantly affected by

electric fields.

 

8.2.4 Effect of Equilibrium Constant

The effect of the equilibrium constant on the RFV is shown in Fig.

~ 23. In obtaining these results, it was assumed that the individual mass
transfer coefficients in the solvent phase were equal to the individual
mass transfer coefficient for component 2 in the electrolyte phase. It
was also assumed that the individual mass transfer coefficient for com-
ponent 2 in the electrolyte phase was five times that for component 1. )
Changes in the equilibrium constant result in changes in the interfacial
concentrations in both phases. For very small values for the equilibrium
‘constant, the equilibrium concentrations of the transferring species on
the solvent side of the interface become small relative to the concen-
trations on the electrolyte side of the interface. In this case, the
resistance to transfer between the phases is principally in the solvent
film; the electric potential gradient has essentially no effect, as shown
in the left-hand portion of Fig. 23. For high values of the equilibrium
constant, the primary resistance to mass transfer is in the electrolyte

film and the effect of the electric potential gradient becomes important.

8.2.5 Effect of Concentration of Nontransferring Ions in the Electrolyte
Phase
The effect of the concentration of nontransferring ions in the elec-
trolyte phase _during binary exchange is shown in Fig. 24, where the RFV -
is given as a function of the fraction of the electrolyte concentration
that cannot exchange between the phases. In making these calculations,
the bulk concentrations of the transferring ions in the electrolyte and

solvent phases remained constant at the values given earlier, and the

bulk concentration of a nontransferring component in the electrolyte

phase was varied in a manner which produced nontransferring ion fraction

values ranging from 0 to 0.5. The valence of the nontransferring ion

was +1. As in the case of the coion, the value of the diffusion coef-
ficient of the nontransferring ion is unimportant. The nontransferring
ion behaves as a supporting electrolyte (as does the coion) and suppresses

the effect of the electric potential gradient.

As shown in Fig. 24, the RFV value decreases steadily as the con-

centration of the nontransferring ion (relative to the total electrolyte

concentration) is increased. As in the earlier cases, the effect of the

electric potential gradient is more pronounced in the case where the
electrolyte is a molten salt solution than in the case where the electro-

lyte is an aqueous ‘solution.

8.3 Calculated Mass Transfer Rates in an Extraction
~ Column Having Nonuniform Bulk Concentrations
The rates at which components transfer between the solvent and
electrolyte phases in a packed column involve many independent variables,
and no attempt will be made to show the effect of each of these varia-
bles. Instead, results will be presented for two operating conditions.

The first is a simple binary exchange process in which the electrolyte

that enters one end of the column contains component 1 but not compo-

..nent 2, while the solvent that enters the opposite end of the column

contains component 2 but not component ‘1. Results are presented for
the cases of an aqueous electrolyte and a molten salt electrolyte, and
for the case where there is no effect of an electric potential gradient.
The second operating condition considered corresponds to an actual
reductive extraction operation involving a molten fluoride mixture and

In making the calculations, the column was divided into 50 axial

of column length was divided into 20 increments of equal thickness.
Calculated values for the concentration profiles for the two transferring
components are shown in Figs. 25-27 for the cases where the electrolyte
phase consists of an aqueous solution or a molten-salt solution and for
the case where the electric potential gradient has no effect. The con-
centrations of the transferring ions have been normalized to their maxi-

mum values to facilitate presentation of the results.

It is apparent from Fig. 27 that an electric potential gradient has

the effect of decreasing the rate at which materials transfer between

the electrolyte and solvent phases, and that this effect is more pro-
nounced when the electrolyte is a molten-salt solution. For the latter
case, the calculated value for the extent to which component 2 transfers
from the solvent to the electrolyte is seen to be in error by about 24%
if the effect of the electric potential gradient is not considered. For
the case where the electrolyte is an aqueous solution, the corresponding

error is about 14%.

8.3.2 Multicomponent Exchange

Table 9 gives the operating conditions for two cases involving
multicomponent exchange in a packed column. The conditions for these
cases correspond to reductive extraction involving the transfer of
uranium, thorium, and lithium between a molten fluoride salt phase (T1.T-
16-12-0.3 mole % LiF-BeF -ThF) -UF ) and liquid bismuth containing reduc-

tant. Although only four cations (Li , Be” , U” , and Th ) are con-

sidered here, calculational methods and computer programs which have
the capability of considering up to ten cations have been developed.
Two elements (Be and F), assumed to be present in the salt phase as
Bet and F , do not transfer to the bismuth phase. In each of the
cases, the solvent phase (bismuth) that enters the column contains no
uranium. In one case, the solvent contains lithium (1 mole %) but no
thorium; in the other, the solvent contains thorium (1 mole %) but no
lithium. The column length is such that the total interfacial area

between the molten salt and bismuth phases is 2000 ems.

The calculated concentration profiles for the two cases are shown

in Figs. 28 and 29. In both cases, the salt and bismuth phases were
essentially in equilibrium with respect to lithium and thorium near ‘the
bismuth inlet. There were no significant differences between the results
obtained when the effect of an electric potential gradient was considered
and when it was neglected. This result is not surprising, however, since
the low concentration of reductant (Li and Th) in the solvent phase dic-
tates that the mass transfer rates are controlled primarily by the resis-
tance to transfer in the solvent phase. Also, uranium is a minor compo-

nent in the electrolyte (molten salt) phase, and the coions act as a

8k Summary

A mathematical analysis hes been’ carried out and computer programs

“have been developed which allow determination of the. importance of the
electric potential gradient that is generated in an electrolyte during
the transfer of materials between an electrolyte. and a solvent phase.

. The effect of the electric potential gradient was found to be of greater
importance when the. electrolyte is a molten salt than when it is an

aqueous ‘solution. In the latter case, the nontransferring coions redis-

tribute in the electrolyte phase in a manner which suppresses the effect

of the electric potential gradient. However, it was shown that

significant errors in calculated mass transfer rate values will result:

under some operating conditions in both cases.

Two cases involving reductive extraction of uranium from a molten
fluoride salt phase into a liquid bismuth phase containing ‘reductant
indicate that neglect of the effect of an electric potential gradient
probably causes essentially no error in calculated mass transfer rates

for reductive extraction operations of interest in MSBR processing.

9. - ENGINEERING STUDIES OF URANIUM OXIDE PRECIPITATION

M. J. Bell* IL. E. McNeese

Studies of the chemistry of protactinium and uranium oxide pre-
cipitation by Baes et sl. have indicated that oxide precipitation may
be an attractive alternative process to fluorination--reductive extrac-
“tion for isolation of protactinium and removal of uranium from the fuel
salt of an MSR. 269 21 Calculations made by Bell and McNeese indicate
that protactinium removal times of 3 to 5 days can be obtained for a
reasonable range of flowsheet variables, and that uranium removal effi-
ciencies of greater than 99% can be realized with relatively few equi-

28,29 Engineering studies of uranium oxide precipitation

are planned in order to study the kinetics of uranium oxide precipitation,
to investigate the size distribution and settling characteristics of

the oxide precipitate, and to gain experience with oxide precipitation
systems. During this report period, an experimental facility was designed
and installation of equipment was initiated. The facility is described

in the remainder of this section.

9.1 Description of Facility

A schematic diagram of the major components of the proposed oxide
precipitation facility is shown in Fig. 30. This facility will allow
‘batch precipitation studies to be made in a vessel containing approx-
imately 2 liters of 72-16-12 mole % LiF-BeF o=ThF), salt that has an
initial UF), ‘concentration of ‘about 0.3 mole %. Oxide will be supplied

to the precipitator in the form of & weter-argon gas mixture that will
be introduced ‘through a draft ‘tube to promote contact of the salt and
oxide. The method proposed for separation of the salt and oxide phases
is decantation of the ‘salt to a receiver vessel after the. oxide has been
allowed to settle for a short ‘period. The facility also includes a
system for supplying hydrogen-KF gas mixtures that will be used for
converting the oxides to fluorides at the conclusion of an experiment.

The off-gas system includes caustic scrubbers for removing HF from the
gas streams in order that information relative to the extent of oxide

precipitation can be obtained by collecting the HF evolved by the pre-

cipitation process. Ball valves on both the feed and precipitator

vessels provide a means for obtaining samples of salt and oxide.

9.2 Precipitator Vessel Design

In order to obtain information applicable to the design of the

precipitator vessel, the experimental system vas simulated using sand

and water initially, and then iron powder and a glycerol-water solution,
in place of oxide and salt; air was employed as the sparge gas. A 1-
in.-diam draft tube was placed ina bein.-diam glass pipe, and the
effects of the distance between the bottom of the draft tube and the
bottom of the vessel, as well as the shape of the vessel bottom, on

the degree of mixing of the solids were determined. It was observed

that only the solids located immediately beneath the draft tube were

entrained in the circulating liquid, and that the system performed most

effectively when the bottom of the draft tube was positioned within a
few millimeters of the bottom of the vessel. When the draft tube was

raised as little as 1/b in. from the bottom, mixing performance became

very poor. It was also observed that, if the solids were allowed to

settle around the bottom of the draft tube, difficulty was sometimes

experienced in resuming circulation of the solid material.

The precipitator vessel that was designed as the result of these -

* observations is described in Table 10 and shown in Fig. 31. The lower

part of the vessel, in which the salt is contained, is a section of
L-in. sched 40 low-carbon nickel pipe. The bottom of the vessel is

machined from a 4-in.-diam low-carbon nickel bar and is tapered at 45°

‘in order to direct the solids under a draft tube that is used to promote

contact of the salt and oxide. The draft tube is constructed of a

section of 1-in. sched 40 nickel pipe that is welded to the gas inlet

tube. The inlet tube also supports a baffle that is used to prevent

large quantities of salt from being carried into the upper part of the

vessel. The upper part of the vessel is constructed of a section of

Flooding data were obtained during the countercurrent flow of molten
salt (66-34 mole % LiF-BeF,) and hydrogen or argon. 3L The objective
of the present work is to study the continuous reduction of iron fluo-
ride in molten salt by countercurrent contact of the salt with hydrogen
in a packed column. We have previously reported on two iron fluoride

© reduction runs that were carried out at 700°C with salt having the
composition 66-34 mole % LiF-BeF, (ref. 32) and nine runs that were
carried out at 700°C with salt having the composition 72.0-14.4-13.6
mole % LiF-BeF o~ThF) . 33

Tron snalyses from semples “taken during the last series of nine
iron fluoride reduction runs have shown considerable scatter (Fig. 32).
Also shown in this figure are the analyses for ten samples taken. after
the last reduction run when the soluble iron (fluoride) concentration
‘should have remained constant. Suspected reesons for the inconsis-
‘tencies are: presence of iron particles suspended in the salt, con-
tamination of the sample during enalysis, and analytical difficulties.
at low iron concentrations. Several tests were carried out during this
report period in order to resolve these questions; the results and con-

clusions are discussed in the remainder of this chapter.

10.1 Tests for Determining the Presence of
Suspended Iron Particles in Salt Samples
~ Tests were made to investigate the possibility that iron particles,
suspended in the molten salt, might be the cause of the occasional high
iron analyses such as those after runs 4, 10, and 11 reported previously.
It is believed that any metal particles which were suspended in the salt
would deposit on metal specimens suspended in the salt. Therefore,

specimens of nickel were suspended in the salt in the feed tank at

| varying depths for 5 to 15 min. Leaching these specimens with HCl

dissolved a negligible amount of iron. To further substantiate the .

absence of iron particles in the salt, four dip (unfiltered) samples

were taken. The iron concentrations in these samples ranged from 65

to 75 ppm, which is equivalent to the concentration in the filtered

samples having the lowest iron content.

that iron particles are not suspended in the salt.

10.2 Tests of Various Sampler Types

Such results~show conclusively

The samplers used during the iron fluoride reduction runs carried

out to date have consisted of 1/4-in.-0D nickel samplers to which a

porous metal filter is attached. The sample size is about 1 g. Removal

of the salt sample from these samplers (via a steel tubing cutter fol-

lowed by crushing) is somewhat difficult and provides a possible source

of iron contamination. Therefore, following the last reduction run,

both filtered and nonfiltered samples were taken in copper samplers,

some of which allow removal of a larger (4-g) sample.

The copper tubing

is more easily crushed, and samples are less likely to be contaminated

with iron during this operation.

Averages of the iron concentrations

for the samples taken after run 11 are shown in Table 12. .

If particles of iron are produced during the reduction
of iron fluoride in the column, the iron does not remain
suspended in the salt for one pass through the system
(column, piping, receiver tank).

Iron analyses below 100 ppm are unreliable with sample
sizes of 1 g or less.

Samples taken with nickel samplers are more subject to
- contamination during removal than are samples from
copper samplers.

10.3 Correlation of Flooding Dats

Typical flow data obtained in the present 1.25-in.-diam, T-ft-long

- packed column sre compared in Fig.. 33 with a flooding velocity corre-

34

lation developed by Sherwood. The following nomenclature is used in

the figure:

wm
It

‘mass velocity of ges, 1b/hr«ft°,

standard gravitational acceleration, £t-1b/1by hr”,

- mass velocity of salt, 1b/hr-f£t2,

2

: £62213 of packing,

salt viscosity, cP,
packing void fraction,
5

‘gas density, 1b/ft3,
salt density, lb/ft’.
The liquid deentrainment section at the top of the column’ had insuffi-
cient capacity to permit flooding. of the column without danger of plug-

ging the column gas outlet with salt, and these data represent near-

maximum flow rates at which the column was still operable. ' However,

the operating conditions are believed to be sufficiently close to

flooding conditions to determine that actual flooding conditions would
_ fall significantly below values predicted by the Sherwood correlation.
