A PRELIMINARY STUDY OF MOLTEN SALT POWER REACTORS

SECTION I

Summary, Recommendations and Acknowledgments

Molten salts provide the basis of a new family of liquid fuel power
reactors. The wide range of solubility of uranium, thorium and plutonium com-
pounds mekes the system flexible, and allows the consideration of a variety of
reactors. Suitable salt mixtures have melting points in the 850-950°F range
and will probably prove to be sufficiently compatible with known alloys to pro-
vide long-lived components, if the temperature is kept below 1300°F, Thus the
salt systems naturally tend to operate in a temperature region suitable for
moéern steam plants and achieve these temperatures in unpressurized systems.

The molten salt reactor system, for purposes other than electric power
generation; is not new. Intensive research and development over the past seven
Years under ANP sponsorship has provided reasonable answers to a majority of the
obvious difficulties. One of the most important of these is the ability to handle
liquids at high temperatures and to maintain them above their melting points. A
great deal of information on the chemical and physical properties of a wide variety
of molten salts has been obtained, and methods: are in operation for their manufac-
ture, purification and handling. It has been found that the simple ionic salts
are stable under radiation, and suffer no deterioration other than the build-up
of fission products.

The molten salt system has the usual benefits attributed to fluid fuel
systems. The principal advantages claimed over solid fuel elements are: (1) the

lack of radiation damage that can limit fuel burn-up; (2) the avoidance of the

 
-2 -

expense of fabricating new fuel elements; (3) the possibility (partially demon-
strated in the ARE) of continuous gaseous fission product removal; (4) a high
negative temperature coefficient of reactivity; and (5) the ability to add make-

up fuel as needed, so that provision of excess reactivity is unnecessary. The

latter two factors make possible a reactor without control rods, which automati-
cally adjusts its power in response to changes of the electrical load. The lack

of excess reactivity can lead to a reactor that is safe from nuclear power excursions.

In comparison with the aqueous systems, the molten salt system has three
outstanding advantages: it allows high temperature with low pressure; explosive
radiolytic gases are not formed; and it provides soluble thorium and plutonium
compounds. The compensating disadvantages, high melting point and basically
poorer neutron economy, are difficult to assess without further work.

Probably the most outstanding characteristics of the molten salt systems
is their chemical flexibility, i.e., the wide variety of molten salt solutions which
are of interest for reactor use. In this respect, the molten salt systems are prac-
tically unique; this 1s the essential advantage which they enjoy over the U-Bi
systems. Thus the molten salt systems are not to be thought of in terms of a
single reactor - rather; they are the basis for a new class of reactors. Included
in this class are all of the embodiments which comprise the whole of solid fuel
element technology: straight a or Pu burner, Th-U or Pu-U thermal converter or
breeder; Th-U or Pu-U fast converters or breeders. Of possible short-term interest
is the Ue? or Pu straight burner: because of the inherently high temperatures and
because there are no fuel elements, the fuel cost in the salt system can be of the
order of 2 mills/kwh. Moreover, the molten salt system is, except for the molten
Pu alloy system, probably the only system which will allow plutonium to be burned

at high temperature in liquid form.

”
- 3 -

The state of present technology suggests that homogeneous converters

using a base salt composed of BeF,, and either 1a!

2
fuel and ThE), for a fertile material, are more suitable for early reactors than

F or NaF, and using UF), for

are graphite moderated reactors or Pu fueled reactors. The conversion ratio in
such an early system might reach 0.6. The chief virtues of this class of molten
salt reactor are that it is based on well explored principles and that the use of
8 simple fuel cycle should lead to low fuel cycle costs.

With further development, the same base salt (using 117) can be com-
bined with a graphite moderator in a heterogeneous arrangement to provide a
self-contained thorium-U°>- system with a breeding ratio of about one. The chief
advantage of the molten salt system over other liquid systems in pursuing this
objective is, as has been mentioned, that it is the only system in which a soluble
thorium compound can be used, and thus the problem of slurry handling is avoided.

Plutonium is an alternate fuel in the fluoride salt system. Only moderate
breeding ratios are expected in thermal or epithermal reactors, but a small, highly
concentrated fluoride reactor may be fast enough to provide a breeding ratic of one.
Eventually the use of chloride salts might provide a fast plutonium reactor with
& breeding gain, although this would require use of separated a’, The plutonium
system needs additional research to determine the stability of Pu compounds and
to provide a suitable chemical processing system.

The present report is primarily intended to summarize the state of the
molten salt art as applied to civilian power. The report is divided into three
parts. Section I is the summary and recommendations. Section II is a survey of
the state of molten salt technology. Section IIT is an analysis of one possible

T

molten salt reactor embodiment - a two region converter based on the fuel 69 ILi'F -

30 BeF, -1 UF), and the blanket composition Th 11 TF - 26 ThF), This embodiment,
 

- hh

called the reference design, has been examined carefully, primarily to bring to

focus the problems which may arise if a full-scale molten salt system were to be

built soon.

The conclusion which we can draw from our study of the molten salt

situation is that a large-scale molten salt reactor - either a straight U burner

or a non-breeding converter - could be built; but that prior to building, two

important questions should be answered:

1.

Will any molten salt reactor produce economical power? Our study
shows the answer is probably yes, provided longevity of components

can be assured. Hence the issue depends on the second question:

From what we know about materials compatibility, how likely are we

to develop a salt and a container metal which will last for many

years of operation? This is the central issue in the civilian molten
salt nuclear power reactor program. The information gathered by the

ANP project, added to our general knowledge of the mechanism of attack
on metals (particularly INOR-8) by fluorides, suggests that the outlook
for a solution to this problem is very good. However, very little long-
term testing at power reactor temperatures (~- 1200°F) has been done;
our recommendations, therefore, center around the necessity for acquir-
ing this long-term data as soon as possible. Should these tests demon-
strate the long-term compatibility of materials, there will still be
required the development of reliable large-scale components. Experience
on ANP indicates that this part of the development should not present

major difficulties.
Recommendations

In view of the preceding, we recommend:

1. The long-term corrosion resistance of the proposed alloys in the
salts that could be used in a power reactor should be established. This will
involve the operation of a number of pumped loops incorporating a temperature
gradient, to be operated at the temperature of interest for periods of at least
a year.

2. The effects of radiation and fission product build-up on the com~
patibility of the salt and alloy should be thoroughly investigated. At least
two in-pile pumped loops simulating the condition in a molten salt reactor should
be operated for a long period of time. These in-pile loop tests should be supple=-
mented by small-scale studies of the behavior of fission products.

3. It is recommended that a modest reactor study effort be maintained.
Different embodiments of molten salt reactors would be examined, so that if favor-
able results from Items (1) and (2) are obtained, it will be possible to recommend
a specific reactor, probably a burner or converter, for design and construction.
Also, the problem of remote maintenance, which is shared by all circulating fuel
reactors, could be examined in further detail.

4. Since there is always a time lag between the initiation of research
and the availability of practical developments, it is recommended that a modest
research program aimed at longer term possibilities be maintained. Objectives
would be (a) the incorporation of a solid moderator, (b) utilization of plutonium
in the molten salt system, (c) better alloys, and (4d) improved fission product

removal systems.

SECTION II

Survey And Analysis Of The State Of Molten Salt Power Reactor Technology

In the research and development program carried out by the ANP for
the construction of the ARE and future high performance reactors, much technical
information has been derived which is applicable to power reactors. The purpose
of this section 1s to abstract the information that is most pertinent to the con-
struction of power reactors, and to provide adequate references to document
properly the summaries given. This has been supplemented by studies of nuclear
characteristics of homogeneous one and two region power reactors. It will be
seen that most of the information required to design & practical power reactor
is available. However, long-term tests of materials and components are lacking,

and they must be supplied by a power reactor research and development program.

The most promising systems are those comprising the fluorides and chlorides of
the alkali metals, zirconium, and beryllium. These appear to possess the most
desirable combination of low neutron absorption, high solvent power, and chemical
inertness. In general; the chlorides have lower melting points, but appear to

be less stable and more corrosive then the fluorides. The use of chlorides in

a homogeneous fast reactor would be preferable except that the strong (n,p)
reaction exhibited by c1>? would necessitate the separation of the chlorine
isotopes.

The fluoride systems appear to be preferable for use in thermal and
epithermal reactors. Many mixtures bave been investigated, mainly at ORNL and
at Mound Isboratory. The physical properties cf these mixtures, in so far as
they are known, have been tabulated by Cohen et al 2/, Phase studies are exten-

The capture cross sections at higher energies presumably stand in

approximately the same relation as at thermal. It is seen that purified Li
an attractively low cross section in comparison to the other alkali metals, and
that sodium is the next best alkali metal.

The fluorides of Ii, Na, K, and Rb melt at 1550, 1820, 1560, and 1460°F,

melting points and compositions shown in Table II.

With the possible exception of the first, these combinations are too
high melting to be attractive as fuels; however, the eutectics of UF), with IiF
and NaF might be suitable for use in the blanket of a two region plutonium breeder-
converter. Binary mixtures containing less than 1.0 mole percent UF), do not exhibit
liquidus temperatures below 1450°F.

IiF and NaF form an eutectic melting at 1204°F &, Smell additions of
UF), raise the liquidus temperature slightly. The ternary eutectic melts somewhat
below 840°F and contains approximately 30 mole percent UF), . This system is attrac-

tive only as a blanket material.

The Na-Zr fluoride system has been extensively studied at ORNL and a
phase diagram published 9, An eutectic containing about 42 mole percent ZrF)
melts at 910°F. Small additions of UF), lower the melting point appreciably.

A fuel of this type was successfully used in the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.
Inconel is reasonably resistant to corrosion by this system at 1500°F. Although
long-term data are lacking, there is theoretical reason to expect the corrosion
rate at 1200°F to be sufficiently low that Inconel equipment would last several
years.

However, in relation to its use in a central station power reactor,
the Na-Zr fluoride system has several serious disadvantages. The Na capture
cross section is less favorable than the 117 cross section. More important,
recent data 1/ indicate that the capture cross section of Zr is intolerably
high in the epithermal and intermediate neutron energy ranges. In addition,
there is the so-called "snow" problem, i.e, ZrF) tends to evaporate from the
fuel and crystallize on surfaces exposed to the vapor. In comparison to the
Ii-Be system discussed below; the Na-Zr system has inferior heat transfer and
cooling effectiveness. Finally, the expectation at Oak Ridge is that the INOR-8
alloys will prove to be as resistant to the Be salts as to the Zr salts, and that
there is, therefore, no compelling reason for selecting the Na-Zr system.

The capture cross section of beryllium appears to be satisfactorily
low at all energles. A new phase diagram for the system IiF-BeF. has recently

Substantial concentrations of ThF) in the core fluid may be obtained by
blending Mixture 74 with 3 IiF - ThF) , and a liquidus temperature diagram for the
ternary system has been determined 15/, The liquidus temperature along the join
between Mixture 74 and 3 LiF ° ThF), appears to lie below 920°F for mixtures con-
taining up to 10 mole percent ThF) . The liquidus temperature thereafter rises
slowly at first, and then more rapidly. Small additions of UF), to any of these
mixtures should lower the liquidus temperature somewhat.
No data on the system NeF-BeF,-ThF) are available; however, the solubility

of ThF) and other physical properties are expected to be nearly as good as for the

Ii-Be system.

The stability of alkali fluorides and zirconium fluoride toward heat
and radiation seems to be well established by the work at Oak Ridge. Beryllium
fluoride is thermally stable at temperatures of interest; preliminary in-pile
tests 18/ indicate that BeF,, is as stable toward radiation, including fission
fragments, as ZrF) .

The compatibility of the systems under consideration with container
materials and adjacent fluids is dealt with in later sections, as is also the
problem of processing irradiated fuels. Costs are listed in Section II-F.

On the basis of presently available information, the fuel carrier
salts which have been considered appear to stand in the following order of pre-
ference: IiF-BeF,; NaF-BeF,; IiF-NaF-BeF,. The LiF-BeF, system has slightly

better moderating power, lower parasitic absorption (if high purity Ii' can be
obtained), and adequate solubility for ThE), and UF), . It may prove to be more

corrosive than the NaF-BeF, system, and the cost is greater.

2. Blanket Material Evaluation

 

The Ii-Be-Th fluoride mixtures recommended above as fuel carrier appear
to be suitable for use in the blanket of a two region reactor. There is evidence?
that these mixtures when containing no UF), are much less corrosive than fuel bear-
ing mixtures. As mentioned above, a mixture containing 10 mole percent ThF) has
(according to the diagram on p. 962, Vol. 2 of The Reactor Handbook) a liquidus
temperature of 932°F., If a safety margin of 100°F is specified, the minimum

blanket inlet temperature would be 1032°F,

It might be possible to dispense with the BeF,, and use a mixture of
IiF and ThE) . A phase diagram for this system is given 20/, The compound

The density was estimated by the method of Cohen 21/ to be 4.55 g/cc at 1112°F,
and the melt contains about 2700 grams of thorium per liter of solution. The
viscosity has not been reported, but is not expected to be greater than 7 cp at
1100°F. The corrosion rate in Inconel is low 22/, Additions of NaF to this com-

pound should lower the liquidus temperature appreciably, perhaps as much as 100°F.

3. Intermediate Coolants

From the standpoint of simplicity, it would be desirable to transfer the
reactor heat directly from the circulating fuel to the steam. This, however, has
several serious disadvantages, among them being the induction of radioactivity in
the steam by delayed neutrons, the danger of contamination of the power-producing
equipment by leakage of fuel into the power loop, and the danger of nuclear or
other accidents in case of leakage of water into the core system. It therefore
seems desirable to employ intermediate coolants.

Among the intermediate coolants considered were water, organic liquids,
liquid metals, and molten salts. High pressure, and nuclear and chemical compati-
bility with fuel eliminate water. The organic liquids have poor thermal stability

above '1100°F. Among liquid metals, sodium (or NeK), mercury, lead, and bismuth

transfer effects). Mercury has poor heat transfer characteristics and has

special problems of containment. |
Sodium has relatively good heat transfer characteristics, can be

readily pumped, but is chemically incompatible with both UF), bearing salts

and water. The reaction of sodium with a Zr based fuel in a pump loop with

a simulated leak was investigated by L. A. Mann 23/, 2/, It appears that slow

addition of sodium to the system LiF-BeF,-UF) would result first in the reduc-

precipitate at concentrations of UF), under consideration. The UF and ThE),
would be reduced next, and then the BeF,. Solid phases containing uranium

2
metal would probably be formed shortly after the reduction of the thorium begins.

Molten salts considered for intermediate coolants include Mixtures Th
(three variations), 12 and 84. A study of these, together with metallic sodium,
was performed by means of a simplified systems analysis. The results, together
with relevant physical properties, are listed in Table IV. It is seen that Mix-
ture Th-A, which is the base recommended for the fuel mixture, has a melting
point too high for safety, being only 3),0p less than the proposed intermediate
coolant inlet temperature (1000°F). Mixture T4-C has a satisfactorily low
melting point, but the viscosity (14.0 cp) seems excessive. Mixture T4-B appears
to be suitable from standpoint of both melting point and viscosity. It would
also be completely compatible with a fuel based on Mixture T4. Ieakage of Mix-

ture TL-B into the fuel circuit would not result in the formation of precipitates,

would not contaminate the fuel provided the lithium were of the same isotopic >
composition as that in the fuel, and could only decrease the reactivity by dilu-
tion of the fuel. It should be possible to tolerate small, continuous leaks in

normal operation.

 

On the other hand, salts containing beryllium are incompatible with
sodium metal, which displaces beryllium from the fluoride compound. The reaction
is expected to be energetic and rapid, but not explosive, since no gases are
formed 25/, It was estimated from the heat of formation data given by Quill et
al 26/ that the addition of one mole of sodium to BeF, would release about 30 Kcal
of heat at 1000°F. This is sufficient to raise the temperature of the stoichio-
metric mixture about 1%00°F gbove the initial temperature. In addition, the
beryllium metal formed would deposit throughout the system and might lead to
embrittlement of the material of construction. The consequences of the leak-
age of sodium metal into LiF-BeF, thus could be serious.
Mixture 12 (a Flinak) appears to be completely inert toward sodium.
From a heat transfer standpoint, it appears to have a slight advantage over Mix-
ture T4-B, as shown in Table IV, where the required heat transfer areas are compared.
Mixture 12 may be slightly more corrosive than Mixture Th 25/ but the corrosion in
the intermediate coolant loop is not expected to be eritical because of the lower
temperatures prevailing there. It has fairly good compatibility with a fuel based
on Mixture Th (I1F-BeF,).. Small leaks of Mixture 12 into the core system probably

would not result in the formation of precipitates. The potassium would poison the

nuclear reaction, as would also any 118 present. Iarger leaks might lead to the

precipitation of binary compounds of XF with UF), and ThF), . Precipitation of
UF), outside the core would tend to decrease the reactivity in the core; the
precipitation of ThF), would have the opposite effect. The precise course of
events cannot at present be predicted, but it seems doubtful that the reactivity
increase due to the precipitation of ThF), could override the decreases due to
the precipitation of UF), and the addition of K and 11°.

On the basis of these considerations, Mixture 12 would appear the
safest choice of intermediate coolant.

By comparing the results listed for metallic sodium in Table IV with
those for the salts, the penalty imposed by the use of salts as intermediate
coolants can be assessed. The heat transfer areas and fuel holdup volumes are
significantly less with sodium. The power consumption for pumping fuel and
sodium is excessive for the case where the tube pitch is the minimum allowable.

Doubling the tube pitch reduces the pumping power to a negligibly low level

without increasing the heat transfer area or fuel volume excessively.

4. Container Materials

The feasibility of the molten salt reactor system depends in large
measure cn the existence of a suitable container material. Any corrosion of
the container metal must be slow enough so that components will be long-lived.
The container material must be obtainable in sufficient quality and quantities
from commercial vendors, must be fabricable into suitable shapes, and must have
satisfactory strength, creep characteristics, and other physical properties at
the operating temperatures to be encountered.

Several hundred high temperature static and dynamic tests have been
carried out since 1950 to determine which materials were most practical for con-

tainment of the fluoride salts 27/, Of the pure metals, molybdenum, columbium

and nickel were outstanding in corrosion resistance, but were eliminated for

reasons of fabrication difficulties and/or physical property shortcomings. From

the numerous alloys tested, Inconel was selected for extensive additional testing
and study in both thermal convection and pumped loops containing large temperature
gradients. Iater work has indicated the greater desirability of a nickel-molybdenum
alloy, INOR-8, and ORNL at present is active in trying to bring it into status as

ea commercial alloy.

Both Inconel and INOR-8 alloys contain chromium. Their mechanism of
corrosion 28/ in NaF-ZrF) salts has been determined to be the diffusion of chromium
to the hottest metal surface, its solution in the salt there, and the diffusion of
chromium into the colder metal surfaces. In this way, subsurface voids ar= created
in the hottest region, from which the chromium is removed. The usual mechanism of
the corrosion is the same for both Inconel and INOR-8 alloy, and it is therefore
presumed that the general relationships of corrosion rate to time, temperature,
and other test conditions found by analysis of hundreds of thermal convection
and pumped loop tests for Inconel in the NaF-ZrF) salt will also hold for INOR-8.
With other salts there is the possibility of the deposition of free Cr metal in
the cold region, thus changing the rate limiting mechanism.

In tests of Inconel against Fuel-30 (50% NaF, 46% ZrF) , 4% UF),

. approximately the same corrosion rates were found for both thermal convection
loops and pumped loops in which a 200°F to 300°F temperature difference was
maintained between the hot and cold sections. The depth of corrosion was found

to depend primarily on the metal wall temperatures 29/, Most tests were carried

 

28/ ORNL-2106, Parts 1-5, p. 96

- 20 -

out at maximum metal wall temperatures of 1600-1700°F, 1000-hour pumped loop
tests at 1600°F wall temperature typically give corrosion depths of 5 to 7
mils, and this increases to 9 to 10 mils at 1700°F. Thermal convection loops
with maximum wall temperatures estimated to be as low as 1350°F give 2000 hours
corrosion of 7 mils, as compared to corrosion of 13 mils at 1640°F. Thus the
existence of a temperature ccefficient is known, but its magnitude is uncertain
for extrapolating down to wall temperatures of 1200°F.

With a maximum wall temperature of about 1600°F, the corrosion in the
usual pumped loops is about 3 mils in the first 15 hours, and 3 to 4 mils per
1000 hours after that. The longest tests were run for 3000 hours (14-mil attack)
and 8300 hours or about one year (25-mil attack). The time dependence is consis-
tent with the theory that in the first 15 hours, the salt becomes saturated with
chromium, and that after this initial period, the rate limiting step is that of
diffusion of the chromium into the walls at the cold temperature. Attempts to
show an increase of corrosion rate with an increase in area of the cold wall
section were inconclusive, however.

Early thermal convection loops 30/ operated at 1500°F showed a depend-
ence of corrosion on the difference in temperature between hot and cold legs, with
corrosion being decreased by a factor of 2 by lowering the temperature difference
to 150°F. Tests with pumped loops 3Y/ while not conclusive, suggest that tempera-
ture drops of greater than 200°F noticeably increase the attack, but that decreasing

the. temperature drop from 200°F to 100°F does not correspondingly reduce the attack.

The UF), content of the salt definitely contributes to the corrosion 32/

probably because of the reduction of UF), to UF, by oxidation of chromium. A

3
reduction of uranium concentration from 4 mole percent to the less than one per-
cent suitable for a power reactor will substantially reduce the corrosion rate.

These data have been interpreted to indicate that with the 1200°F peak
temperature contemplated for a power reactor, the maximum depth of void formation
would not exceed 10 mils in one year or 20 mils in three years with Inconel. The
thinnest hot metal section will occur at the heat exchanger tubes, and these could
be designed to allow for a 3-year operation, as far as weakening due to corrosion
is concerned.

Tests on salts other than Composition-30 against Inconel have in most
cases yielded higher corrosion rates. In particular, lithium fluoride salts
are about twice as corrosive as Fuel-30 when tested against Inconel at a metal
temperature of 1600°F 33/, Under these conditions the LiF salts form a dendritic
growth of Cr in the cold leg.

A great many tests have been run on low chromium, low iron; nickel-
molybdenum alloys, but most of these have been at 1600°F wall temperature or
higher, and have been for fixed periods of 500 to 1000 hours. These nickel-
molybdenum alloys uniformly give low corrosion depths of the order of 1/2 to
2 mils under these conditions, and are thus estimated to be at least 5 times as
resistant to corrosion as Inconel is to Fuel-30. Most of the tests on the nickel-
molybdenum alloys have been with the more corrosive salts containing lithium

fluoride; within the limits of the low corrosion rates, there does not seem to

be much dependence on the particular molten salts used.

If this superiority of performance can be extrapolated to lower tempera-
tures and longer times, the nickel-molybdenum alloy INOR-8 can be expected to
produce reactor components which should last many years before failure due to
corrosion. Obviously, what is needed here is some long-term testing under the
temperature and radiation condi tions desired for a power reactor.

Other alloys now being examined by ORNL may prove even better for the
power reactor than INOR-8. These alloys do not contain chromium, and the omission
of chromium may result in complete thermodynamic stability of the container 2:d
salt, There remains the question of mass transfer attack as a result of tempera -
ture gradients. One of the alloys being tested substitutes niobium for chromium
in the INOR-8 type alloy and is currently being called INOR-9. It is not clear,
however, just how much work on new alloys will be undertaken without active
sponsorship from a power reactor program.

5. Moderator Materials

The highest breeding ratios for molten salt thermal reactors will be
obtained with the use of a supplementary moderator. Although the salt Mixture-Th4 .
has a slowing down power of 60 percent that of normal reactor graphite, its slow
neutron absorption is about 4 times that of graphite, and the lower neutron absorp-
tion of the mixed moderator and salt is definitely beneficial in breeding ratio.

Moderator materials that can most readily be considered in this high
temperature system are beryllium metal, beryllium oxide, and graphite. The former
two require canning for protection from the salt, and since the cenning materials
have rather high neutron cross sections, their value in obtaining an improved
neutron economy is questionable. Uncenned graphite is the best hope for a moderator
that will provide good neutron economy.

Several graphite samples have been tested which show very little pene-

tration by the molten salt in short-term tests %/, It is reasonable to expect

 

36/ ORNL-2221, p. 158

CO
 

- 25 -

that one or more of these grades could be made commercially if longer term tests
confirm their penetration resistance, particularly under the effects of radiation.
The other problem associated with the use of graphite in direct contact
with the salt is whether or not the metals of the system will become carburized.
Preliminary tests with Inconel and Fuel-30 show no detrimental effects in 100
hours 31/, Further testing with other metals is underway, and there is hope that
a suitable metal system for use with bare graphite and a molten salt will be
developed. However, much more experimental work is required to demonstrate the

practicality of a molten salt~unclad graphite system.

B. Materials

This section is a survey of the factors involved in selecting com=-
ponents, including an appraisal of the experience in actual operations.

All equipment and controls which are parts of, or directly affect, the
reactor: molten salt systems, liquid metal systems, and radioactive gas systems,
require components of much higher quality and greater dependability than has been
generally accepted as "commercial practice" in steam-electric plants. It should
be strongly emphasized that the high quality demanded of these systems is actually
necessary, and must be achieved because of the difficulty of maintenance of highly
radioactive systems. Experience at the development laboratory level has shown
that, with proper attention to detail, the standards of quality required are prac-
tical of attainment. Specifications and procedures have been rather thoroughly
developed and detailed. The importance of the strictest possible quality control

and inspection of absolutely every step can hardly be overemphasized.

 

37/ ORNL-2221, p. 187

 
- 26 -

All items not involved in handling molten salts, molten metals, or
radioactive solids, liquids, or gases require only the same standards of quality
as conventional installations. This includes turbines, condensers, feed-water
heaters; water pumps, generators, and electrical gear, together with their
instrumentation, controls, and auxiliary equipment, and most of the building

and building services.

1. Pumps

The choice of pumps for liquid metals is among three proven types:

(1) electromagnetic; (2) canned rotor; and (3) gas-sealed. The frozen seal 28/
type may be sufficiently proven within the next two or three years to add to
the list, when more actual operating data are available.

Electromagnetic pumps of several! different designs have been success-
fully operated with little or no trouble or several years. Among the larger
users are: General Eiectric Company at KAI'L; Aircraft Reactor Engineering Divi-
sion (ARED) at ORNL; North American Aviation Company (Atomics International);
Westinghouse; Mine Safety Appliances Company, Callery, Pennsylvania; Brookhaven
National Laboratory; and Argonne National laboratory. Among other users are
Battelle Memorial Institute, Allis-Chalmers Company, and Babcock and Wilcox
Company. Most applications have been at temperatures below 900°F, and at rather
low capacities of only a few gallons per minute. Some experience exists at ORNL
and other places at temperatures up to 1500°F and higher. EM pumps of 5000 gpm
at 100 psi and even higher capacities are advertised for sale by General Electric
Company, Westinghouse Electric Company, Allis-Chalmers Company, and perhaps others.
Very recently, EM pumps with efficiencies greater than 20 percent are reported

to have been developed 29/,

Canned rotor pumps for liquid metals have been developed in the past
three or four years by Westinghouse, Allis-Chalmers, and others for high perform-
ance operation. Some difficulties inherent in canned rotor pumps are: friction
problems in bearings during start-up and shutdown operations; low efficiencies;
thin and relatively fragile walls between stator and rotor, and the requirement
for keeping the temperature of rotor and stator low.

Both EM pumps and canned rotor pumps have the advantage of being
"sealless", that is, there is no communication via packing or gas passages to
the surrounding atmosphere. This is a major engineering advantage in pumping
oxygen-~sensitive liquid metals, obviating any need for more or less elaborate
sealing mechanisms. Each has the disadvantage of low efficiency and lack of
long-time proof testing with liquid metals at temperatures above TOO or 800°F.

Gas-sealed centrifugal pumps of are at present the most adequately
proven pumps for moving either liquid metal or molten salts at temperatures above
800°F. Efficiencies are good; no different than for centrifugal pumps in general.
The limits of head and capacity are similar to those of the ordinary centrifugal
pump. More than usual "overhang" (distance from nearest bearing to impeller) is
required, so that the seals and bearings can be maintained at a low temperature.
Gas-sealed pumps were used exclusively for molten salt and liquid metals in the
ARE operation, and in the scores of high performance, high temperature (2000°F
to 1700°F) heat exchanger tests, pump tests, pumped system tests; in-pile loop

tests, etc., operated by ARED for pumping both molten salts and liquid metals W/,

The largest capacity high temperature pumps used to date by ANP are about 1200
gpm at 370 feet of head at 1200°F and higher temperatures. Pumps of this type
are advertised commercially in capacities to 20,000 gpm. Their degree of
reliability is not known at ORNL.

The two most vulnerable parts of gas-sealed centrifugal pumps are
(1) the seal and (2) the bearings. To date, at ORNL, bearings are lubricated
by cireulating oil, a small part of which is also used to lubricate the seal.
Both the seal and the nearest bearing are usually within 18 inches of the pumped
liquid. Therefore, pumps for radioactive fluids require shielding of the bear-
ing and sesl region and provision for replacement of the lubricant as it gradually
becomes damaged by radiation. Provisions for such replacement are included in
the ART pumps and lubricant systems designs k2/,

Gas-sealed centrifugal pumps have been operated by ANP at 1200°F
for durations up to 8000 hours without bearing, seal, or other pump mainten-
ance. The operation of such pumps is now considered by ANP to be routine and
trouble-free. While some work is continuing there on the further refinement of
seals and shielding, the chief present use of such pumps in the Experimental
Engineering Division is to serve tests of other components requiring pumped hot
liquids (e.g.; heat exchanger and radiator tests).

Possible future improvements in gas-sealed pumps for high temperature
liquids include the use of hydrodynamic bearings and liquid centrifugal seals.

Hydrodynamic bearings could reduce or remove the need for compromising
between "overhang" from the nearest oil-lubricated bearing and radiation damage
to the lubricant. Before using in a reactor system, a development program involv-
ing tests at operating temperatures, flows and heads would be required. A
difficulty is the close clearance, without rubbing, required between rotating

and static parts.

Iiquid seals similar to mercury seals sometimes used in Laboratory
bench tests would allow relaxation of tolerances now required in the mechanical
seals employed. A problem is the length of available sealing annulus required
for handling possible pressure surges. The combination of a liquid seal with
a hydrodynamic bearing would appear a good future prospect for power reactors.

Where two or more gas-sealed pumps operate in parallel, free flow
between the liquid-to-gas interfaces in the pumps must be provided in order to
prevent surging of the level in one pump significantly above the levels in the
other pumps. The close coupling can be accomplished by providing large connect-
ing flow channels to maintain approximately equal levels in all the parallel
pumps of any one system, or, preferably, by containing the parallel pumps in
one single reservoir.

Pump design is well enough understood that larger pumps of a proven
type can be designed so that they can be confidently expected to deliver the
flows and heads calculated. However, a modest development program should be
expected and a series of thorough prove-in tests will be required before pro-

curing larger pumps on a routine basis.

2. Heat Exchangers

Heat exchangers for a power reactor will differ greatly in general
design from those used in the ANP reactors. The removal of space and weight
limitations allows the heat exchangers to be designed to minimize stresses and
reduce construction difficulties. On the other hand, the ANP data on heat
transfer coefficients and fluid flow, the metallurgy involved in fabrication,
and the chemistry of corrosion are invalusble in the design of a power reactor

heat transfer system.
- 30 -

To minimize thermal stresses, the heat exchangers should normally be
of U-shaped construction. The two tube sheets are then side by side, and the
individual tubes are free to expand longitudinally with very little consequent
stress in the tube-to-tube sheet joints.

Countercurrent flow, which has two advantages, is possible with the
U-shaped configuration. Counter flow exchangers, in any given application,
require less heat transfer area, and have lower maximum local temperature dif-
ference between the two fluids than for any other configuration. The maximum
temperature drop through the tube wall, and thus the tube wall thermal stress,
is consequently lower.

Although thermal stresses due to temperature differences between the
internal and external walls of the exchanger tubing tend to be relieved by creep
under steady operating conditions, the unavoidability of some thermal cycling
requires that such stresses be considered. They can be minimized by using thin
tube walls which yield a small temperature difference between the inner and outer
surface. The small temperature drop through the wall is desirable in itself,
because it allows higher steam temperatures for the same fuel temperature. These
factors must be balanced against choosing the tube wall thickness for maximum
reliability. Tube walls greater than 20 percent of the diameter are poor from
the tube fabrication standpoint; but for small diameter tubes, this 20 percent
limit should probably be approached closely to minimize weakening effects asso-
ciated with high temperature immersion in the molten salt.

Sample calculations have shown that where minimum fluid volume has
great importance; the tube diameter should be as small as the technology will
allow for economical and reliable manufacture. The ease and reliability of
manufacture as a function of heat exchanger tube diameter have not been accu-

rately assessed. However, ANP experience with Inconel indicates that simple

-
- 31 -

fusion welds can be made for tubes between one-quarter inch and one-half inch
in diameter, and that for appreciably larger tubes, filler metal will have to
be added while welding. The present indications are that 5/16-inch and 3/8-inch
diameter tubing may be desirable.

ANP experience indicates that the weakest places in a heat exchanger
are in the neighborhood of tube-to-tube sheet joints, where stresses tend to be
a maximum. Thus special attention must be given to the design and metallurgical
aspects of this problem.. For the molten salt heat exchangers, the following types
of Joint are all possibilities, and the one chosen will be determined by further

development.

a. Face welded joint
The tube sheet is machined so that through most of its thickness, the

hole diameter is appreciably larger than the tube diameter. The remaining thick-
ness of the tube sheet is drilled to match the tube 0.D. closely, and a trepan
1s machined to leave a thin section of the tube sheet to be welded to the tube
end. This type joint can be fusion welded for tube wall thicknesses no greater
than 0.060 inch. The presence of a crevice on the outside of the tube, where

it enters the tube sheet, precludes the use of such a joint with water or steam
on the shell side of the exchanger, since chlorides and other impurities will
collect in such cracks and cause embrittlement. No comparable phenomenon has
been observed with sodium or molten salt heat exchangers, however, and such a .

crevice may not be detrimental in them.

b. Back brazed joint

Brazing, or seal welding with back brazing, has been used extensively
in the ANP program. This avoids stress concentrations in the joints which might

lead to cracking, but the metallurgy of the braze may cause difficulty for

 
- 32 -

long-life applications. Diffusion of braze metal constituents into the tube
wall may cause embrittlement. For the salts, 100-hour tests on gold-nickel
alloy brazing have indicated corrosion resistance and little tendency to

diffusion 3/,

¢. Butt-welded joint

In this joint, the tubing is butt-welded to a nipple which may be
forged on the tube side of the tube sheet. The resulting joint is perhaps the
most satisfactory of all, but the fabrication is the most difficult, particularly
in small size tubes. Further testing is required before this type joint can be
considered as proven technology for the desired tube sizes.

All salt-to-salt heat exchangers should be constructed entirely of
INOR-8 for resistance to corrosion. It is probable that salt-to-sodium heat
exchangers can be made from INOR-8 also; however, this is subject to confirma-
tion of low mass transfer of nickel in sodium circuits by tests over long periods
of time. In the event that excessive mass transfer rates are encountered, a
duplex construction, with INOR-8 on the salt side and 316 stainless steel on the
sodium side; can be used. Construction with duplex tubing is more difficult and
probably less reliable, but has been used in other applications.

The situation in regard to sodium-to-water or steam boilers or super-
heaters is being intensively studied by several organizations at the present
time, and it is anticipated that considerable progress in defining the best
solution will be made in the next two years. The basic difficulty is that leaks
develop, probably starting as small stress-corrosion cracks originating from the

water side. Both impure water and impure sodium are very corrosive, so that a

 

43/  ORNL-193k
- 335 -

small leak quickly spreads. The problem is either to achieve perfection in

leak-proof construction, or to design the system so that small leaks can be

detected quickly. One way of accomplishing leak detection is to have a double

tube construction, with a leak detecting fluid between the tubes. In one case,

mercury is used as the intermediate fluid; others are trying an inert gas be-

tween tubes that make a partial metallic contact. Either of these solutions

requires large area boilers and superheaters because of the decreased heat

transfer coefficients.

Another approach is to use single walled tubes, but to use double

tube sheets, with the tubes sealed to each tube sheet. The idea behind this is

that leakage will be most probable into the space between the two headers and

can be detected there. This approach has been used in a steam generator on the

HRT project, and can be adapted to sodium-to-water boilers and superheaters.

Inconel has been suggested as a good material for the boilers and

superheaters, since it is not ordinarily subject to stress-corrosion cracking,

and the consequences of a small leak should be considerably lessened. Alternately,

ferritic steel, such as 2 1/4 Croloy, could be used in the boiler and either a

ferritic or an austenitic stainless steel, such as type 316, could be used in

the

high temperature service of the superheater. This is standard power plant

practice and can be adapted directly, since both metals are compatible with

sodium. If the austenitic steel is used for the superheater, it must be pro-

tected from any but dry steam. For this reason, a once-through boiler, delivering

slightly superheated steam to the superheater, is indicated.

Se

are:

Reactor Vessels
The design requirements of the core vessel of a circulating fuel reactor

(1) geometry to fulfill nuclear requirements; (2) compatibility of container
- 34 -

material(s) and liquid(s); (3) a fluid flow pattern which will, without excessive
fluid pressure drop, prevent local stagnation or eddies that might cause harmful
temperature transients; (4) low neutron poisoning by materials of construction;
and (5) adequate safety against core shell failure from mechanical or thermal
stress level or stress cycling.

Fortunately, criteria (1) and (2) are relatively easily fulfilled in
a circulating homogeneous molten salt fuel reactor system. Criterion (3) can
be fulfilled for low power density cores (less than 250 w/cc) by employing the
data and experience of the aqueous homogeneous reactor project and by tests in
transparent prototype mockup of actual geometry and fluid flow types. Criterion
(5) can be fulfilled by good choice of basic geometry and competent stress analysis
and adequate design safety factors. Criterion (4) can be satisfied more easily
for single region than for two region reactors because little or no material of
construction is needed in the region of high flux. Possibly further improvements
in this respect may be made in the future (e.g., if improvements in technology
allow for use of graphite as the core shell material). One of the main advantages
of eirculating molten salt systems is the low pressure level and the consequent
low mechanical stress.

It should be noted here that the extreme complication of design of the
interior of reactor cores which has already become traditional with solid fuel
elements, moderators, control rods, etc., is virtually eliminated by the use of

a homogeneous fuel; moderator, and, to some extent at least, reflector.

a. Choice of number of regions

 

Involved in the choice of number of regions are: (1) transmutation
ratio potentiality; (2) ability to manufacture "pure" "2 or Pu; (3) flexi-

bility of operation and experimentation (different composition fluids in core

 
- 35 -
and blanket); and (4) cost of inventory, fabrication, and processing. These
aspects are discussed elsewhere in this report. More auxiliary equipment
(storage tanks, fill-and-drain tanks, pumps, heat exchangers, instruments,

ete.) will, of course, be required for a two region system.

b. Single region reactor vessels

 

For low neutron leakages, single region reactors are large. In terms
of spheres, calculations indicate that the optimum diameter is between 10 and 20
feet, probably about 1k feet hh Uranium concentration decreases with diameter
increase and increases with increasing concentration of thorium. Note that the
external volume of fuel is independent of reactor size, but external holdup of
uranium is linear with concentration of uranium in the fuel.

Container shape is an important fabrication parameter. Precise, final
geometry will depend on optimized compromises determined by studies of: (1) nuclear
characteristics; (2) fluid dynamics, including temperature transient studies;

(3) stress analysis; (4) availability and fabricability of materials of construc-
tion; and (5) costs. In general, spheres are optimum from nuclear considerations,
cylinders for fabricability, spheres or spheroids for low stress, cylinders for
flow pattern optimization. Stress considerations include weight, pressure, flow,
and wall temperature patterns, and must therefore result in a compromise. Possibly
the best geometrical compromise is approximately a right circular cylinder with
ellipsoidal heads.

One important design decision is the choice of relative locations of

the entry and exit passages for the fuel. They may be placed at the same end

of the reactor by making use of concentric pipes, or they may be at opposite
ends for "straight-through" flow. The former appears to be better for avoid-
ing stresses between core shell and blanket shell in a two region reactor. For

a single region reactor, the latter appears to offer fewer complications.

c. Two region reactors

Because the transmutation ratio is such an important factor in the
mills/kwh cost of electrical power, and because in two region reactors the core
shell thickness has an important influence on the transmutation ratio (since it
is a neutron absorber), it is very desirable to design for the thinnest core
shell compatible with safety against failure. It is not believed that thermal
stress will be a significant factor in determining the thickness of the core
shell b3/ in low power density homogeneous reactors. Pressure stresses will
probably determine the thickness required. These matters must, however, be
investigated when firm data on heat flows and neutron and gamma fluxes become
available. If the core and blanket fluids are kept at low pressures by appro-
priate flow passage geometries and appropriate placement of the system pumps,
the thickness of the core shell can be kept as low as 5/16 inch.

At this thickness, the highest stress under normal operating condi-
tions for the Reference Design Reactor described in Section III would be a
compressive stress of from 500 to 850 psi, depending on core shape. This is to
be compared with estimated long-time creep strengths of several thousand psi
at 1200°F. (Inconel, a weaker material than INOR-8 at these temperatures, has

a 1000-hour stress-rupture strength at 1200°F of about 14,000 psi.) Accidental

 

45/ Personal communication from H. F. Poppendiek, formerly Chief, Heat Transfer
and Physical Properties Section, ORNL
- 37 =~

core or shell drainage could produce short-time stresses of from TOO to 2000 psi,
depending on shape and condition. These stresses are to be compared with yield
strengths of the order of 30,000 psi at 1300°F. Against collapsing tendencies,
a 6-foot diameter core with a 5/16-inch thick wall has a factor of safety of
from 7 to 100; depending on whether the shape is cylindrical or spherical.

In two region reactors, it would probably be impractical to maintain
the core shell and the blanket shell at the same temperature level at all times.
Therefore, to prevent stress from differential thermel expansion of the two
shells, they must be designed to be free to expand and contract independently
of each other. This can be done by (1) employing straight-through flow with
one or more flexible connections between the two shells, or (2) by connecting
the two shells at only one end and directing the core fluid both in and out
of the same end. Since flexible connections such as bellows or diaphragms are
necessarily thin to allow flexibility, they are unavoidably subject to corrosion
or mechanical damage. It is therefore preferable to avoid using them by direct-
ing the core fluid into and out of the same end of the core, with no rigid
restraint on thermal expansion and contraction of the core shell by the blanket
shell. For thermal symmetry and resultant minimum stress concentration, the
core fluid should enter and leave the core via concentric passages. Studies
based on experience with aqueous homogeneous reactor flow tests, and considera-
tions of design of the expansion chamber, pumps, and flow passages will determine
whether the fuel should enter the core through the central tube and exit via the
annulus, or vice versa.

Blanket shells are not restricted in thickness by nuclear considera-
tions and may therefore be designed to any thickness and geometry found desirable

from stress, fluid dynamics, and support considerations. Because of the very low
- 38 -

power densities, restrictions on flow pattern can be relaxed considerably from
those required in the core. Somewhat more freedom is allowable in the use of
flow directing vanes near the outside of the blanket, where neutron flux and,
consequently, poisoning effects are low. Appropriate blanket geometry can
materially lessen shielding requirements.

Two region reactors may be supported from either top or bottom.
Since core and blanket fluid pumps will probably be above the top of the reactor,
it is anticipated that the main supports should be near the top of the reactor

to minimize both vibration stresses and problems of thermal expansion.

Lk, Other Vessels

Vessels other than the reactor will be required, including: (1)
special storage vessels from which each of the salt and liquid metal systems
will be filled and to which they will drain; (2) storage tanks in which new
and used salts and liquid metals will be stored; and (3) one or more tanks for
the boiler make-up water, which will probably be of special purity and/or
composition.

Fill-and-drain tanks - Vessels in which fused salt for the fuel cir-

 

cuit or blanket circuit will be stored must be designed for both heating and
cooling. To minimize thermal shock, they should be preheated before receiving
molten salt; and it will be desirable to maintain them at temperatures above
the melting point of the salt whenever salt is in them. It must also be possi-
ble to prevent undesirably high temperatures from rising in them from "after-
heat" generated by beta and gamma decay of fission products. Preheating and
cooling may be provided in a number of different ways as described later in

Section II-C-L.
- 39 -
Tanks for filling and draining non-radioactive salts and liquid
metal systems will require provisions for heating, but not for cooling, and
may therefore be compact (right circular cylinders).
Transfer of molten salt or metal between containers through pipes or
tubes is usually accomplished by pressurization of the vessel to be emptied with
inert gas. Pumps are almost never used for this purpose. Simple gravity drains

may also be used, of course, where appropriate.

5. Joints and Valves

Joints for containing liquid metals, molten salts, or radioactive gas
require welding or brazing for satisfactory security against leakage. For long
life in high temperature joints, no brazing material has yet been proven adequately
safe; however, basic investigation of brazing is continuing and shows some promise
for these applications. Welding has proven to be very satisfactory for both leak-
tightness and long life. The high degree of competence that has been developed
in welding and the adequacy of the welded joints of Inconel are evident in the
lack of weld failures in the ARE and in the large number of circulating molten
salt and liquid metal systems operated by ANP. Design and procedure specifica-
tions for welds are spelled out in detail in the ORNL Welding Code (ORNL Metallurgy
Division). A few vendors have already been trained in, and have met the require-
ments of the code.

For containment of radioactive gases at low temperatures, both welding
and brazing have been found to be satisfactory (zero leakage over long life). No
other methods of fabricating joints have proven to be thoroughly reliable over
long periods. Although many tests of API ring gasketed flanged joints and of
compression fitting joints such as the Swagelok have shown leak-tightness over
fairly long periods of non-cyclic operation, they are not considered to be depend-

able enough for this type of service.

 

 
 

- 40 -

Valves for handling radioactive gases in small (less than 1/2-inch)
lines do not present any unusual problems in attaining the required freedom
from leaks to or from the surrounding atmosphere. This requirement is met satis-
factorily by employing only bellows-sealed, welded or brazed connection valves.
Fully adequate valves for these small sizes for gases with limited radioactivity
are available for "off-the-shelf" purchase. Valves for controlling gases with
high beta decay activity may require redesign to reduce internal free volume,
thereby reducing the amount of heat removal required.

Flow control valves which are required only to control flow rates
without entirely stopping flow in circuits of molten salt or liquid metal are
items of semi-routine design and fabrication, except for the requirement of
extreme leak-tightness to the atmosphere. Because of the requirement for leak-
tightness, bellows-sealed, welded connection type valves are specified. Maximum
inspection and acceptance testing are required, but no particular difficulty is
encountered in meeting the specifications. Good mechanical design and the care-
ful following of the weld design and procedure code are required.

Valves for stopping flow of hot salts or liquid metals, with zero or
almost zero through-flow required, are more difficult because of the requirement
for seat materials which will neither stick nor be attacked by the fluid at high
temperatures. This problem has been essentially solved by the use of cermet
valve seats and the accurate alignment of parts, but the solution is still too
new to be regarded as fully proven for temperatures of 1200°F or higher until
the results of the additional tests now in progress are known. Stop valves
can be avoided in the hot molten salt and liquid metal circuits without serious
difficulty (for example, barometric legs or "freeze valves" can be employed in-
stead of mechanical valves in the sodium and salt drain lines). There are no

significant difficulties involved in the use of stop valves at temperatures
- 41 -

lower than about 1100°F; therefore, such valves can be freely used in low
temperature molten salt and in liquid metal drain lines.

ORNL has developed and is successfully using stop valves in molten
salt lines as large as 2-inch iron pipe size. Work toward further improvement

is continuing, with emphasis on optimizing seat materials and design.

6. Instrument and Control Components

 

Assessment of the adequacy of an existing instrument or control com-
ponent for a reactor starts from consideration of the function of the system
for which the component need be a part. Instruments are here evaluated in terms
of thelr usefulness in systems which fall into four broad categories, according
to their functions: those required for safe start-up, those vital for safe
control of the reactor once it is in operation, those needed for monitoring and
control of reactor auxiliary systems, and those installed for purposes of
evaluating performance and gathering data for experimental or test purposes.
Attention is focused here, in the main, only on sensory devices which are
needed to operate at temperatures up to 1300°F in fused salt or liquid metal
systems. These include sensory devices for the measurement of temperature,
liquid level, fluid flow, rotation speeds, neutron flux, pressure, and for

the detection of lesks.

a. Temperature sensors

For sensing of high temperatures of interest, the thermocouple is
the device upon which principal reliance has thus far been placed. Present
ANP designs include a rugged chromel-alumel thermocouple of wire size B and
S No. 8 or larger, coupled with magnetic amplifiers of reliability equal to

that of A.C. transformers. Using fabrication and installation techniques

developed in the ANP program, these thermocouples have demonstrated no

 
 

- ho o

detectable drift in a number of 3000-hour tests conducted at 1200°F. Enough
experience has been gained to justify confidence that these temperature sensing
systems will operate in the 1000°F range with a plus or minus 5°p accuracy
reliably over a 20-year period, in the absence of nuclear radiation.

The calibration stability of these instruments over extended times
in nuclear radiation fields has not been adequately tested. Consequently, at
the present state of the art, there is no assurance that thermocouples installed
in the core or blanket system would remain calibrated. Provision can be made in
reactor design for insertion of a calibrated thermocouple to recalibrate installed
thermocouples during periods when the reactor is isothermal, as, for example,
during shutdown.

Work has been done on a constant volume sodium or rubidium vapor
thermometer operating in the form of a bulb or thimble which is inserted into
the hot fluid. This device appears to be promising for measurement of the

temperatures of molten salts subject to a radiation field.

b. Iiquid level devices

 

At least two satisfactory liquid level sensors are presently avail-
able. These two have been tested for use in the ANP program. One is a resis-
tance probe for use with liquid metals, in which the resistance varies with
the level around the probe. The other is a float type X/, Difficulties in
installation of these sensors have been experienced in highly compact reactors
due to access limitation. It should be possible to avoid this problem where

space is not at a premium.

 

46/ Southern, A. L., "Closed-Trap Level Indicator for Corrosive Iiquids
Operating at High Temperatures", Instrumentation, ORNL-2093
- 43 -

These instruments have performed satisfactorily and reliably in 3000-
hour duration tests, and there was no indication that they would not perform
for a much longer period. They are not vulnerable to nuclear radiation damage.
The equipment is sound in principle and promises to be satisfactory for many

years of service.

c. Fluid flow measuring devices

 

Tests indicate the electromagnetic flow meter to be a dependable
device for measurement of high temperature liquid metal flow. Care in design,
fabrication, installation and calibration is needed, but the device is rugged
and durable and accuracy of 5 percent should be maintained.

The art of measurement of flow of molten salt at elevated temperatures
is not as well developed. Limited tests have been made on venturi and rotating
vane types with varying degrees of success. Such devices, if needed in a power
reactor, will require further testing. The ANP program has under development a
rotating vane type which shows promise of reliable operation, and is similar to
a type used successfully in the ARE. The application of venturi type flow meters

depends only on successful application of pressure sensors.

d. Pump speed indicators

 

Pump speed measuring devices or tachometers which are durable and
reliable are presently available. Access for installation on rotating machinery
has proven the only difficulty encountered in the ART project. With restricted
access, the more elaborate, but nevertheless reliable, pulse type tachometer

must sometimes be used in preference to the simpler D.C. type tachometer.

e. Nuclear sensors

Nuclear sensors in molten salt reactors pose no problems not shared

with other reactors. Existing and well tested fission, ionization, and boron

 
- bh -

trifluoride chambers are available for installation at all points essential to
the reactor. Their disadvantages of limited life can be countered only by
duplication or replacement, and provision can be made for this; however, for
circulating fuel reactors, these instruments are not essential to the routine
operation of the reactor. Nuclear sensors to withstand high temperatures are

not needed.

f. Pressure sensors and pressure controlling devices

 

There exists a variety of pressure sensors of the diaphragm or mano-
meter type which will almost certainly operate wherever needed in a reactor
system. Among these, devices are known that will operate reliably over long
periods of time in the absence of radiation; there are no tests which have
demonstrated that they will operate reliably over long times when subjected to.
radiation. There is no reason to believe that all of these pressure sensors
will fail to operate satisfactorily in a radiation field. 3

Gas pressure controllers are required in molten salt reactor systems.
Except for extended use in radioactive gas systems, adequate, well tested pres-
sure controllers are available commercially for all applications. Under strong
irradiation, valve seats or seals made of organic materials are suspect. The
requirement that the valve make a perfect seal is not essential in a design
vhich incorporates pressure relief valves; metallic seats will probably give

valves which will serve the purpose. The construction of such a valve seems

straightforward, but a long-life test under radiation conditions will be necessary.

g. leak detectors
Leaks between a fluid system and its external surroundings, or between
two fluid systems, tend to grow in size. To minimize serious damage which might

result in a reactor, simple leak detectors capable of detecting very small leaks
- 45 -

are desirable so that action may be initiated in time to limit the size of the
leak. Little progress has thus far been made in the development of leak detectors
which will reliably meet these exacting requirements. The proper approach in
design is to avoid relying on sensitive leak detectors, to design for maximum
reliability against leaks and for minimum or no damage should leaks occur. Means

of detecting larger leaks are of course available.

C. Component Systems

1. Salt and liquid Metal Charging and Storage Systems

Methods of handling molten salts and liquid metals in atomic energy
installations have been developed from methods used by manufacturers of sodium,
gasoline; and other chemically active or dangerous liquids. It has become
almost universal practice to make batch transfers by either inert gas pressuri-
zation or by gravity.

Both sodium and salts are at present purchased less pure than required.
Commercial sodium purity is such that, as a rule, only oxide removal is needed.
This is accomplished by filtering the sodium at temperatures as little above its
melting point as is convenient, and by "cold trapping" the oxide in operating
systems (precipitating the Na 0 on a cold wall at a selected point in the system).

Salt purification is also accomplished in the molten state. After the
desired proportions of salts have been mixed and melted under a protective atmos-
phere, successive purifying and purging gases (helium, HF, hydrogen) are bubbled
through the melt v/, The melt is then transferred into storage containers under

inert gas and stored either molten or frozen until needed.

 

47/  ORNL-57-54-6-126
- 46 -

The liquid salt or sodium may be charged into the preheated and pre-
cleaned systems either directly or, as is nearly always done, via fill-and-drain
tanks provided in each liquid system. The mechanics of such transfers is routine .
at ORNL, KAPL, MSA, and a number of other installations.

Treatments, transfers, and storage should, of course, be carried out
in container materials compatible with the liquid used.

A closed circuit of especially purified water, extremely low in
chlorine and oxygen content, should be used in the water-steam system 18/, by/,
One or more storage tanks should be provided for make-up water.

Considerations in locating storage or fill-and-drasin vessels are:

(1) radioactivity, and required shielding and off-gas handling facilities; (2)
accountability for a and other accountable materials; (3) convenience in
storing and handling, including ease of access, mobility, length of transfer
lines, cost of heating, etc.; (4) hazards other than radioactivity, such as

biological poison, high temperature, etc.

2. Off-Gas Handling
A major advantage of circulating fuel reactors is the ability to keep
the concentration of xenon and krypton at a low level by continuously removing

them from the fuel system 50/, Their removal greatly reduces: nuclear poisoning

of the reactor by these gases (and by their descendents which would have appeared
had the gases not been removed); the difficulties and hazards of re-starting after
shutdown; and the biological hazard of any leak or other accident which might open
the system and allow leakage of fission gases to the surrounding atmosphere.

Removal of gases can be accomplished by by-passing part of the fuel
flow through a compartment having a liquid-gaes interface, accompanied by agita-
tion of the liquid in the compartment, by bubbling helium through the liquid,
or both. There must be at least one such compartment in any liquid fuel circuit
to allow for thermal expansion of the liquid.

The gases so removed will in general be too radioactive to discharge
directly into the air, and must be "stored" until their activity has decayed
to a level acceptable for discharge into the air. Decay holdup time may be
provided by directing the gases through a large volume of appropriate geometry
(e.g, a very long pipe), or by directing them through appropriately designed
charcoal packing, in which the xenon and krypton will be held up by absorption
on the charcoal. Experiments and designs 51/ to date indicate that initial
holdup in a gas volume to allow decay of short half-life nuclides, followed
by holdup in charcoal, is the preferable method. These studies, together with
engineering analyses 22/ have spelled out the required parameter relations
and design criteria.

It may prove to be feasible to recirculate the helium instead of dis-
charging it to the atmosphere, if the gas is found in operation to be clean and
pure enough after the holdup operation. This is, however, only a future possi-

bility, as yet unproved as to feasibility.

3. Inert Gas System

The molten salts and liquid metals under consideration require com-
plete protection from contact with oxygen and water vapor. All liquid-gas
interfaces must therefore be protected by inert gas blankets. Systems of
high pressure gas storage containers; pressure-reducing valves, check valves,
flow control valves, instruments, and tubings and fittings are required to
direct the gas to the required locations at the desired pressures and flow
rates. A very considerable amount of experience in designing and operating
experiments with precisely the same requirements has been accumulated at
ORNL 25/ and BMI.

Extremely high purity 54 helium, argon and nitrogen are the most
frequently used gases for these purposes. At ANP, helium is the gas nearly
always used, primarily because it is the cheapest inert gas of the required

purity.

4. Heating and Cooling of Components

 

Since the melting points of the salts and sodium are above ambient
temperatures, it will be necessary to provide heating for all parts of the
system which will contain either sodium or salt. It will also be necessary
to provide heating for the water-steam system. Components subject to after-
heat (beta and gamma decay heat) will in general require provision for heat
removal.

Heating and cooling design should, of course, be such as to minimize

rapid transients or large gradients in temperature where high thermal stress

 

53/  ORNL-2095

54/ «10 ppm oxygen and < minus 70° dew point

would result. This restriction is common to all conventional high temperature
component design. In the few locations where beta and gamma heating may be
large enough to have significant effect on temperature gradients, it should be
taken into account.

Several methods of preheating have been used successfully, including:
(1) use of electrical strip heaters, heat tubes, ceramic-protected hot wire type
heaters, etc., in which the heaters are clamped or otherwise fastened to the
parts to be heated; (2) direct resistance heat, in which the components to be
heated are made a part of an electrical circuit; (3) gas heating; (4) induction
heating 35/, and (5) steam heating (used in England for sodium system heating).
In most high temperature salt and sodium systems at ORNL, adequate design and
fabrication for preheating using Methods (1) and (2) are now semi-routine. No
significant difficulties in preheating or maintaining temperature have been
encountered in systems in which the entire system was carefully engineered (e.g.,
the scores of large and small circulating salt and liquid metal systems success-
fully operated at ORNL in the past three or four years). The most common
difficulty has been failure to take account of local heat sinks, such as support
connections, flanges partly exposed to ambient atmosphere, etc. Good engineering
of thermal insulation is clearly required.

Cooling radioactive molten salt is not routine because a volume heat
source is involved. The use of small diameter vessels such as tubes eases the
problem because it provides a short distance for heat to go from the center of
the liquid to the cooled surface, and because it increases the surface area of

}

the vessel. When appreciable after-heat is being generated, the vessels should

- 50 -

be cooled with forced circulation, and for reliability, auxiliary power sources *
should be available for this purpose. It is desirable to design the system so

that maximum use can be made of natural air convection, and thus minimize the

time required for use of the forced circulation and cooling system. Simple

means of biological protection are also desirable. Both of the latter aims

could be implemented by use of an underground tunnel with a stack at the end

of the tunnel.

D. Nuclear Considerations

 

1. Previous Work and Early Consideration

 

Burners - Molten salt #2 burner resctors for mobile power have been
extensively investigated at Oak Ridge on the ANP program, and these studies pro-
vide the foundation for the present investigation. In 1953 a group of students
under the leadership of T. Jarvis 56/ at ORSORT investigated the applicability .
of molten salts to package reactors. More recently (1956), another ORSORT group *
led by R. W. Davies has prepared a valuable study of the feasibility of molten
salt ©» burners for central station power production 57/,

Fast Breeders - Fast reactors based on the 7? py cycle were studied
by J. N. Addoms et al of MIT 2%/ and, more recently, by yet another ORSORT group

led by J. Bulmer 39/, Both groups concluded that it would be preferable to use

molten chlorides rather than the fluorides on account of the relatively high
moderating power of the fluorine nucleus, although it was recognized that the
chlorides are probably inferior in respect to corrosion and radiation stability.
Furthermore, Bulmer pointed out that it would be necessary to use purified e137
on account of the (n,p) reaction exhibited by a>’,

In view of these disadvantages of the chloride systems, and, further,
in view of the fact that the technology of handling and utilizing Np and Pu
bearing salts is largely unknown, it was decided to postpone consideration of
fast chloride salt reactors.

Epithermal Breeders - In 1953 an ORSORT group led by D. B. Wehmeyer 6o/
analyzed many of the problems presently under study. Many of the proposals set
forth in that report have been adopted in the present program. A study by
J. K. Davidson and W. L. Robb of KAPL 61/ has been most helpful, also. Both
this and the Wehmeyer study concerned the possibility of using thorium in a
a2 conversion-breeding cycle at thermal or near thermal energies.

A consideration of molten fluoride reactors based on the Th-y>> cycle
points up the fact that Na is not available in sufficient quantity to provide
the initial charge for a breeder reactor. While conceivably the 23 required
could be made in a production reactor, the uncertainties in cost and time of
availability militate against designing a reactor to be started up with as
in the near future. It would appear that, whatever system was selected, the

initial charge would be composed of 93 percent enriched ©,

Power Production", KAPL-M-JKD-10 (1956), Confidential

 
- 52 -

It is well known that the variation of n for ©? with energy impairs *
the conversion ratio of a reactor utilizing >» and Th, and operating in the
epithermal neutron energy range. On the other hand, the low moderating power
of the fluoride salts (including IiF and BeF,) makes it impossible to design
a high performance, homogeneous converter in which, say, 90 percent of the
fissions in ro? are caused by thermal neutrons. Parasitic capture in the
fuel carrier, etc., would be excessive. It was concluded that heterogeneous
cores would be required in thermal converters or breeders to obtain breeding
ratios approaching 1.0.

None of the container materials under consideration for use with
molten fluorides would be satisfactory for the canning of moderators for a
thermal breeder reactor. The parasitic absorptions would be intolerably high.
At present, graphite is the only suitable moderator that shows promise of being
compatible with the salt, and considerable development work will be required to
establish its usefulness. Therefore, consideration of heterogeneous, thermal,
molten salt reactors has been postponed.

It was decided to investigate the nuclear properties of homogeneous,

233

epithermal, one and two region, molten salt, U converter-breeders. The in-
vestigation to date has been exploratory in nature and most of the work has been
centered on two region systems. The calculations were handicapped by a lack of
data on nuclear cross sections in the epithetial range and lack of a computational
method that would take into account inelastic scattering, resonance saturation,
and Doppler broadening. The first calculations were performed on one region

reactors by hand, using cross sections then available in the Univac program

Eyewash 62/ which was originally written for the analysis of aqueous homogeneous »

reactors. The first calculations using the computer were for simple, optimistic
cases; i.e., presence of 238 fission products, protactinium, etc., were neg-
lected, as well as the presence of 11? in the carrier. Iater, the cross sections
were revised on the basis of latest information, including the effects of
resonance saturation and Doppler broadening. The lethargy intervals were modi-
fied, and other changes were made to increase the amount of information to be
obtained from the computer (Ocusol-A program) e3/, These facts should be kept
in mind when comparisons of Univac results for the various cases are made.

The advantages of a FP burner versus breeder-converters were con-
sidered briefly. Davies et al &4/ proposed to operate the burner without
reprocessing of the irradiated fuel. Build-up of fission products and other

35

parasitic materials was to be overcome by the addition of 0? in excess of
that rzquired to replace the a consumed in the reaction. Depending on the
assumptions made regarding the cross sections of poisons in the intermediate
range, it was found that the reactor would operate from 5 to 20 years before
it would be economically advantageous to dump the spent fuel and recharge.

A study of the effects of adding fertile material to the Davies'
system disclosed that the performance would be improved by the addition of
even moderate amounts of thorium to the core. The amount of Na required to
replace ©» destroyed and to override nuclear poisons is reduced because the

1°? formed not only replaces ed but also has a higher fission cross section

and lower absorption cross section in the intermediate range. It was concluded

that conversion-breeding is desirable. It remained to be determined whether the .
ultimate power cost can be further reduced by reprocessing the spent fuel.
Some effort was expended in determining whether it is possible to
obtain a breeding ratio of 1.0 in a homogeneous reactor employing pure ©23,
Although the results are not definitive, it appears that it may barely be
possible. It seems fairly certain that a breeding ratio of 0.9 can be obtained,
and it is felt that it would be economically feasible to compensate for the

breeding deficiency by purchasing #3

at a premium price.
Since, however, ©33 is not presently available in amounts suffi-
cient to fuel a full-scale power reactor, attention has been concentrated
mainly on PP breeder-converters, in which the deficiency in production
of fissile material is compensated by the addition of ©,
It is clear that the optimum conditions will depend to a large extent
on the cross sections of ue, 3, and Th in the epithermal range. The ve? ,
cross sections are reasonably well known. In the hand calculations, and in
the first series of Eyewash calculations, an 7 of 2.28 for y= was used ’
uniformly from thermal to 0.2 mev. This was consistent with the then latest
published data of Spivak et al 65/, 66/ More recent data by Magleby et al 67/,

in this range cannot exceed 2.1. Recent KAPL data 69/ indicate that even at

ranges where data are lacking, new values of the absorption cross section of

Na were computed.

lethargies. It seems clear that reactors fueled largely with 1° will give
the best neutron economy when the majority of the fissions are caused by neutrons
in the epithermal range, where parasitic absorptions in fuel carrier and other

materials are relatively less important.

The average energy of neutrons causing fission can be increased by

33

increasing the a concentration, which increases the probability for a neu-
tron to cause fission before it gets slowed down very much. The resulting
increase in reactivity can be compensated for by adding thorium to the core

or by using smaller cores. The improvement in breeding ratio must be baia.ced

against increased inventory charges.

2. One Region Reactors

The critical mass of a bare reactor passes through a minimum with
increasing diameter at the point where the effect of diminished leakage on
critical concentration is just compensated by the volume increase. The minimum
inventory for the entire system occurs at a somewhat larger diameter which
depends on the ratio of total fuel volume to core volume. By means of preliminary
hand calculations, a reactor having a diameter of 10 feet was selected as provid-
ing a reasonable compromise between the demands for low inventory and reasonable
size. The power density in the four cases studied was set nominally at 100 w/ce
of core volume. The results are summarized in Table VIII, and discussed in
detail by Carrison and Alexander 1/,

Pure eo was used and neutron losses to fission fragments, protactinium,
uranium isotopes, and 14% were ignored. Further, the optimistic ° cross sec-
tions of the Eyewash program were used. Thus the results are only qualitative.
However, it does not seem probable that a breeding ratio of 1.0 can be obtained
in a practical, bare, one region system. On the basis of the relative cross
sections and from the comparison of certain two region reactors discussed below,

it is estimated that if © were substituted for Fd in these reactors, the
critical masses would be increased by a factor of 2 or 5 and the conversion
ratios would decrease markedly for a given thorium concentration.
The use of reflectors should improve the performance of the one region -

reactors somewhat, particularly in smaller sizes. This matter has sot been explored
- 59 -
fully because it was felt that a reflector containing fertile material (a
blanket) would in every case give better neutron economy for a given fuel
inventory than a non-fertile reflector.

As expected the mean energy of the neutrons causing fission (vottom
line, Table VIII) increased sharply with thorium loading, and a reasonably
fast spectrum (10* ev) was obtained in Case Sk. This hard spectrum was obtained,
however, at the cost of a very large critical mass of 233, The critical masses
of RL or Pu would be even larger. However, these results do offer some hope

that a truly fast, homogeneous, molten fluoride reactor based on the plutonium

cycle can be achieved.

3. Two Region Reactors

Emphasis has been placed on the study of two region rather than o:e
region reactors for several reasons. First, higher specific powers, and thus
lower inventory costs at a given breeding ratio, can be obtained with smaller
reactors. Second, in single region reactors there is no convenient way of
separating the a or protactinium from the >» and 20, Third, at power
densities of 250 w/cc or below, all the power that can be utilized by one
turbogenerator can be obtained from 4 to 6-foot cores. To save neutrons, one
places a blanket of fertile material around the core.

Preliminary calculations were performed by means of the Eyewash pro-
gram using the nuclear cross sections then available on the Eyewash "sigma"
tape. It was felt that the calculations would at least disclose the area where
the most favorable combination of specifications would likely be found.

Spherical reactors having core-diameters of 4, 5 and 6 feet were
studied. The basic fuel carrier was a mixture of IiF and BeF,, with zero (four

cases) and 4 mole percent ThF) . The blanket (28 inches thick) consisted of the

 
- 60 -

compound Ii_ThF and the core vessel was 1/3-inch of INOR-8. The core and

37
lanket densities were computed for a temperature of 1200°F, but the nearest
thermal neutron temperature available in the Eyewash program was 1280°F.

Cases 21, 22 and 23 of Table IX comprise a series in which the effect
of varying the core radius on conversion ratio and critical mass was investigated
for reactors employing y=? as fuel and having thorium in the blanket only. The
conversion ratios (line 17) are of the order of 0.6 and are relatively insensi-
tive to changes in core size. The critical mass (line 14) increases sharply
with decreasing core diameter in the range of 6 tok feet, as does the mean
energy of the neutrons causing fission (line 35). This hardening of the spec-
trum results in a decrease in parasitic absorptions in Ii, Be and F (lines 28
and 29) from about 0.15 to 0.08 neutrons, and a decrease in the absorptions in
the core vessel (line 31) from 0.08 to 0.03 neutrons. However, this decrease

235

is offset in great part by an increase in the parasitic captures in U from
0.10 to 0.16, i.e., the mean value of 7 (line 34) decreased from2.00 to 1.80
(n at 0.08 ev = 2.08).

253

In the Eyewash program, n of U is taken uniformly as 2.28 (v = 2.52)

in the energy range from 0.025 ev to 0.18 mev. The result of using this 7 is

233

shown in Case 25, which is similar to Case 23, except that the fuel is U and
the Ni-Mo core vessel is 1 inch instead of 1/3-inch thick. The breeding ratio
(line 16) is only 0.530; however, it is observed that the absorptions in the

core vessel amounted to 0.206 neutrons. For a comparison with Case 22, the
excess absorption (0.206 - 0.056 = 0.150) was prorated among the blanket com-
ponents, and a breeding ratio of 0.78 was estimated for a 1/3-inch core vessel
thickness on the basis of the increased absorptions in the thorium. The critical

233

mass for Case 25 was gratifying low, amounting to only ~ 13 kg of U .
- fl -

The principal avoidable losses of neutrons in Case 23 were those due
to absorptions in fuel carrier and core vessel, the sum amounting to about 0.15
neutrons. It was conjectured that these losses could be decreased by adding
thorium to the core. Case 26 shows the result of adding ~J4 mole percent ThF)
to the core of the reactor of Cage 22. The thermal flux was entirely suppressed
(1ine 36). There was a substantial increase in the absorptions in thorium, over
half of these taking place in the core, and a corresponding increase in the con-
version ratio (line 16). Absorptions in carrier salt were substantially reduced
and the absorptions in the core vessel were sharply reduced from 0.06 tos 0.01
neutrons. This last effect was due in part to the increased transparency of the
core vessel at higher neutron energies, and in part to the fact that fewer neu-
trons leaked from the core in Case 26 (0.210 neutrons vs. 0.385 in Case 22).

It was noticed that n (line 34) for Case 26 was slightly greater than for Case 23.

even though the mean energy of the neutrons causing fissions was higher in Case 26.

This circumstance results from the fact that n for #2 passes through a minimum
with increasing neutron energy.

There are a number of small discrepancies between Cases 22 and 26 which
resulted from the premature termination of the calculation in Case 26 and a print-
out for a subcritical condition. This shows up principally in the neutrons
absorbed in fission reactions (line 24), where the absorptions in Case 26 corre-
spond to a v of 2.56. The breeding ratios and the critical masses for all cases
were corrected by linear extrapolations for these departures from criticality,
but the neutron balances were not corrected.

Case 27 shows the advantage of using thorium in the core with ye? as
the fuel, provided the capture cross sections of 233 in the epithermal range
are as low as those used in the Eyewash program. Parasitic absorptions are re-

duced to a very low value and the breeding ratio (line 16) is quite favorable;

however, no account was taken of fission product poisoning or captures in Pa,
uranium isotopes, 118, etc. Thus refinements in the calculations can be
expected only to reduce the estimate of the breeding ratio.

Compared to Case 25, Case 27 exhibits a rather large increase in
critical mass. The optimum concentration of thorium in the core can only be
determined by an analysis of the sum of fuel costs and inventory charges as a
function of thorium concentration.

Detailed neutron balances for Cases 22, 26 and 27 are shown i:
Tebles X, XI, and XII. The thermal and epithermal absorptions in the various
components of the core and the blanket and absorptions in the core vesscl are
given.

From an examination of the flux plots, it was estimated that a blanket
only 12 inches thick would have captured substantially all of the neutrons leak-
ing from the core vessel.

The results listed in Table IX are, of course, quite optimistic and
are of the nature of an upper limit on performance. Use of corrected cross
sections and inclusion of the various poisons is expected to reduce the trans-
mutation ratios sharply and to increase the critical masses substantially.
However, it is felt that these systems show promise of being able to produce
pover at an attractively low cost, mainly through reduction of fuel costs, and
it was decided to refine the calculations and to extend the investigation.
Accordingly, new and additional cross sections were computed and the program

itself was modified in several respects 7y/ and renamed Ocusol-A.

Five reactor cases have been computed by the Ocusol-A program to date.
The results have not been completely analyzed; however, the critical loadings,
breeding ratios, and simplified neutron balances are given in Table XIII.

These reactors have cores 6 feet in diameter. For a total power of

600 Mw, the required average power density in the core is 187 w/ee. The tempera -~

ThE, as before; and the core

vessel is 1/3-inch of Ni-Mo alloy. The core fluid consists of 69 mole percent

ture is 1150°F. The blanket is composed of Ii

Ii1F and 31 mole percent BeF., together with additions of ThF), and UF), as

27
indicated. The lithium contains 0.01 percent 11°. The thorium cross sections

were modified appropriately to account for saturation of the resonances and

Doppler broadening. The a was assumed to be contaminated with 7 mole per-
cent 228,

 

 
- 66 -

Case 38 has a thorium concentration in the core of 1.0 mole percent
and is fueled with 2, Token amounts (10 ppm) of rv? and fission fragments
were added in order to determine the mean effective cross sections of these
materials in the neutron energy spectrum pertinent to each case. The critical
mass was found to be 273 kg of ©, and for an assumed ratio of total fuel
volume to core volume of L4, the inventory would be 1100 kg. The conversion
ratio is 0.610. The effects of build-up of fission fragments, 3H #2,
and aa on this reactor have not been investigated. This reactor is reason-
ably attractive, but the inventory is large.

A reactor having a critical mass of 125 kg of 2b (500 kg inventory)
was then selected for study. The clean reactor (Case LL) was found to be critical
at a concentration of thorium in the core of 0.284 mole percent. The conversion
ratio was 0.614. This improvement, in the face of decreased thorium loading, was
surprising, and was ascribed to the fact that the second reactor was appreciably
more thermal than the first and, consequently, profited from an improvement in
the mean n for ©, By including token amounts of fission products and #33,
data were obtained from which the rate of build-up of 233, 3H >, fission
fragments, and protactinium could be estimated. The concentrations of various
poisons corresponding to about 2L0 days of operation at 600 Mw (30 percent fission
burn-up of original charge of 500 kg =?) were computed, and the thorium con-
centration required for criticality was determined (Case 48), Tt was found
necessary to remove nearly all the thorium from the core to maintain criticality;
the transmutation ratio decreased to 0.567. Note that in this period nearly 6 kg
of v3 accumulated in the core, while about 50 kg was produced in the blanket
(some present as Pa). The v3 in the blanket system was not considered to con-

tribute to the reactivity of the core.

 

 
- 67 -

Since it would have been necessary to remove nearly all of the thorium
from the core during the first 240 days of operation, it was clear that the build-
up of #33 had been overestimated. On the other hand, there was still some ©?
available from the decay of Pa present in the core. In order to avoid repeating
the calculation, it was assumed that the decay of the Pa would approximately com-
pensate in the next 240 days of operation for the overestimate of the £3 made
for the first 240 days. All thorium was removed from the core and the 6 kg of
©? was allowed to burn out. The concentrations of fission fragments, ©,
etc., corresponding to another 240 days of operation, were computed, and the
critical mass of a was found to be 154 kg (Case 50). The breeding ratio
decreased to 0.480, and about 100 kg of Pa and © had accumulated in the
blanket system.

At some as yet undetermined point, it would become profitable to begin
processing the blanket for the recovery of £2? and the core for the removal of
fission fragments. The processing cycle chosen consists of recovering the uranium
isotopes by the fluoride volatility process and, in the case of the core fluid,
throwing away the contaminated salt. The steady state concentrations of the
various materials corresponding to a processing rate of 600 £t yr (compared to
a total fuel volume of about L450 re) were estimated. The system was then tested
for eriticality. On the basis of the results, the estimates were corrected; the
results are listed under Case 49 in Table XIII. The transmutation ratio for this
case was found to be 0.56. The Na feed rate is approximately 0.5 g/Mw-day of
heat produced.

The concentration of fission fragments in the fuel will, of course,
vary with the rate of processing the core. The transmutation ratio will vary

correspondingly, and the critical loading will change. The conversion ratio can

are discussed in Section II-G.

These reactors appear to be reasonably attractive. It is planned
2 to perform a parametric study of the effect of variation of core diameter and
thorium loading on the transmutation ratio. Initial, transient, and steady
state performance will be investigated. These studies will form the basis for
8 detailed, parametric study of the economics of power production in reactors

of this type.

4. Reactivity Effects in Typical Reactor

 

Reactor Case Uh of Table XIII was selected for a study of reactivity
effects of changes in temperature, fuel concentration, and thorium concentration.
In the Ocusol-A program, it was possible to change the thermal neutron tempera-
ture and to change the atom densities of the materials in the — but it was
not possible - short of modifying the program - to make changes that would
. reflect the effect of the shift in the thermodynamic temperature on the Doppler
broadening of the resonances in the various cross sections. The contribution
of the change in thermal neutron temperature was found to be -0.3 x 1072 /°F,
and the change in salt density, (1/k)(0 k/Jp)(dp/dT), was found to contribute
-6.x 107° /°F.
The reactivity effects of adding >» and Th were evaluated independ-
ently: (> /x) (2d k/0 2) = 0.4585 and (x°2/x) (2 k/9 1°?) = -0.116. It follows

that the ratio of the I addition required for criticality to the thorium

 

addition, d N°2/3 N°2, 1s 0.26, or one must add one atom of U2? for every b
atoms of Th added.
The reactivities determined for the U-° and Th were used to break
the term (1/k)(2k/3p)(dp/dT) into its component parts, thus:
(1/5) (3/30) (d0/aT) = (1/K)(3%/IN7) (a2 /ar) + (1/6) (2%/ IW)
: (ar°2/aT) + (1/%)(2 k/ ¥°)(an®/ar)
- 70 -

where N° represents the atom density of the salt carrier. The left-hand
member is -6.3 Xx 107, as mentioned above. The first two terms on the right

are, -5.4 x 1072 and +1.h x 1077, respectively. Thus, by difference,
(1/k)(2 k/ 2 N°) (an®/dt) = -2.3 x 107°/°F

This reactivity effect associated with the carrier is due to an increase in
fast leakage as the density of the salt decreases. On the other hand, it was
found, by averaging the macroscopic transport cross sections over the flux
spectrum, that changes in £5 concentration had little effect on the leakage,
and that the reactivity effect of changes in Ne was due almost entirely to

. changes in the macroscopic fission cross section.

These preliminary results seem reasonable, and indicate that control-

wise the reactors under consideration are well-behaved and can undoubtedly be

controlled entirely by changes in heat load and adjustment of the a concentration.

E. Reactor Operation, Control and Safety

 

The master-slave relationship which exists between power demend and
power production in a circulating fuel reactor has been demonstrated conclusively
in both the HRE and the ARE. Once the reactor is adjusted to produce power at
the design point; load adjustment to meet fluctuations in power demand is achieved
automatically without actuation of control rods or control equipment of any kind.
Rupture in the reactor cooling system or malfunctioning of any of its components
leading to increased temperature in the reactor core, automatically reduces the
nuclear reactivity to a subcritical value. The master-slave feature makes possi-
ble, in a practical reactor design, complete elimination of control rods and all
attendant equipment and instrumentation for imposing direct and prompt control

of nuclear reactivity. Reliability, safety, and great simplification of design
 

 

- 71 -

is achieved. Instrumentation and control equipment is assigned a secondary
role: to function in start-up; to monitor and adjust fuel make-up to main-
tain design point power; and to monitor and indicate performance of auxiliary
equipment for operational or experimental purposes. This section focuses
principally on the stability characteristics of molten salt reactors, and the

controls and indicators necessary for start-up and adjustment of power level.

l. The Control Problem of Nuclear Power Reactors 72/

 

For nuclear power reactors, control and safety problems are directly
related to the control of temperatures and the possible rapid variations there-
of. Temperature excursions can be induced by a number of events. Basically,
they occur whenever the power generated is not in balance with the power removed.
This relationship is expressed by the following equation giving the time rate
of change of the temperature:

aT, = E(P - P,) (1) t
at

 

12/ The kinetics of circulating fuel reactors have been studied and reported
in a number of papers. Among them are: "Current Status of the Theory
of Reactor Dynamics", W. K. Ergen, ORNL-53-7-137 (1953); "Kinetics of the
Circulating Fuel Nuclear Reactor”, W. K. Ergen, Phys. Rev. 25, 702 (June
1954); "Stability of Solutions of the Reactor Equations”, John A. Nohel,

and A. M. Weinberg, Physics XX, %13 (1954); "A Theorem on Rearrangements
and Its Application to Certain Delay Differential Equations", F. H. Brownell
and W. K. Ergen, Journal of Rational Mech. and Analysis, 3, 565 (195k)
-72 -

Tn is the mean core temperature, E is the reciprocal of the heat capacity,
P is the power generated, and P, is the power removed.

During operation of a reactor, the balance of power can be upset either
by an excursion in the power generated or by a change in power removed, or
both. Variation in generation may come about by misoperation or failure of
a component either in the reactor itself or in the control equipment, if there
is any. Change in power demand can occur from two distinct causes: by changes
in the electric load or by a breakdown of the heat transfer system between the
reactor core and the load. Removal of the electric load as well as pump failure
or rupture in the fluid heat transfer system results in stopped, or reduced,
heat flow. Should any of these breakdowns occur, prompt and reliable control
schemes must be provided in the reactor design unless, as in the molten salt
reactor, there is inherent fundamental protection against these dangers. Pro-
vision must be made for the removal of after-heat when there is no load. Strictly
speaking, this is not, however, a reactor control problem.

To see the full consequences of an unbalance between the power generated
and the power removed, one must consider the relationship between the rate of
change of pover generated, the temperature coefficient of reactivity «a, and the

mean core temperature Toe It is,

d (np) =- 2
2 (ap) aT, (2)

where T is the mean neutron generation time of both prompt and delayed
neutrons. For a given concentration of fuel and poison, the reactor is critical
at only one value of Tho vhich is taken as the zero of the temperature scale.
Molten salt circulating fuel reactors have large and promptly acting
negative temperature coefficients of reactivity, and according to Equations (1)

and (2), this feature provides great stability for the mean core fuel temperature.
- 73 -

For example, when the reactor is at full power, a stoppage of the power removal,
accomplished either by loss of electrical load or by failure of the heat trans-
fer system, will have little effect despite the sharp rate of rise of temperature
predicted by Equation (1), for even a slight rise in temperature will shut off
the power generation, as indicated in Equation (2). A partial loss of power
load does not cause more than a temporary perturbation in the mean core temperature.

The only possible difficulty of automatic control of temperature per-
turbation occurs at low power levels. For extremely low power densities such
as one finds during start-up of the reactor, these temperature perturbations
can be large. This comes about because any increase in load appears in the
reactor as a decrease in the fuel temperature. Since the power level is so
low, this decrease in fuel temperature increases the reactivity without at
first raising the temperature appreciably. Consequently, the reactor may go
on a shcrter and shorter period until the power rises sufficiently to heat up
the fuel and cancel out the excess reactivity which was introduced by cooling
the fuel initially. The reactor power level at which the fuel temperature rise
cancels the excess reactivity will then be considerably higher than the load.
The mean temperature could then continue to rise and overshoot the steady state
by a wide margin.

In a molten salt circulating fuel reactor, one can expect temperature
stability without significant overshoot even at low power densities. A typical
value for a is 5 x 107° Ak/k/°F. Based on electronic simulator methods which

accurately predicted the ARE performance, E. R. Mann 3/ has determined for the

- Th -

heat transfer circuit, sketched in Figure 2, that a power density of 4 watts
per cubic centimeter is an adequately low limit, above which the reactor will
be stable against significant temperature overshoot. This means, for example,
that the reference design reactor with a temperature coefficient of reactivity
of -5 x 1072 /°F and starting with a power density as low as 4 watts per cubic
centimeter can take up load increases at a rate equivalent to placing the
reactor on a 1l0-second period without any appreciable perturbation of the mean
fuel temperature. For a design point of 187 w/ce, a reactor of this design can
therefore be brought from a power output of about 13 megawatts to 600 megawatts
in 4% seconds without serious perturbation in the mean fuel temperature by
merely increasing the load demand on the reactor. Thus the reactor will re-
spond completely, safely, and automatically to changes in load demand above

13 megawatts without significant changes in mean core temperature and without
control equipment of any kind. Of course, this automatic reactivity control
occurs as a result of density changes in the core, so that an expansion chamber
must be provided, and the passageways to it must be large enough to allow for
expansion without pressure shock in the core.

At power levels of less than 4 w/ee, the only danger that can arise
is that of suddenly injecting into the core fuel which is too cold. In normal
operation, this would not occur since the start-up times for turbogenerators
far exceed limits below which power increases in the core are not safe. One
unusual event that could cause trouble without proper safety precaution is that
of stopping momentarily the fuel pumps in all of the circulating fuel circuits,
cooling the fuel to a lower than normal temperature, and then restarting all
pumps simultaneously. During stoppage, the reactor core would become isothermal

above its critical temperature and the reactivity would drop to a low value.

The sudden insertion of cold fuel could then lead to the difficulty previously
described. Accidents of this kind can be prevented by suitable interlocks. A
more thorough investigation of such unlikely contingencies will be made, but
no difficulties that can not be handled by proper design are anticipated.

An increased load on the reactor system is met by an increased AT
across the core and heat exchangers, with the mean temperature of the core
remaining the same. Simulator studies demonstrate that even with sudden
failure of coupling, such as might conceivably occur in one or more of the
multiple heat transfer systems, the transients of inlet and outlet tempera-
tures occur smoothly and in intervals of time which preclude thermal or

pressure shocks.

2. Fueling

As fuel is depleted and fission product poisoning builds up, the
mean core temperature at which the reactor is critical sinks lower and lower.
At constant power load, this depression of temperature is reflected at all
points in the heat exchange system and, in particular, the sodium return tem-
perature from the boiler is depressed. This temperature must be kept above a
minimum set by the requirement that the sodium return temperature should be
maintained above the melting point of the salts in the salt-to-sodium heat
exchangers. This is done by increasing the concentration of fuel in the core
as needed.

The relation which gives the mass, AM, of fissionable material to be
added to the reactor for a given increase in the steady state mean core tempera-

ture, AT > is given by the expression,

M=aB M AT
where, B= SM, Ak
M/k
- 77 -

Here « is the temperature coefficient of reactivity, k is the effective multi-
plication constant, and M, is the criticel mass. For epithermal reactors,
the ratio B ranges from two to six, usually greater than four, and it can be
obtained from criticality experiments or by couputation. The graph, Figure 3,
shows the reduction in sodium return temperature during the course of time
resulting from burn-up when the constant power reneration is 200 w/cc. For
example, 1 the fuel inventory is 1000 pounds or gy and B is four, and if

the sodium return temperature can be allowed to dror 50°F, then the reactor

must be refueled at intervals no greater than every nine and one-half days. Whe:
it is so fuszled, the amount of ©? that is added is 10 pounds.

The mean core temperature will rise with addition of fuel. The chance
for conceivably dangerous temperature transients due tn too rapid feed can be
<liminated completely by adopting a design which limits the rate of feed. For
example, the rate of feed can be limited by designing refueling equipment to
inject fuel salt in properly sized pellet form only at safe minimum intervals
of time. The pellets would be held under the top surface of the fuel in a
heavy mesh wire screen until dissolved. The slugging >7fect, caused by tempo-
rary inhomogeneity of the concentration of fuel in the circulating salt, is

reduced by feeding fuel in solid form due to the time required for complete

melting of pellets.

3. Criticality Start-up

 

Before adding fuel to the reactor core system, the core, blanket and
all of the fluid heat transfer systems will have been heated to temperature,
checked for gas leaks, filled with their respective fluids, all liquid systems
checked for full operation, and the systems again checked for leaks. With no

heat generation in the reactor and the pumps running, the whole system will be

isothermal and the temperature can then be controlled in a sensitive way by
steam supplied to, or removed from, the boiler. With the reactor in this
condition, it can be brought to criticality by the safe procedure outlined
below. Nuclear instrumentation will be required for this initial fueling
operation.

With no fuel in the reactor, the counting rate from neutrons origina-
ting in the source is accurately determined and its reciprocal value is used
later in the familiar reciprocal counting rate versus fuel mass plot. With
fuel pumps operating, concentrated fuel salt is added until the fuel load
reaches 80 to 90 percent of the value which makes the reactor critical, as
previously determined from hot criticality experiments. Then a neutron count
rate is measured, after which carefully limited amounts of concentrated fuel
salt are added step-wise with intervening counting and plotting of points.

When the reactor is near critical, as determine: from the plot, the reactor

core temperature is slowly lowered until the neutron counter indicates eriti-
callity, at which point the temperature of criticality is determined. The cooler
is turned off, the temperature of the core rises to design point, and the adding-
fuel, counting, determining-criticality-temperature cycle is repeated until
criticality at core design point temperature is reached. Experience from the

ARE has demonstrated that a well planned and deliberately executed procedure

such as this is a simple, safe, and reliable one for achieving criticality in
the reactor.

Reactor constants, important for future fueling and other operations,

can be determined from date recorded in the reactor start-up log.

F. Build-up of Nuclear Poisons and Chemical Processing :

 

1. Fission Product Poisoning

 

A 600 Mw reactor will produce about 190 kg/yr of fission products.
About 23 atom percent of the fission fragments have a decay chain such that
they appear as an inert gas - Xe or Kr - with a half-life greater than one
hour and thus are subject to removal by purging with He or N, ges. These re-~
movable isotopes contribute about 25 percent of the total fission product
poisoning in the 100 ev resonance region. This percentage is higher in a
thermal) reactor because of the very large thermal neutron cross section of

a
et? but burn-out limits the xelD?

poisoning tc a maximum of about 5 percent.
I» the resonance region, however, adjoining nuclei do not have great differ-
ences 1.. cross section, and burn-out is relatively ineffective in limiting
poison. Thus, to a first approximation, poisoning increases almost linearly
with time if fission products are not removed.

About 26 atom percent of the fission products are rare earths. In
a 100 ev resonance reactor, they contribute about 40 percent of the fission pro-
duet poisoning. The remaining non-rare-gas and non-rare-earth fission products
include a wide variety of elements, no one of which is outstanding from the
poisoning point of view.

In a thermal yo? burner reactor operated at constant power and at

constant =? inventory, but with no fission product removal, the fission pro-

a,th/ “a th’

poiscaing (0-5%) plus equilibrium Sm’

duet poisoning, IT is approximately equal to the equilibrium Xe

ko poisoning ( ~~ 1.2%) plus the contribu-

tion from "all other fission products”. According to Blomeke and Todd La

 

T4/ ~~ ORNL-2127

 

 
- 81 -

the "all other fission product” poisoning totals about 3 percent when the total
amount of a burned is equal to the a inventory (100% burn-up), increases

to about 19 percent at 1000 percent burn-up, and to about 51 percent at 10,000
percent burn-up. Thus it is possible, although not necessarily economical, to

run a thermal, fluid fuel reactor for many years without being forced to vrocess
to remove fission product poisons. One would, of course, pay for not processing
by higher inventory charges for 2» and by lower breeding-conversion rations. A
600 Mw thermal reactor burns about 230 kg naz per year, so that with 460 k-. 17°02
inventory, the fission product poisoning would increase from 0-5 percent initially
to 20-25 percent after 20 years.

Even in thermal reactors, resonance captures in fission products make
the poisoning somewhat worse than the numbers given above. The magnitude of
the extra poisoning depends on the ratio of the neutron flux at resonance energle-;
to the thermal neutron flux, which is determined in part by the effectiveness of
the moderator. In resonance reactors, the fission product poisoning is consider -
ably worse due to the higher average fission product absorption cross sections
relative to 2, In a 100 ev reactor with a 530 kg 12>? inventory, the total
fission product poisoning 5/ would increase approximately linearly from zero
percent initially to ~ 48 percent after 2 years at 600 Mw.

For 2 fueled reactors, the fission product poisoning is about the
same as for o>» at thermal neutron energles, but in the resonance region, the
higher 23 cross section reduces the poisoning effect of the fission products
by a factor of two over >, Thus a resonance breeder-converter burning half-
and-half 2 and a would have a fission product poison level of ~s9 percent

if processed twice per 100 percent burn-up.

2. Pa and Np Poisoning

233

» Np

Neutron capture in Pa or ad has the same result as a non-fission

239

capture in #23 or Pu ”’’, i.e.,, a fissionable atom is effectively lost as well

237

as a neutron. Although neutron loss to Np does not involve loss of a fission-
able atom, the total poison can be worse when a is used as make-up fuel.
Although neutron capture by any of the three yields a fertile atom, at present
relative prices for fertile and fissionable materials, the gain is negligible
compared to the loss.

233

The average ratio of neutron captures to B-decays by Pa in a reactor

is given to a good approximation by,

 

0.046 P (1 + Q) B.R. 5
MB [5
a
where, P = reactor power level, thermal Mw
(1 + @) = ratio of absorptions to “issions in fuel
B.R. = breeding or conversion ratio
MP = kg of thorium in system

The P and a refer to the whole system. The other parameters can refer

either to the whole system or to the core and blanket separately. In molten
233

salt power reactor studies to date, neutron captures in Pa have been negli-

gible, due primarily to the large thorium inventories considered.

In a P3_yP35 breeder-converter using highly enriched a make-up,

239

Np poisoning is relatively unimportant, but if the breeding-conversion ratio

231 poisoning can become objectionably high if it is allowed to

is poor, Np
reach its equilibrium value with no removal by chemical processing. This is
especially true in resonance reactors, in which 236 (and hence add at
equilibrium) yields may be twice as high as in thermal reactors. Chemical

processing to remove Np is discussed in a following section.
- 83 -

3. Corrosion Product Poisoning

Corrosion product concentrations in molten fluoride salts in INOR-8
loops at 1500°F have not been observed to exceed 100-300 ppm for Fe, Cr and
Al, or 100 ppm for Ni, Mo and other alloy constituents (with ~ 20 ppm being
typical for Ni and Mo). At lower temperatures, these numbers are smaller, but
precise values at 1100-1200°F are not yet available. These corrosion products
will be removed from the core system, along with the fission products, by the
chemical processing system. They will build up to =quilibrium in the blanket
system (where they are relatively less objectionable than in the core since
blanket poisons have to compete with such a very high concentration of thorium).

The Fe, Cr, Ni and Al are relatively light elements and thus should
have lower capture cross sections than typical fission products. Molybdenum
is typical of the lighter group of fission products (about 18 percent of
fissione eventually yield a stable Mo isotope). Since the chemical process.
ing will probably be at such a rate that the steady state fission product
concentration in core salt will be several thousand ppm, the corrosion product

poisoning Las been neglected.

4. Chemical Processing and Fuel Reconstitution
The "ideal" reactor chemical processing scheme would remove ©3ssion

59 as soon as they were formed. After

products, corrosion products, p33 and p=
the latter two had decayed to #33 and Pus? it would then return them “o the
reactor, along with the U and Pu passing through the process, in the deeired form.
This ideal chemical plant would have low capital and operating costs, would hold
up only small amounts of fissionable and other high-priced materials, and would
discharge its waste streams in forms that could be inexpensively disposed of or

sold for a profit. Present technology, however, does not offer such an ideal

process for any reactor.

 
- 8h -

More practical short-term goals for processing a molten salt reactor
might be (a) continuous removal of most of the gaseous fission products by purg-
ing with He or N, gas, (v) an "in-line" removal of rare earth, noble metal or
other fission products by "freezing out" of part of the salt stream, "plating
out" of fission products on metallic surface either naturally or electrolyti-
cally, "salting out", e.g., of rare earths by keeping the salt saturated with
Ce, or "slagging out" of a solid carrier phase by adding oxygen or oxides, and
(e) continuous or batch removal of salt fuel from the reactor at an economically
optimum rate to separate the U, Pu and salt from the remaining fission products
and corrosion products by the least expensive method available. Present tech-
nology does not offer all of this for a molten salt reactor which has to be
designed now, although there is reason to expect that an adequate development
program would enable it to be approached more closely in the "second reactor"
design. Operation of the ARE and of ANP in-pile loops indicates that gaseous
fission product removal can be achieved and that Ru, Rh, and Pd plate out on
metal surfaces. The fluoride volatility process achieves one of the most impor-
tant goals in separating U from salt and fission products. Scouting experiments
in ORNL Chemistry and Chemical Technology laboratories have indicated a basis
for optimism that further development will yield methods of separating salt from
fission products. Adequate technology already exists for the preparation of
fresh fuel starting with non-radioactive UF and fluoride salts, but further
development is required to demonstrate "hot" (and hence remotely operated)
reconstitution of fuel from recycled uranium (and salt if possible) if long
cooling times are to be avoided.

Fluoride Volatility Process ~ Processes for the decontamination of
uranium by fluorination to produce volatile UF, are under active development

at the Argonne and Oak Ridge National laboratories. Both sites have studied

 
- 85 -

the dissolution of solid fuel elements (e.g., STR) in molten fluoride salts
as a preparatory step for fluorination, end ORNL has also studied the fluori-
nation of molten salt reactor (ARE and ART) fuels as well. The ANL process
fluorinates with BrF_, and distills the UF, product to complete the decontami-

3

nation. The ORNL process fluorimates with F. and completes the UF decontami -

2
nation with a sorption-desorpti«: cycie on a NaF pellet bed.

The OR: volatility -rosrasn is currently running at approximately a
$1,000,000-a-year level and is a* an sarly pilot plant stage. The pilot plant
is now being broken in with nor-radioactive feed. This cold stage will be
followed by processing of warm (long-cooled) ARE fuel and then hot STR (10-30
day cocled) fuel, over fiscal 1958 and fiscal 1959 according to present plans.
The chemistry of the process has been described by Cathers 18/, and the pilot
plant by Milford /, Figure 4 is a biock flow sheet of the procsss. For pro-
cessing ARE type fuel, the uranium bearing molten salt is transferred to the
fluorinator in 1.4 ft

5 batches. Fluorine, diluted with N,, is bubbled through

2
the salt at 600-650°C until its U content is ~ 0 ppm, and UFg, N, and excess
F, pass ou% of the fluorinator through a 100°¢c NaF pellet bed (capacity of
10 kg U) which removes the UF, from the gas stream. At present, the excess

F., is scrubbed out of the gas stream wit: a reducing KOH solution. In vola-

2
tility laboratory studies, Fy recirculation with a K-25 B-U4 pump has been

used and may be installed later in the pilo® plant, thus reducing Fy, consump-
tion and simplifying the disposal problem. The UFg is desorbed from the NaF

by raising the temperature to 400°C and sweeping with Fy-N,. The UF passes

The plant product is liquid UFg, ot;tained by isolating the cold traps from the
rest of the system, heating to above the triple point and draining into the
product receiver.

Most of the decontamination is achieved in the fluorination since mcs®
of the fission and corrosion products remain in the salt. The volatile contami-
nants (%s, Kr, I, Te, and Mo, most of the Ru, 2nd part of the Nb and Zr) ei“her
pass through the NaF bed vhile the UF, is retained (Xe, nr, I, Te, Mo, Ru) or
remain on the bed when the UFg 1s desorbed (Nt, Zr). The I, Te, Mo, and Ru
are mostly removed by a :cid trap, the remainder being scrubbed out of the gas
system aiocng with the Fe The Xe and Kr follow the N, to the plant off-gas
system. The Nb and Zr slowly build up on the NaF bed, which is replaced when
poisoned. laboratory develnpment indicates tha® a 100°¢ micrometallic nickel
filter betws=en fluorinator and NaF bed removes most of the Nb and Zr, and this,
too, may be added to the pilot plant. This addition would greatly extend the
life of the NaF bed.

According to ORNL =xperience, only part of the Pu follows the U. The
behavior of Np and Pa has not been ztudied. A molten salt power reactor develop-
ment program should include studies of these three elements. Volatility processing
of IiF-BeF, and NaF-BeF,, salts has not been demonstrated, since the present process
is based on NaF-ZrF) salts, but no difficulties are expected. In fact, the Ii salt
complexes UF), -UF;-UFy less strongly than Na salts and hence should require less
excess F,..

2
Reduction of UFg to UF), - The continuous reduction of highly enriched

 

UFg to UF, with hydrogen is well proved as a non-radioactive process. The process
- 88 -
developed and used at K-25 18/ is indicated in Figure 5. The reduction takes $
place in a UF -Fy-H, flame in a Y-shaped tower reactor. The Fy is added to
give a hotter flame. The reaction products are UF), powder and HF-H, gas.
Micrometallic filters recover any UF), which is entrained in the exit gas. A
vibrator is used to shake free any UF), which clings to the filter or tower
walls. A chemical trap using a CaSO), or NaF pellet bed recovers any unreacted
UF, in the exit gases, although the amount so collected is negligibly small
in normal operation. The exit gases are scrubbed free of HF with either a
KOH solution spray or a NaF bed.

This process has nOt been operated at a high level of radioactivity.
The UF, from the power reactor volatility process would be somewhat radioactive,
with the major activity probably 7, a "hot" pilot plant demonstration should
be provided in a fused salt power reactor development program. No unusual diffi-
culties are anticipated; however, since the present continuous process is smooth- *
running and practically automatic.

For molten salt reactors using sodium rather than lithium based fuels,

the UF to UF), recycle may well be greatly simplified by reducing the UF¢ with

H

5 on the NaF bed and using the NaF-UF) pellets for fuel make-up.

5. Build-up of Even-Mass-Number Uranium Isotopes

 

The build-up of £2, 3H v2, and 1? non-fissionable isotopic
diluents in 2 and >? plays an important part in fuel cycle economics.
Although >? does not build up enough to affect the neutron balance signifi-
cantly, its hard-gamma-emitting daughters grow fast enough to be a biological

hazard in the handling of 33, and thus adversely affect the resale value of

Radiative captures in Pa and U lead to isotopic contamination

of the >? with ad With no processing to separate these isotopes, and none
seems feasible, the aa builds up until it is being produced and burned at the
same rate. At equilibrium, in thermal reactors, there is ~/57 percent as much
aa as 3, with 23H capturing ~» 9 percent as many neutrons as ©, In

fused salt resonance reactors with higher capture to fission ratios, at equili-

a better fuel than =,

Neutron capture in 236 results in an isotopic poison, since 2,
with a 6.75 day half-life, decays to Np too fast to permit useful amounts
of the fissionable 7 to build up. In completely thermal reactors with no

36 bullds up until it is ~v18 times as abundant as v2,

isotopic processing, rr
and captures ~ 16 percent as many neutrons. Normally, in any real thermal
reactor, resonance capture by 2% will reduce the steady state ratio to less
than 18. Isotopic separation nf 2? and 2% may be feasible because of the
large amounts involved an: because it is important in a breeder-converter
economy. On its own merits in a separate cascade, it should cost at least

9 times as much as separation of 2? from #38 but by feeding it into exist-~
ing cascades, either by adding top stages or accepting lower production rates,

less expensive processing can probably be achieved. The K-25 Operations Analysis ‘

division is studying the gaseous diffusion problem, and ORNL is studying the

 

 
-91 -

over-all problem. At present, AEC buy-back prices for we» do not penalize

236 38

isotopic dilution with aa and U any more than they do dilution with ve .
Despite this present buy-back policy, this molten salt reactor study has
assumed that, in the long run, equilibrium 2% poisoninz would simply have to
be toleratcd. This is pessimistic if the a is kept separate from the y2d3
in a two region converter, or if a resale market to the military or to other
reactors is available at prices near the present AEC buy-back level.

For a steady state reactor using highly enriched ye» feed (93% 25,
6% 28, 1% 24) and with no isctopic processing, the a at equilibrium will
capture 6/93 as many neutrons as the ">? fed, Ina "e~rpletely thermal”
reactor, at equilibrium there would be 16 times as much 238 as 2, In
fused sait resorance reactors, the 238 would build up to only about 10 percent
~i¢ the a fed. Thus at isotopic equilibrium, 236 is a worse contaminant
than 238, Neutron capture in 238 produces fissionable Pueo7, For this study,

it has been assumed that equilibrium concentrations of and captures in 2%

35 chain is kept separate from the a

would have to be acceptedi. If the a
chain, this is a more pessimistic assumption than is usually made. Even with
mixed chains, it is a more pessimistic assumption than is often made. For
example, present buy-back prices permit the Consolidated Edison reactor to use
a mixed ew, thorium fuel and sell the resulting mixture of U-232-233-234-235-

236-238 for #15 per gram of the amount of yod3 and a that it contains.

6. Radioactive Waste Disposal

 

At 600 Mw of heat for 7000 hrs/yr, a reactor produces ~ 190 kg/yr
of fission products. In molten salt reactors, perhaps 24 weight percent of
the fission products can be removed as Xe-Kr gases, leaving 145 kg to be removed

by chemical processing. The proposed chemical processing flow sheet waste streams
-92 -

include fused salt, NaF pellets, F, -N, and HF-H, gases. Most of the non-gaseous
fission products remain in the core salt residue and may be stared in this form.
Most of the remaining fission products are removed by periodically flushing out
the micrometallic filter between the fluorinator and the NaF bed and the cold
trap between the NaF bed and the F, disposal unit. The NaF bed 1s replaced
occasionally when it becomes poisoned with niobium and zirconium. Any remain-
ing fission products in the gas streams are scrubbed out with the F, and HF

or vented to the reactor off-gas system.

For optimum costs, high power molten salt reactors shoul’. probably
have relatively large inventories of enriched uranium and be processed about
twice per fuel-inventory burn-up, a compromise between the cost of salt replace-
ment and the savings due to improved breeding-converzion ratio. The core salt
discard rate indicated in the following section is 500-1000 £t° [yr This volume
corresponds to a farfly high fission product concentration, comparing favorably
with any other type of power reactor processing. The disposal problem is not
a small one, however. The high concentration of fission products makes the heat
dissipation a problem. The high value which the salt would have if the fission
products were removed ( #1300/£t> for 11 Be, perhaps half that much for Na-Be),
makes it desirable to store it in an easily recoverable form until means of re-
claiming it economically can be developed. Underground storage tanks cooled
by natural circulation of air, with the salt kept molten, appear to he an
acceptable answer. These might well be built one at a time, each with a one-

Year storage capacity, until a final decision on ultimate disposal is made.

G. Fuel Cycle Economics

 

1. Cost Bases

Fissionable isotopes have been valued at $17/g and inventory charges
calculated at 4%/yr. Thorium cost in fluoride salts has been taken as $30/kg,
an arithmetic average of published prices of $17/kg as nitrate and g43/kg as

metal. A price of $91/kg for 99.99 percent 117

in large quantities, an authori-
tative estimate from Y-12, has been assumed. A fluoride salt cost of g5/1b,
plus the cost of the special materials uranium, thorium, lithium-7, has been
used 72/, This leads to $1l.15/1b for 69 IiF-31 BeF, and $15.40/1b for 75 1iF-
25 ThE) . About one-ialf of the latter is for thorium. The original salt
inventories have been capitalized with a 16 percent annual charge corresponding
to a 20-year depreciation period. It is assumed that new core salt will be
purchased to replace the amounts rrocessed. The blanket salt is used over the
20-year reactor life without excessive fission product poisoning build-up.
Fissionable material consumption cost is based on feeding 93 percent

enriched ye?

to the core system to compensate for a breeding conversion ratio
of less than unity. It is assumed that 2 is not available for purchase at

an economic price, although it would be worth more than ye? in a molten salt

reactor due to its better nuclear characteristics. It is also assumed that

isotopic re-enrichment of we? or a2

or resale of even isotopic contaminated
uranium is not economical and, therefore, that the molten salt power reactor
must burn out the non-fissionable isotopes and pay for it in lower breeding-

conversion ratio.

2. "Steady State" Neutron Balances and Comparative Fuel Costs

 

The neutron balances given in this section are not the actual ones
given by the Univac, but, rather, modifications or corrections of the original
balances as required to make the reactors both "critical" and "steady state”.

The Univac results were used to obtain flux-averaged microscopic cross sections
for the various elements, and these were assumed to remain constant as con-
centrations of the individual absorbers were changed provided the total macro-
scopic absorption cross section was held constant. The results are believed
to be fairly good for comparison purposes, but no better on an absolute basis
than the basic cross sections themselves.

The fuel costs compared below include only fissionable material rental,
fissionable material purchased for burn-up, and core salt purchased to replace
that processed. These are the "rapidly variable" fuel cycle costs, i.e., those
which vary sharply in "reference design" type.reactors (Section III), depending
on choice of operating conditions. Although the chemical plant capital and
operating costs would also vary to some extent with processing rate, their varia-
tion is not fast enough to affect the optimization appreciably.

Three "different" reactor cases are compared below, five versions of
a "reference" case and one version each of "low inventory" and "high inventory"
cases. The first two cases are for 6-foot diameter (113 ££2) cores with 337 £t2
external holdup. The last case is for a 5-foot diameter core (65 £47) with the

same external holdup. The values of v were taken from BNL~325 to be:
U-233: 2.54 U-235: 2.46

Flux-averaged a's and o's were chosen separately for each case from the Univac

calculations on which they were based.

Co
-95 -
Reference Case - The columns headed A, B, C, and D in Table XIV
describe steady state reactors based on Ocusol-A Case 49 for various chemical
processing rates and using 93 percent >» make-up. The reactor of Column E
is like that of D except that a make-up is assumed. The flux-averaged

values of a for these reactors were:
U-233%: 0.15 U-235: 0.41

The flux-averaged microscopic absorption cross sections were in the follow-

ing ratios:

U-233: 1.00

U-235: 0.60
U-234-6-8: 0.37
FP: 0.22

Th (blanket): 0.036
Th (core): 0.125

Column A gives the fissionable material inventory, neutron balances and fuel
costs for an "infinite processing rate", i.e., no uranium or fission products
in blanket and no fission products in core. In the other columns the blanket
is assumed to be processed for uranium removal at a once-per-year rate (with
an average-over-thedife-of-the-reactor amount of fission products included in
the blanket) and the core processing rate is varied. Corrosion product and
Np! poisoning is not included as such, but it is felt that this is compensa-
ted for by taking no credit for separate removal of gaseous products or for the
production of, or fissions by, plutonium. The costs in Column E assume that
#3 could be bought for $17/g. They may be interpreted to indicate that, by

comparison with Column D, the fused salt reactor could pay twice as much for
a as for ©,

Low Inventory Case - The above-discussed reference case had its median
fission in the 34-61 ev energy group, with PP inventories of ~ 600 kg.
Column F describes a reactor (based on Ocusol-A Case 44) with a lower uranium
inventory. The median fission was in the 10-15 ev group. The flux-averaged

a values were:

Fuel make-up with 9° is assumed. This case does not appear to offer as
economical a fuel cycle as the reference case. The biggest difference is in
the increased fractior: of neutrons lost to salt, shell and leakage ("other"
in the table).

High Inventory Case - Since it appeared from the above two cases
that an even higher inventory might be still more economical, another case
was examined and is listed in Column G (based on Eyewash Cases 26 and 27, with
Ocusol-A a's inserted). Although this case differs from the preceding two in
core size as well as inventory, it does appear that the higher inventory "pays

off" in increased breeding conversion ratio and reduced salt replacement costs.

SECTION ITI

Reference Design Reactor

A. Introduction

To allow a realistic estimate of the performance, safety, economics
and cost of construction of a typical molten salt reactor, a specific reactor
type and size was chosen for detailed study. The principal items considered
in making this choice were:

1. The reactor should be capable of relatively early construction.

No component, material; or process is used that is not either already available,
or tested or under test in at least pilot plant scale equipment. The assumption
is made, however, that equipment such as pumps and heat exchangers can be de-
signed and built successfully in larger sizes than those tested to date. Devel-
opment and testing charges will be associated with this scale-up,

2, Safety in an early reactor is of paramount importance. Great
emphasis is placed on avoiding any reasonable possibility of chemical accident
involving radioactive comporents,

3. Long life of components is essential for long-term economy. On
this basis the alloy INOR-8 was chosen as a material of construction; however,
its reliability has not been demonstrated in long term tests, although short
term tests suggest that it should last for many years.

Lk, The reactor should possess the ability to serve as a prototype
for central station power generation,

5. The possibility that this may be the first power reactor of its
kind requires that as.much information as possible be derived from it. Thus
the reactor should be as versatile as possible without incorporating experimental

facilities that seriously affect the economics or continuity of power production.

 
- 99 -

While it was not expected that this "reference design reactor" would
necessarily turn out to be the best one possible, it was chosen after considera-
tion of a large variety of factors and should be representative of good molten
salt power reactors that can be built in the near future.

The reference design reactor is a two region homogeneous converter
with a core approximately 6 feet in diameter and a blanket 2 feet thick.
Moderation is provided by the salt itself so there is no need for a moderator
or other structure inside the reactor. The core, with its volume of 113 cubic
feet or 3200 liters, is capable of generating 600 megawatts of heat at a power
density of only 187 watts/cc, This rate of power generation is well within
safe limits, and the total power output of 600 thermal megawatts from the
core, plus additional heat from the blanket, allows a net electric power genera-
tion of approximately 240 megawatts.

The basic core salt is a mixture of about 70 mole percent LiF and
30 percent BeF,. Additions of thorium fluoride can be made if desired, and
enough UF), will be added to make it critical. The blanket will consist of
the eutectic of LiF and ThF), , or mixtures of it with the basic core salt. The
melting point of the core salt is 867°F and that of the blanket salt is 1080°F,
or lower.

Both the core fuel and the blanket salt will be circulated to external
primary heat exchangers, six in parallel for the core and two in parallel for
the blanket. The numbers of parallel circuits were chosen so that useful opera-
tion could still be obtained if any one circuit should fail. It also turns out
that reasonable sizes of pumps and heat exchangers result from the 100 Mw heat
removal requirement for each of the six core circuits.

Flinak, a mixture of alkali fluorides (mixture 12), was chosen as

the intermediate coolant because it has reasonable chemical compatibility with

 
- 100 -

the core and blanket salts and with sodium, and, of the salts, it has good heat
transfer characteristics, It will become only slightly radioactive by exposure
to the delayed neutrons from the core fuel and will serve as an isolating link
to keep all radioactivity from contact with the steam system. The melting
point of the Flinak is 850°F.

Secondary heat exchangers will transfer heat from the Flinak to the
sodium, which is used directly to heat the boilers, superheaters and reheaters.
Details of a reasonable heat transfer system have been worked out, so that with
a fuel temperature of 1200°F, a steam temperature of 1000°F can be achieved.
Figure 6 gives a block diagram of the gross features of one of the heat trans-
fer systems of the core circuit. The blanket cooling systems are similar.

After a careful consideration of the problem of control of the reactor,
it has been decided that there is nc need for any control rods. Reactor con-
trol is automatically maintained by the negative temperature coefficient.
Uranium fluoride fuel or thorium fluoride as a poison will be added when the
need arises, as indicated by temperature measurements in the non-radioactive
sodium system, Thus, this reactor can be properly called a nuclear furnace,
requiring fuel additions to maintain temperature.

The basic hardware of the system lends itself to a number of different
fuels and fuel cycles. For example, the core can be operated with "Pp, or

vr, or, perhaps later, with PuF Different inventories of uranium age

3°
possible, depending on the amount of fertile material introduced, and the
amount of fission products and heavy elements that are allowed to build up.
One indicated mode of operation is to start up with >? in the core, together

with a little thorium, and to process the core on such a cycle that a complete

reprocessing would be carried out approximately every year, The processing

would consist of removing the uranium from the core fluid as UFg by the volatility
process, storing the core fluld with its contaminating fission products for later
processing, and making up fresh fuel from the reduced UF, with new UP), added
to compensate for fuel burn-up and for heavy element build-up. ue would build
up from whatever thorium is included in the core. The 2 extracted from the
blanket by the volatility process would either be stored until enough is obtained
for a pure => core loading, or it could be added to the core as soon as it is
extracted. In either case, the uranium could be recirculated indefinitely and
economical operation would be achieved, even after equilibrium concentrations
of aa >, and 8 arz built up. |

A factor in the selection of the multiple stage heat transfer system .
involving two intermediate (luids was the desire to have only compatible fluids
in adjoining volumes where leaks could involve radioactive materials. This
avoids the possibility of liberation of fission products as the result of a
chemical accident. As the system is now designed, the ‘pressures developed by
the pumps, by difference in density of the fluids, and by over pressure, are
such that any failure producing mixing of fluids would tend to produce flow
toward the reactor core, rather than from it; tending further to confine the
fission products.

An exothermic chemical reaction would result if the sodium and water
or steam were mixed, However, this would not involve radioactive materials
and would pose only the same danger problems as in any conventional plant han-
dling quantities of chemically active materials where no biological poisons
are involved.

The components of the reference design reactor are relatively simple; *

the apparent complexity stems mostly from the number of components rather than
- 103 -

their type. The large number of components is required because of the large
power output contemplated. The basic simplicity of the components together
with the high thermal efficiency and low fuel turnover cost encourages the
belief that the future cost of power from reactor plants of this type might

be fairly low,

B. Heat Generation, Transfer, and Conversion System
l. Reactor

The heat transfer system for the reference design reactor has six
parallel, independent paths for heat flow from the reactor core fuel to the
steam system, and two similer paths for heat from the blanket fluid. Figure
7 shows section and plan views of the reactor vessel, giving the general
arrangement of six parallel core pumps and return lines. The reactor vessel,
piping, and pump housings and impellers will be made of INOR-8.

As explained in the introduction of this section, the multiple heat
removal circuit system was selected as offering reliability and safety. The
symmetrical positioning of reasonably sized components allows low fuel holdup and
low thermal stresses in the reactor structure and its attendant piping.

The fuel will be enriched to the extent that the average temperature
of the core for criticality will be 1150°F. At the full rated power genera-
tion of 600 megawatts of heat in the core, the system is designed so that the
fuel salt will enter the core at 1100°F and leave it at 1200°F., With this
100°F temperature range, the total flow of fuel through the core must be 3k ,000
gallons per minute. At this rate, it will take the fuel an average of 1.5
seconds to pass through the core and six seconds to make a camplete circuit
of core plus external system, Each of the six parallel core heat removal cirs
cuits will then handle 5,650 gallons per minute of fuel, over a temperature

range of 100°F, and transfer 100 megawatts of heat,

 
- 104 -

The multiple circuits, each independent, make unnecessary any valv-
ing or flow regulation in the fuel or primary circuit. Stopping one fuel pump
would result in slow back flow through that pump and its exchanger. With all
fuel pumps stopped, convection would provide sufficient flow to dispose of
after-heat, provided primary coolant flow is maintained.

Each blanket cooling circuit will be able to provide full blanket
cooling. Normally one circuit would be in full scale operation and the other
pumping slowly, on stand-by. The total amount of heat to be removed from
the blanket will vary with the > content of the blanket. Though detailed
calculations of the blanket heat removal system have not been made, it is
estimated that the total heat generation in the blanket will not exceed 35
megawatts at any time. Hence, it is expected that heat exchangers in that

system will be similar to, but smaller than, those used in the core system.

2. Heat Exchangers
All heat exchangers, including those in the steam system, are of

shell and tube design, with counter flow of the fluids. U-shaped shells,
which minimize tube thermal stress, will be used in every case except in the
reheat circuit, where tube and shell temperature differences are low. Table
XV gives a summary of the characteristics of the principal heat exchangers
used in the entire system, and Figure 8 shows diagramatically the temperature
conditions of each heat exchanger.

The primary heat exchangers will transfer heat from the fuel
(composition 74) to the primary coolant (Flinak). The principal objectives
in the design of the primary heat exchangers are first, dependability, and
second, low fuel holdup and low pressure drop. Both of these objectives are

met best by having the fuel flow through the tubes rather than on the shell

side of the heat exchangers, The temperature range of the fuel affects these
two objectives, Increasing the temperature range decreases the external fuel
volume holdup, but at the cost of increasing the pressure drop in the exchanger,

Moderate fuel holdup in the exchanger is obtained with O.3-inch ID
tubing. Although a wall thickness of 0.039 inches has been selected as offer-
ing reasonable life and temperature drop, it is possible that additional data
and analyses will make a wall thickness of 0,060 inches appear desirable.

The secondary heat exchanger, Flinak-to-sodium, has flow design
criteria similar to the primary exchanger, but the volume of salt in the ex-
changer is a minor consideration. Consequently, larger tubes than are used
in the primary can be used, which will reduce the number of tubes in a unit
and simplify fabrication. One-half inch 07 x 0.050-inch wall tubing has been
selected.

The Na-to-water boiler and Na-to-steam superheater and reheater are
designed with single wall tubes but double tube sheets, Easier containment of
high pressure steam is achieved by putting it inside the tubes, as is standard
practice in ordinary boilers, The low pressure sodium is easily contained in
the shell, As the sodium tube sheet and the steam tube sheet are at different
temperatures, sufficient length of tubing must be provided between them to give
low bending stresses in the tubes. To keep this parasitic length low, the
tubes should be as small in diameter as possible, but reliable fabrication is
easier with large tubes and thicker walls. One~inch ID x 0.120-inch wall tub-
ing has been selected as a practical solution for these conflicting demands.

The boiler is of the "once-through" variety and is designed to
deliver steam superheated by about 30°F to the superheater, This assures that

no moisture will enter the superheater. The superheater is designed to deliver

 

 
- 110 -

steam to the turbine at 1000°F, and an attemperator will be placed in the steam *
line ahead of the turbine to insure control of the maximum temperature,

Throttle valves in the feed water supply line will be used to main-
tain balance between the eight separate circuits, while throttle valves in the
sodium lines of each separate circuit will maintain the balance of the heat
supply among the boiler, superheater; and heat exchanger.

A separate sodium circuit will be used for reheat, with the reheater
located near the turbines. A sodium-to-sodium heat exchanger in each of the
six main sodium circuits will supply heat to the reheat sodium circuit. The
insertion of this extra heat exchanger link, together with the lower heat trans-
fer properties of the lower-pressure reheat steam (350 psi) means that reheat-
ing to 960°F is more economically accomplished than reheating to 1000°F, This
does not appreciably reduce the turbine efficiency, but only requires that the
first expansion be carried to a lower pressure than for reheating to 1000°F,
With the reheater located near the turbines, 5°percent pressure arop is predicted
as compared to 10 percent when the steam is returned to a furnace &/

The reheater, and probably the Na-to-Na exchangers in the reheat cir-
cuit, can be of the straight tube design without causing undue thermal stress.
As the reheat boiler has, of necessity, a large number of short tubes, the U-
shaped configuration would be difficult to fabricate. Thus, it is fortunate
that low stress permits use of the straight tube design.

As shown in Table XV, the primary and secondary heat exchangers will

be made of INOR-8, the boilers of 2 1/4 Croloy, and the superheaters, reheaters,

and sodium-to-sodium heat exchangers of 316 stainless steel, Although these

are suitable choices at present, it is indicated in Section II that future ex-
perimental work may lead to the liberal use of high nickel alloys such as

Inconel in the sodium, water and steam systems.

3. Steam Cycle
The steam cycle selected for design consideraticn uses 1800 psia,

1000°F steam, with one reheat to 960°F in 3600-1800 rpm cross-compound tur-
bines, Figure 9 gives a diagram of the steam cycle, showing pressures, tem-
peratures, and mass flow rates of the steam. Seven bleed-offs are used for
heating feed water to 515°F., With a condenser pressure of 1 1/2 inches Hg
(92°F), a turbine heat rate of 8070 Btu/kwh is achieved. This corresponds
to a steam cycle efficiency of 42.3 percent.

Coal-fired central stations use six percent of the gross power out-
put in auxiliaries; seven percent appears to be a reasonable figure for this
reactor power plant. This latter figure is reached by subtracting one per-
cent for draft fans, coal pulverizers, ash handling, etc., connected with a
fossil fuel furnace, and adding two percent for pumping fuel and coolants
associated with the nuclear furnace. Net station efficiency is 39 percent
or 8675 Btu/kwh delivered at the bus-bars. For comparison, an efficient
coal-fired unit, the Commonwealth Edison, Chicago, State Line Plant, reports
8550 Btu/kwh sent out from the 191 Mw Unit No. 3.

At this preliminary state, no attempt has been made to optimize
the steam cycle on a cost basis, or to select an extremely efficient
cycle. The conditions selected--1800 psi, 1000°F, reheat to 960°F--are
in line with proven industrial practice, and require that the design of
the reactor system face up to problems of pressure, temperature, and han-

dling of reheat. The steam cycle proposed is based on the cycle used in

the Astoria Station of Consolidated Edison Company, New York, which

was the result of an extensive study 81/, 82/, Modifications were made to
meet the special conditions of the heat supply and cooling water temperature
available.

A feed water temperature about 100%F below the saturation tempera-
ture of the boiler seems to be as low as is desirable for a sodium boiler,
based on thermal stress considerations, This is higher than is normally used
with a fossil fuel boiler, where lower temperatures allow more heat extraction
from the flue gases. In compensation for the additional feed-water heaters,

however, the higher feed water temperature increases the steam cycle efficiency

 

slightly.
C. Components and Component System
1. Pumps

The molten salt and liquid metal pumps will be of the same general
design as those now in use in ANP, except for differences of size and capacity,
and refinements of details which may develop before the time for procurement
arrives. One pump of each new size (capacity and head) will be given thorough
tests before additional pumps of the same size are procured, and each pump
procured will be proof-tested before use in a power plant. The pump sizes re-
quired are indicated as to flow and head by the data in Table XV describing
the heat exchanger. Pumps, compressors, fans, etc,, for all purposes, except

for the movement of molten salts and liquid metals, will be conventional.

2, Valves

Salt and sodium mechanical stop valves will be bellows sealed,

- 11h -

cermet-seat type. No salt or sodium stop valves will be used on other than

111 -and~-drain lines, and these will be 2-inch IPS.

 

No flow control valves are required in molten salt lines,

The flow control valves in sodium lines will be bellows sealed. They
will not be required to stop flow, but only to control it.

All molten salts and sodium valves will follow the most recent ANP
design for such valves, except for size and possible modifications for diminish-

ing fluid head loss.

3. Pipes and Tubes
Pipes and tubes must be designed to absorb all temperature transients

and differences without exceeding specified stress levels. In general, they

 

will be anchored at walls and at heavy pieces of equipment, and appropriately
shaped bends between anchor points will be provided to absorb all expansions,
contractions, and twists. The main piping in the fuel salt circuits leading
to the primary heat exchangers will be 12 incheg in diameter. The blanket cir-
cuits will use 10-inch . pipe. The coolant salt systems will use lli-inch .
pipe in the core heat removal system and 10-inch . pipe 1n the blanket heat

removal system. All these pipes will be made of INOR-8.

4, Fill-and-Drain Tanks

 

a, Fuel salt fill-and-drain tanks
Two tanks will be required, each with sufficient capacity to contain
all the fuel salt in the circulating fuel system (approximately 500 £2), One
tank will be available for temporary storage of used fuel salt while the othep
tank is belng used to serve the continued operation of the power plant.
Each of the tanks will be designed so that it can be heated to 1200°F,

and so that maximm after heat (approximately seven Mw total) can be removed

CO
- 115 -

with the hottest part of the shell cooler than 1500°F and the axial salt tem-
perature considerably less than the fuel boiling point, It is estimated that
this criterion can be met by fabridating the tanks from a number of 12-inch
I.D. pipe, sggregating to a total length of 600 feet. Shell temperatures under
after-heat conditions will be maintained by recirculating air, in turn cooled
by water-cooled radiators. Provision will be made for powering the cooling
system from emergency power (diesel or battery) if the regular power supply
should fail. Heating wlll be done by electrical resistance.

Tank fittings required will include the following: (1) salt charge
lines; (2) salt drain line; (3) line for transferring molten salt to and from
the circulating-fuel system; (4) inert-gas supply line; and (5) inert-gas

discharge (off-gas) line,

b. Blanket salt fill-and-drain tanks

 

Two tanks will be required, each with sufficient capacity to contain

‘all the blanket salt in the circulating blanket system (approximately 600 to ).

One tank will be available for storage of used blanket salt while the other is

being used to serve the continued operation of the power plant.

Each of the two tanks will be designed with provisions for heating
to 1300°F. No special provision need be made for removal of decay heat other
than including capacity in the storage room atmosphere cooling equipment to
remove this additional heat from the room.

Tank fittings required will be the same as for the fuel salt tanks,

¢c. Intermediate heat transfer salt fill-and-drain tanks
Four tanks are required: (1) two duplicate tanks, each capable of
containing all the salt in all the intermediate heat transfer circuits; and

(2) two duplicate tanks, each capable of containing the salt for the largest

 
 

- 116 -

intermediate heat transfer circuit. Each of the four tanks 1s to be connected
for filling and draining each intermediate transfer circuit separately. Each
of the four tanks is to he provided for heating to 1200°F.

Tank fittings required are the same as for the fuel salt fill-and-

drain tanks,

d. Sodium fill-and-drain tanks

 

Four tanks are required: (1) two duplicate tanks, each capable of
containing all the sodium in all the circulating systems; and (2) two dupli-
cate tanks, each capable of containing the sodium for the largest single
sodium circuit. Each of the four tanks is to be connected for filling or
draining each of the sodium circuits separately. Each of the four tanks is
to be provided for heating to 1200°F.

Tank fittings required are the same as for the fuel salt fill-and-

drain tanks.

5. Gas Supply Systems (Helium, Nitrogen, and Compressed Air)

Helium gas, containing less than 10 ppm oxygen and having a dew
point less than minus 70°F, willl be the only gas allowed to come in contact
with any salt or sodium, except during chemical processing. Supply lines from
the helium storage banks will contain pressure reducing valves, shutoff valves,
flow and pressure instrumentation, and safety devices as required for safety
and dependability.

The consumption of helium will depend on & number of design details,
including: (1) dilution of off-gas; (2) use of helium in instrumentation;
and (3) pump design for pumps serving barren salts and liquid metal systems,

Nitrogen may be used as an atmosphere around some assemblies and Bub-

assemblies of equipment. If so, the handling equipment will be similar to the

 
- 117 -

 

helium handling equipment, but with less strict purity requirements. Whether
or not nitrogen will be used anywhere in the plant will depend on future deci-
sions as to ambient atmosphere requirements.

Compressed air will probably be required for some instruments, but

is a comparatively minor item.

6. Off-Gas System

The xenon and krypton evolving from the fuel at the fuel-to-helium
interface in the fuel expansion chamber will be (1) diluted with helium in
that chamber, (2) removed through a tube to a holdup tank to allow time for
short half-life decay, thence (3) passed through a charcoal bed for further
holdup and decay, then (4) discharged to the atmosphere through a stack.

The bases for design of the system will be the same as for the HRE,
the HRT, and the ART 8/ Parameter relations are becoming well established 8y/
and continued experimentation is refining the quantitative knowledge still
further, The present design basis (for later refinement) is the ART off-gas

Fl

system, modified to ten times the ART off-gas production.

T. Preheating and Temperature Maintenance

Provision will be made for preheating the following items to 1200°F
in 48 hours, although a longer time will normally be used for preheating: |
reactor, salt expansion chamber-pump units, salt and salt-to-sodium heat ex-
changers, connecting pipes and tubes, salt and sodium fill-and-drain tanks
and fill-and drain lines, salt fill-and-drain tank charging lines, new ‘salt

storage vessels (from which molten salts are charged into salt fill-and-drain

 

83/ Reference Quarterly Reports

84/ ORNL-2116
- 118 -

tanks), and off-gas lines to off-gas system. Provision will be made for pre-
heating the following items to 1000°F in 48 hours: superheaters, boilers, re-
heaters, sodium lines, and sodium storage vessels 85/,

The boilers will have provision for additional heat input for start-
up, both in the boiler and upstream of the boiler, so that excessive thermal
stresses will be avoided during start-up. The general pattern of boller start-
up operation will be very similar to that in a conventional power plant.

It is anticipated that most of the heating of reactor system com-
ponents will be done with heaters consisting of electrical resistance wire
embedded in shaped ceramic matrices. More detailed engineering of components
may show that it is more convenient, more dependable; or cheaper to heat some
parts of the system with direct electrical resistance, electrical induction 8¢/,
gas heat, or auxiliary steam. |

Preheaters will be so arranged as to allow separate temperature con-

trol of individual subassemblies.

D. Plant Layout

Figures 10 and 11 show a workable disposition of the major power
plant components.

Figure 10 is a plan view and shows the reactor surrounded by six
primary (fuel salt to Flinak) heat exchangers and two blanket-cooling heat
exchangers. All of these components should be as closely grouped as remote
maintenance will allow, in order to minimize the volume of fuel salt.

Directly above the reactor and its primary heat exchangers is a

shield containing removable plugs which allow access from above. (See

 

85/ May be designed for slower preheat rate

86/ Used by Atomics International on the SRE
- 119 -

Figure 11.) This shielded region above the reactor is allocated to tools for
remote disassembly and reassembly of fuel salt pumps or primary heat exchangers.
It may also be used as a temporary storage room for radioactive parts.

oo Enclosing the reactor primary complex and the shielded space above
is a large steel shell to contain fission fragment geses should they escape
from the primary system. It also will allow for maintaining a relatively
inert atmosphere should repairs to the system become necessary. The lock lead-
ing to the vessel makes it possible to take parts or tools fn or out of the
vessel without appreciably affecting its atmosphere, Personnel may, if nec-
essary, enter the shielded space above the reactor to service or alter the re-
mote handling tools.

The primary heat exchangers are shown in a vertical position and

are connected to the main piping by welded flange joints. This arrangement
is believed to provide for the least difficulty in the remote operations of
removing and replacing heat exchangers. The primary pumps will be of the top
access variety, to make the replacement of the motor-impeller portion less
difficult by remote control. The pump units will probably be held in place
with a bolted flange. It is recognized that much detailed design and develop-

ment work will be required to insure adequate operation of remote maintenance

.equipment.

Surrounding the steel shell and behind concrete shielding are eight
compartments, each one in turn shielded from the others, These compartments
contain the secondary heat exchangers (Flinak-to-Na) and Flinak pumps. Remov-
able shield plugs above each compartment will allow access to, and replacement
of, the components contained therein,

The sodium is conducted from the above-mentioned compartments to
four separate layers of boilers, superheaters, pumps, and blenders. The top

layer is to serve the blanket cooling system.

From the boilers and superheaters on, the system and building arrange-
ment closely resemble a conventional steam-electric power plant. However, in
place of coal and ash handling equipment; space not shown in the layouts must
be provided for fuel, Flinak, sodium, and blanket salt storage vessels, and
chemical processing equipment , It is visualized that these facilities would
be located below and at the side of the reactor complex opposite the steam
plant.

Space for the auxiliary features of a conventional power plant, such
as water processing, machine shop, instrument shop, offices, etc., must, of

course, be provided.

E. Chemical Processing and Fuel Cycle Economics

1, Core Processing

The core salt chemical processing system is a combination of the
ORNL fluoride volatility and the K-25 UFg reduction processes discussed in
Section, Part F, The core salt is transferred by gravity or inert gas pressure ’
from the core loop to a holdup vessel where short-half-lived fission products
are allowed to decay before the salt is transferred to the fluorination vessel.
The reactor fill-and-drain tank is felt to be the ideal holdup vessel since
it is already designed for cooling hot salt and since its volume is large com-
pared to the heldup required by the chemical plant. If thirty days proves to
be an adequate cooling period, about sixty cubic feet of core salt will be
stored at one time.

The core salt will be fluorinated in 1.k to batches (ORNL pilot
plant size) at one-two batches per day (600 £t2/yr). The barren salt, stripped

of uranium but containing most of the Pu, fission products, and corrosion

products, is transferred to tank storage where it is held for future salt

 
- 123% -

recovery, The 10-kgU-capacity NaF pellet beds (ORNL pilot plant size) will
be operated on a once-or-twice-per week cycle (i.e, several fluorination
cycles per sorption cycle). The volatility part of the chemical plant produces
liquid UFg in cylinders. The UFg reduction tower will operate simi-continucusly,
using UFg from the volatility plant as feed. It will discharge its UF), product
directly to a fuel salt mixing pot, to which is also fed fresh salt and make-
up UF), .

Uranium losses in chemical processing are quite low, about 10 ppm
in waste salt and 2 ppm in waste gases. This is approximately 1 kg/yr uranium

loss,

2. Blanket Processing

Chemical processing of the blanket salt is physically much the same
as that of the core salt, except that after fluorination,the blanket salt with
the Pa and fission products that it contains is returned to the blanket system.
Because of the much lower power density in the blanket, holdup for the fission
product cooling is not a problem,

Separate fluorinators for core and blanket salts will prevent possible
cross-contamination., A continuous fluorinator for the blanket is assumed since
complete uranium recovery is not necessary, and although continuous fluorina-
tion has not been demonstrated, no new basic development is required. (Con-
tinuous fluorination of the core salt would require further development to
demonstrate complete uranium recovery.) A conservative blanket processing
rate of one blanket loop volume per year is assumed (achievable even with
batch fluorination) though a much faster rate is probably possible. Separate
NaF beds and cold traps are provided to enable withdrawal of pure vr, from

the system if desired. It is assumed that the same UF reduction tower will

serve both core and blanket.

35. Chemical Processing Costs .
a. Investment Costs
- »
The ORNL volatility pilot plant capital costs can be broken down
as follows:
Replacements and
Design Construction Modifications
Through FY-56 $ 130,000 $350,000 | J—
Budget FY-57-58-59 210,000 296,000 328,000
Subtotals $ 340,000 $646,000 $328,000
Grand Total $1,314,000
These figures include replacements and modifications which should
not be required in a second plant. They also include solid fuel element han-
dling and dissolution facilities which would not be required in the reference
design reactor plant. These costs do not include building and service facil- »
ities for reducing UF to UF), and reconstituting fuel. The over-all plant cost
estimate in Appendix I includes the following capital costs assignable to the :
chemical plant:
v Building and site $ 250,000
VI Equipment and installation 1,500,000
VII Design 262, 500
VIII Prime Contractor L02, 500
IX Contingency Lo2,500
$2,817,500
‘
While the breakdown may not be exactly accurate, the total is felt
to be an adequate estimate of the cost. These investment costs are charged »

at sixteen percent per year,
- 125 -

b, Operating costs

The ORNL pilot plant operating budget for three fiscal years--1957,

 

1958, and 1959--totals $1,368,000. The reference design reactor chemical plant
would have lower "unusual costs" but higher "production-proportional costs” and
is estimated to cost $500,000/yr to operate, not including core salt replace-
ment cost which adds $810,000/yr (600 £t [yr at $1350/£¢°). These costs are
included with other fuel cycle costs in the discussion of the over-all power
costs that follows, Other fuel cycle costs are explained in Section II, Part

G, of this report.

4k, Fuel Cycle Economics

 

The nuclear characteristics of two region molten salt reactors have
been discussed in Section II, Part D. General aspects of fuel cycles for
molten salt power reactors have been discussed in Section II, Parts F and G,
together with the interdependence of dollar and neutron economics, For the
purpose of estimating fuel cycle costs for the reference design reactor, the
reactor of Column D, Table XIV, was chosen. (Reactor "E" had a much lower
fuel cost but assumed 3 make-up at $17/2.. Ir ye were available at $3 /g
such a reactor would have fuel costs about like "D" but would "look better”
because of the higher breeding ratio. Reactor "G" had a fuel cost ~~ ten per-
cent lower than "D" but had only a five foot core. Reactor "C" had very nearly
the same fuel cost as "D", with better breeding ratio but higher salt make-up
charge. } In Section III, Part F, the chemical plant construction cost has
been combined with the other reactor complex capital costs. The fuel cycle

"operating" costs are shown in Section III, Part F, as 2, 3 mills/kwh, which

results from Reactor "D" as follows:

 
- 126 -

$/yr Mills/kwh ’

23 + 25 rental’ Lh ,000

0.3
25 make-up 2,030,000 1.2 ’
Salt make-up 810,000 0.5
Chemical plant operation 200,000 0.3
| 3,781,000 2.3

The first three $/yr figures come from Table XIV, The chemical
plant operation estimate is given above in this section. The conversion to

mills/kwh is based on 240 Mv electricity for 7000 hrs/yr.

 

The cost difference between having the reactor on stand-by or on
the line at full power is 1.7 mills/kwh, the sum of "25 make-up" and "salt

make-up,"

F, Cost Analysis
l. Introduction

Any cost analysis of a system such as this naturally breaks into
three categories: (1) materials and component development costs. necessary be-
fore construction; (2) design and construction cost; and (3) operating costs,
Tt is on this basis that, costs are estimated for the reference design reactor.

For a detailed analysis, certain assumptions and decisions had to
be made. It is assumed for this cost analysis that the reference design
reactor will be the next molten salt power reactor constructed, This means
specifically that it is assumed its construction would not be preceded by
the construction of a smaller reactor and that most of the development work
undertaken would be pointed specifically at this reactor. Implicit in the
cost analysis are all of the decisions outlined in the above description of »

the reference design reactor. It is further assumed that for both the

Co

 
- 127 -

development and construction the timing will be such that this work can proceed

in an orderly and businesslike manner without either undue delay or extreme

urgency.

2. Materials and Components Development Costs

 

The present state of knowledge of this system is such that it is
reasonable to expect that a large part of the costs to be incurred prior to
constructing a power station will be for extrapolating and improving present
designs and testing particular components.

Section IT of this report gives a review of the present state of
technology as applied to this reactor, and any development program is necessar-
ily based on the background presented. Specific points of importance are:

1. An alloy (INOR-8) exists which has satisfactory mechanical and
fabrication properties and for which there is reason to expect adequate corro-
sion resistance to the salts used. However, long-term corrosion tests under
the specific condition imposed by the reference design reactor are yet to be
conducted, |

2. Satisfactory liquid metal and molten salt handling techniques
are known,

3. Satisfactory equipment for punping liquid metals and molten
salts has been developed and adequately proven, but will have to be redesigned
and reproyen in sizes and for operating periods appropriate to the needs of
this system.

Lk, A satisfactory chemical process has been devised and is in pilot
plant operation for recovery of uranium from molten salt.

5. The temperature coefficient of reactivity of the system is such

that no mechanical reactivity control devices are needed other than equipment

for fuel addition,

 

 
 

- 128 -

Orr this basis the items listed below would constitute the develop- «
ment effort required. Items one and two are required to prove that the y
materials proposed are compatible and sultable for long-term reactor use.
(1) Out-of-pile pumped loops and
natural convection loops $1,000,000
(2) 1In-pile loops, at least one each
for the core and blanket fluids 1, 500,000
| Subtotal $2,500,000
These two items constitute the initial investment in development
work, and further expenditures for development and construction of the reference
design reactor would be spent only if the expected favorable results were real-
ized. The $2,500,000 listed for items one and two represent this optimistic
expectation, If disappointing results were obtained, or if a great number
of experiments were performed, the amount could be considerably greater, *
Before construction of a reference design reactor, the following .
items should have development attention:
(3) Pump for circulation of reactor core salt, blanket salt, and
intermediate coolant salt
(4) Fuel-to-salt heat exchangers
(5) Coolant salt-to-sodium heat exchangers
(6) Piping and vessels
(7) Instrumentation
(8) Chemical processing
(9) Critical experiments
(10) Remote maintenance equipment »
(11) Sodium pumps
§

(12) Sodium heat exchangers, boilers, superheaters, blenders, and valves
5 bd bd 2

 

 
- 129 -

For the last two items, only acceptance tests are included in the estimate.
It is thus assumed that any basic problems of sodium-to-water boilers and
superheaters which are not already solved will be solved elsewhere.

Although rough estimates for individual items 3-12 have been
attempted, it is not believed that their accuracy warrants listing them
individually. Estimates of the costs of development for all the items 3-12
vary from $12,000,000 to $19,000,000. A very large uncertainty is associated
with item ten--remote maintenance equipment--this item canndt be assessed
completely without further study. |

If a molten salt reactor program is to be taken seriously, there
must also be supporting research carried out in metallurgy, chemistry, and
solid state physics. A portion of this work would be aimed at future better
modifications of the molten salt system. It is important that this research
be started early because cf the natural time lag between early research re-
sults and practical operating systems. Hence, the following item has to be
included in the total research and development costs:

(13) Supporting research and development --$600,000 per year

Estimates of the total research and development costs (items 1-13)

range from $18,000,000 to $27,000,000,

3. Design and Construction Costs

The best available system flow diagrams for the reference design
reactor have been broken down into individual components insofar as possible,
and costs of purchasing, inspecting, and installing these components have
been estimated on the basis of standard engineering cost estimating procedure
as modified by experience in the nuclear power field. These modifications are

extensive, as a result of the higher standards required and the necessity for

multiple inspection of every piece that goes into a reactor.

 
- 1% -

Wherever individual components were too small or numerous to be properly J

isolated, an attempt has been made to assign a cost figure to an entire subsystem,
such as in the cases of the inert gas systems of helium and nitrogen. In this
manner, an estimated construction cost that is felt to be on the conservative
glide was reached, This Includes 15 percent for engineering design; a sum of
$1,000,000 for a period of start-up operations before the plant is "on line";
a contingency factor of 20 percent of all reactor costs; and a factor of 23
percent vhich has been found normal for prime contractor fees in reactor con-
struction. The conventional portion of the plant, turbine, generator, etc.,
has not been treated in this manner as costs here on an installed basis can be
obtained with a high degree of accuracy 87/,

This preliminary, but detailed, cost analysis shows an anticipated
cost of $238 per installed kilowatt of generating capacity. A detailed break-

down of the cost estimate is shown in Appendix I.

4, Cost of Power from the Reference Design Reactor ,

 

Power costs fall naturally into three categories: (1) fixed costs,
(2) operation and mamintenance, and (3) fuel cycle costs.

Fixed costs are those charges resulting from capital investment in
the plant. In this study, this investment 1s calculated as shown in Appendix
I to be roughly $57,000,000 or $238/kw of installed capacity. Of this invest-
ment, $99/kw is for the conventional portion of the plant and $139/kw for the
reactor complex portion, including chemical processing equipment. As pointed

out by Mr, W, K. Davis 88/ a charge of roughly 12 percent per year is applicable

 

81/ See, for example, "Ninth Steam Station Cost Survey", Electrical World,
October 1955

88/ Progress in Nuclear Energy, Vol. VIII, McGraw Hill (1957), p 215

CO

 
- 131 -

to both these investment figures due to financing and taxes. If, for pur-
poses of computing amortization costs, one assumes a Lo-year life for the
conventional portion of the plant and a 20-year life for the remainder, these
add two and four percent, respectively, to these charges, giving a fixed

cost of li percent per year on the $99/kw of conventional plant and 16 per-
cent per year on the $139/kw of reactor portion. Using the accepted load
factors of 80 percent for a base load plant such as this results in a fixed
charge of 5.1 mills per kwh.

Operation and maintenance experience in conventional coal-fired
plants since the last war has been that these charges in plants of this size
have amounted to 0.4 mills/kwh, and that about 0.3 mills of thls charge was
for the coal burning and heat transfer equipment, Assuming reactor experi-
ence three times as bad leads to a cost (0.3 x 3 + 0.1) for operation and
maintenance of 1,0 mills/kwh.

Fuel and fuel processing costs, as discussed in Section III, Part E,
of this report, amount to 2.3 mills/kwh.

These costs thus add up as follows:

Fixed costs 5,1 mills/kwh
Operation and maintenance 1.0
Fuel and fuel processing 2.3

Total power cost 8.4 mills/kwh

It is probable that a reactor of this type could be built and would
operate safely for some time. The principal uncertainties concern the life of
the components and the ability to replace them in case of failure, These un-

certain points should be investigated as recommended in Section I before the

construction of a large reactor is undertaken.

 
- 132 -

 

The costs outlined above for the construction and operation of the
reference design reactor are predicated on obtaining favorable results from
a development program aimed at removing these uncertainties; with this pro-

vision they are believed to be as realistic as is feasible at this time.
