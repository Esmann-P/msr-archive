Urenium hexafluoride was prepared by the direct combination of
irradisted weanium metal with elemental fluorine and subsequently de-
contaminated by adsorption, filtration, and sublimation on a laboratory

scale.
__ © = 0

2.0 Introduction

Early in project history, a dry fluorinmation method(1s6) was considered
for separating wranium from fission products, plutonium, and other trans-
uranic elements. This method consisted of converting uranium to the hexa-
flueride and effecting the separation by distillation; however, it was
necessary to place the major effort on other processes which would require
less development time. It now seems desireble to make a thorough evaluation
of flmorination methods since they offer the following advantages over the
present wet processes: (1) smaller equipment with few or no moving parts
is required; (2) the waste volume is minimized since fluorine is the only
major chemical used; (3) fission products are obtained in a concentrated
form meking them easily recoverable; (4) the uranium is recovered as UFg
which requires a small storage volume and which is the feed material for the
isotopic separation plants; (5) it may be possible to process short cooled
material, thus reducing the uranium inventory requirements. There are two
outstending limitations to this type process: (1) the high cost of fluori-
nating agents and (2) the danger involved in handling volatile radioactive
materials.

Before a dry fluorination process for decontaminating uranium and plu-
tonium may be seriously considered, the actual separations obtainable mst
be demonstrated. Fluorination, copper adsorption, Alundum adsorption, fil-
tration, and resublimation were investigated as methods of separating uranium
from plutonium and fission products. These serve as preliminary studies

upon which a future program can be based. 2
lL] -7- ORNL- 980

3.0 Summery

The plutonium content of UFg prepared from uranium metal irradiated
335 days in the ORNL pile and cooled 30 months was reduced to<l Pu
ot/m/mg U by passing the UFg through a bed of Alundum, and then either
filtering or resubliming the product. Fission product beta activity in
the same material was reduced to 1 - 50 cts/m/mg U by filtering and re-
subliming the UFg.

Alundum adsorption was the most effective means of removing plutonium
from UF» giving separation factors of 13-96 and rendering that plutonium
passing through the bed non-volatile so it could be removed by filtration
or resublimation. Plutonium separation factors for the other steps were:
fluorination; 1.1 - 2.4; copper adsorption, 1.1 - Th; filtration not pre-
ceded by Alundum adsorption, 1.4 - 4; and resublimation not preceded by
Alundum adsorption, 1.3 - 290.

Filtration of UFg through barrier backing at 70°C was the most effective
method of removing the fission products and gave a beta decontamination
factor of 103. Because of the larger amount of ruthenium passing through
the filter at 230°, the fission produet beta decontamination factor was
only 300. Filtration, however, has two limitations: (1) it does not remove
volatile fission product fluorides, and (2) the barrier backing cannot be
satisfactorily dried after washing it free of plutonium and fission products.

Other beta decontamination factors were: resublimation, 12-330; fluorination,
SE -8- ORNL~980
Summary (continued)
2-133 Alundum adsorption, 1.4; and copper adsorption, 1.1.

Uranium losses were 1 - 3% for Alundum adsorption, 1 - 24% for resubli-
mation, end 0.3% for fluorination, copper adsorption, snd filtration. The
losses in Aluadum and resublimation may be reduced by improved operating
techniques,

The progrem proposed for the immediate futures includes (1) a survey of
other methods of proparing UFg from uranium metal, (2) a study of adsorption
techniques for rsmoving plutonium from TFS, and (3) an investigation of

fractional distillation for removing the volatile fission product fiunorides

from UFg.

k.0 Preparation of UFg from Ursnium Metal

Uranium wetal may be converted to uranium hexafluoride by several dif-
ferent methods. The metsl may be reacted with hydrogen to give uranium
hydride which cam then be reacted with szhydrous HF to glve ur, 3 ), This
UF), is then reacted with flucrine to produce UFg.

Uranium metal reacts with the interhalogens, ClF3 ard BrF3, to give
uraniue hexafluoride. Uranium may alse be combined directly with elemental
fluorine to produce ure?) . Theee various methods have certain advantages
and disadvantages which will not be discussed here. The direct combination
of fluorine with uranium was used to produce UFg in these laboratory experi-

ments because of its convenience ard not because it was felt to be superior

10 the other procedures.
ccm i ORNL- 980

4.1 Fluorinetion Equipment and Procedure
Fluorine was transferred from cylinders through a bed of sodium

fluoride to remove HF and then through a monel, Hoke needle valve and a
glass rotameter into the fluorinator (Figure 1). The fluorinator was a
cup made from a 2 inch piece of 1-1/2 inch nickel tubing (Figure 2). The
cup was placed in a stand fabricated from a stainless steel flange and
stainless steel pipe. The fluorinator top was a disc of nickel sheet with
a fluorine inlet and a UFg outlet. This assembly was sealed between stain-
less steel flanges using an aluminum wire gasket. A conical electric heater
was used to bring the reactor and uranium metel up to temperature.

The aluminum jacket was removed mechanically from a 40 - 250 gram
piece of slug irradiated in the ORNL pile. The oxide film was removed in
nitric acid and then the uranium was thoroughly dried and placed in the
Fluorinator. After evacuating the equipment; the temperature was raised
to 300-350°¢ and 20 ml/min of fluorine wes fed to the reactor. A sharp
rise in temperature gave evidence that the reaction had started. The ex-
ternal heat was then removed, and the fluorine flowrate was increased to
about 250 ml/min. The temperature rose to about 400°C and gradually dropped
to 300°C. When fluorination was nearly complete, a rise in temperature of
150-200°C in a few seconds indicated that only a small amount of unreacted
" metal remained. After the reaction subsided, external heat was applied to
raise the temperature to 500°C for 30 minutes before stopping the fluorine

flow. This procedure removed the last traces of metal and Tower fluorides.

“Sena,
a -10- ORNL- 980

 

Fluorination Equipment and Procedure (continued)

 

The UFg produced was passed through adsorbers and/or filters to effect
decontamination and finally condensed in traps cooled in dry ice and tri-
chlorethylene (Figure 1). Gases passing through the cold trap were sent
to a soda lime trap and vented to the hood exhaust.

After fluorination was complete, the equipment was evacuated and swept
free of fluorine by means of nitrogen. The fluorinator was dissolved in

nitric acid, apd an aliquot of this solution was wed for analyses.

L.,2 Fluorination Results

 

The results obtained for the fluorination of uranium metal irradi-
ated 335 days and cooled 30 monthe are presented in Table 1. From 4 to 20%
of the plutonium remained in the reactor, while only 0.0006 - 0.08% of the
uranium remained behind. Gross B, Gross 7, Ru B, TREB, CsB, and Srp decon-
tamination factors were all within the range of 2 - 13.

The higher uranium losses in experiments 1 and 14% were a result of in-
complete fluorination due to too short a heating period in a fluorine atmos-
phere after the reaction had subsided. The high values for the fission pro-
duct decontamination factors and plutonium hold up in Experiments 1, 2, and
3 resulted from increased reactor size and the uneven temperatures in the
reactors. Since the only fission products present form non-volatile or only
slightly volatile fluorides, the main reason for the low and inconsistant

decontamination factors was solid entrainment in the gaseous UF.

IO —
Gass: -11- ORNL- 980

Fluorination Results (continued)

 

In experiments 7, 14; 16, and 17, the reaction was started by first
filling the equipment with nitrogen instead of evacuating it. As a result,
the plutonium remsining in the reactor was 30-40% instead of 4 - 20%. The
reason for this difference 1s not understood; however, a test (Exp. 18) was
made to determine plutonium hold up when the equipment was first evacuated
and the uranium then fluorinated with a mixture of 55% nitrogen and 45%
fluorine. The plutonium remaining in the reactor in this case was only 10%.
Ag yet no method is known for keeping all the plutonium in the reactor nor
for removing it all by volatilization when fluorine gas is the fluorinating
agent.

The direct fluorination was carried out at a rate of about 20 grams of
uranium converted per hour. This rate was controlled quite easily by regu-
lating the fluorine flowrate. There was little or no reaction noted between
uranium metal and fluorine at temperatures below 300°C, and additional heat
was needed at the end of the reaction to fluorinate the last traces of

uranium metal and intermediate fluorides to UFg-

5.0 Adsorption of Fission Products and Plutonium

 

Since PuFg has almost the same vapor pressure as ws), its separation
from uranium by fractional distillation would be difficult and some other

method; such as adsorption; for effecting the separation would prove to be
——— -12- ORNL- 980

 

Adsorption of Fission Products and Plutonium (continued)

 

of considerable value. Previous work showed that plutonium hexafluoride is
less stable than UFg since the plutonium plated out on copper connecting
lines in the experimental epparatus(5), Adsorption on copper and Alundum
were tested and copper was found to be partially effective and Alundum com-
pletely satisfactory for removing plutonium from UFg. Neither the copper nor
the Alundum removed enough of the Gross B activity from the UFg to be of
value for a deconbamination procedure.

Graphite and activated calcium sulfate wers found to react with UFg at
100°C and so were not tested further. Sodium fluoride and UFg form an inter-
molecular compound which decomposes to give fluorine when heated. Since UFg
cammnot be removed from this compound by sublimation, sodium fluoride was not

considered as an adsorbing medium to remove the plutonium.

5.1 Adsorption on Copper

Three types of copper traps were used to adsorb plutonium: (1)
a coil of 1/4 inch tubing 3 feet long, (2) a "U" tube 9 inches high made
from 1-1/8 inch diameter tubing and packed with copper turnings, (3) cylin-
ders 2 inches in diameter and from 3 to 15 inches long (Figure 3). The
stream of gaseous uranium hexafluoride from the reactor was passed through
these vessels which were heated to 70-80°C in a water bath. After the ex-
periments were completed, the traps were washed with dilute nitric acid to
removed the plutonium, uranium, and fission products.

jl
J -13- ORNL- 980
Adsorption on Copper (continued)

The three feet of copper tubing removed 27% of the plutonium while the
trap packed with copper turnings removed 70% of the plutonium.

In the experiments using the 2 inch diameter copper traps, the amount
of plutonium held up was proportional to the length of the traps (Table 2)..
This increase of adsorption may be due to the increase of surface area,
increase of contact time, or both. The plutonium hold up for the 3-1/4 inch
trap was 21%, for the 7-1/2 inch trap was 57%, for the 9 inch trep was 98.7%,
and for the 15 inch trap was 92.2%. The high value for the 9 inch trap is
not explained. The results indicate that the last trace of plutonium may be
difficult to remove by means of adsorption on copper.

The fission product decontamination factor over these traps was negli-
gible (about 1.1). The uranium hold up was small (£0.3%) except when the
copper adsorption was preceded by condensation and resublimation as in
Experiment 12. This high loss of 8% may either be due to reduction of UFg
during the first condensation or to an inadequate sweep out of the equipment

after resublimation.

5.2 Adsorption on Alundum

 

Chips from Alundum crucibles were placed in a nickel tube 1 inch
in diameter and 9 inches long (Figure 4). The bed was heated to 100°C in
a tube furnace, and the gaseous UFg stream from the fluorinator was passed
through the Alundum. For analytical purposes the plutonium, wanium, and

fission products were removed from the Alundum by elution with 30% nitric acid.

m—————
m— ~1- ORNL- 980

 

Adsorption on Alundum (continued)

The Alundum bed removed 92-99% of the plutonium (Table 3). The plu-
tonilum passing through was thought to be non-volatile since it could be
easily removed by filtration (Experiment 22, Table 4) or by resublimation
of the UFg (Experiments 20 to 21, Table 5). The uranium loss on the
Alundum was 1-3%, and the fission product decontamination factors were only

about 1.4%.

6.0 Filtration of Uranium Hexafluoride

During early experiments a considerable quantity of fission products
was carried over from the fluorinator to the cold trap. This suggested
that solid particles were entrained in the gas since all the fission pro-
ducts present formed non-volatile or only slightly volatile fluorides.
Barrier backing tubes were used as a laboratory tool in determining whether

or not the activity and plutonium carry-over was due to entrainment.

6.1 Filtration Equipment and Procedure

 

A nickel; barrier backing filter tube 1/2 inch in diameter and 5
inches long was fitted with nickel ferrules. One end of the tube was closed
and the other end was flanged. This assembly was sealed into a nickel tube
(1"D x 8") by the use of heavy flanges and a double gasket arrangement
(Figure 5). A thermocouple well extended through the end plate flange to
the center of the barrier backing tube. The inlet and outlet for the fil-
ter consisted of 1/4 inch brass tube fittings silver soldered into the ends

of the case.

rn

rttr——
any -15- : ORNL- 980
Filtration Equipment and Procedure (continued)

Uranium hexafluoride was passed through the barrier backing at 70 - 225°C.
After filtration was complete, the barrier backing and ferrules were dissolved
in concentrated nitric acid, and the case was washed with dilute nitric acid.

Thess solutions were analyzed for gross B, plutonium, and uranium.

6.2 Filtration Results and Discussion
When the uranium hexafluoride came directly from the fluorinator,

the plutonium hold up on the filter was 30 - 75% and was not a function of
temperature in the range of 70°C to 230°C (Table 4). Only 0.01 - 0.15% of
the uranium remained on the filter. The high value of 3.7% in Experiment
14 may have been caused by incomplete nitrogen sweeps of the equipment after
the reaction was completed. The gross p decontamination factor was 103 when
the filter was operated at 70°C and 300 when the temperature was 220 - 240°C.
The only individual fission product decontamination factor that was sub-
stantially affected by temperature was that for ruthenium. At 70% » the Rug
decontamination factor was 200-500, and at 225% it was only 15. In general,
the decontamination factors for Csp, Srl, and TRER were slightly greater
than 103.

When filtration was preceded by resublimation, the filtration showed
little improvement in decontamination since the activity was too low for

accurate analysis (Exp. 19).
Sen -16- ORNL~-980
Filtration Results and Discussion (continued)

 

When the filter was used after an Alundum adsorber (Experiment 22), <1
Pu 0 ct/m/mg U passed through the filter and<U.0l%f the uranium stayed on
the filter. The fission product decontamination factors were of the same
order as for filtration of uranium hexafluoride coming directly from the
fluorinator.

Since no way is known to removed plutonium, uranium, and fission pro-
ducts from the barrier backing except by washing; it is recommended that fil-
tration of this type be used only as a laboratory tool and not be considered
for large scale operation. After washing barrier backing, it is very dif-

ficult to dry it thoroughly enough to pass UFg and Fs through it again.

T.0 Resublimstion of Uranium Hexafluoride
Simple batch sublimations were made to determine their effectiveness in

further decontzminsting UFg from fission products and plutonium.

7.1 Sublimation Equipment snd Procedure
Uranium hexafluoride was condensed in copper traps of various sizes 3

the trap most used being a cylinder 3 inches in diameter and 12 inches high.
To carry out a resublimation, the trap containing uranium hexafluoride was
placed in a water bath and heated to 90°C. The uranium hexafluoride ‘wag
volatilized and passed through a copper connecting line to a similar trap
placed in a bath of dry ice-trichloroethylene. A reasonable length of time
was allowed for the sublimation to take place, since there was no convenient

method of determining when it was complete. No nitrogen or fluorine sweeps
ac
Pep) -17- ORNL- 980

were made to remove the last traces of UFg.

7.2 Resublimation Results and Discussion
The results for batch resublimation varied considerably for two
reasons: (1) the resublimation was crude and often incomplete, and (2)
the previous treatment of the uranium hexafluoride varied widely.

The only fission products present form non-volatile fluorides which
must have been carried into the cold trap by entrainment. The resublimstion
should serve primarily to remove the uranium hexafluoride gas from these
solids. Since the distillations were crude, the amount of solid entrain-
ment varied and gave a wide range of decontamination factors. Gross B
decontamination factors were 12-330 (Table 5). For resublimation preceded
by filtration, the amount of activity present was so small that the gross
Bp decontamination factors could not be determined.

Plutonium decontamination factors over the resublimation step were
probably dependent upon both the entrainment phenomenon and the adsorption
of the volatile plutonium on the copper walls. Resublimation removed 80-
100% of the plutonium.

Uranium losses varied widely due to incomplete sublimation and sweep

out of the equipment.

8.0 Overall Results
Fluorination, copper adsorption, Alundum adsorption, filtration, and
resublimation procedures were combined in various ways to study the separation

ARERR
 

ud -18- ORNL- 980

Overall Results (continued)

of plutonium sud fission products from uranium metal irradiated 335 days
in the ORNL pile and cooled 30 months. The overall procedure and results
for various experiments are given in Table 6. Purities of the uranium
hexafluoride products are given in Table 7.

The most effective removal of fission products was made in the ex-
periments involving a filtration step. The overall gross 8 decontamination
factors varied from 3 x 103 to greater than 10% and the products contained
1 - 50 B cts/m/mg U. Experiments containing a resublimation but no fil-
tration were less effective in removing fission products. Gross p decon-
tamination factors were 230 to 1.4 x 103 with a corresponding higher activi-
ty in the product. The one experiment (No. 1) which used only fluorination
and copper adsorption gave a gross p decontamination factor of only 12.

The most effective and only satisfactory removal of plutonium was
made in experiments using Alundum adsorption. In these experiments (Nos.
20, 21, 22) the plutonium decontamination factors were 6 x 103 to 6 x 10t
and the uranium product contained< 0.5 plutonium ct/m/mg U. In all the
other experiments,plutonium decontamination varied widely; however, large
copper adsorbing surfaces tended to increase the decontamination factors.

Uranium losses for all the experiments were quite high. These losses
were explained under the various sections in this report dealing with the
individual operations. It may not be possible to reduce the uranium loss
of 1 - 3% on the Alundum adsorber; however, by improved operating techniques

the other losses can be reduced to <0.1%.

9.0 Recommendations

The results of the experiments presented in this report serve primarily
as a guide to further investigations. There are many problems remaining to
be solved and the following recommendations deal only with those which

should be studied in the immediate future.

9.1 Preparation of Uranium Hexafluoride
A thorough investigation of various methods of converting wranium
metal to UFg is needed. From this study should come the optimum procedure

from the view point of safety, ease of operation, and economics.

9.2 Adsorption Techniques
A more complete survey of adsorbing media for removing plutonium
and of elution methods is needed. Design information should be obtained

for the most promising adsorbers.

9.3 Distillation Studies
A program to determine the relative volatilities of various fission
product fluorides is now in progress. Determination of the optimum distil-

lation methods, and testing on a laboratory scale should be carried out.
nd -20- ORNL- 980

9.4 Phase Diagram

Solubilities of the fission product fluorides in uranium hexa-
fluoride should be obtained. Phase diagrams involving Br, ’ CIF, , and
HF will also be needed if these materials are to be used in the fluoride

process.

9.5 Filtration
At pregent, filtration seems to be valuable only as a laboratory
tool. Filtration in large scale operations is not desirable due to dif-
ficulties of washing the filter free of plutonium and fission products and
then drying so it can be reused. At this time no further work need be

done on this procedure.

9.6 Equipment Development
Special equipment and samplers are needed to study all of the
previously mentioned problems. Development and testing of this equipment
can best be carried out along with the investigations for which the equip-

ment is needed.
