FOREWORD

- The Atomic “Erergy Commission requires that a Reactor Hazards Summary

Report be submitted and approved by the Advisory Committee on Reactor Safe-

guards prior to the operation of a new reactor or the modification of an
existing reactor in order to determine, and thus assure, the safety of the
Commission's various reactor projects. In accordance with USAEC-OR-8L401,
Reactor Safety Determination, this report describes the hazards that may.
conceivably be associated with the Aircraft Reactor Test. All possible

types of hazards are described as well as the extent to which thesé hazards

have been evaluated and considered in the design and proposed operation of
the reactor.

The bulk of this ‘report was prepared by the authors, with the assist-
ance of the staff members of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project who
are associated with the Aircraft Reactor Test. In particular, W. R. Grimes
and W. D. Manly provided the portions of the report pertaining to chemical
and metallurgical problems, respectively, and E. R. Mann prepared the mate--
“rial on reactor controls. In addition, considerable assistance has been
solicited from seversl groups outside the project, including Robert F. Myers
and R. D. Purdy of the Oak Ridge Office of the U. S. Wegther Bureau and
T. J. Burnett of the ORNL Health Physics Division. £

ATRCRAFT REACTOR TEST

1. TNIRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

The succesful completion of da program of !periusits, ineluding the
Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE), has demonstrated the high probability
of producing militarily useful aircraft nuclear power plants employing re-
flector-moderated circulating-fuel reactors. Consequently, an accelerated
program culminating in operation of the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART) is under
way. In order to adhere to the compressed schedule of the accelerated pro-
gram, it is essential that the Atomic Energy Commission approve the 7500 Area
in Oak Ridge as the test site by February 15, 1955. This report summarizes
the hazards associated with operating the contained 60-Mw reactor of the ART
at the proposed Oak Ridge test site.

Descriptions are given of the reactor, reactor cell, test site, reactor
controls, and. opérating plan, prior to presentation of the hazards consider-
ations. The hazards are classified into three major categories: 1) acci-
dents with an appreciable probability of occurring, 2) accidents causing
rupture of the pressure shell, and 3) accidents causing rupture of the re-
actor cell, Category (1) accidents would involve minor difficulties in the
integrity of the reactor system and would not result in injury to operating
personnel or the surrounding population. Category (2) accidents, which. are
extreme nuclear excursions, might be caused by and can eause major breaks in
the réactor assenbly, but due to the presence of the reactor cell which would
remain intact there would be no injury to operating personnel or other
people. * The causes of category (2) accidents are described in a general man-

® mer since it has been impossible to date to describe a specific series of

events that would lead to an extreme nuclear excursion. In the total facil-
ity destruction, category (3), the reactor and the reactor cell would be
ruptured to release the accumulated fission products, but this could only be
accomplished by means of extremely clever distribution of large quantities
of explosives by a saboteur or by a large aerial bomb. In the analysis the
most severe case has been presumed ; namely, that complete volatilization of
all of the fuel would occur. This is highly improbable since any such acci~

dent ‘would require a large amount of heat at a high temperature, and its oc~
currence wi {thout dispersion of much of the fuel in particulate formcseems to be
~ unlik In addition, quantities of other materials that would also be
| presen ould ‘appreciably increase ‘the total heat input required.

Da

The reactor of the ART is to be a  60-Mw reflector-moderated circu-~

lating-fuel sype whose basic design is ‘suitable for reactors to be used

in aircraft. The size and weight of the reactor and shield will conform

‘with aircraft requirements, and, insofar as possible in the limited time

available, the design of the important components will be based on concepts

satisfactory for airborne applications.

Operation of the ARE demonstrated that’ a higho ‘temperature ‘circulating-

fuel reactor could be built and operated and that materials and machinery for

satisfactory operation at elevated temperatures ‘had been developed. It show -

and the resultant self-regulatory characteristics of the reactor could be
achieved. In addition, it was found that most of the Xel3® was removed. ‘from

 

was only 3% of the normal equilibrium value.

 

The new princizle of design ‘introduced in the ART consists of circulat-

ing the fuel through the reactor in a single, thick, annular passage and
achieving the major portion of the moderation with a beryllium reflector
which will also serve as an important portion of the shield. With the re-
sulting reduction in ‘shielding requirements it has been possible to design
the ART reactor in such a way that the entire fuel system is contained with-
in a sufficiently small, shielded volume to provide a low-weight shield and
a useful ‘aircraft réactor. The purpose of the Aircraft Reactor Test is to

‘validate the ‘methods ‘of construction and the predicted operating character-

 

istics of “suc: a reflector-moderated circulating-fuel : resctor.

A ‘reactor ‘power of 60 Mw was selected because it is approximately the’
power that must be reached to demonstrate that the engineering problems are
solved and that the operating characteristics are satisfactory for the high-
er powered reactors to be used in high-altitude supersonic strategic bombers.
In addition, a reactor with a power level in the 60-Mw range will provide
sufficient power to fly radar picket ships, patrol bombers, and other desir-
able aircraft. For a power level sbove 60 Mw, the cost appears to be di-
rectly proportional to the power. Also it does appear that a thoroughly
satisfactory 200-Mw reactor can be built more quickly by first building a
60-Mw reactor and then following it with a 200-Mw reactor in which the
benefits of the experience gained with the 60-Mw reactor will have been
incorporated.

The design of the ART envisions an essentially spherical reactor in”
which the beryllium moderator will be lumped in a central island and in an
outer annulus (see Fig. 2.1, Sec. 2, this report). Two centrifugal pumps,
arranged in parallel, will circulate the fuel downward between the inner
beryllium island and the outer beryllium reflector and out of the bottom
of the core. The fuel will then turn and flow upward through the heat ex-
changer region, which is around the spherical core. From the heat exchanger
region the fuel will return to the pumps and will again be discharged down-~
ward into the core. The reactor heat will be transferred in the heat

exchanger from the fuel to the secondary coolant (NaK). The fuel will be
one of a number of fluoride salt combinations which have been shown to have
acceptable physical properties. In particular, the NaF-ZrF, -UF, fuel mixture
is known to be satisfactory. The mixture NeF-KF-LiF-UF), has some very de-
sirable’ properties and is under intensive investigation.

i&

Ain

Quite a variety of shielding arrangements has béen considered for the
ART. The most promising seems to be cone functionally the same as that for
an aircraft requiring a unit shield, namely, a shield designed to give 1 r/hr
at 50 ft from the center of the reactor. Such a shield is not far from being
both the lightest and the most compact that has been devised. It will make
use of noncritical materials that are in good supply, and it will provide use-
ful performance data on the effects on the radiation dose levels of the re-
lease of delayed neutrons and decay gammas in the heat exchanger, the gene-
ration of secondary gammas throughout the shield; etc. While the complica-
tion of detailed instrumentation within the shield does not appear warranted,

it will be extremely worthwhile to obtain radiation dose level data at repre-

sentative points around the periphery of the shield, particularly in the
vicinity of the ducts and of the pump. and expansion tank Teglon.

 

‘Several arrangements have bess bons idered as means for disposing of the

heat generated in the reactor. The most promising of these is one that re-

sembles a turbojet power plant in many respects. It will employ radiators
essentially similar to those suitable for turbojet operation. Conventional
axial flow blowers will be used to force cooling air through the radiators.
This arrangement will be flexible and as inexpensive as any arrangement de-
vised. It will give thermal capacities and fluid transit times essentially
the same as those in a full-scale aircraft power plant. It will also give
some very valuable experience with the operation of high-temperature liquid-
to-air heat exchangers that embody features of construction and fabricating
techniques suitable for aircraft use.

In an effort to minimize the 1iklihood of suportant troubles developing
during the course of the test, an extensive series of component development
tests has been initiated. These tests have been designed to establish sound
technigues for the fabrication ‘of pumps and heat exchangers and to provide
detail design information on such factors as clearances, etc. The operating
experience gained in the course of these tests should prove most helpful in
minimizing operating troubles with the ART and in diagnosing such troubles
as may develop. These component development tests include experiments with
a hot (high-temperature) critical assembly which will consist of the pump,
header tank, and core system envisioned for the full-scale reactor. The ex-
pensive pressure shell and heat exchanger will not be included in this hot

critical experiment.

+ Experience with the ARE has indicated the advisability of building, in
addition to the critical assembly, a complete reactor-pump-heat exchanger-
‘pressure shell assembly for operation as a component test in the experi-

  

~ mental engineering laboratory. In a structure as complex as this it is

felt that there will probably be a number of ‘mechanical problems of construc-
tion. Rather “than go to extreme and awkward lengths to try to correct these

"by reworking the first unit, it is to be built as expeditiously as possible

and operated simply as a high-temperature component test with no fissionsble
material. ‘The experience gained in fabricating and shakedown testing this
first assembly should not only prove invaluable in construction and operation
of the second ‘assembly for use with fissionsble material, but should actually

. lead to. an earlier operating date for the ART.

 

ma jor hazards would be much less serious than had at first been presumed.
Also, the use of circulating fuel with its high negative temperature coef-
ficient gives a reactor in which a nuclear explosion seems almost out of the

question. In order to operate the ART at Oak Ridge uhder the safest possible

conditions the entire reactor system, with the exception of the NaK-to-air

radiators, will be enclosed in a cell consisting of an immer tank within which
the reactor assembly will be installed and an outer water-filled tank. The
cell will thus provide a water-filled annulus around the reactor assembly.

The very compact installation envisioned results ina Very low investment in
sodium and NaK (about 1/20 of that required for the KAPL-SIR reactor designed

~ for the same power level). A relatively small amount of energy would be re-

leased by reactions involving the liquid metals, and therefore a correspond-
ingly small-diameter cell can be used. Ce

  
 

The cell with : a vater-fills a equate to absorb the

amounts of energy that could be released in an extreme reactor catastrophe.

It will be impossible for a fragment ejected from the reactor assembly by an
explosion to rupture the inner tank of the cell because the pressure shell
surrounding the reactor has been deliberately designed to yield at a pressure
of 1000 psi and the maximum velocity of a fragment ejected at this pressure
would be substantially below that required %o penetrate the cell wall.

The 60-Mw reactor test unit was designed originally to “be operated at
the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS) at Arco, Idaho. It was envision-
ed that the reactor could be pretested at Oak Ridge and then shipped to NRTS
for the nuclear tests. However, a survey disclosed that construction and
operation at NRTS would require at least six months longer than at Oak Ridge.
Delays would be occasioned by conducting a construction operation 2,000
miles away and any small difficulty that might arise in reactor operation
would be likely to introduce a major delay if that difficulty were not fore-
seen end plans to cope with it made in advance. No delay would be occa-

sioned by construction of the small reactor assembly cell for use at the Oak
Ridge site, and approval is being requested from the Atomic Energy Commission
for operation of the Aircraft Reactor Test in such a cell at the Oak Ridge :

p. THE SHIELDED REACTOR ASSEMBLY

Corrine

 

The reactor is to be of the circulating-fluoride-fuel, reflector- ~~
moderated type. It will employ sodium~cooled beryllium as the reflector-
moderator material and is designed to operate at 60 Mw. The reactor assem-
bly will include the pressure shell, reflector, fuel and sodium pumps, and
heat exchanger assemblies. The basic design is shown . in Fig. 2.1, a vertical
section through the reactor. A series of concentric shells, each of which is
a surface of revolution about the vertical axis , constitute the major portion
of the assembly. The two inner shells surround the fuel region at the center
(that is , the core of the reactor) and separate it from the beryllium island
and the outer beryllium reflector. The fuel circulates downward and outward
to the entrance of the spherical-shell heat exchanger that lies between the
reflector shell and the main pressure shell. The fuel flows upward between
the ‘tubes in the heat exchanger into the two fuel pumps at the top. From the
pumps, which operate in parallel, it is discharged inward to the top of the
annular passage leading back to the reactor core. The fuel pumps are sump-

© type pumps with gas seals. A horizontal section through the pump volute

region is shown in Fig. 2.2. A schematic diagram of the reactor system is

~ shown in Fig. 2.3.

Refledtor Moderator Cooling System

The reflector will be cooled by sodium circulated by two pumps at the
top of the reactor. The sodium will flow downward through passages in the
beryllium and back upward through the annular space between the beryllium
and the enclosing shells. The central beryllium island will be cooled in
a similar manner, except that the sodium will leave the bottom of the is-
land to be returned to the top of the reactor through cooling passages in
the main pressure shell. The sodium will return to the pump inlets through
smell torrodial sodium-to-NaK heat exchangers around the outer periphery of
the pump-expansion tank region. The sodium pump and heat exchanger sub-
assemblies will be positioned on either side of the fuel pump volute region.
The pipe from the sodium pump discharge will make & slip fit into the re-
flector sodium inlet tube. The leakage through this slip fit into the sodium
return passage will simply recirculate with no penalty other than a small
increase in the required pump capacity.

Pressure Shell

The Inconel pressure shell will constitute both the main structure of

‘the reactor and a compact container for the fuel circuit. The design has

been modified somewhat from that shown in Fig. 2.1 to make the shell con-
tinuous through the vicinity of the headers and thus give better continuity
of stress flow and & minimum of welding. Blisters made of l-in.-thick plate
welded to the outer surface of the shell between the RaK pipes will serve
both to reinforce that weakened region and to provide for sodium flow up
through the shell. The inner liner assembly of the pressure shell will con-
sist of a 0.75-in.-thick Inconel shell, a 0.125-in.-thick hot-pressed B,C

layer, and an inner 0. .062-1n. ~thick Tnconel can. Heat generated in the
pressure shell by the absorption of gammas from the fuel will be removed
by sodium flowing between the outer surface of the liner and the inper

surface of the pressure shell so that the pressure shell temperature will
be held close to 1200°F. A 0.062-in.-thick gap will provide ample flow

passage area for sodium to flow upward from the bottom of the island to

the top of the pressure shell. Transfer tubes there will direct the sodium
from the outer surface of the pressure shell to the sodium-to-NaK heat
exchanger inlets. The hot-pressed boron carbide blocks will be diamond-
shaped, with 60-deg angles at their vertexes, and they will have rabbeted
edges. This design makes it possible to cover a spherical surface with a
single block size and shape. To facilitate welding in the final assembly,
the pressure shell will be split circumferentially at both 1°S and 35°N
latitudes. By splitting the liner at 1°8 latitude, it will be easily ac-
cessible for welding, and the upper portion of the main shell can be lowered
into place : for the final - welding operations.

 

Heat Exchenger

The oherical shell fuel-to-NakK heat exchanger, which mekes possible
the compact layout of the reactor-heat exchanger assembly, is based on the
use of tube bundles curved in such a way that the tube spacing will be uni-
form, irrespective of latitude.l The individual tube bundles will terminate
in headers that resemble shower heads. This arrangement will facilitate
assembly because a large number of small tube-to-header assemblies can be
made leak-tight much more easily than one large unit. Furthermore, these
tube bundles will give a rugged flexible construction that will resemble
steel cable and will be ‘admirably ‘adapted to servieelin. which large amounts
of differential thermal expansion must be expected. |

Pumps

Two fuel pumps and two sodium pumps are located at the top of the
reactor. These pumps are similar, but the fuel pumps have a larger flow
capacity. In addition to pumping, the fuel pump will perform several other
functions. Most of the xenon and krypton and probably some of the other
fission-product poisons will be removed from the fluoride mixture by scrub-
bing it with helium as it is swirled and agitated in the expansion. tank.
The high swirl rate in the expansion tank is also desirable in that the
centrifugal field will keep the free surface of the fuel reasonably stable:
in maneuvers or in "bumpy" flight. The expansion chamber will also serve
as a mixing chamber for the addition of high~uranium-content fuel to the
main fuel stream to enrich the mixture and to compensate for burnup. Fluid
will be scooped from the vortex inh the expansion tank and directed into the
centrifuge cups on the backs of the impellers. Since considerably more fuel
will be scooped from the vortex than can be handled by the centrifuge, the

excess will be directed upward into the swirl pump where it vill be accelerated

and returned to the expansion tank. There it will help maintain a high
rotational velocity. A slinger located on the pump shaft above the swirl
pump will prevent fuel from splashing up into the annulus around the shaft
below the seal.

A number of other special features have been included in the pump
design to adapt it to the full-scale reactor shield. The pump has been de-
signed so that it can be removed or installed as a subassembly with the
impeller, shaft, seal, and bearings in a single compact unit. This assembly
will fit into the bore of a cylindrical casing welded to the top of the re-
actor pressure shell. A 3-in. layer of uranium just above a 1/2-in, layer
of B,C around the lower part of the impeller shaft will be at the same level
as the reactor gamma shield just outside the pressure shell. The space be-
tween the bearings will be filled with oil to avoid a gap in the neutron
shield. The pumps will be powered by d-c electric motors in order to provide
good speed control.

Shield

The shield for the reactor has some characteristics that are peculiar
to this particular reactor configuration. The thick reflector was selected
on the basis of shielding consideration. The two major reasons for using a
thick reflector are that a reflector about 12 in. thick followed by a layer
of boron-bearing material will attenuate the neutron flux to the point where
the secondary gamma. flux can be reduced to a value about equal to that of the
core ‘gamma radiation. "This thickness will also reduce the neutron leakage
flux from the reflector into the heat exchanger to the level of that from the
delayed neutrons that will appear in the heat exchanger from the circulating
fuel. An additional advantage of the thick reflector is that 99% of the
energy developed in the core will appear as heat in the high-temperature zone
included by the pressure shell. This means that very little of the energy
produced by the reactor must be disposed of with a parasitic cooling system
at a low temperature level. The material in the spherical-shell intermediate
heat exchanger is about T0% as effective as water for the removal of fast
‘neutrons; so it too is of value from the shielding stendpoint. The delayed
neutrons from the circulating fuel in the heat exchanger region might appear
$0 pose a serious handicap. However, thése will have an attenuation length

‘much shorter than the corresponding attenuation length for radiation from

hus, from “the outer surface of the shield, the intermediate heat
ger will appear as a much less intense source of neutrons than the
more’ deeply buried reactor core. The fission-product decay gammas from the
heat exchanger will be of ‘about the same importance as secondary ‘gammas from
the ber 11ium and the pressure shell.

  
 
 
 

   

: thick separates the hot reactor Pressure shell
hich is a layer of lead about 7 in. thick. The lead,
in turn, is surrounded by a 3l-in.~thick region of borated water. The slightly
pressurized water shield is to be contained in shaped rubber bags similar to
fitted aircraft fuel tanks. Cooling of the lead shield will be effected by

circulation of water through coils embedded. in the outermost portion of
the lead and through auxiliary coolers. The borated water shield will be
cooled by thermal convection of the atmosphere in the reactor assembly
cell.

 

   

ch component of the reactor 1 is ’ constructed it iil be el aned oo
and leak tested in the Y-12 area. The whole assembly is designed so that

leak testing can be carried out as the components are added, piece by piece.

Mass spectrographic techniques will be used for leak testing. The com-
pleted assembly of circulating-fuel and moderator-cooling systems can be
leak tested before it is moved to the site. All ‘thermocouples and other
instrumentation will be checked as the assembly proceeds. or

 

Assembly of the radiators, blowers, ‘Nak pumps; £111 and rain tanks,
and other auxiliary equipment will proceed concurrently with the assembly of
the reactor.at Building 7503. Cleaning and leak testing procedures will be
the same as those for the reactor. All instrumentation in the building will
be checked out, as far as possible, prior to installation of the reactor
package.

‘The reactor shield assembly (without water in the shield) will be moved
as a package from the Y-12 area to the T7503 building. After all connections
have been made, final leak ‘testing will be carried out.

The HaX system will be £illed with Nek ‘and, ‘with the heat ‘barrier ‘doors
closed, the NaK pumps will be started. A heat input of approximately 300 kw
will be attained by circulation of the NaK, and this energy in the NaK will
be used to preheat the reactor, The presence of leaks, if any, from the NaK
system to the fuel system will be determined at this time by a flame photo-
meter. In addition to the leak check, the circulation of NaK in the system
will permit the checkout of all instrumentation and the determination of the
system characteristics. After circulation for several hours, the NaK will
be sampled and analyzed for oxygen content. If the oxygen content is within

the capacity of the purification system, the NaK will be left in the system

for the remainder of the test; otherwise it will have to be replaced. If
the NaK is to be replaced it will be dumped hot in order to carry the oxide
with it.

The sodium system for cooling t ‘the berylliim will be Filled ext, ‘and,
finally, the fuel system will be filled with a barren fluoride mixture.
Circulation of the fluids in these circuits will permit final cleaning of
the systems, operational checks of instrumentation, and a determination of
the system operating characteristics. As with the NaK, samples will be
taken and analyzed for purity. The barren carrier will then be drained from
the fuel system and replaced with a fluoride mixture containing 80% of the
required uranium (as determined from the critical experiment).

The ARE facility, ORNL Building 7503, as noted in the ARE Hazards Sum-
mary Report, ig located at a site 0.75 mile southeast of the center of the
present ORNL area and about 0.24% mile northeast of the Homogeneous Reactor
Test (HRT) facility. This ARE location is near the center of Melton Valley
which is spproximately 4 miles long and 0.5 mile wide. With the exception of
the nearby HRT, this valley is unoccupied. Between the ARE site {elevation

840 £1) and Bethel Valley, which contains ORNL (elevation 820 ft), is Haw
Ridge which averages 980 ft in elevation. Within a radius of 1.9 miles, all :
the land is owned by the AEC and is already a security-controlled area. Within 1
a radius of 2. 3 ‘miles ‘there ig approximately 0.3 square miles of farm land :
that is not "AEC ‘owned or controlled. Additional information on the surrounding i
area and the natural characteristics of the site ‘is presented in Appendix A.

To modify th Building to accommodate the ART, it is planned that an

“addition to the &otith éhd will be constructed to effect a Oi-ft extension of
the present 105-ft long building. The ART shielded reactor assembly and ite
container will be installed within this addition to the ARE Building. Such an E
arrangement will permit the use of ARE services and facilities that exist in J
this installation whi >h has now served the purpose for which it was erected.

"For example, items such as the control room, offices, change rooms, toilets,

and possibly for underwater reactor disassembly work after reactor oper-
ation. Also, the truck door in the north wall of the ARE Building will
be enlarged to provide a large entry door to the ART area.

Field maintenance and laboratory ‘facilities will be installed in the
area east of the new bay and south of the low bay of the ARE. This area
and the old expérimental bay will be partitioned from the new bay with
about a 16-in.-thick solid, concrete-block shield wall. This wall will
not be erected until after placement of the upper sections of the reactor
assembly container. The only other major modification to the ARE facility
to accommodate the. ART will be that of modifying and equipping one of the
ARE experimental pits for underwater disassembly work on the reactor after
operation.

Reactor Cell

The cell designed for housing the reactor assembly is shown in

Fig. 3.4. As may be seen, the cell is to consist of an inner and an outer

tank. The heat dump equipment will be located outside the cell, but nearby.
The space between the two tanks will be of the order of 18 in. and will be
filled with water. The inmer tank will be sealed so that it can contain
the reactor in an inert atmosphere of nitrogen.at atmospheric pressure, but
it will be built to withstand presiures of 100 psi. The outer tank will be
merely.a water container. ’

 

 

The inner seine wil ve “epproximately ol to in | diameter With a straight
section about 11 ft long and a hemispherical bottom and top. The outer
tank, which is to be cylindrical, will be approximately 27 ft in diameter
and about 47.5 ft high. When the reactor is to be operated at high power, -
the space between the tanks and above the inner tank will be filled with
water so that in the event of an accident so severe as to cause a meltdown

of the reactor the heat given off by the decay gamma activity will be car-

ried off by the water. Since the heat transfer rate -to water under boiling
conditions would be exceedingly high (of the order of 320,000 Btu/hre £2)

“and since the thermal conductivity of the fluoride fuel is relatively low,
the water-side “temperature ‘of the inner tank will not exceed the water tem-
perature by more than 4OSF. The water capacity of the space between the
tanks together with the water in the reservoir above the inner tank (ap-
proximately 10 ft deep) will be of the order of 1,000,000 gal. Boiling of
=... the water in the annulus and ‘above the “inner tank will suffice to carry
off all the heat generated by “the “fission products after any accident with-
oo out any additional water ‘being supplied to the tank.

oo

 
 

will be “above floor grade. This portion

of ‘the tank, ‘as well as the top hemisphere of the inner tank, will not be
© ‘attached until completion of the reactor installation and preliminary shake-
down testing. Since the shielding at the reactor will be quite effective,

the space inside the tank will be shielded fairly well so that it will be
possible for a man to enter the inner tank through a manhole for inspection
or repair work, even if the reactor has been run at moderately high power.

The unshielded reactor assembly will weigh approximately 10,000 1b; the

lead gamma shield, approximately 30,000 1b; and the water in the shield, ap-
proximately 34,000 1b. The first two of these items can be handled conven-
iently with a 20-ton crane, while the borated water will be pumped. in after
the rubber tanks have been installed for ‘the water shisid.

The reactor assembly, with its aireraft-type shield, will be mounted
in the inner tank on vertical columns with the reactor off-center from the
vessel axis and about 6 ft above an open-grated floor. This positioning
will provide ‘the space needed for movement of the portable fluoride fuel and
sodium moderator coolant containers to their operating stations under the re-
actor. The off-center location will also serve to minimize the length of the

NaK piping.

The Nek and’ oftgas piping connected to the readtor will pass ‘through a
thimble-type passage or bulkhead in the double-walled cell. The openings
will be covered with stiff plates which will be welded to the tank walls.
The piping will be anchored to the inner plate and connected with a bellows-
type seal to the outer one. The volume within all bulkheads will then be
maintained at a pressure above that of the inner tank to prevent out-leakage

from the inner ‘tank. a.

A oubly-sealed junction panel for controls, instrumentation, and
auxiliary services will be installed through the tank below the building
floor grade as a part of another bulkhead to pass wires, pipes, tubes, etc.,
required for the circuits and systems. The various thermocouples, power
wiring, etc., will be installed on the reactor assembly in the shop and fit-
ted with disconnect plugs so that they can be plugged into the panel in a
short period of time after the reactor assenbly has been lowered into position
in the test facility. This will minimizé the amount of assembly work re-
quired in the field. ST Co

-, inner container to provide overhead crane service after placement of. the top.

Sufficient catwalks, ladders, and hoisting equipment will be installed within
the inner tank to ‘provide easy access for servicing all L equipment.

The control bulkhead in the cell will be Located so that the associated
control junction panel and the control tunnel will ‘extend to the auxiliary
equipment pit (formerly the ARE storage Pit). The pit and basement equip-

ment will include such items as the lubricating oil pumps and coolers,

borated shield water make-up and fill tank with a transfer pump, vacuum pump,
relays, switch gear, and emergency power supply. The reactor off-gas flow,
diluted with helium, will be piped through the Nak piping bulkhead to the

Heat Dump Systen

The vasic requirement of “the ART heat dump system is to provide heat
dump capacity equivalent to 60 Mw of heat with a mean temperature level of
1300°F in the NeK system. It has also seemed desirable that the ART heat
dump system should simulate the turbojet engines of the full-scale aircraft
in a number of important respects, such as thermal inertia, NeX holdup, and
fabricational uethods.,

Since ‘heat ‘dumps are required for" ‘use in heat exchanger test rigs, and
since ‘work of this character has already progressed to the point where the
cheapest, ‘most’ compact, and most convenient heat dump is currently proving
to be a round-tube and plate-fin radiator core, it is believed that this
basic type of heat transfer surface should prove both sufficiently reliable
and sufficiently well-tested to serve for the ART. The round-tube and plate-
fin radiator planned for the ART makes use of type 310 stainless steel clad

copper fins spaced 15 per inch and mounted on 3/16-1n.-0D tubes placed on

2/3- in. square centers. Individual radiator cores will have an inlet face.
2 ft square. Much infopiation has been obtained in tests of similar units.

BRE he ie

    

NeX wifi be eirculated through five separate systems. Four will pore

stitute the main heat dump system, while the fifth will be the moderator

heat dump system. In the main heat dump system a group of four fill-and-

drain tanks will be used, but these will not require the remotely operable
couplings desired for the sodium or fuel systems. The NaK will be forced
into the main cooling circuit by pressurizing the tanks. The 24 tube bundles
of the fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger will be manifolded in four groups of six
each. The NaK will flow from these tube bundles out to the radiators which
will be arranged in four vertical banks with four radiator cores in each bank.
The NaK will flow upward through the radiator bank to the pumps. A small by-
pass flow through the expansion tank will allow it to serve as a cold trap,
A filter to remove oxides will be placed in.the return line from the tank.

The moderator heat dump system will be essentially similar except that
its capacity will be about one-quarter that of one of the fowr circuits of
the main heat dump system. NaK will be circulated to the Na-to-NeK heat ex-
changer in the top of the reactor where the NeK will pick up from the
sodium the heat generated in the island and reflector. The NeK will pass.
to a small NaK-to-air radiator where it will be cooled and returned to the
pump suction. An expansion tank and by-pass filter will be ‘included, as in
the main NeK system. It is planned to have only drain and filter by-pass
throttle valves in the NeK systems, since the Nak will be drained if any
repairs are required. -

As ‘shown in Fig. 3.2, the NaK-t6-air radiators will be mounted in an
air duct close to the reactor cell. This duct traverses the _southwest cor-

ner of the building addition. The rediators will ‘be located at floor grade oo

over the Nex pipe-line pit. “Four axial-flow | blowers 11 force 300, 000 cfm
of air through the radiators and out through a 10-ft-dia discharge stack 78
ft high. Since the axial-flow blowers will stall and surge if throttled,
control can be best accomplished through by-passing a portion of the air

“around the radiators. This arrangement required only constant speed a-c

motors and simple duct work with a controllable louvre for by-passing. The
heat dump rate will be modulated by varying the number of blowers in oper-
ation. A set of counterweighted self-opening louvre vanes in the inlet or
discharge duct from each blower will prevent backflow through the blowers
not in operation. Thus each blower will be driven with an a-c motor inde-~
pendently of the others, and the heat dump capacity can be increased dn in-
crements of 25% from zero to full load. An additional 4 ft by 8 ft set of
controllable louvres will be mounted in such a way as to bleed air from the
plenum chamber between the blowers and the radiators to get vernier control
of the heat load.

Heat barriers mounted on either side of the radiators will be required
to minimize heat lossés during the warmup operations. Warmup will be accom-
plished by energizing the pumps and driving them at part or full speed.
Since approximately 400 hp must be put into the pumps in the NaK circuits,
this power will appear as heat in the fluid pumped as a result of fludd
frictional losses. A mechanical power input of LOO hp to the NaK pumps will
produce a heat input in the NeK system of approximately 300 kw. This should
be enough to heat the system quite satisfactorily with the radiator cores

‘blanketed to ‘prevent excessive heat losses. Relatively simple sheet stain-

less steel doors filled with 0.5 in. of thermal insulation when closed over
both faces of a radiator (64-242 inlet-face area) filled with 1100°F NeK will
give a heat loss of 30 kw.

Heat Toad ‘control for the’ 16w-pover range presents some problems. The
plenum chamber préssure with the 4 ft by 8 ft by-pass louvres wide open and.
one blower on will be about 0.5 in. H,0.- This will give a heat dump capa-
city of 3 Mw if all the radidtor hea barriers are opened. Lower heat
loads can be obtained by varying the number of heat barriers opened. Oper-

"ating the heat barrier doors against a pressure of O. 5 in. He (2.6 1p/£t8)
«should not be difficult.

ut. “This must be removed at a mean NaK circuit temperature of about

in the conduct of operations. It is believed that by removing the fuel

the radiation level can be cut for maintenance operations. Easy installa-

tion or removal of the fuel will also facilitate peprocessing the fuel or
"modifying the fuel composition. Should a reliable remotely operable coup-

ling not be developed in time, welded attachments will be made between the

a lift for raising the tank connection nozzle to the contact position within

the reactor shield.

‘Other requirements of the £111-and-drain Fon ben include provision for
accurate measurement of the quantity of fluid in the drain tank at all times
during either the filling or the draining operation. This is particularly
important in connection with reactor fuel systems because it is important’
that the exact amount of fuel in the reactor be known at all times.

. The shielding required for the fuel tank will be 10 in. of lead to re-
duce the dose to 1 r/hr at 5 ft from the tank one week after full-power
operation. The resulting shield weight for a T-ft3-capacity tank will be
about 15 tons. The lead shield required for the 1-ft2 sodium drain tank
will be 5 in. thick, and it will weigh approximately 2 tons.

Fill and drain systems for fuel or for sodium from the moderator circuit
will include provision for both preheat and the removal of decay gamma heat.
These functions will be carried out by diverting NaK from the radiator cir-
cuits and directing it through a jacket surrounding the drain pipe and
through colls in the drain tank.

i Off-Gas Disposal Systen

 

The design of the off-gas system was based on the pessimistic assump-

| tion that all the fission products will be given up to the off-gas system

as they are formed and will be swept out with 1000 liters of helium per
day. They will be passéd through a long charcoal-filled pipe designed so

that no more than 0.001 curie/seec of radioactivity will go up the stack.

About 4 Mw of the 60 Mw will appear as fission-product decay energy. Since
the design was based on all of the fission products being released to the
off-gas system, a decay of t7~*% was used in calculating the heat released.

The gases will be removed from the fuel in the expansion tank at the
top of the reactor and vented through a 1/4 in. Inconel line 20 ft long
to a 2-in. steel pipe 1050 ft long. The first 50 ft of this pipe will be
open, but the balance will be filled with activated charcoal. The gas

will exhaust from the charcoal bed to ‘the stack where it will mix with the
670,000 cfm of hot air from the radiators. On this basis, the holdup time
and heat generation for each component of the off-gas system will be as

 

follows:

Since about 0.5 Mw of heat will be given up by the fission products on
the charcoal, the limiting factor will be the heat transfer. Upon entering
the charcoal, the gas will be absorbed very rapidly, and the first few feet
of charcoal will soon rise in temperature to around LOOOF. The temperature
will start to decrease in less than 10 ft, and, -by the time the gas has passed
through about 100 ft of charcoal, the temperature will be down to near the
ambient temperature of the surrounding water.

A ‘by-pass’ line’ around’ the’ off-gas system’ is to be provided For use in
case there is a leak along the pipe in the trench. In such an event, the
reactor will be shut down and the gas will be vented into the reactor cell.
After a two-day holdup, & vent line will be opened directly to the stack.

This auxiliary vent line can also be nsed if fission-product gases leak from
any of the reactor components into the reactor cell. Monitrons will be pro-~

vided at suitgble locations in all gas lines. In the event that the off-gas
system is to be operated at a time when no power is being abstracted from the
reactor, the air from the blowers will be ducted around the radiators to
avold difficulties which would otherwise follow from cooling of the Nak.

4, como AND OPERATION

Control Philosophy

The early ORNL effort to develop the circulating-fuel type of aircraft
reactor was ‘motivated in part by a desirable control feature of such
reactors. “This feature is the inherent stability at design point of the
over-all power ‘plant that results from the negative fuel temperature coef-
ficgent of reactivity. In a power plant with this characteristic the
nuclear power source is a slave to the turbojet dopa vith a minimum of exter-

nal control devices. ’

 

This predicted master-slave relationship between the load and power
source was "verified by the ARE. Controlwise the power plant consists of
the nuclear source, ‘the heat dump (in the case of ART), and the coupling
between source’ “and sink (the NaK circuit). Control at design point can be
effected to some ‘extent by nuclear means at the reactor, by changing the
coupling (i.e., changing the NeK flow), or by changing the load (i.e., the
heat dump from the NaK radiators).

For the ART at design point the regulating rod will be used mainly for
adjusting the reactor mean fuel temperature. In particular, an upper tem-
perature limit will cause the regulating rod to insert until the fuel out-
let temperature does not exveed 1600°F. This limit will override any normal
demand for rod withdrawal. Furthermore a low NaK outlet temperature from
the heat dump ‘radiators will sutomatically decrease the heat load to keep
the lowest Nak temperature of the system at no less than 1050°F. This lower
temperature limit will override all other demands for power.

Critical experiments will be performed with “the system isothermal at
1200°F. This temperature ‘was chosen to increase the life expectancy of the
beryllium ‘moderator. The mean fuel temperature at design point will be

~14000F, thé moderator being held at 1200°F. Since the fuel temperature .

coefficient is 5 x 1072 per OF, 1.0% Ak/k will be required to raise the
‘mean fuel ‘temperature this 200%.

  

The “total worth of the regulating rod over its stroke will ve abot

ih 59 Ak Jk. In-addition to its use in changing the mean fuel temperature,
+ this amount of rod will supplement the fuel addition by solid pills (dis-
Loe gssed at the end of this chapter) in compensating for burnup and fission-
product poisoning.

  
 
 
  

 

om 20 to “Toop of design
which is the useful range for an aircraft power plant), a
manual change in load demand or in operating ‘temperature will be restricted
by the maximum rate at which the load can be changed or by the maximum
rate at which the regulating rod can be withdrawn, respectively. In the

design point power range the maximum rate of withdrawal of the regulating

rod will be obtained by adding Ak/k at the rate of 3.33 x 10™* per second.

This will raise the fuel outlet temperature at the rate of 12°F per second

until the meximum fuel outlet temperature of 1600CF is reached, at which
point the temperature limit will hold. In this range a permissible load

‘chéinge rate of one-half design point power in 1 min is comparable to the

requirements of engine performance for a nuclear-powered aircraft. Load

~ changes are effected by manual demand for changing the air flow over the

Nak radiators.

 

   

Control ‘of the ART is ‘Glassified in “three difrerent categories “oF”
operation: namely, (1) startup, (2) operation between startup and design
point, and (3) operation in the design point range. For the second and
third of these categories the nature of the reactor and power plant is so
different from that of conventional high flux reactors that control mist

be based on inherent characteristics of the reactor to a large extent rather

than on conventional reactor control art. There is no conventional art for
these categories with high flux reactors. Control at startup utilizes, in

- principle, old reactor control art with short-period "scrams? that are con-

ventional in. principle. Experimentation will take place primarily in the
startup and design-point regions. In the intermediate region between these

- two, little testing will take place. Consequently, operational procedure

will be followed to take the reactor from the low-level adequately control-
led region to the high level region in one simple manner. This procedure
will be assured by permissive instrument t interlocks that are described in

a following section of this chapter.

 

Floto hanbers and compensated ion chambers ii be {ated “beneath

the reactor shell between the fill and dump tenks and the reactor. The

region around the pipes between these tanks and the reactor will be filled

with moderator material, either Be or BeO, through which cylindrical holes
for théseé chambers will run radially out from the centerline of the system.
From four to six such holes will be available. Chamber sensitivities will
be adequate for the entire range ‘of nuclear operation.

The fuel expansion chamber is a key item in providing safety for the
ART. The fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity provides stability
for the system by the expansion of fuel from the critical region. Adequate
expansion volume will be available atiall times,

Scram System

A conventional scram system achieved by dropping poison rods into the
critical lattice will not be used with the ART. The reasons for elimina-
ting this feature are the following: IE ’

1. In the ‘design-point range described, analysis shows that lintting
the rate of rod withdrawal and the rate of load increase will limit the
period of the reactor when it is operating normally. A limited rate of

‘rod withdrawal and a limited rate of load increase near the design point

in the ARE gave a minimum period of about 10. sec. The : same technique will be
used on the ART.

Short periods; “of ‘the’ order of ‘1 sec, cen occur in the design-point
renge only in the event of structural failure. The total Ak/x required in

"the rod to override an increase resulting from such failure cannot be ob-

tained from one rod nor could such a rod, were it available, be inserted
fast enough to prevent a serious accident. The temperature coefficient will
react so rapidly “that it will limit the signal which would normally actuate
a scram, except for an extremely high rate of increase in reactivity. It
has not been possible to devise a control system that would react rapidly
enough in such cases.to prevent the accident. Therefore, in the design-
point region the conventional scram would be of little merit.

be used, but it will not ‘involve dropping the one control rod. The method
described below was proposed because the single-rod system lacks the safety
feature of a plurality of rods, as ordinarily found in conventional reactors.
The actuating signal will be a short period, a high flux, a manual screm, or
any of a number of failures in the system, and the signal will be supplied
through an auetion circuit in the conventional manner,

Essentially, the safety of the system lies in the procédure of adding
fuel in a subcritical external loading tank and forcing it against gravity
into the Fuel system. This will be done by pressurizing the loading tank
with helium through a valve which will fail closed. Two parallel helium
outlet “1ines from the loading tank to the off-gas system will fail open. All
Zero power tests and ‘measurements will bé made with the valve between the
loading tank and the reactor locked open, and the signal from the auction
circuit will’ actuate the solenoid in the helium-pressurizing system in the
manner “described ‘above.’ “Actually, two parallel dump lines, one to the fill-
and-drain tank and one to the emergency dump tank, will contain valves which
will be actuated simultaneously on the dump signal from the auction amplifier

- circuit. This ‘system has the merit that if too rapid addition of fuel to the

system causes a short period, reversal of the operation will reverse the period.

is sdded to the “system. "The helium system can be designed so that it will fail
safe, except for the case of a plurality of simultaneous failures comparable

 

in probability to the failure of a plurality of magnetic clutches all of which

simultaneously fail to open in the conventional rod-dropping reactor scram.

A rather close estimate of the critical concentration should be avails
able from the hot critical experiment so that 80% of the uranium will be in
the fuel at the time of the ART startup. The final 20% of the required
uranium will be added in steps. After each uranium addition the fuel will
be forced from the £ill tank up into the reactor by means of helium pres-
sure. The scram circuit will be available 5 88 described previously. The
rod will be inserted for each step,” 8 given amount of uranium will be added,
the rod will be slowly withdrawn, and a count will be taken on the fission
chambers to determine the subcritical multiplication as a function of uranium
‘concentration. A polonium-beryllium source of approximately 15 curies strength

   

will be installed in the central island of the reactor to provide neutrons

for startup.

Operation ‘Between Startup end Design Point oo

-30-

Before beginning the critical experiment, the speed of the pumps will
be set so that the flow through the core will be about 50 gpm. Thus over
one-half the delayed neutrons will be available for control while going
critical. The whole system is to pe isothermal. at 1200°F

 
        

Control for zero power “operation (rod calibration, Fuel enrichment,”
determination of the temperature coefficient, etc.) will be manual with the
maximum rod ‘speed providing a rate of change in ak/k of 3.33 x 10-% per
second. ‘Overriding the manual rod withdrawsl will be a 5-sec period rod
reverse and a l-sec period fuel dump by relieving the helium pressure in
the loading tak, as described shove. -

“A nolding servo system will be ved at zero power for experiments re-
quiring constant neutron flux. Operation with the servo system will be
essentially the same as that for the ARE. Limits will be maintained on the
rod speed, and overrides will be maintained on period and. temperature.

   

: ‘Since most of the nuclear data will have been obtained from the hot
critical experiment, the low power operation will be held to a minimum.
After going critical, the reactor will be leveled out manually at about
10 to 100 watts. The pumps will be stopped, and the reactor will be al-
lowed to go on a period. This will be a check on the effects of flow rate
on the reactivity contribution of the delayed neutron fraction. When the
power level has reached about 1 kw, the pumps will be started and the rod

will be inserted to drive the reactor suberitical. Sufficient uranium will

be added to give sbout 0.5% excess reactivity. The pumps will again be
stopped and the reactor will be brought to about 10 watts; the rod will be

- withdrawn; and the reactor will be allowed to go on a period until a level

of 1 kw is reached. The pumps will again be started, and the rod will be

- inserted to drive the reactor subcritical. This procedure will be repeated

to give 2 or 3 calibration points on the regulating rod. Since a similar

- rod will have been carefully calibrated in the hot critical experiment, only
8 Tew rough check ‘points will be necessary.

cS . The power level will ‘then be ‘elevated to about 10 kw and 1eveled out’ |

: mammally with the rod. At this power level, the shielding and off-gas

systems will be checked out thoroughly without great hazard to personnel.
The pump speed will then be increased so that the fuel flow rate will be
increased from 50 gpm to the design flow rate of 1200 gpm. This will cause
a decreage in reactivity of the order to O. 2% Ak, and the rod will be with-
drawn accordingly. The ‘reactor will then be ready to deliver power.

  

The negative fuel ‘temperature coefficient of the ART makes ménual con- |
trol mandatory in taking the reactor from zero power to some power at which
the temperature coefficient provides stability while the reactor gets its ~

With all loop flow ‘rates at est polat and the reactor at about 10
kw and isothermal at 1200°F, the regulating rod will be withdrawn until
the reactor is on a positive period. This period will gradually increase
until it becomes infinite end finally negative because of the temperature
coefficient.” ‘Mesnwhile, both the log N and micromicroammeter readings will
go through a ‘maximum. This maximum log N reading will provide the signal
to permit opening of the heat barrier doors to the NeK radiators. Natural
convection from the radiators with these doors open will be about 300 kw.
Accordingly ‘if these doors are opened when the log N reading reaches this
value, the temperature coefficient will always suffice to provide regula-
tion and stability, provided the rate of load demand above this minimum

even though the reactor may be subcritical at the time the doprs are

barriers, “there is only one procedure for getting permission. -

Design-Point Operation

 

‘With the reactor at about 300 kw (estimated from the power extracted
by opening the heat barrier doors) the blowers will be started and heat
will be extracted from the NaK, which, in turn, will extract heat from
the fuel. The reactor will be leveled out at 3, 15, 30, and 60 Mw. A
heat balance will be obtained at each level of extracted power vs nuclear
power. The operation of all components will be observed at each power level.

‘below the minimum temperature of . 1150°F, + The reactor will then be operated

Xenon will be removed continuously from the fuel by helium injected
into the pump chamber and escaping in the swirl chamber. The rate of re-

The total burnup is equivalent to about 2.5% Ak/k. The capacity of
the pill machine will be such as to hold no more pills than that amount

‘equivalent to 2.5% Ak/k. Accordingly, the rod will always be capable of
overriding any fuel addition. Furthermore, the rate at which successive
"pills can be added will be much less than that which can be effectively ean-

celled by movement of the control rod. Compensation for burnup and fission-
product poisoning can be accomplished by both control rod withdrawal for

fine. control and by fuel enrichment for coarse control.

 

The best choice Por a pill material is the cémipotind Te. SFG. “This was =

used as the enriched fuel component for the ARE test. Its melting point is
approximately 1160°F, and its solid density at 1000°F is about 4.9 g/em3.
It is composed of approximately 60% U235, 11% Na, and 29% F (by weight).
Several pill dispenser (and container) designs have been prepared that are
based on the use of pills 1/2 in. in diameter by 1/4 in. thick. Pills of
this size have a volume of 0.80 em3, they weigh 4.0 g, and they contain about
2.4 g of U235. The rate of pill addition required to maintain a constant
reactor fuel inventory will thus be 0.5 pill per Mwd of operation. For
operation at’a power level of 60 Mw, this will require the addition of 30
Pills per day, or a total of about 1200 pills for the 1000 hr of full-
power operation.

An attempt has been made to envision as many hazards as possible that
might occur during the course of the operation of the Aircraft Reactor Test.
Included in this chapter, therefore, is a discussion of. the normal radi-
ation hazards, the hazards resulting from operational or equipment failures,
and fluid leaks, as well as the nuclear and chemical hazards peculiar to the
cycle. The dispersion of airborne activity, either from the ‘off-gas system
or following a hypothetical accident in which all the fuel is volatilized,
is described in the following chapter, "Dispersion of Airborne Activity."

The radioactivity of the ART will be inherently confined by the nature
of the design and materials in such a manner that the uncontrolled disper-
sion of the activity outside the reactor cell will be virtually impossible.
Consequently, the hazard from most failures will be negligible, since the =
only action required will be dumping of the fuel; the activity would not
even be released to the cell. Furthermore it is shown that while a hypo-
thetical nuclear accident could rupture the reactor pressure shell, the reac-

tor cell would remain intact and the accident would be safely contained.

 

de in

Some consideration has been given to cases in , which the reactor cell,
as well as the pressure shell, would be ruptured, and the resulting subse-
quent dispersion of activity has been examined in detail, It is believed
that such an accident could occur only as the result of aerial ‘bombing or
sabotage.

Radiation Dose levels

The radiation dose levels to be expected at representative stations at
the facility have been estimated for a variety of conditions and have been
tabulated in Table 5.1. The shielding assumed for these estimates was the

following: (1) the primary airchaft-type reactor shield designed to give
1 rem/hr at 50 £t at full power, (2) the reactor cell steel and water walls,

(3) 16 in. of concrete block stacked around the reactor cell to a height of
10 ft, (4) 16. in of concrete block stacked between the reactor room and

the maintenance shop and between the reactor room and the former ARE main
test ‘bay, (5) concrete block stacked around and on top of the air duct for

the NaK~to-air radiators in such a way that the equivalent of 12 in. of
rete will be imposed along any radial line extending outward from the

   

The Souhete blocks to be. stacked ‘around. the . periphery of the reactor
‘room “and “around the air duet and radiators are intended to provide

“shielding in case a fuel leak developed either into the reactor cell or

into the Nak systems.

oe As may be ‘seen from Table 5. 1, 3 ‘the reactor will be adequately shielded
so that the control room operators will receive much less than 1 rem/hr
even with 1% of the fuel in the radiator and much less than 0.1 rem/hr
even if the pressure shell is ruptured. The dose rates would be consider-
ably higher, however, if it were postulated that the reactor cell was also
ruptured, in which case the activity would no longer be confined. This ex
treme situation is considered in the following chapter; "Dispersion of
Airborne Activity.” so .

 

typical Operational ond gus 1 sigaent Failures

 

There ax iy inber of operational or equipment failures that can be
envisioned in a system as complex as the Aircraft Reactor Test. In this
section are listed those failures which would have the greatest effect on
the operation and which therefore seem to offer the greatest hazards. For
each failure some probable causes are given, as well as the result, and the
action reduired in order to minimize the hagard is stated. In all cases,
as will be shown , the failure would be inconvenient, but no serious danger
would ensue, since the most drastic action required would be dumping of the
fuel (and/or sodium) into the dump tanks. Therefore it is also > apparent
that vas operability of the dump system mast be assured.

Fuel Freeze, Excessive cooling of the primary Hak circuit could cause
fuel to freeze in the heat exchanger and stop the flow of the fuel. The
Heat ‘exchanger would not be seriously damaged, but some cracks might form

in “tube walls. Because of fuel flow stoppage and consequent lack of cool~
ing, the temperature of the fuél in the fuel circuit would rise 13°F /sec
(boil in 2 min) as a result of fission-fragment decay heal, which will be
3800 Btu/sec (6% of power) immediately upon cessation of cooling in the
circuit. In the reactor structure, the cooling available from conduction
after dumping of the fuel would not be adequate $0 keep pump blades, wells,
and other points where fuel might be trapped from being raised to fuel
vaporization temperature. Excessive cooling in the primary NaK circuit
“would, therefore, require that the fuel be damped.

A failure in the fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger would cause a Nak or a fuel

i - leak. ‘Deformation in the fuel-to-NakK ‘heat exchanger ‘would possibly result

in slight changes in pressure drops and heat “transfer characteristics. It

would probably be necessary to dump the fuel if any of these postulated

: events ‘occurred, with the possible ‘exception of slight deformation in the

fuel~to-Nak heat exchanger.

: Pump ‘Failures. Loss of ‘power “to pup arives, 5 “as well as ‘seizing of

shafts, bearings, or impellers, could cause pump stoppage. If one of the

two fuel pumps stopped pumping, the fuel flow pattern would be altered and

; roughly one-half the fuel-to-NaK heat exchanger would be starved. There

i would be a consequent reduction in power output. If both the fuel pumps
failed, fuel flow would stop and the fuel temperature would rise. 13°F/ sec

because of fission fragment decay heat (see item on "Fuel Freeze" above).

If only one fuel pump failed the fuel would be dumped or the reactor would

tures of the beryllium in the moderator and the sodium would rise OC. 5°F/ sec,
and is would be necessary to dump the fuel. :

 

The failure of one . Nek pump in the primary “heat exchange eireuit would
reduce NeK flow and consequently reduce the reactor power output. As with
other pump failures, it would be necessary to dump the fuel or to operate
the reactor at reduced power. If all the NaK pumps in the primary heat
exchange system failed, the fuel temperature would rise 13°F/ sec (see item
on "Fuel Freeze" above), and the fuel would be dumped immediately. Fail-
ure of the NaK pump in the moderator ‘cooling circuit would ‘cause btempera-
tures of the sodium and the beryllium to rise O. 5°F/sec. As in the case of
the sodium pump failures, it would be necessary to dump - the fuel.

~ If the pumps for providing cooling oil “to the pumps were 6 fail,
there would be a slow increase in temperature of the oil coolant, the. fuel
pump shaft, the bearings, and the gas-seal mechanism. Failures of this
type would be taken care of by switching to the auxiliary pump and’ repair-
ing the pump that failed.

Electrical Power Failure. An emergency power supply will be available
and all .instrumentation and essential equipment would be transferred to it.
Therefore, there would be no immediate hazard following such a failure.

The emergency power system will be adequate to operate at least one fuel
pump, one sodium pump, one NaK pump, one blower, and all the necessary in-
struments. This equipment will be sufficient to prevent excessive tempera-
ture rises from the- fuel afterheat. All possible measures will immediately
be taken to restore the normal power supply as rapidly as possible. How=

Fuel, Sodium or NaK Leaks

«5T=

Fuel Channel Hot Spots. Flow separation in the core or fallure of
the core-shell coolant system could cause hot spots in the fuel channel.
In this event there would be the possibility of fuel boiling in the core
and causing irregularities in power or increased corrosion. The power
level would be reduced until the fuel boiling ceased, or, if necessary,

the fuel would be dumped.
Excessive Fuel Feed. A failure in the enrichment system might result

in the addition of ‘excess fuel. In this event the reactor would heat to a

new and higher equilibrium temperature. An excess of 0.6 1b of UR) intro-
duced, instantaneously would make the reactor prompt critical. A Ak fk of
0.002 would occur and result in an immediate fuel temperature rise of LO°F,
The reactor would quickly level out at the new temperature. If the equi-
librium temperature were excessive, the fuel would be dumped.

Fuel Fill-and-Drain System Failure. The fuel fill-and-drain system

might fail because of jammed valves or a coolant system failure. If such

a failure occurred before the fuel was enriched, there would be no hazard.
The system would be repaired, if possible, or the nonradicactive fuel would
be drained on the floor of the reactor cell. In the event of an emergency
drain of radiodetive fuel coincident with a failure of the fill-and-drain
system that prevents drainage, the reactor will fail at the weakest point
and release hot fuel, fission products, sodium, and NeK in the reactor cell.

If the drain system functioned satisfactorily but the dump tank cooling sys-

tem failed after the fuel was drained, the tank would fail at its weakest
point and release large quantities of hot fuel and fission products to the
reactor cell. The reactor cell is designed to contain the hot, radioactive
fuel, as described in a following section. If it were desired to drain the
radioactive fuel under normal operating conditions and drainage was pre-
vented, it would be necessary to cool the radioactive fuel with the normal
heat removal system until the decay heat had dropped sufficiently to permit

shutdown of the Nex systen.
Nek Circuit Heat Duip Blower Failure. Ir the blowers failed, heat loss

from the radiators would be by natural convection only and would be about

by radiographic techniques, as well as by preliminary testing, any leaks
that might occur would probably result either from corrosion or a fatigue
crack. Corrosion is far more probable apd is of particular concern, largely
because of the uncertainties associated therewith.

The corrosion process is discussed in Appendix C. From the test data
included there, it is estimated that the corrosion penetration in the hot
zone of the ART would be of the order of 15 to 18 mils if no reductions,
in comparison with present experience, can be effected in the corrosion
rate. The wall thicknesses to which the fuel is to be exposed will be

125 mils in the core and 25 mils in the heat ‘exchanger. In the core the

wall thickness is believed to be ample; in the heat exchanger the metal
would sustain a steep temperature gradient because of cooling by the Nak
s0 thet the penetrations given above may not apply. However, should com-
ponent tests fail to justify this assumption, 3 heavier tubing will be used.

If a leak, either from corrosion or fatigue, did occur, various chemi- °
cal reactions could occur ‘between the fuel and the Na or NeK, depending upon
the fuel composition, the size of the leak, and whether the leak was into or
out of the fuel system. The consequences of the chemical reactions from
each of 16 distinct leak conditions are also discussed in Appendix C. It
is apparent that the resulting hazards are dependent upon the assumptions
made regarding the leak size, extent of completion of the reaction, and the
precipitation of insoluble particles. The most severe case imaginable is
discussed in a following section entitled "Accidents Causing Rupture'of the
Pressure Shell." The probable consequences are, however, much less severe
and are discussed below. The action taken in each case would be to dump
the fuel and the subsequent hazards would be small.

. Fuel Leak in Core. Since the fuel pressure is maintained below that of
the ‘sodium, a core leak would most probably result in the addition of sodium
to the fuel. The sodium would dilute the fuel mixture and, in the reaction
of sodium with the fuel, UF would be produced. The reaction could continue
until metallic uranium wes produced, which, in turn, would be deposited in
the hotter part of the system (i.e., between the core and the heat exchanger).

This situation would be handled by dumping the fuel--no hazard would ensue. .

On the other hand, if the fuel were to leak into the sodium in the
moderator region, the result would be more serious.because such a leak would
certainly allow excess uranium to be present in the core region. In this
event, the fuel would be dumped as soon as possible.

Fuel Leak Into the Heat Exchanger . A leak in the heat ‘exchanger would

either admit fuel into the Nak system or vice versa. A fuel leak into the

NaK system would increase the activity outside the primary shield, while a
NaK leak into the fuel system might result in excess uranium in the core.

‘Either of these situations would be undesirable, but it is now felt that a

fuel leak into the NeK system would be the more hazardous; therefore the
pressure of the NakX in the heat exchanger will be maintained higher than
that of the uel. ko) whe fuel system.

‘Accordingly, a leak. in the heat exchanger would. probably result in Nek
entering the fuel. As with sodium, UFz would be formed and the fuel mix-
ture would be diluted. Eventually uranium would be formed and would be de-
posited in the hotter section of the system. - This situation would be
handled by dumping the fuel and no hazard would result.

If the fuel pressure were to be greater than that of the NaK and a
leak occurred, some of the fission products would move outside the reactor
cell, The radiation doses which would be experienced at various locations
in the facility with as much as 1% of the fuel in the NaK system are given

reactor than sodium is, Neither of the above situations presents a serious
hazard and would require only that the systems in gestion be drained.

(Figs. 5.1 and 3.2) carries a Uniform Building Code fire rating of 2 hr.
Inflammeble materials are not used in any appreciable quantity in the con-
struction of the building or the reactor. The reactor, as well as the :
associated plumbing, pumps, and heat transfer equipment, has been examined
rather closely from this standpoint.because of the high (up to 1600°F)
operating temperatures involved. However, except for the use of Na and Nak
as coolants in the system, éven the high temperatures (in the absence of
combustible material) present no hazard.

The possibilities of a sodium or a N4K leak have been previously dis-
cussed. However, during operation, the reactor cell will be filled with
helium (or nitrogen) in which sodium and NaK are not flammable. In fact,

experiments have shown that even the potentially dangerous reactions of Nek
and water are greatly reduced in the absence of oxygen. A Nak ledk external

and material of construction in the building, there is little probability

“of any damage occurring from natural elements which could create a hazard.

Floods ‘and ‘Earthquakes.’ Neither floods not “earthquakes present a EE

serious hazard to the ART. As a consequence of the particular topography
selected for the site, a flood, and therefore flood damage, is impossible.

Further, the data on the frequency and severity of earthquakes in the Oak

Ridge area show that the probability of earthquake damage is extremely
small (see section on seismology of area in Appendix A, "Characteristics
of site”).

Uniform Building Code griteria, These criteria provide for design against ~
wind loads of 20 1b /£t2 (about 100 mph) without exceeding the allowable nor-
mal working stress of 20,000 psi in the steel structure. A review of the
meteorological data for this area” shows that it is highly improbable that
winds of this magnitude will even be approached at the sheltered site of the
ART.

      

Nuclear Aocidents Causing Rupture of the Pressure Shell

1 is “always. instructive to consider the consequences of what might be
considered the worst conceivable nuclear accident. Therefore the estimated
reactivities from various changes in the reactor are given in Table 5.2.
From this table it may be seen that a Ak/k of 0.09 is the highest that may
be expected. It is then necessary to consider the maximum rate at which
this or any other Ak could be introduced into the reactor.

It has been possible to conceive of two extreme situations which
appear tO establish an upper limit on the rate at which the reactivity
could increase. They are as follows: (1) fuel abruptly begins to pre=-
cipitate out in the core and the fuel stream enters the core at the nor-
mal rate but no uranium leaves in the exit stream, and (2) fuel abruptly
enters the moderator cooling passages ‘replacing the sodium. A third

" situation-~one in which the beryllium reflector melts and mixes uniformly
‘with the fuel-~was examined, but it developed that this accident would

not give nearly as large a rate of increase in keff because the high heat
capacity of the Peflector would keep the beryllium from melting rapidly.
The rate of temperature rise in the portion adjacent to the fuel region
would be only 20°F/sec at 60 Mw. The two most severe accidents are dis-
cussed below, In addition, the vulnerability of the reactor cell to pene-
tration by pressure shell fragments, if the pressure shell vere to rupture
as a consequence of other accidents, is examined.

The investigation of these two extreme nuclear accidents may be sum-
marized as follows:

ok 1. The inherent stability of cireulating-£luoride-fuel ‘reactors
derived from their high negative temperature coefficients make the pro~
posed 60-Mw reactor self-regulating even for extremely rapid changes in

Keffe

Cd °. Even if the pressure shell : were to be ruptured as a result of an
extremely high rate of increase of Jere (6k/k)/sec] , the pressure
shell fragments ejected would not pierce the 1/2~in. wall of the reactor
cell.

3. he radisbion hazard fron Call the “puel” in the bottom of the
reactor cell would be even less than for the case with 1% of the fuel in
the NeK system, i.e., only 0.0k rem/hr in the control room 15 min after the
accident (see Table 5. 1).

This accident’ ‘has been considered analytically in Appendix D and by

‘a numerical approach in Appendix E. The results of the two methods are

reasonably ‘consistent and are summarized in Fig. E.l of Appendix E. For
this type of accident the pressure shell is ruptured only if the reactivity

is increased at a rate higher than that corresponding to half the rate at which

fuel would ‘pe pumped into the core. If the pressure shell should rupture,
the reactor fuel, and sodium would be spewed into the shield where they would
mix and’ react with each other and with the shield water.’ «The resuliing
chemical resections are discussed in Appendix B. As may be seen in this
Appendix all the chemical reactions may be contained, with the possible ex-
ception of the case discussed in a following section in which there is an
air atmosphere in the reactor cell and a hydrogen explosion becomes a
possibility. veo

“Fel” in Moderator. “Tf the Sodium’ pressire is not usintained higher

than Lhat of the. fuel in the core, fuel would enter the moderator region

in the event of a ¢ore shell leak. It has been assumed that as a conse~
quence of unforseeable events an abrupt rupture of the reflector shell close
to the core inlet would begin to discharge fuel into all the cooling pass--
ages through the beryllium at a rate equivalent to that given by the sodium
velocity. While the cooling passages would probably plug close to their
inlets it is interesting to construct the probable course of the accident
if it is assumed that no plugging occurs, The initial fuel velocity through
the passages would be about the same as that for the sodium, i.e., 30 fps.
Because of the higher density of the fuel, its velocity would fall off as it
penetrated the reflector. The worst case would be that in which the fuel
entered all the coolant passages simultaneously, thus giving the maximum
rate of increase in reactivity. The initial fuel velocity through the re-
flector would give a transit time of about 1/7 sec, or about 1/7 of the
corresponding value for the core. The volume .of thase passages is about
0.16 £t3, as compared with 3 £12 in the core. The increase in Kerr if fuel
filled the passages in the reflector and island has been computed to be
0.09. The average power density in the fuel in the reflector was calculated
to be six times that in the core. This would make the average rate of tem-

‘perature rise in the reflector fuel about equal to that for the fuel in the

core, However, the rate of temperature rise at the nose of the ‘fuel columns
in regions of high importance would be at least twice the average so that:

the rate of temperature rise there should be at least Twice ‘the average

value in the core.

Bini

Calculations were made for this case, | except that the rate of : increase
in kepr was taken to be twice as great to give a truly extreme case. In
this instance the power was found to rise to about 6000 Mw in gbout 80 msec,

.at which point the fuel in the beryllium would begin to boil. The pressure

in the reflector cooling passages would rise abruptly to about 500 psi, the
fuel would be expelled from them in about 10 msec, and, at that point, the
core ‘Fuel would have reached a temperature of about 300°F above normal; the
reactor. ‘would then be on a 20-msec negative period.

This velocity of > 215 fps is certainly a “reasonable one “and should not give
any particular trouble. It is also important because it represents the
maximum possible velocity of a fragment that might be broken out of the pres-
sure shell in the event of a hydrostatic rupture. This velocity has to be
compared with the velocity required to penetrate the 1/2-in. wall of the en-
closure. As discussed in Appendix F, the penetrating power of projectiles
varies with their shape, hardness, strength, mass, and velocity, with a
6-in. cast-iron sphere giving a rough standard for this case. As shown in
Appendix F, the velocity for penetration of 1/2-in. steel plate by such a
sphere is roughly 380 fps. Since the pressure shell is designed to rupture
at the bottom, and since the shielded drain tanks for the fuel and sodium
will be carried on a substantial floor immediately under the reactor; the
tank bottom is well protected from any pressure shell fragments, particu-
larly since only small fragments could have a velocity as high as 215 fps.
Thus it is clear that, even in the most pessimistic case, penetration of
the cell wall is out of the question, even if no account is taken of the
energy Joss of ‘the Traguent during its travel through the ‘Lead and water.

 

  
   
  
 
  

Accidents That Might Ruptuze the Reactor Cell

 

It was demonstrated in “the! preceding section that the reactor cell will

t be. ruptured &s a consequence of even the worst conceivable nuclear acci-

“ dents. If it is postulated that one such nuclear accident ‘may coincide with

the production of all the heat that could possibly be released from the

“chemical combinations of various materials in the védetor and in an oxygen

atmosphere, enough additional energy would be available to give still higher
cell pressures and possibly rupture the reactor cell. As pointed out in the
previous section, since the chemical reactions are more serious with an oxy-
gen atmosphere, the cell atmosphere will be maintained greater than 995%

nitrogen. The oxygen concentration will be monitored, and the instrumen-
tation will be interlocked (during power operation) to dump the fuel when-
ever the oxygen concentration is greater than 1%. It then appears that the
only means by which both the pressure shell and the reactor cell could be
ruptured simultaneously would be as a result of bomb damage. The possi- .
bilities of such a bombing, either by sabotage or aerial bombing, are re-
mote. The principle hazard associated with the simultaneous rupture of the
reactor pressure shell and cell would be from the dispersion of the activity.
This is discussed in the following chapter on ‘Dispersion of Airborne
Activity,"

CL Iydzogen Explosion. In considering the various chemical reactions (see
Appendix B), one way that the reactor cell might conceivably be ruptured

would be by a hydrogen explosion following the reaction of the sodium or Nak

with water in an air atmosphere. As mentioned above, nitrogen is to be main-

tained within the reactor cell once any appreciable radioactivity has been
generated in the fuel. Oxygen absorbers will be exposed to the atmosphere
within the cell and an oxygen monitor will be interlocked to open both the

fuel and the NaK drain valves if the oxygen concentration goes above 1%.

The energy produced from the various reactions ’ including those requir-
ing an oxygen atmosphere, have been calculated in Appendix B and are summar-
ized in Table 5.3. The most serious event would be that in which the shield
water would combine in stoichiometric proportions with all the sodium and
NeK in the system, and the resulting hydrogen would burn in the presence of
the available oxygen in an air atmosphere in the reactor cell. If no heat
were lost to the cell walls, the pressure in the cell would reach 181 psia..
Obviously, this is an overestimate because considerable heat would be re-
moved by ‘the surrounding water during the course of the reaction.

If all of the hydrogen were to mix with the oxygen without igniting,
detonation could take place and give a shock wave that would increase the
stresses in the walls of the reactor cell. Of the 181 psia only part, or
66 psia, arises from the hydrogen-oxygen reaction. If it is assumed thai
the pressure increase associated with detonation is twice the normal pres-
sure rise, or 132 psia, and that the pressure from all reactions prior to
the explosion is not relieved by heat removal by the walls of the cell,
then a peak pressure of 247 psia would result. This value is about double
that for the case in which a nitrogen atmosphere is maintained within the

tank.

   

In a probability the hydrogen would burn ¢ as it was ‘formed from the

NaK-water reaction. The simultaneous occurrence of several unlikely events
would be necessary for an explosion; namely, the oxygen absorbing and moni-
toring ‘system would fail, an air leak into the cell would occur; a leak
between the sodium or NaK and the shielding waber would occur; and the
hydrogen would not be ignited as it was formed but would react only after
the major part of the NaK-water reaction had gone to completion. Even if
all of these things did happen, it seems unlikely that the resulting shock
wave could rupture the tank wall, particularly in view of the inertia of
the steel wall and the water surrounding it.

* Deaplats From High oh Explosives. Blowing up of ‘the ART with explosive
charges set from “Tints by saboteurs would be feasible, as for any instal-
lation. However, the effectiveness of such action would depend primarily
on the proximity of the charge with respect to the most critical components,
i.e., the reactor pressure shell and the fuel drain system. Accessibility
to these components and therefore vulnerability will determine the effec-
tiveness of this type of sabotage. The double-walled reactor cell serves
as a barrier against entry and would be formidable as protection against

external explosions. However, the successful placement of an explosive
charge within the contalner during servicing operations could be effective.
In that event, the reactions of the reactor fluids, including the shield

water, would take place as described in the preceding section.

Effectiveness of the Reactor Cell in Containing Hazards

 

No allowance for ‘the ‘temperature rise of the atmosphere within ‘the
double-walled reactor cell associated with the release of fission-product
afterheat has ‘been’ medé. Calculations were made to include this factor as
well, and it wes found that the’ ‘temperatures and préssures would fall off
slowly after the accident. Thus these values represent meximums; any
severe accident would almost certainly involve marked quenching by the
shield water, 9 “probably to the extent that ‘Little pressure and temperature

Actually, any accident severe enough to dump all the fuel charge into
the bottom of the tank would probably also rupture the shield so that the
shield water would float on the surface of the fluoride. It would boil vio-
lently, and water vapor would rise, condense on the tank walls, and drain
back to the bottom of the tank.

The double-walled cell was devised primarily in an effort to give a
thoroughly reliable meens for absorbing the heat evolved in any accident,
no matter how severe. No pumps or other motor-driven equipment would be
required and, even if the electrical power supply were ito remain inoperable
for days after the accident, there would be enough heat capacity in the water
so that little, if any, of it would vaporize. The high surface heat transfer
coefficient associated with boiling of the water should ensure good cooling

of the cell walls.

Comparison of Various Reactor Assembly Containers

Because of the importance of containing the products of a reactor
accident, several different potential reactor containers were examined. A
comparison of key data for the most promising types of container is given in
Teble 5.4, and the worst set of conditions applicable to each case is pre-
sumed. As may be seen, the reactor assembly cell proposed in this report
compares favorably with the hemispherical and ellipsoidal buildings. The
double-walled cell also appears superior in that it would be less subject
to sabotage. Even if both the inner and the outer tanks were ruptured by
sabotage and the reactor melted down, the residue would tend to sink to the
bottom of the tank pit where it would be flooded by the water that had filled
the region at the top and between the tanks. This water would serve both to

absorb the heat of any reaction and as a shield to reduce the radiation level

at the top of the pit. After careful review of these and a host of lesser
considerations, the 2h-ft-dia double-walled cell was chosen 8 as the most
ov promising test © facility. To a

. 6. DISPERSION OF ATRBORNE ACTIVITY:

‘Meteorological data have been used to calculate the possible radiation
hazards to the Laboratory and civilian population as a result of both nor-
mal and accidental release of radioactive materials from the ART. The nor-
mal method of discharging activity will consist of directing the off-gases
through a charcoal-filled “pipe which will remove most of the activity and
effect a more than two-day holdup before ejecting the residual gases up the
stack. The stack in carrying the large volumes of heated air produced by
the process systems will give very large plume rises in winds under 10 mph.
The resultant ground exposures will be always and everywhere substantially
below tolerance, In fact, even when there is no process air flow up the

stack, the resulting exposures will be below tolerance.. The process air will y

however, effect a reduction in the resulting ground concentration of around
10, which will be desirable in some emergency situations.

In the calculations’ ‘for an accidental release, a value of about 6 x 108
cal was used as the minimum amount of heat which could cause all the fission
activity to be given off ina gaseous cloud. The total activity present was
then assumed to be that given by Mill's formula, 2 even though ARE operation
indicated that some of the activity was continuously removed and therefore
not available to the disaster. This activity will be safely dispersed from
a hot daytime cloud, but it will exceed tolerance at night by a maximum fac-
tor of 5 or 17, depending upon which tolerance value is used. As would be
expected, the doses from the cold cloud or from rainout of either cloud
would be well above tolerance.

It is worthy of note that ‘the assumptions -made for the calculations
which follow, ‘both for the case of the discharge of activity up the stack
and for the dispersion of activity from a disaster, have been conservatively
taken Cor step. The Tesulting safety factors combine to effect indi-

Holdup System. In the charcoal-filled pipe there will be over 100
times the minimum amount of charcoal required to effect a two-day holdup
of krypton. In the calculations, no credit is taken for residence time
in the reactor system or travel time in the off-gas system.

Meteorological Parameters. A stability factor (nighttime) of 0. L was
used in the disaster calculation rather then the more likely value of 0.35.
The hot cloud and the stack plume rises were limited in some instances,

~ even though greater heights would have effected greater dispersions. Although

the nighttime stable conditions will not last much longer than 16 hr, the

unrealistic assumption of continuous nighttime conditions was not used for
continuous exposures or for disaster-cloud travel times of greater than

about 16 hr. Low average wind velocity values were used for the hot cloud,
even though ‘equally justifiable higher values would have effected greater
dispersions. Also, for each calculation that gives the maximum dose at any
location, it is assumed that the wind always blows in thet direction with a
constant optimum value.

‘Fission Products in Hot Cloud. The amount of heat in the ‘ot ‘¢loud is
a lower limit for the amount of heat required to vaporize all the fuel be-

“cause the heat of vaporization of the first ‘component which comes off (as

the fuel is heated) is used for determining the heat required to vaporize
all the fuel. For determining the activity in the cloud, an upper limit
is used, since all the fuel would never be in the right place at the right
time to be vaporized. Also, operation of the ARE indicated that some
activity may be removed continuously.

Radiation Tolerances

The maximum total dose which the civilian population should be permit-
ted to receive in any accident is 25 rem. The maximum permissible exposure
to contaminated atmosphere which will give a dose of 25 rem by inhalation
is therefore of considerable interest. A value for the maxim permissible
exposure of 10 curiessec/m3 has been given by Marley3 for total fission
products. However, Marley used a breathing rate of the order of 6 liters/min
that is considerably lower than that for the average excited man, which is

around 30 liters/min. In applying Marley's tolerance to a given condition

the total radiation is assumed to decay according to t-0-2 as the radio-
active cloud moves out from the source.

On the other hand, T. J. Burnett of the ORNL Health Physics Division
has calculated,” on the basis of a selected group of 30 long-lived fission
products, that the maximum permissible exposure to these isotopes is

1000 hr of operation, these 30 isotopes represent about 8% of the total
activity present at 1 sec, if 4-0+2 is assumed for all the activity.
Since these are long-lived isotopes, no decay correction is applied.
(Tt is further shown in Appendix G that this group of 30 isotopes may
be reduced to a group of six isotopes which cortribute over 95% of the
dose to the bone.)

As was noted previously the off-gas system is designed to routinely
discharge less than 0.001 curie/sec of Kr88 to the stack. The tolerance
for Kr88-rpo8 has been calculated® to be 6.3 x 10-8 curies/m3 for comtin-
uous exposure. This calculation permitted a dose rate of 0.3 urem/hr for
the 1000 hr of contemplated reactor operation.

Discharge of Activity up the Stack

The ART stack is 78 ft high and 10 ft in diameter. Its dimensions
were largely defined by the air flow from the process systems since it was
desired to employ this air in order to effect greater dispersion of the
off-gas. The design capacity of ‘the air blowers is 3 x 105 cfm of air at
ambient temperature. This volume of air when. heated in the hot-air radi-
ators to T50OF expands to 6.7 x 105 cfm, and therefore, during power opera-
tion, this latter quantity of air is discharged up the stack.

The dispersion of activity from ‘the stack has “been” “eonsidered for
three conditions of air flow: (1) 6.7 x 109 cfm of T50OF air, (2) 3 x 107 cfm
of ambient air, and (3) mo air flow. With the two-day holdup provided in the
off-gas system before the off gases reach the stacks, the off gases may be
ages without anywhere exceeding the kr88 tolerance of 6. 3 x 10-8
curie/, m3 for continuous exposure for the first two conditions. "For no stack
air flow, the Kr88 tolerance will be exceeded by a factor of 4. Further-
more, if it becomes necessary following a contained disaster to dispose of
large amounts of activity, as ‘much as 8 curies/sec. could be discharged up
th'3'x 100 cfm of ambient air and still. not exceed an internal

Figure 6.1 shows estimated plume rises versus wind speed for both i.

6.7 x 10° cfm air at T50°F and 3x 10° cfm of air at ambient temperature.

The calculated plume rise values. were used, together with appropriate

* meteorologicel data derived from the observations reported by Myers and

Holland,? to compute the maximum ground concentrations and the distance
from the stack of the maximum ground concentration under a wide range of
wind speeds. The full plume rise was used in the unstable or daytime case,
but the plume’ rise was limited to about 600 meters at night, which corre-

' sponds to the ‘upper limit of observed rises from the large TVA steam plant

stacks ‘during ‘stable conditions. The calculated rises below the 600-meter
level were used for the nighttime rise. This treatment of the stable case
minimizes: the safety factor of the light-wind stable case which might be

the most doubtful. The important dispersion conditions which are considered
are those which oceur with winds under 10 mps and are representative of 99. %
of the hours of wind observed at the site. The parameters used for these
calculations are given in » Table 6.1.

    

of ‘these caléulations for Stdady emission of 0. 001 “curie/sec

are given ‘in ables 6.2 and 6.3, with and without the decay correction. The:

decay correction given here is that determined by the decay rate for eqgui-

. librium reactor fission products; £-0.2

As previously hoted (section on “Radiation Tolerances") the concentra-
tion of Kr90 for continuous exposure is 6.3 x 10 curie/m3. Furthermore,
for a reactor operating at 60 Mw the equilibrium discharge rate of Kr
after a two-day holdup in the off-gas system is 0.0009 curie/sec (section on
"off-Gas System"). The maximum concentration (with no decay correction)
occurs during the day at 0.37 mile from the source when the wind speed is

"10 meters per second (1 mps = 2.24 miles per hour). This concentration

(6.08 x 10-9 curie/m3 per 0.00L curie/sec emitted) is a factor of 10 below
the tolerance for continuous exposure. Furthermore, it should be noted that
the wind will not blow in the same direction and with the same high (10 mps )
velocity for 1000 continuous hours of daytime conditions, and, in addition, .

the actual off-gas holdup system will have. over 100 times the amount of char-

coal required to effect the two-day holdup which was used in the above cal-
culations,

Operation Without Heating Stack Air. Except when the reactor is oper-

 

ating at full power the air flow up the stack will be less than 6.7 x 107 cfm
and the air temperature will be less than T50°F. For the limiting case with
no power being removed from the system, there will be 3 x 10° cfm of ambient
temperature air flow up the stack. A by-pass air duct will be provided
around the radiators so that the air may be sent up the stack without cool-
ing the reactor. The lower temperature and smaller air flow will produce
the lower stack rises which are given by the lower curve in Fig. 6.1. These
plume hoes fogether with the meteorological date derived from OR0-99, were

* Appendix F
EFFECTS OF A NUCLEAR ACCIDENT ON REACTOR STRUCTURE

The detailed design of the reactor and related equipment has been
predicated upon the use of a stress level approximately one-fifth of
the stress for rupture in 1000 hr. Thus the system is one in which no
burst-type of rupture will be Likely to occur. The type of failure to
be expected would be the result of either a fatigue crack or a leak
caused by corrosion. In either case, the failure would develop slowly
so that there would be ample indication of the character of the trouble
before anything serious.developed. It should be noted, however, that
while this philosophy has been applied to the types of accident and haz~
ards to be expected, no advantage of this design basis has been taken
in’, consideration of extreme accidents. Such accidents could take place
only if a burst-type of rupture occurred, and such ruptures have been pre-

sumed, even though no reasonable mechanism for causing them has been en-
visioned.

In addition, two. major tenets of the design philosophy nave been that
the pressures throughout the systems should be kept low, particularly in
the hot zones, and that all structure should be cooled to a temperature
approximately equal to or below that of the secondary coolant leaving the

“heat exchanger. Great care was exercised in establishing the proportions

of the designs presented in Tables F.l and F.2 to satisfy these conditions.
The stress values calculated for the various stations in a typical design
are indicated in Fig. 2.1. The stresses in the structural parts have been
kept to a minimum and the ability of the structure to withstand these
stresses has been made as great as practicable. Thermal stresses are not
indicated since they will be indeterminate, and it is felt that they will,
tc a large degree, anneal out at operating temperatures.

IT a very severe pressure surge is assumed to occur as a consequence
of a nuclear accident, it is possible to envision fairly well the sequence
of events that would lead to a failure in the reactor structure. The first

consideration in any such analysis is the - strength of the material of the
structure. Table F.3 presents strength data for Inconel, the structural
“material presently being considered. Note that the yield point and ulti-

mate tensile strength are much higher than the 1000-hr stress rupture limit.
Note also that the percent elongation is substantial, and. ‘thus much plastic

distortion would take place before rupture would occur. Since the struc=-

ture incorporates substantial stress concentrations, the local yielding nay

be substantial, but the volumetric change in the pressure shell will be
small.

€ principal element in the reactor structure is the main pressure

~ shell. It is a spherical vessel 1 in. thick with an internal diameter of

© 52.5 in. During normal operating conditions the temperature of the pres-
sure shell will be 1200°F. The stress in this shell for an internal pres-
sure P is given by - : oo - oo

s=2L-EX2:0 _1295p.
: 2t 2

The stress, S, and pressure, P, are in psi and the radius, r, and the shell

thickness, t, are in inches. In re-examining the stress expression and
Table F«3 it is evident that the main pressure shell would begin to yield
at a pressure of about 1000 psi at stress concentrations such as those
which will be present in the ligament between the heat exchanger inlet and
outlet header pipes. It would be expected that progressive local yielding .
would continue to take place in these regions until failure occurred; some
increase in pressure would occur in the process. Another major weak area
would be the flat structural region at the top of the shell where the pumps
and expansion tanks are to be located. While final detailed designs are
not yet available, it does seem certain that local yielding would begin in

oo this region at a pressure of the order of 1000 psi. It also seems likely

that one result of this yielding would be that the pump casings would dis=

OE a the impellers ‘to seize in the casings and the pumps to Stop.

= Ppl = 10,000 psi .

This would give a tensile strength of 14,100 psi, which represents an
average stress in the ligaments. The peak value around the edge of the
holes would be approximately twice as great so that yielding would begin
there. The stress would then distribute itself uniformly across the liga~
ment, and further plastic deformation would follow until a tear would begin
and } rupture would Tinally take ‘places

The stresses in the outer core shell are of particular interest be-
cause expansion of that core shell would increase the fuel volume in the
reactor and as a consequence give an increase in reactivity, If the core
shell were not supported by the moderator, the stress in the shell would
be given by

_ Pr P x 10.5 i}
S = = = 2 P.
1.6% 1.6 x 0.125 28:2

Note that a factor of 1.6 instead of 23 was used 1 in the denominator because

the radius of curvature of the core shell at the equator in the vertical
plane is greater than it is in the horizontal plane. This core shell is.
actually supported by flattened Inconel wires inserted between the core
shell and the beryllium reflector and spaced in rows on l-in. centers.
These strips are used primarily to maintain the spacing between the reflec~
tor and the shell and hence to ensure the proper coolant flow passage open-
ing. It is interesting to determine the radius of curvature of the shell
when deflected between the supports by a pressure that would give the same
stress in the core shell as would prevail in the main pressure shell. If

a simplified cylindrical geometry is assumed, the relation for that case

is

‘5 = Px 25.7 - Pr ,
2x1. 7 0.125

from which a radius of 1.6 in. is obtained. Thus the core shell would
deflect to the point where it would have a radius of curvature of 1.6 in.
between supports. The effect on the core volume of this distortion coupled

“with that of the inner core shell would be relatively small, and would give
-a volume increase of about 1% for a 1000-psi pressure. The stresses in the

inner core shell would be similar to, but lower than, those in the outer

core shell because its diameter would be roughly one-half that of the outer

core shell.

Note that this stress is very ‘mach less than that in the main pressure

shell so that it is very unlikely that the heat exchanger tubes would col-

The force — to blow “the pump body out of ‘the pimp > casing is
of interest. IP it is assumed that the main pressure shell would begin to
yield locally” ‘under a pressure “of 1000 psi, the force acting on the pump
body may be calculated in the following ways

  

:

The ofosslasttional area of “the pump body attaching .screws is over 2 in.2,
and since this is the weakest point in the system restraining the pump
body from blow-out and since it is in a cold region where the tensile
strength of the material is of the order of 90,000 psi, it is clear that
this does not represent a weak point in the system. While the thrust bear-
ing at the top of the pump impeller shaft might fail and allow the impeller
shaft assembly to move upward several inches, the pump impeller itself

would keep the shaft from ‘moving on out through the pump body. If this
failure took place there would be free communication from the reactor core

through the pump impeller bore into the fuel expansion tank.

The volumetric stiffness of ‘the main pressure shell is of interest
from the standpoint of determining the pressure at various stages during a
nuclear accident. The change in volume, AV, in cubic feet, is given as
follows:

1200°F. ‘From this” it follows that “the increase in volume inside the pres-

sure shell for a 1000-psi pressure “surge would be 0.076 ft. It should be
noted that the pressure shell in some respects would be stiffer than it is
assumed to be here because of the presence of the liner in the heat ex-

changer region and at the south end. On the other hand, the system would

be less Stiff because of the presence of flat regions in “the pump and

expansion tank region. It seems likely that a rough approximation to
the stiffness of the system has been given.
Destructiveness of Pressure Shell Fragments
~The velocity of the fluid escaping through a crack if rupture should
occur at 1000 psi is of interest. This can be computed as follows:

v = Gl x mE. {6 6,500 = 215 fps,

  

where B 3 the pressure - 1/262) divided by the density of the laid

(in 1b/ft3). This velocity of 215 fps is certainly a reasonable one and
should not give any particular trouble. It is also important because it

‘represents the maximum possible velocity of a fragment that might be broken

out of the pressure shell in the event of a hydrostatic rupture. It is
interesting to estimate the maximum kinetic energy that could exist in an
escaping fragment for this case. The work or energy put into the fragment
in the rupture process should equal double the area under the PV diagram

for the pressure at rupbure and the volumetric increase inside the pressure

shell up to the rupture pressure. This triangular PV diagram area should .
be multiplied by a factor of two to allow for the elastic overshoot or re-
bound of the Fhell ‘accompanying the pressure velist:

To

- wor - PAV =  24ky000 x oso16 = 20,900 2 Fo-lb

   

It is also of interest to calculate the weight, Ww, of the minimim rrogisut

required to carry off’ all the rupture hog. This is

K. BE.

10,900 = TFET (215)

W 15 1b.

Thus it appears that the most destructive fragment from a pressure shell
failure at 1000-psi pressure would be a }5-1b fragment that would leave the
reactor at a velocity of 215 fps with a kinetic energy of about 11,000 ft-lb.
If this fragment were of l-in.-thick Inconel, its area would be 260 in.2,

If it were to strike the lead shield and all of its momentum were imparted
to a lead fragment of the same area having a thickness of 7 in., the result-
ing velocity of the lead fragment could not exceed 20 fps if no allowance
were made for the energy absorbed in rupturing the lead.

In re-examining the above analysis 1% appears that a number of modes
of failure might be encountered. If no special provision were made to re-

‘lieve the pressure it seems likely that the north head would deflect plas-

tically to the point where the pump impellers would seize in their casings.
Thus whether the increase in volume associated with this deflection would
be sufficient to relieve the pressure associated with the nuclear reaction
would depend upon the particular accident. Certainly, if carried far
enough, rupture would occur. If rupture did occur it seems unlikely that

a large fragment. or, for that matter a small fragment, would be blown out
of the wall of the main pressure shell, Rather it seems likely that the
wall would split and open up to relieve the excessive Pressure. It seems
most likely that this splitting would occur in the ligaments between the
heat exchanger outlet tubes at the south end of the reactor. In that event
about a 3/k=in. stretch in these ligaments would probably occur prior to
failure.
Pressure Relief Mechanisms

Provision can be made in the design to relieve a violent pressure
surge from a nuclear accident in a number of ways. It would be possible,
for example, to put a poppet valve in the fuel region just ahead of the
fuel pump inlet so that it would open and vent to the expansion tank. The
utility of such a move is doubtful because the volume available in the ex-
pansion tank is probably not quite adequate to take care of an extreme nu-
clear accident. While an overflow will be connected from the top of the
expansion tank to the emergency fuel dump tank, and this line will be kept
heated at all times, its diameter would have to be at least 4 in. if it
were to be effective in relieving a pressure surge in a nuclear ‘accident.
A second provision for pressure relief could take the form of a frangible
diaphragm. If this frangible diaphragm were placed at the bottom of the
reactor it would be in a high-pressure region and would be subjected to a
pressure of approximately TO psi under normal. operating conditions. Thus :.:
it would have to be designed to rupture at a pressure of at least 400 psi
because the ratio of the ultimate tensile strength to the 1000-hr rupture
strength is approximately 4 at 1200°F. Thus, if a factor of safety of 4
were used in the design of the disk, under normal operating conditions the
pressure at that point would have to be roughly 16 times as great to produce
failure, or about 1000 psi. If, on the other hand, the diaphragm were placed
at, or close to, the fuel pump inlet where the pressure would normally be,

‘perhaps 5 psi, it could be designed to rupture at a pressure of 60 psi and

still have a factor of safety of 12, stress-wise, for normal operating con=~
ditions. Yet another device that might be used would be to employ a weak
seam in the attachment of the whole north head or some part: thereof. This

again, would have th ‘disadvantage that it would cperate under high stress
for I conditions if it were designed for rupture at a pres.

   

 

  

 

 

immediately outside ‘the Teactor pressure shell, ae volume could be

provided readily with little Pe in shield veight by leaving voids in

umps and header tank.

 
   
  
 

In this way “an explosion vol e of per-
haps 0.5 ft3 could be readily arranged. Yet another Way in which expansion
volume could be provided would be to ‘place a blister on one side or the top
or the bottom of the pressure shell. The side or bottom of the pressure

shell is particularly attractive from this standpoint because a drain line

from the blister to the fuel dump tank could be easily installed. Of

course, a large diameter pipe could be extended directly out through the
shield. However, since a pipe of at least 4 or 5 in. in diameter would
be required, this would constitute a serious gep in the shield which would
be difficult to block off with a shield patch.

“While it is hard to see how it could occur, an extreme power excur-
sion relieved by boiling at the peak of the power curve is of interest.
At first glance, it appears that such an accident might lead to the ejec=-
tion of pressure shell fragments that could pierce the wall of the immer
tank. In re-examining the stress analysis results, together with the curves
of Fig. B.1 and the data in Tables E.2 to E.6, two points are evident. The
first is that the shell will probably rupture locally under an internal
‘pressure Of between 1000 and 2000 psi and will certainly rupture generally
at a pressure not to exceed 4000 psi. The second point is that if a small
opening having a diameter of say 4 in. appears, the rate of ejection will
not be high enough to keep the fluid pressure from rising so much that
either the hole would tear open further or a second failure would occur.
In either case it would not be possible for all of the energy to be concen-
trated in a single small fragment travelling at a very high velocity. In
fact, from Bernoulli's equation, the limiting velocity for the fluid column
(or any fragment) if the peak pressure were 4000 psi would be:

v= YEE ape

The penetrating power of projectiles varies with their shape, hardness
and strength, mass, and velocity. While an ogival shape is the most pene-

HL et

trating, a fragment of such a shape seems quite out of the question. A
sphere has greater penetrating power than any irregular shape likely to be

ejected from the pressure shell. The old Krupp formula for the penetration

"of wrought iron plate by cast iron cannon balls appears to be roughly appli-~

cable to this case, i.e.,
| Vv = 2000\3

where V is in fps and t and d are in inches. The velocity of a 6-in. sphere
required to penetrate 1/2-in. plate is then

“Approaching ‘the problem from a qifferent standpoint and examining the

pressure shell structure carefully, it appears most likely that a circular

section 36.4 in. in diameter would be sheared out through the heat ex~
changer outlet belt. By using the numerical method outlined earlier and by
assuming that there was no loss in reactivity until boiling began to expel
fuel from the core and that all of the pressure relief was obtained by
shearing out the bottom of the pressure shell, the results for a very severe

‘nuclear power surge caused by increasing kepe at a rate of 40% per second

were obtained, as shown in Fig. E.l. The fragment would be accelerated
until it bad passed nearly through the lead region. It was assumed in the

caleulations ‘that Jleldi ‘the Inconel shell took place until it had
moved “through ‘the clearance for thermal insulation and contacted the lead
gamma ‘shield, at which point rupture of the Inconel occurred. No allow=
ance was made for lateral escape of fluid into the space between the lead
and the Inconel shells, nor was allowance made for the energy absorbed in
shearing the lead. Kote that the velocity of the Inconel and lead frag-
ments at the end of the expansion is only about 40 fps. While the failure
might start first on one side so that the disk might tilt during the process
of failure, this would probably result in opening a flap in the pressure
shell without tearing the flap loose from the shell and ejecting it as a
projectile. The worst case would occur if the flap were ejected and tilted
in flight so that it would strike the tank bottom edgewise. The velocity
required for such a projectile to pierce the tank wall can be estimated
from the relation for the energy required to punch holes in plate, i.e.,

If the Inconel disk is 1: in. thick, its weight, W, will be about 1350 1b,

and the periphery, B, of the hole it will punch will be about T6 in. The
ultimate tensile strength, s, of the steel plate should be about 60,000 psi.
The velocity, V, required to pierce the tank wall having a thickness t=

0.5 in. would then be

251 fps.

This velocity is comparable to the 380 fps found for the 6-in. sphere from
the Krupp formula. While the mass of the lead piece sheared out of the
gamma, shield would be large, it would be soft so that most of its energy
upon impact would go into deforming itself rather than into piercing the
tank wall.

type shown in Fig. E.2 if the initial rate of increase in kepp did not ex-

boiling of the fuel would probably cause distortion in the pressure shell

the pressure shell structure would not be damaged, any such incident would

involve so severe a ‘temperature overshoot that further operation of the

coin making the design compromises necessary for a light frangible diaphragm.
This is ‘particularly true in view of the very remote probability of acci-

dents in which it would be of benefit and the much greater likelihood of
troubles that it might give in the course of routine operation. For this
reason the analysis in this report and the curves in Figs. E.l and E.2

avenue of escape of fuel from the core circuit is through the clearances
between the pump impellers and their casings and through the centrifuge
discharge holes into the fuel expansion tank. It should also be noted .
that the worst case in Fig. E.2 that appears, on this basis, to leave the
reactor undamaged is that for an initial rate of increase in keff of 10%
Ak/k per second for which the volume of fuel expelled is about equal to

the free space normally available in the expansion tank. For cases tending

~ to give pressures above 1000 psi, it was deemed best to incorporated a

circular groove in the bottom of the pressure shell so that the pressure
would be relieved by failure in that region. The fuel would be ejected
downward and a 2 minimum of damage to the systen would result.

EXPOSURE HAZARD CALCULATIONSY

Criteria

The calculations of the exposure hazard were based on a total internal
exposure of not more than 25 rem to any internal organs (pone, thyroid,
lungs, G. I. tract, kidneys) over the lifetime of the people exposed. Since
the general population is being considered; the lifetime is taken to be
70 years. The group of people to be protected includes children, the preg-
nant, those especially radiosensitive, those with large previous exposure
records, and those occupationally exposed. If D 1s the exposure rate to the
organ, then

The critical organ is that organ of the body which receives the ‘isotope

that which receives the greatest concentration, but there is considerable
variation in sensitivity. The critical organ depends also on the mode of
intake and may change vith time after intake.

Celennsttonal Procedure

The “components of a given mixture of mixed fission » products a are

‘grouped by the body organs.affected. A tabulation of %j, faqs and
z E(RBE)N values is then made and the corresponding values of Dg are cals
“culated by using the m of the organ. These can be summed to give the ini-

tial dose rates to the organ.

The values of D; are then tabulated, together with those for Ty. By
combining these with values of (1-e -Aty for various times, t, following
intake, the total doses D¢ aré found. The values of pt are then summed,
and. the totals are used to calculate werZ/ 70, :

Values of 4 will vary with the mixture of isotopes considered, 1 which
in turn depends on the time of reactor operation. This is also sensitive
to the choice of isotopes for the mixture to be considered.

The components of the selected mixture were chosen because of their

known hazard and for half lives generally in the range of 20 hr to 20 years.

Shorter-lived isotopes would have Df values small enough to ignore, and
longer-lived isotopes would have small %; values for the operational times

of interest with high-power-density reactors where the reactor is operated with
& max. irradiation time of the order of 1000 hr.. Buildup of longer

lived materials is small for “these times. Parent-daughter relations also
influenced the choice of some isotopes and their inclusion. Since the
composition of the mixture chosen will vary with time following a reactor
incident because of the differing decay rates of its components, there would

be. corresponding different wer25/70 values at different points sufficiently

far downwind for the airborne fransit time to introduce these decay differ-
ences. As a first approximation the decay differences can be ignored, since
the mixture chosen undergoes small decay for the relatively short times of
interest for most reactor accidents for which the radius of hazard is small,
