PREDICTION OF EFFECTIVE YIELDS OF DELAYED NEUTRONS IN MSRE

P. N. Haubenreich

ABSTRACT

Equations were developed and calculations were made to determine the ef-
fective contributions of delayed neutrons in the MSRE during steady power oper-
ation. Nonledkage probabilities were used as the measure of relative importance
of prompt and delayed neutrons, and the spatial and energy distributions of the
prompt and delayed neutron sources were included in the calculation of these
probabilities.

Data which indicate a total yield of 0.0064 delayed neutron per neutron
were used to compute total effective yields of 0.0067 and 0.0036 for the MSRE
under static and circulating conditions respectively.

The effective fractions for the individual groups of delayed neutrons will
be used in future digital calculations of MSRE kinetic behavior.

INTRODUCTION

The kinetics of the fission chain reaction in a circulating-fuel
reactor are influenced by the transport of the delayed neutron precursors.
This fact makes a rigorous treatment quite complicated.’ The approach
generally followed is to drop the transport term from the precursor equa-
tion (making the kinetics equations identical with those for stationary
reactors) and make an approximate allowance for the precursor transport
oy replacing the delayed neutron fractions, B,, with "effective" values,
B; This approximation is used in ZORCH, the computer program recently
developed for analysis of the kinetics of the MSRE.S

The purpose of the work reported here is to obtain values for B,
to be used in the MSRE analyses.

APPROACH TO THE PROELEM

The importance of delayed neutrons is enhanced in fixed-fuel reactors
because the energy spectra of the delayed neutrons lie at much lower en-
ergies than that of the prompt neutrons. 'The differences in energy spectra
make the delayed neutrons more valuable because they are less likely to
escape from the reactor in the course of slowing down to thermal energies.
This effect is, of course, also present in circulating-fuel reactors. Of
greater importance, however, in these reactors is the spatial distribution
of the delayed neutron sources. Many of the delayed neutrons are emitted
outside the core and contribute nothing to the chain reaction. Further-
more, those delayed neutrons which are emitted in the core are, on the
average, produced nearer to the edges of the core than are the prompt
neutrons, which tends to further reduce the contribution of a particular
group of delayed neutrons.

lated MSRE Power Transients With a Simplified Space-Dependent Kinetics
Model, ORNL TM -345 (Sept. 18, 1962).
The contribution of delayed neutrons during a power transient in a
circulating-fuel reactor is affected by the continual change in the shape
of the spatial source distribution. Thus the use of an "effective" frac-
tion for a delay group in analyzing such transients is, in itself, an
approximation. If this approximation is made, and a single set of "ef-
fective" fractions is to be used in the analysis of a variety of trans-
ients, it would seem that the values should be the fractional contributions
of the various groups to the chain reaction under steady-state conditions.
The problem at hand is to calculate these contributions.

It has been the practice in the analyses of circulating-fuel reactors
to take 8/8, to be just the fraction of the ith group which is emitted
inside the core. This implies that the importance of the delayed neutrons
is equal to that of the prompt neutrons; which would be true if the ine
crease in importance due to lower source energies exactly offset the de-
crease due to the distortion of the spatial distribution in the core.

The further approximation is usually made in computing the fraction emitted
in the core that the precursor production is uniform over the core volume.
We shall seek to improve the evaluation of B, by calculating more accu=
rately the spatial distribution of precursors and by taking into account
more explicitly the effect of the spatial and energy distributions on the
importance of the delayed neutrons.

In a discussion of fixed~-fuel reactors; Krasik quotes Hurwitz as de-
fining 8/8, as "essentially the probability that a delayed neutron of
the ith kind will produce a fission divided by the probability that a

prompt neutron will produce a fission," and adds that "for a simple re-
actor this probability is given by the ratio of the nonleakage probabil-
ities of the respective types of neutrons." Let us adopt the definition
of B,/B, as the ratio of the nonleskage probabilities. Suppose that the
nonleakage probability for prompt neutrons is L- and for the delayed
neutrons which are actually emitted in the core it is P,. Of a particular
group, only the fraction 0, is emitted in the core so the nonleakage prob-

ability for all neutrons of the ith group is ep, Therefore

The nonleakage probabilities can be expressed in a simple form if
the reactor is treated as a bare, homogeneous reactor. The source of
prompt neutrons in the reactor is proportional to the fission rate, which
follows closely the shape of the fundamental mode of the thermal neutron
flux. In a homogeneous, cylindrical, bare reactor this is:

@(r,z) = gg, (2.k r/R) sin(z/H) (2)

The spatial distributions of the delayed neutron sources are not the
same as that of the prompt neutrons because of the transport of the pre-
cursors in the circulating fuel. The source distributions can be calcu-
lated from power distribution, fuel velocities, system volumes, etc.
(This is done for a simple cylindrical reactor in the next section.) It
is convenient, for the purpose of calculating leakage probabilities, to
expand each source function in an infinite series:

QQ OO
8, (r,2) = 2 2 A, J (3.7/R) sin(nwz/H) (5)

where j is a root of J_ (x) = 0, (See Appendix for derivation of non-
leakage probabilities.) For neutrons with a source distribution

The approach we shall follow in calculating effective delayed neutron
fractions is then as follows: calculate the steady-state source distri=-
butions, 8S 4(rs2), in a bare, homogenized approximation of the MSRE core;
evaluate the coefficients, A; 3 compute B, from (10). By "bare, homo-
genized approximation" we mean a reactor in which the flux is assumed
to vanish at the physical boundary and in which the composition is uniform

 

Tt is assumed here that the fuel volume fraction, f, is not a
function of r. This is also implied in (2) and (3).
so that (2) applies.’ We shall also assume that the fuel velocity is

uniform over the entire core.

DERIVATION OF EQUATIONS

Steady-State Concentrations of Precursors

Let us derive the formulas for the steady-state concentration of the
precursor of a group of delayed neutrons as a function of position in the

core.
Begin by considering an elemental volume of fuel as it moves up
through a channel in the core. The precursor concentration in the fuel

as it moves along is governed by
de _
T° BvEp(r,2) = Ac (11)

The fuel rises through the channel with a constant velocity v so

depression sround the rod thimbles and because the flux does not vanish

Normalized Source Distributions

As explained on page 6 it is desirable to normalize the delayed
neutron source to one fission neutron so that the integral over the

core volume will equal PO. The rate of neutron production is

The digital programs for MSRE kinetics calculations (MURGATROYD
and ZORCH™ 0) have as an integral part the computation of delayed neutron
fractions from precursor yields and decay constants and the reactor
residence times, all of which are input numbers. The fraction computed
and used for each group is Py t 5 where Cs is given by equation G17).
Therefore, in order to have the kinetics calculations done with By for
the fractions, it is necessary to put in a fictitious value of By» equal

to B,/¢,

Effective Fraction in Noncirculating System

The change in the effective delayed neutron fraction between non-
circulating and circulating conditions is a factor in determining control
rod requirements.

In the noncirculating core, the source of delayed neutrons has the

RESULTS OF MSRE CALCULATIONS

The equations derived in the preceding section were used in calcu-
lations for a simplified model of the MSRE core. (See Appendix for data
used.) Results are summarized in Table 1. The table shows that the core
residence time, ih units of precursor half-lives, ranges from 0.2 for
the longest=-lived group to 41 for the shortest-lived group. Because of
this wide range, the shapes of the delayed neutron sources vary widely.
Figure 1 shows axial distributions at the radius where J (2. r/R) has
its average value, 0.4318. The source densities were normalized to a
production of one fission neutron in the reactor. For the longest-lived
group, the So term, which is flat in the radial direction, is by far the
largest. This term is relatively insignificant for groups 3-6. For the
very short-lived groups, the 5, term predominates, i.e., the shape ap-
proaches that of the fission distribution.

Figure 2 shows the twofold effect of circulation in reducing the
contribution of the largest group of delayed neutrons. The reduction
in the number of neutrons emitted in the core is indicated by the dif-
ference in the areas under the curves. The higher leakage probability
with the fuel circulating is suggested by the shift in the distribution,
which reduces the average distance the neutrons would travel in reaching

the outside of the core.

Expressions for Nonleakage Probabilities

distributed source of specified shape and initial energy will be absorbed
as a slow neutron in a cylindrical, bare reactor.

bution 8, (r,z). Use age treatment to describe slowing down, i.e.,

Data for MSRE Calculations

This section presents the data which were used in calculations for
the MSRE. It includes dimensions aad properties of the reactor and data

on delayed neutrons.
MSRE Dimensions

Reactor dimensions which are required are H, R, f, v (or t,) and t,

For R let us use 27.75 in., the inside radius of the INOR-8 can
around the core.

Assigning values to H and v is not simple, because the fission dis-
tribution extends past the limits of the graphite core into the —a
and lower heads. The axial distribution of the fission rate closely
follows sin(mz/H) where H is 77.7 in. The longest graphite stringers
are 68.9 in. long, and the channel region is only 62 in. Further com-
plicating the situation is the fact that outside of the channeled region,
the fuel velocity is lower than in the channels (because the volume
fraction of fuel is much higher in the end regions). There are also
radial variations in the fuel volume fraction and chammel velocity. (In
the central channels the fuel velocity is over three times the 0.60 ft/sec
which is found in more than three-fourths of the channels.) Let us use
the following simplifications. Consider the "core" to be bounded by the
horizontal planes at the extreme top and the extreme bottom of the graphite.
This gives H = 68.9 in. Enclosed by these boundaries is a total volume
of 96.4 £3, of which 25.0 £3 is occupied by fuel. Thus f = 0.259. The
residence time of fuel in the "core," at a flow rate of 1200 gpm, is 9.37
sec. The velocity, B/t,, is 0.61 ft/sec. The total volume of circulating
fuel is 69.1 3, for a total circuit time of 25.82 sec. Thus Tt, = 25.82
- 9.37 = 16.45 sec.

Precursor Yields and Half-Lives

For yields and half-lives of the delayed neutron groups, let us use
the data of Keepin, Wimett and Zeigler for fission of y232 by thermal neu-

Neutron Energies and Ages

The age of neutrons is given by

E
_ co D dE
T = J Gl = = (a20)

The age of prompt neutrons, which have an initial mean energy of about
2 Mev, is about 292 on’ in the MSRE core at 1200°F. 2 Let us estimate

the age to thermal energy of the delayed neutrons as follows.

E N E
. (XD o 4&6 _ ( D_ _° a2l)
te &) Je, E (&) “ Ben
5%av av
Therefore use the approximation that
in (E/E)

T, = In (E_JE J T (a22)
i in Bor En pr

The average energy of thermal neutrons at 1200°F is 0.119 ev.

Goldstein > reviewed the data on delayed neutron energies and
recommended values for the first five groups. His values are given
in Table A-2, together with values of Ts calculated from (a22). No ex-
perimental values for the mean energy of the shortest-lived group are

available, so a value of 0.5 Mev was assumed.

This number is the ratio D/Z for fast neutrons calculated by
MODRIC, a multigroup diffusion calculation.

Neutron Diffusion Length

In the main body of the MSRE core the square of the diffusion length
for thermal neutrons is 210 orf. Tais is for the core at 1200°F, contain-

ing fuel with no thorium and sbout 0.15 mole percent uranium.
