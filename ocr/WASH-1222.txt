AN EVALUATION OF THE MOLTEN SALT BREEDER REACTOR

| I INTRODUCTION SEE |
The Division of “Reactor | Development and Technology, usec, was assigned
| the responsibility of assessing the status of the technology of the

| Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (NSBR) as part of the Federal Council of
Science and Technology Research and Developnent Goals Study. In,
conducting this review, the attractive features and problen areas
associated with the concept have been examined; but more importantly,
the assessment has been directed to provide a view of the ‘technology
and engineering development efforts and the associated goverment and
‘industrial commitments which vould be required to develop the MSER

into. a safe, reliable and econonte power source for central station

oo application. | :
The 'MSER concept, t, currently um under rudy at the oak Ridge Rational
Laboratory (ORNL), is based on use of a circulating fluid fuel

reactor coupled with on-line cont tauous fuel processing. As presently
: envisioned, 1 would operate ‘as a thernal spectrun reactor systen
uttltztag a thoriun-uranium fuel cycle. Thus, the concept would offer
the potential for broadened uetltzation of the aatton' 8 natural

resources through operation of a ‘breeder system : employing another

fereile material (thortun tnstead of uranium).

 

‘The long-term objective of any nev reactor concept. and the. incentive for

“the goverment to’ support” ts  developuent are to help provide a self-

Ca

sustaining, competitive industrial capability for producing economical
power in a relisble and safe manner. A basic part of achievement of
this objective 1s to gain public acceptance of a new form of power
production. Success in such an endeavor 1s required to permit the
utilities and others to consider the concept as a viable option for
generating electrical power in the future and to consider making the
heavy, long-term commitments of resources in funds, facilities and
personnel needed to provide the traasition from the early experimental

facilities and demonstration plants to full scale commercial reactor

power plant systems.

Consistent with the policy established for all power reactor development
programs, the MSBR would require the successful accomplishment of three

basic research and development phases:

; An initial research and development phase in which the basic
technical aspects of the MSBR concept are confirmed, tavolving
exploratory development, laboratory experiment, and conceptual
engineering. |

. A second phase in which the engineering and manufacturing
capabilities are developed. This includes the conduct of

. in-depth engineering and prooftesting of first-of-a-kind
components, equipment and systems. These would then be.

incorporated into experimental installations and supporting

 
~3-

\U test facilities to assure adequate understanding of design
and performance characteristics, as well as to gain overall
experience associated with major operational, economic and
environmental parameters. As these research and development
efforts progress, the technological uncertainties would need
to be resolved and decision points reached that would permit

- development to proceed with necessary confidence. = When the
technology is sufficiently developed and confidence in the
system was attained, the next stage would be the construc-

. tiom of large demonstration plants.

. A third phase in which the utilities make large scale commitments
to electric generating plants by developing the capability to
manage the design, construction, test and operation of these

power plants in a safe, reliable, economic, and environmentally

-- acceptable manner.

 

Significant experience with the Light Water Reactor (LWR), the High

Temperature Gas—cooled Reactor (HTGR) and the Liquid Metal-cooled Fast

 

‘Breeder Reactor (LMFBR) bas been gained over the past two decades
pertaining to the ‘efforts that are required to’ develop and advance
nuclear reactors to the point of public and coumercial acceptance.
This experience has clearly demonstrated that the phases of develop

ment and demonstration ‘should be sintlar regardless. of the energy oo

concept being explored; that the Togteal progression through each of

 
 

-4-

the phases is essential; ‘and that completing the work through the
three phases 1s an extremely difficult, tine consuming and costly
undertaking, requiring the highest level of technical management,
professional competence and organizational skills. This has again
been demonstrated by the recent experience in the expanding LWR
design, construction and licensing activities which emphasize clearly
the need for even stronger technology and engineering efforts than
‘were initially provided, although these were satisfactory in many
cases for the first experiments and demonstration plants. The LMFBR
program, which is relatively well advanced in its development, tracks
closely this INR experience and has further reinforced this need as it
applies to the technology, development and engineering application

areas.

It should also be kept in mind that the large backlog of commitments
and the shortage of qualified engineering and technical management
personnel and prooftest facilities in the government, in industry and
in the utilities make it even more necessary that all the reactor
systems be thoroughly designed and tested before additional significant
commitment to, and construction of, commercial power plants are _.
initiated.

. With regard to the MSER, prelintnary reactor destgus vere evaluated in

———— research and developnent on molten sale ron has

been performed ¢ to date. The program 1s currently funded at a level

of $5 nillion per year. - Expenditures to date on molten salt reactor
technology both for military and civilian power applications have

amounted to approxinately $150 million of which approxinately $70 mi 1lton

has been in support. of central station paver Plants. These efforts date

back to the 190%. -

 

In cons dering. the HSER for central station power plant application, it

ts moted that this concept has several ontque and desirable features:

a ‘the same etme, 1 1s charactertzed by. both complex technological and

 
 

-6-

practical engineering problems which are specific to flutd fueled
reactors and for which solutions have not been developed. Thus,

this concept introduced major concerns that are different in kind and
magnitude from those commonly associated with solid fuel breeder
reactors. The development of satisfactory experineatal units and
further consideration of this concept for use as a commercial sever
plant will require resolution of these as well as other problems which

are common to all reactor concepts.

As part of the AEC's Systems Analysis Task Force (AEC report
'WASH-1098) and the "Cost-Benefit Analysis of the U. S. Breeder |
: Reactor Program” (AEC reports WASH-1126 and WASH-1184), studies
were conducted on the cost and benefit of developing another
breeder system, "parallel" to the LMFER. The consistent conclu-
sion reached in these studies is that sufficient information is |
available to indicate that the projected benefits from the LMFBR
program can support a parallel breeder program. However, these
results are highly sensitive to the assumptions on plant capital
costs with the recognition, even among concepts in which ample
experience exists, that capital costs and especially small estimated
differences in costs are * highly speculative for plants to be built
15 or 20 vears from now. Therefore, 1t is questionable | whether
analyses based upon ‘such costs should constitute a major basts for
making decisions relative to the destrability of a parallel breeder

effort.

Experience in reactor development programs in this country and abroad

has demonstrated that different organizations, in evaluating the projected
: )

costs of introducing a reactor development program and carrying it forward
to the point of large scale commercial utilization, would arrive at
different estimates of the methods, scope of development and engineering
efforts, and the costs and time required to bring that program to a stage
of successful large scale application and public ‘acceptance. oC
Based upon ‘the AEC's experience with Sther complex reactor development
programs, it is estimated that a total government {investment up to Co
about 2 billion dollars in undiscounted direct costsk could be required
to bring the molten salt breeder or ey parailel breeder to fruition as
a viable, comercial pover reactor. A magnitude of funding up. to this
level could be needed to establish the necessary technology and
engineering bases; obtain the required industrial capability: and

as a major energy option for central station power generation in the

II. SUMMARY
The MSBR concept is a thermal spectrum, fluid fuel reactor which
operates on the thorium-uranium fuel cycle and when coupled with

on-line fuel processing has the potential for breeding at a

meaningful level. The marked differences in the concept as compared: -
‘to solid fueled reactors, make the MSER a distinctive alternate.
Although the concept has attractive features, there are a number of

difficult development problems that must be resolved; many of these

are unique to the MSBR while others are pertinent to any complex

reactor. system.

The technical effort acconplished since the publication of WASH-1097
and WASH-1098 has identified and further defined the problem areas;
however, this work has not advanced the program beyond the initial
phase of research and development. Although progress has been made
in several areas (e.g., reprocessing and improved graphite), new
problems not addressed in WASH-1097 have arisen which could affect :

the practicality of designing and operating a MSER. Examples of

major uncertainties relate to materials of construction, methods for

control of tritium, and the design of components and systems along
with their special handling, inspection and maintenance equipment.
Considerable research and development efforts are required in order

to obtain the data necessary to resolve the uncertainties. -

 
-9-

Assuming that practical solutions to these problems can be found, a
further assessment would have to be made as to the advisability of
proceeding to the next stage of the development program. “In advancing
to the next phase, it would be necessary to: develop a greatly expanded
industrial and utility participation and commitment along with a
substantial increase in' government support. ‘Such broddened involve-
ment would require an evaluation of the MSBR in terns of already
existing commitments to other nuclear power and high priority energy

development efforts. Lr i. ST ene

ITI. RESOURCE UTILIZATION
It has long been recognized that the importance of nuclear fuels for
power production depends initially on the utilization of the ‘naturally
occurring fissile U-235; but it is the more abundant fertile materials,
U-238 and Th-232, which will be the najor source of nuclear power
generated in the future. The basic physics characteristics of fissile
plutonium produced from U-238 offer the potential for high breeding
gains in fast reactors, and the potential to expand greatly the
utilization of uranium resources by making feasible the utilization of
additional vast quantities of otherwise uneconomic low grade ore. In
a similar manner, the basic physics characteristics of the thorium .
cycle will permit full utilization of the nation's thorium resources
vhile at the same time offering the potential for breeding in thermal

reactors.

The estimated thorium reserves are sufficient to supply the world's
. electric energy needs for many hundreds of years if the thorium is
used in a high gain breeder reactor. It is projected that if this
quantity of thorium vere used in a breeder reactor, approximately

18 Btu) would be realized from this fertile material.

1000 Q (1 Q = 10
It is estimated that the uranium reserves would also supply 1000 Q*

of energy if the uranium were used in LMFBRs. In contrast, only 20 Q

would be available if thorium were used as the fertile material in
an advanced converter reactor because the reactor vould be dependent
upon U-235 availability for fissile inventory make-up. (Note: a
| conservative estimate 1s that between 20 and 30 Q will be used for

electric power generation between now and the year 2100.)

Iv. HISTORICAL DEVELOPMENT OF MOLTEN SALT REACTORS
The fnvestigation of molten salt reactors began in the late 1940's as
part of the U.S. Afrcraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) Program. Subsequently,
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE) was built at Oak Ridge and in 1954
it was operated successfully for nine dave at power levels up to
2.5 MW(th) and fuel outlet temperatures up to 1580°F. The ARE fuel was a
mixture of NaF, ZrF,, and UF,. The moderator was Be0" and the: piping and

vessel were constructed of Inconel.

In 1956, ORNL began to study molten salt reactors for application as
central station converters and breeders. These studies concluded that
graphite moderated, thermal spectrum reactors operating on a thor ium-
uranium cycle were most attractive for economic power production. “Based
on the technology at that time, it was thought that a two-fluid reactor
io which the fertile and fissile salts were kept separate was required
in order to have a breeder system. The single fluid reactor, while not
a breeder, appeared simpler in design and also seemed to have the

potential for low power costs.

over the next few years, ORNL continued to study both the two fluid and
‘single fluid concepts, and in 1960 the design of the single fluid

‘8 MW(th) Molten Salt Reactor Experiment {MSRE) was begun. The MSRE was
completed in 1965 and operated successfully during the period 1965 to

1969. The MSRE experience is treated in more detail in a later section.

 
-13-

Concurrent with the construction of the MSRE, ORNL performed research
and development on means for processing molten salt fuels, In 1967

new discoveries were made which suggested that a single fluid reactor

could be combined with continuous on-line fuel processing to become a

breeder system. Because of the mechanteal design Problems of the two
fluid concept and the laboratory-scale development of processes which
would permit ‘on-line reprocessing, it was deternined that a shift tn
enphasts to the single flutd breeder concept should be made; this

-

system 1s betng studied at the present. Co

V. MOLTEN SALT BREEDER REACTOR CONCEPT DESCRIPTION

The breeding reactions of the thorium cycle are:

232 S233 B 233 8 233
——————————— ’
Th + pe" pu. © Cw.

Because of the number of neutrons produced per neutron absorbed and the
small fast fission bonus associated with U-233 and Th-232 in the
thermal spectrum, a breeding ratio only slightly greater than unity 1s
achievable. In order to realize breeding with the thorium evele it is
necessary to remove the bred Pa-233 and the various nuclear poisons
produced by the fission process from the high flux region as quickly as
possible. The Molten Salt Breeder Reactor concept permits rapid removal
of Pa-233 and the nuclear poisons (e.g. Xe-135 and the rare earth
elements). The reactor is a fluid fueled system containing UF, and
ThF, dissolved in LiF - BeF,. The molten fuel salt flows through a
graphite moderator where the nuclear reactions take place. A side
stream is continuously processed to remove the Pa and rare earth
elements, thereby permitting the achievement of a calculated breeding

ratio of about 1.06.
The MSBR is attractive because of the following:

1. Use of a fluid fuel and on-site processing would eliminate the

problems of solid fuel fabrication and the handling, and

 
2,

~The MSBR is projected to have attractive fuel cycle costs.

associated with all other reactor types under active

consideration.

MSBR operation on the thorium-uranium fuel cycle would help

conserve uranium and thorium resources by utilizing thorium-.

“reserves with high efficiency. -

No

The major uncertainty in the fuel cycle cost is associated oo
with the cont fnuous. fuel processing plant which has not. been

developed.

The safety 1 tssues assoctated with the MSER are renerally

different from those of solid fuel reactors. Thus, there
might be safety advantages for the MSBER when considering )
major accidents. An accurate assessment of MSBR safety 1s

not possible today because of the early state of development.

Like other advanced reactor systems such as the LMFBR and
HIGR, the MSBR would employ modern steam technology for power
generation with high thermal efficiencies. This would reduce

the amount of waste heat to be discharged to the environment.

 

 

 

 

 
-16-
Selected conceptual design data for a large MSBR, based primarily on \ rl

design studies performed at ORNL, are given in Table I.

There are, however, problem areas associated with the MSER which must
be overcome before the potential of the: concept could be attained.
These include development of continuous fuel processing, reactor and
processing structural materials, tritium: control methods, reactor
equipment and systems, maintenance techniques, safety technology, and
MSBR codes and standards. Each of these problem areas will now be
evaluated in some detail, using as a reference point the technology
which was demonstrated by the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE)
during its design, construction and operation at Oak Ridge and the
conceptual design parameters presented in Table I and in Appendix A.

A conceptual flowsheet for this system is shown in Figure 1.

VI. STATUS OF MSBR TECHNOLOGY

 

MSRE - The Reference Point for Current, Technology

The Molten Salt Reactor . Experiment 0ssRE) was begun in 1960 at

ORNL as part of the Civilian Nuclear Paver Program. The purpose

of the exper ment was to demonstrate the basic feasibility of
molten salt power ‘reactors. All objectives of the experiment
were achieved during its successful operation from June 1965 to
December 1969. “These included the distinction of becoming the
first reactor in the world to operate solely on U-233. ‘Some of
the more significant dates and statistics pertinent to the MSRE

are given in Table II.

In spite of the success of the MSRE, there are many areas of molten

salt technology which must be expanded and developed in order to

proceed from this small non-breeding expertnent to a sate, reliable,

and economic 1000 wie) MSER with a 30-year life. To illustrate

this point, some of the most. : important differences in baste destan

and performance characteristics between the MSRE and a conceptual

1000 MW(e) MSBR are given in Table III. Scale-up would logically
be accomplished through development of reactor plants of increasing

size. Examination of Table III provides an appreciation of the

scale-up requirements in going from the MSRE to a large MSBR. Some

- problems associated with progressing from a small experiment to a

commercial, high performance power plant are not adequately

represented by the comparison presented in the Table. - Therefore,

it is useful to examine additional facets of MSER technology in

more

detail.

Continuous Fuel Processing — The Key to Breeding

 

In order to achieve nuclear breeding in the single fluid MSBR it

1s necessary to have an on-line continuous fuel processing system.

This

would accomplish the following:

Isolate protactinium-233 from the reactor enviroment so it

- can decay into the fissile fuel isotope uranium-233 before

ae

being transmuted into other isotopes by neutron irradiation.

Remove undesirable neutron poisons from the fuel salt and
thus improve the neutron economy and breeding performance
of the system.

Control the fuel chemistry and remove excess uranium-233

which is to be exported from the breeder system.

Chemical Process Development

 

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory has proposed a fuel _.

b. Reductive extraction of protactinium by contacting the

Ce. Metal transfer processing to preferentially remove the
rare earth fission product poisons which would otherwise

The fuel processing system shown in Fig. 2 is in an early stage
of development at present and this type of system has not been
demonstrated on an operating reactor. By comparison, the MSRE

required only off-line, batch fluorination to recover uranium

_ from fuel salt.

At this time, the basic chemistry involved in the MSBR

processing scheme has been demonstrated in laboratory scale
experiments. Current efforts at Oak Ridge are bens. directed

toward development of subsystems incorporating many of the

required processing steps. Ultimately a complete breeder
processing experiment would be required to demonstrate the
system with all the chenical conditions and" operational

requirements which would be. encountered with any MSBR.

- they collect fission product ‘xenon, and then removing the

bubbles and xenon from the reactor system. Xenon is a highly

undesirable neutron poison. which will. hamper breeding: perform-

- ance by capturing neutrons which vould otherwise breed new

fuel. This concept for xenon stripping was ‘demonstrated: in

principle by the MSRE, although more efficient and controllable
stripping systems vill be desirable for the MSBR. The xenon

poisoning in the MSRE was reduced by a factor of six by xenon

stripping; the goal for the MSER is a factor of ten reductiocn.

Fuel Processing Structural Materials =

Aside from the chemical processes themselves, there are also

development requirements associated with containment materials

for the fuel processing systems. .In particular, liquid bismuth

presents difficult compatibility problems with most. structural

metals, and present efforts are concentrated on using molybdenum

and. graphite for ‘containing. bismuth, Unfortunately, both
molybdenum and graphite are: difficult to use for such: engineering

1a PLETE. Thus, it will be necessary to. develop improved

techniques for fabrication and joining. before their: ‘use 1s

possible in the reprocessing system, Ea ae

 

 
Cc.

-26-

A second materials problem of the current fuel processing system \’
is the containment for the fluorination step in which uranium is
volatilized from the fuel salt.” The fluorine and fluoride salt

mixture is corrosive to most structural materials, including

graphite, and present ORNL flowsheets show a "frozen wall"

fluorinator vhich operates with ‘a protective layer of frozen

fuel salt covering a Hastelloy-N vessel wall. This component

would require considerable engineering development before it is

truly practical for use in on-line full processing systens.

Molten Salt Reactor Design ~ Materials Requirements

In concept, the molten salt reactor core is a comparatively
uncomplicated type of heat source. The MSRE reactor core, for
example, consisted of a prismatic structure of unclad graphite
moderator through which fuel salt flowed to be heated by the
self-sustaining chain reaction which took place as long as the
Balt was in the graphite. The ‘entire reactor internals and fuel
salt were contained in vessels and piping made of Hastelloy-N, a
high strength nickel base alloy which was developed under the
Afrcraft Nuclear Propulsion Program. Over the four-year lifetime
of the MSRE, the reactor structural materials performed satis-
factorily for the purposes of the experiments although operation

of the MSRE revealed possible problems with long term use of

 
 

 

-27-
Hastelloy-N in contact with fuel salts containing fission

products.

. The MSBR application is more demanding in many respects than the
MSRE, and additional development work would be required in
‘several areas of materials technology before suitable materials

could become available.

1. Fuel and Coolant Salts.

The MSRE fuel salt was a mixture of TL1P-BeF-2rF ~UF, in

4 4
proportions of 65.0-29.1-5.0-0.9 mole %, respectively.
Zirconium fluoride vas included as protection against UO,
precipitation should inadvertent oxide contamination of the
. system occur, MSRE operation indicated that control of
oxides was not a major problem and thus it is not considered
necessary to include zirconium in future molten salt reactor
‘fuels. It should also be noted that the MSRE fuel contained
no thorium whereas the proposed MSER fuels would include

~ thorium as the fertile material for breeding. With the

possible exception of incompatibilities with Hastelloy-N,
the MSRE fuel salt performed satisfactorily throughout the
life of the reactor. . |

The MSER fuel salt, as currently proposed by ORNL, would be a

mixture of 'LiF-BeF,~ThF,-UF, in proportions of 71.7-16-12-0.3

-28-
mole 1, respectively. This salt has a melting potat of about ~
930°F and a vapor pressure of less then 0.1 mm Hg at the mean
~ operating temperature of 1150°F. It also has about 3.3 times
the density and 10 times the viscosity of water. Its thermal
conductivity and volumetric heat capacity are comparable to
water,

The high melting temperature 1s an obvious imitation for a
system using this salt, and the MSBR is limited to high
temperature operation. In addition, the lithium component
must be enriched in Li-7.4n order to allow nuclear breeding,
‘since naturally occurring lithium contains’ about 7.5% L1-6.
© L1-6 1s undesirable in the MSBR because of its tendency to

" ‘capture neutrons, thus penalizing breeding performance.

The chemical and physical characteristics of the proposed
MSBR fuel mixture have been and are being investigated, and
they are reasonably well known for unirradiated salts. The
major unknowns are associated with the reactor fuel after it
“has been irradiated. For example, not enough is known about
the behavior of fission products. The ability to predict
fission product behavior is important to plant safety,
operation, and maintenance. While the MSRE provided much

useful information, there is still a need for more information,

o

 
-29-

‘particularly vith regard to the fate of the so-called "noble
metal” fission products such as molybdenum, niobium and
others which are generated: in substantial quantities and

‘whose behavior in" the’ systen is not well understood.

A more complete understanding of the physical/chemical
characteristics of the irradiated fuel sale is also needed.

As an 111ustration of this point, anomalous power pulses were
observed durtog early operation of the MSRE with U-233 fuel
“which s were attributed to LNAI behavior of helen gas
"bubbles a as they ctreulated through the reactor. "This
"behavior 1 is believed to > have been due to some physical and/or
chemical characteristics of the fuel salt which were never
fully understood. Out-of-reactor work or on molten fuel salt
fission product chemistry 1s currently under way. Eventually,
the behavior of the fuel salt vould need to be confirmed in an

‘operating reactor. ~

he. coolant salt in the secondary system of the MSRE was of

7

molar composition 661 "LeF-3438eT,. While this coolant

“performed satisfactorily (no. detectable :corrosion or reaction
;-could be observed in the secondary system), the salt has a
. high melting temperature (850°F) and is relatively expensive.

Thus, it may not be ‘the appropriate choice for power reactors

 
 

-30-

for two reasons: (1) larger volumes of coolant salt will be

“used to generate steam in the MSBR, and (2) salt temperatures

in the steam generator should be low enough, if possible, to
utilize conventional steam system technology vith feedwater
temperatures up to about 550°F. The operation of MSRE was

less affected by the coolant salt melting temperature since

it dumped the 8 MW (th) of heat via an air-cooled radiator.

The high melting temperatures of potential coolant salts

remain a problem. The current choice is a eutectic mixture

of sodium fluoride and sodium fluoroborate with a molar

composition of 8% NaF-92% NaBF, ; this salt melts at 725°F.
It is comparatively inexpensive and has satisfactorv heat

transfer properties.

However, the effects of heat exchanger leaks between the
coolant and fuel salts, and between the coolant salt and
stean systems, must be shown to be tolerable. The
fluoroborate salt is currently being studied with respect

to both its chemistry and compatibility with Hastelloy-N.

-

Reactor Fuel Containment Materials

i

A prerequisite to success for the MSBR would be the ability

to assure reliable and ‘safe containment and handling of molten

 
-31-

fuel salts at all times during the life of the reactor. It

woild be necessary, therefore, to develop suitable contain-

ment materials for MSBR application before plants could be

constructed,

A serious question concerning compatability of Hastelloy-N with

the constituents of irradiated fuel salt was raised by the post-

operation examination of the MSRE.in 1971. “Although the MSRE
materials performed satisfactorily for that system during {its
operation, subsequent examination of metal which was exposed to

MSRE fuel salt revealed that the alloy had experienced inter-

granular attack to depths of about 0.007 inch. The attack was
"not obvious until metal specimens were tensile tested, at which
time cracks opened up as the metal was strained. Further
examination revealed that several fission products, including
tellurium, had penetrated the metal to depths comparable to
those of the cracks. At the present time, it is thought that

"the intergranular attack was due to the presence of tellurium.

Subsequent laboratory tests have verified that tellurium can

‘produce, under certain conditions, intergranular cracking in

Hastelloy N.° ~~ °

© Although the limited penetration of cracks presented no problems

for the MSRE, concern now exists with respect to the chemical

 

 
-32-

compatability of Hastelloy-N and MSBR fuel salts when subjected
to the more stringent MSER requirements of higher power density
and 30-year life. If the observed intergranular attack was
indeed due to fission product attack of the Hastelloy-N, then
this material may not. be suitable for either the piping or the
vessels which would be exposed to much higher fission product

- concentrations for longer periods of time. Efforts are under
way to understand and explain the cracking problem, and to
determine whether alternate reactor containment materials

should be actively considered.

In addition to the intergranular corrosion problem, the standard
Hastelloy-N used in the MSRE is not suitable for use in the MSBR
because its mechanical properties deteriorate to an unacceptable
level when subjected to the higher neutron doses which would

occur in the higher power density, longer-life MSBR. The problem

is thought to be due mainly to impurities in the metal which are

transmuted to helium when exposed to thermal neutrons. The helium
is believed to cause a deterioration of mechanical properties by

its presence at grain boundaries within the alloy. It would be

necessary to develop a modified Hastelloy-N with improved irradia-

tion resistance for the MSBR, and some progress is being made in
that direction. It appears at this time that small additions of

certain elements; such as titanium, improve the irradiation.

performance of Hastelloy-N substantially. Development work on

modified alloys with improved irradiation resistance is

currently under way.

Graphite

Additional developmental effort on two problems is required to

"produce graphites suitable for “SBR application. The first is

associated with rradiation damage to graphite structures which
results from fast neutrons. ‘Under high neutron doses, of the

order of 1072 ‘neutrons fen’, most sraphites tend to become

dimensionally unstable and gross” swelling of “the material occurs.

Based on ‘tests of small graphite samples at ORNL, the best .

commercially available ‘graphites at this time may be usable to

22

sbout 3 x 10 neutrons/en’ before the core rraphite would have

to be replaced. This corresponds to “roughly a four-year graphite

| lfetine for the oriL reference destzn. ‘While this might be

acceptable, there are stall uncertatnties about -the fabrication

and performance of Large seaphite pteces, and addittonel work

vould be required before a four-year Life ‘could be assured at

oo the higher MSBR power densities now being considered. In any

_ event, there would be an obvious economic, Ancentive. to develop

Le longer Lived sraphites for MSBR application since a four-year

life for graphite ts estinated to represent a fuel evele cost

 

 
 

-34-
penalty of about 0.2 mills/kw-hr relative to a system with

thirty year sraphite life.

The second major problem associated with graphites for MSBR

application is the development of a sealing technique which

will keep xenon, an undesirable neutron poison, from diffusing

into the core graphite where it can capture neutrons to the

4.

detriment of breeding performance. While graphite sealing

. may not be necessary to achieve nuclear breeding in the MSBR,

the use of sealed graphite would certainly enhance breeding
performance. ‘The economic incentives or penalties of graphite
sealing cannot be assessed until a suitable sealing process 1s

developed.

Sealing methods which have been tavestisated to date include

pyrolytic carbon coating and carbon tmpregnaton. Thus far,

however, no sealed graphite that has been tested remained

sutfictently tnperneable to gas at MSER design trradtation

doses, and research and developnent in this area is continuing.

Other Structural Materials
In addition to the structural materials requirements for the

reactor and fuel processing systems proper, there are other

‘components and systems which have special materials require-

ments. Such components as the primary heat exchangers and

 

 
 

 

 

 

3%

_ steam generators. must function“vhile in contact with two

- different working fluids. - [a

i ae the present tine, Hastelloy-N 1s considered to be the most
| promising material for use in all salt containment systems,
including the secondary piping and components. Research to date
indicates that sodium fluorcborate and Rastelloy-N are compat-
ible as ong, as the vater content of the fluorcborate 1s kept
low; othervise, accelerated corrosion can occur. Additional

testing would be needed and 1s undervay.

Hastelloy~N' has not been adequately evaluated for service under
a range of steam conditions and whether it will be a suitable

material for use in steam generators is still not known.

PD. Tritium - A Problem of Control
Because of the lithium present in fluoride fuel salts, the present MSBR
concept has the inherent problem of generating tritium, a radioactive
isotope of hydrogen. Tritium is produced by the following reactions:
(2) 74 (n,an) 3.
Due primarily to these interactions, tritium would be produced at a rate

of about 2400 curies/day in a 1000 Mie MSER. This compares with about

 
~36-

40 to 59 curies/dav for lipht water, gas-conled, and fast hreeder
reactors, tn which tritium is produced primarily as a low vield fission
product. Tritium production in heavy water reactors of comnarable size
is generally in the range 3500 to 5800 curies/dav, due to neutron fnter-
actions with the deuterium present in heavy water. |

:

To: further compound the problem tritium diffuses readily threush |
Hastellov-N at elevated temperatures. As a result, it mav be d1FFIenlt
to prevent tritium from d1f Fusing through the pipine and components of
the SBR system (such as heat exchanners) and eventually reachine the

steam system where {t might be discharred te the environment as tritiated

water.

The problem of tritium control in the “SBR is being studied in detail at
NPNHL. The following are being considered as potential methods for

tritium control:

1. Exchanging the tritium for anv hvdroren present in the secondary :

conlant, therebv retaining the tritium {n the secondarv coolant.

2. Using, coatings on metal surfaces in order to inhibit tritium

diffusion.

E. Reactor Equipment and Systems Development

While the MSPR would utilize some existing engineering technology from

other reactor types, there are specific components and systems for which

additional development work is required. Such work would have to take

into account the induced activity that those components would accumulate

in the MSBR system, i.e., special handling and maintenance equipment would

also need to be developed. The previous discussion has already dealt

with a number of these, such as fuel processing components and systems,

but additional discussion is sppropriate.

1,

Components :

As {indicated in the Table III, a number of components must be
scaled up substantially from the MSRE sizes before a large MSBR
is possible. The development of these larger components along
with their special handling and maintenance equipment is prob-
ably one of the most difficult and costly phases of MSBR
development, However, reliable, safe, and maintainable
components would need to be developed in order for any reactor

system to be a success,

The MSBR pumps would likely be similar in basic design to those

for the MSRE, namely, vertical shaft, overhung impeller pumps,

 
-39-

“Substantial experience has been gained over the years in the
design, fabrication and operation of smaller salt pumps, but
“the size would have to be increased substantially for MSBR
application. The ‘development and proof testing of such units
~~ along with their handling and maintainence equipment and test

facilities are expected to be costly and time Consuming.

The intermediate heat exchangers for the MSBR must perform with
a minimum of salt {inventory in order to improve the breeding
performance by lowering the fuel inventory.” Special surfaces to
* enhance heat transfer would help achieve this, and more studies
- would be in order. Based on previous experience with other reactor
‘systems; it is believed that these units would require a diffi-

* cult development and proof testing effort. ~~

. The steam generator for MSER applications is probably: the most
difficult large component to develop since it represents an
item for vhich there has been alnost no experience to date. It

“is believed that a difficult developient and proof testing pro-
© gram would be needed to provide reliable and maintainable units.

"As discussed previously, the high melting temperatures of

: “candidate secondary coolants, such as sodium fluorcborate,

7°" present probleus of matching with conventional steam system

* technology. -At this time, central station power plants utilize

 
 

-40-

feedwater temperatures only up to about 550°F. Therefore,
coupling a conventional feedvater system to a secondary
coolant which freezes at 725°F presents obvious problems in
design and control. It might be necessary to provide modifi-
cations to conventional steam system designs to help resolve
the problems. - Because of these factors, a study related to
the design of steam generators has been initiated at Foster

_ Wheeler Corporation.

Control rods and drives for the MSER would also need to be

. developed. The MSRE control rods were air cooled and operated
inside Hastelloy-N thimbles which protruded down into the fuel
salt. The MSER would require more efficient cooling due to the
- higher power densities involved. Presumably rods and drives
would be needed which permit the rods to contact and be cooled

by the fuel salt.

- The salt valves for large MSBR's represent another development
problem, although the freeze valve concept which was employed
successfully in the MSRE could likely be scaled up in size and
utilized for many MSBR applications. Mechanical throttling
vdlves would also be needed for the MSBR salt systems, even

.. though no throttling valve was used with the MSRE. Mechanical
shutoff valves for salt systems, if required, would have to be

developed.

 
 

-41-

+ Other components which would require considerable engineering

2.

development and testing ‘include: the helium bubble generators and

‘gas strippers which are proposed for use in removing the fission

" product xenon from ‘the fuel salt. ' Research and development in

this area is currently under way as part of the technology

program at ORNL. -

Systems

The integration of all required components into a complete MSBR

central station power plant would involve a number of systems for

which development ‘work is still required. It should be noted

that some components, such as ‘pumps ‘end control rod drives, would
require their own individual systems for functions such as

"cooling and lubrication. = °

+ Given the required: ‘components - and materials of construction, the

baste reactor primary ‘and secondary flow systems can be designed.

However, the primary flow system would require supporting systems

for continous fuel Processing, © on-line fuel analysis and control

sof salt chemistry, reactor control ‘and: safety, handling of radio-

active gases, fuel draining from every possible holdup area in .

"components ‘and equipment, afterheat control, and temperature

control during non-nuclear operations.

 

 

 
 

-42-

‘The continuous fuel processing. systems proposed to date are

quite complicated and include a number of subsystens, all of
which would have to operate satisfactorily within the constraints
of economics, safety, and reliability. The effects of off-design
conditions on these systems would have ‘to be understood so that
control vould be possible to prevent inadvertent contamination

of the primary system by undesirable materials.

The fuel drain system is important to both operation and safety
+. since it would be used to contain the molten fuel whenever a
need arises to drain the primary system or any component or
‘instrument for maintainence or inspection. Thus, additional
systems would be required, each with its own system for
maintaining and controlling temperatures. The fuel salt drain
tank would have to be equipped with an auxiliary cooling system
capable of rejecting about 18 MW(th) of heat should the need

arige to drain the salt immediately following nuclear operation.

The secondary coolant system would also require subsystems for
draining and controlling of salt chemistry and temperature. In
~ addition, the secondary loop might require systems to control
tritium and to handle the consequences of steam generator or

heat exchanger leaks.

 
 

 

 

-43-

The steam system for the MSR might require a departure from -
conventional designs due to the unique problems associated with
using a coolant having a high melting temperature. Precautions
‘would have to be taken against freezing the secondary salt as it
travels through the steam generator; suitable methods for system
startup and control would need to be incorporated. ORNL has
‘proposed the uze of a supercritical steam system which operates
at 3500 psia and provides 700°F feedwater by mixing of supercritical
steam and high pressure feedwater. This system would introduce

major new development requirements because it differs from
conventional steam cycles.

 

F. Maintenance - A Difficult Problem for the MSER

Unlike solid fueled reactors in which the primary system contains
“activation products and only those fission products which may leak from
defective fuel pins, the MSBR' would have the bulk of the fission products
dispersed throughout the reactor systen. Because of this dispersal of
radioactivity, remote techniques vould be required for many maintenance
functions if the reactor were to have an acceptable plant availability in

the utility environment.

The 1 MSRE was designed for remote maintenance of highly radioactive
components ; however, no > major matntenance problems (femoval or ‘repair of

large components) were encountered after nuclear operation was ‘initiated.

 

 

 
 

-44-
Thus, the degree to which the MSRE experience on maintenance is So

applicable to large commercial breeder reactors is open to question.

as has been evident in plant layout work on nuclear facilities to date,
this requirement for remote maintenance will significantly affect the
ultimate design and performance of the plant system. The MSER would
require remote techniques and tools for inspection,’ welding and cutting
of pipes, mechanical assembly and disassembly of components and systems,
- and removing, transporting and handling large component items after they
become highly radioactive. _The removal and replacement of core
internals, such as graphite, might pose d1£FLcult maintenance problems
because of the high radiation levels involved and the contamination

protection which would be required whenever the primary system is opened.

Another potential problem 1s the afterheat generation by aston products
which deposit in components such as the primary heat exchangers.
Auxiliary cooling might be required to prevent damage when the fuel salt is
drained from the primary system, and a requirement for such cooling would

further complicate inspection and maintenance operations,

In some cases, the inspection and maintenance problems of the MSBR could
be solved using present technology and particularly experience gained from
fuel reprocessing plants. However, ‘additional ‘technology development

would be required in other areas, such as remote cutting, alignment,

 
 

-45-
cleaning and welding of metal.members. Depending to some degree on the
‘particular plant arrangement, other special tools and ‘equipment would
also have to be ‘designed ‘and developed to accomplish inspection and

‘maintenance operations. Peet a

In the final analysis, the development of adequate inspection and -
‘maintenance techniques and procedures, and hardware for the MSBR-

hinges on the success of other facets of the program, such as materials
‘and component development, and on the requirement that adequate care be
taken during plant design to sisure that ‘all systems and’ components
which would require maintenance over the life of the plant are indeed
maintainable within the’ constraints of utility operation.’

G. Safety - Different Issues for the MSBR = :

| The MSBR concept has certain characteristics which might provide
advantages ‘relating to safety, perticularly vith respect to postulated
major types of accidents currently considered in licensing activities.
- Since the fuel would be in a molten form, consideration of the core
meltdown accident is not applicable to the MSBR. Also, in the event
of fuel spill, secondary criticality is not- a problem since’ this is
a ‘thermal reactor systen requiring moderator for nuclear critieality. B

Other safety features include the fact that the primary system would =
operate at low pressure with fuel salt that is more than: 1000°F below -

 
 

-46-

its boiling point, that fission product iodine and strontium form

stable compounds in the fluoride salts, and that the salts do not react
rapidly with air or water. Because of the continuous fuel processing,

the need for excess reactivity would be decreased and some of the fission
products would be continuously removed from the primary system. A prompt
negative temperature coefficient of reactivity is also a characteristic

of the fuel salt.

Safety disadvantages, on the other hand, include the very high radio-
active contamination which would be present throughout the primary .
system, fuel processing plant, and all auxiliary primary systems. such

as the fuel drain and off-gas systems. Thus, containment of these .
systems would have to be assured. Also, removal of decay heat from fuel
storage systems would have to be provided by always ready and relisble
cooling systems, particularly for the fuel drain tank and the Pa-233 decay
tank in the reprocessing plant where megawatt quantities of decay heat
must be removed. The tritium problem, already discussed, would have to

be controlled to assure safety.

Based on the present state of MSBR technology, it is not possible. to
provide a complete assessment of MSBR safety relative to other reactors.
It can be stated, however, that the safety issues for the MSBR are
generally different from those for solid fuel reactors, and that more
detailed design work must be done before the safety advantages and

disadvantages of the MSBR could be fully evaluated.

 

 
-47-

H. Codes, Standards, and High Temperature Design Methods

Codes and standards for HSBR equipment and systens | must be developed in
conjunction with other research and development before large MSBR' 8 can
be built, In particular, the materials of construction which are
currently being developed and tested would have to be certified for use

in nuclear power plant applications.

The need for high temperature design technology 1s a problem for the HSER
os well as for other high temperature systems. The AEC currently has
under way a program in support of the LMFER which is ‘providing materials
data and structural analysis methods for design of eystens employing
various steel alloys at temperatures up to 1200°F. This program would
need. to be broadened to include MSER structural materials such as

Has telloy-N and to include temperatures as. high as 1400°F to provide

the desten technology eppicable to high-temperature, long-tern
operating conditions which would be expected for MSBR vessels, components,

and core structures.

- VII. INDUSTRIAL PARTICIPATION IN THE MsER PROGRAM

Privately funded’ conceptual design studies and evaluations of MSER
technology were performed in 1970 by the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor
Associates (MSERA), a study group "headed by the engineering firm of
Black & Veatch and including five midvest utilities. The MSERA con-
cluded that the economic potential of the MSER is attractive relative
to light water reactors, but they recognized a number of problems which
mst be resolved in order to realize this potential. Since that time

the MSBRA has been relatively inactive.

A second privately funded organization, the Molten Salt Group, is headed
‘by Ebasco Services, Incorporated and includes five other industrial firms
and fifteen utilities. In 1971 the Group completed an evaluation of the
MSBR concept and technology and concluded that existing technology is
sufficient to justify construction of an MSER demonstration plant
although the performance characteristics could not be predicted with

: confidence. Additional support for further studies has recently been

committed by the members of this group.

In addition to these studies, manufacturers of graphite and Hastelloy-N

have been cooperating with ORNL to develop improved materials.

There has been little other industrial participation in the MSBER

Program aside from ORNL subcontractors. At the present time, there are

 
 

-49-

\ vo. ORNL subcontracts in effect. Ebasco ‘Services, Inc., utilizing the
 tndustrial firms who are participants in the Molten Salt Group is
performing a design and evaluation ‘study. Foster Wheeler Corporation is
currently performing design studies on steam generators for MSBR

‘application.

A number of factors can be identified which tend to limit further

industrial involvement at this time, namely:

1. The existing major industrial and utility commitments to the

IWR, HTGR, and LMFBR.

2. The lack of incentive for industrial investment in supplying
fuel cycle services, such as those required for solid fuel

reactors.

. 3. The overwhelming manufacturing and operating experience with

solid fuel reactors in contrast with the very limited involve-

 

ment with fluid fueled reactors.

- 4. The less advanced state of HSER technology and the lack of
demonstrated solutions to the major technical problems

~ associated with the MSBR concept.

 

 
 

-50- .

—
It should be noted that these factors are also relevant considerations \
in establishing the level of governmental support for the MSBR program

vhich in turn, to some extent, affects the interest of the manufacturing

and utility industries.

- vite. CONCLUSIONS _
‘The Molten Salt Breeder Reactor, if successfully developed and marketed,
could provide a useful supplement to the currently developing —
plutonium reactor economy. This concept offers the potential for:
. Breeding in a thermal spectrun reactor; : .

. Efficient use of thorium as a fertile material;

‘Elimination of fuel fabrication and spent fuel shipping;

- « High thermal efficiencies. )
Notwithstanding these attractive features, this assessment has
reconfirmed the extstence of major technological and engineering
problems affecting feasibility of the concept as a reliable and
economic breeder for the utility industry. The princival conoeras
include uncertainties with materials, with methods of controlling
erition, and with the deste of components. and systems along, with
their spectal handltn, inspection and maintenance equipment. any
of these problems are compounded by the use of a fluid fuel in which
fission products. and delayed neutrons. are distributed throughout the

prinary reactor and reprocessian. systems.

The resolution of the problens of the 'MSER will require the conduct

of an intensive research and developrent. program. Tacluded amon Co
“the major efforts that vould have to be accomplished are:

Proof testing of an integrated reprocessing ystems

. ‘Development of a 2 suitable containment material;

 

 

 
 

-52-
. Development of a satisfactory method for the control and
. retention of tritium;

. Attatment of a ‘thorough understanding, of the behavior of anton
products in a molten salt ‘system;

. Development of long life moderator graphite, suitsble for
breeder application;

. Conceptual definition o of the engineering features of the ‘many
components and systems;

. ‘Development of adequate methods and equipment for remote

inspection, handling, and maintenance of the plant. :

The major problems associated with the MSBR are rather difficult in nature
and many are unique to this concept. Cont4nutns support of the research
and development effort will be required to obtain satisfactory solutions
to the problems. When significant evidence is availble that demonstrates
realistic solutions are practical, a further assessment could then be made
as to the advisability of advancing into the detailed destgn and | |
engineering phase of the development process tnclugtnr that of tndustrial
involvement. Proceeding vith this next step would also be contingent

upon obtaining a firm demonstration of interest and commitment to the
concept by the power industry and the utilities and reasonable assurances
that large scale government and industrial resources can be made available :
on a continuing basis to this program tn ight of other commitments to
the commercial nuclear power progran and higher priority energy

development efforts.
