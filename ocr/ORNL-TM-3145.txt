THERMAL RADIATION TRANSFER OF AFTERHEAT
IN MSER HEAT EXCHANGERS

J. R. Tallackson

ABSTRACT

A fraction, estimated to be 40%, of the heat-producing noble-metal
fission products--niobium, molybdenum, technetium, ruthenium, rhenium,
and tellurium--is expected to deposit on the metal surfaces within the
primery fuel-salt loop in a molten-salt reactor. Virtually all of this
4o% will be in the heat exchangers. The normal means of afterheat re-
moval is to continue to circulate the primary and secondary salts. The
worst abnormal situation arises if the heat exchangers are quickly
drained of both primary and secondary salts in circumstances such that
all afterheat removal from the heat exchangers is, of necessity, by
radiative heat transfer. Whereas such an event will rarely, if ever,
take place, the primary system must accommodate the consequences, prin-
cipally high temperatures, without compromising containment.

Steady-state temperature calculations, based on radiative heat
transfer in MSER primary heat exchangers, are presented. Several sizes
with ratings from 9% Mw to 563 Mw and all with the same general configu-
ration were considered. Radial temperature profiles were computed for
afterheat rates corresponding to elapsed times from 100 sec to 11 days
after reactor shutdown. The effect of the emissivity of the internal
radiating surfaces in the heat exchangers was included. The calculations
show that the principal single barrier to heat removal is the inter-
mediate shell surrounding the tube bundle. This shell is located just
inside the outer shell and, unfortunately, becomes an effective thermal
radiation shield.

It is shown that heat exchangers with but one shell instead of two
ss in the MSER reference design will achieve significant reductions in

peak temperatures, particularly in the larger sizes and at low emissivi-

ties.

No transient case was computed but the upper limit of the initial
transient was estimated; the heat capacity of the exchangers affords a
cushion which, with the exception of the 563-Mw unit, limits maximum
temperatures to numbers that are high but not disastrous. Design
changes to increase radiating surface areas and to shorten the radial
transfer distance through the tube bundle should render the 563-Mw
exchanger acceptable. : }

I. INTRODUCTION

The afterheat problem in molten-salt reactors caused by the noble
metals which plate out on metal surfaces during reactor operation has not
gone away. Reliable, consistent data are scant, but, from MSRE data,
Briggs® has estimated that 40% of the noble-metal fission products might
plate out on the metal surfaces in the primary salt circuit. These pro-
duce substantial amounts of afterheat and virtually all of it will be
developed in the heat exchangers.

. Normally, afterheat in an MSER is easily removed by continuing the

circulation of the primary and secondary salts. The situation, albeit
unlikely, may arise in which both primary and secondary salts are rapidly
drained immediately after reactor shutdown. In these circumstances,
afterheat removal is, of necessity, solely by radiative transfer and the
maximum temperatures so developed are of considerable interest.

In September 1967 the author® presented calculated estimates of
temperatures produced by afterheat from noble metals plated on the sur-
faces in an empty primary heat exchanger of a two-region MSBR. It was
assumed that all afterheat rejection was by radiative transfer. These
temperatures were distressingly high, due, in large measure, to the
overly simplified computational model employed (see Appendix H). I am
pleased, without benefit of rack and thumbscrew, to recant. More real-
istic calculations based on the single-region "reference design"® MSER
heat exchangers indicate that peak afterheat temperatures, while still
uncomfortably high, will be much lower than originally anticipated.

II. CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

MSER "reference design" type heat exchangers can be designed to
withstand the after-shutdown temperature rise produced by noble-metal
afterheat. This worst-case study indicates that the two larger sizes
considered, 563 Mw and 281 Mw, may experience excessively high tempera-
tures, but the excess is small. If the overall diameters of these ex-
changers are increased, the peak temperatures can be limited to accept-
able values without undue penalties in cost. The improvement obtained
is twofold: (1) The reduction in annulus thickness decreases the radi-
ation path through the tube annulus, and (2) the radiating areas of the
outer and intermediate shells are increased.

The additional intermediate shell between the tubes and the outside
shell is an effective barrier to radiative transfer. This shell is
required if the tube bundle is to be replaced in situ. Significant
reductions in peak temperatures will be obtained if this shell is elimi-
nated. Alternatively, if the effective emissivity of the surfaces of
the intermediate shell and the outer shell can be made very high (5 0.8)
s0 as to be nearly black, the peak temperatures will be appreciably
lower.

Calculated estimates of radiant heat transmission and resulting
temperatures may be extremely sensitive to the assumptions, approximations,
and uncertainties on which the calculations are based. For example,
earlier calculations on a not too dissimilar heat exchanger, using an
oversimplified model, ¥ produced discouragingly high temperature forecasts;
the temperatures estimated by these earlier computations were as much as
2500°F higher than the temperatures reported herein. The present compu-
tational model is widely accepted and used. It contains no gross com-
promises with respect to heat exchanger geometry. It does require that
photons be emitted, reflected, and absorbed in a simple pattern, and
that their behavior be unaffected by temperature. A casual literature
search indicates that the errors produced by these simplifications may
be relatively small and probably on the high side, but confirmation would
be highly desirable. The variation of maximum temperature with emissivity
is substantial. Generally, I conclude that these calculated temperatures
may err on the high side but hesitate to enumerate the amount. It will
not be worthwhile to use or develop more accurate and elegant computational
approaches until reliable experimental evidence, applicable to this par-
ticular type of problem, has been produced. Without the support of the
experimental confirmation we can expect to produce a conservative and

perhaps expensive design. If radiant heat transmission remains a domi-

nant consideration, I recommend an experimental program to support and
confirm the analyses. Such experiments are not uncomplicated; they must
be carefully designed and well planned.

III. MSER HEAT EXCHANGER CONFIGURATION

Figure 1 is a vertical section through the "reference design"®
MSBER primary heat exchanger rated at 563 Mw. Four of these will be re-
quired for a 2250-Mw(th) MSBR. This exchanger type was scaled down by
rating factors of 1/2, 1/3, 1/k, and 1/6, thereby giving heat exchangers
rated at 281, 188, 141, and 94% Mw. The dimensions and details pertinent
to these heat transfer computations are on Fig. 2. It should be noted
that the scaled-down dimensions of the four smaller exchangers do not
follow any precise scaling law(s) based on stress or flow. For example,
it is more realistic to choose nominal pipe sizes and plate thicknesses
for the inner and intermediate shells instead of the non-standard diam-
eters and thicknesses that would result from any exact scaling down.
Also, it would be unwise to use thicknesses less than 1/2 in. for the
outer shells. Therefore, the outer shells are 1/2 in. in all the ex-
changers.

A second set of calculations was made for 563-Mw exchangers having

. larger outside diameters, thinner annuli, and therefore fewer tube circles

than the "reference design." These exchangers are scaled-up versions of
the 563-Mw unit which has 31 tube circles in the tube annulus. These
calculations are discussed in Section VI. )

 

¥Each tube circle was presumed to be a continuous impenetrable shell
(see ref. 2).

IV. AFTERHEAT GENERATION AND DISTRIBUTION

The amount of efterheat in the heat exchanger is based on Briggs'
estimate! that 40% of the noble-metal fission products plate out on the
metal surfaces exposed to the primary salt. The inside surfaces of the
heat exchanger tubes provide 39,000 ft® of surface in a 2250-Mw(th)
MSER system. This is a very large area compared with the shell and pipe
surface areas in the primary salt circuit. It can be assumed, with
negligible error, that the entire 40% is deposited on the inner surfaces
of the exchanger tubes.

The heat-producing noble metals are niobium, molybdenum, technetium,
ruthenium, rhodium, and tellurium. The heat produced by the iodine
daughters of tellurium is included. The heating by those noble metals
produced in the drain tanks by the decay of non-noble parent nuclides is
not included.

Figure 3 shows the afterheat rate in the 563-Mw unit per foot of
length of heat exchanger, .and Fig. 4 shows the rate per square foot of
outside tube surface¥* in any MSBR exchanger of this type. The accumu-
lated afterheat curve on Fig. 5 is the integral curve of Fig. 3. Table
1 gives numerical values of these data.

Heat exchanger temperatures were computed for two different distri-
butions of heat generation in the exchangers. The simplest case, Type 1,
is that in which all heat generation is assumed to be confined to the
tubes and uniformly distributed. This, in effect, says that gamma radi-
ation does not generate heat in adjacent shells nor is the total heat
generation in the exchanger(s) reduced by gammas escaping to the outside
world.

The second case, Type 2 distribution, considers the effect of gamma
radiation on the location of internal heat generation. Careful calcu-
lations#’® of gamma heat generation in heat exchangers of this general
design are available and from these the total heat generation rate was
subdivided into four parts: ¥*¥

1. the fraction in the inner shell,

2. the fraction in the tube annulus (includes all B heating).
3. the fraction in the intermediate and outer shells,

Lk. the fraction escaping the exchanger.

 

*Since the outside of the heat exchanger tubes provides 0.098 ft2
per foot of length, the heat rate per foot of tube length is obtained,
very closely, by dividing the data on Fig. 4 by 10.

*¥*These data were developed from ref. .l, Table 5.6, p. 63, and
ref. 5, Fig. 4, p. 10.

Figure 6 is a typical profile of the gamma heat deposition rate in
an empty 563-Mw heat exchanger. Figure 7 shows curves of the fractionms,
(1) to (4) above, for the exchangers in the size range considered.¥
These distribution fractions do not show any large variations with
elapsed time, particularly at the times of interest, from 10® to 10% sec
(0.3 to 30 hours) after shutdown. These curves are based on averages of
10%- and 10f-sec data.

Figure 6 shows that, of the two outermost shells, the thicker inter-
mediate shell is the much larger heat source; also, note that gamma heat
generation in these shells is attenuated very rapidly in the radial di-
rection. For these reasons, with Type 2 distribution, all the gamma heat
deposition in both outer shells was considered to be near thé inside sur-
face of the intermediate shell.

V. METALLURGICAL CONSIDERATIONS

The primary concern of this study is to determine whether or not
excessive heat exchanger temperatures will jeopardize the integrity of
the Hastelloy N primary containment envelope. Because the event postu-
lated seldom, if ever, would occur and because the resultant high tem-
peratures would be of short duration, we are not concerned with the
long-term creep-rupture behavior. We are concerned with the short-term
physical properties of Hastelloy N at temperatures around 2000°F (~1100°C)
and assuming that these temperatures are maintained for no more than
20 hours.

Hastelloy N pressure vessels, piping, etc., are not expected to
sustain serious damage if held at low stress for short times (< 20 hr)
at temperatures of 2150°F (1177°C).% A vessel subject to any substantial
fluence will lose ductility. Ultimate strength at this temperature will
be very low.” If a component is to survive at this temperature, we must
ensure that the high temperature regions be virtually free of stress-
producing imposed loads. It is appropriate to point out that it is rou-
tine fabrication practice to specify a stress-relieving anneal at 2150°F
for welded Hastelloy N pressure vessels. The foregoing suggests that
we evaluate preliminary designs using 2100°F as an upper temperature
limit for the unlikely events being considered here. This assumes that
the calculated or estimated temperatures tend to be on the high side
and leaves a small margin for thermal stresses and other uncertainties

which will be evaluated with some care during gestation of a final design.

files in four sizes, from 94 to 281 Mw, of MSBR-type heat exchangers
having the dimensions shown on Fig. 2. The heat generation rate is that
predicted at 10* sec (2.8 hr) after shutdown and drain. These curves
are based on the assumption of Type 1 distribution (see Section IV);
i.e., all afterheat generation is uniformly distributed in the heat ex-
changer tubes and no gamma energy escapes. It was also assumed that the
emissivity of the outside surface of the outer shell was 0.8 and that
this surface was radiating into infinite "black" surroundings whose tem-
perature is 1000°F. The emissivity¥of the internal radiating surfaces,
tubes and shells, is one of the larger uncertainties in a calculation of
this type. Both tubes and shells will meet stringent quality assurance
standards and we should expect them to have an excellent surface finish,
perhaps appearing almost polished. Furthermore, after exposure to molten
fluoride salts these internal radiating surfaces will be oxide free.

All the factors tending to promote bright, low emissivity surfaces in a
material tending toward low emissivity are present. For these reasons,
nearly all the calculations were made at internal surface emissivities
of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3. The general subject of emissivity* is discussed
in more detail in Appendix G. The data in Appendix G suggest that we
can expect the internal Hastelloy N surfaces to have an emissivity of
0.2 to 0.3 and that we select an emissivity of 0.2 in evaluating heat
exchanger performance in the situation considered herein. The high
emissivity (0.8) of the outer surface of the outer shell is justified
by assuming that it is coated with one of the titanates® or, alterna-
tively, deeply convoluted by fins or a gridwork. :

It is emphasized that these temperature curves are for steady- .
state conditions and do not take into account the rapid decrease with
time of the heat generation rate nor the temperature reducing effect
of heat capacity of the exchanger. These temperature profiles are,
perhaps, higher than would be obtained should the situation postulated
actually occur. The upper limits of the initial temperature transient
in the 563-Mw unit have been estimated and are discussed in subsequent
paragraph(s). The estimate indicates the temperature will reach its
maximum in about 10* sec after reactor shutdown and an immediate drain;
therefore, most of the data herein were calculated as if at steady
state with the afterheat rate expected at 10* sec after shutdown.

As the calculations proceeded, starting with the smallest, 94 Mw,
unit, some trends became evident; (1) the effect of heat capacity of
the exchanger cannot be ignored, (2) the variation of maximum internal
temperature with emissivity is less at higher emissivities, (3) gamma

 

*As this report was going to press, the writer's attention was
directed to ref. 27, in which emissivity measurements of INOR-8 (Hastel-
loy N) are reported. Bright and matte finished specimens showed an
emissivity of 0.20 at 1000°F to 0.25 at 1830°F. Oxidized specimens had
emissivities of approximately O.4 to 0.6. A value of 0.2 for the
emissivity of Hastelloy N is therefore appropriate. :

energy losses to the outside-are insufficient to contribute materially
toward reducing peak internal temperatures, and (4) the maximum tempera-
tures in the 563-Mw "reference design" exchanger may become unacceptably
high. Finally, it developed that the time-sharing computational program
used to obtain temperatures in the tube annulus (Appendix E) would not
run if the number of tube circles in an exchanger exceeded 22, whereas
the 563-Mw exchanger contains 31. There was not sufficient incentive to
spend time in rewriting the program for a larger machine. Instead, it
was decided to produce additional computations to indicate the changes
in the 563-Mw "reference design" which will reduce the maximum internal
temperature to acceptable values. Therefore, scaled-up versions of the
563-Mw "reference design" unit with larger outside diameters and a re-
duced number of tube circles were programmed and the peak temperatures
in the "reference design" were obtained by extrapolation.

The effect of emissivity, number of outer shells, heat capacity,
overall size and rating are considered in the paragraphs which follow.

Temperatures in 563-Mw heat exchangers having larger outside diam-
eters and thinner tube annuli than in the "reference design" (Fig. 1)
model were computed. These computations served two purposes: (1) They
indicated the minimum outside diameter of an exchanger which will limit
the maximum temperature to the 1900°F-2100°F region, and (2) they pro-
duced the basis for a good estimate, by extrapolation, of the peak tem-
peratures in the 563-Mw "reference design" shown on Fig. 1. The dimen-
sions of these exchangers and the computed temperatures therein are in
Table 2 and on Figs. 12 and 13.

The extrapolated temperature profiles, Fig. 1k, assigned to the
563-Mw "reference design" model which has 31 tube circles, are pre-
sented with considerable confidence because the extrapolations involved
only the temperature differentials in the tube annulus and this repre-
sents only about 25% of the total temperature above the 1000 °F ambient.
The remaining 75%, the temperatures of the outer and intermediate
shells, has been computed accurately.

It can be seen that if the outside diameter of the reference design
heat exchanger is increased from 36 in. to approximately 50 in. so that

‘the tubes are arrayed in 17 to 20 tube circles, the peak steady-state

internal temperatures will be in the acceptable 2000°F-2100°F region at
10* sec after shutdown when the internal surface emissivity is about 0.2.
A further increase in diameter may be necessary if: (1) the internal
surface emissivity turns out to be much less than 0.2; (2) the "reference
design" model, with two outer shells, continues to be the required de-
sign; and (3) if we use the steady-state temperature calculations at

"10* sec to guide the design. It will be shown that eliminating one of

the shells outside the tube annulus effects a very substantial reduction
in peak internal temperatures should the internal surface emissivity be
low (0.1).

The estimated temperature transient in the 563-Mw exchanger is shown
on Fig. 15. The estimate shows that the peak temperature, 2150°F, devel-
oped in this exchanger borders on acceptability if we can rely on an in-
ternal surface emissivity of 0.2 or better.* The simplifying assumptions
and approximations used in calculating this transient were made so that
the results would tend toward the high side. A brief description of the
method used to develop this transient is in Appendix H.

Figure 16 shows the author's version of a similar transient in the
141-Mw unit. This curve was estimated by inspection using Fig. 15 as a
guide. The transient peak, slightly above 1800°F, was located slightly
below the intersection of the adiabatic temperature growth curve of the
annulus and the steady-state peak temperature curve. This smaller unit
can be expected to perform well in the stated situation.

Figures 17 and 18 are temperature profiles in the 94- and 281-Mw
units at 10% sec after shutdown and for the nonuniform, Type 2, heat
distribution, Fig. 7. All other conditions are the same as for Figs. 8
and 11, with which they may be compared to note the effect of making cal-
culations using the simplifying Type 1 approximation. Table 3 provides
a comparison of peak temperatures if calculated for both types of heat
distribution at steady-state heat rates corresponding to those expected
at 10* sec (2.8 hr) after shutdown.

Noting that the more realistic assumption, Type 2, gives lower tem-
peratures, it is proper to query, "Why not use the nonuniform case
entirely?" The question is particularly appropriate because once the
equations are programmed, there is little difference in the ease of
obtaining numbers. The more exact nonuniform case, Type 2, requires a
prior and not uncomplicated nor inexpensive computation of gemma heating.®
During the early phase of a design study it will not be worthwhile to
spend much time in this effort until a detailed design has been confi-
dently established. The simple, uniform case, Type 1, requiring only a
knowledge of heat exchanger geometry and afterheat generation rate, is
relatively easy to calculate and, as it seems to provide temperatures
slightly on the high side, will tend to produce a conservative design.

Figures 8 to 11 and Fig. 14 show inner shell temperatures slightly
less than the temperature of the adjacent row of tubes. At first glance
this seems contrary to all accepted laws governing heat transfer. In
fact, and as will be seen, it is not true. However, if the assumption
of zero heat generation in the inner shell were actually true we should
expect this slight temperature depression at the inner shell. Because
the tube matrix is quite open, the inner shell is in thermal equilibrium
not only with the adjacent row of tubes but with the combination of
several sets of tube circles at lower temperatures farther out in the
tube annulus. On Figs. 17 and 18, in which the inner shells are generating
9% of the total afterheat, their temperature is the peak temperature as
expected.

A11 the preceding figures which show temperature profiles indicate
one thing in common; namely, as in calorimeters and similar devices, the
continuous intermediate shell, with low emissivity, is an efficient bar-
rier to radiative heat transfer and is a large factor in producing higher
internal temperatures. The reduction in peek temperatures effected by
eliminating one of these two shells was determined by calculations made
for the same group of exchangers with the outer, 1/2- in.-thick shell re-
moved. Table U4 provides a comparison of the peak steady-state tempera-
tures in exchangers of this type designed with one and two shells external
to the tube bundle and at the heat rate expected at 10* sec after shut-
down. Figure 19 shows curves of the data in Table 4 which have been
extrapolated to include estimated peak steady-state temperatures in the
563-Mw exchanger.

Interest was expressed in the reduction of temperature attained by
increasing the apparent emissivity of all surfaces of the outer and
intermediate shells. A possible method would be to add fins or a gridwork
so that these surfaces take the appearance of a continuous sheet of black
body cavities. No effort was spent investigating the feasibility of this
idea, but temperature profiles in a 281-Mw exchanger were calculated as
if all the surfaces of the intermediate and outer shells, internal and
external, had an emissivity of 0.8. A value of 0.2 for emissivity of the
inner shell and tube surfaces was selected. No allowance was. made for
the increases in shell diameters required. The results, calculated by
using Type 1 heat generation at the rate expected at 10* sec after
shutdown, are on Fig. 20. The temperature reductions so obtained are
appreciable.

Table 5 gives a comparison of maximum temperature in a 281-Mw
exchanger for four different cases described in the preceding paragraphs.

The effect of internal emissivity on peak temperature is implicit
in many of the preceding figures. Figure 21 shows, explicitly, the
influence of emissivity on peak temperatures in the 9U-Mw unit. It is
apparent that we will get a worthwhile improvement in afterheat rejection
by this heat exchanger if the emissivity of the Hastelloy N surfaces,
after exposure to molten salts, is 0.3 rather than 0.1. It is also
apparent that. increasing the emissivity above 0.3 produces little additional
benefit. :

The transfer of radiant energy from surfaces far inside the exchanger
will be strongly dependent on the combined effects, not separable, of
internal geometry and emissivity. At low values of emissivity (high re-
flectivity) a photon will have a higher probability of traveling farther
from its point of origin via multiple reflections through the tube bundle
before being absorbed. The surfaces will also be at a somewhat higher
temperature if they are radiating at a rate which maintains temperatures
constant at a constant afterheat generation rate. These are offsetting
trends, but the fourth power effect of temperature on heat transfer sug-
gests that higher emissivities may produce only fringe benefits in open
tube lattices. The quantitive extension of data from Fig. 21 to other
geometries is not recommended since this figure does not provide the
interrelation between geometry and emissivity.

The primary item of concern is peak temperature and its variation
with heat exchanger size and the heat generation rate. Figures 22 to
26, incl., show peak temperatures in the five sizes of exchangers listed
in Fig. 2 and how these temperatures vary with the heat generation rate.
The temperature profiles inside the exchangers will have the same general
pattern as those shown on Figs. 8 to 11, incl., but with different grad-
ients. As peak temperatures rise and/or as emissivity decreases, the
radial gradients through the tube annuli will tend to flatten out.

APPENDIX A
COMPUTATIONAL MODEL AND ASSUMPTIONS GOVERNING

THE COMPUTATIONS

Geometry (see Figs. 1 and 2)

All equations are written for infinite cylindrical geometry. Tube
layout is assumed to be an annular array consisting of an integral number
of concentric circles of tubes. Tube spacing (pitch) is: circumfer-
ential pitch -- 0.750 in.; radial pitch -- 0.717 in. In terms of space
or volume occupied by the tubing in the annulus, these tube spacings are
equivalent to triangularly pitched tubes having P/D = 2.1.

Physical Chargcteristics and Considerations

The computationel model is based on five assumptions or postulates®
involving the radiating surfaces and the energy radiated; these are:

(1) We are dealing with a multi-surfaced enclosure in which it is
possible to construct a heat balance for each surface in the enclosure.
Each surface in the enclosure is considered to be isothermal. Since
radial symmetry obtains, each circle of tubes was considered to be a
single surface.

(2) The surfaces of the enclosure are considered to be gray; i.e.,
absorptivity, o, is equal ‘to emissivity, €, for all wave lengths of
radiant energy and is uniform on any particular surface.

(3) The distribution of emitted radiation follows Lambert's cosine
law. Lambert's law is outlined in the next appendix.

(4) The distribution of reflected radiation also follows Lambert's
cosine law, (3) above; i.e., when a collimated beam or pencil of rays
strikes the surface it is reflected diffusely.

A consequence of (3) and (4) above is that, in considering the energy
leaving an element of surface, no distinction is made between emitted and
reflected radiation. The resulting heat transfer — temperature equations
“are linear and tractable.

(5) The radiation incident on any particular surface in the enclosure
is uniformly distributed on that surface. This assumption is required if
the isothermal and gray conditions per (1) and (2) above are met.

It is generally recognized that these postulates are simplifying
assumptions which may deviate, sometimes quite substantially, from the
actual physical situation. They receive wide use because of the tractable
mathematical expressions resulting from their use. In most cases and in
spite of their deficiencies, equations derived from these general
 

 

hy

assumptions usually produce satisfactory engineering answers. Insofar
as these heat exchanger calculations are concerned, we cannot justify or
favor any other set of assumptions unless we have reliable experimental
date which enable us to evaluate:

(1) emissivity, its temperature dependence and the angular
distribution of emitted radiation,

(2) the degree to which reflected radiation is specular instead
of diffuse and how specularity is affected by surface finish,
surface composition, and immediately adjacent sub-surface
structure, temperature, and exposure to molten salt.

Even if we had these data the development of solvable equations would be
a formidable problem and certainly, during the development of a design,
not worthwhile from the standpoint of cost and time.

We would, perhaps, consider a calculation in which tube surfaces
are divided in two parts [see (5) above], the inner and outer half
circles. This would have, as its only effect, increasing the number
of equations by a factor of almost 2 but would not increase the complex-
ity of the equations. Such a step would, as of now, require programming
for one of our local computers; our remote time sharing facility would
not have the necessary capacity.

APPENDIX B
DIRECTIONAL DISTRIBUTION OF RADIATION
(Lambert's Law)
Consider an elemental black surface, d s» radiating in accordance with

Lembert's cosine law. The energy, dQ, emitted from dA, into the elemental
solid angle dQ centered about the direction (8,6), Fig. Bl, may be expressed,

dQ(g,8) = aQ(p) = I; dA ces B dQ . (B-1)

I, is the rate of emission per unit elemental area, , of emitting sur-
face, into a unit elemental solid angle around the normal, (g = 0), to da, .

APPENDIX C
VIEW FACTORS*

General Considerations

 

1

In an enclosure made up of two or more surfaces the view factor¥* for
any particular surface, the reference surface, to any surface in the en-
closure is defined as the fraction of the total radiant energy leaving
the reference surface which is transmitted directly (no reflections) to
the viewed surface; obviously then, this fraction is dependent on the
geometrical configuration of the surfaces in the enclosure and on the
directional distribution of the radiant energy leaving the reference
surface. "View fraction" would, perhaps, be more accurate terminology.
References 11 and 12 provide excellent material on this subject. In this
report view factors are represented thus: F is the view factor of

m-n
surface m looking at surface n.

It is not difficult to show'! that for surfaces, all composed of
infinitely long parallel elements, the view factor, assuming diffuse
radiation, from a strip of differential width to a neighboring surface
is given by Fig. Cl.

This is the situation which obtains in MSER heat exchangers. Tubes
and surfaces which see each other are separated at most by about 6 in.,
and since they are about 250 in. long, the infinite length model is appro-
priate. Note that concave surfaces see themselves and that view factors
of surfaces to themselves must be included. The relation in Fig. Cl,
evaluated graphically and integrated, was used to determine a majority of
the view factors required by this analysis. The reciprocity relation

Fon® "font (c-2)
A = area of mth surface

was also used.

View Factors, Tube to Adjacent Tube and Adjacent Plane

 

The view factors for simple regular geometries can often be obtained
analytically and several references (13 to 20 incl.) are good sources of
view factor formulas for a variety of geometrical shapes and arrangements.
In these MSBR exchangers the unobstructed view factors for a tube to an
adjacent tube, Fig. C2, were determined from

Each tube sees adjacent tubes on either side in the same row; there-

sidered to be ‘a single surface, n, in an infinite planar array is

0.154 for P/D = 2.1.

At the boundaries where the tubes see a continuous plane surface,
the view factor of an infinite row of tubes to an infinite plane is
determined thus:

parallel, infinite planes, Fig. C3.

determined graphically as illustrated by the next diagram, Fig. Chk, and
the procedure which follows.

Procedure for Calculating View Factors

1.

On a large-scale layout, determine graphically the arc, MN, the part
of the periphery of the reference tube (1C) which sees the viewed
tube, 3R2. MN is defined by MP tangent to 2R2 and NQ tangent to
3R2. :

Subdivide MF into incremental arcs, My, Mg, - -. - 2h.. The
number of subdivisions is a matter of judgment. Increasing the
number of subdivisions. increases both accuracy and labor. For these

computations the a8, were typically 10° arcs.

Determine the limits of view of each incremental arc on 1C to viewed
tube 3R2. On the diagram these view limits of AA; are denoted by

“lines OX and OY, making angles oq and oz with the normal to BA, .
The average view factor of the element of surface represented “by

arc BA) seeing 3R2 is given by

Tm, - 3R2 = 1/2 (sin a = =p os); .

The view factor of the surface. represented by arc Mis the simple
integrated average of the view factors of the incremental arcs:

at tube surface 3R2 (or 4Ll, 4Rl, or 2R3, etc.) is

Co
i =
Fica3m~"3%0 *F Mm -3me (C-Te)

 

 
 

 

 

5h

This procedure is repeated to get the view factors from tube 1C to
the other tubes seen differently by 1C until a catalog of view factors
to all tubes seen by tube: -1C is complete. Because infinite geometry
in all directions has been assumed, the sum of the view factors of
tube 1C to all the tubes it sees in Row 2 is also the view factor of
the surface represented by all tubes in Row 1 to all tubes in Row 2.

As noted in Section III and Fig. 2, the assumed tube spacing with
0.750 in. and 0.717 in. circular and radial pitch, respectively, is equiv-
alent, in terms of space occupied by the tubes, to triangularly pitched
tubes having a pitch/diameter ratio of 2.1. Specifying an actual detailed
tube sheet layout is beyond the proper scope of this investigation as it
will depend on accepted fabrication practices, designers' preferences, the
vendor's machine tools, etc. Also, it would be folly to believe that,
regardless of tube sheet layout, 3/8-in.-diam tubes over 20 ft long will
exactly reproduce the tube sheet layout at the midplane. We can only
depend on the average tube density in the tube annulus. Since, from
symmetry, each tube in any particular circle was assumed to be at the
same temperature, each circle of tubes was considered to be a single
surface (see Appendix A).

Ideally, view factors for each tube circle would be determined by
a careful computation, and tube circle curvature would be taken into
account. Nearly as good results would be obtained by getting view factors
at several radii and interpolating. Either of these methods requires a
tremendous expenditure of routine labor in graphic computations and piece-
meal integrations -- awesome to contemplate and wholly impracticable.
Therefore, view factors were determined as if the tubes were in infinitely
wide and deep slab geometry, triangularly pitched (/D = 2.1) and bounded
on two faces by infinite planes. This reduced the labor involved to an
acceptable minimum. The view factors so determined were then modified
by considering the view factor akin to conductivity and using conduction
equations as a basis for computing a correction coefficient which will
make the slab array view factors apply to cylindrical geometry. -

Consider, for example, the effect of tube circle curvature. In a
simple enclosure consisting of two infinitely long concentric cylinders,
it is immediately apparent that the view factor from the inner cylinder
to the outer cylinder is 1. However, the concave inner surface of the
outer cylinder sees itself across the annulus, and the view factor from
the outer to inner annulus will be less than 1. This, of course, is

also evident from the reciprocity relation, Fn -m A, =F on A.

In these heat exchangers the ratios of the radii of tube circles which
view one another are not sufficiently close to one to justify neglecting
curvature by using a slab approximation.

An infinite, triangularly pitched array is completely regular, and
view factors for a tube or row of tubes to other tubes or rows may be
used repetitively throughout the array. An infinite array of uniformly
spaced concentric circles of tubes will not be completely regular. The
small local deviations from uniform geometry are expected to average out
and hence were not considered in the determination of the view factors.
 

55

It will become apparent, by considering the equations in subsequent
Appendix E, that system geometry enters the temperature — heat transfer
equations only via the view factors; i.e., the use of slab array view.
factors would be equivalent to solving this heat exchanger transmission
problem in infinite slab geometry. For thin annuli having ID/0D ratios
close to 1, the substitution of slab for cylindrical geometry is probably
of little consequence. The MSBR heat exchangers do not meet this con-
dition. It is easily shown that, for conductive transfer with internal
heat generation, the substitution of an infinite slab having the same
thickness as the tube annulus may produce a large error. For example,
the temperature-drop equations for the two cases are:2©

If we use the tube annulus dimensions, Fig. 2, of the MSBR 563-Mvw ex-
changer in these equations, we get, for equal values of H and k:
= 1.80 Ek .

AT = 1.28 H/k; AT

cyl slab

The infinite slab equation, in this case, produces answers 40% higher
(referred to the cylinder). Alternatively, if the conductivity of the
slab material is increased by 40%, the temperature drops will be the
same.

It was decided--for two reasons: (1) intuition, and (2) the immedi-
ate lack of a better proven approach--to use these conduction transfer
equations to compute the correction coefficient spplied to the slab array
view factors. If the conduction transfer Equations (C-8) and (C-9) are
rearranged to give the relative values of conductivity in a slab and a
hollow cylinder which, all else equal, provide equal temperature differ-
entials, we can write

2(ar)?

. (c-10)
ar, (ar) + (ar)° = 2r° log, (1+ =)

ks1ab = Keyl

The bracketed expression is the ratio of conductivities that must exist

if an infinite slab of thickness Ar is to transfer its internally generated
heat across the same temperature differential as in an infinite hollow
cylinder of inner radius r and annular thickness Ar. Equal values of heat
generation per unit volume are assumed.

This expression in brackets is always positive and greater than 1
(> 1) if Ar is taken as positive in the radially outward direction. It
can be regarded as the correction factor, applied to conductivity, re-
quired to make a slab geometry computation produce results applicable to
a hollow cylinder.

It is again emphasized that the temperature — radiant heat transfer
equations do not contain explicit terms based on system geometry; i.e.,
if the view factors in these equations are those of slab geometry, the
results are correct for slab geometry. The view factors, for reasons
noted in the preceding paragraphs, were obtained from a slab model and
subsequent computations based on these view factors must be corrected so
the results are applicable to hollow cylindrical geometry.

View factors were regarded as analogous to conductivity and values
obtained from the slab array calculations and graphics were corrected
using a factor based on the bracketed term in Eq. (C-10). In detail,
the corrections were made as follows:

Sle (ne) = view factor from any row of tubes, surface n, to
another parallel row, the (n+k)th, where k = 1, 2,
3, --- etc; or, from a bounding plane, n = 1, to a
row of tubes.
Fo (n+k) = view factor from the nth cylindrical surface (circle
of tubes or a shell) to the (n+k)th surface; n = 1
is assigned to the outer surface of the inner shell
of the heat exchangers.
r, = radius of nth surface.
Or = difference in the radii of nth and (n+k)th surface.
Ar is always positive since these corrections were
applied by starting at the innermost radius where
n= 1.

A = grea of nth surface.
Aj = area of (n+k)th surface.

The view factors in the cylinder are:

With this expression (C-11 , the corrected view factors were established
starting with the innermost surface at the inner shell n=l), for all

surfaces to other view surfaces located radially outward. Having
established the radially outward view factors, the view factors from all
surfaces to other surfaces located radially inward were then determined
from the reciprocity relation, viz.:

The view factor for a surface to itself was now determined from
the requirement that the sum of all view factors from any surface be
1 (1.00).

From the large-scale graphic layout of a planar or slab array of
tubes, it was seen that, for this tube spacing (pitch/diam = 2.1), any
tube in the array could barely see tubes beyond the 6th row distant;
i.e., the view factor from a tube row to a row beyond the 6th row away
was less than 0.01. This is of the same order as the accuracy of the
graphics. Therefore, all radiation passing unobstructed beyond the 5th
row was arbitrarily assumed to fall on the 6th row.

An interesting sidelight developed out of the view factor determi-
nations. Figure C5 is a semi-log plot of the view factor of a continuous
boundary plane versus distance, in tube row spacings, into the triangu-
larly pitched (p/D = 2.1) tube matrix. It seems that photon attenuation
at least in this array, is exponential with distance. If, more generally,
it turns out that photon attenuation in tube bundles is exponential, the
use or development of analytical methods for transfer through continuous
media might be worthwhile. There is a substantial body of analytical
and experimental work on radiant transfer in absorbing and emitting gases.
The relevant mathematics should apply if the descriptions of photon
absorption or attenuation and emission in tube bundles and in gaseous
media are similar. Neutron transport analyses may also be applicable
since the photons undergo production (emission), absorption, and scatter-
ing (reflection). Monte Carlo techniques have also been used successfully.

SHELL TEMPERATURES

~

Calculation of the steady-state temperature profiles through the
outer and intermediate shells is a simple, straightforward procedure.
It involves conduction transfer through the shells and radiative trans-
fer in the simplest of geometries; between concentric, infinitely long
concentric shells and from the outer shell to an infinite, "black" sink.
This computation precedes the calculation of tube enclosure temperatures
since it establishes the temperatures of the inner surface of the inter-
mediate shell, the boundary value required to compute the tube enclosure
temperatures. A detailed outline follows.

APPENDIX E

THE HEAT TRANSFER — TEMPERATURE EQUATIONS

Several approaches®? to ‘calculating temperatures and radiated heat
rates have been developed for systems in which it is assumed that the
five postulates listed in Appendix A are valid. Regardless of how the
problem is attacked, these various methods produce, in essence, the same
final set of equations. The data reported herein were calculated using
the "Radiosity Method"'® which, apparently, was introduced by Eckert and
Drake. The development of the equations describing radiant interchange

At the risk of stating the obvious we must be able to prescribe at least one surface
temperature. When applied to MSBR heat exchangers we use these radiosity equations
as follows:

(a) The innermost surface, (k = 1), q, = O in Equation (10b) if it is assumed that there is
no heat generation in the inner shell (Type 1).

(b) Tube circles, k = 2 to M — 1, incl,, q, in Equation (10b), is specified from noble metal afterheat data.
(c) Intermediate shell, k = M; T, in Equation (6) 1s established from previous computations of the
temperature gradients required to transfer the total afterheat generated within the heat
exchanger from the inner surface of the intermediate shell to the outside world.

These equations in which radiosity, By, is the varieble are written thus

APPENDIX F

COMPUTATIONAL PROCEDURE

Calculations were made in sequence as follows:
1. View factors were determined as outlined in Appendix C.

2. Temperature profiles in the outer and intermediate
shells were calculated as outlined in Appendix D.
The temperatures at the inner surface of the inter-
mediate shell are the boundary values, Typ used in
Eqs. (1lc) in Appendix E.

3. Having established the view factors, boundary values
for temperstures, and heat rates, Eqs. (llc) in
Appendix E were solved for tube circle and inner
shell temperatures.

The computations were made using Extended Basic (BII) programs with
the Reactor Division's time-sharing computer facility. Several programs
were written for the various aspects of the problem. It has been this
author's experience that the inclusion of computer program lists without
copious explanatory notes and instructions is wasted effort. Should a
need develop, the programs will be reported separately.

APPENDIX G

THERMAL RADIATION CHARACTERISTICS OF HASTELIOY N

 

The emissivity of Hastelloy N (INOR 8) is reported in reference 27.
These data suggest that, for clean, unoxidized surfaces, we use an emis-
sivity of 0.2 and, for oxidized surfaces, an emissivity of 0.5 or 0.6.

The author did not become aware of reference 27 until this report
was virtually completed. The remainder of this appendix is the result
of my attempts to infer a value of emissivity from measurements on alloys
composed of similar elements. Although the data and references which
follow are not directly applicable, they are included since they may be
relevant and useful to persons dealing with similar problems.

There is considerable data on alloys containing nickel, iron, molyb-
denum, and chromium. Table Gl lists values of emissivity for metals of
this general composition. In general, the numerical values of emissivity
for smooth, clean, unoxidized surfaces at temperatures in the region
1200°F-2000°F are from 0.1 to 0.3. In the absence of better information,
similar values were assumed for Hastelloy N. Therefore, the temperature
calculations were made for internal emissivities of 0.1, 0.2, and 0.3.

In general, the data indicate, and theory substantiates, that emissivity
increased with increasing temperature. This change is not large; within
the temperature differences calculated in the tube annuli, it will be of
the same order as the uncertainty in the value of the emissivity. No
attempt was made to include a mild temperature dependence of emissivity
in the temperature — heat transfer equations. These equations, linear
with T™ as the unknown, are easily solved by standard routine programs.
We are dealing with conceptual designs, subject to change, and a physical
system containing uncertainties other than emissivity. The incremental
elegance of solution and the resulting improvement in accuracy are insuf-
ficient to justify the very appreciable increase in cost and time re-
quired to develop or adapt a program which allows the use of temperature-
dependent emissivity in the system of equations.

In connection with the data from reference 22 in Table Gl, it is
appropriate to point out that this report, NASA CR 1431, outlines a program
now apparently under way at Purdue University to collect, evaluate, and
present radiative properties data from all available sources. When suf-
ficient evidence exists concerning a particular property of a particular
material, such as the emissivity of stainless steel, broad band curves of
"recommended" values are presented which enable the reader to get a
general feeling for the tolerances or variations to be expected and the
circumstances in which the "recommended" values are applicable. These data
tend to develop more confidence in the user than anything this writer has
seen heretofore in the readily available texts and references.

It has been pointed out that by assuming gray, diffuse conditions,
no distinction is made between emitted and reflected radiation; both are
assumed to have directional properties in accordance with Lambert's cosine
law. There is evidence that, whereas the pattern of emitted radiation may

be well approximated by the cosine law, reflected radiation from the

same surface can be highly specular, particularly when very smooth or
polished surfaces predominate. Intuitively, this is reasonable. No
attempt was made to estimate or evaluate the effect of a strong specular
component on temperatures developed in these heat exchangers. Any effect
of specularity would be more apparent at low emissivities when the energy
content of the total radiation leaving a surface contains the largest
fraction of reflected radiation. The literature contains comparisons of
computations based on diffuse vs specular radiation emanated by relatively
simple, regular cavity configurations such as continuous rectangular and
V-shaped grooves, cylindrical and conical cavities, and spherical cavi-
ties. The data are presented by plotting curves of apparent emissivity,

“which is a measure of overall heat transfer capability of the cavity, as

a function of cavity depth-to-opening ratio (1/R for a cylindrical
cavity). Actual emissivity is a parameter. The effect of specularity

is to increase the gpparent emissivity and the effect is most pronounced

in deep cavities of low emissivity. For example, reference 12, Fig. 6.2,
p. 165, shows calculated curves of apparent emissivity of cylindrical
cavities having depth to radius ratios, I/R, from zero to 10. The data
in Table G2 have been taken from this figure.

The degree to which the internal surfaces, tubes mainly, reflect
specularly deserves consideration. Certainly the spaces between the
tubes are not unlike deep cavities. If specular reflections will take
place in the heat exchangers, it is reasonable to conclude that the
diffuse calculations reported here give higher temperatures and may be
regarded as conservative.

The calculated temperatures reported herein are not presented en-

temperatures in a 9l-rod bundle of 0.5-in.-diameter straight stainless
steel tubular electrical heaters were reported.®® Figure Hl is a photo-
graph of a somewhat similar heater assembly. Figure H2 shows the
essentials of the test setup. The information required to do tempera-

Emissivities

No measurements were made of emissivity of the tube sur-
faces or the internal surface of the housing. Based on the
several-year-old recollection of a person somewhat familiar
with the- experiment, it can only be concluded that the stain-
less steel surfaces were neither new, bright and polished, nor
were they heavily and deeply oxidized. Between these extremes,
emissivities from 0.2 to 0.7 are possible and values from 0.3
to 0.5 are likely. Tube surfaces displayed a dull, satiny
gloss typical of stainless steel after long immersion in a
high-temperature liquid metal (NaK, K, Na, etc.).

k. Temperature measurements

Temperatures were measured by chromel-alumel thermo-
couples embedded in the heater rods and placed on or in the
housing.

Temperature calculations were made using the same general method as
that used to calculate heat exchanger temperatures. Because of the close
spacing of the heaters (p/D = 1.25) the view of any rod is limited to ad-
Jjacent rods and to rods in any second row distant. The central rod and
each of the five hexagonal rings were considered to be an isothermal sur-
face so that the "enclosure" consisted of a total of seven surfaces. This
assumption is capable of producing some error since the corners of the
hexagons are closer to the outer shell. This is particularly apparent on
examining the corner rods in the outermost hexagonal ring. Each of these
six rods sees only three adjacent rods instead of the four seen by the
other rods in this ring. Everything else being equal, we should expect
its temperature to be lower than the other rods in that ring since it has
more surface directly viewing the heat sink (the outer shell). This has
been borne out in the second experiment discussed subsequently, but it was
not taken into account in the temperature computations for this test setup.

The length of heated section in the rods was 10 in., giving the
assembly an approximate L/D of 1.7. The one-dimensional infinite length
computational model was used; it was recognized that, applied to this
short assembly, accuracy would suffer. In an effort to compensate parti-
ally for axial heat losses by conduction in the rods and by radiation,
particularly from the outer ring to the shell, the radially radiated heat
was assumed to be 90% of the total input.

Since the actual emissivities of the surfaces were not known, it was
decided to assume values for emissivity and attempt to match the experi-
mental temperature data. The results of these calculations are on Figs.
H2 to H5, inclusive. These figures are, for the most part, self-explana-
tory, but in all cases note that the observed radial temperature gradient
is steeper than the calculated values. The temperatures developed and
measured in the rod array will be affected by axial conduction in the
heater elements and thermocouples and by specular or other non-diffuse
components in the emitted and reflected radiation. Any computation de-
signed to obtain precise agreement with experiment must include these
factors. They were not considered in the calculations reported herein.
The calculations using emissivities in the neighborhood of 0.5 are in
the best agreement with the experiment. This may be reasonable since the
heaters had seen considerable use.

Figures H6 and HT are included to emphasize that radiative transfer
in a bundle of rods should not be approximated by assuming that each
ring of rods behaves as if a continuous, impenetrable shell.

Environment

The hexagonal, stainless sheet steel tube enclosure
is protected from air currents and sudden transients
by the outer housing, a 10-in. sched-U40 pipe. The
system was evacuated to 100 microns of mercury or less
for the tests discussed herein.

A somewhat similar situation as with the first

Temperature measurements

Temperatures in the bundle are measured by thermo-
couples inserted inside selected tubes. These tubes do
not contain heaters and are located (see Fig. H8) at the
corners and in the centers of the flats of the hexagonal

Results

The comparison of experimental? and computed temperatures, Figs.
H9 and H10 showed the same general trend as in the previous experiment,
namely, the observed temperature gradient was steeper. The use of un-
heated tubes for the temperature measurements gives temperature readings
below the average temperatures of similarly located heated tubes. This
is borne out by the calculations, curves D1 and D2 on Fig. H1O. Curve
D2 calculated with zero heat input to the central tube is depressed 23°F
below the temperature computed as if the tube were heated. Note also
that curves Dl and D2 show a temperature difference of 34°F at the outer
ring. This is the computed difference in temperature between a heated
tube centrally located on a face of the outermost hexagonal ring and
the unheated corner tube. This difference has two causes; (1) the
corner tube is not heated and (2) by virtue of its location more of its
surface views the adjacent hexagonal shield, a heat sink. It will be
shown that the local temperature depression of an unheated tube tends
to go inversely with the third power of the local prevailing temperature
surrounding the unheated tube and, at lower emissivities (< 0.3), nearly
inversely with emissivity. From this we should expect that the actual
radial gradient across the bank of heated tubes will be less steep than
indicated by thermocouples in unheated tubes.

During these preliminary runs the temperature of the intermediate,
hexagonal shield was not measured. This is the heat sink temperature
and its value is required in the calculations (see Appendix E). The
calculated temperature curves in Figs. H9 and H1O are based on hexagonal
shield temperatures of TOO°F and 600°F. These temperatures were calcu-
lated by assuming an outer shell temperature of 200°F and emissivities
of shell and shield surfaces of 0.30 and 0.k42.

The experiment was in its initial startup phase when the data were
taken, and plans were under way to obtain these temperatures in future
tests. The degree to which hexagonal shell temperature affects internal
temperatures has not yet been determined experimentally. Two calculations,
virtually identical but for hexagonal shield temperatures, may be com-
pared with the following table, Hl. Reducing the sink temperature from

600°F to LOO°F effected an appreciable reduction in the peak temperature
and a slight increase in the radial gradient. At higher heat inputs or
in larger assemblies with more tube rings, the fourth power effect of
temperature will dominate the fractional improvement obtained by lowering
the sink temperature. It will be shown, subsequently, that there were
axial heat losses in this experiment. The differences between observed
and calculated temperatures are subject to the same general considera-
tions mentioned in the previous discussion of the 9l-rod array.

Conductive transfer effected by the spiral wire wrap around the
tubes (see Fig. HB) was not considered. If any appreciable heat is trans-
ferred by conduction, it will affect the radial temperature gradient.

Figure Hll shows that there were axial heat losses, amount unknown.
No really serious attempt was made to consider these in the computations.
A few calculations for which the radiated heat was reduced by ~5% (from
5.0 to 4.73 Btu/hr-ft tube) were made using the same infinite cylinder
model. The effect of this small heat reduction, credited to axial heat
- flow, was negligible.

It has been noted that we should expect the corner tubes to have a
lower temperature. If unheated, as these are, the effect will be more
pronounced. The unheated tubes in the inner rings will also be at lower
temperatures than their neighbors at or near the same radius. - The amount
by which they will be lower will certainly be dependent on emissivity.
For example, the temperature depression can be approximated by using the
differential of the heat transfer expression,

that T; = Tp; also, assume that Tp doesn't change. By differentiating,

Table H2 gives values of AT for the temperatures in the range of
the experiment and for emissivities considered reasonable.

It would not and will not be correct to apply these approximate
tabulated values to the experiment. They are listed to indicate that
the temperatures measured in an unheated tube will be below that of the
surrounding heated tubes in the bundle. Since this deficit is greater
at lower temperatures, measurements so taken will indicate a gradient
steeper than actually exists.

The infinite cylinder model was used and, taking the length equal
to the length of the heated section of the tubes, 4 ft, we have an
LD == 8--a better approximation than with the first experiment.

After assessing the calculated and observed temperatures in these
tube bundles, it was concluded that the agreement was satisfactory.
Since the computed values tended to be higher, it was decided that this
calculational approach is a suitable method which gives safe answers

The interchange factor, Fy_, gz, for this model was estimated with \ )

rates at 10* sec after shutdown and for the case when the emissivity +

of all internal surfaces is 0.2. The shell temperatures, 6, and 6,

In the above, t, and tz; denote any arbitrary time interval.
These equations, involving both temperatures and heat transfers, were
satisfied by cut-and-try iteration.

On Fig. 15 it cen be seen that the transient peak occurs at slightly
more than 10* sec (~ 3 hr) after shutdown and drain. This time period
was subdivided into several increments and the manner in which the above
equations were applied is described below.

During the first 1000 sec (17 min) after shutdown and drain, the tempera-
ture differences between the annulus and the intermediate shell and the
outer shell are small. In these circumstances, little heat will be trans-
ferred and the pesk temperature in the annulus will tend to follow curve
B in Fig. 15. At 1000 sec after shutdown the annulus is transferring to
the intermediate shell about 20% of the heat being generated within the
annulus. This approximate rate was computed with Eq. (I-la) with temper-
atures taken from curves B and C on Fig. 15.

During this LOOO-sec interval, subdivided into two equal intervals
for the computations, the heat transfer from the annulus to the intermediate
shell was taken into account. :

It was assumed that the heat lost by the annulus is transferred to the
intermediate shell. The peak temperature in the annulus will, therefore,
become less than curve B, Fig. 15, by an amount proportional to the heat
transferred from the annulus and the average temperature of the intermedi-
ate shell will rise above curve C. Note that, because of its large heat
capacity and lower internal generation rate, the average temperature of
the intermediate shell rises quite slowly and it is incapable of trans-
ferring appreciable heat to the outer shell. Therefore, during this
period, it was assumed that all the heat transferred from the annulus to
the shell is retained by the shell.

C. After 5 x 10%Sec

All the components of Eq. (I-2) and I-3) were considered. The compu-
tations of heat transferred from the intermediate shell to the outer shell .
included the simplifying assumption that the outer shell temperature re-
mained constant at 1200°F, the initial temperature of the system. The
thick intermediate shell is a good heat sink and intercepts all the heat
from the annulus. Moreover, it is a poor radistor and must develop an
appreciable temperature increase over the outer shell temperature before
it can transfer an accountable amount of heat. The outer shell, on the
other hand, is thin (0.5 in.) and, with an outer surface emissivity of
0.8 it is a good transmitter and radiator of such heat that it receives
on its inner surface. In an actual situation we would expect the outer
shell temperature to decrease, beginning immediately at shutdown. It
would not begin to rise until the intermediate shell outer surface
temperature had increased to a level that transfers substantial heat
outward. Note, on Fig. 14, that the steady-state temperature computation
at 10% sec after shutdown shows adjacent surface temperatures of 1940°F
and 1200°F for the intermediate and outer shells, respectively. From the
transient calculation, the intermediate shell temperature is estimated
to be from 1750°F to 1800°F at this time. This lower temperature will
reduce the heat radiated to the outer shell and, therfore, the outer
shell temperature will be less than the assumed value of 1200°F.

From 5 x 10% to 1.1 x 10* sec the computations were based on time
increments of 2 x 10® sec. At 1.1 x 10* sec the rate of change of heat
generation had been reduced to a value for which a final time increment
of one hour was reasonable. The computations were terminated at 1.46 x 10*
sec (4 br) at which time it was evident that the transient had turned
over and system temperatures were beginning to decrease and approach
the steady-state values. :

The generalized heat balance terms, Uy to Us, incl., in Egs. (I-2)
and (I-3), will now be specified in detail.

U, and Uz are obtained from Table 1 and/or Fig. 5 with the fractional
amounts, 77% and 23%, respectively, from Fig. 7. The remaining terms are
established by iteration.

The equations for Us; and Ug are simple and straightforward:

_ ta C, = heat capacity of the annulus,
()] Fig. I2..
AG, , see Fig. Il, is the change in
the average annulus temperature
during time interval, tz — ti.

Note that the peak temperature in the heat exchanger will be slightly
above © because of the gradient in the annulus. With the annulus trans-
ferring heat at the generation rate existing 10* sec after shutdown the
increase is approximately 75°F.

to _ ts Cis = heat capacity of the intermedi-
Us | = C (s)] ate shell.
ta tu AB; = change in the average tempera-

ture of the intermediate shell.

The average temperature of the thick (2.5 in.) intermediate shell is,
during the transient, appreciably dependent on both space and time.
From Fig. 6 it is apparent that most of the gamma heat deposition takes

‘place near the inside surface. The radiant heat received from the

annulus will be deposited directly on the inner surface. The net effect,
of course, is to raise the temperature of the inner surface a substantial
amount above the average value, 6s, that must be used to evaluate Ug.
However, the inner surface temperature, 83, is the effective heat sink
temperature used in Eq. (I-1) when radiant transfer from the annulus is
being calculated. This difference between the average and inner surface
temperatures was not calculated directly as a function of elapsed time;

- instead, the approximate transit time for heat flow through the slab was

estimated. Specifically, the case considered was an infinite slab, 2.5
in. thick, of Hastelloy N, with one face insulated. The uninsulated
surface sees a step increase in tempereture. From Fig. 10-2, p. 235,
and related text material in reference 28, it was estimated that the

‘average temperature will lag the inner surface temperature by approxi-

mately 1000 sec. This local transient effect in the intermediate shell
was considered during the computations.

The total heat transferred from the annulus during any interval,
tz — t3, is obtained by integrating Eq. (I-1).

As written, this expression presupposes the desired solution, ©; (t) and

62(t). Therefore, it was assumed that, during each time interval, the
omparature changes in both the annulus and the intermediate shell pro-
gressed linearly, i.e.:

6 (t)
62 (t)

A + Bt (1-5)

M + Nt (1-6)

Also, at the temperatures and temperature differences involved in this .
calculation, the fourth power temperature difference in Eq. (1-1) can:
