MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT
SUMMARY

Part 1. Engineering and Component Development

 

1.1 Component Development and Testing

 

Development work on molten-salt-lubricated bearings was continued.

In the series of seven concluded tests the start-stop tolerance of journal
bearings made of INOR-8 was investigated. In all but two cases, tests
were carried to seizure or impending seizure. Time of operation ranged
from 3 to 379 hr. The largest number of start-stop cycles per test was
260. Signs of metal-to-metal rubbing were evident on bearing surfaces.
Serious ingassing was observed during bench tests of the hydrodynamic
thrust bearing. Remedial efforts are being continued, and further bench
tests are proposed.

Two pumps equipped with hydrodynamic bearings were bench tested and
then tested in molten salt. Seizure occurred in both after short operation
in salt, and the failures were attributed to dry bearings caused by ex-
cessive restrictions in the suction path of the bearings.

No evidence of self-welding was found between INOR-8 surfaces immersed
in molten salt at 1200°F. Coefficients of dry friction for INOR-8 on INOR-
8 and for INOR-8 on stainless steel were found to be fairly constant in
the 900 to 1800°F temperature range, a good average value being 0.25.

cluding the viewing equipment, “was. completed. The Layout’ is being modified

Eleven Tong-term corrosion Loops completed one year of operating time
in this quarter. Tests on two INOR-8 loops and one Inconel loop were ter-

minated for metallurgical examination; the results are not yet available.

One loop was shut down temporarily due to pump failure and a subsequent
oil fire. The test will be continued after repairs and reloading. The
second of three sample inserts was removed from loop 9354-4 after 10,000
hr of operation. Findings on this insert are described in Sec 2.1. Two
new INOR-8 loops were started up with BULT-1l4 salt. These loops have
double-walled inserts at the exit of the second resistance heater.

The PKP centrifugal pump with Fulton Sylphon bellows-mounted seal has
logged 17,878 hr of operation in NaK at 1200°F. Only negligible leakage
was observed. The MF-type centrifugal pump is operating in a region of
cavitation in salt 30, and service time of more than 20,000 hr has been
recorded to date. The average upper- and lower-seal leakage rates amounted
to 30 and 12 cc/day, respectively.

Trouble-free operation of the small frozen-lead pump seal continued.
Total service time is 12,000 hr. The large frozen-lead-seal test was dis-
continued.

An apparatus for testing graphite-metal seals is under construction.
A seal in the annulus between a 5-in.-0OD graphite tube and a larger, mating
Inconel section will be attempted first. |

Sectioning of the first two in-pile loops was completed, and metallo-
graphic and analytical examinations are in progress. A test program was
launched to explore the behavior of graphite under conditions similar to
those encountered in graphite-moderated molten-salt reactors. Bench tests
have been completed, and the first experiment is scheduled for insertion

in the MIR early in 1960.

1.2 Engineering Research
The viscosity of the fuel mixture BULT-14 (LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF,, 67-18.5-
0.5-14 mole %) was determined in the temperature range from 550 to 800°C.

 

Comparison with previous results on other salt compositions containing a
high percentage of ThF, shows a maximum deviation of 18% at the extremes

of the temperature range. Enthalpy measurements with the Bell-15 mixture
(LiF-BeF,-ThF,, 67-18-15 mole %) yielded a heat capacity varying from 0.343
Btu-1b~t. (°F)! at 1000°F to 0.304 Btu-1b™1.(°F)™! at 1500°F. The appa-
ratus for measuring the thermal expansion coefficient, B, of molten salt
mixtures was tested by using HTS (NaNO,-NaNO;-KNO;, 40-7-53 wt %). The
coefficient B was 3.63 X 1074 /°C between 215 and 315°C; comparison with

data obtained from density measurements shows good agreement.

Preliminary results were obtained for heat transfer with BULT-14 flow-
ing in heated Inconel and INOR-8 tubes. The system was operated continu-
ously for about five weeks without difficulty. Axial temperature profiles
show the effect of the laminar-turbulent transition in the hydrodynamic
boundary layer in the entrance section of the tube. The heat transfer ap-
pears to be about half that which would be predicted from earlier studies
with molten salts; this discrepancy may result from an uncertainty in the
value of the thermal conductivity for BULT-14 used in the analysis of the
data. A 23% difference between the results in the Inconel and INOR-8 tubes

cannot be explained, at present.

Part 2. Materials Studies

2.1 Metallurgy

In an effort to join graphite to graphite and graphite to metal for
molten-salt reactor service, an alloy (48 Ti—48% Zr—4% Be) was developed
and had satisfactory wetting and flowing characteristics. However, because
of its poor corrosion resistance to molten fluorides, other alloy systems
are being investigated. Promising alloys in the Au-Ni-Ta system are under
study, and alloys in the Ni-Nb, Ni-Mo, Ni-Nb-Mo, Ni-Nb-Ta, Pd-Ni-Ta, and
P&-Ni-Mo systems are being prepared for testing. Preliminary work in
electric-resistance brazing of graphite to graphite, using molybdenum as
the brazing alloy, has also been undertaken.

The second of three INOR-8 corrosion inserts was removed after 10,000
hr from an INOR-8 forced-convection loop.. Weight-loss evaluations indi-
cated the insert to have lost. 2.0 mg/cm?, which corresponds to a wall

thickness decrease’ of. 0. 09 mil, ir uniform removal of the wall is assumed.
Examination of three ‘Inconel forced-convection loops, which circulated

© fluorides. for ‘one year, vas ‘completed. Two of the loops showed normal at-

ack in the form. of intergranular and general voids. to a depth ranging from

 

1t0 14x mile. The ‘third loop. was. heavily attacked to depths ‘ranging from
18 to 3 38 mils. Salt in ‘the latter loop showed appreciable oxide contami-

nation.

Fifteen grades « of graphite were classiried ‘according to their resist-

ance to 3 permeation by molten fluorides at 150 psig at 1300°F in 100-hr

tests. Grade GT-123 was found to have a bulk-volume permeation of less

than 0.5%, the maximum specified for the reactor, despite the high test

 
 

 

 

pressure. Bismuth has been used to fill the accessible voids in AGOT
graphite prior to exposing it to molten salts. Tests are being conducted
to determine to what extent the bismuth-permeated graphite will pick up
salts during standard permeation tests.

When held in direct contact with graphite for 20 hr at 1300°F, LiF-
BeF,-UF, (62-37-1 mole %) apparently gettered completely the oxide contami-
nants in the graphite. No precipitation was detected radiographically in
the IiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (67:18.5-14-0.5 mole %) after it had been in contact
with graphite for 500 hr at 1300°F in a vacuum.

INOR-8 specimens showed no metallographic indications that carburiza-
tion had occurred after being in contact with TSF graphite at 1000 psi for
700 hr in salt environment at 1300°F.

Four braze materials showed good resistance to fuel 130 (LiF-BeF,-UF,,
62-37-1 mole %) during a 5000-hr corrosion test in a thermal-convection
loop with a 1300°F hot-leg temperature. Corrosion tests of 100-hr duration
indicated that the usefulness of titanium-, zirconium-, or beryllium-con-
taining vrezing alloys in fuel 130 would be limited in pure nickel or INOR-
8 containers at 1300°F. Heavy attack due to the transfer of the refractory

material to the nickel or INOR-8 container walls was observed.

2.2 Chemistry and Radiation Effects

 

Detailed description of the ten subsidiary binary and ternary systems
incorporated in the LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF, quaternary system is nearly completed.
Among the questions as yet incompletely answered by phase-equilibria studies
on breeder fuels is that of detailed crystallization paths for compositions
of reactor interest.

The identification of the isomorphic compounds NaF -BeF, - 3UF, and
NaF -BeF,«3ThF, is of especial academic interest since NaF-BeF,:3UF, has
been erroneously reported in the literature as NaF -4UFy..

The solubility of HF in molten fluoride breeder fuels has been cor-
related with solvent composition by means of a concentration scale based
on the excess or deficiency, in equivalent per cent, of alkali fluoride
for complete coordination of higher-valence cations in the solvent; that
is, Na,BeF, and NajZrF, correspond to complete coordination and represent -
the limit of complexing power of the cation.

Exchange reactions in molten fluorides, particularly those that might

be of interest in reprocessing schemes, are being explored. Many of the

vi

o)

reactions potentially useful for removing rare earths are subject to in-
terference by essential ingredients in the fuel.

The diffusion of chromium, which is the rate-limiting process for
long-term corrosion in molten fluoride breeders, is strongly dependent on
grain size, and hence on annealing history. Under equivalent conditions
there is no significant difference between the diffusion coefficients of
chromium in INOR-8 and in Inconel; thus the steady-state corrosion rate
is predicted to be higher by a factor of 15/7 in Inconel, since this is
the ratio of chromium concentration in the two alloys.

Except for ome unexplained and palpably misfunctioning case, sampled
corrosion test loops are demonstrating predictable and satisfactory be-
havior in long-term tests.

Exploratory studies on the hygroscopicity of fuels and on the possi-
bility of drying at low temperatures without extensive hydrolysis have
given additional qualitative evidence of the extreme sensitivity of the
fuels to moist air.

Evidence of formation of a graphite intercalation compound with MoFs
was found, but this compound is not expected to be encountered in reactor
operation. |

Several grades of extruded graphite, but none of the molded types,
show less than 1 vol % permeation by breeder fuels at 60 to 75 psig and

1300°F.

About 740 kg of purified fuel mixtures was processed during the quar-
ter. INOR-8& corrosion test capsules have been removed from the MIR after
5500 hr of exposure. ‘and a 75h uranium : burnup.

1.1 COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING

Molten-Salt-Lubricated Bearings for Fuel Pumps

Hydrodynamic Journal Bearings

 

Investigations of journal bearings operating in molten salt 130 (LiF-
BeF,-UF,, 62-37-1 mole %) were continued throughout the quarter. Four
tests were performed to investigate start~stop ability of carburized
INOR-8 journals operating at temperatures from 1200 to 1500°F in INOR-8
bearings having three axial grooves; three were conducted to investigate
performance of the three-helical-groove INOR-8 bearing at 1200°F. A test,
No. 22, of the performance of Inconel for comparison with INOR-8 is in
progress. All test pieces were fitted with a radial clearance of 0.005
in. (measured at room temperature). A summary of the test conditions is
presented in Table 1.1.1.

Test 15 was terminated when impending seizure became evident upon
restarting the run following a 30-min shutdown for repairs in the off-
gas line. The support pins were twisted and partially severed from the
bearing sleeve. This condition, a result of poor attachment, possibly
gave rise to the impending failure.

Test 16, which was a repeat of test 15 with new parts, was terminated
on schedule. Examination indicated that rubbing damage was somewhat less
than that experienced during a similar test at 1200°F.

Test 17 was terminated by seizure during start-stop cycle 129. The
test pieces exhibited galling and metal transfer, evidences of rubbing.

Test 18 was conducted - until seizure occurred between the bearing

and journal. They a aia not. meet dimensional specifications; the test

end of the grooves. The flow restrictor was a thin disk having an inside
diameter 0.010 in. larger than the inside diameter of the bearing. The

test was terminated because of a slight roughness in the drive-motor
power trace. Examination of the test pieces did not reveal any apparent
cause for this problem.

Test 21 was a continuation of test 20, except that the flow restric-
tion on the bearing grooves was reduced by adding a 1/16- by 1/16-in. V-
notch to the shim at each groove. The test was terminated by apparent
seizure in the 600-rpm run with 375 1b £ load. There was slight evidence
of rubbing between the test surfaces.

Test 22, now in progress, is being performed with an Inconel journal

and a three-axial-groove Inconel bearing.

Hydrodynamic Thrust Bearings

Bench tests were performed on the thrust-bearing tester with the
thrust bearing immersed in oil. Gross ingassing was found, and a number
of modifications were investigated as possible corrective measures. Sev-
eral of these were promising, but further bench testing with other modifi-

cations is in order prior to hot tests in molten salt.

Test of Pump Equipped with One Molten-Salt-ILubricated Journal Bearing
Bench tests were conducted on the original pump design, shown in
Fig. 1.1.1, to investigate the performance of the overhung motor, of
the oil slinger in pumping lubricant to the upper bearing, and of the
Journal bearing immersed in oil.
The overhung motor was found to exert a large rotating radial load.

Investigations. show, however, ‘that the load can be reduced to tolerable

 
    

levels if the- ‘electrical ‘balance of the motor is improved. ‘In the in-

 

“terest of speeding the investigation fa molten-salt bearing applied to

 

nT a pump, the” overhung. motor was temporarily replaced by a ‘conventional
- motor with a a flexible shaft c oupling Fig. 1.1. 2), which will isolate the
Lp shaft from the. ‘effects of 1m lance in ‘the motor.

 

    

The oil Slinger hed to be: modified ‘before satisfactory flow of lu-

 

bricant to: “the upper bearing could be attained. The modifications con-
sisted of slitting the. slinger. end 4nereasing the diemeter of ‘the oil

return ports.

Two journal-bearing configurations were tested in oil at room tem-
perature and in molten salt 130 (LiF-BeF,-UF,, 62-37-1 mole %) at 1200°F.
The oil tests were performed with the pump assembled except for the im-
peller; the complete assembly was operated in the tests with molten salt.
The first bearing tested had three axial grooves and was mounted rigidly.
The bearing operated successfully in oil under load, and the pump was
subsequently placed in operation with molten salt. The pump was rotated
for 10 min at 1000 rpm and another 10 min at 1200 rpm; at 1200 rpm the
pump delivered a flow of 100 gpm. The operation was terminated as a re-

sult of seizure of the pump rotary element, which is believed to have oc

curred in the molten-salt-lubricated journal bearing.

The other bearing had three helical grooves with a flow restriction
at the discharge (upper) end. The bearing was mounted flexibly on gim-
bals. It operated satisfactorily in oil but subsequently failed by sei-
zure in operation with molten salt.

Study of the configuration near the bearing revealed that the im-
peller hub probably presented too great a restriction to flow of salt
into the bearing at the lower end; the bearing therefore pumped itself
dry in the molten-salt tests. This condition was probably responsible
for both the failures. During the oil tests this condition was not
present, since they were made without the impeller present. The flow
passage into the bearing has been increased by removal of material from
the impeller hub and the lower end of the bearing sleeve. Preparations

are being made for a third test.

Self-Welding of INOR-8

 

One INOR-8 self-welding experiment was performed at 1200°F, on loose-

fitting pins pressing against the sides of holes, a condition encountered
with gimbal-mounted bearings. The test was performed in a bath of molten
salt 107 for 1000 hr under a load of 200 Ib. Examination of the test

pieces revealed no evidence of self-welding. A similar test will be per-

formed at 1500°F.

Friction Tests on INOR-8

 

Friction tests were performed at MIT! on INOR-8 rubbing against INOR-8

and on INOR-8 against stainless steel. Four tests were performed, each of

which covered a temperature range of 70 to 1830°F. The relation between
the coefficient of friction and temperature is shown in Fig. 1.1.3. Note
that in each test the coefficient drops off over the range of 700 to 900°F

and then, in general, remains at approximately 0.25 on up to 1830°F.

Mechanical Seals for Pumps
The modified Fulton Sylphon bellows-mounted seal, ? undergoing test

in a PKP type of centrifugal pump, has accumulated an additional 3048 hr
of operation since the previous report period, for a total of 17,878 hr.
The pump continues to operate at constant conditions of 1200°F loop tem-
perature, 2400-rpm shaft speed, and 1200-gpm NaK flow. The seal leakage
in both the test seal and the Durametallic upper seal has been negligible.
The pump was stopped once to check the drive-motor brushes.

MF Performance Loop
An MF type of centrifugal pump has continued in operation? and has
logged more than 20,000 hr of continuous operation. Since the previous
report period the pump has continued operation in a region of cavitation

at 2700 rpm, 645 gpm, and 2.5 psig pump-tank cover gas pressure in molten

to replace the air filter on the motor-generator set and once (for 10 min)
to replace the brushes in the d-c drive motor. The pump upper - and lower-
seal leakage rates have averaged approximately 30 and 12 ce /day, respec-

tively.

Frozen-lead Pump Seal
The small frozen-lead pump seal being tested on a 3/16-in.-dia shaft,

 

as described previously,? has operated continuously since the start of its
operation on June 13, 1958. The accumulated operating time, as of October
31, 1959, was 12,000 hr. There was slight leakage of lead during the first
100 hr of operation; there has been no further leakage.

Testing of the large frozen-lead pump seal was discontinued.

Remote Maintenance Demonstration Facility

 

Construction of the equipment in the Remote Maintenance Demonstration
Facility was completed during July. The entire loop of piping (made of
3-1/2- and 6-in. Inconel pipes) was stress-relieved at 1500°F for 2 hr.

A check of torque settings on the bolts of the freeze flanges after the
stress-relieving operation revealed that all suffered loss of tightness;
in some instances the bolt torque was reduced to as little as 40% of the
original setting. To assure constant bolt torque on the freeze flange
joints during thermal cycling, the use of disk springs was suggested.
Three sets of Bellville-type springs are presently being tested for this
application.

A system of controlling the air flow to the cooling passages of the
freeze flanges was designed, and construction drawings were completed.

It is believed that such a flow control will eliminate the adverse effects
of the differential thermal expansion between the Inconel flanges and
copper seal rings and will improve the gas-tightness of the system during
thermal cyclings.

The loop was tested for vacuum-tightness with the flange bolts tight-
ened to their original setting after stress-relieving. A pressure rise
of 52 pu was recorded in a 56-hr period with the loop isolated. The system

was originally evacuated to 17 u.

Television equipment for remote viewing of the cell has been in-
\ stalled. The closed-circuit system consists of four remotely operated
cameras. Two of these, equipped with three-lens turrets and used as a
+ stereo pair (Fig. 1.1.4), are mounted on a dolly and are free to travel

the whole length of the cell on a rail mounted on top of the control room.

J

The other two, with "auto zoom" lenses, are mounted in other locations of
the cell. The complement of cameras allows nearly 90% coverage of the
cell. All four cameras feed into a pair of monitors mounted on a stereo
viewer above the General Mills menipulator console (Fig. 1.1.5).

The picture quality and equipment reliability were not satisfactory
during ‘early operation; however, with the assistance of a factory repre-
sentative, local maintenance personnel were able to correct most of the
difficulties. Upon completion of suggested modifications, the frequency
of maintenance on the viewing equipment was reduced, at times, from 1 in
24 hr to 1 in 200 hr of operation.

Remotely viewed operation of the General Mills manipulator and over

head crane was started in September. Tasks successfully executed by re-

mote means to date include removal and installation of the PK salt pump,

its motor, the dump tank, the freeze valve, the electric heater and in-
sulation unit, and the heat exchanger.

Numerous modifications were incorporated in the loop, as the need
arose, either to improve visibility through the cameras or to facilitate
maintenance operations. Removal and installation of the heat exchanger,
for example, were made practicable by providing guide pins and funnels
at the mating flanges and by adding a screw-jack mechanism to close and
back away the heat exchanger (Figs. 1.1.6 and 1.1.7).

A variety of tools were fabricated and are in use in conjunction
with the overhead crane and the manipulator.

Remote removal of the core vessel is scheduled prior to running -
molten salt through the loop. Upon completion of the salt run the dis-

assembly-assembly cycle will be repeated on all components.

Design, Construction, and Operation of Materials-Testing Loops

Forced-Circulation Corrosion Loops

 

The operation of long-term forced-circulation corrosion-testing loops
was continued. Table 1.1.2 gives a summary of 16 loop operations during
the period, with accumulated hours of operation at test conditions. Eleven
of the loops have operated for a full year. (Four other loops with one
year of operation had been terminated earlier.)

Operation of INOR-8 loops MSRP-8 and -9 and Inconel loop 9377-4 was
terminated during this period for metallurgical examination. The two
INOR-8 loops had operated without an incident; no dumping or freeze-up
of the salt was experienced in the loops although both sustained at least

five building-power failures. The LFB pump in the Inconel loop had been

Examination of the loops is in progress.

INOR-8 loop 9354-3 was shut down in September when a pump failure
resulted in an oil fire. The pump has been replaced, and operation of
the loop will be resumed on receipt of a new batch of salt.

INOR-8 loop 9354-4 was shut down in September, after 10,000 hr of
operation, for the removal of the second of three sample inserts’ con-
tained in the hot leg. Results of the examination of this insert are
given in Sec 2.1 of this report. Operation was resumed with the remaining
(third) insert.

INOR-8 loops MSRP-7 and -10 were shut down for the removal of tubing
sections from the hot leg after 8760 hr (one year) of operation. The sec-
tions were replaced and operation was resumed. The sections are now being
examined by the Metallurgy Section.

Two new INOR-8 loops, MSRP-14 and -15, were placed in operation with
salt BULT-14 in October. Both loops contain molten-salt sampling devices

and three jacketed insert sections. The double-walled inserts were placed

at the exit of the second resistance-heater section as shown in Fig. 1.1.8.

The close-fitting combination of jacket and insert was designed to give
the same cross section and flow ares as the matching loop tubing. Loop
MSRP-14 is operating with a high wall temperature of 1300°F, and MSRP-15
with a high wall temperature of 1400°F.

Graphite-Metal Seal Tests

 

Several designs for graphite-to-metal frozen-salt seals have been
proposed. In the first of the configurations to be tested, the frozen-
salt seal will be formed in a narrow annulus between a 5-in.-0D graphite
tube and a slightly larger Inconel tube. Such a seal could be used in
a molten-salt breeder reactor as the seal between the fuel salt and
breeder salt. A sectional view of the test-joint design is shown in Fig.
1.1.9.

Manufacture of parts for the seal-test apparatus is nearly complete,
and construction of the test loop has been started. It is expected that
the first test of the seal will be made before the end of November 1959.

The viscosity of the fuel mixture BULT-14 (LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF,, 67-
18.5-0.5-14 mole %) was obtained by using the skirted capillary efflux
viscometer. The data from three separate determinations using different
viscometer cups are given in Fig. 1.2.1. Also plotted is the correlating
line derived by a least-squares analysis of these data; in the temperature
range from 550 to 800°C, this analysis yielded the equation

where pu 1s the viscosity in centipoises and T is the absolute temperature
(°K). The viscosity of the BULT-14 mixture is compared in Fig. 1.2.2 with

Mixtures,

(LiF-BeF,~ThF,-UF,, 62-36.5-1-0.5 mole %), and Bell-15 (LiF-BeF,-ThF,,
67-18-15 mole %). The viscosities of the three high-thorium-content salts
deviate by a maximum of 18% (at the extremes of the temperature range).
This large variation is rather surprising in view of the small composition
change between Bell-15 and BULT-14; the viscosities of these two mixtures
will be redetermined in the near future.

vicinity of x/d = 10. Further, the location of this temperature peak
should be related to the configuration of the tube entrance in that the
transition should occur farther downstream for a rounded entrance than
for a sharp-edged entrance. This may explain the shift in the location
of the peak between the curves a and b of Fig. 1.2.9; this same difference
between the temperature patterns in the Inconel and INOR-8 sections has
been observed in all runs made to date. Although a sharp-edged entrance
was specified for both sections, welding of the thin-walled tubes into
the heating lugs (mixing-chamber end plates) may have altered this situ-
ation. Thus it is not possible at this time to define exactly the en-
trance configuration. Far downstream (x/d > 40) the temperature curves
assume the character observed in earlier studies with molten salts® under
similar conditions of uniform heat input at the wall and established flow
and temperature fields.

2.1 METALLURGY
Graphite Brazing Studies

Graphite has been proposed for use as the moderator of a molten-salt
reactor. This material could be placed in the core in simple shapes or
as a complex structure such as a heat exchanger that would form a section
of the primary loop system. The latter case would probably require graph-
1te-to-graphite and graphite-to-metal Joints that have structural integrity
and, to an extent, leak-tightness.

A program has consequently been initiated to investigate various tech-
niques for producing joints with graphite and to evaluate their usefulness
for molten-salt-reactor service. A preliminary literature survey revealed
a notable scarcity of joining techniques applicable to high-temperature-
reactor technology. Procedures for wetting graphite are relatively well
known, but experience in producing reliable joints in complex assemblies
is lacking. One serious problem is related to the gross differences be-
tween the thermal-expansion coefficient of graphite and those of common
brazing alloys and structural materials.

Metals having a strong tendency to form carbides wet graphite readily
when they are molten. Therefore, alloys containing these carbide-forming
metals appear promising as brazing alloys for joining graphite to itself
and to metals. Zirconium and titanium appear especially attractive, since
their thermal-expansion coefficients are relatively low (see Table 2.1.1)

and since their melting points can be reduced significantly by only small

additions of other element

 

~loy, a AA pipe toa a type AGOT graphite sheet.

Brazed joints made with this alloy appear to possess good strength

and seem promising for a variety of high-temperature -reactor applications.

For molten-salt service, however, the uses of this particular alloy are
limited by its poor resistance to corrosion in this medium (see "Brazing
Material Evaluation in Fuel 130," this section).

This development of other brazing-alloy systems is therefore being
undertaken in an effort to find more compatible materials. Utilizing
niobium, tantalum, and molybdenum as the primary carbide-forming elements,
a number of alloy systems are being studied in detail to determine their
applicability for joining graphite. Alloys in the Au-Ni-Ta system have
indicated promising wetting characteristics, and several alloy compositions
from the gold-rich corner of the ternary diagram have been selected for
further study. The relatively high thermal-expansion coefficients of gold-
rich alloys, however, may limit their use for joining graphite. Other al-
loy systems which will be investigated include Ni-Mo, Ni-Nb, Ni-Nb-Mo,
Ni-Nb-Ta, Pd-Ni-Ta, and Pd-Ni-Mo.

Preliminary experiments have also been undertaken to determine the
feasibility of electric-resistance bonding of graphite to graphite, using

molybdenum as the braze metal. So far, experiments have been confined to

on the weight changes of “INOR-8 in contact with a beryllium-base. fluoride
fuel mixture. The schedule specified removal of one insert after 5000
hr of exposure, another after 10,000 hr, and the third after 15,000 hr.
Operation of the loop began in July 1958 under the conditions:

Minimum salt temperature 1100°F

Examination of the second insert, although not yet complete, indicates
that an average weight loss of 2.0 mg/cm? (23%) occurred along its 4-in.
length. If uniform removal of surface metal is assumed, this weight loss
corresponds to a loss in wall thickness of 0.09 mil. No detectable loss
in wall thickness was noted in comparing micrometer measurements of the
inserts taken before and after test.

The first of the inserts; which was removed from the loop after 5000
hr, showed a weight loss of 1.8 mg/cm? (¥2%), or a loss in wall thickness
of 0.08 mil. The similarity of these values to the values obtained after
10,000 hr indicates that no significant weight loss occurred after the
first 5000 hr of loop operation. The errors listed with these values are
based on estimated limits of precision of the instruments used to measure

As previously reported, a surface layer or film similar in appearance
to that found on the 10,000-hr insert has been noticed on specimens removed \
from most of the long-time INOR-8 thermal- and forced-convection tests.

Samples of this film are being studied, but no results are availsble. The
band of precipitates and fine grains found along the surfaces of the in-
serts has not been observed in other tests of INOR-8. At present it is
not known whether these fine grains represent a second phase or only re-

crystallization of the matrix near the inside surfaces of the insert. There

is reason to suspect the latter possibility, since a reaming operation was

performed on the inserts prior to service and undoubtedly induced some
cold work along the inside surfaces. A review of the recrystallization
properties of INOR-8 indicates that recrystallization of the material can
be initiated at 1300°F following prior cold work.? Grain growth of the
recrystallized material would be extremely slow at this temperature, which
would help to explain the extremely fine crystallites apparent. a.
Examination of Three Inconel Pump Loops. — Chemical and metallographic
results have been obtained for three Inconel pump loops which completed

 

one year's operation. Operating conditions for these loops are shown in
Table 2.1.2.

Metallographic examination of loop 9344-1, which circulated salt 123 .
for 8760 hr at a maximum temperature of 1300°F, showed heavy attack in the
form of intergranular and general voids along both heater legs, as shown -
in Fig. 2.1.8. In the first heater leg, attack ranged from 18 to 31 mils
in depth and in the second leg, from 18 to 38 mils., The unheated bend

connecting the two legs revealed only a few pits, not over 1 mil, and the
cold-leg sections showed only slight surface roughening and surface pit-
ting. No cold-leg deposits were observed visually or metallographically.

Chemical analyses of the fused-salt mixture before and after circu-

lation in. this loop are shown in Table 2.1.3. Note that an extremely large

increase in chromium concentration occurred during the test, along with a

- reduction in uranium concentration. “Optical examination of the salt dis-

closed. a brown. phase consisting: of about equal amounts of UO, and NaF -BeF;.
An x-ray. examination of this phase confirmed the presence of U0,. Thus
the salt ‘appears to have. ‘undergone extensive extraneous oxidation either
before or during the test. oo

Metallographic examination of loop 9344s 2, which operated for 8760
hr at a maximum temperature of 1200°F with salt 12, showed moderate attack

in the form of intergranular and general voids along both heater legs. In

41

 
 

 

 

the first heater leg, attack ranged from 1 to 3 mils in depth and in the
second leg, from 4 to 8 mils. The cold-leg sections and the unheated bend
connecting the two hot legs revealed light intergranular voids to 1 mil.
The coolant salt in this loop was replaced three times because of operating
difficulties.

A somewhat higher rate of attack occurred in loop 9377-3, which cir-
culated salt 131 for 8760 hr at a maximum temperature of 1300°F. Exami-
nation of the heater sections revealed attack in the form of heavy inter-
granular and general voids, ranging from 2 to 8 mils in the first heater
leg and from 6 to 14 mils in the second leg. The unheated bend connecting
the two legs showed only light surface roughening except in one region
where a few isolated voids to a maximum depth of 11 mils were found. The
cold-leg sections revealed only a few pits, all less than 1 mil.

Chemical analyses of salt 131 before and after circulation in loop
9377-3 are shown in Table 2.1.4. Except for the increase in chromium con-
centration, these analyses show little difference.

The present status of all forced-circulation loop tests now in prog-

ress is given in Sec 1.1 of this report.

Permeation of Graphite by Molten Salts

 

The permeation of various grades of graphite by molten fluoride salts
is being investigated in tests? at 1300°F (704°C) for 100 hr at 150 psig,
using the weight increase of the test specimen to calculate the volume of
graphite that is permeated by the salt. Table 2.1.5, a summary of results,
lists 15 grades of graphite in order of resistance to permeation. These
grades were manufactured as low-permeability graphite, with the exception
of CT-158, CCN, CEYB, R-0013, AGOT, and TSF. The permeation values for
the pipe material are considered high, because no effort was made to seal
the ends of the pipe specimens to prevent the exposure of the more contin-
uous and accessible voids produced in the axial direction as a result of
fabrication. Pipe specimens with sealed ends are being made to be tested
for permeation, since values for them should be more applicable to reactor
designs.

Most of the testing was done with LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (67-18.5-14-0.5
mole %); however, NaF-ZrF,-UF, (56-40-4 mole %) and LiF-BeF,-UF, (62-37-1
mole %) were also used. Under the test conditions the extent of permeation
by the three salt mixtures was essentially the same; other test conditions
will be investigated. No wetting of the graphite by the salts was ob-
served.

Salt permeation studies with additional grades of graphite, including
studies to show the effect of exposure time and graphite shape, were begun.

An effort is being made to preclude the fuel pickup by initially fill-
ing accessible void spaces in ‘the graphite with: bismuth, thus allowing no

 

space for ‘the salt. Approximately. 60% of the accessible void spaces of

.  AGOT. graphite _specimens. vere filled with bismuth’ ‘when held at 1022°F for
4 hr oat 125 psig. Tests. were “begun. to determine the ‘extent to which these

Removal of Oxide Contaminants from Graphite
Previous tests have shown that exposing graphite to fuel 130 (1LiF-
BeF,-UF,, 62-37-1 mole %) at 1300°F (704°C) will result in the precipita-
tion of UO,, and that this reaction is essentially complete within 5 hr
when the fuel is in vapor-phase contact or in direct contact with the
graphite. This indicated that oxide contamination might be removed from

the graphite by vapor-phase or direct-contact gettering. Results that

a4

indicated partial success in two such tests, with fuel 130 as the gettering
agent, have been reported.’

A direct-gettering test, which has been completed, was apparently
successful in removing oxide contaminants from the graphite. In the test
a charge of fuel 130 was in direct contact with an AGOT graphite crucible
for 20 hr at 1300°F (704°C) in a vacuum. The ratio of the bulk volume of
the graphite to the volume of the salt was 27:1 (an arbitrary standard
selected for such tests). Radiographic examinations at room temperature
indicated that a normal quantity of UO, had precipitated. The gettering
charge of fuel 130 was removed and replaced by a fresh charge of fuel 130,
which was held an additional 20 hr at 1300°F. Radiographic examination
showed no precipitation, indicating that the preceding gettering operation
was successful.

Since the cost of fuel 130 would make it an uneconomical gettering
agent to use on a full-scale reactor, cheaper gettering agents are also
being investigated. A hydrogen test is in progress.

Tests similar to those described above are being made with LiF-BeF,-
ThF,-UF, (67-18.5-14-0.5 mole %). Three such tests with AGOT graphite
have continued for 500 hr, and no precipitation has been detected in the

salt by radiographic examinations.

Compatibility of INOR-8 and Graphite in Direct Contact

The tendency for INOR-8 to carburize when in direct contact with
graphite is being investigated as part of the over-all INOR-8-graphite—
salt compatibility program. TSF - grade graphite and INOR-8 specimens were
held in contact at 1300°F at 1000 psi. ‘Modified stress-rupture apparatus

was: used, “and the tests were ‘held in’ salt environments to simulate reactor

- conditions. : Metallographic examination of specimens held for 700 hr in
| NeF-KF- -LiF-UF,, (11. 2-4145., 3-2.5 mole %) revealed no evidence’ of carburi-
zation. “Tests for 3400 hr in NeF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) have been com-

pleted, end “the test specimens are now being examined.

Brazing Material Evaluation in Fuel 130

for use in the Molten- Salt Reactor, the corrosion resistance of brazing

alloys which may be useful in the fabrication of metal-to-metal joints in
such a heat exchanger is being evaluated. The method used to subject
brazing alloys to the corrosive environment in the hot leg of a thermal-
convection loop has been described earlier,® and corrosion test results

on a series of brazing alloys subjected to fuel 130 (LiF-BeF,-UF,;, 62-37-1
mole %) for 1000 hr at a 1300°F hot-leg temperature in such a loop have
been reported.”

‘The results of a 5000-hr test made under the same conditions are out-
lined in Table 2.1.6, Copper, gold-nickel, and the Coast Metals alloys
showed good corrosion resistance. A depleted region to a depth of 3 mils
was observed along each of the Coast Metals alloy fillets after the test.
Results of earlier corrosion tests on these alloys in NaF-ZrF,-base fuels
and in liquid metals indicated that this depletion was due to the leaching
of the minor constituents boron and silicon from the alloy by the bath,
and it appears that boron and silicon are also being leached by fuel 130.
This depletion has no detrimental effect on the alloy, since a nickel-rich,
corrosion-resistant matrix is left. A 10,000-hr thermal-convection-loop
test on Inconel and INOR-8 lap joints brazed with the five brazing ma-
terials listed in Table 2.1.6 is in progress.

Some refractory-metal-base alloys, being developed by the Welding and

Brazing Group for possible application in Joining graphite to graphite,

were given a static corrosion test in fuel 130 for 100 hr at 1300°F. Nickel,

because of its comparative inertness to fluorides, was used as the test-
container material. Test results, listed in Table 2.1.7, showed large
weight losses for each alloy. In order to determine the alloying element
or elements responsible for the heavy attack, the following static corro-
sion tests in fuel 130 were conducted at 1300°F: (1) titanium was tested
in containers of titanium, nickel, and INOR-8, (2) zirconium was tested
in containers of zirconium, nickel, and INOR-8, and (3) beryllium was
tested in a nickel container. Large weight losses (Table 2.1.8) were ob-
served for specimens tested in nickel or nickel-base containers, while
small weight losses were found when specimen and container were of the

same metal. Substituting an INOR-8 (containing 70% Ni) container for one

Phase Equilibrium Studies

 

The System BeF,-ThF,-UF,
The most favorable fuels for breeding with molten fluorides are ob-

 

tained from the LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, quaternary system. Of the ten binary
and ternary systems which are incorporated as limiting cases in this qua-
ternary system, only the system BeF,-ThF,-UF, has not been described pre-
viously. Spot checks have shown that only two primary phases, those of
BeF, and of the ThF,-UF, solid solution, are involved in the BeF,-ThF,-
UF, phase diagram. As in the ThF,-UF, binary system, no minimum exists
in the ThE, -UF,, solid-solution liquidus surface in the ternary system.
Isotherms for such of the liquidus surface in the ternary system can be
approximated by straight lines between the bounding binary systems BeF,-

ThF, and BeF,-UF,.

The System BeF,-Th¥,

Some of the information on previously reported! preliminary phase

 

diagrams for BeF,-ThF, was uncertain because BeF,-ThF, mixtures containing
more than 75 mole % BeF, are too viscous to reach equilibrium, even in
periods as long as three weeks. This difficulty is greatly alleviated by
small additions of NaF or LiF, and the BeF,-ThF, binary diagram has now
been established with the aid of short extrapolations from work on the
ternary systems. Figure 2.2.1, showing a eutectic at 527°C and 2 mole %

ThF, , is regarded as a final diagram.

The system Neel ThE, |
Continuing studies of the phase equilibria in the system NaF-BeF,-

mE, ‘have established that this system involves 12 invariant equilibrium
points. Of these, ten have been established to within 1 mole % and 5°C;
these ten are Listed in Table 2.2.1.

used; of these, NaF-LiF has the largest capacity for ZrF,, but in this

 

case liquidus temperatures approaching 600°C are encountered at 25 mole %
ZrF,.

Exploratory investigations of the phase equilibria in the system NaF-
BeF,-ZrF, have shown that NaF-BeF, (69-31 mole %) affords a solvent for
ZrF, which will accommodate as much as 52 mole % of ZrF, in solution at
temperatures below 550°C and that no liquidus temperatures higher than
570°C will be encountered on the composition path between NaF-BeF, (69-31
mole %) and NaF-BeF,-ZrF, (33-15-52 mole %).

mole % UF, have failed to confirm the existence of a compound with this
composition, which was reported by Eichelberger et al.? in their investi-
gation of the system NaF-BeF,-UF,. Moreover, studies at this laboratory
in the system NaF-BeF,-ThF, have shown that a primary-phase field exists
corresponding to the "NaF-:4UF," primary-phase field in the system NaF-BeF,-
UF, and that the primary phase in this case is NaF-BeF,-3ThF,. This com-

pound is analogous in optical properties to the so-called "NaF-4UF," as

BeF,+3ThF,, it seems probable that the compound reported by the Mound Lab- =
oratory is actually NaF-BeF,-3UF,.

Gas Solubilities in Molten Fluorides

 

Solubility of HF in Fuel Solvents
As previously reported, 4:3 the solubility of HF has been measured

 

 

over wide composition ranges in both BeF,~- and ZrF,-base solvents. In
each type of system, compositions rich in alkali fluorides showed marked
increases in the solubility and in the heat of solution of HF. The tran-
sition to higher values appeared to occur as the alkali fluoride content
exceeded the stoichiometry for complete complexing of the Bett as BeF,
and the Zr* as ZrF,  , thereby providing "free" fluorides for forming
HF, .

Several schemes were examined in an attempt to correlate the solu-
bility of HF with the composition of the solvent. One which works well
is the use of a composition scale in terms of equivalent per cent free
NeF as shown in Fig. 2.2.2. Compositions corresponding to Na,BeF, and
Na;ZrF, are considered to contain 0% excess NaF. Other compositions con-
tain an excess or a deficiency of NaF; equivalents are calculated on the
basis of 2 for Na,BeF, and 3 for Na;ZrF, in obtaining equivalent per cent
compositions according to this scheme.

Figures 2.2.3, 2.2.4, and 2.2.5, applying to different temperatures,
demonstrate the good correlation achieved for solubilities in NaF-ZrF, and
NaF-BeF, compositions. Solubilities are expressed in terms of the Henry's
law constant. The curves in the figures are logarithmic and give straight-
line plots on semilog paper. The effects of both temperature and compo-

sition are accommodated in the expression

Fission-Product Behavior

 

Exchange Reactions in Molten Fluorides

 

Experiments with exchange reactions for reprocessing molten-salt re-
actor fuels have continued.® Important characteristics for potential solid
exchange reactants are insolubility in molten fluorides and chemical in-
ertness toward reactor fuel constituents.

Studies of oxide reactions in molten fluorides have shown that the
rare-earth oxides are sufficiently insoluble to qualify as possible ex-
change agents. The exchange of Ce0, with cerium ion in the solvent LiF-NaF

(60-40 mole %) and the effect of subsequently added CeF; on the equilibrium
CexF5 (2) + Ce0,(s) = Ce*0, + CeFy

are shown in Fig. 2.2.6. Similarly, in the same solvent, the removal of
lanthanum-tracer activity with Lap03 and the effect of subsequent additions
of CeF3 are shown in Fig. 2.2.7. These experiments, while not carried out
in realistic fuels, nevertheless illustrate the effectiveness of exchange
processes in molten fluorides. The exchange of lanthanum with cerium is
interesting as a possible method for replacing nuclear poisons, such as
samarium, gadolinium, and europium, with more innocuous rare earths such

as cerium. Unfortunately, as shown in Fig. 2.2.8, CeO, reacts readily with

+)

UF, in the solvent LiF-NaF (60-40 mole %). Hence, reprocessing with rare-
earth oxides would probably be limited to reactor fuels from which uranium
had been removed by prior treatment. Figure 2.2.9 illustrates the unfavor-
able effect of ThF, and BeF, on the removal of tracer-cerium activity from
solution by exchange with CeO.

Experiments to investigate the exchange properties of carbides are
also under way. The results of two experiments to study the removal of
hafnium activity with hafnium carbide are shown in Fig. 2.2.10. These re-
sults illustrate the unfavorable effect of UF, on the exchange reaction
in the solvent LiF-BeF, (63-37 mole %).

Attempts to remove barium activity with Cr,0; and BeQO from the solvent
LiF-BeF,-ThF, (67-18-15 mole %) were not successful. Similarly an attempt
to remove cerium activity from the same solvent with Be0 was unsuccessful.
The addition of Al,04 to LiF-BeF ,-ThF, (67-18-15 mole %) containing cerium
activity caused the precipitation of ThF, without any detectable removal
of cerium activity from solution.

These experiments show that exchange reactions for reprocessing molten-
salt reactor fuels are in many cases adversely affected by essential con-
stituents in the fuels. The presence of thorium and beryllium, for example,
interferes with exchange reactions involving CeO, and HfC. Further searches

for suitable exchange agents will include the rare-earth carbides.

Chemistry of Corrosion Processes

 

Self-Diffusion Coefficients for Chromium in Nickel Alloys
A preponderance of the evidence ‘accumulated over many years indicates
that corrosion of nickel-chromium alloys by: molten fluorides under aniso-

thermal conditions should Teach a steady-state rate controlled by diffusion

of chromium in the’ metal in “the colder” part of the system. For. this reason
the value of the. diffusion coefficient for chromium has been of paramount

interest. 7

Data from ‘several: aiffusion experiments, enploying crt as a tracer,

. have been partially digested. “The ‘alloy specimens studied may be grouped

ments: Inconel annealed at 800°C for 8 to 12 hr, Inconel annealed at

a high-temperature investigation conducted on similar alloys by Russian
investigators, ? are shown for comparison.

It has been found that grain size, and therefore the annealing history
prior to the diffusion experiments, has a marked effect on the diffusion
coefficients. For example, photomicrographs of Inconel specimens H; and
H, revealed that the average grain size was much greater in H, than in H;.
The effect of annealing conditions is easily seen by comparing curves 5
and 7 of Fig. 2.2.11 and also the individual values for H; and Hy. An ad-
ditional annealing effect is manifest in the reproducibility of diffusion
behavior. The data of curve 7 (specimens annealed at 800°C) tend to show
a higher degree of scattering than those of curve 5 (specimens annealed
at 1150°C), which suggests that an 800°C annealing temperature fails to

eliminate grain variations which might exist between specimens.

The over-all diffusion coefficients obtained for INOR-8 specimens are
shown as points on curve 6 of Fig. 2.2.11. At temperatures greater than
700°C, the INOR-8 coefficients are of the same magnitude as the Inconel
coefficients. This means that the rates of chromium diffusion in INOR-8
are approximately 7/15 of the rates in Inconel, at least at higher temper-
atures. The ratio 7/15 corresponds to the ratio of the chromium concen-
trations in the alloys. |

At temperatures below 700°C, the INOR-8 coefficients appear to fall
considerably below the Inconel coefficients. This sudden drop might afford
a partial explanation of the encouragingly low molten-salt corrosion rates
exhibited by INOR-8 within the 500 to 700°C temperature range.

Another point of interest is that observed corrosion results fre-
quently represent considerably faster rates than predicted on the basis
of diffusion in the cold zone as the rate-controlling step if the diffu-
sion coefficients from Fig. 2.2.11 are used. This suggests that there is
frequently an extended period of uncompensated oxidation, largely extra-
neous, which precedes the establishment of a steady-state regime. An ex-

treme example of this is described in the next section.

Chemical Analyses of Corrosion Test Loops

Periodic sampling to follow the corrosion behavior in pumped loop
systems has continued.!® An INOR-8 loop, containing LiF-BeF,~ThF, -UF,
(62-36.5-1-0.5 mole %) has been operating for 9300 hr with a hot-zone tem-
perature of 1300°F and a cold-zone temperature of 1100°F. As shown in Fig.
2.2.12, the chromium content reached a steady-state value of 500 ppm after
about 1000 hr. Sampling was “temporarily ‘discontinued after 5000 hr in
order to maintain a sufficient fuel volume: in the loop; the scheduled test

period for the loop is 15, 000 hr. This > Loop appears to be following the

‘predicted behavior.

By contrast, an Inconel loop, operating ‘under the same conditions,

has shown a steady increase in: ‘chromium concentration in the fuel as il-
© lustrated in Fig. 2. 2. 13. After about 2000 hr some additional fuel was
~~ added to compensate for the depletion ‘due’ to sample removals. A slight

- dilution of ‘the chromium ion: concentration was reflected in the analyses.

sump; this resulted in another dilution because, contrary to intended op-
erating procedures, a large residue of uncirculated salt had remained in
the sump since the original filling. As the chromium concentration has
increased to 4730 ppm in 7000 hr, the uranium concentration has dropped
from 2.8 to 1.5 wt %. This is the behavior predicted for continuing ex-
posure to an extraneous oxidant, such as air, but a rigorous examination
of the system did not disclose any evidence of a leak or other means of
exposure to air.

In another loop, of INOR-8, a salt mixture with a higher concentration
of uranium, LiF-BeF,-UF; (70-10-20 mole %), has been pumped under similar
conditions for 5500 hr. The analyses suggest, as shown in Fig. 2.2.14,
that the expected steady-state chromium concentration has not yet been
reached; this is somewhat surprising.

Three additional test loops, scheduled for periodic sampling, were

placed in operation during the past quarter.

Solubility of CrF, in LiF-BeF, (62-38 Mole %)

The solubility of CrF, in LiF-BeF, (62-38 mole %) was found to be

for FeF, in LiF-BeF, (62-38 mole %) is pure FeF,; this is still being veri-
fied. The smaller equilibrium quotients in LiF-BeF, result from stronger

complexing in a more basic solvent.

Hygroscopic Behavior and Dehydration of Breeder Fuels

It has been generally recognized that breeder fuels based on LiF-BeF,
as solvent are very hygroscopic and prone to hydrolysis, but no specific
experimental evaluation of the problem had been made. Some salts can be
dried without extensive hydrolysis, and drying at low temperatures is fre-
quently helpful.t? Trials were made to explore the prospects for removing
water from breeder fuels at low temperatures. Two compositions, LiF-BeF,-
UF, (62-37-1 mole %) and LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (62-36.5-1-0.5 mole %), were
prepared by melting with ammonium bifluoride. These preparations were then
examined by x-ray diffraction and microscopic techniques and found to be
typical samples. Only traces of UO, were present.

A sample of each, ground to 100 mesh and weighing approximately 10 g,
was placed in a nickel crucible and exposed to water-saturated air at room
temperature. The initial rate of weight increase was 2.0% per day for each
composition. As exemplified in Fig. 2.2.15, for the sample with ThF,,
after 40 days the total weight of the sample had increased by 23% and the
rate of increase was 0.32% per day; for the sample without ThF, the corre-
sponding values were 30% and 0.38% per day. These weight percentages are
based on the original weight before exposure. The samples were then placed
in an oven exposed to air at 133°C. Within 24 hr they had returned to the
original weights. But on continuing the drying to obtain a constant weight,
the samples continued to arop very. slowly to values 0.3 and 0.4%, respec-
tively, below the starting weight. Unfortunately, the salts at this state
could not be distinguished from uncontaminated fuel by either x-ray dif-
~ fraction or ‘petrographic. techniques.

The samples were “then melted in a vacuum dry box at 30 to 50 pu, and
a release of gas ‘bubbles was observed. There was a further weight loss
of 0.6 and 1%, respectively, for the samples with and without ThF,. At

~ this stage | the samples were ‘predominantly green with many small black

areas. The green portion had a higher UO, content than the starting ma-
terials; the black portions were predominantly UO,, and it was estimated
that from 20 to 40% of the uranium had been converted to UO,. Evidently
the uranium had served as an oxide scavenger for the melt.

A second pair of samples was treated as gbove except that the baking
in air was eliminated. Each sample went directly from the humidifier to
the vacuum dry box, where it was dried at 135°C for 2 hr at 30 to 50 p and
then melted. Bubbling occurred as before, and the final samples were 1.5
and 1% below the starting weight. The samples fused after vacuum drying
were essentially identical with the fused samples from the first experi-
ment.

It was concluded that the weight losses on prolonged drying were at
least in part due to the substitution of 0 (wt 16) for 2F (wt 38) as a
consequence of hydrolysis, and that a satisfactory reconditioning of fuel

by a simple drying operation is unlikely.

Graphite Compatibility Studies

 

Penetration of Graphite by Molten Fluorides

Continuing studies! of the permeation of graphite by fuel mixtures
at approximately 1 atm led to the following conclusions.

Early experiments, in which only slight permeation of graphites such
as AGOT occurred, reflected the effect of surface oxide in the graphite
as a source of plugging by the formation of insoluble UO,. Such results
could be altered to give easy permeation by using fuels with a larger oxide
solubility, or by previously removing the oxide by treatment with H,. When
easy permeation was achieved, the relative composition of the fuel in the
graphite was normal, in contrast to the earlier behavior which involved
complications due to oxide precipitation. Long-term tests gave the same
amount of permeation as short ones. There was good agreement between the
permeation obtained by experiment, in the absence of oxide interference,
and the permeation calculated on the basis of the physical interaction be-
tween a nonwetting liquid and a porous medium.

Tests at lower pressures have been discontinued in favor of more per=-
tinent studies at 60 psig, corresponding to reactor conditions. At these
higher pressures the permeation is increased in the expected manner, and
differences in behavior due to the presence of oxide are usually not ap-
parent. For example, when dealing with a readily permeable graphite, such
as AGOT, little effect is noted as a result of pretreatment with H,.

Attention has recently centered on the amount of permeation to be ex-

pected at 60 psig in various grades of. graphite; typical results are shown

“in Teble 2.2.3. In the usal procedure ‘the graphite specimens were baked
out under - 40-1 partial vacuum’ at: 1300°F for 2% hr and then left in contact

with the salt at 60 psig ‘and 1300°F.

A test of graphite. coated with ‘siliconized silicon carbide was acci-

dentally invalidated ‘when, as later realized, the coating was punctured
during mounting for submersion, in molten fuel. Consequently, ensuing large
weight ‘geins were not necessarily attributable to failure of the coating.
From’ a metallurgical ‘examination it appeared. that the ‘coating had been
severely attacked, but no definite conclusions could be ‘reached because

‘no specimens in the original ‘condition’ vere available for comparison.

Intercalation of Graphite with Molten Salts

The possibility of intercalation compounds of graphite and molten
fluorides is unlikely, in view of the wide experience in handling fuels
in graphite with no evidence of chemical reaction. However, because of
the prevalence of intercalation of chloride with graphite,l4 it was of in-
terest to explore the phenomenon.

Of the 20 principal fission elements, niobium, technetium, and pos-
sibly molybdenum fluorides seemed most likely to exhibit intercalation with
graphite. Most of the other fission-element cations form stable fluorides
which have been included in melts in graphite crucibles in the course of
other investigations in the Reactor Chemistry Division. Also, the more
noble metals would be expected to exist as the free element and therefore
would not intercalate. While molybdenum is also likely to be uncombined,
it could possibly form a low-valence fluoride. Fluorides of molybdenum

with a valence lower than six have been studied very little. Niobium forms

a stable pentafluoride which has not yet been evaluated in graphite. Very
little is known of the chemistry of technetium, but it seems to resemble
rhenium more closely than it does manganese.

When treated with molten molybdenum pentafluoride, graphite swelled
to form an intercalate. A graphite tube (3/8-in. OD, 1/4-in. ID) was
sealed in a copper capsule with MoFs; and maintained at 100 to 150°C for
17 hr. The unreacted MoFs was distilled off by heating to 200°C. As a
result of the treatment part of the graphite tube had crumbled, but the
outside diameter of the intact portion had increased to 1/2 in. Exposure
to water caused the tube to evolve heat and hydrogen fluoride in-a manner
similar to the behavior of pure MoF;.

Molybdenum hexafluoride also gave evidence of intercalation, and a
similar phenomenon has been noted repeatedly with UFg. Such strong oxi-
dizing agents as these could not survive in a reactor, but would be reduced

to a lower valence state by reaction with the containing walls.

Diffusion of Rare-Earth Fission Products in Graphite

 

The development of techniques for the study of diffusion of rare
earths in graphite is in progress. Specimens of graphite are to be im-
pregnated with breeder fuels containing a trace quantity of Eul52,154,
The activity distribution in the graphite will be determined before and
after exposure to clean fuel salt by microcore drilling of small graphite
samples from the face of a section of the graphite rod. Tube furnaces,
furnace controllers, and Inconel fuel containers for the leaching operation
have been procured. Equipment for microcore drilling has been designed
and fabricated and the. technique tested on graphite samples containing
cst3?. This technique will be adapted for use in the hot cell to analyze
graphite. samples from the MIR. graphite—fused-salt experiment. A simple

glove. box. for contamination control. is under construction, anda saw for

sectioning. the graphite rod is ‘on order. Specimens of graphite for the

first test were received, were ‘machined to the desired dimensions, and are

Teady for impregnation.

fiscal year, the production facility was activated for three weeks, and
600 kg of fluoride salt mixes was processed. Small-scale processing op-
erations accounted for another 140 kg, making a total of 740 kg.

The increased rate of transfer and service operations encountered
during the previous quarter continued during the first month of this quar-
ter; the rate then dropped. Considerable effort has been devoted to de-
veloping a technique for filling recently designed in-pile capsules!’ for
testing graphite. The results obtained to date are promising but not com-

pletely satisfactory.

Molten Ammonium Bifluoride as a Reagent
Reactions of molten ammonium bifluoride have been useful for prepar-
ing a large number of metal fluorides and ammonium fluometallates.'® Ad-
ditional reactions of ammonium bifluoride have been explored.
Ammonium dichromate dissolved in ammonium bifluoride at 125°C to form
an orange melt which vigorously bubbled and rapidly became green at about
200°C. Ammonium hexafluochromate(III) had formed by the following reac-

tion:

Chromic acid reacted similarly:

Radiation Effects

Corrosion Tests Under Radiation

 

Two static-corrosion capsules, made of INOR-8 alloy, were irradiated
in the Materials Testing Reactor. Fuel composition and test conditions
are summarized in Table 2.2.4.

Failure became evident from the release of radioactivity into the off-
gas from one of the capsules. The two capsules were installed as a unit;
so 1t was necessary to terminate the test for both capsules.

The Chromel-Alumel thermocouples attached to the capsules showed no
sign of failure, and the capsules are being removed from the reactor by
a process designed to preserve the thermocouples. The capsules will be
examined in the hot cells at ORNL.

Metallographic tests will be made on the metal, chemical analyses will

2.3 FUEL PROCESSING

Emphasis is being placed on modification of the hydrofluorination—
volatilization process for application to MSR salts containing THF, The
process as originally developed was satisfactory for the recovery of ura-
nium from core and blanket salts in a two-region reactor and for the re-
cycle of LiF and BeF, used in the core fuel.! There was no provision in
this process, however, for the handling of thorium, which is particularly
desirable in core salt, where frequent processing is necessary. The hy-
drofluorination—volatilization process has as an attractive feature the

fact that the processed material remains in the fluoride form and thus re-
quires little further treatment before re-use in the reactor. Retention
of this feature is one objective of the work.

The use of hot aqueous NH,F solution appears definitely promising for
processing ThF,-bearing fuels, and further work in this direction seems
appropriate. The possibility of using ClF;-HF as a solvent for the simul-
taneous solution of UF, and LiF no longer appears attractive because an
appreciable concentration of Cl1F; represses the LiF solubility and because
the solubilities of UF, and ThF, are unsatisfactory. The NO,-HF system
appears attractive for the simultaneous dissolution of LiF, BeF,, and UF,,
but it does not show sufficient ThF, solubility.

Thorium Fluoride Solubility in Aqueous NH,F Solutions

 

An exploratory test indicated that ThF, was soluble to about 5 wt %
in 50 wt % aqueous NH F solution at the boiling point, which is high enough
to be of interest for processing. Typical fuel salts contain about 60 wt %
ThF,. Experimental data indicated increasing ThF, solubility with increas-
ing temperature and increasing NH,F concentration, although some difficul-
ties were encountered in sampling solutions at or near the boiling point.
The ThF,; solubility in 50% solution at 105°C was 49 mg/ml. in a sample pi-
petted from a solution in which the solids had been allowed to settle, and
was 43 mg/ml in a sample filtered through sintered nickel. The solubility
dropped rapidly with decreasing temperature, to about 12 mg/ml at 60°C and
4.9 mg/ml at 25°C. In 43% NH,F solution at 25°C the solubility was only

0.4 mg/ml. The solid formed when these NH,F solutions of ThF, were cooled
or diluted was not ThF,, but rather a compound (or compounds) involving
NH,F and ThF,. The compositions of solids formed under various conditions
are being determined.

The investigation is being extended to measurements of the solubili-
ties of the other fuel components — LiF, BeF,, UF,, and rare earths — both
individually and collectively. The effect of other components on the ThF,

solubility has not been measured.

Fuel-Component Solubility in Cl1F,-HF

 

Mixed ClF;-HF solvent appears unsatisfactory for a one-step process
to dissolve both uranium and LiF. Further experiments confirmed the ob-
servations reported previously? that C1F3 in HF causes a drastic reduction
in the LiF and BeF, solubilities with MSR fuel salt (LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF,,
62-36.5-1-0.5 mole %). The presence of significant amounts of Cl¥F; in HF
decreased the solubility of LiF from ~100 to ~20 g/kg, and of BeF, from
30-40 to < 5 g/kg. Uranium solubilities were generally about 0.25 g/kg;
although significant, they are too low to dissolve all the uranium as-
sociated with the dissolved LiF and BeF,. Rare-earth and thorium fluorides
are very insoluble in these solutions; rare-earth solubilities were in the
range 0.0001 to 0.0005 mole %, based on dissolved salt.

The U(IV), which has a low solubility, is probably not converted under
these conditions to the highly soluble U(VI). Operation of the C1F;-HF
system at a higher temperature and pressure to obtain conversion appears

impractical. Hence no further work in this direction is planned.

that values would be higher at NO, concentrations above 10 mole %; uranium
solubilities are presumably high in the absence of LiF and BeF,. Thorium
solubilities were generally low, and rare-earth solubilities were mostly
about 0.001 to 0.002 mole %, based on dissolved salt (the most reliable
value, from an experiment discussed below, was 50-fold less than this).

With 2.7 mole % NO, (Table 2.3.1) the BeF, solubility was unexpectedly
high, corresponding almost exactly with the NO, content on a mole basis.

The LiF solubility was only about half as high as expected. The uranium

solubilities account for about one-third of the uranium associated with

the dissolved salt except with 10 mole % NO,, where it accounts for all =
of it. With 5 mole % NO, the total salt solubility is a little over 100
g/liter, which is a reasonable value for processing.

In another experiment with approximately 2 mole % NO, in HF, the so-
lution was decanted from the undissolved excess salt and both were analyzed
separately. The LiF, BeF,, uranium, and thorium solubilities were 33, 52,
0.5, and 0.04 g/kg, respectively, in reasonable agreement with the values
reported above. The NO,-HF solution dissolved 56% of the IiF, 7% of the
BeF,, 5% of the uranium, and 62% of the cesium activity, but only 0.086%
of the cerium and 0.059% of the promethium.’ The much larger samples per-
mitted more accurate determinations of the rare-earth activities than in
the experiments reported in Table 2.3.1. The total rare-earth solubilities
were 0.000042 mole % calculated from the cerium determination and 0.000029
mole % calculated from the promethium determinations, based on dissolved

LiF and BeF,. .

The above results were obtained at room temperature. As NO, was added
to HF, the boiling point rose rapidly to about 56°C at about 25 mole % NO,
and then dropped to the boiling point of NO, (21°C) with about 60 mole %
NO,, at which point a second phase appeared. The second phase appeared
to be nearly pure NO,. Salt solubilities would probably be significantly
higher at the boiling points, since salt solubilities in other HF systems

have been observed to increase with temperature.
