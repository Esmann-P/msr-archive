VOLATILITY PILOT PLANT MARK ITI FLUORINATOR

 

T. M. Kegley, Jr., and A. P. Litman
INTRODUCTION

For several years the Volatility Pilot Plant has demonstrated the
feasibility of processing zirconium-base fuels using fluoride volatility
techniques. In an INOR-& hydrofluorination vessel, rejected fully en-
riched zirconium-uranium alloy or dummy Zircaloy-2 fuel elements are
dissolved at 500-600°C in NaF-LiF-Zr¥, salts using an excess of anhy-
drous HF gas, Zirconium and uranium metal are converted to soluble
tetrafluorides which subsequently are transferred, along with the fluoride
bath, to a fluorination vessel. In the fluorinator, which is constructed
of L nickel and operated at 500°C, elemental fluorine converts UF, to UFg
product which is decontaminated and collected in cold traps. Figure 1
shows a simplified flowsheet of the volatility process,

Severe corrosion of the L nickel fluorinator occurs during processing.
Three fluorinators have been used to date in the pilot plant, and all three
have sustained a maximum corrosion attack of approximately 1 mil/hr, based
on the fluorine exposure times.1:? Efforts to reduce the corrosive attack
on fluorination vessels have included minimizing the operating temperature,
careful exclusion of sulfur-containing compounds, and the search for a
more resistant construction material. Accordingly, in the first two
pilot plant fluorinators, Mark TI and II, corrosion tests were performed

using many potential container materials, mostly nickel-base alloys.?

Those nickel binaries containing iron, cobalt, or manganese showed
improved corrosion resistance over I nickel and were thus selected for
additional testing in the current Mark III fluorinator.

To date, 24 specimens have been exposed in the Mark IIT fluorinator.
This report covers the 12 specimens comprising Groups I and IT. Groups IIL
and IV will be discussed in a separate report. In addition, specimens have
been placed in the fluorinator for exposure during current runs where

irradiated submarine fuel elements are being processed.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE
Specimen Description

Descriptions of the Group I and IT test specimens, their location,
and chemical compositions are shown in Tables 1 and 2. Control specimens
containing the materials used in the construction of the Tluorinator
were included in both groups. The control specimens consisted of Z2-in.
lengths of Z-in.-diam L nickel rod joined together with %-in. deposits
of INCO-61 weld metal. The control specimen from Group I and one of the
controls from Group II were fluorine conditioned for 3.2 hr at 600-645°C
before testing to ascertain the effect of conditioning on corrosion.

The high-purity, vacuum-melted nickel specimen was obtained by re-
melting NiVac P nickel. Subsequently, the high-purity nickel was cast
into a l-in.-diam bar, cold swaged and cold drawn down to an 0.250-in.
rod, and annealed at 1500°F.

The other binary alloys used in these tests were melted from virgin
stock and cast into l-in.-diam bars, cold swaged and cold drawn down to
0.250-1in. rods. Subsequently they were annealed at 1650°F and placed in

test,
Test Method

The specimen rods were located in nozzles attached to the lower
chamber of the Mark TIT fluorination vessel, as shown in Fig. 2. Each
rod was held in place by a fitting which gripped a tube prewelded to the
end of the rod (see Fig. 3). Figure 4 shows a polar view of the fluorina-

tion chamber and the plan layout of the corrosion nozzles.

Test Conditions

The Group I corrosion specimens were exposed during Volatility Pilot
Plant runs T-1 through T-7, while the Group IT specimens were exposed in
runs TU=-1 through TU-5. Test conditions Tor these runs are summarized in
Table 3. The T runs were made without uranium in the system, while the

TU runs were conducted with 0.3 wt % U in the starting fuel element.

RESULTS
Visual Examination

Visual examination of the Group I specimens disclosed fluoride salts
had preferentially adhered to the specimens in the vapor and salt-vapor
interface regions. Figure 5 shows the Group I specimens after cleaning
with an ammonium oxalate solution. Buriace roughening was apparent in all

the specimens, but no gross localized metal losses were evident.

Examination of the Group II specimens showed fluoride salts had
preferentially adhered to specimens in the lower vapor region. Some
loosely adherent deposits were also noted in the interface region.

Figure 6 shows the Group II specimens after an ammonium oxalate wash.
Dimensional Changes

Bulk metal losses from the specimens were determined from micrometer
measurements taken in the vapor, vapor-salt interface, and salt-exposure
regions. Table 4 details the results. The Group II specimens generally

showed losses several times greater than the Group I specimens.
Metallographic Examination

Transverse and longitudinal sections taken from the vapcr, interface,
and salt regions of the corrosion specimens were examined using optical
microscopy. Photomicrographs of most of these sections are included in
the Appendix. Metallographic examination revealed that corrosion had
resulted in the production of one or more of the following: (1) surface
films, (2) surface attack, (3) intergranular attack, and (4) grain-

boundary modifications.
Surface Films

Twe types of surface films were observed — a gray nonmetallic and a
bright semimetallic film. Usually the films were intermittent in coverage
rather than continuous. Figure 7 illustrates the types of films found.
Details regarding the surface films found on the specimens are summarized
in Tables 5 and 6. Except for the Group I specimens showing a propensity
Tor formation of bright filme in the salt-exposed region, no particular
pattern associating film formation with region of exposure of specimen
composition was obvious.

Samples of the two types of surface films were obtained from an L
nickel specimen using a microchisel® and submitted for x-ray diffraction

analyses. A quantitative analysis could not be obtained, but the results,

Surface Attack

Many of the corrosion specimens examined showed an attack of varying
character which generally could not be categorized under any heading
except surface attack. Occasionally this surface attack had the appearance
of pitting-type corrosion. Some typical examples of the types of surface
attack found are shown in Fig. 8. Additional photomicrographs showing

surface attack are presented in the Appendix.
Intergranular Attack

Intergranular attack was found in many samples from the corrosion
specimens. Figure 7 illustrates this mode of corrosion as found on
L nickel. The amount of intergranular attack observed on all specimens is
recorded in Tables 8 and 9. In all cases corrosion resembling inter-
granular attack was designated as such only if the attack was observed in

the "as-polished" metallographic condition.
Grain-Boundary Modifications

Tn some of the [luorinator specimens, grain-boundary modifications
occurred which differed from intergranular attack as previously defined.

This form of grain-boundary attack was not apparent in the "as-polished"

metallographic sections as was the case for intergranular attack, but was

visible when the sections were etched with 3 parts CH3COOH and 2 parts
HNO. The modifications were found to be more clearly defined if the
etched surface was then lightly repolished on a microcloth wheel using
0.1 ¢ alumina (see Fig. 9a). Another standard etchant for nickel,

92 HCl:5H,S0,:3HNC;, revealed only the normal structure usually observed
on nickel (Fig. 9b).

The depth of grain-boundary modifications present in the Volatility
Pilot Plant specimens was determined using the nitric-acetic acid etch-
and-repolish technique described above.

The maximum depth of these grain-boundary modifications for each
corrosion specimen 1s recorded in Tables 10 and 11. The maximum amount of
grain-boundary modifications was usually observed in the sections taken
from the salt regions. For high-purity nickel, the depth of the grain-
boundary modifications was found to increase in proportion to the distance

from the top of the specimen (see Fig. 10).
Bend Tests

In order to gain preliminary information on how deleterious the grain-
boundary modifications were on the properties of the fluorination specimens,
a few bend tests were performed on the high-purity nickel samples. This
material was selected because samples had shown grain-boundary modifica-
tions with and without accompanying intergranular attack. Details of the
test and the results are shown in Table 12. Fracturing occurred in
specimens showing the modifications whether or not intergranular attack
accompanied the modifications. However, the depth of the modifications

did not seem to affect the depth of the 18C-deg bend fractures.
Summary

The maximum total corrosion of the Volatility Pilot Plant specimens
was determined in two ways:

1. By summing the bulk metal losses, surface attack, and intergranu-
lar attack.

2. By summing the bulk metal losses and the grain-boundary modifica-

tions, Maximum values for each mode of attack were used in all cases.

Bulk losses based on specimen radii were used since aggressive attack on
a process fluorinator occurs essentially only on the inside diameter,
Total corrosion noted for the specimens is detailed in Tables & and 9.
Corrosion rates for the flucrination specimens are shown in Figs. 11 and
12. The rates were determined on the basis of molten-salt residence

time as well as fluorine exposure time,

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

The individual effects of fluorine, UFg, and fluoride salts on
container materials have been discussed previously.® The modes of attack
observed in this current series were similar to those previously described.

However, attempts were made to categorize better the corrosion modes.
Comparison Between Group I and Group II Specimens

The Group II corrosion specimens in general exhibited higher corrosion
rates than ¢id the Group I specimens, probably due to the presence of
uranium during the Group II runs. Previous work has shown the accelerating
effect uranium has on corrosion during fluorination.?

Bulk metal losses, based on specimen radii, were about the same, 0.7

to 1.6 mils, for all the Group I specimens while the metal losses for the

Fluorinator Test Specimens.

Group II specimens varied from O to 8.6 mils. Group IT interface sections
usually exhibited the greatest bulk losses, while sections taken in the
vapor region exhibited the least attack.

Intergramilar attack was most prominent in the L nickel and high-
purity nickel specimens of Group I. The maximum depth of penetration by
this mode of attack was 6.5 mils for the high-purity nickel specimen.

In Group II, intergranular attack was found mainly in the L nickel
and 95 Ni—~5 Co specimens. For the unconditioned IL nickel specimen, inter-
granular attack to a depth of 6 mils was noted.

Grain~boundary modifications were found in all specimens of Group I
except INCO-61 weld metal and 95 Ni~-5 Fe specimens. The L nickel and high-
purity nickel specimens showed the greatest amount of grain-boundary
modifications — 11.5 and 125 mils, respectively.

All the Group II specimens except the INCO~-61 weld metal and the
99 Ni~1 Al specimens exhibited grain-boundary modifications. The maximum
depth of attack by this mode of corrosion, 30 mils, wag found in the

95 Ni~5 Co specimen.
Comparison With Previous Studies

In general, the corrosion rates experienced by the Group I and
Group II specimens were about the same as those experienced by specimens

in earlier tests.’

Since many different alloys were tested in the
current and previous series, the best comparison can be made by examining
corrosion of the L nickel control specimens. Table 13 gives the maximum
corrosion rates experienced by all such nickel specimens.

As Table 13 indicates, during corrosion tests the L nickel specimens
were exposed in NaF-ZrF, salts (usually with UF, present), while the
Group I/Group IT tests were exposed to a LiF-NaF-ZrF, mixture. The
addition of LiF lowered the salt melting point so that the fluorination
could proceed at slightly lower temperatures. The lower operating temper-~
atures would normally decrease corrosion rates. However, as has been
shown previously, the addition of lithium fluoride increases the corrosion

rates on nickel’ and the total effect was one of averaging so that compos-

ite corrosion rates were about the same as in the early tests.

Effect of Fluorine Conditioning on L Nickel and INCO-61 Weld Metal

In Group II, one of the L nickel-INCO 61 specimens was fluorine
conditioned 3.2 hr at 600—645°C before corrosion testing. The conditioned
L nickel appeared to have sustained somewhat less attack than unconditioned
L nickel. On the other hand, conditioned INCO-61 weld metal exposed in
the vapor and salt regions exhibited greater attack than did unconditioned
INCO 61.

These observations are compatible with the theory that corrosion
resistance to fluorine is imparted by the formation of a stable fluoride
film. The increased corrosion resistance of the conditioned L nickel
presumably is due to the formation of a stable nickel fluoride ©ilm. The
titanium present in INCO 61 possibly modifies and makes the NiF, [ilm

less stable since titanium fluorides are highly volatile.

CONCLUSIONS

Several conclusions can be drawn based on the reported fluorination-
corrosion tests. These conclusions are in agreement with the previous
test series.

1. The combination of operating temperatures around 550°C with
lithium fluoride present in the salt baths produces about the same bulk
metal losses on nickel and nickel-base alloys as was found by operating
at 650°C without lithium in the salt baths.

2. The presence of uranium accelerates corrosion of nickel and
nickel-base alloys during the Volatility Process fluorination cycle.

3. Prior fluorine conditioning of L nickel decreases corrosion of
the material during subsequent fluorination.

4, Prior fluorine conditioning of INCO-61 weld metal increases the
attack on INCO 61 during subsequent fluorination.

5. Bulk metal losses on L nickel and the nickel-binary alloys
containing manganese, iron, cobalt, or aluminum are about the same during

fluorination at 550°C with lithium present in the fluoride salt baths.
- 32 =

6. The presence of the alloying elements, manganese, iron, or
aluminum, in nickel drastically reduces or eliminates intergranular attack
usually found in unalloyed nickel exposed to a fluorination environment.

7. In fluorination environments, the effect of adding cobalt to
nickel on subsequent corrosion by intergranular attack of the binary is
unclear. These reported tests showed that serious intergranular attack
of a 95 Ni—5 Co specimen occurred. On the other hand, this test series
and previous series showed good resistance to this form of corrosion by
nickel containing 10 and 20 wt % Co.

8. Unalloyed nickel of greater than commercial purity shows less
resistance to bulk metal losses, intergranular attack, and grain-boundary
modifications when exposed to [luorination environments than L nickel

and all nickel alloys tested,
