Introduction

To reduce down-time during malotensnce operations on the molten salt
power reactor system to a minimum, the philosophy has beer adopted that
all system components on which diract maintenance is nob possible shall
be removable and replaceable with gparss, by remote manipulation. Re-
pair work on failed componants shall be accomplished lo suitably equipped
independent facilities.

It is preraguisite to the removal and replacement of system com-
ponechs by remote manipulation that a reliable method be developed for
parting system piping and rejoining it to its original integrity. Until
present experimental efforts to perform critical welding remotely have

ucczaded to the point wheres they can be applied with confidence to the

 

¢

maintenance of a reactor system, the use of mschanical joints for this
purpose must be considersd, The objective of the work reported here was
to scresn the various concepts of mechanical joints offered by individuals

or groups within the Reactor Projects Division, and to selesct for develop-

ment those showing promise of successful application,

 

Three swall scale mechanical pipe Joints of alternative types wers
tasted in a fused salt pump loop, The Joints were cold leak checksd on
a mage spacbrometsr lak detsctor before installation in the loop, ware
then ingtallsd and subjected to a series of thermal cycles between 1100
and 1300°F, removed from the loop and leak chacked., The Joints wers
then parted, remade, and leak checked again, An indleated leak rate of
less than 1 x 1077 ce of helium per second was regqulred for acceptable

rerformance at sach check.
3.0

Of the three joints tested, the "freeze flange" Joint was found sat-
isfactory for immediate development, the "indented seal" Joint was found
promising if modified, and the "cast seal” joint was found not suitable
for developmsnt,

In accordance with these results, further tests of the small-scale
"freeze flange" and "indented seal" joints have been initiated with sodium
as the process fluld, and a pair of "freeze flange" Joints in 4" pipe size
has besn fabricated for testing in a large fused salt system. Results of

these tests will be reported separately.

Degeription of Test Joints
3.1 Criteria for Joint Performence
For the screening tests; the following criteria were used, based upon
the Preliminary Mechanical Joint Specification (see Appendix 1) prepared by
the MSEP Group:
(a) The joints shall be fabricated of materials compatible
with fused fluoride salt fuels.
(b) The joint leak rate, cold, before installation in the test
loop, shall be less than 1 x 1077 cc of helium per second, as in-
dicated by comparison with a standard leak used in conjunction with
a mass spectrometer leak detector.
(¢) The joint shall be installed in a test loop circulating fused
salt and subjected to a minimum of 50 thermal cycles between the
temperatures of 1150 and 1300°F,
(4) No fluid leakage shall be acceptable,
(2) Upon completion of the thermal cycling tests, the Joint shall

be cut from the loop and cold leak checked (see 3.1l.b).
{(f}) It shall be demonstrated that each joint can be parted and
remade acceptably leak tight, without requiring more than super-
ficial cleaning, etc., such ag could be performed by remote

manipulation.

3,2 Freasza Flange Joint
The principle of the frozen ssal mechanical joint, or freeze flangs,
iz illustrated in Fig, 1, The frozen salt seal is formed in the gap
between the flange faces. The ring insert provides a lebyrinth re-
striction to the passage of salt into the gap. The labyrinth is ine
portant only when the test loop was filled with salt, before the frozen
seal was formed. After the frozen seal is formed, it retains the molten
salt in the process stream. The metal seal ring provides a gas-tight
seal, waich retains fission gases. For an effective gas seal, it was
found pnecassgary to manufacture the seal ring to close tolerances. The
0, D. and IT. D. of the ring were within 0.004 inches on a diameter of
seven inches, and concentric within 0,001 inches. The finish required
was sixteen microinches. The sams bolerances were required in making
the geal ring groove in the flanges faces,

An air channel, in each half of the flange assembly, provides cool-
ing for the seal ring and insures the formation of the frozen salt sesl.

The flange has a thin cross section between the flanges hub, which
is welded to the loop tubing, and the seal ring, near the outer edge of
the flangs, This was designed to pressabt a small cross sectional ares
for radial heat conduction. Four webs add strength to the flange and rae
duce warping.
On the test installation, sight guick-opening toggle clamps were

usad on each flanges assembly, as shown in Fig. 2, to provide the necessary

(1) Air cooling lines, (2) Calrod heaters leads, (3) Quick-open toggle
clamps, (4) Thermocouple leads, (5) Clam shell heaters, (6) Insulation.

There were no heaters nor was there any insulation on the flange
assemblies.

The flanges were made of Inconel. The seal rings for the first
test were of stainless steel. In subsequent tests, soft iron and an-

nealed copper seal rings were used.

3.3 Indented Seal Joint

This mechanical joint is illustrated in Fig. 3.. A dead-soft an-
nealed metal gasket is used to seal the two flange halves. A raised
tooth of V-shaped cross section, machined on the face of each flange,
indents the flat metal gasket to provide a tight gas seal. Actual
parts are shown in Figs. 4 and 5.

A thin cross section between the flange hub and gasket, near the
outer edge of the flange, presents a small cross sectional area for radial
heat conduction.

On the test installation, four standard design "C" clamps were used
on each flange assembly to provide the force necessary to indent the
gasket and maintain a gas leakage rate below the maximum allowed. Fig. 6
shows an assembly with clamps.

The flanges were made of Inconel. For the first test, a dead-soft

annealed copper gasket was used in one flange assembly, and an annealed

nealed Nickel "A" gasket was used in one assembly and a nickel-plated

Armco iron gasket in the other assembly.

3.4 Cast Seal Joint

A cross section of this mechanical Joint is shown in Fig. 7. Four
stainless steel bolts provide the mechanical strength for the joint. A
metal insert, shown in the figure before being fused; is used to provide
a salt and gas seal. The metal insert is fused between the flange faces
before the test loop is filled with salt. The seal whose melting point
is above that of the fuel salt, is in the solid state during operation
of the test loop.

The sealing surfaces on the flange faces are flash copper plated,
and then nickel plated, to promote good wetting by the sealing alloy.t

Because of its geometry, this Joint must be installed in a vertical
run of pipe.

The test flanges were made of Inconel, A cast silver seal was used
in one flange assembly, while an alloy of 72% silver and 28% copper was
used in the other flange assembly.

An assembly of the flange is shown in Fig. 8.

The molten salt mixture was circulated by means of an LFB-type
centrifugal pump. During tests 1 and 2, on the freeze flanges, two
straight sections of the loop, each about nine feet long, were used
as resistance heaters. A heavy current was passed through the tubing
sections. Other sections of the loop were heated with calrod or clam
shell heaters. The entire loop was preheated, prior to filling with
salt.

Tests 3 and 4 on the freeze flanges were conducted in a new
location where resistance heating was not available, and the entire
loop and pump were heated by means of calrod and clam shell heaters.

A sump tank, connected to the point of lowest elevation in the
loop, was used to fill and drain the loop of molten salt, The LFB
pump, installed at the highest point in the loop also served as a surge
tank, The pump was supplied with an oil lubricating system. A helium
supply was connected to the loop for initial purging of air before
heating. It was also used to pressurize the sump for filling the loop
with molten salt. The various components.at the pump end of the loop
are shown in Fig. 10 and are identified as follows: (1) LFB pump,

(2) Pump motor and clutch, (3) Salt sump, (4) Water cooled oil storage
tank, (5) Lubricating oil pumps, (6) Helium supply regulators, (7) Helium
bubbler, (8) Helium pressure gauges, (9) Lubricating oil flowmeter.

Salt flow in the loop was controlled by a variable speed magnetic-
type clutch and induction motor. V-belts connected the motor and clutch

to the LFB pump.

All components of the loop in contact with the molten salt were
fabricated of Inconel,

The loop design was similar to a "standard" design established
in the Experimental Engineering Department for their corrosion testing
program. The entire loop, including the pump, was mounted on a test
stand, also of "standard" design, made of Unistrut. The stand was
mounted on wheels for easy transport between various construction
stations, such as the weld shop and X-ray room.

All welds in contact with the molten salt were given a dye check
‘and X-ray examination according to departmental specifications for
critical welds. The Inconel tubing used in the loop had received a
thorough dye check inspection prior to construction of the loop.

Twenty thermocouples were spot welded to the loop tubing and pump,
per Dwg. No. SK-CKM-1623, Additional thermocouples were attached to
the flanges.

Precautions were taken during construction to use clean tubing
and parts, and especlally to avoid contamination of the inside of the

tubing and pump.

4,0 Test Procedure
4.1 Fresze Flange Joint

Two sets of flanges ware assembled with seal rings prior to in.
stallation in the loop. Each flange assembly was then laak tested using
a belium leak dstector. To leak test, the tubing from one snd of a Ylangs
agsembly was plugged and the other end connected to a vacuum pump. A plastic
bag was then placed around the flange assembly and kept filled with helium
during the leak test, Hellum leak rate tests were mads on both flange as-
semblies prior to installation in the loop for Tests 3 and 4%, Tois work
was dove by the Instrument Department and is described in detail in their

* peport No. 58-1-20. Both flanges assemblies were then welded into one end
of the loop as shown in Figs. 2 avd 9.

Helium wes clrculated through the loop before preheating, to re-
move sir. A helium pressure was maintained on the loop and pump during
heating and filling.

Clean fluoride salt mixture was then travsferred to the sump tank.
When the temperature of all parts of the loop reached 1300°F, helium
pressure was applied to the sump tank to force the salt into the loop.

The pump was operated at a low speed during the filling opzratlion., The
loop was vented through the pump belium inlet, as the salt displaced the
helium. Salt circulation was chtalned a few minutes laser, when the pump

speed was increased to 2500 rpm to produce about 2 gpm flow, A helium
w 2)

blanket was maintained at 2 to 3 psig on the salt surface in the pump during
testing operations.

The heaters were then adjusted to obtain 1300°F on all parts of thes
loop. During the loop filling operation, cooling alr was circulated in
the alr channels bullt lnto the freeze flanges. A small air flow of ap-
proximately 15 o¢fh was necessary to keep the seal ring area cool.

The leap was filled rapidly to insure establishment of frozen seals
batween the flange faces before the molten salt could raise the temperature
of the flanges,

After a period of isothermal operation to make certain there was no
salt leak, the thermal cycle testing was begun. Temperatures of the salt
were measured by means of thermocouples located on the loop tubing at the
inlet to seach flange assembly. Temperature measurements were taken at
various points on each flange assembly.

The salt flow was maintained at a steady rate of 2 gpm. The pump
speed was checked periodically with a Strobotac and the flow in gpm obtained
from a pump calibration chart.

A schematic diagram of the Inconel loop during Tests 1 and 2 is shown
in Fig. 11. During these tests, temperatures were msgasured at the points
indicated in Fig. 12. Fluoride salt, Fuel No. 107, was circulated in the
loop during the first test. The salt temperature was cycled 50 times
between 1150°F and 1300°F, and then the loop was operated isothermally for
several days at 1300°F. The average cycle time was 44 minutes. A cycle is
defined as a bemperature variation from 1300 to 1150°F and back to 1300°F.

During the second test, in which fluoride salt, Fuel No. 30, was used,

the temperature variation of the salt was from 1300 to 1500°F and back to

1300°F, The number of cycles was reduced to 30 and the average cycle time
wags 29 minutes,

After Tests 1 and 2, the flange assemblies were disassembled and
reagsenbled to demenstrate ease and speed of handling, A motion pictures
film was taken of these cperations. The time required for these operations
is listed in Table 1,

Both of the {lange assemblies were removed from the loop before
starting on the next test, Additional machining work was performed on
the Tlange faces to produce a better finish on the seal ring grooves.

A schematic diagram of the Inconel loop for Tests 3 and 4 is shown
in Fig. 13. Fluoride salt, Fuel No. 30, was used in these tests. The
temperaturas were measured at the points indicated in Fig. 14. The salt
flow rate was, again, 2 gpm.

During Test No. 3 the salt temperature was cycled 50 times between
1100°F and 1300°F. The average cycle time was 60 minutes. During Test
No. 4 the temperature varietion of the salt was from 1100 to 1300°F and
back to 1100°F; the number of cycles was 25, and the average cycle time
was 62 minutes.

After the thermal cycling tests, both flange assemblies wers removed
from the loop for leak testing. Both assemblies were disassembled and
one flange assembly was reassembled using a new coppesr seal ring. This

assembly was again leak tested.

Two sets of flanges were assembled with metal inserts prior to in-
stallation in the loop. One flange assembly contained a pure silver in-

flange assemblies were then welded into one end of the loop in the location
shown in Fig, 13%.

A special furnace was placed around each cast seal flange for melt-
ing the metal inserts and to provide heat during loop operation. The loop
and flanges werz filled with helium prior to heating. The assembly with
the silver insert was raised to 183%0 - 1975°F and held at this temperature
for cane hour to insure complete fusion of the silver. The melting point
of silver is 1760°F. The other assembly was treated in the same fashion,
except that the temperature was raised to 1570° - 1670°F. The melting point
of the copper-silver alloy is 1435°F.

The loop and flanges were then filled with helium at a pressure of ap-
proximately 25 psig to check for leakage through the cast metal seals. The
pressure did not drop after several hours, and the flanges gave no indication
of any leakags when checked with a scap solution coated over the flange joint
and around the bolts,

The loop was then placed in operation for thermal cycle testing as de-
scribed in Section h.l.

During these tests, temperatures were measured at the points indicated
in Fig. 7. Fluoride salt, Fuel No. 30, was circulated in the loop during
both tests on the cast seal flange. During Test No. 1, the salt temperature
was cycled 50 times between 1300 and 1100°F. The averags cycle time was
60 minutes, During Test No. 2, the salt temperature variation was from
1100°F to 1300°F and back to 1100°F. The number of cycles was 25 and the
averages cycle time was 62 minutes. Tests 1 and 2 on the cast seal flanges
were ran simultaneously with Tests 3 and 4 on the freeze flanges.

After the cycling tests, both flange assemblies were saparated using

the special furnaces to melt the cast seals during the parting operation,
- 29 -

Stainless steel rods were tack welded to the flanges to pull them apart,
while the seals were in the molten state, A diagram of this apparatus
is shown in Fig. 15.

The top halves of each of the two flange assemblies were thoroughly
cleaned by placing them in a hydrogen furnace at 1900°F for about two
hours. The bottom halves of both assemblies were given a superficial
cleaning using a brush and a vacuum cleaner. The bottom halves of the
flanges represent those parts of the mechanical joints which eould not be
removed from a reactor system for cleaning and would have to be cleaned re-
motely.

Both flange assemblies were then reassembled using spring-loaded tie
rods to apply the necessary force to push the flange halves together. A
diagram of this apparatus is shown in Fig. 16. The special furnaces were
used around each assembly to melt the cast seals during the reassembly
operation,

Both flange assemblies were removed from the loop and sectioned for
metallurgical examination. This work was done by the Metallurgy Division.

(S22 Appendix 5 for their report.)

4.3 Indented Seal Joint

Two sets of flanges were assembled with metal gaskets prior to in-
stallation in the loop. Four "C" clamps were used on each flange assembly.
The clamps were each tightened with a torque of 80 - 90 foot pounds. The
load on each gasket was approximately 12,000 pounds per inch of gasket
clrcumfersence, Fach flange assembly was leak tested using a helium lesk
detector, Both assemblies were then welded into one end of the loop as

ahown in Figs. 9 and 17.

The loop was then placed in operation for thermal cycle testing as de-
scribed in Section 4.1. During Test No. 1 temperatures were measured at
the points indicated in Pig. 3. Fluoride salt, Fuel No. 30, was circulated
in the loop at a flow rate of 2 gpm. The salt temperature was cycled 50
times between 1100°F and 1300°F, The average cycle time was 60 minutes.

Both flange assemblies were removed from the loop after Test No, 1 for
leak testing. Subsequently, the assemblies were separated and reassembled
with pew gaskets, The flanges were then re-installed in the loop for Test
No, 2,

During this test, temperatures were measured at the points indicated in
Fig. 18. The salt temperature was cycled between 1100 and 1300°F, The number
of cycles was SO and the average cycle time was 61 minutes.

Again, the flanges were removed from the loop for leak testing and dis
assembly. One of the flange assemblies was reassembled with a new gasket and

then leak tested.

Discussion of Results
5.1 Freeze Flange Joint

The maximmm and minimum temperatures of various locations on the flanges
during thermal cycling are listed for Tests 1 and 2 in Table 2; for Tests 3
and 4 in Table 3.

Examination of Tables 2 and 3 will show that the greatest temperature
variation, at any one point in the flanges, occurs at the flange hub near the
loop tubing. For example, thermocouple No. 21, Table No, 2, Test No. 1,
varied from 862 to 1018°F. Thus, the greatest temperature variation, at
this point during cycling, was 156°F. The smallest variation occurs at
the periphery of the flanges as indicated, in one case, by thermocouples

No. 24 in Table No. 2. The minimm and maximum temperatures indicated

by this thermocouple were 245 and 280°F, respectively. Thus, the greatest
temperature varlation; at this point during thermal cycling, was 35°F,

The lov maximum temperature, and the slight variations in tempera-
ture encountered in the region of the fastenings and seal ring during
thermal cycling, are desirable features of the freeze flange joint.

The maximum radial temperature difference between the outside and
inside diameters of the flange, during the same test, was T38°F. This
figure is {he difference between thermocouples No, 21 and No. 24, taken
at their maximum values. The corresponding salt temperature was 1300°F.
The maximum such temperature difference obtained for any of the tests was
817°F.

The above examples are typical of the freeze flange operation. Com-
plete data for all tests is presented in graphical form. The points of
large and small temperature variation can be seen to follow the above
description. Graphs showing temperatures of the flanges throughout the
periods of thermal cycling are included in Appendix 2.

Gas leakage rates for Tests No. 1 and 2 were not satisfactory. This
was attributed to defects introduced during the initial fabrication of the
flanges, Some welding was performed on the flanges after all of the
machining had beer completed, which caused a slight warping. In addition,
the finish on the sesl ring grooves was not fine enough, These defects
were remedled by additional machining. Subsequent leakage rates were sate
isfactory.

Gas leakage rates of the Joints used in Tests 3 and 4 are listed in
Table 4, One leak rate was obtained on each flange before Test 3 and after

Test 4, As can be seen from the data, there was an appreciable increase in

the leak rate after testing. A third leak rate was obtained on one of the
flange assemblies following the cycling tests, after disassembly and re-
assembly with a new copper seal ring. This leak rate was 2.0 x 1078
cc/second and successfully met the specification listed in Section 3.1,
paragraph (f).

The flange assemblies were heated or cooled between room temperature
and the operating temperature of 1300°F at least eight times in the prepa-
ration for thermal cycling tests. The rate of cooling and heating was at
least 250°F per hour.

Both flanges operated successfully in that there was no indication
of salt leakage, the gas leakage rates were satisfactory, and there was
no indication of any cracks due to thermal stresses. (See Section 3.1),

A memorandum concerning the metallurgical examination for stress cracks
is included in Appendix 6.

Oxidation of the copper seal rings was negligible. The rings had the
same bright appearance after testing as they did originally. The Inconel
flanges showed no noticeable salt corrosion. The flanges and seal rings
are shown after the completion of Test No. Lt in Figs. 19 and 20.

The formation of the salt seal is showm in Fig. 21 after thermal
cycling tests and disassembly. Parts are identified as follows: (1) Frozen
salt seal, (2) Labyrinth insert ring, (3) Groove for seal ring. Both flanges
are shown after disassembly in Fig. 22 and various parts identified as
follows: (1) Cooling air lines, (2) Resistance heater lugs, (3) Calrod
heater leads, (4) Thermocouple leads, (5) Clam shell hemters, (6) Copper
seal rings in place.

The same flange is shown after removal of the salt seal in Fig. 23.

The time for cleaning both flanges was not more than 5 minutes.

The time necessary for the handling operations of disassembly and
reassembly is indicated in Table 1. Fase and speed of handling were de-
monstrated, indicating that the freeze flange Joint is potentially suited
to remote manipulation. Other tests are in progress to demonstrate remote

handling of this type of Joint.

5.2 Cast Seal Joint

The maximum and minimm temperature of various locations on the
flanges during thermal cycling are listed, for Tests 1 and 2, in Table 5.

Examination of Table 5 shows that the temperature variation, during
thermal cycling, is nearly the same for a thermocouple located in a well
near the cast seal as it is for a thermocouple located at the flange peri-
phery near the flange bolts. For example, thermocouple No. 25, near a
bolt, varied from 1177°F to 1287°F during Test No. 1. This is a variation
during thermal cycling of 110°F., During the same test thermocouple No. 23,
in a well near the cast seal, varied from 1157°F to 1296°F, a variation of
139°F.

The temperature variation, during thermal cycling, in the region of
the bolts is about three tires hat obtained in the case of the freeze
flanges (See Section 5.1). In addition, the bolts were about 1000°F higher
in temperature than the clamps on the freeze flanges.

The radial temperature difference, however, between the outside and
inside diameter of the flanges is small compared to the freeze flanges,
causing less thermal stress.

The above examples are typical of the cast seal flange operation, Com-
plete data for all tests are included in graphical form. Graphs showing
temperature of the flanges throughout the periods of thermal cycling are

included in Appendix 3. There was no indication of any salt leakage during

(3) The salt and flange temperatures before the lst cycle and was from 10° to 45°
cycling were 1300°F lower than the minimum temperatures
listed in table above,
* (See Fig. 7 for thermocouple location) The salt and flange temperatures before

(See Fig. 13 for diagram of Inconel loop) cycling were 1100°F,
any of the testing. There was ne indication of gas leakage with the loop
and flanges under 25 psig of helium, following the initial fusion of the

ring inserts. The pressure indication on the loop did nol decrease over

a pericd of several hours. There was no indication of gas leakage using

a soap solution on the flanges.

The steps and time periods involved in disassembly of these flanges
are listed in Table 6. Difficulty was encountered in step (5), the re-
moval of four stainless steel bolts and nubs from each flange. Each nut
had to be heated to a rsd heat, and a wrench used with considerable force.
In step (9), separation of the flanges while hot; it was found that the
flanges could not be pulled apart with a 25 to 50 pound force on the ex-
tension rods connected to the upper flange half. It was necessary to open
the heater box around each flange and use a cold chisel to separate the
flange halves, Since all of the disassembly operations would be ac~
complished remotely in a reactor system, it is clear that the cast seal
Joints, as tested, were not satisfactory in this respect, A comparison
may be made in the time necessary for dlsassembly of the Freeze Flange
Joint and Cast Seal Joint by referring to the data iu Tables 1 and 6,

The steps involved in resssembly of both flanges are shown in Teble 6,
Steps 1, 2, 3 and 6 would be accomplished remotely in an actual reactor
installation, After reassembly, it was found that both assewblies leaked
helium badly at the interfaces of the flange halves. Leaks were detected
with a soap solution while the flanges were under 15 psig of helium pres-
sure.

Photographs taken after disassembly of the flanges show that the
flanges and sealing alloys were badly oxidized. Fig. 24 shows the flange

with the copper-silver alloy seal; Fig. 25 the flange with the silver seal,

For example, thermocouple No, 30, near the gasket, varied from 960°F
to 1065°F, a variation during cycling of 105°F. Thermocouple No. 27 varied
from 1090°F to 1310°F, a variation during cycling of 220°F.

Tue temperature variation, during thermal cycling in the region of the
clamps is about three times that obltainved in the case of the freeze flange
(Sze Szction 5,1). This factor, Logether with the high temperature in the
reglon of the fastenings, means that the clamps oo the Indented Seal Flange
would have a greater tendency to looses than those on the freeze flange.

Ths radial temperature difference, however, betwsen the outside and
inside diameter of the flanges is about 1/% that of the fresze flanges
causing less thermal stress.

The above sxamples ars typical of the indented seal flange operation,
Complete data for all tests ars presented in graphical form. Graphs show-
ing temperatures of the flanges throughout the periods of thermal cycling
are included in Appendix k.

before and after each thermal cycling test. A new gaskeb was then installed
in each flange assembly, followed by another leak test, None of the four
gaskets, each of a different material, leaked salt. The flangs with the
copper gasket leaked helium following the thermal cycling in Test No, lj
however, the leak sealed itself before the flangs assembly was removed

from the loop for checking with a helium leak detector. The copper gasket
was badly oxidized as well, as shown in Fig. 26.

The flange with the annealed Armco iron gasket passed gas leakage
tests satisfactorily. This flange and gasket is shown after test in Fig.
27. The iron gasket, after removal from the flanges, is shown in Fig. 28.
The outer edge of the gasket was oxidized and therefore considered un-
suitable,

As can be seen from photographs Nos. 26 and 27, a ring of frozen salt
had formed between the flange faces. This frozen seal extended from ths
loop tubing diameter of 0.410 inches to an outside diam=tar of approxi-
mately 1-1/4 inches. For subsequent tests a heater was placed arcund the
outside of each flange assembly to insure thal the salt belwsen the flange
faces would be in the molten state during testing.

The flange with the annealed nickel "A" gasket leaked gas after thermal
cycling testing; however, this was caused by loosening of ore of the "O°
clamps, which held the flange halves together, This flange and gasket is
shown after testing in Fig. 29.

The flange with the nickel plated Armco iron gasket passed gas leakage
tests satisfactorily. It is shown after testing in Fig. 30. No oxidization
of the gaskel was apparent.

With the exception of the annealed Armco iron gasket, removal of the

gaskets from the flanges was difficult. It was necessary to cut the gaskets

free of the flanges in a lathe.

Of the four gaskets tested, the nickel plated and annealed Armco
iron gasket proved most satisfactory. The Inconel flanges showed no sign
of damage from corrosion or mechanical defects. A more suitable method

of clamping is in order, to insure a tight seal during the various tempera-

ture chenges.

Future Tests

The same freeze flange Joint and indented seal joint, described in
Section 3 of this report, are now under test with molten sodium in an
Inconel loop. An annealed copper seal ring is being used in the freeze
flange. A nickel plated, annealed Armco iron gasket is being used in in-
dented seal flange. The tests are similar to those described above. Both
flange assemblies are shown installed at one end of the Inconel loop in
Fig. 31.

A larger size freeze flange joint has been fabricated. It is shown
assembled in Fig. 32. The flange is shown open with the copper seal ring
in place in Fig. 33. The principle of operation is identical to the small
size flange tested and described above. Provision has been made on the
ring seal for monitoring the gas leak rate during operation, Two such
flanges have been fabricated for testing with molten salt in a loop,
shown schematically in Fig. 34. The welding necks on the flanges will
match a b-inch, schedule 40 pipe. An unusual feature of the large flange
is the use of a special clamp, made in two sections, which holds the flanges
around their entire circumference. The clamp is shown in the assembly photo-
graph, Fig. 32, Holes were placed in the webs to reduce heat conduction
from the salt to the seal ring area. A metal screen will be inserted in

the space between the flange faces to reduce the hold-up volume of salt,

specification with a piping centerline mismatch of + 1/32" and/or angularity
misalignment between piping runs of #* 1/2°, These specifications are to

be met without stressing the joining piping runs beyond thelr design

limit,

Flow Resistance

The run of piping containing the unlt shall not have any appreciable in-
crease im flow resistance as compared to a similar section of regular pipe.
Strength

The unit shall behave the same as the parent piping under time, tempera-
ture, and stress and shall not require preferential application,

Remote Servicing

All special tools, fixtures, and leak checking equipment shall be con-
sidered as part of the unit package, and practical remote demonstration of
such apparatus will be required.

General

SOLIDIFIED METAL SFAL DEVELOPMENT

G. M. Slaughter

In order to provide information to the designers of the solidified metal
geal, several 0.252-in.-dia tensile bars wars prepared from cast silver,
These were tested at room temperature, 1200°F, and 1400°F. The test re-
sults indicate that the room-temperature mechanical properties are about
the sams as the published data; i.e., 20,000 psi tensile, 8,000 psi yield,
and 50% elongation in l-in, At 1200°F, the tensile strength dropped to
2,400 psi and the yield strength to 1,900 psi, with a corresponding
elongation of 6 - 10%. At 1L00°F, the tensile strength was 1,500 psi,
the yield strength was 1,00 psi, and the elongation was 10%.

The two flanges that were operated in test at ¥-12 were received for
metallographic examination, A half-section of the silver flange is shown
in Fig. 35 (¥-26029), while a half-section of the silver-copper flange is
shown in Fig. 36 (¥-26103). The examination indicated that moderate oxi
dation of the components during opening and closing the flange had ocourred,
thereby impeding wetting of the base metal, The flange utilizing the silver-
copper alloy appeared to be less subject to this condition than that con-
taining the pure silver, probably because of the lower temperatures re-
quired to remelt it during opening. A photomicrograph of a typical inter
face between the silver-copper and the Inconel base metal is shown in Fig.

57 (¥-26241).

This freeze flange had operated through several thermal cycles in test.

Information regarding possible cracking was desired.

Three sections were taken through the center hole to explore all the areas
likely to exhibit cracks. One section included a welded-on web and a
longitudinal section through the center hole. Another section was taken
roughly 45° away longitudinally through the hole and a third in transverse
cross section through the counter-sunk center of the flange. It was in this

area that cracking was felt to most likely occur.

None of the sections examined showed any cracks.
