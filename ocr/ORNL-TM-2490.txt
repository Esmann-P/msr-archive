‘COMPATIBILITY . OF HASTELLOY N AND CROLOY 9M WITH
NaBF;-NaF-KBF, (90-4-6 mole %) FLUOROBORATE SALT

J. W. Koger and A. P. Litman

ABSTRACT

~The compatibility of a relatively impure (> 3000 ppm
impurities) fluoroborate salt, NaBF,-NaF-KBF, (90-4-6 mole %),
with Hastelloy N and Croloy 9M was evaluated in natural cir-

culation loops operating at a maximum temperature of 605°C

with a temperature difference of 145°C. The Croloy 9M loop

- (NCL-12) was completely plugged after 1440 hr of operation
and the Hastelloy N lo (NCL-10) was three-quarters plugged
after 8760 hr (one year) of operation. All major alloying
‘elements of the container materials mass transferred during
operation as the result of nonselective attack by virtue of =
the initial oxygen and water contamination of the salt. Satu-
ration .concentrations of 700 ppm Fe and 470 ppm Cr were deter-'
mined for the fluoroborate salt at 460°C. The mechanism of
corrosion of the system is as follows. Initially, metal fluo-
ride compounds that are soluble in the salt are formed in the
hot leg. The reverse reaction occurs in the cold leg and
causes the metal to deposit and to diffuse into the cold leg.
This contimes until (1) an equilibrium concentration of one

or more metal fluorides is reached in the salt at the cold-

leg temperature and these compounds start depositing (e.g. ’
NCL-10) or, (2) the equilibrium constant of the reaction
changes so much with temperature that the pure metal is

deposited (e.g., NCL-12).

 

INTRODUCTION

Nuclear reactors that use molten fluorides as fuels are under
development for the dual purpose of power production and thorium con-
‘version.l Heat generated in the core region of such a molten-galt
“breeder reactor is transferred from the fuel -conteining fluoride
salt to.a secondary coolant circuit of fluoride salt without fuel, that

1MSR Program Semiann. Progr. Rept. Feb. 29, 1968, ORNL-4254.
 

 

then dissipates the heat to steam. 2 In the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment
(MSRE), the nickel-base alloy Hastelloy N has proved to be an effective
container material for the fluoride salt that contains the fuel and for
the LiF-BeF: ‘diluent.

Many potential fissile? (containing UF), fertile? (containing ThF,),
or combination? (containing both UF; and ThF,) salts proposed for the
MSBR have been or are being tested for their compatibility with
Hastelloy N and other container materials. The choice of a salt for
the secondary coolant, however, remains open. Test programs have only
considered coolant salts like NaF-ZrF, and, recently, LiF-BeF,. While
these salts have demonstrated excellent compatibility with Hastelloy N,
there is need for cheaper fluoride mixtures that melt at lower tempera-
tures. On the basis of low cost (approximately 50¢4/1b) and a relatively
dow melting point (about 400°C, necessary for transferring heat to super-
critical steam), fluoroborate salts — especially NaBF, — with small
additions of NaF and/or KBF, have recently become of interest as secon-
dary coolants. Little is known, however, about the corrosion behavior
of these salts.

The space diagram of the ternary NaF-NaBF,-KBF, system (Fig. 1)
shows that the salt mixture under consideration lies very near the NaBF,
corner and has a melting point close to 390°C. Note that oxygen impu-
rities that form BF3;0H-compounds significantly lower the melting point
of the mixture below that shown by the diagram. The vapor pressure of
fluoroborate salts, especially NaBF,, is higher than that of other
fluoride salts, > because in the temperature range of interest the sodium
fluoroborate maintains such an equilibrium with its components that a

significant amount of boron trifluoride gas is present in the system:

NaBF, = NaF + BF;(g) . (1)

Little is known about the corrosion behavior of the Br ges. A few corro-
sion experiments have been TUn with very dry BF; gas ’ “ and little appre-
ciable attack was. found up ‘to 200°C on metals such as brass, stainless
steel, nickel, Monel, mild- steel, and many others.

his report describes’ the first comprehensive study of the com-
patibility of a relatively impure fluorcborate salt with Hastelloy N
and Croloy- OM alloys. The. experiments were designed to yield infor-

mation on temperature gradient mass transfer, the major form of corro-

sion in fluoride salt systems. Two loops were operated with Ne.BF, -NaF-KBF,

(904-6 mole %) salt at ‘8 maximum temperature of 605°C with a temperature
difference of 145°C to obtain the data presented. These ‘temperatures

match those proposed. for fluorcborate salts in a molten salt breeder

reactor.

Materials Section and Febrication

The Croloy 9M material was from Babcock & Wilcox Company heat 18760
and was vapor blasted before fabrication to remove oxides. The loop,
NCL-12, was fabricated from O,750-in. -OD tubing with a wall thickness of
0.109 in. The material was TIG welded and inspected to meet existing

internal standards. The welded areas were torch annealed before and:

after welding.

The Hastelloy N material was from Union Carbide Corporation,
Materials Systems Division heat 5096. The loop, NCL-10, was fabricated
from 0. 672-in. -0D tubing with a wall thickness of 0.062 in., TIG welded
end inspected to meet the same standards as those required for the
Croloy 9M material. oo I

Salt Preparation
The salt was prepared by the Fluoride Processing Group of the

Reactor Chemistry Division at ORNL. This was their first experience

with a fluoroborate salt, and they prepared it by techniques established

. for other fluoride salts. 3 - The raw materials — relatively impure NaBF,,

‘NaF, and KBF, (90-4-6 mole %) (Table 2) — were loaded into a container
lined with nickel, which was then evacuated and purged several times
with helium Then, the materials were melted and heated to 400°C under
- a helium atmosphere. Next, the liquid was sparged with helium Since
this caused a large increase in pressure, the reactor vessel was vented.
Large quantities of BF3, which had caused the increase in pressure, were
then released. Later steps included sparges with a mixture of hydrogen
fluoride and hydrogen for several days at 550°C to remove oxides and a
sparge with hydrogen to remove structural metal impurities. The salt
was then transferred to a fill tank made of Hastelloy N in preparation
for filling the loop.

The chemical analysis (Table 3) of the prepared salt disclosed two
important compositional changes germane to this test series: (1) a
significant loss of BF; during preparation, and (2) a high content of
oxygen and water. Since little was known about the corrosive behavior
of this salt or the effect of impurities and because information on its
compatibility with the container alloys was needed quickly, we decided

to use it as prepared.

~ OPERATIONS

: * The hot portion of each loop was heated by sets of clamshell heaters,
with the input power controlled by silicon controlled rectifiers (scr
units) and the temperature controlled by a Leeds and Northrup Speedomax H
Series 60 type C.A. T. (current proportioning) controller. The loop tem=-
peratures were measured by Chromel-P vs Alumel thermocouples that were
spot welded to the outside of the tubing, covered by a layer of quartz
tape, and then covered with ‘stainless steel shim stock. |

~ Before each loop was filled with salt, it was degreased with acetone
and heated to 150°C under vacuum to remove any moisture in the system.

n
 

We checked for leaks with a helium mass spectrometer leak detector while
the interior of the loop was evacuated to < 5 X 1073 torr. All lines
from the fill tank to the loop that were exposed to the fluoroborate ’
salt were of the same material as the loop and were cleaned and tested “
in the same manner as the loop. All temporary line connections were
made with stainless steel compression fittings.
The loops were filled by heating the loop, the salt pot, and all
connecting lines to a minimum of 530°C and applying helium pressure to
the salt pot to force the salt into the loop. Air was continuously
blown on the freeze valves leading to the dump and flush tanks to pro-
vide a positive salt seal. Tubular electric heaters controlled by vari-
able autotransformers furnished the heat to the cold-leg portions. Once
the loop was filled the heaters were turned off and the insulation was
removed to obtain the proper temperature difference by exposing portions
of the cold leg to ambient air.
The first charge of salt was dumped after 2, hr in the loops at the
maximum operating temperature with some circulation and little tempera- /
ture gradient. This flush removed surface oxides and other impurities
that could have been left in the loops. The loops were then refilled ~
with new salt and put into operation. A helium cover gas under slight |
positive pressure (about 5 psig) was maintained over the salt in the
loops during operation. Each loop was operated at a maximum temperature
of 605°C and with a temperature difference of 145°C. A temperature pro-
file around the loops is shown around the schematic of the loop in Fig. 3.
During circulation each loop contained about 920 g of salt that con-
~ tacted 1200 cm® of surface and traveled 254 cm around the loop.
Temperature excursions indicated a flow stoppage in NCL~-12 ’
(croloy om) after 1440 hr. Attempts to drain the loop were unsuccess-
ful, and the loop was allowed to cool with the test salt in place. In
 NCL-10 (Hastelloy N), a significant increase of temperature in the hot

leg accompanied by a simultaneous temperature decrease in the cold leg :
occurred after 8335 hr of operation. A perturbation of this type indi- ¢
cates a disruption in salt flow and can indicate plugging. This tem- -

perature cycle ceased after 1 hr, and no further incidents occurred oJ

showed this emerald-green plug to be single crystals of NasCrFg (ref. 6).
Smaller amounts of two complex iron fluorides, NajFeFg and NaFeF,, were
also identified in the cold leg. |

Chemical. — The analysis of the salt ceke (Fig. 5) collected from
the dump tank of NCL-10 is given in Teble 4. The concentrations of
nickel, molybdenum, iron, and chromium in this salt were higher than
those of the salt before test. The average chromium concentration was
470 ppm. |

Due to cooling, nickel was segregated in the top and bottom portions
of the cake, reaching 11.15 and 4.47 wt % in these portions, respectively.

mich scatter, but we believe that the oxygen content also increased.

Presumably these increases are due not to air inleakage but to other
factors discussed later in this report.

The crossover line to the cold leg, the cold leg, and the crossover
line to the hot leg all showed slight increases in wall thickness due to
deposition of complex surface layers (Fig. 6). Chemical analysis of the
layers disclosed that they were primarily metallic nickel (60 to 90 wt %)
and molybdenum. A small quantity of iron was present in proximity to the
base metal, but chromium was conspicuously absent.

Metallurgical. — Micrometer measurements of the hot leg of the loop
disclosed 1 to 2 mils of metal loss and slight surface roughening.

Metallographic examination of an area from the hottest section
(605°C) , however, showed a smooth surface with an occasional penetra-~
tion along a grain boundary (Fig. 7). Microprobe traces?’ of this hottest
section for all the alloying elements showed no compositional gradients.
The chromium trace for this section is given in Fig. 8. These results
indicate a general dissolutive attack in the hot-leg section.

An area at the entry of the cold leg (520°C) showed a duplex surface
structure, and the areas numbered in Fig. 9 were analyzed with the micro-
probe for the various elements (Fig. 10). The outermost layer, area 1,
is quite high in nickel — up to 87 wt %. We believe this is most likely
a region where nickel deposited during the test. Area 2 is a region con-
taining essentially only molybdenum and nickel. Close to the original
metal surface there is an increase in nickel, a smaller increase in
molybdenum, and little change in chromium and iron. Note that with an
increase in nickel and molybdenum metal the concentration of chromium
and iron would show a decrease even though there were no change in the
actual amounts.

Figure 11, a photomicrograph of the coldest section NCL-10 (460°C)
shows a spongy deposit on the surface and a loosely adherent corrosion
product beyond this region. At higher magnifications, it was seen that
the tightly attached spongy deposit varied in thickness from O to 6 um

and that it resembled the area seen in the entry to the cold leg, although

- much thinner. The spongy layer is high in nickel, with some molybdenum,

and appears, like the area 1 of Fig. 9, to have resulted from nickel
deposition (Fig. 12). There was only 63% metal in this spongy layer;
the balance was fluoride compounds . The original surface is high in
nickel and molybdenum and low in chromium and iron and is an area where
nickel and molybdenum have diffused into the matrix. No analysis of the
loosely adherent material was possible.

The last section of the loop examined was an area at the entrance
to the hot leg. Although the salt was being heated here, the temperature
was still low enough (< 530°C) to make this an area where material was

"being deposited. Again, a duplex layer was seen (Fig. 13) and found to

be predominantly nickel, 65 to 90% metal and the balance fluoride com-

. pounds (Fig. 14). X-ray diffraction analysis of the fluoride compounds

disclosed an unidentifiable crystal structure, probably a mixture of
several fluoride compounds. ‘The surface layer had somewhat more nickel
‘and molybdenum than originally, and, thus, smaller concentrations of

chromium and iron.

NCL-12 (Croloy 9M)

Visual. — When this loop was sectioned for examination, a dark
gray plug that completely filled the cross-sectional area for a vertical
distance of 1 in. was found in the cold leg (Fig. 15). Also, small,
green crystals were seen in the drain line, and a metallic layer was
found against the inside of the tubing in the cold section and in the

~The “thin metallic layer ‘sbout 2.5 mils thick was deposited on the
inside of the tubing in the entire cold-leg section (over one-half the

loop). In some places, the material had become detached from the tubing
and was found in the frozen salt (Fig. 16). The metallic layer repre-

sented about 4% of the total mass of the material (mostly salt) removed
(oy mechanical means) from the loop. Chemical analysis revealed the layer
to be 90 wt % Fe and 10 wt % Cr metal.

The dark-gray plug located in the coldest part of the loop was com- -
posed of dendritic crystals. We found similar crystals adhering to speci-
mens in the hot leg (Fig. 17) , but we assume that these crystals, growing
and circulating in the salt stream, attached themselves to the ‘specimens
while the loop was cooling. -

Metallurgical. — Metallographic examination of the hot-leg loop
tubing (Fig. 18) disclosed a fairly smooth surface, and micrometer mea-
surements showed an average 2.5 mil loss from a nominal pipe diameter.

Electron microprobe analyses were made on tubing from the hot- and
~ cold-leg sections of NCL-12: the hot-leg analysis (Fig. 19), consistent
with the metallographic results, showed no iron or chromium concentration
gradients; the cold leg analysis (Fig. 20) showed an increase of about
4 wt % in iron concentration and a decrease of sbout 4 wt % in chromium

concentration (i.e., an iron-rich surface layer).

- DISCUSSION

The tests described are the first study of the compatibility of a
fluoroborate salt with container materials of interest to molten-salt
reactors. Unfortunately, little was known at the time of the test about

the purification of the salt or the characteristics of mass transfer in

systems containing such salts. The use of loops of an old design pre-
vented our having any removable specimens, but permanent hot-leg specimens
were used in NCL-12.

Our expectation, based on previous experience with fluoride salts,
was that temperature gradient mass transfer of the least noble constit-
uent (i.e., chromium and iron) would be the limiting factor. But salt
analyses after the test indicated that all the major alloying elements
of the container materials had mass transferred. The nonselective attack
was also confirmed by metallographic examination and microprobe analysis
of the loop specimens and piping. In view of the movement of nickel and
molybdenum, it is obvious that highly oxidizing conditions, due to water
and oxygen in the salt, were present during the operation of the loops.

In analyzing NCL-10 and -12, we reviewed earlier studies? (late

1950's) to single out the cases of mass transfer of nickel and molybdenum.

‘We. found several instances where this had occurred in salts containing

KF. One such loop, constructed of Hastelloy N, operated for a year with

‘a NaF-LiF-KF salt (11.5-46.5-42 mole %) at a maximum temperature of 690°C

with a temperature difference of 90°C. No analysis for oxygen or water
was made before test. Examination after test disclosed green crystals
embedded in the salt. Salt analyses showed significant increases in
nickel, iron, molybdenum, and chromium content. X-ray analysis showed
that the green crystals were mixtures of sodium and potassium chromium
fluoride complex compounds and that most of the KF present in the salt
was actually KF.2H0.
Another loop, constructed of Inconel, (ni-16% Cr—10% Fe) operated
about one-half year with the seme salt and at the same temperatures as
above. After test, metallographic examination showed heavy attack in
the hot-leg portion of the loop. After test only the chromium and iron
contents of the salt were determined; the chromium content had increased
significantly from 60 to 900 ppm. X-ray analysis of the salt disclosed
that the salt was about 15% KF-2H,0. The relatively well-defined x-ray
pattern of this hydrate suggested that it was not formed when the cold
melt was exposed to air but was carried as a part of the salt mixture
during operation. ® The compound KF» 2Hz0 is known to be thermally stable.
The literature states that KF easily forms a series of crystal hydrates,
whereas LiF and NaF crystallize anhydrously.’ It is also noted that it
is easy to form KBF3 OH and NaBF3;0H and that they are quite stable.

Thus we have seen that during the molten-salt reactor corrosion

program, salts containing KF have on occasion been very aggressive toward

metals. "We believe that the reason for this is the combined water asso-

“ciated with that alkali metal fluoride salt. We again stress that we

found no leakage of air into ‘any of the loops. This suggests that
hydrated KF is not removed by the purification process. ‘Paradoxically,
it appears that combined water in the fluoroborate salt mixture can be

. released and will react to ‘produce: HF by

Ho0 + BL =HF + BF50H . (2)

The generation of HF in the system leads to the following reactions with

“the elements of the container material:

2HF + Ni ==NiF; + Hp , | (3)
6HF + Mo =MoFs + 3Hz , (4)
2HF + Fe = FeF; + Hp , (5)
2HF + Cr ==CrF, + Hy . | (6)

Note that, in the temperature range of interest, changes in the
standard free energy of formation are not favorable for all the reactions
as written. However, studies on the Fluoride Volatility Processing
schemel® at ORNL showed that in a Hastelloy N hydrofluorinator containing
fused fluoride salts and HF, chromium and iron were rapidly leached from
the alloy at elevated temperatures (500 to 650°C) even when the HF activ-
ity was quite low. The main reaction is the oxidation of the metal by
the HF to form fluorides soluble in the melt. It was found that NiF, is
produced by driving the reaction through the continuous removal of hydro-
gen and reaction products, since the free energy of formation (above
490°C) of the nickel fluoride reaction by Eq. (3) is not favorable. For
the same reason, molybdenum can also be forced to react with HF even
though a positive change in free energy is involved. Evidence of small
but finite dissolution rates of molybdenum metal during hydrofluorination
conditions have been reported.ll,1?

In light of the discussion above, we can now consider why two dif-
ferent types of products (i.e., metal and fluoride compounds) were mass

transferred in these (NCL-10 and 12) thermal convection loops.

Thermodynamics of System Corrosion

The cycle of mass transfer initiated by the corrosion of metals by
fluoride salts is known to begin in the hotter regions of a loop system
with the formation of structural metal fluorides that are soluble in the
salt:

M+F =MF , 7)

where M is the attacked metal of the container.

The equilibrium constant for Eq. (7) increases with increasing tem-
perature; thus, in a multicomponent alloy the concentration of the
attacked constituent, M, will decrease at loop surfaces at high temperg~
ture (weight loss) and increases at surfaces at lower temperatures (weight
gains). At some intermediate temperature, the initial surface composi-
tion of the structural alloy will be in equilibrium with the fused salt
(no weight change).

In the cooler regions of a closed system, the rate at which the
metal is deposited (steady state condition before plugging) is generally
equal to the rate at which it diffuses into the metal — a necessity to
maintain its equilibrium activity on the surface. Thus the rate of
diffusion of the metal in the alloy in the cooler regions usually con-

‘trols the rate of corrosion in the hot zone. At this stage in the tem-

perature-gradient mass-transfer process, weight gains would be found on
specimens in the cold section but little if any surface change (deposits)
would be seen. This generalization is valid only when the equilibrium
concentration of a metal fluoride compound in the salt [produced by

. (7)] does not exceed the saturation concentration of a metal fluoride

comport in the salt at the low temperature.

Early studies reported by Grimes? clearly illustrate these points.
Table 6 shows the chromium concentrations for two salts as functions of

“the equilibrium between the salts and Inconel or pure chromium. Note
that when the alkel i-metal fluoride salt (NaF-KP-LiF-~UF) is in contact

with Inconel at 800°C it will support a higher concentration of chromium

fluorides (1660 ppm Cr) than it will when it is in contact with pure
chromium at 600°C (1100 ppm cr). Accordingly, circulation of such a
salt in an Inconel loop would result in the deposition of essentially
pure chromium metal in the cold zone. In that case, the total rate of
attack would be controlled simply by diffusion of chromium to the inter-
face between metal and salt in the hot zone. We believe that the deposi-
tion of pure iron in NCL-12 (croloy 9M) occurred this way. This is not
8 new phenomenon. Rapid plugging by deposition of metal dendrites occurred
frequently in the late 1950's especially in iron-base alloy loops.l1%4,13
Examination of the data for the other salt shown in Table 6
(NaF-ZrF,-UF,) leads to the conclusion that chromium metal would not
plate out in that system and that any product of mass transfer would be
a fluoride compound. At 600°C this salt in equilibrium with pure chromium
will support a higher concentration of chromium fluorides than it will

in contact with Inconel at 800°C. For gross deposition of compounds to
occur, the concentration of the compound at the temperature of interest
(cold zone) must exceed the saturation concentration of the metal fluoride

corrosion product present in the system.

We believe that the mechanism in NCL-10 (Hastelloy N) is similar to
the one discussed above for the NaF-ZrF, system and that in time the con-
centration of chromium — or more accurately the concentration of mixed
metal chromium fluoride — in the fluoroborate salt at 605°C exceeded the
saturation concentration at 460°C and allowed deposition of large quan-
tities of complex compounds.

Both NCL-10 and NCL-12 operated with the same salt at the same tem-
perature, yet they were plugged by different mechanisms at different
rates. A chromium-rich plug was found in the Hastelloy N loop (containing
7% Cr—5% Fe) and an iron plug was found in the Croloy 9M loop (containing

9% Cr—bal Fe). Thus, it appears that when these fluoroborate salts
are contained in alloys with between 7 and 9 wt % Cr, the iron content

of the alloy controls the composition of the temperature-gradient
mass~transfer deposit.

Kinetics of System Corrosion

With the foregoing asta and evaluation, it is now possible to deter-
mine when plugging started in NCL-10 and -12 and the disposition of each

element at various times.
We calculated the interim concentrations for chromium and iron in

~ NCL-12 from knowledge of the amount of these elements after test, the

weight of the iron plug, and an assumed reaction-rate constant and mode
of chemical attack (from later experiments). 16 The results of the cal-
culations, presented in Table 7, show that the saturation value of iron
in the cold section, 700 ppm or 1120 mg, was exceeded shortly after

130 hr; at that time pure iron started depositing and eventually caused
a complete plug. Co = ’

Table 8 shows the same: ‘kind of calculations for the operation of

NCL-10. In this case, it appears that the saturation value of chromium

in the cold leg, 470 ppm, was reached after about 4000 hr of operation;
at that time, the chromium, as Na3CrF¢, started depositing in large
amounts . 17

It is interesting to note that in both cases the amounts of the
alloying elements in the salt and in the plug were in about the same
ratio as they are in the base metal. Capsule tests and other loop tests )
have shown that when constituents of an alloy react with the liquid medium
they will be found in the liquid and/or deposited in the ratio at which
they existed in the alloy. 18 This behavior was found in both loops of
this experiment.

Nickel and molybdenum mass transfer products, not normally found in
relatively pure fluoride salt systems, also follow this pattern. As has
been stressed here, the presence of gross quantities of nickel and molyb-

denum indicates strongly oxidizing conditions.

Salt Purification

The salt used in these experiments contained many impurities that
the old techniques, successful with other fluoride salts, did not remove.
Since these experiments, improvements have been made in the fluoroborate
salt preparation. Only very pure salt (99.9%) is now used as starting
material. In fact, the salt has so few impurities that no steps are

17 Several suggestions, besides the removal of the water or oxygen
from the system, are offered to improve the service of the container
materials using this fluoroborate salt. The most obvious change is to
lower the hot-leg temperature to 540°C thus lowering the reaction-rate
constant an order of magnitude. It would then take three times as long
to duplicate the previous plugging. Another possibility is to raise the
temperature in the cold-leg section. This would raise the saturation
value of the elements in the salt, and depositing would not occur until
later. But this probably would not improve the life by the same factor as
above. Probably the most important improvement is removing corrosion
Products from the system on a continuous or batch-wise basis since
deterioration (thinning) of the container wall by dissolutive corrosion
is not a problem in these systems.

taken during processing to remove the structural metals. Purification
procedures for removing water and oxygen are now under study. A new
procedure is also used in the melting and preparation of the fluoroborate
salt to prevent loss of BF; vapor and the ensuing change of composition.
In brief, the loaded salt is evacuated to about 380 torr and heated to
150°C in a vessel lined with nickel and is held for about 15 hr under
these conditions. If the rise in vapor pressure is not excessive, (no
volatile impurities) the salt is heated to 500°¢, while still under
vacuum, and agitated with helium for a few hours. The salt is then
ready for transfer to the fill vessel.

CONCLUSIONS

1. Natural circulation loops, fabricated from Hastelloy N and
Croloy 9M, that circulated impure (> 3000 ppm impurities) Na.BF, -NaF-KBF,,

(90-4-6 mole %) at a maximum temperature of 605°C with a temperature

difference of 145°C evidenced serious temperature-gradient mass transfer.
The mass transfer involved migration of all major constituents of the con-
stituents of the container materials and resulted in restricting flow in
the Hastelloy N loop by deposition of Naj;CrFe crystals and complete plug-
ging of the Croloy 9M loop by iron dendrites.

2. The nonselective corrosion observed was due to the presence
of water, chemically bound to the fluorcborate salts, that reacted
during heating to form HF.
3. The driving force for mass transfer was the. temperature depen-

dence of the equilibrium constant between the container material con-

‘stituents and the most stable fluoride compounds that can form in the

system. oo
"4. The saturation concentrations for iron and chromium in the test
salt at 460°C were found to be 700 and 470 ppm, respectively.

RECOMMENDATIONS

1. Other, more highly purified fluoroborates should be extensively
tested for corrosion before these coolants can be qualified for molten-

salt reactor service.
 

 

38

2. Based on knowledge to data, iron-base and iron-containing alloys
should be avoided in molten-salt reactor coolant circuits that use
fluoroborate salts.
