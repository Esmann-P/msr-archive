INTRODUCTION onli

Two mutually dependent factors influencing the feasibility of breeding are the losses
of fuel atoms in chemical processing and the losses of neutrons due to absorption by fission
products. If the fission products are removed by processing exceedingly frequently, the
neutron losses mentioned would be low but the fuel atoms lost would be exhorbitant; con-
versely if processing were conducted less and less frequently, the fuel atoms lost in pro-
cessing would diminish but the neutrons absorbed by fission products would become prohibitive.
Hence it seems desirable to minimize the sum of these two losses with respect to processing
period and to estimate the magnitude of the losses around the optimum value. It 1s felt
that sufficient data are available on certain processing losses and cross-section values to
give a reasonable estimate of the probable range of these combined losses and of the optimum
processing periods.

J. A Lane, et a, have considered the various factors influencing the financial
and neutron efficiencies of a UZJJ breeder. For a particular pile configuration, they com-

puted the U233 production as a function of processing period.
| The purpose of the first part of the current paper was to construct an expression for
the fuel losses due to chemical processing plus the neutron losses due to absorption by
fission products and to investigate the influence of the various parameters on the magnitude
of the losses and on the optimum processing period.

In these calculations the fission products have been divided into three classes: those
removed continuously as rare gases, those with relatively low cross-sections and those with
quite high cross-sections. Then the sum of the two types of losses under consideration
has been minimized with respect to processing period. Our interest here has been limited
largely to the 0233 breeder although the treatment should hold for any homogeneous thermal
reactor.

The second part of the paper deals with the build-up of heavy isotopes both in the
reactor and blanket of a U233 breeder and the effects of these species on neutron economy
and chemical processing. The build-up and the effects of g23h e332, and u236 have been

(2)
quite thoroughly considered by S. Visner . Some of these higher isotope computations

have been repeated here, however, since it was felt desirable to include effects of add
and some still higher species.
I. Fission Product Poison losses vs Processing Losses

In considering the factors determining reactor efficiency, one must optimize with re-
spect to some pertinent parameter. For converter and power reactors one wants the cost per
unit product optimized. However, for breeder piles, until we are comvinced that breeding is
feasible, it seems more reasonable to minimize neutron plus fuel losses.

A calculation of the optimum processing period was carried out on the basis of a num-
ber of simplifying assumptioms. All the variables considered have been extended through a
reasonable range of values, and it is felt that the actual values to be realized in a given
reactor system should lie within the range covered.

The fission products were rather arbitrarily divided into three groups:

 

Average
Fission yield FHNeutron capture cross-section
symbol value symbol value
G: Removed from reactor as rare gases -- 0.385 - --
R: Highly capturing Rare Earths ¥y 0.015 i 50,000 b
A: Remaining Ys 1.6 0s 50 b

The values of y. and Or for the highly absorbing rare earths are rounded off figures
from the results of Ingraham, Hayden and Hess Phys. Rev. 79, 271 (1950)/, end consist
mainly of su? (y = 0.011, ("= 47,000) and Sul! (y = 0.0044, 0= 7200). The actual value
of 0. is not very important as this group is essentially entirely removed by neutron capture,
and this condition would mot be altered significantly by rather large changes in 0,

The yield for all the fissiom products with rare gas ancestors was estimated by Coryell,
Turkevich et al. in 194k to be about 30%; it was estimated that this fraction of all the -
fission products could in principle be removed as gases leaving 70% or 1.4 atoms per fission
in a homogeneous reactor solution. A yield of 0.6 for the removable £1ssion products is
probably optimistic under amy practical comnditioms: perhaps 0.4 is more realistic. The
actual value used was 0.385 (i. e. 0.4 less 0.015) so the total yield per fission would be

exactly two. The cross-section value of 50 barns is somewhat larger than the value of
-3-
(3)

E. P. Steinberg for the average cross-sections for fission products (other than rare
earths) resulting from a Hanford slug which had been irradiated for 10 months and cooled
for three years; their value was 38 barns. A more pessimistic value was taken since the
average value for short-lived fission products almost certainly will be different from that
of long-lived species and the value may be higher. Steinberg et al. concluded that with
the possible exception of the 275 4 Cell (yield = 0.053), there are mo long-lived fission
products of unknown high cross-section.

If no fission products were removed as gases, the value of 5, would become essentially
2,0 (actually 2.0 less 0.015 less 0.061) and a mew "group" of fissiom products would be
added, namely xe130 with a yield of 0.061 and an essentially infinite cross-section.

The total losses per fission, L, is here defined as the sum of the chemical losses of
fuel atoms plus the meutron losses due to fission product capture weighted by the relative
importance of a fuel atom and a neutron. This relative importance is here assumed to be
unity. (Actually a better figure is the ratio of fuel atoms produced to fuel atoms burned.)
Hence the total loss at any time t is given by

L = h (fuel atoms lost/fission) + meutroms lost to poisoms/fission

=h (u?33 atoms lost in chem. proc./cycle)/(fissions/cycle) +(n's captured by F. P.'s/
cycle)/(£issions/cycle),
where h may be comsidered equal to the breeding gain; we shall let h = unity.
Then the first term om the right is equal to 1./¢ Ge T
where 1, = chemical losses, i. e., atoms v2>3 lost/atom processed.
f = neutron flux
(f= fission cross-section of the fuel atoms

T = processing period.

It is assumed here that the chemical processing losses are directly proportiomal to the

amount of fuel processed.

For batch processing, i. e. periodic processing of the emtire reactor fuel the neutron

losses may be computed as follows:

Tt is assumed that the loss of atoms Ny, by beta decay is negligible compared to loss
by neutron capture; if this is not the case, the above differential equation should
contain an additional term; = ApNr.

In the case of the remaining fission products (not removed as gases) it is

It is interesting that T always appears in the equation as the product £7 3 hence Ly
can be optimized with respect to £7 and then for any value of £ the optimum T is
readily obtained. To obtain the optimum period one may differentiate with respect to
fT, equate to zero and solve for £Y; or one may simply plot Ly against 7 or £ T o The
latter method gives more information for relatively little more work since solving the
differential equation would be done by trial and error or by plotting anyway. Inspection
of this equation shows that for positive values of f T and for the range of variables

studied here only one minimum is possible.

A simplified approximation for the optimum £7 results if f Op is quite large.
In this case Np rapidly approaches -its equilibrium value of yNeOz/ 3 and then

Ly becomes

Perhaps a more meaningful basis than loss per fission would be loss per fuel
atom destroyed. The values given by the above equation may be converted to losses per

fuel atom destroyed by dividing Lp by (1 +O), where CA is the neutron capture to

fission ratio for fuel atoms. (1 4& ), of course, equals ord .

As more detailed information on fission product yields and cross-sections becomes

becomes

available, the neutron absorption effects can be broken up into several terms like the
last two in the equations for L, and I; sbove. The magnitudes of the cross-sections and
yields would determine the number of terms desired and the bulk of the species with smaller
cross-sections vould as here be lumped into a single term. Also for radioactive species
such terms should include decay constants; these of course go into the differential equa-
tions as additional coefficients of the Ne and Nn terms. The present status of our knowledge
~ concerning chemical processing losses as well as fission product yields and cross-sections
does not justify a more detailed calculation at present. The data which now exist may be
found in the National Bureau of Standards Circular 499 and Supplements to this circular by
K. Way, L. Farro, M. R. Scott and K. Thew. Thése data have been summarized by R. P. Schuman,
KAPL-634 (August 1951).

L. and I, are plotted against fv” for various values of the variables in Figs. 1, 2,
3, 4, 5 and a summary of the optimum values ie given in Table I. In Table I the first
column indicates the variables in question, the second column lists the standard values of
these variables and the third column shows the values of the variables in question used in
calculating the results given on each line.

Fig. (1) shows the effect of changing the chemical processing losses lc from 0.0003 to
0.005. Fig. 1 can also be interpreted as showing the influence of varying the factor h
(the relative value of a U233 atom and a neutron) while keeping 1, and the other variables
constant. The 1; = 0.0003 curves correspond to h = 0.3 and 1 = 0.001 and the 1, = 0.005
curves correspond to h = 5 and 1. = 0.001. If h is considered as the breeding gain, its
value would very likely lie between 0.90 and 1.25; however, if h is used to signify the
relative dollar value of a U233 atom and a neutron it may differ from unity by as much as

a factor of five.

Fig. (2) shows the effects of increasing the fission cross-section of the fuel 0
from 500 to 800 barns; this is about the difference which would occur if the fuel were
changed from y233 to Pu239., In Fig. (3) the product of fission yield and absorption cross-
section, ¥s0as is varied from 20 to 200 barns; this essentially indicates the effect of
varying the value of Ca from 12.5 to 125 barns. Also from Fig. (3) an indication of the
magnitude of the change to be expected on raising ¥, from 1.6 to 2.0 may be deduced. The
effects of varying y, and 0; are shown in Figs. (4) and (5). Fig. (6) shows the effects
of adding another fission product of yield 0.05 and cross-section of 300 or 3000 barns to
those already considered.

From these curves it can be concluded that in all cases batch processing affords (2)
smaller losses, (b) minimum Iosses at a larger value of £4, and (c) a flatter minimum, than
the continuous processing. Tt may further be concluded that for any reasonable value of
the variables in a particular case, the losses due to processing and neutron absorption by
fission products are expected to be in the range of 2.5 to 6.0%. The best estimates at
present seem to be about 3.0% for batch processing and about 3.5% for continuous processing,
the percentages here being given on the basis of neutron losses per fissionable atom de-
stroyed (by neutron absorption). Incidentally conclusion (a) holds for any conceivable
combination of half lives and cross-sections among the fission species; see Appendix A.

In spite of the advantages of batch processing mentioned here, any isolated reactor
system would undoubtedly be processed on a continuous basis because of the large hold-up
of fissionable material which would be required for batch processing. At least twice the
capacity of the reactor would have to be on hand if it were desirable to keep the pile
operating while processing the removed fuel; intermittent pile operation and processing, to
avoid such hold-up of material, would seem to be at least equally undesirable. If on the
other hand, several reactors were located at one installation then only one additional
reactor-full of held-up material should be required if all piles were processed batchwise
in series. The percentage of material held-up and not in pile operation would be much

smaller--perhaps as small as in the case of continuous processing. Under these circumstances

the advantages of batch processing may well outweigh the disadvantages. It has been pointed
out that the assumption that the processing losses will be proportional to the fuel atoms
processed may not be valida for all methods of processing. For example, with an ion exchange
method, fuel solution could be poured through an absorption column until the radiation had
destroyed the usefulness of the resin or until the column wes loaded with fission products
and the urenium losses on the column might be essentially independent of the rate of
throughput. This might be true and in such a case the treatment given here would not nec-
essarily be expected to hold for ion-exchange processing; it is not entirely clear, however,
exactly how an ion-exchange continuous process would be carried out. It is felt that the
calculations made in this report would be pertinent to a solvent extraction process whether

conducted in light water or directly in heavy water.

II. The Effects of Bulld-Up of Heavy Isotopes

In a UR33 thermal breeder the U233 concentration in the core will remain essentially
constant by addition of new material as the fuel 1s burned, and the isotopes yR3k 0235
and U236 will 8lowly grow in and attain concentrations of roughly the same order of magni-
tude as that of the U233. Other species, e. g. U237, Np237, Wp238, Pu238, pu239, y231,
ve32, etc., will also grow in in smaller amounts and the methods and schedule of processing
the fuel will determine the maximum levels of the Np and Pu isotopes. The following sche-
matic diagram indicates most of the pertinent reactions which will occur in the core.
Neutron fission reactions are omitted although U231, 1232, ¢233 u23%, 1237 anda Pu39 are

known or expected to undergo fission with thermal neutrons.

The nuclides U231, 1238, U239, Np239 and Pu239 will not be discussed subsequently

 

 

gince they will exist in rather small concentrations and since calculations concerning
their build-up would be very unreliable.

The effects of the uranium lsotopes consist largely of increasing the total uranium
concentration and specific alpha activity. The total uranium concentration at equilibrium
becomes about 2.18 times that at the start-up of the pile. The alpha activity change will
depend largely on the U232/0233 ratio ae discussed below. In addition, the U237 growing
in will cause even the "decontaminated" fuel to contain appreciable quantities of beta and

gamma radioactivities. The effect on neutron economy is small.

Where f represents the neutron flux, a. and (a indicate respectively cross-sections
for neutron capture and for neutron absorption (i. e. fission plus capture). The N's indi-
cate the concentrations of the various species; the subscript and parenthetical numbers are
the usual code symbols for the heavy isotopes, e. g. 23 represents element 92, mass 233.

The fission cross-sections for both y23h and v236 are negligibly small.

The final equilibrium values of the relative concentrations of U233, 1234 0235, ang
1236 are obtained by equating these differential equations to zero and solving for the vari-
ous isotopic ratios. The following ratios are obtained using the cross-sections given in

Table II.

The values of a', b', c', d' and g' were obtained in terms of g, the various cross-

The value of q used for £ = 10° was 2 x 10 ~~ cm .

While these calculations are quite elaborate, the methods used here are considered
better, if a desk calculator is available, then using sufficiently precise approximate
expressions.

Values of Nyn/Bp3 and curies of v7 per gram of Pd are shown in Table IV. The
subsequent approximate expressions were used to obtain the values of Nyr/Nosz at the

shortest times and to check the values at t x 1072 = 1, 3 and 10 and at the longest times.

The first involves substituting the approximate expression for Nog/Noz, i.e.,
the expression proportional to +2 , into the differential equation, for Ro7 growth
given previously, solving the resulting equation, expanding the exponential term

in the solution and dropping off higher terms.

The second approximation, which actually can be as accurate as one wishes with
enough work; providing N26/Noq is known as a function of time, utilizes the assumption
that N26 can be considered constant over small increments of ft at the higher values

of the latter. On this assumption the differential equation becomes
dNa7/dt = W26 £0(26) - Npp q £,

where Npg is the average value of Nog over the time increment in question At = t-t'.

The concentration of Np237 will depend on the processing method, i.e. whether
or not neptunium is removed from the fuel during processing. If it is not removed

it will continue to build up with time and its relative concentration will be given

until its destruction rate by neutron absorption becomes significant. The accurate
expression for N27/Np3 given previously may be put into this equation and integrated,
thereby giving an accurate expression for N37/¥Nos5 for shorter times. At longer times
the concentration would be obtained by integrating the equation

becomes

Where 7 is the processing period and a is the fraction of Np removed from the fuel

possible relative concentration of Np23T at equilibrium, assuming a = O and assuming

the values of cross-sections given in Table II, would then be

Considering the growth of Np237 for intermediate and long times under the con-
dition where none of it is removed by chemical processing, it may be assumed that
the production of Np237 is equal to the neutron capture by 0236 less the neutron

absorption by y237 and Np237, i.8.,

dN37 _ — = N27 _
— = Wf o(26) 7% N37£ 0e(37)

where Nog is the average concentration of 0236 over any interval At or A (ft).

On integration the increase of Np237 in any interval becomes

A

Ny (We 0e(26) Aer Ny] [yo TeOTAGM)
No3 [N23 Oe(37) af Nps

where N37 is the concentration of ad at the beginning of the interval A (ft).
This expression should be quite accurate for longer times of reactor operation

providing the Np23T is not removed by chemical processing. If the Np is removed
by processing then A N37 may be taken as the amount of Np237 produced since the
end of the last processing period if the processing is conducted batchwise. In
the latter case, Ny7/Np3 = 0 and A (ft) becomes £7 at the end of a processing
period; with these substitutions the above equation gives N37/No3 at the end of
a period (providing the period is long compared to the 7 day half life of u237y.

In view of the uncertainty in the factors which determine the Np237 concen-
tration, it was not felt meaningful to calculate the pu238 concentrations except
under certain extreme conditions. .It seems pointless to carry out more calcu-
lations on Pu until a given reactor system is designed, As an example, however,
the N),g in a reactor where equation (2) holds and where Pu is also removed Ly

continuous chemical processing may be obtained in a manner similar to the N37:

The primary reaction sequence, of course, is
Th232(n, )Th?33 3 pa233 £5 233

- and the other reactions may be considered according to their effects on the production
of U233, Neutron capture by the members of the 233-chain involves a double loss, i.e.
a neutron is lost and an actual or a potential ye33 atom is converted into a non-
fissionable y23k atom. Higher isotopes may be built up by neutron capture if the

blanket is not processed very frequently. Fission of U233 need not involve a net
-30-

loss since most of the resulting fission neutrons should be absorbed in the
blanket, especially since most of the fissions will occur toward the inner edge
of the blanket (i.e. the edge nearer the reactor). It may be reasonable to
assume then that absorption by y233 results in neither a neutron loss or gain.
Should some fast neutrons come in contact with the blanket, the (n,2n)
reactions will occur to a small extent. These will involve a small neutron

gain (a negative loss). The principle (n,2n) reaction may be expected to be

Th232(n,2n) Th?31 Le pa3l

in view of the high relative concentration of Th232, The net gain would obviously

- be equal to the number of (n,2n) reactions by thorium less the number of neutrons
absorbed by the pa?3l, |

The principle effect of the U232 will be to increase the specific alpha
activity of the product. U232 decays to the 1.9 y Th?28, all the daughters
of which are much shorter than 1.9 y. Hence the activity resulting from any
U232 will grow with a 1.9 y half life aml finally attain a disintegration rate
six times that of the parent 232 (i.e. five additional alphas from the
daughters). The effect of 23h, in addition to the losses mentioned above, is
merely one of diluting the product with a non-fissioning isotope.

All the calculations nade here assume constant flux, i.e. invariant in
time and independent of position. While this assumption is reasonably good
for the reactor, it is much poorer for the blanket. Should the fuel and blanket
be intimately mixed in a one core reactor, the results here would be somewhat
better for the blanket reactions and somewhat poorer for the reactions con-
cerning the fuel. In the cases of the (n,2n) reactions the calculations are
based upon cross-sections for (n,2n) reaction per unit thermal flux; obviously
any particular value for such a cross-section can hold only for a particular

geometrical configuration. Hence the (n,2n) calculations are particularly poor

unless an appreciable amount of fissioning of 0233 occurs in the blanket or unless
a one region breeder reactor is being considered.

The losses due to capture by members of the 233-chain may be estimated as
follows:

For any reasonable irradiation time, the Th233 concentration will be at its

steady state value because of the short half-life of this species (23.5 m).

~ Hence
Sa = Noof c(02) - Ao3No3 = 0
or No3 = Noof 5¢(02)
A03

The resulting loss of Th233 atoms per ye33 atom produced will then be approximately

No3f 0e(03)t _ £o,(03)

No2f ce(02)t 03

and will remain independent of irradiation time as long as the ye33 production
is directly proportional to irradiation time,
As long as the fraction of Pa233 and U233 atoms absorbing neutrons is small,

the concentrations of these two species may be simply expressed:

For long irradiation times or very high fluxes, more accurate expressions
will be required which take into account the loss of Pa233 and ye33 atoms by
neutron absorption. For the present purposes, however, this is not thought
necessary especially in view of the question concerning the value of the
capture cross-section of Pa233, 1In any case, the methods employed here will
be satisfactory for checking more accurate calculations; also in combination
with successive approximations for the neutron absorptions mentioned the
methods used here can be made essentially as accurate as one wishes.

The total loss (of neutrons and neutron-equivalence of 233-chain atoms)

where h is the breeding gain (i.e. the y233 atoms produced per 1233 atom des-
troyed) and may be assumed equal to about 1.2. The absorption of neutrons by
y233 while producing little or no net neutron losses will cause a time loss
in that for each 233 atom destroyed a Th233 atom is assumed to be produced
and this atom must decay through pa233 to U233,

The y23b formed is produced by capture by The33 and Pa?33 and ye33, the

Thus within the accuracy of the above assumptions the p23k produced by
Th233 capture per U233 produced depends on flux only while the U234 produced
from the other two members of the 233-chain per 0233 atom produced depends
directly on the product ft. The y23l/y233 at any given irradiation time is, of
course, directly proportional to the neutron flux.

Some figures on U233 production, U234/U233 ratios and losses due to p23
production are given in Table VI.

The production of Pa23l and y232 will now be considered. In these calcu-
lations some of the cross-sections are either unknown or poorly known, and hence
the results may be consid ered as very rough estimates or guesses. Since the
half life of Th23l is short compared to the probable irradiation tine, Th32
may be considered to be transformed directly to pa?3l by (n,2n) reaction.

of the cross-section can vary greatly at constant thermal neutron flux. In a

given pile assembly, however, the value of Cn,2n(02) will be constant in time,

rather rapidly with increasing distance from the source of fast neutrons. The value
of On,2n(02) used here is 0,015 barns which is approximately the value for the

(n,2n) reaction on U in the Hanford piles. I. Perlman (MB-IP-62, November 15,

and suggests that the Th232 (n,2n) may be a little lower. Or the other hand
Perlman suggests a higher value, i.e., 290 rather than 150 bars, for the cross-
section for the subsequent pa®3l (n, 7) reaction.

Appendix A
Relative Losses for Batch and Continuous Processing

It might be argued that with some combination of half lives and cross-sections
of the shorter lived fission products it is conceivable that continuous processing
might afford lower losses than batch processing. It can easily be shown that this
is not possible.

Consider a hypothetical fission product of yield y,, capture cross-section
of U3, decay constant A., and concentration Nj; and define A= AL + fay.

Then in the batch case, at time t after the last processing Ny becomes

Comparing these equations term by term at 7 = optimum processing period for

continuous processing, it is readily seen that the two first terms are equal.

 

Each of the other terms is smaller in the batch case than the corresponding
term in the continuous case; this is obvious for the two second terms. The
third terms are very similar to the fourth ones (i.e. they become exactly
similar in the limiting case where Al = 0); hence the argument to be made
for fourth terms will also hold for the third ones.

Take the ratio

Ly (LAT 0 1
Le! NT ANT

 

w-eTy

This ratio is equal to 1/2 at AT = 0, continues to increase as /\ T increases
and finally approaches unity as AT gets indefinitely large. Hence it is
always lesa than unity for finite AT. Any further breaking up of fission
products into additional groups will give further terms like those already
considered, and therefore would not alter the conclusions drawn here. A
possibility not explicitly covered so far is the production of a highly
absorbing species from a moderately long-lived fission product of lower cross-
section; such a case would tend to favor batch processing even more than those
considered above.

The argument so far proves that if the optimum T for continuous processing
is employed for both types of processing the batch method affords lower losses.
Obviously if the batch case were optimized independently with respect to T it

would afford even lower losses.
