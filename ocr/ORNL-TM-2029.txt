INVESTIGATION OF ONE CONCEPT OF A THERMAL SHIELD -.
FOR THE ROOM HOUSING A MOLTEN-SALT BREEDER REACTOR

Abstract:

Fas
=

The concrete providing the biological shield for a
250-Mw(e) molten-salt breeder reactor must be protected
from the gamma current within the reactor room. A con-
figuration of a laminated shielding wall proposed for
the reactor room was studied to determine (1) its abil-
ity to maintain the bulk temperature of the concrete
and the maximum temperature differential at levels be-
low the allowable maximums, (2) whether or not the con-
duction loss from the reactor room will be kept below a
given maximum value, (3) whether air is an acceptable
medium for cooling the wall, and (4) the length of time
that a loss of this coolant air flow can be sustained
before the bulk temperature of the concrete exceeds the
maximum allowable temperature. Equations were developed
to study the heat transfer and shielding properties of
the proposed reactor room wall for various combinations
of lamination thicknesses. The proposed configuration
is acceptable for (1) an incident monoenergetic (1 Mev)
gamma current of 1 x 10'2 photons /cof - sec and (2) an

~ insulation thickness of 5 in. or more. The best results
are obtained when most of the gamma-~shield steel is
‘placed on the reactor side of the cooling channel.

‘1. INTRODUCTION

Ld

Thermal-energy molten-salt breeder reactors (MSBR) are being studied

to assess their economic and nuclear performance and to identify important

“design problems. One design problem identified during.the study made of
a conceptual 1000-Mw(e) MSBR power plant! ‘was that there will be a rather

- intense gamma current in the room in which the molten-salt breeder reactor

is housed. The concrete wall providing the biological shield around the

reactor room must be protected from this intense gamma current to. limit

gamma heating in the concrete. Further, the concrete must. be protected
from the high ambient temperature in ‘the reactor room. One ‘possible
method of protecting the concrete is the application of layers of gamma
and thermal shielding and insulating materials on the reactor side of the
concrete. A proposed configuration of the layered-type wall for the

reactor room is illustrated in Fig. 1.

‘Fig. 1. Proposed Configuration of Reactor Room Wall.

The study reported here was made to investigate this proposed con-
figuration of a reactor room wall for the modular concept’ of a 1000-Mw(e)
MSBR power plant. This modular plant would have four separate and identi-
cal 250-Mw(e) reactors with their separate salt circuits and heat-exchange
loops. This preliminary investigation was made to determine whether or
not the proposed configuration for the reactor room wall will.

1. maintain the bulk temperature of the concrete portion of the wall at
levels below 212°F, | :
2. maintain the temperature differential in the concrete lamination at
less than 40°F (a fairly conservative value), and
3. maintain the conduction loss from a reactor room at 1 Mw or less.
This study was.also performed to determine whether or not air is a suit-
able medium for cooling the reactor room wall and to determine the length

of time over which the loss of this air flow can be tolerated before the o

bulk temperature of the concrete lamination exceeds the maximum allowable

temperature of 212°F.
Analysis of the proposed configuration for the wall of the reactor

‘room was based on an investigation of the heat transfer and shielding

properties of the composite wall shown in Fig. 1. Equations were devel-
oped that would allow these properties to be examined parametrically for

various combinations of lamination materials and thicknesses in the wall.

 
 

 

2, SUMMARY

Methods were devised to parametrically analyze a composite. plane wall
with internal heat generation produced by the attenuation of the gamma
current from the reactor room. = Both steady state and transient conditions
were considered. Thirty-one equations were derived and a computer pro-
gram was written to examine the heat ‘transfer and shielding properties of
the proposed wall for various combinations of lamination materials and
thicknesses. Incident monoenergetic (1 Mev) gamma currents of 1 x 10*2
photons/c? *sec through 3 x 102 photons/ci? ‘sec were examined. A finite
difference approach, with the differencing with respect to time, was
used in the transient-condition analysis to obtain a first approximation
of the amount of time that the proposed wall could sustain a loss of
coolant air flow.

The results of these studies indicate that the proposed configuration
of the laminated wall in the reactor room is acceptable for the cases

considered with an incident monoenergetic (1 Mev) gamma current of 1 x 10?

e)

photons /cuf »sec and a firebrick insulation lamination of 5 in. or more.
Under these conditions, a total of approximately 4 in. of steel is suffi-
cient for gamma shielding. The best results are obtained when the thick-
nesses of the mild-steel gamma shields are arranged so that the major
portion of the steel is on the reactor side of the air channel. However,
the proposed configuration of the laminated wall for the reactor room
does not protect the concrete from excessive temperature when the incident
monoenergetic gamma current is 2 x 102 photons/cn? - sec.

With an incident monoenergetic (1 Mev) gamma current of 1 x 102
photons /cof *sec, the proposed laminated wall will meintain the temperature |
differential in the steel to within 10°F or less for all the cases studied.
The differential between the temperature of the steel-concrete interface
and the maximum temperature of the concrete is less than 15°F for all the
cases studied. The values of both of these temperature differentials are
well below a critical value.

Based on the assumption that the floor and ceiling of the reactor oO

room have the same laminated configuration as the walls, the proposed

wall will allow the conduction loss from the reactor room to be maintained
at a level below 1 Mw for an incident monoenergetic (1 Mev) gamma current
of 1 x 102 photons /caf - -sec if the thickness of the firebrick insulation
lamination is 5 in. or more and if at least 4 in. of mild-steel gamma
shielding is included. a

With a coolant air ‘channel width of 3 in. and an air velocity of
50 ft/sec, air is an acceptable mediom for cooling the proposed reactor
room wall, If the ambient temperature of the reactor room remains at
approximately 1100°F and if the gamma current is maintained at 1 x 102
photons /cuf - sec, the temperature of the concrete will remain below the
critical level (212°F) for ‘approximately one hour after a loss of the
coolant air flow. If a zero incident gamma’ current is assumed, the
"permissible" loss-of-coolant-aiz-Elow time is greater than one hour but
less than two hours.

To determine whether or not a conduction loss of 1 Mw will permit
maintenance of the desired ambient temperature within the reactor room
without the addition of auxiliary cooling or ‘heating systems, an overall
energy balance should be performed when sufficient information becomes

available. This balance should start with the fissioning process in the

reactor and extend out through the wall of the reactor room to an outside

surface.

 
 

3. DEVELOPMENT OF ANALYTICAL METHODS

In the modular concept of a 1000-Mw(e) MSER pover plant, the four
identical but separate 250-Mw(e) molten-salt breeder reactors would be
housed in four separate reactor rooms. One primary. fuel-salt-to-coolant-
salt heat exchanger and one blanket-salt-to-coolant-salt. heat exchanger
would also be housed n ‘each reactor room along. with the reactor. These
items of equipment are to be located un fr from each other in the 52- ft-
long reactor room that is 22 ft wide and 48 ft high. The reactor and the
primary fuel-salt-to-coolant-salt heat exchanger are responsible for the
gamma current in each of the reactor rooms. The proposed configuration
of the laminations devised to protect the concrete from the gamma current
in the reactor room is shown in Fig. 2 with the corresponding terminology

used in the parametric studies made of ® the. somseetie well

In the direction from the interior of the reactor room out to the
outer surface of the wall (left to right in Fig, 2), the layers of mate-
rial comprising the wall are a:stainless steel skin, firebrick insulation,
a mild-steel gamma shield, an air channel, a mild-steel gamma shield, and
the concrete biological shield. The thicknesses of the firebrick insula-
tion and each of: the two mild-steel gamma shields are considered to be
the variable parameters in this study. The thickness of the stainless
steel skin is fixed at 1/16 in., the thickness of the concrete is either

8. ft for an exterior wall'or 3 ft for an interior wall, and the width of

the air channel is fixed at 3 in.

"The temperature of the interior surface of the reactor room wall is

considered to be uniform over the surface and constant at 1100°F. The

temperature of the exterior surface of the wall is considered to be uni-
form over the surface and constant at 50°F for the 8-ft thickness of

concrete (the temperature of the earth for an exterior wall) or at 70°F

‘for the 3-ft thickness of concrete (the ambient temperature of an adjoin-

ing room within the facility for an interior wall). The temperature of

the coolant air is assumed to be 100°F at the bottom (entrance) of the
air channel, and the velocity of the air is assumed to be 50 ft/sec.

The situation examined is basically one involving a composite plane
wall with internal heat generation caused by the attenuation of the gamma
current from the reactor room. Two conditions were considered: the
steady-state condition and the transient condition. The steady-state
condition was considered first and the transient condition was considered

later when the problem of a loss of wall coolant was examined.
Steady-State Condition

Equations were developed to allow the heat transfer and shielding

properties of the composite wall, shown in Fig. 2, to be examined para-

metrically for various combinations of lamination materials and thick-

nesses. A one-dimensional analysis was used, assuming that the tempera-
tures of the interior and exterior surfaces of the wall were constant and

uniform.

 
 

Derivation of Equations

A steady-state energy balance on a differential element of the reactor
room wall can be expressed semantically as follows. The heat conducted
into the element through the left face during the time AS plus the heat
generated by sources in the element during the time AS equals the heat
conducted out of the element through the right face during the time AB:
This is expressed  gebrateatly in Eq. 1.

The applicable boundary conditions for any particular lamination in the
wall are T=T, at x = 0 and T = I at x = L, where T, = the temperature
of the lamination interface at zero location designated in Fig. 2 and

ditions are applied to Eq. 6.

The internal heat generation encountered in this study is caused by
a deposition of energy in the form of heat when the gamma rays are atten-
uated by the materials in the wall of the room. Because of this atten-

uation of the gamma rays, the volumetric gamma heating rate, Q, is a

‘function of the distance perpendicular to the surface of the wall, x.

The equations derived in this study are based on the ‘assumption that the
incident gamma current is monoenergetic, but appropriate equations for

a multi-energetic gamma current are given in Appendix A. For a mono-
energetic gamma current where buildup and exponential attenuation are

considered, the equation for Q(x) becomes

The temperature distribution in any particular lamination of the wall
is given by Eq. 12 when the appropriate constants for that lamination are
used. Equation 12 is ‘used primarily to determine the maximum temperature
in the concrete and to determine the location of this maximum temperature.
To locate the position of the maximum temperature in the concrete, Eq. 12
is differentiated with respect to x, the resulting derivative (dT/dx) is
set equal to zero, and the equation is solved for x. The value of x
obtained gives the distance from the concrete-steel interface to the
position of the maximum temperature in the concrete.

each separate lamination in the wall. These equations are simple con-
duction and convection equations in which all of the heat generated in a
particular Lamaination is assumed to be conducted through a length equal
to two-thirds of the thickness of the particular lamination. The total
amount of gamma heat, 9s deposited per unit area in a direction normal to
the face of the wall is found for any particular lamination by integrating
Eq. 9 over the length, L,. of the particular lamination.

These two methods are in fairly good agreement, ‘and since ‘the values for

second method is simpler to use and easier to calculate. oo

The constants in Eq. 29a that have no identifying subscripts are understood
to be for concrete, Equation 29 is also a transcendental equation.  There-
fore, a trial- and-error method ‘must be used to solve for T,. Once T, and

q, are known, Ty can be calculated by using Eq. 25.

 

Calculational Procedure

Since the calculation of certain of the desired quantities requires
that the value of other desired quantities be known, there is a certain
order in which the problem nust be worked. For a particular case, the:
thickness of each of the laminations in- the wall is selected; ‘and the.
inside (reactor room) and outside (earth: or internal) wall temperatures
are specified. The incident gamma current and the temperature of the
coolant air are also specified. The constants for the various > equations

are selected, and those used are given in Appendix C.-

 
16

With the proper constants for each different lamination, Eq. 17 is
first used to calculate the gamma heat depositions in each of the sepa-
rate laminations Co 9s pgs gg? and q). Equation 23 is then used
to calculate the conduction loss from the reactor room q*. The tempera-
ture drops and the interface temperatures on the reactor side of the air
channel are calculated by using Eqs. 19, 20, 21, and 22. Equation 29 is
used to calculate the value of T;, and then the value of 9% is calculated’
by using Eq. 25. Then q,, is calculated by using Eq. 24, and the value
of Tg is calculated by using Eq. 26. Once the value of Tg is known,
is obtained by using Eq. 14, and the maximum temperature of the

Xr max

concrete is calculated by evaluating Eq. 12 at x = Xp max’
At this point, it is possible to- calculate the vertical temperature

gradient ( °r/ft) in the coolant air. This temperature gradient,

~The entire calculational procedure can now be repeated using the

new air temperature at the top of the air channel, T,. This .calculation
of the temperature of the air at the top of the channel is necessary’
because a higher T, causes the maximum temperature of -the concrete’ to be
higher, and the magnitude of this meximum temperature is one of the
constraints in this study.

computer program is described in Appendix D. The program performs the
calculations in the order described above, and it will handle up to five
material laminations (excluding the air channel) in the proposed reactor

room wall and up to eight energy groups for the incident gamma current.

Transient Case

The problem of the loss of coolant for the reactor room wall is
basically a transient heat conduction problem with internal heat genera-
tion. If the flow of coolant air through the channel in the wall is lost
for an appreciable length of time, the temperature in the concrete and/or
the steel laminations may become excessive. To investigate this situation
with the goal of obtaining a first approximation of the amount of time
that such a loss of air flow could be sustained safely, a finite differ-
ence approach was taken.. The differencing is with respect to time and
the superscript n in the following equations denotes values after the
n-th time interval. |

The proposed configuration of the reactor room wall was broken into
segments of given lengths with nodal points located at the center of each
segment, as shown in Fig. 3. Each segment in the concrete region of the
wall was assumed to be 1 ft thick, each segment in the mild-steel gamma
shields and in the firebrick insulation was assumed to be 1 in. thick,
the entire stainless steel skin ‘was treated as a single segment 1/16 in.
thick, and the air channel was treated as a single segment 3 in. thick.

"The energy balance for a particular segment can be expressed seman-
tically as follows. The heat conducted into a segment during the time AS
plus the heat generated in the segment during the time A§ equals the heat

‘stored in the segment during the time AB plus the heat conducted out of the
segment during the time 29. The corresponding algebraic equation for a

typical ‘segment of the composite wall is given below with Segment 4
selected for illustrative purposes. "

4. PARAMETRIC STUDIES

The parametric studies of the proposed configuration of a leminated
wall for the reactor room, shown in Fig. 2, to protect the concrete bio-
logical shield from the gamma current within the room were made for two
conditions: the steady-state condition and the transient condition.
Parametric studies of the material laminations for the steady-state con-
dition were made to determine whether or not
1. the bulk temperature of the concrete portion of the wall could be

maintained at levels below 212°F, |

2, the temperature differential in the concrete could be maintained at
less than 40°F, and

3. the conduction loss for a reactor room could be maintained at 1 Mw
or less.

A transient condition was investigated to determine the length of time

over which the loss of coolant air flow could be tolerated before the

temperature of the concrete would exceed the maximum allowable tempera-

ture of 212°F.

Cases Studied for Steady-State Condition

For the parametric analysis of the composite plane wall with internal
heat generation for steady-state conditions, the air channel was not con-
sidered as a material lamination but rather as having a fixed width of
3 in. between the first and second mild-steel gamma shields. The tempera-
ture of the incoming cooling air at the bottom of the air channel was
assumed to be 100°F, and the velocity of the air was set at 50 ft/sec.

The thickness of the stainless steel skin on the reactor side or interior
surface of the wall was fixed at 1/16 in., and the temperature of the
interior surface of the reactor room wall was considered to be uniform
over the surface and constant at 1100°F. Equations 8 through 31 derived
in Chapter 3 were used with the TSS computer program described in
Appendix D to examine the steady-state effects of changing the

i

thickness of the firebrick insulation,
total amount of mild steel used for the gamma shields,
3. ratio of the amount of -steel on the reactor side of the air channel
to the amount of steel on the concrete side of the air channel,
4. thickness and outside temperature of the concrete wall, and the
5. magnitude of the incident monoenergetic (1 Mev) gamma current.
Sixty-four separate cases were analyzed for the steady-state con-
dition to determine the effects of changing those parameters of interest.
Data illustrative of the typical effects of varying the parameters were
selected from the results of these analyses and are compiled in Tables 1
through 7. The effects of changing the parameters are given for incident
gamma currents of 1 x 103 and 2 x 10'2 photons fer - sec in all of these
tables, and the conditions at the bottom (entrance) and top (exit) of
the air channel are given for both magnitudes of incident gamma current.
For cases with an incident gamma current of 1 x 10'2 photons/cef - sec,
the maximum temperature of the concrete increases approximately 50°F from
the bottom of the air channel to the top. For cases with an incident
gamma current of 2 x 102 photons /caf «sec and no conduction back to the
reactor room, the maximum temperature of the concrete increases approxi-
mately 80°F from the bottom to the top of the air channel. For a given
gamma current and insulation thickness, the conduction loss changes very
little (about 0.04 Mw) between the bottom and the top of the air channel.
The largest value for the maximum temperature of the concrete at
the top of the air channel in those cases with an incident gamma current
of 1 x 102 photons /ca? - sec and an insulation thickness of 5 in. or more

is approximately 200°F.. On the other hand, the smallest value for the

- maximum temperature of the concrete at the top of the air channel in

those cases with an. incident gamma current of 2 x 1042 photons /en? «sec

and an insulation thickness of 5 in. or more is greater than 250°F.

Tables. 1, 6, and 7 may be compared for the effects of changing the
thickness of ‘the firebrick insulation from 5 in. to 7.5 in. and 10 in.
The addition of 2.5 in. of insulation decreases the conduction loss by
about a factor of 2, and this addition also decreases the maximum -temper-
ature of the concrete by approximately 15°F in those cases with an inci-
dent gamma current of 1 x 102 photons/cnf «sec. |

Tables 1 and 5 may be compared for the effects of changing the
total thickness of the steel in the two gamma shields. Decreasing the
total thickness from 4 to 2 in. causes only a slight increase in the
conduction loss. The maximum ‘temperature of the concrete is increased
approximately 10°F for the cases with an incident gamma current of 1 x 102
photons /cn? « sec and by approximately 20°F for the cases with an incident
gamma current of 2 x 10'2 photons /cnf - sec. |

Tables 1 and 3 and Tables 2 and 4 may be compared for the effects of
changing the ratio of the thickness of the steel on the reactor side of
the air channel to the thickness of the steel on the concrete side of the
air channel. Changing from 4 in. on the reactor side and 2 in. on the
concrete side to 2 in. on the reactor side and 4 in. on the concrete side
increases the conduction loss only slightly and increases the maximum
temperature of the. concrete approximately 10°F.

Tables 1 and 2 and Tables 3 and 4 may be compared for the effects of
changing the thickness of the concrete and the temperature over the out-
side surface of the concrete wall: Changing the thickness of the concrete -
from 8 to 3 ft and the temperature on the outside surface from 50 to 700F
decreases the maximum temperature of the concrete about 10°F but the

conduction loss is not affected appreciably.
Case Studied for Transient Condition  - -

Eighteen finite difference equations, with the differencing with
respect to time, similar to Eqs. 32 through 35 discussed in Chapter 3
were written -to analyze the proposed configuration of the reactor room

wall for one transient-condition case. The analysis was performed to

 
 

 

30

determine the length of time over which a loss of coolant air flow could

be tolerated before the temperature of the concrete would exceed the
maximum allowable temperature of 212°F. Such a loss of coolant air flow
could arise as a result of a malfunction in the blower system supplying the
coolant air. Although natural convection currents would cause some cir-

culation of the coolant air during g blower failure, it was assumed that

 

the coolant air was stagnant during the failure so that the worst case
could be analyzed. Under this assumption, the air channel serves only
as an insulating material and removes no heat from the wall.

The conditions established for the analysis of this particular case
were a 5-in.~thick layer of firebrick insulation, a 4-in.-thick layer of :
mild steel for the first gamma shield, the 3-in.~wide air channel, a 2- |
in.-thick layer of mild steel for the second gamma shield, and a 6-ft-
thick concrete wall for the biological shield. A simple computer program
was written to perform the calculations, but the zero-time temperatures
and heat depositions for each segment in the composite wall were calcu-
lated by hand and used as fixed numbers in the program. This computer
program was used only to obtain a first approximation to the transient
situation for one particular case, and the details of the program are
not presented here.

The program was run for elapsed times of t = 1.0 hr, t = 2.0 hr,

t =3.0hr, t =4.0 hr, and t = 5.0 hr for the condition of internal: heat
generation (reactor at power during blower failure) during the transient
period. The program was then run again for the same elapsed times but
for the condition of no internal heat generation (reactor shutdown
simultaneous with blower failure) during the transient period. The
computer program used to analyze the condition for internal heat genera-
tion is given in Table 8. To analyze the condition of no internal heat
generation, Q2C through Q19SS in Table 8 are set equal to zero. The
resulting temperature distribution in the proposed reactor room wall
analyzed for the condition of internal heat generation during: the
transient period is shown in Fig. 4, and the temperature distribution in
the wall with no internal heat generation during the transient period is OU
illustrated in Fig. 5.

5. CONCLUSIONS

~ Two basic conclusions may be drawn from the results of the parametric
studies made in this investigation of the proposed configuration of a

laminated wall to protect the concrete biological shield from the gamma

current within the room housing a 250-Mw(e) molten-salt breeder reactor, a

fuel-salt-to~coolant-salt heat exchanger, and a blanket-salt-to-coolant-
salt heat exchanger. The first basic conclusion is that with air used
as the wall coolant, the proposed configuration is acceptable for an
incident monoenergetic (1 Mev) gamma current of 1 x 10'2 photons/cnf «sec
for all cases considered in which the thickness of the firebrick insula-
tion was 5 in. or more. A second basic conclusion is that the proposed
configuration is not acceptable for those cases considered with an
incident monoenergetic (1 Mev) gamma current of 2 x 10'® photons/cnf «sec
because the maximum allowable temperature of the concrete (212°F) is
exceeded by 50 to 100°F. The values of several of the parameters of
interest in this study that were obtained from the cases analyzed for

a gamma current of 1 x 102 photons/cuf -sec are given in Table 9.

Based on the assumption that the floor and ceiling of the reactor room
have the same laminated configuration as the walls, giving a total "wall"
surface area of 8276 ft3, the proposed wall configuration will allow the
conduction loss from the reactor room to be maintained at a level below
1 Mw if the thickness of the insulation is 5 in. or more. Further,

based on an air velocity of 50 ft/sec and an air coolant channel width

~ of 3 in., air is an acceptable medium for cooling the wall.

A general conclusion that may be drawn from the limited analysis
made of one transient-condition case is that if the ambient temperature
of the reactor ‘room remains at approximately 1100° F, the proposed con-
figuration of the reactor room wall studied in this case can sustain a
loss of coolant air flow under the conditions described in Chapter 4 for
approximately 1 hour before’ the temperature of the concrete begins to
exceed 212°F. If a zero incident gamma current is assumed, the
"permissible" loss-of-coolant-air time is greater than one hour but less

than two hours.

If a wall of the type proposed is used, the temperature of the con-
crete, Ts or the conduction loss, or both, can be controlled to some
extent by varying the physical characteristics of the wall. The thickness
of the insulation can be increased, but the desirable effect approaches
a limit rather rapidly. As the results of our parametric studies have
indicated, an insulation thickness can be reached that will cause con-
duction back into the reactor room. The total thickness of the mild-
steel gamma shields can be increased with good results up to the point
where the gamma current is reduced by several orders of magnitude.

After this point is reached, adding more steel for gamma shielding does
not produce sizable changes in the maximum temperature of the concrete.

A total of approximately 6 in. of steel is sufficient for an incident
monoenergetic (1 Mev) gamma current of 1 x 10% photons/cof -sec. The
thickness of the mild-steel gamma shields should be arranged so that

the major portion of the steel is on the reactor side of the air channel.
Placing the major portion of the steel on the concrete side of the air
channel results in the undesirable effect of raising the maximum tempera-
ture of the concrete. Shadow shielding of the particular components
within the reactor room that may be causing a large gamma current appears
to be a better solution than increasing the thickness of the wall
laminations for gemma currents greater than 1 x 10'2 photons/cnf - sec.

When sufficient information becomes available, an overall energy
balance should be written, starting with the fissioning process in the
reactor and extending out through the wall of the reactor room to an
outside surface. This balance is necessary to determine whether or not
a conduction loss of 1 Mw will permit maintenance of the desired ambient
temperature within the reactor room without the addition of auxiliary

cooling or heating systems.

Appendix A

EQUATIONS NECESSARY TO CONSIDER A MULTIENERGETIC GAMMA CURRENT

The equations derived in Chapter 3 of this report were based on the
assumption that the incident gamma current is monoenergetic. If the
energy distribution of the incident gamma current is known, this current
can be represented as a multigroup current. The equations in which an
incident multigroup gamma current appears, either directly or indirectly,
must be written to account for this segmentation in gamma energy. This
multigroup modification has been made in the following equations, and they
are to be used in place of the correspondingly numbered equations in
Chapter 3 when the energy distribution of the gamma current is known.

The subscript i denotes the energy group, and the terms are defined in

Appendix E.

TSS COMPUTER PROGRAM

A program was developed for the CDC 1604-A computer to solve the
equations. (Eqs. 8 through 31) necessary to evaluate the proposed con-
figuration of the reactor room wall for the steady-state conditions. As
written, the TSS (Thermal Shield Study) program will handle up to five
material laminations, excluding the air channel, and up to eight energy
groups for the incident gamma current. The calculations are performed
in the order described in Chapter 3. For a problem with five energy
groups and sixteen different combinations of laminations (cases), the
machine time is one minute -and 45 seconds and the compilation time is
56 seconds.

A Newton-Raphson iteration scheme is used to evaluate T, and Xp max’
The convergence criterion for T, is that the right and left sides of
Eq. 29 must agree to within 0.05, and the criterion for Xp ax is that the
right and left sides of Eq. 14 must agree to within 0.10. These conver-
gence criteria could be made smaller with a corresponding increase in
machine time, but very little more real accuracy would be obtained be-
cause the program uses the approximate method to calculate the incident
gamma current at each material interface. If more real accuracy is
required, the program could be modified to calculate the attenuated gamma
current at each interface and to calculate from this information the
incident gemma current at the material interfaces.

"If a vertical temperature profile were known for the interface of

the. reactor room and the skin, the program could be modified to do calcu-
lations at several points up the air channel rather than just at the top
. and bottom as it does at present, Both the setup of the program and the
‘manner in which the necessary input data are prepared. are explained in

- the following discussion.

The TSS computer program is set up for a given physical situation
with a given photon current incident upon the reactor room wall. The

temperature of the inside surface of the wall is fixed at a given value.

 
 

 

48

The composite wall is composed of five material regions, and progressing
from the inside surface outward, these regions are (1) a thin steel skin,
(2) en insulating material, (3) the first steel gamma shield, (4) the
second steel gamma shield, and (5) the concrete biological shield with a
fixed temperature on the outside surface. The 3-in.-wide air channel
placed between the first and second gamma shields is not considered a
material region. By calculating a vertical temperature gradient in the
air channel, the program will calculate at both the bottom and top of
the reactor room wall the ad
1, gamma heat generation rate in each material,
2, temperature at each material interface and temperature changes across:
each material,
3. conduction heat loss from the reactor room to ‘the air channel,
4. radiation heat transfer rate between the walls of the air channel,
5. heat in the concrete conducted both toward and away from the air
channel, and the :
6. maximum temperature in the concrete and its corresponding location.
The program input deck allows the use of any material in any region
of the composite wall. For a fixed incident photon current, a fixed
inside wall temperature, a fixed inlet air velocity and temperature, and
fixed wall materials, the calculation of a particular case is done by -
selecting all material thicknesses and the temperature of the outside
surface of the concrete wall. At present, the program will allow a maxi-

mum of 32 cases to be run, but it can easily be expanded to handle more.

Preparation of Input Data

~The first set of input data consists of energy-dependent information
pertaining to the incident photon current and to the nuclear properties
of the materials chosen for each region in the wall. The order in which

the information is supplied is given on the following page.

The format statement for all of the above cards is 8F9.0. Since
only the first 72 spaces on each data card are used, the last eight may
be used for identification purposes. If fewer than eight energy groups
are used, the unused data fields may either be punched with a zero or
left blank. In either case, the energy-summing DO loops subscripted
J, K, L, and N must be changed to correspond to the number of energy
groups used; that is, if there are six energy groups, DO 100 I = 1,6;
and K, L, and N are also 1,6. If the DO loops are not changed to.corres-

pond to the number of energy groups used, division by zero will occur. -

The next set of data entered is energy independent and is assumed
to be constant over the range of temperatures covered in the program.

This information should be given on the two following cards.

Card 27. CON1, CON2, CON3, CON4, CON5, TO, HT, and HF. The thermal
conductivities (Btu/hr- ft °F) of the materials in each of the five regions
should be entered in the first five data fields. The temperature on the
inside surface of the reactor room wall, TO in °R, the height of the
reactor room, HT in ft, and the £11m coefficient on the sides of the air
channel, HF in Btu/hr- £2 °F, should be entered in data fields six through
eight. The format for this card is the same as that for the previous
26 cards (8¥9.0).

Card 28. TA, EPSIL, VEL, ACHAN, CP, RHO, and SIGMA are respectively
the inlet air temperature, °R, the emissivity of the surface of the air
channel (dimensionless and assumed to be equal for both sides of the air
channel), the velocity of the air, ft/sec, the width of the air channel,
£22, the specific heat of air, Btu/lb:°F, the density of air, 1b/ft®, and
the Stefan-Boltzmsann constant (Btu/hr- £t2 -OR*), These values must be
entered according to format 6F9.0, F18.0. Again, the last eight spaces

can be used for identification.

Preparation of Case Data

Once the input data have been supplied, one card must be prepared
for each case to be run. This card contains EL1, EL2, EL3, EL4, ELS,
and T6. EL1 through EL5 correspond to the material thicknesses (ft) to

be used for each of the five regions in the wall, and T6 is the tempera-

ture of the external surface of the concrete biological shield in °Rr.
The format 8F9.0 allows nine spaces for each data field and the last eight

spaces for identification. For 16 cases, the cards could be numbered:

‘29 through 44. Numbering is for the user's convenience and is not re-

‘quired. The first-DO loop in the program must always be changed to DO

5000 I = 1,N where N is the number of cases to be run. All cases must

have the same air temperature, TA, and the statement immediately

 
 

 

52

following DO 5000 I = 1,N must be written to correspond to the air
temperature used. The DIMENSION statement containing EL1(I) through
EL5(I), T6(I), BOP(I), and BAM(I) must be checked to see that a sufficient
dimension size is given to allow all of the cases to be run, BOP(I) and

BAM(I) are dummy variables and may be left blank.
Typical Computer Sheets

The assembly of the control cards, deck, input data, and case data
cards for the TSS computer program is illustrated in Fig. D.1.. Typical
data for 32 cases to be run with one energy group are given in Table D.1.
The output data at the bottom of the air channel for one case are given
in Table D.2, and the output data at the top of the air channel for the

case are given in Table D.3.
