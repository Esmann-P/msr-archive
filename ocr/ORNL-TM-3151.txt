SUMMARY

The operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) has demon-
strated that a mixture of fluoride salts is a practical fluid fuel that is
quite stable under reactor conditions. The chemistry of the fission prod-
ucts is such, however, that some of them leave the circulating fuel salt
and appear on the moderator graphite in the core, on the metal surfaces ex-—
posed to the salt, and on the metal surfaces in the off-gas system. Xenon
and krypton fission gases are stripped in the off-gas system, where they
decay to daughter nuclides. Some other elements (Mo, Nb, Ru, Te, and Sb)
appear to exist in the metallic state and tend to plate out on metal or
graphite surfaces or be carried out into the off-gas system as particles.
Because it is important in the design of larger molten-salt reactor systems
to know where and in what proportion fission products are distributed
throughout the system, considerable efforts were made to obtain this infor-
mation in the MSRE.

A technique was developed at ORNL to locate and measure fission prod-
uct depositions on surfaces exposed to the salt and in the off-gas system
of the MSRE by the intensity and energy spectrum of the emitted gamma rays.
A gamma-ray spectrometer was developed, consisting of a Ge(Li) detector, a
4096-channel analyzer, and a lead collimator to permit examination of small
areas. This device was usually positioned with the MSRE portable mainte-
nance shield over the different reactor system components, with precise
alignment and location achieved by a laser beam and surveyor's transits.

Measurements were made not only with the reactor system shut down
and drained but also with the fuel circulating and the reactor at several
power levels. Altogether some 1000 spectra were taken, 25% of which were
recorded with the reactor at some power level (a few watts to full reactor
power). Another 400 spectra were taken to calibrate the equipment. Com-
puterized data handling permitted this mass of data to be analyzed quali-
tatively and quantitatively.

Most of the effort was focused on the off-gas system and the primary
heat exchanger, the latter because it contains 40% of the metal surfaces
exposed to the salt. The off-gas system contained not only fission prod-

ucts with gaseous precursors but also metallic elements with their decay
products [such as Nb, Mo, Ru, Sb, Te(I)]. The MSRE heat exchanger con-
tained mostly depositions of the same metallic elements. It was observed
that fission gases form a major source of activity in the heat exchanger
when the reactor is shut down and the fuel is drained immediately (emer-
gency drain).

A high-resolution gamma-ray spectrometer used with proper remote main-
tenance equipment and location tools proved to be very versatile in locating
and evaluating fission product depositions in a highly radioactive reactor

system.
1. INTRODUCTION TO THE MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

1.1 Molten-Salt Reactor Concepts?

The molten—-salt reactor concept originated in 1947 at Oak Ridge as a
system for jet aircraft propulsion. The idea was to use a molten mixture
of fluoride salts including UF, as a fuel that could be circulated to re-
move the heat from the core. Fluoride salts looked promising because of
their basic physical chemistry: the vapor pressure of the molten salts
would be extremely low and they would not react violently on exposure to
air or water. Radiation damage would be nonexistent in the completely
ionic liquid fluorides. Since a variety of interesting fluorides (NaF,
LiF, BeF., ZrF., UF,, etc.) were known to be stable in contact with some
common structural metals, a corrosionless system seemed attainable. In
addition, high specific heat, good thermal conductivity, and reasonable
viscosity made these liquids good heat transfer media. On the other hand,
the high melting point of potential fuel mixtures (400—500°C), while no
drawback during power operation, would require provisions for preheating
the piping and keeping the salt molten during shutdowns. An intensive ef-
fort on molten salt was undertaken at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory,
and by 1954 a molten-salt reactor was operating at temperatures around 800°C.
It had been recognized that the technology of the molten~salt system was
well suited for the development of a commercial Th-?23U power reactor.
Thus, in 1956 the Molten-Salt Reactor Program was established at ORNL.

By 1960 a picture of an economically attractive molten-salt reactor
had come into focus. Its core would contain the graphite moderator in di-
rect contact with molten salt flowing through channels and there would be
either one or two salt streams, If one, it would contain both thorium and

uranium, giving a high-performance converter or even a breeder with a small

breeding ratio.

tors — History, Status and Potential," Nucl. Appl. Tech. 8(2), 107-17
(February 1970).
The basic technical feasibility of the molten-salt reactors was on a
sound footing — a compatible combination of salt, graphite, and container
metal. A salt mixture based on ‘LiF and BeF. looked most attractive from
the standpoint of melting point, viscosity, neutron absorption, and freedom
from mass transfer. A nickel-base alloy, INOR-8, had been developed that
was practically unaffected by the salt at temperatures to 700°C, that was
superior in strength to austenitic stainless steel, and that was susceptible
to conventional fabrication. It was found that salt did not wet or react
significantly with graphite and that, by reducing the graphite pore size,
intrusion of salt into the graphite could be prevented. Although the ma-
terial situation was encouraging and test loops had operated successfully,
a reactor experiment was needed to really prove the technology. Therefore
the objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was to demon-
strate that the key features of the proposed breeders could be operated

safely and reliably and maintained without excessive difficulty.

1.2 Description of the MSRE®

 

The MSRE was to use essentially the same materials as the breeders.
There was no attempt to design it to be a breeder, however, since this
would have entailed added expense and complexity in the form of a large
core or a blanket of fertile material. Some of the important design cri-
teria were:

. core of bare graphite with fuel flowing in channels,
. removable specimens of graphite and metal in the core,

. provision for sampling the salt and adding uranium during operation,

4, fuel temperature around 650°C,
5. power 10 MW or less,

6. heat rejected to the air via a secondary salt loop,

7. fuel pump rather larger than necessary (to minimize scaleup to

the next reactor),

10. enclosure capable of safely containing spill of entire fuel.
The flowsheet that was arrived at is shown as Fig. 1.1.

Details of the MSRE core and reactor vessel are shown in Fig. 1.2,

The 55-in.-diam core was made up of graphite bars, 2 in. square and 64 in.
long, with flow passages machined into the faces of the bars. The graphite
was especially produced to limit pore size to 4 yu to keep out the salt. All
metal components in contact with molten salt were made of Hastelloy N (a
commercial version of INOR-8), which had been approved for construction
under ASME codes, The three control rods were flexible, consisting of
hollow cylinders of Gd;03-Al,03; ceramic canned in Inconel and threaded on

a stainless steel hose. Draining the fuel provided positive and complete
shutdown.

The volute of the centrifugal fuel pump was enclosed in a tank (the
pump bowl) which was the high point in the loop. The pump suction was open
to the salt in the bowl, so that the pump bowl and the connected overflow
tank provided the surge space for the loop. A blanket of helium, generally
at 5 psig, was provided over the salt. A tube into the top of the pump bowl
connected to the sampler-enricher, which was a two-chambered, shielded
transfer box; small sample buckets or capsules containing uranium-rich salt
could be lowered from this transfer box into the pool in the pump bowl. A
spray ring in the top of the fuel pump bowl took about 4% of the pump dis-
charge and sprayed it through the gas above the salt to provide contact
between helium and fuel salt so that the gaseous fission products could
escape into the gas. A flow of 4 liters/min (STP) of helium carried, among
others, the fission gases such as xenon and krypton out of the pump bowl,
through a holdup volume, a filter station, and a pressure~control valve to
the charcoal beds. The beds operated on a continuous-flow basis to delay
xenon for about 90 days and krypton for about 7 1/2 days, so only stable
or long-lived nuclides could get through.

All salt piping and vessels were electrically heated to prepare for
salt filling and to keep the salt molten when there was no nuclear power.

The air-cooled radiator was equipped with doors that dropped to block the

air duct and seal the radiator enclosure if the coolant-salt circulation
stopped and there was danger of freezing salt in the tubes. There were no
mechanical valves in the salt piping; instead, flow was blocked by plugs

of salt frozen in flattened sections of certain auxiliary lines. Tempera-
tures in the freeze valves in the fuel and coolant drain lines were con-
trolled so they would thaw in 10 to 15 min when a drain was- requested. The
drain tanks were almost as large as the reactor vessel, but the molten fuel
was safely subcritical because it was undermoderated. Water-cooled bayonet
tubes extended down into thimbles in the drain tanks to remove up to 100 kW
of decay heat if necessary.

The physical arrangement of the equipment is shown in Fig. 1.3. The
reactor and drain tank cells are connected by a large duct, so they form a
single containment vessel. The tops of the two cells consist of two layers
of concrete blocks, with a weld-sealed stainless steel sheet between the
layers; the top layer .is fastened down. The reactor and drain tank cell
were kept at -2 psig during operation. A small bleed of nitrogen into the
cell kept the oxygen content at. 37% to preclude fire if fuel pump lubri-
cating oil should spill on hot surfaces. A water-cooled shield around the
reactor vessel absorbed most of the escaping neutron and gamma-ray energy.
The 5-in. salt piping in the reactor cell included flanges that would per-
mit removal of the fuel pump or the heat exchanger. The flanges were made
unusually large and were left uninsulated so that salt would freeze be-
tween the faces.

All the components in the reactor and drain tank cells were designed
and laid out so they could be removed by the use of long-handled tools from
above, When maintenance was to be done, the fuel was secured in a drain
tank and the connecting lines frozen. The upper layer of blocks was re-
moved and a hole cut in the membrane over the item to be worked on; after
a steel work shield (the portable maintenance shield) consisting of two
parts was set in place, a lower block was removed. Then the two parts of
this portable maintenance shield were moved together, and the hole, caused
by the removal of the lower block, was covered. Through 5-in..diam holes

in the portable maintenance shield, one could then work remotely in the re-

actor cell.

The conventional instrumentation and control systems for the reactor
were augmented by a digital computer that was used to log data and help
analyze the operation. About 280 analog signals from the reactor were
wired to the computer.

Construction of the primary system components for the MSRE started in
1962, and installation of the salt systems was completed in mid-1964. Pre-
nuclear tests, in which first flush salt and then fuel carrier salt con-
taining no uranium were circulated more than 1000 hr, showed that all sys-

23% was then added to the carrier salt as the

tems worked well. Enriched
UF,-LiF eutectic (61 wt 7% U) and on June 1, 1965, criticality was achieved.
In May 1966, the full power of 7.3 MW was reached.

The shutdown in March 1968 was the end of nuclear operation with 23°U.
Sufficient 2??°U had become available, and plans had been made to substitute
it for the 2%3U in the MSRE fuel to measure directly some nuclear charac-
teristics of great importance to the molten-salt breeder design. After
shakedown of the processing equipment, the flush salt and the fuel salt
were fluorinated to recover the 218 kg of uranium in them. Uranium-233
was then loaded into the stripped fuel carrier salt, and criticality was
attained in October 1968, after the addition of 33 kg of uranium (91% 2331),
Nuclear operation with 2°2U fuel continued until December 1969, when after

4 1/2 years of successful operation, the reactor was shut down for the last

. 4
time.

2, OBJECTIVES OF THIS GAMMA-RAY SPECTROMETRY STUDY

The operation of the MSRE demonstrated that a mixture of fluoride
salts is stable under reactor conditions and that the majority of the fis-
sion products remain with the circulating fuel salt; however, some fission
products are found on the moderator graphite in the core, on the metal sur-
faces exposed to the salt, and in the reactor off-gas system. For example,
some elements (Mo, Nb, Ru, Te, and Sh) appear to exist in the metallic
state and tend to plate out on surfaces in contact with the salt or to be
carried into the off-gas system as particles.

The behavior of certain fission products, especially those that vola-
tilize or deposit, is of interest for several reasons in a molten-salt
system.

1. The reactor chemists, of course, seek to understand the chemistry
of the fission products in the salt.

2, The shielding required in remote maintenance of reactor components is
strongly influenced by the total amount of highly active fission prod-
ucts deposited in those components.

3. The deposited fission products may represent several megawatts of de-
cay heat, creating a cooling problem after reactor shutdown and drain
in a large, high-power molten-salt reactor.

4, Fission products that concentrate in the core by deposition on graphite
would absorb more neutrons and hence reduce the breeding performance
of a molten-salt reactor.

For these reasons a comprehensive program of studies of fission product
behavior in the MSRE was undertaken. The objective of the study described
in this report was to determine the identity and magnitude of radioactive
fission product deposits in certain MSRE components using the technique of
remote gamma-ray spectrometry. Particular attention was directed to the
reactor off-gas system and the heat exchanger, the latter because it con-
tained approximately 40% of the metal surfaces exposed to the circulating

fuel salt. The deposition on graphite and metal in the core and in the
12

pump bowl is being studied by others and is discussed in other reports.”

This report presents the results of the remote gamma-ray spectrometry in
a readily usable form with some interpretations that may be useful in the
overall effort of understanding the behavior of fission products in the

MSRE.

3. DESCRIPTION AND PERFORMANCE OF EQUIPMENT

3.1 Background

The equipment that was used to obtain the data in this report (de-
scribed below) was developed over a two-year period.

In 1967 Blumberg, Mauney, and Scott? began to study devices for lo-
cating and evaluating amounts of radioactive materials in high-radiation-
background areas. During a shutdown of the MSRE in May 1967, they mapped
the intensity of radiation coming from the fuel heat exchanger using a
gamma-ray dosimeter mounted over a collimator in the portable maintenance
shield. During the same shutdown a few data on energy spectra were obtained
with a sodium iodide crystal mounted in a lead shield with a collimating
hole. At the end of 23°U operation in March 1968, they made more, better
measurements of gamma spectra by using a different collimator-shield com-
bination, a lithium-drifted germanium diode, and a 400-channel analyzer.'®
The conclusion then was that remote determination of fission product depo-
sition by gamma spectrometry of a collimated beam was feasible and would
provide useful information, but that some improvements should be made in
the equipment. Accordingly, modifications were made with the following
specific objectives:!?

1. ability to position and aim the apparatus at a selected source with
great accuracy,
2. detector resolution good enough to identify individual nuclides among

a multitude,

3. simplified data handling and analysis,

4. collimation adaptable to a wide range of source strengths,

5. provisions for measuring spectra from selected spots during and im-
mediately after power operation,

6. better calibration.

By June 1969 these objectives had largely been met in the equipment de-~

scribed below.

3.2 General Description

As shown in Fig. 1.3, the fuel circulating system and drain tanks are
situated in underground cells which, during operation, were covered by two
layers of concrete beams with a thin stainless steel sheet between the
layers. Gamma radiation levels in the reactor cell were 40,000 to 70,000
R/hr when the reactor was at full power, dropped to 3000 to 5000 R/hr upon
a shutdown and drain, then slowly decreased.'? Gamma radiation in the
drain tank cell ran as high as 25,000 R/hr immediately after a drain.'?
Thus, the situation dictated that any gamma spectrometry measurements would
have to be made from a distance of 10 to 20 ft through apertures in a bio-
logical shield.

Even at the top of the shield, the intensity of the gamma-ray beam
through an opening was quite high. For example, the beam above a 5-in.-
diam hole in the portable maintenance shield, about 14 ft above the primary
heat exchanger, was on the order of 500 R/hr one or two days after a shut-
down and drain. Thus the radiation to the detector had to be reduced by
collimation and sometimes by attenuation through shielding plates as well.
Of course, the collimation of the beam was necessary also to restrict and
locate the source of the gamma rays being analyzed.

Figure 3.1 is a schematic, general view of the ultimate equipment,
consisting of a collimator, a detector, and a laser alignment device.
Figure 3.2 is a front view of the equipment. In these illustrations the
equipment is mounted on the portable maintenance shield, but it could also
be mounted over small holes drilled through the concrete shield blocks
especially for this purpose. The detector was a Ge(Li) crystal connected
through appropriate amplifiers to a 4096-channel analyzer. This combi-
nation provided the high-resolution capability that was necessary. Dif-

ferent collimator inserts could be used, depending on the intensity of the

gamma radiation. When the equipment was used with the portable mainte-
nance shield (PMS), the location from which the detected radiation was
coming could be seen by shining the low-energy laser beam down through the
collimator and looking through a lead-glass shielding window in the PMS.
The precise location of the beam could be determined with a pair of sur-

veyor's transits set up on the floor beside the reactor cell.

3.3 Detector and Amplifier

 

The detector was a coaxial, lithium-drifted germanium detector
mounted on a specially extended arm at a right angle to the cryostat. The
manufacturer, ORTEC, measured a total resolution of 1.78 keV FWHM at 1333
keV at the time of delivery. The detector was 36.65 mm in diameter by
28.5 mm long with a total active volume of 26.25 cm®. The peak-to-Compton
ratio was 27/1. The measured efficiency (the ratio of the area under the
1333-keV photopeak recorded with this detector to the comparable area re-
corded with a 3- by 3-in. Nal crystal, with 25 cm between the source to the
detector) was 4.3%. Most of the experiments were done with an ORTEC-440A
or ORTEC~450 amplifier, both of which were adequate and posed no problems.

Although the collimated beam to the detector was very intense, it ac-
tually interacted with only a very small portion of the total germanium
crystal. Although some 1400 spectra were taken in a period of six months
under far from ideal conditions, it did not appear that the system reso-

lution deteriorated appreciably during the rugged handling.

3.4 Analyzer

A Nuclear Data 2200 series, 4096-channel, analyzer was used. All
spectra were recorded on magnetic tape. Initially several problems were
encountered in operating the analyzer and tape unit, partly due to "bugs"
in this new system. Other problems appeared to be connected with the fact
that the analyzer was initially located in a quite hot and very humid area
and had to be shut down frequently for experimental reasons.

Once the analyzer and amplifier were placed in an air-conditioned,
humidity-~controlled room and left on power continuously, most of the prob-

lems disappeared. This move necessitated a 200-ft cable between the
18

detector preamplifier in the reactor high-bay area and the amplifier lo-
cated near the analyzer; the long cable did not noticeably influence the
system performance. System gain shifts, sometimes of several channels,
seemed to a certain degree dependent on local power conditions (voltage
and possible frequency variations). We accepted this fate and had no op-
portunity to investigate this dependence. This high-resolution detector
and 4096-channel analyzer combination performed satisfactorily. However,
when the reactor was at power the cacophony of gamma rays from short-lived
fission products in components such as the primary heat exchanger or reac-
tor off-gas line generally proved too much even for this system; peaks de-
generated into broad conglomerates from several gamma rays. In those cases,
either a fair amount of shielding had to be used between the detector and
the component observed to cut down the radiation level, or such a spectrum

could not be analyzed.

3.5 Collimator Assembly

Figure 3.3 shows the collimator assembly, which consisted of a col-
limator body and a collimator insert. The collimator body, a lead-filled
cylinder 32 1/2 in. high and 19 in. in diameter, had a central hole into
which a collimator insert, also a lead-filled cylinder, could be placed,
Three different, interchangeable collimator inserts having beam holes 1/16,
1/8, and 3/16 in. in diameter, respectively, were available to cope with
the different radiation intensities. Ultimately only the inserts with
1/16~ and 1/8-in. beam holes were used to collect data. The inserts were
12 in. long and 3 7/8 in. in diameter. The straightness of the beam holes
in the inserts proved to be a manufacturing problem since drilling of such
small holes over a 12-in. length is almost impossible. Reasonably straight
holes were obtained by placing thick-walled stainless steel precision tubes
of 1/16, 1/8, and 3/16 in. inside diameter in the collimator inserts and
then filling the inserts with lead.

The detector and Dewar bottle were mounted on a platform attached to
the collimator body. They could be moved on this platform with an adjusting
screw to ensure that the detector was always at the same location over the

collimator beam hole. The laser was fixed to the collimator insert with a

small jig in such a way that the laser beam could be adjusted to shine
through the middle of the collimator beam hole. For the laser to shine
through the collimator hole, it was necessary to get the detector out of

the way by moving the detector and Dewar backward on the platform with the
adjusting screw. It would have been easy to guide the laser beam around
the detector into the collimator beam hole with some sort of a mirror sys-
tem, but it was thought that the anticipated rough handling of the detector,
laser, and collimator assembly in moving it from place to place would not
permit this extra complication. The collimator insert and laser (in fact,

one subassembly) could easily be taken out and replaced or adjusted.

3.6 Setup of Experimental Equipment

Several days were required after reactor shutdown to remove the upper
shield blocks and the containment membrane, set up the PMS and the spec-
trometry equipment, and start a survey. For this reason, it was decided
to drill holes through the upper and lower shield plugs at three different
locations in the shielding so that the spectrometer could be used while the
reactor shield plugs were still in place. The three locations chosen were:
one over the reactor system off-gas line, one over the primary heat ex-
changer, and one over a drain tank. The holes were drilled during the
June—August 1969 reactor shutdown period. The alignment of the holes in
the upper and lower shield plugs was done with surveyor's transits. Of
course, the containment membrane between the layers of shield blocks in
both the reactor cell and drain tank cells remained intact. This setup,
with the collimator assembly and detector placed on top of the upper shield
blocks, was very useful for taking gamma-ray spectra during and immediately
after reactor shutdown; it also gave us an opportunity to study the shorter-
lived isotopes, at least at these three locations.

We used the PMS to survey the fission product activities along the

3

heat exchanger axis, the fuel lines, and the off-gas line.‘ By placing

the collimator assembly and detector over one of the holes in the rotating

21

work plug of the shield, we could survey 35 in. of the heat exchanger with
one setup. Figure 3.4 shows the general arrangement. By placing the PMS
over any group of two adjacent lower shield plugs, we could survey large
areas in the reactor cell. The collimator assembly and detector were placed
on a large axial bearing so that the assembly could be turned freely on the

PMS. This proved to be very useful for locational purposes.

3.7 Locational Equipment

It was important to know precisely the locations on the different com-
ponents from which gamma-ray spectra were taken. A low-power laser and two
surveyor's transits were used for this purpose. The laser was mounted in
the previously mentioned adjustable jig which could be attached to any of
the collimator inserts. The laser beam coming through the center of the
collimator hole and falling on the reactor component surveyed would then
accurately indicate the center of the spot from which a gamma-ray spectrum
was taken. The red laser "dot" could be observed very easily through a
lead-glass shielding window in the PMS (even on a 1/2-in. line some 15 ft
away). Through previous calibration with a plumb line and an adjustable
bubble level on the collimator body, we could ensure that the laser beam
was perfectly vertical, With the surveyor's transits, placed in the re-
actor high-bay area, it was then possible to locate the vertical laser beam
and hence the spot examined on the reactor component. This rather simple

system proved to be accurate within a fraction of 1 in.

3.8 Shielding

As already mentioned, the radiation intensity from several components
was rather high. With the reactor at power, the radiation levels from the
holes in the concrete shield plugs over the reactor off-gas line and heat
exchanger were more than 1000 R/hr. An important dose due to fast and
thermal neutrons was also detected. (Except when spectrometry data were
being taken, the holes were plugged and covered with lead bricks.)

With the reactor at full power, it proved to be impossible to take

meaningful spectra through the hole over the heat exchanger. So many

fission product nuclides appeared in the circulating fuel salt that among
the great multitude of photopeaks present in these spectra, many coincided
to form meaningless, large conglomerate peaks. These spectra could not be
analyzed by our computer program for spectrum analysis. The off-gas con-
tained fewer different nuclides than did the fuel salt, but even so, spectra
taken with the reactor at full power through the hole over the off-gas line
were on the borderline. A liberal use of shielding material, such as 2 in,
of lithium-impregnated paraffin and 1 in. of copper, was necessary to render
those off-gas-line spectra analyzable. (Lithium-impregnated paraffin was
used since it absorbs neutrons without emitting capture gamma rays.)

With the reactor at low power or right after shutdown from high power,
we were able to analyze spectra from both the heat exchanger and the off-
gas line. Still a heavy amount of shielding was necessary to keep the
count rate from the detector within reasonable limits, 3000 to 10,000
counts/sec.

A problem encountered was that many good shielding materials, such as
lead, attenuate low-energy gamma rays (energies of a few hundred keV or
lower) too strongly when enough shielding is used to obtain the desired
degree of attenuation for the higher energy photons. Thus low-energy peaks
could be entirely wiped out under such conditions. Because materials of
low atomic number do not show such a strong shielding effect at low ener-
gies, this problem was largely overcome by using shields made of aluminum
and/or copper. Thus the count rate could usually be kept at a desired
level while allowing measurement of the lower energy photons. Chapter 5,
concerning calibration of the equipment, will show in more detail the prob-
lems encountered.

In general, we tried to operate the system at a dead time of 25% or
less using a minimum of shielding material and the 1/16-in. collimator

insert.
24

3.9 Calibration Setup

The detector system efficiency was determined empirically, since the
geometry, especially of the primary heat exchanger, was thought to be too
complex to ensure adequate precision from theoretical calculations. The
complete calibration procedure is given in Chapter 5. A subsequent check
of this calibration using simplified calculational models is described in
Appendix D.

Figure 3.5 shows the physical setup for the calibration experiments.
The detector, with a collimator, was installed in one of the underground
cells (the decontamination cell) in the reactor high-bay area. A mockup
of a complete section of the primary heat exchanger with a radiation source
tube was located in the adjacent remote-maintenance-practice cell. Radi-
ation from the source tube positioned in the heat exchanger mockup passed
through a specially drilled hole in the wall between the two cells and the
collimator and then interacted with the detector. The wall between the
cells was thick enough to eliminate any radiation at the detector except
that coming through the collimator. The remote~-maintenance cell was closed
off with the regular roof plugs, except for the area directly above the
heat exchanger mockup; the PMS was used here. Through holes in the PMS,
we could then manipulate the source and the dummy heat exchanger tubes in
the mockup with a simple tool.

A 24-Ci **°"Ag source was used for the calibration experiment. This
source, activated by irradiation in the Oak Ridge Research Reactor, was
6.3 in. long and 1/2 in. in diameter. (It should be remembered that the
real heat exchanger tubes also have a diameter of 1/2 in.)

By placing this source tube in each of the heat exchanger tube po-
sitions, with dummy tubes in all the other heat exchanger tube positions,
we measured the influence of radiation from every one of these tubes on
the detector. The addition of the readings from all the heat exchanger
tube positions gave the detector response that would have been produced by
a heat exchanger completely loaded with activated *'°7Ag tubes. The dis-

tance between the heat exchanger mockup and the detector was made the same

as the average distance between the detector placed on the PMS and the
actual primary heat exchanger in the reactor cell.

The heat exchanger calibration experiments were done with a dummy
section of the heat exchanger outer shell (1/2 in. llastelloy N) placed be-
tween the tube mockup and the detector. The alignment of the collimator
hole between the source and the detector was again done with the laser rig,
which was mounted on the now horizontally placed collimator insert. The
red laser beam, passing through the collimator insert, was easy to locate
and was aimed at the center of the heat exchanger mockup.

The calibration required for the measurements on the reactor main off-
gas line was less complicated because the portion of the line that was ob-
served was simply a corrugated l-in. tube. It was estimated that the effect
of this corrugated tube in comparison with the source tube would be approxi-
mately the same on the detector.

The ceramic part of a heat exchanger heater, as well as the shielding
plates we used during the actual survey of the heat exchanger and off-gas
line in the reactor cell, were calibrated with the same source to compare
their shielding capabilities with those calculated from literature data.
For this purpose, the ceramic heater was placed close to the heat ex~
changer mockup with the source tube in an unshielded center position. The
shield plates were placed as close as possible to the wall in the remote-
maintenance practice cell in front of the hole. The shielding capabilities
of the different plates as found by these tests agreed well with the values

calculated from literature data.

4, ANALYSIS OF SPECTRA
4,1 Purpose and General Procedure

The purpose of analyzing a gamma-ray spectrum is to identify radio-
active nuclides by their emitted photons and, taking into account the ab-~
solute counting efficiency of the system, to determine the amounts of the
various nuclides present at a given location in a particular reactor com-
ponent.

The counts in each one of the 4096 channels of the analyzer system are
stored in the analyzer memory and, after the end of the counting time,
written on magnetic tape if so requested. Hence, the basic data are counts
assembled in channels. Each channel represents a particular energy interval
whose size can be set more or less at will. We generally used an energy
interval (so-called "gain'") in the range of 0.3 to 1.0 keV per channel. In
other words, we could take a gamma spectrum comprising a range of 1200
(v0.3 x 4096) to 4000 keV (1.0 x 4096). A gamma-ray peak (usually called
a photopeak or full-energy peak) would identify itself in such a spectrum
as an increase in accumulated counts in several adjacent channels. Experi-
ments have shown that such a photopeak has essentially the form of a modi-
fied gaussian curve. The intensity of a photopeak is determined from the
height of, or more precisely from the area under, such a gaussian curve.
The energy of the gamma ray is determined from the location of the gaussian
curve in the spectrum, that is, the channel in which the top of the gaus-
sian curve falls.

The analysis of a recorded gamma-ray spectrum containing several photo-
peaks proceeds through the following basic steps:

1. Locate the peaks in the spectrum.
2. Determine for each peak if it is just a statistical fluctuation or

a real photopeak and determine a beginning and end of each peak.
3. Determine the background from adjacent channels for each peak.

4, Fit a gaussian curve to the net counts in those channels that form

a peak.
28

5. Calculate the area under the peak as a measure of the gamma-ray
intensity, subtract the background (above) from this area, and de-
termine the location of the top of the gaussian curve to assign an
energy to that peak.

6. Examine the spectrum peak by peak to determine the nuclides responsi-
ble for the observed spectrum; a search is made through an energy 1li-
brary to find those isotopes that might emit gamma rays within the
range of each energy peak.

7. Select the nuclide most likely to be the one responsible for the peak
in question. Each peak is subjected to several tests before it can
really be associated with a certain isotope. These tests include
half-life, presence of associated gamma rays and their relative in-
tensities, and presence of precursor and daughter nuclides.

8. Once a peak is thus identified, calculate from the area under the peak
how much of the particular isotope is present.

A requirement for such a spectrum evaluation is that the efficiency of
the detector system as a function of photon energy, that is, the ratio be-
tween the counts detected and the gamma rays emitted, must be well known
for the energy range considered. Also, the relationship between gamma
energy and channel number must be determined to evaluate the energy of the

peaks accurately. A typical spectrum is given in Fig. 4.1.

4,2 Problems

Because most of our spectra were taken relatively soon after reactor
shutdown, many short-lived isotopes were still present. This resulted in
a large array of photopeaks, many of which overlapped each other. This
means that several single photopeaks (singlets) would conglomerate (multi-
plets); the analysis of these multiplets poses an entirely new dimension
to the analysis of a spectrum. For example, the beginning and end of any
one peak in a multiplet is very difficult to determine, as is the subtrac-
tion of the background from this multiplet. Basically, a few gaussian

curves have to be shifted back and forth so as to fit a multiplet.

The identification of isotopes by their emitted gamma rays is rela-
tively easy if one has an extensive, accurate library of gamma-ray energies
and branching ratios. The gamma rays of longer-lived isotopes are well
known, but the shorter-lived ones are not and their descriptive data are
scarce.

As implied above, it is a difficult task to analyze one spectrum com-
pletely, especially if it has to be done manually. If, as in our case,
approximately 1400 spectra have to be analyzed, it becomes obvious that a
computerized analysis is necessary. However, a computer program to handle
our rather complicated spectra was not readily available, and it would have

been too time consuming to have one written.

4.3 Table of Isotopes

Considerable effort was expended in setting up a library of isotopic
data. This library is probably fairly unique in that it contains both
short- and long-lived fission product data and is taken from the latest
references collected by the ORNL Nuclear Data Project. Gamma-ray energies
and branching ratios are listed per nuclide as well as in order of in-
creasing energy. Absolute gamma-ray abundances, as well as precursors and
decay products, are also given. Use of this table proved to be a major
improvement in the analysis of our spectra. It should be emphasized that
the entire analysis of our data is based on this table of isotopes. The
basic isotope table is given in Appendix A.

As an example of possible errors, we might mention the problems en-
countered with the analysis of the 129MTe data. First, this nuclide decays

129

partly to the ground state (*?°Te) and then to I or directly from the

isomeric state to '2°I. In both cases, the abundance of emitted gamma rays
is very small.

This means any statistical error in the original photopeak analysis is
amplified by a large factor for the activity calculation. Even more dis-

turbing is the fact that the whole '?°"Te-!??

Te decay scheme is not com-
pletely agreed upon; a literature survey yielded several different decay

schemes. Because the second largest photopeak (696.0 keV) observed in the
31

decay of '*°"Te coincides with photopeaks of other nuclides, we had to rely
only on the results yielded by the 459.6-keV peak.

Based on the latest available data, we estimated that the decay of
12%MTe to the ground state '?°Te and subsequently to '2®°I would produce a
gamma ray at 459.6 keV with an abundance of 4.9%. Should better data be=-
come available, the results presented later on should be corrected propor-
tionately. The abundance of the 459.6~keV photopeak for the decay of *2°Te

itself to **°I is estimated to be 7.7%.

4.4 Computer Programs

As already mentioned, computerized data handling was imperative for
the proper analysis of this experiment. The principal problem was where
to find a computer program that would analyze our spectra with their multi-
tudes of singlet and multiplet peaks. As an indication of the complexity,
it should be emphasized that we commonly had 150 to 230 peaks per spectrum.

The ORNL Mathematics Division had developed an effective gamma-ray
spectrum analysis program, GAMSPEC-3, which was operational but did not yet
have provisions for analyzing multiple peaks. The program was also limited
to the analysis of 75 single peaks per spectrum and would not identify nu-
clides. These limitations eliminated this program for the analysis of most
of our spectra, especially those still containing many photopeaks from
short-lived isotopes. Gunnink et al.,'® among others, had developed a
versatile gamma-ray spectrum analysis program, GAMANAL, which seemed to
suit our purposes. This program had been written in a Lawrence Radiation
Laboratory (LRL) version of FORTRAN for a CDC 6600 computer and had been
converted to FORTRAN-IV and made compatible with the IBM 360 series of com-
puters by N. D. Dudey et al., of Argonne National Laboratory. Through a
concerted effort of the ORNL Mathematics Division, the program was made

compatible with the ORNL computers. As an indication of the complexity of

 

'“R. Gunnink et al., Identification and Determination of Gamma
Emitters by Computer Analysis of Ge(Li) Spectra, LRL-UCID-15140.
32

the program, it might be mentioned that it took LRL close to five man-years
to write this program, ANL close to two years to make it compatible with
the IBM 360 computers, and ORNL some four months to get it running here,

This program will locate peaks (singlets, doublets, and triplets) and
identify and calculate the amounts of nuclides responsible for the peaks.
It can handle 400 singlet peaks, 100 doublets, and 100 triplets. Although
the basic program was originated by Gunnink et al., we made some modifi-
cations to it and supplied our own library of isotope data. For example,
the original program read in the efficiency of the whole detector system
as a function of energy as coefficients of a polynomial equation. This was
modified to have the program interpolate efficiency values from a set of
data that represented the efficiency curve itself. Normally we supplied
approximately 60 points on this efficiency curve. It was also changed to
permit a larger choice in output of different tables in order to reduce the
paper output.

Although this program worked satisfactorily for most of our spectra,
some problems remained, as follows.

1. In some specific energy ranges, many peaks appeared in multiplets.
Since the program would only analyze up to triplets, it was obvious that a
conglomerate of five or six peaks could not be properly analyzed.

2, The storage possibility of 100 doublets and 100 triplets some-
times was inadequate for spectra that contained many short-lived isotopes.
Such a spectrum would then be rejected.

3. It was only exceptional that all the nuclides of a particular de-
cay chain were deposited. When the program then went through the different
identification tests, it would sometimes fail to find the precursor or
daughter products and hence reject an identification. The only way out was
then to uncouple the parent-daughter relation in the energy library. For
example, in chain 95, ®°Zr remained with the fuel salt while ®3Nb tended to
plate out. The program would not identify ®°Nb as long as ®3Zr was coupled
to it as its precursor. Of course, this had nothing to do with the per-

formance of the program itself.
33

5. CALIBRATION
5.1 General

The equipment was calibrated to determine the absolute efficiency of
the whole gamma-ray detection system, taking into account the collimator
assembly and the physical arrangement of the equipment in the reactor cell.

The counting efficiency as used in our empirical method is merely a
proportionality constant relating photopeak count rate and source inten-

sity, viz.,

CR = EF +S, (1)

where CR is the count rate, EF is the efficiency, and S is the source in-
tensity expressed as photons per unit of source dimension and per unit
time, It should be noted that even though CR is determined by photons from
the total radicactive object subtended by the collimator, the source
strength can be expressed as any convenient fraction or multiple of the
total object. For example, in the case of the heat exchanger (see Sect.
5.5), count rates that corresponded to the collimator subtending a conical
section of the heat exchanger full of radioactive tubes were obtained. The
source strength, however, was taken as those photons emitted per unit time
per square centimeter of a single tube. Thus the counting efficiency is
expressed as

e CR(counts/min)
5 = — @
Y/cm 5( Y )

EF(

 

cm? — min

where y denotes an emitted photon and ¢ a count registered in the photopeak.
When a count rate measured over the heat exchanger was divided by this ef-
ficiency, the result was the photon emission rate per square centimeter of
tubing in the heat exchanger. In the case of the reactor main off-gas line,
the source strength was expressed in units of photons emitted per inch of

tubing per minute (y/in.-min), causing the efficiency to have the units

energy of the incoming gamma rays. Basically, there are two ways to de-

 

The efficiency of any system of this kind is dependent on the

termine the relationship between efficiency and energy. One could estab-
lish this efficiency curve by measuring first the detector efficiency in

a simple geometry with several different known sources and then discount
the effects of collimation, distance, shielding, and geometry for an actual
component to be surveyed. The other way would be to establish empirically
the efficiency of the system in the actual physical setup. We chose the
second path because it appeared to be somewhat simpler and more reliable.
However, we also performed our analysis using the more basic approach to
check the validity of the calibration (see Appendix D).

All gamma spectra taken from July to September 1969 were obtained with
the ORTEC-440A amplifier. During our calibration experiments, we changed to
the ORTEC-450 amplifier. Because it was not known at that particular time
what the influence would be on the resolution of the system, it was decided
to do a fair amount of the calibration work in duplicate using both ampli-

fiers.

5.2 Source

In order to simulate the actual conditions as much as possible, we
chose a 1/2-in.-0D silver source tube that was equivalent in diameter to
the primary heat exchanger tubes.

Silver was chosen because ''°"Ag has several gamma rays between 446.8
and 1562.2 keV and thus yields data over a sizable part of the energy range
for the efficiency curve. Furthermore, it was rather inexpensive to prepare
such a source by using the hydraulic-tube irradiation facilities of the ORR.
Because of the large effect of the silver tubing on the reactivity of the
ORR, only 2.3 in. of tubing could be irradiated in a single hydraulic tube;
so three pieces of silver tubing of this length were irradiated, each in
separate hydraulic tubes. Flux monitors (Co-Al foils) were first irradiated
to determine the flux gradients and total flux in the hydraulic tubes and
provide a basis for the silver irradiations. The assembly of our source

tube was done in the hot cells of the ORNL Isotopes Division and consisted
35

in putting the three silver tubes together in one thin-walled stainless-
steel container and seal welding it (Fig. 5.1). Appendix B reports in more
detail the calculations done concerning the source strength as well as the

activity gradient along the length of the source.

5.3 ©Slit Experiment — Source Strength

Because of the neutron flux distribution in the ORR, it was inevitable
that there was some activity gradient along the source tube. It was neces-
sary to know this gradient to properly calibrate the detector system.
Originally we planned to deduce the level of *'°"Ag radioactivity at any
point on the tube from the measured activity values and the activation
gradients obtained from the flux monitors (Table B.2 and B.4 of App. B).
However, this procedure has many uncertainties. A much better procedure,
and one that was followed, was to scan the source with a collimator ar-
rangement using the Ge(Li) detector and 4096-channel analyzer. A slit
shield, set up in the remote-maintenance practice cell at the MSRE, con-
sisted of stacked lead bricks to a height of about 2 ft. An air-gap slit
1/8 by 1 in. wide was formed in the brick stack by using 1/8-in. lead
spacers; a glass tube large enough to accept the source was attached verti-
cally to the brick stack over the air gap. The Ge(Li) detector was placed
in the adjoining decontamination cell in front of the hole drilled through
the concrete wall. When the source was placed in the glass tube, gamma
rays from a 1/8-in, section of the silver tube could pass through the slit,
the hole between the cells, and the collimator to strike the detector.
Scanning was begun by lowering the source below the slit and then gradually
raising it until the detector signaled that the top of the source was in
front of the slit.

The scan was made by moving the source upward and obtaining gamma
spectra at 1/8-in. increments until the entire source had been moved past
the slit. A profile of the source intensity was obtained by resolving the
gamma spectra and plotting net counts of photopeak areas versus distance
along the source (see Fig. 5.2). From these results we could then calculate

the absolute activity at any point along the entire length of the source

tube (App. B).

Because the activity profile of the silver source tube was not com-
pletely uniform and the collimator subtended a significant portion of the
tube, an average value of the source strength as viewed by the system was

needed. The average source strength, S can be expressed as

L
| s(x) R(x) dx
5 = (3)
L
[| Rx) dx
0

where [ is the length of the tube, S(x) is the source strength at point x,
and R(x) is a weighting function equivalent to the radial counting effici-
ency (sensitivity response to a point source as a function of distance from
the source-to-collimator axis). Since the source strength S(x) and the
count rate CR(x) found in the slit experiment are linearly related, we

can write

L
k [ CR(x) R(x) dx
§ = — 4)
L
[ R(x) dx
0

where k is a proportionality constant relating S(x) and CR(x). Note that
k is the reciprocal of the counting efficiency for the source in the slit

experiment configuration and has the units of (y/in.)/c. We can now write

L
_ I CR(z) R(x) dx
= S
FR = 2 2 ooo (5)
k L
[ R(x) du
0

where CR is the average count rate for each of the gamma rays for the total

source tube,
39

In determining the weighting function R(x), we assumed that the col~
limator-detector assembly had rotational symmetry; that is, only radial
displacement from the collimator axis was considered. (This assumption
required that the collimator hole be perfectly straight, which seemed rea-
sonable, at least for the 1/8-in. collimator.)

From the calibration work in the heat exchanger mockup (see Sect. 5.5),
we were able to measure the contribution to count rate at the detector from
sources to the right and left of the collimator axis. Figure 5.3 is a nor-
malized plot of the detector sensitivity to the silver source tube at var-
ious distances from the axis. This figure was made up as follows: For
three different ''°"Ag photon energies, the net count rates were added for
all the source tube positions in each column of tubes in the heat exchanger
mockup (parallel to the collimator axis, Fig. 3.5). The reason for summing
the readings of an entire column was to obtain a more uniform source dis-
tribution as well as better counting statistics. This count-rate distri-
bution across the mockup was then normalized to a central value of unity
for each of the three photopeak energies and corrected for a slight mis-
alignment of the collimator. Figure 5.3 is the average of the three nor-
malized curves; their deviation from this average was encouraging small,
The figure also represents the required weighting factor R(x). By multi-
plying the count rates along the source tube, as measured by the slit ex-
periment (Fig. 5.2), in the appropriate way with the normalized count-~rate
distribution as seen by the detector (Fig. 5.3), the result is the effective
activity of the entire source tube as seen by the actual detecting system
(Fig. 5.4). The average weighted count rate of the source tube for the
three energies considered is the area under each of the curves on Fig. 5.4
divided by the area under the normalized curve (Fig. 5.3). For the three

energies we find the following average weighted count rates:

 

Ener (keV Count rate (counts/min)
657.7 27,500
884.7 24,300
937.5 13,600

Since we now know the average count rates for the unshielded total

tube for three of the gamma rays of the source, we need only calculate the

value of k to determine the average source strength. The value of k can
be determined from the expression
Sx

ol
where S(x) and CR(x) denote the source strength in curies per inch and
counts per minute, respectively, at point x on the tube as determined by
the slit experiment. The subscript 7 denotes the ith gamma and accounts
for the variation of k (a slit~experiment counting efficiency) with energy
and the fact that the three gamma rays measured each have different branch-
ing ratios (photons emitted per 100 disintegrations). Since we know the
source strength at two positions (see Fig. 5.2 and App. B), we can use the
results of the slit experiment to obtain the value of kX at two positions

for each of the three gamma rays as shown in Table 5.1.

We have listed the count rates and values computed for k for each of
the gamma rays for both "known' positions of the source tube. In addition,
we have listed for each of the gamma rays the average value of k for the
two positions of the tube. Three values of the average source strength
were then calculated by multiplying these averaged k values times the cor-
responding averaged count rates for the three gamma rays given above. The

results of these calculations are:
43

 

Ener keV Source strength (Ci/in.)
657.7 4.09
884.7 4.07
937.5 4,00

From these results an overall average source strength was computed to be
4,05 Ci per inch of tube on June 1, 1969.

This source evaluation method leaves something to be desired and is to
a certain degree misleading because we used an essentially plane source
(source placed in all heat exchanger mockup positions) to evaluate the
weighting factor of a line source, However, since the normalized weighting
curve (Fig. 5.3) is quite steep and the source activity gradient in the
central portion of the source rather flat, the method should be acceptable.
Taking into account the errors of the radiochemical source-strength evalu-
ation and the weighting-factor evaluation, we estimate an error of #5% in

the source-strength computation.
5.4 Single Source Experiments

A single source experiment was performed to determine the efficiency
of the detector system for gamma rays coming from the main reactor off-gas
line. We .assumed that the detector system would have the same counting
efficiency for the ''°"Ag source tube as for the corrugated l-in.-ID main
off-gas line. The source tube was set up in an unshielded central position
of the heat exchanger mockup, and the collimator was aligned with the laser.
Minor collimator adjustments were made to cope with any misalignment by
searching for the maximum count rate for this setup. The distance between
the source tube and the detector was approximately equal to the distance
between the actual detector-collimator assembly on the PMS and the main
reactor off-gas line (line 522) in the reactor cell. Four spectra were
taken for this setup with the 440A amplifier and six with the 450. The
difference in response was small and judged to be due to statistical error.
A 1/8-in. collimator insert was used.

By taking into account the data of this experiment and the absolute
abundance of the different gamma peaks (15 photopeaks of *'°"Ag), we were

able to calculate the detector-system efficiency at all these different
44

photon energies. This way we established an absolute efficiency curve from
the lowest ''°"Ag peak energy at 446.8 keV to the highest at 1562.2 keV.
The problem was to extend this curve beyond these limits, because many fis-
sion products have important photopeaks outside this energy range. It was
decided to use the actual fission product spectra taken from the off-gas
line for the extension of the efficiency curve. For example, with °°Mo,
1317, 21, and **°La, it would be possible to establish a relative effici-
ency curve all the way from 140 up to 2522 keV. By linking this wide-
energy-range relative efficiency curve to the already established absolute
curve from ''°7Ag, an absolute efficiency curve was obtained. It was very
encouraging to see that the relative curve from the fission products and
the absolute curve were almost identical in shape in the 450- to 1560-keV
range. Figure 5.5 is the efficiency curve adopted for the main reactor
off-gas line (line 522).

As a check on the above approach, we used also a 22°

Ra source, which
emits photons over a wide energy range. The relative efficiency curve for
that source was essentially identical in shape with the established abso-
lute curve. The discrepancies, especially in the lower energy range, were
probably due to a different shielding of the actual photon emitter (for the
1-in.-ID off-gas line, this would be the wall thickness of the pipe).

5.5 Heat Exchanger Calibration

The heat exchanger calibration was done with a full-size mockup of a
complete section of the heat exchanger. The 8 1/2-in.-long dummy tube sec-
tions had the same outside diameter and wall thickness as the actual heat
exchanger tubes. In the mockup the tubes were held vertical and kept at
the specified triangular pitch of 0.775 in. by two horizontal grid plates
approximately 6 in. apart. With a simple tool it was easy to handle these
tubes from above through a work hole in the portable maintenance shield.
The mockup contained 20 rows of tubes (transverse to the detector-collimator
axis). Because of the triangular pitch, each row contained either nine or
eight tubes. A curved 1/2-in. stainless steel plate was placed in the
proper geometry in front of the mockup to simulate the heat exchanger

shell.

Spectra were taken with the source tube placed in each of the tube
positions and dummy tubes in all the other positions. This procedure was
done twice, once with the 440A amplifier and once with the 450; the 1/8-in.
collimator insert was used. Some spectra were taken with the 1/16-in. col-
limator, but a full calibration was not performed.

By adding the count rates for each of the different L1OMp photopeaks
from the spectra of all the source positions in the mockup, a count rate
was obtained that represented the primary heat exchanger with an activity
of 4.06 Ci of ''°™Ag per inch on each tube, but with the internal shielding
of all the other heat exchanger tubes. By taking into account the data of
the experiment and the absolute abundances of the various 119MAs gamma rays,
we could establish an absolute efficiency curve applicable to the heat ex-~
changer for the energy range from 446.8 to 1562.2 keV. Again, there was
very little difference between the data obtained with the two different
amplifiers; we used the average of the two efficiency curves as our
standard.

Actual fission product data from the primary heat exchanger were used
to extend the energy range of the efficiency curve; we used the photopeaks
of °°Mo, '*'1, '®21I, and, to a lesser degree, '“°La (because very little
14913 was present in the empty heat exchanger). The shielding effect of
a heater element was measured and also calculated separately. The final
standard efficiency curve for the heat exchanger, including the heat ex-
changer shell and the heater box effects, is given in Fig. 5.6. It should
be noted that this curve, contrary to that for the off-gas line, bends down
at lower energies. The efficiency decrease at low energy was caused by the
internal shielding of the heat exchanger; hence the strong increase in the
photon attenuation coefficient with decreasing photon energy. This down-
ward trend with decreasing energy proved to be a problem in the initial
use of the computer program (see Chap. 4.4).

The above calibration procedure does not take into account the effect
of fission products deposited on the inside of the heat exchanger shell.
However, this amount, if comparable with the amounts deposited on the tubes,
would have only a minor influence on the total reading. Another limitation

was that the calibration would be reliable only if the deposition of fission

products were approximately uniform on all the tubes. Although this is
not necessarily true, we had no data to justify any other approximation.
As a check on our empirical efficiency calibrations, we have computed
from first principles counting efficiencies for both a line source corre-~
sponding to the silver tube and the reactor off-gas line and a volume
source (truncated cone) corresponding to the cone subtended by the colli-
mator in the heat exchanger. These calculations are described in Appendix
D. We believe that the good agreement found between experimental and com~
puted counting efficiencies serves to confirm our measured values and in-

creases our confidence in the validity of our measurements.

5.6 Calibration of Shielding Materials

Throughout the experiments we tried to keep the count rate of the de-
tection system more or less constant in the range 3000 to 10,000 counts/sec.
Since the source strength varied with time and position, we varied the
detection-system efficiency accordingly by interposing different amounts of
shielding material between the source and the detector. In most cases,
disks, 1/2 in. thick and 7 in. in diameter, were placed over the work hole
in the PMS just under the collimator assembly. These disks could be easily
removed to permit use of the laser for location purposes. We used disks of
aluminum, copper, and lithium-impregnated paraffin. With some extremely
high activity levels, we also used some 1l/4-in.-thick plates of lead be-
tween the collimator insert and the detector. Aside from the very incon-
venient tendency for lead to attenuate especially well the lower energy
photons, the proximity of this shielding material to the detector also
caused the detection of lead x rays. In evaluating the influence of the
different shielding materials, we relied not only on the published attenu-
ation coefficients but we also calibrated the disks. We used both the un-

22fRa source for this purpose. Our

shielded silver source as well as the
experimental values agreed well with the literature data for Pb, Cu, Al,
Cd, and steel; we had to rely on experimental values only for the lithium-
impregnated paraffin and the ceramic heat exchanger heater element. So-

called "shielding curves" were made for each of these different shielding
49

materials; these curves were plots of the shielding factors (reciprocals
of the more usual attenuation factors) as functions of energy from 140 to
2500 keV.

Absolute efficiency curves as functions of energy were synthesized
for all the different combinations of shielding material used in the ex-
periments. These were obtained by dividing, point by point, the unshielded
efficiency values by shielding factors appropriate for that shielding com-
bination. When two or more shielding disks were involved, composite

shielding factors were used. That is,

EF (B)
BEB) = —E——
nia, 21"
where
EF _(E) = energy-dependent efficiency with shielding present,
EF (EB) = energy-dependent efficiency without shielding,
A, (BE) = shielding factor for the 7th component of the shield,
v, = number of pieces of component Z used.

Altogether we used 12 different combinations of shielding for the main re-
actor off-gas line and 8 for the heat exchanger (see Tables 5.2 and 5.3).
The values of the efficiency curves generated for these shielding configu-
rations were used as input data to the computer analysis program to evalu-
ate the absolute amounts of nuclides present. The different efficiency
curves are given in Appendix C.

With the reactor system shut down and drained, we used primarily the
simpler cases of shielding with only aluminum or copper. With the reactor
at different power levels, we had to rely on much more shielding because
of the high gamma and neutron radiation levels. Gamma spectra taken at
the same place but at different times after reactor shutdown and recorded
with different shielding configurations yielded generally the same results
for the amounts of nuclides deposited at shutdown time; this gave us a

certain degree of confidence in the absolute efficiency curves used.

Extensive experiments were done to evaluate the effect of the 1/16-in.
collimator insert in relation to the 1/8-in. insert. During the calibra-
tion experiments, we found values appreciably higher than 4 for the decrease
in count rate when the 1/16-in. insert was used; also, there was consid-
erable scatter between individual measurements. It might have been that
this spread was largely due to minor misalignments between the collimator
axis and the center of the silver source tube. Therefore, another experi-
ment was done, this time by placing a lightly activated foil alternately
against the far ends of the 1/8- and 1/16-in. collimator inserts and the
detector placed at the front end. We found a shielding factor of 9.0 for
the 1/16-in. collimator insert in relation to the 1/8-in. insert. This test
was repeated several times, and the experimental values were within *107,

Apparently the 1/16-in. collimator was not all that straight!

5.7 Calibration for Fission Gases in the MSRE

Because our calibration was done in terms of radioactive sources de-
posited on the coolant salt tubes in the heat exchanger, all results ob-
tained by the computer program, including those for gases, were expressed
in this manner. Although this "equivalent surface deposition" for gases
is a valid" mode of expressing their concentrations, it may for certain
purposes be more useful to express their concentrations in terms of free
cross-sectional volume of the heat exchanger. We have estimated the av-
erage ratio of free volume to surface area to be 0.55 cm®/cm®. Thus the
results for gases can be converted to disintegrations per cubic centimeter
per minute by dividing their values in disintegrations per square centi-

meter per minute by 0.55.

 

*
The validity of this mode of expressing gas concentration is easily
seen from the arguments in App. D.
53

6. MEASUREMENTS

Gamma-ray spectra were taken during the period of July 1969 through
December 1969. Altogether some 1400 spectra were recorded from several
different locations (Table 6.1). The purposes of the various sets of

measurements were as follows.

Group A — The reactor system had been drained and shut down since
June 1, 1969. The purpose of these spectra was to test the equipment and,
if possible, to study the deposition of longer-lived fission products.

Group B — During this period the reactor was usually at some power
level ranging from a few kilowatts to full power. By changing the reactor
conditions, such as fuel pump speed, helium purge rate in the fuel pump
bowl, and changing to argon as a purge gas, the concentration of the noble
fission gases was studied; of special interest was, of course, >°Xe.
These spectra were all taken over a hole in the shield plug with the con-
tainment membrane in place and were considered in a separate report.

Group C — Calibration spectra were mainly taken with the 110Mpo source
tube; some were taken with a *2?®Ra source. Details of the calibration work
are described in Chapter 5.

Group D — A few spectra were taken through the shield plug over the
main reactor off-gas line during a beryllium addition to find out if the
noble fission gas concentration changed during and after an addition.
These results were also considered in Ref. 15.

Group E — Several spectra were recorded of the main reactor off-gas
line several hundred feet downstream of the fuel pump bowl. These spectra
were taken at a location where sample bombs of fission gases can be iso-
lated. Physically this location is in the vent house, The connection of
the off-gas line into the main charcoal beds is a few feet downstream from
this point. The purpose was to study the relative noble fission gas con-

centrations at this point.

Group F — From previous experience it was known that it takes at least
a few days from the moment of reactor shutdown and drain until the portable
maintenance shield is set up and operable over the reactor cell. In order
to get some data during this time, spectra were taken over the three holes
(off-gas line, heat exchanger, and drain tank) in the shield plugs. Reactor
shutdown and drain on November 2, 1969, at 1441 hr was initiated by thawing
the drain line freeze valve with the reactor still at full power. It was
judged that this type of drain would leave the maximum fission product de-
position in the system because the time span elapsed between the moment of
fuel drainage of the entire fuel system and full-power operation would be
shortest.

Group G — These are the main spectra taken with the detection equipment
mounted on top of the portable maintenance shield after reactor shutdown.

Group H — Several spectra were taken from the heat exchanger over the
hole in the shield plug. Spectra were recorded during full-power operation
before final shutdown, at shutdown, during draining of the system, and
thereafter.

Group I — Spectra were recorded from samples of the reactor cell air
after final reactor shutdown. These spectra were used in the analysis of
the piping leak that occurred after the shutdown.®®

Group J — Spectra were recorded of the coolant-salt radiator after the
system was drained; the detector was placed in front of the radiator tubes.
The purpose was to find any activated corrosion products that might have
settled in the radiator.

Group K = Spectra were taken by C. H. Gabbard at two places along the
main coolant salt line to study the coolant flow rate by using the decay of
2°F and '°N in the coolant salt; 2°F and '°N are formed in the heat ex-
changer by delayed neutrons from the fuel salt.

Group L — Samples of fuel salt and graphite soaked in fuel salt were
taken from the fuel pump bowl and placed in the sampler enricher. Spectra

were taken by C. H. Gabbard with a special collimator and detector setup.

Group M — Several miscellaneous spectra were recorded, such as from
the lube-oil system, the roughing filters from the containment ventilation
air exhaust, and from the off-gas line of the pump bowl overflow tank (line

The results of the analysis of the different spectra will be reported

7. RESULTS

Presented in this chapter are all results which pertain to the distri-
bution of fission products in the MSRE. Brief mention is made of other
spectra, recorded for different purposes, but their analyses will be dis-
cussed elsewhere.

Results are reported in the order given in Chapter 6. Because of the
large number of spectra, results have been presented, where possible, in
graphic form. In general, all results have been included in the figures,
irrespective of possible experimental errors. Results that are somewhat
uncertain for a particular reason are specifically indicated. Only in very

few cases, because of obvious error, were data omitted.

7.1 Group A Spectra

These spectra were recorded during the July shutdown period and con-
cern the primary heat exchanger, the main off-gas line, and a fuel salt
line.

The shakedown of the equipment proved to be very useful, in that
problems with the analyzer and detector system were resolved; the alignment
and locational equipment, including the laser, proved to be sturdy and
reliable.

Most spectra were taken six or more weeks after reactor shutdown
(June 1, 1969); this implies that only a few longer-lived isotopes might
be expected to be present. The spectra were relatively simple and contained
no multiplets. The system had not been flushed with flush salt.

For nuclides emitting photons at different energies, we used the av-
erage of the computed activities yielded by the most prominent photopeaks
emitted by that nuclide.

The counting time was mostly 200 sec per spectrum. Although '®’Cs
and '“°Ba-La were identified a few times in the heat exchanger, their ac-
tivity level was so small that one might tentatively conclude that they
were deposited as a result of the decay of xenon present in the system

after shutdown and drain. No ®°Zr could be detected. It should be borne
58

in mind that, except where specifically noted, all results in this section
have been extrapolated back to reactor shutdown time by simple exponential
extrapolation, The reason for this extrapolation was to compare results
yielded by spectra taken at different times. This extrapolation might give,
however, an activity value at shutdown time that is too high because of the
decay of a precursor nuclide. For example, the extrapolated value of *°'I
might be too high by a few percent because of the decay of *'"Te. This

will be further discussed in Chapter 8.

7.1.1 Heat exchanger

About 65 spectra were taken along the longitudinal axis of the heat
exchanger. Another 49 were recorded by moving the detector transversely
across the heat exchanger; the transverse scans were taken at four differ-
ent places. Most spectra could be successfully analyzed. The quantitative
interpretation of the transverse-scanning results proved to be rather dif-
ficult, due to the varying shielding condition because of the changing num-
ber of heat exchanger tubes seen by the detector as well as the changing
photon attenuation through the heat exchanger shell. Qualitatively, the
fission product deposition was symmetrical on both sides of the longi-
tudinal axis of the heat exchanger.

The spectra recorded above the heater connector boxes (HTR plug)
proved to be of no use for quantitative interpretation because of the un-
known amount of shielding involved. All these spectra gave results that
were far too low in comparison with the other spectra. Since the "ac-
tivity depressions’ near these boxes all had about the same shape, it was
decided that results from spectra recorded above the heater boxes were
biased because of the boxes and not because of different deposition of fis-
sion products in the heat exchanger. These spectra were discarded. Let
us now turn to the different nuclides identified.

Niobium-95 (Fig, 7.1). The disintegration rate along the longitud-
inal axis ranges approximately between 0.10 and 0.30 x 10** dis/min per
square centimeter of heat exchanger tube. There appears to be an increase
of activity close to the baffle plates in the range of 0.25 to 0.30 x 10'2
dis min™" em” ?. Between the baffle plates, the average activity level is

near 0.10 to 0.15 x 10*? dis min~" cm™®. Since the activity increase is

more pronounced for those baffle plates against the upper side of the shell,
one may conclude that this activity increase is rather localized around the
low flow rate areas near the shell and the baffle. There does not appear

to be any general change in activity along the length of the heat exchanger.

Ruthenium-103 (Fig. 7 2). The disintegration rate (dis min=* cm?

 

along the longitudinal axis follows nearly the same pattern as that for

°SNb: along longitudinal axis, 0.17 to 0.65 x 10*'; near baffle plates,

0.50 to 0.65 x 10°; between baffle plates, 0.17 to 0.24 x 10'?%,
Ruthenium—Rhodium-106 (Fig. 7.3). Ruthenium-106 is basically identi-

 

fied by its short half-life decay product, '°®Rh. The activity distribution
(dis min~' cm™®) is essentially the same as for *°?Ru: along longitudinal
axis, 0.04 to 0.14 x 10‘%; near baffle plates, 0.11 to 0.14 x 10''; between
baffle plates, 0.04 to 0.06 x 10°*.

Antimony-125. This nuclide was detected in small quantities all along
the heat exchanger. The activity level, probably because of the very low
fission yield, was small; the computer program only sporadically found
peaks that could be assigned to '2°Sb, Variation of the activity level
along the longitudinal axis was 0.053 to 0.14 x 10° dis min=' cm™2.

There were not enough data to make other observations concerning the dis-
tribution of the deposition.

Antimony-126 and Antimony-127. These nuclides were both identified a
few times in the different spectra. However, it does not appear sound to
assign a quantitative value to those peaks in view of the very low activ-
ity left after such a long decay time.

Tellurium-129m (Fig. 7.4). The fact that both the fission yield of

 

*29MTe and the abundance of its photopeaks are small makes it difficult to

detect this isotope with good precision (see also Sect. 4.3). There ap-
pears te be no strong tendency of an activity increase near the baffle
plates, however, a slight increase in activity near the cold end of the
heat exchanger seems apparent. Variation of activity along the longitudi-
nal axis is 0.090 to 0.26 x 10} dis min~' cm™2.

Todine-131 and Tellurium-Iodine-132. Most of the >I and '°2?Te-I
had decayed, although these nuclides could be positively identified in
several spectra. The average activity of *>*'I at shutdown was approxi-

the relatively short half-life of these isotopes in comparison to the decay

time, not much precision can be expected of these values.
7.1.2 Main reactor off-gas line

The flexible l-in.-ID corrugated tubing, called the jumper line, was
scanned. This 2-ft-long jumper line connects the main off-gas outlet at
the fuel pump bowl with the 4-in.-diam section of the main off-gas system.
This is about the only part of the off-gas system that could be "seen" from
the portable maintenance shield and hence was the only piece surveyed.

The 20 spectra were taken about six weeks after reactor shutdown (shut-
down of June 1, 1969) at approximately l-in. intervals along the jumper

137
Cs

line. Although there was some scatter in the data, especially for
and *“°Ba-La, we could not detect a definite trend of decreasing activity
in the downstream direction along the line. Although cesium, barium, and
lanthanum were detected, these apparently were deposited in the off-gas
line by the decaying xenon stripped from the salt rather than from salt
deposits. Actually, no photopeaks could be positively identified from a
nuclide that would indicate the presence of fuel salt; for example, °°Zr
could not be positively identified Table 7.1 lists the nuclides that
were identified; the activity is the average of the 20 different spectra.
These data are extrapolated to the moment of shutdown (June 1, 1969) and
represent disintegrations per minute per inch of off-gas line. It should
be noted, however, that the main off-gas line was partially plugged during

the latter part of the power operation prior to reactor shutdown. Off-

gases were then routed through the fuel-pump overflow-tank off-gas line.
7.1.3 Main fuel lines

Only a few spectra were taken from the main fuel line (line 102).
Given the different counting geometry, due to the distance to the detector
and the shape of the source, these results could only be qualitative.

However, based on experience of the calibration experiments, we can expect

The minimum activity at which a peak could be identified in this case
was «0.10 x 10°° dis/min per inch of line.

that the detection system has a fairly constant efficiency in the energy
range 500 to 1000 keV. This would enable us to compare the activities of
those nuclides that emit photons in that energy range. All nuclide activi-
ties have been made relative to ®°Nb, because this isotope had the most
prominent photopeak in the spectra at 765.8 keV.

The nuclides identified, along with their relative activities, are
given in Table 7.2. Restraint should be applied in using these numbers!
It is intended to use these ratios only for comparison with the nuclide

activities found in the heat exchanger and fuel line spectra taken in

November 1969.

7.2 Group B Spectra

These spectra were recorded through shield plug holes on the main off-
gas line and heat exchanger. As mentioned earlier, holes were drilled in
the lower and upper shield plugs to permit the recording of gamma spectra
from the main reactor off-gas line, the heat exchanger, and one of the
drain tanks. There was one through-hole over each of these components;
the steel containment membrane between the lower and upper shield plugs
was, of course, left in place. Because of this membrane, the aiming of
the collimator had to be done by trial and error rather than with the laser
jig. We tried to obtain the maximum reading on a particular location by

moving the collimator and detector back and forth.
7.2.1 Main reactor off-gas line

Most of these spectra were recorded with the reactor at some power
level and under different reactor conditions. The variable reactor param-
eters were: use of argon instead of helium as purge gas, variations in
pump speed, and different reactor power levels. The purpose of these spec-
tra was to try to find a relation between the different noble fission gas
concentrations (kryptons and xenons) and the changing reactor parameters,
Especially at the higher power levels, the radiation intensity from the
off-gas line was very high, in the order of 1000 R/hr or more. Fair doses
of fast and thermal neutrons were also detected. This necessitated the ex-
tensive use of shielding materials, and even then some spectra contained
too many overlapping peaks for proper analysis but were still useful for
comparative purposes.

The different noble fission gases could be identified in most spectra
and their concentration calculated in a major part of the spectra. These
data were examined in connection with a study of '®°Xe behavior in the re-

actor.’ However, the values were too scattered to permit detailed analysis.

Reactor Experiment, ORNL-TM-3464 (October 1971).

7.2.2 Heat exchanger

These spectra were taken to determine the change in fission product
deposition on the heat exchanger after flush salt was circulated through
the primary system. Spectra were taken before and after the flush-salt
operation. Although the analyzed spectra did show the presence of noble
metals, the activity was so low that it must be assumed that the collimator
was improperly aimed and that we analyzed the general background in the
high-bay area. This was confirmed by the analyzed data; there was no
change in the activity of the considered nuclides before, during, and after

the flush-salt circulation.

7.3. Group D Spectra

These spectra were recorded through the shield-plug hole above the
main reactor off-gas line during a beryllium addition. The purpose was to
evaluate the possible change in noble fission gas concentration during and
after a beryllium addition, but, as with the group B spectra, the scatter

in the results precluded the determination of small changes.

7.4 Group E Spectra

Just upstream of where the main off-gas line ties into the charcoal
beds, there is a facility for isolating samples of reactor off-gas in any
of three sample bombs. A hole was drilled in the shielding over the center
sample bomb, and the off-gas flow was temporarily diverted and forced to
flow through this bomb. Although no quantitative results can be expected,
it is of interest to determine the ratio of the different fission gas con-
centrations. Heavy shielding was necessary to cope with the high radiation
level. As might be expected, some of the decay products of those identi-
fied noble gases were also found. Because of the temporary diversion of
the main off-gas flow, the quantitative activity value of these decay prod-

ucts does not bear much importance.
69

Table 7.3 gives the ratio of activities of the identified noble fis-
sion gases in relation to the °°®Kr activity. It should be noted that the
values of ***"'%e and '®°Xe are to be considered with less confidence.
There was considerable scatter in the value of *®*"Xe: +50%; the *>°®Xe

might be off as much as +60%.

7.5 Group F Spectra

These spectra were recorded through the shield plug holes of the heat
exchanger, the main off-gas line, and the drain tank. From previous ex-
perience we knew that it would take at least two days to remove the upper
shield plugs from the reactor cell, cut the containment membrane, and set
up the portable maintenance shield (PMS). The holes in the shield plug
would give us a convenient opportunity to record spectra at those locations
during the time-span between reactor shutdown and installation of the
equipment on top of the PMS. Drain tank data were taken through the hole

only.
70

There was some disagreement between the data recorded through the
holes from the heat exchanger and off-gas line compared with the data taken
at the same locations with the PMS installed. It seemed that the disagree-
ments were due to misalignment of the equipment, and the results were ad-
justed accordingly by normalizing to a known nuclide (°°Nb).

Several nuclides that otherwise would have been totally decayed could
be identified and their activities estimated, The detector and collimator
were moved several times during this two-day period from one location to
the other.

Reactor shutdown and drain from full power occurred on November 2,
1969, at 1441 hr. The procedure was as follows: with the reactor still
at full power, the thawing of the system drain valve was requested. Once
this freeze valve was thawed, the drain of the fuel salt caused a drop of
the fuel-salt level in the fuel pump bowl which automatically stopped the

fuel pump and then scrammed the reactor.
7.5.1 Main reactor off-gas line

The collimator and detector were set up over the off-gas line hole
two days before the actual shutdown and drain of the system. Several spec-
tra were thus recorded with the reactor at full power; heavy shielding was
necessary for the recording of these spectra.

Because of the very large number of photopeaks in the spectra during
and shortly after reactor operation, it is obvious that many minor peaks
would go undetected in the analysis and sometimes would be added by the
computer program to the areas under the larger peaks. This leads to a cer-
tain overestimation of some of the nuclides present. For the evaluation
we have tried to select those photopeaks that seem to be relatively iso-
lated. Another check on the validity of a selected photopeak was the iso-
tope half-life time as deduced from the presented graphs.

Because of nuclide activity variations due to sometimes short-half-
lived precursors, all these off-gas line data are presented as activities
measured at the moment of counting time rather than extrapolated back to

reactor shutdown time.
71

First, the spectra were recorded with the reactor still at full power,
and from these the average activity was calculated for the identified noble
fission gases. Although many isotopes with longer half-lives were also
identified, their activity appeared to be highly influenced by the many
large photopeaks of the noble fission gases. An exception was °°Nb, with

1

a calculated average activity of 0.99 x 10'? dis min~? in.”", which is close

to the "best estimate" of the °°Nb activity of 0.90 x 10'® dis min~! in.”
given in Section 7.6.2; all activity results are normalized to this last
°5Nb activity. Table 7.4 shows the activities of noble fission gases de-
tected in the off-gas line with the reactor at full power; we estimate the
uncertainty of these results to be #40%.

The activities reported in Table 7.4 appear to be much too high. If
one calculates the maximum nominal disintegration rate of these fission
gases in this section of the off-gas line, the values in the table appear
to be a factor of 10 to 50 too high. The nominal calculation takes into
account the yield of the fission gases and the reactor power and allows
no holdup time in the primary loop. We found no way to explain this dis-
crepancy except to postulate a longer than normal residence time for these
fission gases in the off-gas line §such as might be produced by adsorption
on the wall or on other deposits that were known to be present).

Let us now consider the activities of different nuclides after reactor
shutdown. These spectra, being recorded through the shield plug hole, have
also been normalized to the best estimate of the ?°Nb activity.

It appears that most photopeaks from spectra taken at 1.04 and 1.49
days after reactor shutdown yield results that are too low. Although the
cause is unknown, little confidence should be placed in the results calcu-
lated from these two spectra; these points are indicated in Figs. 7.6 to
7.20 as black points.

Krypton-87 (Fig. 7.5). There is a rapid activity decrease at the
start of the fuel-salt drain, subsequent fuel pump stop, and reactor shut=-
down. The raising of gas bubbles from the salt after the fuel pump stop,
the release of fission gases from the graphite, and the possible back surge
of decaying fission gases back into the system because of drain might all

be contributory to the first rapid and then slower decrease of activity.

Krypton-88—Rubidium-88 (Fig. 7.6). There is a similar rapid activity

 

decrease with ®°Kr; the °®Rb activity decreases almost at the same rate as
88,
Kr.

Strontium-91 (Fig. 7.7). This nuclide is a decay product of the ®*Kr

 

chain. The decrease in activity fits the decay half-life well, which would

confirm its identification. Extrapolated back to zero time, one can esti-

mate its maximum activity to be 0.20 x 10'® dis min~! in.”'., This extrap-

olation seems reasonable if one considers the short decay half-life of its
precursors,
Niobium-97. This nuclide was identified only a few times directly

after reactor shutdown. Its activity was in the order of 10%“ dis min™*

in.=t,

Molybdenum-99 (Fig. 7.6). Although a few of the data appear somewhat

 

too low, most of the activity results decrease according to the °°Mo decay
half-life. From the actual survey of the jumper line, we estimated the
°°Mo at the moment of shutdown to be 0.33 x 10'*, The activities plotted
in the figure agree well with this estimate.

Ruthenium-105-Rhodium-105 (Fig. 7.8). The calculated activity of

 

'95pu is deduced from two of its photopeaks; these agree well. The decay

of the activity conforms very well to the literature data for its decay
half-life, Extrapolated back to reactor shutdown time, the estimated maxi-
mum *°’Ru activity is 0.34 x 10*?® dis min~' in.”*'

The daughter nuclide, *°°Rh, is rather difficult to identify because

its photopeaks are not very prominent and are close to peaks from other

nuclides; one might expect erroneous results. The maximum 1°5Rh activity
is approximately 0.8 x 10'® dis min™* in.”!., The amount of '°°Rh present
in the off-gas line could be due to the buildup from the decaying *°°Ru as

f '°°Rh separation from the salt.

well as from the separate mechanism o
Antimony-129—Tellurium-129m (Fig. 7.9). In a few spectra we could

identify *2°Sb; the lack of dependable nuclear data (decay scheme and

abundance of its gamma rays) made it impossible, however, to assign an ac-

tivity to this nuclide.

Tellurium-129m was detected by its decay from the isomeric state to
the ground state and the subsequent disintegration of the ground state.

We identified '?°"Te primarily by the most abundant photopeak of the '*°Te
daughter at 459.6 keV.

In the decay of '?°Sb, the branching ratio is 85% to the ground state,
1297¢, and 15% to the metastable state, '**"Te, Since the half-life of
1297¢ itself is short, the decay of its 459.6-keV photopeak should, after
a short time, follow a composite of the decay half-lives of 129gh and '?°MTe,
Figure 7.9 shows the activity related to **°Te.

The low yield of only 7.7% for the 459,6-keV photopeak in the decay
of '?°Te implies also that any experimental scatter is amplified by more
than a factor of 13 for the activity calculation. This would, of course,
explain the state of the results.

The '2?°"Te activity can be deduced from Fig. 7.9; this activity ex-
trapolated to zero time agrees reasonably with the estimate of Section
7.6.1. The initial faster decrease of activity of **®Te, with a half-life

129

of about 5 hr, could possibly be attributed to the Sb decay.

Tellurium-131m (Fig. 7.9). Based on the results from three '®'MTe

 

photopeaks, the activity of this nuclide could be well established. Its
identification was confirmed by the decay half-life as deduced from Fig.
7.9. Extrapolated back to reactor shutdown time, the estimated maximum
activity of Te is 0.75 x 10%? dis min~* in.—'. The maximum activity
calculated by extrapolation to reactor shutdown time is acceptable since
one can discount the effects of an eventual '®'Sb decay. Only a few photo-
peaks in the different spectra could be identified as '®'Te; these results
were too sporadic for any interpretation.

Todine-131 (Fig. 7.10). With the exception of two sets of data (1.04
and 1.49 days after shutdown), the results are in good agreement. It ap-
pears that the maximum activity occurs shortly after reactor shutdown time.
This maximum activity is 0.5 x 10> dis min™' in.”', somewhat lower than
the best estimate (Sect. 7.6.1) of the jumper line survey. It might be ex-

131MTa, Another argument is that

plained by the influence of the decaying
13:7 might "evaporate" or transfer from the hot, empty fuel system and set-

tle in the off-gas line (see Chap. 8).

Tellurium-132—Iodine-132 (Fig. 7.11). There is considerable scatter

 

of both the '®2Te and '®2I results in the first hours after reactor shut-

down. During the first 10 hr, disintegration rates vary between 0.45 x 10%?

132

and 1.3 x 10** dis min~! in.—!. Since three I photopeaks seem to yield

consistent activities among each other, one has to accept apparently an

f 132

extra increase o I activity after shutdown. This cannot be explained

132

from the decay of *®2Te and I alone. This surge in activity could be

132

conveniently explained if it is assumed that some of the I formed by
decay of '22Te in the hot, empty fuel system transfers to the off-gas line
along with the circulating purge-gas flow. An extrapolation to reactor
shutdown time, based on the data taken after 2.3 days and taking into ac-
count an equilibrium condition between '®2Te and '*2I, yields 0.67 x 10°
dis min=! in.—', in agreement with the estimate in Sect. 7.6.1 (0.65 x
103). However, if one admits a transfer of iodine to the off-gas line,

a maximum *°2I activity of 0.12 x 10'“ dis min~' in.”! can be expected.

Todine-133 (Fig. 7.12). The results are in reasonable agreement with

 

the '®3I decay half-life. The activities calculated during the first 6 hr
seem to be low, which might again indicate that some transfer of 13371 occurs
from the reactor system to the off-gas line after reactor shutdown time.

Taking into account an equilibrium condition of Te-~I, and the possible

133

iodine transfer, it is estimated that the maximum I activity after re-

actor shutdown is 0.17 x 10? dis min-?! in.” %.

Iodine-134 (Fig. 7.7). The later spectra yield activities that are

 

in very good agreement with the expected decay half-life value. It is esti-
mated that the maximum *3“I activity after reactor shutdown is in the order
of 0.30 to 0.40 x 10'® dis min~" in.”"'.

Xenon-135 (Fig. 7.5). Again there is a rapid decrease in activity di-
rectly after reactor shutdown which might be explained by the different
circumstances related to the stoppage of the fuel pump and the drain. Even
several hours after reactor shutdown and drain, the *?°Xe activity is still

appreciable,

7.5.2 Heat exchanger

With the reactor at full power, the radiation coming through the
shield plug hole over the heat exchanger was too high to record any spec-
tra. The main problem was that the setup of the collimator with detector
caused such a high dose rate of scattered radiation during the alignment
procedure that it was judged unwise to continue as long as the reactor was
at power. Had the collimator and detector been set up and aligned before
the reactor was at power, we could have recorded spectra; however, we found
in later experiments that spectra taken over the heat exchanger with the
reactor at full power could not be analyzed anyhow because of too many peaks.

This situation also prevented the recording of heat exchanger spectra
until the collimator was properly aligned after the drain. Thus we lost
almost three valuable hours of recording.

With our location equipment we determined the position of the shield
plug hole and hence could relate the calculated activities found from the
spectra through the shield plug hole with those deduced from the actual sur-
vey afterward. All calculated activities were normalized by comparing the
°3:1b calculated from a spectrum taken through the shield plug hole and that
actually found during the survey (Sect. 7.6.2). Ve used 0.93 x 10%! dis
min~' cm™? as the normalizing activity for ®°Nb at this location. All ac-
tivities given below are calculated at counting time and are expressed in
disintegrations per minute per square centimeter of heat exchanger tube
surface

In view of our calibration methods, it should be noted that the ac-
tivities of gaseous fission products, which are obviously in the space in
the shell side of the heat exchanger, are expressed in equivalent disinte-
grations per minute per square centimeter of heat exchanger tube.

Krypton—-88—Kubidium-88 (Fig. 7.13). Even 3 hr after reactor shutdown,

 

the ®®Kr and °°

Rb activities are still appreciable. Comparing the krypton
and rubidium activities, it appears that these nuclides are close to an
equilibrium condition,

Strontium-91. A few spectra indicate the presence of °*Sr, with its
photopeak at 1024.3 keV. Since we found ®°Kr, one might, by the same token,
expect decay products of °'Xr. The data were too sporadic to really indi-

cate an average activity; 10 hr after reactor shutdown, a few spectra

indicated a °'Sr activity of approximately 0.15 x 10° dis min=' em™? {not
extrapolated back to zero time).

Niobium-97 (Fig. 7.14). This nuclide has only one strong photopeak

 

(658 keV), which makes it hard to assign much confidence to its identity,
especially since many other peaks in these spectra are located very close
to it. The fact that the observed photopeak decayed with a half-life of
108 min indicates there was interference in measuring the peak. We believe,
however, that this decay rate is sufficiently close to the accepted half-
life (78 min) to justify the peak's assignment to °’Nb.

Extrapolation to reactor shutdown time is acceptable, since its pre~
cursor (°7’Zr) was not identified in the heat exchanger. The estimated maxi-
mum activity at zero time is 0.6 x 10'* dis min™' cm” 2.

Molydenum=-99 (Fig, 7.14). Judging from the plots of different spectra,

 

we have more confidence in the activities yielded by the 739.7-keV photo-
peak than in those from the 778.2-keV peak. The latter is located very
close to a large '*?I and °°Nb peak; this would make the activity calcu=
lation somewhat doubtful, especially since other short-lived isotopes also
have peaks in that energy range

The activities yielded by the 739.7-keV peak are rather consistent and
in good agreement with the results of the actual survey afterward. The

estimated maximum activity at reactor shutdown time is 0.18 x 10? dis

min cm” ©.

Ruthenium-105—Rhodium-105 (Fig. 7.15). It appears difficult to evalu-
ate exactly what the activities of these two nuclides are. One would expect
that *°°Ru and *°°Rh behave approximately the same.

The three '°°Ru photopeaks (469.4, 676.3, and 724.2 keV) decay with a
half-life close to that of '°’Ru. The first two peaks, however, yield a
nuclide activity almost half that from the third peak. The activity de~-
duced from the first two peaks at reactor shutdown time would be 0.3 x 10°
dis min=' cm~?; that from the 724.2-keV photopeak would be 0.46 x 10"
dis min~* em~2. It is very well possible that our nuclear data are not
correct for this isotope.

The scatter of the *°°

Rh activity results is even worse. Especially
during the first hours after shutdown, the 319.2~keV peak indicates a high
activity; these possible aberrations might be due to photopeaks from other

nuclides, which could cause this overestimate.

Based on activities deduced from later spectra, we might conclude the

105

maximum Rh activity would be in the range of 0.4 x 10'! dis/cm®.

Antimony-129—Tellurium-129—Tellurium-129m (Fig. 7.16). Since several

 

other antimony isotopes are known to be present on the metal surfaces of
the heat exchanger, there is no apparent reason why *?°Sb should not be
present too. The problem is that the decay scheme of this nuclide is not
known with certainty; some of its gamma rays are indicated in the litera-
ture, but their reported abundances are doubtful.

We believe we have identified '2°Sb by one of its photopeaks (1028 keV)
and by its decay half-life; but, due to lack of data on the branching ratio
for this gamma ray, we did not calculate the disintegration rate of '*°Sb.
The photon emission rate of this gamma ray at reactor shutdown time was
0.90 x 10*° photons min~* cm™2.

As reported in Section 7.5.1, we identified '*°™Te primarily by the
459.6-keV peak from the decay of *2°Te. The intensity of the 459.6-keV
(and 1084.0-keV) peak would reflect the decay of *2°Sb, *2°Te, and '**"Te.

Figure 7.16 shows the '?°Te activity based on the 459.6- and 1084.0-keV
photopeaks. The absolute abundances of these peaks per decay of 129T¢
(ground state) are taken as 7.7 and 0.6% respectively. In the same figure
is shown the photon emission rate of *?°Sb for its 1028-keV peak.

Tellurium-131lm (Fig. 7.17). Even if *>®'Sb would deposit on metal sur-

 

faces, the maximum '®"Te activity would occur, because of the short *®'Sb

half-life, very soon after reactor shutdown time; hence an extrapolation

to zero time for the maximum activity seems justified. The 1206.6-keV

photopeak appears the least influenced by other peaks and should be con-

sidered the most trustworthy. Our estimate of the maximum *>"Te activity

is 0.73 x 10! dis min~! cm™?,

Todine-131 (Fig. 7.18). Based on the chemical properties of iodine,

 

there is ample reason to believe that iodine remains with the fuel salt.
This was confirmed by gamma-ray spectra taken in a later stage of the ex-
periment. This would mean that any iodine detected came from the decay of
either antimony or tellurium.

The half-lives of Sb and *®'Te are so short that the buildup of

1317 from these nuclides could not be observed. The formation of iodine

from the decay of *°®'"Te, in the case that primarily *3'Sb deposits on the
metal surfaces, presents only a few percent of the total iodine activity
and is difficult to observe. A simple extrapolation to reactor shutdown

time to obtain the maximum *3?

I activity would then mean a very small over-
estimation because of this decay of *®!Te,

In case tellurium rather than antimony deposits, the overestimation
would be much higher, in the order of 60%, because of the slow decay of
131MTe,

There is a fair degree of scatter in the calculated activities. The
estimated maximum activity of *®'I would be approximately 0.24 x 10! dis
min=! ecm~? and is based on the average of the 364.5- and 636.9-keV photo-
peaks. This conforms with the results of the actual survey by extrapo-
lating those back to reactor shutdown time. The evolution of the iodine
activity is considered in more detail in Chapter 8.

Tellurium-132—Todine-132 (Fig. 7.19). For the calculation of the

132

maximum Te activity, a simple extrapolation to reactor shutdown is justi-

fied, Even if it is the tellurium precursor, '>2Sb, that plates out on the
metal surfaces, the latter decay half-life is so short that this would jus-

132

tify the assumption. The maximum Te activity is approximately 0.40 x

10*? dis min~* cm~?.

The iodine activity is expected to grow in from the tellurium decay;
that is, its maximum activity should occur about 9 to 10 hr after reactor
shutdown. The observed '22?I activities do not agree with this. Its ac-
tivity went down again after 5 hr and then after 20 hr or more finally came
into equilibrium with its precursor. The excess of *?2I in the main off-
gas line at about the same time period might indeed point to the transfer
of iodine from the reactor system to the off-gas line. Because of this

132

temporary deficiency in the heat exchanger, the maximum I activity occurs

some 24 hr after shutdown time and amounts to 0.34 x 10'? dis min~' cm™2.

Iodine-133 (Fig. 7.20). The 331 activity seems to decrease faster

 

than can be explained from decay only (transfer!). Taking into account
the decay of its precursor, the maximum '*°I might be expected to be below

0.20 x 10** dis min~* cm™? (before its apparent transfer).

that I is on the metal walls only as a decay product of tellurium,

Xenon-135 (Fig, 7.20). The presence of xenon in the reactor system is

 

ample and in the first hours after reactor shutdown forms an important ac=-
tivity source. Its maximum activity might, at that time, run as high as
0.30 to 0.40 x 10'* dis min=~ cm™?, The decrease in activity is obviously

due to decay and purging of the system.
7.5.3 Drain tank

Several spectra were taken from one drain tank after reactor shutdown.
These spectra were recorded through the hole in the shield plugs over the
drain tank. There was no possibility for calibration of the results or even
for proper alignment. By moving the detector in small amounts back and
forth, we tried to obtain a maximum activity reading.

All data, of course, had to be normalized to have a basis for compari-
son. We chose the 724.2-keV photopeak of °>Zr, extrapolated back to reactor

shutdown time, This appeared to be the most convenient normalization point,

 

since zirconium is supposed to remain with the salt and will be at its maxi=~
mum activity very shortly after reactor shutdown time because of its short-
half-life precursors.

The spectra were taken primarily to check the evolution of the niobium
activity, However, there were some other interesting observations too.

Since we were not entirely sure about the location of the place on the
drain tank from which spectra were taken or the amount of shielding ma~-
terials (flanges, drain-tank vessel, steam drum, etc.), we will report only
on relative results of nuclides having photopeaks close to each other in
the energy range of 600 to 800 keV.

Table 7.5 indicates the evolution of the ratio of the °°Nb to °°Zr
and the °’Nb to °7Zr activity. The °®Zr activity is based on the average
of the photopeaks at 724.2 and 756.9 keV. The °°Nb, °’Nb, and °’Zr activi-
ties are based on the 765.8-, 658.2-, and 743.4-keV photopeaks respectively.
The °’Nb/°’Zr ratio is not of great value for analysis, since any °’Nb iden-

tified is formed in the drain tank in our case. (Any °’Nb in the salt that

drained from the reactor would have decayed before these spectra were
taken.) It is, however, a good check on the credibility of the °°Nb/’°Zr
data.

The °°Nb/®°Zr ratios do not appear to indicate the real activity ratio

°3Nb in the reactor

in the salt itself. If we consider all of the °°*Zr and
system (regardless of location), the maximum value for this activity ratio
is 1.0, immediately after shutdown. In view of the °°Nb deposits in the
primary loop, the activity ratio in the drain tank would be expected to be
appreciably smaller, unless the detection efficiency for ?°Nb were somehow
enhanced. One explanation might be that the °°Nb concentration near the
salt surface is much higher than the average in the salt.

The first spectra taken after reactor shutdown (after about 0.800 day
of decay) revealed the strongest activities to be due to °®Kr(Rb) and '’>°Xe.
Besides the nuclides expected to be with the salt, such as yttrium, zir-
conium, cesium, cerium; and barium-lanthanum, there were also some unex-
pected observations. For example, we did rot detect any molybdenum, anti-
mony, or tellurium; the amount of ruthenium present (both *93Ru and *°°Ru)
was very small, Molybdenum-99 has several photopeaks by which it could be
identified; none of these peaks was present. This would indicate that the
°*Mo activity has to be at least a factor of 100 smaller than the °37Zr ac-
tivity. The same holds true for all the tellurium isotopes; neither the
relatively short-lived ***"Te nor the longer-lived '?*"'Te could be identi-
fied. A further confirmation of the absence of tellurium was the fact that
we could not identify **?I. Since ®?I has a 2.3-hr half-life, this would

132
T

then indicate the absence of the longer half-lived e. ILspecially the

absence of '??I is an important proof because this nuclide can be identi-

fied more easily than any other nuclide in a gamma-ray spectrum. (Ue did

131 133
I 1

identify in the drain tank all longer half-life iodines such as
and *3°I.)

As in the case of molybdenum, the activity of antimony, tellurium, or

s 3

1327 had to be at least a factor of 100 smaller than the °°Zr activity to
go unidentified in these spectra. Table 7.6 shows the major nuclides identi-
fied at various times after reactor shutdown. There were several peaks in

232

the spectra that could not be identified, probably due to the U chain

decay products.

7.6 Group G Spectra

These spectra were recorded during the November shutdown period on the
heat exchanger, the main off-gas line, and the fuel lines. The portable
maintenance shield was used for the survey.

The results presented in this section are those we were really looking
for. The data recorded in July were useful for the analysis of the long-
half-life nuclides, and, above all, it served as a very profitable shakedown
of the equipment. It should be borne in mind that all results are extrapo-
lated to reactor shutdown time by simple exponential techniques. The rea-
son for this extrapolation was to compare results from spectra taken at
different times. This extrapolation might yield, however, a maximum ac-
tivity value for some isotopes that is too high because of the decay of a
precursor nuclide. For example, the extrapolated value of **'I might be
too high by a few percent because of the decay of '*'Te. We will discuss
this in detail in Chapter 8.

Although the analyzer broke down about 24 hr before this planned re-

actor shutdown and drain, everything was made operational in time. The
100

spectra recorded through the shield plug holes in the first two days after
the reactor shutdown while the portable maintenance shield (PMS) was being
set up are reported in Section 7.5. The reactor shutdown and drain occurred
on November 2, 1969, at 1441 hr,

Never before was the PMS installed so soon after a reactor drain,
However, this did pose some problems: the radiation coming from the open
reactor cell was considerable, and extra precautions had to be taken in
installing the PMS at the location where the two lower shield plugs had
been removed. However, no one received a radiation dose above the per-
mitted level. During every day shift, the PMS was installed over a dif-
ferent part of the heat exchanger (or from time to time over the jumper
line of the main off-gas line); spectra were then taken during the evening
and night shifts. As reported earlier, we could scan with one PMS setup
approximately 35 in, along the longitudinal axis of the heat exchanger or
the whole length of off-gas jumper line.

Spectra were taken at intervals of 1 to 2 in. along the heat exchanger
axis and 1 in. along the length of the jumper line. Based on our previous
experience, we judged it worthwhile to increase the real counting time to
800 sec per spectrum. This proved to be advantageous for the counting
statistics and allowed us to identify smaller peaks better. Once a 35-in.
scan was finished, we set the detector over a specific spot and recorded
several long counts of 10,000 sec real counting time for an even better
analysis of the nuclides present. These long counts were continued until
the day shift was ready to move the PMS to the next position.

The entire survey along the length of the heat exchanger was done
twice. Several areas were scanned a third time; the off-gas jumper line
was scanned three times. No transverse scans were made over the heat ex-
changer. It took approximately three weeks to finish the complete survey.

It is worthwhile to note that spectra taken of the same spot but at dif-
ferent times after reactor shutdown did, in general, yield values that were
very similar; this gives some confidence in the results obtained.

There were two series of spectra that gave higher nuclide activity
results. These were taken with the 1/16-in. hole collimator insert at the
very beginning of the survey. We estimate that these slightly higher re-

sults were due to two problems:
101

1. The 1/16~in. hole in the collimator was far from straight and
proved to be difficult to calibrate in relation to the 1/8-in. hole col~
limator; its calibration value, hence the detector system efficiency curve
for this case, might have been somewhat in error.

2, The cacophony of nuclide photopeaks shortly after reactor shutdown
was such that it was obvious that photopeaks from several shorter- and
longer-~half-life nuclides fell on top of each other, thus causing the com-
puter analysis program to overestimate some nuclide activities. As much
care as possible was taken to ensure that the activity calculation con-
sidered only those photopeaks that had little or no interference from other
peaks. This was, however, not always possible for the spectra taken in the

early stages of the survey.

7.6.1 Heat exchanger
About 241 spectra were taken along the longitudinal axis of the heat

exchanger. With a few exceptions, all could be analyzed successfully. The
spectra taken over the heater connector boxes were discarded; the extra
amount of shielding material that was obviously present attenuated the gam-
ma rays too much to allow intelligible conclusions from those spectra. The
results are presented per nuclide and in disintegrations per minute per
square centimeter of heat exchanger tube. Data in which we have less con-
fidence because of the above reasons are indicated in the figures as open
circles.

Niobium-95 (Fig. 7.21). As was also found from the spectra taken in
July 1969, there appears to be an ipcrease of activity near the baffle
plates. There was a good agreement between the data taken in July 1969 and
those in November 1969. All results were based on the single °°Nb photo-
peak of 765.8 keV. The range of activity is 0.090 to 0.27 x 10? dis

min~! cm” 3.

Molybdenum-99 (Fig. 7.22). Because of the relatively short half-life

 

of °°Mo, a large portion had decayed before we could survey the whole heat
exchanger. There is, however, ample reason to believe that molybdenum

would deposit all over the heat exchanger.

Although there is considerable scatter of the results (due to poor
counting statistics), it does appear that there is again a concentration
of activity near the baffle plates,

Results were primarily based on the average activity yielded by the
739.7- and 778.2-keV photopeaks. The rather steep drop in the detector
system efficiency below 250 keV made the 140.5-keV photopeak less desirable
for analysis (see Chap. 4). The range of activity is 0.15 to 0.40 x 10°32

Ruthenium-103 (Fig. 7.23). Essentially the same distribution of the

 

ruthenium deposition occurs as with the previous nuclides. The increase in
activity near the heat exchanger tube sheet or near the baffle plates is
somewhat more pronounced than with °°Nb or °°Mo.

The results were primarily based on the 496.9-keV peak and to a small
extent on the 610.2-keV peak (for confirmation only). The range of ac-
tivity is 0.10 to 0.70 x 10°" dis min™% em™*

RutheniumRhodium-106 (Fig. 7.24). In addition to the increase of
activity near the baffle plates, there is a good deal of scatter in the

hence its smaller disintegration rate. For the same reason, one should not
expect this nuclide to be even close to the saturated deposition concen-
tration.

Antimony-126. This nuclide proved to be difficult to identify. Its

peaks were also close to photopeaks of other nuclides,

puted activity is such that the accuracy is expected to be low. A nuclide
distribution pattern along the heat exchanger could not be established.

The range of activity is 0.023 to 0.14 x 10%° dis min~' cm™®; average ac-
tivity is 0.89 x 10° dis min~' em~?; and standard deviation of the average
activity is 0.11 x 10°.

Although *?7Sb could be detected in almost every spectrum, we had to rely
almost entirely on one photopeak (684.9 keV) for the activity analysis;

Tellurium-129n (Fig. 7.27). The amount of ***"'Te deposited on the

 

metal surfaces might be of crucial importance in explaining the deposition
mechanism of several of the decay chains. There are, however, several
problems that put a strain on an accurate analysis of the '?°"Te (see
Chap. 4.3).

The scatter of the results is considerable, although most within a
certain range. There does not appear to be a strong increase of activity
near the baffle plates; one might observe, however, a slight increase of
activity near the tube sheet of the heat exchanger. The range of activity

636.9-keV photopeaks; the 284.3-keV photopeak was used less because this is
in the energy range where the detector efficiency begins to drop consider-
ably.

The '°*Te had already decayed to a large extent when we started the
actual survey with the PMS. As with antimony and tellurium, there appears
to be some increase of activity near the tube sheet of the heat exchanger.
The range of activity is 0.15 to 0.40 x 10" dis min~! cm™?2.

Tellurium—TIodine-132 (Fig. 7.29). Because of the short half-life

 

of 321, one observes basically the decay of **2Te. Todine-132 conveniently
decays with a multitude of well-known gamma rays, many of which are easy to
identify. For our tellurium and iodine analysis, we mostly used the 667.7-,
772.6~, 954.5-, and 1398.6-~keV photopeaks of **?I to compute an average
disintegration rate. Since the most abundant **2Te gamma ray (228.2 keV)
was so low in the observed energy range, we did not rely much on this peak.
The nuclide distribution along the heat exchanger axis was about the

131
I

same as for ; again the nuclide activity increase near the baffle plates

was not as strong as with °°Nb and *°°Ru. The activity range is 0.30 to
0.75 x 10*?* dis min~! em™2.

Iodine-133, The *?°I was detected but had already decayed appreciably;
the results have been reported together with the gamma-ray spectra taken
through the shield plug holes immediately after reactor shutdown (Chap. 7.5).

Barium—Lanthanum-140 (Fig. 7.30}. Some of the spectra revealed the
presence of '“°Ba-La. Its most abundant photopeak at 1596.6 keV is very
easy to distinguish and was generally relied upon for the activity analysis.

The range of activity was 0.050 to 0.20 x 10*° dis min™' em™?2.

7.6.2 Main reactor off-gas line

The only part of the reactor main off-gas line that is clearly visible
from above without obstruction and hence available for a gamma-spectrometric
survey is the jumper line. This jumper line is a corrugated, 1l-in.-ID
flexible tube connecting the fuel pump purge-gas exhaust at the pump bowl
with the 4-in. pipe section of the off-gas line. This jumper line is ap-
proximately 2 ft long.

Three surveys were made in the November scanning period, each com-

prising about 20 spectra taken approximately 1 in. apart along the off-gas

line. Since there was no noticeable decrease in activity in the downstream
direction, the results of the recorded spectra from each survey have been
combined. With the exception of possibly '2°sb, *?*"'Te, *?®7Cs, and '“°Ba-La,
the scatter of the calculated activity results was quite small.

There was a difference in the results of the three different surveys.
Because the surveys were taken approximately one week after each other, the
decline in the general activity level necessitated different shielding con-
figurations between the detector and the jumper line. For example, the
first survey was done using the 1/16-in. collimator insert with no shielding
material; the second and third survey were executed with a 1/8-in. colli-
mator insert and 1 in. aluminum shielding. We estimate that the results
of the first survey are about 35% too high because of discrepancies in the
1/16-in. collimator calibration (we observed this also with the heat ex-
changer data). Tables 7.7 to 7.9 represent the average activities calcu-
lated from each of the three surveys. We believe that Table 7.9 represents
the best estimate of the activities detected in the jumper line.

During the first survey, '°°Ru~Rh and '®°I were detected several times.
Their calculated activities have been incorporated in the results given in
Section 7.5.

We were unable to detect positively any component suggesting the pres-
ence of salt in the jumper line. In some spectra, a visual inspection of a
spectrum plot revealed very, very weak peaks that might be coming from °37r.
These peaks were so small that the computer analysis in most cases did not
detect them. In a practical sense this implied that the ®°Zr/®°Nb activity

ratio was much less than 0.0005.
7.6.3 Fuel pump bowl and fuel lines

The spectra recorded from gamma rays coming from the main fuel lines
(lines 101 and 102) as well as from the fuel pump are useful only as quali-
tative indications. Our calibration work certainly did not cover the com-
plex geometry of the fuel pump bowl nor the fuel lines. From experience
we know that the efficiency curves for these geometries might be expected
to be relatively flat in the area of 500 to 1000 keV, so we did compute
relative activities for the identified isotopes. Those relative activities
are only indicative figures, and restraint should be used in employing

these values.

Fuel Pump Bowl. Besides the isotopes identified throughout the sys-
tem, we identified ®°Zr and other salt components. Although not surprising,
this would indicate the presence of small amounts of fuel salt, apparently
left over from the drain. Table 7.10 shows the isotopes identified to-
gether with their relative activities in relation to the °’Nb activity.

101 Fuel Line Connecting the Fuel Pump with the Heat Exchanger. Besides
the usual deposited fission products, again there was evidence of small re-
mains of fuel salt. Table 7.11 shows the identified isotopes as well as
their activity in relation to the °°Nb activity.

102 Fuel Line Connecting the Heat Exchanger with the Reactor. The
usual nuclides were detected but no evidence of fuel salt could be posi-
tively identified. Table 7.12 shows the identified isotopes as well as

their relative activity in relation to the °°Nb activity.

7.7 Group H Spectra

From November 26 to December 12, 1969, the reactor was operated at
full power for approximately 16 days. The final shutdown of the MSRE oc-
curred on December 12, 1969, at 1046 hr. The spectra in this group were
taken from the heat exchanger shortly after the final power shutdown through
the shield plug hole.

During this period of operation, three beryllium exposures were made
which produced a total of 4,4 gram equivalents of reduction in the fuel
salt. Since it is believed that this has a large influence on the behavior
of the noble metals, in particular niobium, it was difficult to estimate
how much niobium was left from the previous runs, how much of the niobium
formed during this run deposited, and how much had gone from the metal walls
back into the salt.

The aiming of the collimator with the detector through the shield plug
hole was difficult. During the November shutdown we were able to normalize
all the results of the spectra taken through the hole (Sect. 7.5.2) to the
®5Nb activity found at the same spot during the later survey. However,
this was not possible this time because we did not do a survey afterward.
All results were normalized to a °°Nb activity of 0.465 x 10'' dis min™*'

cm~?, this value being an arbitrary number and based on the average of the

measured °°Nb activities through this recording period. The actual value
might be somewhat different.

Another problem that complicated the analysis of the data was that the
final reactor shutdown was not done in the same way as the November 2 shut-
down. The reactor power was gradually decreased, starting about at 1018 hr;
28 min later the reactor scram occurred, and the drain of the fuel started
at 1105 hr. Under these conditions a proper evaluation of the activities
of the different nuclides is extremely difficult for the shorter-half-life
isotopes.

Spectra were taken for a period of approximately three days over the
heat exchanger only. Again, the activities are reported as measured at the

time of counting.

7.7.1 Heat exchanger

Because of the mentioned uncertainties, it does not seem reasonable
to analyze these data extensively; they might indicate qualitative results
only. The activity results of the most abundant activities are presented
in Figs. 7.31 to 7.40. All figures are normalized to the arbitrary ®3Nb

activity of 0.465 x 10'' dis min™' cm™®. We will only make some general

 

remarks concerning the nuclide activity results presented in the figures,
since the absolute values are uncertain.

In view of our calibration methods, it should be observed that the
activities of gaseous fission products, which are obviously filling the
space in the shell side of the heat exchanger, are expressed in equivalent
disintegrations per minute per square centimeter of heat exchanger tube.

Figure 7.31. Based on only one photopeak, we observed a maximum ®7kr
activity of 0.4 x 10'! dis min™! cm~2.

Figure 7.32. Rubidium-88 apparently was formed by the decay of 88Kr
after the reactor shutdown, since its activity increases to a maximum before
it comes into equilibrium with its precursor. The rate of activity decrease
of ®®°Kr might be influenced by fuel pump starts at 0.03 and 0.3 day after
reactor shutdown. Concerning the °°Mo activity, we have more confidence in

its 739.7-keV photopeak; this in accordance with previous observations.

We observed the following maximum activities (dis min™' em™2): °°%Kr,
0.42 x 10**; ®°Rb, 0.13 x 10'*; and °°Mo, 0.41 x 10*%.

Figure 7.33. Identified by its decay half-life as well as its only
photopeak at 658.2 keV, we feel reasonably sure to have identified °’Nb.
Its activity, in relation to the °°Nb activity, is quite large: maximum
°’Nb activity, 0.11 x 10%? dis min~! em™2.

Figure 7.34. Ruthenium-105 and '°°Rh were definitely detected; their
ratio of activities appeared to be different from the one found in the No-
vember shutdown (see Sect. 8.3.2).

The following maximum activities (dis min™* cm™?) were observed:

'°%pu, 0.30 x 10**, and '°°Rh, 0.12 x 10%.

from the decay of **°Sb, **°Te, and **°MTe; the presence o
to be confirmed by the photon emission rate of its 1028-keV photopeak.

The observed maximum activity of **°Te, based on the 459.6-keV photo-
peak, is 0.69 x 10** dis min~! cm=?,

Figure 7.36. The presence of '°'Te could not be identified with cer-
tainty, since only a few spectra showed photopeaks which might be assigned
to that nuclide; '°®'"Te was definitely identified. A close look at the ac-
tivity shortly after shutdown at least does not contradict the idea that
part of the '®'"Te is formed after reactor shutdown by decay of '3!Sh; at
least two of its photopeaks (852.3 and 1206.6 keV) seem to indicate a maxi-
mum activity of 0.4 x 10'! dis min~' cm™ about 1 1/2 hr after shutdown.

Figure 7.37. We have more confidence, especially shortly after reac-
tor shutdown, in the results of the 364.5-keV *®'I photopeak. As expected,
1327 is formed by the decay of '*2Te after the reactor drain; its maximum
activity would occur several hours after shutdown.

We observed the following maximum activities (dis min=* em=2): '°'I,

0.14 x 10*'; *32Te, 0.20 x 10*%; and *3°1, 0.16 x 102.
Figures 7.38 and 7.39, Tellurium-133 and *®°I could be positively

 

identified, although there is some discrepancy of the **?I decay half-life.

Iodine-134 typically grows in from the decay o Te after reactor shut-

Since some of these corrosion products might have been activated by
delayed neutrons in the primary heat exchanger, those corrosion products
in the coolant-salt radiator could possibly be observed with the gamma-ray
spectrometer. The detector was set up in front of the radiator with the

radiator doors open; no collimator was used. Since the MSRE main off-gas

line, although heavily shielded, passes not far away from this detector lo-
cation, it appeared that the majority of the recorded photopeaks came from
the off-gas line, Typical examples of identified nuclides that should not
be expected in the coolant radiator were: °°Nb, °°Mo, *°°Ru, *°°Ru(Rh),
1317 132pe_ 7, !3%%e, '37Cs, and '“°Ba-La. These nuclides formed the major
peaks in the recorded spectra.

Some other nuclides could be identified with some degree of confidence.
An approximate relative activity has been calculated for these in relation
to the activity of 8%9Co (Table 7.13).

Because the unshielded detector obviously picked up gamma rays from
different locations, the identified corrosion product radiations do not
necessarily need to have come from the coolant radiator. A collimator
would have been useful in identifying the sources of the activities; however,
the activity level was too low to permit use of the available collimation

equipment.

7.10 Group K Spectra

The purpose of this study was to measure the flow rate of coolant salt
in the loop. Certain components of the coolant salt will be slightly acti-
vated by delayed neutrons in the primary heat exchanger to produce *®N and
'?F, By measuring their activity at two places along the coolant-salt line,
it is possible in principle to determine the flow rate from these decaying

nuclides. The results of these measurements have been reported elsewhere.*’

of a collimator with the detector was required to record gamma-ray spectra
from this sample as soon as it was back in the sampler enricher. The re-
actor was at full power during this experiment. The objective was to study
the deposition of short-lived fission products on graphite. A similar ex-
periment was performed with a sample capsule filled with fuel salt as well
as with a dummy sample capsule without salt. These experiments have yet to

be analyzed in detail.

7.12 Group M Spectra

Several miscellaneous spectra were taken from the lube oil system, the
523 off-gas line, and the roughing filters.

Argon instead of helium was used as a reactor system purge gas for
some special experiments to study the influence of a different gas on the
stripping efficiency of noble fission gases in the fuel pump bowl as well
as the change in the bubble fraction in the fuel salt, Since part of this
argon could circulate with the fuel salt in the reactor system, some argon
activation was to be expected. As a result, we even found some “*Ar in the
fuel pump lube oil system during this experiment. This was proved by placing
the detector near this lube oil system. Apparently “*Ar was entrained by
the lube oil from the fuel pump to the lube oil system outside the reactor
cell,

Shortly before the reactor shutdown on June 1, 1969, a plug developed
in the main reactor off-gas line. Purge gases were then exhausted through
the pump bowl overflow tank and its off~gas line (line 523). A plug also
developed in this line after a period of time. Through other methods it
was established that the plug was in a particular section of the 523 line.
In an effort to locate the plug precisely, the gamma-ray spectrometer was
used to survey that pipe section. This method would have been viable if
the plug had consisted of radioactive material. Although there was some
increase of activity near a valve in the line, we could not identify the
real location of the plug. Afterward, when this pipe was taken out and
inspected, it was learned that the plug consisted of carbonaceous material;

hence it is not surprising that we did not detect any activity increase,
139

The nuclides identified in this pipe section were similar to those found
in the main off-gas line such as noble metals and decay products from noble
fission gases.

The roughing filters, or prefilters, are used for the containment ven-
tilation system. The ventilation areas normally comprise the reactor high-
bay area but also include the reactor and drain tank cells during mainte-
nance operations when the reactor cell containment is opened. During peri-
ods of maintenance, one can expect some activity from the reactor cell (main-
ly activation products) to collect on these filters. During replacement of
the roughing filters, some gamma-ray spectra were taken to check on the
nature of the retained activity. Table 7.14 shows the nuclides identified
from these spectra together with their activity in relation to ®°Co. The
spectra were recorded many weeks after use of the filters, so no shott-

lived activities should be expected.

8. CONCLUSIONS

The primary purpose of this study was to compile, in a readily usable
form, a block of data on certain aspects of the behavior of fission products
in the MSRE., We believe that the results given in the previous chapters are
a fair representation of the analysis of all the recorded spectra that per-
tain to the fission product deposition in the parts of the MSRE that could
be examined by this method.

In general, we have found remote gamma-ray spectrometry to be readily
applicable and productive of much useful information about the MSRE. Many
observations (e.g., possible discovery of new gamma rays, fundamental evalu-
ation of collimators, etc.) are believed to be in disciplines that are not
directly connected to the fission product behavior of this reactor and con-
sequently are omitted from this report.

We realize that this work is only part of a very complicated matter
in which the coordination of several specializations might be required to
develop a more complete picture of fission product behavior in the MSRE.
Hopefully, the information presented in this report can be combined with
other data to achieve that goal.

This chapter presents some of our observations about the performance
of this study. In addition, we draw some conclusions concerning the be-

havior of certain fission products.
8.1 Data Collection and Analysis

8.1.1 Gamma spectrometer system

One of the main reasons that we were able to analyze these complicated
spectra successfully was the excellent resolution capability of the de-
tector. Since we had to collimate and shield the incoming gamma rays con-
siderably, there was no need for a large, expensive, high-efficiency de-
tector. For these studies a medium-sized (26-cm®) and hence rather inex-

pensive high-resolution crystal sufficed. The need for a multichannel

 

*

It should be noted that although the detector was only of medium size,

it had a rather high peak-to-Compton ratio (27:1), thus permitting detection
of many low energy gammas that would not otherwise have been observed.
142

analyzer (4096 channels) with magnetic tape recorder seems indispensable
with such a detector. Since our spectra were complicated, the spectrum
analysis could only be done efficiently by computer. The computer program
was complex and required a large memory, 610 k-bytes. It is doubtful that

a smaller computer coupled directly to the analyzer system would have served
our purpose.

The collimator assembly served its purposes well; with the proper
choice of a collimator insert, we could limit the total amount of radiation
to the detector without excessive use of shielding material. Also, we
were able to observe fission product depositions in reactor components at
very definite locations. Since the assembly was mounted with three adjust-
able set screws on an axial thrust bearing, instead of directly on the
portable maintenance shield, we could easily make small adjustments to the
assembly orientation. However, it was difficult to make a straight col-
limator beam hole, The idea of a free-floating thick-walled stainless
steel precision tube around which the shielding lead is poured can be
fruitful if some more thought is given to it.

The locational equipment, that is, laser and surveyor's transits, per-
formed very satisfactorily and proved to be precise, reliable, and inex-
pensive. Since we moved the detector frequently, it is felt that any so-
phistication of this equipment (e.g., such as mirrors to guide the laser

beam around the detector) would have been detrimental to its reliability.

8.1.2 Calibration

Very little is known about the efficiency of gamma-ray detectors in
relation to a collimated beam. This, together with the complexity of the
heat exchanger geometry, led us to believe that the effort given to the
empirical calibration of equipment was worthwhile. The fact that differ-
ent spectra recorded from the same spot on a component, but taken with en-
tirely different shielding configurations, yielded virtually the same ac-
tivities lends confidence to the calibration results obtained.

Silver-110m proved to be a good calibration source. If one has re-
actor irradiation facilities available, such a source can be made rather
easily. The extension of the efficiency curves, as obtained with *'°"Ag,

to both the lower and higher energy ranges was possible by using the actual
143

fission product spectra obtained during the experiment itself. The rela-
tive efficiency curves obtained from the fission product spectra were
consistent with the absolute efficiency curves found with the calibration

source.

8.1.3 Computer analysis program

 

Considerable time and effort were required to convert the computer
analysis program, which originated at Lawrence Radiation Laboratory, for
operation at the ORNL computing center. The program is quite powerful and,
generally speaking, satisfied our needs well. For application to spectra
like ours, where there are so many multiple photopeaks, however, we can en-
vision several improvements, particularly in the analysis of multiplets.

Our table of radionuclides, as used in the library of the computer
program, was a very useful tool for the analysis of the spectra. This
table might be also of interest to others working in the gamma-spectrometry
field, and so is presented as Appendix A. Although this table contains the

latest published data, we realize that it is far from complete.

8.2 Results — General

We will draw some general conclusions concerning the fission product
distribution in several reactor components, without, however, going here

into detail on the different decay chains.

8.2.1 Metal surfaces in direct contact with the fuel salt

Metallic fission products, such as isotopes of niobium, molybdenum,
ruthenium, rhodium, antimony, and tellurium, were present on the walls of
the reactor system that were in contact with the fuel salt. Their depo-
sition on the walls represented, in general, a large fraction of the total
amount of that nuclide present in the entire reactor system.

Because of additional metal surface exposed to the salt near the baf-
fle plates in the primary heat exchanger, one might expect a small increase
in activity there. It appears, however, that the observed large increases
in activity near these baffle plates (two to four times higher than in
intervening areas) are due to additional effects. It may be that the salt
flow pattern influences the deposition rate of these fission products.

For example, niobium, molybdenum, and ruthenium~rhodium exhibit a higher
144

activity increase near the baffle plates (2.5 to 4 times) than antimony,

tellurium, and iodine (1.5 to 2 times).

A study of the activity of the several iodine isotopes directly after
reactor shutdown and subsequent fuel drain during the final reactor shut-
down in December revealed that the iodine activities (*°'I and especially
1221) build up after reactor shutdown. Although we were never able to
detect **°I after the drain of the fuel, we did detect it during the drain.
Therefore we conclude that the observed large iodine activities in the
empty system were mostly due to the decay of their precursors that deposited
on the wall; iodine itself, however, remains with the fuel salt.

In comparing the relative activities of the deposited metal fission
products (relative to ®°Nb) in the heat exchanger and in the fuel lines
(101 and 102), there is no major difference in the deposition rate on the
heat exchanger (between the baffle plates) and on the fuel lines. Molybdenum
and ruthenium are possible exceptions; their relative activity appears to be
somewhat higher in the fuel lines. It should be stated, however, that this
is a tentative conclusion since we did no calibration work on the entirely
different geometry of the fuel lines.

The amount of activity in the heat exchanger caused by the decay of
noble fission gases is appreciable. Although most gas activities disap~-
peared after a few hours because of decay and some circulation of purge
gas, their decay represents a significant heat source during the first hours
after drain of the fuel salt. These noble fission gases probably came from
several sources:

1. A release of gases absorbed in the graphite bars in the reactor core,

2. A release of gas bubbles from the fuel salt while in the course
of draining to the drain tank.

3. A back-flow of gases from the holdup gas volume of the main reactor
off-gas line. In order to drain the fuel salt, a gas pressure
equalizer line is necessary between the drain tanks and the fuel sys-
tem; this line (521) ties into the main reactor off-gas line at the
4-in.-ID gas holdup section. A calculation of the volume of these
back-flowing fission gases during drain largely explains the unex-
pectedly high activity of noble fission gases in the reactor system

after shutdown.
145

It is reassuring to note that the magnitudes of the activities de-
tected in the heat exchanger during the July shutdown were very close to

those detected during the November survey.

8.2.2 Main reactor off-gas line

As might be expected, the major activities in the main reactor off-gas
line during reactor operation are due to the decay of noble fission gases
and their decay products. These nuclides still form a large source of ac-
tivity shortly after reactor shutdown, but they decay rapidly and are di-
luted by purging of the empty fuel system.

Metals such as niobium, molybdenum, ruthenium, rhodium, antimony, and
tellurium (iodine) could barely be identified during reactor operation but
formed the major activity source soon after reactor shutdown.

Since we were not able to detect '®®I in the off-gas line, although
other iodine isotopes with metallic precursors were identified,” we believe
that iodine proper does not separate from the salt and will neither disap-
pear in large quantities into the off-gas line nor remain with the metal
walls when the system is filled with circulating salt.

We were not able to positively identify any nuclide, such as °°Zr,
that is supposed to remain with salt; that is, we could not detect any ap-
preciable quantity of fuel salt in the off-gas line. Although on a few
occasions the computer program found a photopeak possibly due to *°Zr, we
scrutinized the actual plots of these spectra and were not convinced of the
presence of salt within the range of our nuclide detection sensitivity.
Concerning the off-gas line geometry, this meant that we could not detect
activities less than 0.5 x 10'° dis min~! in.”! or an activity less than
5 x 10=“ of the detected °°Nb activity.

Taking into account the purge-gas flow rate through the jumper line,

it is not surprising that we did not detect a decrease in nuclide activity

along the jumper line.

 

*
The precursors of '°°I have half-lives too short for significant
amounts to escape from the salt.
146

Comparing the activities calculated from the July and November surveys,
the longer-lived nuclides, such as *°°Ru-Rh and '*’Cs, seem to be con-
sistent; °°Nb, *°°Ru, and '?°"'Te appear to be about four times higher
during the November survey. This could partly be explained because of the
power history before shutdown as well as by the fact that the main off-gas
line was partially plugged during the latter part of the power operation
before July. (At that time the off-gases were routed through the off-gas
line of the fuel pump overflow tank.) Shorter-lived nuclide activities

(e.g., *?'I) would be even more influenced by this plugging problem.

8.3 Elements and Nuclide Chains

 

Although it is clear that the reported results are only a part of the
total picture of fission product behavior, it is possible to draw some ten-
tative conclusions concerning the behavior of certain elements and nuclide
chains. In particular, it is of interest to examine the behavior of iso-

topes that belong to the same element or to the same decay chain.
8.3.1 Niobium

Both °°Nb and ®’Nb were identified in the heat exchanger after the
November and the final shutdown. Because of the short half-life of °’Nb
as well as its precursor, the disintegration rate of this nuclide reflects
only the deposition of niobium shortly before shutdown. The °°Nb activity
would represent a much longer history where chemical conditions of the
salt were different.

Because absolute activities derived after the final shutdown may be
uncertain, we have compared the °’Nb results for the November and final
shutdowns by normalizing them to the ®°Nb values. Table 8.1 shows these
results corrected for decay to reactor shutdown rime. Also shown are
half-lives and fission yields. These data pertain to the area in the heat

exchanger under the shield plug hole.

 

*
Since it is niobium that deposits on the metal walls or disappears

into the off-gas line, it appears legitimate to extrapolate back to reactor
shutdown time to obtain the maximum niobium activities.

It is estimated that the total fission rate in the MSRE was due to
the contribution of the following isotopes: 232°U, 94%; 23°u, 2.25%;
23°pu, 3.75%. Actual fission yields were calculated from B. M, Rider,
A Survey and Evaluation of Thermal Fission Yields, GEAP-5356.
148

Concerning the activity results after the November shutdown, one might
expect the °’Nb activity to be in equilibrium with its environment whereas
the °°Nb activity is not; the uninterrupted power run was less than two
months.

A possible explanation for the November shutdown ®’Nb/®°Nb activity
ratio might be to assume a time lag between formation and deposition. An
average time lag, or residence time in the salt before deposition, of ap-
proximately 100 to 150 min would explain the calculated ratio of 0.63.

The small ®°Nb buildup during the short power run after the long shut-
down period in November, as well as two beryllium additions prior to the
final shutdown (which are known to affect the niobium behavior), might ex-
plain the rather different activity ratio of 3.0 after the last shutdown.

Currently it is thought that the oxidation potential of the salt, which
is influenced by the beryllium additions, affects the niobium solubility in
the fuel salt. This, of course, forms another dimension to the deposition
problem. Therefore, a study of the ®°’Nb concentration in the salt in re-
lation to the oxidation potential might be quite useful in future reactor
systems. The reason for using the °’Nb concentration is that it is not in-
fluenced by a long reactor power history as is °°Nb. A simple gamma-spec-
trometry assay done at the reactor site would be ample.

We were not able to positively identify °’Nb in the main off-gas line;
there were indications of this nuclide, but too few to assign a numerical

value to it.
8.3.2 Ruthenium-rhodium

Three ruthenium nuclides were identified in both the heat exchanger
and the off-gas line: '°?Ru, '°®Ru, *°°Ru-Rh. Since it was assumed that
the rutheniums are the first nuclides in their respective fission decay
chains that deposit on the metal walls or escape into the off-gas line,
an extrapolation to reactor shutdown time would then be legitimate to ob-
tain their maximum activities. This might not be the case for '°°Ru, since
its precursors, '°°Mo and *‘°°Tc, also will deposit on the metal walls; it
would, however, not introduce a large error in our evaluation of the maxi~

105

mum Ru activity. Table 8.2 shows comparative values for these three

isotopes. The activities are given relative to the activity of *°°Ru-Rh.

fission yields were calculated from B. M. Rider, 4 Survey and Evaluation of Thermal

Fission Yields, GEAP-5356.
150

Let us look first at the *°?Ru and *°®°Ru-Rh. Taking into account the

whole power history of the reactor one can calculate how much '°?Ru and

‘°fRu are present in the entire reactor system: in the salt, on the graph-

ite the off-gas line, or on the metal walls. These calculated inventories

L003 ioe

yield a ratio of the Ru activity relative to the Ru-Rh activity of

roughly 6.5 both for the November shutdown and the final shutdown. Because
of the difference in decay half-lives of these isotopes, this ratio should

decrease with increasing age of the mixture. Tentatively one would conclude

i103 106
Ru—

from the November shutdown ratio of 3.6 that the iL: Ru~-Rh mixture has

an average age of several weeks or that ruthenium does not tend to deposit
very readily on metal walls.

The same ratio calculated for the off-gas line is 7.4. This seems to
suggest that ruthenium separates from the salt and disappears into the
off-gas line (or possibly deposits on the graphite rather than on the metal
walls). In other words, since we could barely detect ruthenium in the fuel
salt in the drain tank, it appears that this element has only a slight ten-
dency to deposit on metal surfaces and rather will disappear into the off-
gas line (or deposit on the graphite) Data on the deposition on graphite

would be very important for a complete picture of the ruthenium behavior.

105 103

If one assumes that Ru deposits by the same mechanism as Ru and

'°%Ru, the '°°Ru data from Table 8.2 are rather hard to explain. One al-

ternative possibility would be to assume that it is the short-lived *%5Mo

105

or Te that really deposits, the observed *°°

Ru in the heat exchanger

being mainly the result of its precursors deposition. A check on the ac~-

+053

tivity of Ru relative to “°’Mo both in the off-gas line and the heat ex-

changer does not exclude this possibility.

Because many other photopeaks are adjacent to or even coincide with

105

its peaks, Rh is difficult to identify. From a study of Figs. 7.8,

7.15 and 7.34, two conclusions may be drawn. The results concerning the

105

heat exchanger, Figs. 7.8 and 7.34, suggest that the Ru activity is

'°5Rh activity; the opposite is true for the

equal to or higher than the
off-gas line. Also, the *‘°°Rh does not gradually build up from nothing
to a maximum in the heat exchanger. Apparently, '°°Ru remains on the metal

walls after its formation from *°°Mo-Tc. The '°°Rh seems, to certain degree
151

at least, to dissolve from the heat exchanger and then partly transfer to
the off~gas line.

In view of the '°?Ru—*°®Ru-Rh behavior we envision the following pos-
sibility for the 105 decay chain: molybdenum deposits more readily on the
heat exchanger than ruthenium; in agreement with the °°Mo data, it also
escapes into the reactor off-gas line. The ruthenium does not desorb from
the metal walls; therefore the observed deposits of this element on the
heat exchanger and in the off-gas line are merely the decay products of
the deposited molybdenum. Rhodium, formed by the decay of ruthenium, not
only decays on the metal walls but also goes back into the salt and eventu-
ally disappears appreciably into the off-gas line. The fact that only very
small amounts of various rutheniums were found in the salt confirms the
contention that these nuclides transfer rather quickly from the salt into

the off-gas line (or onto the graphite).

8.3.3 Antimony—telluriumiodine

 

The identification of *2°Sb, '#°Sb, '27Sb, and '*°Sb in the heat ex-
changer and in the off-gas line leads one to believe that antimony is at
least partly instrumental in the presence of tellurium and, as a result,
also of iodine after drain of the reactor system. The emerging question
then is: What governs the tellurium deposition? There are several possi-
bilities, the extremes of which are (1) all tellurium, after formation from
decay of deposited antimony, returns to the salt and moves elsewhere; that
is, when the system contains fuel salt, no tellurium is present on the metal
walls; (2) tellurium deposits or remains on the wall.

Let us take an example of the fission decay scheme of the elements of

mass number 131:

131m
82%
6.8%

1316p 18% i317
93.27%

Sie
152

Antimony-131 decays for 6.8% to the isomeric state of tellurium, **Te,
and for 93.2% directly to the ground state, '®'Te; '>'MTe decays for 82%

131

directly to I and for the rest first to the ground state and then to

317, Table 8.3 shows the cumulative fission yields as well as the decay
half-lives.

In the first case assumed above, tellurium would remain on the metal
walls only after the drain of the system. Because of the short half-life,
the equilibrium concentration of '**Sb on the walls would be relatively
small, After shutdown, the iodine activity would build up rather quickly
since both '®'Sb and '®'Te have short half-lives. The buildup of **'I
through Te would be small and provide roughly 5% of the maximum iodine
activity. Since we did not detect any tellurium in the salt, the bulk of

this element would then have to be either on the graphite or in the off-gas

line.

131

In the second case, Te and *®'"Te would be also in equilibrium on

the metal walls when the salt is still in the system; this means that their
decay rates are governed by the respective fission yields. Since 131Mre
has a much longer half-life than '®'Te, the equilibrium concentration of
13iMTe is much larger than that of *3'Te. The buildup of '°'I is expected
to come from three sources: ‘3'Sb, '3'Te, '*YTe, In view of the fission
yields and decay half-lives of these iodine precursors, roughly 707% of the
maximum iodine activity would be due to ‘®'Te and the remainder to '®’Sb
and '®'Te. The maximum iodine activity would occur approximately three
days after reactor shutdown; however, this maximum would not be very pro-
nounced, since the iodine activity from '®!Sb and *®'Te builds up quickly
after reactor shutdown.

Let us now examine the different figures and try to decide what actu-
ally happened in the heat exchanger.

Figure 7.18. We believe that the data based on the 364,5-keV photo-
peak are the most trustworthy, although the values might be somewhat too
high shortly after reactor shutdown because of a prominent %°Kr photopeak
at 362.6 keV. Apart from the first data after shutdown, one would conclude
from this figure that the **'T does build up to a maximum activity two to

three days after reactor shutdown. This observation would be in line with
153

%1t is estimated that the total fission rate in the MSRE
was due to the contribution of the following isotopes: 23°U,

154

the above-mentioned second hypothesis. The relatively high
in relation to, for example, °°Nb or ®°Mo would also favor the second case.

Figure 7.17 . If the first hypothesis were to hold, one would expect
the “Te activity to be appreciably lower than the *>°I activity because
the amount of '*'Te formed from *3'Sb would be quite small. This is defi-

nitely not the case.

Figures 7.18 and 7,19 . Antimony-132 has a decay half-life of approxi-

 

mately 2.1 min and *°'Sb approximately 25 min. (The decay half-lives and
fission yields of these two isotopes do not appear to be very well known.)
This means that their equilibrium concentrations on the metal walls, also
taking into account the fission yields, differ by a factor of at least 8
to 10, Consequently, if the first hypothesis were correct, the '*'I should
be higher than the '®?Te-I activity This is definitely not the case.
Although it is fully acknowledged that a more precise analysis should
be made of the antimony-tellurium-iodine data, it seems reasonable to con-
clude from the above that both the antimony and tellurium isotopes do de~
posit on the metal walls while the fuel salt is in the system. Both of
these elements seem to contribute to the total iodine activities. Iodine
itself, however, will not remain on the metal walls as long as there is
salt in contact with these walls. A study of the antimony, tellurium, and
iodine activities of the other fission decay chains basically points to the

same conclusion.

8 3.4 Extrapolation back to reactor shutdown time

In order to plot and compare the recorded data during the actual sur-
vey of the heat exchanger and main reactor off-gas line, all activities
were extrapolated back to reactor shutdown time. This seems a reasonable
procedure to obtain the maximum activities of the deposited elements. There
is possibly one exception to this rule, *°'I. Because '>'I appears to at-
tain its maximum activity only after roughly three days, the extrapolation

131

would overestimate the maximum I activity by about 20%. Thus, '®'I data

given in Fig. 7.28 and Tables 7.7 to 7.9 could be considered 207% too high.
Since all data of the heat exchanger and main reactor off-gas line were

taken during the actual survey, three or more days after reactor shutdown,
131

these extrapolated I activities are consistent among each other,
155

9. EPILOGUE

We observed a rather large, unexpected activity due to the fission
gases krypton and xenon in the heat exchanger. This could be explained
by taking into account a flow of these gases from the main reactor off-gas
line back into the reactor system during the drain of the fuel salt. Actu-
ally, if one calculates the volume of the gases involved and their average
age after fission, the observed activity in the reactor system can be ap-
proximately accounted for. Where substantially larger activities are in-
volved with large molten-salt reactors, a different layout of this gas
equalizer line should be considered to avoid such an activity surge.

With the exception of the jiodines, all identified fission products
migrated to the walls of the heat exchanger (and consequently to other
metal walls in the reactor system), while the fuel salt was in the system.
Unless the flush salt has entirely different chemical properties, it is
difficult to expect that this salt would dissolve the deposited elements.
With the exception of *°!'I, '?°I, and '®“I, the current flush salt is not
expected to reduce appreciably the deposited activities; it still might be
useful, however, to dissolve pockets of fuel salt or absorb radioactive
dust.

In the previous chapter we have tried to define a few causal relation-
ships for the observed activities of deposited fission products. In view
of larger molten~salt reactor systems, it might be useful — beyond academic
interest — to study the recorded data in much more detail. For example, a
detailed study of the niobium, molybdenum-ruthenium-rhodium, and antimony-
tellurium~iodine decay chains should be of interest since these elements
seem to represent the major heat sources in the empty reactor system and
main reactor off-gas system.

After this satisfactory experiment, in which a sensitive gamma-ray
spectrometer was used in a very intense radiation field, we feel confident
that a similar technique could be very useful in larger molten-salt reactor
systems. For example, a remote gamma-ray spectrometer aimed at a bypass
line of the main fuel system could economically reveal very useful infor-
mation: the °’Nb/°?Nb ratio in connection with the redox potential of

233

the salt and the Pa concentration.
156

Although the gamma spectrometry system used in this study was in most
respects highly satisfactory, two changes could be made that might signifi-
cantly extend its usefulness. One change pertains to the detection of weak
gamma lines (small photopeaks) in the presence of strong lines. Each gamma
ray produces, in addition to a photopeak, a Compton continuum distribution
with an energy range varying from 0 keV to just below the full energy of
the gamma ray. A count in the Compton distribution arises when a photon
loses only part of its energy in the detector. The remaining energy leaves
the detector as a Compton scattered photon.

Although the detection of low-energy gamma rays is favored because the
counting efficiency rapidly increases as the gamma energy decreases, this
effect is partly offset if higher-energy gammas are present. Because of the
Compton distribution of the higher-energy gammas, the lower-energy photo-
peaks will be masked to an extent that depends on the relative intensities
of the various gammas. If they are of sufficiently low intensity the low-
energy photopeaks will be completely masked.

In the past few years, a technique has evolved to greatly increase the
peak/Compton ratio and thereby significantly extend the ability of the sys~
tem to detect low-energy gammas in the presence of high-energy gammas.

This technique makes use of a Ge(Li) detector enclosed in a much larger de-
tector called an anticoincidence mantle. The mantle is often made of Nal(Tl),
but can be a plastic scintillator. Ports are provided in the mantle to pro-
vide access for the Ge(Li) detector and a beam of gamma rays. The gamma
beam is allowed to hit the Ge(Li) but not the mantle. Gamma rays that lose
all their energy in the Ge(Li) produce a pulse (count) in the full energy
peak, Most of the gamma rays that scatter out of the Ge(Li) detector will
be detected by the mantle. For such events, pulses are detected simultane-
ously in both detectors. By proper electronic gating the spectrometer can
be made to reject these coincident pulses and store only those that occur
singly in the Ge(Li) detector. The resulting anticoincident spectrum has

a very large full energy peak but very low Compton distribution. Because

of the lower Compton distribution, the ability of the system to measure
low-energy photons in the presence of high-energy photons is greatly en-

hanced. An anticoincident spectrometry system has been used successfully
157

by Holm et al.?° in scanning reactor fuel elements and would have compar-
able merit in studies similar to our MSRE measurements.

The second suggested change in the spectrometry system pertains to an
improvement in the accumulation of spectra under transient conditions. Dur-
ing transient conditions, such as reactor startup, scram, or modifications
of fuel or salt chemistry, it is desirable to collect as much spectral data
as possible. To obtain suitable resolution of the large number of peaks
and permit computer processing of spectra, it is necessary to collect spec-
tra with a gain of about 0.7 keV or less per channel. However, with such a
gain a 4096-channel spectrum will only extend to about 3000 keV. Because
several of the short-lived fission products emit photons above 3000 keV,
their photopeaks will be missed. Under transient conditions there is not
enough time to obtain spectra at two different gain settings, and the higher
energy portion of the spectrum is lost. The total spectrum can be obtained
in two ways. First, a spectrometer system with about 7500 channels could
be used; this would permit measurement of the 5230-keV photon of °°Rb,
which is the highest energy photon among the fission products with half-
lives long enough to permit measurement in most experiments, Second, two
spectrometers, one with 4096 channels and another with 400 channels, could
be used. Because fission products emit only a few photons above 3000 keV,
it is unnecessary to collect spectra at low gains above this energy. The
two-spectrometer systems would be used by routing the signal from the de-
tector preamplifier to two amplifiers. One amplifier would be operated
at a gain of 0.75 keV per channel and its output processed by the 4096-
channel analyzer to produce a spectrum with an energy range of 0 to 3000
keV. The other amplifier would be operated at about 5 keV per channel and
its signal processed by the other analyzer. A zero-suppression amplifier
would be interposed between the main amplifier and the 400-channel analyzer
to suppress the lower 3000 keV. Pulses above 3000 keV would be processed
to yield a spectrum between 3000 and 5000 keV.

With either of the above schemes, spectra could be obtained over the
full energy range of fission product photons, and no information would be

lost during critical moments of transient reactor conditions.

Appendix A
TABLE OF RADIONUCLIDES

The successful analysis of the gamma-ray spectra, in particular the
identification of the nuclides, depends very much on the nuclear data stored
in the nuclide library of the spectrum analysis program. Considerable
effort was expended in preparing a table of radionuclides for this library,
based on the most updated information from the Nuclear Data Project located
at ORNL. Since the absolute nuclide concentrations calculated by the com-
puter program depend on the supplied nuclear data, we believed it to be use-
ful to include this table. In case better nuclear data that are significantly

different become available, the results presented in Chapter 7 should be

changed accordingly.

PRODUCTION AND STANDARDIZATION OF *'°MAg IN SILVER TUBING
FOR MSRE GAMMA SPECTROMETRY

Silver tubing was irradiated in the Oak Ridge Research Reactor (ORR)
to produce a cylindrical source (6.1 in. long, 0.5 in. OD, and 0.035 in.
wall thickness) of about 24 Ci of '*°™Ag. Gamma spectra of the source,
placed in a mockup of the MSRE heat exchanger, were made to obtain a curve
of counting efficiency versus photon energy for resolution of spectra of
fission products in MSRE components. Since ''°®7Ag has several peaks in
the energy range from 446 to 1562 keV of well-known energy and abundance,
this source is very suitable for efficiency calibrations.

Irradiations were made in hydraulic tubes of the ORR. Because of the
large effect of the silver tubing on the reactivity of the ORR, only 2.3 in.
of tubing could be irradiated in a single hydraulic tube at any one time.
It was estimated that rapid withdrawal of a longer section of tubing would
scram the reactor. No provision was available for slow withdrawal. Since
a source at least 6 in. long was desired, it was decided to expedite the
source production by irradiating three 2.3-in. sections in three separate
hydraulic tubes (12, 13, and 25). To ensure that the silver tube sections
were exposed to equal neutron fluences and that the neutron flux gradients
were not excessive in the hydraulic tubes, Co-Al flux-monitor foils were
irradiated first, and results obtained from measurements on these were used
to adjust the irradiation times of the silver tubes for equal neutron flu-
ences. Details of all measurements and source preparation and evaluation

are given below.

Flux Monitors

Flux monitors were prepared by cutting 3/8- by 2-in. sections from a
0.01-in. foil of cobalt-aluminum alloy containing 0.147 cobalt, The foils
were weld-sealed in aluminum rabbits and irradiated 20 min in hydraulic
tubes 12, 13, and 25 on May 6, 1969, After irradiation, the foils were
weighed and their °°Co contents measured by gamma spectrometry using a

Nal detector. The total areas of both the 1.,17- and 1.33-MeV peaks were
182

taken as a measure of the ®°Co content. The final results, which are given
in Table B.l, were reduced to counts per milligram of foil. The values in
the table were used to normalize the irradiation times of the silver tube

sections to expose the tubes to equal neutron fluences.

D-12 95.7 46,771 488.7
D-13 103.5 48,484 468.4

 

To obtain a measure of the neutron flux gradient in the hydraulic
tubes, sections of about 1/4 in, were cut from the ends and middle of each
foil, weighed, and assayed for ¢°Co by gamma spectrometry. The count rates
of each foil were compared with the count rate of a standard ¢9Co source
to permit calculation of their disintegration rates and the neutron fluxes
to which the foil sections were exposed. These results are given in Table

B.2.

Silver Tube Irradiation

 

From previous experience it was estimated that the activity of the
source tube should be in the order of 3.5 to 4.5 Ci of '*°™Ag per inch
of tube.

The amount of **°™Ag, 4, that would be formed in 1 in. of silver
tubing after one week of exposure to a flux of 2 x 10** neutrons cm—?

sec™' was calculated by

Measurement of **°"Ag in Silver Tube Sections

After irradiation, the rabbits containing the silver tubes were trans-
ferred to a hot cell and loaded into the source holder shown in Fig. 5.1.
The silver tubes irradiated in hydraulic tubes 12, 13, and 25 will be de-
noted as samples 12, 13, and 25 respectively. Because it was desirable
to maintain the length of the final source as long as possible, the center
sections of only two tubes were removed. Since the flux gradient in hy-
draulic tube 12 was the smallest, the center section of this silver tube
was left in place. The order of placement of the silver tubes in the
source holder was 13, 12, and 25.

The center section of silver tubes 13 and 25 were dissolved in separate
l-liter volumetric flasks containing nitric acid. The solutions were di-
luted with distilled water and mixed well, and aliquots of 10 ml were taken
from each, placed in other l-liter flasks, and diluted to capacity. From
these solutions aliquots of 5 ml were taken for analysis. From each of
these final solutions, three aliquots of 0.1 ml were assayed for *'°"Ag by
gamma spectrometry using a Ge(Li) detector. The peak area of the 657-keV

gamma ray of ''°"Ag was measured. The photon emission rates of the ''°"Ag

samples were obtained by comparing their count rates with the count rate

of a *®7Cs source of known photon emission rate, The results of these

measurements are given in Table B.4.

ABSOLUTE EFFICIENCY CURVES OF THE GAMMA-RAY DETECTION SYSTEM
USED FOR THE CALCULATION OF ABSOLUTE AMOUNTS OF NUCLIDES DEPOSITED

We intended to keep the detector system counting dead time more or
less constant (between 15 and 25%). Since the intensity of radiation from
the various measured components differed and varied with time, we adjusted
the shielding configurations to obtain a relatively constant count rate.
Tables C.l and C.2 present the various shielding configurations employed
in surveying the primary heat exchanger and the main reactor off-gas line
(jumper line). Figures C.1l to C.3 present the efficiency curves used in

CALCULATIONS OF COUNTING EFFICIENCIES FROM FIRST PRINCIPLES

Objective

We have computed from first principles counting efficiencies for the
MSRE main off-gas line (see Sect. 5.4) and the MSRE heat exchanger (see
Sect. 5.5). Initially we believed that such calculations could be done by
models that were of necessity so simplified that only gross agreement be-
tween theory and experiment would be achieved. However, this has not been
the case; very close agreement has been found over a wide gamma-energy
range. Although significant differences still exist below 200 keV and
above 1500 keV (prcbably still due to the simplified calculational model),

the calculations serve to confirm the validity of the empirical calibrations.

MSRE Main Off-Gas Line

 

Since the MSRE main off-gas line was only 1 in. in diameter we used
a line source as a model in our calculations. The physical configuration
of the detector-collimator-source is shown in Fig. D,1. Distances of items

labeled in the figure are as follows:

12 in. = 30.48 cm,
0.317 cm,

L., = geometrical collimator length

D = collimator diameter = 1/8 in.

o
-

i

= distance from source to source face of collimator = 15 ft =
457 cm ,

L

length of source subtended by collimator.

Due to penetration of the edges of the collimator on both source and de-
tector ends, the length of the source subtended by the collimator is not
constant but depends on the gamma-ray energy. Mather, in a study of col-
limators found that, to a first approximation, the effect of edge penetra-
tion is to reduce the length of the collimator by two mean free paths of

the gamma photons. The effective collimator length L, thus can be computed

by

Fig. D.1. Schematic of detector—collimator—line source arrangement.

Z, = Leo = 2/u, ’ (1

where Hy is the linear attenuation coefficient for the collimator material
(lead).

The subtended source length can then be obtained from

2D

L
= c <
L = I (H + >) . (2)

Thus, in our experimental arrangement, the source length subtended varied

from 3.8 in. for 200-keV photons to 4.4 in. for 2000-keV photons.

Let 5, = source strength per inch = 1 gamma in.~* sec~! and
4, = geometrical area of collimator hole,
7 (0.317% cm = 0.07197 en’.

Then if we consider a differential source length, dx, at point x on the

source, the photon intensity dG due to dx at the distance H + Loo (source-

to-detector distance) is given by
dc = —t (3)
4n(H +L )?
co

If the collimator were not between the source and the detector, the photon

current (due to dG) that would hit the detector over an area 4, would be

dr = 4 _ dG.
e

However, since the collimator is present, only those photons emitted from
the central portion of the source can go through any portion of the de-
tector end of the collimator hole. Photons emitted by parts of the source
that are off the source~collimator axis are partially shadowed from the
detector by the collimator and can only go through a fraction of the area
4, Thus Eq. (2) must be multiplied by the fraction of the area 4 that

is not shadowed by the collimator. Let this fraction be E(x), and we have

dl = A R(x) dG (4)

where R(x) is a function of the distance x that the segment dx lies from
the collimator axis.

Now the quantity R(x) is a radial weighting function and corresponds
to the F(x) of Section 5.3. Although R(x) is a gaussian-type function, we
can approximate it by a linear function that has a value of unity at the
center of the source and a value of zero at a distance L/2 from the axis.
Within these boundary values, R(x) is given by

R(x) = 1 — 2

7 » (5)

Thus by combining Eqs. (3), (4), and (5), we have an expression for the

photon current dI that leaves the segment dx and hits the detector, viz.,

We can now integrate this expression and obtain an equation for the total

Since the photon current through an area equal to a, without the collimator

being present is

2
4m (H + I.’

we see that collimator shadowing for a line source allows only one-half
of the photons directed toward the collimator exit hole (detector end of
collimator) to be transmitted through the collimator. The fraction of

photons P' that interact with the detector is given by

P' = 1 — exp (“Ugo Doe y , (8)

where u is mass attenuation coefficient of germanium (cm®/g), Die is

Ge
density of germanium (5.33 g/cm®), and Y is diameter of the germanium de-

tector (2.7 cm). Thus the total count rate in the detector is given by

CR = IP', (9)
198

To obtain the count rate in the photopeak, we must multiply by the fraction
of the counts that fall in the photopeak. Because these peak-to-total
ratios are difficult to calculate, we used values that were measured with
our collimated detector with the sources °'Cr, *®’Cs, *2v, and 2°Al. These
sources each emit single gamma rays with energies of 320, 662, 1434 and
1778 keV respectively. The corresponding peak-to-total ratios found were
0.195, 0.106, 0.0551, and 0.046. When these peak-to-total values were
plotted versus energy on log-log coordinate paper, a straight line was ob-

tained that could be represented by

Pp = 26.828 0-821 (10)

where P is the peak-to-total ratio for photons with energy ZF.

Now, combining Eqs. (2), (7), (9), and (10), we have for the count rate,

(11)
Since the counting efficiency EF is simply
EF = =

and 5 is assumed to be 1 gamma in.”' sec *, the right side of Eq. (11) is

also equal to the counting efficiency.

A computer program was written to evaluate Eq. (11) and obtain count-
ing efficiencies at several energies over a range from 100 to 2700 keV.
The program allowed for photon transmission through the edges of the col-
limator according to Egs. (1) and (2). Results of the calculated effici-

encies are shown in Table D.1l, along with experimental values. As can be

seen from the table, agreement between calculated and measured efficiencies

is good from 200 to 1300 keV; below 200 keV the difference becomes very large.

MSRE Heat Exchanger

The MSRE heat exchanger® is composed of a 16 3/4=-in.-OD shell that
encloses a 14,5-in. diam tube bundle. The shell is made of Hastelloy N
and is 1/2 in. thick; the tube bundle, also made of Hastelloy N, consists
of 156 cooling U-tubes (312 tubes) plus twenty-three 1/2-in. dummy rods.

A typical cross section also contains eight 7/16-in, baffle-plate spacer
rods. Although these tubes and rods coated with fission products represent
a complex radioactive source, we have calculated counting efficiencies for
the heat exchanger using a model in which the tubes and their radioactive
coatings are assumed to be homogeneously dispersed throughout the tube
bundle.

The detector—collimator—heat exchanger arrangement is schematically
represented in Fig. D.2. The source region subtended in the heat exchanger
is a truncated cone with a front face diameter of 3.9 in. and a back face
diameter of 4.3 in. As in the case of the line source, because of trans-
mission of photons through the collimator edges around the collimator hole,
the diameter of the subtended area increases with increasing energy. This
effect is actually larger in the heat exchanger because of attenuation in
the heat exchanger tubes and shell. However, we will neglect the latter
effect and only acccunt for collimator edge transmission in the same manner
as before. Thus, the diameter of the subtended area will be determined
according to Eqs. (1) and (2). In addition, we will approximate the trun-
cated cone by a cylinder with a diameter equal to that of the front face
(detector end) of the cone. This approximation is reasonable since most

of the radiation measured comes from the front portions of the cone.

a cone-shaped source region in heat exchanger.

Because the collimator partially shadows all but the central portion
of the source from the detector, we must again obtain an average radial
weighting function for the radiation transmitted through the collimator.
Because this function is dependent only on the distance from the source-
collimator axis (and not on depth of the source), we can derive the func-
tion for a two-dimensional, circular area source. Consider the front face
of the cone with a differential area, p dp dO, located a distance p from
the source-collimator axis. The photon current dI through the collimator

due to this area is given by

dl = —————— R(p) pop dp do , (12)

4n(H + L.)

where Sy is the source strength per unit area and R(p) is the radial weight-
ing function. Other terms were previously defined.

We approximate R(p) by a linear function that is unity at the source

center and zero at the circumference. Thus
202

p

(13)

Substituting this result into Eq. (12) and integrating, we have for the

The photon current through an equivalent area A, without the collimator

4m (H + LJ)?
We see therefore that the collimator transmits only one-third of the pho-
tons directed toward its exit (detector side) hole.

We must now account for the fraction of those photons that are produced
in the source and directed toward the collimator that actually pass through
the source without being degraded. Consider the cross-sectional slice
(Fig. D.2) through the cone of thickness dx and at distance x from the

3 sec-ly,

cone's front face. Denoting the source strength as Sy (photons cm™
we obtain for the fraction dF of photons from the slice transmitted dis-
tance x

dF = 5, Ag eH a ,

where Ag is the area of the circular source surface facing the detector,
u is mass attenuation coefficient of Hastelloy N (taken as iron), and D is
average density of the MSRE tube bundle. Integrating over the diameter T

where P' is the fraction of photons transmitted through the heat exchanger
shell; other terms have previously been defined.

Once we have derived values for the volumetric source strength Sy and
the average density of the MSRE tube bundle, we can use Eq. (16) to compute
the counting efficiency for the heat exchanger. Because our experimental
efficiencies were expressed as counts per photon per square centimeter of
tube, we assume that each square centimeter of tube in the tube bundle emits

2 sec™!, From the number of tubes in the bundle and the bundle

1 photon cm™
diameter, we obtain a value of 1.09 cm? of tubing per cubic centimeter of
bundle. Thus Sy = 1.09 photons em™3 sec~!. Similarly we compute, for

the average density of metal in the bundle, D = 0.976 g/cm3. The count-

ing efficiency is

2 1

where S, = 1 photon cm™ sec™'.

A computer program was written to evaluate the counting efficiency at
several energies over the energy range 100 to 2700 keV and also to compute
the counting efficiency for an area source corresponding to the inner sur-
face of the heat exchanger shell. The results of our computations are sum-

marized in Table D,2, along with the experimentally measured efficiencies.

As can be seen, the agreement between calculated and measured efficiency
values is excellent between 400 and 1500 keV, The contribution of the
heat exchanger shell varies from about 12% at 200 keV to about 4% at 2700
keV. The effect of the shell was not accounted for in our empirical cali-

bration but can now be seen to be a negligible factor.
