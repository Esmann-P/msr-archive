EFFECTS OF IRRADIATION ON THE MECHANICAL PROPERTIES OF
TWO VACUUM-MELTED HEATS OF HASTELLOY N

 

 

H. E. McCoy, Jr.

ABSTRACT

The mechanical behavior of two vacuum-melted heats
of Hastelloy W was evaluated at 650 and 760°C. The
material was subjected to several thermal-mechanical
treatments and then irradiated at 650 and 760°C to a
thermal dose of 2.3 x 10%° neutrons/cm?. The results
are compared with those for unirradiated specimens that
were given a similar thermal treatment. The various
thermal -mechanical treatments had some relatively small
effects on the unirradiated tensile properties, but the
creep properties were very similar. The primary effects
of irradiation were reductions in the creep-rupture
life and the rupture ductility in both creep and tensile
tests. These observations are explained on the basis of
helium production in the metal by the 108(n,w) transmutation.

 

INTRODUCTION

The potential use of Hastelloy N in several reactors has developed
considerable interest in how the properties of this material change
with neutron irradiation. Previous studies at ORNL's? have shown that
the high-temperature mechanical properties of this alloy deteriorate
under neutron irradiation. This deterioration manifests itself as both
a reduction in the creep-rupture life and in the rupture ductility.
However, these studies involved air-melted material with B levels in the

range of 20 to 50 ppm.

We have recently run two series of experiments that were aimed
primarily at characterizing this alloy for use in the SNAP-8 system.
This system will utilize thin-walled Hastelloy N tubing for fuel element
cladding and will operate over the temperature range of 650 to 760°C.
One series of experiments involved in-reactor tube-burst tests on cladding
material, and the details of this study have been reported. > The second
series of experiments involved postirradiation creep rupture and tensile
tests on small bar samples, and these results are presented in this
report. Two vacuum-melted heats were used, and the properties were
evaluated after the material had been subjected to various thermal-
mechanical treatments. These treatments were dictated largely by the

steps used to process the fuel element cladding.

EXPERIMENTAL: DETATLS

Test Materials

The two lots of material used in this study were 12-in.-diam,
10,000-1b double vacuum-melted heats obtained from Allvac Metals Company.
The chemical analysis of each heat is given in Table 1. Heat 5911 was
obtained in two forms: forged to a bar 2 x 2 in. (designated 5911 AW)
and forged and machined to a tube shell 2-in. OD x 1 1/2-in. ID
(designated 5911 TH). Heat 6252 was obtained in the as-cast condition
(designated 6252 AC).

Heat Treatments

The materials were given several different mechanical and thermal
treatments prior to irradiation. These treatments are described in
Table 2 and will be referred to by number. All annealing was carried
out in an argon environment, and the specimens were cooled by pulling

them into a water-cooled section at the end of the furnace.

Test Specimen

The small tensile specimen shown in Fig. 1 was used for in- and ex-
reactor tests. The small size made it possible to get several specimens
into a single experiment. Our work with this specimen has shown that it
yields data that are quite similar to those obtained from larger specimens.
Because of the stress concentration at the base of the filet, there is

some tendency for the brittle specimens to fail at this point.

Irradiation Conditions

The specimens were irradiated in a single-test capsule in the P-4
poolside position in the ORR.

(time at temperature and full power), so the thermal and fast doses were
2.3 x 10° and 1.9 x 101° neutrons/cm?, respectively. Fach specimen was
heated by a small furnace, and the temperature was controlled by a
proportioning controller which acted on response to a Chromel-P-Alumel
thermocouple attached to the specimen gage length. Some of the specimens
were controlled at 650°C, but most of them were held at 760°C. The
environment in the capsule was flowing He-1% Op. Ex-reactor control

specimens were given the same thermal exposure as the in-reactor specimens.

Testing Techniques

The laboratory creep-rupture tests were run in conventional creep
machines of the dead load and lever arm types. The strain was measured
by a dial indicator that showed the total movement of the specimen and
part of the load train. The zero strain measurement was taken immediately
after the load was applied. The temperature accuracy was #0.75%, the
guaranteed accuracy of the Chromel-P-Alumel thermocouples used.

The postirradiation creep-rupture tests were run in lever arm
machines that were located in hot cells. The strain was measured by an
extensometer with rods attached to the upper and lower specimen grips.
The relative movement of these two rods was measured by a linear dif-
ferential transformer, and the transformer signal was recorded. The
accuracy of strain measurements is difficult to determine. The exten-
someter (mechanical and electrical portions) produced measurements that
could be read to about #0.02% strain. However, other factors (temperature
changes in the cell, mechanical vibrations, etc.) probably combined to
give an overall accuracy of 0.1% strain. This is considerably better
than the specimen-to-specimen reproducibility that one would expect for
relatively brittle materials. The temperature measuring and control
system was the same as that used in the laboratory with one exception.
In the laboratory, the control system was gtabilized at the desired
temperature by use of a recorder with an expanded scale. In the tests
in the hot cells, the control point was established by setting the
controller without the aid of the expanded-scale recorder. This error
and the thermocouple accuracy combine to give a temperature uncertainty

of about 1%.
The tensile tests were run on Instron Universal Testing Machines.
The strain measurements were taken from the crosshead travel.

The test environment was air in all cases. Metallographic exami-
nation showed that the depth of oxidation was small (< 0.002 in.), and
hence, we feel that the envirorment did not appreciably influence the

test results.

Experimental Results

The results of tensile tests run on the materials in this study
are summarized in Tables 3 and 4. All of the unirradiated specimens
were subjected to a thermal aging treatment (1080 hr at 650 or 760°C)
equivalent to that of the irradiated specimens. The data in Table 3
indicate several important features of the tensile properties of the
unirradiated materials.

1. The yield stress decreases slightly with increasing test

temperature, whereas the tensile stress decreases by about
a factor of 2 over the temperature range of 550 to 760°C.
2. There appear to be some small variations in the yield

and tensile strengths due to the various heat treatments.
For example, the data for heat 5911 AW-anneal 1 indicate
that aging at 650°C results in lower yield stress and a
higher tensile stress than aging at 760°C. The anneals

at 1260°C (3A and 2A) cause slight strength reductions.

3. The fracture ductility decreases with increasing test

temperature for all materials.
4. The data for 5911 AW-anneal 1 indicate that aging at
650°C results in better ductility than aging at 760°C.

5. A comparison of the data for 5911 AW-anneals 1 and 3
indicate that the ductility of the materials receiving
the anneal 3 is lower when aged and tested at 650°C
and higher at 760°C.

6. Heat 6252 AC generally exhibited lower ductility than

heat 5911. This is probably due to the smaller amount
of working received by heat 6252 AC. This is supported

by the fact that the additional working received in the
2 + 3 treatment improved the ductility over that obtained
after just the treatment 2.
The tensile properties of some of the materials were obtained at
650 and 760°C after irradiation, and these results are given in Table 4.
A comparison of these data with those for the unirradiated specimens in
Table 3 leads to several important observations:
1. The yield stress at 650°C is higher for the irradiated
specimens whereas the yield stress at 760°C is equivalent
for irradiated and unirradiated specimens.
2. The tensile stress is lower for the irradiated materials
at both 650 and 760°C.
3. The ductility at both temperatures is reduced severely
by irradiation, the reduction being much greater at 760°C.

conditions investigated are summarized in Fig. 2. The spread in the rupture

strain at a given test temperature is quite large. At 650°C, for example,
the unirradiated material shows a range of about 15 to 44%, and the range
is further extended by values as low as 5% in the irradiated condition.

The main emphasis in this study was on the creep-rupture properties,
since the potential application involves service under creep conditions.
The results of tests on unirradiated and irradiated specimens are given
in Tables 5 and 6, respectively. The data on unirradiated materials are
of value themselves, but we are more concerned with how the properties
change as a result of irradiation. Figure 3 shows that the rupture
ductility varies from about 15 to 30% for the unirradiated material at
650°C. However, many of the variations appear to be random rather than
due to the effects of a particular pretest heat treatment. The general
trend seems to be for decreasing ductility with increasing rupture life.
Figure 4 compares the rupture lives of unirradiated and irradiated
specimens at 650°C. The line for the irradiated material is based on
our results for several air-melted heats. The results on the present heat
at 650°C are inadequate to establish a stress-rupture curve, but the data
are in reasonable agreement with those for the air melts. The rupture life
variations appear to be entirely random with respect to material and
conditions of annealing. The rupture life is reduced by an order of
magnitude by irradiation, but there is some indication that this factor
decreases with increasing rupture life. The minimum creep rate is shown
in Pig. 5 as a function of the stress at 650°C for irradiated and unirra-
diated materials. The variation due To heat and anneal is again random
and irradiation does not have any appreciable effect.

The rupture strain at 760°C is shown in Fig. 6 as a function of
rupture life for unirradiated material. The rupture strain varies from
10 to 50% with most of the variation appearing to be independent of
heat and annealing treatment. Most of the materials exhibit a trend
of increasing strain with increasing rupture life. The rupture lives
of the irradiated and unirradiated materials are compared in Fig. 7.
Again, the variations due to heat and anneal appear to be random. One
exception may be heat 6252 AC, which, after irradiation, has a greater
rupture life. At a stress level of 20,000 psi, the rupture life is

reduced about two orders of magnitude by irradiation. The curves converge

slightly as the stress level is reduced. The minimum creep rates of the
irradiated and unirradiated specimens are compared in Fig. 8. At a stress
level of 20,000 psi, the creep rate of the irradiated material is higher.
As the stress is decreased, the curves converge to where the difference
in creep rate below 10,000 psi is negligible.
The rupture strains of the irradiated specimens are compared in
Fig. 9 as a function of strain rate. Although the tensile tests at a
strain rate of 0.002 min~% (12%/hr) indicated that the ductility was
much lower at 760°C than at 650°C, the ductility appears to be independent
of temperature at strain rates below about 0.1%/hr. There is also a
distinct trend of increasing fracture strain with decreasing strain rate.
Although all of the creep curves were examined in detail, only a
few typical ones will be presented. The data were taken manually, but
were reduced and plotted by computer. Figures 10, 11, 12, and 13 are
direct photographs of the plotted data after the curves were drawn in
manually. Figures 10 and 11 show the results of tests on unirradiated
and irradiated specimens, respectively, from heat 5911 AW-anneal 1 at
650°C and 40,000 psi. The primary creep stage is very short, and the
accumulated strain at the beginning of secondary creep was only about

0.1%. A comparison of points on the two plots indicates that the results

are quite similar up to the point where the irradiated specimen failed.
Figures 12 and 13 show the results of tests at 760°C and 10,000 psi on
unirradiated and irradiated specimens, respectively. There is no dis-
tinguishable primary creep stage, and the results are quite comparable
up to fracture of the irradiated specimen.

Since considerable data were obtained on heats 5911 AW and 5911 TH
with heat treatment 1, the creep properties of these materials were
examined in detail. Further details of the creep behavior are given in
Table 7. At 650°C the behavior of the two lots of material was quite
similar. The times for rupture and 1% strain for unirradiated and irra-
diated material at 650°C are compared in Fig. 14. The curve for rupture
of the irradiated material falls just short of the 1% strain curve for
the unirradiated specimens. At 760°C materials 5911 AW and 5911 TH have
slightly different strength properties. Figure 15 shows the results for
heat 5911 AW-anneal 1. At 8000 psi, the time to 1% strain for the irra-
diated specimen agrees very well with that for the unirradiated material.
At 10,000 psi, the time to 1% strain for the irradiated material is
slightly less than that for the unirradiated specimen. The data for
heat 5911 TH-anneal 1 are plotted in Fig. 16. The time to 1% strain for
the irradiated material is much shorter than that for the unirradiated
material at high stresses, but the two nearly converge at lower stresses.
This behavior agrees well with the minimum creep rate behavior shown
in Fig. 8. There is some uncertainty in Fig. 16 concerning the location
of the curve for the time to 1% strain. Since an extensometer was not
used in the laboratory tests, the scatter in data for small strains is
understandable.

In an effort to determine the effects of strain rate on the rupture
ductility at 650 and 760°C, several specimens were tested in the unaged
condition at various strain rates. The results of these tests are
given in Table 8. The tensile results from Tables 3 and 8 and the creep
results from Table 5 were used to obtain the plot of ductility versus

strain rate in Fig. 17. At 650°C the ductility decreases with decreasing

strain rate. At high strain rates, the ductility is lower at 760°C than
at 650°C and decreases with decreasing strain rate. A minimum is reached
at a strain rate of about 10%/hr and an increase in ductility occurs

as the strain rate is decreased further.

Our metallographic studies were confined to the unirradiated ten-
gile specimens that were aged and tested at 650 and 760°C at a strain
rate of 0.002 min~t. The failures were all intergranular at 760°C. At
650°C extensive intergranular cracking occurred, and the failures were
predominantly intergranular even though some areas failed by trans-
granular shear. The microstructure of a specimen from heat 5911 AW-
anneal 1 after aging and testing at 650°C is shown in Fig. 18. The
grain size is relatively coarse with stringers, probably of the MgC type.
The microstructure of heat 5911 AW-anneal 3 is shown in Fig. 19. The cold
working and recrystallization of this material has resulted in the forma-
tion of bands of small grains and a "ghost" structure in which fine
precipitates mark the boundaries of the original grains before recrystal-
lization. The coarse microstructure of heat 5911 AW-anneal 3A is shown
in Fig. 20. The "feathery" growth is probably fine carbides that have
reprecipitated. These were not visible in the specimen aged at 650°C.
Small amounts of the same product were visible in the other heat 5911 AW
specimens that were aged at 760°C. The microstructure of heat 5911 TH-

anneal 1 after aging and testing at 650°C is shown in Fig. 21. The grain

size is quite similar to that of heat 5911 AW~-anneal 1 (Fig. 18), but the
curved twin boundaries are indicative of the more complex and extensive
working of the tube hollow.

Heat 6252 AC was not homogenized adequately by any of the heat
treatments used. This material was received as a section cut from an
as-cast 12-in.-diam billet. Figure 22 shows the microstructure after
anneal 2 and aging and testing at 650°C. A lamellar phase and the
typical carbide stringers have been "smeared" through the metal in a
very inhomogenous manner. Figure 23 shows that the working of treatments
2 + 3 improved the homogeneity but not sufficiently to yield a typical
microstructure. Figure 24 shows that the higher temperature encountered
in anneal 2A increased the grain size, but only increased the degree

of segregation.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

The effects of several variables on the unirradiated properties of
Hastelloy N were investigated. The dramatic decrease in tensile ductility
with increasing test temperature is a characteristic of this alloy.*
However, the exact mechanism of the ductility minimum is not understood.
Our results showed that the ductility is very strain rate dependent over
certain ranges of temperature and strain rate. For example, Fig. 17 shows
that the rupture strain at high strain rates is greater at 650°C than at
760°C, and at low strain rates the converse is true. The changes in
tensile properties as a result of varying the anneal and the aging treat-
ment (650 or 760°C) are relatively small for such a complex alloy.
Although adequate work was not done to support this conclusion, these
changes are probably due to variations in grain size and the concentration
and morphology of grain-boundary carbides. Under creep conditions, all
the variables investigated seem to have very minor effects (Figs. 3-8).
Although the results obtained on heat 6252 AC generally agreed with those
for the other materials, several tests exhibited low ductility. The
photomicrographs shown in Figs. 22-24 demonstrate the inhomogeneous nature
of heat 6252 AC. None of the mechanical and thermal treatments were
adequate to homogenize the alloy. Thus, the scatter in test results is
as expected.

The main object of these experiments was to determine the properties
of Hastelloy N after irradiation. Irradiation changed the properties in
the following ways:

1. At 650°C the yield stress was increased and the tensile

stress was decreased.

2. At 760°C the yield stress was unaffected and the tensile

stress was reduced.

3. The stress-rupture life was reduced, the effect being

greater at 760°C than at 650°C.

4. The minimum creep rate was unaffected at 650°C but was

increased at 760°C.

the Tensile Properties of Hastelloy N, ORNL-3661 (August 1964).

5. The rupture strain was lowered in both tensile and creep-
rupture tests, with the minimum strain occurring at a
strain rate of 1 to 10%/hr.
We shall discuss each of these observations separately, after we have
discussed high-temperature deformation in general terms.
At high temperatures there are at least two types of intergranular
failures that are reported: (a) wedge or triple point fracture and
(b) cavitation. The wedge crack forms when the stress concentration at
the end of a sliding boundary is sufficient to locally exceed the fracture
stress. Strohds® developed an analytical expression for the value of

the critical shear stress, 1, required to form a crack under these

 

conditions

T = J nT, 3 (1)
where
v = the effective surface energy
G = the shear modulus,
L = the length of the sliding interface (normally taken to be the

grain diameter at high temperatures).
Cavitation is a term used to describe the formation of small inter-
granular voids and the linking of these voids to form cracks. Numerous
mechanisms have been proposed for the nucleation of these voids, however,

they all require plastic deformation.”

Once nucleated, the cavities grow
by the ingress of vacancies. Balluffi and Seigle® developed an expression

for the stabllity of the void under an applied stress

When the stress becomes less than that required to satisfy this equality,

the void will decrease in size. If the stress is greater, the void will

grow as rapidly as the supply of vacancies will allow.

Hull and Rimmer? developed an expression for the kinetics of failure
by the growth of these voids due to the stress induced diffusion of
vacancies along the grain boundaries. Their model assumed a constant
number of void nuclei that grew as spheres. The time to rupture, ts

was related to the applied stress, o, and other factors

Hull and Rimmer found in their experimental work with impure copper that
it was necessary to allow the void spacing, a, to decrease with increasing
stress in order to obtain reasonable agreement between Eq. (3) and their
experimental data. The activation energy was found to be less than that
for bulk diffusion, so grain-boundary diffusion was assumed to be the
rate controlling process.

Although the wedge and the cavitation fractures appear distinctly

different when viewed in the optical microscope, we recently performed

some work with tungsten? that makes us question whether they result from
basically different mechanisms. The stressed tungsten specimens were
fractured intergranularly and the surfaces replicated to study the
detalls of the deformation. All of the cracks seemed to be nucleated by
intergranular voids. At high stresses and relatively low temperatures,
the voids linked together to form cracks that appeared wedge-shaped in
the optical microscope. At low stresses and high temperatures, the voids
grew to quite large sizes as voids and linked together primarily by
impingement. Hence, the different appearance of cracks may be influenced
more strongly by the local stress concentrations available to propagate
them than by differences in the mechanism of crack nucleation. Thus,
even though the cracks in the Hastelloy N specimens appear to be wedge-
shaped, we should still be concerned with how voids nucleate and grow in
this alloy.

Iet us now consider how neutron irradiation can alter the high-
temperature deformation processes in this material. When the alloy is
irradiated at temperatures in excess of about one-half the absolute
melting point, the atoms have high mobility and the atoms displaced by
fast neutrons are able to return to their normal lattice positions.
However, many experimenters have shown that structural materials irradiated
even at high temperatures exhibit reduced rupture ductility when tested
at elevated temperatures. This effect has been correlated with the thermal
neutron exposure and more specifically with the helium that is formed by
the 108(n, a) transmutation. l The boron, because of its size and low

12 The recoil

solubility, is initially segregated at the grain boundaries.
range of the o-particle produced by transmutation is 2 pu (ref. 13)

so most of the helium will lie in the proximity of the grain boundaries.
The solubility of the helium in the metal is very low and most of it
will be precipitated as small bubbles along the grain boundaries. The

size of a spherical gas bubble must satisfy the following equality

If a tensile stress, o, 1s now applied perpendicular to the boundary

It can be shown that the critical stress, Ons that must be applied for

unlimited growth to occur is given by

By comparing Eqs. (2) and (6), it is apparent that the applied stress to

allow a bubble to grow without bound is only about one-third that required

for the growth of an empty void of the same size.

Thus, the presence of helium results in the formation of small gas
bubbles that can serve as void nuclei. These nuclei can grow by the
stress induced migration of vacancies and the applied stress necessary
for their growth is reduced by the presence of helium. Russel and Velal%
have attempted to develop an equation similar to that of Hull and Rimmer

[Eq. (3)] for predicting the time to rupture with the complicating factors
of a gas in the void and lenticular growth of the voids. They obtained:

5 © OO

= the number of atoms within each bubble.

Although several questions have been raised about some of the assumptions
on which this equation is vased, 7 the factors being considered seem quite
reasonable and the equation is probably valid for qualitative arguments.
The temperature dependence shows up primarily in the diffusion coefficient
that varies exponentially with temperature. At a given temperature, the
factors that combine to determine whether a void can undergo growth are
the applied stress, the gas pressure in the void, and the surface energy.
These three factors appear in order in the bracketed portion of the
denominator of Eq. (7).

Tet us now discuss the various experimental observations that were
made. The increase in the yield stress at 650°C after irradiating at
650°C was not anticipated on the basis of previous work. 16 However, the
previous work involved air-melted materials irradiated at 700°C, and a
direct comparison cannot be made with the results of the present study.
This increase in yield stress is probably due to the formation of fine,
generally dispersed precipitates during irradiation. Since 650°C is
only approximately 0.55 of the absolute melting point of the alloy,
there is also a possibllity that some displacement defects such as dis-
location loops may be present. At 760°C the yield stress is unaffected.
The tensile stresses at both 650 and 760°C are reduced by irradiation.
This does not reflect a basic difference in the shape of the initial
portion of the stress-strain diagram for the irradiated and unirradiated
specimens, but is due simply to the premature failure of the irradiated
specimen before the normal tensile stress is reached.

The reduced rupture life under creep conditions is due to the effect
of helium on the processes responsible for forming wedge-shaped cracks and

for cavitation that we have just discussed in detail. The reason that the

39

effect is greater at 760°C than at 650°C is probably due to the greater
atomic mobility at 760°C. The motion of helium to the grain boundaries,
whether as atoms or small bubbles, will be quite sensitive to temperature.
For example, studies by Bloom and Stieglert? on type 304 stainless steel
have failed to disclose any bubbles in material irradiated at 650°C,

but have shown that the same material irradiated at 800°C contains
bubbles up to 700 A in diameter.

The convergence of the stress-rupture curves for the irradiated and
unirradiated materials at low stresses can be rationalized from Eq. (2).
The lower the stress, the larger a void must be to be stable. Thus, the
number of void nuclei of sufficient size to undergo extensive growth is
quite small in both irradiated and unirradiated materials and the defor-
mation processes in both approach each other at low stresses.

The reduction in ductility under tensile and creep conditions is
due basically to the accumulation of helium at the grain boundaries
causing premature fracture. At high strain rates, such as those
encountered in tensile tests, bulk deformation accounts for a large
portion of the total strain. The bulk deformation characteristics do not
seem to be affected significantly by irradiation at elevated temperatures
and the fracture strains for irradiated materials are fairly high. As the
strain rate is decreased, the conditions become more favorable for grain-

boundary deformation®®

and the ductility of the irradiated material
decreases rapidly. The minimum fracture strain observed in a creep

test with a creep rate of 1 to 10%/hr is likely due to the worst
combination of two factors: (1) low enough stress that the ratio of grain
boundary to bulk deformation is fairly high and (2) high enough stress to
cause many of the helium bubbles to grow. Decreasing the stress level
further causes the first factor to be more detrimental and the second
factor less detrimental; the rate of change of the second factor

apparently being less since the ductility improves slowly with decreasing

stress level.

Metals, Macmillan, New York, 1965.

 
40

The higher minimum creep rate of the irradiated material at 760°C
is difficult to explain, particularly since the rates converge at low
stresses. Since the fraction of strain due to bulk deformation increases
with stress and the grain boundary contribution decreases, it would appear
that bulk deformation can occur more easily in the irradiated material.
However, it would seem that this would result in a decrease in the yield
stress, which was not observed. Thus, this result is not presently

explained.

SUMMARY AND CONCTUSIONS

We evaluated the mechanical behavior of two heats of vacuum-melted
Hastelloy N in several metallurgical conditions before and after irra-
diation. The various mechanical-thermal treatments studied had some
small effects on the tensile properties, but the creep-rupture properties
were very similar.

The specimens were irradiated to a thermal dose of
2.3 x 102° neutrons/cn? at temperatures of 650 and 760°C. It was found
that:

1. At 650°C the yield stress was increased and the tensile

stress was decreased.

2. At 760°C the yield stress was unaffected and the tensile

stress was reduced.

3. The creep-rupture life was reduced, the effect being

greater at 760°C than at 650°C.

4. The minimum creep rate was unaffected at 650°C but was

increased at 760°C.

5. The rupture strain was lowered in both tensile and creep-

rupture tests, with the minimum occurring at a strain rate
of 1 to 10%/hr.
These results are consistent with our understanding of how helium

introduced by the 0B(n, a) reaction should influence the properties.
