PERICD MEASUREMENTS ON THE MOLTEN SALT REACTOR
EXPERIMENT DURING FUEL CIRCULATION:
THEORY AND EXPERIMENT

B. E. Prince

ABSTRACT

As an aid in interpreting the zero-power kinetics experi-
ments performed on the MSRE, a theory of period dependence on
the fuel circulation is developed from the general space de-
pendent reactor kinetics equations. A procedure for evaluat-
ing the resulting inhour-type equation by machine computation
is presented, together with numerical results relating the
reactivity to the observed asymptotic pericd, both with the
fuel circulating and with it stationary. Based on this analy-
sis, the calculated reactivity difference between the time
independent flux conditions for the noncirculating and the
circulating fuel states ig in close agreement with the value
inferred from the MSRE rod calibration experiments. Rod-bump
period measurements made with the fuel circulating were con-
verted to differential rod worth by use of this model. These
results are compared with similar rod sensitivity measurements
made with the fuel stationary. The rod sensitivities measured
under these two conditions agree favorably, within the limits
of precision of the period measurements. Due to the problem
of maintaining adequate precision, however, the period-rod
sensitivity measurements provide & less conclusive test of the
theoretical model than the reactivity difference between the
time independent flux conditions. Suggestions are made for
improving the precision of the experiments to provide sa more
rigid test of the theoretical model for the effects of cir-
culation on the delayed neutron kinetics.

1. INTRCDUCTION

It is well recognized that the circulation of fuel in a liquid
fueled reactor introduces some unique effects into its observable kinetic
behavior. Foremost in this category is the phenomenon cof emission of
delayed neutrons in the part of the circulating system external to the
reactor core where they do not contribute tc the chain reaction. The
literature in reactor kinetics contains several theoretical studies of
this effect,» 2223 but there have been few opportunities for parallel

experimental studies. The Molten Sait Reactor Experiment, hereafter
no

 

referred tc as the MSRE, has presented a unique chance to develop and
test some analytical models for the zero power kinetics of a circulating
fuel reactor. The experimental measurements discussed in this report
were made as part of an overall program to calibrate the control rods
in the MSRE.

In the first section following, we develop the theory of pericd
dependence on fuel circulation. The second section gives an account
of the results of applying this theory to the experimental measurements
mede during MSRE Run No. 3. Finally, in the third section, we discuss
the results of this work in terms of the general problem of kinetics
analysis for circulating fuel reactors. Several questions are left open @

by the present study, and these are discussed in that section.

2. THEORY OF ZERO POWER KINETICS DURING FUEL CIRCULATION

At negligible reactor power, the special effects produced by fuel
circulatior reduce essentially to (a) the transport of delayed neutron
precursors tc that part of the lcop external to the core where they

v decay, and (b) the shift of the spatial distribution of

J

3

subsequent
delayed neutron precursors in the direction of circulation within the
reacter core, relative to the prompt neutron production. Although we
shall not attempt to review all eariier studies pertaining to these
effects, twe fairly recent studies made by Wolfe® and Haubenreich® are
pertinent to the present work. Wolfe employs a perturbation approach and

obtains an irhour-type eguation for ar infinite slab reactor, through which .

7

“uel circulates in the direction of variation of the neutron flux. Wolfe's
sppreach, while valuzble, is almost entirely formal, and requires some
modification in order to obtain a procedure useful for the guantitative
analysis of experimental measurements. In the second of the above men-
tioned works, faubenreich considers an explicit analytical model rep-
resenting the MSRE in the circulating, just-critical condition. By means

of & modal analysis, he obtalng effective values for the delayed neutron

fractions for this conditicn. He uses a bare cylinder spproximation to

represent the MSRE core, with boundaries corresponding physically to the
channelled region of the actual core.

We have combined and extended these analyses to include the contri-
bution to the chain reaction of the delayed neutrons emitted while the
fuel is in the plenums Just sbove and below the graphite core, and to
include the case of the flux varying exponentially with a stable asymp-
totic period. It will be seen that an inhour-type equation results
which relates the period of a circulating fuel reactor to the static
reactivity of the same reactor configuration, but in which the fuel is

not circulating. The static reactivity, p_, is defined by the relation
2

Pp 2 me 3 (1)

in which v is the physical, energy-averaged number of neutrons emitted
per fission, and Vo is the fictitious value for which the reactor with
the same geometric and material configuration would be critical with
the fuel stationary. One finds that as a result of this definition, the
reactivity for a critical, circulating fuel condition is greater than
zero (here, criticality denotes the condition of time independence of
the neutron and precursor concentrations). However, since the static
reactivity is the quantity normslly obtained in reactor calculation
programs, it is most convenient to relate this quantity directly to the
asymptotic period.

The theory following is developed by beginning along general lines
and delineating special assumptions as they are introduced. Several of
these simplifying approximations are suitable for MSRE analysis, both in
the neutronics model and the flow model for the circulating fuel.

The starting point of the analysis 1s the general time dependent
reactor equations, written to include the transport of delayed neutron

precursors by fuel motion in the axial direction:

B, B® - A, ¢, - = (V6,) = 5p, 1 =1,2, ...,6 . (3)
The symbols ¢ and C represent the neutron flux and delayed neutron pre-
cursor densities. The operator IL represents net neutron loss (leakage,
absorption, and energy transfer by scattering), and P represents the
preduction processes by fission. The explicit representation of these
operators depends on the model used in analysis. If these processes
gre given their most general representation in terms of the Boltzman
transport equation, the neutron flux, ¢, will be a function of position,
energy, direction, and time variables. In order to provide a framework
for discussion which can be directly related to application, we shall
assure that the angular variables have been integrated from the equation,
i.e., that a model such as multigroup diffusion theory or its continucus
energy counterpart provides an adequate description of the neutron popu-
lation. In Eq. 3, above, P? is taken as zero in that part of the cir-
culating loop which is external to the chain reacting regions. The
remaining symbols in Egs. 2 and 3 are (1 - Bp) the fraction of all
neutrons from fission which are prompt, and B.: and Ags the production
fraction and decay constant for the ith precursor group. The quantities
ts and fat are energy spectrum operators which multiply the total volu-
metric production retes of prompt and delayed neutrons to obtain neutrons
of a specific energy. Finally, the symbols v snd V represent the neutron
velocity and the fliuld velocity, respectively.

As applied to a fluid fueled reactor with a heterogeneous structure
such as the MSRE (where the axial fuel channels are located in a matrix
of solid graphite moderator), the usual cellular homogenization must be

made on the neutron production and destruction rates. Thus, for example

(L ~ B.,) P2 = local rate of production of prompt fission
T
neutrons, per unit cell volume

Ay C, = local rate of production of ith group of delayed
neutrons, per unit cell volume.

If we assume that the operators L and P are time independent, corre-

ponding to a fixed rcd position, we can investigate the conditions under

 
 

which the flux and precursor densities in the reactor and the external

As previously stated, our primary objective is to relate the observed

stable reactor period, w , to the static reactivity of the given reactor
configuration. The static reactivity defined by Bg. 1 is the algebra-

ically largest eigenvalue of the equation:

p+ (1-0) FRE =0 (8)
where;

Rather than attempting to solve the reactor equations 6 and 7 directly,
we will make use of a procedure which is often useful for spatial reactor
kinetics problems. Several sources give details of similar analyses for
stationary fuel reactor systems (see, for example, Ref. 4). We multiply
the "local" equation for the neutron population by an appropriate weight-
ing function and integrate over the position and energy variables of the
neutron population in order to obtain a relation involving only "global"
or integral quantities. As seen below, by using the static adjoint flux,

+
2s the solution of the adjoint equation corresponding to Eg. 8 as the
weighting function, the resulting relation admits a direct physical inter-
pretation. The adjoint flux, also obtained in most reactor physics calcu-
lation programs in common usage, is the solution of

where I. and (Fp) " sre operators adjoint to L and fP of Eg. 8, and p, is
the same algebraically largest eigenvalue of Eq. 8. With appropriately
prescribed boundary conditions on the allowable functions on which these
operators are defined, the following relaticn® can be used to define the

population.

We may also note that the second term on the right hand side of Eq. Lk
appears as the difference between the weighted total production of de-
layed neutrons and the weighted production of delayed neutrons from
precursor decay within the reactor. In accordance with its definition
by Egs. 1 and 8, the static reactivity is completely determined by the
geometric snd material configuration of the reactor, whether or not the
fuel is circulating in the actual reactor. The relationship between 0,
and @ expressed by Eg. 1h, therefore, has an explicit physical inter-
pretation. For example, if the fuel composition and control rod position
are such that the flux is time independent when the fuel is circulating,
w= 0 in Egs. 6 and 7. Equation 1b then shows that the static reactivity
for the just critical reactor is numerically equal to the net difference
in the production of delayed neutrons described above. In the more gen-

Rr eral case when the flux is varying in time according tc a stabie period,
the first term on the right hand side of Eq. 14 will differ from zero,
and also the effective decrement in production of delayed neutrons will
differ numerically from the time independent case (ey and ¢ depend on
w through Egs. 6 and 7. Bquation 14 is an inhour type relation which
can te used as a foundation for an approximate determination of Pgs
given an observed asymptotic period, w . One may observe that it in-
cludes the usual inhour relation for the stationary fuel reactor as a
special case, simply by setting V = O in Eq. 7. Before discussing the
practical use of Eq. 14, we can exhibit the previous concepts in an

explicit algebraic manner. From Eg. 7 we have,

This equation has the appearance of the ordinary irhour relation for the

stationary fuel reactor,®

except that the effective production fractions,
8. are reduced by a quantity 74 which depends on the circulation rate and
also on w. In addition, the last term on the right hand side of Eq. 20
appears because the zerc point of the static reactivity was chosen to
correspond to the composition and geometry of the just-critical stationary
fuel reactor. The usual inhour relation for the stationary fuel reactor
is obtained by letting V —» 0 and 73 - 0 in Eq. 20. Although Eq. 20 is
instructive in discussing tae net effects cf fuel circulaticn, its sim-
plicity is somewhat deceptive since 74 depends in a complicated way on
w, through Eg. 7. Therefore, it will be more convenient to discuss the
use of the inhour relation starting with the form given in Eq. 1k.

At first appearance, in order to use Eq. 14 we are required to
solve Egs. 6 and 7 for w, c, (x; w), and ¢(x, E; w), and also to solve
Eg. 10 for p_ and ¢' (x, E; pl Both are eigenvalue problems in which
the algebraically largest real eigenvalues, ¢ ana 0g are cof immediate
interest. Not only does Eq. 14 reduce tc an identity if this procedure
is used, but it is precisely the explicit solution of Egs. 6 and 7 that
we wish to avold. The great usefulness of Eq. il is in the basis it pro-
vides for approximating the relation between Pe and the cbserved stable
period wt. The basic simplification results from assuming that the
shape of the asymptotic flux distribution, ¢, is sufficiently well
approximated by the static fiux distribution, P- From & physical stand-
point, the validity of this approximation is & consequence of the small-

ness of the delayed neutron fraction, B8 If this approximation is made,

7
and ¢ is substituted for ¢ in Eq. 7, this equation cen be integrated
around the circulating path cf the fuel to obtain the distributions of
delayed precursors, c.. Before completing the analysis, however, we
shall make a second approximation to simplify the computation of the

integrals occurring in Eq. 14. It can be assumed that the correction
10

 

for the difference in energy spectra for emission of prompt and delayed
reutrons appearing in Eq. 1L4 can be calculated approximately as a sepa-
rate step. :ig 1s done by reducing the age for the ith group of de-
layed neutrons from that of the prompt neutrons and modifying the static
delayed neutron fractions, Bis by the relative non-leakage probability
factors appropriate to a bare reactor which approximates the actual core.
Such an approximetion can also be Justified from an objective standpoint,
since the correction for the differing "energy effectiveness” of delayed
neutrons relative to prompt neutrons is small compared tc the effect of
the spatial transport of precursors under consideration. For the MSRE,
calculations of the former effect are given in Ref. 3. The net energy e
correction changes the effective value of Bo for UR35 from 0.006L to
0.00666 .

One further remark should be made concerning Eq. 14. A given
static reactivity, Pg corresponding to some time independent reactor
configuration is also related through Eq. 14 to all physically allowable
transient modes present in the neutron flux after the final reactor con-
figuration has been established. In this study, we have chosen to
emphasize only the relation between the circulation and the asymptotic
mode. An spproximete analysis indicates that the remaining eigenvalues
end eigenfunctions of Egs. 6 ard 7 differ in certsin fundamental respects
from those of stationery fuel reactors. For the purpose of this report,
we shall not attempt to demonstrate thls. Except for a brief return to -
this topic in a later section, we will restrict attention entirely to
the analysis of the stable asymptotic period measurements. ©

The completion of the required anslysie consists of the integration
of Eg. 7 arcund the circulating psth of the fuel. Obviously, even if J
is replaced by 2, calculated from Eq. 8, further simplifications in the
flow model are necessary before the problem becomes amenable to practical
computation. The approximations we have used in representing the circu-
lating loop of the MSRE are shown schematically in Fig. 1. The model
consists of a three region approximation to the actual core, representing
the lower or entrance plenum, the graphite moderated region, and the

upper, or exit plenum, respectively. The core is represented as a right

 

cylinder with volumes in the upper and lower plenums equal to those of

the actual MSRE core. This three-region model is a simplified version
of that used for sll previous MERE core physics computations.”

Fluid dynamics studies with the MSRE core mockup have indicated
that the fuel velocity within the graphite moderated region is very
nesrly constant over a large part of the core. Higher velocities occur
in a small region about the core axis and near the cuter radius. In the
upper plenum, the flow is nearly laminar, whereas in the bottom head the
flow distribution is complex due to the reversal in the flow direction
between the peripheral downcomer and the graphite moderated region.

In the present study, we have assumed the flow velocity in each
region except the lower plenum tc be constant (plug flow), with the

magnitude cf the linear velocity determined by

V = 3 (21)

where Dy is the axial length of the kth region, and ty is the residence
time of the fluid in the kth region. It will be seen later that the
precursor densities in the regions of zero neutron flux (external loop)
depend only on the fluld residence time in these regions.

Although the lower plenum is in a region of relatively low neutron
importance so that several approximations are allowable, rather than

: =14

assign a linear velocity to this region it was considered more realistic
from a physical standpoint to treat the region as & "well stirred tank”

with an average neutrcn flux end importance (adjoint flux) assigned to

Within the graphite moderated region, the primary difference in the

patizl distributions of prompt and delayed neutrons can be expected to

mn

be in the direction of fuel salt flow. As a first approximation, we have
assumed the velocity profile to be flat in the radial direction across
the entire core, and have neglected the radial averaging of the neutron
production rates implied in the scalar product integrals in Eq. 1k. This
is equivalent to sssuming radial and axial separability of the neutron
production rates and adjoint fluxes. Thus, 1f we preaverage the fluxes

over the radial ccordinate, and consider only the axial (z) dependence

of PE in the integration of Eq. 7, the problem reduces entirely to a
one-dimensional calculation (line model).

With these simplifications, the required integration of Eg. 7 can
now be completed. As written in the preceeding formulas, the precursor
densities and neutron reaction rates are the homogenized values, i.e.,
normalized to a unit cell volume of the reactor. To integrate Eq. 7,
account must be taken of the variation in the fluid volume fraction over
the path of flow through the reactor. If % 1s the volume fraction of
fuel in the kth region and superscript (0) is used to indicate the pre-

cursor densities and prompt neutron production rate in the fuel;

The values of o used for numerical calculations with the model of the
MSRE core shown in Tig. 1b were 0.225 for the graphite moderated region,

In the sbove equations, H, 1s the height of the graphite moderated region,

of the region representing the external piping and heat exchanger (see

Fig. 1b). As described above, the lower plenum region is treated by means
of a well mixed tank approximation, in contrast to the plug flow model for

the remaining regions. In Eq. 27, t, is the average residence time and

 

(P°¢), is the average fission production rate for each element of fluid

The computational procedure developed in this section may be sum-
marized as follows:

1. Calculate approximations to the static flux and adjoint flux
axial distributions by standard techniques of core physics analysis.

2. From a specified asymptotic inverse period, w, and the static
flux distribution, 2; corresponding to the same reactor state, calculate
cow) using Fc. 35. Note that the absolute normalization of the flux
ig arbitrary since Eg. li is independent of the flux normslizetion.

3. Calculate the axial distribution of precursor densities in the
salt, oS (zw), by means of formulas 30 through 34. Either a numerical
integration procedure or analytical approximations for 2.(z) can be used
in evalusting the integrals. The former method was used in the work
described in the following section.

4. Calculate Py by performing the integrations in Eq. 1&4.

t is obvious that the only means of practical calculation with this
scheme 1s the digital computer. A calculation program based on this scheme
was written for the IBM-7090. Specific details concerning the numerical

3. NUMERICAL AND EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Numerical Groundwork

 

Our intention in this section is to apply Eq. 14 to the analysis
of a series of rod bump-stable period measurements made with the MSRE
during fuel circulation. These weasurements were taken at various con-
trol rod insertions during the course of enrichment of the fuel salt in
Run No. 3. It has been seen from the analysis presented in Section 2
that the quantities required to relate the measured asymptotic period
to reactivity are the static distributions of the precursor concentration
and the fission production rate together with the associated adjoint flux
distribution. We have already introduced several approximations in order
to simplify celculations with Eg. 14. We now make explicit use of the
group diffusion model for the neutron fluxes. The flux distributions we
shall use were obtained from standard core physics analysis with one-
dimensional multigroup and two-dimensional, few group diffusion models
for the neutronic behavior. In performing a "first round" analysis of
the experimental measurements, the attempt was made to maintain as much
computational simplicity as possible without discarding the essential
features of the reactor and fuel circulation models.

It has been shown that the static distribution 2% and v. oceurring
in Eq. 1k are those appropriate to the asymptotic state, i.e., the
reactor-rod configuration during the period measurement. However, the
three control rods in the MSRE are in a highly lccalized cluster about
the center of the core (Fig. 2), and the insertion of a single rod
produces a perturbation in the thermal flux distribution which is fairly
well localized in the radial direction. Some calculational results in
support of this conclusion are shown in Fig. 3. These are plots of the
radial variation of the thermal flux, taken at an azimuthal angle half
way between control rods 2 and 3. The calculations were made with the
two dimensional diffusion program EXTERMINATOR,® using an R-@ model of

the MSRE core geometry. The perturbed fluxes with rod No. 2 inserted

and with all three rods inserted are compared with the fluxes when all

rods are fully withdrawn.* In 211 cases, the fluxes are normalized to
a core power level of 10 Mw. It may be seen that the shape of the flux
is relatively undisturbed over a large fraction of the radial cross
section of the core.

One may also note that the total neutron production rates in the numer-
ator and denominator of Eq. li are multiplied by the energy spectrums of
neutrcn production. Hence, when performing the integration over energy
in evaluating the scalar products in Eg. 14, only the high erergy portion
(vhere T(E} # 0) contributes to the result. We therefore need only
approximate the fast group adjoint flux distribution.

Based on the preceeding observations, as a final set of simplifying .
approximations we have used only the unperturbed distributions of fission
production and fast adjoint flux, corresponding to the case of the rods
fully withdrawn from the core. This simplification is consistent with
the neglect of the radial variations of flux and precursor concentrations
over the core which was discussed in Section 2.

The calculated unperturbed axisl distributions of fission production
rates and fast adjoint flux are given in Fig. 4. These were used for
the calculation of the axial distributions of the six delayed neutron
precursor groups, in accordance with the scheme developed in Section 2.
The individual precursor concentrstions, el(2), vere multiplied by A
and summed to obtain the total local rate of emission of delsyed neutrons
along the flow path through the resctor core. These resulting total dis-
tributions are shown in Fig. 5, for the particular cases of w = 0
(circulating critical) and w = O.1 sec” (10 sec stable period}, and also
for the case when the fuel is not circulating. All three distributions
are normalized to the same total production rate, P°7 The bottom
plenum is omitted from Fig, 5 since the well stirred tank model was
used to represent the delayed neutron production in this region.

Based on these same unperturbed fluxes, the relationship between the
stable inverse period, wt, and the increment in static reactivity

corresponding to the rod bump is shown in Fig. 6. For comparison

 

*The "dip" in the thermal flux when the three rods are fully
ithdrawn is caused by the presence of the INOR-8 rod thimbles.

As the curves in Fig. © illustrate, because the margin between the prompt
and delayed neutron sources has been increased by the spatial transport
of the precursors, the same static reactivity increment produces a faster
rate of rise of both neutron and precursor densities. The calculated
curves extend somewhat beyond the region of practical Interest in experi-
mental measurements of the stable pericd. They are presented mainly for
the purposes of illustration. In analyzing the experimentsl data, it
proved to be most expedient to carry out machine calculations of the

reactivity increments corresponding to each observed stable period.

Experimental Results

 

In the chronology of the MSRE zero power experiments, the measure-
ments of interest in this study began at the point of reaching the mini-
mum #257 concentration required for criticality with circulation stopped
and all control rods fully withdrawn. A summary of the zero power experi-
ments is given elsewhere ,*© and we consider only those details pertinent
to the tepic of this report.

Once this first basepoint 22° U concentration had been reached, the
concentration was further increased by the addition of capsules of en-
riched fuel salt containing approximately 85g amounts of 23%U. The
amount of control rod insertion required to compensate for these additions
was messured, and period measurements about these new critical rod posi-
tions were made. Care was taken to determine the minimum extras addition
of 23%U required to reach criticality with the fuel circulating and all
rods fully withdrawn. Once this second basepoint was reached, the
critical rod position and period measurements were made first with the
pump stopped then with the fuel circulating. The measurements were
terminated when enough ®2%5U had been added to calibrate one rod over its
entire length of travel.

Most of the period measurements were made in pairs. The rod whose
sensitivity was to be measured was first adjusted to make the reactor
critical at about 10 watts. Then it was pulled a prescribed distance
and held there until the power had increased by about two decades. The
rod was then inserted to bring the power back to 10 watts and the measure-
ment wss repeated at a somewhat shorter stable period. Two fission cham-
bers driving log-count-rate meters and a two-pen recorder were used to
measure the pericd. The stable period was determined by averaging the
slopes of the two curves (which usually agreed within about 2%). Periods
observed were generally in the range of 30 to 150 sec.

Prior to pulling the rod for each period measurement, the attempt
was made to hold the power level at 10 watts for at least 3 minutes, in
an effort te assure initial equilibrium of the delayed neutron precursors.

Generally, however, it was difficult to prevent a slight initial drift

 

in the power level as observed on a linear recorder, and corrections were
therefore introduced for this initial period. The difference between
the reactivity during the transient and the initial reactivity, as com-
puted from the in-hour relation, was divided by the rod movement and
this sensitivity was ascribed to the rod at the mean position.

The results of the rod sensitivity measurements made with the fuel
stationary are shown in Fig. 7. Since the rod reactivity worth is
affected by the 22%U concentration, theoretical corrections have been
applied to the raw data to account for the fact that the ®3°U mass was
continually being increased during the course of these experiments. The
rod sensitivities shown in Fig. 7 have been normalized to a single 23%U
concentration, that at the beginning of the calibration measurements.

The calibration curve in Fig. 7 constitutes a convenient reference
from which the static reactivity equivalent of the 23%U additions can be
determined, simply by relating the integral under the curve between the
fully withdrawn position and the critical rod position to the 235U mass.
By applying this equivalence to the minimum 235U increment between criti-
cality with the fuel stationary and with it circulating, one obtains an
experimental determination of the resgctivity loss increment due to cir-
culation. In addition, the curve in Fig. 7 is a convenient comparison
curve for the rod sensitiviiy data taken while the fuel was circulating.

In the first of the two sbove cases, the reactivity increment
cbtained from experiment was 0.212 + 0.004% 6k/k. This was found to
compare with 0.222% calculated directly from Eq. 14, with w = 0. In the
second case, the rod sensitivities determined from period measurements
during circulation and Eg. li are shown in Fig. 8. Note that the solid
curves in Figures 7 and 8 are identical. The experimental points were
found to be distributed fairly clesely about the reference curve, but the
scatter of points relative to this curve is somewhat larger than observed
with the data points of Fig. 7. Suggestions concerning the possible
sources of this scatter, and methods for improving the precision of these

neasurements are included in the following section.

LL. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

Theoretical Model Verification

 

In keeping with the order of presentation of the preceeding part of
this memorandum, we shall first discuss those aspects of the results
which relate directly to the theoretical model. Following this, some
suggestions concerning the MSRE experiments will be made.

As a test of the theoretical model for determining the effects of
fuel circulation on the delayed neutron precursors, quite satisfactory
results were obtained for the reactivity increment between the just-
critical states with the pump stopped and with the fuel in steady circu-
lation. Here, the principal difference in our model and an earlier
calculation by Haubenreich® is the specific inclusion of the top and
bottom reactor plenums as additional sources of delayed neutron emission
which contribute to the chain reaction. As was shown in Fig. 5, the
combined effect of fuel flow and radioactive decay of the precursors is
to "skew" the distribution of delayed emission toward the upper core and
the top plenum. It is important to notice that this relative increase
in emission of delayed neutrons in the top plenum is further accentuated
by the much larger fuel volume fraction in this region (the effective
neutron preduction is the product of the source in the fuel salt times
the fuel volume fraction). Because Haubenreich's model accounted for
the ultimate contribution to fission of only those delayed neutrons
emitted in the channelled region of the core, he obtained a somewhat
larger effective loss in delayed neutrons due to circulation.

Although these results seem to constitute an adequate test of the
model for the steady state condition, we cannct extend this claim to the
stable asymptotic periods measured over the entire range of rod travel,
due primarily to the lack of precision in the period measurements. How-
ever, until more precise measurements can be made, this calculational
model appears to be an adequate description of the delayed neutron pre-
cursor transport due to circulation.

More generally, one may pose the question of the need for sensitive

Ss tests and models of the delayed neutron kinetics during fuel circulation
 

at zero power. For the rod calibration work, it 1s always possible to
stop the fuel pump, perform the tests with the fuel stationary in the
core, and use simpler, well developed methods for the analysis of stable
periods. Also, the questions of ultimate safety and stability of the
reactor generally involve large reactivity additions which take place on
a time scale short compared to the core transit time, and greatly in-
fluence the kinetics of the prompt neutron generation. These questions
also involve nonlinear interaction effects with temperature at high
power.

In addition to the theoretical interest, there are several contri-
butions a good understanding of the effect of circulation on the delayed .
neutron kinetics can make from the viewpoint of reactor operation. For
example, the observed differences between the fuel stationary and circu-
lating critical conditions can constitute a sensitive method of determin-
ing fuel circulation rate, amount of circulating gas bubbles, or any
special characteristic due to the circulation. Necessary control system
sensitivities and response times for normal operation can be specified
with less uncertainity in the desgigr of other molten salt reactors.

Although much of this study overlaps that of earlier work, it is
useful to re-emphasize here that the kinetics of circulating fuel systems
belong to a mathematical category which is fundamentally different from
that of stationary fueled reacters. This is particularly important in
the description of reactor transients cccurring on a time scale com-
parable with the fuel transit times. It 1s appropriate to refer to the
circulating fuel systems as "vime-lag' systems, governed by partial
differential equations for the delayed emitter concentrations, rather
than by ordinary differential equations. For many purposes, spproximate
reductions of the equations to a form similar to the kinetics equations
cf the stationary fueled systems are adequate (e.g., the replacement of
the individual delayed fractions, Bs by effective reduced values, 8ST,
in the conventional reactor kinetics equations). This reduction, however,
does not seem to be fully justified for the analysis of an arbltrary
transient. In this study, the only conditions we have fully examined are

the Just critical state and the state of flux changing with a stable

 

asymptotic period. For a complete theoretical understanding of the
 

 

Lo
pi

coupling of the circulation with the delayed neutron kinetics, we need
also to analyze the transient delayed neutron modes, mentioned briefly
in Section 2. This transient coupling determines the effective time to
establish the asymptotic period, and should zlso provide a basis for
approximations made in the analysis of arbitrary transients. Some pre-
liminary work has been done con this problem, and we hope to make this

the subject of a future memorandum.

Recommendations for the MIRE

 

One reason for the lack of precision of the rod bump-period measure-
ment of control rod sensitivity is that the latter 1s the ratio of two
small quantities. For best results, this requires the experimenter to
maintain high precision in both the measurement of the increment in rod
position and the slope of the log n vs time curve. ZFarly in the course
of these experiments it was decided that only the regular reactor instru-
mentation would be used for the rod sensitivity measurements. Determi-
nation of the period in each measurement involved laying a straight-edge
along the pen line record on the log n chart and reading the time Interval
graphically along the horizontal scale which corresponded to a change of
several decades in the neutron level. Since these charts, together with
the pen speeds, are subject to variations, this is a probable source of
error in the rod sensitivity measurements. A second possible source of
error, probably less important, lies in the measurement of the increments
in the rod positions. It has been seen that the scatter in the experi-
mental points was larger for the sensitivity measurements made during
circulation. This is expected, since similar increments in rod with-
drawal result in a shorter stable period under these conditions.

Although a complete error analysis has not been carried out, these
considerations would seem to be obvious sterting points in any future
attempt to obtain more precise measurements of the rod sensitivities.

At the time these experiments were performed, the MSRE on-line computer
was unevailable for the automatic recording of experimental data. It
would be useful, during future MSRE operation, to repeat some of the

period measurements while at zero power, using the computer in the dats
 

logging mede to sutomatically record the log n and time intervals. The
shim rods could be adjusted to vary the initial critical position of the
regulating rod for the period measurements. The immediate need for more
precise experiments is not great, since the precision of the rod cali-
bration obtained from the measurements with the fuel stationary is

Judged adequate for further operation.
