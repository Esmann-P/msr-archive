FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at ORNL. records the
technical progress of the research on the circulating-fuel reactor and all other ANP research at
the Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided into three major parts:
Il. Reactor Theory and Design, 1l. Materials Research, and lil. Shielding Research.

The ANP Project is comprised of about 300 technical and scientific personne! engaged in
many phases of research directed toward the achievement of nuclear propulsion of aircraft. A
considerable portion of this research is performed in support of the work of other organizations
participating in the national ANP effort. However, the bulk of the ANP research at ORNL is
directed toward the development of a circulating-fuel type of reactor,

The nucleus of the effort on circulating-fuel reactors is now centered upon the Aircraft Reactor
Experiment — a high-temperature prototype of a circulating-fuel reactor for the propulsion of
aircraft. The equipment for this reactor experiment is now being assembled; the current status of
the experiment is summarized in Section 1 of Part |. The supporting research on materials and
problems peculiar to the ARE — previously included in the subject sections ~ is now included in
this ARE section, where convenient. The few exceptions are referenced to the specific section of
the report where more detailed information may be found.

The ANP research, in addition to that for the Aircraft Reactor Experiment, falls into three
general categories: (1) studies of gircraft-size circuloting-fuel reactors, (2) materials problems
associated with advanced reactor designs, and (3) studies of shields for nuclear aircraft. These
phases of research are covered in Parts |, Il, and Ili, respectively, of this report.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

SUMMARY

PART I. REACTOR THEORY AND DESIGN

Assembly of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment is
proceeding, the fuel and the sodium circuit pumps
are being assembled and tested, and the methods
for recovery and reprocessing of the fuel are being
developed (Sec. 1). The reactor was installed in
the pit, and the fuel and the sodium circuits were
completed except for the pump assemblies. An
examination of ag spare heat exchanger, however,
confirmed doubts as to the reliability of these
units, and they are now being rebuilt. The oper-
ations manual has been completed, and training
of the operating personne! is continuing. The
production of the ARE fuel concentrate was com-
pleted, and the analytical results were verified.
An analysis indicated that the fill-and-flush tank
would be subcritical if it were necessary under
emergency conditions to admit the fuel to it. The
ARE pumps are being inspected and tested, and
the pump tanks and covers have been made avail-
able for installation. The fabricated impellers
designed to replace the faulty cast impellers were
found to be satisfactory.

The experimental reactor engineering work .in-
cludes the development of pumps for circulating
fluoride mixtures in in-pile loops, the design and
construction of forced-circulation loops for cor-
rosion testing, developmental work on high-temper-
ature bearings, and tests of rotary-shaft and valve-
stem seals for fluoride mixtures (Sec. 2). The
pumps being developed and tested for circulating
fluoride mixtures in in-pile loops for studying
rodiation damage of the fluoride mixture and the
loop material are of two types: pumps for use
inside reactor holes and pumps for use external
to reactor holes. Work is under way on a verticaol-
shaft sump pump, an in-pile pump with a cen-
trifugal seal, and a horizontal-shaft sump pump.
Since the in-pile pump with a centrifugal seal is
not sensitive to its orientation with respect to
gravity, it also shows promise as an aircraft type
of pump. Limited test operations have been com-
pleted on the l-megawaft regenerative heat ex-
changer which employs some of the design features
of the proposed heat exchanger for the reflector-
moderated aircraft reactor. A sodium-to-gir radi-
ator is used as the heat dump for this heat ex-

changer test, and radiator performance and en-
durance data are being obtained. Two all-lnconel
corrosion testing loops and one beryllium and
Inconel loop are being developed that will provide
high liquid velocities and high temperature differ-
ences between the hottest and coldest parts of
the circuit. Design work and developmental in-
vestigations dare continuing on o hydrodynamic
type of bearing which will operate at high temper-
atures in a fluoride mixture. The work thus far
has been primarily concerned with determining the
compatibility of materials with respect to wear and
corrosion. Additional tests were made of rotary-
shaft and valve-stem seals for fluoride mixtures,
and a program for testing the self-bonding of ma-
terials in fluoride mixtures was planned. Methods
for removing fluoride mixtures from equipment are
being developed. Preliminary tests show promising
results in rapid dissolution of NaF-ZrF UF, with
a nitric acid-boric acid solution. There was only
light attack on the Inconel container walls,

Studies of the reflector-moderated reactor were
primarily concerned with the effects of reactor
design conditions on aircraft gross weight, but
these studies also included a core flow experi-
ment, reactor physics considerations, and the de-
velopment of a method for chemically processing
the fuel (Sec. 3). A parametric study was made
to determine the effects on aircraft gross weight
of reactor temperature, power density, and radi-
ation doses inside and outside the crew com-
pariment. The results of analyses of three design
conditions show that the gross weight of the
airplane is relatively insensitive to reactor design
conditions for Mach 0.9, sea-level operation but
that it is quite sensitive for the much higher

fundamental constants.

PART Il. MATERIALS RESEARCH

The chemical research on liquids for use in high-
temperature reactor systems has been primarily
a continuing effort to obtain fuels with physical
properties superior to those of the mixtures in
the NaF-ZrF ,-UF, system (Sec. 5). Thermal
analysis techniques were used for siudies of
the NaF -KF-ZrF UF, NaoF-LiF-ZrF -UF ,, NaF-
BeF,-ZrF -UF,, NaF-LiF-BeF,-UF,, RbCI-UCI,,
and NaCli-ZrCl, systems. The NaCl-ZrCl, system
is of interest because a low-melting-point water-
soluble mixture in this system would be useful
for removing fluorides from equipment. In ad-
dition, the quenching technique applied previously
has been used along with x-ray and petrographic
examination of slowly cooled specimens to obtain
a better understanding of the complex relation-
ships in the NaF-UF, and NaF-ZrF, systems.
High-temperature phase separation has also been
used for studying systems, such as NaF-ZrF ,
NaF-ZrF ,-UF ,, and NaF-KF-ZeF ,-UF ,, in which
solid solutions are expected. Experimental studies
of the reaction of chromium and iron in the metallic
state with UF, in molten NaZrF_ have shown that
the deviation of the activity coefficient from unity
is probably due to the formation of complex ions

 

such as UF,~, UF™7, and FeF,™. Two methods
were developed for preparing NaZrF melts con-
taining UF; one sample was found to contain
3.54 wt % UF, and another contained 5.95 wt %
UF,. Evidence was accumulated which shows
that the presence of ZrF, in a nonuranium-bearing
fluoride melt dees not afford a mechanism for
storing latent reducing power and that ZrH, does
not impart a hydrogenous character to the melt,
Rates of reduction of NiF, and Fef, by hydrogen
in nickel reactors were determined at 600 and
700°C. Additional spectrophotometric determi-
nations of absorption spectra for UF, and UF,
in quenched fluoride melts were carried out. The
facilities for the production of experimental fluo-
ride mixtures have been modified and expanded,
and the large-scale production facility has been
reactivated.

The corrosion research effort has been devoted
almost entirely to studies of the effects of various
parameters on the corrosion of Inconel by fluoride
mixtures, although some work has been done with
nickel, various 400 series
stainless steels, lzett iron, Hastelloy, and various
brazing alloys (Sec. 6). Corrosion testing in
thermal convection loops is being accelerated by
the addition of loop facilities and modifications
of loop design. Additional tests have confirmed
that the corrosion of Inconel increases with oper-
ating time when exposed to either NaF -ZcF ,-UF
or to NaF-ZrF, and that the attack is due to the
mass transfer of chromium metal. It was also
established that the depth of attack in Inconel
increases slowly, but linearly, with increasing
uranium content in the fluoride mixture, However,
increasing the surface-to-volume ratio in the
thermal convection loops decreases the depth of
attack in Inconel, The fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF -
UF , was circulated for 500 hr at 15C0°F in several
400 series stainless steel loops, ond metal crys-
tals were found in the cold leg of each loop. At-
tempts were made to circulate NaF-Zrf -UF at
1500°F in Hasteloy B loops, but all attempts
failed either because of catastrophic oxidation or
mishandling.

ceramic materials,

Static corrosion tests hove been
made of many brazing alloys, and it has been
found that the nickel-phosphorus and the nickel-
phosphorus-chromium alloys have the most satis-
factory corrosion resistance in NaF-ZrF ,-UF,.
The study of corrosion and mass tronsfer charac-
teristics of container materials in liquid lead has

 
been extended to include tests with cobalt, be-
ryllium, titanium, and Hastelloy B.

The work in metallurgy and ceromics included,
in addition to the important study of high-conduc-
tivity metals for radiator fins, stress-rupture tests
of Inconel, preparations for creep tests of co-
lumbium, the brazing of various materials to In-
conel, the fabrication of clad columbium disks
and of columbium and molybdenum tubing, the
drawing of tubular fuel elements, the development
of ceramic materials for pump bearings and for
containers for fluoride fuels, ond the preparation
of boron carbide~iron cermets for use as shielding
in connection with in-pile loop studies (Sec. 7).
The studies of the effect of environment on the
creep and stress-rupture properties of Inconel have
continued, and it has been demonstrated that a
small change in the composition of the Inconel
has a major effect on its creep properties. Methods
were developed for preparing u nickel-phosphorus
brazing alloy powder that can be applied in the
conventional manner. In the study of high-conduc-
tivity metals for radiator fins it was shown that
claddings of types 310 and 446 stainless steel on
copper are satisfactory with respect to diffusion.
However, it may be necessary to use Inconel as
the cladding material, and therefore various ma-
terials were tested as diffusion barriers between
Inconel and copper. None of the refractory ma-
terials tested were satisfactory, but diffusion
barriers of iron and types 310 and 446 stainless
steel were successful in preventing copper dif-
fusion for up to 500 hr at 1500°F. Radiator fins
of various materials were brazed to Inconel tubing
for heat transfer tests, ond on Inconel spiral-fin
heat exchange unit was fabricated for use in radi-
ation damage experiments. Various composites
of beryllium oxide with minor additions of other
materials were tested and were found to be un-
satisfactory as containers for fluoride fuels,

The physical properties of several fluoride mix-
tures and other materials of interest to aircraft
reactor technology were determined, and the heat
transfer characteristics of reactor fluids were
studied in various systems (Sec. 8). The feasi-
bility of a small-scale system io be used in
studying the rates of deposition of the films or
deposits found at interfaces between Inconel ond

10,000 and therefore may also be useful as a
dynamic corrosion testing unit. A technique has
been developed for measuring fluid velocity pro-
files in duct systems by photographing tiny par-
ticles suspended in the flowing medium. This
method is to be used for determining the hydro-
dynamic structure in the reflector-moderated re-
actor flow annulus. Additional forced-convection,
laminar flow heat transfer experiments have been
conducted in pipe systems which contain circu-
lating liquids with volume heat sources; the heat
sources are generated electrically. The laminar
flow data fall dbout 30% below the values pre-

dicted by previously developed theory.

capsules and determinations of the creep of metals
under irradiation, as well as the design and con-
struction of in-pile circulating loops (Sec. 9).
Data obtained from recently completed petrographic
examinations support the previous indications that
fluoride mixtures in the NaF -ZcF UF, system
are chemically stable under reactor radiation.
Concurrent tests have shown that the corrosion
of Inconel by these mixtures increases from 1 to
2 mils of subsurface-void attack for out-of-pile
tests to 5 to 6 mils of intergranular attack for
in-pile high-temperature tests. Miniature loops
are being designed for circulating fluoride mixtures
in such space-restricted locations as the vertical
holes of the LITR. The designs are based on
detailed studies of fuel flow rates, power den-
sities, and rates of heat removal. A new in-pile
stress corrosion apparatus has been developed
with which it will be possible to determine, simul-
taneously, the corrosion effects on stressed and
unstressed portions of a tube. Tests in the LITR
and in the ORNL Graphite Reactor have shown
that the creep behavior of Inconel is not seriously
affected by neutron bombardment. Similar tests
are to be made in the higher flux of the MTR. An
in-pile loop for circulating fluoride mixtures in
the LITR is 80% complete.

The analytical studies of reactor materials in-
cluded investigations of methods for determining
the oxidotion states of the corrosion products,
iron, chromium, and nickel, in fluoride mixtures
and methods for the seporation and determination
of UF, and UF, in fluoride mixtures (Sec. 10).
It wos established that the solubility of UF; in
NaZrF involves, first, oxidation to tetravalent
uranium and, then, dissolution, The conversion
of UF; and UF, to the corresponding chlorides
by fusion with NeAlCl, was accomplished. The
uranium chlorides are readily extracted by acetyl-
acetone-acetone mixtures. Samples of the fluoride
mixture NaF -ZrF ,-UF that were exposed to mois-
ture before being canned were examined with the
polarizing microscope after having been exposed to
gamma radiation in the MTR canal for 265 hours.
In comparison with fue! stored and canned in a
helium atmosphere, no effects of irradiation could
be observed.

PART Ill. SHIELDING RESEARCH

The work of the Shielding Analysis Group has
been concentrated mainly on the investigation of
neutron shields (Sec. 11). Calculations were made
according to the continuum theory nuclear model
to obtain a better understanding of the relationship
of differential fast-neutron cross sections to ef-
fective removal cross sections, as measured in
The calculated values agree

lated, namely, aluminum, iron, copper, lead, and
bismuth. Other heavy-element cross sections can
be calculated with relative ease and fair assurance
of accuracy. This approach is not, however,
useful for the calculation of cross sections for
light nuclei. Recent calculations by NDA on the
UNIVAC show that a slab of lithium hydride used
as a neutron shield would weigh only 63% as much
as a thickness of water which would give the same
attenuation. Independent estimates made at ORNL
confirmed the NDA value. It was shown that the
cooling of a lithium hydride shield for the reflector-
moderated reactor would not be difficult,

The effects of one and two air ducts on the
fast-neutron dose received outside a reactor shield
were further investigated at the Lid Tank Facility
(Sec. 12). Each of the two ducts consists of one
to three 22-in.-long straight sections. The sec-
tions were joined ot 45.deg angles. The experi-

mental results show that when two ducts are
parallel and in the some plane the dose is in-
creased. If they are parallel but in different
planes, the dose is the same as for a single duct.
In the case where the axis of a nearby short
straight duct intersects the middle of a long duct,
the dose is again increased. The Lid Tank radi-
ation dose measurements made behind 82 reflector-
moderated reactor and shield mockups were ana-
lyzed. Although there are still uncertainties about
the air and structure scattering, the heat exchanger
region, ducts ond voids, and optimization of the
shield size and weight, a preliminary calculation
indicates that the weight of the basic, designed
reactor and shield assembly (excluding the crew-
compartment shield) will be 44,500 pounds. For
this estimate, the core diameter was 18 in., the
power was 50 megawaits, and the dose rate outside
the crew shield ot 50 ft from the reactor center
was 10 rem/hr. A recent Lid Tank measurement
shows the removal cross section of B,0, to be
4.4 +014.

Two bulk shields for the GE-ANP program were
tested at the Bulk Shielding Facility (Sec. 13).
The first test was of a mockup of a duct system
and shield to be used at the G-E Idaho reactor
test facility. The second mockup consisted of
two sections of the shield for the R-1 reactor.
While the data from these tests have not been
completely analyzed, it appears that the results
agree quite well with calculated estimates for the
designs.

The Tower Shielding Facility is nearing com-
pletion and operation should begin during the
month of March (Sec. 14). A complete set of
instruments has been collected for the experi-
mental program; some of the instruments were
especially developed for use af this facility. Con-
sideration of the Tower Shielding Facility for use
in a biolsgical program for establishing dese rates
for pilots in a nuclear-powered aircraft has
prompted a study of radiation doses which can be
achieved.

The reactor for the Aircraft Reactor Experiment

months. The operations manual has been com-
pleted and training of the operating personnel is
continuing. The production of the ARE fuel con-
centrate, Na, UF , was completed, and the ana-
lytical results were verified.

The possibility of the fill-and-flush tank going
critical if the fuel were admitted to it under certain
emergency conditions was explored. A pertinent
comparison with an earlier critical experiment and
with a machine calculation indicated that the fill-
and-flush tank would be subcritical even if it were

cadmium fraction as obtained from the critical
experiments for the reactor are presented.

Each ARE pump is being subjected to component
inspection, cold shakedown testing with air at
room temperature, testing at operating temperatures
with sodium, and visual inspections both after
assembly and after each cold and hot shakedown
test. All pump tanks and covers have been fabri-
cated and made available for installation. The
fabricated Inconel pump impellers designed to
replace the faulty cast impellers have been tested
and were found to be satisfactory.

Recovery and reprocessing of the ARE fuel has
been studied further, and it is planned to dissolve
the solid fuel in an aqueous solution, extract the
uranium with 5% tributyl phosphate, and isolate
it by ion exchange. A dissolution rate of 5 kg
of uranium per day is anticipated. Batch ion-
exchange tests have been made, and calculations
indicate that a Higgins continuous ion-exchange
contactor 3 in. in diameter and 6 ft in length will
permit a processing rate of 9 kg of uranium per
day. However, the capacity will be limited by the
fuel dissolution rate.

THE EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR SYSTEM

The fuel and sodium heat exchangers for the ARE
were fabricated by an outside contractor over a
year ago. There has been considerable concern
throughout the project as to whether the welding
was up to the standards maintained on the re-
mainder of the system. As a check on these units,
a spare heat exchanger was cut up and examined.
The examination showed that the welds at the lugs
for stress relief of the tube-to-header plate joints
had been made with coated rod and were entirely
unsatisfactory. In addition, it was found that an
accidental strike had been made on the end of one
tube bend with a metallic arc. These findings
further emphasized the doubts about the heat ex-
changers, ond therefore a decision has been made
to disassemble and rebuild the heat exchangers
to eliminate all the original welds. The materials
required are available, and it is estimated that
this work will require approximately four months.

The reactor is installed in the pit and both the
fuel and the sodium circuits are complete except
for the pump assemblies. There is a bypass
around the reactor in the sodium circuit which
will not be removed until after the sodium circuit
has been tested with water, since it would be
undesirable to contact the beryllium oxide blocks
with water. The pumps for the sodium circuit have
been tested ot operating temperature and are now
ready for installation in the system.

A modification was effected in the fuel circuit
by removing one of the fill-and-flush tanks. This
tank became superfluous when the liquid metal
cleaning of the fuel circuit was eliminated from
the procedure. The tank was removed from the
system in order to eliminate a potential source of
trouble associated with the valve in the line to
this tank.

A simplification was effected in the pump aux-
iliaries when the dibutyl carbitol system for pump
seal cooling was replaced with a direct water
cooling system that requires no circulating pumps
or heat exchangers. This cooling system was
checked and was found to be satisfactory in the
tests run on the pumps. The lubricant cooling
systems for the main sodium and fuel pumps have
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

been completed and two of the systems have been
installed in the pits. Each of these units is com-
prised of an oil-to-water heat exchanger, an oil
pump and a spare, and the changeover solenoid
valves for selecting the operating oil pump.

Installation of electrical heaters and insulation
on the pipe lines are 90% complete. All valves
are now heated on individual circuits with variac
controls for each valve. The heating circuits have
been checked out on all fuel tanks in the tank
pit, and strip heaters on the hot fuel dump tank
have been replaced with Cromolox tubular heaters.
The dump tank ‘‘chimney’’ was equipped with a
damper in order to make possible adequate temper-
ature control of this tank.

The sodium circuit helium loops have been
checked out and the hydraulic drives for these
blowers have been put in operation. The 3-hp
electric motors for driving the hydraulic pumps
were exchanged for 5-hp units to provide ample
power should the ducts not be completely filled
with helium. Also, the helium ducts were welded
at the joints to reduce the helium leakage and
to improve the ‘‘open pit’' operation prior to the
power run of the system.

The operations manual hes been completed and
issued. Definite training sessions for operating
personnel are being held on schedule and oper-
ational procedures are becoming firm,

Neutron Temperature

As mentioned previously, there is some un-
certainty as to the effectiveness of xenon poisoning
in a high-temperature reactor, particularly in a
reactor with strong thermal absorption such as
that in the ARE. This uncertainty results from
the rapid drop of the xenon absorption cress section
with increasing neutron energy. The high temper-
ature of the reactor means a high average energy
of neutrons in thermal equilibrium with the moder-
ator, and the average neutron energy is even higher
than this equilibrium energy becouse some neu-
trons are chsorbed during the slowing-down process

before they reach equilibrium. Only data from
experiments at room temperature are available for
studying this problem, ond they are not applicable
to the ARE problem.

The neutron energy spectrum in an infinite ab-
sorbing moderator can be computed according to
the Wigner ond Wilkins method? in which one
integration must be performed numerically. This
numerical integral is being coded for machine
calculation. The calculations are to be carried
out for the following moderators: H, D, Li’, Be,
C, O, H,0, and F. Constant scattering and 1/v
absorption will be considered. The ratio of ab-
sorption cross section (taken, for instance, at the
energy in equilibrium with the moderator temper-
ature) to scattering cross section will assume
several representative values. Various moderator
temperatures, 1, can be token care of by intro-
ducing a dimensionless parameter, neutron energy
per kT.

Criticality in the ARE Fill-ond-Flush Tank

It was not intended originally that the final ARE
fuel mixture would ever be admitted to the tank
provided for flushing the ARE fuel system and
for filling the system with the nonuranium-bearing
fuel carrier. However, during the construction of
the ARE the desirability of being able to admit
oll the fuel and carrier to the fill-and-flush tank
under certain emergency conditions became ap-
parent. At that stage of construction it was not
possible to replace the tank with a tank designed
for definite subcriticality nor was it possible to
perform a critical experiment on the tank.

Some of the cross sections and other nuclear
data for determining the criticality of the tank are
somewhat in doubt, but if all these data are ad-
justed (within the limits of present knowledge)
to be most favorable for criticality, the possibility
of the tank going critical could not initially he
excluded. However, it was found that a pertinent
comparison could be made with data extrapolated
from an earlier critical experiment.® Criticality
was not achieved in this experiment, but extrupo-
lation of the measured curve of multiplication

constant vs. uranium investment showed that fo
be critical the assembly would have had to have
been at least as large as the fill-and-flush tank.
Since the shapes of the critical assembly ond of
the tank are different, the reciprocal of the
buckling was used as the “‘size.”” The scattering
and moderating properties of the critical assembly
and of the tank are essentially the same, but the
extrapolated assembly contained very much more
fissionable material than the tank. On this basis,
the tank would be subcritical. A machine calcu-
lation was performed which confirmed this con-

clusion.

The ARE Critical Experiment

Computed values were compared with experi-
mental data? for cadmium fraction in the cylin-
drical ARE critical assembly with a bare top, an
Inconel-covered bottom, and BeO-reflected sides.
Spherical coordinates were used for the calcu-
lations. Figure 1.1 shows median-plane radial
values for critical assembly CA-8, which had ©
reflector thickness of 7% inches. Similar data
for critical assembly CA-9, which had a reflector
thickness of 12 in., are shown in Fig. 1.2. The
depression at the center of Fig. 1.2 is due to the
control rod assembly, Figure 1.3 shows the axial
values in CA-8, and Fig. 1.4 shows similar values
for CA-9. The discrepancy between the experi-
mental and the calculated values in Fig. 1.3 indi-
cates that an incorrect value was assumed for the

On completion of the production operation, all
components of the processing equipment which had
been contacted by the concentrate were salvaged,
and the uranium recovery operation was carried
out to determine the magnitude of uranium loss,
if any, during production. Preliminary results
show that the total amount of uranium used, less

10

the amount salvaged, differs by 41 g from the
analytical determination of the total amount of
uranium to be transferred for use in the ARE.
This difference is well within the limits of error
and marks this production operation as successful
with regard to uranium cccountability. The ura-
nium will be transferred to the ARE on the basis
of the actual amount of uranium contained in the
15 storage cans, as determined by the analytical
laboratories involved,

Acceptance Test Program

Specific acceptance tests for ARE pumps were
formulated, and the pumps are being assembled
and tested, Each ARE pump is subjected to com-
ponent inspection, cold shakedown testing in air
at room temperature with no fluid in the system,
hot shakedown testing with sodium as the system
fluid, and certain measurements and visual in-
spections both after assembly and after each cold
and hot shakedown test. The pump components
are being subjected te measurement inspections,
visual checking of joint surfaces, and pressure
testing of welded joints. The components of
rotary mechanical seals are tested for hardness

Each rotary pump element is operated for 72 or
more hours at 2000 rpm in a test stand with a
65-psi pressure difference across the upper rotary
mechanical seal in the bearing housing. A leakage
rate of less than 1 gal of oil per month is con-
sidered as acceptable.

Each rotary pump element is also subjected to
a hot shakedown test in a sodium system. With
the pump and its auxiliary systems operating, the
sodium system femperature is raised as rapidly
as possible to between 1375 and 1400°F and held
there for approximately 24 hr, after which it is
dropped as rapidly as possible to between 275 and

again raised to between 1375 and 1400°F and
held there for approximately 100 hr, after which
time it is dropped to between 250 and 275°F. The
rotary pump element is then removed from the test

several of the bellows seal elements furnished
by the Fulton-Sylphon Company did not meet
specifications with regard to flatness (to less
than 0.000069 in.,), hardness {Rockwell C-60),
and/or leak tightness (no leak indication from
Model H detector at 65-psi Freon). These seals
were returned to the manufacturer and, in the main,
have been satisfactorily reworked. On some units,
flatness lapping operations are being performed
by ORNL research machine shops. All rotary
elements were completely disassembled and are
being reassembled with seals which have passed
the flatness, hardness, and leak-tightness. in-
spections.

Three subassemblies of shaft-bearing seals were
mounted on center and checked for shaft eccen-
tricity (less than 0.001 in.) and for squareness
of the seals with respect to the axis of rotation
{less than 0.0004-in. variation at a specified
radius). After these subassemblies were mounted
in bearing housings, the shaft eccentricity at the
impeller mount was measured and found, in each
case, to be less than 0.001 inch. The cold shake-
down tests of each of these three rotary elements
revealed minor problems. For example, some of
the bellows seals (both upper and lower) do not
seal concentrically to the axis of rotation of the
shaft, that is, in some instances, the inner di-
ameter of the seal nose rubs against rotating shaft
surfaces. This defect is being repaired and the
oil leakage rates past the upper mechanical seal
are being brought to within tolerance.

The lower seal assemblies, as furnished by the
vendor, were found to be of varying lengths and
to require adjustment for installation, Reworking
has resulted in proper seal bearing pressures, and
the adjusted seals operate with only very slight
leakage with an unbalance: of less than 1 psi
across the seal,

Impeller Fabrication and Testing

All the cast Inconel! impellers received were
rejected upon inspection because of casting de-
fects. The defects have been attributed to the
lack of fluidity of Inconel at pouring temperatures
and the complexity of the blade design of the
impeller, Therefore, an attempt was made to fabri-
cate a drilled-port impeller and an impeller with
curved vanes by machining and welding.

A drilled-port impeller was initially contemplated

for use with the fluoride pump. Although this

11
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

type of impeller operated satisfactorily at ARE
flow conditions {68 gpm and 40-ft head) even with
entrained gas in the fluid, it would lose its prime
if there were large gas pockets in the fluid system,
Since the currently prescribed pressure-fill will
leave large gas pockets in the ARE system, the
fuel pump will have to employ the fabricated im-
pellers which show excellent degassing character-
istics, even with large quantities of gas.

In order to maintain the precise dimensional
tolerances demanded by the finished, fabricated,
curved-vane impeller, a sequence of fabrication
was established which incorporated frequent
stress-relief annealing. The components were dry
hydrogen fired at 1850°F after each machining
and welding operation, The impeller is shown
in Fig. 1.5 in its completed form. A detailed
description of the machining, welding, and heat-
treating sequences used is being prepared in con-
junction with the current fabrication of a second
impeller. The fabricated pump impeller was in-
spected by x ray and Dy-chek and found to be
structurally sound. In hydraulic performance, it
is very similar to the cast impellers of the same
design and is considered to be satisfactory {Fig.

1.6).

ion exchange. A dissolution rate of about 5 kg
of uranium per day is anticipated. The ARE fuel
will be transported to the processing site in
aluminum cans 8.5 in, in diameter and 17 in. in
length, Each can will have a capacity of 53 kg
of fused salt, but the amount per can will be
limited to that containing 4 kg of U23%, the
maximum permifted by criticality considerations.
A proposed flowsheet of the process has been
submitted to the Criticality Review Committee for

-approval,

Calculations based on 15-Mwd fuel irradiation
and 100 days’ cooling indicate that 8 in. of lead
shielding will be required for a carrier to handle
one can at a time. Preliminary calculations indi-
cate that most of the shielding at the Metal Re-
covery Building may be adequate for ARE proc-
essing but that heavier shielding will be required
above the dissolver. The charging equipment fo
be built will also require shielding.

Batch ion-exchange tests have been made, and
calculations indicate that a Higgins continuous
ion-exchange contactor 3 in. in diameter and 6 ft
in length will permit a processing rate of 9 kg of
uranium per day, However, the capacity of the
plant will be limited by the fuel dissolution rate.

Preliminary laboratory studies indicate that
severe corrosion of stainless steel may take place
in the dissolving stage of the process. The Cor-
rosion Section of the Reactor Experimental Engi-
neering Division is studying this problem.

Fuel Dissolution

Extrapolation of dissolving-rate data obtcined
in runs with 25 gal of dissolvent (5 kg of ARE
fuel) indicates that a minimum of 12 hr will be
required to dissolve each 53-kg fuel batch in an
open-top can 8.5 in. in diameter and 17 in. in
length, Criticality requirements, if concentration
control is used, indicate the need for a heel disso-
lution after every two charge dissolutions. The
throughput is estimated as 5.3 kg of U233 per day
if each charge contains 4 kg of U?3% and if a
12-hr heel dissolution is assumed.

The dissolution studies made on the fuel mixture
NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) were scaled up
from the laboratory experiments described previ-
ously® in order to simulate more closely the con-

ditions in the recovery plant. Two dissolvings
of 5-in.~dia by 5-in.-long open-top aluminum cans,
containing 5 kg of fuel each, in a 50-gal vessel,
were 100% complete after § hours. Violent boiling
plus mechanical ogitation was used in one run,
and violent boiling without agitation was used
the other run. Dissolution of a 5-kg charge with
a 25% excess of dissolvent was indicated by
uranium analyses of the solution to be complete
in 5 hours, However, because of erratic zirconium
analytical results, the dissolution was allowed
to proceed for another hour. No fuel fragments
were found when the vessel was opened at the
end of the 6-hr period. Zirconium analyses seem
to be reasonably accurate only when the concen-
tration is less than 10 g/liter, that is, when half
the fuel has dissolved. This is unfortunate, as

it would be convenient to follow the progress of
the dissolution by zirconium concentrations when
the quantity of uranium in the charge is unknown,
The first experiments in this series were made
on 6-in,-dia by 9-in.-long open-top aluminum cans,
each containing 10 kg of fuel. However, the
volume of dissolvent required for 10 kg of fuel
was too large to permit a fast boiling rate without
overflowing the 50.gal dissolver, In each case,
when the vessel was opened after 12 hr, large
fragments of undissolved fuel were present.

Solvent Extraction Processing

A gross beta decontamination factor of 3 x 105
was obtained in a batch countercurrent extraction
of uranium with 5% TBP from dissolved ARE-type
fuel, which had been prepared in the large-scale

13
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

demonstration of the dissolution procedure. Based
on a U?33 burnup of 0.07%, the maximum expected
in the ARE fuel, a decontamination factor of only
2 x 10% is necessary to lower the fission-product
beta activity of the recovered U23% below a toler-
ance of 10 times that of U?3%, The apparent
improvement of this decontamination factor over
the previously reported value of >10% is due to
greater reliability of analytical results gained
by a tenfold increase in initial fission-product
activity spiked into the dissolved fuel,

Further study of tributyl phosphate solvent ex-
traction processing of ARE fuel solution is under
way for determining the optimum extraction con-
ditions, Preliminary results (Table 1.1) on the
effects of variations in feed nitric acid concen-
trations over a range of TBP concentrations show
that the test decontamination with 0.5 M HNO,

is obtained in the range 5 to 7.5% TBP in Amsco
125-90W, With 3 M HNO, feed, the maximum de-
contamination occurs aot a lower TBP concen-
tration. In both cases, at low TBP concentrations,
ruthenium beta activity is much less important
than zirconium,

These decontamination factors are tenfold lower
than those obtained with ARE-type fuel, primarily
because of the high ARE-type fuel feed fluoride
content, over 1 M, while the feeds used in these
experiments contained no fluoride. A high fluoride
content is particularly important in increasing
zirconium decontamination, and the complexing
action of fluoride lowers to a somewhat less extent
the extractability of other fission products and
uranium. The optimum ratio of fluoride to alu-
minum is one of the most important factors yet to
be studied in ARE solvent extraction processing.

2. EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR ENGINEERING
H. W. Savage, ANP Division

Two types of pumps are being developed for ine
pile test work — pumps for use inside reactor holes
and pumps for use just external to reactor holes.
The downflow, gas-sealed pump for external use
has demonstrated the required performance char-
acteristics with no gassing. ‘A preliminary water
test indicated promising performance of a centri.
fugally sealed pump model. Development work is
continuing on packed seals for horizontal in-pile
pumps, ond designs are being developed for hori-
zontal-shaft gas-sealed pumps.

Development of corrosion testing units employing,
simultaneously, high liquid velocity and high
temperature difference between the hottest and
coldest points in the liquid circuit was continued.
The units being developed include two all-lnconel
units that will operate with NaF-ZrF UF, (50-46-4
mole %) as the liquid and will be cooled with air
and NoK, respectively, and one beryllium and
Inconel unit that will operate with NaK as the
fluid and will be cooled with a heat economizer,

The l-megawatt regenerative heat exchanger has
operated for 1680 hr, including 1370 hr of fluoride
pump operation. A high-performance sodium-to-air
radiator was employed as a heat sink.

Additional tests were made of high-temperature
bearing materials and of rotary-shaft and vaive-
stem seals for fluorides. A program for testing the
self-bonding of materials in fluorides has been
planned, and a preliminary test of Inconel vs,
Inconel is under way. Methods for removing
fluoride mixtures from equipment are being de-
veloped,

All pump housings and covers have been fabri-
cated, inspected, and delivered to the ARE for
installation. Intensive proof-testing and inspection
of all pump parts is in progress and will continue
until all ARE pumps have been delivered, Details
of the work on these pumps are presented in Sec.

IN-PILE LOOP COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT

VW. B. McDonald J. A, Conlin

C. D. Baumann D. F. Salmon

W. G. Cobb D, R, Ward
ANP Division

Components are being developed for in-pile loops

which are to be operated in the LITR and the MTR

for studying the effect of radiation on fuel stability
and corrosion of container materials {cf., sec. 9,
“Radiation Damage’’). The components to be
developed are compact fused-salt pumps which can
be operated inside reactor beam holes, high-
performance heat exchangers for removal of fission
heat, flow= and pressure-measuring devices suitable
for in-pile service, and other equipment essential
for the operation of in-pile loops. The in-pile
loops are to operate with fuel power densities of
from 1 to 5 kw/cm3, flow rates in the turbulent
range, a maximum fuel temperature of 1500°F, and
temperature differentials of from 100 to 300°F,
Development of the pumps is now under way.

Vertical-Shaft Sump Pump

Three vertical-shaft gas-sealed sump pumps have
been constructed ond are undergoing tests. Initial
testing with water revealed the entrainment of
large quantities of gas in the pump discharge at
most pump shaft speeds and flow rates. The pump
is of the downflow type, with the fluid entering
the impeller around the rotating shaft. VYortexing
of the fluid around the rotating shaft was found to
be o« major cause of gassing. In addition, poor
distribution of the fluid upon entrance into the
suction chamber caused turbulence of the free
fluid surface, Design changes were made (Fig.
2.1) which corrected both these difficulties and
eliminated gas” entrainment in the fluid af shaft
speeds and flow rates well above the design condi-
tions, The pump is sealed with a Morganite
{MYIF) face seal, and the shaft and seal are cooled
by circulating oil.

One pump was tested for 218 hr with fused salts
of 1200°F and 305 hr ot 1400°F., The normal
operating conditions during this fest included a
shaft speed of 3200 rpm and a flow rote of 1.3
gpm with a developed head of 26 feet. The second
and third pumps are undergoing water tests. pre-
paratory to testing at 1500°F with sodium,

Pump with a Centrifugal Sec!

A Plexiglas test model of an in-pile pump with
no mechanical liquid seal has been constructed
(Fig. 2.2), The sealing in this pump is accom
plished by centrifugal action of the pumped liquid.
This is analogous to a sump pump with the gravita-
tional field replaced by a centrifugal field,

Fig. 2.1. Vertical-Shoft Sump Pump (Medel LFA) Showing Modifications Made te Prevent Gassing.

The inlet side of the impeller is conventional;
however, the back side is extended to form an
annular chamber which is portially filled with the
pumped fluid which rotates at high speed during
operation and forms an annulus of liquid with a
free surface that never reaches the pump shaft.
The annular chamber is pressurized with gas.
Since this gas pressure contributes to the absolute
prassure throughout the system, it must be such
that af no place in the system does the total

16

pressure drop below the vapor pressure of the
fluid, The face seal shown in Fig. 2.2 is a gas
seal for retention of the pressurizing gas.

The small radial holes in the annular section of
the back of the impeller are designed to permit any
gos which might be entrapped due to turbulence
between the rotating fluid and the stationary wal!
of the pump housing to be centrifuged out, En-
trapped gas will thus be prevented from entering
the main fluid system,
The pump was tested with water as the working
fluid and air as the pressurant. The sealing
characteristics were very good, and there was no
observable pump leakage regardless of pump
orientation, even when the pump was inverted.
The test also indicated that the loop can be easily
filled. A bypass from the pump discharge to the
annular chamber at the centrifugal seal removes
entrained gas in a short period of operation. Since

this pump is not sensitive to its orientation in
respect to gravity, it also shows promise as an
aircraft type of pump. This possible application
is being further explored.

Heat Exchonger Test

Limited test operations have been completed on
the l-megawatt regenerative heat exchanger which
employs some of the design features of the heat
exchanger proposed for the reflector-mederated air-
craft reactors The test apparatus was described
previously,! The scope of the test program was
limited by several factors.

1. Original designs of the heat exchanger were
based on the use of NaoF-KF-LiF (11,5-42,0-46.5
mole %) as the circulating fluoride medium. Since
this mixture was not available at the time required
in sufficient quality or quantity, it was necessary
to use NaF-ZcF , (53-47 mole %), a more dense and
more viscous fluid, which put serious limitations
on the attainable Reynolds numbers on the fluoride
side of the tube bundles,

2. A design error in the area of the sodium flow
path through the heat exchanger made it necessary
to hold sodium flow rates to one-half to one-third
the desired levels in order to prevent serious over
heating of the electromagnetic pump cell,

3. Circuit limitations on the power supply to the
resistance heater which supplies heat to the
sodium circuit limited heat input to a maximum of
50 kw, that is, approximately one-half the desired
value,

These limitations prevent the drawing of re-
liable conclusions from the performance data ob-
tained on the heat exchanger, However, con-
siderable confidence has been gained in the
practicability of such a heat exchanger design.?

Since initial startup, the heat exchanger hos been
on heat at temperature levels varying from 1200 to
1600°F for 1680 hours, The fluoride pump was in
operation for 1370 hr of this time, and the entire
bifluid system was in complete operation for a total
of 712 hows. This period of trouble-free heat
exchanger operation was interrupted by binding
of the fluoride circulating pump. Upon removal
and inspection of the pump assembly, it was
found that the binding was caused by the condensa-
tion of zirconium fluoride crystals in an onnular
area around the pump shaft above the liquid level
in the pump sump. Considerable crystal formation
was also present on the pump sump wall above the
liquid level where it was cooled by the lower
flange of the top head assembly (Fig. 2.4). Inspec~
tion of the internal surfaces of the heat exchanger
showed them to be in excellent condition. Meodifi-
cations are being made in the test loop, and future
operation will be concerned mostly with endurance
testing of the component parts,

Sodium-tc-Air Radiator Tests

R. E. MacPherson H. J. Stumpf
ANP Division
J. G, Gallagher

American l.ocomotive Company

The design of the intermediate heat exchanger
test loop'+ indicated that a sodium-to-air radiator
would be the most convenient form of heat dump
and at the some time would provide an opportunity
to obtain additional radiator endurance and per-
formance data with little extra cost and setup time.
A strip-fin and tube radiator designed to dissipate
100 kw of heat was built for the rig and was
operated for 1013 hr at sodium inlet temperatures
ranging from 600 to 1550°F. A leak in the sodium
heater coil made it necessary to interrupt the test.
The heater coil is being replaced and the test is
to be resumed,

The air flow through the radiator was varied from
0.58 Ib/sec-ft? to 17.32 Ib/sec-ft? at the inlet face
gred, with corresponding Reynolds numbers of 327
to 11,100. The radiator geometry was the same as
that of core element No. 3 described in ref. 5,

Use of the larger diameter tubing corrected the

BerylliumeNaK Compatibility Test

The compatibility of beryllium metal with NaK
is being tested to determine whether protection of
the beryllium would be required if these materials
were used together, A sample of beryllium Y in.
thick and 1 in. in diameter with ten %- india How
passages was inserted in an Inconel figure 8 loop
and exposed to circulating NaK for 1100 hours.
The sample and the NaK at the sample were main-
tained at 1450°F, and the velocity of the MNaK
through the sample was 20 fps (Reynolds number,
8600). The minimum temperature in the cold zone
of the loop was 900°F. The beryllium sample is
now being analyzed metallurgically; it had a
heavy, black scale when it was removed from the
loop.

Design work ond developmental investigations
are continuing on a hydrodynamic type of bearing
which will operate at elevated temperature in a
fluoride mixture. The work to date has been con-
cerned with determining the compatibility of me-
terials with respect to wear and corrosion,

Materials Compatibility Tests

Tests were continued with the use of the equip-
ment described previously,” in which a rotating
plate specimen is maintained in contact with a
stationary pin specimen under a known load. Tests
of a chrome carbide pin and a titanium carbide
plate, a titanium carbide pin and a titanium carbide
plate, and an Inconel pin and a graphite plate were
operated at 1200°F for 2 hr each in NaF-ZrF ,-UF,
(50-46-4 mole %). In each test, metal buildup of
material between the specimens prevented proper
contact. This metal buildup has been identified as
iron, presumably from the type 316 stainless steel
container material, Figure 2.7 shows the metallic
buildup on a chrome carbide pin specimen. lnvesti-
gation is under way to determine whether this con-
dition is due to having a multimetallic system and
whether it would be possible to sufficiently reduce
the metal transfer by using different container
materials, It is probable that any bearing design
or application will have at least one material other
than the container material in the fluid system.
One test for which a nickel-plated pot and an
Inconel! sump pot with chrome carbide and titanium
carbide specimens were used also showed an un-
identified magnetic deposit that is being analyzed.

Bearing Tester Design

Design calculations for bearings operating in
fluoride fuels have been made for a number of ex-
pected operating conditions. The deflections of
Inconel shafts at temperatures of up to 1500°F
have been evaluated for various diameters of up to

Spiral-Grroved Graphite-Packed Shaft Seals

Seal test No. 20 for which a graphite packing was
used around a 1% (-in.-dic shaft with a machined
spiral groove was terminated after 3487 hr of opera-
tion because of a heater failure. There had been
no detectable leakage of the fluoride mixture
(NaF-ZrF -UF ,, 50-46-4 mole %) during this period,
and only a small amount of graphite leaked during
the early part of the run. There was essentially no
maintenance required or attention given to the
apparatus during the last 2500 hr of operation. The
power requirement was more regular and smooth than
had been experienced with other packed or frozen
seals. When the apparatus was disassembled, 'it
was found that the shaft was worn and that the
packing had been impregnated with fluorides. Figure
2.8 shows the shaft after disassembly.

Seal test No. 29 was a further attempt to verify
the nonwetting characteristic of graphite in. a
rotating shaft seal for sealing NaF-ZrF -UF,
(50-46-4 mole %). The shaft was 2% in. in diam-
efter and it operated in a horizontal position, in
contrast to a previous test® in which a 13 ;-in.-dia
shaft operated satisfactorily in a vertical position
for a period in excess of 3000 hours.

The apparatus consisted of a rotating shaft, Fig.
2.9, containing a spiral groove that operated in a
conventional stuffing box arrangement, to which
was attached a fluid container with a means for
pressurizing the fluid. The packing material for
this test consisted of a mixture of 90 wt % Asbury
graphite and 10 wt % MoS ,. The retainers for this
material were bronze wool,

This test was made with the fluoride mixture
NoF-ZrF ,-UF , (50-46-4 mole %) at 1100 to 1180°F
and with the shaft rotating at 560 rpm for a period of
47 hours. The packing temperature was from 1000°F
down to 600°F, and the pressure on the fluoride
mixture was 5 psi. Leakage occurred during the
last 17 hr, and the test was therefore terminated for
examination.

Post-run examination revealed that the bronze
wool retainer at the hot end of the packing had
failed and allowed the packing material to be con-
veyed into the seal pot. This packing failure is
believed to have been the reason for fluid leakage
from the seal. Further tests on this seal are
planned,

practically continuous operation at speeds of up
to 2500 rpm. The total leakage of the fluoride
mixture NaF-ZrF UF, (50-46-4 mole %) during this
period was less than 10 in.%, and the maintenance
time was essentially zero. The power requirement
during the test was variable, but it is not known
how much of this variation was due to intermittent
metal-to-metal contact, When the apparatus was
disassembled, there was no visible evidence that

tive to the shaft temperature, Power surges were
not experienced in this test as in previous tests.
The pressure differential across the seal has been
low in all tests on this apparatus.

Chevron Seal

In an aftempt to restrain powdered packing ma-
terials, a 13-in.-dia Chevron (Skinner) seal {Fulion-
Sylphon Company) was tested (test No. 30). This
seal is all metal and was designed for use around
reciprocating shafts or pistons. The sealing ele-
ment consists of a series of 0.003-in.-thick sheets
formed into flexible V or reed-type rings. These
elements are made so that the sealing edges are
deflected when the seal assembly is engaged ex-
ternally in o cylinder or internally on a rod or
shaft (that is, interference fits), It is claimed that
because these seals are flexible they provide seal
assemblies that have relatively low friction.
Figure 2.11 is a sketch of a possible arrangement
of these seals for retaining powdered packing.
Such a seal has been tested as a means of re-
taining a mixture of 50 wt % MoS, and 50 wt %
graphite. The test operated for over 750 hr, with
no heat added. There was some wear on the
Colmonoy coated shaft and seme leakage of the
packing. In this test, the packing material was
introduced into the stuffing box region by means of

of the packing pressure, since the gos leakage

when the screw conveyer was operated. Operation
of the screw conveyer caused small increases in
power requirements for the seal. The seal was
heated to about 1000°F, but no detectable dif-
ference in operation was noted. It is planned to
test this design with fluorides.

Graphite-BaF Packed Seal

Seal test No. 28 was made in an attempt to verify
the lubricating properties of barium fluoride when
it is used as an additive with graphite for 0 packing
material. The packing consisted of a mixture of
10 wt % BaF , and 90 wt % National Carbon graphite
No. 2301. The retainers for this packing were
bronze wool,

The apparatus consisted of a horizontal rotating
shaft 2Y, in, in diameter inserted into a seal pot
through a stuffing box, The seal was pressurized
by helium pressure applied to a surge pot attached
to the seal pot. The shaft was driven by a 5-hp
Varidrive motor that was belt-connected to the
driven shaft,

This test operated for 290 hr with a shaft speed
of 760 rpm. The fluoride mixture used was Naf-
ZrF UF, (50-46-4 mole %) at temperatures of
1100 to 1150°F, and the pressure on this fluid was
5 psi. The temperature along the packing was from
1000°F down to 600°F. The power trace was
typical of that of a frozen seal with excessive
leakage.

Post-run examination showed that the shaft surface
was in very good condition where the packing was
located and that the only appreciable wear was in
the region of the pocking gland. The packing
material was coked and quite slick to the touch.
Other tests with barium fluoride as an additive to
the packing are planned for the near future,

Shaft Seal for In-Pile Pump

Seal test No. 33 is being made to determine the
feasibility of sealing fluorides in an in-pile pump
rotating shaft with a packed type of seal. The
packing for this test consists of a mixture of 95 wt
% Asbury graphite and 5 wt % MoS, ond is retained
by bronze wool at each end of the packing.

The apparatus being used consists of a seal pot
to which a stuffing box is attached and through
which a Yymin.-dia Inconel shaft is inserted into
the pot. The shaft is driven by a Yh constant-
speed motor with a rated speed of 3450 rpm. The
test unit is constructed with the stuffing box off-
center on the seal pot so that the container will
perform both as a sump tank and a seal pot. The
seal pot functions as a sump tank before and after
the test. The system is dumped by pivoting the
test to o vertical position. The pot is filled to
between half full and full to provide a gas space for
pressurizing the fuel against the seal. Heat is
applied externally through the wall of the pot;
cooling is by natural convection.

To date, this test has operated for a period of
360 hr with NaF-ZrF -UF , (50-46-4 mole %) at a
temperature of 1180 to 1250°F. The temperature
drop along the seal is from 1100 to 550°F, and the
pressure on the seal is 2 psi. Operation has been
quite successful in that no difficulties have been
encountered. The power required by the seal has
been of the order of 100 to 200 watts for most of
the test; however, for a period of one to two days,
the power requirement was of the order of 200 to
300 watts. This increased power appecred to have
been the result of a slight lowering of the tempera-
ture of the seal. The average leakage rate is

26

about % em3/day, with lower rates at times for
periods of two to three days. The power trace is
quite variable and resembles those previously
encountered with frozen seals. When this test has
been completed, another test will be made with
this equipment with a hard-faced shaft.

Packing Penetration Test

A packing penetration test was made with NaF-
ZrF UF, (50-46-4 mole %) against an Asbury
graphite that was similar to Asbury 805 with re-
spect to amorphous carbon content and spectro-
graphic analysis, but the particle size was smaller
and more uniform. The operating conditions were
the same as in previous tests.’ The test was
terminated after 1125 hr, and there had been no
fluoride seepage through the packing material.

Yalve-Stem Packing Tests

Two additional valve-stem packing tests were
made this quarter. One test was made under the
same operating conditions us those used for the
previous tests,'? The material tested was Asbury
805 graphite with Fel Pro C-5 high-temperature
lubricant against NafF-ZrF -UF , (50-46-4 mole %).
This test was terminated at 350 hr because of
leakage.

The other test was made under actual operating
conditions. A Yp-in. stainless steel valve in a
fluoride transfer line was backed with the Asbury
graphite used in the packing penetration test. The
fluoride used was a mixture of NaF-Zrf -UF
(50-46-4 mole %) and NaF-KF-LiF-UF , (10.9-43.5-
44.5-1.1 mole %).
the valve. The original packing was removed and
replaced with the graphite, and a thin layer of
bronze woo! was used at the bottom of the stuffing
box. Operation of the valve was quite satisfactory.
The valve was under fluoride pressure about 1 hr,
during which time it was opened and closed 32
times; there was no leakage. When the transfer was
completed, the line and valve were blown clear of
all fluorides. After cooling, the valve was not
frozen or stuck and could be cycled easily.

There were no modifications in

purpose is to test materials and establish criteria
for selection of materials couples (metals, ceramics,

¥-in.-dia by ¥in.-long lnconel cylinders have flat
contact surfaces. In the present test, the fluoride
temperature is 1375°F, and the system pressure
(helium) is 1 to 1 % psig. The test will be operated
for 100 hours. Alterations in design, if any, will
depend on inspection of the sample and equipment
upon completion of the test. It is intended that
many combinations of materials will be tested.

A laboratery-size project is in progress for de-

tion is being studied.'! Preliminary tests show
promising results in rapid dissolution of NaF-ZrF -

the Inconel container walls.

There are some indications that the solution
attacks Inconel faster if the Inconel has previously
been exposed to molten fluorides. Quantitative
tests are being made to determine rates of solution
of the fluorides and rates of attack on Inconel under
various conditions of concentration of the acid
solution and temperature on both untreated Inconel
samples and samples pretreated with the fluorides.

3. REFLECTOR-MODERATED REACTOR

A. P. Fraas, ANP Division

A parametric study was made to determine the
effects on aircraft gross weight of the reactor
temperature, power density, and radiation doses
inside and outside the crew compartment, A chart
was prepared for use in the calculations which
gives the weights for the reactor, the reactor shield,
the crew shield, and the propulsion machinery as
functions of aircraft gross weight and useful load.

The results of the calculations for three design
conditions are presented, and it is concluded from
this study that the gross weight of the airplane is
relatively insensitive to reactor design conditions
for Mach 0.9, sea-level operation but that it is
quite sensitive for the much higher performance and
supersonic-flight conditions. Also, an increase in
reactor temperature level of 100°F is more effective
in reducing gross weight than is o factor-of-2
increase in power density.

An evaluation of the results of preliminary tests
of a full-scale Lucite core model indicated the need
for cutoffs in the pump volutes and turning vanes
around one quadrant of the impeller periphery to
obtain uniforin flow distribution at the core inlet.
Studies of flow in the core have shown that a set
of turbulator vanes is required in the core inlet
passage to assure axially symmetric flow and no
flow separation at the core shell wall.

The costs of construction, opergtion, and mainte-
nance of aircraft are directly proportional to the
gross weight. Thus it is important to know the
effects on airplane gross weight of reactor tempera-
ture, power density, and radiation doses inside and
outside the crew compartment.

plete set of shield weight data prepared in the
course of the 1953 Summer Shielding Session and
the engine performance data given in a recent

Wright Aeronautical Corporation report, ? The
basic method used by the Technical Advisory
Board, North American Aviation, lnc., and the

Boeing Airplane Company was used to prepare a
set of tables and charts to facilitate aircraft
performance calculations. The engine compression
ratio was taken as 6:1 and the pressure drop from
the compressor to the turbine was taken as 10% of
the compressor outlet absolute pressure. The
specific impulse and specific heat consumption
were taken from Figs. IX-1 through 1X-12 of the
Wright report; engine compressor and turbine weight
were taken from Fig. 1-19 and engine air flow from
Fig. 1-18. Engine nacelle drag was taken from
Fig. 67 of ANP-57,° except that 50% submergence
of the nacelles in the fuselage was assumed. The
weight of the engine tailpipe, cowling, and support
structure was taken as 25% of the compressor and
turbine weight, The weights of the NaK pumps,
lines, and pump drive equipment were calculated on
the same bases as were the estimates given in

ORNL-1515.4 The radiator cores were designed to
give 1140°F as the turbine air inlet temperature,
with a peak NaK temperature of 1500°F, and an air
pressure drop across the radiator core equal to 5%
of the compressor outlet pressure, The resulting
weight of the NaK system was somewhat higher
than would be obtained from the Wright report.
Table 3.1 presents the results of this survey.
Table 3.2 gives the installed weight of the pro-
pulsion machinery andthe reactor power as functions
of thrust. The weight of the reactor plus the
reactor shield was given as a function of reactor
power in Tables 3.1 through 3.4 of ORNL-1609.3
These data were plotted to give charts similar to
Fig. 3.3 of ORNL.-1609.

The basic equation relating aircraft gross weight
to the weight of the aircraft structure, the useful
load, the shield weight, and the weight of the
propulsion machinery is the same as that used by
the Technical Advisory Board, North American
Aviation, and Boeing:

Ye = WW, + UL +W_, + W

pm!
where
WV, = gross weight, |b,
W_, = structural weight {including landing

gear), lb,
UL = useful load, Ib,
W., = shield weight, ib,
= propulsion machinery weight, Ib.
The weight of the structure was taken as 30% of
the gross weight, a value in keeping with pro-
portions used by the TAB, North American Aviation,
Boeing, and the Lockheed Aircraft Corporation.
While this value would probably be closer to 25%
for subsonic aircraft (except for aircraft using low
specific-impulse power plants, such as the super-
critical-water cycle), the value used seemed
representative and adequate for the purpose of this
analysis.

In solving the equation for gross weight, it was
found most convenient to prepare a chart such as
that in Fig. 3.1, which gives the total weight for
the reactor, the reactor shield, the crew shield, and
the propulsion machinery as a function of aircraft
gross weight and useful load. The useful load was
considered to include the crew, radar equipment,

construed to include any extra crew shielding
required to reduce the crew dose to less than 1
t/hr. The solution for gross weight was obtained
graphically by plotting the weight of the propulsion
machinery plus reactor and shield against gross
weight, as in Fig. 3.1. The lift-to-drag ratio for
the aircraft was taken as a function of the flight
design condition, with allowance for the fact that
the flight design condition would, in general, not
give the optimum lift-to~drag ratio obtainable with
the airplane, because take-off, landing, and climb
requirements would necessitate wing loadings lower
than those for minimum drag. The values used for
the various flight conditions considered are given
in Table 3.3. The lift-to-drag ratios given are for
the airplane configuration without nacelles, an
allowance for nacelle drag having been deducted
from the specific thrust in Table 3.1. Thus the
lift-to-drag ratio with nacelles would be lower than
that indicated in Table 3.1, particularly at high
Mach numbers.

The results of calculations for three design
conditions ‘are shown in Figs. 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4. A
number of important conclusions can be deduced
from these curves, and perhaps the most important
is thatthe gross weight of the airplane is relatively
insensitive to reactor design parameters for the
Mach 0.9, sea-level conditions, but it becomes
quite sensitive for the much higher performance
supersonic-flight conditions. [t is also evident
that an increase in reactor temperature level of
100°F is more beneficial than a factor-of-2 increase
in power density. It should be noted that the
turbine air inlet temperature will be lower than the
peak fuel temperature by roughly 400°F, depending
on the heat exchanger proportions. Thus a turbine
gir inlet temperature of 1140°F corresponds to a
peak fuel temperature of about 1540°F,

In general, it appears that the aircraft gross
weight is not very sensitive to the degree of
division of the shield, except in the range of
reactor shield design dose rates below 10 r/hr at
50 feet. The effect is greater at dose rates below
10 r/hr, partly because the incremental weight of a
given radial thickness of shielding material in-
creases as the square of its radius and, hence, the
shield. weight increases at a progressively more
rapid rate as a unit shield is approached. A second

35,000-ft design condition. This, of course, is for
a relatively small crew compartment (5 ft in diameter
and 10 ft long). The weight increase associated
with a larger compartment would be roughly pro-
portional to its surface area.

The performance data presented above were for
design-condition operation on nuclear power alone,
Some additional calculations were made for all-
nuclear cruise operation at Mach 0.9 and 35,000 ft
and sprint performance with chemical fuel augmen-
tation at Mach 1.5 and 45,000 feet. A turbine air
temperature of 1640°F was assumed with
interburning in the nuclear turbojets together with

inlet

additional engines for operation on chemical fuel
only for the sprint condition. The effect of sprint
range on aircraft gross weight for several combi-
nations of power density, radiator air outlet temper-
ature, and degree of division of the shield are shown
in Fig. 3.5. Comparison of this figure with Fig.
3.4 shows that an important saving in aircraft gross
weight and a drastic reduction in reactor power can

be effected through the use of chemical fuel

augmentation. Furthermore, as the chemical fuel
is burned during the sprint, the aircraft speed and
altitude can be increased in comparison with the
values for the initial sprint condition, Yet another
important advantage of burning up the fuel would be
that the gross weight would be substantially
reduced for landing.

A parametric study such as this is dependent
upon the assumptions that form the bases for the
Perhaps the most important of the
assumptions were the lead-water shield
weight estimates prepared during the 1953 Summer
Shielding Session.

These weight estimates were based on Lid Tank
Facility tests, and calculated allowances were made

seems likely that the weight of an actual full-scale
shield would be within 10% of the estimates. If

saving of possibly 10% might be effected. A second
major assumption was the use .of a fluoride fuel
having physical properties equivalent to those of
NaF-KF-LiF-UF,. If a high-viscosity fuel, such
as the NaF-ZrF,-UF, mixture developed for the
ARE, were to be used, the resulting loss in the
performance would be roughly equivalent to an
increase of 100°F in the temperature drop from
the peck fuel temperature to the turbine air inlet
temperature. A third major assumption was that the
NaK-to-air radiator would make use of a core with
nickel fins similar to that for which full-scale
radiator performance curves were given in ORNL.

fin materials and somewhat better heat transfer
geometries can be developed. It is possible that
these improvements may serve to reduce the
temperature drop from the NoK to the air by as
much as 100°F,

ducted with air as the working fluid to facilitate
changes in the vital pump volute—core inlet region,
The distribution and the direction of flow were
determined by the use of tufts. A careful evaluation
of the tuft patterns indicated the need for cutoffs
in the pump volutes and turning vanes around one
quadrant of the impeller periphery to obtain uniform
flow distribution at the core inlet. After experi-
menting with a number of arrangements, it was
found that the configuration of Fig. 3.7 was the
most satisfactory because it operated with no
appreciable flow separation, This arrangement is
the same as that envisioned in the designs presented
in the previous report, except in the details of the
shape of the turning vanes.

After the pump discharge—core inlet region had
been investigated, a qualitative study was made of

the flow in the core by using a tuft on the end of a
wire probe. The results indicated that the rovnded
flow nozzle shown at the core inlet’ is necessary
to avoid regions of unstable and asymmetric flow in
A set of turbulator vanes placed in the
core inlet passage and designed to produce the
vortex pattern shown in Fig. 3.6 gave better velocity
distribution through the core. From all indications,
it appears that this arrangement satisfies the flow
requirements, namely, axially symmetric flow and
no separation at the core shell wall.

Fabrication of the equipment required to convert
the system to permit flow tests with water has been
started. With the water system, it is expected that

Pitot-tube traverses of the core and header regions

REACTOR CALCULATIONS

M. E. LaVerne
ANP Division

C. S. Burtnette

Specifications were prepared for a parametric
study of a set of 48 related reactors in which the
parameters of core diameter, reflector thickness,
and fuel thickness will be varied over u wide range.
in this study the effects of the geometry of the
reflector-moderated reactor on the physical quanti-
ties of interest, such as critical mass, required
mole per cent of uranium in the fuel, and power
distribution, will be ascertained. Calculations on
this set of reactors are about two-thirds complete;
the remaining calculations are being made as
rapidly as available machine time permits.

As part of a study of a 50-megawatt reactor with
an 18-in, core, a 4-in.-thick fuel annulus, and a
12-in,-thick reflector, reactivity coefficients have
been obtained for Inconel, sodium, and beryllium
as functions of regions within the reactor, In com-
puting these coefficients, the amount of material M
(of Inconel, sodium, or beryllium) was increased in
each region by an amount AM without displacing
any of the other components. The resulting change
in reactivity produced by this idealized experiment
can be of practical significance in critical experi-
ments where voids already exist, In an actual
reactor, the over-all change in reactivity could be
obtained by summing algebraically the effects of
adding one material and removing another,

The reactivity coefficients of Inconel, sodium,
and beryllium are presented in Figs. 3.8, 3.9, and
3.10. Other data of interest are:

with a beryllium reflector and island and a 21-in.-
OD core (with and without Inconel core shells)
similar to those in the two-region reactors. Calcu-
ational difficulties make a firm estimate of critical
mass impossible at this time; however, preliminary
results indicate a critical mass of about 16 Ib for
the two-region reactor with a 1&-in.-dia core. Addi-
tional calculations have been requested for a more
precise determination,

include the introduction of new features which tend
to improve the accuracy of the results, The follow-
ing such features will probably be incorporated:

1. A “P, approximation’ of the angular distri-
bution of the neutron flux, which is an improvement
over the previously used “P, approximation,” will
be used to increase the reliability of the technique,
particularly near the interfaces between media of
different characteristics.

In thin layers, such as

reactor designs, each point is necessarily close to
such an interface. Consideration has been given to
the replacement of the thin layers by special bound-
ary conditions, but these special boundary conditions
will probably become unnecessary with the improved
treatment of the thin layers,

2. For each element, the cross sections will be
averaged over each group and then the group aver-
ages will be averaged over the various elements
present. Previously, the opposite procedure was
used; that is, for a number of lethargy points within
a group the cross sections were averaged over the
elements and then the group average was obtained,
The new procedure greatly simplifies the compu-
tation,

3. Self-shielding'® will be coded into the machine
computations to eliminate the necessity of com-
puting the self-shielding corrections to the cross
sections by hand.

4. Inelastic scattering will be treated in a manner
analogous to fission. The neutron is “‘cbsorbed”
in one lethargy group and each such absorption
gives rise fo sources of neutrons in other lethargy
groups.

5. The ‘Fox technique will be employed.
This is a mathematical trick which eliminates the
necessity of the introduction of ‘trial functions”
for the flux distribution in each lethargy group and
the necessity of repeated iteration. The ‘Fox
technique’’ gives the solution by traversing the
space points in each lethargy group twice.

The actual coding of the technique described
above will be attempted in the near future,

1t has been difficult to compute both ‘‘age-to-

Direct use of tabulated values of o, and 0 has
given 62 cm? for the age and 1.00 for the kgs of a
small reactor. Use of a p-scattering correction to
adjust the age to 80.2 cm? results in a kg value
of 0.90. This inconsistency is not serious for most
reactors of design interest, for which the error in
k gg with p-scattering is about 2%, Therefore it has
been sufficient to assume an inelastic and an
(n,2n) cross section of the proper magnitude to
absorb the k_ error. The cross sections in the

adjusted to give a neutron escape value the same

CHEMICAL PROCESSING OF FLUORIDE FUEL
BY FLUORINATION

F. N. Browder D. E. Ferguson
G. |. Cathers £. 0. Nurmi

Chemical Technology Division

A new, nonaqueous method for processing fuels of
the NaF-Z¢F ,-UF, system from an actual aircraft
reactor has been shown to be feasible. It consists
(1) recovery of the uranium by
converting the uranium tetrafluoride in the molten
NaF-ZrF ,-UF, mixture to the volatile hexafluoride,
using elemental fluorine; (2) gas-phase reduction of
the partially decontaminated UF, to UF,” and
(3) refabrication of the molten salt fuel from this
ur,.'8 Scouting runs made by the Chemical
Technology Division on the first step of the
process have shown that more than 99% of the
fission products and less than 0.05% of the y23s

would remain in the original NaF-ZrF, mixture and

of three steps:

be discarded to waste. The process appears to be
attractive from the standpoint of cost, inventory of
fissionable material, and radioactive waste volume,
The major chemical cost is for the hafnium-free
zirconium fluoride used in the fuel, which is not
recovered, and would be about 25¢ per gram of
y23s The fluorine
would cost only 1¢ per gram of U23% processed,
based on a 4% fluorine efficiency and a unit cost
of $1.00 per pound for fluorine. The process
appears to be less hazardous than the BrF; or
CIF, processes for uranium recovery, since it can
be operated at atmospheric pressure or under a
slight vacuum.

processed, at present prices,

In the scouting runs, fluorine gas was passed
through 100 g of NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %,
8.5 g of uranium per charge) at temperatures above
the melting point (530°C), and the volatilized UF
was recovered in a dry ice trap.
the product was resublimed under vacuum. The
fluorination was carried out in an Incanel vessel
in a table furnace with a dip tube for bubbling
fluorine through the molten salt; atmospheric
pressure was used to minimize any hazard from
leaks. Unused fluorine passed into a chemical
trap of soda lime and alumina.

In some cases,

The fluorine flow,
which was approximately 100 ml/min over a period
of several hours, was controlled by a needle valve
feeding into a glass Rotameter type of flow meter,
but pressure changes in the supply tank of known
volume were considered to be more reliable than
the flowmeter for estimating the total amount of
fluorine used in each run,

In the first two runs (Table 3.5) with 4 and 13
times the theoretical amount of fluorine, 43 and
99.7% of the uranium was volatilized, as determined
by analysis of the NaF-ZrF, residue. In the next
three runs, in which more than 20-fold the stoichi-
ometric amount of fluorine was used, 99.93 to
99.97% of the uranium was volatilized and good
material balances were obtained. The low fluorine
efficiency was probably partly due to the poor
contact between the gas and the molten salt. There
no evidence in any of the experiments of
volatilization of ZrF,. The line leading from the
fluorinator to: the trap was kept at 70°C to prevent
deposition of UF.

The charge ‘in the last three runs was spiked with
fission products to the extent of 2 x 10° beta
counts/min. Gross beta decontamination factors
of 100 to 270 were obtained in the fluorination
step (Table 3.6). The major contaminants of the

was

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1954

product were ruthenium and niobium, ond radic-
chemical analysis of the residue showed that
over 90% of the ruthenium and 60 to 80% of the
niobium had followed the uranium. Sparging of the
molten salt prior to fluorination would therefore
lead to better decontamination from ruthenium and
niobium, as well as from the more volatile short-
lived fission products. The possibility of loss
during nuclear operation of some ruthenium and
niobium, as well as of halogen and rare gas fission
products, is also indicated.

In two runs, part of the UF, product was re-
sublimed into a second dry ice trap under vacuum.
An over-all gross beta decontamination factor of
4000 to 5000 was obtained in both cases (Table
3.6). The poor yield of 33% in one case was due
to partial hydrolysis of UF, in the first trap be-
cause of faulty drying and conditioning of the
apparatus. Better conditioning would undoubtedly
improve the yield in both the fluorination and the
sublimation steps.

a hydrogen density similar to that of water in the
supercritical state, serves as the neutron reflector
and as part of the moderator. The fissionable
material, enriched uranium in an aqueous solution

tubes. The effective loading for initial criticality
was about 5 kg of U23% without stainless steel
inserts in the core. Stainless steel is inserted in
the core by loading % ¢-in-OD tubes into the
UO,F, solution. In the current experiments the
designed dimensions and composition of the core
are being approached by varying the height of the
organic liquid reflector and moderator (assumed to
be the effective core height) as a function of the
number of fuel tubes loaded at increasing steel-to-
uranium ratios.

A preliminary assembly of the AC-100-A, air-
cooled, water-moderated reactor of the General Elec-
tric Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project was made,
The fuel is enriched-uranium metal disks placed be-
tween steel disks. The disks are mounted inside
aluminum tubes, 4 in. in diameter. The fuel section
is 30 in. high. Thirty-seven aluminum tubes, in a
pattern designed to give uniform radial power, con-
stitute the core. The core is immersed in water,

which serves as the neutron moderator and as an
effectively infinite reflector. In order to make the
system initially critical, it was necessary to
deviate significantly from the prescribed loading
by increasing the uranium from 26.6 to 45.6 kg and
by decreasing the steel content by about one-half.
A series of measurements is being made to ascertain
the cause of the discrepancy between the reactivity
of the experiment as designed and that which could
be made critical. The details of the experiments
will be reported by the General Electric Company.

REFLECTOR-MODERATED REACTOR

D. Scott B. L. Greenstreet

ANP Division

The critical experiment program for the reflector-
moderated reactor has been altered to provide more
fundamental information than that obtained by
previous experiments. The earlier work was
designed for direct measurements on rough mockups
of possible reactors, with the purpose of es-
tablishing design parameters. These mockups were,
in general, of complicated geometry and usually
contained materials unique to the unit being studied.
The effort in the immediate future will be centered
on reflector-moderated assemblies of simple
geometry, and material variations will be made
to check consistency with theory and the funda-
mental constants. These results should also aid in
the evaluation of previous
critical assemblies.

It is now planned, first, to build a basic reflector.

The fuel region is to contain uranium
and a fluorocarbon plastic, Teflon, to simulate the
fluoride fuels, and the reflector region will contain
beryllium, The fuel region is to be rhombicubocta-
hedral (essentially, a cube with the edges and
corners cut away) to approximate a sphere within
the limitations imposed by the shape of the availa-
ble beryllium. The purpose of this first experiment
is to check machine calculations. The program is
set up to then follow either of two alternatives,
depending on the results from the first assembly.

If the experiments confirm the theoretical calcuy-
lations to a sufficient degree, three-region octa-
hedrons with a beryllium "‘island’’ separated from
the reflector by the fuel will be built. The first of
these assemblies will have no Inconel core shells,
the second will include Inconel, and the final one
will mock up the reactor, including the end ducts.
In the event that poor agreement between theory and
the first experiment is found, a second two-region
assembly of different core size will be constructed.

46

In all cases, the fuel region will be built of alter-
nating sheets of uranium metal and Teflon to
permit some variation in the uranium density. The
uranium sheets are to be 0.004 in. thick, and they
will be coated with a protective film to reduce
surface oxidation. The Teflon sheets will be
%e and Ys in. thick to make possible fairly
homogeneous distribution of the uranium. The
reflector and the reflector-moderator will be beryl-
lium metal.

MATERIALS RESEARCH
5. CHEMISTRY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIQUIDS

W. R. Grimes
Materials Chemistry Division

A number of four-component systems with low
UF, concentrations have been re-examined in the
continuing effort to obtain fuels with physical
properties better than those of the NaF-ZrF -UF,
system. The low viscosity reported for a NaF-KF-
ZrF -UF, mixture has served to stimulate interest
in this system, and additional thermal data are
being obtained, Other systems being studied by
thermal analysis are NaF-LiF-ZrF-UF,, NaF-
BeF,-ZrF ,-UF,, NaF-LiF-BeF,-UF ,. Thermal
analyses were also made of the RbCI-UCI; and
NaCl-ZrCl, systems. The study of the NaCl-ZrCl,
system was initiated to verify the low melting
points reported in the literature for this system. A
low-melting-point water-soluble mixture of this
type would be of interest for removal of fluorides
from equipment. Also, the quenching technique
applied previously to NaF-ZrF, mixtures has been
used along with x-ray and petrographic examination
of slowly cooled specimens to obtain a better
understanding of the complex phase relationships
in the NaF-UF, and NaF-ZrF, systems. High-
temperature phase separation has proved to be a
useful tool for studying systems in which solid
solutions are expected and for which petrographic
and x-ray examination can, accordingly, give only
rough approximations of the composition of the
separated phases. The systems NaF-ZrF,, NaF-
ZrF 4-UF,, and NaF-KF-ZrF ;-UF, were studied by
using this technique.

The experimental production facilities for the
preparation of fluoride mixtures have been modified
and expanded for supplying the research materials
required for the long-range ANP program. The
250-1b capacity equipment has also been reactivated
to supply the fluoride mixtures orderedby the Pratt
and Whitney Aircraft Division of United Aircraft
Corporation and the sizeable demands of the
ORNL-ANP program.

Analyses for silica in two purified batches of
St(OH), confirmed the finding that less than 500
ppm of silica is introduced ‘by passage of the
material through a fine sintered-glass filter.
Additional studies of the reaction of sodium hy-
droxide with carbon have confirmed that graphite is
oxidized by NaOH at elevated temperatures. Conse-

quently, the carbonate content of molten NaOH will
increase

The experimental study of the reaction of chromium
metal with UF, in molten NaZrFg was repeated
with the use of improved techniques, and the
reaction of iron with UF, in this solvent was also
studied. These experiments have shown that the
deviation of the activity coefficients from unity is

probably due to the formation of complex ions such
as UF;~, UF™7, and FeF;7. Two methods for
producing NaZrF; melts containing UF; were
developed. One sample, filtered at 600°C, was
found to contain 3.54 wt % UF;, and another,
filtered at 700°C, contained 5.95 wt % UF,.
Evidence was accumulated which showed that no
mechanism’ for storing latent reducing power in a
nonuranium-bearing fluoride melt is afforded by the
presence of ZrF ( and, as a corrolary, that there are
no prospects for imparting hydrogenous character
to a melt by means of ZrH, solubility. Rates of
reduction of NiF, and FeF, by hydrogen in nickel
reactors were determined at 600 and 700°C. Further
determinations of absorption spectra for UF, and
UF, in quenched fluoride melts were carried out
with a Beckman DU spectrophotometer, and ad-
ditional decomposition potential measurements in
KCl melts in a hydrogen atmosphere were made.

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

NaF-LiF-ZiF UF,

It was previously reported? that the ternary
mixture NaF-LiF-ZrF , (40-20-40 mole %) melted at
426°C; however, data presented in the same report
showed thot the melting points increased con-
siderably with increases in UF, concentration.
Additional data have been taken to confirm these
findings and to explore the effect of UF, on other
ternary compositions. The addition of 5 mole %
UF, to the 40-20-40 mole % composition mentioned
above gave a mixture witha melting point of 485°C,
which is in reasonable agreement with the previous
data. The lowest melting point so far established
at the 4 mole % UF level is 470°C for NaF-ZrF ,-
LiF-UF, (24-38.4-33,6-4.0 mole %). This mixture
has a melting point that is nearly 50°C less thon
that of NoF-ZrF ,-UF, (53-43.4-3.6 mole %).

NoF-BeF ,-ZrF UF,

Some thermal data were obtained with mixtures in
the NaF-BeF,-ZrF (-UF , system in connection with
a study of Bef, pump seals.®? These data were
collected by mixing various amounts of Bef. with
a ternary mixture NoF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %)
and running cooling curves with the resulting
mixtures, A limited thermal analysis of this four-
component system has been conducted by adding
UF, in amounts of up to 10 mole % to six low-
melting-point ternary mixtures and observing the
thermal effects when the fused mixtures are allowed
to cool, In all cases the melting points of mixtures

containing 2 or 2.5 mole % UF, were higher than
that of the ternary mixture. The minimum melting
point at this uranium level was about 450°C, At
the 4 mole % level, the minimum melting point was
near 460°C, Although this investigation can be
regarded as only preliminary, the melting points
observed do not seem low enough to justify a
detailed examination of the system unless it seems
to be attractive because of other physical properties.

NaF.Lif-BeF UF,

Two compositions in the NaF-LiF-BeF,-UF,
system were subjected to thermal analysis in
connection with the preparation of ternary mixtures
for viscosity determination. The thermal effects
observed on cooling curves, which may be too low
because of supercooling, are shown in Table 5.1,

The mixture NaF-LiF-BeF, (35-20-45 mole %)
was chosen for viscosity tests to be made by the
Physical Properties Group in the near future.
Viscosity data obtained from another installation,
which indicate that LiBeF, has a much higher
viscosity thon that of NaBeF,, strongly influenced
the choice.

The UCI, systems, particularly KCI-UCl, and
RbCI-UCI ,, have shown poorer reproducibility of
thermal effects than the uci, systems, and the
liquidus for these two systems cannot at the present
time be located with certainty in the low-melting-
point regions extending from about 40 to 60 mole %
uct. It appears that other techniques, such as
quenching, filtration, or differential thermal analy-
sis, will be required to determine accurately the
melting points and phase relationships in these
regions. Petrographic examination has been less
satisfactory for determining compound compositions
in fused chloride mixtures than in the fluoride sys-
tems becouse of difficulty in handling the very
hygroscopic samples, reaction of the solid material
with some refractive index oils, and lack of pure,
crystalline compounds for standards. Oxide phases
are apparently not so easily observed in chloride
melts as in fused flucrides.

An investigation of the NaCl-ZrCi, system was

The quenching technique previously applied to
NaF-ZrF, mixtures has been used along with x-ray
and petrographic examination of slowly cooled
specimens to obtain a better understanding of the
complex phase relationships in the NaF-UF, and
NaF-ZrF, systems. The materials used in these
studies were, in each case, prepared in small
batches by the hydroflucrination-hydrogenation
technique described in subsequent paragraphs of

NaF-UF

Previous thermal analysis of this system ? showed
two compounds: Na, UF, which melts incongruently,
and NaUF., which melts congruently. Zachariasen
also reported!? the compound Na, UF, and recent
thermal analyses have confirmed the existence of
this material. The compound Na UF, appears to
melt incongruently a few degrees above the eutectic
temperature, While it appears that the major phase
fields are well established in this system, the
range of existence of the several stable modifica-
tions of Na, UF is still in doubt; there are also
some questions regarding possible
modifications of Na UF..

Zachoriasen reported three forms of Na,UF
a (cubic), 8, (hexagonal), and y (orthorhombic).
However, slowly cooled compositions containing
22 to 50 mole % UF, prepared in this laboratory
show a fourth form designated as S; (hexagonal).
Data obtained by petrographic and x-ray diffraction
of nine such specimens are shown in Table 5.2.

When material of the- Na, UF, composition was
quenched from temperatures in the range 390 to
to 747°C, it was not possible to obtain a glass
without some crystalline material. The a (cubic)
form of Na, UF was the predominant phase at
610°C and above. At 604°C and below, the B form
was the principal phase, One sample quenched at
590°C, however, showed nearly pure B, crystals.
Further studies will be necessary to determine the
stability range of the $8, form and to explain the
absence of the y form,

The observance of crystalline phases with the
Na UF, structure with refractive indices ranging
from about 1,414 to 1.428 indicates possible solid
solution formation between Na UF. and Na,UF ..
Crystalline phases with approximately the same
refractive index but with different degrees of bire-
fringence, along with some crystals which show
anomalous interference colors, are also observed.

it appears likely that there are also different crys-

compositions in this region showed thermal effects
well below the solidus temperature.

Quenches with 37, 40, and 43 mole % UF, compo-
sitions at 690 to 7199¢C produced only fsotropic
material believed to be glass. Quenches with the
50 mole % NaF—-50 mole % UF, mixture in the same
temperature range produced fibrous birefringent
crystals, The refractive index of these crystals
was approximately the same as that reported for

but a more recent determination gave 714°C; this
is the value reported by Kraus. !!

The methods and apparatus described previously

Petrographic and x-ray diffraction examinations
of slowly cooled preparations have led to postula-
tion of a compound at 40 mole % Zk This ma-
terial, for which published data’? 4 show some
evidence, is nearly isotropic and often exhibits a
distinctly fibrous structure; its refractive index is
1.470 (birefringence, 0.004).
Na, ZrF appears in preparations containing as much
as 42 mole % ZrF ,, the 40% compound (Na, Zr,F,,)
must melt incongruently, Examination of quenched
specimens of 43 mole % ZrF |, which were previously
equilibrated after cooling from higher temperatures,
has shown this material to be close to a eutectic
composition; the melting point appears to be 495°C.

Since anisotropic

Slowly cooled specimens of the 50 mole % ZrF
material have produced mixtures of two phases.
One of these phases, with refractive indices of
0 = 1.508 and E = 1.500, was previously believed
to be NaZrF; the other material, with refractive
indices a = 1,420 and y = 1,432, is believed to be
Na, Zr Fo 14 In addition, a third phase known as
R-3 (refractive indices of O = 1.445 and E = 1.417),
which is described below, occurs frequently in
compositions containing 47 to 57 mole % ZrF,.
Studies of this system are complicated by the fact
that liquidus and solidus temperatures are very
close together in this region and, in oddition,
liquidus temperatures appear to depend on previous
thermal history of the specimen. Samples quenched
after heating to a high temperature (750°C) followed
by equilibration at temperatures near the liquidus
show lower liquidus temperatures than those which
have never been above the equilibration tempera-
ture, However, the following observations seem to
be justified.

Data from quenching experiments, in agreement
with previous thermal data, show the liquidus
temperature at 57 mole % ZrF, (near the Na Zr Fo
composition) to be 530°C. The primary phase “rom

However, if NaZrF and Na Zr Fo coexist be-
low the solidus at 50 mole % ZrF,, then Na, Zr Fo
must be the primary phase, Numerous quenches at
this composition hove shown that this is not the
case. When equilibrium is approached from higher
temperatures with 50 mole % ZF, only glass or
glass with R-3 is found above 511°C, Below 511°C,
“NaZrF.'' and Na Zr Fo are found, When equi-
librium is approached from below, ‘‘NaZrF." and
Na Zr ,F,, coexist at as high as 519°C; above
this temperature, glass or glass and R-3 are found.

When equilibrium is approached from higher
temperatures with 47 mole % ZrF,, the liquidus
temperature is 510°C; “*NaZ:F.’’ and liquid co-
exist at as high as 523°C when approached from
below, The solid phase is ““NaZrF,," alone, in
either cuse,

While other explanations are possible, it appears
that the crystalline material of refractive indices
0 = 1.508 and E = 1.500 is not NaZrFg but
NagZr Fi this material probably melts congruently
at 523°C and has a eutectic with Na,Zr Fo at
about 52 mole % Zri,. The NagZroF compound
forms solid solutions with NayZr, Fin which the
optical properties vary in a uniform manner with
composition,

The unidentified phase R-3 which has appeared
over the 45 to 57 mole % ZrF, range has almost
without exception been associated with a glass
phase. In one case, a sample containing 49.9
mole % ZrF, that was quenched from ao temperature
far above the liquidus was nearly pure R-3, Samples
of this material equilibrated at 485 and 498°C be-
fore quenching yielded crystals too small for
petrographic examination; x-ray diffraction indi-
cated that the material had decomposed completely
into NagZrgF | and Na Zr Fo. Itis possible that
R-3 is the compound NaZrF.,

Samples of ZrF, containing 1 to 5 mole % MaF,
cooled slowly from temperatures above the liquidus,
show coexistence of ZrF, with small amounts of
Na Zr Fo. It seems obvious that no complex
compounds of ZrF, content higher than 57 mole %
exist in this system.

FILTRATION ANALYSIS OF FLUORIDE
SYSTEMS

C. J. Barton R. J. Sheil

Materials Chemistry Division

High-temperature phase separation by filtration,
os described in previous reports, 3:16 has been
applied to a number of materials during the past
quarter. This technique has, in general, been
reserved for studies in which solid solutions are
expected and for which petrographic and x-ray
examination can, accordingly, give only rough ap-
proximations of the compositions of the seporated
phases. Since enough material is used in the fil-
tration experiments to provide samples adequate
for chemical analysis, the filtration technique is a
useful too! for studying solid solutions,

NoF-ZrF

In filtration of NaF-ZrF , samples containing 37
mole % ZrF, at 560°C, 96% of the charge was re-
covered as filtrate; similar filtration at 537°C
yielded 75% of the charge. In each case, the
residue was found by petrographic examination to
be predominantly Na, ZrF . Chemical analysis of
the residue at 537°C confirmed this finding. The
filtrate cooled in each case to a mixture of a nearly
cubic phase and Na, Zr; the cubic phase is,
presumably, Na Zr, F,, as described above.
There seems to be no evidence for solid solutions
in the range 33 to 40 mole % ZrF,.

NoF-ZrF UF,

Two filtrations with NaF-ZrF ,-UF samples con-
taining 85 mole % NaF and 7.5 mole % ZF, indi-
cate that NaF is the primary phase in this region.
When NoF precipitates sufficiently to reduce the
concentration of this material to 81 mole %, «
second phase appears which is rich in ZrE i
composition of the liquid then moves toward that
of the NaF-UF, binary. Additional studies in this
region will be made as time permits, since it op-
pears that previous thermal analyses do not reliably
indicate the liquidus temperature.

Some data on the pseudo binary system Na, UF;
Na,ZrF were presented in a previous report,16
Additional filiration data obtained during the past
quarter have shown essentially complete miscibility
of these compounds in the solid state, at least to
92 mole % Na UF. Behavior of materials of higher

uranium content will be determined as time permits.

the ternary system NaF-KF-ZrF 17 However, ther-
mal analysis indicated that the melting point of such
low melting compositions was raised considerably
by small amounts of UF,. This point has been
checked during the past quarter by filtration of
material containing NaF-KF-ZrF, (5-52-43 mole %)
to which excess UF, had been added. Only 1.2
mole % UF, and 2.4 mole % UF, were dissolved at
426 and 503° C, respectively. While these values
do not necessarily represent the maximum solu-
bility obtainable at these temperatures, they do
verify the low solubility of UF,, as shown by
thermal analysis.

in laboratory-scale apparatus. Seventeen of these
batches were special preparations to be used in
reduction and kinetic studies for which a higher
than normal degree of purity is required. The de-
sited purity was obtained by hydrogen reduction of
the structural metal fluorides at 800°C to approxi-

A total of 385.5 kg of fluoride mixtures was pre-
pared during the quarter in the equipment in Building
9928. Of this quontity, the. greatest portion con-
sisted of NaF-ZrF -UF (50-46-4 mole %) and NaF-
ZrF, (50-50 mole %). In order to eliminate the use
of any fluoride mixture of unknown purity which
could possibly invalidate important research, a
policy has been instituted which does not allow
release of any material until all analyses have
been completed and evaluated,

Planning for conversion of the facilities in Build-
ing 9928 for producing berryllium-bearing fluoride
mixtures is essentially complete, with actual work
scheduled to begin in a few weeks, Recommenda-
tions of the Y-12 Health Physics Division have
been followed in the planning of this equipment
revision,

The additional experimental fluoride facility
being installed in the basement of Building 9201-3
is progressing rapidly, insofar as the processing
equipment is concerned. Installation of utilities to
serve this equipment is expected soon.

These changes and equipment increases are due
to the need for greater experimental versatility in
fluoride preparations. Until recently, the entire
efforts of this group have been directed toward pro-
viding sufficient quantities of processed fluorides
to allow all testing necessary to the ARE program,
Since the ARE program is nearing completion, the

The effort devoted to the purification of hydroxides

Reaction of Sedium Hydroxide with Carbon

Materials Chemistry Division

In a previous report,'? preliminary results were
presented which indicated that carbon or carbe-
naceous matter would react with NaOH at 700°C to
yield Na,CO,. Further studies have shown that
graphite is easily oxidized by NaOH at temperatures
of 500°C or higher,

Graphite (0.2 wt %) was added to NaOH contained
in nickel capsules, which were then sealed under
inert atmospheres and heated for 24 hr at 500°C.
This treatment increased the Na, CO,
the caustic from 0.05 to 0.3 wt %. In similar tests
at 700°C, the Na,CO, concentration increased
from 0.06 to 0.6 wt %, That this increase is not
due to NiO on the capsule walls or to diffusion of

content of

air through the capsules has been shown by using
hydrogen-fired capsules and enclosing the sealed
capsules in a quartz envelope filled with purified
helium. The results leave no room for doubt that
graphite is oxidized by NaOH at elevated tempera-
tures. Consequently, the carbonate content of
molten NaOH will increase if any carbonoceous
matter is present.

the formula weight of NaZrF, was assumed to
represent 1 mole, the values given here are smaller
by about a factor of 2. When compared on the same
basis, the K_ values reported here are only slightly

values listed here are probably more accurate,
since the soluble chromium ‘‘blank’” has been

reduced from 900 to 200 ppm.

The reaction

has been evaluated by using similar techniques.
Iron wire, hydrogen fired ot 900°C, was used for
these studies. The system was virtually free of
FeQ; only 100 ppm of soluble iron was found in
blank runs.

[n nearly all cases, analysis indicated that all
the dissolved iron was in the ferrous state, and no
UF, was detected petrographically. It is possible
that the equilibrium concentrations are so low that
no discrete crystals of the material are formed.
The experimental data, along with the K_ values
calculated in the manner described above, are
shown in Table 5.4,

From the data shown in Tables 5.3 and 5.4, it is

However, if the standard states, that is, the crystal-

the activity coefficient will include, at temperatures
below the melting point of the constituent, a cor-

this correction is in many cases negligible in com-

states have been adopted as the reference states.

Since this value drops to 2.45 at 800°C, it appears
that the complex ferrous ion is not very stable at
high temperatures, It seems likely that of the

the former are much less complete than the latter

hardly complexed, even at 600°C, while UF, is
more than 90% complexed, even at 800°C,

The increase in Ya Veer YUE, between

It is recognized that many additional experiments
on these reactions are needed and that there may
be alternative explanations of the dota, However,
these conclusions are in good agreement with

that these studies will be continued and, perhaps,
augmented in the future,

Formation of UF; in NaF.ZrF, Melts

C. M. Blood F. P. Boody
G. M. Watson

Materials Chemistry Division

Two methods for producing NaZrF, melts con-
taining UF, have been developed and studied. In
the first method, dissolved UF is reduced to UF,
by using hydrogen or, preferably, metallic zir-
conium or uranium, or zirconium or sodium hydride.

60

In the second method, added uranium metal is
oxidized by the melt according to the reaction

4U%(crystal) + 3ZrF (solution) =>
3Zr%(crystal) + 4UF ;(solution)

or, in the presence of hydrogen, according to the
reaction

3H,(gas) + 4U°(crystal) + 3ZrF (solution) —>
3ZrH, (crystal) + 4UF (solution) .

The reduction of UF, in such melts by hydrogen
gas is too slow to be of practical interest. Treat-
ment at 800°C of 3 kg of a mixture containing
6.5 mole % UF, with 600 liters of hydrogen gas
for 30 hr yielded 4.4 moles of HF per liter of exit
hydrogen and, on the basis of HF produced, should
have converted about 5% of the contained UF, to
UF,. Traces of free UF; were visible on petro-
graphic examination of the melt. Heretofore,
olive-drab and orange-red reduced phases were
found, but no free UF; was observed when ftri-
valent uranium species were present in such low
concentrations. However, a similar treatment of
molten Na,UF, yielded a five- to tenfold lower
rate of HF production; the amount of reduction
produced by 850 liters of hydrogen in this system
was not detected on petrographic examination.
These differences in rate, as well as the nature of
the trivalent uranium species, are probably related
to the influence of free NaF on the activity coef-
ficient of UF,. They suggest that measurement of
rate of reaction of UF, with hydrogen in various
melts can provide a relative rating of corrosivity of
the melt.

Two batches of material containing UF; with
virtually no UF, were prepared by the addition of
uranium metal to NaZrF_ in an amount sufficient to
produce 2 mole % of UF;. In one case, hydrogen
was admitted to the reactor at a low temperature so
that UH; could be formed and subsequently dis-
sociated as the temperature was raised. By using
this technique, the meta! was finely
divided and a large surface area was exposed; the
reaction was complete in 2 hours. In the other
attempt, hydrogen was admitted only at a tempera-
ture too high for UH, formation, and after 2 hr of
reaction time, only 90% of the uranium had reacted.

The latter batch was filtered at 600°C, and a
sample of the filtrate was found to contain 3.54 wt %

of UF. This material was circulated for 520 hr in

uranium
an Inconel thermal convection: loop, and no cor-
rosion was detected. However, during transfer of
the material to the loop, insufficient time was given
for the segregated UF;-bearing phases to re-
dissolve; accordingly, the material in the loop
contained 3.31 wt % (1.23 mole %) of UF.

Another sample to which 5.5 wt % of uranium
(equivalent to 6.8 wt % of UF,) had been added
yielded, on filtration at 700°C, a filtrate containing
more than 85% of the added uranium (5.95 wt % of
UFJ).

On petrographic examination, the UF;-saturated
NoZrFy melts usually show NagZr FF, as the
major phase, with some of the orange-red UF ;-
2ZrF, and small amounts of UF, and an un-
identified yellow phase present.

Treatment of Molten NaZrF, with Strong
Reducing Agents

G. M. Watson
C. M. Blood F. P. Boody
Materials Chemistry Division

Evidence accumulated during the past quarter
has confirmed that no mechanism for storing latent
reducing power in a nonuranium-bearing fluoride
melt is afforded by the presence of ZrF, and, as a
corollary, that there are no prospects for imparting
hydrogenous character to a melt by means of ZrH,
solubility. It was previously reported?? that the
loss of weight by zirconium metal in contact with
liquid NoZrF. contained in graphite at 800°C far
exceeds the loss that could be attributed to reaction
with impurities. The possibility of zirconium metal
going into solution, either as the trifluoride or as
dissolved elemental metal, was strongly suggested
by the relatively large reducing power (40 to 150
meq/kg) of the filtered melt, as found by chemical
analysis.

In order to test further for the presence or absence
of reducing power in these fuels, a treated and
filtered melt having a reported reducing power of
80 meq/kg was treated with 100 mea/kg of nickel
fluoride and brought to 800°C in a nickel container
under a helium atmosphere. After a 24-hr equi-
libration period with continuous helium stirring at
800°C, hydrogen was bubbled through the melt, and
the yield of hydrogen fluoride was measured. The
number

of milliequivalents of hydrogen fluoride

thus obtained matched closely the yield expected
for the reduction of the NiF, by H, and indicated
that the zirconium-treated melt had little, if any,
latent reducing power. This result is in agreement
with the belief that intermediate valence states of
zirconium dare not stable under the conditions of
these experiments and that elemental zirconium
exhibits no physical solubility in fluoride mixtures

at 800°C.

A qualitative test for reducing power was made
by adding known amounts (1 and 2 mole %) of
uranium tetrafluoride to separate portions of a
i¢ . bad . . .

reducing’ melt. The mixtures were contained in

nickel crucibles and kept at BO0O°C for several
hours in a helium atmosphere. The resulting
melts were examined petrographically for the

presence of reduced phases. Negligible reduction
of the UF, was noted. A control experiment with
zirconium hydride added at a concentration of 200
meq/kg to give reducing power showed obvious
reduction, even upon visual inspection.

The conclusion was reached that no latent
reducing power can be developed in NaZrFg by
treatment with Zr° and that the apparent reducing
power obtained by wet analytical methods was in
error. Whether or not the formation of ZrC with
the graphite liner was responsible for the previ-
ously reported disappearance of zirconium is not
known.

It is apparently impossible to dissolve appreciable
amounts of zirconium hydride in NaZrFg. In two
trials, zirconium hydride was formed by the addition
of 1 mole of sodium hydride per kilogram of NaZrF
and subsequent heating to 800°C under sufficient
hydrogen pressure to prevent the decomposition of
the zirconium hydride. In each case, a residue,
identified as zirconium hydride, remained in the
reactor after filtration at 700 to 800°C.

The presence of zirconium hydride in the filtrate
was tested by the addition of UF, followed by
equilibration and petrographic examination of the
resultant mixture, as described above. This test
indicated only a very slight reduction of the
uranium tetrafluoride. Since this method is,
apparently, very sensitive, no further attempts at
determination of the reducing power, if any, of the
melt were made.

hydrogen fluoride was independent of the length of
pretreatment with inert gas and could be reproduced
to within 4%, The rate of reaction is enhanced
12- to 14-fold at 800°C in nickel, as compared with
graphite, although the gas inlet tube is nickel,
of the container

regardless construction. The

increase in the rate of reaction is roughly pro-
portional to the approximately ninefold increase
in nickel surface in contact with the reacting

mixture and suggests a catalytic effect by the
nickel surface.

An experimental reaction order approaching
unity with respect to nickel fluoride concentration
appears to hold for a portion of the reaction at 600
and 700°C. The kinetics of this reaction in
graphite containers appear to be more complex. An
energy of activation of about $000 cal is obtained
by comparison of rates at 600 and 700°C in nickel
apparatus.

The rapid decrease of hydrogen fluoride concen-
tration with volume of hydrogen passed (half-life
volume about 1 liter at 800°C for 3 kg of NaZrF,)
suggests that stripping of the HF produced is the
rate-controlling step and that the solubility of HF
in the melt is low. A solubility coefficient,
(HF) HE) of 2 kg/liter is obtained if it is
assumed that the experimentally measured HF
concentration in the effluent gas represents equi-
librium conditions.

When rates of reduction of FeF, in
NaZrFg in nickel were measured, the
yield of hydrogen fluoride was reproducible to
within 2% and amounted to about 93% of the
theoretical value if the ferrous fluoride used was
assumed to be 100% pure. A comparison of the
rates of reduction of nickel and ferrous fluorides
at equal concentrations (10 meq/kg) showed that
nickel was reduced about 60 times faster than was
ferrous fluoride.

Spectrophotometry of Supercooled Fused Salts
H. A. Friedman

Materials Chemistry Division

Determinations of absorption spectra for UF,
and UF, in quenched fluoride melts with a Beckman
DU spectrophotometer have been continued.?® As

previously reported, 4 two characteristic spectrum

patterns have been found in the NaF-ZrF,-UF,
ternary, Special attention has been given to
regions which might show a new pattern or «a

transition between the two prevalent types.

The results withrespect to pattern type are shown
in Fig, 5.2. Transitions were found to occur as
the ratio of F™ to UF, plus ZrF, changed from
1:1 to 2:1 (that is, between 50 and 67 mole % NaF).
Inability to supercool in many composition ranges
without forming crystals has hampered the work
considerably. In order to obtain rapid cooling,
samples which contained only 15 to 20 mg of
fluorides were used, and of some 90 quenches
performed during the quarter, in 25% of the cases
crystals were successfully avoided. It is parti-
cularly disappointing that binary mixtures of
NaF-UF, containing 50 mole % and more of UF,
have not given glasses, since the glasses would
make possible an interpretation of some aspects of
the NaF-UF, binary system and, perhaps, a
determination of whether UF ;™ exists in the liquid
state.

The spectra of a mixture containing 40 mole %
UF, and 60 mole % ZrF, were obtained for both a
crystalline solid solution and a glass. These
spectra are compared with each other and with the
spectrum of crystalline UF, in Fig. 5.3.

An attempt was made to study the spectra of
glasses in the UF; -NaF binary system. The only
compositions which could be quenched to glass
were the 10, 20, 50, and 60 mole % UF, samples,
and, even in these cases, some quench growth
occuired. These drab, brown glosses gave very
poorly resolved patterns with no prominent maximums
and minimums.

In a preliminary attempt to produce a glass in the
UF,-NaF system, potassium bromide was used as a
dispersing medium. Crystalline UF, was ground
with dried potassium bromide, and a flat,
parent window was made by compressing the mixed

with those found by using a helium atmosphere.28
With chromium anodes (prepared by electroplating
chromium on copper or gold wire) decomposition
potentials at 1.45 to 1.52 volts are measured.
Typical curves obtained for the electrolysis of
KCl by using nickel and chromium anodes are
shown in Fig.5.4, With the decomposition potential
of 1.5 volts obtained with chromium anodes and the
value of 3.15 volts obtained with inert anodes, the
potential of the reaction

CCl, = Cr + Cly

in H, is computed to be 1.6 volts. At this tempera-
ture the standard emf of CrCl, is 1.36 volts and
that of GrCly is 1.08 volts. Thus it appears that
divalent chromium is formed when the metal is
oxidized electrochemically and that the effective
Ce** concentration present is extremely small
because of complexing by the KCI.

Solutions of CrCly in KCI (1 to 2 wt %) were
electrolyzed at potentials of 0.98 to 1.10 volts with
anodes. With nickel anodes, CiCly
solutions show two distinct changes in slope on
current vs. voltage curves with repeated E-/
measurements. The first emf at 0.45 to 0.56 volt
seems to be due to the reaction

Ni + CrCl, = NiCl, + Cr,
E° = 0.54 volt ,

while the second emf at 0.25 to 0.30 volt may be
ascribed to the reaction

3Ni + 2CrCly = 3NiCl, + 2Cr
E° = 0.26 volt.

ANP Division

The static and tilting-furnace corrosion testing
facilities were used for further studies of the
corrosion of ceramic materials, Inconel, and nickel
in fluoride mixtures. Tests made in the tilting-
furnoce apparatus indicate that both hydrofluori-
nation and filtration are important in the control of
the corrosive properties of high-purity fluoride
mixtures. Silicon nitride exposed to NaF-ZrF ,-UF
and NaF-ZrF, for 100 hr ot 800°C under static
conditions showed weight gains of more than 100%,
and therefore tests of this material have been
discontinued. Titanium oxide dissolved almost
completely under similar conditions. Tests of
Inconel specimens exposed to NaF-ZrF, in beryl-
lium oxide crucibles showed that less chromium was
removed from the Inconel at 1000°C than at 800°C,
probably because of the more rapid formation of a
protective layer,

Tilting~-furnace tests in which graphite rod was
added to NaF-ZeF UF, in contact with Inconel
showed that the graphite caused only a slight
increase in the chromium content of the fluoride
mixture; however, powdered graphite caused a more-
than-threefold increase of the chromium concen-
tration under similar conditions. Nickel and Inconel
rods were exposed to fluoride mixtures in air to
test their suitability as materials for sensory
elements in fuel level indicators for the ARE fuel
recovery system. Of these two materials, Inconel
appears to be the more satisfactory,

Corrosion festing in thermal convection loops is
being accelerated by the addition of loop facilities
and modifications of loop design. Additional tests
have confirmed that the corrosion of Inconel in-
creases with operating time when exposed to both
NaF-ZrF ,-UF, and NaF-ZrF, and that the attack
is due to the mass transfer of chromium metal. The
mechanism of this mass transfer is still not
completely understood, but it takes place with very
low concentrations of chromium in the fluoride
mixtures and the concentrations do not change with
time. Chemical analyses of NaF-ZrF ,-UF, after

circulation in Inconel therma! convection loops
have shown that some segregation of the uranium
takes place on cooling.

in loop tests for which the uranium content of the
fluoride mixture was varied, it was established
that the depth of attack in
slowly, but linearly, with increasing uranium
content in the fluoride mixture. The hoped for
absence of corrosion at low temperatures was not
found. There was still considerable attack in the
upper hot-leg sections of loops operated at 1200°F,
LLoops were operated to test special, high-purity,
low-carbon-content Inconel, and almost the same
depth of attack was found as in loops constructed
from commercial tubing. However, these loops,
which were constructed of Y-in. tubing, showed
less attack than that found in similar loops con-
structed of Vein. pipe. The data obtained confirm
the previous conclusion that increasing the surface-
to-volume ratio decreases the depth of attack.

Several 400 series stainless steels were fabri-
cated into loops in which NaF-ZrF -UF, was
circulated for 500 hr at 1500°F. In each loop, a
considerable quantity of metal crystals was found
in the cold leg. The mechanism of the aftack
changes as the chromium content of these steels
increases. With the low-chromium-content alloy,
type 410 stainless steel, removal of the entire
surface was found, while with the high-chromium-
content, type 446 stainless steel, subsurface voids
and surface roughening were found. Considerable
effort has been exerted to get a Hastelloy B loop
to circulate NaF-ZrF -UF, for 500 hr at 1500°F.
All loops failed either through catastrophic oxi-
dation or mishandling. These alloys are hot short
in the temperature range of the test.

An Inconel forced-convection loop in which
NaF-ZrF -UF, was circulated at high velocity
(5 fps) and with a high temperature drop (200°F)
was examined after termination because of plugging.
The examination showed that the plugging was
probably caused by gradual freezing of the fluoride

mixture at a cold spot and not by corrosive attack.
In a further attempt to study corrosion by turbulently
flowing fluorides, an oscillating furnace has been
constructed in which turbulent flow is simulated by
suddenly stopping ond cooling a heated, rotating
V-shaped capsule. Preliminary tests indicate that
the effectof flow is rather small in comparison with
the increase in attack which can be attributed to
the temperature effect,

Static corrosion tests in fluoride mixtures have
been made of many of the brazing alloys developed
by the Welding and Brazing Group, and it has been
found that the nickel-phosphorus and the nickel-
phosphorus-chromium brazing alloys have good
corrosion resistance in NaF-ZrF -UF

The study of corrosion and mass transfer charac-
teristics of container materials in liquid lead bythe
use of quartz thermal convection loops has been
extended to include tests with cobalt, beryllium,
titanium, and Hastelloy B. Results already obtained
for a molybdenum-nickel alloy (25% Mo-75% Ni)
were rechecked, The influence of oxides in re-
tarding mass transfer in a system with type 347
stainless steel inserts was further investigated.

FLUORIDE CORROSION IN STATIC AND

Effect of Methods of Manufacturing the Fuel on the
Corrosion of Inconel

A study was made to ascertain whether cor-
rosiveness would be affected by omission of either
the hydrofluorination or the filtration step in the
preparation of purified fluoride mixtures. Tilting
furnace tests indicated that when hydrofluorination
was omitted the depth of subsurface-void formation
and the amount of chromium in the fluoride mixture
after testing were higher than those observed with
the control mixture prepared by the usual process,
including hydrofluorination and filtration. The
results, which agree with previous findings, show
that both hydrofluorination and filtration are
important in the control of the corrosive properties
of high-purity fluoride mixtures.

Corrosicn of Ceramic Materials

The study of the resistance of nonmetallic
materials to attack by fluoride mixtures has been

66

continued. Silicon nitride exposed to the mixtures
NofF-ZrF ,-UF, (53.5-40.0-6.5 mole %) and NaF-
ZrF, (53.0-47.0 mole %) for 100 hr at 800°C under
static conditions showed weight gains of more than
100%, These weight gains were probably due to the
penetration of the fluorides inte the pores of the
hot-pressed material. Tests with this material
have been discontinued. Titanium oxide (American
lava Corporation body, Al Si Mag No. 192) was
found to dissolve nearly completely when exposed
to the fluoride mixtures under the same conditions,

It was known from previous tests that beryllium
oxide reacts with fluoride
mixtures and that a layer of uranium oxide is
formed on the beryllium oxide. Tests were run
with the mixture NoF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) in
beryllium oxide crucibles fabricated from the ARE
moderator blocks. After exposure of temperatures
of 800 and 1000°C for 100 hr in the presence of
Inconel specimens, the formation of a ZrO, layer
could be observed on the crucible walls. Less

uranium-containing

chromium was found to be removed from the Inconel
at 1000°C than at 800°C, probably because the

reaction
2B=0 + ZrF, _— 2BeF, + ZrO,

is accelerated at the higher temperature and there
is more rapid formation of a protective layer.

Effect of Graphite Additions

The effect of graphite on the behavior of fluoride
mixtures in contact with Inconel was studied by
adding various amounts of graphite in either
powder form or as a rod to NoF-ZrF -UF (53.5-
40,0-6.5 mole %) and exposing the mixtures to the
usual tilting-furnace test, The graphite rod caused
only a slight increase of the chromium concentration
of the fluoride mixture, while addition of large
amounts of powdered graphite resulted in a more-
than-threefold
tration.

Comparison tests were then made in an attempt
to determine the effect of absorbed oxygen in the
powdered graphite, As-received graphite and
graphite which had been outgassed were used. The
outgassing was attempted by heating the graphite
capsules under vacuum to 800°C for 4 hr before
loading and to 400°C for 4 hr after loading. The
vacuum chamber of the furnace was then filled
with helium and the temperature raised to 800°C to
carry out the test. Chemical onalyses of the
fluoride mixtures after the tests did not show

increase of the chromium concen-
changes attributable to outgassing. Microscopic
studies by T. N. McVay revealed the presence of
ZrO, crystals in the fluoride mixtures used in both
tests; so it must be concluded that the attempted
outgassing was not effective in removing all the
oxygen.

Effect on Nickel and Inconel Rods Exposed to
Fluoride Mixtures in Air

fn order to determine a suitable material for
sensory elements to indicate fuel level in the
containers fo be used in the ARE fuel-recovery
operation, Inconel and nickel rods have been
tested for resistance to attack by molten fluorides
in air. The first of these tests was carried out
with NaF-ZrF -UF, (53.5-40,0-6.5 mole %) heated
to 700°C in an open nickel crucible, The Inconel
and nickel rods were held 1 in. from the bottom of
the crucible for 48 hours. Determinations of the
electrical resistance between the crucible and each
rod were made periodically, After 48 hr of contact,
the rods were examined metallographically, and it
was found that the nickel suffered a 50% loss in
cross section, while the Inconel was attacked to a
lesser degree.

In the second fest, the rods were removed
periodically for a 5-min cooling period. During 50
immersions, the resistance between the nickel! rod
and the crucible ranged from 1.2 to 7.5 ohms, while
the resistance between the Inconel rod and the
crucible varied from 0.5 to 1.1 ohms. A heavy
crust was observed to form on the nickel rod
during the test, while only a thin crust formed on
the Inconel rod. The nickel crucible suffered
considerable attack during the tests. Of the two
materials tested, Inconel appears to be the more
desirable for use as sensory elements in fluoride
mixtures.

Another change in the design consisted of replacing
the sharp bends at both junctions of the legs with
curved sections. The curved sections should reduce
the flow resistance and give a slight increase in

velocity,

The emphasis in the loop work is shifting from
500-hr operation to operation for from 1000 to 2000
hours. The longer circulation times are required
for studies of mass transfer. With the shift to
long-time operation, it has been necessary to
increase the number of loops. During this quarter,

FLUORIDE CORROSION OF {INCONEL IN
THERMAL CONVECTION LOOPS

G. M. Adamson
Metallurgy Division

Effect of Exposure Time on Depth of Attack

The results obtained in tests for determining the
effect of exposure time on the corrosion of Inconel!
by high purity NaF-ZrF (-UF , circulated in a thermal
convection loop at 1500°F confirm the results
reported previously. Results from four loops
filled from the same batch of fluorides and circu-
lated for varying times are tabulated in Table 6.1.

The attack continued with time but at a rate
lower than that found in the early stages. The
holes grew in size and became more concentrated
in the grain boundaries with increasing time.
Figure 6.2 presents typical sections from loops
345 and 329. The results given in Table 6.1 show
that chromium metal is mass transferred, that the
chromium concentrations in the fluorides are very

low, and that the chromium concentration remains
fairly constant,

Both
obtained from examination of loop 328, which
operated for 2000 hr, conflict with the results from
other tests in this series and with previous results.
Check samples from this loop have been submitted

the chemical and metallurgical results

for chemical and metallurgical examination, and
the operating record is being closely studied in an
attempt to explain the discrepancies.

The 20 mils of penetration found after the 3000-hr
test with the high-purity fluorides is deeper than
the penetration (18 mils) found in the first series of
tests after 2850 hr of operation with impure fluorides.
The two results are not exactly comparable, because
samples were cut from the loop operated with high-
purity fluorides from an areaabout 2 in. higher up the
hot leg. However, the error resulting from the sam-
pling should be less than 2 mils. In any case, the
recently completed tests indicate that purifying the
fluorides will not result in o reduction in mass
transfer. This conclusion is further confirmed by
results obtained with another loop that circulated
for 3000 hr the same batch of fluorides that had
been further purified by the addition of zirconium
hydride. This loop showed a maximum penetration
of 13.5 mils. While this loop showed a reduction
in depth of attack, it showed about the same

The size and distribution of the holes in this loop
were very similar to those found in loop 329. Metdl

surface.

Effect of Exposure Time on Chemical Stability
of the Fluorides

Changes have been noted in the uranium analyses
of the fluorides both after circulation in thermal
convection loops and after tests in seesaw apparatus.
These chemical changes have usually been ex-
plained as sublimation of zirconium fluoride and as
sampling or analytical errors. The chemical
analyses of the fluorides circulated in the loops
described above are presented in Table 6.2.

The uranium percentage ‘increased 1.2%, while
the zirconium content dropped 2.9%. Although the
zirconium content change is greater than that for
the uranium (if the change is allotted in proportion
to the amounts of all the ingredients present), the
change is not large enough to explain the change
in uranium content as being due to zirconium
sublimation, In addition, the change in the fluorine
is not large enough to substantiate the postulared
sublimation of the zirconium as ZrF 4. However,
the zirconium analyses are not particularly accurate,
and segregation undoubtedly occurred during
cooling, although no low-uranium-content phase
has yet been found.

Effect of Exposure Time on Corrosion by
Nonuronium-Bearing Fluorides

Loops filled from a single batch of NaF-ZrF,
(50-50 mole %) which had been produced for the

The data from this series of tests are tabulated in

these data as from those obtained with Naf-ZrF ,-

continuing attack at a reduced rate. The depth of
attack, however, is less than that obtained with
the vronium-beoring fluorides. It is apparent, even
with nonuranium-bearing mixtures, that chromium
metal may be transferred and that the
chromium concentrations in the fluorides are very
low.

Effect of Variation in Uranium Concentration

Two series of tests were conducted for determining
the effect on corrosion of changes in the uranium
concentration of the fluoride mixture. In the first
series, the fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF ,, with uranium
additions that varied from 0.5 to 15 wt % (0.2 to
7.2 mole % UF,), was circulated, In the second
series of tests, the high-uranium-content fuel
(NaF-ZrF ,-UF,, 53.5-40,0-6.5 mole %) was circu-
lated in three loops. It has now been determined
that the fluorides used in both series of tests
received inadequate and varying amounts of gas
purging during production. The variations in gas
purging lead to varying hydrogen fluoride content
and make the results difficult to interpret.

While the results of these tests cannot be con-
sidered as conclusive, the trends can be partially
confirmed by other results. The two loops operated
with low-uranium-content fluorides, 0.5 and 2.8 wt %,
showed much less attack than was expected, and

70

thus the data are not consistent with the data
obtained from other loops. The two batches of
fluorides used for these tests were probably of
higher purity than the batches used for the other
tests. In spite of the low attack, a very thin,
apparently metallic deposit was found on the
cold-leg wall of each loop. In the other three
loops, in which the uranium contents of the fluoride
mixtures were 5.1, 9.8, 14.4 wt %, respectively, the
attack increased lineorly with increasing uranium
content. A very thin layer was found in the loop
which
mixture, but no layers were found in the other two
loops. While depth of attack increases with in-
creasing uranium content, the probability of layer
formation in the cold-leg decreases.

These results are confirmed if the results obtained
with NaF-ZrF {50-50 mole %), NaF-ZrF ,-UF,
(50-46-4 mole %), and the lowest penetration with
NaF-ZrF ,-UF (53.5-40.0-6,5 mole %) are con-
sidered. The attack in each case showed a small,
but linear, increase from 5 to 7 mils with increasing
uranium content.

Two other Inconel loops were operated for 500 hr
with NaF-ZrF ,-UF (53.5-40.0-6.5 mole %, 14 wt %
U). These loops showed maximum attacks of 16.5
and 10 mils. Since the mixtures circulated were
impure, the attack should be compared with the
9 mils found with impure NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4
mole %).

circulated the lowest-uranium-content
In each of the four loops in which NaF-ZrF ,-UF
(53.5-40.0-6.5 mole %) was circulated, large vari-
ations in uranium content were found, as shown in
Table 6.4. In each loop, the uronium content
varied about 3%, with the lowest values being
found in the hot leg. Similar variations have not
been found with the other fluoride mixtures. Ad-
ditional samples from the lower portion of the hot
leg have now been submitted for analysis. The
segregation of the uranium undoubtedly takes place
during cooling, but it is not certain at what temper-
ature the segregation starts.

Effect of Temperature

In a loop operated at 1250°F, only the upper
portion of the hot leg was attacked, and the attack
was to a depth of 3 mils. It was hoped that at
slightly lower temperatures all attack would be
eliminated. Two loops were therefore operated with
hot-leg temperatures of 1200°F. Loop 390 showed
a maximum hot-leg attack of 5 mils, and in loop
350, the maximum attack in the hot leg was 4 mils.
The samples were cut from an area 2 in. further up
the hot legs of these loops, and therefore the cor-

rosion values are not comparable to those found in
the loop operated at 1250°F. In both loops, the
attack was found only in the upper portion of the
hot leg. The voids were very small and evenly
distributed. Figure 6.3 shows a sample from the
hot leg of loop 350. A hot-leg temperature of
1200°F is the lowest temperature at which fluorides
may be circulated in present loops.

Effect of Variations in Loop Size and Composition

Two loops constructed from Yin. tubing instead
of the customary Yyeina-IPS schedule-40 pipe were
operated with NaF-ZrF ,-UF {50-46-4 mole %).
These loops were operated both as standard loops
for the high-purity fluoride vs. Inconel tests and as
a part of a surface-to-volume ratio study. A maxi-
mum attack of 9 mils was reported previously?
for a loop constructed from l-in. tubing with a
surface-to-volume ratio of 4.5 in.2/in.3, and an
attack of 5.5 mils was reported for a standard loop
with a surface-to-volume ratio of 6.5 in.%/in%.
The ratio in a loop with Y-in. tubing is 10.5
in.2/in.3. The attack found in the Yomi tubing of
loop 359, which had been filled from the same
batch of fluorides as that used for the other two
loops, was moderate to heavy, with a maximum
depth of 4 mils. Loop 362, also constructed of
Vein tubing, showed similar attack to a depth of
3.5 mils, with a few areas extending to 5 mils.

With a thermal convection loop, both the velocity
and the temperature drop change with any change in
pipe size, and these variations probably couse the
deviations from straight-line relationships.

about 0.014% carbon. To further tie up the carbon,
0.31% titanium was added to one heat,

Two loops fabricated from the low-carbon-content
Incone! tubing, one with titanium added and one
without titanium, were filled from the same baich of
fluorides as that used with the bein, commercial
tubing discussed above. The loop (366) without
titanium showed moderate, general, hot-leg attack,
with a maximum penetration of 3.5 mils. The loop
with added titanium, loop 367, also showed moderate
to heavy, general, hot-leg attack to a depth of 3.5
mils. Typical hot-leg sections from these three
loops are shown in Fig. 6.4. Within the limits
studied, very little, if any, reduction in attack was
found. There may have been very slight reduction
in depth of attack, but many more loops would have
to be tested to confirm this. The Inconel was
cleaner than in previous loops and did not contain
as many inclusions.

Corrosion of Various Metal Combinations

A series of Inconel loops has been placed in
operation with various combinations of type 316
stainless steel or nickel inserts in the hot and
cold legs. This series of loops is being operated
for studying the effects of the presence of various
quantities of these metals on the corrosion of
Inconel, The results from the operation of the first
such loop, reported previously,’ showed that a
short length of type 316 stainless steel in the top
of the hot leg would reduce the attack on the
Inconel but would cause increased mass transfer.

Loop 379, the second in this series, was operated
with a length of nickel in the hot leg. The Inconel
showed heavy subsurface void attack to a depth of
5 mils, and no change in attack in the Inconel was
apparent near the nickel insert. The nickel near
the weld had a few scattered voids to a depth of
1 mil, while the rest of the insert appeared to be
unattacked. [If any even removal had taken place,
it could not be determined. No deposit was found
in the cold leg. If any reduction in attack was

caused by the nickel, it was too slight to be con-

FLUORIDE CORROSION OF STAINLESS STEEL,
IZETT IRON, AND HASTELLOY LOOPS

The results from the first 400 series stainless
steel loop. in which NaF-ZrF ,-UF , (50-46-4 mole %)
was circulated were presented in the previous
report. The loop was constructed from type 430
stainless steel (0.12% carbon, maximum; 14 to 18%
chromium). After the test, the hot-leg surface of the
loop was smooth, and there was no visible attack.
Metallic crystals were found in the cold leg, and
thus there was indication that some even removal
had taken place. Two more 400 series stainless
steel loops have now circulated NaF-ZrF -UF
(50-46-4 mole %) satisfactorily for 500 hours.

Loop 138 was constructed from type 410 stainless
steel (0.15% carbon, maximum; 11.5 to 13.5%
chromium). Unlike the other 400 series stainless
steels studied, type 410 stainless steel is marten-
sitic. After operation for 500 hr at 1500°F, the
hot leg of loop 138 was very rough, with sharp
depressions to a depth of 1.5 mils. There wds no
evidence of intergranular or subsurface-void types
of attack.

however, it seems likely that some thinning of the
wall had taken place. The cold-leg wall was
covered with a metallic layer, and the fluoride
mixture was full of dendritic metallic crystals.

The second loop was constructed from type 446
stainless steel (0.35% carbon, maximum; 23 to 27%
chromium). After operation for 500 hr, the hot leg
of this loop was rough and uneven, but, in addition,
a heavy concentration of subsurface voids to a
maximum depth of 10 mils was found. The cold
leg had a very heavy deposit of metal, and there
were dendritic crystals in the fluoride mixture.
With both this loop and loop 138, the cold-leg
crystols were shown to contain primarily iron, but
chromium was also present. It is obvious that a
change in the chromium content of the alloys
causes o change in the corrosion mechanism. With
type 430 stainless steel, even removal occurs,
while with type 446 stainless steel, both even
removal and a subsurface-void type of attack,
similar to that found in type 316 stainless steel,
are found.

A single loop of Izett iron was filled with NaF-
ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) and circulated at
1500°F, This loop was terminated after 39 hr of
operation because of plug formation. In this short
period of operation, the lower sections of the loop
had collected many balls of needle-like dendritic
iron crystals, These crystals are similar in
appearance tothe nickel crystals found in hydroxide
systems. Also, a thick deposit was found on the
cold-leg wall. The hot-leg surface of this loop was
very rough, with areas in which entire grains had
been removed.

One loop was constructed from Vein. Hastelloy C
tubing (58% Ni-17% Mo-15% Cr-5% W--5% Fe).
This loop was terminated because of a leak in
the weld at the top of the hot leg after having
circulated NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) for 456
hr at 1500°F. The hot leg of this loop showed light,
subsurface-void formation to a depth of 1.5 mils.
The attack was primarily in the second phase
found in these alloys. No attack or deposit was
found in the cold leg.

Attempts were made to circulate NaF-ZrF ,-UF
(50-46-4 mole %) in several loops constructed from
Hastelloy B (62% Ni-30% Mo~5% Fe). The tubes

This oxidation occurred under the
Saurizen cement used to protect the thermocouples.
The Hastelloys are hot short in the temperature
range 1100 to 1600°F, and thus they are difficult
to handle. For the loops now being fabricated, the
tubing will be given a high-temperature anneal to
minimize these difficulties.

One Hastelloy B loop constructed of 1-in. tubing
was examined after it had operated at 1500°F for
91 hr before failing because of catastrophic oxi-
dation, The hot- and cold-leg surfaces of this loop
were rough. Fabrication cracks were visible in the

Forced-Circulstion Corrosion Loop

G. M. Adamson
Metallurgy Division

An Inconel forced-circulation loop operated at a
maximum temperature of 1500°F for 200 hr at a
maximum fluid velocity of about 2.5 fps was de-
scribed previously. After termination, this loop
was subjected to metallurgical examination. The
normal, subsurface-void type of aitack was found
in the hot leg. The attack gradually increased in
depth to a maximum of 11 mils in the hottest
portion and was both more intense and more con-
cenifrated in the grain boundaries than that found in
the thermal convection loops operated under similar
conditions. The depth of attack was only slightly
deeper, but, since turbulent flow was not obtained,
no large increase would be expected. Considerable
carburization of the Inconel was found in the hot
leg. The carbides must have originated from oil
used to lubricate the gas seal. In the hottest
portion, a general layer of carbide precipitate was
found to a depth of 14 mils, and there was an
intergranular layer through the sample.

No deposits were found in any of the cold-leg
sections examined. Some attack and carburization
was found in the first or hottest cold-leg section
but not in the other sections. Diffraction and

and after circulation, failed to reveal any changes
that might have caused plugging. It seems likely
that the plugging of this loop was caused by

not by corrosion,

Oscillating-Furnoce Studies

F. Kertesz
H. J. Buttram J. M, Didlake
R. E. Meadows N. V. Smith

Materials Chemistry Division

Corrosion by turbulently flowing fluorides is
being investigated with an oscillating-furnace
apparatus. Turbulent flow is simulated by suddenly
stopping a rotating V-shaped capsule which has
been heated to 800°C by a gas furnace. One of the
legs of the rotating capsule is shorter than the
other, and, at the instant the liquid is at the apex
(bottom) of the V with its level being below the top
of the short leg, the capsule is abruptly stopped;
this causes the liquid to rush info the empty part
of the leg. When the capsule is stopped, the gas is
turned off and the capsule cools. After cooling to
600°C, the capsule is rotated back to its original
position, with the apex pointing downward, while
the heating cycle is resumed. The complete cycle
takes «about 90 seconds.

The absence of steady-flow conditions makes it
difficult to estimate the actual Reynolds number of
the system at the time of stoppage, but in view of
the rapid deceleration, it is expected that turbulent
conditions should prevail for a short period in the
capsule.

In order to evaluate the relative importance of
flow conditions and of temperature, static tests
were run at the same time at 600 and at 800°C,
since the welding required in the fabrication of the
V-shaped capsules could have changed the properties
of the tube walls and thus changed their resistance
to corrosion. In another series of check tests,
stationary capsules were thermally cycled by
alternately heating and cooling from 650 to 800°C.
The effect of motion without a temperature gradient
was studied by slowly rotating nearly horizontally
placed capsules inside an isothermal furnace with
the ends kept at 650 and 800°C. Tilting-furnace
tests were also run in which the hot- and cold-end
capsule wall temperatures were kept at 650 and
800°C, respectively. In addition to the usual 4-cpm

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1954

tilting-furnace tests, a series of 2-cpm tests was
made; the duration of all these tests was 100 hours,
The chromium concentrations of the melts after the
tests are summarized in Table 6.6.

The results given in Table 6.6 indicate that,
within the range of the experimental conditions
used, the effect of temperature on the amount of
chromium dissolved by the fluoride melt is very
noticeable. On the other hand, the effect of flow
(ranging from static flow to the viscous flow
obtained in the horizontally rotated capsules, to
the tilting-furnace test, and finally to the pre-

sumably turbulent conditions in the oscillating
furnace) is rather small in comparison with the
increase in attack which can be attributed to the

temperature effect.

The study of corrosion and mass transfer in
liquid lead has been extended to include tests with
cobalt, beryllium, titanium, and Hastelloy B. As
in previous experiments, these metals were in-
serted in small, quartz, thermal convection loops®
and tested in circulating liquid lead. The results
already obtained for the 25% Mo—75% Ni alloy were

rechecked, and the influence of oxides in retarding
mass transfer in loops with inserts of type 347
stainless steel systems was further investigated.

The loop with beryllium inserts was operated for
456 hr before circulation stopped becouse of plug
formation, ' The hot- and cold-leg temperatures were
815 and 600°C, respectively, As shown in Fig.
6.8, the corrosion of the beryllium specimen was
relatively uniform, with very little intergranular
attack. The results for the beryllium loop must
still be regarded as tentative, however, since the
quartz tubing of the loop appeared to have suffered
attack. It is possible that part of the mass transfer
observed may be attributed to interaction between
the beryllium and the quartz. This problem is being
investigated further,

Plugging occurred in the loop with titanium
inserts after only 5 hr of operation. Hot- and cold-
leg temperatures were 815 and 575°C, respectively.

large quantity of mass-transferred materiol was de-
posited on the hot-leg specimen. Figure 6.9 shows
some of the dendritic crystals found on the walls
of the hot leg. A transverse section of the hot leg
is shown in Fig. 6.10. There is a heavy layer of
deposited material at the inside surface of the
specimen. Some deposition was also noted on the
cold leg but not to the extent found on the hot leg,

Two loops with cobalt inserts have been tested.
The first loop plugged after 61 hr of operation with
hot- and cold-leg temperatures of 820 and 550°C.
Figure 6.11 shows a transverse section of the hot-
leg specimen from this loop. A heater failure
coused the termination of the second loop after 97
hr of operation with hot- and cold-leg temperatures
of 815 and 500°C. The gradual decrease in the
cold-leg temperature of this loop indicated that
plugging would probably have occurred in another
tew hours of operation. Examination of the test
specimen from the second cobalt loop has not been
completed.

suffered very severe corrosive attack. Lead
penetrated almost all the way through the specimen.
The cold-leg specimen, on the other hand, was
virtually unottacked, with only ao thin layer of

The results obtained from a second loop with 25%
Mo-75% Ni alloy inserts confirmed the results
obtained in the first test.” The loop was terminated
on schedule after 331 hr of operation with hot- and

intergranular penetration occurred in the hot-leg
specimen but little corrosive attack was observed
in the cold leg.

Figure 6.13 shows a transverse section from the
hot leg of a loop with type 304 stainless steel
inserts in which the test specimens were oxidized
prior to loading.” The loop was operated for 550
hr without the formation of a plug large enough to
stop circulation. In contrast, loops containing
type 304 stainless steel specimens in the as-
received condition had to be terminated within
100 hr because of plug formation.

In order to test further the effect of the presence
of oxides on mass transfer, a loop with type 347
stainless steel inserts was operated in which the
lead was not deoxidized prior to loading. The loop
operated for 240 hr before failing because of plug
formation; the hot- and cold-leg temperatures were
815 and 500°C. In previous loops with type 347
stainless steel inserts for which the standard
deoxidized procedure was followed, plugging
occurred in approximately 150 hours. As indicated
in Fig. 6.14, the hot-leg specimen showed inter-
granular penetration similar to that obtained in
other tests with type 347 stainless steel inserts.

The studies of the effect of environment on the
creep and stress-rupture properties of Incone! have
continued, and rupture curves are presented for
annealed at 1650°F and at 2050°F and
tested in argon and in the fluoride mixture NaF-
ZeF UF, at 1300, 1500, and 1650°F. A bor graph
is presented to show the time required to reach
several different extensions and the amount of de-
formation at rupture for Inconel tested in the various
environments after being subjected fo annealing
procedures. The major effect on creep properties
of a small change in composition of Inconel is also
shown. Tests of the effect on columbium of the
purity of argon and helium atmospheres were made
preparatory to conducting creep tests of columbium,

Inconel

Methods were developed for preparing a nickel-
phosphorus brazing alloy powder that can be applied
in the conventional manner. An alloy with satis-
factory flowability was prepared, and the optimum
conditions for producing it were established. Alloys
in the nickel-germanium system are being investi-
gated to determine their suitability for use with
liquid metals and fused salts. The 75% Ni~25% Ge
alloy used as a master alloy has a melting point of
1151°C and has exhibited favorable flowability at
1180°C.,

Investigations made in the study of high-conduc-
tivity metals for radiator fins have shown claddings
of types 310 ond 446 stainless steel on copper fo
be satisfactory with respect to diffusion. However,
it may be necessary to use Inconel as the cladding
material, ond various materials have been tested
as diffusion barriers between Inconel and copper.
None of the refractory-type barrier materials tested,
namely, tungsten, molybdenum, zirconium, titanium,
and vanadium, were satisfactory. Other tests
showed diffusion barriers of iron and types 310 and
446 stainless steel to be successful in preventing
copper diffusion for up to 500 hr at 1500°F, Com-
mercially produced types 310 and 430 stainless
steel-clad copper did not show diffusion of copper
in 500 hr ot 1500°F.

Radiator fins of various materials were brazed to
Inconel tubing for heat transfer tests. The fin
materials being studied are type 304 stainless

flow and wet both Inconel and type 316 stainless
steel in an atmosphere of welding-grade tank
helium. The substitution of helium for dry hydrogen
will be quite useful for brazing operations in which
ceramic or nonmetallic jig materials must be used.

Examinations of tubular fuel elements plug-drawn
of ORNL indicated that the core structures of the
elements were greatly improved by decreasing the
reduction per pass. The use of nickel as a core
material for these elements has been found to be
unsatisfactory because of diffusion of the nickel
into the stainless stee! cladding.

Various composites of beryllium oxide with miner
additions of other materials have been tested and
found to be unsatisfactory as containers for fluo-
ride fuels, Special bearing shapes fabricated of
beryllium oxide and of high-density graphite were
prepared for testing. Six boron carbide—iron cermets
were preparad for use as shielding in connection
with in-pile loop studies of ANP fuels.

tested at the some temperature (1500°F) and com-
pares roughly with the curves for the specimens
tested at 1650°F. It is thought that the tube-burst
type of test in which a multiaxial system can be
studied is a more realistic test for obtaining in-
formation pertinent to the present reactor designs.
The rather large differences in rupture properties
shown in the data indicate the need for expansion
of the tube-burst testing program so that the multi-
axial stress system can be more thoroughly studied.

In previous reports, the sensitivity of Inconel to
both its test environment and its annealing tem.
perature was shown by comparing the times-to-
rupture for the various test conditions, However,
it should be emphasized that the selection of the
best annealing temperature or environment by using
rupture time as the criterion would not necessarily
provide the best conditions if some other reference
point, such as 1% total strain, were the limiting
factor, Figure 7.2 shows the time required to reach
several selected extensions and rupture. The bars

are arranged from left to right in order of increasing
time required to reach 1% elongation. It can be
seen that many of the bars are out of order if
extension is neglected and rupture time is used
for a comparative basis. The total elongation at
rupture is about the same regardless of the anneal-
ing temperature or the environment, except in air
and in sodium. In sodium; it has been found that
the specimen is markedly decarburized during
testing, and decarburi zation would account for the
increased ductility. No explanation has yet been
found for the greater elongations reached in air.
Examination of Fig. 7.2 shows that the most
obvious cases of misfit, with reference to rupture
times, are the coarse-grained specimens which
were tested in the molten fluoride ond in argon,
The explanation for this discrepancy con be found
in a comparison of the creep curves for the coarse-
ond fine-grained specimens at 3500 psi. Two such
curves for tests conducted in argon are shown in
Fig. 7.3. Similar curves for tests in fluoride

mixtures would show the same pattern but different
magnitudes. These curves show that for the first
200 hr the fine-grained specimen has a much slower
creep rate than the coarse-grained specimen, but a
transition occurs and a new and faster creep rate
is established and maintained until fracture. 1 can
be seen that up to 700 hr and about 4.5% elongo-
tion the fine-grained material will show better
creep properties than the coarse-grained material,
but after 700 hr, the coarse-grained specimen will
be superior,

Ancther variable which must be considered when
studying the stress-rupture properties of Inconel is
the amount of trace elements, such as aluminum,
titanium, and boron, introduced into the heat during
deoxidation, The effect of these elements is quite
significant, even when they are present in very

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1954

small amounts. Figure 7.4 shows rupture curves
for two different heats of Inconel tested at 1500°F
in argon. Heat B, which had an appreciably higher
content of trace elements, had a rupture life two to
three times longer than that of heat A. An analysis
of the effect of annealing temperature on the stress-
rupture properties of the two heats showed that
annealing at 2050°F produced a coarse-grained
specimen but did not improve the properties of
heat A. However, the same treatment of heot B
produced a marked improvement in the rupture
properties at stresses below 4500 psi. The im-
provement can also be attributed to the increased
content of trace elements, since the creep curves
show that an apparent precipitation-hardening ef-
fect took place during testing.

CREEP TESTS OF COLUMBIUM

The possibility of conducting creep tests of
columbium in inert-gas atmospheres is being in-
vestigated. It has been shown that atmospheres
comparable to vacua of the order of 103 mm of Hg
can be obtained by using a pump for recirculating
purified gases through the purification train. Use
of this method results in a considerable saving in
gas consumption, and, with time, the gas becomes
purer. The results of tests of columbium in helium
and in argon are promising, as shown in Table 7.1,

A duplicate set of Inconel-clad copper specimens
will be made from sheet oxidized for 500 hr to
determine the effect of diffusion on the heat trans-
fer efficiency. Sufficient fin material of Inconel-
clad copper and types 310 and 430 stainless steel-
clad copper is on hand for the fabrication of con-
ventional sodium-to-air radiators for core element
tests. The results of the experiments described
above will be used to determine the materials to be
used for the radiators.

Fluoride~to-Air Radiator

A fluoride-to-air radiator was fabricated of Inconel
for radiation damage experiments involving in-pile

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1954

operation, Although the fins will not be in contact
with the fluoride fuel, it was considered desirable
to use a brazing alloy that would have at least
moderate resistance to the fuel, since excessive
dilution or diffusion through the tube wall might be
encountered, The 82% Au-18% Ni alloy was used
because it exhibits good resistance to oxidation
and moderate resistance to corrosion by the fuel.
This alloy also possesses a flow point at which
grain growth is not considered to be detrimental.

An as-brazed unit of the spiral-fin design de-
veloped for these experiments is shown in Fig,
7.6. The brazing material was applied as long
narrow strips which had been previously sheared
from a rolled sheet, These strips were spiralled
along the tube length and therefore closely fol-
lowed the fin contour. It was possible by this
method to readily obtain complete bonding along
the tube-~to-fin interface,

have indicated that a chemical
probably occurs between a hydrogen
brazing atmosphere and some ceramic or non-
metallic jig materials. The use of these jig ma-
terials may therefore require the use of some
neutral otmosphere, such as helium, Since only
limited data were available on the flowability of
high-temperature brazing alloys in inert atmos-
pheres, an investigation was initiated to obtain
applicable information,

Preliminary results indicate that conventional
alloys such as Nicrobraz and the G-E nickel-
chromium-silicon alloy flow readily on both Incone!
and type 316 stainless steel base metals in
welding-grade tank helium. Other braze materials,
such as nickel-phosphorus and the precious-metal
alloys, also appeared to exhibit satisfactory wetting
choracteristics in a helium atmosphere. Since the
results obtained with these preliminary experi-
ments were promising, additional tests are being
conducted to more closely determine the effects
of a helium atmosphere on the base metal and the
brazing alloy composition.

Nickel-Phosphorus Brazing Alloy

G. M. Slaughter  K. W. Reber
Metallurgy Division

ANP Division

Successful use of the "electroless’ method of
preplating nickel-phosphorus brazing alloy, as
described and illustrated previously,'*? has con-
tinued, The method is time-consuming, however,
and it would therefore be desirable to find a method
for producing nicke!l-phosphorus powder that could
be applied in the conventional manner.

Nickel-phosphorus alloys made by conventional
melting methods proved to be unreliable with re-
spect to phosphorus retention and homogeneity.
The alloys became contaminated in subsequent
crushing and grinding operations on the as-cast
ingots, However, a nickel-phosphorus alloy can be
prepared in flake form by cataclysmic precipitation
from a conventional '‘electroless’’ bath.
found that an excess of the sodium hypophosphate
additive would cause flakes of nickel-phosphorus
alloy to precipitate on the bottom of the plating
bath, The flakes could then be separated and
ground into a fine powder. Chemical analyses
performed on samples of alloy made in an “‘electro-
less’ bath showed the phosphorus content to be
11 to 12.5%, that is, slightly higher than the
phosphorus content in the binary eutectic,

tories, Inc. have developed a process for obtaining

water is prepared and then fired in a hydrogen
atmosphere at approximately 1700°F, Since this
method appeared to offer a promising means for
obtaining nickel-phosphorus brazing alloy, a series
of experiments was performed to evaluate the
technique, However, metallic nickel powder was
used in this laboratory, since the oxide would be
reduced to nickel in the dry hydrogen atmosphere,

Calculations based on 100% phosphorus retention
indicated that a phosphate-to-nicke! ratio of 2:1
should produce approximately the 90% Ni-10% P
eutectic composition. An alloy prepared in the
manner described was found to be quite satis-
factory in flowability tests at 950°C. In order to
determine the actual phosphorus retention in this
operation, small ingots were prepared with theo-
retical phosphorus contents of 6, 8, 10, and 12%.
Chemical analyses performed on these samples
indicated actual percentages of 6.4, 8, 10, and
13.4%, respectively. Experiments performed to
determine optimum conditions for producing nickel-
phosphorus alloy by this method resulted in the
following observations:

1. The particle size of the nickel powder was
found to be extremely important from the stand-
point of phosphorus retention. Fine powders were
found to be very desirable; subsieve powder alloyed
with phosphorus yielded much better results than
~ 200 mesh powder.

2. The role of temperature wos made less
critical as the particle size was decreased. How-
ever, higher firing temperatures than the calculated
equilibrium temperature were found to be desirable,
probably because of the increase in the rate of
alloying as compared with the rate of phosphorus
loss by vaporization at the higher temperatures,

3. The use of nickelic oxide was also satis-
factory in the production of homogeneous melts.

4. Preliminary experiments indicated that alloy
additions such as chromium and iron could be made
by including these clements as metal powders in
calculated quantities in the initia! mixture,

Nickel-Germanium Brozing Alloy

The nickel-germanium alloy system has been
investigated at other installations, but its suit-
ability for liquid-metal or molten fluoride systems
has not been established, Therefore nickel-
germanium and nickel-germanium-chromium alloys
were mode and cre being evaluated with respect
to oxidation resistance and static corrosion re-
sistance.

The 75% Ni-25% Ge alloy used as a master alloy
has a melting point of 1151°C and has exhibited
favorable flowability at 1180°C. The resulis of
corrosion tests conducted in liquid sodium and in
fluoride salt mixtures are considered to be prom.
ising (cf., sec. 6, “Corrosion Research"), Metal-
lographic examination of an Inconel T-joint brazed
with this alley ond exposed to air for 100 hr ot
1500°F showed negligible attack, These results,
along with evidence that the alloy can be hot
worked, indicate that the nickel-germanium system
merits serious consideration for ANP applications.

Alloy additions of chromium and phospherus have
resulted in a substantial decrease of the melting
point, A 10% chromium addition lowered the flow
point to approximately 1100°C. It is expected that
oxidation resistance and corrosion resistance in
sodium will be increased by the chromium addi-
tion. However, it is apparent that the chromium
addition makes the alloy more brittle.

HIGH-CONDUCTIVITY METALS FOR
RADIATOR FINS

E. 5. Bomar J. H, Coobs
H. Inouye
Metallurgy Division

The investigations made in the study of high-
conductivity metals for radiator fins included a
study of diffusion barriers between Inconel and
copper, auxiliary diffusion experiments to support
metallographic observations of the various clod-
copper composites, and the evaluation of com-
posites supplied by commercial fabricators.

Diffusion Barriers

The gross diffusion between Inconel and copper
when heated to 1500°F was described previously.
Although claddings of types 310 and 446 stainless
steel on copper were shown to be satisfactory
with respect to diffusion, it seemed advisable to
be able to use Inconel as a clad in the event that
the brazing of large heat exchangers proved to be
difficult with the stainless steel claddings.

Several barrier-containing composites were rolled
to a final thickness of 0.008 in., of which 0.004 in.
was copper with 0.002 in. Inconel cladding on each

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1954

side, The thickness of the refractory-type barrier
layer was calculated to be 0.0002 inch. The barrier
materials tested included tungsten, tantalum,
molybdenum, zirconium, titanium, and vanadium.
Bonding was not achieved between molybdenum and
Inconel or between vanadium end Inconel. The
other barrier metals tested were unsuccessful be-
cause discontinuous layers were formed during
rolling, either because of fracturing of the barrier
metal or because of the differences in strength ot
the rolling temperature between the barrier metal
and the Inconel, When differences in strength
existed, the barrier material was found embedded
within the copper.

Diffusion barriers of iron and of types 310 and
446 stoinless steel were successful in preventing
copper diffusion for up to 500 hr at 1500°F, Barrier
thicknesses of 0.0005 and 0.001 in. were tested.
Uniform, continuous, crack-free layers were ob-
tained,

Composites of Inconel-Ag-Fe-Cu-Fe-Ag-inconel
could not be fabricated because of the difficulty
of keeping the silver and the copper separated by
the iron,

The effect of surface preparation on the diffusion
of copper and Inconel was briefly investigated.
For this study, oxide layers were formed on Inconel
by heat treating it in air and in wet hydrogen at
1350°F for various times of up to 1 hours. Com-
posites fabricated with such oxides did not prevent
the formation of the diffusion voids previously
described.

Diffusion Couples

Diffusion couples between copper and types 310
and 446 stainless steel, Inconel, and an 8% alumi-
num bronze were made. The couples were heated
for 500 hr at 1500°F and 0.001-in. layers were
analyzed. The results, shown in Table 7.2, con.
firm the metallographic observation that in couples
of copper and Inconel or copper and aluminum
bronze there is considerable diffusion of the copper
into the cladding. It is believed, however, that
the experiments lacked precision, and hence calcu-
lations of diffusion constants would be misleading.

Commercially Clad Copper

The General Plate Division of the Metals ond
Controls Company has fabricated 0.008-in,-thick
clad copper up to 5 in. wide and, in single pieces,
up to 50 ft long, Samples of types 310 and 430

No pinholes were found in the 0.002-in,-thick type

Inconel-clad copper showed numerous pinholes, as
did some of the Inconel-clad samples received

FABRICATION OF SPECIAL MATERIALS

Clad Columbium Disks
H. Inouye, Metallurgy Division

Thin disks of columbium, 0.020-in.-thick, were
sandwiched between alloys
and hot rolled in evacuated capsules at various
temperatures to determine bonding and rolling
characteristics. Since it is known that the ‘‘get-
tering properties” of columbium increase with
temperature and its embrittlement in air occurs at
around 1500°F, it was desired to determine the
lowest temperature at which bonding would occur.
The results of the first tests are presented in
Table 7.3.

The samples, which were clad on all sides, were
tested in air at 1500°F and at 1832°F for 500
hours, The results were not promising, since the
bond was broken in most cases, probably because
of cracking of the intermetallic or the oxide layers.

The thermal expansion coefficients of columbium
(3.95 x 10™% in./in.' °F) and the cladding material
(other than Cb) vary by a factor of about 2, The

tests at 1500°F show that intermetallic compound
formation between columbium and the cladding is
not serious. Some embrittlement was noted in the
Hastelloy B clad. The tests at 1832°F were con~
sidered to be failures becouse the columbium core
was embrittled or oxidized completely as a result
of failure of the cladding or of diffusion, No con-
clusions can be drawn since only one set of tests
was made.

Clad Molybdenum and Columbium Tubing

H. Inouye
Metallurgy Division

Shipments of clad molybdenum and columbium
tubing have been received from the Superior Tube
Company. The molybdenum tubing received in the
first shipment was clad with 0.020 in. of type 321
stainless steel, and, in an attempt to obtain a good
mechanical fit by drawing the molybdenum and
cladding, numerous transverse cracks developed
in the molybdenum, Of six composite tubes, only
three were acceptable. The clad tubes received
in the second shipment were scored, but no cracks
were found, Ninety-four feet of columbium clad
with type 310 stainless steel has also been re-
ceived; this material is sound, These composite
tubes are to be made into thermal convection loops
for corrosion studies.

A metallurgical bond between columbium and
type 310 stainless steel could not be obtained by
simultaneously cold drawing the tubes to o 75%
reduction in area and annealing at 1100°C in a
vacuum,

Drawn Tubular Fuel Elements

Metallographic examination of the nine tubular
fuel elements plug-drawn at ORNL was completed.®
In general, the core structure of these elements is
greatly improved compared with those processed
at the Superior Tube Company by drawing on a
mandrel. The metallic matrices of the cores seemed
to be sound, and the core-to-cladding bonds were
intact. Stringers of UO, were formed because of
breaking up of the relatively coarse UO, (-270
+325 mesh), The stringers became more pre-
dominant and larger as reductions were increased

to about 80%. Figure 7.7 shows a longitudinal
section of tube with 30 vol % UO, in a nickel core
after 77% cold reduction, during which the UO,
was broken up into stringers and lost during
polishing, This structure is typical of others
which had comparable reductions.

Figure 7.7 also shows the definite zone (0.002
to 0.003 in.) of diffusion of nickel into the stain-
less steel cladding as a result of repeated aneal-
ing. Therefore, nickel is being de-emphasized as
a core matrix in fuel elements,

Several more tubes of various compositions are
to be drawn by the Superior Tube Company. These
tubes will also be plug-drawn from % in. in diameter
to % in. in diameter by using reductions of 10
and 15% per pass, followed by mandrel drawing of
a segment of each tube to % in. in diameter. The
tubes will be prepared with cores of iron, pre-
alloyed stainless steel, elemental '‘stainless
steel,”’ and nicke! powders with 30 vol % of -325
mesh high-fired UO.

Two or three tubes of each composition will be
prepared for use with the different reduction
schedules. These tubes will have one core 2 in.
wide, as hot rolled, and will be roll-formed and
welded with one seam. Starting wall thickness
will be 0.025 in. to minimize the amount of tube
reduction necessary. Several dummy tubes with
0.025-in. walls have been fabricated to establish
optimum welding conditions.

A crucible of beryllium oxide supplied by Clifton

8. HEAT TRANSFER AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

H. F. Poppendiek

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The physical properties of several fluoride
mixtures and other materials of interest to aircraft
reactor technology were determined. The heat

capacity of NaF-ZrF, {50-50 mole %) was found to
be 0.19 cal/g-°C in the solid state and 0.33
cal/g.°C in the liquid state. The thermal con-
ductivity of solid NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42-46.5
mole %) was determined to be about 2.8 Btu/hr.ft.°F,
which is similar to the liquid conductivity value
previously determined. Preliminary thermal-
conductivity measurements for a liquid heat-transfer
salt (NaNO,-NaNO,-KNO,, eutectic) yielded a
value of 0.6 Btu/hr.ft.°F, The density of NaF-
ZrF,-UF, (62.5-12.5-25 mole %),
used in an in-pile loop system, was found to be
plg/cm3) = 4.836 — 0.001117 over the temperature
range 650 to 900°C; the viscosity varied from
about 17.1 centipoises at 670°C to 8.3 centipoises
at 900°C. The density of NaF-LiF (40-60 mole %)
was determined to be p(g/cm®) = 2.429 — 0.000477
over the temperature range 700 to 900°C; the
viscosity varied from about 5 centipoises at 700°C
to 2.5 centipoises at 900°C.

A heat-transfer system which can be used to
study the rates of deposition of insoluble chemical
deposits in certain fluoride systems has been

The feasibility of the technique of measuring
fluid velocity profiles in duct systems by photo-
graphing tiny particles suspended in the flowing
medium has been checked. This method is to be
used to determine the hydrodynamic structure ‘in
the flow annulus of the reflector-moderated reactor.

Further forced-convection, laminar-flow, heat-
transfer experiments have been conducted in pipe
systems which contain circulating liquids with
volume heat sources; these sources are generated
electrically. The laminar-flow data fall about 30%
below the values predicted by previously developed

The enthalpy and heat capacity of the fluoride

in the liquid and solid state.! The data can be

represented by the following equations: In the
solid state (216 to 450°C),

where H is enthalpy in cal/g, T is temperature in
°C, and ¢, is heat capacity in cal/g-°C, The heat
of fusion at the melting point at 510°C is about
59 cal/g. The individual results for this salt are
shown in Fig. 8.1,

Preliminary values for the heat capacity of two
other salts in the liquid state follow: NaF-ZrF ,-
UF, (65-15-20 mole %), ¢;, = 0.22; NaF-ZrF , UF,
(53-43-4 mole %), cp = = 0.27.

Silver liners have been placed in the central
region of several of the heat-capacity furnaces
where the capsules are suspended. Checks with
pure aluminum oxide show that more accurate
enthalpy data are obtained when the temperatures of
the liners rather than the temperatures of the cap-~
sule tops are used. Silver liners are being installed
in the remaining furnaces.

42-46.5 mole %) in the solid state yielded a
conductivity value of about 2.8 Btu/hr-f1.°F, which
is similar tothe liquid conductivity value previously
determined for that material.

A steady-state radial method has been developed
for determining the thermal conductivities of
liquids. The apparatus consists of a mine,
thin-walled, stainless steel tube that con be heated
directly by an electric current. This tube is
centrally placed in a Yy-in. hole drilled in a 2-in.
metal rod. Crodients of over 20°F have been
obtained in water without appreciable convection.
The individual results obtained for water were

between 0.33 and 0.37 Btu/hr-f+.°F. These values

96

are comparable to the literature value of 0.35,
Modifications of this apparatus will have to be
made before the thermal conductivity of fused
fluorides and hydroxides can be determined because
of their appreciable electrical conductivity.
Additional data on the thermal conductivity of
solid heat-transfer salts (NaNO,-NaNO,-KNO,,
eutectic) have been obtained. A slab of this heat-
transfer salt, approximately 4 in. square and % in.
thick, was cast with thermocouples located on the
slab surfaces. The sample was inserted in the
parallel-plate conductivity which is
presently used for determining the thermal con-
ductivities of liquids. Data obtained over the

Electrical Conductivity of Molten Salts
N. D. Green

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

Development of the beryllia-tube modification of
the dip cell for obtaining the electrical conduc-
tivities of molten salts at high temperatures has
now been halted. Since it has been impossible to
produce a beryllia tube of the required density,
one of the most accurate methods for determining
the conductivities of the non-lithium-containing
salts cannot be used.

The platinum conductivity cell, which is known
to be compatible with all molten salts, including
the lithium-containing compounds, has been tested
at its maximum required operating temperature
(1800°F) and found to be dimensionally stable.
The determination of the constant of this cell is
now being carried out with several substances for
which conductivities at various temperatures are
accurately known. [It now appears that the problem
of contamination of the melt by the constituent
elements of the crucible going into solution has
been largely eliminated. Several test melts have
evidenced no observable contamination.

A modification of the platinum cell is now being
developed so that its constant may be calculated
readily from the known geometry. However, the
utilization, here, of a beryllia insert limits the
applicability of the cell to compositions which do
not contain lithium.

The feasibility of a small-scale system to be
used in studying the rates of deposition of the
films or deposits found at interfaces between
Inconel and NaF-KF-LiF has been demonstrated,
and the system hos been constructed. The system
consists of two small Incone! tanks connected by a

removable test section made of Y,-in. tubing. The
fluid in the tanks is cycled through the test section
by inert gas pressure; the cycling mechanism is
probe actuated. The test section, which can he
constructed of any desired mdterial, is surrounded
by a %-in.-thick copper jacket to provide an
isothermal region. The section is heated by a
clam-shell heater. The system has been designed
to operate at Reynolds moduli of up to 10,000,
Specified temperature conditions can be maintained
by adjustment of the tank and test-section heaters.

It is possible that this system could also be
used as a dynamic corrosion-testing system in that
it needs no mechanical pump and yet can provide
fluoride flow rates equivalent to Reynolds moduli
of up to 10,000,

ments with, perhaps, rubidium-bearing salts,

Fluid velocity measurements have been made in
a simple flow system to test the feasibility of a
photographic technique. Velocity data
obtained by suspending dust particles
flowing fluid, illuminating a region with a thin
beam of light flashed at measured time intervals,
and photographing the particles by the light they
scattered. , images of each particle
appeared as points on a single negative. A grid
system was also photographed, and a composite

composite print and the time-interval information,
velocities could be computed directly.

A report has been prepared in which the method
is described in detail and the initial velocity data
are presented.’ The principal difficulty in this

limitation on the technique, although not a major
one.

A phosphorescent rod of fluid is distorted by the

the degree of distortion. A circulation system

9. RADIATION DAMAGE

J. B. Trice, Solid State Division
A. J. Miller, ANP Division

Tests of fused-salt fuels in Inconel! capsules are
being conducted to determine the chemical stability
of the fuel and the corrosion resistance of the
Inconel! under high temperatures in reactor radiation
fields. In the past, fused-salt fuels in the Naf-
ZrF -UF, system were shown by several methods
to be chemically stable when they were irradiated
for 600-hr periods at fuel power densities of up to
8000 watts/em>, Concurrent tests also have
shown that container corrosion increases from 1to
2 mils of subsurface-void attack for out-of-pile
tests to 5 to 6 mils of intergranular attack for
in-pile high-temperature tests. Data obtained from
recently completed petrographic examinations sup-
port the previous indications that the fuels ars
chemically stable under reactor radiation. The
occasional appearance of unusually large grains
in irradiated capsules has stimulated an intensive
study of the errors involved in temperature measure-
ments of the capsules.

Miniature loops are being designed for circulating
fuel in such space-restricted locations as the
vertical holes in the [LITR, The designs are
based on the results of intensive studies of such
variables as fuel flow rates, power densities, and
rates of heat removal. Some components have
already been constructed and tested,

An in-pile stress corrosion apparatus has been
developed for obtaining information on the func.
tion of stress in corrosion. With this apparatus,
it will be possible to determine, simultansously,
the corrosion effects on stressed and unstressed
portions of a tube,

Tests in the LITR and in the Graphite Reactor
have shown that the creep behavior of Inconel is
not seriously offected by neutron bombardment.
Apparatus for similar tests in the higher flux of
the MTR is nearly complete.

An in-pile loop for circulating fue! in a hori-
zontal beam hole of the LITR is 80% complete,
and two other loops are being constructed, These
loops will be operated to obtain information on the
chemical stability of the fuel and the corrosion

Petrogrophic Examination of Fuels

Examinations of irradiated fuels by means of an
armored petrographic microscope! were made fo
determine the possible presence of products from
fuel decomposition, Eleven samples irradiated for
periods as long as 492 hr in the MTR and nine
bench-tested control samples were examined, For
these tests, three salt compositions were chosen
that would yield power densities of 2500, 4500,
and 8000 watts/cm?,

Four irradiated capsules showed the presence
of considerable amounts of ZrO, and/or UO,.
Oxides were not found in any control samples, in
any original salts, or in any other irradiated cap-
sules. Attempts to produce oxides at room tempera-
ture by the action of H,0, or of gamma radiation
in the presence of moisture were unsuccessful,
It must therefore be concluded that these four cap-
sules leaked.

It was found from petrographic studies of the
fuel from both the irradiated specimens and the
controls that only a very small degree of chemical
reduction from U4" to U3* occurred. No evidence
of a separate UF, phase was found. The results
of the experiments therefore indicate that the
presence of reactor radiation, under the conditions
chosen for the experiments, has no detrimental
effect on the chemical stability of the fuels studied.

Temperature Control in Static Capsule Tests

The presence of large Inconel grain sizes to-
gether with atypical intergranular cracking in a
few Incone! capsules irradiated in the MTR sug-
gested the need for careful investigation of un-
certainties in such variables as wal! temperatures
and thermal stresses in the capsules, The temper-
ature uncertainty arises from the difference in the
wall temperature measured by a thermocouple from
that measured without the perturbing effect of the
thermocouple. Also, the thermocouple does not
measure the true wall temperature because the
thermocouple junction is partially out in the air
stream adjacent to the capsule and is therefore
cooled by it. The problem has received con-
siderable attention from both calculational and
experimental analyses.

Miniature Circulating Loops

The design and construction of components for
a small in-pile loop to circulate fused-salt fuels
is under way, An attempt is being made to obtain
an optimum design with respect to requirements for
reflector-moderated aircraft reactors. The results of
rigorous calculations are being used for designing
the loops so that it will be possible to approach
a Reynolds modulus of 2000 (turbulent flow) and a
temperature drop of 100°F,

The cogent features upon which design and calcu.
lations are based are (1) fuel power densities from
approximately 500 to 1000 watts/cm? and (2) physi-
cal dimensions such that any single loop can be
completely canned and then inserted as a unit 18
in. in length by 2 in. in diameter into hole C-48 of
the LITR. The principal variables of the system
are rate of cooling-air flow in the annulus around
the loop, fuel flow rate through the loop, entrance
and exit positions for cooling air, and physical
dimensions, such as the surface-to-volume ratio of
the Inconel tube. Variations of physical properties
of the air and the fuel with temperature have, as
yet, been neglected, as has thermal conduction
along the length of the loop metal. The calcula-
tions indicate that it will be difficult, but not
impossible, to obtain both turbulent flow and a
large temperature difference.

Two types of pumps are being studied for use in
the miniature loops. One is a standard sump pump
with a Graphitar gas seal; the other is a hydraulic
check valve type of pump, as shown in Fig. 9.1.
It consists of a rectifier unit containing four check
valves, as shown, surge tanks above this unit, and
a solenoid-driven piston to supply power. The
piston pressure is transmitted to the pumped fluid
by helium gas. It has been found in miniature-foop
mockup tests: that Inconel ball-type valves have a
tendency to stick. Ball check valves made of
materials such as cermets are being tested in
order to find one which will be suitable.

STRESS-CORROSION APPARATUS

J, C, Zukas
Solid State Division

An in-pile stress-corrosion apparatus designed to
reveal the function of stress in corrosion has been
built and is undergoing heat transfer tests. The
test specimen is tubular and stressed in building.
This arrangement should considerably reduce the
number of tests required to obtain information on
corrosion, because postirrodiation metallographic
examination across a single transverse section
will permit’ simultaneous observation, in the same
test specimen, of the corrosive effects of the
fused-salt (and, incidentally, of the sodium used
as a heat transfer agent) on regions subjected to a
continuous range of stresses from tensile to com-
pressive, as well as on regions of zero stress
along the neutral axis of the tubular beam,

In the present test, the tubular specimen con-
tains the salt, and an annulus of molten sodium
surrounds the specimen to conduct the fission heat
to an outer Inconel container that is water cooled
at its periphery so that it serves as a heat sink.
The column of sodiumis cooled ot its upper. end
to minimize vaporization. Initially, no provision
is being made for strain measurements during the
test, but the design is readily adaptable to such
measurements should they be desired in the future,

The fabrication of the shields to protect operating
personnel from gomma rays and delayed neutrons
from sections of the loop external to the reactor
is almost complete, These shields are designed
in sections to facilitate removal of the pump from
the loop after the fuel has become active. The
pump shield wili provide 6 in. of lead which will
be augmented by stacked lead bricks and 12 in, of
paraffin. The tube shield between the pump and
the reactor face is comparable in thickness to the
pump shield, The completed withdrawal shield,
into which the loop and wafer jacket will be with-
drawn ofter removal of the pump, is a 15-ft hori-
rontal cylinder with an 8Y%-in. central hole and
5-in, lead walls,

The disassembly of the fuel loop after operation
in the reactor will require additional toels and a
special door in the Solid State Division hot cells,
The design of the door is complete, and the neces-
sary tools have been ordered. Design work to
modify the tools for remote operation is 80% com-
plete.

Fabrication of parts for three complete loops is
about 50% complete. The major effort is on the
finishing and testing of paris for a single loop,
which is about 80% complete.

Parts for three sump~type pumps, including one
for test purposes only, have been completed (cf.
sec. 2, “Experimental Reactor Engineering”). The
test pump, which was modified after being tested
with water, is being installed in a fluoride system,
A spiral-fin type of heat exchanger was developed
and found adequate for removal of the fission heat
generated in the fuel at a rate of 10,000 watts,

Approval for insertion of the loop into hole HB.2
of the LITR has been granted by the Reactor

Stable Isotope Research and Production Division

Investigations were continued on methods for
determining the oxidation states of the corrosion
products, iron, chromium, and nickel, in ARE fuels
and fuel solvents and methods for the separation
and determination of UF; and UF, in ARE fuels.
A procedure was devised for the determination
of chromous fluoride and ferrous fluoride in NaZrF ,.
This method is not applicable, however, to samples
of the ARE fuel, The possibility of selectively
oxidizing divalent chromium and trivalent uranium
fluorides was investigated, Hexavalent uranium in
the form of urany! acetate was tested us a possible
oxidant for trivalent uranium to the tetravalent
state, Various media for this reaction were used,
but no satisfactory system was found that would
prevent oxidation of trivalent wuranium by the
hydrogen ion, The oxidation of trivalent uranium
fo the quadrivalent state with iodine in 80%
methanol solution was shown fo be essentially
quantitative. The preferential dissolution of UF,
from UF, in ARE fuels by means of solutions of
ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid
oxalate was shown to be impractical when applied
to actual samples of the fuel, Trivalent uranium
fluoride, when heated with NaZrF, was found to
be readily soluble in solutions of ammonium oxa-
late, It was established that the solubility of UF,
in these solvents involves, first, oxidation to
tetravalent uranium and, then, dissolution, The
conversion of UF, and UF, to the corresponding
chlorides by fusion with NoAICl, was accom-
plished, The urcnium chlorides are readily ex-
tracted by acetylacetone-acetone mixtures, The
structure of the uranium compounds with acetyl.

Samples of the fluoride mixture NaF-Z:F UF,
that were exposed to moisture before being canned
were examined with the polarizing microscope after
having been subjected to gomma radiation in the

effects of irradiation could be observed.

The Analytical Chemistry Laboratory received
917 samples and reported 994 samples involving

In cooperation with the ANP Reactor Chemistry
Group, which is investigating the equilibrium
kinetics of corrosion mechanisms in NaZrF,,
methods have been devised for the determination of
the concentrations of the products and reactants
of the following reaction:

Cro + FeF, &—— CF, + Fel .
800°C

Chromium metal and ferrous fluoride are mixed
with NaZrF¢ in a nickel container, heated to
800°C, and filtered through a nickel frit. Samples
are taken of the solidified filtrate and the residue,
It is assumed that filtration will remove the metal-
lic constituents and that the filtrate will contain
oxidized chromium and unreacted ferrous fluoride,
The residue was observed to contain magnetic
particles, that is, metallic iron, and thus the
reduction of ferrous fluoride was demonstrated,
Since the residue was heterogeneous, only the con-
centrations of total iron and chromium were deter-
mined in the residue.

The filtrate was free from magnetic particles.
For the calculation of equilibrium, divalent: iron
and divalent chromium were determined in the

107
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

filtrate, The following reactions were assumed in
making these calculations:

Determination of Crt
(3) CF, + FT —= C3 4 Fe™™ + 2F~

(2b) Fe + o-phenanthroline —>

(Fe-o-phenanthroline tt)

The determination of ferrous iron was accom-
plished by extracting the iron with 0.2 M H,SO,,
as outlined in a previous report,! An indirect
method was used for the determination of divalent
chromium. The somple was dissolved in a 1%
(w/v) solution of ferric sulfate, as
reaction 3. The ferrous iron formed was then
measured colorimetrically as the ferrous o-phen-
anthroline complex. The concentration of FeF
originally found (reaction 1) was subtracted from
the iron found by reaction 2b. The total concen-
tration of iron and chromium in the filirate was
determined by conventional colorimetric methods.
The results indicate that the reaction proceeds
essentially as written and that no other oxidation
states of these particular metals are present.

This procedure is presently being used in the
laboratory, The interferences obviously include
any ion that will reduce ferric ions to ferrous ions.
The presence of uranium makes impractical the
application of this method to samples of the ARE
fuel. The correction for the tetravalent uranium
present (8 wt %) would seriously limit the precision
and accuracy of the methods

which occur os o consequence of the following
reaction:

NaZeF
CrF, + UF gm Cr, -+ UF
800°C

The melt is filtered ot 800°C, and samples of the
filtrate and residue are collected. Previous tests’
showed that 0.2 M ammonium oxalate selectively
leached both UF, and CF, from UF, and CrFy,
respectively. However, additional experiments
demonstrated that when CrF; and UF; were allowed
to react in NaZrF, ot 800°C, the entire sample
was soluble in ammonium oxalate solution, A
sample of NaCrF,, formed by heating CrF, and
NaF, also dissolved readily in 0.2 M (NH ,),C.0,.
Evidently, the complex formation of CrFF; and NaF
render the chromium compound susceptible to dis-
solution by oxalote, The absence of divalent
chromium in this sample of NaCrF ; was established
by the ferric sulfate test (reaction 3).

As a result of this discovery, the possibility of
selectively oxidizing chromium and uranium was
investigated. A tentative procedure was formulated

 

4

which involves the following steps.

I. Determine the reducing power of CrF, and
UF, by the use of an oxidont that will oxidize
these compounds to the trivalent and quadrivalent
states, respectively.

2. Determine the reducing power of CrF,, UF,
and UF, by the use of an oxidant that will oxidize
divalent chromium to the trivalent state and UF,
and UF, to the hexavalent state.

3. Determine total uranium,

4, Determine total chromium,

From the results of these four steps, the four
unknown quantities can be calculated. Steps 2,
3, and 4 present no difficulty, The problem of
solving step 1 is more formidable. Hydrogen ion
(HY) can be used to oxidize Cr** to Cr3* and ps3
to U4": however, adequate precision of the measure~
ment of the hydrogen produced has not been oi-
tained, as yet. In addition, the volume of gas is
usually less than 0.5 cm3, for practical purposes.
Hence, attention has been turned to other possible
oxidants for this step.

Oxidation of UF; by Hexavalent Uranium. Oxida-
tion of trivalent uranium to quadrivalent uranium
by hexavalent uranium can be represented as

203% 4 UO," 4 4HT ——> 3U%Y + 2H,0

An obvious advantage of this reoction is that
oxidation proceeds to the quadrivalent state. The
difficulty in this reaction is to ensure oxidation
by UO,* and not HY, as is usually the case.
Experiments were conducted in which UF, was dis-
solved in excess uranyl acetate solution and the
excess uo, was determined polarographically
by utilizing the hexavalent uranium reduction wave
at about ~0.2 volt vs, SCE. Helium was used to
sweep the solution before the addition of UF, and
the reaction was conducted in a helium atmosphere.
The reaction was usually complete within 30 min,
and green solutions, indicative of quadrivalent
uranium, were obtained. The results obtained in
various acid media are shown in Table 10.1,

The hydrogen ion apparently is the stronger
oxidizing agent in these tests. The oxidation
potential of the uo, ttaudt couple should be
increased in a solution of high hydrogen-ion con-
centration, This hypothesis is confirmed by the
data obtained, since oxidation of UF; by the
uo,** ion increased with increasing hydrogen con-
centration from 0 to 44% in sulfuric acid media.
However, complex formation of uo, and sulfate

ions was so marked at higher concentrations that
no further increase in oxidation potential was
observed. The use of perchloric acid media was
unsuccessful because the perchlorate ion was
reduced by trivalent uranium. None of the hexa-
valent uranium was consumed in the acetic acid
tests. A preliminary result with an oxalate medium
is shown in Table 10.1. Further work is under way
with oxalate media, as well as with hydrochloric
acid media.

Oxidation of Trivalent Uranium to Quadrivalent
Uranium with lodine. In an effort to eliminate
oxidation by the hydrogen ion, the use of non-
aqueous systems is being investigated, Prelimi-
nary work has been concerned with UCI, rather
than with UF; because of its greater solubility in
nonaqueous systems. The conversion of UF, to
UCI, by fusion with NaAICl, has been investigated
and is reported below onder the heading ‘‘Separa-
tion of UF, from UF,.”

lodine is sufficiently soluble in organic solutions
to permit its use as an oxidant, In aqueous media
the oxidation will probably proceed beyond the
tetravalent state, as shown in the following reac-
tion, to produce some hexavalent uranium:

were dissolved in excess
standard iodine solutions of various concentrations
of methanol in water, and the excess iodine was
titrated with sodium thiosulfate,

The results indicate thot the oxidation potential
of iodine decreases with increasing methanol con-
centration and that, in absolute methanol, incom-
plete oxidation results. In an 80% alcoholic
medium the oxidation of U3" to U4* is essentially
quantitative under the conditions of the test.
Further tests are under way, and a more sensitive
means of detecting the end point is to be employed.
The iodine-starch end point cannot be used in
concentrated methanol solutions. A potentiometric

chlorides and subsequent separation of the chlo-
rides.

Preferential Dissolution of UF,. The solubili-
ties of UF, and UF, in solvents such as solutions
of ethylenediominetetraacetic acid (EDTA) and
ammonium oxalate were studied further. Uranium
trifluoride is soluble to the extent of 0.2 to 0.4 mg
per 100 ml of solvent in 0,1 M solutions of EDTA ot
a pH of 6.8 to 6.9 at 25°C after 1 hr of contact.
The solubility of UF, is a function of time of
contact. The rate of dissolution appears to be
about 0.4 mg of UF, per 100 ml of solvent per hour
of contact. The absorption spectrum, between 370
and 670 my, of the supernatant liquor of the mix
ture of UF; and EDTA is similar to that of a solu-
tion of UF, in EDTA. This indicates that the
uranium exists in the same oxidation state in both
solutions as was reported previously! ond that the
solubility process essentially involves, first, the
oxidation of trivalent uranium to the tetravalent
state and, then, dissolution.

The time required for complete dissolution of 50
mg of UF; in 100 ml of 0.1 M EDTA solution varies
from 1 to 20 hr at 25°C, depending upon particle
size and previous treatment. Inasmuch as the rate
of dissolution of UF, varies so markedly, a signifi-
cont amount of UF; would be dissolved in ensuring
complete dissolution of UF, Any appreciable
solubility of UF; would cause large errors in
determinations of UF; and UF, in a sample which
contained UF , in a concentration greatly exceeding
that of UF,. Such on inherent error in the method
limits its applicability to the present problem.

Further study of the solvent action of solutions
of 0.2 M ammonium oxalate upon the solubility of
UF, at 100°C in a helium atmosphere indicated a
similar time effect. The rate of dissolution of a
batch of UF,, which had been analyzed as 90.4%
UF,, was found to be of the order of 6 to 13 mg
per 100 ml when samples of 50 to 100 mg were
refluxed for 1 hr under helium. The soluble fraction
was approximately 6.5% of the sample. Analysis
of the undissolved portion showed that it contained
91.5% UF,. After the initial hour of contact, the
rate of dissolution remained constant at 0.4 to
0.5 mg per 100 ml per hour over a 4-hr period at
100°C. At 25°C, the rate of dissolution, after the
initial hour, wos of the order of 3 mg per 100 ml
per 24 hours.

The absorption spectra of the UF j-oxalate ex-
tracts are identical to those of UF oxalate solu-

110

tions. These results reveal that UF, is slowly
oxidized to UF, in oxalate media. However, inas-
much as 100 mg of UF, rapidly dissolved in 0.2 M
ammonium oxalate, preferential dissolution of UF,
from UF, is more feasible in this medium than in
EDTA solutions.

Inorder to determine the feasibility of preferential
dissolution based on differences in rates of solu-
tion, a mixture of 8% UF, in NaZrF, was heated
at 800°C for 3 hr in a nickel container, and the
melt was filtered through a nickel frit. The filtrate
was olive drab after solidification, and it con-
stituted approximately 60% of the total sample.
The residue, retained on the frit, was an orange
solid, which was tentatively identified by petro-
graphic examination as UF ;.2ZrF ,, The composi-
tion of each phase is shown in Table 10.2.

Both the residue and filtrate were readily soluble

that a radical change in the nature of UF; results
when it is heated with NaZrF in a nickel vessel.
Similar behavior was observed with CrF;, as re-
poried previously. The data demonstrate con-
clusively that a separation of UF; and UF, based
on the difference in rates of solution is not feasible,

The similarity of the composition of the filtrate
and the residue is unique in view of the difference
in color. Only the nickel content is different, and
this may be explained on the basis of the nickel
container used. It was also noted that the residue,
upon exposure to the atmosphere, slowly changed
over a period of two weeks from orange to olive
drab. The trivalent uranium content, as expected,
decreased to 2.29%. The trivalent uranium con-
centration in the filtrate also decreased upon
standing to 2.66%. These data indicate that UF,
is not stable when it stands in clesed, air-filled
containers. Additional determinations of UF, will
be made to observe further oxidation.

Two somples of the fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF ,-
UF,, supplied by the Solid State Division, were
studied under the polarizing microscope. These
samples had been exposed to moisture prior to
canning and subjected to gamma radiation (5.1 x 10%r
at 79°F) in the MTR canal for 265 hours. The
object of this experiment by the Solid State Division
was to determine the effects, if any, that the
presence of moisture may have on radiation stability
of the fuel in comparison with fuel stored and
canned in a helium atmosphere. One sample was
canned in the laboratory atmosphere, and the other
was exposed in a desiccator containing water for

12 hr prior to canning in the laboratory atmosphere.
Both samples were found to contain hydrated
Na,Zr Fo, in addition to NaZr(U)F., as was
found previously when NaF-ZrF -UF , was exposed
to an atmosphere containing moisture. The irradia-
tion produced no effects which could be observed
with the polarizing microscope.

The usual routine petrographic examinations were

made for the ANP Fuels Section.

Estimates of removal cross sections based on the
continuum theory of the scattering of neutrons from
nuclei have given values which are in reasonable
agreement with measured values,

The shielding properties of lithium hydride and
water have been compared by using the concept of
the effective neutron removal cross section. If
lithium hydride could be substituted for water as
the neutron shield in an aircraft reactor, there
would be a considerable saving in weight,

ESTIMATES OF REMOVAL CROSS SECTIONS

The asymptotic choracter of the attenuation of
neutrons through large thicknesses of material was
expressed in a previous progress report! in the form
exp(—ox/)), where A is the largest eigenvalue of
an infinite matrix. The scattering was assumed to
take place at energies of several Mev (>4) from
nuclei sufficiently heavy so that energy losses
during the elastic-scattering process could be
neglected. In order to apply the results to the
calculation of removal cross sections for neutrons
from a fission source and for a material between

For lead and bismuth the forms of the total-cross-
section cuives indicate that the ‘continuum theory’
probably does not apply, but the energies of
importance were sufficiently high (rear 10 Mev) to
suggest that the calculation might give values
which were nearly correct, If the water thickness
were about 60 em, the energies of importance would
be much less? and the application of the continuum
theory would be less justified.

CRITIQUE OF LITHIUM HYDRIDE AS A
NEUTRON SHIELD

J. E. Faulkner
Physics Division

Water has been the most common neutron shield
contemplated for aircraft use to date, and any
compound substituted for it must give greater
attenuation for the same shield weight. Some
rather lengthy calculations performed on the
UNIVAC under the direction of NDA? have shown
that a slab of lithium hydride used as a neutron
shield will weigh only 63% as much as a thickness
of water which gives the same attenuation. Ad-
ditional comparisons of the shielding properties of
lithium hydride and water have now been made on
the basis of the effective neutron removal concept.’

Calculations made by using removal-cross-section
values of 2.4 barns/mole for lithium hydride and
3.02 barns/mole for water® indicate that a lithium
hydride shield would weigh 56% as much as a
water shield. This is considered to be in reasonable
agreement with the NDA results. Lithium hydride
is a better neutron attenuator on a volume hasis, as
wel! as on a weight basis, and would therefore be

This value for water is, of course, valid for only one
shield thickness, but it is reasonably constant for the
thicknesses considered here,

particularly important for spherical reactors where
compactness means greater weight saving. In all
the calculations, the density of lithium hydride is
taken to be 0.78 g¢/cm®, the value measured by
helium displacement.” For a spherical reactor with
a 100-cm-thick lithium hydride shield beginning
100 cm from the core, the thickness of water neces-
sary to give the same attenuation would be about
137 cm — a LiH-to-H,0 weight ratio of 0.44.

In a practical shield for a reflector-moderated
reactor (cf., Sec. 3, '‘Reflector-Moderated Reactor’’)
operating ata power of 600 megawatts, the maximum
temperature that would bereached in a 100-cm-thick
lithium hydride slab exposed to the resulting
neutron flux was calculated to be 315°F. The
maximum thermal gradient would be 1.12°C/cm. In
these calculations it was assumed that both faces
of the slob were cooled to 300°F and that the
thermal conductivity of lithium hydride was 0.01
cal/°C.cmsec.

Lithium hydride decomposes only slightly below
its melting point (1256°F), although it begins to

Investigations of the effects of one and two air
ducts on the fast-neutron dose received outside a
reactor shield have been continued at the Lid
Tank Facility, In addition, the radiation dose
measurements made behind 82 mockups of the
reflector-moderated reactor and shield have been
analyzed, and the effective neutron removal cross
section of B,0, has been measured.

AIR-DUCT TESTS
J. Mu Miller

Physics Division

The air-duct experimentation was continued both
as a study of the interference between adjacent
ducts and as a study of neutron-streaming through a
single duct. The ducts consisted of from one to
three straight cylindrical sections (22 in. long and
3% in. in diameter) joined at angles of 45
degrees. The first section of each duct was
placed adjacent to the source at an angle of 22%
deg with the normal.

At the time the previous studies of interference
reported, measurements had been made
beyond a three-section duct with a one-section

were

duct placed near it. In the first measurement, the
one-section duct was parallel to the first section
of the long duct and 12} in. from it. In this
position, it was in the same plane as the long duct
and lined up approximately with the last section.
In the second measurement, the small duct was
again parallel to the first section but closer (6 in.)
and above it in a different plane. It was noted that,
with the short duct in line, the fast-neutron dose
was a factor of 4.5 higher than for the long duct
alone. With the short duct not in line, the peak of
the dose was the same as that for the long duct
alone, although the curve was broadened.

An additional measurement was made recently in
which the axis of a one-section duct intersected
the axis of a three-section duct (offset by an angle

of 22%, deg from the plane of the long duct). In this
position, there was neutron-streaming from the
short duct into the middle section of the long duct
to the extent that the fast-neutron dose was in-
creased by a factor of 1.4. 1t is assumed that the
streaming through the one-section duct was con-
siderably higher than was indicated by the dose
measurements. The neutrons undoubtedly passed
straight across the long duct and scattered in the
water beyond.

Other measurements have been made on single
ducts consisting of one and two sections. The
fast-neutron isodose plots for both these ducts are
given in Figs. 12.1 and 12.2, The curves in Fig.
12.2 show that some of the neutrons ‘‘feed out’ of
the duct at the end of the first section, as would be
expected. These experiments will be described in
detail in a separate report.’

The beryllium reflector region should be about
12 in. thick to obtain a good compromise between
over-all reactor shield weight and core reactivity
requirements. The thickness of the heat-exchanger
region has relatively little effect on neutron and
gamma doses as functions of the distance from the
source plate.

118

For the gamma-shield thicknesses tested (0 to
7.5 in), the substitution of lead for water has
practically no effect on the neutron attenuation
well out in the shield. A 0.13-in.-thick layer of
B'0 (density = 2.1) is as effective as 1 in. of B,C
(density = 1.95) in depressing the thermal-neutron
flux and consequent capture gammas. Dividing the
lead region into layers separated by borated
hydrogenous material gives some reduction in
gamma dose for a given thickness of lead; however,
the full-scale shield designis simplified structurally
by placing all the lead together just outside the
pressure shell. While lumping the lead increases
the lead thickness required, keeping its radius to
a minimum largely compensates for this; therefore
very nearly minimum over-all shield weights can be
obtained in this way for lead thicknesses of up
to 6.0 inches,

On a volumetric basis, transformer oil is as
effective as water in attenuating the neutron flux,
Since the density of the oil is about 0.87, an
apprecioble saving inshield weight can be obtained
by using oil, if it is borated. Some of this weight
saving is offset, since the thickness of the lead
layer must be increased because the attenuation of
the gamma flux is not so great in the oil, Beryllium
is more effective than water on a thickness basis
for fast-neutron attenuation.

lt is important that a boron curtain be used be-
tween the heat exchanger and the pressure shell,
as well as between the reflector and the heat
exchanger, to inhibit capture gamma production and
to reduce secondary coolant activation.

It does not appear to be worthwhile to use
rubidium instead of sodium or NaK as a secondary
coolant. Potassium is preferable to sodium with
regard to activation, but it is inferior as a heat-

obtained are given in Fig. 12.3. It will be noted
that three methods were used to calculate the
dose for a shield containing a 4.5-in. lead layer.
The results from all three methods agree closely,
and therefore there is some assurance that the
curve presented is realistic. In Fig. 12.4, the
gamma doses at various distances from the shield
are given as a function of lead thickness in the
gamma-shield region.

A mean curve of the fast-neutron data taken out
to 110 cm behind configurations 39 and 75 was
chosen as the basis for a neutron dose curve
corrected to the designed shield (Fig. 12.5). Since
the limitations of the dosimeter prevent measure-
ments of the fast-neutron dose at distances greater

D ;{gammas) = 0.75(5.87 x 104) rem/hr

From Fig. 12.5, it can be seen that the corrected
Lid Tank neutron dose for z = 105 is 2 x 10-2
mrep/hr, Since 2 > 1,47, the approximate value of
z is determined by interpolation to be 107 cm. Thus

Ry = 107 cm + 23 cm = 130 em

The gamma shield necessary can be read directly
from Fig. 12.4 as approximately 5.3 in. of lead.

The weights of the neutron and gommo shields
can be computed after their distances from the
center of the reactor are determined. The neces-
sary dimensions are presented in Table 12.1. For
a 50-megawatt reactor with a 9-in. core radius, a
1.6-in.-thick heat exchanger seems reasonable. !?
The inner radius of the lead layer is approximately
25.3 in., and its weight is approximately 21,600

121
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

pounds. The inner radius of the neutron shield is
30.6 in., and its outer radius is 51.3 in., which
gives a neutron shield weight of 15,900 pounds.
Thus the total basic reactor shield weight is 37,500
pounds.

Approximate weights of the reactor core, heat
exchanger, and pressure vessel components may be
determined by a volume-density calculation.
(Tables presenting such data appear in refs. 10 and
11.) If the weights of these components are added
to the basic shield, the basic designed reactor and
shield assembly is found to weigh 44,500 pounds.
This weight does not include the weight of the
crew shield, which is necessary for reducing the
10 rem/hr dose at 50 ft to acceptable tolerances
within the crew compartment. There are problems
such as the emission of short-lived fission-product
decay gammas in the intermediate heat exchanger
and the leakage of radiation through passages in
the shield that may require small further additions
to the shield weight. Such refinements are not
treated in this calculation because the Lid Tank
experiments do not contribute to their resolution.

REMOVAL CROSS SECTIONS

An interesting check on removal-cross-section
measurements has been provided by an experiment
in which solid B,0; was used in the usual large-
slab geometry. A value of 4.4 £ 0.14 barns was
obtained in this experiment for the removal cross
section of B,0,, which is to be compared with the

TTA. P. Fraas and C. B. Mills, A Reflector-Moderated
Circulating Fuel Reactor for an Aircraft Power Plant,

ORNL CF-53-3-210 (Mor. 27, 1953).

122

value of 4.56 barns calculated by using the previ-
ously published figures of 0.87 barn for boron and
0.94 barn for oxygen.

INSTRUMENTATION

Experience in operating neutron dosimeters with
flowing ethylene has shown that the temperature
must be controlled more carefully than has been
possible heretofore, and therefore provisions are
being made to maintain the temperature of the
water in the Lid Tank at some constant value. It
is anticipated that the constant water temperature
will also improve the accuracy of measurements with
other instruments and will eliminate uncertainties
arising from the expansion or change in solubility
of shielding materials such as B,0,.

In measuring gamma doses of less than 0.1 mr/hr,
the sensitivity of the Lid Tank scintillation
counters is inadequate when an electrometer circuit
is used, Amplification of individual pulses followed
by an integration of the resulting pulse-height
spectrum increases the useful sensitivity of the
instrument by a factor of af least 100 and has been
extensively used in the Lid Tank and elsewhere.
Difficulties encountered in calibration when using
artificial sources in air have been avoided by
normalizing the data taken in the Lid Tank to
measurements made by using the electrometer
circuit, A more serious uncertainty has recently
been uncovered, namely, a systematic difference in
the observed relaxation lengths in water following
certain shield configurations when the two tech-
niques are employed. The difference is apparently
caused by a change in the energy sensitivity of the
instrument when the pulse integrator is being used.
This effect is being studied further.

K. M. Henry

Physics Division

The work at the Bulk Shielding Facility during
this quarter was devoted to the measurement of
mockups of two bulk shields for the GE-ANP
program, The first shield tested (BSF Exp. 18)
was a mockup of a duct system and shield to be
used at the G-E Idaho reactor test facility, The
second mockup consisted of two sections of the
reactor shield of the R-1 ANP divided shield. The
first of these sections was the rear or aft section
(BSF Exp. 19), and the other was the front or
forward section (BSF Exp. 20). The minimum
reactor power was used for all measurements on
these sections so as not to appreciably activate the
iron in the shield, since this mockup is scheduled
for further testing at the Tower Shielding Facility.

G-E TEST FIXTURE DUCT EXPERIMENT

H. E. Hungerford
Physics Division

The G-E tdaho facility duct mockup (test fixture
duct system) consists of two, long, 10-in.-ID steel
ducts, a cubical air void or plenum chamber, and
two shields. The experimental setup is shown in
Fig. 13.1. The reactor was located along one side
of the plenum chamber, and one of the ducts
emerged from the plenum chamber and wound out
through the two shields. For this experiment, a
special offset reactor with a 5 by 7 fuel-element
loading was used. This loading permitted as much
fuel as possible to be located near the plenum
chamber, which was separated from the reactor by
3 in. of water. The duct (upper duct) leading from
the plenum chamber contained three right-angle
bends, one on the horizontal plane and the other
two at an angle of 60 deg with the horizontal plane.
An auxiliary duct (lower duct) is shown below the
upper duct in Fig. 13.1, One of the shields, which
consisted of three 5 x 5%, ft lead slabs totaling a
thickness of 7.0 in. and was encased in steel slabs

"Nee McCammon.

2p art time,

1.75 in. in thickness, was located directly between
the reactor and the duct system, The other shield
was located directly in front of the plenum chamber
at the emergence of the upper duct and consisted
of iron slabs totaling a thickness of 11.75 inches.

The purpose of the experiment was to test some
design features of the shield of the ldaho facility.
The mockup represented only a portion of the
actual! duct and shield system.

Dose measurements were made along the various
traverse lines indicated in Figs. 13.1 and 13.2.
Figure 13.2, which is an elevation of the mockup
looking west, clearly shows the position of the
upper and lower ducts, as well as a theoretical
outline of the outer surface of the shield. Points
A through P indicate the location of the corres-
ponding traverse lines AA through PP,

Fast-neutron measurements made along traverse
lines AA through PP are shown in Fig, 13.3. The
peaks of all curves, except the DD traverse,
occurred at approximately 15 cm west of the pool
center line and corresponded to the final, long,
straight section of the upper duct.

The corresponding thermal-neutron measurements,
shown in Fig. 13.4, represent o more extensive
survey than that made for fast neutrons. The
thermal-neutron peaks of the traverses AA through
Hl showed systematic variation from a location
about 20 cm west of the center line for traverses
near the upper duct to locations nearer the center
line at larger distances from the duct.

The gamma-ray measurements made along the
traverse lines AA through PP are shown in Fig.
13.5. These data are of special interest because
of the double peak shown on the AA traverse. The
larger peak was located 50 ¢m east of the center
line, and the smaller peak appeared at about the
line. In succeeding traverses at larger
distances from the mockup, the smaller peak dis-
appeared and the larger peak shifted nearer to the
center line. The larger peak was apparently due to

center

radiation leaking out from between the two shields,
and the smaller peak wos due to capture gamma

rays from thermal neutrons captured in iron and
water near the thermal-neutron peak,

Results of measurements at the end of the duct
taken along traverse lines QQ and RR show a large
thermal-neutron peak, a small fast-neutron peak, and
no gamma-ray peak (Fig. 13.6). These data indicate
that, for the most part, only thermal neutrons were
scattered down the duct. The intensity of thermal
neutrons at the end of the duct was about 1% of
their intensity at the entrance of the final, long,
straight section of the duct.

In addition, the plenum chamber was flooded with
water and the AA traverse measurements were
repeated. The measurements taken are compared
with the previous measurements in Fig. 13.7. The
contribution of the plenum chamber to the dose
along line AA is clearly indicated. The fast-
neutron dose was diminished by only about 12% by
flooding the plenum chamber, while the thermal-

124

neutron flux was reduced by a factor of 5. The
large gamma-ray peak disappeared with the flooding,
and the small peak was reduced in intensity by a
factor of 2. These data indicate that about 80% of
the thermal neutrons in the duct system originated
in (or passed through) the plenum chamber,

The results of these measurements agree quite
well with calculated estimates for the design. The
data are reported in greater detail in ref. 3.

lines indicated.

Figure 13.8 shows a plan view of this section of
the shield, together with the location of the various
traverse lines along which measurements were
made. The main feature of this section is the
annular air duct between the inner and outer water
shields. Also shown in Fig. 13.8 is a small air
void and 3 in, of water located between the reactor
and the shield. Dose measurements were taken
along traverses north and east of the shield. The
results were similar to those taken on the front
section (see below) and are not included in this
summary.

At the completion of the measurements on the
rear section, the mockup was removed and the
forward or front section was installed in its place.

This section was of the same diameter as the rear
section but was thicker, It also had an air void
and 3 in. of water between it and the reactor. In
addition, the annular air void contained two extra
bends. A lead and steel shadow shield was located
within the inner portion of the shield, which also
contained water borated to 1.12 wt % boron. To
complete the mockup, a shield made of lead, steel,
and borated water was placed on the east side of
the reactor. A plan view of the setup and the
locations of the various traverse lines along which
measurements were made are shown in Fig. 13.9,

Fast-neutron measurements taken along east-west
traverse lines on the north side of the shield are

Fig. 13.9. Plan View of Forward Section of GE-ANP R-1 Reactor Shield. Shadow shield, side shield,

and position of traverse lines indicated.

neutron measurements are presented in Fig. 13.11,
In each figure, peaks occurring at points 45 cm
from either side of the shield center line coincided
with the end of the air-duct region and ‘‘washed
" with distance from the shield. Later, the air
void was flooded and some of the measurements
were repeated. The peaks 45 cm from the center
line vanished, as was to be expected. Flooding of
the air void also reduced the thermal- and fast-

out

132

neutron intensities emerging at the center line by
a factor of 4,

The gamma-ray measurements north of the shield
(not shown) indicate that the dose just outside the
shield at the center line was 3.0 x 107 ¢/hr/watt;
with the air void flooded, the dose dropped to
1.5 x 107% v/hr/ watt.

The effect of the extra thickness of the forward
section was to reduce the fast- and thermal-neutron
PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1954

intensities outside the forward section by a factor
of 1000 under the dose outside the corresponding a
portion of the rear section. In the case of gamma
rays, the reduction factor was nearly 10,000 because
of the added shadow shield andboration of the water
of the inner shield,

The measurements taken along various north-south 17
traverse lines on the east side of this section are
shown in Fig. 13.12 (fast neutrons),Fig. 13.13 (ther-

cases, a slight peaking effect was observed in the
region 115 to 120 cm south of the north face of the
shield. In some cases, the measurements were
extended southward as far as the reactor east-
west center line, which was located 186.2 cm south
of the north face. The south face of the shield

proper was located about 140 cm south of the north ot

14. TOWER SHIELDING FACILITY

Physics Division

The Tower Shielding Facility (Fig. 14.1) is
nearly completed, and operation should begin
during March. A complete set of instruments has
been collected for the experimental program; some
of the instruments were especially developed for
use at this facility, Consideration is being given
to using the Tower Shielding Facility in a biological
program for establishing dose rates for pilots in a
nuclear-powered aircraft, and therefore a study is
under way of the radiation doses which can be
achieved.

FACILITY CONSTRUCTION

The construction of the T ower Shielding Facility
{at the 7700 Area) has been completed, and most of
the work of the outside contractors has been ac-
cepted. All the ground facilities (control building,
roads, fences, grading, reactor pool, etc.) were ap-
proved by the Laboratory on February 4. The steel
structure, hoist house, and hoist installation have
been accepted on the condition that some additional
painting will be done by the contractor.

The hoists, the last of which was delivered
February 1, will require minor modifications. It
became apparent during the course of testing that
the hoists did not operate properly under no-load
conditions; the lines became excessively slack.
This condition will be corrected by the addition
of weight to the floating sheave blocks. In ad-
dition, a slack-line limit switch will be designed
and installed which should prevent any damage at
the hoist drums because of a slack line.

The mechanical components of the reactor have
been tested. It is expected that final installation
will have been completed in time for the Tower
Shielding Facility to go critical by March 1,

RADIATION DETECTION EQUIPMENT
T.V. Blosser

Physics Division

During the past year, a complete set of instru-
ments has been collected and checked out for
making experimental dose and energy measurements

at the Tower Shielding Facility. Some of the
instruments are standard and have been in general
use at both the Lid Tank Facility and the Bulk
Shielding Facility, Other instruments have been
developed or modified to meet the requirements.
The instruments used for specific measurements
are described in the following paragraphs.

Thermal-Neutron Flux

1. BF; Chamber. The instrument is a standard
counter, except that the physical dimensions have
been made the same as those of the fast-neutron
dosimeter to ensure the same geometry for com-
parison of measurements,

2. U?35 Fission Chamber. A standard counter
was modified to give a flatter plateau on the
pulse-height curve.

3. Flow-Type Foil Counter. A standard counter
will be used.

Fast-Neuvtron Dose

1. Flow-Type Neutron Dosimeter. A three-cavity
dosimeter was developed from the Hurst absolute
dosimeter. It will be used for medium intensities,
that is, approximately 0.1 to 20 rep/hr,

2, Multichamber Neutron Dosimeter, Three flow-
type neutron dosimeters mounted in parallel will be
used for low-intensity measurements, that is,
approximately 0.03 to 5 rep/hr.

3. Absolute Dosimeter. A standard Hurst absolute
chamber with a built in plutonium alpha source will
be used for intercalibration of neutron sources and
neutron chambers.

4, Phantom-Type Dosimeter. A standard Hurst
dosimeter will be used in high fluxes, that is,
approximately 10 rep/hr to limit of recording
equipment,

Gamma-Ray Dose

2. Anthrocene Crystal (5 in). A standard
instrument will be used for normal dose rates,
that is, approximately 2 r/hr.

3. Anthracene Crystal (% in.) with Lead Ab-
sorption Wheel. A Yy=in. anthracene crystal will
be mounted in a lead box with a small circular
opening in one side. A lead wheel, which varies
in thickness from 0 to 0.7 in., can be rotated to
cover the opening and thus show the effect of
adding small thicknesses of lead to a shield.

4, Anthracene Crystal (1 in). A standard instru-
ment will be used for low dose rates, that is,
approximately 200 mr/hr.

Other Gamma-Ray Detectors

1. Sodium lodide Crystal (1 x 1% in). A standard
counter will be used.

Facility, February 12, 1954,

2. Cobalt-Wire Scamner. The scanner, which
consists of a single cobalt wire that can be in-
serted along the full length of center fuel plate,
was developed for determining flux distribution
within each fuel element of the reactor. Upon
withdrawal, the wire will be surveyed with a sodium
iodide crystal.

Isodose Plotter

An isodose plotter was developed for surveying
the crew compartment in the x,y, and z coordinates.
When the plotter is used with each of the other
detection instruments and allied electronics
systems, the intensity curves at given positions
can be plotied automatically.
ESTIMATE OF NEUTRON AND GAMMA
RADIATION EXPECTED AT THE TOWER
SHIELDING FACILITY

C. E. Clifford
Physics Division

Estimates of some of the neutron and gamma
doses which can be achieved at the Tower Shielding
Facility for use in a biological program have been
made on the basis of measurements of radiation at
the Lid Tank Facility and the Bulk Shielding
Facility.

The Bulk Shielding Facility measurements show
a gamma dose of 16 r/hr/watt for a 17.5-cm-thick
water shield and a neutron dose of 1 rep/hr/watt
for an 18.4-cm-thick water shield. The Lid Tank
Facility data show that a 17.5-cm-thick lead~borated
water shield (11.4 cm of lead) reduces the gamma
dose to approximately one-twentieth of that for a
pure-water shield of the same thickness. However,

TABLE 14.1.

PERIOD ENDING MARCH 10, 1954

the neutron dose is increased by a factor of 4.8.
Thus the gamma dose at the outer surface of an
approximately  18-cm-thick lead-borated water

shield (11.4 cm of lead) would be '%, or 0.8
r/hr/watt, and the neutron dose would be 4.8
rep/hr/watt. This gives a ratio of 6 rep to 1 r,

If isotropic emission is assumed and the buildup
factors are neglected, the distance from the lead~
borated water shield surface at which a 10-rep
dose would be received for a maximum reactor
power of 100 kw (area of reactor face = 3 fi?;
relaxation length of 1.5-Mev neutrons = 300 ft) is
approximately 123 feet. At the same point, the
gamma dose would be 2.0 r/hr.

The distance from an 18-cm-thick pure-water
shield at which a 10+ gamma dose would be
received (gamma relaxation length in air = 1200 1)
is 250 #t; the neutron dose at the same point is
0.33 rep/hr. These and other results are given in

Table 14.1.
