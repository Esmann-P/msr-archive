wave configuration. The tubes are held in place by wire lacing in this
upper portion of the tube bundle. Since baffling is not employed in
this region, the bent-tube portion of the bundle experiences essentially
parallel flow and a relatively lower heat transfer performance.

Below the bent-tube region of the bundle, evenly spaced doughnut-
shaped baffles are used to hold the tubes in place and to produce cross
flow. The baffles spacings and cross-flow velocities are designed to min-
imize the possibility of flow-induced vibration. The tubes in this baf-
fled region of the heat exchanger have a helical indentation knurled
into their surface to enhance the film heat transfer coefficients and
thereby reduce the fuel salt inventory in the exchanger. No enhancement
of this nature was used in the upper bent-tube region because of present
uncertainty about the reliability of tubes that are both bent and

indented.

Abstract

Three computer programs were developed to make design
calculations for the heat exchangers for Molten-Salt Breeder
Reactor concepts. They are the program for the primary heat
exchangers, PRIMEX; the program for the reheaters, RETEX;
and the program for the steam generator superheaters, SUPEX.
Each type of exchanger analyzed is described, the basic equa-
tions used in each analysis are given, and the logic used in
each program is discussed briefly in this report. Flow dia-
grams, lists of input required and output received, complete
program listings, and the nomenclature for the programs as
well as example computer input and output for the exchangers
described are appended.

1. INTRODUCTION

The concept of a single-fluid Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR)
with a thermal capacity of 2250 MW and a net electrical output of 1000 MW
has some very special heat exchange requirements. In the present concep-
tual design for the MSBR plant, there are four heat exchangers in the
primary system that transfer heat from the molten fluoride fuel-salt mix-
ture to the molten sodium fluoroborate coolant salt. In the secondary
system, there are eight reheaters and 16 steam generators that transfer
heat from the coolant salt. The manner in which these exchangers were
designed to meet the special heat exchange requirements and the computer
programs that were developed to calculate the design numbers are described
in this report.

The development of MSBR concepts passed through a number of stages
during which the plant layout was improved, core configurations were
optimized, and physical property data were refined. The first formal
study of a MSBR heat exchange system made by the authors was reported in
1967 (GE&C Division Design Analysis Section, "Design Study of a Heat-
Exchange System For One MSBR Concept,' USAEC Report ORNL TM-1545, Oak
Ridge National Laboratory, September 1967). To analyze one exchanger at
each stage of its subsequent development without programming a large por-
tion of the necessary calculations would have meant almost continual rep-
etition of these calculations over a period of many months. With com-
puter programs available, the design for an exchanger could easily be
updated for changed capacity, physical properties, temperatures, pres-
sures, etc.

Three such computer programs were developed. One computer program
was written to make the design calculations for the primary heat
exchanger, and it is the PRIMEX program. This program was modified at
one stage of its development to perform the calculations for the steam
reheater exchangers. This modified version is the RETEX program. A
third computer program was written to perform the design calculations for
the steam generator superheater exchangers, and it is the SUPEX program.
The design data for each of these three types of exchanger, the basic
equations used in each design analysis, and each of the computer programs
developed to perform the analysis are described in the following sections
of this report. Flow charts for each program, lists of the input
required and the output provided by each program, complete program list-
ings, nomenclature lists for each program, and the computer input and

output for each type of heat exchanger discussed are appended.
2. PRIMEX, THE PRIMARY HEAT EXCHANGER PROGRAM

There are four primary heat exchangers, which transfer heat from the
fuel salt to the coolant salt, in the conceptual design for a single-
fluid MSBR. Each of these exchangers has a thermal capacity of 556 MW
and each is of the same design. The fuel salt circuits for the primary
heat exchangers are in parallel, each having its own fuel pump. The
coolant salt from each exchanger is circulated through its own system of
two reheater exchangers and four steam generators.

At full design load, the fuel salt enters the top of the primary
heat exchanger at a temperature of 1300°F and exits from the bottom at a
temperature of 1050°F for return to the reactor. The coolant salt at a
temperature of 850°F enters the top of the primary heat exchanger and is
directed to the bottom of the exchanger through a central downcomer where
it enters the shell side of the exchanger, flows upward in counterflow
to the fuel salt, and leaves the top of the exchanger at a temperature of
1150°F. This coolant salt is circulated through the steam reheaters and
steam generators where its heat is transferred to the exhaust steam and
feedwater, respectively.

The design conditions for the primary heat exchanger were partially
dictated by the overall requirements of the MSBR system. The heat load,
entrance and exit temperatures of the fuel and coolant salts, and the
maximum or desired pressure drops across the shell and tube sides of the
exchanger were specified by the operating conditions of the system.
Design considerations for the overall system dictated the type of
exchanger, arrangement of nozzles to facilitate piping, minimum tube
diameter considered to be consistent with fabrication practices, and the
limit on the overall length of the exchanger. Certain criteria such as
the maximum allowable temperature drop across the tube walls and the need
to build in enough tube flexibility to compensate for differential ther-
mal expansion were established by the strength of the materials. Vibra-
tion considerations placed limits on flow velocities and the spacing
between baffles. In addition, it is highly desirable that the volume of

fuel salt be kept at a minimum to lower the doubling time of the reactor.
Within the framework of these requirements and guidelines, a
computer program was developed to perform a parameter study and select
the design for the primary heat exchanger that employs a minimum volume
of fuel salt. The design data and equations discussed in the following
subsections were used to develop the computer program for the primary

heat exchanger (PRIMEX).

Each of the four primary heat exchangers is a vertical shell-and-
tube type with a single counterflow pass on both the tube and shell sides.
Each unit is about 6 ft in diameter and about 22 ft tall, not including
the coolant salt U-bend piping at the top. A cross-sectional elevation
of a typical primary heat exchanger is illustrated in Fig. 2.1, and the
pertinent design data are given in Table 2.1.

The fuel (primary) salt enters the tube side of the primary heat
exchanger at the top and flows out the bottom of the exchanger after a
single pass through the 3/8-in.-0D tubes. The coolant (secondary) salt
enters at the top of the exchanger, flows to the bottom of the exchanger
through a central 20-in.-diameter downcomer where it enters the annular
shell containing the tubes, flows upward around modified disk and dough-
nut baffles, and exits through a 28-in.-diameter pipe concentric with the
inlet pipe at the top.

The tubes are arranged in concentric rings in the bundle with a con-
stant radial pitch and a circumferential pitch that is as constant as
can be obtained. The L-shaped tubes are welded into a horizontal tube
sheet at the bottom and into a vertical tube sheet at the top. The
toroidal-shaped top head and tube sheet assembly has a significant
strength advantage, simplifies the arrangement for coolant-salt flow, and
allows the seal weld for the top closure to be located outside the heat
exchanger.

To accommodate differential thermal expansion between the shell and

tubes, about 4 ft of the upper portion of the tubing is bent into a sine

wave configuration. The tubes are held in place by wire lacing in this
upper portion of the tube bundle. Since baffling is not employed in
this region, the bent-tube portion of the bundle experiences essentially
parallel flow and a relatively lower heat transfer performance.

Below the bent-tube region of the bundle, evenly spaced doughnut-
shaped baffles are used to hold the tubes in place and to produce cross
flow. The baffle spacings and cross-flow velocities are designed to min-
imize the possibility of flow-induced vibration. The tubes in this baf-
fled region of the heat exchanger have a helical indentation knurled
into their surface to enhance the film heat transfer coefficients and
thereby reduce the fuel salt inventory in the exchanger. No enhancement
of this nature was used in the upper bent-tube region because of present
uncertainty about the reliability of tubes that are both bent and

indented.
2.2 Design Calculations

 

Since experience with both the fuel and coolant salts is limited,
there was and still is a certain degree of uncertainty associated with
the transport properties of salt and its behavior as a heat transfer
medium. The design properties of the fuel salt, coolant salt, and of
Hastelloy N used in the concept of a single-fluid MSBR and incorporated
in the primary heat exchanger computer program are given in Appendix A.

As previously described, the tubes in the baffled portion of the
primary heat exchanger are helically indented to improve heat transfer
performance. Experiments performed by C. G. Lawson, R. J. Kedl, and R.
E. McDonald’ indicated that this indentation is expected to result in an
improvement by a factor of 2 in the tube-side heat transfer coefficient.
An enhancement factor of 1.3 for the heat transfer coefficient outside
the tubes is suggested by Lawson” although no experiments have been done
to support this recommendation. The experimental work™ that was per-
formed was limited to Reynolds numbers greater than 10,000, and there is
some uncertainty about the degree of improvement that can be expected for
Reynolds numbers of less than 10,000. It was assumed that no improvement
can be expected in a truly laminar flow (Reynolds numbers less than 1000),
and the improvement expected for the intermediate range was extrapolated
by using a method suggested by H. A. McLain.® The resulting enhancement

factors (EF) are

EF, = 2.0 and EF = 1.3 for Reynolds numbers > 10,000
and
EF, = 1.0 and EF = 1.0 for Reynolds numbers < 1000,
where
EF, = enhancement factor inside tube and
EF = enhancement factor outside tube (cross flow).

where N_, = the corresponding Reynolds number.

Re
The enhancement factors for heat transfer resulting from the helical

indentation of the tubes in the baffled region were assumed to have a
proportionate effect on pressure drop. The shell-side pressure drop was
calculated by using the procedure reported by 0. P. Bergelin et al.,* and
the tube-side pressure drop was calculated by using the conventional
friction-factor method. An overall leakage factor of 0.5 was used for
the pressure drop in the shell side of the heat exchanger, and a factor
of 0.8 was used in the heat transfer calculations. These leakage factors
were selected on the basis of recommendations reported by Bergelin et al.”
The correct leakage factor, which is dependent upon various clearances
between tubes and baffles and between baffles and the shell, will have

to be calculated when the actual design for the primary heat exchanger
has been completed.

Since molten fluoride salts do not wet Hastelloy N, the containing
material of the heat exchanger, it was suspected that the usual heat
transfer correlations, which are normally based on experiments with water
or petroleum products, might not be valid. However, recent experiments
performed by B. Cox" indicated that basically the behavior of the fuel
salt is similar to that of conventional fluids. The correlations devel-
oped by Cox result in heat transfer coefficients somewhat lower than
those obtained from the Sieder and Tate correlations for turbulent
regions,’ Hansen's equation for transition regions,” and the Sieder and
Tate correlations for laminar regions.’ The correlations used in this
study are those based on the data developed by Cox that were recommended
by H. A. McLain.® These are given in Eqs. 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5.

No experiments have been performed to date to develop correlations
for the heat transfer behavior of a sodium fluoroborate coolant salt in
the shell side of the heat exchanger. The correlation developed by O. Pp.
Bergelin et al.? was used for the baffled region of the MSBR primary heat

oO

exchanger, and the correlation developed by D. A. Donohuel® was used for

the unbaffled region.
Although selected as being the most representative available for the

% is strictly for cross flow and

baffled region, Bergelin's correlation
his data were based on work with half-moon shaped baffles with straight

edges. Since disk and doughnut baffles are used in the MSBR primary heat
exchanger, the adaptation of Bergelin's data involved certain interpreta-

tions in determining the cross-sectional areas involved. The correlation
12

for cross flow was also modified by the introduction of a correction
factor. This correction factor is dependent upon the degree of actual
cross flow that exists as determined by the ratio between the baffle
spacing and the annular thickness of the vessel. Data from Bergelin's
original experiment? were used to estimate the value of the correction
factor, which is expressed as

13

In the method advanced by Bergelin,? the region between two baffles
is considered as three parts: one pure cross-flow zone between two win-
dow zones, as illustrated in Fig. 2.2. The mass velocity in each zone
is based on the effective area of each zone. In a window zone, the

effective area is given by the expression

5, = (5,55)%/2 (2.11)
where
S., = free cross-sectional area in baffle window, ft®, and
Sg = free cross-sectional area for cross flow between tubes applied

at lip of the baffle, ft2.

The effective area of the pure cross-flow zone is given by the expression

Sp = 0-5(Sy +8 ) (2.12)

where the indices 1 and 2 indicate the sides of the pure cross-flow zone.

The number of restrictions was interpreted as being the number of rows
of tubes in the direction of cross flow. The full number was used for
the cross-flow zone, while only half of the number of rows was used for
each of the window zones. The shell-side pressure drop in the upper
bent-tube region of the exchanger was taken as being approximately equal

to the pressure drop across one baffled zone.

2.3 Description of PRIMEX

 

The computer program for the MSBR primary heat exchanger, PRIMEX,
is presented in Appendix B. In this program, each zone between two baf-
fles was considered as one increment length. The calculations are begun
on the hot side of the heat exchanger, and increments are added until a
complete heat balance is achieved. The dependence of each of the physi-
cal properties on temperature is given as an empirical equation, and
these equations are incorporated in the main program. If any of these
equations are changed, the appropriate data card must be replaced. The
physical property data as well as the other input data required for the
PRIMEX program are listed in Appendix B. A list of the output data
received from the computer is also presented.

A stress analysis subroutine, TUBSTR, is incorporated in the main
program. This subroutine performs a preliminary stress analysis of the
tubes with the assumption that the maximum tube stress will occur in the
upper bent-tube region of the heat exchanger. Pressure stresses, stresses
resulting from thermal expansion, and stresses resulting from the thermal
gradient across the tube wall are considered. The primary and secondary
stresses are computed, and these computed values are compared with the
allowable values given in Section III, Nuclear Vessels, of the ASME

Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. A second subroutine, LAGR, is used for
17

interpolation of values from a given table. The complete listing for the
main program together with its two subroutines is given in Appendix B.

To illustrate the use of the PRIMEX program, the computer input data
for the MSBR primary heat exchanger discussed in Subsection 2.1 and the
output data printed by the computer are included in Appendix B. The time
required for a typical IBM 360/91 computer run of this program is about

2 minutes.

2.4 Evaluation of PRIMEX

 

It is believed that the use of the PRIMEX computer program will
result in a primary heat exchanger whose volume of fuel salt will be kept
to a minimum and whose design will be more reliable than can be achieved
with normal hand calculations. Variations in physical properties and
complicated geometries are handled easily, and an extensive parameter
study can be made in a very short time.

However, the output of a computer program cannot be better than the
input. The input data which have a significant effect on the design of
the heat exchanger are the physical properties of the fuel and coolant
salts, the heat transfer correlations used, the enhancement factors
assumed for the helically indented tubes, and the leakage factors associ-
ated with fabrication clearances. The average deviations in the physical
properties of the fuel and coolant salts presently used in the program

1 The most notable uncertainties

are those reported by J. R. McWherter.?t
in the physical property values presently are associated with the viscos-
ity and thermal conductivity of the fuel salt. The average deviation

for the fuel-salt heat transfer correlation is reported® as being about
5.7%. The deviation or error resulting from the use of Bergelin's cor-
relation? is not certain, but shell-side heat transfer coefficients nor-
mally have a deviation of about 25%. The leakage factor deviation for
the pressure drop might be about 20%, and the leakage factor deviation

for the shell-side heat transfer coefficient might be about 10%. The

enhancement factor deviation might be about 15%.
18

The two extreme cases were checked. All of the pessimistic values
were used in one case, and all of the optimistic values were used in the
other case. The result was a maximum estimated deviation in the overall
heat transfer area (or volume of fuel salt) of +38% (additional area

required) for the pessimistic case and -28% (less area required) for the

optimistic case.

3. RETEX, THE STEAM REHEATER EXCHANGER PROGRAM

The coolant salt circulating system in the conceptual design of a
single-fluid MSBR consists of four independent loops, each containing
salt circulating pumps, steam generators, steam reheaters, and the shell
side of one of the four primary heat exchangers. There are two steam
reheater exchangers, which transfer heat from the coolant salt to pre-
heated exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine, in each coolant salt
loop; with a total of eight reheaters to meet the total steam reheating
requirement of approximately 5.1 X 10% lb/hr. Each reheater is of the
same design, and each has a thermal capacity of about 36.6 MW.

At full design load, the coolant salt from the primary heat exchanger
enters the shell side of the reheater at a temperature of 1150°F and
exits at a temperature of 850°F for return to the primary heat exchanger.
The preheated exhaust steam from the high-pressure turbine enters the
tube side of the reheater at a temperature of 650°F, flows through the
tubes in counterflow to the coolant salt, and leaves the reheater at a
temperature of 1000°F for delivery to the intermediate-pressure turbine.

Basically, the steam reheater exchangers must meet the same system
requirements prescribed for the primary heat exchangers that were dis-
cussed in Section 2 of this report. However, since no fuel salt is
involved, the desirability of keeping the fluid volume at a minimum is
not a critical factor in the design of the reheater. In addition, the
lower heat load and average temperatures permit more freedom in designing
the geometry of the reheater to avoid problems associated with vibration
or overstress.

Since the design for the steam reheater exchanger is similar to
that for the primary heat exchanger, an early version of the basic PRIMEX
computer program was modified to fit the requirements of the steam
reheater, thereby becoming the RETEX program. The design data and equa-
tions used to develop the RETEX computer program are discussed in the

following subsections.
20

3.1 Description of Steam Reheater

Each of the eight steam reheater exchangers is a horizontal shell-
and-tube unit with a single counterflow pass on both the shell and tube
sides.

22 in.

Each unit is about 30 ft long and has an outside diameter of
A typical reheater is illustrated in Fig. 3.1.

The preheated exhaust steam enters the tube side of the reheater at
a pressure of about 580 psi, flows through the 0.75-in.-OD tubes, and
exits at a pressure of 550 psi. There are 400 straight tubes arranged
in a triangular-pitch array in each reheater. The surfaces of these
tubes are not helically indented to enhance heat transfer, as are those
in the primary heat exchanger.

The coolant salt enters the shell side of the reheater at a pressure
of about 228 psi, flows around disk and doughnut baffles in counterflow
to the exhaust steam, and exits at a pressure of 168 psi. Other perti-

nent design data for the steam reheater exchanger are given in Table 3.1.

3.2 Design Calculations

When developing the computer program RETEX to analyze the steam
reheater exchanger, the properties of the steam were assumed to be essen-
tially constant along the length of the exchanger even though it was
recognized that some gain in the reliability of the estimates could have
been realized by incorporating the steam properties as a function of
pressure and temperature. The usual Dittus-Boelter equations were used
for the film heat transfer coefficient on the tube side of the exchanger.
The other procedures and correlations used in the analysis of the reheater
are basically the same as those used for the primary heat exchanger dis-
cussed in Subsection 2.2 of this report.

Manual computational methods were used to determine the stresses
in the steam reheater exchanger. This preliminary stress analysis was
based on the requirements of Section III, Nuclear Vessels, of the ASME
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code; and the calculated values are compared
with the allowable values in Table 3.1. However, a complete stress
analysis as required by Section III of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Ves-

sel Code has not been made.

3.3 Description of RETEX

The RETEX program, a modified version of the PRIMEX program, was
used to analyze the steam reheater exchanger. In the RETEX program, each
zone between two baffles is considered as one increment length. The cal-
culations are begun on the hot side of the exchanger, and increments are
added until a complete heat balance is achieved. The physical property
equations for the fuel salt in the PRIMEX program are replaced with the
physical property data for the exhaust steam in the RETEX program, and
these properties are considered as being essentially constant along the
length of the exchanger. The physical properties of the coolant salt are
evaluated at the average temperature of each increment. The dependence:

of the physical properties on temperature is presently expressed in the
24

form of empirical equations incorporated in the main program. If any of

these equations are changed, the appropriate data card must be replaced.

The RETEX computer program differs from the PRIMEX computer program
in that
1. the reheater tubes are not helically indented to enhance heat trans-

fer, and no enhancement factors are used in the RETEX program;

2. the reheater tubes are arranged in a triangular-pitch array rather
than in concentric circles, and certain geometric calculations are
therefore made differently in the RETEX program;

3. none of the reheater tubes are bent in a sine-wave configuration to
accommodate differential thermal expansion; and

4. no stress analysis subroutines are included in the RETEX program
(stresses were calculated by hand).

The computer program for the MSBR steam reheater exchanger, RETEX,
is given in Appendix C. A simplified outline of the program in block-
diagram form, a list of the input data required, a list of the output
received from the computer, and a complete listing of the main program
are presented. The RETEX program terms which differ from those of the
PRIMEX program are defined. To illustrate the use of the RETEX program,
the computer input data for the steam reheater exchanger discussed in
Subsection 3.1 and the output printed by the computer are also included
in Appendix C. The time required for a typical IBM 360/91 computer run

of this program is about 1 minute.

3.4 Evaluation of RETEX

Confidence in the design calculations for the steam reheater
exchanger is greater than that in the calculations for the primary heat
exchanger because the characteristics of steam are more familiar than
those of the fuel salt and because no enhancement factors are involved.
Vibration problems are not likely to be encountered in the steam reheater
because velocities are less than 6.5 fps and the tubes are supported by

baffles with a relatively close spacing.
25

The uncertainties associated with the coolant salt are involved in
the RETEX program, and the deviations applied for the primary heat
exchanger (discussed in Subsection 2.4) are also applicable to the steam
reheater. Again, two extreme cases were considered. All the pessimistic
values were used in one case, and all the optimistic values were used in
the other. The result was a maximum estimated deviation in the overall
heat transfer area of +23% (additional area required) for the pessimistic

case and -13% (less area required) for the optimistic case.

4. SUPEX, THE STEAM GENERATOR SUPERHEATER PROGRAM

There are four steam generator superheater exchangers, which transfer
heat from the coolant salt to feedwater, in each of the four coolant salt
circulating loops of the MSBR concept. The total steam generation require-
ment, which includes that needed for the feedwater and preheating the
exhaust steam, of about 10 X 10% 1b/hr is provided by the 16 steam gener-
ators, each having a thermal capacity of about 121 MW.

These exchangers serve as both steam generators and superheaters.
They are operated in parallel with respect to the coolant salt and steam
flows, and they are identical in design and operation. At full design
load, preheated feedwater enters the exchanger at a temperature of 700°F,
and the supercritical steam exits at a temperature of 1000°F. The cool-
ant salt enters the exchanger at a temperature of 1150°F and exits at a
temperature of 850°F for return to the primary heat exchanger.

The factors influencing the design of the steam generator exchanger
are partially dependent upon the requirements for the overall MSBR system.
The exit temperature and pressure of the steam were dictated by the steam
power system selected. The inlet temperature of the steam was determined
by considerations relative to the liquidus temperature of the salt and
the rapid increase in heat capacity of the supercritical water at temper-
atures above 700°F. The inlet and exit temperatures of the coolant salt,
the pressure drop, and the total heat to be transferred were dictated by
the requirements for the reactor and primary heat exchange systems. In
addition to these system requirements, the design for the steam generator
exchanger must satisfy stress, stability, and space requirements.

Because of the marked changes in the physical properties of the feed-
water as the temperature is raised above the critical temperature at
supercritical pressures, the heat transfer and flow characteristics vary
considerably throughout the exchanger. The SUPEX computer program was
developed to account for these changes by making the heat transfer and
pressure drop calculations for incremental tube lengths. The design data
and equations used to develop this computer program for analysis of the

steam generator exchanger are discussed in the following subsections.
27

4.1 Description of Steam Generator

Each of the 16 steam generator superheater exchangers is a U-tube,
U-shell unit mounted horizontally with one leg above the other. Each has
a single pass on the shell and tube sides with the flow in one side coun-
ter to that in the other. The overall length of each exchanger is about
40 ft, and the overall height from the feedwater inlet plenum to the

steam outlet plenum is about 12 ft. A typical steam generator is shown

in Fig. 4.1.

The feedwater enters the tube side of the exchanger at a pressure
of 3754 psi, flows through the 0.50-in.-0D tubes, and the supercritical
steam exits at a pressure of 3600 psi. . The coolant salt enters the shell
side of the exchanger at a pressure of 233 psi, circulates in counterflow
to the supercritical fluid around segmental baffles, and exits at a pres-
sure of 172 psi. Segmental baffles are used to improve the heat transfer
coefficient for the salt film and to minimize salt stratification. A
baffle on the shell side of each tube sheet provides a stagnant layer of
salt to help reduce stresses resulting from temperature gradients across
the tube sheets.

Location of the steam generator exchanger in a horizontal position
reduces the possibility of unstable flow conditions for the supercritical
fluid in the tubes. The U-tubes are arranged in a triangular-pitch array
and the ends of the tubes are turned 90° to equalize the lengths of the
tubes in the exchanger. This equalization of tube lengths further
reduces the possibility of unstable flow conditions. The pertinent

design data for the steam generator exchanger are given in Table 4.1.

for the cross-flow and window regions weighted by the amount of heat
transfer surface in each region and corrected for bypass leakage.

Because of the large baffle-spacing-to-shell-diameter ratio (approximately

factor is applied to the shell-side heat transfer coefficient. The total

Detailed stress calculations are not included in the SUPEX computer
program, but an approximate value of the allowable temperature drop across
the tube wall based on thermal stress considerations is determined for
each increment of tube length. This value of allowable temperature drop
can be compared with the value of the temperature drop across the tube
wall determined in the heat transfer calculations to provide some guid-
ance in selecting design parameters. The thermal stresses are treated
as secondary stresses. Based on the requirements set forth in Section

4.3 Description of SUPEX

 

The equations described in Subsection 4.2 are used in the SUPEX pro-
gram to size the steam generator exchanger for the specified input data.
A flow diagram of the SUPEX program, a list of the input required, and a

list of the output received from the computer are given in Appendix D.
38

In the SUPEX program, the total heat to be transferred in the
exchanger is divided into a specified number of equal increments. For
each increment, heat balance relations for the coolant salt and the
supercritical fluid and the heat transfer equations are used to determine
the change of temperature for each stream and the tube length required.
The pressure drop in the supercritical fluid for each increment and the
pressure drop in the coolant salt for each baffle space are calulated
and summed.

Two major iteration loops are contained in the SUPEX program.

First, the baffle spacing is assumed and iterations are made until the
total calculated shell-side pressure drop agrees with that specified.
Internal to this loop, the number of tubes in the exchanger is estimated,
and iterations are made to give the total tube-side pressure drop speci-
fied. A simplified flow diagram of the SUPEX program, a complete list-
ing of the program, and a list of terms used in the program are given in
Appendix D.

Output from the program includes the number of tubes, inside diam-
eter of the shell, length of the exchanger, baffle spacing, number of
baffles, total heat transfer area, and the apparent overall heat transfer
coefficient. The method of calculation used in the program permits the
total length of the tubes to differ from the total length of the baffle
space by a fraction of the baffle spacing. Both lengths are given in
the output, as are the heat transfer area and apparent heat transfer
coefficient for each length. The output also includes pertinent informa-
tion for each baffle spacing and tube increment.

To illustrate the use of the SUPEX program, the computer input data
for the MSBR steam generator superheater exchanger described in Subsec-
tion 4.1 and the output data printed by the computer are included in
Appendix D. The time required for a typical IBM 360/91 computer run of

this program is about 30 seconds.
39

4.4 Evaluation of SUPEX

The problem of stability in the steam generator superheater was
considered. As indicated by K. Goldman et al.1® and by L. S. Tong, ®
instabilities in steam generators can arise from two sources. First, a
true thermodynamic instability can exist where, for a given pressure drop
across the tube, the flow rate through the tube may be changed from one
steady-state value to another by a finite disturbance. Second, a system
instability that is caused by resonant conditions in the fluid can exist.
Data related to the first type of instability have been reported by L. Y.
Krasyakova and B. N. Glusker,2° and data related to the second type of
instability have been reported by E. R. Quandt®* and by L. M. Shotkin.®Z
A qualitative evaluation of these data indicates that the mass flow rate,
pressure drop, and heat flux used in the horizontal U-tube and U-shell
design will result in stable operation. Operation of a test module will
provide further information about the stability of this design concept.

An analysis was made to evaluate the various uncertainties involved
in the SUPEX computer program. Tolerances were placed on the physical
properties of the coolant salt, the heat transfer coefficients, and on
the pressure-drop correlation. The program was run for various cases to
determine the quantitative values of the favorable and the adverse effects
of the uncertainties. The favorable effects were defined as decreased
heat transfer area, decreased shell diameter, and decreased total tube
length. The adverse effects were defined as increased values for these
same three parameters. The selection of these parameters was based on
the belief that the heat transfer area is indicative of the total cost of
the exchanger, the diameter of the shell is indicative of the stress prob-
lem, and the total length of the tubes is indicative of the physical size
of the exchanger.

The range of uncertainties studied included the physical properties
of the coolant salt with a deviation of 12% for the specific heat and
density and a deviation of +10% for the viscosity and thermal conductivity,
the tube-side and shell-side heat transfer coefficients with a deviation

of + 20%, and the pressure-drop correlation with a deviation of +10%.
40

Scrutiny of the shell-side heat transfer coefficient revealed that
positive deviations (increases) in the specific heat and thermal conduc-
tivity of the coolant salt and negative deviations (decreases) in the
density and viscosity of the salt will produce favorable effects, while
opposite deviations will produce adverse effects. A negative deviation
(decrease) in the calculated pressure drop will produce favorable effects,
while a positive deviation (increase) will produce adverse effects.

The results of this analysis in terms of percentage changes relative
to the design case are given in Table 4.3. Case 1 is for an increased
specific heat and density of the coolant salt and a decreased viscosity
and thermal conductivity. Case 2 is for deviations opposite to those of
Case 1. Cases 3 and 4 are for increased and decreased, respectively,
shell-side heat transfer coefficients; Cases 5 and 6 are for increased
and decreased, respectively, tube-side heat transfer coefficients; and
Cases 7 and 8 are for decreased and increased, respectively, calculated
pressure drops. Case 9 for overall favorable conditions is for the com-
bined effect of all favorable changes, and Case 10 for overall adverse
conditions is for all adverse changes. Cases 1, 3, 5, and 7 represent

favorable changes; while Cases 2, 4, 6, and 8 represent adverse changes.

THE RETEX PROGRAM

The RETEX computer program is outlined in block-diagram form in
Fig. C.1. The input data required for the program are given in Table
C.1, and the output received from the program are given in Table C.2.
A complete listing of the main program is followed by definitions of
the intermediate variables used in the program. To illustrate the use
of the RETEX program, the input and output for the MSBR steam reheater
exchanger discussed in Subsection 3.1 of this report are presented as

printed by the computer.

Appendix D

THE SUPEX PROGRAM

The SUPEX computer program is outlined in block-diagram form in
Fig. D.1. The input data required for the program are given in Table
D.1, and the output received from the computer are given in Table D.2.
A complete listing of the main program and its subroutines is followed
by definitions of the intermediate variables used in the program and the
subroutines and their purposes. To illustrate the use of the SUPEX pro-
gram, computer print-outs of the input for the MSBR steam generator super-
heater exchanger discussed in Subsection 4.1 and the output of the SUPEX

program are presented.
