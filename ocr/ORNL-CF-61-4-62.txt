Summary
' This report is a compilation of the results of reactor physics 4
calculations to date for the currently proposed MSRE core design. Gr

The core vas assumed to consist of a homogeneous mixture of fuel
galt and graphite, with 22.5 per cent of the core volume occupied

by fuel; the salt composition was the currently proposed mixture

of T0 mole per cent LiF, 23 mole per cent BeF,, ‘5 mole per cent
ZrF), 1 mole per cent ThF),, end UF) as requirsd for criticality.

‘The calculated critical mole per cent, assuming 93.5 per cent U-235,

is 0.2 mole per cent UF); the assoclated inventory of U-235 in the
circulating system is L log 5. Mean core thermal flux is
estimated to be 2.9 x 103 n/em sec.with an associated mean power
density of 3.9 vatts/cm3 for 10 megawatts total reactor power.

~~ MSRE FRELIMINARY PHYSICS REPORT

C. W. Nestor, Jre

Introduction Co

The purposes of this report are to assemble the results of the reactor
physics calculations which have been done concerning the currently proposed
MSRE core design, and to point out the areas in which further work needs to -
be done. Estimates have been made of the reactor characteristics using the
core model and calculation methods discussed in Reactor Model and Calculation
Methods; these results are presented in Teble 1 and discussed in Results.
Consideration is given to the problems of fission product buildup, fuel salt
and Xe-135 retention by the core graphite, and distortion of the core graphite

under irradietion in Long-term Reactor Behavior. It should be emphasized that
in some cases these results depend upon very scanty experimental data buttressed

by many assumptions end that much more work remains to be done in this partic-
ular area.’ _

Reactor Model end Calculation Methods

For the criticality calculations the reactor was assumed to be & bare

right circular cylinder 27.7 inches in radius and 63 inches high; a radial ex-

trepolation distance of 1 inch was sdded to simulate the effect of the fuel
enmuilus end -INOR-8 vessel, and an axial extrepoletion distance of 3.5 inches

~~ was edded to both ends to similate the fuel salt contained in upper and lower
~~ heads of the vesgel. The IEM-TO4 multigroup one-dimensionsl diffusion theory

program GNU-IX 1) wes used for the calculations with the 34-group cross section
library prepared for use in the thorium reactor eveluation progrem.“ The core
was assumed to be a homogeneous mixture of T7.5 volume per cent graphite (density

1.90 gn em®) and 22.5 volume per cent fuel salt, using the currently proposed
‘mixtures of 70 mole per cent LiF (99.997% 1i7), 23 mole per cent BeFz, 5 mole

per cent 2rFg, 1 mole per cent ThFy and ~ 1 mole per cent UF4 (as required for
criticality). The external circulating system volume was assumed to be Lo £2,
which gave a ratio of total circulating system fuel volume to core fuel volume
of 3.0.. The temperature and concentration coefficients of reactivity were esti-
mated from the output of the criticality search section of the GNU progrem, as :
previously described.® Co oo Co

Two-dimensional tyo-group flux caléulations were done using the TEM-T090
progrem Equipoise-II (0 to obtain estimates of the power generated in the upper

and lower heads of the vessel and in the fuel annulus surrounding the core.

This program was also used in the estimation of the effects of graphite dis-

tortion on reactivity (see Long-term Reactor Behavior). Two=-group constants

were obtained from the output of the GNU program,

The principal results are tabulated in Teble 1.

Long-Term Reactor Behavior

In the currently proposed MSRE core the fuel selt is in contact with the
graphite moderator and some penetration of the graphite by gaseous fission
products and by fuel salt will certainly occur. It is, however, extremely
unclear at this time what the amounts of these penetrations will be, since
there 1s no experimental date concerning the behavior of fuel selt, and
fission products in contact with the proposed MSRE grephite. In addition,
gaseous fission products will be stripped from the salt in the pump bowl by
& helium sparge when the reactor is operating at power. Any calculation deal=
ing with the effects of fuel and fission product retention is therefore based
on assumptions of unknown reliebility and should be regerded only &s an esti
mate of possible behavior. Using a particular set of assumptions concerning
fuel salt end fission produet behavior, efficiency of stripping in the pump
bowl and graphite properties, Spiewakb has celculated an equilibrium Xe=135
poison fraction (ratio of Xe-l35 stoms destroyed by neutron sbsorption to
fissions) of .0L8%; this represents a reactivity change (6k/k) of 1.3% and
this value is quoted in Teble 1. If all the fuel and Xe=135 were fixed in
the core, the associated reactivity would be 4%; there is a relatively wide
range of values which may result from apparently equally reasonable assumptions.

Under long-term irradiation it 1s known that graphite will change its
dimensions. Since no irradiation experiments have been done with the proposed
MSRE graphite, the situation with regard to long-term reactivity changes is 7
unclear. Using the results of calculations of graphite distortion by Kinyon,
it 1s estimated that the combined effects of graphite distortion end fission
product buildup will amount to a reactivity decrease of 3.8% in ome full power
year's operation. These calculations were based on a single short-term experi-
nent on a similar grade of graphite, not exposed to fuel salt; this result
should therefore be regarded as only en estimate of possible behavior.
