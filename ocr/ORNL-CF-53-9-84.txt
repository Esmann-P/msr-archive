PREFACE

The program which has evolved at the Oak Ridge School of
Reactor Technology consists of two semesters of formal course instruc-
tion, followed by ten weeks given to reactor design studles. These
studies provide each student an opportunity of applying to a specific
but representative problem the principles and technology which the
school attempts to impart, Individual student groups are chosen so as
to include men of the various engineering professions and scientific
fields in much the same pattern found in a typical reactor project.

This report is based on the study made by its authors while
they were students in the 1952-53 session of ORSORT. It was made and
the report prepared ln ten weeks. Obviously those weeks were diligently
spent, Even so it would be unreasonable to expect that the study
reported here is either definitive or free of defect in judgement. The
faculty and many, perhaps all of the students are convinced that the
project well served its pedagogical purpose. The report is published
for the value it has to those who are professionally engaged in the field,

Ag the authors have noted, several members of the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory gave generously of their time and knowledge. The
faculty Joins with the authors in appreciation of that help. Most
particularly is acknowledged the advice and inspiration which the group

received from ite consultant, BE. R. Mam.

I INTRODUCTION
The objective of this project was to apply the theoretical
information presented at ORSORT to the design of a reflector-
moderated, circulating fuel, aircraft reactor.
The scope of the investigation was limited primarily to
an analytical evaluation, although a minor flow experiment was
performed
This design study has been limited to the reactor; the

propulsion system has not been considered.

 
IT SUMMARY

A preliminary feasibility study of a 200 MW reflector moderated,
circulating fuel, aircraft reactor is presented. The Screwball ™ core
configuration as presently conceived consists of:

1) A spherical shell beryllium reflector

2) ARE type fluoride fuel in helical tubes arranged in

annular form

3) NaOD moderator and reflector coolant

In an attempt to justify the use of fuel tubes, an experimental
investigation of the flow in a model helical tube was conducted.

The reactor analysis was conducted on a two group, three region
basis. The nuclear cross sections were appropriately weighted and
judiciously applied so that the results compared favorably with the
multi-group machine calculations.

The reactor presented is believed to be conservative and appears
to be feasible. The fundamental limitation is the 1250°F maximum wall
temperature to: prevent excessive NaOD corrosion. Large NaCD flow rates
and ample flow guidance are required to minimize corrosion. If the
corrosion limit can be raised, the use of NaOD as moderator and
coolant has greater potential.

Helical fuel tubes ars recommended to reduce the uncertainties
of unstable flow in high power=density reactors. The engineering

complexities introduced by their use are justified for controlled flow,

 

® The reactor described in this report will be called the "Screwball"
(the Fireball with a new twist). ws

 
IIT GENERAL PLANT DESIGN
3.1 General Description

The Serewball is a spherical, reflector moderated, circulating
fuel reactor. The fuel enters the core at the north pole and flows
downward through six 3.5 inch 1.D. inconel tubes. Five of these tubes
are wrapped in a variable pitch helix to form a spherical annulus of
fuel and the sixth tube passes through the center of the sphere forming
a helix of smaller diameter, See Figures 1 and 2. In returning the
fuel flows over NaX cooled tubes in the primary heat exchanger which is
wrapped in a spherical annulus surrounding the beryllium reflector,

The beryllium reflector has the form of a spherical shell with holes at
the north and south poles for entry of the fuel tubes. Sodium deuteroxide
flows downward through the spherical cavity in the beryllium and surrounds
the fuel tubes, hence functioning as a moderator "island". The NaOD
returns to the top through 0.23 inch diameter holes drilled in the
reflector and through a spherical cavity outside the reflector thereby
removing the heat produced in the reflector, The NalOD then passes through
g heat exchanger and is pumped back through the core.

The intermediate heat transfer medium, NaK, returning from the
propulsion system passes through the sodium deuteroxide heat exchanger
and then through the primary heat exchanger. This system uses only one
intermediate heat transfer medium and eliminates the necessity of
additional radiators for subecooling a portion of the NaK as proposed for
the Fireball. However, a control system is required which will keep the
return NeX temperature constant. If the temperature rises, the NaOD will

be insufficiently cooled and excessive corrosion may result, At return

temperatures below 200°F,, the fuel will freeze in the primary heat
exchanger, With its inherent simplicity, the use of a single transfer
medium warrants further investigation. Figure 1 is a drawing of the
Screwball system, and a tabulation of design data is contained in the
Appendix 1,
3.2 Design Philosophy

A brief survey of NEPA, ANP, H, K. Ferguson, and Technical Advisory
Board reports indicated that homogeneous reactors held the greatest
potential for efficient nuclear propelled flight. Since little information
is available on a combined hydroxide of lithium and sodium (the most obvious
candidate for a high temperature homogeneous reactor fuel) the circulating
fuel type reactor was chosen as an intermediate step between fixed fuel
elements and the homogeneous type fuel. The large heal transfer surface
required in fixed fuel reactors is removed from the core in circulating
fuel reactors and the potential simplicity of homogeneous reactors is
retained. The moderating properties of the uranium bearing, fused salts
are generally poor, but employing thick, efficient reflectors enables the
construction of a small high power reactor.

Having chosen a reflector moderated, circulating fuel type reactor,
a more detailed investigation was initiated on the Fireball as described in
Reference 2, Investigation of the Fireball design parameters yielded the
following five problems which appeared to warrant basic design changes or
modifications:

1. High power density
2, Questionable fuel flow patterns

3. Possibility of pressure surges

=12=
L. Cooling the Be "island"
5. Self-shielding in the fuel

The Screwball eliminates or reduces the magnitude of each of
these problems except pressure surges. To achieve these ends compromises
in simplicity and reactor size have been medes however, the increase in
shield weight over the 22.5 inch core is less than 10%. It is believed
that this reactor has a real potential for aircraft application, and as
such warrants further investigation.

The controllability of a high power density reactor has been neither
proven nor disproven. E. R, Mann states that controlling a reactor in which
the fuel temperature rise in the core exceeds 2000°F, per second will be
difficult and somewhat doubtful. To be more conservative, a power density
of 2.5 KM/ce (1070°F, per second) has been chosen for this reactor.

With such rapid increases in fuel temperature only short lived flow
instabilities or eddies can be tolerated in the fuel. The use of fuel
tubes in the Screwball has greatly reduced the uncertainty of sustained
instabilities in the fuel region. A brief gqualitive experiment varifying
stable flow through helical pipes is described in Section 6.3.

Pressure surges result from rapid density changes due to temperature
variations which occur in eddies of lengthy duration, or from the
instantaneous introduction of a cold slug of fuel. A step decrease in
temperature is difficult to visualize in a circulating fuel reactor,
Pressure surge calculations have been made on the Fireball assuming stagnant
fuel in the core and a step increase in k of 1% throughout the core.

These assumptions are both conservative since neither condition is likely to

occur in the reactor. Based on these assumptions the resulting pressure

~1%3w
surge is not expected to exceed 150 psi.. As a result of the more
tortuous expansion path oul of the core, pressure surges in the
Screwball are expected to be larger. However, the fuel tubes in the
Serewball will withstand pressures of 200 psi and no difficulty from
this phenomenon is anticipated.

The beryllium central "island" in the Fireball reactor requires
cooling to remove the heat generated by neutron moderation and gamma ray
attenuation. The density of heat generation is 100 to 200 watts/cc, and
its removal will require a large number of coolant tubes. The beryllium
hes been replaced in the Screwball by a circulating "island" of RNaOD,
However, the problem of NaOD corrosion has been introduced. As indicated
in Section 6.2.2, no stagnant or low velocity layers in NaOD can be
tolerated next to the hot fuel tubes or containing shell.

The self-shielding effect, as described in Section 5.2, for the
3.5 inch diameter tubes of the Serewball should be less severe than for

the spherical fuel annulus in the Fireball.

A
IV MATERIALS
4.1 Fuel

The proposed fuel for the Screwball is a fused salt containing
50 mole percent NaF, 47 mole percent Zr¥, , and 3 mole percent enriched
UF, . This fuel is similar to that proposed for the ARE and was chosen
because considerable information is available on its’
physical and chemical properties. To relax the limitation on the
temperature of the returning NaK (Section 3.1), a fuel with a lower melting
point would be desirable. Inconel will be used as the fuel containing
material.
4.2 Reflector

The reflector has two functions; moderation and shielding. Be is
a good moderator. Its moderating ratio is 159 compared to 170 for carbon,
In addition, it serves as an excellent shield due to its high atomic
density and small age. The fast neutron leakage for a given reflector
thickness is much smaller for beryllium than for substances. such as NaOD,
BeC, graphite and BeO aggregate. (Reference 2, Figure 7). Hence,
beryllium has been chosen for the Screwball reflector.
4.3 Moderator

A fluid moderator with a low vapor pressure at elevated temperature
wag desired, Thelr high wapor pressures eliminated the possibility of
using light or heavy water. Hydroxides were then considered,

The diffusion length of a hydroxide is very small relative to its
age. Hence, a hydroxide in the core of the Serewball would serve ss a
sink for fast neutrons rather than as a moderator, Deuteroxides do not

have this undesirable nuclear property and should exhibit similar physical

=} 5=~
and corrosive properties. Therefore, 1Li0D , NaOD and combinations of
both were considered. The double isotopic separation eliminated LiOD
from serious considerationy NaOD was chosen for the core moderator.
NaOD also serves as the coolant for the reflector. It is a better
moderator than sodium (the proposed Fireball reflector coolant) so that
the Screwball reflector should be a more effective shield. However, the
macroscopic cross section for thermal neutrons is larger for NeOD than for
sodium, The slight difference in absorption does not warrant cohsidering
the additional complexity of a separate sodium system for the Screwball.
BMI has made a survey of containing materials for NaOH at
elevated temperatures (Reference 23). Graphite, silver and nickel were
the most satisfactory of the materials tested. Nickel was chosen for the
Screwball on the basis of ease of cladding and electroplating and tolerable
neutron cross section. The corrosion mechanism of NaOH on nickel is
reported in Reference 4.

2 NaOH + Ni = NegNiOp H,
Nay0-Ni0

The reaction equilibrium is temperature sensitive resulting in
mass transfer of nickel from hot regions to adjacent colder surfaces,
The corrosion can be suppressed by hydrogen pressure over the NaOH,

The corrosion mechanism for NaOD is expected to be similar to
that for NaOH, but the degree and temperature dependance of the corrosion
are unknown, For this study, the temperature limitation for NaOB
corrosion of nickel is assumed the same as for NaOH,

According to Reference 3, corrosion of nickel by stagnant NaOH is,

“16
1) not néticable at 1000°F

2) small at 12509F and would be tolerable for
alreraft applications

3) excessive at 1500°F

A limiting wall temperature of 1250°F and a deuterium gas
pressure in the NaOD expansion tank of two to three atmospheres are
proposed for this reactor.

Lod Intermediate Heat Transfer Medium

A near eutectic alloy of sodium and potassium, 56 weight percent
Na and 44 weight percent K, has been chosen as the intermediate heat
transfer medium. As is typicel of liquid metals, this alloy has excellent
heat transfer properties and also has a low melting point (66°F), The
main disadvantage of NaK is the induced radiation resulting from neutron
bombardment in the primary heat exchanger.

4.5 Fabrication

The proposed methods for fabricating the primary heat exchanger,
pumps and beryllium reflector are the seme as those described in
Reference 2, Ni will be substituted for chromium in the reflector.

Bending the fuel tubes is possible (Reference 5), with the use
of a cermet internal mandrel.

The Na0OD heat exchanger is standard, welded shell and tube
constructien.

The entire system will be welded. Reference 6 states that welds
in nickel for 1000°F NaOH corrosion tests were made with no unusual
difficulty. Inconel welding presents no major complications.

The fabrication sequence has not been fully considered in the layout

of pigure 1. Modifications may be required to facilitate assembly of parts.

5,1 Crogss_Sections

The cross sections used for nuclear calculations in this report
are based on current ANP data.
5.2 Self-shielding

The application of diffusion theory in Reactor design, yields at
best only a reasonable approximetion of the nuclear characteristics of
homogeneous systems. The Screwball is a heterogeneous reactor which has
been homogenized for the purpose of expediting the nuclear calculations.
This fact makes it necessary to correct the diffusion eguations by introducing
a parameter commonly referred to as the self-shielding factor, F. This
factor accounts for the local depression of the neutron flux within the fuel
region, which in turn results in decreased thermal utilization of the fuel
Two major disadvantages result from self-shielding. First, more fuel is
required than for a homogeneous reactor of the same proportions: and
second, the negative temperature coefficient is not as large. As seen in
Figure 3, a smaller change in kg pp results from the removal of an equal
mass of uranium for a reactor with a greater uranium investment.

Figure 4 depicts estimated values of F vs. fuel tube diameter at
various reactor operating temperatures, The calculations were based on
the method set forth in Reference 7. To apply the method one must know
Z, and Z, of each constituent, the atomic densities in the fuel tube and
its diameter, and the variation of f with 2RZy as shown in Figures 5.

From these data calculate,

as a function of lethargy, which is then used as a multiplying constant
on the macroscopic cross section of uranium.

The self-shielding factors which were incorporated in the Screwball
configuration were Fo .. = 0.8, and Fip = 0.5. It is believed that these
figures resulted in a conservative value for the critical mass.

5.3 One Group, Two Region, Criticality Calculation

As a basis for advanced engineering and nuclear calculations, an
estimate of the Screwball critical mass was necessary. For this purpose a
one group, two reglon calculation was made of the proposed configuration.

The general method of calculation is discussed in Reference 8,

The effective reflector thickness was computed for ANP Reactor
121 for which the critical mass had been calculated by the 32 group IBM
technique. Assuming the same effective reflector thickness, the critical

mass was detgrmined for the proposed Screwball,

“22.
For the purpose of cross section weighting both reactors were
assumed 50% fast and the fast fraction to be equally distributed among
the lethargy groups. A selif-ghielding factor of 0.7 was spplied to the
resulting one group cross section. Thermal base 92 was used. Dats used
in the calculation are contained in Appendix 2.

A critical mass of 36.4 pounds was obtained for an effective
reflector thickness of 4.04 cm. This corresponds to 3.05 mole percent

UF), in the fusl.

5.4 Two Group, Three Region Calculation

 

The problem of calculating the critical mass and flux distribution
of intermediate reactors is more difficult than for thermsl reactors, The
ong group approximation is unsatisfactory because of the wide variation in
epithermal cross sections, Furthermore, the comperatively small size of
intermediate reactors increases the importance of the reflector. This
fact holds particularly in connection with reflector moderated reactors as
exemplified by the Fireball and the Screwball, In these reactors the
nuclear characteristics are strongly influenced by reflector composition
and its thickness,

Because of the uncertainties in cross sections in the intermediate
enargy range, it is nol anticipated that calculations will lead to accurate
prediction regarding the critical mass and flux distributions. It appears
that these calculations will at best be a ressonsble approximation of the
nuclear characteristics of the reactor. In order to conduct the reactor

analysis expeditiously, the two groups, three region method was used.

The approximation of the Screwball used for miclear calculation
is schematically depicted in Figure 6. Ry is the radius of the inner
sphere (1), with Rp and R3 representing the radii of spherical shells

Eight equations with eight unknowns result from applying
the remaining boundary conditions. A non-trivial solution for
these equations is obtained if the coefficients of the determinant
(Figure 14) vanish; this then establishes the critical equation.

The two group calculation method requires accurate and
judicious application of nuclear cross sections. Thermal base 92
values were used for determining thermal group cross sections and
an average over lethargy groups 1 through 26 for the fast group.
bre vs. r curves were plotted for ANP reactor 129 and normalized
area fractions (Appendix 3) determined for each lethargy group and
region. These areas are proportional to the fraction of neutrons
in each group. The same neutron versus lethargy distribution was
assumed for the proposed Screwball reactor,

It is possible to solve the criticality determinant after
calculating the nuclear constants (L, D, and £ ) from the specified
dimensions and material constituents for each region. The critical mass
is obtained by iteration and is that uranium mass which results in the
zero value of the determinant. The method for solving the determinant
is presented in Reference 9,

To check the validity of the method of analysis, a calculation
was conducted on the Fireball Beactor 129; dts eritical mass as
determined by a 32 group IBM calculation was 23 pounds of 7235, The two
group three region calculation of reactor 129 predicted 23.4 pounds of
UR35, This indicated excellent correlation between analytical methods

and choice of cross sections,

eb1ee # Supmeg
The value of the determinant varies radically with small change
in uranium mass, The determinent for the Screwball was zero for two
agssuned uranium masses, 34.8 pounds and 49 pounds. The curve of
determinant value versus uranium mass “is similar to reactor 129 for
messes around 34.8 pounds, Hence, the mass of thé screwball is
approximately 34.8 pounds of 73%, Thiz results in the following
fluoride fuel composition:

2.9 mole percent Ur,
47.1 mole percent Zr¥y
50.0 mole percent NaF

Several efforts to calculate the spatial distribution of the flux
yielded results of questionable validity. Very small changes in the nuclear
constants produce major changes in the flux distribution. With such a
sensitive relationship no significant conclusions have been obtained.

Based on the results of the ANP 32 group caleulations, it is
anticipated that the Screwball will be approximately 50 percent thermal.

If so, the flux level required to produce . 200 MW ie 1039 neutrons per square
centimeter per second,
5.5 Temperature Coefficient of Reactivity

The Screwball has heen conceived for possible use in aircraft
applications. It is therefore important that its control system be as
simple as possible. Since the use of control rods is not anticipated
and the delayed neutron contributions to the flux are attenuated when
the fuel is circulating, the control of this reactor can be assumed to be

satisfactory only if it is provided with a strong negative temperature

3]
coefficient of reactivity. This coefficient is a function of numerous
nuclear and physical parameters, a few of the more important ones being:

(1) liquid fuel expansion

(2) fuel tube wall expansion

(3) Doppler effect in fuel

(4) moderator expansion

(5) thermal base changes with temperature

There are several reasons why kore is temperature dependent,
the most important one being the thermal expansion of the core materials.
This effect usually results in reactivity decreases with temperature
increase. If the over-all temperature coefficient is positive, the
continuous increase in temperature relegates the reactor to a short
nonuseful life. The reactor then contains a built-in suicide complex.
A negative coefficient is obtained from the thermal expansion of the fuel
and its loss from the active volume. Moderator expansion, resulting in
increased neutron leakage, is also a large contributor toward a negative
coefficient. The Doppler broadening, which for enriched fuel could
provide a positive component of the temperature coefficient, has not been
considered in this report. In this connection, it is believed that
addition of 238 v0 the enriched fuel may possibly cancel or overcome the
Doppler effect; the price is a greater fuel investment.
The calculations were conducted on the basis of a two group

thermal reactor. Although the Screwball has been estimated to be 50
percent thermal, it is belleved thal a reasonable estimate of the
temperature coefficient was obtained, It was also assumed that the product
of the resonance escape probability and the fast fission factor rere equal
to unity.

The effective multiplication factor based on two group,
thermal reactor theory is:

eff

This steady state equation is temperature dependent as a result
of temperature variation of core geometry, material densities and energy
distribution of the neutrons. The fractional change in kore which
accompanies a unit temperature rise is the temperature coefficient of
reactivity. This quantity must be negative for stable reactor operation;
it is obtained by taking the logarithmic derivative of the above equation

“8T ST ) moderator
The ration of the moderator to fuel coefficient is two to one.
This ratic has important bearing on the kinetic behavior of the reactor
because of the relationship between the temperature response time
constants for fuel and moderator regions. For the Screwball these time
constants are approximately 1.3 and 9 seconds for the fuel and moderator

respectively; the ratio of moderator to fuel constants is: approximately

I
seven, The combination of the above ratios becomes most important
when the power increases unless the mean moderator temperature is kept
constant the fuel may freeze. The explanation of this phenomenon is as
followse an increased moderator temperature reduces the reactivity and
causes the fuel temperature to decrease since its negative temperature
coefficient compensates for this reduction in reactivity and maintains
the reactor critical. Since the reactor is without servo=type control rods,
it may be possible to forestall this possibility by maintaining a constant
mean moderator temperature.
5.6 Fission Product Handling

The two major fission products which absorb neutrons
parasitically ere Xe13% and Sal49. mn important advantage of circulating
fuel reactors is the possibility of continuously purging Xe and other
fission product gases from the system, thereby appreciably reducing the
fuel inventory required. Reference 22 proposes bypassing a fraction of
the primary fuel stream through a turbo-diffuser unit in which the Xe 1s
purged with helium. It has been estimated that for an assumed equilibrium
Xe concentration condition of oe = 0.3% , about 6 percent of the
primary flow must be continuously passed through the separator.
Additional fuel will be added “0 account for the reduction of k pp
due to absorption by the equilibrium Xe. Samarium poisoning under

equilibrium conditions is expected to have 2 8k _ 4 64 . Fuel will

»

have to be added to take care of the equilibrium Sm absorption.

=~
5.7 Excess Fuel Requirements
In accordance with Reference 2, the change in uranium mass
required for a given change in kgrp (for ANP circulating fluoride fuel

reactors is given by the relation:

.
A Co 0.22

It was estimated that a kgpe of 1.021 will be required if the

reactor is to operate at 100 MW for 100 hours. Background information

for calculating this figure was obtszined from various ANP, ARE and HEF

reports. A breakdown of the component k pp is:

Critical 1.000
Equilibrium Xe override 0.003
Equilibrium Sm override 0.006
Fuel depletion 0.006
Excess for delayed nsutron attenuation 0,005

Excess for instrumentation in the reflector 0,001

kope = 1,021

The excess reactivity required is obtained by increasing the
critical mass by 3.3 pounds: of this, approximately one pound will be
used to shim the system during operation.

5.8 Kipetics

The question of inherent stability is extremely important with
high powered, mobile, circulating fuel reactors. Since high power at
high thermodynamic efficiency is required, a reactor temperature approach-

ing the upper permissible limit is desirable. The extremely rapid power

“35a
fluctuation possible in reactors of high power density deems manual or
even servo-type control impractical, As a result control rods for use
during normal reactor operation were not considered feasible.

The transit time of the fuel through the reactor is a fraction
of a second. As a result, the delayed neutron contributions to the flux
are attenuated when the fuel is circulated. Normally, the delayed neutrons
play an important role in conventional reactors; their attenuation raises
a legitimate vorry regarding the stability of the Screwball.

There are two aspects to inherent stability, (1) static, which
means that an increase in reactor temperature causes the reactivity to
decrease, and (2), dynamic, which means that the oscillations in reactor
power are inherently damped. As indicated under Section 5.5 the Screwball
has been calculated to have a strong negative temperature coefficient.

Current data and theoretical studies indicate that the rapid
circulation of the fuel itself provides a powerful damping factor for power
oscillations with periods comparable to the transit time of the fuel
through the reactor. This damping factor is presumed to compensate for
the delayed neutron attermvation. Evidence supporting this statement

4s ‘et forth under References 10, 11, and 123 it 18 indicated that the
circulating fuel reactor equation (without reliance on delayed neutrons or
control rods; has no antidamped solutions for the following, not entirely
realistic conditions:
(1) constant power extraction
(2) large temperature and power excursions where the
steady state power is four times design power for

all times

~36-
(3) sudden positive excursions of the power to
ten times design power,
It would seem that a properly designed circulating fuel reactor is no worse
with respect to damping oscillations than one in which none of the delayed
neutrons are attenuated.
5.9 Controls

The underlying control philosophy for this reactor is the
"master-slave relationship, where the power plant is the master and the
reactor the slave, In other words, the power extracted from the reactor
is determined solely by the demand of the propulsion system.

The Screwball control system is basically dependent upon its
large negative fuel temperature cbefficient., As stated in Section 5.7,
shim control is obtained by addition of enriched fuel; a possible basic
scheme to accomplish this is set forth in Reference 13, There are not
expected to be control rods in the reactor fuel and moderator regions,
Consideration should be given to the possibility of a variable bypass on
the Xe separator to provide fine adjustments in reactivity between batch
additions of enriched fuel.

An important advantage of the circulating fuel reactor powerplant
combination, is that preliminary analysis of controlability of a loosely
coupled system can be predicted for each separate component. Reactor and
engine stability problems can, therefore, be attacked independently since
surges in either component are admitted to the other after considerable
delay. 4s indicated in Reference 14, it appears that the master-slave idea

can probably be satisfactorily reduced to practice.

wf
5.10 Start Up

A possible procedure for starting the reactor is as follows:

(1) Heat the fluorides, to a mean temperature of 1300°F in an
external system and add the enriched fuel.

(2) Using an external heat source, heat the NaK and NaOD.

(3) Bring the fuel, at correct concentration, to 15000F,

(4) Install a strong polonium-beryllium source in the reflector
(perhaps by mixing molten polonium with the beryllium in a separate
reflector tube).

(5) Transfer the fuel into the heated reactor system.

(6) Allow the subcritical fuel to cool. At about 1300°F, with
the moderator temperature closely controlled by the NaK, the core should
be critical,

The reactor should now be ready to supply heat to the propulsion
system. In the event that the temperature of the moderator can not be
precisely controlled, it may be possible to vary the height of the
moderator level in the core and thereby effect a reasonable degree of
control for start up.

5.11 Shut Down

Driving a reactor subcritical when at idle power without the
use of safety rods may not be a practical possibility. The practicability
of draining the fuel from the core was given lengthy consideration, This
was eliminated on the grounds that the additional weight, higher radiation
levels and manifold engineering complexities would be associated with

this system.

=38-
To drive the reactor subcritical a shut down rod in the reflector
appears to be necessary. This rod will be completely withdrawn from the
reactor during normal operation; to drive the reactor subcritical it will
be inserted in the reflector either manually or automatically. This rod is

not expected to unduly penalize the shield or reactor design.
VI. REACTOR ENGINEERING
6.1 Optimization

Following the decision to contaln the fuel in tubes, a study was
undertaken to ascertain the combination of fuel tube diameters and number
of tubsge which would yield optimum performance. The factors considered in
the study are described in Appendix 5. The ultimate choice was a
nompromise between the excessive self-shielding of large dismeter tubes
and the large core diameter and pressure drop assoclated with small
diameter tubes. Six 3.5 inch dlameter tubes were chosen.
6.2 Heat Transfer
6.2.1 Gamma Heating

The heating produced by gamma radiation must be known for the
design of cooling passage to prevent overheating of ths reactor structure.
This heating superimposed on that due to heat transfer determines the
source used to calculate cocling hole distribution, per Reference 15,

For the purpose of this calculation the reactor was resolved as
follows:

1. Island ~ NaOD and central fuel tube homogenized,
2, Bource Region - Remaining fuel tubss and NalD
in the interstices - Annulus.

3. ¥a0D spherical shell.

10 -
4. Nickel inconel shell
5. Be reflector and an estimated quantity of NaOD and
Hi for cooling.
W. 8. Farmer's method (Reference 16) was used with modifications
suggested by F. H. Abernethy snd A. H. Fox.
Assumptions inherent in the method are: . ©.

a. The "straight shead" theory of gamma absorption
applies, i.e., compton scattering degrades the photon in energy
but does not change its direction.

b. Mo refraction takes place at boundaries.

¢., The source power density is uniform over the
equivalent source annulus.

d, The fission rate is uniform.

Assumptions used for the Screwball:

a, The "annulus" of fuel tubes may be replaced by a
homogeneous annulus of the same thickness.

b. The gamma spectrum may be idealized as a source
consisting of 1 Mev gammas only. (A more accurate treatment
would be to use sources of 1, 2, and 3 Mev gammas with the
source strengths adjusted according to the pumber of gammas
between 0 and 1.5, 1.5 and 2.5, and 2.5 and infinite Mev
energy.)

c. The use of % for both energy deposition probability
and attenuation factors, rather than using p and a build=up factor

for attenuation, will not result in serious errors. (The proper

fil om
build-up factors for the Screwball configuration are not known.
This assumption will cause an error such that the cooling tubes
will be placed closer than necessary. Accurate results can
only be obtained through the use of critical experiments or
actual mockups.)
d. For calculations in the source region, gemma's
which traverse the island must be considered. Therefore; for
these ezlculations, the TC for the island (0,117 inches ™1)
was assumed equal to that for the source region ( 0,152 inches ™).

A fictitious surface source which ylelds reasonable heating

In the reflector region, the slab source is used for about

1/2 2gs then it is matched to a surface source on the outside of the
nickel - inconel shell. Equation (6) may be modified by replacing the
Ej functions by go, functions, thus correcting the non-isotropic

6.2.2 Internal Heat Transfer

Due to the complex flow passage for the NalD, an exact
prediction or analysis of the NaOD velocities in the core is impossible.
Hence, the following simplified method has been used for determining
the required NaOD flow rate. Since corrosion and engineering data are
not available for Na0OD, NaOH has been used in the engineering analysis.

The thermal conductivity of NaOH is small (0.72 Btu/hr ft °F. at 11000F.)

compared with liquid metals mnd is approximately half the thermal
conductivity of the fuel. Hence, a large fraction of the temperature
difference between the fuel and hydroxide may occur in the NaOD film
for low velocities.

To estimate more intelligently the flow rate which results
in a tube wall temperature not exceeding 1250CF. a calculation was made
for a 3.6 inch outside liameter fuel tube with a one inch annulus of
NaOH surrounding it. The fuel velocity was assumed to be 20 ft/sec.
and the NaOH velocity was varied. The variation of U with Vy, 4p was
determined and is showm in Figure 2.

The NaOD flow area perpendicular to the polar axis was
determined at various latitudes, Then the variation of VNa0D with position
in the reactor could be caleulated. A relation between the NaOD velocity
at the equatorial plane (Vo) and the average velocity was found.

Assuming a velocity normal to the equator, the average U was
calculated and the total temperature rise of the NaOD through the core
was estimated, Since the total temperature rise including that due to
gamma heating was small (10 - 20°F.), a linear temperature rise through
the reactor was assumed.

At one inch intervals along the axis, average velocities, U's,
h's and AT's were estimated. The product of U and AT gave the heat
flux. The temperature rise in the NaOD film, &T; y,op =» W&S calculated

The sum of AT; AT, and the NaOD temperature is the outside tube
wall temperature, which must not exceed 1250°F,

Figure 10 shows the variation of fuel mixed mean temperature,
tube cutside well temperature and the NaOD mixed mean temperature with
position in the core. AV, of 6 ft/sec. gives a maximum wall temperature
of 1254°F, This calculation establishes the magnitude of the flow rate
based on the simplified flow system,

6.2.3 Reflector Cooling

The heat generated in the beryllium reflector is removed by the
passage of NaOD through 0.23 inch diameter coolant tubes. The
calculation of coolant tube spacing is based on the following assumptions:

1. Neutron flux distribution from the two group, three region
calculations were not available for this calculation. Therefore, the heat
generation due to the neutron moderation was assumed équal. to the gamma
heating. This assumption agrees with work done on the Fireball (Reference
2).

2. Bach coolant tube row is treated as a separate annular cell.

3. A mean, uniform power density is assumed for each cell.

4. The tubes are arranged in an equilateral matrix.

5. The tube diameter is 0.23 inches.

6. The maximum beryllium temperature will not exceed the
coolant tube wall temperature by more than 50°F,

7. Heating from capture gammas in the inconel shell is neglected.

8. A11 fission product gammas are emitted in the core.

From the basic heat conduction equation it can be shown that

To determine the cooling tube spacing, the following iterative
method was used,

1. Assume the row spacing,

2. Calculate unit cell dimensions using equations (2) and (3).

3. Bstimate log, mean power density from figure 11.

L. From equations (1), (2) and (3), calculate the value $ for
which AT = 50°F,

5. Check the caleulated value of 5 with the assumed row spacing
and iterate until equal.

From the row spacing and reflector dimensions, the tube pitch
circle radius is determined. The number of tubes in each row is calculated
from the pitch circle circumference and tube spacing. Non-integral
numbers of tubes were adjusted to the next higher integer and their
spacing on the pitch circle altered accordingly.

The results for the Screwball reflector are listed below,

In calculating the gamma heating, A was used as the
attenuation factor rather than p, resulting in more rapid attenuation
and hence larger heat generation. Therefore, the above results should
be conservative.

M1 fission product gamnmes were sssunod to be emitbed in the
core. In reality a fraction will be emitted in the core end the remaining
gamnas will be emitted in the external fuel circuit. The heat
generation at the outside of the reflector is removed by the NaCD in the
by-pass annulus.

The NalD velocity in the reflector was determined by calculating
the heat flux, heat transfer AT, and temperature rise of the NaOD at
various assumed velocities. Calculations were made for the tube row in the
highest power density region.

At a veloeity of 7 ft/sec, the temperature rise of the NaOD is
156°F, h is 2600, end the heat transfer AT is 80°F, This gives a total
temperature at the end of the coolant tube of 1251 OF, which is
approximately the maximum temperature allowable from a corrosion standpoint.
6.2.4 Primary Heat Exchanger

The primary heat exchanger for the Screwball reactor is a
spherical shell which will wrap around a 53 inch diameter sphere. This
shell will be 4 inches thick and will begin snd end on the sphere at
45° North Latitude and 60° South Latitude, respectively, Within the

shell the fuel and NaK coolant will flow counter-currently; the Nak flows

53
down within the tubes in the heat exchanger. The tubes will be wrapped
in such a way that there is a constant clearance between tubes of 0.035
inch. Two spacers per foot of length of tubing appear to be adequate.

The fuel will enter at the botton of the heat exchanger at
1550°F and will leave at the top at 1150°F. On the NaK side the entrance
temperature is 90°F and the temperature rise will be 510°F., The
velocities and pressure drops for the fuel and Nak are, respectively,
6.95 ft/sec., 36.3 ft/sec,, 32.9 psi and 31 psi. The material of
construction will be inconel.

The primary heat exchanger design for the Screwball is based on
the method presented in Reference 19; a summary of the calculations for
this exchanger appear in Appendix 8.

This heat exchenger represents a feasible design and no major
attempt has been made to optimize it. It is anticipated that the fuel
volume in the heat exchanger can be reduced to approach that of the
Fireball design and further effort in this direction is recommended.
6.2.5 NaOD Heat Exchanger

The NaOD heat exchanger has the form of a right, circular
cylindrical annulus six inches thick and 15 inches tall. The NaK flows
downward through 1/2 inch 0. D. inconel tubes which have a wall
thickness of 50 mils, including an external 10 mil cladding of nickel.
These tubes form a lattice in the form of an equilateral triangle with a
minimum clearance of 0.125 inches between the tubes. The NalD flows
across the bottom of the annulus, up the outside and back down the
inside of the enpulus as indicated in Figure 1. For this calculation elght

( 16 MW ) of the reactor heat was assumed to be removed by the NalD,

The heat transfer calculations are based on relations presented
in Reference 20. Two pass, parallel flow of NaOD and single pass
downward flow of NaK were assumed. Pressure loss calculations for the
Rall assumed mixed parallel and cross flow. A sample calculation and
tabulation of design data are contained in Appendix 9 and Appendix 1,
respectively.

The NaQD heat exchanger is a conservative design; more heat
transfer area is provided than is actually required since the higher rates
of heat transfer in cross flow have been neglected to simplify the
analysis,

6.3 Fuel Flow Experiment

As mentioned in Section 3.2 it is assumed that the flow patterns
in the tubes of constant cross section are more predictable than the
variable area passage employed in the Fireball. This experiment was
conducted to verify flow stebility in helical tubes.

Pigure 12 is a photograph of the apparatus. The one inch glass
tube is geometrically similar to the Screwball fuel tubes; ~~ no flow
irregularities were observed. The fluid is an aniline dye.

A secondary flow typical of that generated in smooth tube bends
was observed; this added turbulence should increase fuel mixing |
produce a more uniform velocity profile and increase pressure losses.

This experiment supports the assumption of fuel flow stability

in the Screwball.

Figure 13 is taken from the report of the 1953 Shielding Board
meeting. The shield consist of lead and borated water. Lead was used
adjacent to the pressure shell and in a 20° shadow shield which is
incorporated in those shield designs requiring selective reduction of
external dose.

The curves shown are for reactor core diemeters of 28.5"
(Screwball) and 22.5". Details of the calculations can be found in the

VIII CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS

On the basis of the work presented in this report, the Screwball
reactor appears to be feasible, However, a considerable quantity of
detailed analysis and experiment is required before its practicability is
established,

Based on the work covered by the report, the conclusions and
recompendations are:

1) The use of NaOD as a moderator and reflector coolant, as
proposed, has great potentiality, however, with the assumed corrosion
limitation on tube wall temperature (1250°F), very large flow rates and
adequate flow guidance are required to attain marginal performance.

2) The uncertainty about flow instabilities is less severe in
helical fuel tubes than in spherical, annular flow passages. Hence, the
use of helical tubes is recommended until stability in spherical annulii
has been confirmed experimentally.

3) For design point operation, preheating the NaK with the
moderator heat lends itself to a simple reactor and propulsion system
design. The desirability of this scheme increases as the melting-point
of fused salt fuels is decreased. Further investigation of Nak preheat
is recommended, particularly for operation off the design point,

4) Although the fuel volume external to the core is large, by
optimizing the primary heat exchanger for minimum fuel volume while
maintaining reasonable pressure drops, the fuel volume reported should
approach that of the Fireball. With an external fuel volume equal to

that in the Fireball (5.7 cubic feet), the Screwball core will contain

«HD.
33 percent of the total fuel volume. The higher delayed neutron
concentration in the core and a more conservative power density make
control of the Screwball more practicable than the Fireball,

5) Despite the larger size and the use of tubes for fuel
containers, the critical mess of the Screwball (35 pounds - based on
conservative self-shielding factors) compares favorably with the Fireball
critical mass (30 pounds) as reported in Reference 1. In addition, the
ratio of total fuel volume to core volume for the Screwball may be
reduced by optimizing the primary heat exchanger, thus yielding a smaller
total fuel mass for the Screwball,

6) The NaOD flow pattern in the core is unknown. The assumption
that Nalh will flow between the tubes may not be realistic and more positive
guidance of flow may be required.

7) Support of the thin-walled fuel tubes at such close tolerances
may be difficult, particularly since the thermal expansion patterns are
analytically unpredictable. Any support structure contacting the tubes in
the core presents a potential NaOD stagnation point and hence, a corrosion
center,

8) The assumption of quantitatively similar physical and chemical
properties for NaOD and NaOH is unfounded ,

The major, fundamental limitation of the Screwball is the NaOD

corrosion,

Appendix 5, Optimization
1. Basic Assumptions:

In order to extract 200 MW of heat at 2.5 KW/cc, a fixed volume
of fuel in the reactor core is necessary. Using this volume the system
was optimized from the nuclear and engineering standpoint by varying the
number of tubes and the tube diameters.

2. Factors Considered and Their Associated Parameters;

a, Self Shielding: The self shielding factor F 1s discussed
in Section 5.2. It can be shown that F depends directly upon the
diameter of the tube.

b. Pressure Surge: This criterion requires further investigation.
However, the larger the ratio of central flow area to the exit flow area
the more severe the problem will be. Thus we wish to minimize LL where

0) = central flow grea
exit flow area :

¢. Heat Transfer: The amount of heat transferred, @, can be

shown to be proportional to n0+2y, , where n is the number of tubes of

of length, L, and Diameter, D, It is desirable to minimize the heat
transferred to the HNalb,

d. Pressure Loss: The pressure drop in the fuel tubes will be
much lower than that in the heat exchanger, hence this factor is not of
major importance. The parameter used was,

AP VAL
D

7]
e. Fabrication: An index of fabricability is tube lengths
the longer the tube, the more turns made, and hence greater fabrication
problems.

f. Poisons: Since for a fixed dismeter the total tube length
is constant, the ratio of poison to fuel added is independent of the
number of tubes. However, the poison. increases as the tube diameter

decreases. The parameter is,

Ww - Volune of inconel
Volume of fuel

g. Core Diameter: The reactor weight increases with core
diameter. It is seen that the diameter increases with decreasing tube
diameter.

factor F, the first being for the fast neutrons and the second figure

Since the heat addition to the NaOD results in such a small temperature
