ABSTRACT

The experimental system used in the determination of turbu-
lent forced-convection heat-transfer coefficients with molten
salts is described, and the results of the experimental program
are detailed. The salts studied have been the mixtures NaNO, -
NaNO, -KNO5, LiF-NaF-KF and NeF-ZrF, -UF , and sodium hydroxide.
Low results with the LiF-NaF-KF mixture in Inconel tubes are ex-
plained in terms of an interfacial film, A nonwetting phenomenon
is postulated to describe the decreased heat transfer in the NaF-
ZrF, -UF) system. The advantages of molten salts as coolants are
briefly discussed.

It can be concluded that molten salts behave, in general,
as ordinary fluids (0.5 < Np. < 100) as far as heat transfer is

concerned. An analysis has shown that the molten salts compare

favorably with the liquid metals as reactor coolants.
.

INTRODUCTION

The study of the heat-transfer characteristics of molten salts has
received much attention in recent years as these fluids have been found
to be potentially good high-temperature reactor coolants and fuels. These
materiels are generally characterized by low vapor pressures (allowing near
atmospheric operation), high melting points, and good thermal properties.
The thermal conductivities of these fluids lie somewhere between those of
water and the poorer liquid metels, and the thermal capacities per unit
volume are as good as that of water, Studies of the heat and momentum
transfer characteristics of molten salt coolants indicate that the molten
salts compete favorably with the liquid metals.

Table 1 compares the working temperature range (melting temperature
to boiling temperature) and the Prandtl moduli of a number of fused salts
with those of some of the more common heat transfer fluids. Thus, Dow-
therm A has a working range of only 400°F as compared to 1000°F - 2000°F
for the molten salts. It is to be noted, of course, that this does not
provide the salts with an advantage over the liquid metals. However,
fused salts do possess an advantage over many of the liquid metals in
that they are nonflammable. A comparison of the final column in Table 1
shows that the fused salts have Prandtl moduli which lie in the same range

as those for ordinary fluids (0.5 < N_, < 100). From this, it is to be

Pr
anticipated that the molten salts behave as ordinary fluids with respect

to heat transfer.
Since littie information was available in the technicsl literature
on the heat-transfer characteristics of fused salts, an experimental pro-
gram to obtain heat-transfer coefficients for fused salts was initiated at
the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The fluids studied have been sodium
hydroxide, the eutectic mixture of sodium, potassium, and lithium fluoride
(11.5-42.0-46.5 mole %), the mixture NaNO, NaNO, -KNO. (40-7-53 weight %)

commercially known as "HTS", and the mixture NeF-ZrF) -UF) (50-46-4 mole %).

EXPERIMENTAL SYSTEM

The experimental determination of the heat-transfer coefficients of
molten salts presented a series of unususl problems. To insure against
leakage of the molten salt, an all-welded experimental system was used.
The high melting temperatures of the salts required that those parts of
the system in contact with the fluid be held at elevated temperatures at
all times. This seriously affected the lifetime of some system components
and increased the difficulty of servicing the equipment during operation.
In addition, the problems of temperature, pressure, and flow-rate measure-
ment were aggravated by the high system temperatures, The general tech-
niques used were not new to experimental investigations but did require
modification to satisfy the restrictions imposed by the fused salt systems.
To prevent contamination of the salt, helium was used as the blanket gas
with residual oxygen and water vapor removed either by bubbling through

sodium-potassium alloy or by passage over titanium sponge at 800°¢.
The experimental system is shown in Figure 1. The flow of fused
salts through the test section was effected by gas pressurization. A gas
pressurized flow system possesses the advantages over a pump system of
simplicity of construction and of trouble-free operation but requires
greater quantities of salt to insure temperature equilibrium at high flow
rates. In this system the fluid was pushed through the test section, lo-
cated between the two tanks, by pressurizing one of the tanks with the
inert blanket gas while venting the other. At the end of a cycle - i,e.,
when all of the salt had been transferred into the second tank - the pres-
sures were reversed and the fluid was pushed in the opposite direction.
Generally, the device used to measure the fluid flow rate can be used also
to control the fluid cycling.

During the course of this experimental program, numerous modifications
were made to the physical system to provide a more flexible apparatus.
However, the only major change was a decrease in the size of the system.
This was done to reduce the total salt inventory and to alleviate some of
the effects of thermal expsnsion on the test section. Thus, the photograph
of Figure 1 shows the experimental system in the later stages of its devel-
opment, The two fluid reservoirs were jacketed by thermally insulated elec-
trical heaters. The test section was heated by the passage of a high amper-
age AC through the tube wall. The power to the test section was supplied
through electrodes soldered to the tube at each end. Mixing chambers were
located at the outlet and inlet ends of the test section.

The fluid flow rate was obtained by both weight and volume measuring
techniques. To obtain the weight rate directly, one of the two tanks was
mechanicelly isolated from the rest of the system by a flexible bellows.
This tank was then supported by a beam balance or a cantilever weigh beam,
and the change in weight was observed as the fluid flowed into or out of
the tank. With the cantilever beam, the movement of the beam as it de-
flected under the varying load of the tank was sensed at the free end by
a differential transformer. The cantilever weigh beam possessed high
sensitivity with beam deflections as small as 10 microinches being readily
detected. Direct calibration of either system was obtained by placing
weights on the tank or by flowing water at a constant rate into a contain-
er resting on the tank.

In another approach to flow measurement, the time required for the
fluid to fill a known volume was obtained. The volume was defined by two
bare metal probes inserted into one of the tanks at two different levels.
These probes were arranged such that the rising fluid on contacting the
first probe would complete an electric circuit and activate a timer.

When the second probe was reached, the timer would be stopped. From the
volume~-rate and the fluid density, the weight-rate was calculated. This
technique possessed difficulties, particularly in the deterioration and
electrical shorting of the probes and was not used to any great extent.
Fluid cycling was accomplished by using the signals from the probes or
the weigh-beam to actuate gas solenoid valves.

The test sections were fabricated from small diameter nickel, Inconel,

and type 316 stainless steel tubing. The tube dimensions are shown in
ts

Table 2. The tube outside surface temperatures were measured with 32-gage
chromel-alumel thermocouples resistance-welded to the tube. The fluid-
metal interface temperatures were obtained by correcting the outside sur-
face temperatures for the calculated radial temperature drop in the tube
wall. The thermocouple leads were wrapped around the tube for at least
one-quarter turn to minimize thermocouple conduction errors. The fluid
mixed-mean temperatures were obtained in baffled mixing chambers with the
thermocouples contained in relatively low-mass thermowells. Several types
of mixing pots, differing only in the method by which fluid mixing was
achieved, were used. One design consisted of a short length of pipe closed
at both ends. A whirling flow was induced by a tangential inlet, and fur-
ther mixing was obtained through a perforated disc located at the center of
the unit. A thermcwell extending along the axis enabled temperature meas-
urement at the inlet and outlet of the mixing chamber. Alternatively, a
modified "disc-and-doughnut" mixing chamber was used.

Thermocouples were calibrated at the freezing points of lead, zinc,
and aluminum. By sectioning the tube after the completion of each test
series, the calibration of the thermocouple attached to each of the small
tube pieces could be determined.

The voltage distribution along the test section was obtained using one
of the wires of the tube surface thermocouple at each position as a voltage
probe.

The test section was jacketed by a container filled with a granular

thermal insulation. The mixing chambers, guarded by small heaters, were
adjusted to approximately the temperature of the test fluid before operation.
Part of the total energy put into the test section is lost to the sys-

tem environment. Since the magnitude of this loss must be known to obtain

a heat balance for the system, a heat loss calibration was msde. This de-

termination was made for each test unit, as the system heat loss is a func-

tion of the density and distribution of the insulation around the test sec-

tion and of the end conditions. A typical heat loss calibration for a 24-inch

test section is shown in Figure 2.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Figures 3 through 8 show the results of these investigations with the
molten salts. Figure 3 presents the ORNL data on NaOH (closed circles) ccr-
related as the Colburn j-function. The generally accepted correlating equa-
tion for ordinary fluids is given by the line, j = 0.023 wn. 0"2, The data
of Grele and Gideon (1) obtained at NACA using a resistance-heated tube in
a pump system are shown by the closed triangles. In addition to heating
data, Grele and Gideon made measurements on the cooling of sodium hydroxide
in an air-cooled double-tube heat exchanger. These results are given also
(open triangles) in Figure 3. The reason for their high results and con-
siderable scatter is not clear.

Figure 4 shows the results of the study with "HTS". The first reported
measurements for molten salt heat transfer were those of Kirst, Nagle, and

Castner (2) using "HTS" in an electrically heated iron tube. Lacking data

on the thermal conductivity of this salt mixture, these investigators
-10-
correlated their data in terms of the dimensional function, na/u0*, Over
the Reynolds modulus range of 2,000 to 30,000, the average line through

their experimental values was given by the equation

hd ac

Jo w

In Figure 4 the data of Kirst, Nagle, and Castner have been recalculated
as the j-function using thermal conductivity values determined at ORNL,
In this figure the ORNL results with "HTS" are given by the closed circles.
These data cover the Reynolds modulus range of 5,000 to 25,000 and show good
agreement with the empirical equation describing forced-convection heat trans-
fer in ducts containing ordinary fluids.

Figure 5 summarizes the results of the heat-transfer experiments with
the LiF-NaF-KF eutectic mixture. The first tests were conducted using a
nickel tube for the test section. Data (open triangles) were obtained in
the transition flow region; and the results were in general agreement with
predictions as to the heat transfer with this molten fluoride. Attempts to
extend the Nee range of the data by increasing the temperature were unsuc-
cessful due to fatigue failure of the nickel tube when the temperature ex-
ceeded 1000°F.,

Following this the nickel tube was replaced by an Inconel section, since
Inconel retains its structural strength to very high temperatures. The re-

sults of the tests with the Inconel test section (open circles of Figure 5)

indicated that the heat transfer was a factor of two lower than that predicted
from the earlier NaOH, "HTS", and LiF-NaF-KF nickel tube data. Three pos-
sible explanations for the observed difference were possible: (1) an error
in the experimental measurements, (2) incorrect physical property data, or
(3) an unknown thermal resistance at the fluid-metal interface. Reanslysis
of the experimental system indicated the possibility of a thermocouple con-
duction error in the fluid mixed-mean temperature measurements. Therefore,
the mixing chamber design was altered, and a third series of runs were made.
The results, shown by the closed circles, verified the previous test series
in Inconel. Remeasurement of the physical properties eliminated this factor
as the source of error. Visual examination of the inside surface of the
tubes from both series of uns with the fluoride salt showed a green deposit
on the exposed tube surface. This was identified, chemically and petrograph-
ically, as a mixture of complex fluorochromstes of which the major constituent
was K CrFe.

The true heat-transfer coefficient, h, is given by the equation

TR @
a)

where A' is the inside surface area of the film, y, the film thickness and

ks the thermal conductivity of the film. Since the films are thin (in this

case 0.4 mils as indicated by photomicrographic study), the ratio of the

heat-transfer area for the film to that for the clean tube, A'/A, is approxi-

mately munity. Thus, we can replace (ap/2") by (a/A) and write
h = 1 (3)

 

0.2

’

Substituting h as determined from the equation, j = 0.023 Noo

and the experimental coefficient, h', into equation (3) resulted in a
value of 0.0002 nr-££2-°F/Btu for the thermal resistance, vk, - As a
cross-check, measurements were made of the film thickness and the thermal
conductivity of pure KCrFy. Using vy = 0.4 mils and the preliminary value
k, = 0.133 Btu/hr-ft-°F, a thermal resistance of 0.00025 hr-£t2-CF /Btu wes
obtained. This compared closely with the value (0.0002) deduced from the
heat-transfer data.

Two final experiments were made with the LiF-NaF-KF mixture. The
first was with a second nickel tube to verify the earlier results. The
results (closed triangles) were in essential agreement with the previous
nickel tube data. The second test used a type 316 stainless steel tube.
Preliminary tests had indicated that the fluoride eutectic mixture could
be contained in this alloy for short times without serious corrosion or
film formstion. This was verified by examination of the tube at the con-
clusion of the test. The results (indicated by the open squares) served
as additional evidence that the reduced heat transfer in Inconel could be
attributed directly to the deposits on the heat-transfer surface.

Heat-transfer studies were slso made with the fluoride mixture
NaF-ZrF) -UF) in Inconel. The results are shown in Figure 6 which compares
the data obtained by two investigators at ORNL. At a Reynolds modulus of

10,000, both sets of data fall approximatley 22% below the general
correlation for ordinary fluids. Salmon (3) used a double-tube heat ex-
changer with sodium-potassium alloy flowing through the annulus as coolant
and a length-to-diameter ratio of 40. Center-line temperatures were meas-
ured at both the inlet and outlet of the fluid streams. An adjustable probe
was used to measure the surface temperatures on the annulus side of the cen-
ter tube.

Both the measured surface temperatures and the Wilson (4) graphical
analysis technique were used in evaluating the heat-transfer coefficient.
Salmon's results based upon the measured surface temperatures exhibit con-
siderable scatter and are not shown. Unlike the LiF-NaF-KF: Inconel sys-
tem, visual examination of the exposed surface of the test section showed
no deposits, However, the surface appeared to have been unwet by the salt.
If the salt did not wet the tube, then perhaps the low heat transfer re-
sults could be explained on the basis of an additional thermal resistance
due to a gas film at the metal surface. As a check on the possibility of
a systemic error, a duplicate apparatus was operated with water as the test
fluid. The results agieed with the general heat-transfer correlation.

In an effort to gain some further insight into the reason for the de-
creased heat transfer with this zirconium-base fluoride, pressure-drop meas-
urements were made with this salt flowing isothermally through a smooth cir-
cular tube. The test section consisted of a 50-inch length of Inconel tubing,
1/4-in. OD x 0.035-in. wall thickness, with two short-radius right-angle bends.
The effects of entrance contraction, exit expansion, and the two bends were

determined by experiments with water. The equivalent tube length determined
~1h-

from the water measurements was used in calculating the fused salt friction
factor. The pressure drop across the test section was obtained as the dif-
ference in gas pressures in the fluid reservoirs at each end of the test
section. The results of these measurements are compared in Figure 7 with
the equation representing the friction factor in the Reynolds modulus range
from 5,000 to 200,000. The experimentally measured friction factor fell
approximately 16% below the value which would be predicted. On the basis
that J = f/2, the heat-transfer and momentum-transfer experiments with the
zirconium-base fluoride salt show good agreement.

Some information on the thermsl entrance length was obtained from the
sodium hydroxide and LiF-NaF-KF experimental data. The entrance system con-
sisted of a thermal entry region preceded by a hydrodynemic entrance region
of 8 to 13 tube aiameters. The entrance length, (x/a),, was taken as the
position at which the local heat-transfer coefficient had decreased to with-
in 10% of its fully established value. The observed variation of (x/a),

with the Peclet modulus is shown in Figure 8.

DISCUSSION

The physical properties of the salts studied were determined in an in-
dependent experimental program. The literature values for viscosity and
heat capacity for sodium hydroxide and "HTS" were also checked. The largest
uncertainty exists in the thermal conductivity of these salts. However, the
experimental effort aimed at establishing the temperature dependence of the

thermal conductivity of these fluids is continuing strongly.
Additional thermal resistence at the heat-transfer surface, whether
caused by a surface film-forming reaction or by "nonwetting", will result
in drastically reduced heat transfer in small tube systems. Since the ex-
perimental data indicate that such phenomena can occur with LiF-NaF-KF and
NaF-ZrF) -UF), the use of these salt mixtures as coolants may be limited.
This deficiency may be ameliorated by the development of suitable container
materials or "wetting" agents. In general, it can be concluded from the ex-
perimental results reported that the molten salts behave as ordinary fluids
(0.5 < No. < 100) as far as heat transfer is concerned.

An anslysis on the basis of a "cooling work modulus" (flow work per
unit heat removel) shows that as reactor coolants the molten salts compare
favorably with the liquid metals, This modulus, which is a function of the
system geometry, the flow regime, the thermal properties of the fluid, and
certain coolant temperature differences, is defined in the first equation of
Table 3.% Substituting for Fy (the flow work based on the pressure drop),
using the equation describing the friction factor in the turbulent flow
regime, results in the expression of the cooling work modulus as a function
of the parameters outlined above. The second equation in this table defines
the over-all temperature difference in the reactor-heat-exchanger system
postulated. The third equation expresses the Nusselt modulus for the sys-
tem in terms of a number of dimensionless parameters involving the geomet-
rical proportions, heat generation rates, and temperature differences for
the system. This equation was obtained by substituting the equations de-

scribing the heat transfer in the reactor and the heat exchanger into the

temperature difference equation.

The system on which this analysis wes based 1s shown schematically in
Figure 9. The over-all temperature difference defined is seen to be the
difference between the hottest point in the system (the reactor wall at the
exit) and the heat rejection temperature (the coolant-side wall temperature
in the heat exchanger). It was assumed that heat generated uniformly within
the reactor. fuel elements was removed by & non-heat-generating coolant flow-
ing turbulently through circular, parallel tubes uniformly distributed through
the core. The coolant passages were presumed of sufficient length to allow
thermal and hydrodynamic entrance effects to be neglected, The physical
properties of the fluids were assumed temperature-independent, and the thermal
sink in the heat exchanger was chosen to be a liquid boiling on the outside
surface of the tubes.

The Nusselt modulus equation for this system was solved simultaneously
with the Nusselt modulus equations for fully developed turbulent pipe flow
for both ordinary fluids and liquid metals to obtain the Reynolds modulus.
The resulting value of the Reynolds modulus was substituted into the first
equation of Table 3 to obtain the cooling work modulus. The specific set
of reactor dimensions and operating conditions are given in Table 4. The
cooling work modulus as a function of tube diameter for the coolants con-
sidered - lithium, sodium, bismuth, sodium hydroxide, and the LiF-NeF-KF
eutectic - is shown in Figure 10. It can be seen that lithium is the best
of the five reactor coolants while bismuth is the worst. Sodium, sodium
hydroxide, and the Lif-NaF-KF mixture are comparable in heat transfer effec-

tiveness with the two salts being better over the lower part of the tube
wy

-17-

diemeter range. For very smell tube dismeters (approximately one-tenth

inch), the alkali-metel fluoride salt is as good a coolant as lithium.

CONCLUSIONS

The molten selts, in general, behave as ordinary fluids as far as heat
transfer is concerned. Since phenomene such as film formation and non-
wetting (demonstrated in some molten salt systems) are difficult to predict,
the heat-transfer characteristics of the molten salts for critical appli-
cations must be experimentslly established.

An analysis has shown that the fused salts compare favorably with the

liquid metals as reactor coolants.
