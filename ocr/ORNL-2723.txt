MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT
SUMMARY

Part 1. Reactor Design Studies

1.1. Nuclear Calculations and Design Studies

The effects of fuel processing by the ion-exchange method at a
rate of once per year and at a rate of 12 times per year were compared
for the Interim Design Reactor fueled with U35. Processing st the
higher rate gave insufficient improvement in performance to offer a
substantial economic advantage.

The nuclear performance of a one-region, graphite-moderated,
unreflected, thorium-conversion, molten-salt-fueled reactor was
studied to evaluate the effects of processing the fuel at the rate
of once per year and 12 times per year, the effects of decreasing
the thickness of the core vessel and adding a blanket, and the effects
of using a graphite core vessel and a blanket. The results of the
calculations indicated that the nuclear performance of the one-region
reactor fueled with y23> and processed by either the volatility or
ion-exchange methods at the rate of one fuel volume per year is com-
petitive with the best performance of the solid fuel systems, and
therefore the molten-salt reactor will yield lower over-all fuel costs
when the potential economies of continuous, chemical processing of
the fluid fuel are realized.

| The initial nuclear characteristics of a one-region, heterogeneous,
graphite-moderated and reflected, thorium-conversion, molten-salt-
fueled reactor were studied. It was found that with 13 mole % THF), in
the fuel, a maximum regeneration ratio of 0.846 could be obtained

‘with an inventory of approximately 1150 kg of u?3%, with 7 mole %

ThF), in the fuel, an estimated maximum regeneration ratio of 0.798 at

an inventory of approximately 900 kg of 233 wes obtained.
Calculations were also made of the performance of two-region,

graphite-moderated, molten-salt-fueled, breeder reactors. Spherical

 
 

 

reactors, 5 ft in diameter, with fuel volume fractions of 0.10 and
0.15% were studied. Results were obtained for reactors with power
levels of 125 and 250 Mw. It was found that the only reactor with
a doubling time less than 20 years was the 250-Mw reactor having a
fuel volume fraction of 0.10.

The effects of fast-neutron reactions in Be’ on the reactivity
of molten-salt-fueled reactors were studied. It was found that Be?
is an appreciable poison in homogeneous, molten-salt-fueled reactors,
but it has negligible effect in graphite-moderated, molten-salt-
fueled reactors.

Work is continuing on the design of a 30-Mw, one-region, experi-

mental, molten-salt reactor.

1.2. Component Development and Testing
Tests of salt-lubricated hydrodynamic journal bearings were
continued in order to obtain operating data on which to base an
optimum design. Assembly of a thrust-bearing tester was nearly com-
pleted. An existing centrifugal sump pump is being modified for
service tesis of a salt-lubricated journal bearing, and means for
flexibly mounting the bearing to the pump casing are being investigated.
The modified Fulton-Sylphon bellows-mounted seal being subjected
to an endurance test in a PK-P type of centrifugal pump has continued
to seal satisfactorily for more than 12,000 hr of operation. Operation
of an MF type of centrifugal pump with fuel 30 as the circulated
fluid has continued to be satisfactory through more than 15,500 hr,
with the past 13,500 hr of operation being under cavitation damage
conditions. A small frozen-lead pump seal on a 3/16-in.-dia shaft
has operated since the first 100 hr of T7500 hr of operation with no lead
leakage. A similar seal on a 3 1/k-in.-dia shaft has operated 3600
hr, with an average leskage rate of 9 em hr. Operational data suggest
that the seal should be redesigned to provide better coolant control
and packing to decrease the annulus between the seal and the shaft.
Construction work continued on the remote maintenance demon-
stration facility. The work is on schedule and is to be completed by

June 30, 1959.

The operation of long-term forced-circulation corrosion-testing
loops continued in 15 test stands. Tests of two Inconel loops that
had operated for one year were terminated. Salt samples were removed
periodically from two loops that contain sampling devices.

The in-pile loop operated previously in the MTR was disassembled.
It was found that oil which had leaked past the pump shaft seal and
filled the oil trap on the purge outlet line was polymerized by radia-
tion, and the polymerized oil plugged the outlet line. The second
in~-pile loop, which was modified to minimize the probability of purged
line plugging and activity release, was installed in the MIR on
April 27.

1.3. Engineering Research

The enthalpy, heat capacity, viscosity, and surface tension have
been experimentally obtained for several additional fluoride salt
mixtures containing BeF, with varying emounts of UF) and/or ThF), .
Altering the salt composition toward higher percentages of the high-
molecular-weight components resulted in substantial decreases in both
the enthalpy and heat capacity. The viscosity showed some increase
(of the order of 10%) as the percentage of UF), and ThF) in the mixtures

‘was increased. Initial flow calibrations of a full-scale mockup of

the pump system designed for the study of interfacial film formation
and heat transfer with BeF ,~containing salts have been completed;
assembly of the components is proceeding. The flow characteristics

of the sintered-metal-filled annulus of a double-walled tube have been
obtained for two porosity conditions.

1.4. Instruments end Controls

Work has continued on mol ten-salt-fuel level indicators. Two
Inconel "I". tube-type elements were prepared for testing, and an
INOR-8 element and test vessel are being constructed.

Six INOR-8 pressure transmitters and indicating systems were
ordered for testing. These units are of the pneumatic-indicator type.

Part 2. Materials Studies

2.1. Metallurgy

Corrosion studies were completed on four INOR-8 and four Inconel
thermal-convection loops. Metallographic examination of the INOR-8
loops, three of which operated for 1000 hr and the other for one year,
revealed no observable attack. The Inconel loops, which represented
three one-year tests and one 1000-hr test, showed intergranular void
attack to depths ranging from 4 to 15 mils. Twelve thermal-convection-
loop tests were initiated during this period. The scheduled tests of
two forced-circulation loops were completed, and one new forced-
circulation-loop test was started.

The effects of penetration of graphite by molten-fluoride-salt
fuels are being investigated in order to evaluate the problems
associated with the use of unclad graphite as a moderator. In static
pressure penetration tests at 150 psia and 1300°F, partially degassed
graphite was penetrated throughout by fuel 30 (NaF-ZrF) -UF),) but was
not penetrated by fuel 130 (LiF-BeF,-UF), ), as indicated by macroscopic
examination. Thermal cycling of the graphite that was penetrated
by fuel 30 did not result in damage to the graphite. Additional static
and dynamic tests are planned.

A series of tests was run to further investigate the precipitation
of uranium from fuel 130 held in a graphite crucible at 1300°F. The
results of these tests supported the previous conclusion that the
uranium precipitation was the result of the fuel reacting with oxygen
supplied by degassing of the graphite.

Several brazing alloys were tested for compatibility with fuel
130. Coast Metals alloy No. 52 (89% Ni-4% B-5% Si-2% Fe) and pure
copper brazed to Inconel and INOR-8 showed good resistance to fuel
130 in 1000-hr tests at 1300°F in a thermal-convection loop. The
following brazing alloys showed some attack or porosity as a result
of similar exposure to fuel 130: General Electric alloy No. 81
(70% Ni-19% Cr—11% Si), Coast Metals alloy No. 53 (81% Ni-8% Cr-li% Si-
4% B-3% Fe), and a gold-nickel alloy (82% Au-18% Ni).

A specimen of INOR-8 was examined for evidence of carburization
that had been exposed to fuel 130 for 4000 hr in a thermal-convection
loop hot leg at a temperature of 1300°F. The presence of a 10-in.
graphite insert in the hot leg of this loop did not cause carburization
of the INOR-8.

No new creep data for INOR-8 became available during the quarter.
Creep tests are presently in progress at 1100 and 1200°F with the
fluoride salts of interest as the test environments, and these tests

are expected to run in excess of 10,000 hr.
The critical results obtained from rotating-beam fatigue tests

at 1500°F indicate that INOR-8 has significantly better fatigue
resistance than Inconel. Creep and relaxation tests indicate that an
unstable condition exists in the temperature range from 1100 to 1400°F.
There is some indication that a second phase appears which causes
contraction of the metal even under load.

Based on the results of tensile tests conducted on specimens of
INOR-8 aged for 10,000 hr in the temperature renge of 1000 to 1400°F,
it has been concluded that INOR-8 does not exhibit embrittling tendencies
that can be attributed to high-temperature instebility. No significant
differences were found between the tensile properties of the aged
specimens and those of specimens in the annealed condition.

An effort is now being made to fabricate triplex heat exchanger
tubing containing a prefabricated porous nickel core. Porous nickel
tubes have been ordered from Micro Metallic Corp. to determine the feasi-
bility of cladding the materiel with Inconel and INOR-8. A sample piece
of porous nickel has been incorporated into the annular space formed

between two Inconel ‘tubes for conducting a preliminary cladding experiment.

Procedures are ‘being developed for fabricating INOR-8 material
ranging in size from thin-walled tubing +0 ‘heavy plate. The procedures
thus developed are being: qualified in accordance with methods prescribed
by the ASME Boiler Code.

The effects of various deoxidation and purification processes
on the mechanical properties of INOR-8 weld metal are being studied

xi

 
 

 

in an effort to improve the high-temperature ductility of INOR-8 weld
metal. Several heats of weld metal containing various additives were
cast and fabricated into weld wire for mechanical property evaluation. .
A method was developed for brazing graphite to Inconel. A.
commercially available brazing alloy composed of silver, titanium, and
copper was found that wet vacuum-degassed graphite. Such graphite-to-
Inconel joints were used in the fabrication of equipment for studying
the penetration of graphite by molten salts in a dynamic, high-pressure

system.

2.2. Chemistry and Radiation Damage

A revised phase diagram for the system LiF-BeF 5>~ThF), was prepared
that includes new data obtained from thermsl-gradient quenching experi-~
ments. Quenched samples from experiments in which an equilibration
period of 3 weeks was used revealed that the area of single-phase
ternary solid solutions involving SLiF-ThF) is greater than previously
reported. A phase diagram showing the progress made thus far in the
study of the NaF-BeF,-ThF), was also prepared, and the identity and
approximate locations of primary phases in the system NeF-ThF) ~UF),
were determined.

The SnF,~NH) HF system was investigated because of its potenti-
alities as a strongly oxidizing, low-melting solvent for reprocessing
fuels. Relisble data were obtained only in the range O to 40% SF.

A 15 mole % addition of Sof, gives a mixture with a melting point of
about 100°C.

Measurements were made of the solubility of PuF, in LiF-BeF 5~
UF), (70-10-20 mole %). The solubility values obtained were all higher
than those obtained with LiF-BeF, mixtures having about the same LiF
concentration but no UF),

The possibility of separating LiF from the mixture LiF-BeF,, (63-
37 mole %¢) by adding NaF and decreasing the temperature was investigated.
In an initial experiment only 23% of the LiF remained in solution when

the temperature of the mixture to which NaF was 8dded at 700° C was
lowered to 490°C.

Tests were initiated for determining the rate of exchange in a
proposed method for decreasing the total rare earth content of molten

fluoride salts. The exchange reaction

SF 5 (a) + CeF, (8) == CeFy (a) + Su (s)

is utilized by passing the salt through an isothermal bed of solid

CeFy to lower the Smif 3

salt is lowered to decrease the total rate earth content.

content, and then the temperature of the effluent

Two methods for separating uranium from fission products are
being studied. In one method the reaction of UF), with BeO to produce
uo, is utilized. In the other method, the reaction of UF), with water
vapor produces Uo, The sharpness of the separation with water vapor
may be advantageous in processing schemes. It is thought that a
process cen be developed that will eliminate the need for fluorine
and that will provide for the simultaneous removal of uranium and
thorium. A further step would be required to remove the rare earths.

Measurements were made of the solubility of neon in LiF-BeF,
and co, in NeF-BeF,.

In the study of the chemistry of the corrosion process, further
samples of melts from operating INOR-8 and Inconel forced-circulation
loops were analyzed for chromium. The chromium concentration in the
LiF-BeF ,-ThF) -UF), mixture in the INOR-8 loop reached a plateau of
about 550 ppm after about 11200 hr of operation. The chromium concen
tration of the same - salt mixture in the Inconel loop increased more
rapidly than in the INOR-8 Loop. and after 1700 hr was still increasing.
These tests are ‘continuing.

Most” investigations of corrosion ‘behavior depend on accurate
analyses for structural metal ions, end therefore anomalies in the
present analytical methods are being studied.

Tests of the permeability of graphite by molten fluoride salts
have continued. ‘Three types of graphite: that vere specially treated
to meke “them impervious were obtained from the National Carbon Company.
The types designated ATL-82 and ATJ-82 were resistant to forced

impregnation with LiF-MgF,, salt and were considerably resistant to
penetration by a typical reactor fuel. Unexpectedly high concentrations
of uranium in the center of the rods are being investigated.

The in-pile thermal-convection loop for testing fused-salt fuel
in INOR-8 tubing in the LITR was operated in preliminary tests out-of-
pile, and satisfactory circulation was obtained. Final assembly of the
loop system is under way. Two fuel-filled INOR-8 capsules were installed
in the MTR and are being irradiated at 1250°F.

A device for testing a proposed fuel sampling and enriching
mechanism was constructed and tested. It was found that the rate of
solution of solid UF), in LiF-BeF, would be adequate for convenient
enrichment procedures.

The use of molten ammonium bifluoride as a reactant for preparing
both simple and complex fluorides and the preparation of pure chromous
fluoride by the reaction of chromium metal with molten stannous

fluoride were studied.

2.3. Fuel Processing

Studies of the processing of molten fluoride salt fuels by the
fluoride-volatility process were continued. Further measurements of
the solubility of neptunium (IV) in aqueous solutions saturated with
LiF-BeF,-Th¥) -UF), indicate that a solubility of the order of 0.0002
to 0.00005 mole % may be expected in actual processing.

1.1. NUCLEAR CALCULATIONS AND DESIGN STUDIES

Nuclear Calculations

Effect of Ion-Exchange Processing of Rare-Earth Fission Products on
Performance of Interim Design Reactor Fueled with ye33

It was reported previously® that substantial savings in fuel
burnup and inventory could be achieved in the Interim Design Reactor
fueled with USS? by passing the fuel selt rapidly through beds of
CeFy to remove the rare earth fission products. The effect of ion
exchange processing on the performance of the same reactor system
fueled with 233 has now been studied. The results for two different
processing rates — once per year and 12 times per year — are compered
in Pig. 1.1.1. Processing at the rate of once per year (1.7 £43 /aay)
could be performed either by the fluoride-volatility method™ or by
the ion-exchange method. Because of the high cost associated with the
discarding of carrier salt in the volatility method, it is not feasible
to use the volatility process for the higher rate.

It may be seen that processing at the higher rate gives only a
small improvement in performance. It is doubtful therefore that the
ion-exchange process offers any substantial economic advantage in the
Interim Design Reactor system fueled with U-S-.

studied, and typicel results are presented in Table 1.1.1 and in
Fig. 1.1.2, where regeneration ratio, critical inventory, and net
cumulative burnup are plotted as functions of time of operation.
Without processing, the regeneration ratio falls from 0.8 to 0.5 in
20 years. The fuel additions required to override fission-product
poisons are large; the critical inventory rises from 800 to 1800 kg
of fuel, giving an average specific power of only O.h4 Mw/kg. The
burnup is also large, averaging 0.45 g/Mwd.

Processing the fuel salt to remove fission products at the rate
of one fuel volume per year (2.5 £t3/day) stabilizes the regeneration
ratio at above 0.8. The inventory averages about 750 kg. The burn-
up is reduced to 0.21 g/Mwd. Increasing the processing rate to 12
fuel volumes per year (30 £t3/day) improves the performance only
slightly.

Although it is uncertain that a core vessel and blanket could
be incorporated into this reactor, it was of interest to evaluate
the nuclear benefits of such an arrangement. Accordingly, the thick-
ness of the INOR-8 reactor vessel wall was reduced to 1/2 in. for
the calculations, and a 30-in. blanket containing 13 mole % ThF), in
a mixture of LiF and BeF, was added. The blanket system was processed
12 times a year by the fluoride-volatility method to remove y233,
which was added to the fuel salt. The fuel was processed 12 times
a year by the ion-exchange method to remove fission products. The
results of the calculations are presented in Table 1.1.2, and the
performance is indicated in Fig. 1.1. 2 by the lines labeled y235 12,B.

The ‘regeneration ratio ‘averaged in excess of 0. .96 and approached 1.0

In a further extension of the calculations, the nuclear benefits
to be obtained by the use of sa graphite core vessel (in place of INOR-8)
and fueling with y233 were studied. These changes are, of course,
impractical in the present state of technology. However, the study
was performed in order to define the limiting nuclear performance of
this particular core and fuel system.

The results of the calculations are presented in Table 1.1.2, and
the performance is indicated in Fig. 1.1.2 by the lines labeled y?33
12,B. The regeneration ratio is stabilized above 1.06, the average
inventory is about 650 kg, and the cumulative net burnup is slightly

233 in 20 years. However, 76 kg

negative, amounting to -250 kg of U
of this is required as increased inventory in the fuel salt to override
fission products and nonfissionable isotopes.

It is concluded that the nuclear performance of the one-region
reactor fueled with y23>

ion-exchange methods at the rate of one fuel volume per year is

and processed by either the volatility or

competitive with the best performance of the solid fuel systems, and
therefore the molten-salt reactor will yield lower over-all fuel costs
when the potential economies of continuous, chemical processing of
the fluid fuel are realized.
Initial Nuclear Performance of One-Region, Graphite-Moderated, Graphite-
Reflected, Thorium-Conversion, Molten-Salt-Fueled Reactors

The initial nuclear characteristics of a heterogeneous, graphite-
moderated and -reflected, one-region, molten-salt-fueled reactor were
studied. The reactor considered in the study consists of a cylindrical
core, 15 ft in dia and 15 ft high, surrounded by a 2.5-ft-thick graphite
reflector contained in an INOR-8 pressure shell 1.5 in. thick. The
core is penetrated by cylindrical fuel passages arranged in an 8-in.
triangular lattice parallel to the core exis. The resulting unit cells
are hexagonal end 15 ft long. This system has been investigated over
a range of fuel volumetric fractions in the core and at two concen
trations of thorium in the fuel salt. The initial nuclear character-
istics of the system, with an external fuel volume of 673 £43, are

 
 

 

 

 

 

given in Tables 1.1.3 and 1.1.k for the cases having 13 and 7 mole %
ThF) in the fuel, respectively; Fig. 1.1.3 shows the regeneration ratio
as a function of the system inventory.

The modified Oracle program Cornpone was used to calculate the
multiplication constant and group disadvantage factors for the fuel
and graphite. The results were then used for complete reactor calcu-
lations in spherical geometry on a core having the same volume as the
cylindrical core. Mean, homogeneized densities (atoms/cm) were used
for each element.

It may be seen from Fig. 1.1.3 that, in the case having 13 mole %
ThF), in the fuel, a maximum regeneration ratio of 0.846 is obtained
at an inventory of approximately 1150 kg of ue32, With 7 mole % ThF),
in the fuel, an estimated maximum regeneration ratio of 0.798 at an

235

inventory of approximately 900 kg of U was obtained.

Nuclear Performance of Two-Region, Graphite-Moderated, Molten-Salt-
Fueled, Breeder Reactor

 

The nuclear performance of spherical, graphite-moderated reactors,
5 ft in diameter with fuel volume fractions of 0.10 and 0.15, was
studied. The fuel channels were 2.6 in. in diameter and were arranged
in an 8-in. triangular lattice. These reactors were surrounded by
2-in.-thick graphite core vessels and 30~-in.-thick blankets.

The fuel consisted of 71 mole % LiF, 16 mole % BeF,, and 13 mole %
ThF), plus UF), . The blanket salt had the same composition as the fuel,
but no UF), .

The performence of these reactors over a period of 20 years was
calculated for power levels of 125 and 250 Mw. The processing rate
in all cases was 12 fuel volumes per year. The system volumes used
for these calculations are shown in Table 1.1.5; only the heat exchanger
volume was increased for higher power levels.

The results of the calculations are presented in Tables 1.1.6 and
1.1.7 and are plotted in Figs. 1.1.4, 1.1.5, and 1.1.6. It may be seen
that the only reactor with a doubling time less than 20 years is the
250-Mw reactor having a fuel volume fraction of 0.10. For both cores,

Oracle Code MSPR-Cornpone 020
A revision has been made of the element sbsorption edit of Oracle

 

code MSPR-Cornpone 020, which now permits an immediate edit on paper
tape. Previously it was necessary to wait for curve-plotter pictures.
It is now possible to compute the breeding ratio and prepare the input
for Sorghum as soon as the case is run.

The cross-section tape has been checked and corrected where
necessary, and an edit has been obtained for the cross sections. The

Design of 30-Mw Experimental Reactor

Work is continuing on the 30-Mw, one-region, experimental, molten-
salt reactor described in the previous report. The basic reactor
concept has remained unchanged. More details of the equipment have
been developed, and various auxiliary system layouts are being studied.
A reactor site has been selected for design purposes, and perspective
drawings of a test reactor building have been prepared.

The bayonet-type fuel-to-coolant heat exchanger is being redesigned
in an effort to simplify the fabrication problems. Design data for use
in layout studies have been prepared for a U-tube, U-shell, coolant-

salt-to-steam superhester.

‘Fuel Drain System
The fuel drain system consists of four 2-1/2-ft-dia vessels

approximately 20 ft long. These tanks will be suspended in a vertical
position and manifolded to the reactor with pressure-siphon drain

lines. Two drain vessels will be required to contain the fuel system
inventory, and each pair of tanks will have a separate system to isolate
it from the reactor. The two extra drain tanks will provide capacity
for a spare salt volume, which may be used for fuel system cleaning or
decontamination operations.

The vessels will be preheated and afterheat will be removed with
a recirculating gas system. This gas system, as in the case of the
reactor gas system, will include a blower, heater, and cooler packages
enclosed in a loop.

The drain system criticality problem is being investigated. A
multiplication constant of less than 0.5 was obtained for one drain
vessel presumed to contain the entire fuel system UF), inventory in an
LiF-BeF,, salt mixture. As a further check, the y?3s was assumed to
settle out in the vessel as an oxide compound, and multiplication
constants are being obtained for four different geometries of fuel
concentrate, with one edge reflected by the salt mixture. A maximum
multiplication constant has not yet been obtained, but, with the fuel
concentrated in a cube, the multiplication constant was 0.83. It is
believed that this value would increase slightly with further settling
of the fuel. The bottom section of the drain vessel will therefore be

made with a smaller diameter to reduce the potential hazard.

1.2. COMPONENT DEVELOPMENT AND TESTING

Salt~Iubricated Bearings for Fuel Pumps

Hydrodynamic Journal Bearings

The sixth test of a journal bearing operating in molten-salt fuel
130 (LiF-BeF,-UF),, 62-37-1 mole %), as described previously,’ vas
terminated on schedule. During this test the temperature of the salt
was increased in 50°F increments from 1200 to 1500°F. Performance was
satisfactory throughout the entire test, which was conducted at a
constant journal speed of 1200 rpm and a constant radial load of 200 1b.
The total operating time for this test was 192 hr.

A seventh test was then performed with the bearing and journal used
in the fifth and sixth tests. This test also consisted of steady-state
operation at a journal speed of 1200 rpm and a radial load of 200 1b,
but start-stop operations were carried out three times at each test
temperature. The temperature was varied as in the sixth test from 1200
to 1400°F in 50°F increments. On attempting a second restart at the
1400°F temperature level, an increase in the power required was noted,
and the test was halted. The total operating time for this test was
216 hr. Inspection revealed a galled spot on the loaded side of the
bearing.

The eighth test was conducted to study the effect of increasing
the bearing radial clearance (measured at room temperature) to 0.007
in. All bearings previously tested had a radiel clearance of 0.005 in.
Molten-salt fuel 130 at 1200°F was used for this test, and the bearing
radial load was varied from 50 to 500 1b at each of two journal speeds,
600 and 1200 rpm. After 356 hr of operation, including 39 start-stop
sequences, a sudden increase in power halted the test. At the time the
power increase occurred the journal was operating at 600 rpm, and the
load was being increased from 300 to 400 1b; the load had reached 382 1b.
From the standpoint of minimum film-thickness, these conditions were the

 

1MSR Quar. Prog. Rep. Jan. 31, 1959, ORNI-268k, p 39.

oh
 

 

most stringent yet imposed in these molten-salt-lubricated bearing
tests.

A carburized INOR-8 journal was used with an uncarburized INOR-8
bearing for the ninth test. The tester was started and stopped 260
times during a period of operation of 272 hr at 1200°F. The Journal
speed was 1200 rpm and the bearing was loaded to 200 lb. Both the
bearing and the journal were in good condition, with undamaged surfaces,
at the end of the test. The bearing is shown in Fig. 1.2.1 and the
journal in Fig. 1.2.2.

Hydrodynamic Thrust Bearings

Assembly of the thrust-bearing tester described previously™ is
nearly completed. The thrust-load actuator is being given preliminary
tests prior to being fitted to the rotary portion of the tester.

Test of Pump Equipped with One Salt-Lubricated Journal Bearing

Detailed design work is nearly complete on the modifications to be
made to a PK type of centrifugal sump pump in order to replace the
lower oil-lubricated bearing with a molten-salt-lubricated hydrodynamic
journal bearing. The external motor of the PK pump is being replaced
with an integral, totally enclosed motor. The configuration of the
modified pump is intended to simulate, in large measure, that of the
pump proposed for use in an experimental molten-salt reactor. Proposals
have been received for the fabrication of the motor and the pump shaft,
and purchase orders are being placed. An existing facility is being
prepared for tests of this pump.

Bearing Mountings SE
Means are being investigated for flexibly mounting INOR-8 bearings

to INOR-8 pump casings so that thermal distortion between the bearing
and the pump shaft journal cen be accommodated. A diaphragm type of
mounting and a mounting that is ‘somewhat similar to the Westinghouse

"Thermoflex" mount are being studied.

Mechanical Seals for Pumps

The modified Ful ton-Sylphon bellows-mounted seal” being subjected
to an endurance test in a PK-P type of centrifugal pump has accumulated
an additional 1848 hr of operation since the previous report period, for
a total of 12,478 hr. The pump has been operating at a temperature of
1200°F, a shaft speed of 2500 rpm, and a Nak flow rate of 1200 gpm. The
maximum test-seal leakage rate was 3.5 cm 3/day; however, on an averaged
basis, the leakage is still negligible. Two pump stoppages occurred —
one for reworking-:the drive motor commutator and replacing the motor

brushes, and one as a precautionary measure during a power outage.

Pump Endurance Testing
3

An MF type of centrifugal pump has continued in operation,~ and
has logged more than 15,500 hr (approximately 1 3/4 yr) of continuous
operation. No maintenance has been performed on the pump during this
period. During the last 13,465 hr, a cavitation endurance test has been
under way with the pump operating at the steady-state conditions of 2700
rpm, 645 gpm, and 2.5-psig pump tank cover gas pressure at 1200°F. During
the quarter the pump was stopped five times. Two stops were momentary
and were caused by power outages. One stop was of 65 min duration for
replacing brushes in the motor-generator set. One stop was of 30 min
duration for calibrating the pressure-measuring devices. One stop was
for 60 min for freeing the system throttle valve that had become stuck.

Frozen-lead Pump Seal

The small frozen-lead pump seal being tested on a 3/16-in.-dia

shaft, as described previously, has operated continuously since it was

started on June 13, 1958. The accumulated operating time is more than
T7500 hr. Except for slight leakage of lead during the first 100 hr of
operation, there has been no further leakage.

The large lead pump seal with a 3 1/h-in.-dia rotating shaft has
been operating for 3600 hr. Leakage of solid lead from the seal is
sporadic. The average leakage rate for the time operated is 9 cm fur.
Operational data suggest that the seal should be redesigned to provide
better coolant control and to incorporate a short, resilient packing to
decrease the annulus between the seal and the shaft. A detailed
description of the equipment was presented previously.’ At the present

time, the operating conditions are the following

Shaft speed 975-1000 rpm
Argon pressure over molten

lead in tank 0-3 psig
Seal cooling water flow rate 0.8 gpm
Temperature rise in cooling

water ~ 25°F
Temperature where seal is formed 180-190°F

Techniques for Remote Maintenance of the Reactor System

Progress has been made in the design and construction, Fig. 1.2.3,
of a remote maintenance demonstration facility. The scheduled completion
date is June 30, 1959, and all phases of the work are on schedule.

The General Mills mechanical arm manipulator, 3 1/2- and 6-in.
Inconel piping subassemblies, dummy heat exchangers, salt dump tank,
dummy reactor, two closed-circuit television systems (Fig. 1.2.4), and
the spool for joining the pump and motor have been received. One of the
20 sets of freeze-flange pipe joints (Fig. 1.2.5) is on hand, and the
modifications required to adapt an existing PK type of pump for use in
this facility have been completed.

cated. These units are to be removeble and replacesble in short sections
with the use of the General Mills manipulator. Specially designed
spring-type pipe supports are being procured. Three gas and compressed-
air control cabinets are being fabricated.

Installation of the General Mills manipulator, heat exchangers,
dummy reactor, salt-circulating pump, salt piping, service piping, pump-
lube-oil piping, and electric heater control cabinets is in progress.

Design, Construction, and Operation of Materials
~ Testing Loops
Forced-Circulation Loops |

The operation of long-term forced-circulation corrosion-testing
loops wes continued. Fourteen test loops are presently in operation,
two Inconel loops were terminated as scheduled during the quarter, and
one new Inconel loop was started. A loop fabricated of INOR-8 is
presently being installed.

The two Inconel loops, designated 9344-2 and 9377-3 in Table 1.2.1,
were terminated after one year of operation. The facilities from which
these loops were removed have now been revised according to the latest
design’ for long-term operation. Of the 15 available loop facilities,
11 are of the improved design, and the remaining four loops are in
verious stages of improvements.

Several momentary power failures caused interruption of power to
the loops during the quarter, but flow resumed in all the loops after
power was restored, and there were no freeze-ups. The power failures
that have occurred since the beginning of this mol ten-salt-reactor
corrosion~-testing program and the results of such failures are described
in Table 1.2.2.

The loops designated MSRP-12 and 9377-5 in Table 1.2.1 contain
molten~-salt-sampling devices. It was necessary to add 600 g of salt

to replenish the inventory and thus raise the fluid level to the normal
height in loop 9377-5 after 27 samples had been taken. The molten salt
was introduced into the pump bowl through the pump flange without
interruption of the flow or operation of the loop. Analyses of the
samples removed from these loops periodically are presented in

Section 2.2.

In-Pile Loops
The in-pile loop which was operated in the MIR during the previous

quarter was disassembled, and the cause of the partially plugged purge
line, which resulted in the release of activity, was determined. Oil
which leaked past the pump shaft seal and filled the oil trap on the
purge outlet line was polymerized by radiation, and the polymerized oil
plugged the outlet line. Chemical and metallographic analyses of the
fuel end container materials have not been completed.

The second in-pile loop was completed and inserted during the
MTR shutdown of April 27. Modifications were made to the internal

35

 
 

 

 

purge system to minimize the probability of purge line plugging. In
addition, changes were made to the external purge system which should
eliminate the possibility of a repetition of the activity release.
These changes included the installation of a charcoal trap in the
purge inlet line to prevent back-diffusion of fission ges into un-
shielded lines. A prototype in-pile pump identical to that installed
in the second loop has accumulated over 3600 hr of satisfactory

operation.

mixtures: salt 133 (LiF-BeF ,-ThF), , 71-16-13 mole %), salt 134 (LiF-
BeF,-ThF), -UF), , 62-36.5-1-0.5 mole %), and salt 136 (LiF-BeF,-UF) , 70
10-20 mole %). The results of these measurements are presented in

vhere H is the enthalpy (cal/g); Cy the heat capacity (cal/g.°C); and

T, the temperature (°c). The experimental enthalpy data for these three
mixtures, along with earlier results? for related mixtures, are summarized
in Fig. 1.3.1. It may be seen by comparing the results for salts 133

and 136 with the curve for mixture 130 (LiF-BeF -UF), 62-37-1 mole %)

that sltering the salt composition toward larger percentages of the
high-molecular-weight fluorides (ThF) and UF), ) causes a substantial
decrease in both the enthalpy and heat capacity (on a unit weight basis).
Replacement of the LiF in salt 126 (LiF-BeF,-UF), 53-46-1 mole %) with
NeF (mixture 123; NeF-BeF,-UF), 53-46-1 mole %) results in similer,

though smaller, reductions in the enthalpy and heat capacity. This

effect will be studied further in order ‘to establish a general correlation
for the prediction of enthalpies and heat capacities in the LiF-BeF,-

UF), -ThF, system.

Viscosity

The viscosities of salt mixtures 133 and 136 have been obtained
over the temperature range from 550 to 800°C with the "skirted" capillary
efflux viscometer previously described.” The viscometer cups used for
the measurements were those employed in the earlier studies with salts
130 and 134. Recalibration of these cups with the NaNO ,-NaNO,~KNO,
(40-7-53 wt %) mixture showed negligible changes in the kinematic

viscosity—~efflux time relation. The results, correlated in the form

b= a B/T ,

where u is the viscosity (centipoise), T is the temperature (°K), and A
and B are experimentally determined constants, are as follows:

Salt 133 A = 0.0526; B = 4838

Salt 136 A = 0.0489; B = 4847

The data are plotted in Fig. 1.3.2 and compared with data from

measurements of salts 123, 126, 130, and 134.3 The "high" results with
mixtures 123 and 126 will be rechecked with the new type of viscometer.
In Fig. 1.3.3, the data for salt 136 are compared with Mound Laboratory
results for the same mixture that were obtained with a Margules design

viscometer consisting of two concentric Inconel cylinders. The outer

of the two cylinders contained the fused salt and was rotated at a fixed
speed with reference to the inner stationary cylinder. The viscosity
was determined from the torque exerted on the inner cylinder. The
reason for the aiscrepancy t between the two sets of data has not yet been
established.

Surface Tension :
The surface tension of molten-selt mixture 134 was experimentally
determined using ‘the maximm-bubble-pressure technique. The results,

Heat~-Transfer Studies

Flow calibration of the system designed for determining surface
film formation in molten-salt systems by heat transfer coefficient
measurements has been completed. A Tygon-coupled mockup was used, and
water was the working fluid. The test unit is shown in Fig. 1.3.5, and
the key components are indicated. The over-all system pressure drop
was obtained with a 100-in. mercury manometer connected at the pump inlet
and outlet lines. The data indicate a pressure difference of about 48 psig
for a flow of 2.8 gpm. This corresponds to a test-section Reynolds
modulus of 11,000 at 1200°F with a salt such as mixture 130 (LiF-BeF -

UF), ; 62-37-1 mole %). Initial attempts to determine the flow rate vs

pump speed characteristic by a weight method were unsuccessful, and a
rotameter was used in the final calibration. A magnetic-pulse pickup
coupled with a Hewlett-Packard counter yielded the pump speed to within
+1 rpm over any 1lO-sec counting period. The characteristic curve obtained
was very nearly linear between 2000 and 6000 rpm, ranging from 1 to 3

gpm, respectively.

Design work is continuing on the system support structure to ensure
against buckling of the test sections due to thermal expansion and to
prevent electrical short-circuiting of the test-section heating currents.
Welding of system components is in progress.

Hydrodynamic Studies

The pressure drop through the sintered-metal-filled annulus of a
double-walled tube has been determined.’ A tube of this construction
has been proposed for use in stesm-generation systems associated with
molten-salt power reactors. It is hoped to provide good thermal contact
between the low-pressure primary salt and the high-pressure steam and
at the same time effectively isolate the two fluids in the event of a
wall failure. The sintered medium would be filled with static helium,
at an intermediate pressure, which would give an indication of a break
in either wall.

The results of this study of the flow of helium through two speci-
mens of double-walled Inconel tubing containing sintered Inconel of
different porosities are given in Fig. 1. 3 6. The correlating lines
can be expressed by the equations:

1.4. INSTRUMENTS AND CONTROLS

Molten-Salt-Fuel level Indicators

Visual and x-ray examination of a level probe used in the tests
described previously’ have been completed. The probe appears to be in
excellent condition, both mechanically and electrically. Disassembly
of the probe is in progress, and specimens have been sent to the
metallurgy department for corrosion examination.

Two new Inconel "I'"-tube-type level elements have been completed
and installed in test vessels. Two identical level-measuring systems
are now complete, and prefilling checkouts of the systems are in progress.

Fabrication of an INOR-8 level element and test vessel is approxi-
mately 80% complete.

INOR-8 High-Temperature Pressure Transmitters

An order was placed with the Taylor Instrument Company for six
INOR-8 pressure transmitters end indicating systems. The units are
scheduled for delivery in early June.

The transmitter body will be fabricated from INOR-8 plate. The
diaphragm material will be 0.005-in.-thick INOR-8 shim stock. The
manufacturer believes on the basis of preliminary tests that satisfactory
diaphragms can be made of this material. No unusual difficulties are
expected in the febrication of these units.

The six units will be composed of three having a range of O to 50
psig, and three with a range of O to 100 psig. All units are of the
pneumatic-indicator type.

salt 126 (LiF-BeF,~UF), 53-46-1 mole %) for one year at a hot-leg

hot- or cold-leg sections. A photomicrograph of a typical hot-leg
section from this loop is shown in Fig. 2.1.1. Further, no evidence
of mass transfer was found in examinations of cold-leg sections or
analyses of after-test salt samples. Results of salt analyses

(presented in Teble 2.1.2) indicate the level of metallic impurities

An examination of as-received specimens of tubing used for these loops
was subsequently made, and similar cracks were detected in these
specimens. A typical flaw is shown in Fig. 2.1.2. The flaws were
apparently not detected by x-ray inspection of the tubing before loop
fabrication. Therefore ultrasonic inspection of loop tubing is now
being utilized to supplement existing inspection practices.

Inconel Thermal-Convection Loops

Three of the four Inconel loops for which metallographic exami~
nation results have been recently obtained were operated for one year,
while the fourth was operated 1000 hr. The examination results are
summarized in Teble 2.1.3. As indicated, the hot legs of all the
Inconel loops operated for one year showed heavy intergranular void
formation. Of particular interest is loop 1182, which circulated salt
126 for one year at 1350°F. Examination of this loop revealed heavy
intergranular void formation to a depth of 15 mils, as may be seen in
Fig. 2.1.3. Chemical analyses of the salt showed no significant
changes in the impurity content. However, examination of the trap
area, which was the coldest part of the loop, revealed a large quantity
of metallic particles. These particles are being analyzed.

General Corrosion Studies

Penetration of Graphite by Molten Fluoride Salts

The problems associated with the use of unclad graphite as a
moderator in a molten-salt reactor system are being studied. The
possibility exists that fuel salts would enter the pore spaces in the
graphite and create problems associated with (1) reactor fuel inventory,
(2) hot spots, (3) effects from fission-gas release associated with
fuel in the pores, and (4) effects of thermal expsnsion of the salt -
as a result of thermal cycling of the reactor. The large volume change
which fluoride salts exhibit on melting could cause cracking or spalling
of the graphite if sufficient pressure were built up by salt entrapped

in pores. :

An experimental investigation has been started to determine under
what conditions salts will penetrate graphite and to ascertain the
physical damage that might occur in the graphite as a result of thermal
cycling. Both static-pressure and dynamic-pressure tests are being
conducted.

Static-pressure penetration tests have been made with graphite-
molten salt systems at 150 psia and 1300°F. In preparation for these
tests, graphite specimens were partially degassed by heating at 2372%
for 5 hr in a vecuum of <4 ux and then cooled to room temperature in
a pure argon atmosphere. When assembling the apparatus, the graphite
was exposed to room atmosphere for approximately 5 hr. The apparatus
was then evacuated to < 12 # and held at 572°F for 15 hr to remove
lightly adsorbed contaminants.

In test, the graphite specimens were completely submerged in molten
salts at 1300°F, and a 150-psi pressure was spplied for 100 hr by using
an argon blanket gas. After the tests the specimens were examined for
penetrations of salt into the graphite by using radiographic, metallo-
graphic, and/or chemical analysis techniques. The specimens were also
weighed to detect weight changes.

Both TSF and CCN graphite were tested individuelly in LiF-BeF ,-UF),
(62-37-1 mole %, fuel 130). Macroscopic examination of radiographs
of these graphite specimens did not reveal any penetration by fuel 130.
There was essentially no weight gain (<0.01%) of the TSF graphite
specimen, but there was a weight gain of approximately 1% for the CCN
grephite specimen. Metallographic examinstions and chemical analyses
are being made to determine the location of the fuel 130 and/or reaction
products in the CCN graphite. The TSF grade will be examined in like
manner.

A static-pressure penetration test at 1300°F was also made with
fuel mixture 30 ( NeF-ZrF) -UF),, 50-46-4 mole %) and CCN-grade graphite
to assist in evaluating testing techniques. Radiogrephic examination of
the graphite specimen used in this test indicated that the fuel had

56
 

 

 

[1]

"

or

penetrated it throughout. The weight gain of the specimen indicated
that 29% of the calculated pore volume of the graphite had been filled.
Additional static-pressure penetration tests are planned using fuel
mixture 130 with TSF, AGOT, and ATJ grades of graphite to evaluate

the effects of pressure and temperature on penetration.

A dynamic-pressure penetration test apparatus has been devised
vhich allows the movement of fuel around the graphite specimen to wash
awey reaction products that might form at the graphite surface and thus
plug pore spaces. This test equipment, which is further discussed
later in this chapter under 'Welding and Brazing Studies," is designed
to apply pressures up to 350 psia on the fuel side of the graphite
while the opposite side is being evacuated.

The CCN-graphite specimen that was penetrated by fuel 30, as
mentioned sbove, was thermally cycled to determine whether thermal
expansion of the fuel 30 in the graphite pore spaces would cause
cracking or spalling of the graphite. During the thermal cycle, thermo-
couples indicated temperature chenges from room temperature to 1436°F
near the outer surface and room temperature to T19°F at the central
axis of the specimen within a 3-min period. In the first two minutes
of the cooling part of the cycle, the 1436°F outer surface temperature
was lowered to 842°F end the T79°F central temperature was lowered to
752°F. Radiographic and macroscopic examinations of the grsphite
specimen at room temperature did not reveal eny damage to it.

Since the volume expansions. of fuels. 30 and 130 from room temper-
ature to their. melting temperatures are 17% and 114, respectively, the
lack of damage to the graphite suggests that ‘some penetration of molten
fluoride salts. into the . grephite ‘pore spaces might be tolerated. The
specimen will be subjected to edi tional thermal cycles, end other
penetration. end thermel-cycling “tests of- various types « of graphite and

Uranium Precipitation from Molten Fluoride Selts in Contact with

Graphite
The fuel mixture LiF-BeF,-UF) (62-37-1 mole %) was reported

previously’ to have precipitated uo, in tests in which the fuel mixture
was contained in graphite crucibles at 1300°F. The graphite-salt

' systems were tested in evacuated Inconel containers, and the precipitate
wes observed by using radiographic techniques. In control tests under
similar conditions with two different batches of fuel mixtures in Inconel
containers without graphite crucibles, no uo, precipitate was detected
by radiographic examination.

To assist in determining the role of graphite in causing uranium
precipitation from graphite-fuel systems, a set of five tests was run
with different quantities of graphite and different salt-to-graphite
contact ereaes. The tests were made concurrently at 1300°F , and the
fuel mixture used in each test was from the same batch. Graphite,
grade CCN, was used that had been machined and cleaned by sonic meens
in ethyl alcohol.

The test setups used are illustrated in Fig. 2.1.4, and the tests
are described below. In test A, the fuel was tested in the absence of
graphite in order to test both the quality of the fuel and the assembly
methods used in fabricating all the test equipment. In test B, the
fuel was in contact with a large ares of a large quantity of graphite
in order to establish a reference for uranium precipitation from the
fuel; the dimensions and configuration of the test duplicated those of
the standard graphite—fuel compatibility tests. In test C, the fuel
wes tested in the presence of, but not in direct contact with, a large
quentity of graphite to determine whether the uranium precipitation
wes caused by degassing of the graphite. In test D, the fuel was tested
in contact with & small area of & large quantity of graphite to determine,
in conjunction with the results of test B, whether the contact surface-
to~volume ratio for the graphite and fuel affected the quantity of
wranium precipitation from the fuel. In test E, the fuel was tested

in contact with a small area of ea small quentity of graphite to
determine, in conjunction with the results of test D, whether the
quantity of graphite affected the quantity of uranium precipitation
from the fuel.

Radiographic examinations of each of the test setups at total |
sccumilated test times of 5, 10, and 100 hr were made. No uranium
precipitation was observed for the control, test A (Fig. 2.1.4). A
small amount of uranium precipitation occurred in test E. A moderate
end epproximately equal amount of uranium precipitation was found in
each of the other three tests. These results support the conclusion
arrived at previously” that the uranium precipitation observed in
fuel 130 was the result of the fuel reacting with oxygen supplied by
degassing of the graphite.

Tests are in progress to determine whether a suitable flush can
degas the graphite to such a degree that it will contain fuel 130°
without causing uranium to precipitate from the fuel.

Thermal-Convection-Ioop Tests of Brazing Alloys in Fuel 130

A scheduled 1000-hr test of Inconel and INOR-8 lap joints brazed
with various alloys and exposed to fuel 130 in the hot leg of a thermal-
convection loop has been completed. Similar tests scheduled for 5,000-
end 10,000-hr periods are continuing. The configuration of these
thermal-convection loops and the manner in which the brazing alloys
are incorporated in them was described previously.> The brazing alloys

tested were:

Coast Metals No. 52 89% Ni-5% Si-h% B-2% Fe
Coast Metals No. 53 81% Ni-8% Cr-4% si—i% B—3% Fe

The temperature of the circulating salt in the region of the test
specimens was 1300°F.

Metallographic examination showed that all the brazing alloys had
good flowebility on both Inconel and INOR-8 base metals. There was a
tendency for the formation of diffusion voids in the fillets of the
joints brazed with the gold—nickel alloy. The General Electric No. 81
alloy wes heavily attacked on Inconel base materiel. Coast Metals Nos.
52 and 53 were depleted at the fillet surface to a depth of 1 to 2 mils,
Some slight cracking of the alloys occurred at the brazing alloy—~base
metal interface. Pure copper showed good corrosion resistence and no

cracking.
Thermal=-Convection~-Loop Tests of the Compatibility of INOR-8, Graphite,
and Fuel 130

Fuel mixture 130 (1iF-BeF,-UF),, 62-37-1 mole %) was circulated in
an INOR-8 thermal-convection loop containing a 10=in. tube of TSF
graphite in the hot leg in order to ascertain whether the graphite would
cause carburization of the INOR-8. The loop operated for L0OOO hr with
a hot-leg temperature of 1300°F.

Metallographic examination of a loop section adjacent to the
grephite insert revealed that the carbide precipitates in the grain
boundaries were slightly larger near the salt-metal surface than
throughout the rest of the specimen ( Fig. 2.1.5); however, similar
precipitates have been observed in INOR-8 tubing from corrosion loop
tests with no graphite present.

Microhardness measurements of the ares 2 mils from the salt-metal

surface were of ‘the ‘same magni tude as those observed in the rest of

the specimen. These values: renged rendomly from 160 to 180 DPH.

A carbon content of O. 037% was found by chemicel enalyses of
two ‘successive Semil layers ‘taken at the. inner surface of the INOR-8
tubing. An additional series of layers to a depth of 35 mils was
enalyzed and found “to contain a range of” carbon values from 0.01% to

0. 026%. Consequently, ‘these different values are not considered to

be significent, especially in view of the large quantities of inclusions

Mechanical Properties of INOR-8

Creep Tests
Most of the creep tests presently being conducted in fused salts

are low-stress, long-time tests. The results of these tests will pro-
vide accurate data in terms of stress, total strain, and creep rates
for INOR-8 at times in excess of 10,000 hr. None of the test specimens
failed during the past quarter and therefore no data are available to
report. These experiments are being run at 1100 and 1200°F.

Fatigue Studies
The fatigue properties of INOR-8 at 1100 and 1500°F are being

studied at Battelle Memorial Institute under a subcontract from the
Metallurgy Division. A rotating-beam-type of test is used at
frequencies of 100 and 3000 rpm. The initial results reported were
for the 100 rpm and 1500°F conditions. The data are summarized below:

Stress (psi) Cycles to Failure
15 x 10° 8 x 105
ko 3h x 103
35 160 x 10°
30 730 x 10°
30 930 x 103
27 72 x 10°
Co (aiscontinued)

' Thus, the stress to produce fatigue failure in 1 x 10% cycles is
slightly over 29,500 psi. Under similar test conditions, the stress
to produce fatigue failure of Inconel inl x 106 cycles is about 18,000
psi. ’ :

Shrinkage Characteristics of: INORS
A certain peculiarity. in the behavior of INOR-8 has been noted
almost ‘since the start of the current testing program. In creep tests,

there is an initial period during which virtually no creep occurs. This
is followed by normal creep. In relaxation tests, the load must be
increased during the early stages in order to maintain a constant strain.
These observations are important, since at low stresses the effects are
manifest over a thousand or more hours and the results in terms of creep
rate and total strain vs time measurements are attenuated.

The behavior pattern suggested that the metal might be contracting

‘a8 & result of metallurgical instabilities. Isothermal dilatometry

measurements indicate that there is contraction in certain heats of
INOR-8 but not in others, notably SP-16 and SP-19. Metallographic
exeminations showed that those specimens which contracted contained
meny large sreas of second phase material. The stable heats had equi-
axed grain structures with fine precipitates concentrated mainly in the
grain boundaries. There appear to be no significant differences in
either the major or minor alloying constituents in the heats examined,
except for the carbon content. However, stable heats have been found
that range from a special low-carbon melt up to heats containing carbon
in excess of 0.1%. The specimens which contracted had carbon contents
which fell within this range. Currently the contraction phenomenon is
being studied by means of resistivity measurements to determine temper=
eture~dependence and reaction rates. This study will be continued, since
ell heats have shown a plateau in the creep and relaxation values.

‘exhibits a tendency to embrittle in the temperature range between 1000

It is concluded from this group of tests and from the previous
tests??? of specimens aged for 500, 1000, 2000, and 5000 hr that INOR-8
does not exhibit any embrittling tendencies that can be attributed to
high-temperature instability.

Triplex Heat Exchanger Tubing

Work is continuing on the development of techniques for fabricating
e heat exchenger tube made up of two concentric tubes with a porous
annulus between to permit the passage of a gas for leak detection. The
materials of construction presently being investigated are a porous
nickel core cled on the outer and inner surfaces with Inconel or INOR-8.
Two methods of incorporating the porous core into the annular space of
the concentric tubes are being considered: first, tamping loose nickel
powder into the annulus and developing a porous core bonded to the
outer and inner tubes by suitable drawing and sintering operations; and,
second, bonding a prefabricated porous core to the outer and inner tubes
by suitable drawing and sintering operations. Results obtained by the
first method were described previously.’ Because of difficulties
encountered with an oxide layer being formed at the core-to-cladding
interface and causing poor bonding, this method of febrication hes
been discontinued in favor of the second method.

Porous nickel sheet is aveileble from Micro Metallic Corp. in
four common grades, which differ in mean pore opening, as follows:

The sheet material has a density of approximately 50 to 60% of
theoretical, end 1/16-in.-thick stock cen be rolled into a 3/4-in.-OD
tube. Twenty-five feet of both grades E and G rolled into tubular
shape have been ordered for cladding studies.

An attempt is presently being made to clad with Inconel a small,
sample, porous nickel strip received from Micro Metallic. The as-
received strip was annealed for 1 hr at 1800°F and then bent around
the outside of a 0.625-in.-0D Inconel tube. The porous nature of the
resulting ring can be seen in Fig. 2.1.7, which shows an enlarged
view of the surface. Channeled spacers were tack-welded to the Inconel
tube adjecent to the porous ring to prevent slippage of the ring
during drawing and to provide a means of filling the annular space.

The assembly is shown in Fig. 2.1.8. An Inconel tube was placed over
the assembly and the resulting triplex assembly was cold drawn from
1.000 in. OD x 0.500 in. ID to 0.855 in. OD x 0.468 in. ID. The tri-
plex assembly is now being prepared for sintering to promote bonding

of the porous ring to the Inconel cladding. A vacuum will be maintained
in the annulus of the triplex assembly during sintering. An evaluation
of the porosity and bond between ring end cladding will subsequently

be made.

Similar cladding experiments are to be performed by Superior
Tube Co. on Subcontract No. 1112. It is anticipated that these results
will help determine the feasibility of fabrication of a triplex tube

by a commercial vendor.

INOR-8 materiel up to 0.100 in. thick, and additional procedures are
being quelified for thicker sections in accordance with the methods
prescribed by the ASME Boiler Code 8

Several lengths of 5-in. sched-40 pipe have been fabricated from
1/4-in.~thick plate, and a welding procedure will be developed which
will be appliceble over the thickness range 1/8 to 1/2 in. A welding
procedure for 1/2-in. plate will also be developed, which will be
appliceble for thicknesses up to 1 in. The tests to be conducted
include reduced-section tension, side-bend, face-bend, and root-bend
tests, as well as radiographic and metallographic examinations.

It is expected that these welding procedures will be extremely
useful in febricating containment vessels and test components from
INOR-8. These procedures will serve also as an essential supplement
to the mechanical property data which are being accumilated for the
presentation of INOR-8 as a case before the ASME Boller and Pressure
Vessel Code Committee.

Mechanical Properties of INOR-8 Welds

Studies are continuing in an effort to improve the high-temperature
ductility of INOR-8 weld metal. These include the investigation of
techniques to deoxidize and purify weld filler metal during the casting
of original ingots. One promising method involves the use of a vacuum-
melted basic charge with additions of small quantities of aluminum,
titanium, mangenese, silicon, boron, and magnesium. Several different
heats of weld metal containing these and other additions have been cast
and febricated into weld wire. Analyses of these heats are presented
in Table 2.1.5, and analyses of commercial materials are included
for comparison. The mechanical property values obtained to date for
these materiels are surmarized in Teble 2.1.6, and properties of other
materials are included for comparison. The results of the mechanical
property tests on these filler metals will permit an evaluation of the
relative merits of the various deoxidation and purification practices.

Fabrication of Apparatus for Testing the Compatibility of Molten Salts

and Graphite
Equipment was fabricated which will be used by the General Corrosion

Group to study molten salt penetration of graphite in a dynamic, high-
pressure system. Before this apparatus could be fabricated, it was
necessary to develop a method of attaching an Inconel tube to a hollow
cylindrical graphite specimen and thereby forming s leaktight connection.
This was accomplished by brazing with a commercielly availsble braze
alloy composed of silver, titanium, and copper that was found to wet
vacuum~degassed graphite.

The large difference in thermal expansion of the graphite and the
brazing alloy caused some shear cracking in the graphite. However,
metallographic sectioning of sample Joints indicated that the cracks
were rather limited in length, and pressure testing of the completed
joint with air indicated no leakage other than that associated with
the inherent porosity of the base graphite.

The graphite-to-Inconel assembly prior to brazing is shown in
Fig. 2.1.9, and the completed specimen is shown in Fig. 2.1.10. The
completed Inconel test rig with associated entry, drain, and purge lines
is shown in Fig. 2.1.11.

occurrence of the unusual ternary solid solution in this system provides

temperatures than the corresponding thorium compounds. Accordingly, the
phase diagrams of ternary systems of an alkali fluoride with BeF, and
ThF), are useful as guides to selections of converter-reactor fuel mixtures
from the otherwise extremely complex quaternary systems containing UF), .

Progress toward completion of the phase diagram for the system NaF-
BeF ,~ThF), is shown in Fig. 2.2.2. The composition of the single ternary
compound occurring in the system and the location of the boundary curve
separating the primary phase fields of ThF), and this ternary compound
have not been determined. The compositions that show the maximum solubility
of THF), at 550°C are NaF-BeF,-ThF) (76-10-14 mole %) and NeF-BeF,-ThF)
(50-38.5-11.5 mole %).

The System NaF-ThF, -UF,

The identity and approximate locations of the primary phases in the
system NeF-ThF) -UF), have been determined. Because of the solubility of
UF), in compounds such as 4NeF . THF), , NaF +ThF) , 3NaF.2ThF), and TNeF -6ThF), ,
there are no phase fields for pure binary thorium compounds in the ternary
disgram.

The System SnF =H) HE

The SnF o~NH) IF, system was investigated because of its potentiali-
ties as a strongly oxidizing, low-melting solvent for reprocessing fuels.
Liquidus temperatures were noted by visually observing precipitation
upon cooling. At temperatures higher than 150°¢, the solution bubbled
and formed a scum which not only interfered with observations but also
changed the composition of the melt. Therefore reliable data were
obtained only in the range O to 40% SnF,. The compound NH, HF, melts at
125°C, and a 15 mole % addition of SnF, lowers the melting point to
sbout 100°C. Further additions of SF,
ature to 150°C for the mixture containing 40 mole % Sn.

Heating a mixture of 35 mole % NH, HF,, and 65 mole % SnF,, resulted
in considerable evolution of gas and gave a melt with a liquidus temper-
ature of 240°C, which is well above the melting point of SnF, (218%).

The solidified product gave a simple but unidentified x-ray diffraction
pattern. Thus it appears that the sample was predominantly a new
compound. Petrographic results confirmed the presence of a new compound
and showed that still another unidentified phase was present to the
extent of about 10%.

Solubility of PuF. in Converter Fuels
Interest in the possibility of converting a to the fissionable
pu in molten-fluoride-salt fuels led to measurements of the solu-
bility of PuF, in the mixture LiF-BeF~UF), (70-10-20 mole %). The
apparatus and techniques were described previously.’ For the'first
solubility determination, weighed amounts of LiF, BeF UF), end PuF,
were melted directly in the filtration apparatus and heated to a maximum

38

temperature of 716°C in a mixed atmosphere of argon and HF. The mixture
was then cooled and equilibrated at 562 to 567°C for 105 min before
filtering at 567°C. Three other filtrates were obtained from a melt
that was pretreated by heating LiF, BeF,,
with NH) FHF added to prevent hydrolysis, at e maximum temperature of
725°C for 30 min and cooling in an argon atmosphere. A plot of the
data in Table 2.2.2 as the log of molar concentration of Fuk,
the reciprocal of the absolute temperature indicated that the solu-
bility value obtained at 567°C was about 0.15 mole % too high to fit
the straight line through the points for pretreated melts. The reason
for this slight discrepancy is not known. All the FuF, solubilities
obtained in IiF-BeF,-UF, (70-10-20 mole %) are higher than those

Experiments have shown that the exchange

is an analogue of exchange (1). Thus CXF, (1abeled), which has
desirable tracer characteristics, can be used in exchange (2) to

approximate the behavior of SmF_ in exchange (1).

3
A proposed method of salt purification utilizing exchange (1)
would be to pass the salt through an isothermal bed of solid CeFy to

lower the Sof’ content and then to lower the temperature of the effluent
salt to decrease the total rare earth content. To determine the
feasibility of the method, information is required on the rate of
exchange. The first exploratory rate test was conducted at 500°C with
an agitated CeF,-LiF-BeF, melt (1500 ppm CeF, 62 mole % LiF, 38 mole

% BeF,) to which an excess of LaF, was atta Within 1 min, the CeF

content was decreased to 400 ppm; within 5 min the system was at

3

equilibrium (300 ppm CeF;) with respect to exchange (2). The second
test employed a lli-in. horizontal column of 3/4-in. tubing packed with
100 g of +18 mesh LaF. The packed column was charged at 300°C with
LiF-BeF,, (62-38 mole %) containing 1000 ppm CeFs, and 12 g of melt,
not counting the holdup volume, was transferred through the LaF, at

3
18 gpm with a pressure drop of 3 psi. The CeF, content of the effluent

ranged from 80 to 30 ppm. Attempts to cont ime the experiment at a
later time with the same packing gave evidence that the liquid was
bypassing the LaF (s) and thet future tests with vertical columns
should give better performance.
Chemical Reactions of Oxides with Fluorides in Molten-Fluoride-Salt

The chemical reactions of oxides with UF), in molten fluoride
solvents have indicated that uranium can be separated from fission

products by fractional oxide precipitation. As mentioned previously,

BeO and water vapor appesr to be desirable precipitating agents because
they do not introduce extraneous constituents into BeF, mixtures.
Investigations have continued on the removal of uranium from solution
by reaction of UF), with BeO in a column-extraction process and on the

fractional precipitation of uranium with water vapor.

Extraction of Uranium with BeO. The reaction of UF), with BeO to
produce uo, has been studied in several experiments’? Observations
of the reastion in a packed column show several interesting characteris-~
tics. A eutectic mixture of LiF-KF (50-50 mole %) containing 1 mole %
UF), was twice passed unidirectionally through a small column packed
with extruded BeO (1/16 in. in dismeter and 1/8 in. long) at 600°C.
The column contained approximately three times the amount of Bel
required for converting the UF), to vo,,. During the first pass, 34.6%
of the uranium was removed from 2 kg of liquid mixture at an average
flow rate of 700 gpm under a pressure drop of 5 psi. A second pass
removed an additional 30% of the initial uranium from solution. How-
ever, the average flow rate during the second extraction was consider-
ably slower (30 gpm), since a pressure drop of approximately 15 psi
developed. A third extraction was not attempted.

Calculations based on the experimental data show that 16% of the
beryllium oxide in the column reacted with UF), It is interesting to
note, however, that only 18% of the reacted beryllium was present in
the column effluent at the completion of the experiment. A similar
retention of Bef, probebly on the surface of the BeO pellets, was
previously noted in the. conversion of ZF), to 2x0.

In future experiments, the effectiveness of Be0 beds for removing
lover « concentrations of uranium from molten fluoride mixtures will be
investigated. :

of water vapor with UF), has been demonstrated.o In reprocessing
molten fluoride reactor fuels, however, the separation of uranium

from the fission~product rare earths would be a primary requisite.

An experiment has shown that the reaction of water vapor with CeFy

in LiF-BeF, (63-37 mole %) is too slow for detection by a fairly
sensitive radiochemical tracer technique (precision, < +0.2%). In

two subsequent experiments, water vapor was allowed to react at 600°C
with UF) (1 mole %) in LiF-BeF, (63-37 mole %) containing 1.25 wt %
CeF. In each case, Uo, was formed without any detectable preeipitation
of Ce 04 or BeO. The uranium concentration in solution at the stoichi-
ometric point of the reaction was on the order of 100 ppm in each
experiment.

The sharpness of this separation is very favorable from the
standpoint of reprocessing schemes, and it points to a method for
removing uranium without using fluorine. It also leads to a method
for removing uranium and thorium simultaneously that would permit the
rare earths to be selectively precipitated in another step that could
be followed by redissolution of the uranium and the thorium in
reclaimed barren solvent.

An experiment for studying the reaction of water vapor with UF),
dissolved in LiF-KF (50-50 mole %) indicated a much lower rate of
reaction as a result of strong complexing of both 0 and a ions
in the melt. A negligible quantity of HF was evolved, and x-ray
diffraction examinations of filtrate samples taken from the reaction
mixture showed the presence of KF 20,0. Treatment with 8500 meq of
water resulted in the precipitation of 64 meq of uranium from solution
and the evolution of 30 meq of HF. A comparison with the reaction of
‘water vepor with UF) dissolved in LiF-NaF (60-40 mole %) is planned

as a further study.

Gas Solubilities in Molten Fluoride Salts

Solubility of Neon in LiF-BeF,

The investlgation of the solubility of neon in a mixture of LiF-BeF,
(64-36 mole %) has been completed at 500, 600, 700, and 800°C covering
the pressure range of 0 to 2 atm. As in all previous studies of the
solubility of noble gases in molten fluoride salts, Henry's law is
obeyed, and the solubility increases with temperature. The solubility
decreases with increasing atomic weight of gas, and the enthalpy of
solution increases.

Henry's law constants for this system are (3.09 + 0.09) x 1078,
(4.63 + 0.01) x 107, (6.80 + 0.09) x 107, and (9.01 + 0.15) x 1073
moles of He per and of melt per atm at 500, 600, 700, and 800°c, respec-
tively. A heat of solution of 5880 cal/mole was calculated from the

temperature dependence of these constants.

Solubility of CO, in NaF-BeF,

The solubility of CO, in molten NaF-BeF, (57-43 mole %) has been
examined at 500, 600, 700, and 800°C at pressures from O to 2 atm. The
experimental data illustrate the linear dependence of solubility with
saturating pressures. Henry's law constants, K, at these temperatures
are (7.93 + 0.36) x 1078, (7.05 + 0.14) x 10%, (8.32 + 0.08) x 108
moles of co, per em of melt per atm. Of all the gas solubility data
for molten salt systems obtained to date, these are the first to show
a nonlinear log K versus 1/T plot. A minimum is observed on this plot
in the vieinity of 600°C. =

Chemistry of the Corrosion Process

Samples from Operating Loops

Periodic sampling of the melts in forced-circulation corrosion-
test loops, as described in the previous report, 1° has continued. One
loop is fabricated from INOR-8 and the other from Inconel. Both loops
were charged with the salt composition LiF-BeF~ThF, -UF) ( 62-36.5-1-0.5
mole %) containing about 400 ppm of chromium, and the maximum wall
temperature is 1300°F.

The chromium concentration in the INOR-8 loop (MSRP No. 12) reached
a plateau at about 550 ppm after about 1200 hr of operation and has
maintained this level for the last 1000 hr. In the Inconel loop
(9377-5) the chromium concentration in the salt rose gradually during
the first 400 hr of operation to a value of 550 ppm. The increase
was more rapid than in the INOR-8 loop but was uniform. However, after
the first 400 hr, the chromium concentration began increasing very
rapidly, as indicated below:

Chromium
Time Concentration
(hr) (ppm)
500 800
650 950
800 1100
1700 2000

Since sample removals decreased the quantity of salt in the loop,
more salt was added after 2250 hr to permit further monitoring. Samples
taken before and after the addition of 0.6 kg of fresh salt showed 2100
and 1900 ppm of chromium, respectively. The loop was allowed to circu-
late for three days (72 hr) and again sampled, and 2050 ppm of chromium
was found; after 2600 hr, 2350 ppm of chromium was present. The latter
value may represent an approach to a steady-state level, but the chromium

concentration is considerably higher than was expected in the absence
of oxidizing impurities.

Radioactive Tracer Analyses for Iron in Molten Fluoride Salts

Most investigations of corrosion behavior depend on accurate
analyses at low dilution of Fe'' and other structurel metal ions. For
example, the validity of chromium diffusion experiments in systems
consisting of a molten salt and a chromium alloy depends on the purity
of the salt with respect to NiF, and FeF
from chromium; for example,

ot Both compounds form CF,

FeF, + or’ CrF, + Fe

Experimental equilibrium constants show that the equilibrium concen-
tration of FeF, in the presence of chromium should be too low to detect.
However, analyses obtained in the diffusion experiments indicated that
FeF,
NeF-ZrF) (53-47 mole %) which hed been in contact with Inconel ([c°]=
0.16 wt fraction). This anomaly suggested that finely divided iron
might be passing through the sample stick filters under certain con-
ditions. To investigate this possibility, 800 ppm of labeled FeF, was
dissolved in a nickel container filled with NeF-ZrF) (53-47 mole %)
solvent and then completely removed from solution by reduction with

was present at concentrations ranging from 100 to 200 ppm in

zirconium. Standard counting procedures verified that no labeled Felt
or iron was present in filtered portions of the melt after the zirconium
addition, although an average wet analysis of 205 ppm of iron was
reported for the same material. It seems definite that currently used
procedures result in’ misleading results from wet chemical analysis and
that the presence of iron in. ‘the melt as sampled is not the explanation.
The discrepancy is being investigated.

Activities in Metal Alloys : EN

co The measurements of ‘thermodynantc activities for. nickel in the
Ni-N10 system, as. obtained from an- ‘electrode concentration cell with
a molten electrolyte, have been delayed by a. series of experiments

designed to test the approach to equilibrium obtained by various
annealing procedures for the electrodes. These experiments have not
given definite results. Another series of experiments has established:
that the results are not being invalidated by thermoelectric potentials.

Vapor Pressures of Molten Salts

The lowering of the vapor pressure of CsF (vapor pressure, 83 mm :
Hg) at 1000°C by 20 mole % additions of alkaline earth fluorides has
been measured as part of a study of the effect of cation size and charge
on the thermodynamic properties of fluoride melts. The smallest cation
Mg't (radius, 0.788) gives a lowering of 30 mm Hg; cat (radius, 1.068),
26 mm Hg; and Ba'' (radius, 1.438) , 18 mm Hg, following the expected
order. Freezing-point depressions that reflect the same effects are

also being measured.

Permeability of Graphite by Molten Fluoride Salts

 

Permeability tests on various types of reactor-grade graphite with
molten fluoride salts have continued. In the routine procedure for
impregnating graphite with a molten salt, the graphite samples were
degassed under vacuum at 900 to 950°C end then treated with a molten
salt, such as LiF-MgF, (67.5-32.5 mole %), while still held under
vacuum. After the graphite samples were completely covered with salt
the vacuum was relieved and a pressure of 15 psig of helium was applied
to the system for 48 hr. At the end of 48 hr, the pressure was
relieved, and the molten selt was transferred away from the graphite.

“In previous tests, graphite rods 3-in. long and 1/4, 1/2, and 1 in.
in diameter had been used. For routine testing, l-in.-dia rods have
“been adopted. |
~~ By using welded container vessels, shortening vacuum lines, and

"using extreme care in assembly, the efficiency of impregnation has been
increased, as indicated by an average weight gain of 12.5% compared with
8.5% in earlier runs on reactor-grade TSF and AGOT graphite samples.

88
 

 

The objectives of the current exploratory tests are to determine
(1) how effective salt impregnation of graphite is in preventing or
decreasing penetration of possible molten-~salt reactor fuels at the
maximm reactor temperature, (2) the degree of penetration into untreated
graphite of typical reactor fuels under forced impregnation (vacuum
and pressure) conditions at the maximum reactor temperature (1250°F),
(3) the degree of penetration of typical reactor fuels into untreated
graphite under normal reactor operating conditions (in a 1000-hr test
in a circulating-salt system), and (4) the distribution of the main
fuel components (uranium, thorium, and beryllium) in the graphite when
penetration occurs.

Samples of three special types of graphite were obtained from the
National Carbon Company for testing. These were identified as follows:
ATJ-82, ATL-82, and AGOT-82. The number 82 after each type refers to
a special process used by National Carbon to make impervious graphite.
Because of the geometry of the available samples, the rods were machined
to 3/4 in. OD and 3 in. long. Attempts to impregnate these rods of
special graphite with LiP-MgF, in the usual manner gave the following
results. The ATJ-82 graphite showed a loss in weight of 0.9%. The
ATL-82 graphite showed a loss in weight of about 0.1%. The AGOT-82
graphite showed a gain of 2.0%, and samples of TSF graphite, included
for comparison, gained 5.5%.

The rods were then subjected to a 1000-hr soaking test at 1250°F
under a static helium pressure ‘of 1 psig in stirred LiF-BeF o=UF), (62-
37-1 mole %). The ATJ-82 gained 0. 2% in weight, the ATL-82 gained
0.4%, the AGOT-82 geined 2.19, and the TSF. gained 2.8%. These gains
are based on the weights of the rods before end after the 1000-hr test
and-do’ not include the forced-impregnation gains or losses.

To determine’ the penetration of uranium and beryllium into these
rods, successive 1/32-1n. layers were machined from the rods and sub-
“mitted “for chemical - analysis. - ‘When the’ rods became too small to machine
without breaking, “the ‘ends vere cut off end the center section was
submitted for snalysis. Typical results ere listed in Table 2.2.3.

The cut numbers were assigned so that cut No. 1 was the first cut taken
on the rod, cut No. 10 was the last cut taken, and "center" indicates |
the remaining center section, which was also submitted for analysis.

It appears that the ATL-82 and ATJ-82 grapites are resistant to
forced impregnation with LiF-MgF,, salt and are considerably resistant
to penetration by a typical reactor fuel. The most startling observa-
tion, however, is the unexpectedly high concentration of uranium in the
center section of the ATL-82 and ATJ-82 rods. Subsequent long-term
soaking tests of reactor-grade graphites TSF and AGOT in a fuel mixture
of the same LiF-BeF ,-UF), composition also showed disproportionately
high uranium concentrations in the center in every case. Efforts are
being made to determine the mechanism of this phenomenon and to further
verify it.

An experiment was carried out to determine whether untreated TSF
graphite could be forcibly impregnated with the LiF-BeF ,-UF), (63-37-1
mole %) fuel mixture of current interest by using vacuum and pressure
techniques at the maximum reactor temperature of 1250°F. Six TSF |
graphite rods were used in this experiment, and weight gains that
ranged from 0.1% to 1.85% were obtained. To determine depth of

penetration, these rods were machined, as previously described, and

the machine cuttings plus the center section were submitted for analysis.
In all cases, the bulk of the salt penetration was in the first and
second machine cuttings. However, it was noted again that, in general,
the center sections contained several times (occasionally 200 times)
more uranium than the last cutting taken at about 1/4 in. from the

center.

Radiation Damage Studies

INOR-8 Thermal Convection Loop for Operation in the LITR

The in-pile thermal-convection loop for testing fused-salt fuel
in INOR-8 tubing in the LITR was operated in preliminary tests outside
the reactor, and satisfactory circulation of the salt (LiF-BeF,-UF), |
62-37-1 mole %) was obtainéd. Radiography of the fuel tube after these
tests demonstrated that no opaque material had deposited at the bottom,
as in a previous loop test. Tt

Thermocouples have been installed on the fuel tube of this loop,
and the air annulus tube has been assembled around the loop. Detailed
examinations of the thermocouples were made, and complete records of
their condition, including individual photomicrographs of each thermo-
couple, are avallable. This examination record will be used to correlate
thermocouple performance during operation in the reactor with the
initial conditions of the thermocouples. The information obtained will
be useful in the construction of future in-pile loops.

Modifications were made: in the cooling-air control system at the
reactor to provide for individual temperature control of various portions
of the Loop. After resistance-heating elements have been installed and
the loop inserted in. the outer can, the loop will be operated in the

LITR.

Preparation of Purified Materials

Purification, Transfer, and Service Operations

The processing of small batches of various molten-fluoride-salt
compositions for use in corrosion tests, physical property studies,
and small-scale component testing decreased considerably during the
first half of this quarter. However, demands have gradually increased
during the past month, and a normsl rate of operation is now being
maintained. A total of 35 kg of mixtures not containing beryllium
and 85 kg of beryllium-containing mixtures was processed during the
quarter. Transfer and service operations to assist engineering groups
in handling high-temperature fluids were continued at a slightly

increased rate.

Fuel Replenishment Tests

A simple device for testing the proposed fuel sampling and
enriching mechenism’® was constructed and tested. The device employs
two salt storage pots interconnected by a transfer line, with the
enriching device on one pot and the sampling device on the other pot.
The molten salt is moved alternately from one pot to the other with
semiautomatic controls by using differential gas pressures.

Solid, cast, UF), fuel slugs weighing 40 g each were introduced to
the dissolution pot in a copper basket and the salt, LiF-BeF, (50-50
mole %), was cycled between the two pots. The rate of dissolution was
measured by withdrawing and weighing the amount of UF), remaining;
samples of the solution were also taken for chemical analysis.

A 40-g slug of UF) dissolved in 20 cycles (1 1/2 hr), but it was
not completely dissolved in 15 cycles (1 hr). This rate of solution

Pure Compounds Prepared with Molten Ammonium Bifluoride

Molten smmonium bifluoride (mp, 125°C) has served as a reactent
for preparing both simple and complex fluorides, 13» 1+ Recent trials
show that commercial chromic oxide is not noticeably attacked by molten
ammonium bifluoride. Magnesium oxide is converted into NH) MeF vhich
can be decomposed into pure magnesium fluoride. Beryllium oxide
(calcined at 900 °C) is also converted to an ammonium complex.

When commercial "Co 0, " powder is treated for 1 hr with molten
ammonium bifluoride, a small amount of oxide is left unchanged. The
reaction product has an x-ray diffraction pattern somewhat shifted from
that of KCoF

Nickel oxide was found to be more resistant to attack than "Co 05.
A l-hr treatment left almost all the oxide unreacted.

The oxides GeO, uo, Tho, and CeO, seem to react completely with
molten ammonium bifluoride, but the products have not yet been identified.

reported to react with moist air to form yellow oxyfluorides. >

| For all the reactions with oxides, at least a 100% excess of
ammonium bifluoride was used in order to form a mixture which was
sufficiently fluid to stir.

Electrolytic iron powder reacted with molten ammonium bifluoride
to form ammonium hexefluoferrate (III). Chromium metal reacted to form
armonium hexafluochromete (111), » but the ‘reaction was slow. Granulated
metal, finer then 100 mesh, was treated with the melt for 70 min, and
the igang sxmonium bifluoride ves volatilized. Extraction of this

Reaction of Chromous Fluoride with Stannous Fluoride } .
The reaction of chromium metal with molten stannous fluoride pro-
vides a useful method of preparing pure chromous fluoride Re however,
an excess of stannous fluoride can further oxidize the chromium. The .
predominant phase resulting from the reaction of equal molar portions
of stannous fluoride and chromous fluoride is a compound thought to be

2.3. FUEL PROCESSING

Processing of molten-fluoride-salt reactor fuel by volatilization
of the uranium as UF; appears to be feasible. The barren LiF-BeF, can
be recovered for reuse by treatment with nearly anhydrous HF, in which
it is appreciably soluble, and in which rare earth neutron poisons and
most other polyvalent element fluorides are insoluble. Development work
on the process has continued with a study of the behavior of neptunium,
which is possibly the most important neutron poison other than the rare
earths.’

Further measurements of the solubility of Np( IV) have indicated
that its solubility (Table 2.3.1) in aqueous HF solutions saturated
with LiF-BeF,-ThF) -UF) (61.5-37-1-0.5 mole %) will be considersbly less
than reported previously. Apparently the Np(IV) solubility is decreased
by the presence of excess ThF), and UF), . The addition of nickel and
iron metals to solutions saturated with LiF, BeF,,, end NpF), also caused
a significant reduction in the neptunium solubility, except in anhydrous
BF. This is probably the result of reduction of Np(IV) to Np(III).

In a reactor processing system the solution will contain much larger
amounts of rare earths, plutonium, uranium, and thorium than of nep-
tunium, and the container will be a metal, probably a nickel alloy.
Therefore a neptunium solubility of the order of 0.0002 to 0.00005
mole % is expected in actual processing.
