"THE LANGUAGE OF NUCLEAR SCIENCE

"The publications of scientists. concerning their
individual work ‘have been so copious -- and. so.
unreadable for _anyone but their fellow specialists.
‘This has been a great handicap to science itself,
for basic advances: in scientific knowledge often
.. spring from the cross-fertilization of knowledge
from different ‘specialists. What is even more
ominous is that science .has increasingly lost touch
~ with non-scientists. Under such circumstances scien-
tists come to be regarded as magicians -- feared
rather than admired. And the: impression that science
1s incomprehensible. magic, to be understood only by
a chosen few who are suspiciously different from
"ordinary mankind, is: -bound to turn many youngsters
away from science. ;

"At that point I killed the dead man." |
I looked at the verbatim transcript of a technical session devoted

to reactor operations safety. 1 read the words; understood every one

“of them, and still failed to get the message. Only after careful con-

sideration did I realize that the speaker was referring to the so-called
"dead man's button', -- a safety device installed in subway trains and
electric locomotives. The engineer must keep this button depressed,
otherwise, the’ train ‘stops, protecting the’ passengers against the con-

sequences of a heart attack. In this particular case, it was necessary

‘to eliminate temporarily this safety device by means. of a bypass circuit;

thus, the speaker could State quite naturally that. he "killed the dead

unerringly the correct significance’ of coined terms. When show- business

or new meanings must be given- to old words, in order to identify a
specialized concept... The great variety of these specialized terms Co a
used in various professions may be. glimpsed by browsing through an
interesting compilation, edited by. the well-known linguist, Mario Peil.
Turning the pages of this book, we encounter the jargon of anthropology,
architecture, es linguistics, literature, and of the theatre. We may |
thus learn that in the speech of actors, "darling" means "a casual
acquaintance whose name I do not remember". On the other hand, the oT
meaning of colorful electronics engineering terms, such as ''negative
feedback" and "white noise", is also hidden from the uninitiated. The
editor points out that of the about one million words in the English
language, the average cultivated person probably uses only about 30,000
words and is able to recognize and understand only an additional 60,000.
I would like to examine briefly another highly specialized lan-
guage, -- that of the nuclear engineer and scientist. This relatively Ca
new field needed many new words to convey a specialized meaning or to |
designate new machines and facilities. Some of the terms were taken
from the basic sciences involved in nuclear research; many entries
in nuclear glossaries, and terminology books are simple engineering
and scientific terms as used in nuclear applications. Co
© The purely scientific terms represent an important. source of the
nuclear language. . The concepts must be carefully defined ‘to ensure
that the reader will understand. exactly what the author means. They

indeed mean the same thing when they use the same word.
Although the reader of a technical paper is not a layman, he must

exact quantities, and any reference to concentration, weight or volume

-must be clear and unequivocal. Committee members who usually are both

generators of new scientific information and avid readers of the techni-

cal literature, must decide - whether a twice enriched uranium contains

twice the original 0.7% of 235y, ior. 1.4% added to the original 0.7,

resulting in 2.1%. of 235y, *

In addition to such assistance to professionals by means of these
official glossaries, the requirements of general readers and students
have not been forgotten3." Technical societies and government agencies
provide assistance to science writers by providing compilations and
simplified definitions of terms, including many of interest to the
nuclear field. These collections are of educational character; the
terms are explained, rather than defined.

As the nuclear field continued to grow and assumed -an increasing
importance in the economy and political life throughout the world, more
ambitious cyclopedias and lexicons were published in various languages.
They cater to a variety of people, - the specialist, the interested

When we examine the origins of "nuclear language'', we must keep in

‘mind that the field grew up in secrecy; it was born under conditions of

wartime urgency, followed by a period of mutual suspicion which divided
the scientific countries of the world into opposite camps. When the

first truly world-wide meeting was held in Geneva in August 1955, many

nations discovered that their language did not have the terms suitable

to express the new concepts.’ Because of its rich nuclear literature,

English became the predominant language and ever since has exerted a great

influence on the terminology throughout the world. One of the first

acts of the organizers of the 1955 Geneva Conference on the Peaceful

Uses of Atomic Energy was to commission the compilation of a dictionary

** The U.S. Glossary points out that enrichment may mean enrichment

factor or enrichment factor minus one (degree of enrichment). These
terms: - should: be-avoided.. Under enrichment factor reference is
made to separation factor, a different but related concept.
covering the official languages of the United Nations. A new improved
edition was published in time for the Second Geneva’ Conference5. Within

a short time, ‘a number of bilingual and miltilingual nuclear dictionaries 7

appeared on the market©.

The plethora of these definitions, explanations and equivalents in
other languages was helpful in clarifying the méaning of terms. However,
it should be kept in mind that language is a living organism; words,
expressions, and specialized meanings are born, are used and ultimately
die. We may define correct usage and coin suitable expressions, but

they remain without effect if the technical men do not use them and

>

editors do not insist on their correct meaning. One well-known scien-
tific lexicographer stated it very aptly in an international meeting on
nuclear terminology, when he cautioned the participants against excessive
zeal: "We are only recording angels and not God Almighty". 7 It is
indeed useless to devise logical definitions, if authors and editors
refuse to use them. | |
In this short review I propose to leave “the serious examination

of technical ‘terms to the learned committees, and will examine primarily
the more ephemeral and colorful. expressions of the nuclear language i
which enrich the field and give it a special. flavor.

~~ There are many expressions, such as the first sentence of this
paper, which are used primarily orally and are seldom written down.
I heard a nuclear incident described as a felt-hat incident. ‘This
‘concept postulates that a worker near a swimming-pool reactor will some-
“times wear a felt hat which will drop into the pool and will be sucked to
the fuel elements where it will prevent the flow of cooling water,
resulting in a meltdown of the element. . Such accidents have indeed oc-
curred, although with shoe covers, loose pieces of metal, etc. instead
of felt hats. They are usually referred to as "felt-hat accidents'
although not in formal reports. IB Cr Co

Such expressions were coined because they. satisfy a communication

need and perhaps, also to keep the: subject matter from the uninitiated.

This often resulted in a compromise, as if technical discussions were

LR

a guessing game, in which the subject is disguised but some helpful
hints are given. The language of specialists may be analyzed from

different points of view. We could examine the origin of the words

 
a

“jargon of space ‘technologists®.

   

~7-

used, studying. the influence of specific. cultures. Another approach is

“that used by a psychologist ‘who analyzed "space speak", the. engineering

8 He found that specific, new meanings

of space terms, such as countdown, pad, abort, umbilical, made those

words more “widely used- ‘in general speech, However, his, main approach

was linguistic analysis; he found. that space engineers make abundant

use of nominal compounds .

I do not intend to make such a complete grammatical analysis of techni -
cal texts “and in the following pages. will concentrate ‘my attention on
individual terms and c code’ names used by miclear. specialists, trying to
decipher how and why ‘they w were chosen.

It is important to keep in mind that words not: only have intellectual

meanings, but may also carry an emotional impact. Some of them hit us

and arouse strong feelings. We may react with fear, disgust, _enthusiasm,

pride, etc. to words such as pink, yellow, scab, our country. This power

of words is well known and is skillfully used by such different people

as orators, politicians, demagogues and preachers.

‘The ‘emotional impact of words is of, great importance for the nuclear

field because its public acceptance is still affected by the legacy of

its first application, the. atomic bomb The term, atomic or nuclear has
an ambivalent effect: it may induce fear or arouse admiration. If one
wanted to describe a very bright, highly skilled individual, he probably
would have stated, until recently, a brain surgeon Or a nuclear physicist.
Today he probably would cite a. heart- transplant surgeon or an astronaut.
Well, -- sic transit gloria mundi!

I shall return. later. to the question of "loaded" terms in connection

with the impact of ‘the nuclear field or society. Let me state that use

of certain expressions indicates that the user belongs to a "special

interest group". It is of interest. to note that in addition to the

spelling of a. word, its pronounciation classifies the user. Thus, an

audience of ‘space engineers. will consider as an outsider a Speaker who-

pronounces their agency, NASA, as Naysa, just as chemists prefer to

ronounce the element ‘iodine with a short "itt; the usual ronounciation
Pp

iodine indicates that the speaker” is a layman, oo |
As our goal is the examination of individual ‘terms in the. nuclear

field, we must be struck by the fact ‘that this area of endeavor is-
based on the linguistically incompatible term atomic fission. Atomic
means indivisible; fission indicates division. Thus, progress of science
overtook the old definition, whose original meaning has been forgotten

by now. Co } oo So oo A

When new words are coined, there is always a tendency to avoid dis-

agreeable images and to arouse pleasant thoughts. In a well-known weekly
magazine it was brought up that physicians are starting to call pep pills
activity boosters and garage mechanics call themselves automotive in-

ternists. In the same article, a Jules Feiffer cartoon character is

ia

cited as follows: "First I was poor. Then I became needy. Then I was
‘underprivileged. Now I am disadvantaged. 'I.still don't have a penny
to my name - but I have a great vocabulary." |

The requirements .of secrecy, ego boosting as expressed by belonging
to a select group, and euphemistic tendencies are thus the chief factors
affecting the language of the new science. ‘Let us see how they have shaped
the language of nuclear science. | oo

At the beginning of the Manhattan Project, steps were taken to avoid : -
mentioning the element uranium. . In all the reports it was referred to | | |
as Tuballoy and designated by the symbol T. The enriched material was : |
called Oralloy, and 235U was designated as element 25 (from its atomic |
number 92 and atomic weight 235). On the same basis, plutonium was.
designated as 49, since it was. element 94 with an atomic weight of 239.
Uranium and plutonium were referred to in many of the early reports as
source material and product, respectively. |

The problem of naming the new element was an important precaution
during the early days. I found. an interesting document representing
the minutes of a meeting held on April 22-23, 1942 in Chicagol0. A
portion of the session was devoted to a review of the various code names.

The participants sound like a Who's Who of the project: Spedding, |
Thiele, Seaborg, Kennedy, Urey, Wigner, Hilberry, Boyd, Johns, Wilhelm,
Perlman, Wahl and Wheeler. Among other subjects, a suitable terminology. Y

for the heaviest elements was discussed. One of the possibilities

‘ “©

considered was to name Element 93 néptunium and Element 94 plutonium.
It was agreed, however, that these designations might eventually be the

actual names for these elements .and therefore should not be used as
 

code names. Up to that time the terms” copper and silver were used to

designate the new elements. This méthod was not. specific concerning the

"isotopes and caused considerable confusion with the actual elements

named, if they were involved in the same analytical process. It was
often necessary to use the term honest to God silver to distinguish
"silver'" from other elements. Therefore it was suggested to use a

terminology based on the last digit in the atomic number and atomic

weight characterizing ‘the given substance:

Element 94, Atomic weight 239 - 49
Element 93, Atomic weight 239 - 39.
Element 92, Atomic weight 238 - 28 °
Element 92, Atomic weight 235 - 25
Element 92, Atomic weight 234 - 24

" Element 94 (generic) 40 or 4

Element 92 (generic) ~~ 20 or 2

~. According to a recent article by a prominent participant, it was
McMillan who named Element 93 neptuniwm because Neptune is the next
planet after Uranus, and proposed that Element 94 should be named
after Plutoll. A discussion developed whether its symbol should be
Pl or Pu. The-author: wrote: 'we liked the symbol 'Pu" better for the
reason that you might suspect". The ‘expected great. reaction to the
symbol, after it was declassified, never materialized.

The above coding system was probably responsible for the naming
of the K-25 Plant, the vast, _ gaseous diffusion plant designed and built
by a subsidiary of the Kellog Corporation to separate the - fissionable

isotope 235U. | |

Research on transuranium elements. continued. Unfortunately, there
were no more .planets to supply names for further elements, and the next
two elements were at first tentatively called pandemonium and delirium
by the workers. These names never reached the public.
| The story of naming the following heavy elements has been described
wittily by the man who had so much to do with then, “AEC Chairman Glenn
T, Seaborgl2, | Co

"Element 97. was called berkelium after the city of Berkeley, Cali-
fornia, and Element 98 was named californium after the university and

the state where the work was done. However, this latter name: does not

reflect the observed chemical analogy of Element 98 to Element 66,

dysprosium, as the names of americium, curium and berkelium signified

Ag
’

that these elements are chemical analogs of europium, gadolinium and

terbium, named after a continent, a scientist and a city, respectively. >
In announcing their discovery in the Physical Review, the authors |
commented ''the best we can’ do is to point out, in recognition of the

fact that dysprosiwm is named on the basis of a Greek work meaning

difficult to get at, that the searchers for another element a century | Co

ago found it 'difficult to get to California'". The naming of these

ie

elements was commented on in an unexpected place, the Talk of the Town
section of the New: Yorker magazine. The writer remarked that ''the busy
scientists in California will come up with another element or two one
of these days and the’ University has lost forever a chance of immorta-
lizing itself in the atomic tables with some such sequence as uni-
versitium (97), ofium (98) ,californium (99), berkelium (100). In
rebuttal, the discoverers stated that 'by using these names first, we
have forestalled the appalling possibility that some New Yorker might : CL.

follow with the discovery of 99 and 100 and ‘apply the name newZum and

\o Ty

yorkium. The New Yorker: staff rejoined that they are already working
in their office laboratories on these two elements but ''so far we just
have the names". |
Many ORNL staff members had an opportunity to ‘hear Chairman Seaborg
himself tell this story when he presented in Oak Ridge, in November 1966,
a reminiscence entitled 'Voices from the Past", containing: original
tape recordings of great historical interest.
Wartime codes had to be primarily innocuous words, unrelated to
the concept, although we have seen that this was. not always true. ' Thus,
by an interesting coincidence, all buildings in which the actual electro-
magnetic separation process. was carried out at the Y-12 Plant, were
designated by numbers starting with 92 ... It is difficult to give a
better hint to a.secret product. Ce oo 7

tried to chose a name which would not arouse suspicion. One of the
ridges in this hilly area was called Blackoak Ridge, and. therefore -the =
term Oak Ridge was chosen, as being sufficiently. bucolic and general
to be used as a .cover name ‘for the residential area. The. plant opera-
tions were called Clinton Engineer Works, after the nearby town of
Clinton, | |

The original hotel of the. town still stands among other wartime.

buildings; the oldtimers keep.calling it .the Guest House, disregarding

the change of its. name to ‘the Alexander Hotel. During the early days’.
the place had. the distinction that everybody who checked in was given
an honorary doctor title by the desk clerk. The headquarters which
today house the Atomic Energy Commission's Oak Ridge Operations Office,
were located. in a barrack-like structure; in view of the insigna of

the U. S. Army Engineers, a medieval battlement, it was natural to call

it Castle-on-the-Hill, or, because it consisted. of seven barracks, the

Seven. Gables. This survivor from the heroic. days of the town is about
to be replaced by a modern office building. |

The Metallurgical Laboratory of the University of Chicago was
another innocous cover name; of course, its scope greatly exceeded
the field of metallurgy. It was the precursor of the present Argonne
National Laboratory. It is of interest to recall how this ‘institution

acquired its name after the war. After the facilities of the Metal-

lurgical Laboratory were found to be insufficient, additional space

was provided in a wooded area belonging to the Cook County Forest
Preserve District. These preserves were named after famous battles
of the First World War in which Americans participated; the site in

question was. called the Argonne Forest. After the war, the. newly

created ‘hational laboratory was transferred to a different site near

Chicago but for sentimental reasons, it carried its name to the new
location, even. though it was pretty far from the original "Argonne
Forest". ' . |

A metallurgical term was used also as a cover name for the project's
activities at Columbia University: SAM stood for Substitute Alloy Ma-
terials. . The Union Carbide. Corporation assumed: responsibility for ‘this

activity.

For people interested in the Tore of names, browsing through the
~ otherwise dry reading matter contained in lists of index headings,
abbreviations, nicknames: and acronyms can be quite rewardingl3,

One may learn that Mighty Mouse represented a proposal for a.
heterogeneous enriched-uranium heavy- water-cooled and moderated re--
search reactor, related to the Argonne Advanced Research Reactor or
A2R2 and that Juggernaut is the Argonne Low Power Research Reactor.
. Acronyms with special meanings -were created, with much work expended
to coin terms ‘with a. special meaning, as in case of an early |
high-speed computer at ORNL, the ORACLE (Oak Ridge Automatic. Computer
Logical Engine). | |

Attempts were made to systematize code designations. For example,
the underground nuclear tests at Los: Alamos were designated first by
burrowing mammals such as Bandicoot, Bobac, Aardvark, etc., a seemingly
appropriate category. When they ran out of such names they were:
forced to use some "burrowing" mammals which: may have dug only an
occasional hole in the ground14, Subsequent series of tests were named
after fish, birds, colors and alcoholic drinks. This was found to be
of special "human" interest to a magazine writer who described an
imaginary. scene of a handful of - scientists gathering around a table,
as followsl5: |

"Bourbon, Scotch and Sazerac," says a crew-cut.
nuclear physicist." "Daiquiri, my wife likes those,"
~~. chimes in a computer expert. "How about Martini and
Grasshopper and Screwdriver?" a

- Names were never assigned in such a manner, although codes to
designate actual sites of the large projects were carefully selected.
Oak Ridge, Hanford and Los Alamos. were designated as Sites X, W and
Y. At Berkeley, the Oak Ridge Y-12 Plant was known as. Shangri-La.
The DuPont group, which was in-charge of the X-10 Site where the Oak
Ridge National Laboratory is now located, was part of the Explosives
Department of the company, and was -called TNX Division although this
had nothing to do with the explosive’ trinitroxylene.

waste tank concentration plant carried a sign for a while after the war
Lower Slobovian Distillery, after. the ''country' popularized by the cartoon-
ist Al Capp; however, this was too much and a superintendent with a faint
heart removed it. At Los Alamos, at the Kappa site there were installa-
tions called Eenie, Meeny,.Miney and Lower Slobovia, the latter apparently
for its isolation. -

Reactors -are the most impressive and exciting devices of the nuclear

age. Let us examine reactor name compilations to see how they were

acquired.

Many of the names given to the reactors during the last two decades
were quite prosaic; they were simply acronyms of rather unimaginative
identifying terms. The first one was the historic CP-1 (Chicago Pile-1);
only eleven months later, the first true reactor; with a sizeable power
level, was in operation. This was the X-10 Reactor; now a registered
national historic landmark (Figure 1). Going through the. series as
listed in various compilations, we encounter names. which do not: stir the
blood of the reader: MIR (Materials Testing Reactor, BWR (Boiling Water
Reactor), PWR (Pressurized Water Reactor), -- or to use local examples,
ORR (ORNL Research Reactor), TSR (Tower Shielding Reactor), HFIR (High

‘Flux Isotope. Reactor), LITR (Low. Intensity Testing Reactor) and so forth.

These groups of letters are easily forgotten by all except ‘persons

who use ‘them constantly. Figure 2 illustrates. how this alphabet soup

~ of initials confuses a hapless bus driver.

As mentioned before, the way these names are pronounced (a la -

© "Monkey Ward' for Montgomery Ward of the stockmarket expert) identifies

‘the "insiders". LITR is called: liter, the metric unit of volume, HFIR

became hi fur; the Organic Moderated Reactor Experiment (OMRE) is pro-

‘nounced Oh Marie. The many problems related to the handling of the

molten salt fuel were probably responsible for the nickname of the.

‘Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) -- Misery. - Luckily, most of the

problems have been solved.

More imagination was used in ‘the early days. Let us: take. the

plutonium- fueled reactor, which was. under. construction in one of. the

canyons at Los. Alamos. One of the scientists who was transferred

kept wondering about. the progress of. the project but for reasons of
-14-

security, could not. -ask about it openly. The location of the
project and the material they worked with (49) suddenly recalled to him |
the old prospector's song: Co Co ' | - co
"In -a’cavern, in a canyon, excavating for a mine, Le Cy
Lived a miner, forty-niner and his daughter, Clementine."
He sent a telegram: "How is my darling Clementine?'.. The message
was understood and the reactor became ‘known ‘as Clementinel. |
There are other colorful examples of Los Alamos names: Jemima con- - oo

sisted of stacked flat plates, ‘which evoked the well-known advertise-

«

‘ment of hot cakes; Jezabel was ''mean ‘and hard to handle" and Topsy, t he
character from Uncle Tom's cabin; 'she-just grew". |
One of the best-known among the Los Alamos reactors is the one,
- built without reflectors, which operated with fast neutrons, -- the
bare and fast Godiva. More recently, a highly descriptive name was
employed to designate a reactor prototype of the nuclear rocket project,
used for so-called "captive firing" tests: the KIWI, a reactor designed oo B >
to propel a rocket but held. on the ground, was.very. aptly named after oo -
the flightless New Zealand bird. Lo

~ The first reactor in Belgium, which followed ‘the main lines of the
design of the X- 10 Reactor, was called BR-1 (Belgian Reactor 1); it

‘was followed by BR-2 and BR-3. There is nothing specifically "Belgian" }
in this name. On the other hand, the acronym of the South African

- Fundamental Atomic Reactor. Installation, SAFARI, gives us the flavor.

“of that mysterious continent.

From the very beginning the’ ‘Europeans’ used more imaginative names

for their reactors. Although the acronyms ‘were sometimes: forced, the
resulting word usually had a specific meaning. ‘The British have Dido
(named because it was heavy-water moderated DDO’ or D20) and Zephyr

(Zero Energy Fast Reactor); the French’ reactor; Mélusine, was named
after a fairy. One needed some knowledge of mythology to recognize the
reason for calling a plutonium-fueled reactor experiment Proserpine, — . 3
the wife of Pluto. The first French zero power reactor was. called ZOE
after ''zero (power), oxide (of tiranium) and eau lourde (heavy water). | i. -

evokes an ecstatic feeling. The breeder reactor mockup at the Cadarache

as -Masurca, a compression of its formal name

Maquette Surregénératrice Cadarache which recalls the Polish dance.

Knowledge of mythology is also helpful in understanding special hints.

The name Aquarium.was an obvious one for the Los Alamos critical

facility, immersed in water; it also designated the design, construction

 

and operation of a swimming-pool type reactor for the First Geneva Con-

ference in 1955. The term swimming pool reactor was used at ORNL for

its own reactor prior to this conference; it was a logical expression to

designate reactors. placed in a water-filled rectangular hole which looked

like a swimming pool, I

t was feared that this.less-than-serious term

would be disliked by the powers-that-be and therefore the official name

of ‘the reactor at ORNL was the Bulk Shielding Reactor (BSR), a correct

but colorless expression. Although the term swimming pool was removed

from the official papers

|

submitted to the Geneva Conference, the news-

men got hold of it and no censorship could prevent references in various

languages to the swimming pool reactor, e.g., réacteur piscine, Schwimm-

badreaktor, etc.19. Today, pool-type reactor is a generic tern.

The Argonne National Laboratory's family of reactors presents’ another

interesting example of mythological references. These reactors are called

nauts who sailed with Jason. on the ship Argo in quest of the Golden Fleece;

The first Soviet ‘power reactor at Obninsk has been called The First
Atomic Power Reactor of the USSR20 in the English and Russian literature,
but more recently it has been referred ‘to occasionally as Pervii v Mire = or
Atom Mir 1, indicating "The World's First" Atomic Power Station.

Colorful terms are still being invented. The Tennessee Valley

The thermonuclear researchers, coming. after reactor. men, seemed to
lean toward humor and mythology when naming their facilities. ) Again, even
though I. am a loyal ORNL'er, I must admit that the name of our DCX ma-
chine, standing for Direct Current Experiment, is not as colorful as
that of the Los Alamos toroidal pinch’ experiment Perhapsatron or the
magnetic mirror experiment, seylla. Fusion research is fraught with
| dangers similar -to those encountered by Ulysses and his seafaring . com-
panions; we can expect sooner or. later the: appearance of a machine
called Charybdis. 3 : | | |

“As the. thermonuclear fusion tries to. imitate what's happening in
the Sun ‘and other stars, it is natural that we. “have devices named
Stellarator or Astron. Lo Co Co

There are several (apocryphal) stories about the origin of the
code for the project aimed to generate. energy by thermonuclear fusion.
‘According to one version, a. scientist said to another: "It. would be
good to make the fusion energy of ‘the Sun available to mankind". The
‘other agreed: "It sure would! “Thereupon the whole undertaking was
dubbed Project Sherwood??. The other explanation. attributes the code
to the name of the man in. charge, “James Tuck, == who quite naturally
recalls Friar Tuck and Sherwood Forest of Robin Hood.

The peaceful use of thermonuclear explosions was emphasized by
the name given to the underground excavation: Plowshare, recalling the
Biblical admonition of the Prophet Isaiah: vo... and they shall beat their
swords into plowshares and their spears into. pruning hooks".

In view of. ‘the underground’ nature of ‘the activity, the term Gnome

is well suited as a name for an, "experiment to study t the production

nuclear. explosion’; according to the dictionary, it stands for: an age-
less dwarf creature of folklore, conceived as. living in the earth and
usually guarding precious. ores or treasure". ee .

A number of ‘the . accelerators, known to the lay public. as atom oo
smashers, have names ending in". +. tron't, recalling the, generic term
cyclotron or magnetic. resonance accelerator. The Singer, geseteratons
are called linac (always pronounced with a short i). | |

| The French cyclotron. at Saclay has a. large ring, _- therefore, it
was logical to call it Saturne. The name of Nimrod ar Harwell, England,
indicates that it is used for ‘hunting or searching. The machine at
Danesbury, England, is. called Nina; intimate knowledge of the American
television field is revealed by the names of a German and a Swedish .
accelerator Desy and Lusy; . they stand. for Deutsches Elektron Synchrotron
and Lund Synchrotron, respectively. Other acronyms : of . these. interest-
ing devices include ORIC . (oak Ridge. Tsochronous Cyclotron), ORELA (Oak
Ridge Electron Linear Accelerator, under construction), LAMPE (Los Alamos
Meson- Proton Facility) and TRIUME (Tri- -University Meson Meson Facility) in
Vancover, Canada. A fourth university joined the original Sponsors , but
I do not believe that: the symbolic acronym will be changed. . The names
of Bevatron at. Berkeley and - Cogmotron. at the Brookhaven National Labora-
tory emphasize the. tremendous size. of. ‘these. machines23. oo

The energy level, of course, is a very important feature of accel-
erators; nowadays, it is given in terms of billion electron volts or
Bev. , However, billion is a "false friend" which confuses the trusting
reader: -it means ‘thousand million in the United States. and million
million An most of ‘the rest. of ‘the world. Therefore, the prefix, Giga,

abbreviated as .G has been adopted for the factor of 1012, and Bev |

became Gev. In this connection, it has been reported that Professor

Victor Weisskopf of. MIT, a former director of the European high-energy

research center CERN, in Geneva, Switzerland started to say in a speech
"Gev, - oh, I'm. sorry; over, here, I have to remember to use Brookhaven
electron voltst24, ‘He thus gave an, excellent mnemonic rule: Geneva
electron volts and Brookhaven electron volts, for use in. Europe and

the U. S., respectively, to indicate 1012 electron volts.

Many of the wartime terms used in the various plans of the Manhattan
Project were simple, arbitrarily chosen codes. In addition to the. pre-
viously mentioned Tuballoy and Oralloy, there was also, by analogy,
Myrnalloy for thorium, based on the name of the motion- picture actress.
Hex was uranium hexafluoride (usually enriched) while D-38 indicated
uranium depleted in the 235 isotope. - The term derby indicated an ingot
of depleted uranium received from the metal reduction plant. ~ Fission-
able materials were shipped in containers held in a birdcage to prevent
stacking them and unwittingly. creating a critical mass. This highly
descriptive term is still used. | | |

Codes in use at the Gaseous’ Diffusion (k- 25) plant included L-28
for liquid nitrogen and H-24 for helium (based again on the - atomic
number and weight). oo |

The production of the plant was reported in units of kegs of eggs
standing for kilograms of X (or 2350). The center of the K-33 cell
floor was called Sth Avenue ‘and 42nd Street, while ‘the K- 29 complex. was
referred to as the Ponderosa. nN | | |

Many of these terms outlived their usefulness, but the expressions
of green salt and orange oxide are still aged for uranium tetrafluoride
and trioxide, respectively. = | oo |

At the Electromagnetic Separation (Y- 12) Plant, ‘the letter F
designated calutron ion beam; calutron itself was a contraction of the
words California University and cyclotron. In that plant, the 238y
isotope was indicated by the letter Q, and 235) by R; M designated the

-calutron source and E the calutron receiver. , while / was the system's
magnetic field. . The track was the complete magnetic. system containing
many calutrons, and cubicle referred to the power supply and control
center of an individual: calutron.. | The term, alpha separation indicated
a first.pass in the separation process on the 48- inch radius machine,
while the beta ‘separation referred to the second pass on a 24- inch.
~ radius device. Co } : Ea Co

Today, most of these buildings have seen strsaned of their original
tracks and are used for other purposes but oldtimers still refer to
them as Alpha-1 or Beta-3. As has been mentioned before, all the
buildings ‘in which the separation process was carried out were designated

by a numb ex starting. with 92... 1

A dee, because of its shape like the letter D, indicated the alpha 1
calutron source, receiver and liner assembly; the term bin referred to
the calutron's vacuum chamber and the Mae West was its electron drain
system component. In that plant the liquid nitrogen (atomic number 7,

atomic weight- 14) was designated by 714. Cooling was very important;

‘there was a special code (763) for the condensation trap using carbon

dioxide and a solvent. The sump Was a calutron receiver for decelerat-
ing and collecting the ion beam and slug* indicated a one-unit mass
separation in the electromagnetic process. Crud (supposedly originally
standing for Chalk River Unidentified Deposit) was a secret word at the
Y-12 Plant. | | |

Let us turn our attention to another new field which has also
started with the atomic age. The health physicists invented many
colorful terms to designate their specialized instruments. The first
light-weight meter was named cutie pie after his wife by a romantic
engineer. Even though some laboratories do not stand for such nonsense
and insist calling the instrument "CP meter", cutie pte is a more
pleasing term than CP-meter to designate"... a small, light weight,
portable, gamma-measuring, beta-indicating , survey instrument with an

ionization chamber coupled to a balanced bridge circuit M250 Tp

~ portable detection instrument operated as if it were sniffing the alpha

emitters; it was quite natural to paste on its side a decal of the

famous Disney dog, Pluto, “sniffing the ground. Unfortunately, a Ssecurity-
minded supervisor became disturbed by. this name which was very close to
that of the still-classified plutonium and issued an order forbidding

its use. It was suggested to rechristen the instrument Sandy, Little
Orphan Annie’ s dog, but this recommendation was not followed.

Another instrument consisted of two units, a boron-coated ioniza-

tion chamber which measured both neutron and gamma rays and a similar,

uncoated chamber which measured the gamma rays alone; from the difference

of the two readings the neutron flux could be determined. The instru-

ments always traveled together and therefore the unit was named Chang

and Eng for the original Siamese twins.

© . : . . \ . }
* This term was also used to designate the short, aluminum-clad
‘uranium rods of the X-10 reactor. -
220-0

The field of instrumentation also made use of mythology. A portable
survey instrument Zeus was followed by another one named Juno. A European
modular instrument unit was called Janus, On the other hand, several
instruments were named after the noise they make. These devices included
Walkie Talkie, the output of which was fed to a pair of headphones, Walkie
Squawkie which utilized a, loudspeaker, ~and Walkie Poppy. which made a,
"popping" noise. ‘The modern PRM. (Personnel Radiation Monitor) is popularly
called’ the chirper. after its audible signal. | |
The many new concepts in. ‘the field of ‘nuclear physics made it necessary
for the scientists to invent new terms. In Cross section measurements the
‘expression barn was introduced. This small surface, 10-24 cm? is Mas big
as a barn" for nuclear processes26. During the study of the neutrino, a
‘much smaller surface was used in theoretical studies and the area 10-44
© cm? was quite logically named the ‘shed; however, this latter name did not
receive general acceptance. An ‘effort to change barn to square fermt
a fermi being 10-12 cm) was also unsuccessful. The well-known neutron
cross section compilation, BNL- 325, has the picture of a barn: on. its
cover. ‘and is ‘popularly known as. The Barn Book. |
‘Barn. is a rather unusual’ Tiame for a scientific unit ‘although my

it ‘sounds quite. natural to us. . The usual (milli, micro, etc. :) prefixes
were used with it and thus it is ‘not surprising ‘that a suspicious wife
‘who did not like at all being left out of discussions, asked her friend
"Who is this. Millie Barn, | about whom the men always talk?!".

| The first studies of nuclear ‘chain reaction were made with uranium
and graphite blocks that were. stacked. or piled, whence the term pile,
recalling the voltaic pile, ‘the. original primary battery, which con-
sisted of a series of alternating copper - and" ‘zinc disks, with disks of
cloth moistened with an electrglyte: between ‘them. Later it was decided
to use the more ‘euphonius term. reactor. This was not a perfect and un-
ambiguous name; it has been used to designate "a: .piece of equipment in
which a chemical reaction is” “carried out especially on ‘an industrial
scale", according ‘to one authori ty27 which lists the '"nuclear' meaning
in the second place. The term caused occasional confusion. When. the
ORNL standard pile, a graphite’ assembly without any uranium, was.

restandardized , it could not be called properly a reactor, but, an

editor, instructed to watch out and eliminate. the term '"pile', unthink-

ingly changed the name to. reactor.

~ Another, still widely.used term became’ part of the technical lan-

guage at the birth of the atomic -age. During the experiment that

culminated. on December 2, 1942 in the accomplishment ofthe first
controlled nuclear chain reaction, a safety rod. was held by a rope
running ‘through the pile and weighted-on the opposite end. The young
physicist in charge was told to watch the indicator; if it exceeded a
certain value, he was to cut the rope and scram. Since then the term
scram is used to designate the emergency shutdown ‘of a reactor. Today
the urgency is lost and the word scram indicates simply a fast- shutdown

operation. A few years ago the’ meeting of “the international

committee on nuclear terminology, a member of the on eal

expressed ‘a strong dislike for this word, calling it "an inelegant.
American-slang term" and wanted to substitute emergency shutdown?*;

however, his face was red when during a subsequent visit of the com-

mittee: members to British reactors revealed that the emergency shutdown

buttons carry a big SCRAM even in England; the word’ is more expressive
and as it is shorter, it is. easier. to print on the ‘control panel.

CA cursory glance at..the’ new ‘terms’ applied to nuclear ‘concepts, --
both in pure science and in engineering, reveals a definite tendency |

to use ordinary words, avoiding words of Greek-Latin origin, commonly

used in science. “Let us. look at” a few examples.

The term cross section was mentioned above. In its new meaning,
it is.'"'a measure of probability of a specified interaction between an
incident radiation and a target particle’; it has the dimensions of
area. The words- dollar and cent have nothing to do with money; they
representa unit. of reactivity equal to the’ difference between the

prompt critical and delayed critical conditions of the reactor. The

term rabbit designates a device to move radioactive samples from the

reactor 0 the laboratory or to send specimens for short periods. of.

time through the reactor core; the opening through which it entered
the reactor was naturally called the rabbit hole. After having been
the exclusive property of nuclear engineers, the new meaning of - this oT

word has been listed by dictionary editors, but one must be. careful

y—

when translating it into other languages.

Milking has nothing to do with cows and dairy science but refers
to the continued removal of a daughter radioactive decay product from
the parent. Breeding has no biological implication for the nuclear
engineer; it indicates conversion when the conversion ratio is greater
than unity. When the reactor man speaks. of sandwich and states the | .
thickness. of the meat, he does not refer to his luncheon but to the.
~uranium- aluminum alloy fuel, covered with a sheet of aluminum; ‘the.
meat in the central fissionable ‘portion. Decladding has nothing to
-do with strip tease; it implies. the removal of the protective coating
from the. fuel ‘element, usually by chemical means. If the operation.
1s carried out mechanically, we talk about dejacketing.

Chemical processing has also developed its special expressions.

A direct strike ‘referred to the addition of a phosphate anion to form
bismuth phosphate which carried the ‘plutonium; in the reverse strike B | Cd
the phosphate. was added to a. uranium solution containing plutonium, | |

after which. the. bismuth carrier was. added. The plutonium concentra

tion was designated x-level and w-level depending on the plant or

site, while the difficulty arising from handling plutonium was called

the alpha problem. Co
There were a number of extractive separation processes with names

ending in Mex", €.8., Thorez, ‘Flex, Purex, ‘etc.; otherwise, the chemists

and chemical engineers used mostly the ‘terms of their own field. | Handling
radioactive materials brought into the language: the term hot and, as
with "honest-to-God" silver, occasionally care had ‘to be taken to empha-

size that the solution was thermally. hot. Today. hot means "highly radio-

active"; but hot atom indicates’ "'an atom in an excited state or having i
kinetic energy above the thernal level of - the . surroundings, usually as {
“a result of nuclear processes, TE Te co oo oo SR uo
"Let us -1look at the nuclear: language from another viewpoint. Earlier |

I pointed. to. the emotional impact of certain ) Words. It is surprising

 
i

 

~23-

how many such "loaded". words are used in: the nuclear field. People
‘were afraid of anything atomic to start with’ because of the awesome
origin of the field and the. terminology developed by: the" practitioners

did not alleviate this feeling. No wonder - that the public becomes

‘suspicious and confused when reading about mean life, dead time, ex-

cited state, burnup, burnout, even though these terms are used to
designate "innocent" tethnical concepts. Further unpleasant imagery
is ‘conjured up by expressions such as neutron. capture and master-
slave manipulators. | - |
William E. Shoupp, a former president of the American Nuclear
Society, feels ‘that ‘the nuclear industry bears a great portion of the

responsibility for the fact that the public misunderstands its true

h nature, its promise of a brighter future; he squarely attributes this

to the unfortunate choice of terms used by practitioners of nuclear
engineering and science?l, In his widely-acclaimed speech as outgoing
president, he eloquently described the misinformation, ignorance and
confusion of the public. He cited a public-opinion survey of teenagers
who, even though they have not been’ born when the atomic ‘bomb was
dropped, associated atomic energy with war and not peace. In spite of
the excellent safety record at the national. laboratories and major
research centers, people are afraid of reactors, as shown by citizens’
protests whenever new projects are planned. This reaction is re-

inforced by words’ conveying an unpleasant connotation. He decried the

use of terms such as maximum credible ‘accident and asked why should

reactor engineers talk about a hazards report instead of a saféguards
report, He pointed. out, as did others before him, that the nuclear
jargon is filled with gloomy, funereal terms: fuel eléments are trans-
ported in coffins and reactors are poisoned to control them. It ‘is
indeed unfortunate that we use expressions as a reactor going critical

and carrying out critical experiments in a critical facility. To the

“layman the word "critical" means that the patient is about to die, but:

for some reason, it is associated with the "birth" of reactors. - Con-
taminated items are disposed by taking them to cemeteries or burial
‘grounds. The previously mentioned scram does not. help either, as it

-implies "Run like hell",
24.

A more pleasing expression is hot garden, an underground storage
for radioactive materials, consisting of a series of wells; the ma- -
terial is "planted" in the garden. |

There are. beauty. and history in these names and coined words; .*' -.
~ they deserve the same attention of scholars as inscriptions on old tomb-
stones and parchments. Some such scholarly studies have already been
started in the field of nuclear terminology. Dr. H. Kowalski, a nuclear
scientist - who is currently devoting his attention to problems of
terminology examined the problem of creation of new words at a con-
ference on linguistics; he listed several factors which influence the
development of scientific and ‘engineering jargon29. |

. The linguist, the psychologist or the information specialist might
find in the nuclear language a rich field for investigation. Geographers
and historians try to reconstitute the way of life and social organiza-
tion of early. inhabitants of a region by studying the toponymy of his-
torical and geographic designations; in the same manner, editors and
indexers of nuclear publications should scrutinize the habits of authors;
they should examine, for example, whether their systematic and techni-
cally correct terms are actually used by authors, speakers and working
engineers.

The atomic age is still with us; many of us still remember its
birth, but it is fast becoming history. We should not lose this
opportunity to examine carefully the linguistic residue of a giant
national and international effort while many persons who can shed
light on certain facets of the problem are still alive. Such an effort .
could usefully complement the work of the Historical Advisory Committee
of the Atomic Energy Commission30. | | |

Specialized terms should be coordinated and defined, but I want to
repeat that committee reports and authority lists. are ex post facto |
products; the living language does not wait for definitions. The
language, as it is spoken, often does not follow the rules of grammar
and logic. The fast breeder reactor has a blanket and a fertile zone
but it does not breed fast; it uses fast neutrons for breeding. Even
the fundamental concepts are often misused: we should talk about

nuclear and not atomic energy, but the term is used: in the names of

official bodies (Atomic Energy Commission; Commissariat a 1'Energie
Atomique*) and it cannot be eradicated easily. There are excellent

linguistic arguments. why we should not use the ‘term nuclear safety

for problems of contamination by a- ~active particles; that term should

be reserved to the field described by the adjective critical, as we

discussed above.

01d or quaint expressions have a certain: charm and add a special
feeling to the cold, ‘businesslike language of scientist’ and engi- |
neer, they. should be caréfully considered’ instead of automatically re-
jecting them in favor of systematic terms. The: old names of European
streets and alleys. retain the flavor of the. history of the area, -- as

for instance the Parisian names of ''Rue du Chat qui Péche" or “Rue des

Mauvais Garcons", = the Street of the Fishing Cat or the Street of

Bad Boys. These names are not" as precise as "Fifth Avenue and 42nd
Street" to help find your place in a city but are more. colorful and
add character to the. city. People get attached to names to which

they are accustomed and even the cold, numeri cal system may- acquire

a sentimental ‘value. Hardly any New Yorker talks about "Avenue of:

the Americas’; it remains Sixth Avenue for then, although the name was
changed two decades ago. Therefore, in spite of the above neritical’
remarks about "scram! ‘and "critical, we obtain a certain emotional |
satisfaction. from their use: they recall the "heroic" days of the.
nuclear field when the researcher started his workday with the: thought
that he might have to "scram'; when ‘the scientist armed with only a
screwdriver pushed "subcritical masses. of fissionable materials in

an experiment called twisting the dragon's tail, instead: of watching
from the outside as ‘they are. driven together in shielded cells by remote

machinery. Clinically sterile, logically correct terms are ‘needed but

let us. ‘not get rid of our. emotional heritage!

I cannot claim that I have done. Justice to the language of nuclear .
science; it is inpossible to cover all facets ‘and ramifications of

the trade jargon of ‘this highly specialized field. 1 have tried to point

out the impact of the vocabulary on our feelings, -- the same words

being able to arouse fear and suspicion among the public, -- pride and
nostalgia among the practitioners. | |

Wartime secrecy, gave birth to cover names but perhaps as a result
of some feeling of "fair play", ‘there was: always some connection between
the object and the verbal cloak.. Ordinary words assumed new meanings, |
whimsical acronyms were created, while the time- -honored Greek and Latin
roots were neglected. oo | |

A new "language" has been developed in the relatively short time
of a quarter of a century. The field is not ‘the youngest any more;
the space and computer sciences now have that distinction. . But it
still dominates international politics and people who plan the future
of mankind count on its resources. What the politicians, the planners
and, especially, the scientists and ‘engineers “have to say. ‘must be
clearly understood by everybody. |

In the portion of his book quoted at the start of this paper,
Isaac Asimov, the well- known scientist, science writer ‘and author of
science-fiction stories, underlines the obligation of scientists to
society and to their colleagues to make themselves understood. They
must make sure that they will not lose touch with non- scientists,
that science will not appear as "incomprehensible magic’. -

They owe it to their fellow scientists not to use terms which are
all-defined or cannot be understood by ‘a majority of their audience
or readers; otherwise, ‘only words are transmitted, instead of knowl-
. edge. They must resist the. temptation to, coin fancy words to cover
up hazy and unclear concepts. |
1 would like to close by citing the now famous telephone message
given by Arthur Compton from Chicago, after thes first self-sustaining
chain reaction was achieved, to James B. Conant at Harvard. It heralded
the beginning of a new age for mankind, and it was instantly understood
although the code was not prearranged. |

"The Italian navigator. has. landed in the new world",

said Compton. oe } | |

"How were the natives?" asked Conant.  -

"Very friendly.
