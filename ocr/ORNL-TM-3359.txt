FOREWORD

The evolutionary nature of the ROD program (see Seetion 2, The History
of ROD) has led to certain practical limitations on the information pre-
sented in this report. We have described the uses for which the program
was intended, the theory and methodology employed, and rather completely
the information required for applying the program. We have not attempted
a ccomprehensive description of the programming itself.
ABSTRACT

ROD (Reactor Optimum Design) is a computer code for simultaneously
optimizing the core design and performing the fuel-cycle analysis for
cireulating-fuel reactors. It consists of & multigroup diffusion calcu-
lation, including multiple thermel groups with neutron upscatter, in one-
dimension or in two-dimensional synthesis. combined with an equilibrium
fuel-cycle caleulation. Cross sections in the CITATION format are required.
The equilibrium calculation is a detailed model of the fuel cycle, in-
cluding the effects of processing and of nuclear transmutation and decay.
Fuel-cycle costs and fission-product concentrations are calculated, the
fission products by an independent calculation from internally stored two-
Zroup cross sections. Special features of ROD are an optimization routine
based on the gradient-projection method, a flux-plotting cption, and a
subprogram for simple time-dependent calculations based on reacticn rates

from the main program.

Keywords: breeding performance, computer codes, fluid-fueled
reactors, fuel-cycle costs, nuclear analysis, optimizations, conceptual
design, cores, delayed neutrons, equilibrium, fission products, neutron
flux, parametric studies, processing, time dependent.

COMPUTER COLE ABSTRACT

Neme: ROD

Computer for Which Code is Designed: The code is designed for
computers in the IBM-360 series which have directly addressable
storage of 300 thousand words or more.

Problems Solved: For nuclear reactors the code solves the eigenvalue
problem with or without a critical concertration search for one
dimension or for a two-dimensional synthesis, giving flux and fission-
density distributions. It performs a fuel-cycle analysis, including
costs, for circulating-fuel reactors, either at equilibrium, for
continuous processing, or time-dependent (by assuming a separable
time-dependence) for batch or continuous processing. The equilibrium
problem may be solved for up to three independent fuel or fertile
streams. The equilibrium concentrations for the fuel-chain nuclides
and up to 200 fission-product nuclides are obtained. The optimum
values of selected core-design and fuel-cycle parameters may be ob-
tained, based on the maximization of a selected function related to
the reactor performance.

Method of Solution: The neutromics calenlation is performed by a
multigroup, one-dimensional or synthetic two-dimensional diffusion
calculation, including multiple thermal groups with neutron upscatter.
The equilitrium calculation uses the reaction rates from the diffusion
calculation to determine the equilibrium concentrations of the fuel-
chain nuclides. The concentrations of the fission products are ob-
tained from a self-contained two-group calculation. An iterative
process is continued until the diffusion and equilibrium celculations
converge on a common set of nuclide concentrations. The optimization
is based on the gradienteprojection method. The time-dependent calcu-
lation (optional) uses average reaction rates from the main calcu-
lation to calculate the concentrations of the principle fuel nuclides
as a function of time.

Restrictions on Complexity of the Problem: The major limiting values
which restrict the complexity of a problem are 15 energy groups,

 
14.

including four thermal *roups, 30 nuclides per region, 10 regions

per dimension, 2 dimensions, 50 nuclides in the equilibrium calcu-
lation, 200 fission products, and 20 optimization variables.

Typical Machine Time: The running time on the IBM 360/75 varies widely
depending on the type of problem. Single cases require from about
one minute for a one-dimensional problem with six groups (5 fast,

1 thermal) to bout 5 minutes for a two-dimensional synthesis problem
with 9 groups (5 fast, 4 thermal). Cases run as part of a series (as
in an optimization) run in a half to a third the time required for a
single case (because they are started with the flux distribution from
the previous case). An optimization with five variebles, nine groups,
in one dimension runs in about an hour.

Unusual Features of the Program: The ability to closely model the
behavior of a ei:rculating-fuel reactor, including such factors as the
loss of delayed neutrons from fuel circulating outside the core, is an
unusual feature of the program. Others are the availability of rou-
tines for optimization and for flux plotiing.

Related and Auxiliary Programs: The code is designed to use a micro-
scopic cross-section tape generated by the code XSDRN.

Status: ROD is in production use at ORNL on the IBM 360/75 and 360/91.
Machine Requirements: About 300 thousand words of core storage and
three 1/0 devices excluding input-output and system requirements are
needed by the progrem. Two additional I/O devices, for auxiliary
output and flux-plotting, are optional. Plotting requires a CALCOMP
CRT plotter.

Programming Language Used: FORTRAN IV.

Operating System: IBM 05/360 with FORTRAN H compiler.

Programming Information: The program consists of about 6000 FORTRAN
statements. Arrays of fixed dimensions are provided for all data
within the program, which requires about 300 thousand L-byte words of
core storage.

Users Information: The code and report may be obtained through the
Argonne Code Center at Argonne National Laboratory.

CHAPTER 1

INTRODUCTION

The Rod (Reactor Optimum Design) code is unigue among reactor anai-
ysis codes in two respects; it was developed for the core design and fuel-
cycle analysis of circulating-fuel reactors; and it incorporates a package
for the optimization of certain design parameters. It is limited to one-
dimensional, or a synthesis of two one-dimensional, neutron diffusion cal-
culations, and is therefore suited for conceptual design studies of re-
actors rather than the detailed calculation of a given core geometry.

Circulating-fuel reactors, which include the aqueous homogeneous and
the molten-salt reactor types, are different in several characteristics
Prom fixed-fuel reactors. The fuel is perfectly mixed so that its com-
position at a given time is the same everywhere in the system. However,
there may De more than one fluid stream, as when a fertile stream is used
as a blanket, or the fuel may be circulated through a fixed moderator, as
in the molten-salt reactor, so that the overall core composition may be
different in different core zones. Circulating-fuel reactors are usually
designed for continuous processing of the fuel to remove fission products
and to adjust the fissile concentration. In many designs, the fuel
reaches an equilibrium composition in a relatively short time. The calcu-
lation of the reactor performance at equilibrium is then 2 most important
consideration. Finally, in circulating-fuel reactors, delayed neutrons
emitted from the fuel circulating outside the core, as in a heat exchanger,
are largely lost to the chain reaction and must be accounted for in the
reactcr neutron balance. The ROD code has been designed to take all of
these factors into account.

ROD also includes a subprogram for nonequilibrium calculations,
‘designed to calculate an average performance for a reactor over some
interval of time (e.g., a reactor lifetime), either with batch fuel pro-
cessing or with continuous processing. This option may also be used to
calculate the aversge performance cf a reactor in the interval from start-
up until equilibrium is established. The method uses average reaction
rates from a space-energy dependent calculation to calculate the time-
dependent concentrations of the most important nuclides. This is, of
1.2

course, an approximation, in that space-energy and time-dependent effects
are not considered simultaneously.

The optimization package in ROD is based on the gradient-projection
method, or the method of steepest ascent. It will very a given set of
parameters (e.g., core dimensions, processing cycle times) within limits,
in a series of cases to search out the values of the parameters which
maximize the value of a given objective function (e.g., the breeding
ratio, the inverse of the fuel-cycle cost). Optimization may be used in
combination with a parameter survey; for example, the effect of a given
parameter can be determined wits other parameters adjusted to their

optimum values for each case, rather than merely held fixed af some arbi-
trary value.
2.1

CHAPTER 2

THE HISTORY OF RCD

The ROD code was not "written" but rather "evolved". Parts of ROD
were written, put together, taken apart, and revised by a number of people
over a long period of time. A code with the scope and versatility of ROD
could probably not have been attained without this long period of develop-
ment. However, the evolutionary cheracter of ROD has resulted almost in-
evitebly in some disadvantages, chiefly that the input and output lack a
consistent format, that many sections of the code have not been described
by their awthors except in the original FORTRAN, that parts of it are
seldom used or cbsolete, and that the program has become complex and dif-
ficult to change. Fortunately, the code was considersbly unified in
adapting it for the IBM System 360 computers in 1968.

In the beginning (in the 1950's) fluid-fuel reactor caleulations were
made with the one-dimensional diffusion-theory code GNU, written in machine
languege at General Motors Corporation, and ERC (for equilibrium reactor
calculation), an equilibrium code written in FORTRAN at ORNL. In 1960,
GNU was replaced by MODRIC, also a one-dimensional diffusion-theory code,
but written in FORTRAN, which made modification of the program more prac-
tical. At this time, of course, the neutronic and equilibrium calculations
were performed separately.

The moment of conception for ROD came in 1961 when J. L. Lucius,
under the direction of L. G. Alexander and T. W. Kerlin, joined MODRIC
and ERC into a single code called MERC.Z In this combination, a neutron
diffusion calculation alternated with an equilibrium calculation, so that
reaction rates were supplied from the diffusion calculation to the equi-
librium calculation, and new equilibrium concentrations were supplied to
the succeeding diffusion calculation until both converged on a single set
of concentrations. This process is still the heart of the ROD calculation.

Over the next few years the code was expanded and improved. The
fission-product treatment in ERC was expanded to treat first 75 and later
125 nuclides. The number of fuel streams for whicn equilibrium could be
calculated was increased from two to three. A provision was added for
calculating the withdrawal of fuel at a final concentration beyond the
2.2

equilibrium burnup — useful in calculating certain solid-fuel cores such
as a pebble-bhed. A two-dimensional synthesis was developed, by

C. W. Craven, Jr., in which a two-dimensional calculation was synthesized
from two one-dimensional calculations; for example, a cylindrical core
from an axial and a radial calculation.

In 196%, T. W. Kerlin suggested that the most efficient method for
finding the set of parameters which gave the best performance in a parti-
cular core design was to use a computerized optimization technique. A&bout
this same time, W. L. Kephart at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant
had developed an optimization code (unpublished) based on the gradient-
projection method.” We decided to link MERC with the optimization pack-
age; the results was a combined code called OPTIMERC. Development of
OPTIMERC continued through 1965 and it was used extensively for molten
salt reactor caleulations through mid-1968.

The OPTIMERC code had one major operational fault, which was that
the entire program would not fit into the core of the IBM T7090 computer
in use at that time. During a calculation, therefore, information was
continually stored and retrieved from magnetic tape. This resulted in
long running times — up to 2 or 3 hr for complex optimization prob-
lems — and frequent job failures because of tape input-output errors.

The IBM 360 Model T5, which became availsble at ORNL in 1967, seemed
ideal for a large program like OPTIMERC because of its large core ca-
pacity. To take full advantage of the new computer, however, it was
necessary to reprogram OPTIMERC to eliminate much of the information
handling. We decided not only to reprogram OPTIMERC for the Model 75,
but to take this opportunity to integrate better the various parts of
the program, and to enlarge the capacity of the code to handle larger
problems.

The programming of the new code, which was named ROD (for Reactor
Optimum Design), was undertaken by G. W. Cunningham, urder the direction
of J. L. Lucius and the guidance of C. W. Craven, Jr., H. T. Kerr,and
H. F. Bauman. The important new features of the ROD code were:

i. All operations, after reading of the cross-section information,
are contained in core.
2.3

2. Multiple thermal groups (with upscatter) are permitted.

3. Two-dimensional synthesis is performed by energy groups.

4. FERC was expanded:

a) up to four materials are permitted, of which three may be
treated as fuel streams,

b) the meximum number of nuclides in the equilibrium calcu-
lation was expanded from 25 to 50,

¢) the maximum number of fission-product nuclides was ex-
panded fram 125 to 200.

5. Standard optimization variables and objective function were
built-in (no programming required).

6. A standerd CITATION cross-section tape is read.

T. Cross-section sets are assigned by region; up to five cross-
section sets are permitted.

At sbout this time, M. J. Bell, of the ORNL Chemical Technology Divie-
sion, needed a method for calculating in detail the effects of the pro-
cessing removal of various fission products from a molten-salt reactor. He
used the basic ROD calculation, bub substituted his own subroutine for the
calculation of the fission-product absorptions. This treatment is now
an option in ROD. Its use is limited to single cases (i.e., optimization
is precluded).

In 1970, an option was added to ROD to permit the calculation of the
average performence of 8 reactor over one or more batch processing cycles.
It is based on a zero-dimension, one-group, time-dependent code (un-
published) written by R. S. Carlsmith in 1966, which we expanded and re-
vised for inclusion in ROD. Called HISTRY, it takes reaction rates from
the diffusion calculation to calculate the concentrations of the important
fuel nuclides as a function of time. The time-weighted average concen-
trations are then supplied to the next diffusion calculation, and this
iterative process continued until there is no further change in the
average concentratians.

This brief history of ROD shows how it bas grown and developed over
a period of years, and we can only assume that further additions and im-
provements will be made. Some future developments that have already been
suggested are:
2.4

1. Replacing MODRIC with ORNL's latest diffusion code, CITATION,
which would permit finite-difference two-dimensional calculations.

2. Reprogramming of the "solid-fuel" option (which was not included
in the conversion of OPTIMERC to ROD).

3. The standardization of the input format and the elimination of
dual nuclide-identifications.

Since some of these changes, and others not yet conceived, may be
made in the future, this report has been organized so far as possible
into independent chapters.
5.1

CHAPTER 3

THE FUNCTIONS OF THE ROD PROGRAM

The ROD program consists or four principal parts called MODRIC, ERC,
OPTI, and HISTRY. The functions of these parts, as well as several
important options, are described in this section. A flow diagram of the
program is given in Fig. 3.1.

MODRIC is the neutronics section of the code. It is a multigroup,
one-dimensional or synthesis two-dimensional, diffusion-theory calculation.
It can perform a criticality search, or simply solve the eigenvalue prob-
lem. It can be run independently, without preparing input data for the
other sections of the code. The main output of MODRIC is the critical
concentrations and the flux and fission density distributions.

ERC calculates the equilibrium composition of the reactor and per-
forms the economies calculations. It requires reaction rates from MODRTC
and in turn supplies nuclide concentrations for the next MODRIC iteration.
Tterations between MODRIC and ERC proceed until the calculations converge
on & common set of puclide concentrations.

ERC calculates the equilibrium concentrations of the principle fuel
nuclides, for which reaction rates are obtained from MCDRIC, and also
the concentrations of up to 200 fission-product nuclides, for each of
which it makes a two-group calculation based on a thermal cross section
and a resonance integral. The two-group cross-section data, along with
fission yields, are stored in a separate section of the data deck known
as "permenent data."

The 250 ERC nuclides may be divided into as many as ten groups for
processing, each with its own processing equation in each stream. Cost
data mey be supplied for any of the principle nuclides from which the
various components of the fuel-cycle cost are calculated. Most of the
ROD output is assembled in the ERC section, including the neutron balance,
fissile inventory, breeding ratio, fuel yield, and feed and production
rates for the prineiple nuclides.

OPTI is an optimization package, based on the gradient-projection
method. It controls the running of a series of cases, in which certain
reactor parameters may be varied systematically within limits, in order

to find, within some tolerance, the set of parameters which gives a
maximum value of 2 prescribed objective function. Parameters which may
be varied by OPTI include region thicknesses and fuel volume fractions,
the boundary position between adjoining regions, processing cycle times,
and, in HISTRY, the time in a batch cycle that the feed is switched from
one fissile fuel to another. The objective function is a sum of the
following components, each of which may be weighted with an optional
constant coefficient, including zero: breeding ratio, fuel yield, recip-
rocal fueli-cycle cost, reciprocal discounted fuel cost, specific power,
an inverse function of the meximwum fast flux, and a function of the breed-
ing gain and the specific power called the conservation coefficient.

HISTRY is a subprogram which can calculate the concentrations of the
principle fuel nuclides as a function of time, rather than just at egni-
librium. It uses reaction rates obtained from MODRIC-ERC (MERC), and
supplies time-weighted average nuclide concentrations to the next iter-
ation of MERC. The iteration process proceeds until MERC and HISIRY con-
verge on a common set of concentrations. The HISTRY option is designed
to calculate the average performance of a reactor during a batch proces-
sing cycle, or over a reactor lifetime of several processing cycles. It
calculates the discounted fuel cost, based on a present-worth calculation
of all purchases and sales of fissile fuel and carrier materials, over
the lifetime of the reactor for a specified discount rate. It also pro-
vides useful information on the feed and production rates and inventories
of the principle fuel nuclides as a function of time. Its main limitation
is that the space-~energy calculation is considered independent of time;
which resulis in some lack of rigor in the burnup calculstion. ROD-HISTRY,
therefore, should not be considered as a substitute for more sophisticated
‘burnup codes.

Among the main options available in ROD, perhaps the most useful is
the "variables specified” option. This is a provision in the OPTI section
of the code to control the running of a series of cases in which any of
the standard optimization parameters ("variables") are preset to any de-
sired values. After the base case, essentially the only data reguired
are the values of those parameters which are to be changed from the
3.4

preceding case, since all other data are held fixed. Furthermore each
case is started with the fiux and fission density distribution from a
previous case, which gives, typically, a factor of 3 or 4 saving in
computation time over the running of an identical series of cases in-
dependently.

The output options are very important. So much output is potentially
available from the (typically) 60 or TO cases of an optimization problem
that we have devised en elsborate system for selecting output. The ceases
are divided into four categories as follows:

1. A base case [the first case run).

2. The final or cptimum case from an optimization; or the "variables
specified” cases when this option is selected.

%. The final case from each optimization cycle (gradient projection).

L. Intermediate cases in an optimization.

The output itself is divided into 29 segments, any or none of which
may be selected for each type of case above. In addition, an input edit
of 15 segments is available. Two independent sets of output may be
specified for any problem. The first, or "detailed" output, can include
any or all of the edit options. The second, or "short" output, can in-
clude most of the edit options except some of the infrequently required
tables. Either set may be omitted.

Finally, an opticn is available for flux plotting. It is included
in the output options by type of case as described ebove. The plotting
information is recorded on magnetic tape for use on a CRT (cathode ray
tube) plotter. The fluxes for any or all energy groups may be selected
for plotting on either a linear or logarithmic scale.

INPUT DESCRIPTION

The input for ROD is divided into four main sections:
A. MODRIC, including HISTRY

B. ERC
C. Fission product and delayed neutron data
D. OPTI

The input description is given as concisely as possible. Items marked
by an asterisk are discussed in greater detail in the following section,
"Discussion of Input.” The numbers following the varieble name, where
glven, are suggested values for the data. These are intended tc be helpful
to users with little or no experience with ROD, and may not be appropriate
for every case.

The input instructions are intended to be self-explanatory; hcwever,
the following introduction may be helpful.

The diffusion calculation is one-dimensional, along a line such as
a reactor axis or radius. The reactor composition must be specified for
the various regions along each line of computation. The results of the
calculation are applied to a three-dimensional volume, ususlly in spher-
ical or cylindrical geometry. For 2-D synthesis caleulasions s in partic-
ular, it is necessary to specify the composition of the subregions of the
reactor that are not along an axis or radius of calculation. Usually a
number of subregions are of the same composition; for example, axial,
radial, and “corner” blanket subregions may all have the same composition.
A superregion is a set of subregions all of the same composition. The |
superregion composition 1s specified by assigning a volume fraction for
each material to that superregion. |

A material is defined by its nuclide composition. There are two
classes of materials; those of fixed camposition, such as a graphite
moderator or a Hastelloy-N structural material, and those of composition
determined by the feed, processing, and nuclear reaction rates of the
system. The latter materials are referred to as streams; a fuel stream
for a molten-salt reactor, for example, typically consists of the carrier
salt nuclides, the fissile and fertile nuclides, and the fission-product

nuclides.

CHAPTER 5

DISCUSSION OF INPUT

Many of the features of ROD require more exposition than is appro-
priate for the preceding section, "Description of Imput”. Such items,
which have been marked with asterisks in the description, are discussed
ir this section. 3ach discussion is keyed to the appropriate irput card
number.

4-12 Convergence Information
Refer to card A-L2 for a discussion of the convergence criteria.
A-13 HISTRY Control Information

Converter.treeder optian. At the beginning of a batch processing
cycle, a converter reactor may have a temporary excess of fissile material,
because fission-product poisoning has been reduced to zero and fissile
material {(e.g., =°U) mey be aveilsble from precursors (e.g., =>>Pa’ pro-
duced in the previous cycle. HESTRY normally “sells” any excess fissile
material. ‘(he converter-breeder option provides the following alterna-
tives, which apply when kop exceeds 1.0:

1. Shut off the eriticality search. This allows the excess fissile
to be retained in the system, thus deigying the point at which fissile
Teed must again be resumed. This expedient introduces a small error in
the fissile balance, (vecause ope is greater then 1.0) but may be the
vest alternative when k off only slightly exceeds 1.0 for a short time,

2. Witndrew feed in the criticality search. Note, however, that
it is usually not practical to withdraw feed from an actual reactor.

5. Vithéraw, in the criticality search, uranium nuclides in the
proportions present in the fuel stream. This simulates withholding some
of the uranium separated from the fuel at the end of a cycle, and feeding
it back as needed during the following cycle, before resuming normal feed.
The simulation is imperfect in that the instantaneous fuel composition is
used rather than the composition at tiz end of the cycle. This alterns-
tive is recommended when considerable excess fuel is available at the

beginning of a cycle.

 
5.2

Second feed. For reactors with plutonium feed, where uranium is
recovered at the end of a cycle but plutonium is not, there is an ad-
vantage in switching to a uranium feed near the end of the cycle. To
activate this option, enter the time in the cycle at which the feed is
to be switched and specify the ERC number of the key nuclide of the
second feed (e.g., 5, for 235U, for enriched urenium as second feed). Also
specify the feed fractions for the second feed on cards A-21 to 3k.

A-19 HISTRY Data

Frequency of output. The frequency of output is determined dy
specifying the number of timesteps ir a data storage interval. A fre
quency of ance or twice a year is adequate for most of a typical cycle.
However, the fuel composition usually changes rapidly at the beginning
of a cycle, and the program provides for 12 times the normal {requincy
of output at the beginning of a cycle, that is, data ance or twice a
month. SHIFT specifies the total number of printouts at the higher fre-
quency {starting with the first at time zero).

Fertile buildup option. Certain fuel cycles are characterized dy
a fissile inventory which starts at e high level and decreases. (me
then has the option of starting with a lower fissile and fertile ine
ventory and adding fertiie materisl with time instead of removing fissile.
To exercise this option, specify the final fertile atam-density desired
as TEMX, and enter a smaller atum-density for the initial value.

A-19.)1 HISTRY Carrier Cost Control Infcrmalion

Fuel carrier cost data sre usually part of the ERC input. The
carrier cost in HISTRY is calculated from the ratio, carrier cost per
kilogram of thorium purchased, which is calculated from ERC data as
follows:

YD, {sT(d,1)%(M))

1=-I,NS
M=NSC(T)

sI(1,1)

SCR = + W111)

where
SCR = the carrier cost ratio,
5.3

STI(M,1) = the inventory of carrier nuclide M in material 1,

SI(1,1)} = the inventory of thorium in material 1,

WL(I,1) = the cost per kilogram assigned to each nuclide,

NSC(I) = the ERC numbers of the carrier nuclides specified on card
4.15.1.

£-21 AISTRY Nuclide Information

The HISTRY subprogram is set up for a specific canfiguration of the
ERC data as follows:

Nuclides 1 to 12 in order are: =2Th, pg, 3y, Bey, 235), 236,
257,238, 239py, 240py, 24lpy, ang 242py.

HISTRY nuclide 13, fixed sbsorlers, corresponds +o the summation of
ERC nuclides 13 to 50, except 25.

HISTRY nuclide 14, fission products, corresponds to the summation
of ERC nuelides 25 (lumped fission products}, 229 (1%Sam), and 231 (15iam).

A-35 Atom Dens. ties by Materiai

By convention, the fuel stream is material 1, the fertile stream,
if any; is material 2, and the moderator, if any, is the last material
specified.

A-30 Super Region Subregion Correspondence

The "super region” wes conceived as a convenient method of indicating
The distribution of materials (that is, the volume fractions) ia regions
of the 2-D reactor that do not lie on one of the calculational axes. It
is convenient to assign subregions of identical composition the same
super region number. (The same form of data is followed for a 1-D reactor,
although the form then has no special utility.)

A=) Croup Structure

When only one therms) group is indicated, the upscatter treatment is
shut off. We have noted that the use of multiple thermal groups with
upscatier, although valuable in certain cases, results in increased
running time by a facto: * 2 or more.
5.4

A-42 L3 MODRIC Convergence and Seerch Information

A certain balance in the convergence requirements of the various
sections of the code 1s essential to the efficient functioning of ROD.
It is convenient wo use EPSL, the tolerance for Koper as a reference.
Experience has shown that the ratio of the value of a given convergence
criterion to that selected f£c~ EPSL Should be about as indicated in
Teble 5.1. The recommended absolute value of EPSL of 1.0 X 107% is
adequate for most single or "variables specified” cases, and gives results
for the breeding ratio and fissile inventory consistent to about one part
per thousand. It is sometimes necessary to tighten the convergence cri-
teria for difficult optimization problems, because the direction of the
optimization iepends on the ratio of the results of two very similar
cases, and therefore may be very sensitive to slight imprecision in the

individual casés.

Tabls 5.1. Recommended Balance Among Convergence Criteria

 

 

teput Card Namz Description esto tat
EPSL
A-43 EPSL Tolerance for kK rp 1.0
AL2 EPSl Convergence on k_ ap 0.3
AL2 EPS2 Convergence on fission density 3.0
A-12 CTPL Tolerance, upscatter acceleration 1.0
A-12 CDELT Convergence, upscatter acceleration 0.1
B-2 CINVEG Convergence, ZRC atom densities 1.0
B-4 SEPS Tolerance, MERC balance 10.0

 

The balance between tightness of convergence and the running time is
critical for optimizations. When the convergence criteria are set tight
enough (say, 107° for EPSL) to get very precise derivative calculations,
the running times become long. If set too loose (say, 10" for EPSL) the
derivative calculations may became so imprecise as to direct an optimization
5:5

vector in a false direction. Optimizations usually run most efficiently

at moderately tight convergence (near 10™% for EPSL).

Two tricks’ are employed in ROD to save running time (refer to card
A-12). We have found that optimization runs can be made efficiently with
relatively looser convergence wren the convergence is tighter for the
tare case. This gives a firm starting flux distribution for the first
optimization case, whereas otherwise The flux distribution may tend to
change over the first few cases even though the convergence criteria are
satisfied. The other trick is tc loosen the convergence slightly for the
first MERC iteration, since it is wasteful for the diffusion calculation
to be tightly converged until it has received a set oi altered concen
trations from ERC. To accommodate this provision, =nd-rto prevent MERC
from stopping with a fortuitous balance while MODRIZ and ERC are not con-

verged, the program requires a minimum of two MERC iterations per case.

A-it3 MODRIC Search Information

 

The value of dC/dk, the ratio of change in composition to change in
K pp? is highly dependent on the reactor composition. The best guide
Tor selecting an initial value is tc look at the final value calculated

in a similar case (given as CPl in the output).
ALL Criticality Search Nuclides

It is usually more efficient to specify as search nuclides all the
nuclides in whe fissile chain rather than just the main fuel nuclide.
Specifically, those nuclides whose concentrations tend to vary with the
concentration of the fuel nuclide should be included as search nuclides,
while those nuclides which tend to reach an equilibrium concentration
independent of the fuel nuclide should not be included. If such "in-
dependent” nuclides are treated as search nuclides, they tend to cause
the ecaleulation to oscillate between MCDRIC and ERC. Suspect this effect

if more than three MERC iterations are required for convergence.
A-L5 Two-Dimensional Synthesis Information

The two-dimensional synthesis is described in Chapter 7, p. 7.6.
By convention, for a 2-D synthesis in cylindrical gecmetry, dimension
l is axial and dimension 2 is radial.
5.6

In the 2-D synthesis, there is a provision for adjusting the flux
in the core to take into account neutrons which leave the core in the
transverse direction. The region specified as "core" can only be the
center region of the reactor. The computed net flow of neutrons out of
this region (by group) determines a buckling for the calculation of
transverse leakage" in the other dimension. The leakage neutrons may
be distributed in proportion tc ths absorptions in as many regions as
may be desired. These are the "transverse leakage distribution" regions

and should always include the core region.

A-46 Region Information

 

A reascnable number of mesh spaces per region might range from 5 for
a small region to 50 for a large region. Avoid large differences in the
size of a mesh interval fram one region to the next. The running time
is not very sensitive to the number of mesh spaces, and is moderately
affected by the number of regions.

The fission-density distribution is calculated over 111 regions

specified as containing fissile material.
A148 and 50 Shell Thicknesses and Attenuation Coefficients

If desired, regions may be separated by "shells" in which the neutron
current may be attenuated (refer to Appendix B).

A-52 Buckling Option 1

This cption calculates the buckling by group and region from the

equations:
Slab:
2 _ Tt 2 n 2
B” = (F= 55) * (= >
Cylinder:
2 _ pL 2
B™ = (7 + 5) ?
where

¥,2,h = perpendicular dimensions of the reactor,

 
DoT

¥ = constant for calculating the extrapolation distance,

D = diffusion coefficient, a function of group and region.
A-55 MODRIC-ERC NWuclide Number Correcpondence

The fissionatle nuclides (for which fission yields are given on

card C-2) must be assigned ERC nuclide numbers in the range 1 to 15.
A-58 Cross-Section Set Assigrment

For many calculations the use of a single cross-section set weighted
for the average flux-spectrum is adequate. However, Jor cases in which
the flux-spectrum effects are different in different regions of the re-
actor, cross sections appropriate to the various spectra can be prepared
and assigned to the different regicns.

B-1 ERC Data

A "MERC iteration" is one pass through MODRIC and ERC. Typically
two or three MFRC iterations are required for convergence. Normally,
output is obtained for only the fing! iteration. For the purpose of code
development, some of the ERC and HISTRY output may be obtained each ~
iteration.

The fission-product reference element must ~orrespond to an artifi-
ciel element in MODRIC which has cross sections for a 1/v absorber with
22% = 1.0. ~

Some of the important fission products (e.g., ~*Sm) may be included
explicitly in the multigroup diffusion calculation, if desired. To do
this, select fission product option 2, list the nuclides in the MODRIC-
ERC correspondence table, and include them on the cross-section tape.

Such nuclides are edited separately by material in the second part of the
ERC output table {output option 7), but are included in the lumped fission
rreducts in the preceding summary neutron balance.

Base-case cnly option. When this option is specified the progrem
will stop after running the base case (case zero) even when the data deck
is otherwsie set up for the cptimization or variablesespecified options.
Tt may be used to check the base case before proceeding with, say, a long
optimization run.
5.8

The processing study option substitutes a more sophisticated fission-
product treatment for that normally used in ERC. It is described in
Appendix D.

Three processing cost options are availeble (refer to card B-24).

For molten-salt reactors, the processing cost depends mainly on the volume
of salt streem processed, and is, therefore, usually calculated on the

"volume basis.”
B-2 ERC Convergence and Other Data

The atom-density damping/forcing coefficient is a factor by which the
calculated change in atom density per iteration is multiplied. It is
usually set less than 1.0 to dampen cycling of the ator densities from
iteration to iteration.

The limit cn the change in atom density permitted per iteration is
used to help prevent cycling and to prevent atom densities from becoming
negative. The limit is in effect for each ERC iteration after the first.

The plant factor is defined as the anticipated energy production as
a fraction of the energy that would be produced if the plant were operated
continuously at full power.

B~-3 ERC Residence Times and (Other Data

The capital ¢o3T of a processing plant is assumed to be proportional
to its capacity raised to a fractional power called the scaling factor.

B-k Tolerance for MERC Convergence and Other Data

The fission-product thermal spectrum factor is defined as follows:

1
W = ————
7 298
Me fp (F527)
where
Au = lethargy width of fast energy groups,
T = temperature, °C.

The limiting factor for change of the recycle fraction is used to
dampen oscillations in ERC, and is applied in each iteration after the

first.

 
5.9

RB-11 Processing Cycle Times

A processing cycle time is the time reguired to process one system
volume of a material. Processing may consist oF several steps, and each
step can have its own cycle time. Usuaily the cost of processing can be
related to one or two main steps, and these may have a processing cost

factor, volume basis, assigned to them, as follows:

PCV . =U (1-57)
Io, n,j m,Jj ’

where
PCV = processing cost factor, volume basis,

n = number of processing cycle time associated with a given

processing step,
j = material number,

U = unit prceessing cost, dollars per cubic foot of meterial Jj,
for processing step n in a reference plant,

t = throughput, cubic feet of material j processed per dey in
step n in the reference plant,

SF = scaling factor. The capital cost of a processing plant is
assumed to be proporticnal to its capacity raised to a
fractional power, the scaling factor.

Processing cycle time 1 is used as a reference cycle time for calculating
the material holdup in the processing plant. Refer to Eq. (4.40),
Appendix A.

B-12 Processing Equations

The removal rate of any nuclide in ERC is calculated for each material
stream by the processing equation to which it is assigned. The removal
rate is calculated from the cycle times for the processing steps in which
it is removed. The cycle times that apply to each group eguation are in-
dicated on the processing equation card by entering a 1.0 in the position
corresponding to the number of each cycle time. For example, if the nu-
clides in processing group one are removed from material one in processing

steps 2 and L, the card for material one processing equation one should
5.10

have 1.0 entered in fields 2 (col. 16-21) and 4 (col. 28-33), which
correspond to cycle times 2 and 4; “he other fields are left blank.

B-20 Stream Data

 

The code calculates the volume of each material in the reactor core.
However, in a circulating-fuel reactor, a considerable volume of the fuel
stream is outside the core in piping and Leat exchangers. To allow the
code to calculate the true reactor inventories and inventory costs, the
amount of such external volume for each stream may be entered here.

In addition, if the stream is processed, the holdup time in the
processing plant may be entered. The volume of the holdup is then calcu-~
lated as a function of the reactor volume and the ratio of the holdup time
to the reference processing cycle time (processing cycle time 1).

Reserve fuel. If the reactor requires a fissile feed, a fuel reserve
sufficient to feed the reactor for some period of time mey be included in
the inventory. This is calculated from the net burnup (burnup less pro-
duction) of the feed nuclide (see Eg. A.43, Appendix A.

Fixed poison fraction. The strong fission-product poison 1°SXe may
be treated as a special case in molien-salt reactors. It is insoluble in
the salt, and is either removed by gas stripping or is absorbed by the
graphite moderator. Its true removal efficiency is not easily determined.
The problem has been side-stepped by assigning a removal efficiency of
1.0 to the gas-stripping process, and adding a fixed poison-fraction to
allow for the holdup of xenon in the moderator.

B-21 Removal and Recycle Data

The "removal efficiency” in processing may be defined as the product
of E, the fraction processed per cycle, and SCE, the fraction removed (or
lost, for nuclides which are recycled). Normally the removal efficiency
is 1.0, and E and SCE are automaticelly assigned the value of 1.0. This
value is not appropriate for gll nuclides, however, and other values may
be assigned on cards B-2l. Some examples are:

(2) Nuclides which are recycled (either back to the stresm fram

which they were removed, or to another stream) such as the uranium nuclides.
5.11

They may be assigned an SCE of 0.0, or a small non-zero value representing
the fraction lost per cycle in processing.

(b) DNuclides which are only partially removed by processing. An
appropriate removal fraction may be assigned.

(¢) DNuclides which are removed in smaller side streams taken from
another processing step. They may be assigned the appropriate processing
fraction. (Alternatively, such nuclides may be placed in separate proces-
sing groups, to which independent processing cycle times. can be assigned.)

(4) To simulate batch processing. E values greater than 1.0 may be
assigned to groups of fission products to simulate the greater removal in
batch processing compared to continuous processing for the same cycle
time. E values less than 1.0 may be assigned to nuclides such as the
plutorniums, when, because of decreasing concentrations during a cycle,
their removal at the end of a batch cycle is less thar would be obtained
by continuous removal (based on their average corcentrations and the av-
erage carrier discard rate).

Recycle fraction. Any nuclide which, wholly or partially, is not
removed in processing, presumebly remains in its original stream and is
returned to the reactor. In the calculation this is considered recycle
to the same stream, and the recycle fraction for a stream to itself is
automatically set at 1.0. Similarly, the recycle fraction from one stream
vo another stream is automatically set at 0.0.

Sometimes it is essential to recycle certain nuclides from one stream
to another, as in the case of a reactor with a separate fertile stream,
cr blanket. The key to the high performance of such reactors is in the
transfer of the fissile material bred in the fertile stream te a fuel
stream. DNuclides to be so transferred must be assigned ERC nuclide numbers
In the range 1 to 25, and their recycle fractions set appropriately on
cards B-21. The permitted values for the recycle fractions are 1.0 and
0.0. The lumped fission products may not be transferred.

B-22 Feed, Atom-Density, and Recycle Options

ERC works best when one nuclide, usually the most important fuel
nuclide, is selected as the "key nuclide" for these options. It is

normaliy assigned feed option 1, atom-density option 2, and one of the
5.12

recycle key-nuclide options 1 to 4. It is also usually a criticality-
search nuclide ir MCDRIC. This selection allows MERC tc either feed cor
sell the key nuclide, as required, as MERC converges on a solution.

For a reactor with a breeding ratio near 1.0, we might wish to sell
one nuclide if the reactor were a breeder, and feed another nuclide if it
were not. In theory, MERC could do this, but in practice, because of
imbalance in ERC, it may sell cone fuel nuclide while feeding the other.
We recommend that a preliminary case be run to determine the breeding
ratio, an! the key nuclide then be selected accordingly.

When the EISTRY option is used, atom-density option 2 (criticality)
may be specified for the key nuclide, but option O should be specified
for the nother nuclides in the fertile-fissile chain. This will hold the
atom densities fixed in ERC at the time-averaged values obtained from
HISTRY.

B-2% ERC Material-Balance Data

 

Any nuclide for which one of the non-zero recycle options was speci-
fied (card B-22) must be specified as its own processing source. In
addition, =3>Pa should be specified as a processing source for 77,
assuming that =U formed by the decay of 233Pa in the processing plant
is returned to the reactor. The processing group number determines the
processing equation applied to a given nuclide in each material. Note
that the processing equations are material-dependent while the processing
group assignments are not. The number of processing groups 1s limited to
ten. The reference processing cycle time is applied to all nuclides for
which no processing group number is specified.

B-24 Value of Materials

 

The value of each material may be specified (for the purpose of cam-
puting inventory and replacement costs) by assigning a value to one or
more nuclides in that material. A different value may be assigned to a
nuclide in the system from the value assigned to the same nuclide as feed
material. This allows, for example, that 2>°U be assigned a higher value
as feed material than as a part of the fuel stream, where iti is contami-
nated with =U.

 
5.15

Three copticns are available for computing processing costs. One,
based on the volume of material processed, has already been discussed.
The others are the welght-basis option, based on the weight of some
nuelide or nuclides processed, and the capital-cost-basis option, based
en the unit capital cost of the processing plant. (Refer to Eq. A.60,
Appendix A). The options are selected merely by making the appropriate
coefficient non-zero.

The preccessing unit-capital-cost factor is defined, for a reference

processing plant, as follows:

(€)(1)
U=———,
QS
where
U = unit capital cost factor,
C = capital investment, $,
i = interest rate,
Q = throughput of nuclide I, kg/day,
s = scaling factor (refer to card B-3).

D=1 Objective~-Function Coefficients

The standard equation for the objective function is:

C=aB+bY+ce/M+da/I + ef + fC+ g/d,

where

O
n

objective function,
a,b,c,d,e,f,g = coefficients,

B = breeding ratio,
Y = fuel yield, percert of fissile inventory per year.
M = fuel-cycle cost, mills/kwhr,
T = specific inventory, kg fissile/MW(thermsl),
F = flux factor,

F —-F

- kt
1014

F_ = allowable group-l flux; input on card D-2,

 
5.1%

EF, = @ maximum group-l point flux in the core, calculated
in MERC.

When (¥, - F) > 0, F is set to zero.

C = conservation ccefficient,
100(B-1)
- 2
12
D = discounted fuel cost (from HISTRY), in mills/kwhr.

D-2 Allowable Flux

 

The allowable group-l flux may be specified as required to limit the
fast-neutron damage to the materials in the Lore. Whenever the allowable
flux is exceeded, the flux factor, a negative term, reduces the value of
the objective function. The net effect is to srift the optimum to that
set of conditions which gives the highest performance consistent with a
peak flux exceeding the allowable flux by same margin which depends on
the relative weight given the flux factor.

D-6 Number of OPTI Cycles

The number of OPTI cycles (gradient projections) should be set to
stop the run before the rumning-time limit is exceeded. An OPTI cycle,
or gradient projection, consists of the calculation of derivatives to
determine a gradient vector, the taking of steps along the vector, and
the calculation of the maximum of the objective function along the vector.
When a run is stopped in the middle of a cycle, the information generated
for that cycle is wasted. Specifying zero as the number of cycles will
helt the calculation at the end of the base zase.

D-7 OPTI Control

Although 20 OPTI variables are allowed, there are good reasons for
holding the number of variables as small as possible. The most obvious
is to save running time. Less obvious but perhaps more important is a
certain decrease in precision as the number of variables ic increased.
This may be explained as follows: As steps are teken along a vector,

we can think of the variables one by cone reaching their optimum values
5-15

and continuing on beyond, until the variables beyond their optima are
balanced by those that have not reached their optima, and the objective
function reaches its maximm. The greater the number of variables, the
more likely that some of them will stop at some distance from their true
optima. This effect can be countered by tightening the convergence
criteria and reducing the step size , but, of course, at the expense of
increasing the running time.

When a variable reaches one of its limiting values, it may be held
there for any specified number of optimization cycles. During these
cycles, no derivative is calculated for the held variable and it does not

affect the size of step of the other variables.
D8 OPTI Control

The minimum ATPHA is the mechanism which halts the step-reduction
procedure. If a step reduction would result in an ALPHA less than the
minimum, the reduction is not permitted and the optimization is terminated.
The minimum ALPHA determines the "fineness" to which the optimum is lo-
cated. In reactor calculations there is little incentive to locate the
optimum with great precision, and the step reduction is often bypassed,
or held to one reduction by the choice of minimum ALPHA.

End-effect options. The end-effect is described in Chapter T, p.T7.15.
End-effect option 1 applies a reduction in the ridge-analysis factor when-
ever the derivative is negative, as well as whenever it changes sign.

When this option is used, it may be advantageous to select initial values
for the variables such that the initial derivatives are likely to be
positive.

End-effect option 2 is applied only after a normal first step has
been unsuccessful. This must occur at least once at the end of every
optimization. The variables with negative derivatives are then restrained
(by a factor of 0.01) and steps are started along e vector determined
essentially by the positive derivatives. The interval scan is omitted.
Often, successful steps can be taker along the new vector. In general, we

recommend the activation of end-effect option 2.
5.16

D-G Optimization Variable

The sensitivity of an optimization to a given variable is influenced
by the range assigned that verisble. The step factors ALFHA and BETA are
defined as fractional factors of the range: therefore, when the range is
large, the steps will be large and the resulting change in the objective
function is likely to be large. The optimization works best when the
change in the objective function is about the same for each variable —
that is, when the "derivatives" are of roughly the same magnitude. Cften
this is not the case. When the optimization is dominated by one or two
variables, the "ridge effect” may result; that is, the path of the
optimization jumps back and forth across a "ridge" as the valus of the
dominant variable is alternately too high and toc low. The "parallel
tangent" and "ridge-analysis"” techniques are used in OPTI to get around
the ridge effect (see Chapter 7), but the optimization must run several
cycles to accumulate the information required for these techniques. When
the user knows from experience that a given variable will tend to dominate,
the sensitivity of the optimization to this variable can be reduced by
giving it a small range compared to the range of other veriables. However,
a small range is not always practical. The range should be large enough
to include, with high probebility, the optimum value of the variable
(otherwise the entire run could be wasted). When the range cannot prac-
ticelly be reduced, the sensitivity to a given variable may be reduced by
assigning it a fractional initial ridge-analysis factor. The ridge-
analysis factor is applied to both derivative and vector-step calculations.

Frozen variable. If the minimum and maximum vaiues of a variable
are set equal to its initiel velue, it becomes & "frozen" variable. No
derivatives or other calculations are made for frozen variables. The
frozen variable has two uses:

(1) To remove a variable from the optimization, perhaps just for a
particular run, without removing it from the edit of the variables.

(2) To satisfy the requirement that the region thicknesses on either
side of a boundary variable be variables, without increasing the number
of active variables.

THEORY
MODRIC~-ERC™

MODRIC is a typical neutron-diffusion-theory code. It allows 50
neutren energy groups with downscattering from a group to any of the
following ten groups. IT has been modified in ROD, where only 15 energy
groups are permitted, but where a multiple-thermal group treatment with
upscatter has been added.

It will perform concentration searches on specified elements. The
output consists of critical concentrations, group macroscopic cross sec-
tions, normalized nuclear events (absorptions, fission, leakage, etc.) by
region and group, absorptions and fissions by material and region, group
flux distributions, and fission density distributions. The basic MODRIC
equations are given in Appendix B.

Basically, ERC solves two main equations. They are:

Equation (7.2) is just the conservetion requirement, saying that enough
fissile material must be added (or removed) in iteration s to overcome
the neutron production deficiency (or excess) in iteration (s-1). These

are inner iterations in ERC. The terms are defined as:

7.3

The sequence of ccmputations goes es follows. MODRIC, with trial
velues of the N; 5» calculates absorption rates which are converted (in
ERC) to the reaction rate coefficients, C; 5k These are used in Eq. (7.1),
with specified feed and removal rates, to calculate new values of the
N; 5° Equaticn (7.2) then indicates the adjustment to be made in the con-
centration of a key fissile nuclide in order to restore the balance be-
tween neutron productions and losses. Since this new concentration is no
longer consistent with the solution of Eq. (7.1), an adjustment in feed
rate, Q ; , or removal rate coefficient, 9 4s must be made and Eg. (7.1)
solved again for a new set of N;5'ss s, which are then tested again in Eg.
(7.2). This sequence of computations is indicated in Fig. 7.1. Note that
an essential step in the ERC inner iteration, not shown on Fig. 7.1, is
the adjustment of ; or % 45 by application of a single equation from the
coupled set, Eq. (7. 1} with the adjusted N; 5 obtained from Eg. (7.2),
prior to the next complete solution of the Systen of equations, Eq. (7.1),
with the revised feed or removal rate.

The equilibrium concentration calculations in ERC use reaction rate
coefficients (Cs; x) obtained from an earlier MODRIC calculation. How=-
ever, the inition concentrations used in the MODRIC calculation will not,
in general, agree with the equilibrium concentrations computed by ERC.
‘This new set of concertrations will alter the neutron spectrum and flux
distribution, thereby changing the reaction rate coefficients. Therefore,
it is necessary to repeat the MODRIC criticality calculation with the
latest value for the estimated concentrations to get new reaction rate
coefficients. This process is repeated until the MODRIC and ERC con-
centraticns converge.

The reaction rate coefficients (C 5) used in ERC are spectrum-
averaged cross sections which are available directly from MODRIC. The
MODRIC calculation gives As and VF. os the absorptions and neutron pro-
ductions in nuclide i in region k, normalized to 1.0 total neutron pro-
duced. The distribution of nuclear events between multiple streams in a
region is accomplished by introducing the stream volume fractions, Lax?

Two-Dimensional Synthesis

The two-dimensional synthesis in ROD is based on the assumption that
for a symmetrical cylindrical reactor, the shape of the flux distribution
in the axial direction everywhere is well represented by the flux distri-
bution along the axis, end similarly that the shape of the flux distri-
bution in the radial direction everywhere 1s well represented by a radial
flux distribution at the midplane. The complete spatial flux distri-
bution may then be inferred from two one-dimensional calculations, one
along the axis and the other along & radius at the midplane.

The two-dimensional synthesis is implemented in the MODRIC section
of ROD as follows:

Starting from an assigned initial flux distribution (e.g., cosice),
a new set of fluxes and ncutron reaction rates is calculated, for the
first neutron energy group, along the reactor axis. At each region
boundary, the net transport of neutrons (for the group) across the bound-
ary is calculated. The user may select an appropriate boundary (e.g.,
that of the core region) where a buckling is calculated for use in the
second dimension.

Still for the first energy group, a new set of fluxes and reaction
rates is calculated for the radial dimension. The radial fluxes are
normalized to the axial dimension. The buckling cbtained from the first
dimension may be applied to specified regions to calculate the transverse
leakage or net transport of neutrons transverse to the line of calculation.
TT

The reactions of these neutrons are assigned to the various nuclides and
regions in proportion to the reaction rates obtained for specified regions
selected from the first dimension (the transverse leakage distribution
regions). At the same time the net forward transport of neutrons across
each boundary is calculated, from which an appropriate boundary may be
selected for the calculation of a buckling to be used in the first
dimension.

MODRIC then performs the same calculations for each of the remaining
energy groups in twrn. The reactions from the axial and radial calcu-
lations including the transverse distribution reactions are summed and
normalized to give the required fission rate. MODRIC iterations are cone

tinued until the flux, fission density, and k__ . convergence criteria

ff
are met.

OPTI

 

The optimization routine (OPTI) is based on the method of steepest
ascent. It permits up to 20 reactor parameters to be varied, within
limits, in order to find a maximum (or minimum) in a specified objective
function, calculated from the MERC output (see Chapter 5, paragraph D-1),
It requires two links with MERC; one to transmit the values of the vari-
ables to MERC at the start of the celeulation, and another to calculate
and return to OPTI the resulting value of the objective fumction.

Starting values, and ranges, defined by upper and Xcwer limits, are
supplied for each variable. OPTI transmits the starting values to MERC,
which runs a base-point case and returns the base-point result (value of
the objective function). OPTI then changes the first variable by a small
increment (ALPHA, a specified fraction of the range) and obtains a new
objective function result from MERC to approximate the (partial) derivetive
of the objective function with respect tc the first variable:

2-2. 2
i i

where
7.8

0 = objective function,

x = variable i.

By this method, derivatives are calculated for each variable in turn.
The derivatives determine the direction of a vector (in hyperspace) origi-
nating at the base point and extending in the direction of the most rapid
increase in the objective function, that is, the path of steepest ascent.
OPTI now changes th= values of all the varigbles simultaneously in order
to teke steps along this vector. The variable with the largest derivative
is changed by a unit, (BETA, a specified fraction of its range), while
each of the other variables is changed by a fraction of a unit, determined
by the ratio of its derivative to the largest derivative. At the end of
each step, a new value for the objective function is obtained from MERC.
OPTI compares this value with the previous one; if it is greater, by a
speciried increment, OPTI proceeds with another step; if not, a parabola
is fitted to the last three points along the vector, and the maximum of
the parsbola is taken as a new base point. If the value of the objective
function at the maximum of the parabola does not exceed the value for the
last successful step, the parabolic fit is rejected and the last successful
step is taken as the new base point.

Additional optimization cycles, like the one just described, are
started from each new base point, until the increase in the objective
function in the last cycle is less than a specified increment, or until
no successful step 1s found in the cycle. OPTI can then declare the last
base point to be the optimum, and terminate the search, or can reduce the
size of the increments (ALPHA and BETA) and carry the search further.

Reducing the size of the increments increases the precision of the
optimization; in particular, the finite-difference approximation to the
derivative approaches the true value as the increment ALPHA approaches
zero. In practice, the precision of the optimization is limited by the
precision of the calculation of the cbjective function; e.g., in ROD, bv
the precision of the MERC calculation. The increments must not be reduced
to the point that the vector calculations founder in the imprecision of
the reactor calculations.
7.9

The steepest ascent method works very well for regular response
surfaces; however, in many practical problems the response. surface forms
a sharp ridge; the steepest ascent method is notoriously inefficient for
such cases. beczuse the path of the search tends to zig-zag back and
forth across the ridge. However, acceleration methods have been developed
which handle such problems fairly well. Two acceleration methods avail-
able in OPTI are the "psrallel tangent’ method and a method invented in
the development of OPTIMERC called the "ridge analysis" method.

Consider, for simplicity, a two-variable problem, so that the response
surface can be represented b,” & contour map in which the x and y coordi-
nates are the two variables, expressed as fractions of their range, and
the contour height is the value of the objective function. For the case
of a regular response surface, the maximum, or peak, is surrounded by
nearly circular contours as shown in Fig. 7.2, so that a vector indicating
the path of steepest ascent points toward the meximum. But suppose that
the contecurs are elliptically elongated, forming a sharp ridge, as shown
in Fig. 7.3. A vector indicating the direction of steepest ascent from
any random point {except on the ridge) now points across the crest of the
ridge rather than toward the peak. Consequently, the search path tends
to zig-zag back and forth across the ridge, gradually working up toward
the peak (vectors Vi to Vg, Fig. T.3).

The "ridge analysis" method is based on the observation that the
derivative, d0/dY, with respect to = dominating variable will change sign
every time a vector crosses a ridge. If the Y component of the succeeding
vector is decreased by a suitable factor every time ao/ay changes sign,
the X componert beccmes relatively more important and the vectors {Ra to
Rs, Fig. 7.k) tend to follow the ridge.

The "parallel tangent” method is based on the observation that alter-
nate base points tend to line up along a ridge. When this is so, a vector
determined by two alternate base points will point toward the peak (vector
P-, determined by base points Vz and Vy, Fig. 7.5).

Both methods may be used similtaneously (vector RFs, determined by
base points Rp and Ry, Fig. 7.6).

The ridge-analysis method is "free", that is, it does not require
that additional cases be calculated. The parallel-tangent method, since

it employs an "extra" (P) vector not in the normal series, requires that
at least one additional case be calculated tc determine whether any
successful steps can be taker along the P vector.

In ROD, the ridge-analysis method is used in calculating every vector
after the first, and the parallel-tangent method is used to calculate
"RP" vectors after every normal vector following the third. Experieace
has shown that the RP vectors, although much of their work may have al-
ready been done by the ridge-analysis method, are successful often enough
to justify using both methods together.

Another phenomenon, the "end effect”, occurs as the optimum is
approached. It occurs because the approximation to the derivative is
one-sided; that is, the increment is taken in only cme (the positive)
direction. If a variable is at about its optimum value, irnuireasing or
decreasing its value can only give a poorer result; therefore, the one-
sided approximation to the derivative becomes negative as the optimum is
approached, whereas the trne derivetive would approach zero. Toward the
end of the optimization, often all the derivatives but one have beccme
negative. The presence of one positive derivative means that one vari
gble, at least, must have a more favorable value; it may be, however,
that no successful step is fourd. This can occur when the variables with
negative derivatives are actually at sbout their optima, so that stepping
in either the positive or negative direction would be unfavorable. As
the variable with the positive derivative is scepped toward its optimum,
the others .tep off {heir optima, and the net :fect is an unsuccessful
step. There are several theoretical solutions to this problem; the most
obvious is tc use a two-sided approximation to the derivative. However,
this would ouble the number of cases required to calculate derivatives.
We have elected to provide two options that require no additional cases.
The first is to apply the reduction in the ridge-analysis factor whenever
the derivative is negative (in addition to whenever it changes sign).
Thus variables with consistently negative derivatives are restrained more
and more as the optimization proceeds. The other is to limit the move-
ment of variables with negative derivatives (by a factor of 0.01) after
a normal first step along a vector has been unsuccessful. This is done
7.16

instead of the interval scan described below. The procedure is bypassed
when the derivatives are either all negative or all positive.

Another procedure in OPTI, called the interval scan,is used when the
first step along a vector is unsuccessful. It runs one or more cases
along the vector in the interval between the base point and the first
step, starting a factor of 0.6 from the base, to test whether the optimum
might lie in this interval. If one or more successful steps are taken in
this intervel, the usval parsbolic fit is applied; if not, the cycle is

considered unsuccessf:il.

HISTRY

 

The premise of the HISTRY code is that a great amount of useful
information can be obtained from a simple time-dependent reactor calcu-
lation when a good set of average reaction rates are available for the
principle nuclides in the fertile-fissile chain. HISTRY can give an
approximation to the time-dependent fuel.cycle analysis of a reactor,
adequate for many purposes (e.g., conceptual design studies) where the
effort of a full space-energy-time dependent calculation mer not be
Justified.

HISTRY solves the time-dependent material.balance equations for the
chain of 12 nuclides beginning with ®°2Th and ending with ®#%pu. All
other neutron absorbers are lumped together into two groups; the fixed
absorbers, mainly moderator, core structure, and fuel carrier nuclides,
and the fission products. The fission products may be treated either as
8 fixed poison, or as a poison which builds-in as a parabolic function
during the cycle.

The first step in HISTRY is a criticality search. The initial k,
is adjusted so that k ee
nizclides or mixtures of nuclides may be designated for feed or for sale
‘depending on whether or not the reactor is breeding at the given time-
step). After the critical concentrations are determined, the concen-
trations of the other nuclides at the end of the time-step are calculated
from the material-baslance equations. The above calculations are repeated

ff
will average 1.0 over each time step, Various

for as many time-steps as specified over the reactor cycle. For the case
7.17

of batch processing, the reactor lifetime may be divided into several
batch processing cycles. HISTRY calculates atom densities, inventories,
neutron absorptions and productions, and purchases or sales for each
nuclide as a function of time. The time-averaged atom densities are
calculated and returned to MERC for the next iteration.

The fuel and carrier costs are calculated by the discounted cash
fiow method.

BASIC MODRTC EQUATIONS

The following description of the basic MODRIC equations is taken
fram Ref. 1.

The diffusion equation which describes the neutron flux o9(r,g) at
a point r in the reactor within the energy group g has the form:

 

VE(r,g) + R(r,g) &(r,g) + S(r,g) =0, (B.1)
where
. g+10
R(r,g) = i. - 5, (B.2)
g-1
XP) + 2 MU é(r,i)
g s = +g
S(r,g) = ig-10 . ( .3)
D(a)

For the geometries here Vo = ¢” + £ ¢’ , where

O fer a slab,
1 for a cylinder,
2 for a sphere.

In order to state the problem in its entirety, it is convenient to
change the notation so that the dependence of the variables and parameters
on & particular energy group is omitted. Thus, the diffusion equation can

P

i

be written:
¢7(x) + 2 ¢/(x) + R(r) ¢(r) + 5(r) = 0 . (B.4)

The boundary conditions at the origin (r = 0) and the outer boundary
(r = Ry) are:

 

*
May include the extrapolated distance.
B.2

a$(0) + 2pD¢’ (0) = ¢ , (B.3)

ap(Ry) + 2eD’ (Ry) = £, (8.6)

vhere a, b, ¢, 4, e, and £ are parameters which can vary with the energy
group.

Another type of boundary condition occurs between regions at radius
R.. This takes the following form for an interface with no shell:

[6(R;) = 208" (R)]_ = [(R) — 20" (R)], (8.7)

[6(R,) + 2D¢" (R)]_ = [$(Ry) + 2D¢’ (R)], , (8.8)
where the - and + signs refer to values at the left and right of the
interface respectively. An interface with a shell is a subregion from
BR; to Ry with attenuation of the neutron currents given by the following:

GROLA(R) — 2p¢’ (R)]_ = RO[6(R;) — 208" (Ry), (8.9)

RLo(R,) + 200 (R)]_ = EEOIG(R,) + 208 (R,)], (8.10)

Again, G and H can vary with energy group. The - and + signs refer to
values to the left of Ry and the right of Rs respectively. We can use
Egs. (B.9) and (B.10) for the special case of no shell by setting

BR; = Rs- For continuity of the flux and current across the interface,

G = H=1, but thic is not necessary if desired otherwise.

The nuclear constants for a 1/v absorber with a 2200 m/s cross section

of 1.0 barns are built into the code. Therefore, the reference element

mest correspond to an artificial element in MODRIC which has cross sections

for a l/v ebsorber with 02200 = 1.0.

Certain important fission products may be calrulated explicitly by
the mltigroup diffusion calculation in MODRIC, using fission product
option 2. Cross sections for such nuclides must be provided in the usual
format on the cross section tape.
Appendix D

THE PROCESSING STUDY OPTION

An Alternative Calculation of Fission-Product Poisoning

For some applications it is necessary to compute the fission-product
poisoning using a model other than the first-order removal process con-
sidered in the ERC calculations. An option has been provided in RCD with
which it is possible tc call a subroutine, named BELL, to ve supplied by
the user, to perform an alternative calculation of the lumped fission.
product poisoning (refer to card B-l). If this option is designated,
equilibrium concentrations will be computed in the ERC calculation for
only those nuclides trested explicitly in the MODRIC diffusion calculation.
When both the diffusion and equilibrium calculations have converged to
within the specified limits for a given value of the limped fission-product
concentration, the program will call subroutine RELL to obtain a new esti-
mate of the lumped fission-product concentration. This subroutine is
called with the following argument list: SUBRPUTINE BELL (C@NC, ABSRC,
PR, Y, BAL, P8, SV, RIFAC, ALPHA, FCC, C@NCFP, ETA). The varisbles C@NC
and ABSRC are each dimensioned for fifty values in the calling program
end contain, using the ERC nimbering system, the atom densities, in
atoms /fbarn-cm, and the relative sbsorption rates per unit atom density,
gbsorption/ (fissile absorption-atom/barn-cm), for the ERC principle nue
clides. The definitions of the remaining variables are:

BR = breeding ratio,
Y = fuel yield, percent per annum,

BAL = ratio of two previous iterations of the converged
equilibrium calculation,
8 = reactor thermal power, MW,
SV = fuel salt volume, ft,

RIFAC = Tescpance integral factor, flux per unit lethargy/thermal
flux,
ALPHA = spectrum-averaged neutron cross section for a 1/v absorber
whose 2200 m/sec cross section is 1.0 bern, barms,
FCC = fuel-cycle cost, mills/kwhr(e),
D.2

C@NCFP

H

new value of lumped fission-product concentration computed
by subroutine BELL, atoms/barn-cm,
ETA = effective value of n€, neutrons produced/fissile sbsorption.

With the exception of the variable CENCFP, the values of all the
arguments are computed by ROD for use by subroutine BELL. RELL uses the
information in the argument list, and an independent set of fission yields,
decay schemes, thermal neutron cross sections, and resonance integrals to
campute the fission-product inventories and poisoning for a given set of
processing conditions. The individual fission-product poisonings are
sumned, and this lumped fission-product poisoning is used to compute the
concentration of tie reference 1/v absorber which would produce the same
poisoning. This concentration is the value of the variable C@NCFP which
is returned to the calling program in ROD. The diffusion and equilibrium
calculations are repeated using the new value of the lumped fission-product
concentration, and the process is continued until the lumped fission-
product concentration from two successive iterations converges to within
a8 predtermined relative error. At this point the entire process may be
repeated for another set of processing conditions, or the calculations
may be terminated. When using this option to calculate the poisoning by
the lumped fission products it is necessary to remove the permanent fission
product data from the ERC input and to specify atom-density option O on
ERC input card B-22 for the lumped fission-product nuclide. This specifies
that the value of the lumped fission-product concentration is not to be
changed in the equilibrium calculation.
