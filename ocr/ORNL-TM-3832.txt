DESIGN STUDIES OF A MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR
DEMONSTRATION PLANT

H. L. Watts

ABSTRACT

The MSDR, a 350-MW(e) Molten-Salt Reactor Demonstration
Reactor, is based on technology much of which was demon-
strated by the MSRE. The cylindrical vessel (26 ft diam by

26 ft high) houses a matrix of graphite slabs forming salt
passages having a volume fraction in the core of 10%. The
flow of fuel salt is distributed so that the temperature
rise along any path is the same — from 1050 to 1250°F. In
the primary exchanger, heat is transferred to barren carrier
salt (in at 900°F, out at 1100°F). In the secondary ex-
changer, heat is transferred to a stream of Hitec salt (in
at 800°F, out at 1000°F). The Hitec oxidizes tritium to
tritiated water which is removed and disposed of. The
Hitec generates steam at 900°F, 2L0O psi in a boiler, super-
heater, and reheater. Electricity is produced at an overall
efficiency of 36.6%. Soluble fission products are removed
by discarding the carrier salt every 8 years after recovery
of the uranium by fluorination. Volatile fission products
are removed by sparging the fuel salt with helium bubbles
in the reactor primary system. The fuel cycle cost was
estimated to 0.7 mill/kWhr for inventory, 0.3 mill/kWhr
for replacement, and 0.1 mill/kWhr for processing, giving
a total of 1.1 mills/kWhr.

 

SUMMARY

Co The ‘purpose of this study was to describe a semi-commercial-scale
molten-salt reactor and power ‘plant that would be based on the technology,
much of which was demonstrated by the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment.

The plant was designed to produce 350 electrical megawatts. The nuclear
conversion ratio is about 0,9, and the specific power is about 0.5 M(e)
per kilogram fissile. TL -

The reactor consists of a cylindrical vessel about 26 ft in diameter
and about 26 ft high filled with a matrix of graphite slabs forming flow
passages 0.142 in. thick by 9-3/8 in. wide and with a volume fraction in

 

 
 

the core of about 10%.. The reflectors consist of graphite slabs cooled
by a small flow of fuel salt. Flow through the core and ‘reflectors is
regulated by orifices 80 that the “temperature rise of the fuel, with
minor exceptions, along any flow path is approximately the same.

The fuel salt consists of a mixture of the fluorides of 7Li, beryl-
lium, thorium, and uranium (initially ®®°U). Salt leaving the reactor
at 1250°F flows through the tubeside of a shell-and-tube exchanger where

heat is transferred to a secondary salt stream composed :of barren carrier

salt. The fuel salt exits at 1050°F and is recirculated to the reactor.

Secondary salt enters the exchanger at 900°F and leaves at 1100°F.
It flows to a secondary exchanger, also shell-and-tube, where “the heat
is transferred to a tertiary salt. stream, a mixture of KNOg, NaNO, and
NaNOz known as Hitec. The purpose of the Hitec loop is to trap tritium
formed -in the reactor and which diffuses through the exchangers in the
direction of the steam system. ‘Tritium is oxidized by the Hitec to
tritiated water, which is readily removed for safe disposal. The Hitec

enters the exchanger at 800°F and leaves at 1000°F.
The heat exchangers are arranged SO ‘that, after the removal of
shield plugs, the heads may be removed and ‘leaky ‘tubes may be plugged
off by remotely manipulated equipment. }

Heat is transferred from the Hitec 5 water in the steam generator
which consists of a boiler, a superheater, and a reheater, all shell-
and-tube types. Steam at 900°F and 2400 psi is produced which, after
being expanded through high, intermediate, and low-pressure turbines,
generates electricity with an overall efficiency of 36.6%.

In the event that there is an interruption in the generation of
power, the reactor is drained through a freeze valve into a drain tank
provided with an NaK cooling system. The NaK system dumps heat to-a
free-flowing water stream by thermal convection. Hence, the system is
reliable even. when all power fails.

~~ Xenon and other noble gases are removed from the fuel stream by
sparging it with helium in a bubble generator located in a bypass. loop
-from pump discharge to pump inlet. After contacting the salt to absorb
noble gases, the bubbles are. removed in a centrifugal gas separator.

Following a holdup of about 6 hours in the drain tank, the gases pass
ld

through a particle trap for removal of solids. About half the gas is
recycled to the bubble generator. The other half is routed to a cleanup
system consisting of charcoal beds where the effective holdup time is
about 90 days, allowing for almost complete decay of radioactivity. The
effluent is recycled to pump shaft seals and other purge points.

Removal of fission products from the fuel stream is effected by
discarding carrier salt every 8 years after fluorination to recover
uranium. The spent salt is stored for future recovery when a complete
molten-salt processing plant is available.

Although the main control of the reactor consists in adjusting the
concentration of fissile uranium in the fuel salt, auxiliary control is
achieved by means of 6 cruciform control rods loaded with ByC and clad
with Hastelloy N.

~~ INTRODUCTION

The primary objective of the Molten-Salt Reactor Program at ORNL is
to develop a high-performance thermal breeder reactor that utilizes a
molten salt fuel and breeds on the thorium-222U fuel cycle. Conceptual
designs for such reactors have been studied for several years. A ref-
erence design for a 1000-Mi(e) plant and the uncertainties that must be

resolved to achieve a commercial thermal breeder plant were described

 
 

recently in report ORNL-45h1 and An Nuclear Applications and Technology.
The Molten-Selt ‘Reactor Experiment (MSRE)® - - a 7,5-Mi(t). reactor — was
operated from December 196k to December 1969 to demonstrate the feasibil-
ity and investigate some aspects of the chemistry, engineering, and .
operation of molten-salt reactors. Although successful operation of
the MSRE was a notable achievement, _the power density was low, the heat
was rejected to air, and the experiment lacked many other complexities .
of a power breeder plant, The next step in the Program plan for devel-
oping the breeder is the construction of a Molten-Salt Breeder Experiment
(MSBE) .*

The MSEE would be a 150-1(%) reactor that would have all the tech-
nical features of a high-performance breeder. The maximum temperature
(1300°F) and peak power density (11k W/ee) would be as high or higher
than in the reference breeder design. Supercritical steam would be
generated in the reactor steam supply system, and the plant would have
the fuel reprocessing facilities required for a breeder. The purpose
of the MSBE would be to demonstrate on an intermediate scale the solu-
tions to all the technical problems of a high-performance Molten-Salt
Breeder Reactor (MSER).

An alternative approach to the development of a commercial MSBR
has also evoked interest. This approach emphasizes more rapid attain-
ment of commercial size but more gradual attainment of high performance.
The step beyond the MSRE is construction of a 300-MH (e) Molten-Salt
Demonstration Reactor (MSDR). The purpose of the MSDR would be to

demonstrate the molten-salt reactor concept on a semi-commercial scale
while requiring little development of basic technology beyond that demon-
strated in the MSRE.

The objective of the study reported here was to prepare a conceptual
design of an MSDR plant. The overall engineering design of the plant and
the details of some aspects of the design are described in this report.
Basic information on chemistry, materials, neutron physics, and fuel
reprocessing was reported recently in ORNL-U4541 and is not repeated here.
The problem to which this study was addressed concerns design of a
first-of-a-kind reactor plant which could be built with a minimum of
development and from which higher performance breeder plants could evolve,
Concepts which could not be used in future breeder plants were to be
avoided.

Two major simplifications were made in the design of this demon-
stration plant as compared to the design of the breeder plants. First,
the MSDR has only such chemical processing as was demonstrated in the
MSRE and has no provision for removing fission product poisons on a short
time cycle. This results in a much less complicated chemical processing
plant, although it means that the reactor has a breeding ratio less than
one and is therefore a converter. The second major simplification is
that the power density was made low enough for the graphite core to last
the 30-year design lifetime of the plant, thus simplifying the reactor
vessel and eliminating the equipment for replacing the core. Other
areas of design were also simplified by the very low power density of
the reactor as will be noted in the description of the plant that follows.

We believe that the design described here represents a molten-salt
reactor ‘plant which is feasible to build, will produce a significant

amount of electrical power, ang would be a ‘major step toward a useful

family of breeder reactors. -

GENERAL DESCRIPTION

This plant is designed to produce 750 thermal megawatts in a single-~
fluid molten-salt reactor. Thorium in the primary, or fuel, salt is
converted to fissile uranium. Because of the simplified salt processing,

the conversion ratio is of the order of 0.9. The heat generated in the

 
 

reactor is transported to the primary heat exchangers as the salt is
circulated through the reactor and heat exchangers by the primary pumps .
Figure 1 is a simplified flow diagram of the system. In the primary heat
exchangers the primary salt gives up its heat to the secondary salt which
is circulated between the primary and secondary heat exchangers by the
secondary salt pumps. The secondary salt has the same composition
("LiF-BeFs) as the primary carrier salt. Since it contains no fissile
or fertile material, it is very mich less radiocactive than the primary
- salt.
The secondary salt : is cooled in the secondary heat exchanger by 8 )
third molten salt which circulates between the. secondary heat exchangers
- and the steam generating equipment. This third salt is a eutectic mix-,
ture of nitrite and nitrate salts (KNOg -NaNOg ~NaNOs ) « The primary purpose
- of this third salt loop is to capture tritium which. is generated in the
primary salt and diffuses through the heat exchange surfaces of the pri-
mary and secondary systems and into the third salt system. It would
migrate into the steam system if this third salt, having oxygen avail-
able to tie up the tritium, were not present. The nitrite-nitrate salt
cannot be used as a secondary coolant for reasons that will be discussed
later. oo
The steam system is conventional. It has high-, intermediate-,
and low-pressure turbines, coupled to a generator, which take steam from
the steam generator-superheaters, and reheaters at a temperature of 900°F.
The high-pressure turbine throttle pressure is 2400 psia. The boilers
and superheaters are of the once-through type with recirculation of water
through the boiler for flexibility in control. The condenser, deaerator,
water treatment, and feedwater heater chains are conventional and will
not be described. The steam conditions were chosen somewhat arbitrarily
as being suitable for a first-of-a-kind plant. | oo oo
One of the essential auxiliary systems for a molten-salt reactor
is the cover-gas system for the primary salt circuit. Since salt must
be kept free from oxygen, an inert atmosphere (helium) must be maintained
“in the gas space associated with the fuel-salt system. Many of the
fission products are volatile and these highly radioactive gases must be

cooled, stored, contained, and safely disposed of by either radioactive

decay or permanent storage. This off-gas system, which will be described
in detail later, must have a guaranteed heat removal system, fission:
product absorber system, pressure regulating system, and means of sepa-
rating liquid (salt) entrainment. The off-gas system is quite involved
and must have an extremely high degree of dependability —.a requirement
that makes a certain amount of redundancy necessary. -

A second auxiliary system which is extremely important is the after~
heat removal system. Because the fuel can be drained from the molten-
salt reactor and because of the low power density, there is no need for
an emergency core cooling system, but the drain tank for the primary
salt must have a cooling system that is positive and independent of the
power supply or operating machinery, if possible. The ‘afterheat removal
system is thus one of the essential auxiliary systems. :

The fact that there are no solid fuel elements to be fabricated,
loaded, reprocessed, and refabricated makes the molten-salt reactor
unique. Many advantages accrue from this fact, but it also makes neces-
sary an on-site chemical processing plant for maintaining the salt in

a clean and operating condition. This chemical processing plant is

another auxiliary system which is essential to the plant. ‘When a molten-

salt reactor is to be used as a breeder, the chemical processing system
becomes relatively involved. In addition to keeping the salt clean and
low in oxygen, and adjusting the uranium inventory, the fission product
- poisons must be removed from the primary system on a fairly short time
cycle. If, on the other hand, the plant is designed only as a converter
having a breeding ratio of less than unity, the fission products can .
be removed on a long time cycle and: the chemical plant becomes much more
simple.

Even in a converter reactor it is uneconomical to allow the fission
product poisons to remain in the primary salt for the life of the plant.
The fuel carrier salt with the fission product poisons is therefore dis-
carded after about 8 years of operation. Provision must be made for
recovering the fissile material and for disposing of the radioactive
carrier salt. Such a chemical processing plant is an integral part of
this reactor power plant design. The processes involved are those which
were used successfully to process the salt in the MSRE.

A nuclear power plant requires other auxiliary systems such as
control, instrumentation, and safety systems. Basic and inherent safety
features of the molten-salt reactor permit the safety system to be con-
siderably less complicated than it is for some nuclear reactors. Because
of the necessity to bring the reactor to a temperature above the melting
point of the molten salt before the system can be loaded, a startup heat-
ing system is required.

The MSDR plant is housed in two buildings, the reactor building and
the turbine building. Since the latter is a conventional mill-type
structure, little effort was put into designing a building for this part
of the plant.

Considerable attention was given to design of ‘the reactor building.
It consists of a cylindrical shell with a hemi spherical top. Contain-
ment integrity is provided by a 1/2-in.-thick steel liner, completely
surrounded by concrete. The concrete is for biological shielding as
well as providing strength for resisting tornadic winds and missiles,
in accordance with the accepted standards for design of reactor buildings.

One unique feature of the reactor ‘building shown in this report is
that it is supported by a large circumferential concrete ring, with
about one-third of the structure hanging from this ring below grade and
two-thirds of the building extending above’ ‘the ‘support ring. It was
felt that this ‘building configuration would have better seismic resistance
thah one which totally extended above the support. Obviously this feature
is not mandatory and the design of a particular reactor building would
depend on the topography, geology, and seismology of the site.

a The cylindrical pert. of the ‘building contains all the radioactive
systems and components, such as the reactor, primary and secondary heat
exchangers, off-gas system, chemical processing plent, and primary drain
tank, The cells for ‘this equipment have a sealed steel containment in
addition to the building containment. On the ‘thick concrete ring, but
outside the building containment, are located the steam generator cells,
the eongrol. room, and water-cooled heat sinks “that provide for afterheat

removal.

- PRIMARY SYSTEM

Reactor *

“The reactor is one of the simplest components in the entire ‘plant

due to the basic simplicity of the circulating fuel concept. In previous }

molten-salt concepts the reactor has not been fully described. For this
reason the mechanical design of the reactor is given a more thorough
treatment in this report. Other parts of the plant have received a mich
more cursory treatment since these items have been more fully discussed
in previous design studies. There is little heat transfer that ‘takes
place within the reactor itself, ‘the fission heat being transported out
side the reactor vessel by the circulating fuel salt. The only heat
transferred within the reactor vessel is that ‘produced by gamma. and
neutron heating of the graphite and the vessel Valls. By making the
power density of the reactor low, the graphite will not undergo exces-
sive radiation damage during the life of the plant. Hence, the reactor
tank can be an all-welded vessel. Also, since the vepor pressure of’
the fuel salt is low even at high operating temperatures, the reactor
need not operate at a high pressure and the walls can be relatively
thin. The temperature coefficient of expansion of graphite is only
about one-third that of the Hastelloy of which the vessel is made,
however, and this requires some design ingenuity to prevent the differ
‘ential expansion from causing problems when the reactor is brought to
temperature. | oo A
The reactor consists of a cylindrical vessel, with dished heads,

which is filled with a matrix of graphite slabs that form flow passages
for ‘the fuel salt. The inner surface of the vessel is lined with an
average thickness of 2- 1/2 ft of graphite as a reflector. ‘This reflector
conserves neutrons by reducing leakage to a very Low value and ‘thereby }
also reduces the amount of radiation reaching the vessel wall. The |
reflector is attached to the vessel so that 1t 2 moves with the vessel les
they expand during heatup. EE

The internal structure of the reactor is made up of the core matrix,
the axial and radial graphite reflectors, and two internal metal dished

heads which locate and support the graphite of the axial reflectors.

Figure 2 is an elevation of the reactor vessel showing the internal
graphite structure. Figure 3 is a plan view of the reactor vessel.

It is important to maintain controlled flow passages in the reactor
vessel and to regulate the flow so as to get a uniform temperature rise
in all flow passages as the salt flows through the reactor. Since the
power distribution 1s non-uniform, this requires different velocities
of salt in the various flow passages. It is also desirable to minimize
cross flow and to have axial flow from bottom to top of the reactor core.
The flow in the reflector and along the vessel wall should be straight
through from bottom to top. =

The graphite should be mounted within the core in a manner that
will preserve the geometry of the flow passages, yet, at the same time,
accommodate the dimensional changes due to temperature differences and
radiation damage in the graphite. The factor of about 3 Xx 10° in./in./°F
difference in thermal -expansion between graphite and Hastelloy must also
be taken care of in the design. A further limitation is that graphite,
of the required grade, cannot be made in large monolithic blocks.

The reflector should have a minimum salt volume in it in order to
keep the fission rate low. Ideally, only such salt as is necessary to
cool the reflector should be present. This makes it desirable to have
a few large pieces of graphite in the reflector rather than many small
pieces. For this reason the graphite of the reflector is laminated of
smaller pieces cemented together, baked, and machined to shape after
baking. The low flux encountered in the reflector permits this fabri-
cation technique to be used. By this lamination procedure, blocks of
the correct size and shape for the axial and radial reflector sections

‘are made up from graphite slabs approximately 2 in. thick by 12 in.

wide and from 4 ft to 21 ft in length.

In order to control the unavoidable gaps that result from the expan-
sion of the vessel relative to the graphite, both radial and axial
reflector blocks are attached to the vessel and move with it while the
core matrix remains stationary. The method of accomplishing this will
become evident in the description of the reflectors that follows.

Modified dished heads having a flat center area and an overall size

slightly smaller than the vessel heads are used to hold the graphite

fit against the reactor vessel heads. The concave surfaces of these
heads are machined to form concentric rings having flat "lands" or
surfaces about 12 in. wide to which graphite sectors are attached. The
graphite sectors, having radii corresponding to the radius of the ring
to which they fasten, are mounted on these heads with gaps of varying
widths between the concentric rings formed by the graphite. Spaces
‘equal to the gap width between rings are also left between the ends of
adjacent graphite sectors in each ring as they are assembled on the head.

The method of mounting the 'sectors”on the heads is shéwn in Fig. U4.
Three holes are drilled in each graphite sector from the center of the
surface that is to be in contact with the head. One is at the center
“of the sector and one is near the end. Into these holes are placed
Hastelloy plugs 2 in. in diameter by L in} long. These plugs are are. -
drilled and tapped axially for 3/lU-in. cap screws, They also have
3/4-in.-diem transverse holes at a distance of 3 in. from the tapped
end. The graphite sectors have horizontal holes so that 3/4-in.-diam
pins inserted through those holes will pass through the transverse holes
in the metal plugs and fix them in the graphite. Holes in the heads
permit the graphite sectors to be fixed to the heads by cap screws that
engage the metal plugs in the graphite. The holes for the screws that
engage the plugs in the ends of the graphite sectors are slightly over-
size to permit differential expansion between the graphite and the metal
head. | |

The widths of the slots between the .concentric rings of reflector
were computed to provide salt flow to the core in accordance with the
radial power distribution in the core. In making these computations,
the AP across the reflector was assumed to be 5 psi. The AP across
the holes in the head under the slots was also assumed to be 5 psi and
the number of holes required to furnish the required flow was calculated
with the results shown in Table 1.

After: the graphite has been installed in the reflector head, the
complete bottom assembly is lowered into the reactor vessel. Working
through the bottom hole in the vessel, the center gussets of the

reflector head are welded to matching overlapping gussets in the vessel
head, rigidly attaching the reflector head to the vessel at the center.
The periphery of the reflector head has 8 slots which permit it to
be lowered into the vessel, the slots sliding over the 8 vertical ribs
on the cylindrical wall. After having been lowered into position the
reflector head is pinned at these 8 points, tying the head to the vessel
but permitting radial expansion as the pins move in radial slots in the
ribs. Figure 5 shows this method of attachment.
The radial reflector is made up of laminated blocks of two different.
shapes, plus some odd-shaped filler blocks used to wedge the reflector
to the vessel wall. The outer reflector is made up of laminated wedges
about 10 ft long and about 3 ft high. . These wedges are machined to fit
the vessel wall at the 8 places where they are installed around the
inside vessel perimeter. By fitting each wedge approximately 1/16 in.

from the wall, any out-of-roundness of the vessel is accommodated. When
all pieces have been put into place, a retaining "T" iron is fixed to
the vertical metal ribs and wedging pieces of graphite are inserted be-
hind the "T" iron. Thus the outer reflector is made to move out with
“the vessel wall as it expands. Figure 6 is a plan. view of the core
‘which shows the reflector graphite as well as the reactor core matrix.

The inner layer of reflector is made up .of columns of graphite
approximately ‘1 ft wide by 2 ft thick by 21 ft long. These blocks are
also laminated from slabs similar to those used elsewhere in the core.
These vertical blocks are doweled into the bottom axial reflector pieces,
but the dowels are loose enough to permit the columns to float up from
‘the axial reflector while still being tied to it radially. The columns
are installed with 1/8-in. gaps between columns and the back wedges and
between adjacent columns. Also the bottom edge of each block has a 2-
in. by 1/4-in. slot machined on it to provide flow access to the'¥ertical
slot should any block fail to float when the reactor is full of salt.

At the top of these columns there are horizontal slabs of graphite
approximately 1 in. thick by 3 in. wide by ebout 2-1/2 ft long. These
slabs fit in milled slots and plug the gaps between columns at the top.
They are doweled to one of the columns and to the wedge of graphite
‘adjacent to the tank wall in order to provide orificing’ and tie the
columns to the wedges at the top to maintain the desired location of
the columns. The slabs rest against the top reflector when the reactor
is filled with salt, and they provide a 1/4-in.-thick salt plenum over
the radial reflector graphite.

The core matrix is made up of a square array of slabs approximately
1-3/4.in. by 9-3/8 in. in cross section. These slabs are stacked in
square cells approximately 11-1/2 in. by 11-1/2 in. The slabs are sepa-
rated by dowels which provide vertical flow passages approximately 0.142
in. wide running from bottom to top of the core. The plan arrangement
of the core is shown in Fig. 7 and Fig. 8. In addition to the slabs,
there are posts approximately 2-1/2 in. square that define the corners
of the cells. These posts have 6-in. dowels 1-1/4 in. in diameter on
the bottom end which fit into holes in the corners of a graphite "egg
crate" grid that rests on the bottom axial reflector. This grid defines

the core and prevents accumulation of radial expansion tolerances in any
region of the core. Figure 9 is a detail of the grid. |

Around the top of the core is a graphite "collar" which prevents

spreading of the vertical core pieces into the annulus between the core
and reflector. This annulus, approximately 0.75 in. wide, results from
the differential expansion between the metal vessel and the graphite.
The collar also blocks this annulus to prevent excessive flow in this
path of low pressure drop. Flow from the annulus has to cross through
the radial slots in the reflector and out the exit slots above the wedge
reflector pieces. Figure 10 is a detail of this collar structure.
The graphite core is assembled in the vessel and then orifice plates

are put on top of the core to make the core flow match the radial power
fg distribution. These flat plates are approximately 11-1/2 in. by 11-1/2
- in. by 1-1/2 in., with undercut edges to fit down into the cells formed
by the vertical posts. These plates have no intentional gaps and are
fitted as closely as tolerances permit. Resting on top of the cell side
plates, they leave a 1/8-in. gap between their underside and the top of
the five slabs making up the cell structure. Short dowels on the under-
side of the plates prevent the slabs from floating up and closing this

- gap. In the center of each plate is an orifice. The diameter of this
hole is 2.05 in. for the center cells and 0.74 in. for the peripheral
cells, with intermediate cells having holes of diameter proportional to
the radial power distribution.

These cover plates, in addition to providing orificing for the
different cells, perform an additional function of tying the core to-
gether at the top and preventing accumulation of expansion opening in
one location. On one side of each plate is a 3/l-in. dowel extending
1-1/2 in. above the top of the plate. After these orifice plates have
been placed on top of the core, rectangular tie blocks 1-1/2 in. thick,
3 in. wide, and 6 in. long, with two holes in them, are placed over the
dowels of adjacent plates to tie the cells together. At the same time,
the ties are not rigid and will allow some movement of the core if
needed. These links cannot float free of the dowels even if some cell
or cells stick and do not float to the underside of the top axial re-"
flector. Figure 11 shows the orificing and tying of the graphite.

8ix cells in the core are different from the other 375 cells. These
contain the sockets into which the six control rods are inserted. They
are made up of solid square prisms, leminated out of the core slabs, and
bored and machined according to the design shown in Fig. 12. These blocks
are made in sections as long as practical to machine, and the sections
are then joined to make a continuous cylindrical hole into which each
control rod is inserted. The holes are 7 in. in diameter and have a
1/2 in. orifice in the bottom to permit proper flow of salt to the
channel. oo

The control rods are cruciform in shape and 6-1/2 in. wide. This
provides a 1/4-in. radial clearance between the rod and the hole into
which each is inserted. The rods are made of 1/8-in. Hastelloy N en-
closing a 1/2-in. filler of boron carbide. When fully inserted, ‘the
rods extend to within 3 ft of the bottom of the core. When fully with-
drawn, the bottoms of the rods are just within the top reflector.

Pipe extensions around the control rod extensions penetrate the
top of the reactor cell shielding and the control rod drive mechanisms
are located outside the reactor cell on top of the shielding. The rods
will have to be replaced periodically as the high flux will destroy
the ductility of the Hastelloy. One rod is sufficient to shut down the
reactor, and only one rod will be used at any one time for control of

the reactor.

Primary Heat Exchanger

Primary salt is pumped through the three primary loops by three
salt pumps. Each pump discharges salt into two primary heat exchangers
in parallel. There are two heat exchangers in each leg in order to make
the fabrication of these units more practical. Each exchanger is about
26 in. in diameter and is in the form of a "U" with a tube length of
about 30 ft. Each has 1368 tubes of 0.375 in. OD with a wall thickness
of 0.035 in. Table 2 gives the data on the primary heat exchangers.
Table 3 gives the physical properties of the salt on which the design of
the heat exchangers is based. Figure 13 is a view of the heat exchanger

and Fig. 14 shows the detail of the head closure.

‘The heat exchangers are mounted horizontally, one leg of the "U"
being under the other. The tubesheet ends of the exchanger are access-
ible through a hole in the cell wall by removing a shield plug from the
hole. The head is flanged and bolted with metal "O"-ring seals backed
up by a thin seal weld. This permits relatively easy removal of the
heads for Plugging a tube in the event of a leak.

Primary Pumps

‘Sump-type centrifugal pumps: for circulating molten salts have been
employed for many years in experimental rigs and have been used success-
fully in two molten-salt reactors, the ARE® and the MSRE. These molten-
salt pumps are described in the ae” and i material will not
be repeated here. -

In the MSDR the pumps are mounted symmetrically on the top of the
reactor vessel. Each pump is submerged in a tank that has excess gas
volume to accommodate expansion of the salt. This volume communicates
with the primary system by a 6-in. line from each pump bowl to the center
dome ‘in the top of the reactor vessel. During normal operation, flow
down these lines returns the fountain purge flow from each pump to the
top head of the reactor. The pump suction line communicates with the
pump sump through a small leakage path in order to drain the sump when
the primery system is drained.

Each pump has a capacity of 8100 gpm and develops, a 150-ft head. In
order to purge xenon from the salt, about 10% of the flow from each
pump is bypassed directly from pump outlet to inlet. The bypass line
contains a bubble generator for admitting gas to the salt and a bubble
stripper for removing gas. The gas stripper removed about two volumes
of salt with each volume of gas removed, and this mixed stream is

directed into the drain tank. A venturi in this line is provided with

& l-in. connection to the gas space in the pump bowl. This arrangement

‘makes it possible to mix the pump seal purge gas with the stripped gas

and to send it to the drain tank and thence into the off-gas system.
This line also serves as a syphon break to prevent draining the system
through the gas separator discharge line in the case of a stopped pump
in any of the primary circuits.

In addition to providing the primary salt flow and the bypass flow,
a line from each pump discharge is manifolded into a line which drives
two Jet pumps in the drain tank. Each of these lines has a ball check
valve inserted in it upstream of the manifold. The jet pumps in the
drain tank return the entrained liquid in the ‘gas separator discharge
to the primary circuit, as will be described in the discussion of the
drain tank.

SECONDARY CIRCUITS

Heat from each primary circuit is transferred to a secondary salt
system. The salt in each secondary loop is circulated through the shells
of the primary heat exchangers and the tubes of the secondary heat ex- -
changers by a pump similar to the primery pump. The secondary circuit
is designed to contain a relatively small volume of salt.

The salt used in the secondary loop is ’LiF-BeFp (66-34 mole %).
Although it would be possible to use a different salt in the secondary
circuit, it was believed that the advantages accuring from using the
7LiF-BeF, salt justifies its use in the first demonstration plant. By
using this salt, any primary heat exchanger leak will be much less
troublesome than if ‘a different secondary salt were used. Also, the --

LiF-BeF; salt will remain nonradioactive, except for very short-lived:

activities, and thus meintenance of the secondary heat exchangers. will
be less complicated.

There are two secondary heat exchangers per secondary loop. These
are "U"-tube exchangers of the same design as the primary exchangers.
Because of the differences in the salt heat transfer properties, they -
are slightly larger than the primary exchangers. Table 4 gives the
design data for these exchangers. Ce

It may be noted that the secondary circuit isolates the primary cir-

cuit from the rest of the system. Because of the sensitivity of the

primary salt to oxygen, this is a desirable, if not necessary, feature.
Also, the secondary and tertiary salt circuits provide a double barrier
between the low-pressure fuel-salt system and the relatively high-pressure

steam system.
‘TERTIARY SALT CIRCUIT

The primary purpose of the tertiary salt circuit is to provide a
tritium trap to prevent diffusion of tritium from the primary circuit
into the steam system via the circulating salt systems. The tertiary
circuit uses a eutectic mixture of KNOs-NaNOz-NaNOs (Lh.2-48. 9-6.9
mole %) which has the commercial name of "Hitec." The oxygen in this
salt combines with the tritium to form tritiated water, which can be
recovered from the system. oo

Although the primary function of the tertiary salt loop is to trap
tritium, it also has certain advantages which offset, at least to a
degree, the complication of the additional pumps and heat exchangers
required for the third loop. The advantages derive chiefly from the
fact that the liquidus temperature of the nitrite-nitrate eutectic is
288°F, which relieves considerably the possible problems of salt freeze-
up in the steam generators. An additional advantage concerns the fact
that water will simply vaporize from the nitrite-nitrate salt and the
consequences of a steam leak are thus much less severe. In fact, this
salt could possibly be used with steam as a cover gas.

The nitrite-nitrate salt cannot be used as a secondary coolant
because it would react with the primary salt to precipitate thorium
and urenium oxides in the event of a ‘primary heat exchanger leak.

There is the additional danger of a reaction with the graphite of the
core. should nitrite-nitrate eutectic get into the primary system. oo

| The nitrite-nitrate salt will remain nonradioactive, except for
some e tritium, and thus the tertiary Loop can penetrate ‘the building
containment. This permits ‘the location of all the steam system equipment
outside ‘the contaimment and. makes it accessible. for direct maintenance.
It also removes the possibility of a pressure rise within the contain-
ment due to a leak in the steam system.

The corrosion resistance to Hitec is a consequence of the estab-
lishment of a passivating film on the containment metal. Cheaper

materials can be used for the piping and steam-generating equipment. of
this loop than is required in’ the primary and secondary systems. "It: is
intended to make the secondary exchangers out of 316 stainless steel:
because of the secondary salt in the tubes. The shells and piping,
however, could be made of Croloy. The tertiary pumps could also be fab-
ricated of Croloy.

As previously mentioned, the low melting point (228° F) of the Hitec
permits the feedwater to enter the boiler at temperatures that are in
line with current steam plant practice. Since the wall At mst be held
to a reasonable value (< 200 °F), “the salt temperature at the exit of the.
boiler mst be of the order of 700° ¥ if the ‘feedwater enters at about
500°F. This 700° °F salt cannot be returned to the secondary heat exchanger
because the freezing ‘point of the secondary salt is 856°F. To avoid oo
this low temperature and Still maintain an acceptable At across ‘the tubes
in the boiler, a bypass stream of hot tertiary salt is mixed with the
cool (700°F) salt to raise the temperature of the mixture to an accept-
able level before returning it to the secondary heat exchanger. The
total flow in the tertiary system is about 10 ,500 gm. of this, 27, 000
gpm flows through the steam generating equipment and is cooled to 00°F.
The bypass loop mixes 13,500 gpm of 1000° F salt with the 27 ,000-gpm
700° F stream and raises its temperature to 800° F before it enters the
secondary heat exchanger. A throttle valve in this bypass line ‘permits
temperature control for partial loading and transient conditions.

Data on the decomposition and corrosion of Hitec are insufficient
to be absolutely certain of the highest temperature that is allowable
and the type of cover gas required over the salt. It is intended to
limit the temperature to 1000°F and to provide an No overpressure until
more experience is gained. Indications are that a temperature of 1100° F
is ‘tolerable, and, if this is verified, steam conditions for a molten
salt plant. could be significantly improved. A report, ORNL-TM-3777, |
which is in preparation, will present | the knovm information on Hite

temperature limitations.

STEAM SYSTEM

The steam system conditions at the turbine throttle were chosen to
be 900 °F/2400 psi with 900°F reheat, but the steam system was riot specially
designed or optimized for the demonstration plant. Steam flows and tem-
peratures are shown on the simplified flowsheet of Fig. 1.

The steam generating equipment is, of course, quite different from
that in a fossil-fired plant in that the heat is extracted from a circu-
lating molten salt. On a completely arbitrary ‘basis the steam load for
the turbine-generator is divided between 6 boiler units, 6 superheater
units, and 6 reheater units. All these units are heated by the three
salt circuits comprising the tertiary salt system of the plant. The
boilers are divided into two units each simply because this results in

units of a size more easily handled. The entire steam circuit is a

once- through system where both the water and salt sides of the preheater,

boiler, and superheater are in series.

Feedwater from the conventional Facile chain enters the tube side
of a U-tube preheater at a temperature of L480°F and a pressure of 2600
psi. It passes from this unit first into a similar U-tube boiler and
from that into the U-tube superheater. These three units each have 100
tubes in shells about 12 in. ID. Additional data are given in Table 5.

of the steam cells are not, heated like the. reactor cell, but heaters and
insulation are, installed on the. piping and components. m1 steam and
water lines are run from each. piece of equipment in the steam cells from
manifolds, stop valves, ete. ’ located outside the steam cells. The
rupture discs on the tertiary salt system for relieving steam pressure .
in the event of a leak are installed in the steam cells in order to con-
tain the salt within the cell. .

. The: turbine-generator is shom as a tenden unit with one high-pressure,
one intermédiate-pressure, and two low-pressure casings on ‘one shaft
driving a single generator unit. The specific turbine-generator has not
been designated. -As has been. stated, the usual extraction points and
conventional feedwater handling are employed. No effort has ‘been mode
to detail the regenerative feedwater heating system or other. aspects of

the steam systen.

REACTOR BUILDING

The reactor building follows what has come to be a rather traditional
containment structure. Basically it is a cylindrical reinforced concrete
structure with a hemispherical dome. A sealed steel membrane, 1/2 in.
thick, lines the entire building and provides the containment. The con~
crete provides. protection against missiles resulting from tornadic winds.
The building is about 150 ft tall and about 112 ft in diameter. --

The building is suspended from a large concrete ring about 176 ft
in outside diemeter and about 8 ft thick. This arrangement gives & low
center of gravity to the building. Although seismic analyses have not
been made, it is believed that this method of construction may be more
stable to a seismic disturbance. The same basic design’of the building:
could be used if subsequent analyses or considerations related to:a .par-:
ticular site indicate that the building should be set on a foundation

at the bottom of the structure. Figures 15 and 16 show the elevation and
plan of the reactor building. The steam cells are appended symmetrically
outside the containment and rise from the concrete ring. Also mounted
on the ring and external to the containment are the three water tanks
which provide the heat sink for the drain tank cooling system. The
control room is also built on this ring outside the containment building.

Inside the reactor building are the cells containing the radioactive
portions of the plant. There are 5 sealed cells which have a common
atmosphere: the reactor cell, the 3 heat exchanger cells, and the drain
tank cell. These cells have water-cooling coils embedded in the concrete
walls with water plena at the ends of the cells for removing the heat
that leaks through the thermal insulation. Each cell is completely
lined with a 1/2-in.-thick 304 stainless steel membrane which seals the
cells from the remainder of the building. Penetrations into the cells
have been kept to a minimum and the interconnecting sleeves between cells
have bellows which permit differential movement between the membranes of
the various cells. These sleeves provide the necessary passages for the
salt piping. Figure 17 is an elevation of the reactor cell and one of
the 3 heat exchanger cells. Figure 18 is an elevation and plan of the
drain tank cell.

The reactor is hung from a ledge by means of a large flange near
the top of the vessel. This is seen in the elevation section of the
building, Fig. 15. In the heat exchanger cells all units are mounted
from a superstructure.rising from the floor of the cell. This mounting
method is shown in Fig. 19. The drain tank sits on the floor of the
drain tank cell, the load being carried through a skirt and 8 lugs which
transmit the load through the seal membrane and insulation to the con-
crete bottom of the cell.

CELL HEATING AND COOLING

All 5 cells are heated by circulating the cell atmosphere (mostly
nitrogen) over electrical heaters. The circulation is accomplished by
3 large blowers, each of which discharges 32,500 cfm of gas at a tem-
perature of 1050°F into the reactor cell. The reactor cell has U4 gas

outlets, one to each heat exchanger cell and one into the drain tank

cell. Return ducts from each of these cells to the blower suction make
a closed circulation system which is part of the cell containment. Perti-
nent data for this cell heating system are shown in Table 6.

Heating the cells by forced circulation greatly reduces the number
of cell penetrations necessary when compared to heating by space heaters
in the cells. In addition to heating, it is desirable to cool the cells
at times. The data for cooling, using the same circulation system, are
shown in Teble 7. The circulation duct is divided into two sections, and
a simple butterfly type damper directs the air through either the heater
section or the cooling section. | |

The electric heaters and the reentrant tube cooling water units each
fit into thimbles which are welded into the top of the duct. In each
case (heating or cooling), heat transfer is by radiation. Neither the
heaters nor the water piping penetrate the ducting so that repairs can

be made without breaking the containment.

DRAIN TANK SYSTEM

One of the most important systems in the molten-salt reactor plant
is the fuel-salt drain tank with its cooling system and provisions for
gas holdup. (It is somewhat analogous to the emergency core cooling
system of a solid fuel reactor.) It provides automatic removal of the
afterheat in the event of a failure of the main circulation system.
Also during normel operation the volatile fission products and the
stripping gas are held up for about ‘6 hours in the drain tank. The
decay heat from ¥is operation is removed by the natural convection
cooling system. -

The drain tank consists of two separate tanks. The: primary tank
sits. inside a secondary tank, or. "crucible." The drain tank has a flat
top with thimbles located in a symmetrical pattern. Sixty units of 6
tubes each cover the top of the drain tank. Figure 20 is a plan view
showing the arrangement of these 'thimbles with ‘the cooling headers in
place. Figure 21 is an elevation of the drain tank. “In order to
stabilize these thimbles against seismic shock, they are interlocked
at the bottom in such a way as to allow differential axial movement
but no individual vibration. The 360 thimbles, therefore, act together

as a unit as far as vibration is concerned, and the natural frequency
of this structure is high enough to provide protection against earthquake
damage, | | |
A cooling module consists of a manifold ‘and 6 reentrant tubes for -

each of the 60 groups of thimbles which ‘penetrate the drain tank. Each
"of these cooling modules is connected by two Loin. pipes to a section of
pipe, in the water heat dump outside the building contaimment. These
cooling ‘modules contain Nek as the circulating heat transport fluid.

Each module ‘has an expansion tank and shut-off valve so ‘that each can
. act independently of the others. :
Three water tanks’ 25 ft x25 ft Xx 12 ft deep are located: outside ’
the reactor building. Water flows through these tanks in an open circuit.
The water is teken from the seme source as the turbine condenser cooling
water and, after going through the tanks, it is returned to the ‘stream.

Data on these water tanks are given in Teble 8, and the tank arrangement

is shown in Fig. 22. Two of the 3 tanks are sufficient to provide cool-
ing under maximum heat load conditions. Heat is transferred from the
drain tank to the NaK, and from the NaK to the water by radiation. Thus
the NaK has a double barrier between it and the contents of the drain
tank and also between it and the water in the cooling water tanks.

The crucible in which the drain tank is suspended is a double-walled
tank. It is also cooled by NaK, having its own independent lines to the
water tanks. The crucible cools the drain tank walls by radiative
transfer. oo

The drain tank connects with the primary system in three completely
different ways in order to perform the three distinctly different func-
tions for which it is used. The first of these functions is to provide
a receptacle into which the primary salt may be drained whenever it is
necessary for any reason to remove the salt from the primary system. A
6-in. line runs from the bottom of the reactor in a generally horizontal
direction into the drain tank pit. At this point a drain valve is
installed and a vertical line connects the drain valve to the drain
tank.

The drain valve is a critical part of the system since it operates
but infrequently and yet mst operate when required. To provide some
redundancy, the drain valve is bypassed by a rupture disc valve which
can be used in an emergency if the: drain valve fails to open. Both
the drain valve and the rupture aise valve are replaceable by remote
maintenance methods after the primary system is drained. The drain
valve is a combination ‘mechanical valve - freeze valve. As shown in
Fig. 23, the poppet does not seal mechanically but relies on a frozen
salt film to seal. This seal is frozen by circulation of a coolant

in the body of the poppet. It is thawed by circulation of hot fluid.

The poppet is actuated by a positive electric drive end the movement
is sealed by & bellows vhich cannot be contacted wy salt but only by =
the cover gas.

The second use for: the drain tank is one which is extremely
unlikely but nevertheless must be provided for safety considerations.
If there is any leak of primary salt from the primary system, the salt

must be put into the drain tank. Therefore, the reactor cell, heat

exchanger cells, and the salt piping above the drain tank cell are equip-
ped with catch pans which communicate with the drain tank through a rupture
disc in the top of the tank.

The third use of the drain tank ¢oncerns the holdup of the fission
gages and the separation of entrained liquid from these gases. About 8 MW
of heat from these fission products must be disposed of and the drain tank
cooling system is used to dissipate this heat. This is a continuous func-
tion of the drain tank while the plant is in operation.

As has been mentioned, the primary salt is sparged with helium to
remove xenon from the salt. This sparging is accomplished by introducing
gas bubbles into a salt bypass loop around each pump of the primary cir-
cuit. In this bypass a centrifugal separator extracts the gas from the
salt. The separator constantly extracts about 10 gpm of salt along with
the gas. This two-phase stream from each pump is sent to the drain tank
where, because of the size of ‘the drain tank, the salt separates from
the gas by gravity, and, after an average residence time of about 6
hours, the gas passes through a particle trap. About half the gas is
returned directly to the bubble generator and the other half passes
through a cleanup system and is returned to the pump purge system by
means of a gas compressor.

The flow of liquid to the drain tank may vary over a range from 0 to
about 32 gpm. A means must be provided for returning this salt to the
primary system without returning any of ‘the radioactive gas. A system
of jet pumps with automatic flow control is used to accomplish this.

This jet pump system is installed as a unit in the center of the drain
tank and can be removed for replacement or repair should any of the
unit become defective. This unit is shown in plan and elevation in Fig.
2. A 19-ft-long by 6-in.-diam pipe, closed at the bottom end and open
at the top, acts as a sump in the center of the drain tank. On the out-
side of this sump there are two jet pumps which are driven by a common
salt source taken from the output of the three primary pumps. A line
from the discharge of each primary pump, after passing through a ball

check valve, is manifolded into one common line which feeds these two

jet pumps.

One of the jet pumps has its suction in a small sump in the bottom
of the drain tenk and discharges tangentially into the 6-in.-diam sump
near the top. This pump has a capacity greater than the flow of liquid
into the tank so it keeps the drain tank sump -empty. Because the capacity
of the pump exceeds the liquid flow, this pump at times pumps gas, but
the gas simply discharges back into the drain tank atmosphere.
| The second jet pump is located about midway up the 6-in.~diam sump
and sucks out of the bottom of this pipe. The discharge of this pump
goes into one of the pump bowls of the primary system. The jet pump
suction can change from about plus 1L ft to a minus 5 ft. ‘Therefore,
the pump discharges salt at a rate proportional to the suction head and
this rate can be anything between O and 32 gpm. Thus only liquid and
never hot gas is returned to the primary system. This automatic regu-
lation takes care of the liquid pumpback for all conditions -of ‘operation.

A third jet pump is mounted with this assembly, but it is used only
for filling the primary system or for transferring the contents of ‘the
drain tank to the chemical processing cell. This operation is described
below, along with the chemical processing system.
| Because this plant is operated as a converter having a breeding
ratio less than unity, the chemical processing required is very much
less involved than that required for a breeder. Three things are re-
quired of the chemical treatment: First, means must be provided for
removing oxygen from the primary or secondary salt in case either becomes
contaminated. Second, when the fuel salt has accumulated enough fission
products to cut significantly into the neutron economy, this salt must
be replaced with uncontaminated carrier salt. The uranium must be
extracted for return to the reactor before the old salt is discarded..
Third, there must be provision for storing the discarded carrier salt,
at least as long as cooling of this salt is required. In addition to
these three primary functions there is a further requirement for a
storage facility where primary salt may be placed if it is necessary to
do maintenance of any kind on the drain tank. Since this storage tank
is required in any event, it was decided to use it as the chemical pro-

cessing tank for fluorination of the primary salt to remove uranium.

The cooling system for the storage tank can be quite simple since
the salt can be held in the drain tank until the heat rate is of the
order of 1 MW. This situation exists after approximately 30 days of
cooling. The 1 MW can be successfully transferred from the surface of

the storage tank by radiation to the NaK-cooled jacket surrounding the

storage tank.

After removal of the uranium, the contaminated carrier salt must be
put into disposable cans. These cans, about: 2 ft in diameter by 10 ft
long, are placed in tanks located in an annulus around the top part of
the storage tank. Figures 25 and 26 are plan and elevation of the stor-
age tank and the disposable cans. These cans have interconnecting l-in.
lines so that salt can be transferred to them from the storage tank by
gas pressure. After cooling, the lines can be cut-and welded, sealing
the spent salt permanently in the disposable cans. After the cans have
been sealed they can be stored under the reactor in the storage vault or
transported to salt mines or other permanent storage facility. New cans
can be installed by direct maintenance once the full cans have been re-

moved from the location.

OFF-GAS SYSTEM

Helium is used as a cover gas over ‘the primary and secondary salt.

It: is also used as a purge, flowing inward around the pump seals, and
as a sparge for removing xenon from the primary salt. This gas system
is a closed system; and storage and cleanup equipment mist be provided.

~~ The bubble injection and separation and the holdup of the gas in
the drain tank have already been described. . When the gas. leaves the
drain tank it goes to one of two particle traps. - These traps can be
isolated by valves for removal from the system for repair. The purpose
of these particle traps is to catch the solid daughters and granddaughters
of the noble gases and also such noble metal particles as are carried by
the gas as it leaves the drain tank. These particle traps have adequate
size to accumulate solid particles for about three months before excess-
ive pressure drop would require replacement of the trap. To remove the
heat generated by. these particles, the traps have NaK cooling. The heat
load is of the order of 400 kW. These particle traps have not been

designed since the exact calculations on which a design is based have
not been made. Past experience with MSRE shows that the design is not
complex and the configuration does not present a problem.

The gas line downstream of the particle trap divides into two equal
branches. About 1 cfm of the gas goes directly to the bubble generators
in each of the three pump bypass lines. When this gas is removed by the
bubble separators, it recirculates to the drain tank, through the particle
trap, and to the bubble generators again. This gas is very radioactive,
the only loss in radioactivity being that which has decayed in the
approximately 6-1/2 hr transit time for the loop.

The other gas stream from the particle trap enters one of two char-
coal absorber beds. The two beds are valved so that either can be used.
It is imperative that the krypton and xenon in this part of the gas be
held up for 90 days because it must be essentially clean before it goes
to the gas compressor and storage tank for recirculation to the pump
seals. The head end section of the holdup bed is cooled by NaK while
the downstream sections of ‘the bed can be cooled by natural convection
of the gas atmosphere in the off-gas cell. These beds are in the form
of calendria with the charcoal surrounding the tubes. The actual design
of the charcoal beds, as in the case of the particle trap, has not been
done. Again, there has been enough experience with such absorber beds
at ORNL to show that they are feasible and are not excessively large.

For details concerning gas cleanup systems, reference is made to ORNL=~

4541 (ref. 6).

CONTROL RODS

There are 6 control rod penetrations in the reactor core. These
are T-in.-diam holes in graphite blocks in which cruciform control rods
are suspended. There is a 1/4-in. radial clearance around the rod, and
it is free to rotate in the hole. Salt flows up around the control rod
at a velocity of about 7.5 fps and keeps it cool. A control rod is made
of up to 1/2 in. of B,C clad with a 1/8-in. thickness of Hastelloy N.
Each control rod is worth about 3% AK/K and any one rod will shut the

reactor down.
«Q

-h

 

61

Each rod is suspended on a Hastelloy cable which is taken up on a
12-in.-diam drum driven through a worm gear drive. The motor is outside
the reactor cell shielding, but the winch and cable are located within
the containment. The motor and drive is also enclosed and a positive
gas pressure is maintained to produce inleeskage around the drive seal.

A spring loaded monitor cable attached to a synchro provides position
indication for the rod. One end of the cable is attached to the top
of the rod and by actuation of the synchro gives remote indication of
the rod position at all times. This cable is not strong enough to sup-
port the rod; therefore, it cannot prevent the rod from falling into
place.

The control rod has a finite life and so must be replaced after it
has received a fluence of about 10°! neutrons/cm®. The redundancy fur-
nished by the 6 rods makes it possible to hang the rods on cable without
providing a positive drive for rod insertion. A magnetic clutch can be
provided between the winch and the gear drive if it is desirable to
drop the rod instead of relying on the slower insertion provided by the

drive mechanism.

INSTRUMENTATION

Instrumentation for the plant has received little attention since
it probebly poses few problems that are different from other nuclear
plants. One exception is that: the reactor is so heavily reflected that
for initial startup a fission chamber will probably have to be inserted

in. one of the control rod sockets in order to get a good enough signal

in the initial criticality run. - The nuclear instrumentation should not
be more complicated than for other nuclear plants for the reactor has a
prompt negative temperature coefficient, and the very large heat capacity
of the primary system prevents rapid temperature excursions. A thorough
study of the control and safety instrumentation must be done. It appears
that the instrumentation required will not exceed the existing art.

MAINTENANCE

A circulating-fuel nuclear reactor is inherently a highly radio- =
active system, and the radioactivity is more dispersed than it is under
normal conditions in a 'solid-fuel reactor. For this reason, all main- .
tenance on the primary circuit must be done by remote means. By design-
ing the MSDR to operate at a low enough power density so that graphite
replacement is unnecessary, the maintenance is greatly simplified.
Also by designing the heat exchangers so that tubes can be plugged, the
maintenance is made more practical. Co SE

Experience with the MSRE showed that remote maintenance of the
radioactive equipment and systems of a small molten-salt reactor is
feasible and practical. The techniques and types of tools successfully
employed there ‘should be satisfactory for many of the remote maintenance
operations on the MSDR, but they will have to be adapted for handling
the larger and heavier equipment and piping. New tools will have to
be developed for such operations as remote cutting and welding of piping
and plugging of heat exchanger tubes. Experience with the development
of automatic cutting and welding equipment at ORNL indicates that these

more difficult operations can be accomplished.

PERFORMANCE

A summary of the nuclear data with fuel cycle costs is shown in
Table 9. No credit was taken for reclaiming the discarded carrier salt
after it is removed from the reactor. This salt has some very valuable
constituents in the 7Li and beryllium and when molten-salt reactors come
into general use it is probable that this salt could be reclaimed at
an ‘economic benefit. oy Co Coo

It is also almost certain that future reactor plants could utilize
supercritical steam systems and realize the improved efficiencies of
these systems. As has been stated, this "first-of-a-kind" demonstration
plant was designed on a conservative basis.

The question of plant safety has not been treated here. Certainly

safety considerations were of prime concern in the design study described

in this report, but the subject is so important as to merit separate
