ABSTRACT

Heat-transfer coefficients were determined experimentally for
a proposed MSBR fuel salt (LiF-BeFy-ThF,-UF,;67.5-20.0-12.0-0.5
mole %) flowing by forced convection through a 0.18-in.-ID hori-
zontal, circular tube for the following range of variables:

Reynolds modulus Loo — 30,600
Prandtl modulus bh — 14

Average fluid temperature (°F) 1050 — 1550

Heat flux (Btu/hr.ft?) 22,000 — 560,000

Within these ranges, the heat-transfer coefficient was found
to vary from 320 up to 6900 Btu/hr-ft°.°F (Nusselt modulus of 6.5
to 138). Correlations of the experimental data resulted in the
equations:

INTRODUCTION

The design of molten salt reactors requires detailed information

about the transport properties of the proposed fuel, coolant and blanket
mixtures. Although the molten salts generally behave as normal fluids

with respect to heat transfer, *? the possibility of unexpected effects,
 

 

such as nonwetting of metallic surfaces or the formation of low-conductance
surface films, indicates that heat-transfer measurements for specific re-
actor salts are needed.® This report describes heat-transfer experiments
with a proposed reactor fuel of mixed fluoride salts (LiF-BeFpThF,-UF,;
67.5-20.0-12.0-0.5 mole %). The technique employs forced convection of
the liquid salts through a smooth thin-walled Hastelloy N tube. Resist-
ance heating supplies the tube with a uniform heat flux. This method is
particularly well suited to the molten salt system because the electrical
resistance of the molten salt is very large compared with that of the
metal tube. Furthermore, the resistance of Hastelloy N remains nearly
constant over the entire temperature range of the measurements, which
simplifies the achievement of an axially uniform heat flux. In addition,
a constant heat capacity of the molten salt in the observed temperature
range makes possible several convenient assumptions in the calculation of

local fluid bulk temperatures.

DESCRIPTION OF THE APPARATUS

The apparatus for studying heat transfer with the molten salt system
is shown schematically in Fig. 1 and in the photograph, Fig. 2. - Molten
salt flows by means of gas pressure through a small diameter, electrically
heated test section. The flow of molten salt alternates in direction as
pressure from an inert gas supply is added to either of two storage ves-
sels located at each end of the test channel. Each 6-gal salt reservoir
is suspended from a weigh cell whose recorded signal indicates the flow
rate. The flow of salt reverses automatically by the action of solenoid
valves that control the flow of inert gas to the reservoirs. The rate of
flow of the salt my be varied from 0.25 to 1.7 gal/min, emptying a
reservoir in from 3 to 20 minutes.

The weigh cell circuit shown in Fig. 3 illustrates the electrical
and mechanical systems that control the flow of gas and thereby the flow
of molten salt. A second suspension system maintains tension on the test
section, to prevent it from sagging, by means of counter weights connected
by flexible cables. The test section consists of a smooth Hastelloy N
tube, 24.5 in. long, 0.25-in. outside diameter, and 0.035-in.-wall

thickness and is resistance heated with a 60 Hz ac power supply. A

detail of the mixing chambers located at each end of the test section is
shown in Fig. A-1, Appendix A. The electrodes connecting the test section
with the power circuit serve also as end plates of the disk-and-donut
mixing chambers. The power circuit to the test section is shown in Fig. 4.
The electrical power to the test section is supplied by a 4ho/25 v, 25 kva

transformer and is measured with a General Electric watt transducer, also

‘shown in Fig. 4. The test section is insulated with a 3-in.-thick layer

of vermiculite powder contained in a sheet metal tray. The salt reservoirs
and connecting tubes are heated by auxiliary clamshell and Calrod heaters
placed in positions indicated in Fig. 1. A typical heater circuit for an
auxiliary heater is depicted in Fig. 5.

The inlet and outlet salt temperatures are measured by four, 4O-mil-
diam, Chromel-Alumel sheathed thermocouples inserted into two wells in
each mixing chamber (Fig. A-1). The temperature distribution along the
test section is measured by a series of 24 Chromel-Alumel thermocouples
(0.005-in.~diam wire) spot welded at 1-in. intervals to the outside tube
wall. The scheme for attaching these thermocouples is shown in Fig. A-2.

Details of a salt reservoir can be seen in Fig. A-3. The interior
of these tanks as well as the test section and the mixing chambers are
stress relieved and hydrogen fired before they are assembled.

A data acquisition system provides for the automatic monitoring of
the temperatures; record is made by a paper printout and a paper tape
punch. In this system a multichannel Vidar data recorder reads emf
signals from each thermocouple, from the weigh cells, and from the power
circuit in a sequential switching arrangement known as a "crossbar
scanner." The manufacturer claims an accuracy of better than +0.5°F
for the Vidar system. The data recording equipment is shown schematically
in Fig. 6 and in a photograph in Fig. 7.

The weigh cell and wattmeter celibration curves and a list of per-
tinent experimental equipment may be found in Appendix A as Fig. A-L,
Fig. A-5, and Table A-1, respectively.

OPERATING PROCEDURES

-

: In preparation for the addition of the molten salt mixtures, the

system including the test section is heated to the desired temperature

4

level above the melting point of the salt mixture. Approximately 165 1b
of the molten salt is then introduced into one of the reservoirs by the
force of argon gas pressure. Salt is forced back and forth through the
test section as the operation of the apparatus is tested — for leaks,
blockages, thermocouple and data recording functioning, etc. After the
initial checkout procedure, the system is put on a standby mode by vent-
ing the gas pressure to the atmosphere and allowing the salt to siphon to
equal levels in both reservoirs. The standby mode is used to protect the
test-section thermocouples by minimizing the heating of the test section.
Before each run, temperatures in the test section are raised to about
1000°F over a period of 45 minutes and the salt flow is reestablished. A

fixed flow rate is established and power to the test-section heater is in-

 

creased to the desired heat flux. When the temperatures indicate steady-

x state conditions, all parameters — power input, flow rate, and tempera-

«

tures — are continuously recorded. The flow of salt is reversed when one
"reservoir is nearly empty, and the heat flux is momentarily reduced to
about half the operating value to prevent a temperature excursion in the
test section at the time of zero flow. The upper range of flow rates is
limited by the time required to empty one of the reservoirs. Whenever
the temperature exceeds the desired level, the system is allowed to cool
by reducing the power to the test section and other appropriate heaters.
Periodic calibrations of radial heat losses were made by measuring
the power required to maintain an empty test section in an isothermal
condition as a function of temperature level. The information furnished
by this calibration is used in each run, when an isothermal check of the

test-section thermocouples is obtained at the desired temperature level

 

 

”»

*
This procedure resulted in several salt leaks when a number of power

L failures occurred during the standby condition. Melting of the confined
| salt was invariably accompanied by rupture of the thin-walled tubing due
z to the expansion of the salt upon partial melting. A better standby pro-
\G/ cedure would be to drain the salt into one reservoir, allowing unrestrained
expansion of the salt during melting if an unexpected freeze should occur.

with the hot salt flowing and only enough heat added to the test section
to equal the radial heat loss. In Fig. 8, typical test-section thermo-
couple readings from an isothermal run show a scatter band of +4 °F about
the average outside wall temperature. The sheathed thermocouples in the
‘mixing chambers read slightly higher during isothermal runs and are be-
lieved to be more accurate. Their readings, therefore, provide the basis
for standardization and the tube wall readings are corrected to this
standard.

Extensive tests were conducted to insure the reliability of the
apparatus and experimental procedures. The first test-section tube pro-
duced erratic axial temperature patterns which did not improve with more
thermal insulation of the test section. Subsequently, the anomalous axial
temperature profiles were traced to the test section, in which a hole had
burned through the wall and had been repaired by welding. Excessive weld
material protruding into the tube was thought to have disturbed the tem-
perature and velocity profiles. Replacement of the test section eliminated
the difficulty.

Other possible sources of error were investigated during the search
for the cause of the temperature irregularities. Electrical conduction
through the molten salt would result in additional heating of the salt,
but the ratio of the resistivity of the salt to that of the test section
is greater than 2500, indicating very little heat generated in the salt in
this manner. Additional calculations of the radial temperature distri-
bution confirmed that not more than 0.2% of the power was expended by
electrical conduction in the salt.

Temperature variations due to free convection are believed to be
larger than those attributable to internal heating; but according to the
criterion of Shannon and DePew,® free convection in the horizontal test-
section position is insignificant compared with forced convection in the
range of Reynolds numbers described in this work.

As an additional check of natural-convection effects, the reactor
fuel salt experiments were repeated with the test section anchored in a

vertical position while other equipment arrangements and operational pro-
cedures remained unchanged. The object of the change was to compare the

effects of free convection in the vertical and horizontal positions. A

crack developed in one of the piping connections to the test section

“after 8 runs and repairs were not attempted. However, the results of

the vertical runs did not show any difference in the effect of free con-
vection as related to the orientation of the test section. The data are
presented later in the report and in Appendix B.

The possibility of heat conduction losses to the electrodes at the
ends of the test section prompted calculations to be made based on the
conservative assumptions of maximum heat flux and a minimum Reynolds |
number. The results of these calculations show that the net heat con-
duction in the axial direction is less than 0.1% of the total heat gen-
erated in the test section at a distance of 0.25 in. from the entrance.

The electrical resistivity of the Hastelloy N test-section tube
varies less than 1% in the temperature range of. 1000 to 1500°F and the
heat capacity of the salt varies less than 5% over the same temperature
range. The variation of the radial heat loss along length of tube is
less than 10% and the heat loss itself is less than 5%. A constant axial
voltage drop measured along the test section verified the uniformity of

the heat flux generated in the test-section wall and provided a check of

the wall thickness and tube radius variation as a function of its length.

Experiments conducted with a well-known heat-transfer salt (HTS)™
provided a final test in the new test section of the experimental pro-
cedure. EFarlier experiments® showed that HTS data are well correlated
by standard heat-transfer equations. The experiments with HTS in the
present system demonstrated that the outside wall temperatures remained
parallel to the mean salt temperature over half of the test-section length,
indicating fully developed flow and a constant heat-transfer coefficient.

In 11 runs with HIS, the experimentally determined values of the heat-
transfer coefficient were compared with those predicted by standard cor-
relations. Ten of the values of the heat-transfer coefficient were
within 13% of that predicted by the Sieder-Tate correlatior® and the other

value was within 25%. Before the system was charged with reactor salts,

the HTS was removed by extensively flushing with water and drying in

heated vacuum for 10 days.

The local coefficient of forced-convective heat transfer is defined
by the equation

where
h = coefficient of heat transfer, Btu/hr-£t? «°F; h,, at position x

A = heat-transfer (inner) surface area, ft°;
t = temperature, °F; tp, fluid mixed mean at any position; ts,

inner surface of the tube at any position x; t;;, outer surface
of the tube at any position x.

Beyond the thermal and hydrodynamic entrance regions, h, reaches an asymp-
totic value. For a constant heat flux, (a/A),, this limiting value will

occur when (tg - t) reaches a constant value.

this is the solution to the one-dimensional steady-state heat conduction
equation with a source term and a heat loss, qr at the outside wall.’
The only variable on the right-hand side of Eq. (2) is the thermal con-
ductivity of the metal wall, k , which remains nearly constant over small
temperature rises along the tube. Thus, when the temperature profiles
t, and th are parallel, the fluid flow in the tube is essentially fully
developed.

For most of the measurements, the heat gained by the fluid in

traversing the test section was calculated by the equation

in which
Co = specific heat of fluid at constant pressure, Btu/lb-°F,

For the later measurements (Runs 210 through 220), the heat gained by the
fluid was determined from the electrical heat generation in the test
section corrected for the calibrated heat loss. By calculating the heat
input in this manner, the influence of the uncertainties in measuring the
fluid mixed-mean inlet and outlet temperatures can be reduced.

The computer program used for reducing the experimental data is given

in Appendix C.

RESULTS

Heat-transfer coefficients were determined experimentally in 70 runs
covering the laminar, transition, and turbulent flow regimes. Ten runs
with HTS to test the equipment are included with data shown in Appendix B.
The physical properties and chemical analyses of the molten salt are listed
in Appendix D, Tables D-1 and D-2, respectively.

The duration of a run usually permitted time for three thermocouple
scans to demonstrate thermal steady state. Figure 9 shows typical outside
wall temperatures and mean fluid temperatures. A straight line is drawn
between the mean inlet and mean outlet fluid temperatures by assuming con-
stant physical properties of the molten salt and uniform heat transfer
over the immer surface of the test-section wall. These assumptions are
supported by the constant heat capacity of the molten salt in the observed
temperature range and the constant resistance of the Hastelloy N test

section mentioned earlier.

Three regions of N.. are shown in Fig. 9 — the laminar, transition,
and turbulent at Nee = 597, 4277, and 28,104, respectively. The co-
efficient of heat transfer h assumes its limiting value rapidly for
turbulent flow; but in laminar and transition flows, a significant
entrance region is evident. This entrance region is seen more clearly
when h is plotted versus the distance along the test section x as in
Fig. 10 for the transition flow run. After the thermal and hydrodynamic
boundary layers become fully developed, h decreases to a limiting value.
The test section is not long enough for h, to reach the limiting value
in laminar flow. Therefore, integrated values of h over the entire tube
length, coupled with the parameter D/L, are used in developing the lam-
inar flow correlations; whereas, the limiting constant h values are used
for the transition and turbulent heat-transfer correlations.

Standard heat-transfer correlations for the three flow regimes are
given in the following discussion of Egs. (4) through (8). Heat-transfer
data from the 70 runs are then presented in the dimensionless forms of
standard correlations for comparison using the data listed in Appendix B
and the physical properties in Table D-1.

1. For laminar, forced flow in the absence of natural convection,

the equations of Sieder and Tate® and Martinelli and Boelter® are,

respectively:

Ny, = 1.86 [No No (D/L)IY 2 (u/ng)°** (4)
and

Ny, = 1.62 [NN (p/n) 2 (5)

2. For transition region flow beyond the entrance region, a modified

form of Hausen equation® is:

Ny, = 0.116 (Ne —- 125) NG, (w/w) . (6)

Equations (4), (6), and (8) are compared with the experimental data
in Fig. 11. The experimental results are in good agreement in the laminar
region but are slightly below the equations representing the transition
and turbulent regions. For example, in the range 3500 < Nee < 30,000, the
data lie about 13% below Egs. (6) and (8). The heat-transfer data could
not be correlated in the transition range 2000 < Nee < 4000 because of
entrance effects that persisted over the length of the test section. The
leminar data do not fit Eq. (5) as well as Eq. (4), as shown by comparing
Figs. 12 and 11. Similarly, Eq. (7) provides no significant improvement
in the correlation of the data for Np > 10,000 over that of Eq. (8)
[compare Figs. 13 and 11].

The data plotted in Figs. 11 through 13 suggest that the experimental
data for laminar and turbulent flow can be fitted to functions of the
form:

n
Ordirate = K No_ , (9)

where K and n are dimensionless constants having different values for
laminar and turbulent flows and the "ordinate" is the ordinate used in
Fig. 11. Least-squares fits of the data to the form of Eq. (9) were
carried out assuming a constant value (1/3) for the Prandtl modulus
exponent. These fits were tried with and without a viscosity ratio cor-
rection term. We found that when the viscosity ratio correction term
was included, the values for the Reynolds modulus exponent, n, came
closer to the commonly accepted values of 1/3 for laminar flow and 0.8
for turbulent flow. The resulting equations fitting the experimental

data are

Ny, = 1.89 Np, Tp (D/L)P22 (fn), (10)

with an average absolute deviation of 6.6% for Ny. < 1000; and

Ny, = 0.0234 Ne N° (n/m, (11)

with an average absolute deviation of 6.2% for Nee > 12,000.

Because the data in the transition region did not follow the form
of Eq. (9), the equation for the experimental data in this range of Np
was obtained by adjusting the coefficient in Eq. (6), giving the following
relation:

/ Yo.
N. = 0.107 (0 = 135) Np. (w/w),

with an average absolute deviation of 4.1% for 3500 < Noe < 12,000.

The heat-transfer measurements made with the test section oriented in
a vertical position to test for the possible effects of free convection
are in good agreement with the standard correlations, except for four
higher points (see Figs. 11 and 13). These higher points were obtained
with downflow in contradiction to the predicted enhancement of heat trans-
fer with upflow. Thus, a systematic thermocouple error in one of the
mixing chambers is the most probable cause of the higher results with
downflow.

DISCUSSION

The results indicate that the proposed reactor fuel salt behaves as
a normal fluid in the range 0.5 < No, < 100 with regard to heat transfer.
It should be noted that uncertainties in the physical properties of the
salts reflect as great an effect on the correlations as does the un-
certainty in the heat-transfer coefficient.

Our data lie below the standard correlations in the turbulent and
transition regions but not in the laminar region. If the deviations in
our data were caused by low-conductance surface films or entrained gas,
one would expect the effect to be apparent in all three regions. An un-

certainty in the viscosity of the salt might explain the discrepancies in

the turbulent and the transition regions since the heat-transfer function
in the laminar region is almost independent of the viscosity. In addition,
the lower values in the transition regime could be the result of the failure
of the thermal boundary layer to fully develop over the length of the test
section.

The problem of boundary-layer development is most pronounced in the
range of Reynolds number 2000 < Noo < 4000, where entrance effects
persisted for the entire length of the test section. The same effect
could be produced up to Nee = 5000 at higher wall heat fluxes. Figure 14
illustrates the apparent effect of heat flux on the entrance region length.
At No = 3762 and a wall heat flux of 2.55 X 10° Btu/hr.ft?, there is no
region of constant heat-transfer coefficient. In contrast, temperature
profiles at a similar Reynolds number, Neo = 3565 and the lower wall heat
flux of O0.7h x 10° Btu/hr. ft? show a constant heat-transfer coefficient
over most of the test-section length. Since the viscosity of the fluid
decreases with increasing temperature, heat transfer from the tube wall
may be exerting a stabilizing effect on the laminar boundary layer,®+2°
thus delaying transition.

Future experiments with the fuel salt should include system modi-

fications so that the entrance region effects in transition flow can be

better evaluated. Possible modifications would be the insertion of an
unheated calming section prior to heat addition to permit establishment
of the hydrodynamic boundary layer before changing the temperature pro-
file. This would separate the two effects that now occur simultaneously.
Another possibility would be to increase the length of the test section
while maintaining a constant heat flux along the length. A sufficiently
long tube might allow fully developed fiow patterns to be reached before

the test-section exit.

CONCLUSIONS

We have found molten fluoride salt mixtures to behave, for the most
part, as normal fluids with respect to forced-convection heating in a
smooth tube. Although the present results average ~13% below the standard
literature heat-transfer correlations, one must realize that some un-
certainties exist in the physical properties of the salt and that the
standard correlations themselves are based on heat-transfer data using
fluids such as air, steam, water, petroleum, etc., which exhibit a 20%
scatter band around the standard curves.

No evidence of the existence or influence of low-conductance surface
films, such as corrosion products, gases, or oxides, was found in the
present studies. In the Reynolds modulus range from 2000 to 5000, we did
find the heat-transfer coefficient to vary along the length of the tube
in a manner which appeared related to a delay in the transition to tur-
bulent flow. We believe this delay in transition is abetted by the
stabilizing influence of heating a fluid whose viscosity has a large
negative temperature coefficient. We intend to make further studies of

this phenomenon.
