NEUTROR~INDUCED TRANSMUTATION OF HIGH-LEVEL RADIOACTIVE WASTE

H. C. Claiborne

ABSTRACT

The possibility of reducing the potential hazard of high
level radioactive waste by neutron-induced transmutation has
received little study. In this report the svailable information
on fission product transmutation is reviewed and discussed, the
contribution of individual actinides to the potential hazard of
the waste is calculated, and expected hazard reduction factors
that would result from recycle through a PWR are calculated for
the actinide waste from chemical processing of spent fuel.

It is not practical to burn fission product wastes in power
reactors because the neutron fluxes sre too low, Developing
special burner reactors with the required neutrcn flux of the
order of 1037 n/cm@-sec or burning in the blankets of thermo-
nuclear reactors is beyond the limits of current technology.

It seems that ultimate storage in deep geclogical formations,
such as bedded salt, remains the best method for fission product
dispossl.

When plutonium and uranium extraction efficiencies exceed
99%, a significant reduction in the long-term hazard potential
of the waste can be obtained by similar removal of naptunium,
smericium, and curium (the other actinides being very small
contributors). Consequently, it seems reasonable to concentrate
on developing economical chemicel processes to extrect these
three actinides for seperate storage or for recycling through
the reactors that produce them.

The results of cuch recyeiing calculations show that the
long-term hazard potential. of the waste from light water reactors
may be reduced by factors up to 200 if no more then 0.1% of the
actinides are discarded to the waste in eacln pass through the
reprocessing plant. Larger reductions of the hazard potential
of the waste will become practical if methods are developed to
rroduce sharper separations between tne actinides and fission
products as the spent fuel is processed.

 
1. INTRODUCTION

The management of high-level, long-lived radicactive wastes associ-~
ated with a highly developed nuclear power economy based on fission
reactors will present a formidable problem to present and future gener-
ations, Schemes for management of these wastes that have been under
serious consideration involve conversion of the aqueous wastes to solid
forms with subsequent storsge in man-made vaults or in deep geological

formations such as bedded salt.

The possibility of ultimate disposal into deep space or the sun
(the only method for complete and permanent removal from the earth) has
begun to receive more consideration because of the recent and projected
advances in space technology. The only other known method of ultimate
disposal (in contrast to permanent storage) is to transmute or burn out
(fission in the case of some of the actinides) long-lived radioactive
nuclides to stabie or short-lived nuclides by exposure to & neutron
flux.

Studies have heen made s? on the possibility of using special high-

flux "burner reactors” to reduce the stockpile of the "problem fission

products Sr, and The excess neutrons from controlled thermo-

3,k

nuclear reactors have also been suggested for use in transmutation of

these fission products and the waste actinides,

Aside from the problems associated with burning fission preducts
(which dre discussed later in this report), Pg, and L3¢s decay to com-
pletely insocuous levels in less than 1000 years, a time for which con-
tainment in appropriate geclogicel formstions can be provided with good
assurance. The nuclides 85g; and 3g with shorter half-lives are even
more suitable for long-term storage in geological formations. The
isotope 1297 (half-life, 16 million years) is one of the exceptional
fission products that has an extremely long life but is produced in
sueh lew c-oncsatrations thet its hazard may possibly be reduced tc
uppropriastely low levels by isotopic dilution (i.e., by mixing with

stable isotopes of the same chemical element).
In contrast, many of the actinides that are produced by transmutation
of uranium and thorium in reactors have half-lives in the thousands of
years, occur in large quantities, and are not suitable for isctopiec dilu-
tion because stable forms of these elements do not exist. Consequently,
an even stronger motive exists for completely destroying or restricting
the accumulation of these slpha-emitters since predictions of the tectonics
of geological formations for 10° to 10° years have a lower confidence
level compared to those for the order of 1000 years. In present concepts
of power reactors, it is planned that only 99.5 to 99.9% of the uranium,
plutonium, and thorium will be recycled. Consequently, it is customarily
assumed that all other heavy elements (Cf, Bi, Cm, Am, Np, Pa, Ac, Re,
etc.) will be rejected as waste along with the 0.1 to 0.5% of the U, Pu,
and Th that goes to the waste in the present generation of spent fuel
reprocessing plants.

The bezard potential of this actinide waste can be reduced by recy-
cling the actinides through the power reactors prcducing them; eliminaticn
occurs by fission at points in the reaction path. The primary objective
of this work was to determine the extent of the reduction of the radio-
logical hazard of the waste streams from chemical processing plants and
the effect on the neutron economy of a pressurized water reactor (PWR)
caused by recycling of the actinides (except for the smell amounts lost
in the waste streams} back through the reactors producing them. In
addition, the individusl contribution of each actinide to the waste
hazard was determined as a funciion of decay time and compared with the
hazard from all the waste, which inciudesthe fission products, nuclides
produced from structural materials, actinides, and all decay products.

In the following sections the bases for calculations are given and
pertinent results are presented and discussed. A modified version of
ORIGEN,” an isotope generation and depletion code, and its associated

nuclear library was used in all the calculations,

2. SUMMARY

It is generally impractical to appreciably change the nadard potential
of fission product wastes by transmuting these wastes with neutrons in
nuclear reactors. Developing special burner reactors with the required
neutron flux of the order of 1007 n/ ene sec or burning in the blenkets cf
thermonuclear reactors is beyond the limits of current technology. It
appears thet ultimate storage in deep geological formations is the best
method for fission product disposal since less than 1000 years are re-

guired to reduce their radioactivity to an innocuous level, a, time span

|
for which tectonic stability can be essentially assured in formations

such as bedded salt.

In contrast tc the fission products, many of the actinides in the
waste from spent-fuel processing have half-lives of thousands| of years
and are not suitable for isotopic dilution. Consequently, a iTonger
motive exists to find an alternative method of restricting the acewmi-
lation of these alpha emitters since the tectonics of geological forma-
tions cannot be predicted with as high a confidence level for the longer

periods that are required for their decay to innocuous levels.

The determinetion of the extent of the reduction of the radiological
hazard of the waste streams from chemical processing plants and the effect
on the neutron economy of a PWR caused by recycling of the ectinides was

;

the primary objective of this study.

The relative importance of the contribution that the various com-
ponents make to the hazard messure (the total water required to dilute
each nuclide of a mixture to its RCE) of the waste from a PWR spent-fuel
processing plant is shown in Table 1. Beyond about 4 years, the acti-
nides ard their daughters dominete from & hazard viewpoint. When RCGs
are used that are less conservative’? than the recommended default
values of the Code of Federal Fegulations, the importance of the acti-

/

rides diminish scmewhat for decay times greater than 10° years.

The actinide waste hazard is controlled by the americium and curium

daughters begin to dominate. Iinother important point is that the
remaining actinides, namely, Ac, Th, 22, Bk, Cf, and Es, make a negli-
givle contribution tc the hazard of the waste. The import of these
results is that in any waste management system in which at least 99.5%
of the uranium and plutonium is extracted, a significant further reduc-
tion in the actinide waste hazard can be obtained by removal of most
of the smericium. curium, and neptunium from the waste. If 99.5%
removal of these three actinides is 21sec effected, the uranium and
plutonium become controlling end it would then be profitable (from a
waste hazard viewpoint) to increase the extraction efficiency of these

latter elements, particularly the plutonium.

The effect of recycling of 99.5% 2nd 92.9% of the actinides other
then U or Pu on the hazard measure is shown in Teble 2 in terms of a
hazard reducticn factor as a function of postirradiation decay time.
The hazard reduction factor used here is defined as the ratio of the
water required for dilution of the waste to the RCE for the standard
case (nc removal of the actinides other than Pu + U at the indicated
extraction efficiency) to that required to dilute the waste afier each

successive reactor irradiation cycle.

These resuits show that wren recycling is practiced, the hazard

.. measure of the waste is approximately proportionzl to the neptunium,
americium, and curium sent to the waste since the hazard reduction
factor is about five times greater when 0.1% of the actinides is sent
to the waste alter each cycle than that for tne 0.5% case. This obtains
logically because the reactor discharge composition is little affected
by a change of only 0.4% of recycled zctinides in the feed stream. In
addition the standard case is als» little affected by whether 0.1% or
0.5% of U + Pu is present since the smericium end curium predominate at
smaller decay times and neptunium after 10° years. It follows that if
99.99% remcval of 2ll actinides is effected, the hazard reduction
Factor for the actinide waste will increase by about a factor of

10 up to around 2000 at 1 years, The table also shows that

the hazard reduction factors decrease asymptotically with the

number of recycles, which is a result cf the buildup

Chemical processing assumed at 150 days alter reactor discharge: one
cycle represents 3 years of reactor operation,

6

of the higher transuranics, and that effective equilibrium is atteined

in 20 cycles mere or less, dspending cn the decay time.

When the RCGs vsed by 30110 ard those calcvliated by LaVerne? are
used in place of the recommended default valves for the unlisted nuclides
in the Code cf Federal Regulations, the hazard reduction factors become
£.5 and 10 Fpspectively. The corresponding values Tor 99 9% extraction
of the actinides ere 28 and 49. Although the R0Gs calculated bys TaVerne?
are more realistic than the more conservative recommended default values,
the Code of Federal Regulations must be followed in nuclear reactor

design and operation.

Recycling of the actinides and achicvirg a 92.9% extraction effi-
ciency reduce the hazard measure of the actinides at equilibrium to the
same order as that of the long-lived fission products (+291, ar, 93m,
Pre, and 13544) for the longer decay times, the hazard measure of the
actinides being about twice that of the long-lived fissicn preductis at
1000 years and dropping to aboul one-half of the fission product veius
at 10° years. However, if 129; is eliminated as a hazari by isctopic
dilution {or separate storage), the actinides would continue to control
the total waste hazard potential. An actinides extraction efficiency of
99.99%+% along with the recycling is recuired before the hazard measure
of the total waste hazard potential is controlled by the long-lived
fission products other than 1291, At some point, however, further

extraction of actinides from the waste will become senseless because

 

3.

then have a Long-term hazar

potential that is less than
that of naturally occurring formations of uranium ard thorium. (See,

\

for example, the arguments presented in ref. 6.)

The decrease in the average material neutron multiplication for a

typical PWR containing recycled actinides was only 0.8%. This lass of

   
 

y can be compensated by increasing the fissile enrichment of
the reactor by only about 2% {e.g., from 3.3 to 3.4% erriciment in =
typical PWR).

Recycling of reacter actinide waste will increase the radiation

oroblem associated with chemical procassing and fuel fabrication because
of the increased radioactivity of the reactor feed and discharge
streams. After a few recycles, 2220 builds ur to ve the greatest

source of neutrons and reaches 10t2 neutrons/sec per metric fon of

spent fuel at 150 deys after discharge. A reduction of 3 Factor of

300 is possible if the celifornium is removed. This can be sceompiished
by not recycling Cf even though thares is an increase in the Cf produce
tion with curium buildup. Significant °22CT buildup occurs from
successive neutron captures starting with 29s and 250¢e, whose

precursors are Hp and 250%.

Recycling of actinides through a resctor adds to the inventory
of hazardous materials but will probably have nc meesursbie effect on
the potential severity of design wasis accident:. The hazard measure
of the actinide waste based on ingestion was increased by only 12%
after 60 recycles. The total is sbout cme-tenth of that for the
fission products. If the hazard measure is based on inhalisticn,
recycling increases the potential hezard by 2 factor of 2 st {ise
charge with the everage in the reactor being significantly higher.
The actinides have an inhalation nazard measurs of & factor of 7
higher th:an the fission products at discharge. The above statements
assume that the reccncentration factors in the environment are spproxi~
mately the same for actinides and fission products. Present informstiom,
however, indicates thet certain fission products (e.z., Sr 2nd I) ore
reconcentrated to a greater extent in the environment. This hixx the
effect of causing the fission products to be the deminant source of
both ingestion and inhalation hazard during reactor operation. The
actinid= concentration in a resctor, however, is not significant in
analyzing the "maximum credible accident" (MCA) since the sctinide
compounds cannot be significantly dispersed into the atmosphere by
any credible resctor accident. Transmatation of fission products
in burner reactors would, of course, add tc the notentisl hezard
of the MCA because the velatile fission products are controlling in
an accident analysis.
Recycle of sctinides in the LIF3Rs should preduce even higher
nsierd reduction factors since the sverage fission. io-capture ratio
of the artinides should be higher in 2 Tast remclior than in a thermal
cre. The author har foumd it Aifficnlt to guantify this effect becsuse
of the current paucity of seutron cross-zeciion dats for the higher
wetinides in fest spectre. Fast cross-section data for the higher
actinides should be developed so that recycling siudies can be made

3. METHOD FOR DETERMINING THE HAZARD OF RADIOACTIVE WASTE

In comparing the potential hazerd from different mixtures of radio-
active materials, a stendard method is required for determining a specific
value for each mixture that is a reflection of its biological hazerd. The
specific ectivily alone is insufficient since biclogiesl factors are not
included.

The controlling consideration of hazerd from the viewpoint of long-
term storage or disposal of radioactive materials is the danger of their
dissolution or dispersal in underground water with subsequent ingestion
by human beings. Consequently, a good measure of the ingestion hazard
associated with a mixture of radionuclides of widely varying sctivities
is the quantity of walter required to dilute the radioactive mixture to a
concentration low encugh toc permit unrestricted use of the water: the
larger the amount of water requirad, the greaisr the potentisl hazard.
Ths hazard measure for the mixture is determined by summing the amount
of water recuired to dilute each individual nuelide to its Radiation
Concentration Guide velue {or RCS, which was formerly called MPC) for
winstrictesd use of water. This method, which <as used in & previous
work” on the hazards of long-term storage of radicactive wastes, was
selected for use in the study. The method has the virtue of simplicity
in moplication and relates to the maximum velve of the hazard since no
consideration is given to fractionation and paths of travel to hwman
beings. ‘he most rzeert discussion of cther methods of evaluating the
nhatard potential of radioactive weste is given by Gera and Jacobs JI
who alto promose 8 nev hazard measure tha? involves both the ingestion
hazard uiod in this study, the inhelation hazard, and the probability of
being taxen up dy humans. Determinstion of these probabilities is very
Sifficuit, however, since statistical data regarding the probability of
sezidents amd other radicactivity releases. Including their consequences
in 21} phases of redicactive waste management, are not readily available
or easily estimated,

The RUGz used in this study were taken from the Code of Federal

Rezulations RK which ir currently the guide for unrestricted use of
i2

water in which these ruclides mey be disscived. For nuclides with
unlisted RCGs, the recommended defeult values were used, nemely,

3 x 107° uCi/ml for beta-decay nuclides with half-lives greeter than

2 ar and 3 x 1070 Cifn> for miclides that decay by elphe emission or
spontaneous fission, These default velues represent a conservative
estimate of the RCGs., Some of the results in this xeport are alse
compared or the basis of the KCGs used by Bell and Bi1100® end those
recently calculated by LaVerne’ for unlisted nuclides. Bell and Dillon
used 6 x 1077 and 2 x 1076 Cifa’ for 2%%Re and 2291, respectively, and
unity for all other unlisted nuclides. LaVerne calculated RCGs for all
the unlisted nuclides and 5 x 1077 and & x 1077 Ci/m> for 2%7Rg snd
220m, respectively, the two nuclides thet contributed to most of the
differences that occurred due to the pariiculer RCGs that were used.
k, FUCLEAR CALCULATIONAL METHOD

The nuclear calculations dwring reactor irradiation and after
discharge were made with a modified version of the nuclide generation
and demleticn code SRIGEN. The calculation during irradiation is based
on three neutron energy groups, namely, thermal, a 1/E energy distribu-
tion in the resonance region, and a fast group. The cross sections in
the library had been predetermined from basic data dy weighting with a
typical PHR neutron energy spectrum. More details of the original code
and cross-section library, which included deta for actinides only up to

2k
Cri, are given in refs, 10 znd 11.

For calenlaticns involviag recycling of the actinides, it was
necessary to expsnd the library te include some higher transuranics and
increase Lhe caicnlaticnal scope of the ORIGEN code. Cross-section and
decay date for the following muciides were added to the DR actinide
Library: ako; htm 20g, 2b 2455, 25.0, 5g WE To
28, 9en, 2500, Eon 250g, | Gey 250¢c¢, ler, 25cys, 253s,
25h, 2535. Actinides higher then einsteinium were not expected to
heve a significant effect because they all decay (Q-deczy, along with a2
little spontaneous fission) with short nslf-lives, thus preventing buildup
of the muelidesn beyond 2532s. he calculations confirmed this expectation.
The decay mithod and neutron irterszstion probabilities are such that no
significant amounts of the actinides can be remcved from the reaction-
decay chain except by fission. Cross sections end decay constants for
the transuranic elements thzt vere added to the library were taken fron
ref. 12. :

;
A celelation of the material multiplication constant or k_ was
added to the code since it ws3 necessary to know the effect of actinide
recycle on the ‘reactivity. Although the k, calculation ignores core
i=akage and control rods or other control poisons, the results, which
would not be adequate for the core physics, seer adequate for relative
comparisons. Neutron yields per fission as a function of energy were
taken from the SNDF/B-II dete filel> for most of the fissile muclides.
For those not included iz that file, the neutron yields were taken or
inferred {rom the publications by Gordeeve and Swirenkin, Hopkins
1h

. 15 : _

and* Diver Re and Clarik.~® The effective neutron yield from fission of
each nuclide by resonance energy neutrons was cbiained by weighting the
energy dependent vieids with a 1/E neutron flux. For fast fissions,

the fission spectrum was used as the weighting function.

QJtker code chenges include a recycle option for any number of
actinides, an e2bility to specify removal of any number of actinides
afier an arbitrary decay time subseguent tc reactor discharge for
recycling or further decay of the remaining meteriels, and ar ability
to eccount for the fissions of all the fissionable materials.

5. REACTOR TYPE AND STANDARD CONDITIONS

The reactor selected for this study was the Diablo Canyon, which is
typical of a PWR design. When operating at equilibrium, the fuel is 3.3%
anriched wranium with a burnup of 33,000 MWd/metric ton of uranium. It
was assumed that this burpup was obtained by continuous operation at a
specific power of 30 MW/metric ton cver a three-year period. For the
usually assumed plant factor of 0.8, intermittent operation at a specific
power of 38 MW/metric ton for 80% of the time would produce the same
burnup. Since {for the time periods involved), the waste hazard measure
resulting from a particular burnup is not a sensitive funetion of any
reasonable operation schedule, it was deemed unnecessary to complicate
the calculetions and analysis by considering a particular operation
zchedule.

The fuel regicn is divided into threes zones with each one conteining
about an equal weight of fuel (approximately 28.3 metric tons of uranium).
The central zone is discharged yesriy and the remaining fuel shuffled

inward with the cuter zone being recharged with fresh fuel.

In the celculations it was necessary to ignore control rods and to
assume that the neutron flux wes unifcrm throughout a region, anda that
the regions were neutronically uncoupled. A calculation cycle comprised
three years of irradiation time between charge and discharge of a zone.
Tais procedure gives the correct values (within the accuracy of the
assumptions) for the discharge composition after the irradiation cycle.
The average composition, neutron flux, and k, for the entire reactor
loading *=T7 over one-year cycles because of the yeerly charge and
discharge znd are nct explicitly given in the output of the ORIGEN code.
However, these averege values cer be constructed easily from the ouiput
of a calculation cycle.

The "stendard” for compsring the effect of actinide recycie on the
actinide weste hazard measure was the waste obtained by removing a stiru-
lated percentege of uranium and plutonium at 150 days after discharge
wné sending the remaining quantities to waste along with all the other
ectinides,; and all zctinide deughters generated since discharge from
the reactor.

6. CONTRIBUTION OF EACE COMPONENT TO TEE HAZARD OF THE
WASTE FROM A PWR SPENT-FUEL PROCESSING PLANT

The results of the calculations presented in this section show the
relative importance of the contribution that the various components make
to the hazard of the waste from z PWR spent-fuel processing plant for
the previcusly described standard conditions and 99.5% recovery of
uranium apd plutonium; i.e., 0.5% of U and Pu and 100% of ali other
components are discharged as waste and stored some place after suitable
processing.

Teble 3 shows the percentage contribution of the actinides (inclnding
their decay products) to the total hazard measure (water required for
dilution of the content of one metric ton to the RCC for the mixture) of
the waste as determined with three different sets of RCGs and the effect

of removing 129;

from the waste. Beyond about BOO years, the actinides
and their daughters dominate from a hazard measure viewpoint and show no
significant effect up to about 10 years due to the different sets of
RCGs. At greater times, the relative importance of the actinides dimin-
ishes somewhat when the RCGs of ref. 6 or ref. 9 (see Appendix I) are
used for the unlisted nuclides in place of the recommended default values
in the Federal Code of Regulstions. Most of this difference can be
attributed to the difference in RCGs for the nuclides of the 233 decay

chain (4n+l series), particularly those for 2291, ang 2%%pa.

The remeining contribution to the hazard measure is almost all
(structural elements are not important) from fission products with 1291
supplying 88% of this total at 10° years and rising bo 98.4% at 100 years.
Essentially all of the remaining fission product hazard for the longer
times is contributed by the Br 93 + Pe, and 135g,

The relative contributions of each actinide and its daughter to
the total hazard measure resulting from the mixture of the actinides
and their daughters are given in Table 4, which shows that wp to 10%
years the actinide weste hazard is mostly controlled by the americium
and curium with no significant differences resulting from the different

RCGs. At much greater decsy times, the long-lived 23g (2.1 x 10° year

half-life) and its daughters begin to dominate. Another important point
is that the remeining actinides along with their daughters, namely, Ac,
Th, Pa, Bk, Cf, and Es, make a negligible contribution to the waste
hazard. The contribution of uranium to the hazard of the U + Fu mixture
alone varied from negligible to a meximum of 25% at 10% years. The import
of these results is that in any waste management system in which at least
99.5% of the uranium and plutonium is extracted, a significant reduction
in the actinide waste hazard can only be obtained by removal of most of
the americium, curium, and neptunium from the waste. If 99.5% removal of
these three actinides is also effected, the uranium and plutcnium become
controlling and it would then psy (from a waste hazard viewpoint) to
increase the extraction efficiency of these latter elements, particularly

the plutonium.

The absolute values of the contribution of each component to the
nazard measure in cubic meters of water per metric ton of fuel are shown
in Table 5. To put these values in perspective, consider the required
2.3 x 1030 m3 fmetric ton for dilution of all the nuclides to the RCG
after decaying 100 years. This volume of water is approximately equal
to the yearly flow of the Mississippi River into the Gulf of Mexico.
Note that the last two rows in Table 5 are based cn the RCGs given in
refs. 6 and 9, respectively, for nuclides unlisted in the Code of Federal
Regulations, which {for beyond 10% years) results in an increasingly
smaller hazard measure that is about a factor of 67 and 37 lower, respec-
tively, at 100 years.

The apparent large quantity of water required for dilution to the
RCS for just one ton of fuel tends to magnify the potential hazard. No
reasonable scenario can be constructed that visualizes rapid mixing or
dissolution of waste that has been processed into a very slightly soluble
form. The ingestion hazard measure refers to potential long-term solution-
ing. However, consideration of suck quantities of water does present ore
argument for decreasing the “quantity of actinides for ultimate disposal
by recycling the actinides back through the power reactors producing
ther. On the other hand, Bell and Dillon’ (using their RCGs) point out

that, after aging 1000 years, the actinide hazard measure of waste stored

teirberg and co-workers. In this section, their work is discussed

3.4

briefly aleng with the gested use of controlled thermonuclear
¥ 8

reactors.

The problem fissicn products cannot be eliminated by any system of
fission power remctors operating in either a stagnant or expanding miclear
power economy since the production rate exceeds the elimination rste by
burnout and decay. Only at equilibrium will the production and removal
rates be equal, #& condition that is never attained in power reactors.
Equilibrium can be obtained, however, for a system that includes the
stockpile of fission products as part of the system inventory since the
stockpile will grow until its decay rate equals the net production rate
of the system. For the projected miclear power economy, however, this
will require a very large stockpile with its associated potential for
release of large quantities of hazardous radioisotopes to the environ
ment. It is this stockpile that must be greatly reduced or eliminated
from the biosphere. A method suggested by Steinberg et al. is transmu-
tation in "burner reactors,” which are designed to maximize neutron
absorption in separated fission products charged to a reactor. If
sufficient rumbers of these burners are used, the fission product
inventory of a muclear power system can then reach equilibrium and be
maintained at an irreducible minimur, which is the guantity contzined
in the reactors, the chemical processing plants, the transportation

system, and in some industrisl plents.

Burning fission products in the blanket of a fusion reactor with
the excess neutrons that are produced is,in theory, an excellent method
since no fission products would be produced. Considerable tritium will
be produced, of course, but this presents a much less severe disposal
problem.
25

(oviously the use of burner reectors or fusion regeters in the
system will increase the cost of ouclear power and reduce potential
breeding capacity but transmutation is certainly one of two known
methods (the other Yeing disposal in space) of eliminating most of
these hazardous materials wiik ro possidility of return to the bio-

sphere.

7.1 Had Breemontoto-Production Ratios for Fission Products

If the assumplicn is made thal burner reactors are a desirable
adjunct to a nuclear economy, what are the design requirements and
limitations? It is obvious that they must maximize (with due regard
to economics) the ratio of burnout of a particular fission product to
its production rate in fission reactors,end the neutron flux must be
high enough to cause a significant decrease in ites effective half-life.
Of the fission types, the breeder reector has the most efficient neutron
economy and in principle would make the most efficient burner if all or
part of the fertile material can be replaced by & Sr-Cs mixture without
causing chemical processing problems or too large 2 perturbation in the
flux spectrum beceuse of the different characteristics of these fission
products. The cost accounting in such a system would set the value cf
nzutrons absorbed in the fission product feed at an accounting cost equal
to the value of the fuel bred from those meutrons.

The maxim possible burnout of fission products would occur when
the excess neutrons per fission that would be absorbed in a fertile
material are absorbed instead in the fission product feed. The largest
possible burnout ratio would then be the breeding ratio {or conversion
ratio for non-breeders) divided by the fission product yield. The esti-
mated breeding ratio for the Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR), a thermal
breeder, is 1.05 and for the Liquid Metal Fueled Fast Breeder Reector
(IMFER), 1.38. The yield of 137cs + Por is 0.12 atom/fission, tut a
nurber of other isotcpes of these elements are produced which would alsc
absorb neutrons. However, if the fission product waste is aged two years

before separation of the cesium and strontium, the mixture will essentially
26

be composed of about 80% 137s + Ps ana 20% 135 (which will capture
neutrons to form 138 Cs that decays with & 13-day half-life); ; conseguertly
the maximum burnout ratio for 1370s + Hs will be decreased by 20%.

This leads to = maximum possible burnout ratio of about 7 for the MSBR
and about 9 for the LMFBR. Unfortunetely, however, the neutron fluxes
in these designs are well below 1G'C nfen® sec. Any modifications of
these desigrs to create high neutron fluxes will increase the neutron
leakage and decrease the burnout ratics significantly.

7.2 Reactor Residence Times Required for Fission Product Burnout

Table § was prepared to illustrate the effect of neutron flux on
the residence times (which affect recycle costs) required for burnout
and decay of 99.6% of the irportent nuclides using a burner reactor with
the neutron spectrum similar to that of a2 typical light water power
reactor. 1% is spparent that the efficiency of turnout incresses with
increases in neutron flux, cross sections,and half-life. With the excep-
tion of 129 which is not nearly as large a& probiem 8s the others and
can probably be essentialiy disposed of by isotopic ailution,’ the times
shown in Table 8 indicate that neutron flux levels are reguired which
are much higher than those that have been attained in present nuclear
reactors (~ 5 x 10 =) and that fluxes near 1077 af cn®-sec are probably
necessary before serious consideration could be given to burner -eactors.

In a conceptual design study by Steinberg et al. Jt it was concluded
that the quantities of 370s » Cg , and Br scheduled for permanent stor-
age in the projected nuclear economy could be reduced by a factor of 1000
by burner reactors operating with neutron fluxes up to 106 fen’ sec
for added costs of 0.63, 0.24, ard 0.021 mill/kWhr(e) respectively. The

1
Dg and 13704 in such a system, along

estimated costs for burning out
with the probable escalation in an actual design study that ineludes
directly the costs of transfer between plants, canning the fission

products, additional chemicsel separations, various temporary storage
facilities, and reactor residence times seem to preclude use of this

method. A cost of C,021 mill/kWhr(e) for burning 85 seems sufficiently

low for consideration on an eccnomic basis but the neutron absorption
cross-section of Br was taken as 15b, 2 value now known to be low by
arcund an order of megnitude. Recent work by Bemis et at gives a
Maxwellian-averaged thermal value of 1.66 v and a resonance integral of
1.3 b., A reevaluation of the 85, removal system using the lower cross
section would increase the cost to an uneconomic level.

7.3 Application of Transmutation Schemes

Nichels and Bl omeke have made estimates of the effect of various
schemes of neutron-induced trarcmutation on. the potential inventory of radio-
isotopes and costs of electric power (Teble 9). The isotope Og, was
used as an exemple because it is the prime contributor to the radio-
logical hazard of spent fuel and does not require the use of isotopic
separations (other than providing for decay of 89% — half-life 50 days)
before recycle to & burner reactor. Their analysis of the use of each
reactor system shown in Teble 9 are given in following secticns,

7.3.1 Pressurized Water Reactors

Rows 1 and 2 of Teble 9 illustrate that the effect of recycling of
Er within a system of light walter reactors is to cause essentially no
change in the total quantity of gp that is associated with the system
since the rate of neutron-induced transmutation is small as compared
with the rate of decay. Under current policies and plans,most of the
90g associated with the system would be stored at a federsl waste
repository. In the recycling system most of the inventory would be in
reactors while the remginder {(~ 25% of the total) would be ir canals for

postirradiation decay, reprocessing plants, and fuel fabrication plants.

This exemple illustrates a primary disadvantage of systems for re-
cycle and neutron transmutation of fission prcduct nuclides. These
schemes have the common characteristic that larger quantities of radio-
active nuclides are being actively handled and processed than if the
nuclides were stored. Consequently, larger guantities of these nuclides
occur in a dispersible form and are associated with potentially large

sources of energy that could provide a mechanism for dispersal.

The additional cost of recycling Lg, to light water power reactors
was estimated roughly as 0,1 mill/kWhr(e). The primary source of this
cost is an approximately 25% increase in the unit cost of reprocessing
and fuel fabrication. This reflects the increased separations and product
handling operations that would be required at the reprocessing plants and
the requirements for shielding and remcte cperation of the fuel fabrica-
tion plants. The estimated costs cf high-level waste disposal would be
decreased from about 0.05 to about 0.04 mill/kWhr(e), however.

7.3.2 Liquid Metal Fast Breeder Reactor

The effects of recycle of Og in IMFERs (rows 3 and U4) are essen-
tielly the same as those for a system of light water reactors. Inven-

¢ 90

tories o Sr are lower, however, because of the lower yield of gy

from fission of plutonium.

7.3.3 High Flux Isotope Reactor

The effect of recycle of Pg to a system of High Flux Isotope
Reactors is shown to indicate the relative change in inventory that
would result from the use of the maximum thermal neutron flux levels
that are available in present reactors (~2'x 10-7 ‘n/em’- sec with
targets in place). Even with these high values of flux the effect of
recycling is to decrease the inventory essodiated with the system by
only about 60%.

This type of reactor would not be an economical source of electric
power, however, because of its small size, high refueling cost, and high

neutron lszkage.,

7.3.14 Fusion Reactors
3

A proposal by Steiner” involves using the excess neutrons from
fusion reactors, which in theory will provide a cheap and abundant
source of neutrons and has the advantage of not producing any long-
lived fission products. Considerable tritium will be produced, of

course, but this presents az much less severe disposal problem. Steiner
estimates, on the basis of calculated tritium breeding ratios and antici-
pated tritium doubling times, a neutron excess of 20% end a thermal
neutron flux aveileble for burnout of 3 x 1016. On this basis, a recycle
system from which 98% of the power is generated in IMFERs and 2% is gen-
erated in a fusion burner reactor would have an order-of-magnitude lower

Dg inventory than a system of LMFZRs.

In a recent paper by Wolkenhauer JH some aspects of the problems of
burning fission products in controlled thermonuclear reactors were con-
sidered in more detail. He concluded that if a D-T reactor with a tritium

breeding ratio of 1.2 is used to transmute the total 137¢s and 90

Sr from
a nuclear power economy, 5% of the generating capacity would have come
from CTR plants. Only 1% of the generation capacity would be reguired
if D-D reactors were used. Using the worth of neutrons for the produc-
tion of fissile plutonivm as & basis, it was estimated that the cost of
transmting 1370s and 90g, would be at least 10 times as expensive as
the estimated cost of storage of all fission products in deep salt

formations,

Regardless of any potential merits to using controlled thermonuclear
reactors to burn fission products, such systems cannot be seriously con-
sidered at present since it is generally felt that the practical fusion
reactor is stili 30 years in the future.

7.3.5 Spallation Reactor

In an effort to devise a system with both z high neutron flux and a

high burnout ratio, Gregory and Steinberg” have suggested the use of a
spallation reactor. A typical spallation burner reactor would use a
1000-MW(e) nuclear reactor to power a high-energy accelerator; the
accelerator, in turn, would produce a S500-MW beam of 10-BeV protons,

a neutron source of greater than 10%° neutrons/sec in a liguid uranium
target, and a thermal flux of sbout 2 x 107 n/crf+sec in an array of
D,0-moderated Hsp. targets. This apprcach would require extensive
development including, in particular, a method for coping with the

potentially severe radiation damage and heat transfer problems.
32

In this system one spallation reactor of capacity 1000 MW(e) would
be associated with each 9000 MW(e) of power produced by IMFBRs. The
cost penalty would be approximately C.8 mi11/ kr (e) , primarily associ-
ated with the capital and operating costs of the spallation reactor that

does not produce electricity for sale.

8. ACTINIDE RECYCLING IN A PWR

In this secticn the actinide recycling calculations made with the
medified ORIGEN code are discussed and the pertinent results given. In
eddition, the chemical processing requirements are discussed in general
from a viewpoint of simplifying waste management and, more specifically,
as applied to actinide recycling.

8.1 Flowsheet

The general flowsheet assumed for these actinide recycling caicu-
lations is shown in Fig, 1. For the calculations, it was assumed that
chemical processing of the spent fuel occurred instantaneously at 150
days after discharge from the reactor. For simplificetion, the actinides
recycled were taken as those present at that time. In any actual recycling
scheme, the recycle material would spend more time out of the reactor.
However, because of the relatively long half-lives of the actinides
anithe very small buildup of daughters in any resscnable time between
processing and recycle, no significant differences in the results would
occur for holdup times of a factor of 2 or so longer.

In addition, it is quite possible that any recycling scheme would
include iransuranium wastes {from sweepings, sludge, scray metal, filters,

ion exchange resins, etc.) produced in the nuclear industry. Although such
wastes would be produced in large quantities, recycling them would not

cause significant difference in the results and conclusions of this
study.

From a caleculational standpoint, the method of including the recycle
material with the fuel is immaterial since the calculations must assume
homogeneity. The recycle material for each recycle calculation was merely
considered as a uniform eddition to the normal loading of 3.3% enriched
urenium fuel.

8.2 Chemical Processing for Waste Management Simplification

In any waste management system, and particularly if recycling of
the actinides is practiced, chemical processing plays a key role. The
importance is such that the previously unpublished comments by Blomeke
19

and Leuze on separation of radioactive materials into selected frac-

tions for improving waste management are given in this section.

One possible way to simplify management of waste from nuclear fuel
reprocessing is to separate the radioactive materials into fractions
based upon the time they must be stored before release to the environ-
ment is allowed. An indication cf the magnitude of the problem when the
solution of the high-level waste management problem is approached by this
path can be gained from Teble 10. The fission-product and actinide ele-
ments of greatest concern are listed, and the reguired degree of separa-
tion of each from high-level waste is given for various times of decay.
After the bulk waste bas been stored for 10 years, 12 figsion-product
elements and 11 actinides (constituting about 15 kg/ton of fuel charged
to the reactor) must be separated from the remeining fission products
{~ 20 kg/ton of fuel) and process reagent chemicals by factors ranging
from 4 (for ectinium) to 2 x 10 + (for strontium). The residuals would
then be of a nature that would permit their release under the present

Radiation Concentretion Guides (one-third of the values given in ref. 8).

The separated fission products and actinides should ideally be
further separated from each other, based on thelr rates of decay, into
at least three groups. The first group would contain Fu, Sb, Ce, Pm,
and possibly H, and would require containment for several decades
{< 100 years). It is conceivable that this group could be retained
on-site for this period of tine.

The second group would be composed of those fission products
requiring storage of the order of 1000 years, i.e., Sr, Eu, and
possibly Sm. The remaining fission products with very long half-lives
are only feebly radicactive, and it m2y be reasonable to combine them
with the second group for 1000-year storage, or slse they could be

separated and stored or recycled with the actinides.

She Radiation Concentration Guide values are one-third of those given in
the FRB (RCGs of ref. 6 were used for the unlisted muclides), and should
result in a radiation dose to the general public of less than 170 mrem/year.
(These values, however, ars based upon ingestion of the liquid effluents
and do not allow for reconcentration in the environment.)

Paste is generated in reprocessing spent PWR fuel initially enriched to
3.3% 235U, and exposed to 33,000 MWd/metric ton at 30 MW/ ton. The waste
consists of all fhe ncongaseous fission products plus the actinides remain-
ing efter removal of 99.5% of the uranium and plutonium following a post-
irradiation decay period of 150 days.
/A11 of the actinides, except Bk and Cf, require containment for a
period greater than 10,000 years; hence, they would comprise a third
group. It is reasonable that Bk and Cf should be relegated to this
group since they would contribute insigrificantly to the bulk.

Fractionation of waste into such groups for waste management entails
a mumber of difficult chemical separations. A severe problem is caused
by hydrolysis of several materials tc form colloids and precipitates.
When these are present, it is virtually impossible to ‘obtain the neces-
sary separations. In most cases, the extremely high decontamination
factors required have never been demonstrated. Separation of the
trivaient actinides (americiuvm and curium) must be made from kilogram
quantities of the lanthanides, and the long-lived lanthanides (europium
and samarium) must be separated from the other lanthanides. These ele
nents have very similar chemical behavior, and separations mush be mede
by chromatographic ion exchange which requires close process control.
There is no practical process available for removing tritium from large
volumes of aqueous waste, and iodine removal with decontamination factors
of 10° will be difficult. However, processes now under development for
IMFER fuel should make it possible to remove these materials tefore and
during feed adjustment for reprocessing of the fuel.

Difficuliizs have been encountered during chemical separations with
the hydrolysis of plutonium, thorium, protactinium, and zirconium to form
colloidal material that does not behave well in s=2parations processes.
Most of the plutonium in aqueous waste from the first Purex cycle is in
‘gn inextractable form. TFven exhaustive extraction will not remeve this
plutonium unless some treatment can be developed to convert it to a
solubie, ionic species. Experience has shown that when significant
emounts of zirconium are present, it often hydrolyzes to form colloids
or precipitates, or both, which carry polyvalent icns such as americium
and curium, This greatly complicates the separations problems and makes
it virtually impossible to remove quantitatively the zircopium and asso-
cigted ions from a waste stream.

Although separations processes have been developed for essentially
211 of the heavy elements and fission products, these processes are not
38

directly applicable to the problem of quantitatively isolating these
materials into compact fracticns for waste management. The existing
processes were developed for the purpose of recovering significant
quantities of a particular element, and recoveries of 90 to §9% were
considered to be satisfactory. Furthermore, these processes usually
result in en increase in contaminated waste instead of a decrease, since
process chemicals required are discharged into waste streams along wit
significant amounts of contamination. Modification of these processes
to give decontamination factors of 10° to 10-0 without creating larger
volumes of waste from contaminated chemical resgents will require a
major development program. Since the overall fission preduct decon-
tamination factors usually attained over a single Purex cycle are only
about 10%, it cannot be expected that fully developed processes for
waste fractionation, even for elements that are well behaved chemically,
will give larger decontamination factors. Thus two, three, or even four
cycles will be reguired to give overall decontamination factors of 108

to 108°. ;

Unfortunately, the optimum grouping of radioactive elements for
waste management does not correspond with natural groupings based upon
chemical behavior. Processes for removing americium smd curium from
the waste stream will also remove all of the lanthanides and yttrium
(~ 11 ke/ ton of fuel) with compsrsble decontamination factors. About
10 kg/ton of fuel of these are either nonradioactive or have short
enough half-lives so they can be released after less than 100 years
storage if they are adequately decontaminated from Eu, Sm, Am, and Cm
(see Table 10); and the Eu and Sm must be stored sbout 1000 years if
they are adequately decontaminated from Az and Cm. Thus, the separation
of Am, Cm, Sm, and Zu from the other waste products and into groups for
ease in waste management entails a considerable number of process steps,
each requiring close process control because of the chemical similarity

of these elements and very large decontamination factors required.

In summery, it can be concluded that the greatest contribution te
weste management through chemical separations lies in separating the

actinide elements from all of the fission products for either storage
39

or recycling, If not recycled, these elements require virtually permanent
containment and this could probably be acccmplished with greater ease in the
sbsence of the heat-generating fission products. A quantitative assessment
of the reduction in hazard achievable “rom actinide separations in excess

of those considered in the body of this report is presented in Appendix IIT.
There it is shown tnat, if separations processes can be developed to yield
an overall recovery of 99.999% of the uranium, 99.995% of the plutonium,
99.95% of the neptunium, and 99.9% of the americium and curium, the residual
wastes would have about the same ingestion hazard as naturally occurring

radioactive minerals after only a few hundred years.
8.3 Effect of Recycle on Reactivity and Flux

Tne average material k (neutron multiplication constant) or k, of the
recycled actinides is lower than that for a normel reactor loading, but not
much lower, as shown in Tables 11 and 12. Table 11 shows the effect of
recycling of 99.5% of the actinides up to 60 times {equivalent to 180 years
of reactor operstion). The maximum average reactivity decrease is ahout
0.8% =nd is attained in about five cycles. This decrease can be counter-
zcted by only about a 2% increase in fissile material, which is not prohib-
itive since this can be accomplished by increasing the enrichment of the
fuel from 3.3 to 3.4%. Similar results are shown in Table 12 for recycling
of 59.9% of the actinides which, as co be expected, causes a slightly greater
reactivity decrease. Table 13 shows that the effect of recycling of the
actinides (for either 99.9% or 99.5% to three significant figures) on the
thermal flux is sufficiently smell to be of no significance to the reactor
operation.

8.4 Effect of Recycling on Hazard Measure

The effect of recycling of 99.5% of the actinides other than U or Pu
or the hazard measure of the waste from PWR spent-fuel processing at 150
days after reactor discharge is shown in Tsble 14 as a function of post-
irradiation decay time. Similar results are shown in Table 15 for 99.9%

extraction and recycling of the actinides.

percentage) to that required for dilution of the waste after each
successive recycle is an indication of the efficacy of recycling

from a potential hazard viewpoint. This retio is defined as the hazard
reduction factor (the higher the ratio, the greater the hazard reduction).
Table 16 shows a different method based on the activities in curies for
evaluating the efficacy of recycling.

Table 1lt shows that the hazard reduction factors of the waste with
99.5% of the actinides extracted equilibrates at 42.5 for a decay time
of 1c? years. When the RCGs of refs. 6 and 9 are used for the unlisted
nuclides in place of the recommended default values in the Code of Federal
Regulatiocas, the hazard reduction factors become 6.5 and 10 respectively.
The corrasponding values for 99,9% extraction of the actinides are 28 and
49. Although it can be argued that the RCGs calculated by LaVerne’ are
more realistic than the more conservative recommended default values,
the Code of Federal Regulations must be followed in nuclear reactor

design and operation.

Note that the last row in both Tables 14 and 15 show recycle effi-
ciencies at each decay time. These efficiencies represent the percentage
of the maximum possible hazard reduction factor that is attaineble after
effective equilibrium is reached in the recycling process. The maximum
possible hazard reduction factor is the ratio of water required for
dilution of the standard waste with only 99.5% of U + Pu removed {or
99.9%) to that required for the same waste when 99.5% (or 99.9%) of all
actinides are extracted at 150 days after discharge from the reactor.
This is precisely what is contained in Tebles 14 and 15 for zero recycle
or cne pass through the reactor. These are cbviously the largest hazard
reduction factors obtainable at a specified decay time since they are
based on the removal of 99.5% {or 99.9%) of all the actinides rather than
Just the U + Pu. Each additional recycle increases the hazard measure
of the discharged material in asymptotic fashion. The steady-state
recycle efficiencies shown are simply obtained by dividing the values
for 60 recycles (or 30 in Table 15) by the values in the first row at
corresponding decay times. In a similer fashion, the recycle efficiency
can be calculated for each cycle by dividing the value for the particular
cycle by that for the zero recycle.

The results in Tables LL and 15 show that when recycling is prac-
ticed, the hazard measure of the waste is approximately proportional to
the neptunium, americium, and curium sent to the waste since the hazard
reduction factor is about five times greater when 0.1% of the actinides
is sent to the waste after each cycie than that for the 0.5% case. This
obtains logically because the reactor discharce composition is little
affected by a change of only 0.4% of recycled actinides in the feed
stream. The standard case is also little affected by whether 0.1% or
0.5% of U + Pu is present since the americium and curium predominate
at smaller decay times and neptunium after 10? years. It Is for similar
reasons that the cycle efficiencies are virtually independent of the
percentage of material that is recycled. It follows that if 93.99%
removal is effected, the hazard reduction factors of Table 15 will
increase by about a factor of 10 to about 2000 at 10° years, All
three tables show that the hazard reduction factors decrease asymp-
totically with the number of recycles, which is a result of the buildup
of the higher transuranics, and that effective equilibrium is attained

in 20 cycles more or less depending on the decay time.

Minime in the hazard reduction factors of Tables 14 and 15 as a
function of decay time occur at around 200 years in the first few
recycles with z gradual shift to between 103 and 1c years for larger
numbers of recycles. The reasons for this behavior are rather involved
and include the relative change in toxicity as well as the change in

total activity of the varicus nuclides.

As an gid in tnderstanding this and other phenomena, the relstive
contribution (when > 0.01%) of each aetinide by itself (regardless of
whether discharged from the reactor or generated by decay) and by each
of their daughters to the hazard measure of zero recycles and 60 recycles
are shown in Tables 17 and 18, respectively; the standard case for 99.5% ex-
traction of U + Pu is shown in Table 19. (See Appendix II for a listing
of activity in curies and the hazard measure of all actinide nuclides
as a function of time after discharge.) Note that the basis for these
tables is different from that of Tables 4 to § wkere the contribution
from each actinide includes all of its daughters. Observe that in <he

stendard case (Table 19) the curium is 79% of the total after 10 years
decay and varies from 16 tc 42% during recycling (Tebies 17 and 18). In

}
Zhen (18-year half-life), but

the standard case, the curium is mostly
its fraction of the total curium content diminishes with recycling.
Consequently, it is the relatively rapid decay .of the 2bhe, (the con-
trolling nuclide in the standard case) compared with the smaller effect

on the recycled waste that is responsible for the initisl rapid drop in the
hazard reduction factors for the first 100 years or so. The shift in the
location of the minima to larger decay time can be attributed to the

buildup of 24S, and 2460p,

After the first few recycles, the hazard reduction factors rise to
gbout the same value, regardless of the number of recycles for long decay
times. This reflects the fact that --/Np discharged from the reactor
controls the waste hazard at long times and that the concentration of
this nuclide rapidly reaches equilibrium, This is borne out by the
detailed date which show the 233; decay chain (4n + 1 series), of which
37x is a member, makes the dominant contribution. Table 20 shows the

237

neptunium (aimost all Np) discharged from the reactor attains a

constant value after five recycles.

Recycling of the actinides and achieving a 99.9% extraction effi-
ciency reduce the hazard measure of the actinides at equilibrium to the
same order as that of the long-lived fission products (1297, 932», 93m, ,
re , and 135 Cs) for the longer decay times, the hazard measures of the
actinides being about twice that of the long-lived fission products at
1000 years and dropping to shout one-half of the fission product value
at 10° years. However, if 1°91 is eliminated as a hazard by isotopic
dilution (or separate storage), the actinides would still control the
total waste hazard. An actinide extraction efficiency of 99.599+% along
with the recycling is required before the hazard measure of the total

waste hazard is controlled by the long-lived fission products cther than

I.

one typical PWR operating at 1000 MWe with an 0.8 plant factor and an
annual average discharge of about 23 tons [year of spent fuel. Also shown
is the effect of recycling on the hazard reduction for an actinide extrac-
tion efficiency of 99. 5%. These plots represent the waste hazard accumu-
lation per reactor for 60 years of operation when disposal or permanent
storage occurs after 10 years. This operation time span seems sufficient
to cover the lifetime of a PWR nuclear power industry. Figure 2 shows
the cumulative hazard from 10 to 70 years after discharge. The hazard
redueticn factor (ratic of the standard case to the recycle case at any
indicated decay time) achieved by recycling starts at about 40, rapidly
drops to 20 in 10 years, and slowly drops to about 10 by 70 years after
discharge. Figure 3 shows the same results for decay times between 500
and 10 years for which decreases are shown initially in the cumulative
hazard because the reactor was considered shut down at 60 years of
operation with no further additions to the waste. At later decay times
the cumulative hazard increases because of the buildup of 220, and its
daughters as the result of decay of 37x. This increase would be much
smaller if RCGs of ref. 8 were used and the curve would flatten out with
the RCGs of ref. 6 (see Teble 5). For the long-term decay pericd shown
in Fig. 3, the hazard reduction factor has dropped initially to a little
below 10, but after 10* years builds back up to a little over 40. At
these longer times the hazard reduction factor can be simply obtained by
averaging the values for the first 30 recycles (60 years of operation)
shown in Table 14 because essentially all the hazard comes from actinides

with long half-lives, the shortest being 458 years for 2 “Am with the

others having half-lives TrEsured in thousands of years. For such a
condition, it makes little difference that the first discharge is 60
years older than the last one; each discharge contributes about the same
to the cumulative hazard for times greater than 500 years. This is, of
course, not true for the shorter times, which is the reason for the gap
between 60 and 500 years when the hand calculations using the normal

ORIGEN output become too long to be practical.

8.5 Effect of Recycling on the Hazards [of
Chemical Processing and Fuel Fabrication
i
Recycling of reactor actinide waste will increase the radiation
. i
problem associated with chemical processing and fuel |Tebrication because
of the increased radioactivity of the reactor feed and discharge streams.
In this section these problems are examined somewhat land the effect on

chemical processing 1s discussed.

Table 20 shows the recycle effect on the buildup of each actinide
in the reactor discharge stream after cooling 15C days\ and before any
chemical processing. The tsble also indicates the atthinment of effec-
tive equilibrium. True equilibrium cannot be a2ttained \in practical
irradiation times because of the small removal cross sebtions (decay +

al 2
capture + fission) of Hn ang 229

Cm. The small changes in the actinides
that are still occurring after 60 recycles can be traced primarily to
2B, the amount of 250 Cm present is too small to have : noticeable
effect. From a purely chemical separations viewpoint, tn changes in
compositions are not significant. Handling problems; however , are
increased by the buildup of nuclides that undergo spontaneous fission.

The slight increase of ebout 3% in the gamma activity thet occurred as

the result of recycling is of no consequence.

The Purex separations process now in use removes only Pu and U from
the waste stream (see Sect. 8.2 for a more detailed discussion on chemical
processing). For. recycling ; the other actinides must 2lso be extracted from
this waste strzam containing the fission products. + ig generally felt that
the process can be adjusted to permit 99.9% extraction of the U + Fu. By
small changes in the process, neptunium could 2lso be extracted. Removal
of the Am and Cm Is not as =asy since some of the rare-earth fission
products have similar chemistry. The separation would not have to be
toc clean, tnt contamination with rare earths with high neutron cross
szctions shouid be large enough to degrade the neutron economy of the
reactor when recycled. Whether the Ac, Th, and Pa are removed or sent
to waste is not important since their effect on the hazard is negligible

see Sect. 5). The effect of Bk, Cf, and Es produced in one pass through
P
57

the reactor also has a negiigible effect on the waste hazard, but she
buildup of Cf and Cm seriously increases the neuiron emission rate by
¢,n reactions and by spontaneous fission, with the latter dominating.
Table 21 shows that the source of neutrons ir the material recycled is
mostly curium {(primerily 2b, and heey after two cycles, but that the
Cf {primarily 25 Zee) rapidly becomes controlling after a few recycles.

This increased neuiron activity due to recycling should cause no
real problem in chemical processing since the thick concrete walls
required for gamma shielding should alse be adequate for the neutrons,
A potential problem arises in fuel fabrication and handling, regardless
of whether the recycle material is mixed with new fuel or made into
separate elements. The same problem also exists for fabricating fuel
elements from recycied plutonium. Bell and NicholsZ? estimate that the
neutrcr source for recycled plutonium builds up to about 10° n/sec ver
metric ton of plutonium. Table 21 shows that if the californium is
removed, he curinm would control and the neutron source would only be
reduced by a factor of 300. The curium produced along with the associ-
ated neptunium snd americium would generate comsiderably more neutrons
per unit weight (3.6 x 10th

by spontaneous fizsion ard Q,n reactions than would plutonium, The

per metric ton of the mixture at equilibrium)

quantities involved, however, are smaller than in the case of plutonium
recycle, It seems that actinide recycle material could be handled withe
out too mach change in the way of design or handling procedures developed
for piutonium recycle fuel ever if the neutron source strengtn is somewhat
larger. Removal of the neutron source, 25202, can be accomplished by not
recycling Cf even trough there fs en increese in the Cf production with
curium buildup. Sigrificant es Zoe buildup occurs Irom svecessive aeutron

Recycling of waste through a reactor does add to the inventory of
hazardous materials in process which could increase the severity of an
accidental release of radioactive material. The hazard measure of the
sctinide waste based on ingestion was increased by only 12% after 60
recycles. The total is about one-tenth of that for the fission products.
If the hazard measure is based on inhalation, recycling increases the
potential hazard by a Tactor of 2 at discharge (see Table 21) with the
average in the reactor being significantly higher. Since the fission
products produce an inhalation hazard measure of only 3.7 x 1046 3 /metric
ton of fuel compared to a value up to 2.5 x 107 for the actinides, it
would seem that the potential hazard of an operating reactor would te
increased by recycling of the actinides. . However, actinide concentra-
tion in a resctor is not significent in analyzing the "maximum credible
accident” (MCA) since the actinide compounds are not velatile and cannot
te significantly dispersed into the atmosphere by any credible reactor
accident, Transmutation of fission products in burner reactors would,
of course, add to the potential hazard of the MCA because the volatile”

fission products are controlling in an accident analysis.

and kr, by
neutron-induced transmutation as a result of recycling in existing or

Elimination of the fission products, Sr,
projected designs of power reactors is not possible since the neutron
fluxes are not high enough to lower the effective half-lives of these
nuclides by a significant amount. Special burner reactors with neutron
fluxes in the order of 1007 n/ en®.sec are required for that purpose.
Spallation reactors and fusion reactors are possibilities,but the latter
is certainly not feasible with current technclogy. The former, at best,
would require an extensive development program including, in particular,
a method for coping with the potentially severe radiation damage and heat
transfer problems. It seems that ultimate storage in deep geological
formations of known characteristics {such as salt mines) remains the
best method for fission product disposal since less than 1000 years is
required to reducz the activity to an imnocuocus level. Assurance of
tectonic stability for 1000 years with a very high degree of confidence
is quite possible in some geological formaticns. The actinides ard their
daughters, of course, with half-lives measured in many thousands of years
should be excluded from the biosphere for a length of time for which
tectonic stability can be assured with a lesser confidence level. There
is, therefore, a stronger motive for disposal or reduction in the accumu-
lation of the actinides by some other method such as by transmutation in

nuclear reactors.

When over 99% of the plutonium and uranium has been extracted,
significant further reduction in the potential long-term hazard of the
waste from PWRs (and undoubtedly other types) can only be achieved by similar
removal of the neptunium, americium, and curium. Consequently, if the
actinides are to be disposed of separately from the fission products, it
peys from g waste hazards viewpoint to concentrate on developing economic
chemical processes for removal of the latter three actinides from the

fission products.

Recycling these actinides through the reacters producing them has
promise for reducing the long-term waste hezerd, particularly if 99.9%
61

extraction of neptunium, americium, and curium is achieved, an extraction
efficiency that already appears feasible for piutonium and uranium. The
results of this study indicate that long-term hazard reduction factors

up to about 200 are possible with a 99.9% actinide extraction efficiency
with subsequent recycling of the neptunium, americium, and curium, Largér ,
hazard reduction factors are possible with higher efficiencies, and the
hazard reduction factors are approximately proporticnal to the quantities

of the sctinides sent to the waste.

Keeyele of actinides in the LMFBRs should produce sven higher hazard
reduction factors since the average fission-to-capture :atio of the acti
nides should be higher in a fast reactor than in a thermal one. Fast
cross-section sets for the higher actinides should be developed so that
recycling ‘studies can be made for the LMFERs.

It also appears that recycling of the actinides is particularly suited
for a fluid fuel reactor such as the wser, 21 A processing scheme has been
visualized that recycles essentially all the uranium, neptunjum, thorium,
and most of the other actinides. Considerably less americium and curium
are produced compared to a PWR, which considerably simplifies the waste
disposal problem. In addition, being a fluid fuel reactor, the problems
arising from fabrication and handling of heavy neutron-emitting fuel
elements are eliminated. A study similar to this one should be made for
the MSER using chemical processing that minimizes the actinide content

of the waste streams.

Official or standard values for the RCGs for nuclides appearing in
the waste that are unlisted in the Code of Federal Regulations should be
established since using the recommended default values seems too conserva-
tive for decay times beyond 10,000 years.

Some consideratior should be given to other methods of evaluating
the potential hazard of the waste from chemical processing and possibly
a standard developed that considers the probability of discharge into the
biosphere. In particular, scenarios of possible interaction with the
environment and potential pathways to the biosphere should be evaluated
as part of the conceptual design and site selection process for waste

repositories.

APPENDIX ITY: HAZARD REDUCTION ACETEVABLE BY ENHANCED
REMOVAL OF ACTINIDE ELEMENTS (REF. 19)

On the basis of the duration of the long-term hazsrd, there is
potential merit in the use of separations processes thet will greatly
reduce the losses of uranium and plutonium to the high-level waste and
separate the high-level waste into fission product and actinide fractions.
The required separations processes have not yet been developed, but it
does appear that secondary treatment processes can be developed that will
permit overall recovery of perhaps 99.999% of the uranium, 99.995% of the
plutonium, 99.95% of the neptunium, and 99.9% of the americivm ané curium.
Also, approximately 99.9% of the iodine, containing the long-lived isotope
129, , can potentially be separated from the remaining fission products on

the basis of its high relative volatility.

Figure L and Table 27 illustrate the possible merits of these separ-
ations by comparing the hazard index snd the hazard measure, respectively,
of the wastes from conventional processing of fuel from a typical light
water power reactor with those resulting from the postulated secondary
treatment. For reference, Fig. 4 also shows the hazerd index that mey
be associated with the mineral pitchblende (which occurs naturally as
pebbles and rocks in Africa and Cansde) and a uranium cre containing 0.2%
U30g (which is typical of the large deposits that occur in tne Colorado
Plateau). The hazard index of the waste from conventional reprocessing
decreases rapidly over the first 1000 years (due to the decay of Psy
and *37Cs) but remains greater then that of pitchblende for periods
exceeding one million years. The waste resulting from secondary treat-
ment, however, has a hazard index that fells within the range of paturelly
occurring radioactive materials after only several hundred years, a time
span for which it is possible to make reliable extrapolations of the
effects of geologic, climatic, and other natural phenomena. As can be
seen from Fig. 5 and Table 28, similar conclusions can be drawn if these
separations are applied to wastes Irom reprocessing LMFER fuels. In each
case, the RCGs calculated by LaVerne’ were used in place of the default

values recommended in 10 CFR 20.

 

*
The hazard index is based on 2 unit volume of waste. This permits a
direct comparison with the potential hazerd of uranium ores on an
in-situ basis.

hile the indicated separations of actinides and fission products
appear to be feasible, it is apparent that a large development progrem
would be required to reduce these concepts to practice. Separations
processes that are used Currently, which utilize solvent extraction and
ion exchange for recovery of small quantities of ceriain valushle acti-

3
aides (em, 252

Cf, ete.) from specially irradieted materials, have
given smericium, curium, and neptunium recoveries in the range of 90
to 99% and plutoniva recoveries of about 99.5%. Since these processes
were originally intended for recovery of the actinide values and not
Tor alleviation of the high-level waste problem, little or no effort
was made to achieve higher recoveries or to reguiete the amounts and
types of chemical reagents for cpiimm waste handling.

Ir order tc evaluate the practicality of such 2 waste management
system, a comprehensive development program is needed (1) to solve
problems that are obvious frum past experience, (2; to increase the
removal of these actinides: to the desired level, (3) to determine the
most desirable method to integrate the needed process cycles inte cne
overall system, (4) to choose chemical processes and resgents that
minimize high-level waste problems, and (5) to Getermine the composi-
tion of intermediate-level waste streams thet will be generated and
wpys to recycle these streams.
