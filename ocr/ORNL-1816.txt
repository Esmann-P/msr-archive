FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at ORNL re-
cords the technical progress of the research on circulating-fuel reactors and all other
ANP research at the Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided
into three major parts: |. Reactor Theory, Component Development, and Construction,
Il. Materials Research, and {}l, Shielding Research.

The ANP Project is comprised of about 400 technical and scientific personnel engaged
in many phases of research directed toward the achievement of nuclear propulsion of air-
craft. A considerable portion of this research is performed in support of the work of other
organizations participating in the national ANP effort. However, the bulk of the ANP
research at ORNL is directed toward the development of a circulating-fuel type of reactor.

The effort on circulating-fuel reactors was, until recently, centered upon the Aircraft
Reactor Experiment. This experiment has now been completed, and the operating ex-
perience is described in Section 1 of Part |.

The design, construction, and operation of the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART), formerly
the Circulating-Fuel Aircraft Reactor Experiment (CFRE), with the cooperation of the
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft Division, are now the specific long-range objectives. The ART
is to be a power plant system that will include a 60-Mw circulating-fuel reflector-moderated
reactor and adequate means for heat disposal. Operation of the system will be for the
purpose of determining the feasibility, and the problems associated with the design, con-
struction, and operation, of a high-power, circulating-fuel, reflector-moderated aircraft
reactor system. The design work, as well as the supporting research on materials and
problems peculiar to the ART (previously included in the subject sections), is now re-
ported as a subsection of Part |, Section 2, ‘‘Reflector-Moderated Reactor.’’

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

SUMMARY

DEVELOPMENT, AND CONSTRUCTION

1. Circulating-Fuel Aircraft Reactor Experiment

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment was operated
successfully for over 100 Mw/hr. During this
time the maximum equilibrium outlet fuel tempera-
ture was 1580°F, and the maximum power level
was over 2.5 Mw. The temperature coefficient of
reactivity 2 min after the introduction of a pertur-
bation was 5.5 x 10~3, although its instantaneous
value was considerably higher. As a result, the
reactor was extremely stable while operating at
power, and there were no control problems. The
critical mass was 32.5 Ib of U23% and thus was
in reasonable agreement with the calculated
value of 30 Ib.

Operation of the process systems and their
instrumentation was exceptionally trouble-free
during the six days of operation “from the time the
‘equipment was sealed in the pits until the sodium
and the fuel were dumped.

It is believed that most of the fission-product

”

 

 

   

 

 

t
gases evolved from the liquid fuel. In a 25-hr run,
it was determined that no more than 1 part in 30 of
the xenon poison remained in the fuel.

An unexpectedly steep initial slope that was
observed in the usual plot of [1 — (1/multiplication
constant)] was found to be due to the formation of
a thermal-flux maximum near the fission chambers
as the multiplication increased. “Once ‘the ‘shape

rotary elements functioned satisfactorily.

Fuel samples were withdrawn from the ARE
during operation below criticality and at very low
power. As was anticipated, the chromium content
of the fuel increased after each addition of fuel
concentrate. Just before the first additions of fuel
concentrate were made, the chromium concentration
of the carrier material was 100 ppm and the carrier
had been circulated for 155. hr, Since the system
had been operating isothermally, the chromium
content of 100 ppm was considered to represent
0.5 mil of attack on the Inconel. By the time the
final sample was taken, after a total of 307 hr of
operation, the chromium content was 445 ppm,
which represents about 5 mils of attack. A plot
of the data obtained showed that the chromium
content of the fuel had started to level off, Since
it was not possible to sample the fuel during full
power operation, no information on mass transfer
can be obtained until the equipment can be sec-
tioned.

2. Reflector-Moderated Reactor

The reactor assembly and the installation for
the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART), formerly the
Circulating-Fuel Reactor Experiment (CFRE), have
been the subject of analytical layout and detailed
design studies. Component development tests are
proceeding as scheduled, and specifications have

been completed for radiators to be used as heat
‘dumps in heat exchanger tests.
has been done on the development of a hydraulic
ed circuit “that provides a fuel pump, a fuel expansion
‘tank, and a xenon-removal system and that performs
the various’ “functions required ‘of the system.

An analysis has been made of the activation of
the Inconel core shells that would come from two

 

 
PT

 

 

 

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

main sources: the activity of the cobalt in the
Inconel and the activity of the fission fragments
that strike the Inconel and remain there. The
analysis showed that little would be gained by
trying to obtain cobalt-free Inconel, since the
activity could not be reduced below that caused
by the fission fragments. Adjustments are being
made in the constants used in multigroup calcu-
lations in order to decrease the disparity between
the calculations and the results of critical experi-
ments.

The various types of facilities suitable for the
operation of the ART have been considered, and it
is now planned to install the reactor assembly in a
double-walled container with a water-filled annulus.
The type of container was selected after careful con-
sideration of the hazards involved in the operation
of the reactor. This typeof installation provides for
containing the products resulting from a nuclear
accident and/or chemical reaction of all combusti-
bles in the installation, minimizing the likelihood
of serious damage from an explosion caused by
sabotage or bombing, and removing and disposing
of volatile fission products evolved during the
course of operation,

3. Experimental Reactor Engineering

Progress has been made in the design and testing
of components for a horizontal, entirely enclosed
loop for insertion in an MTR beam hole. The loop
will be used to circulate proposed reactor fuels in
the MTR flux so that radiation effects on the fuel
can be studied. A layout arrangement of the loop
has been made and is being improved consistent
with specification and component changes. Tests
of two horizontal-shaft sump-type pumps were made
with the fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF, circulating at
a temperature of 1350°F for 500 and 1000 hr,
respectively, The Graphitar-lapped steel face
plates wore considerably in both tests, but they
did not fail. A single-tube salt-to-air heat ex-
changer that will fit inside the beam hole has been
fabricated.

- Sump pumps of the type used in the ARE are
being evaluated for application in large-scale heat
exchanger tests, and pumps for ART use are being
developed. One ARE-type sump pump is being
tested at K-25 for performance and life determina-
tions. The pump is operating at pump speeds of
up to 1500 rpm at a maximum capacity of 40 gpm,
and it is circulating the fluoride mixture NaF-ZrF,-
UF, at a maximum pump inlet temperature of

1350°F. Operating time now exceeds 3000 hr.
The pumps for the ART inherently possess many
imposing design problems because of the large
capacity requirements: fuel pumps, 650 gpm,
50-ft head; sodium pumps, 430 gpm, 125-ft head;
NaK pumps, 2800 gpm, 280-ft head. Investigations
of impeller cavitation characteristics and inlet
and entry conditions are being made, along with
studies of sealing, cooling, lubricating, and driving
problems.

Forced-circulation corrosion and mass transfer
tests with fused salts in Inconel systems are under
way. Considerable difficulty has been experienced
with failures of the thin-walled tubing (}-in. OD,
0.020-in. wall thickness) at bends and welded
joints. The loop design has been altered by elimi-
nation of the economizer and by using 0.045-in.-
wail tubing. One loop of the modified design is
now being operated and has accumulated about 150
hr at a Reynolds number of 10,000 and a tempera-
ture gradient of 200°F.

A third beryllium-sodium-Inconel mass transfer
test has been completed following 1000 hr of
operation. The maximum operating temperature (at
the beryllium section) was 1300°F, and the
Reynolds number was about 190,000. Another
similar loop has been fabricated and is being
assembled. A loop in which sodium will be circu-
lated in type 316 stainless steel is being fabri-
cated.

The heat exchanger test program has included a
header leak test and a series of pump tests with
an ARE moderator-coolant type of pump. The
header leak test {fuel to NaK) showed that self-
plugging of an NaF-ZrF ,-UF, fuel through 0.002-
in.-dia leaks can occur. The pump tests showed
that speeds of up to 3700 rpm could be safely
achieved with this type of pump.

Developmental work on a gas-furnace heat source
that can be used in large heat exchanger tests was
continued. A sodium-cooled 100-kw furnace was
tested for about 120 hr before a gross leak termi-
nated further operation. An output of 85 kw was
obtained at a sodium outlet design temperature of
1500°F. Two natural-gas burners, based on a
design development of the Esso Marketers, were
built and tested. Heat releases of 400 kw at
3100°F were achieved with the first burner, and
1 Mw at 3300°F was obtained with a second
burner that was improved on the basis of the data
obtained from the first burner.

A trap for fluoride vapors was developed that
canbe used in any high-temperature molten fluoride
system to prevent plugging of the gas lines leading
to or from the vessel containing the fluoride,
particularly if the salt contains ZrF,. Successful
operation of this device was achieved during the
ARE pump tests at K-25.

4. Critical Experiments

The second critical assembly of the reflector-
moderated reactor was constructed that incorporated
a beryllium island. Criticality was achieved with
4.66 kg of U235 at a density of 0.092 g of U235 pe
cubic centimeter of fuel annulus. This loading
was shown, by calibrated control rods, to contain
0.92% excess reactivity, equivalent to about 0.31
kg of U235, and therefore the critical mass of the
unpoisoned assembly was 4.35 kg of U235, The
experimental results thus did not agree well with
the calculated critical fuel loading of 7.16 kg of
U235 or 0.142 g of U235 per cubic centimeter of
fuel annulus. A series of measurements of neutron
and fission-rate distributions and of reactivity
coefficients will be made prior to the incorporation,
in the structure, of additional materials to simulate
reactor components.

temperature than would have been expected in the
absence of KF. For differential thermal analysis
of the uranium-bearing mixtures, improved graphite
containers with provision for the thermocouples to
be immersed directly in the melt are now being
used.

Investigations of the chemical reactions in
molten salts are continuing in an effort to under-
stand the mechanisms involved in the purification
of fluoride mixtures and in the reduction of UF
to UF, in fluoride melts. Similar studies of the
corrosion products of Inconel in fluoride mixtures
and of the reduction of UF, by structural metals
are under way.

Production of purified zirconium-base fluorides
mixtures has been continued on a large scale in
the 250-lb-capacity facility. It is anticipated that
by full-time operation of this facility by a crew
of one engineer and eight technicians, a sufficient
stock pile of material will be available by December
31, 1954 to allow termination of this operation for
some time. This stock pile (to be ~7000 Ib)
should be sufficient to meet the requirements of
Pratt & Whitney Aircraft, other outside requesters,
and those of the Laboratory for research in this
field.

The pilot-scale processing facility continues to
be used for small-scale development of purification
processes for new fuel compositions of interest.
Considerable effort has been expended on attempts
to prepare UF ,-bearing mixtures of NaF-LiF-KF.

6. Corrosion Research

Studies of the corrosion of Inconel, type 316
stainless steel, Hastelloy B, and several special
alloys when exposed to the fluoride mixtures of
interest were continued through the use of thermal-
convection apparatus. In the studies of Inconel
loops containing UF, in alkali-metal-base mixtures,
considerable difficulty was encountered in making
the mixtures, in controlling the total uranium con-
tent, and in determining the ratio of UF, to UF ,.
Conflicting data were obtained, and efforts are
now being made to achieve better control of the
variables involved. An alkali-metal-base mixture
containing UF, was also circulated in type 316
stainless steel loops, and, as in the Inconel loops,
considerable mass transfer occurred.

Thermal-convection loops constructed of Hastel-
loy B were operated with NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4
mole %), with NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42.0-46.5 mole %)
containing 12 wt % uranium as UF,, and with
sodium as the circulated fluids. The loops which
circulated the fluoride mixtures showed only small
amounts of corrosion — 1.5 to 3 mils, The period
of operation of the loop has not had a noticeable
effect on the corrosion; therefore it is felt that the
small amount of corrosion that occurs takes place
in a short time and may be a function of the condi-
tion of the original surface. The Hastelloy B
loops operated with sodium exhibited considerable
mass transfer. Since the loops were known to be
covered with an oxide deposit and were not cleaned
before they were filled, additional loops are to be
operated to determine whether the mass transfer
was caused by contamination. Loops constructed
of several modified Inconel-type alloys were
operated with NaF-ZrF ,-UF,. The data obtained
from these loops indicate that reduction of the
chromium content of the alloy to 5% or less greatly
reduces corrosion.

Tests of the compatibility of sodium, beryllium,
and Inconel in a system have indicated that at
1300°F the flow rate of the sodium and the spacing
_ between the beryllium and the Inconel are the con-
trolling factors. Beryllium surfaces exposed to
flowing sodium are unattacked, but surfaces ex-
posed to relatively stagnant sodium at 1300°F
show dissimilar metal mass transfer between the

beryllium and the Inconel. Tests are under way to
determine the minimum spacing that can be tolerated
between beryllium and Inconel when exposed to
slow-moving sodium.

Several type 304 stainless steel T-joints brazed
with experimental alloys prepared by the Wall
Colmonoy Corporation were tested in sodium and
in NaF-ZrF ,-UF ,. Most of the alloys had good
resistance to the fluoride mixture, but only the
10.2% P-13% Cr-76.8% Ni alloy had good resis-
tance in both sodium and the fluoride mixture.
Several T-joints of A-nickel were also brazed
with various alloys and tested in the fluoride
mixture NaF-ZrF -UF, and in sodium hydroxide.
All the alloys tested had good resistance in the
fluoride mixture, except the 69% Ni-20% Cr-11%
Si alloy, whereas all the alloys had poor resistance
to sodium hydroxide, except the 82% Au-18% Ni
alloy.

The carbides of titanium, zirconium, chromium,
and boron were corrosion tested in fused fluorides,
in sodium, and in lithium. For the most part, these
carbides showed fair resistance in the various
media, except B,C which was rather severely
attacked in sodium ond in lithium. The aqueous
corrosion resistance of an 80% Mg-20% Li alloy
which has been proposed as a crew-compartment
shielding material is being studied. Dynamic
tests of the resistance of Inconel to attack by
rubidium are under way. Preliminary results
showed maximum attack in the hot leg to a depth
of 1 mil.

Previous tests on the mass transfer character-
istics of container materials in liquid lead indi-
cated that alloys in which intermetallic-compound
formation was possible showed a marked increase
in resistance to mass transfer as compared with
the pure components of the materials. Additional
tests of this hypothesis have now been conducted.
The work on fused hydroxides has centered on the
development of a systematic chemistry of these
substances. By an application of an acid-based
theory, at least 12 types of acid-base analog
reactions are predicted for the fused hydroxide
systems. Each of these types is briefly discussed
in the text. Work on the flammability of alkali-
metal solutions at high temperatures has continued,
and additional data have been obtained for bismuth-
rich alloys with sodium which provide a more com-
plete picture of the reactivity of this system. The
effect of water vapor on the reactivity of these
alloys has also been studied.

In further chemical studies of corrosion, informa-
tion was obtained on the effect of temperatures
and of chromium additions on the corrosion of
Inconel by fluoride melts with NiF, additions.

7. Metallurgy and Ceramics

The nickel-molybdenum-base alloys are being
studied extensively as possible reactor structural
materials with qualities superior to those of Inconel.
Attempts are being made to improve the ductility
and the fabricability of commercial Hastelloy B
through purification and to find another suitable
and improved nickel-molybdenum-base alloy that
has the strength and corrosion resistance of Hastel-
loy B. The results of attempts to improve the
fabricability of the materials are being evaluated
by extrusion experiments because extruded seamless
tubing will be required if any of these alloys are
to replace Inconel as a reactor structural material.
Temperature-cycling tests in air were performed
with Hastelloy B and other nickel-molybdenum
alloys to determine the behavior to be expected in
an NaK-to-air heat exchanger such as will be
required for aircraft application. These tests have
shown that oxidation protection will be required.

Three radiator test specimens have been con-

structed of Hastelloy B for studying the fabrication

methods and for determining the thermal shock and
oxidation resistance of a complicated assembly.
The specimens contained 20 tube-to-header joints,
which were inert-arc welded by using semiautomatic
welding equipment, and 3 in. of Inconel-clad copper
fins spaced 15 fins per inch and brazed to the tube

ties.

A study of the flow of metals during an impact

to produce duplex seamless tubing that will have
good oxidation resistance on the outer surface and
good corrosion resistance on the inner surface.
Several suitable B,C-containing compositions
have been developed for the shield for the ART
heat exchanger; various nonmetallic bonding ma-
terials can be used.

Thirty-five control rods are being prepared for
the GE-ANP project that contain a mixture of 50%
aluminum powder and 50% B,C. Fuel plates are
being prepared for a study of the effect of delayed
neutrons on the over-all shield weight of circu-
tating-fuel reflector-moderator reactors,

A finned surface for a fused salt-to-air heat
exchanger being considered for use in conjunction
with an in-pile forced-circulation loop was fabri-
cated and tested for corrosion resistance to the
fused salt. The corrugated fins were formed from
0.010-in,-thick nickel sheet and were brazed to a
%-in.-OD Inconel tube with an 82% Au=18% Ni
brazing alloy. A 0.020-in.-dia nickel wire was
used as a spacer between each fin segment, and
it served to provide a capillary path for the braze
alloy, which was preplaced at the fin interlock
joint only. The braze alloy used was found to have
excellent resistance both to air and to the fused
salt.

systems were compiled, and apparatus was de-
veloped for measuring the over-all radial tempera-
ture difference (or heat transfer coefficient) for a
modified version of the flat-plate system in which
it will not be necessary to measure fluid temper-
atures,

“Several approximate mathematical temperature
solutions for forced-flow volume-heat-source en-
trance systems were developed which can be used
to predict the temperature structure of struts or
screens located in circulating-fuel reactor flow
passages. The question as to whether electric
currents, which generate heat in the circulating
fluids of experimental volume-heat-source systems,
affect the fluid flow characteristics was investi-
gated. It was found that the hydrodynamic structure
was not influenced by the presence of the electric
currents.

. The enthalpies and heat capacities of NaF-ZrF ,-
UF, (53-43-4 mole %) were determined; the heat
capacity in the solid state over the temperature
range 70 to 525°C was found to be 0,18 cal/g. °C,
and the heat capacity in the liquid state over the
temperature range 570 to 885°C was found to be
0.26 cal/g-°C. The enthalpies and heat capacities
of LiF-KF-UF , (48-48-4 mole %) were also ob-
tained; the heat capacity in the solid state over
the temperature range 125 to 465°C was found to
be 0.234 + (0.95 x 10=%)t cal/g-°C, and in the
liquid state over the temperature range 565 to
880°C it was found to be 0.657 — (3.93 x 10=4):
cal/g-°C. The viscometry equipment used earlier
was modified so that the accuracy of liquid vis-
cosity measurements was significantly increased.
The more accurate measurements obtained for
NaF-ZrF ,-UF , (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) were 30%
lower than the preliminary values reported previ-
ously. The thermal conductivity of molten NaF-
ZrF ,-UF , (53.5-40-6.5 mole %) was found to be
1.2 Btu/hrt.°F, The thermal conductivities of
the alkali fluoride mixture NaF-KF-LiF with and
without UF; were compared in the liquid and solid
states.

9. Radiation Damage

The program of MTR irradiations of Inconel
capsules containing fused fluoride fuels has been
continued, and irradiated capsules containing both
“UF ,- and UF j-bearing mixtures have been ex-
amined. There was practically no corrosion of the
irradiated UF ;-bearing capsules nor of one of the

irradiated UF ,-bearing capsules. There were no

significant differences in the iron, chromium, or

nickel contents of the irradiated fuels, as come
pared with the starting fuel batches, and there was
no evidence of segregation of either uranium or
impurities, An improved version of the capsule
irradiation facility has been put into service, and,
to speed up the program, arrangements have been
made for irradiating two capsules simultaneously
in separate, but adjacent, facilities in the MTR.
Examinations of a welded nickel capsule con-
taining a UF (-CF ,, solution that was irradiated
in the ORNL Graphite Reactor indicated the un-
suitability of the solution for use as fuel in a
mockup of a circulating-fuel reactor.

A miniature in-pile loop designed for insertion
in a vertical hole in the LITR was bench tested
and was found to be satisfactory. The bench test
included four freezing and melting cycles in 260 hr
of operation at a maximum temperature of 466°F.
Since it was possible to freeze and melt the fused
salt without causing failure of the loop, it may be
advisable to fill the in-pile loop before it is in-
serted in the reactor and then to melt the fuel
mixture after the loop is in position. A Delco
motor has been rebuilt to withstand radiation and
the high temperatures to be used for the in-pile
loop. Heat transfer calculations that predict the
thermal behavior of the loop were completed. A
second model of the loop for insertion in the LITR
is being constructed.

Plans were completed for an in-pile study of the
removal of xenon from molten fluoride fuels under
ART conditions,

The horizontal type of fuel-circulating loop
designed for irradiation in the LITR has been
operated out-of-pile with a non-uranium-bearing
salt and is now being inserted in the HB-2 facility
of the LITR. The creep-test apparatus for testing
Inconel at high temperatures in the MTR is being
bench tested. The stress-corrosion apparatus for
LITR operation has been successfully bench tested,
and an in-pile apparatus is being constructed.
Remote metallographic studies of solid fuel ele-
ments were continued, and additional information
on the relationship between UO, particle size and
radiation damage was obtained.

reactor fuels. Uranium metal is determined by
converting it fo UH, with hydrogen at 250°C, then
increasing the temperature in an atmosphere of
carbon dioxide to 400°C to decompose the hydride,
and finally measuring the volume of gas liberated
as a consequence of thermal decomposition, Under
these conditions, CO, was reduced to CO by urani-
um metal and also by UF,. A trap of 1,0, was
incorporated to oxidize CO and thus remove this
source of error.

A solution of methylene blue was found to oxidize
trivalent uranium quantitatively to the tetravalent
state without liberation of hydrogen. A procedure
in which methylene blue is used as the oxidant was
developed for the determination of trivalent uranium
in a variety of materials. The method appears to
be applicable to routine analysis.

Two other reagents, cupric chloride and titanium
tetrachloride, will, under selected conditions,
oxidize trivalent uranium to the quadrivalent state
only. The latter reagent can probably be adapted
to an automatic coulometric titration procedure for
this purpose.

Calibration of the apparatus for the determination
of oxygen as oxide in fluoride reactor fuels was
completed for quantities of oxygen up to 235
mg/liter. In this range the relationship log
k/c = Ac + Bis valid; k is the specific conduc-
tivity of water in HF, ¢ is the concentration, and
A and B are constants.

A colorimetric method was adapted for the de-
termination of sulfur as sulfate or sulfide in fluoride
salts. The sulfur is used to form methylene blue,
an intensely colored dye, for which the absorbancy
is readily measured. The method was also applied

11. Recovery and Reprocessing of Reactor Fuel

A plant for recovering (in seven batches) the
uranium from the ARE fuel and rinse by the
fluoride-volatility process is being designed, and
construction is scheduled for completion by
December 31, 1955. It is estimated that the amount
of material to be processed will be 12.4 #3 of
NaF-Z¢F ,-UF, containing 65 kg of uranium, This
plant will demonstrate, on a pilot-plant scale, the
feasibility of the fluoridesvolatility process as
applied to the processing of a circulating-fuel
aircraft reactor, The feasibility of the process has
been established on a laboratory scale. The basic
equipment, as now envisioned, will consist of a
fluorinator, an absorption column packed with NaF,
a cold-trap system, and a fluorine disposal unit,

This method of recovery and decontamination can
also be used for processing heterogeneous reactor
fuel elements of the type that can be dissolved in
fused fluoride salt by means of hydrogen fluoride,
Compactness of plant, operation at atmospheric
pressure, and economical waste disposal are some
of the advantages of this type of process.

Calculations made by the Monte Carlo method
with the use of the ORACLE were completed for
the attenuation of gamma rays in the sides of a

gamma rays in the beryllium slabs adjacent to the
gamma-ray slab source. The results of the gamma-
ray heating study are of interest for calculations of

s into s ield designs. It was
demonstrated that ‘the chart could be supplanted by

a three-parameter mathemati cal formulation which

lends considerable flexibility in the application’ of
the tolerance limits. Analyses of the Tower Shield-

ing Facility (TSF) data include a phenomenological
analysis of the behavior of ‘neutrons which leave

 

crew shield. Relatively ‘simple models are shown
to explain some of the values of scattered flux

incident on crew shield sides and rear. In ad-
dition, more detailed calculations of the TSF data
were made to estimate the fraction of scattered
radiation at the maximum altitude which is attribute
able to ground scattering. There is evidence that
for many measurements it will be about 1%, and for
highly anisotropic shields such as the GE-ANP
R-1 it will be no more than about 5%. The con-
clusion is reached that the TSF towers are high
enough for experiments applicable to high-flying
airplanes.

13. Lid Tank Shielding Facility

At the Lid Tank Shielding Facility (LTSF) the
effective neutron removal cross section for lithium
was determined as 1.01 + 0.04 barns, The meas-
urements were made in a medium of oil behind a
solid slab of lithium. The experimentation with
GE-ANP helical air ducts was continued, and
measurements have now been made beyond an array

of thirty-five 3.in.-dia ducts both in a medium of

water and in a gamma shield medium of steel
Raschig rings and borated water. The presence of
the ducts in plain water increased the thermal-
neutron flux by a factor of 300; in the gamma shield
medium the ducts increased the flux by a factor of
3000. Preparations for the reflector-moderated
reactor and shield mockup tests are being com-
pleted. It is now planned to use solid UO, as the
simulated fuel in the mockups. The UO, will be
mounted on a movable belt.

14. Bulk Shielding Facility
The Bulk Shielding Facility (BSF) was shut

down during much of the quarter for modifications

to the reactor pool. These modifications will per-
mit the use of demineralized water in the pool,
and thus they will eliminate corrosion of the
reactor fuel elements, Several BSF staff members
participated in a program to discover any short-
period isomeric gamma-ray transitions which might
be present in K39, Rb83, Rb87, and Zr 90, Measure-
ments were made at the ORNL Graphite Reactor,
and no previously unknown short-period isomers
were found in K39, Rb®3, or Rb87, Zirconium-90
yielded a 2.30 + 0.03-Mev gamma ray with a half-
life of about 0.83 * 0.03 see. This may be of
importance in design considerations for a circu-
lating-fuel reactor.

15. Tower Shielding Facility

Measurements made around the GE-ANP R-1
reactor shield in the TSF pool were compared with
similar measurements made earlier at the BSF.
The variation of the thermal-neutron intensity as
the altitudes of the mockup and TSF detector tank
were varied simultaneously was also measured.
The data indicated that ground-scattered neutrons
are still observable at the maximum altitude for
this particular reactor-shield combination. For
tests at the 195-ft altitude, lead was placed in the
rear of the detector tank to simulate the shielding
in the crew compartment, and the thermal-neutron
flux and gamma-ray dose rate distributions within
the tank were determined. This experiment was
interrupted for a period of 2% weeks so that the
TSF could participate in an Air Force Project in
which a group of monkeys were exposed to massive
neutron radiation doses.

1. CIRCULATING-FUEL AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

OPERATION OF THE AIRCRAFT REACTOR
EXPERIMENT

- The Aircraft Reactor Experiment was success-
fully operated during the quarter. Uranium in the
form of molten Na,UF, was added to the barren
carrier, NaZrF, with which the fuel system was
initially filled, to make the reactor critical. The
fuel composition at initial criticality was 52.8-
41.5-5.7 mole % (NaF-ZrF,-UF,), which has a
melting point of 990°F, whereas the final fuel
mixture (which included excess uranium) had a
composition of 53.2-40.5-6.3 mole % (NaF-ZrF,-
UF,) and a melting point of T1000°F.

ft was initially intended to remotely add the
concentrafe to the fuel system from a large tank
which contained all the concentrate, after first

‘passing it through an intermediate transfer tank.

This system was discarded when temperature-
control and continuous-weight-measuring instru-
mentation on the transfer tank proved to be un-
satisfactory. Instead, a less elaborate, but more
direct, method of concentrate addition was em-
ployed. This enrichment operation involved the
successive connection of numerous small concen-
trate containers to an intermediate transfer pot,
which was, in turn, connected to the fuel system
by a line which injected the concentrate in the
pump above the liquid level. Each of the concen-
trate containers was weighed before and after a
transfer in order to determine the amount of
uranium injected into the system. The concentrate
was supplied in batches in cans containing from
about 0.25 Ib of Na,UF, (for rod calibration) up
to about 33 |b (as was used during the first
subcritical loading). In the enrichment operation
the pump bowl served as a mixing chamber and
uniformly distributed the concentrate into the
circulating stream. (For details of the loading
operation see following subsection on ‘‘Loading
of the ARE.")

The first concentrate addition was made on

"October 30, but the reactor did not become critical

until three days later (3:45 PM, November 3).
Most of the intervening time was spent in clearing
the end of the transfer line at the pump, which,
because of limitations inherent to only this par-

ticular design, was difficult to heat and even more
difficult to service.

The approach to criticality was carefully charted
after each fuel addition. The resultant curve of
reactivity [1 — (1/multiplication constant)] as a
function of the addition of fuel (in terms of pounds
of U235 per cubic foot) is presented in Fig. 1.1.
The data from three different ionization chambers
are presented; meters Nos. 1 and 2 were fission
chambers located in the reflector, and the BF,
counter was located external to the reactor at the
mid-plane of the cylindrical side. The unique
shape of these curves (which, when first extrapo-
lated, suggested a much lower critical mass than
was actually required) is believed to be due to
the particular radial flux distribution of the reactor
at the location of the chambers and the change
in this distribution as criticality was approached.

The calculated volume of the carrier in the fuel
system (before concentrate addition) was 4.82 3.
{The only significant check on this value was

obtained from subsequent analyses of fuel samples,
together with the known amounts of concentrate
added.) While the total amount of uranium (U23%)
added to the system in order to make the reactor
critical was approximately 135 |b, because of the
amounts withdrawn from the system for samples
and in trimming the pump level, the uranium
concentration at criticality was 23.7 Ib/ft3; or,
since the calculated volume of the 1300°F core
was 1.37 ft3, the ‘‘cold,”” clean critical mass of
the reactor was 32.5 Ib of U235,

Low-Power Experiments

Several ‘‘experiments’’ were performed on the
critical reactor at low power, including reactor
power and rod calibrations. In addition, the
effects of the process system parameters on re-
activity were noted, and a preliminary measure-
ment of the temperature coefficient was under-
taken, The tests were started on the morning of
November 4 and were completed by noon on
November 8.

The regulating rod was calibrated both by the
addition of fuel and by a determination of the
resultant pile period upon withdrawing the rod

(as derived from the inhour equation). The value
of the rod was first obtained by noting the amount
of rod insertion required to maintain a constant
power level as a finite amount of fuel was added
to the system. This information, together with
a calculated value of the mass reactivity coef-
ficient (Ak/k)/(Am/m) of 0.232, permitted a de-
termination of the value of the rod. The technique
of rod calibration by pile period was also employed
both at design fuel flow (48 gpm) and with no fuel
flow. The data from each of these tests are
presented in Fig. 1.2. Although there is con-
siderable scatter, the data from the different rod
calibration techniques appear to be mutually con-
firmatory, and a rod value of 0.032 A%/in. obtained
from the data was used throughout the remainder
of the experiment. It should be noted, however,
that the period calibration with no flow is believed
to give the best data, since the inhour equation
is applicable without correction and the resultant
value of the rod is not dependent-on a reactivity
coefficient,

The reactor power was first estimated from the
fission chamber counting rate, but attempts were
made to confirm the estimate by operating the

vented by ‘operating the “pit at subatmospheric

clean reactor at a low power for a 1-hr period and
then withdrawing a fuel sample and taking a count
of the sample. This calibration was attempted
first at an estimated power of 1 w and then at
10 w. The fuel activity from the 1-whr run was
too low for an accurate count to be made, but
that from the 10-whr run indicated a power of
13.5 w. The nuclear instrumentation was cali-
brated on the basis of this power determination.
It developed later that almost all the volatile, as
well as the gaseous, fission products were ap-
parently continuously removed from the fuel at
the pump, and consequently the actual power was
probably much greater than that indicated by the
fuel sample.

“Attempts were made to measure the temperature
coefficient when the reactor was subcritical and
again during the low-power operation. In both
instances it was established that the coefficient
wds negative, and, in the latter case, it was
determined that the magnitude was approximately
5 x 10-5 Ak/°F. A more accurate determination
of the magnitude of the temperature coefficient
was deferred until the high-power runs were made.

As a part of the low-power operation, the shim
rods were calibrated in terms of the regulating
rod. Each of the three shim rods had approxi-
mately 0.15% Ak/in. for most of their 36 in. of
travel.

The reactor was finally taken fo high power

tation) at 6:20 PM, November 9, some six days
after it first became critical.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

Once high power was attained, the reactor was
operated at various power levels during the next
several days, as required, to complete the desired
tests. These tests included measurement of the
temperature coefficient of reactivity, a power cali-
bration from the process instrumentation, and a
determination of the effect of large increases in
reactivity, and they were concluded by a 25-hr
run at full power to determine whether there was
a detectable buildup of xenon.

The temperature coefficient of reactivity was
determined simply by placing the regulating rod
on the flux servo and then increasing the speed
of the blower cooling the fuel. The change of
rod position (converted into reactivity) divided by
the change in the reactor mean temperature de-
termined the reactor temperature coefficiert. The
absolute value of this coefficient was initially
quite large, and it decreased after 2 min to a
relatively constant value of —5.5 x 10~°% Ak/°F
Further analysis of the data is under way to
ascertain the precise value of the instantaneous
fuel temperature coefficient, which is, of course,
the most important characteristic affecting the
control of a power reactor. It is certain that this
coefficient was considerably larger than was ex-
pected and that the reactor was exceptionally
stable.

in this, as in any potential power reactor, the
reactor behavior as a result of large increases
in either reactivity or power demand is of par-
ticular interest. With a circulating-fuel reactor
operating to produce power, insertion of the safety
rods reduces the reactor mean temperature. The
power level, on the other hand, is controlled by

“the rate at which’ heat is withdrawn from the

circulat ing fuel. The effects of several of these
operations ¢ are illustrated’ graphically in Fig. 1.3,
“which _records the, re g inlet and outlet fuel

in about 8 min. However, by this time the reactor
mean temperature was 1380°F, and it was there-
fore decreased (to 1350°F) by inserting the shim
rods. The reactor was again brought from low
power to high power in 2 min, and after 8 min at
high power the shim rods were withdrawn to in-
crease the mean temperature. It is most sig-
nificant that during the 2-min interval required to
bring the reactor from a nominal power of 100 kw
to 2.5 Mw the shortest recorded pile period was
only 14 sec. Furthermore, when at high power,
group withdrawal of the shim rods (0.02% Ak/sec)

resulted in a pile period of only 10 sec. These

““two limiting periods were consistently repro-
ducible.

Additional insight into the behavior of the
negative temperature coefficient is also afforded
by Fig. 1.3. By time 84 min, the blower was off
and the reactor power was reduced to about
100 kw. The shim rods were then inserted to
make the reactor subcritical. At 86 min, the fuel
helium blower was turned on. The higher density

14

cooled fuel made the reactor critical, and in 2 min
a AT of about 200°F was obtained. At this time,
however, the blower speed was automatically
reduced by a low-temperature signal. The blowers
were subsequently shut off and the shims inserted.

Although the reactor power level had been cali-
brated against the activity count of a fuel sample,
the actual reactor power remained in doubt through-
out the experiment, not only because of uncertainty
regarding the retention of fission products by the
fuel but also because of discrepancies in heat
balances in the process systems, that is, heat
removed from fuel and sodium vs heat picked up
in their water heat dumps. While the causes of
these discrepancies are now being analyzed in
detail, the most reliable estimate of the reactor
power is believed to be that obtained from the
temperature differences and flows in the fuel and
sodium systems. During one typical period of
power operation, the fuel AT of 370°F at 45 gpm
accounted for more than 1.9 Mw in the fuel, while
the sodium AT of 115°F at 150 gpm accounted

for more than 0.6 Mw in the sodium, which result
in a total reactor power in excess of 2.5 Mw. The
temperature differences quoted were obtained from
the fuel pipe temperatures to and from the reactor
at the time the reactor inlet and outlet core tube
temperatures (as shown in Fig. 1.3) recorded a
AT of only 250°F. While there are several
possible phenomena which could contribute to
these low core tube temperatures (external cooling,
surface layers, radiation, etc.), there were 10 to
15 thermocouples on the inlet and outlet pipes
which gave consistent readings. The outlet pipe
temperature was at an equilibrium of 1580°F and
was in excess of 1600°F during transients.

The last scheduled experiment to be conducted
on the reactor was a measurement of the xenon
buildup during a 25-hr run at high power. The
amount of xenon buildup was observed by the
amount of regulating rod which had to be with-
drawn in order to maintain a constant power level.
However, during the 25-hr power run the regulating
rod had been withdrawn only 0.3 in., or one-
thirtieth the amount calculated on the assumption
that the xenon would remain in the fuel.

The scheduled tests were completed by 8:00 AM,
November 12. The reactor operation was then
demonstrated for all those who attended the ANP
Information Meeting on Friday, November 12.
During the 12-hr period of 8:00 AM to 8:00 PM,
the reactor power was cycled 21 times. The
resulting temperature cycling was probably as
severe as that to which an aircraft reactor would
be subjected. At 8:00 PM, November 12, with
the scheduled experimental program completed and
over 100° Mwhr of operation logged, the reactor
was made subcritical, but circulation of the fuel
and sodium was continued. The following morning,
the fuel and. then the “sodium were dumped into
their respective dump. tanks.

Mathematical Analysis of Approach t to Critical

W. E. Kinney

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

When the ARE ‘was brought to critical by we
cessive fuel ‘additions, it was observed that the
usual plot of 0 - (1/multiplication constant)] vs
‘Uranium concentration “increased, at first, very
rapidly, but, when the curve got close to 1, the

is observed in many reactors, but the ARE ex-
hibited the effect to an unusual degree. In order

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

to explain this, the ORACLE three-group, three:
region code was modified so that flux shapes at
successive fuel additions could be calculated.
Group constants were obtained by flux weighting
with fluxes from an Eyewash calculation on the

ARE.

Figure 1.4 shows the space distribution of the
thermal flux for no fuel and for runs 2 through 6.
The effect of the reflector as fission neutrons
become more numerous can be seen. Figure 1.5
compares experimental and calculated startup
curves for the fission chambers which were
located in the reflector as indicated in Fig. 1.4.
In the calculation,

where m is the multiplication constant, CR, is
the counting rate on run j, and CR; is the counting
rate with no fuel. It seems, then, that the unex-
pected, rapid initial rise in the counting rate of
the fission chamber and the {1 ~ (1/m)] curve is
due not only to the general rise in flux level but
also to the formation of the thermal-flux maximum
near the fission chambers. Once the shape of
spatial distribution of the thermal neutron flux
is set up, the fission chambers register only the
general increase in flux level and the count rate
increases slowly,

a gas nozzle antiplugging device on the fuel pump
tank to reduce the zirconium fluoride vapor-
condensate plugging problem, and a functional
check and setting of low-flow alarms on water
and lubricating oil systems.

After about 24 hr of hot prenuclear operation,
some noises from the bearing housing of the main

5 fuel pump were noted. This disturbance was first
“heard on the crystal noise pickups. After many

  

increases and decreases in intensity, the noise
finally subsided, and the bearing housing per-
formed quietly during the sealed pit operation.
No detectable increase in drive-motor power oc-
curred during the time the noises were heard.

During the filling of the fuel system and sub-

sequent nuclear operation, there was some leakage
from the gas space of the main fuel pump tank.
This pump tank served as a fluid expansion and

degassing chamber, as well as the pump sump

tank. The gas leakage may have been associated
with any or all compression joints (spark plug
probes, Swagelok fittings), with any welded gas
flange seal, or with the two compression joints
in the rotary element.

The water and the lubricating oil auxiliary
systems on all four pumps (including two standby
pumps) functioned without incident during the
entire experiment. The seal gas-balancing systems
on the pumps also functioned without incident.

system) functioned satisfactorily, The maximum
level probe in the main sodium pump tank shorted
occasionally, but it subsequently cleared. Appli-
cation of the *‘short burner’ (high current source
to separate accumulated condensate from the
probe) had no effect. The maximum operating
level probe in the main fuel pump tank shorted

several times during early stages of hot operation,

Each time, the short was cleared instantaneously
by use of the short burner. After approximately
five such occurrences, the circuit was arranged

for continuous burning, and no further indication

of shorting appeared.

The pump power-transmitting V-belts functioned
satisfactorily during the entire experiment. The
effect of radiation damage upon the belts may be
determined upon inspection.

"The power traces indicated good operation of
the pumps under load. The voltage regulation
of the pump motor supply (an a-c~d-c motor gener-
ator set) became somewhat unsteady with passage
of time. This unsteadiness of voltage regulation
could be seen in pump speed and motor current
indications.

The pump tachometer generators performed well
after some initial troubles were corrected. The
tachometer generator on the main fuel and main
sodium pumps failed during the prenuclear hot
operation. These failures, it is believed, can
be traced to improper fit-up of the generator shaft
into inner races of ball bearings and, possibly,
to excessive tension on the V-belt.

Indications were that the ambient temperature
was approximately 175°F in the pump region
during the nuclear and power runs. This is the
highest ambient temperature fo which ARE pumps
have been subjected, but the rotary elements
functioned satisfactorily at this temperature. The
lubricating oil and the water temperatures were
maintained at about the values experienced during
hot shakedown development and acceptance
testing. :

The vapor trap installed in the main fuel pump of
the ARE system was used successfully during the
enrichment procedure. Several hundred cubic feet
of gas was vented through it. The heated line
and trap were still open at the termination of the
experiment. A report on the vapor trap design

Final ‘preparations “and installations for the

loading of the ARE were completed during the
month of October. _ Transfer of the barren carrier
(NaF - ZF, 50-50 mole %) into the ARE fill tank
No. 2 was completed in approximately 43 hr
without incident. Approximately 2750 Ib of carrier

as loaded into the fill tank, and sufficient
: wetorial was on hand to fill the fuel system to
its operating liquid level.

The enriched fuel storage tank had previously
been loaded with 60 Ib of carrier material for
practice injections info the reactor. Tests indi-
cated that the semiautomatic enrichment system
was inadequately heated, and therefore equipment
for addition of portions of the fuel concentrate
(Na,UF) directly to the circulating fuel pump
was designed and assembled.

In order to provide adequate means for ap-
proaching criticality safely, some of the original
30-1b batches of concentrate were reduced to
10-Ib batches, and, similarly, to provide accurate
measurements for calibration of the control rods
after criticality, 12 small batches of approximately
0.5-Ib size were prepared from a 30-1b batch.

The injection system consisted of a main con-
centrate can (containing 30, 10, or 0.5 Ib as
required) connected to an intermediate transfer
can by a resistance-heated Y-in. Inconel tube.
The intermediate transfer can was designed so
that it could be filled to a predetermined level
(approximately 5.5 1b) when the 10- or 30-ib
batches were in position to be transferred. The
0.5-Ib batches were transferred through a smaller
intermediate can, which contained the entire small
batch each time of transfer. The intermediate can
was, in turn, connected to the fuel pump. The
main transfer line to the pump was heated by
“calrod units, while the nozzle within the pump

18

was heated by resistance heating. The close
tolerances of the injection nozzle resulted in an
inherent tendency to short out and cause the
nozzle tip to be cold. "This, coupled with the
drainage of high-melting-point material from the
long transfer line, always presented the possi-
bility of a frozen-fluoride plug.

The first 30 !b of concentrate was injected into
the fuel pump without apparent difficulty. After
this injection, however, difficulties in the form

of line plugs and venting troubles frequently
occurred.

After 48 hr, most of these problems
were under control, and loading of the enriched
concentrate proceeded smoothly. The reactor was
brought to criticality, and small injections of
0.5-1b batches were made for the control rod
calibrations. At the completion of the final small
addition, the transfer line broke and simultane-
ously plugged af the injection nozzle, Efforts to
repair the damage were fruitless, and the final
injection of 30 Ib of the concentrate to allow ARE
operation at power was made through the sample
line into the pump.

ANALYSIS OF LEAK IN SODIUM SYSTEM

E. E. Hoffman W. H. Cook
C. F. Leitten
Metallurgy Division

The sodium system of the ARE was filled
initially on September 26, 1954, but the sodium
had to be dumped on September 27 because of a
leak at a tube bend in the sodium purification
system. The section of austenitic stainless steel
pipe in which the leak occurred was located just
ahead of the filter traps. The system had been
filled with sodium for 37 hr and had reached a
maximum temperature of approximately 1150°F
before the leak was detected. A portion of the
section removed and the location of the leak are
shown in Fig. 1.6. The leak occurred where a
metal thermocouple protection tube had been at-
tached to the stainless steel pipe by Heliarc
welding. The attack around the weld was due to
the formation of sodium oxide as the sodium
leaked through the weld. The inside of the pipe
at the weld may be seen in Fig. 1.7. An ex-
cessive amount of penetration was obtained during
the welding operation. The large weld nugget
cracked during cooling after welding. A cross
section of the weld crack is shown in Fig. 1.8.
Examination of the pipe in this section revealed

Samples were withdrawn by pressurizing the pump
bowl sufficiently to cause flow through a heated
Inconel tube into a sampling device, which was
constructed to allow line flushing before col-
lection of the sample.

Analyses of the samples were carried out by
the ANP Analytical Chemistry Group and are
shown in Table 1.1. As may be seen, the
chromium content of the fuel was essentially
constant at 100 ppm after 155 hr of circulation
of the fuel carrier through the reactor. If corrosion
of the Inconel is assumed to have been uniform
over the surface of the system — and since it was
operating’ isothermally during this period, such
an assumption is reasonable — the chromium con-
centration of 100 ppm would represent about 0.5

mil of attack on the Inconel.

As was anticipated, the chromium content of
the melt was found to increase a few hours after
each addition of fuel concentrate (Na,UF,). By
the time the final sample was taken, after 307 hr
of molten fluoride circulation, the chromium con-
tent was found to be 445 ppm. Again, if a uniform
rate of attack of the Inconel is assumed and if
the removal of circulated material from the system
during this time (to maintain desired pump liquid
level) is taken into account, this chromium content
would represent about 5 mils of attack on the
Inconel system. If the data in Table 1.1 are
plotted as chromium content vs time, it is seen
that the chromium content had begun to level off
by the time the final sample was taken. A pro-
jection of the slope of the chromium curve indi-
cates a maximum chromium concentration of about
600 ppm after several hundred hours of operation.

There is no doubt that mass transfer of chromium
metal began soon after power operation started,
since there were then large temperature differ-
entials across portions of the system. Sampling
was not possible at this time and could not, of
course, have given information on mass transfer.
Heat transfer characteristics of the ARE did not
appear to have changed during its 150 Mwhr of
operation, and so whatever mass transfer occurred
was unimportant. Details of mass transfer will
be studied when sectioning of the equipment
becomes possible.

fuge cup integrally mounted on the back of each
fuel pump impeller for degassing the processed
fuel, pumping the processed fuel back into the
main system, and providing a seal for the fuel

Several Lucite models that differ in component
design and circuit arrangement have been built and
tested, and they have led to the design illustrated
in Fig. 2.1. In this model the swirl chamber is
mounted between the two fuel pumps and raised
above the centrifuge cups to assure their priming
under starting conditions, The swirl in the
chamber is produced in two ways: by nozzles lo-
cated in the swirl chamber floor and by swirl
pumps which are needed to maintain a high swirl
velocity when the fuel level rises above the 25%
full condition owing to thermal expansion in the
main system, The nozzles and swirl pumps are
arranged to deliver high-velocity fuel jets tangenti-
ally at the periphery of the swirl chamber to give
good agitation and to assure a strong centrifugal
field and a stable free surface.

The nozzles serve both to meter the bleed flow
through the expansion tank and to control the fuel
pump suction pressure relative to the swirl chamber
This important function is perhaps
more evident in the schematic circuit analog pre-
sented in Fig. 2.2. By tracing the bleed flow, it

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

The addition of the swirl pump made it neces-
sary, however, to replace the slinger ring, previ-
ously employed, with a slinger impeller in order
to buck any leakage from the swirl pump. Although
the complete assembly has not yet been tested in
an inverted position, the slinger impeller seems to
be very effective. A similar arrangement is now
being tried as a means of controlling the leakage
from the main pump discharge through the clearance
between the impeller and the casing past the
centrifuge. More conventional sealing arrange-
ments ‘were found to be ineffective because of the
abnormally large radial clearances (0.060 in.)
specified in the design objectives. Initial tests
currently in progress with the centrifuge seal
impeller have been quite promising. Although no
detailed studies of the off-gas system and fuel
pill addition system have been made, the changes
in the xenon-removal system will make it neces-
sary that the off-gas system connection and the
fuel pill addition be made through the swirl
chamber rather than through the pump housing as
illustrated previously.’

CONTROL ROD DESIGN CONSIDERATIONS

The design of the ART has been predicated on
the belief that no fast-moving control rods will be
required because of the inherent stability of the
reactor that will arise from the strong negative
temperature coefficient of the circulating fuel.
It is further expected that only about 1% Ak/k
will be required to compensate for xenon poisoning,
since it is anticipated that with the bypass ex-
pansion tank and gas-scrubbing system planned,
the xenon will be removed almost as rapidly as it
is formed. It is expected that compensation for
burnup and the accumulation of fission-product
poisons can be effected by adding pills of solid
fuel having a high percentage of U235, Thus the
principal function of the control rod will be to
control the mean temperature level of the reactor
fuel. Since the temperature coefficient will
probably be approximately 5 x 10=3 Ak/k per °C
and since a temperature level variation of the
order of 150°C will probably be required, provision
of a Ak/k of 1% in the control rod for temperature
level control should be more than adequate. "
reviewing the various requirements for control,
thus follows that a control rod having a total . cf

of 2% should prove to'be adequate. This reactivity

canbe readily incorporated in a single slow-moving
control rod. It would seem entirely adequate to
move this control rod at a rate of 1% Ak/k per
minute, a slow and conservative value.

The size and stroke of the rod are important
considerations. Two items of experimental data
are available to indicate the size of the rod re-
quired. In the course of the second reflector-
moderated reactor critical experiment (that making
use of powdered fuel placed inside 1%-in.-square
aluminum tubes), it was found that with an 18-in.-
dia core and a 9-in.-dia island a control rod
effectiveness of about 0.6% Ak/k was obtained
from a % ¢in.-0D stainless steel tube filled with
powdered boron to a density of about 50% and
inserted in one-half of the critical experiment
assembly. A second indication of the effective-
ness of control rod material is available in that a
piece of gadolinium oxide approximately the
diameter and thickness of a 25-cent piece was in-
serted at the center of the island in the three-
region octahedron critical assembly (without core
shells). The value of this gadolinium oxide wafer
was found to be approximately 0.2% Ak/k. Some
additional data are also available from multigroup
calculations. All these data seem to indicate that
a rod approximately ¥ to % in. in diameter having
a stroke of approximately %0 in., about 7% in, of
which would be below the equator, should prove
adequate to give a Ak/k of 2%.

The heat generation to be expected in the con-
trol rod will establish the amount of cooling that
will be required and, to a large degree, much of
the detail design of the rod. The heat generation,
in turn, is dependent, in part, on the number of
neutrons absorbed in the rod at full power. Multi-
group calculations indicate that 1.3% of the
neutrons produced will be absorbed in a control
rod having a Ak/k of 1%, if it is assumed that the
average effectiveness of the control rod is half
that of the portion at the center of the island.
Thus a control rod having an effectiveness of 2%
Ak/k would, when in the ‘full in’’ position, absorb
2.6% of the neutrons. If a value of 3 Mev per
neutron absorbed is assumed, the energy associated
with neutron absorption in the control rod would
amount to 0.039% of the total power generated in the
reactor. This would total 24 kw for a 60-Mw power
level. The control rod cooling requirement would
be a minimum if gadolinium rather than boron were
used as the absorbing material in the rod. This

} cooled walls of the 1 thimble.

 

Co ‘walled thimble,

would mean that most of the energy associated
with the hard capture gammas emitted from the
gadolinium would appear as heat in the surrounding
moderating material rather than in the gadolinium.
Thus a gadolinium rod would have the advantage
that relatively little of the heat associated with
neutron captures in the rod would appear in the
rod, and therefore little provision for cooling
would be required. On the other hand, if boron
were used, the very short range alpha emitted
from neutron captures in boron would cause
virtually all’ the energy associated with the
neutron capture to appear in the boron,
"The principal heating in a gadolinium rod would
be that induced by gammas from the fuel region.
For a 60-Mw reactor it appears that the power
density in the gadolinium from this source would
Estimates indicate
that about 20 cm® of gadolinium would be re-
quired. The total power generation in the rod
from gammas from the fuel region would amount to
approximately 400 w, or about one-sixtieth the
power generation in a boron rod. It should be
noted that gadolinium oxide is available at a cost
of about $4000/1b and that it can be fabricated
readily by using conventional ceramic techniques.
Cooling of the rod presents quite a number of
problems. If the rod were immersed in flowing
sodium, cooling would present no problem. How-
ever, the control rod actuating mechanism would
have to operate, to some degree at least, in
sodium, and self-welding might present some
difficult problems. If the rod were placed in a
thimble in the center of the core and an atmosphere
of helium were maintained in the thimble, it might

be possible to effect “cooling through ‘radiation or.

mechanism could include a heat exchanger so that
the heat would be removed from the circulating
helium and transmitted to the shield water. Un-
fortunately, such a system would be dependent on
the satisfactory operation of quite a number of
moving parts, always a likely source of trouble.

FILL AND DRAIN SYSTEM

A good, reliable, relatively simple fill-and-drain
system incorporating a quick disconnect coupling
suitable for remote operation with high-temperature
liquid systems is clearly needed. In the design of
the ARE, fixed tanks with remotely operated valves
were used in order to avoid a remotely operated
coupling. This approach led to a quite complicated
collection of tanks, plumbing, and valves, and to
somewhat clumsy arrangements for system drainage.

The requirements of such a system are fairly
straightforward. In the first place, a good coupling
that can be operated remotely and that will be
dependably pressure-tight is required. This
coupling must be relatively insensitive to align-
ment both as to concentricity and to parallelism
of the axes of the mating flanges or surfaces. A
reliable pressure-tight valve on either side of the
coupling must be provided so that, after the
coupling has been made, the space between the
valves can be evacuated and then purged with
helium. The valves on either side of the coupling
can then be opened and the filling or draining
operation carried out. Upon completion of the
operation, the upper valve can be closed and the
space between the valves cleared of liquid by
several short blasts of helium, The lower valve
can then be closed and the coupling broken.

N Scavenging the space between the valves is very

reactor fuel systems because it is essential that
the exact amount of fuel in the reactor be known
at all times. One good way of measuring the
quantity of liquid in the tank would be to support
the tank on two Hagan Thrustorq units. This
should give an instantaneous measure of the weight
of the tank to an accuracy of 1% of full-scale
reading.

Design work is under way on a system to fill the
above-specified requirements. Complete tests of
mockups of proposed designs will be made before
the final design is chosen.

DESIGN PHYSICS

W. K. Ergen
Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

"The comparison between multigroup calculations
and critical ‘experiments on three-region reflector-
moderated reactors has shown a certain amount of
discrepancy, which must be overcome by adjusting
the constants used in the calculations. Investi-
gations were made with the ultimate aim of ob-
taining simpler expressions for the critical mass
and power distribution for reflector-moderated
reactors. This was done in the hope that these
simpler expressions could be fitted to the experi-
ments by adjusting of constants and that this
fitting might be as satisfactory as the one employed
for the multigroup calculations. The three-group
ORACLE calculations of the approach to criti-
cality of the ARE (see Sec. 1) gave a satisfactory
explanation of the strange results observed during
the experiment. An example of the calculations
performed for the ART is the following calculation
of the activation of the Inconel core shells.

Activation of the Inconel Cote Shells
"H. W. Bertini

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

An attempt was made to estimate the activity of
the Inconel core shells on the inside of a 60-Mw
reflector-moderated reactor after the reactor had
been operating for 1000 hr. The activity will
come from two main sources: the activity of the
cobalt in the Inconel and the activity of the fission

26

fragments that strike the Inconel and remain there.

The method described below for obtaining the
estimate gives an order of magnitude of the total
activity. Reasonable approximations are used to
simplify the calculations, and, in this way, many
of the details that a more complete analysis would
require are circumvented, and yet the required
accuracy of the calculations is maintained.

To obtain the activity due to the cobalt, the
total flux at the surface of the Inconel is obtained.
This flux is multiplied by the product of the
microscopic cross section of cobalt times the total
number of cobalt atoms in the core shells. This
gives the total number of cobalt atoms being
activated per second. Multiplication of this
number by 1000 hr gives the total number of cobalt
atoms activated during the reactor lifetime. Since
the half life of cobalt is so long (5 years) com-
pared with the reactor lifetime, the decay of the
excited cobalt atoms can be assumed to be con-
stant, and therefore the disintegration rate can be
taken as AN, where A is the decay constant of
cobalt, and N is the total number of cobalt atoms
activated during the lifetime of the reactor.

The following values were used for the calcula-
tions:

Reactor power = 6 X 107 w

Total mass of U235 in the core = 2.5 x 104 g
Density of Inconel = 8 g/cm

Weight per cent of cobalt in the Inconel = 0.1%
Half life of cobalt = 5 years

Average flux at the surface of the reactor,
bq = 2 x Preactor

of = 550 barns

oSe = 35 barns

The total mass of Inconel in the core shells of
the reactor is approximated by the mass of two
spherical Inconel shells, one with a 15-cm radius
and the other with a 25-cm radius, each shell
being 0.3 cm thick. Then,

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

In calculating the activity of the fission frag-
ments, use is made of Fig. 2 in ORNL-53,% which
is a curve of the dose from a uranium slug exposed
for three years plotted against time after exposure.
The dose is given in mr/hr at 1 meter per watt of
exposure,

Calculations now show that 1 curie of 2-Mev

gammas gives a dose of approximately 1 r/he at
1 meter. If it is assumed that the average energy
of the decay gammas from the fission fragments
is 2 Mev (an overestimate), the cutve can be used
to obtain an estimate of the curies of activity for
any time after exposure. However, it is first
necessary to calculate the watts of exposure in
the regions of the reactor close enough to the
Inconel core shells so that the fragments due to
fissions will strike the Inconel. This is done by
finding the range, R, of the fission fragments in
the fuel and again approximating the fuel annulus
by a spherical shell of 25 em OD and 15 cm ID
“to find the total power generated in the regions
adjacent to the Inconel. This power is divided
by 2 to account for the fact that approximately
one-half the fission fragments generated in this
region will impinge on the shells. Since the curve
was plotted for a slug exposed for three years,
any ‘values obtained by using this curve will be
overestimates of the fission fragment activity of
a 60-Mw reflector-moderated reactor.

The range of fission fragments is estimated to

be 0.001 cm, and the

The last factor of 2 in the above equation is due
to the flux at the surface of the Inconel being
twice that of the average flux. Some values of
the total activation of the Inconel core shells
obtained by using the above methods are given in
Table 2.1. One conclusion to be drawn from
Table 2.1 is that little would be gained by trying
to obtain special Inconel with especially low
cobalt content; the activity could not be reduced
below that caused by the fission fragments.

Mathematical Models for Reflector-Moderated
Reactors

L.. T. Anderson, Consultant

The thermal absorption rate has been calculated
for an idealized reactor consisting of a nonmoder-
ating spherical-shell fuel region surrounding a
moderator and surrounded by an infinite moderating
reflector with a fission source of 1 neutron/sec
in the fuel region. The thermal capture cross
section of the fuel region was taken to be infinite.
The nonthermal capture cross section of the fuel
region was assumed to be zero, and the thermal
and nonthermal absorption cross sections of the
moderator were likewise assumed to be infinitely
small. The neutrons slowed down according to age
theory, and the thermal neutrons diffused according
to diffusion theory.

The absorption rate is, for the source located at
the inner radius of the fuel region,

PROPOSED ART INSTALLATIONS
A. P. Fraas F. R. McQuilkin

Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

A study has been made of the various types of
facilities suitable for the operation of the Aircraft
Reactor Test. In addition to the obvious require-
ments for shielding, heat dumps, and auxiliary
equipment, it is essential from the hazards stand-
point that provision be made to contain the
products resulting from a nuclear accident and/or
chemical reaction of all combustibles in the
installation, minimize the likelihood of serious
damage from an explosion caused by sabotage or
bombing, and remove and dispose of volatile
fission products evolved during the course of
operation, With these criteria in mind, a series
of four basic reactor installations was considered;
each differed in some fundamental characteristics
from the others. The four installations are as
follows: (1) an open test unit mounted over a
water-cooled pan at the National Reactor Testing
Station (NRTS), (2) a circular Quonset type of
hemispherical building, (3) a water-walled tank,
and (4) a reactor submerged in a pool of water,

Each of the installations included five major
components: a shielded reactor assembly, radi-
ators, blowers, a control system, and a fill-and-
drain system. These components would operate

29

as an integrated system, irrespective of the type
of test installation chosen. In all but the fourth
installation, the assembled reactor would be sur-
rounded by an aircraft type of shield of lead and
borated water, and, in all installations, it would
be coupled to heat dumps consisting of banks of
aircraft-type NaK-to-air radiators through which
cooling air would be circulated. Appropriate con-
_frol systems, along with auxiliary shielding, equip-
.ment, and services, would comprise the balance of
. the test installation. A generalized flow sheet for
this setup was shown in Fig. 2.1 of the previous
"quarterly progress report.”

All but the first of the above-listed installations
would be located in Oak Ridge. The first installa-
tion is illustrated in Fig. 2.4. It was devised to
permit operation of the reactor surrounded by an
aircraft-type shield with a heat dump on either side

“to simulate the turbojet engines. Of the installa-
tions considered, it offers the most compact
arrangement of the equipment with the least amount
of shielding and minimum provision for contain-
ment, This scheme was developed with the thought
that it could be built in Oak Ridge so that all the
welding of high-temperature-liquid piping could be
made, inspected, and pressure tested and some
preliminary testing carried out, probably including
a hot critical experiment, before the unit was
shipped to NRTS., The dimensions of the unit are
such that it would fit on a flat car and comply
with standard railroad side and overhead clearance
regulations. To do this, it would be necessary to
dismount certain elements, such as the pump drive
motors, the blowers, and the blower drive motors.
This could be done easily, since only bolted con-
nections would be involved, The reactor would be
‘set up with a heavy, water-cooled pan beneath it,

“This pan would catch, hold, and cool the fuel in
‘the event of an accident. A control room would be
built as a unit and shipped to NRTS on a second
flat car. The contrsl room and the reactor would
‘probably be placed a quarter of a mile to a mile
apart, and the two would be coupled by telemetering

equipment, The pumps in the layout are shown as

“being driven by d-c electric motors, but air turbine
motors would serve equally well if a source of
"compressed air were available. [f the tests were
run at NRTS and Air Force, portable, gas-turbine-
. type air compressors were used, a compressed air

source might be more easily arranged than a d-c
generator set,

In examining the NRTS installation design, a
number of points became evident. First, the prob-
lems associated with operating a reactor at NRTS
seem to be rather serious, particularly from the
standpoint of the amount of time that would be
lost in maintaining an operation 2000 miles from
Oak Ridge. The distance would make it particu-
larly difficult to cope with unforseen problems.
Any relatively small "difficulty that might arise
would be likely to introduce a major delay if that
difficulty were not forseen. It appears therefore
that an NRTS installation would entail a loss of at
least six months in getting the reactor into opera-
tion. The second major point that developed in
connection with the examination of the design was
that the major hazards appeared to be much less
serious than had originally been presumed. The
very compact installation achieved through careful
design directed toward simulation of a full-scale
aircraft type of power plant ted to a very low in-
vestment of sodium and NaK, about one-twentieth
of that required for the KAPL-SIR reactor designed
for the same power level. Further, the use of
circulating fuel with its high negative temperature
coefficient gives a reactor in which a nuclear
explosion seems almost out of the question.

In view of the relatively small amounts of energy
released under conditions of a total reactor tragedy,
designs were prepared for the installation of the
ART in a closed building. The layout shown in
Fig. 2.5 envisions a sort of circular Quonset
building about 200 ft in diameter. The test unit
would be built and operated on the test floor
behind supplementary shielding, and a heavy,
water-cooled pan would be placed beneath the
reactor, This pan would catch, hold, and cool the
fuel in the event of an accident. Such an arrange-
ment would give plenty of floor area in a relatively
inexpensive building that could be sealed to con-
tain any fission products that might be released,
in line with the philosophy underlying the use of
the Hortonsphere at KAPL. A similar type of
building, but shaped as a hemisphere rather than
as the circular Quonset building, might be used
in order to reduce the amount of steel required in
the framing of the building.

The arrangement shown in Fig. 2.6 follows a
quite different philosophy. It provides for con-
taining the reactor assembly within a pressure

tank would be shielded fairly well, and it would
be possible for aman to enter the inner tank through
a manhole at the top for inspection or repair work,
even after the tank had been closed and the ve-

actor had been run at high power, The water

capacity of the space between the tanks, together

with the water in the reservoir above the inner

tank (approximately 10 ft deep), would be of the
order of 110,000 gal, Boiling of this water would
suffice to carry off all the heat generated by the
fission products for about two days without any
fresh water being supplied to the outer tank. All
the various wires, pipes, tubes, etc, connected to
the reactor and its auxiliaries would pass through
carefully laid-out junction panels such as the one
shown in Fig. 2.7. Such a panel might be installed
in the wall of the tank shown in Fig. 2.6 with a
pressure-tight gasketed flanged junction. The
various thermocouples, power wiring, etc. could be
installed on the reactor assembly in the shop and
fitted with Cannon plugs so that they could be
plugged into the panel in a short period of time
after the reactor assembly had been lowered into
position in the test facility. This should minimize
the amount of assembly work required in the field.

The layout investigated as the fourth proposed
installation would involve placing the reactor in-
side a sort of swimming pool with water-tight
thermal insulation surrounding the pressure shell,
lines, and pumps. The lines could then be brought
out the top of the water tank to the instruments
and the heat dumps. In the event of a severe
accident that resulted in a meltdown, there would
be sufficient heat capacity in the water to absorb
the heat from the fission products for some days
before a seriously large amount of water would
have been boiled out of the pool. Such an arrange-
ment could be enclosed, of course, in an air-tight
building. This might not be necessary, but it
seems likely that, in the event of an abrupt melt-
down type of failure, the high heat capacity of the
region inside the thermal insulation might put so
much heat into the water in a very short period of

‘time that bubbles would boil violently to the
"surface and disperse entrained fission products.

After, perhaps, 10 or 15 min, it seems unlikely
that such entrainment would prove to be a problem,

The unshielded reactor assembly will weigh
approximately 10,000 1b, the lead gamma shield
approximately 30,000 Ib, and the water in the
shield approximately 34,000 Ib. The first two of

34

these items could be handled conveniently with a
20-ton crane, while the borated water could be

pumped i in after the rubber tanks had been n installed

for the water shield.’ :

An arrangement such as ‘the double-walled ‘tank
shown in Fig. 2.6 should prove to be adequate fo
take care of any accident not involving sabotage
or bombing, The same should be true for either
the hemispherical or circular Quonset type of
building. Only the NRTS installation would, be-
cause of the remote location, present a not- -too-
serious hazards problem if effectively sabotaged.

To evaluate the merits of each of the ‘installa-
tions considered, an attempt was made to envision
as many accidents as possible that might prove to
be serious during the course of operation of the
ART. The worst natural accident that could be
envisioned would result in a meltdown, The only
source of an explosion that has been envisioned
would be either sabotage or bombing. If the
volatile fission products are removed during the
course of operation, the major hazard to the sur-
rounding area would be from the fission products
that might be dispersed in the course of violent
boiling or from an explosion.

Although in the preliminary hazards analysis
consideration was given to operational hazards,
operational sabotage, fire, earthquake, flood,
windstorm, and bombing, the controlling considera-
tions appeared, to be those associated with a total
reactor tragedy. The total reactor tragedy is con-
sidered here as being an accident in which all the
heat that could possibly be released from the
chemical combination of various materials in the
reactor and associated system would be released,
together with the heat from the fission products
accumulated after extended operation at full power
and the energy released in an extreme nuclear
runaway. The principal hazard associated with an
ultimate reactor catastrophe is the dispersion of
the fission products that would have accumulated
from extended operation at high power, The key
data on these parameters are presented in Table
2.2,

In examining the data on the heat that could be
released from the combustion of various materials
in the reactor installation, it is immediately evi-
dent that if kerosene or another hydrocarbon were
used in place of water in the shield a very large
amount of heat could be released, an amount almost
one hundred times greater than that from any other

source of energy. The heat that could be released
from the combustion of the sodium and the NaK in
the moderator and heat dump circuit is relatively
small; thus it seems that water should be used as
the shielding material rather than kerosene, be-
cause, even if the water were to combine in stoi-
chiometric proportions with all the sodium and the
NaK in the system, the resulting energy would
still not present a difficult problem. The heat
that would be released from a nuclear accident
depends in large measure on the character of the
accident. However, the value presented in Table
2.2 is that for the worst accident that can be

36

envisioned, that is, one in which uranium abruptly
begins to precipitate out of the fuel in the core so
that the fuel is carried into the core at the normal
rate but no uranium leaves with the exit stream of
fluoride. While hardly a credible accident, this
does seem to represent the maximum rate of in-
crease in reactivity and, hence, the extreme nuclear
accident conceivable for this reactor,

The second portion of Table 2.2 presents the
equivalent radiation sources for the various fluid
circuits. The values given for the sodium and NaK
activities have been obtained from multigroup
calculations.

It should be noted that the presence of the shield
water would provide a strong damping effect on any
temperature rise associated with an accident. The
third part of Table 2.2 shows the temperature rise
associated with the release of energy from the
various sources for various conditions, As shown
in the table, if all the heat from the combustion
reactions were to be confined in the combustion
products, high temperatures would result from
stoichiometric reactions. Even in such instances,
much of the heat would be dissipated to the atmos-
phere within the containing vessel so that the
temperature would be substantially lowered, If
the reaction were quenched by the shield water,
still lower temperatures would result,

It is clearly essential that provision be made to
contain the products of a total reactor tragedy
except, possibly, if the reactor is installed at
NRTS. A comparison of key data for several types
of container is given in Table 2.3, For this com-
parison the worst set of conditions applicable to
each case was presumed. As may be seen, the
double-walled tank compares favorably with the
hemispherical and ellipsoidal buildings. While
difficult to evaluate numerically, the double-walled
tank also appears superior in that it would be less
subject to sabotage. Even if both walls were
ruptured and the reactor melted down, the residue
would tend to sink to the bottom of the tank pit,

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

where it would be flooded by the water that had
filled the region between the walls. This water
would both absorb the heat of any reaction and act
as a shield to reduce the radiation level at the top
of the pit. After careful review of these and a host
of lesser considerations, the 24-ft-dia double-walled
tank was chosen as the most promising test facility.

Although the double-walled tank type of test
installation is adaptable to several types of reactor
test facility, the most promising possibility is to
install it in an addition to the ARE Building. Such
an arrangement would permit the use of services
and facilities that already exist in the ARE Build-
ing, for which no plans have been formulated now
that it has served its original purpose. For ex-
ample, items such as the control room, offices,
change rooms, toilets, storage area, water supply,
power supply, portions of experimental test pits,
access roads, security fencing, and security lighting
are available,

Of the several schemes considered for modifying
the ARE Building to accommodate the ART, the

‘most attractive plan is to construct an addition on

the south end to effect a 64-ft extension of the
present 105-ft-long building by extending the ex-
isting roof and side walls. Figure 2.8 shows a
preliminary design. The floor level of the addition
would be at the ARE basement floor grade, with
the double-walled tank to house the ART sunk in

the floor up to 3 ft below the bolting flange level.
The reactor tank location would be approximately
centered in the 42-ft-wide, 64-ft-long high-bay ex-
tension directly in line with the ARE experimental
bay, The reactor would be positioned so that the
top of the shield would be at the building floor
elevation,

To permit use of the experimental pits for instal-
lation of auxiliary equipment, to permit possible
underwater reactor disassembly work after reactor
operation, and to provide a large entry door to the
ART areaq, the south wall of the ARE experimental
bay would be removed, the overhead crane facility
would be revised from 10- to 20-ton capacity, and
the truck door in the north wall of the ARE Building
would be enlarged.

The double-walled tank described above is
essentially the container considered for this instal-
lation. The inner tank, or pressure vessel, would
be approximately 24 ft in diameter with a straight
section about: 11 ft long and a hemispherical bottom
and top. The joint between the removable top and
the lower portion of the tank would probably be a
bolting flange, with provision for sealing the joint
with a low-melting-point alloy. Thus the top would
be used only as required by the operating program.
The outer tank would be a right circular cylinder
approximately 27 ft in diameter and about 47%, ft
high. About 26 ft of this water-containing tank
would be above floor grade, and this portion of the
tank would be attached by a flange or weld joint
only when the operating program required that the
upper hemisphere of the inner tank be in place.
The inner tank would be set coaxially with the
outer tank, and the bottom of the inner tank would
be 1.5 ft above the bottom of the out rt !

movement of the portable fluoride fuel and sodium
moderator coolant containers to their operating
stations under the reactor. The off-center location
would also serve to minimize the length of NaK
piping that must run from the reactor through a
bulkhead in the pressure vessel to the heat dump
radiators outside the tank.

Quite a variety of shields has been considered
for the ART. The most convenient seems to be
one functionally the same as that for an aircraft
requiring a unit shield, namely, a shield designed
to give 1 v/hr at 50 ft from the center of the reactor.
Such a shield is both the lightest and mest com-
pact that has been devised. It makes use of non-
critical materials that are in good supply, and it
will provide useful performance data on the effects
of the release of delayed neutrons and decay
gammas in the heat exchanger, the generation of
secondary gammas throughout the shield, etc.
While the complication of detailed instrumentation
within the shield does not appear to be warranted,
it will be extremely worthwhile to obtain radiation
dose level data at various points around the pe-
riphery of the shield, particularly in the vicinity
of the ducts and the pump and expansion tank
region.

Several arrangements have been considered as a
means for disposing of the heat generated in the
reactor. The most promising is one that resembles
a turbojet power plant in many respects. It em-
ploys radiators essentially similar to those suit-
able forturbojet operation. Conventional axial-flow
blowers would be employed to force cooling air
through the radiators. This arrangement is flexible
and as inexpensive as any arrangement devised.

 

will give thermal ’ capacities and fluid transit
res essentially the same as those in a full-scale
aircraft power plant, It will also give some very
valuable experience with the operation of high

 

temperature liquid-to-air heat exchangers that em-

body features of construction and fabricating

techniques suitable for aircraft use. It should be
mentioned that ‘the type of radiator currently en-

is one that has been ‘tested at ORNL and

   

“appears to be the most reliable of any “radiator

    

proposed to date. Whil performance leaves

“something to be desired, if is felt that the basic
configuration is sound “and that modifications can

be made Tater : to give improved performance.
As shown in Fig. 2.8, 16 NaK-to-air heat dump

radiators would be mounted in an air tunnel which

39

 

 

 
ag

 

 

 

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

would be placed on a diagonal across the south-
west corner of the addition. Each radiator core
would have an inlet face 24 by 24 in. and a depth
of 6 in. These radiators would be located at floor
grade over the NaK pipe lines and the NaK fill and
drain pit, Four 75,000-cfm axial-flow blowers de-
signed to give a head of 10 in. H,O would force
air through the radiators and out through a discharge
stack.

The fuel fill-and-drain system envisioned for the
ART incorporates two shielded dump tanks. One
would be coupled to the reactor with a remotely

~ operated coupling, while a second emergency dump
“tank would be welded directly to a discharge pipe

from the reactor. The remotely operated coupling
to the first fuel dump tank would give flexibility®in
the operation of the reactor, since it would make it
possible to bring fuel to or remove it from the site
expeditiously and would keep the footage of pipe
and the number of valves to a minimum.

For handling the heavy, shielded fluoride and
sodium containers inside the inner tank, a track
would be installed on the floor and inside the wall.
Wheels would be mounted on both the bottom and
one end of the tank dolly so that the assembly
could be lowered by the overhead crane to the floor
track, with the end wheels on the dolly riding
against the vertical track. Once on the floor track,
each dolly would be moved to its operating station
under the reactor. Each track pair in this area
would probably be mounted on a lift for raising the
tank connection nozzle to the contact position
within the reactor shield.

In addition to the NaK piping bulkhead mentioned
above, a control junction panel such as that shown
in Fig. 2.7 would be installed as a part of another
bulkhead through the tank below the building floor
grade to pass the tubing and the electrical con-
ductors required for operation, control, and moni-
toring. Two more bulkheads, in the form of man-
holes, would probably be installed in the upper
portions of the inner and outer tanks. One manhole
would be about 3 by 5 ft and located just above the
inner tank flange to allow passage through both

container walls and thus provide entrance to the

40

inner tank subsequent to placement of these sections
of equipment. The second opening would be a
manhole about 5 ft in diameter in the hemispherical
top of the inner tank to provide overhead crane
service after placement of the top. Sufficient cat-
walks, ladders, and hoisting equipment would be
installed within the inner tank to provide easy
access for servicing all equipment, as shown in
Fig. 2.6. Co oo

The control bulkhead in the double-walled tank
would be located so that the associated control
junction panel and the control tunnel would be on
the control room side of the tank. The tunnel
would extend to the auxiliary equipment pit (formerly
the ARE slab storage pit), where it would terminate.
The tubes and conductors from the junction panel
would be channeled from the tunnel either to equip-
ment in the pit and basement or to the control
room (formerly the ARE control room). The pit and
basement equipment would include such items as
the lubricating oil pumps and cooler, borated shield
water pumps, cooler and makeup equipment, vacuum
pumps, relays, switch gear, and emergency power
supply.

The reactor off-gas flow would probably be piped
through the NaK piping bulkhead to a disposal
facility outside the building. Such a system would
probably consist of an activated-charcoal absorption
bed contained within a pipe which would be long
enough to provide the required delay period to
bring the activity of the krypton (which would not
be adsorbed by the charcoal) to a tolerable level.

Field maintenance and laboratory facilities
would be installed in the area east of the ART test
bay and south of the low bay of the ARE, This
area and the ARE experimental bay would be
partitioned from the ART test bay with about a
16-in.-thick shield wall of stacked solid concrete
block. This wall would not be erected until after
placement of the upper sections of the double-
walled tank. The only other major rework of the
ARE facility to accommodate the ART would
probably be that of modifying and equipping one
of the ARE experimental pits for underwater dis-
assembly work on the reactor after operation.

-3. EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR ENGINEERING

H. W. Savage
. Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

Design work is under way on an in-pile test
loop for operation in a horizontal beam hole of
the MTR. This work is being done in cooperation
with the Solid State Division and Pratt & Whitney
Aircraft. The specifications for the loop have
been established. Tests are under way on a
horizontal-shaft sump pump for the loop, and a
salt-to-air heat exchanger has been fabricated.

The use of ARE-type sump pumps for high-flow
heat exchanger tests is being investigated. The
K-25 loop test of ARE components is being con-
tinued as a life test of the ARE type pump, and
over 3000 hr of operation has been logged. De-
velopmental work is under way on pumps for the
ART, with particular emphasis being given to
impeller fabrication and performance.

“Three Inconel forced-circulation loops have been
operated with NaF-ZrF,-UF ,. The first two loops
failed after 48 and 3 hr, respectively, but the third
loop has operated for 150 hr with a Reynolds
number of 10,000 and a 200°F temperature gradient,
A third beryllium-sodium-Inconel mass transfer
test has been completed and has been submitted
for metallographic examination, and components
have been fabricated for tests of sodium in multi-
metal loops. oo

Developmental work is under way on components,
such as a pump and a gas-furnace heat source,
for a loop for testing fused salt-to-NaK heat ex-
changers. A leak test has indicated that small

“loop fest resulfs.” By testing at flow and temper:

ature conditions within the range of out-of-pile
forced-circulation experiments, data should be

“and a shaft si

 

obtained ‘on which to base extrapolations of the
more readily obtainable out-of-pile test data. Of
course, space limitations of the reactor beam
holes somewhat limit the conditions obtainable
in a safe and reliable experiment.

The proposed test unit will consist of an 8-ft
loop of Yin. schedule-40 seamless pipe with a
little over 1 ft in the active zone of the reactor.
The ratio of the total volume to the volume in the
high flux zone, known as the dilution factor, is
approximately 10. Flows in the turbulent region,
Reynolds number approximately 4000, with a
maximum temperature of 1500°F have been pro-
posed. A temperature differential of 300°F and
heat transfer of 30 to 50 kw are expected with a
power density of approximately 2 kw/cm®. These
conditions probably can be achieved with a fuel
composed of NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (53.5-40.0-6.5 mole %).

Design work is proceeding on this loop and its
components to meet the above specifications.
Handling equipment is planned which will fa-
cilitate isothermal operation of the loop prior to
insertion into the reactor and which will also
receive the radioactive materials after in-pile
operation,

‘‘regenerative-turbine’’ type, but it differs from
conventional design in a number of points. There
is no positive shaft seal, but, rather, there is
close clearance between the shaft and the impeller
housing. Some fluid leaks along the shaft laby-
rinth into the small combination sump and ex-

impeller through a hole connecting the sump to
the pump suction. To accommodate thermal ex-
pansion, total impeller side clearances have been

may be noted, the total impeller end clearance
is a primary factor in determining pump per-
formance, while the distribution of clearance, front
to back, is relatively unimportant. This is fortu-
nate, since the end clearance can be fixed in
fabrication, but the impeller position is affected
by thermal expansion and bearing alignment.

The pump has unusual ability to remove gas.
In water tests, air was injected into the impeller
at a rate of several cubic inches per minute and
was continuously removed with only a slight

operation there is usually no more than 1 vol %
of gas in the fluid.

The pump will satisfactorily prime and fill the
test loop in which it is installed if fluid is added
to the sump while the pump is running and the

total impeller side clearances are maintained at

0.040 in. or less. However, priming becomes
erratic with the greater clearances required for
operation of the pump at high temperatures.
Several methods have been demonstrated for ob-
taining a positive displacement of fluid into the
loop with large pump clearances. Each method,
however, requires either complicated freeze valves
or pressure controls. Vacuum filling appears to
be the most attractive solution to the problem but
has not been tested.

i Heat Exchanger
D. F. Salmon L. P. Carpenter
~ Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division
A single-tube, longitudinally finned, salt-to-air
heat exchanger has been fabricated for use in an

in-pile loop. Since the staggered-fin arrangement

required to ensure adequate heat transfer with air

resulted in a very high pressure drop, it seems
imperative to use a lead shielded recirculating
system with a secondary gas-to-water heat ex-
changer for safety in the event of a salt break
into the gas stream. The use of helium would

simplify both heat ‘exchangers, and therefore a

life based on actual use.

 

   

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

The test loop, set up at K-25 for examining
ARE fuel-tube hair-pin sections and an ARE heat
exchanger, was stopped after 2047 hr of nearly
trouble-free operation for removal and examination
of the ARE test components. At the time of
of the ARE test components, only a
cursory inspection of the pump was made because
operation had been trouble-free except for the
plugging of gas nozzles with zirconium fluoride
vapor condensate. An inspection of the inside
surfaces of the pump tank cover revealed sta-
lactites of salt that covered nearly all riser and
nozzle skirts and bolts and protruded beneath the
lower heat radiation baffle into the pump tank
gas space. These stalactites are not deleterious
to pump operation, The loop was modified to
consist only of the pump, loop piping, throttling
valve, and the previously used venturi element,
and the pump has now been operated for an ad-
ditional 1000 hr at 1350°F, 40 gpm, and 1500 rpm.
Slight noises were noticed at the pump bearing
housing after a total of 2847 hr of operation.
However, these noises had not greatly increased
when the total operating time had reached 3000 hr.
The gas-line-plugging problem which was en-
countered after 2047 hr of operation was eliminated
completely by a newly designed vapor trap. Oper-
ation of the loop is being continued as a life test
of the pump,

Pump performance data (Fig. 3.3) were obtained
over the speed range 600 to 1400 rpm with the fluo-
ride mixture NaF-ZrF ,-UF (53.5-40-6.5 mole %)

unlike those encountered in developing ARE
pumps, but they will be magnified by the higher
capacity requirements, by the resulting higher

‘power requirements, and by a number of special

restrictions imposed because of the proposed
locations of the pumps.

The location of the fuel pumps imposes problems
in impeller and in inlet and discharge housing
design, since it will be necessary to match the
fluid dynamic requirements of passages leading
from heat exchangers into the pumps and from the

pump discharge housings into the core. Various

impeller designs are being investigated and will
be used to evaluate cavitation characteristics.
Previous experience with ARE impellers indicates

that casting is not a promising means for fabri-

cating Inconel impellers in the present state of
the art, and therefore a brass impeller has been
made for studying fabrication problems and ob-
taining initial performance data. Preliminary
planning has been started for the fabrication of

44

models for study of pump discharge and entry
conditions,

Seal design, bearing structure, cooling, lubri-
cating, and driving means are other problems being
studied, and the reliability of these components
and operations is being ascertained through a
succession of mechanical shakedown, water per-
formance, and high-temperature tests.

into operation with a Reynolds number of 10,000
and a temperature gradient of 200°F in the fuel
mixture NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %). The
design of this loop is illustrated in Fig. 3.4. A
failure occurred in the heater section of this loop
when the pump was stopped after 48 hr, without
reducing the power input into the heater section,
to take a faulty instrument out of operation. This
loop was constructed of 0.5-in.-0D, 0.020-in.-wall
Inconel tubing. Three unsuccessful attempts have
been made to get the loop back in operation, but,
in each case, failures of the tubing occurred during
the cleaning operation with barren fuel mixture.

Another loop (loop No. 3) constructed of 0.5-
in.-OD, 0.040-in.-wall Inconel tubing was suc-
cessfully started and a Reynolds number of 10,000
and a temperature gradient of 300°F were attained.
After operation for 3 hr, the test was terminated
because of failure of tubing near a welded joint.
The data from the startup revealed conclusively
that the loop could be operated without a heat
economizer; therefore construction of the loop can
be simplified.

A third loop, without the economizer, was built
with  0,5-in.-OD, 0.045-in.-wall Inconel tubing.
This loop included a sump pump (model LFB),
a cooler, and a heater. The loop has been in
operation over 150 hr with a Reynolds number of -
10,000 and a 200°F temperature gradient. The
fuel being used is NaF-ZrF ,-UF (53.5-40-6.5
mole %). The maximum fuel temperature of 1500°F
is produced by a power input of about 72 kw. This
loop is scheduled to operate for 1000 hr.

Natural-Gas Heat Sources for Forced-Circulation
Loops

5 L.A. Mann
~ Aircraft Reactor Engineering Division

o Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

Several tests of burners were made in order to
obtain preliminary data for design of a natural-gas
heat source for forced-circulation corrosion test
loops. It was found that exhaust gas temperatures
of between 2800 and 3300°F could be obtained
without initial air preheating, and, by using air
at a rate of 65 to 650 cfm, the equivalent of 100
to 1000 kw of heat was released. Maximum system
thermal efficiencies of 20 to 60% appear to be
feasible.

Tests with electric-resistance heated units indi-
cate a maximum wall temperature of 1750°F with
the tubing lengths required by pressure-drop and
flow considerations. Somewhat higher tube-wall
external element temperatures or proportionately
longer heater sections would be required with gas
heating. An economic study indicates that there
is little choice between providing electrical power
supplies and providing large-capacity air supplies
for gas heating. Therefore, since development of
a gas-heated unit specifically for this purpose
would be expensive and since there is no present
proof of reliability of components and operation
of gas-fired loops, further study of gas firing for
these test loops appears to be unwarranted.

A number of tests of fused salt-to-NaK heat

fabricability, operability, operating parameters,
and reliability of heat exchanger tube bundles
such as those proposed for the ART. The test

46

loops are to include reliable pumps, reliable heat
sources, and adequate heat sinks.

A preliminary heat exchanger test reported previ-
ously® “indicated reasonable structural integrity
of the exchanger (1682 hr of operation), but little
data on operating parameters were obtained. For
the next experiment, a regenerative system is to
be used in which the heat exchanger will be an
economizer that will transfer about 4 Mw of heat,
while a heat input and release of only 1 Mw will
be required.

R. E. MacPherson

It has been postulated that small leaks which
develop in metal walls separating NaK and fluo-
ride fuels may be self-plugging as the result of
the precipitation of high-melting-point reaction
products. A program of tests is currently under
way to check this possibility. To date, one test
has been run, which indicates that self-plugging
can occur with NaF-ZrF ,-UF , fuels. The leaks
are installed between three cells as shown in
Fig. 3.5. The center cell is pressurized to leak
into the end cells under the pressure differentials
shown, 5 and 50 psi.

The test rig was filled with NaF-ZrF ,-UF , fuel
in the center cell and NaK in the end cells. The
leaks were about 0.002 in. in diameter. After
12 hr at 1300°F, there was no apparent leakage,
and x-ray pictures taken at intervals during the
test showed no changes in liquid levels.

A series of tests is being made in order to
determine whether an existing model DANA pump
(ARE moderator-coolant-type sump pump) is suit-
able for the high-speed operation which will be
required in the intermediate heat exchanger test
loop. Critical shaft-speed determinations made
by K-25 personnel indicated that the pump could
be operated safely at the proposed speed of ap-

proximately 3700 rpm.

the 85-kw level. When the unit was first fired
and test operated at lower temperatures (1100 to
1400°F), higher efficiencies were obtained, not
only because of the increased temperature differ-
ential between the flue gas and the sodium but
also because of the clean condition of the inside
surfaces of the furnace. Over 100-kw output at
essentially design efficiency was attained through-
out operation in the Tower temperature range, but,
because of an unsatisfactory flame-failure safety
system, sustained operation was impossible. After

the unsatisfactory condition had been corrected,

continuous operation ‘at 1500°F was resumed, and
it was found again that 55% was the best ef-
ficiency obtainable.

The furnace performed exceptionally well as a
compact, high-capacity heat source. At the
maximum operating condition of 166 kw total heat
released, the release rate based on the combustion

local boiling of the sodium coolant, by accumu-

lation of a gas pocket in the line, by external

corrosion in the high- -temperature exhaust gases,
or by higher-than- predicted local gas- -side heat
transfer coefficients. The coolant tubes were
arranged in ten parallel passes that were mani-
folded into two ‘banks of five passes each. It
was observed in operation that the sodium outlet
temperature from one bank of five tubes was as
high as 1550°F, while that from the other was
only 1480°F. Temperature variation from tube to
tube within each bank of five tubes could con-
ceivably have been equally bad and have resulted
in hypothesized sodium temperatures of 1600 to
1650°F. The boiling point of sodium is 1620°F
at atmospheric pressure and about 1800°F at
2 atm, and thus local boiling of the sodium,
together with consequent reduction in the local
heat transfer coefficient, is certainly a con-
ceivable possibility. Although it seems possible
that small amounts of gas were trapped in the
spirally wound tube coils during initial filling
with sodium, the location of the tube failures
makes it difficult to visualize the accumulation
of gas in stable gas pockets as contributing to
the failures.

Some external corrosion and erosion of the tubes
were observed, but there was no strong evidence
that they were advanced enough to have been the
cause of failure. The gas-side local maximum
heat transfer coefficient could have been con-
siderably higher than the predicted value of 60
Btu/hr-f12.°F because of nonuniformity of gas
flow and combustion, and burning could have taken
place on or very near to the tubes in question.

Natural-Gas Burner

The exploratory tests on gas burners, described

previously,® were used as a basis for new burner

developments. Designs for obtaining better mixing
of air and gas and higher pressures in the burning
chamber have been investigated, and some tests
have been made in which preheated air and gas
were used. 1he test units were based, in general,

on designs developed by the Esso Marketers in

the past few years. In these units, the burning
chamber serves also as a flame holder and a

"burning-rate controller. A schematic diagram of

the basic design is shown in Fig. 3.7.

The first burner that was built was operated
at approximately 3100°F and 400-kw heat release
without a pressure-forming barrier at the exit of
the burner. It was then operated at about 3200°F
and 250-kw heat release at about % atm pressure
drop from burner to air to simulate a heat ex-
changer after the burner.

A second burner was designed on the basis of
data from the first burner, plus specific provision
for preheating the air and gas. Tests were con-
ducted in which a temperature of about 3300°F
and 1-Mw heat release were obtained by using
unpreheated air and gas. Auxiliary tests indicated
that premixed air and gas fuel could be preheated
to 1600°F or more without serious preignition.

In operating a high-temperature system with a
molten fluoride salt containing appreciable quan-
tities of zirconium fluoride and bianketed with
inert gas, it is difficult to prevent plugging of
the gas lines leading to or from the vessel. A

___.vapor-trap device has therefore been developed
which provides a sufficiently large vapor con-
“denser to prevent plugging in an operating period
“of several thousand hours with reasonable gas

“movement (no excessive continuous bleed) and to

enable adequate heating of the gas line between

was eliminated by heating the gas line to 1300°F
and by installing the vapor trap so that no cold

which time approximately 125 ft of helium was
bled into the tank and out through the vapor trap.
No plugging of the trap or of the Vein. gas lines

nation of the vapor trap and heated tube revealed
that all heated surfaces remained clear and that

the test loop at K-25, and approximately 70 ft3

from the pump tank without plugging. The trap
has since operated over 900 hr with more than
100 periodic vent operations without plugging.
Similar traps installed in the ARE fuel pump were

The second of two critical assemblies of the
reflector-moderated reactor was constructed as a
part of a program presented previously.! The
reactor is composed of a beryllium reflector and a
fuel region of enriched uranium metal and Teflon
(CF,) _. The first assembly, an essentially spheri-
cal fuel core surrounded by the reflector, was
described in the previous report, Since it con-
tained no extraneous structural materials, the
experimental results could be compared with the
results of multigroup reactor calculations. The
results of the second experiment were also to be
correlated with the calculations, since the second
assembly, too, was unpoisoned by structure, The
assembly has a central polyhedral core, or island,
of beryllium about 10 in. in diameter enclosed by a
4.5-in.-thick uranium-Teflon fuel annulus. The
fuel is surrounded by an effectively infinite be-
ryllium reflector. Aluminum shells, 0.065 in.
thick, separate the fuel from the island and from
the reflector and provide structural stability. The
assembly is completely described elsewhere, and
a summary of its composition is given in Table 4.1,

per cubic centimeter of fuel annulus contained

about 7.5% excess reactivity. In order to com-
pletely fill the fuel region without excess control
rod poison, it was necessary to decrease the
loading to 4.66 kg of U23% at a density of 0.092 g

of U235 per cubic centimeter of fuel annulus. This

latter loading has been shown, by calibrated control
rods, to contain 0.92% excess reactivity, equivalent
to about 0.31 kg of U235, which gives 4.35 kg of
U235 as the critical mass of the unpoisoned
assembly.

A series of measurements of neutron and fission-
rate distributions and of reactivity coefficients
will be made prior to the incorporation, in the
structure, of additional materials to simulate
reactor components,

5. CHEMISTRY OF MOLTEN MATERIALS
W. R. Grimes

Materials Chemistry Division

Study of the NaF-ZrF ,-UF, system by the use
of various techniques, including quenching, thermal
‘analysis, and filtration, has continued. Improve-
ments that have been made in quenching methods
are expected to accelerate the availability of data
by this method. Phase studies of the UF -bearing
fluoride systems have continued to be emphasized
because of interest in their favorable corrosion
characteristics. It is believed that problems
attendant to handling the easily oxidized UF,
will be alleviated to some extent by extending
phase studies to include LaF, an isomorphous
stable substitute for UF.

Investigations of the chemical reactions in molten
salts are continuing in an effort to understand the

"mechanisms involved in the purification of fluoride
mixtures and in the reduction of UF, to UF; in
fluoride melts. Similar studies of the corrosion
products of Inconel in fluoride mixtures and of the
reduction of UF, by structural metals are under
way.

A sufficient stock pile of purified zirconium
fluoride-base fluoride mixtures will have been
prepared by ‘the end of this calendar year to allow
termination of operation of the large-scale (250-Ib
capacity) production facility. Careful control of
operating conditions in the pilot-scale facility has
allowed production of sufficiently consistent UF,

Additional quenching data obtained with a number

essentially confirmed previously reported findings.
There was some indication from thermal analysis

of structural considerations?) that these come

Preliminary petrographic and x-ray
diffraction studies of the slowly cooled melts lend
support to this view, but quenching data will be
obtained in order to assure that the crystalline
phases observed represent equilibrium conditions.

pared by R. M. Freestone, gives a picture of the
liquidus relationships in this system,

Phase Relationships in UF,-Bearing Systems
R. E. Moore R. E. Thoma

Materials Chemistry Division
H. Insley, Consultant

Study of UF,-bearing systems has been con-
tinved on NaF-ZrF ,-UF,, NaF-UF,, KF-UF;, and
ZrF -UF ,-UF, mixtures, In addition, work was
begun on NaF-LaF, and KF-LaF, systems, since
LaF, is known to be a stable ‘‘stand-in’’ for the
more difficultly handled UF. Work on the KF-UF,
mixtures has revealed that a red phase, formerly
designated as K3UF, may have as much as 75%
of the uranium in the tetravalent state; its apparent
homogeneity over a wide range of U3*/U4* is
possibly due to a solid solution of K;UF, and

58

 

K3UF,. The existence of the latter has yet to be
demonstrated. It is now thought that NaUF ,, rather
than NasU,Fg, as previously postulated, is the
empirical formula of an incongruently melting
compound in the NaF-UF; system,

UF; in ZrF ,-Bearing Systems. Studies of ZrF ,-
UF ,-UF; mixtures were reported earlier.®* The
more recent of the reports? indicated a probable
composition of 50 mole % ZrF,~25 mole % UF ,-25
mole % UF, for a brownish, slightly birefringent
phase noted in this system. Recent studies of
mixtures in this system that were prepared by
adding uranium metal to ZrF ,-UF, mixtures and
stirring the partially reduced melts until they
solidified indicated that the mixture with the above
composition consists of two phases, while a
mixture containing 33.3 mole % ZrF ,~33.3 mole %
UF ,-33.3 mole % UF; is essentially a single-
phase brownish crystalline material that is be-
lieved to be a compound. Another phase observed
at higher ZrF, concentrations, usually described
as olive-drab, appeared to be the only phase
present in a mixture containing 75 mole % ZrF ,~
12.5 mole % UF ,-12.5 mole % UF,. All these
compositions are theoretical compositions based
upon complete reaction between UF, and uranium
metal in the molten material, The meager analyti-
cal data available for such mixtures indicate that
the reactions probably did not go to completion in
all cases, and so the percentage of UF, is likely
to be higher and the percentage of UF, lower than
are shown by the formula.

In the NaF-ZrF -UF ; system, four compositions
were prepared along a join connecting the minimum
melting compositions in the NaF-ZrF, binary (42
mole % ZrF ,; mp, 500°C) and the NaF-UF; binary
(29 mole % UF; mp, 715°C). Liquidus tempera-
tures determined by thermal analysis for the
mixtures containing 5, 12, 20, and 25 mole % UF
were 650, 775, 865, and 775°C, respectively. The
25 mole % UF; mixture contained free UF,, in
addition to the NaF-UF,; complex and Na, ZF.

KF-bearing reduced-uranium mixtures that were
analyzed chemically contained varying quantities
of tetravalent uranium, usually in a form that could
not be recognized as such either petrographically
or by x-tay diffraction analysis. Some progress
was made during the past quarter in gaining a
better understanding of phase relationships in this
KF system. Investigation of the KF-UF, system
has been considerably aided by beginning the
study of the KF- LaF, system. The compound
LaF, is isomorphous with UF,, has almost identi-
cal lattice dimensions, and, furthermore, has only
one stable valence state (34), whereas UF, is
maintained with difficulty, Dergunov’ published
partial phase diagrams for the alkali fluoride~LaF;
systems, and Zachariasen® has studied mixtures
of KF and NaF with LaF, by an x-ray diffraction
technique. Both workers. indicated only a single
compound, KLaF,, formed by these two compo-
nents, According to Dergunov, it melts incongru-
ently at 770°C, It seems probable, therefore, that
the compound that was called K;U,Fy was actually
: KUF,, with an incongruent melting point of
820 * 10°C, Tests performed duting the past
quarter demonstrated that the red crystalline phase

formerly designated K,UF, can have as much as

75% of the uranium in the tetravalent state, Since

this phase is usually cubic, as is K;UF,, and

No additional data have been obtained since that

NaUF, rather than NasU,Fq. Since UF, is the
primary phase that separates from the melt at the
50-50 composition and since UF, has a higher
density than the liquid, it is likely that the earlier
identification of compound composition was in
error because of lack of equilibrium conditions on
cooling.

liquidus temperature for this mixture was deter-
mined by visual observation to be 560 + 10°C, The

Chemical analysis showed that 17.6 wt % uranium

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

UF, Stability
W. C. Whitley ~~ R. J. Sheil

Materials Chemistry Division

During the past quarter studies have been under
way on the stability of UF; separately and mixed
with KF. Disproportionation of UF; in KF in

Inconel! at 1000°C has been established. When
contained alone in Inconel, UF, does not detect-
ably disproportionate below 1250°C.,

Stability of UF; at Elevated Temperatures. The
disproportionation of UF; as a function of temper-
ature was studied earlier under high vacuum.
Recent availability of high-purity UF; made de-
sirable a study of the high-temperature stability
of UF; in a helium atmosphere. For these expeti-
ments 25-g samples of UF, that contained 99.4%
of the uranium in the trivalent form were sealed
by welding in Inconel tubes containing % atm of
helium. After being heated at the desired tempet-
ature for 1 hr, the tubes were removed from the
furnace and were air quenched to minimize re-
combination of UF , and uranium metal, After the
UF, samples were cooled to room temperature and
ground in an inert atmosphere, they were examined
petrographically, by x-ray diffraction, and by
chemical analysis. The sample heated to 1200°C
showed no evidence of disproportionation, the
sample heated to 1250°C showed very slight
evidence, and the sample heated to 1300°C showed
definite evidence. In addition to the increase in
UF , content noted in the petrographic examination,
an increase in U4" was shown by chemical analy-

in the tube walls that had been in contact with the
UF, was established. These data show that UF,
is more stable ot elevated temperatures than
estimates of its thermodynamic properties 413
had indicated. It is interesting to note that the
sample of UF, heated to 1300°C was practically
insoluble in boiling 10 N HCI, whereas samples

"heated to lower temperatures dissolved readily in
this solvent. This could indicate that either a
sintering action occurred, which takes place in
oxide systems well below the melting point, or

that the small amount of liquid UF, formed at the
high temperature exerted a cementing action of the
UF, crystals on solidifying.

Stability of UF, in KF. An attempt was made to
determine the stability of UF, in molten KF as a
function of temperature by starting with dry KF
and high purity UF; (99.4%). Mixtures of KF and
UF, in the molar ratios of KF to UF; of 3.0, 1.5,
and 1.0 were mixed, sealed in Inconel capsules
containing % atm of helium, and heated for 2 hr
at various temperatures before air quenching. A
period of two weeks elapsed between the time of
the experiment and the time that the samples were
submitted for chemical analysis for total uranium
and U3*, and thus there is some doubt of the
significance of the U3* determinations. However,
both the total uranium and the trivalent uranium
values exhibited a downward trend with increasing
temperature in the temperature range 750 to 1050°C
for mixtures having a 3 to 1 KF-UF; molar ratio.
An average of 7 moles of UF, disappeared per
gram-atom of uranium lost, presumably by alloying
of the uranium metal with the Inconel capsule
walls. Mixtures having 1.5 to 1 and 1 to 1 KF-UF,
molar ratios were heated to 850 and 1050°C, Analy-
ses of these melts also showed the downward trend
in U3* and total uranium values with increasing
temperature. In these samples, however, the ratio
of moles of UF; (or gram-atoms of trivalent ura-
nium) to gram-atoms of uranium lost averaged about
5 as compared with the theoretical value of 4. The
capsules used to contain these materials were not
analyzed for metallic uranium; however, a similar
experiment was performed in which an 85 mole %
KF-15 mole % UF, mixture was heated to 1000°C
in an Inconel capsule for 90 min, The melt was
sampled by drilling after the top and bottom of the
capsule had been cut off. The remainder of the
melt was dissolved out, and the walls were care-
fully cleaned mechanically; then, approximately
7 mils of the tube wall that had been in contact
with the melt was removed by drilling. Flashes
of light observed during drilling gave a qualitative
indication of the presence of uranium in the tube
walls which was confirmed by chemical analysis,
which showed 17.9 wt % uranium. The total of
0.28 g of uranium that was recovered from the tube
walls represented 3.6% of the total uranium con-
tained in the KF-UF; mixture. Analysis of the
melt showed 70% of the total uranium to be in
the trivalent state, It seems certain that dispro-

Differential Thermal Analysis

As a result of the high frequency of failures ex-
perienced with nickel capsules containing NaF-UF ,
samples, a new system was designed for containing
samples during differential thermal analysis.
Graphite confainers constructed so that the thermo-
couple junctions can be immersed directly in the
melt are now being used. The new system is
designed to permit evacuation before introduction
of helium as the inert atmosphere.

A cylindrical graphite block 3% in, in diameter
and 6 in. high) serves as a heat sink inside a
nickel reaction vessel (4 in. in diameter and 7 in.
deep) with a flanged head. Six graphite thimbles,
Y in, ID, % in. OD, and 3 in. deep, are spaced
on a hexagonal array inside the upper half of the
graphite block. Each thimble is filled to a depth
of about 1 in. with either sample (about 6 g) or
reference material, Al,O,; the sample depth is
reduced by about 50% upon melting.

whether a greater percentage of UF, could be
reduced to UF, in NaF-LiF-KF (11.5-46.5-42.0
- mole %) at a wer temperature than previously
used, a trial was made in nickel at 500°C, After
2 hr of equilibration of the alkali fluoride with
sufficient UF, to equal 25 wt % uranium as UF,
‘and 100% excess uranium metal, the mixture could
“not be filtered, and no quadrivalent uranium was
detectable by petrographic or x-ray analyses. Thus
complete reduction of UF, to UF; was indicated.

A similar experiment involved Squilibrating the
NaF-LiF eutectic (40-60 mole %) in nickel for 2 hr
at 725°C with added UF, and an excess of ura-
nium metal, Chemical ‘analysis revealed that
all the uranium present after the test (25 wt %)
was in the trivalent form, When the same type of
experiment was catried out with the LiF-KF
eutectic (50-50 mole %) at 600°C, only 60% of
uranium was found to have been reduced. Thus
KF appears to differ from NaF and LiF as a
solvent for UF, and UF,.

A trace of volatilized alkali metal was the only
evidence of reduction when purified KF was heated
at 900°C for 2 hr with finely divided uranium metal.
A similar result was noted when NaF-KF-LiF

(11.5.42.0-46.5 mole %) was heated to 700°C with
uranium metal for 4 hr with gas stirring. Dispro-
portionation of UF, is therefore seen as a reason-
able explanation for the quadrivalent uranium found
in UF ;-KF mixtures.

Heating of high-purity UF; with the NaF-KF-LiF
mixture at 800°C yielded material which, when
filtered, was found to have 73% of the uranium in
the filtrate, as well as all the uranium in the
residue, present as U3, Evidence of slight vola-
tilization of the alkali metal precludes a definite
conclusion as to whether reduction of KF or dispro-
portionation of UF; was responsible for the de-
tected UF ,; however, the presence of uranium
metal also in the residue indicates strongly that
some disproportionation took place.

These data indicate that CrF, in NaF-KF-LiF
eutectic is quite stable toward reduction by
nickel. In the most favorable case, less than 10%
of the CrF, appears as Cr**. The solubility of
trivalent’ chromium seems to be at least 10,000
ppm at 600°C and at least 40,000 ppm at 800°C
the solid phases observed in the cooled melts
were complex fluochromates.

When CrF, is the additive, however, the situ-
ation is entirely different. Most of the dissolved
chromium is trivalent; complex fluochromates are
observed in the cooled filtrate. The amount of
material added was such as to exceed the solu-
bility of CrF, at 600°C; so at that temperature
no material balance is possible. At 800°C, how-

ever, the solubility limit was, apparently, not

exceeded, and the concentrations found corre-
sponded extremely well to those to be expected
if chromium metal were not soluble in the melt
and if the reaction

had occurred. Published figures for AF for CrF,
and CrF, show that the standard free energy for
the reaction, as written, is +14 kcal and suggest
that

This disproportionation must be considered to be
surprising. If K, is to be reconciled with the
observed value, the activity coefficient of CrF
in the melt must be less than 10-3, Additional
data at various temperatures and concentration
levels to be obtained in the near future should
afford a more accurate estimation of the equi-
librium constant for this reaction.

When ferrous fluoride is added to the NaF-KF-
LiF mixture in equipment of nickel, no appreci-
able reaction is observed. The solubility of FeF
appears to be 12 wt % at 600°C and 19 wt % at
800°C, and it appears that FeF, is dispropor-
tionated very slightly, if at all.

If ferric fluoride is added to NaF-KF-LiF in
equipment of nickel, considerable quantities of
NiF, are observed in the filtrate, and thus re-
duction of the Fe3* by nickel metal is indicated.
However, the experiments made to date have not
afforded reasonable material balances between
NiF,, FeF,, and FeF, in the system. Additional
data will be required before this reaction can be
evaluated,

trations have been calculated from the Fe'*
values found for the filtrates, since a reliable
method for determining UF, in this mixture is not
available.

It will be noted that the values given for K,
at 600°C are larger than those at 800°C, which
is in agreement with all previous measurements.
The values at the respective temperatures are
also in fair agreement with those given earlier.

The reaction between UF, and chromium in
Inconel with NaF-ZrF, as solvent has been in-
vestigated at 800°C. In these experiments, 2 g
of Inconel (hydrogen fired at 1200°C) was con-
tacted with the melt for 5 hr prior to filtration.
The results are given in Table 5.4.

The values given in Table 5.4 for the equi-
librium constant are lower by about a fivefold
factor than those obtained when chromium metal
was used. It is possible that the activity of
chromium metal in Inconel is appreciably less
than its mole fraction. It appears more likely,
however, that these experiments represent ‘‘equi-
librium" with Inconel whose surface layer is
depleted of chromium metal. Additional data will
be obtained by using longer equilibration times
and varying surface-to-volume ratios.

A study of equilibria for reactions of Fe® and
Ce® with UF, in the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic has
been started. It has been observed that when
Fe® is equilibrated with the NaF-KF-LiF mixture
alone about 100 ppm of Fe (presumably Fe*®) is
found in the filtrate, This is very close to the

Electrolytic Purification of Zirconium-Base

Interest in the extremely short process time and
high efficiency obtained in the electrolytic purifi-
cation of molten NaF-ZrF, mixtures led to an ex-
ploration of the limitations of electrolysis as a
means of purification. At cathode current densities
up to 0.3 amp/cm?, the presence of UF, in a salt
mixture was found to greatly reduce the efficiency
of electrolysis because the reduction of UF
UF, at the cathode was counteracted by the
oxidation of UF, to UF, at the anode. A steady

"state was approached when about 5% of the UF

had been converted to UF,. Apparently the rapid

: reductions obtained with NaF-ZrF, mixtures con-
taining no UF, were due, in large part, to the
- electrolytic precipitation of zirconium metal on
“the cathode ‘and to the removal of fluorine as HF
© when "H. was used as the stripping gas or as
~*~ fluorocarbons when He was used. The reduced
F metallic impurities were precipitated in the

 

cathode deposit. Any structural metal ions which
were not deposited as a primary electrode process
were precipitated by reaction with the zirconium
metal.

Electrolysis was most effective in purification
when two advantages were achieved: first, a rapid
rate of over-all reduction of the melt, or a good
current efficiency, as measured by a high rate
of removal of HF or fluorocarbons, and second,
the deposition of impurities as an adherent cathode
coat which could be removed from the cell. In
NaF-LiF-KF mixtures the electrolytically reduced
potassium was slightly soluble in the melt, and
therefore oxidation of dissolved potassium at the
anode nullified reduction at the cathode and the
current efficiency for over-all reduction was low.
Also, an adherent cathode deposit was not
regularly found. Presumably, both these ad-
vantages could be regained, not only for the
NaF-LiF-KF system but for UF ,-containing melts
as well, by alterations in cell design, electrode
construction, and current densities.

Some of the incidental points noted were that
0~= and SO,~~ could be removed by electrolysis
in NaF-ZrF, melts, and hence HF treatment is
not necessarily required in the purification of salt
mixtures. Platinum was unsuitable as an anode
material. The NaF-LiF-KF mixtures were par-
ticularly prone to show an ‘‘anode effect,’’ or gas
polarization of the graphite anode, when there
was a slight contamination by air. The UF ,- -UF,
oxidation-reduction system showed no polarization
at graphite anodes or nickel cathodes.

The electrolyses were carried out in apparatus
of the type previously described.?2 The graphite
anodes were 1.12 cm in diameter and were im-
mersed to a depth of about 10 cm to give an area
of about 25 cm?. The cathodes were constructed
of a ¥-in.-dia cylinder of nickel gauze having a
calculated immersed area of about 70 cm2. The
wet areas of the pot and of the probes which were
occasionally used as electrodes were 500 and
10 cm?, respectively. Ordinarily, 10 amp was
passed during any continuous electrolysis step.

Preliminary results with SO,~~ removal were
sufficiently encouraging that an electrolysis trial
with helium as the sweep gas was carried out on
a 3-kg batch of NaF- “ZF, (53-47 mole %) which

the drying which occurred on heating to 600°C.
When the current was applied at 600°C, 30 v was
required to obtain 1 amp. The anode was removed
for examination, found to be in good condition,
and reinstalled. Apparently, this was an ‘anode
effect,” and it was probably due to the presence
of ‘oxygen; which is frequently encountered in the
electrolysis of fluoride melts with carbon anodes.
By using a helium sweep rate of 200 cm?/min,
CF, was found to be the major constituent (0.33%)
in the effluent gas. Also, CO was present to an
extent of 0.07%. On roising the melt temperature,
the anode effect diminished and then suddenly
disappeared at 710°C. The response to tempet-
ature was reversible; the anode effect was pro-
nounced at 700°C and absent at 725°C. The
electrolysis was continued at 725°C.

~ At low current densities (1' amp), where easily
reducible impurities were presumed to be carrying
the current, the predominant constituent recog-
nizable by mass spectrometry of the effluent
helium was CO, which was produced at an ef-
ficiency of about 0.2 equivalent per faraday.

At slightly: higher current densities (1.3 amp),
where a plateau in the E-I curve occurred because
the current was controlled by rate of diffusion
of easily reducible ions and where very little
increase in current resulted from an increase in
applied voltage, CF, began to appear in the
effluent gas.

At still higher current densities, the decom-
position potential of ZrF, was exceeded, and CF
became more prominent, along with small amounts
of higher fluorocarbons. For 6.0 v and 3.6 amp

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

the efficiency of production of CO was 14% and
that of CF, was 16%.

As shown in Table 5.5, impurities (940 ppm of
Fet* and smaller amounts of Nit* and crt
theoretically equivalent to 0.15 faraday were
initially present. Additional electrolysis beyond
five times the theoretical amount apparently had
little effect on the Fe analysis. The experiment
demonstrated that NaF-ZrF, mixtures may be
effectively purified by electrolysis under helium
without any preliminary HF treatment. No notice-
able corrosion of the electrolysis apparatus oc-
curred.

When H, was used as the sweep gas while
electrolyzing NaF-ZrF, (53-47 mole %) at 800°C,
HF could be removed at a rate proportional to
the current used (0.32 equivalent of HF per
faraday). These results were obtained with a
purified melt from which zirconium metal was
being deposited.

In view of a poor efficiency found for the elec-
trolyses of 250-ib batches containing UF,, an
experiment on 3 kg of NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (53.5-40-6.5
mole %) was carried out by using H, and elec-
trolysis simultaneously. A filtered sample showed,
prior to electrolysis, 740 ppm Fe, 90 ppm Ni,
40 ppm Cr, and 46 ppm S. The HF level when
the filtered sample was withdrawn was 1 x 10-3
mole/liter. Simultaneous electrolysis and H
stripping were started. Periodically the elec
trolysis was stopped and the HF concentration
in the effluent H, was measured to obtain an
index of the degree of reduction achieved. The
HF concentrations prevailing during electrolysis

in Figs. 5.2 and 5.3. After 2.65 faradays had

passed, the HF level was below 10% mole/liter,
corresponding to fairly complete purification, and
the trial was terminated. Analysis of the filtered
melt showed 120 ppm Fe, 40 ppm Ni, and 13
ppm Cr. The results given in Fig. 5.2 show that
- the rate of HF evolution with electrolysis is about
three times as great as without electrolysis during
the early stages of the purification. This factor
decreases until there is hardly any difference at
the end of the run. The decrease is considered
to be due to the gradual accumulation of UF, and
is reflected in Fig. 5.3, which shows the apparent
current efficiency in terms of equivalents of HF
per faraday as a function of the number of faradays
passed. The apparent efficiency varies from 3.5

to 0.5% for the UF ,-containing melt as compared
with 32% in NaF-ZrF,. The cause of the low

efficiency was apparent from the current-voltage
cutves obtained.when UF; was present.

After electrolysis had proceeded for a short
time, decomposition potentials and ‘‘knees’’ were
not encountered. Plots of current against voltage

showed a sharp increase from the origin and thus °

indicated that no overvoltages or decomposition

"potentials need be exceeded to obtain large

currents. This increase was interpreted as being
due to the presence of UF, and a small amount
of reduced UF. The primary electrode reactions,
reduction of UF, at the cathode along with oxi-

dation of UF, at the anode, caused the over-all

changes in the melt to occur very slowly. No
appreciable amounts of precipitated metals were
found on the cathodes, and it was presumed that
the bulk of impurities such as Fe’ must have
been reduced in the melt as secondary reactions
rather than being deposited on the cathode. Such
behavior might result in metal ‘‘fogs,”’ which
would be most undesirable.

“While processing fluorides for general distri-
bution, an attempt has been made to convert to an
electrolytic purification process for removal of
metallic impurities from fluoride melts. The first
trial of electrolysis was made on a non-uranium-
bearing mixture NaF-ZrF, (50-50 mole %) and
proved to be very successful. A 250.lb reactor
vessel was modified so that it could contain a
carbon cathode and a nickel anode. After a 250-ib
batch had been subjected to the usual preliminary
hydrofluorination, electrolysis of the melt was
carried out. For the electrolysis, a current of
40 amp at 3 v, a melt temperature of 1525°F, and
a helium dtmosphere were used, and the melt was
agitated. The melt reached the acceptable out-gas’

Under ideal conditions, the use of hydrogen
stripping to remove metallic impurities requires
12 to 16 hr. With normal production, that is, reactor
vessels containing metallic impurity holdup from
previous batches, hydrogen stripping may take as
long as 50 hr. Therefore it is apparent that elec-
trolytic purification of non-uranium-bearing com-
positions is the better process, and it is to be
used as soon as permanent facilities can be in-
stalled.

The electrolysis of uranium-bearing compositions
is still being investigated. Two batches of NaF-
ZrF ,-UF (50-43.5-6.5 mole %) have been subjected
to electrolytic purification. The first baich was
given 12 hr of electrolysis, and it was found that
the HF out-gas concentration appeared to level
off at 1.6 x 104 mole of HF per liter of effluent
hydrogen. = Consequently, electrolysis was dis-
continued and the batch purification was finished
by hydrogen stripping. Analysis of a filtered
sample from this batch yielded 225 ppm Fe, 20 ppm
Cr, and 40 ppm Ni. A second batch of the same
composition was electrolyzed until the desired HF
out-gas concentration was reached, after 27 hr of
purification, during which period 19 hr of elec-
trolysis was employed. Analysis of a filtered
sample from this batch showed 90 ppm Fe, 55 ppm
Cr, and 40 ppm Ni.

The large increase in electrolysis time required
for the uranium-bearing composition has led to a
more detailed study of the effect of uranium on the
electrolytic purification process. Also, the de-
sirability of obtaining a large stockpile of processed
fluorides by the first of the year and the present
in the electrolytic purification of
‘compositions have led to the

compositions containing uranium.

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Consequently, experiments were run with mixtures

- prepared without the preliminary HF treatment, and

the resulting batches were studied closely for
such contaminants as oxides, sulfur, iron, chro-
mium, and nickel. In all cases the oxide content
was not detectable, and the sulfur content well
below 100 ppm. Comparison with HF-treated
batches showed no detectable differences. The
iron, chromium, and nickel concentrations were,
in general, lower than those resulting from HF-
treated batches. In an attempt to produce the
NaF-KF-LiF eutectic (11.5-42.0-46.5 mole %) plus
14 wt % UF ; without the preliminary HF treatment,
it was found that the previous difficulty of in-
consistent results still remained.
A study of the reaction

"U + 3UF, —> 4UF,

in the presence of alkali-metal fluorides has shown

_ that potassium fluoride has a strong inhibiting
_. effect on the completion of the reaction. It was
. found that with the KF concentration of the eutectic

mixture (NaF -KF-LiF, 11.5-42.0-46.5 mole %), a
little better than 50% conversion of the UF, to
UF, could be expected. With this in mind, new
attempts were made to produce consistent batches,
and it soon became evident that the handling
technique was quite important. After several
changes in processing techniques were tried, the
most promising method was chosen as a standard
procedure. Briefly, this method utilizes separate
purification steps for the main constituents in-
volved. The eutectic (NaF-KF-LiF, 11,5-42,0-46.5
mole %) is first heated and stripped with H,. The
melt is cooled and the UF, is added, after which
the melt is again heated and stripped. The melt
is then cooled, and uranium metal is added. The
final heating and stripping are then carried out,
and the batch is transferred to a storage can.

In this manner, drying and purification of the
alkali metal fluorides are accomplished without

danger of hydrolyzing or oxidizing the UF; also,
_. thorough mixing of the UF is provided before the
“uranium metal is added. A further advantage is

that the batch is well purified and miscellaneous
side reactions of impurities with the uranium metal

“are kept to a minimum.

A series of batches was processed to demonstrate
the reproducibility of this method. In previous

‘attempts the U3* concentration ranged from 0.5 to

6 wt %. The new series of preparations, listed in

Li “Table 5.6, shows a fair degree of consistency, and

by examination of the heels left in the vessel.

A rigid program of equipment preparation was also
initiated. All reactor vessels and receiver vessels
are flange-topped to allow access for cleaning, and
the reactor vessels are equipped with nickel liners
to allow easy removal and cleansing. Receiver
vessels are presently equipped with Inconel liners

since HF was eliminated from the process. Each

Since the tentative Valves for the solubility of
xenon in the NaF- KF- LiF eutectic and in the
KNO 4*NaNO,, eutectic were reported, ?4 experi
ments have shown that leakage of xenon through

the frozen seal was possible. To minimize this.

possibility the apparatus was redesigned to have
at least 10 ecm of liquid above the frozen section
on the xenon side and to be about 6 cm long. The
new design also permits returning the fused salt
by adjusting the pressure difference and melting
the frozen seal.

While the metallic apparatus for use with the
fluoride eutectic was being rebuilt, the KNO,-
NaNO, eutectic was reinvestigated in a glass
apparatus that incorporated the new design features
described above. The nitrate mixture can be used
without significant decomposition up to about
450°C; in 6 hr, ot temperature, about 0,01% of the
nitrate was decomposed at 410°C and about 0.3%
was decomposed at 500°C,

With the new apparatus, values of 8 x 10~8 and
9.3 x 10=8 mole of xenon per milliliter of melt
at 260°C and 8.9 x 10=8 and 9.6 x 10~8 at
450°C were obtained. These values are essentially
in agreement with the previous ones, namely
8.5 x 10-8 at 280°C and 10 x 10~8 at 360°C,

X-Ray Diffraction Studies in Salt Systems
P. A. Agron M. A. Bredig
Chemistry Division

MF-XF, Binary Systems. The renewed interest
in the binary systems of alkali fluorides with

uranium trifluorides was emphasized this past
quarter. In studying these systems, difficulties
arise from partial oxidation of U(l) to U(IV)
and/or through disproportionation of the uranium
in solution in the molten alkali fluorides. It thus
appeared to be worth while first to obtain un-
equivocal x-ray data on the corresponding binary
fluoride complexes of some of the ‘‘4f rare earth’
metals, 23 especially of lanthanum, which may be
considered as a good ‘‘stand-in’’ for U(H1).

Zachariasen reported?é several trifluorides of the
‘Sfrare earth’ group as having the same ‘“tysonite”’
structure as those of the ““4f'’ group, previously
determined by Oftedal.?’” For the triflucrides,
the average La-F and U-F distances are given as
2.50 and 2.56 R, respectively, The lattice di-
mensions of these hexagonal cells differ by only
0.05%. Thus it is not surprising to discover in
samples prepared here?8 that the structure of the
double fluorides? of NalaF, and KLaF, had
their counterpart in analogous NaUF, and KUF,
structures.

According to Dergunov,” in MF-LaF, systems
all alkali fluorides, with the possible exception
of CsF, form 1:1 compounds, and only CsF forms
a 3:1, Cs,LaF,, congruently melting compound.
These data were obtained by visual observation
of crystallization from melts. Compounds below
the eutectic that are stable and polymorphous
transitions would not have been discerned.

In the present work, fused mixtures of the binary
systems MF-LaF,; (except 3NaF-LaF, and LiF
mixtures) of the molar compositions 3:1 and 1:1
were made available from thermal-halt measure-
ments.?? X-ray diffractometer patterns were ob-
tained on these melts, The phases found in the
NaF and KF systems are indicated in Table 5.7
and are the phases expected for these binary com-
positions, Excellent agreement is shown for the

Bi KLoF, and an unknown second phase. A
second fusion at this composition (sample LMB-
131), with an imposed slower rate of cooling, gives
predominantly a single phase which corresponds
to the unknown structure found in the previous
preparation. For the 3KF- LaF, composition, only
the 3,-KLaF, complex has been observed. Petro-_
graphic examinations? %indicate that the new phase

has optical properties similar to the S-phase.

The heat capacity of a sample of pure MoS,

15 and about 70°K of the sort previously reported34

with its layer structure, which is so pronounced
that MoS, actually is a good high-temperature
lubricant (Liqui-Moly).

Density and electrical conductance measurements
were made of molten mixtures of KCI and KI across
the entire composition face. The molar volume, as
calculated from the density, is nearly additive
for this system, although it shows deviations close
to the KI side. In contrast, the equivalent con-

~“ductance shows pronounced negative deviations
from additivity for all mixtures, with maximum
“deviation ‘at high KCl concentration. These data
“again show that it is inadvisable to interpret
‘maximums and minimums in electrical conductance

Kl is expressed by the equation

k = =1.7100 + 6.408 x 10=3;

between 725 and 925°C, and the density is given
by the equation ’

0 = 3.0985 — 0.9557 x 10~3: g/cm?
between 680 and 910°C. The temperature, i, is
in °C.

The density and electrical conductance were

determined for pure molten NaBr and are given
below for the range 750 to 960°C:

k = —-0.4392 + 5,632 x 10=3%

and

p = 2.9518 — 0.8169 x 10=3% g/cm3.

The self-diffusion coefficient of sodium ion in

molten NaNO, has been determined by a radio-
chemical tracer technique. The heat of activation
for self-diffusion is approximately 6 kcal/mole and,
therefore, higher than the heat of activation for
electrical conductance. Similar work with thallous
chloride3® has shown that the heat of activation

for self-diffusion of the thallous ion is greater than
that for electrical conduction. These results are
in accord with the concept that the application
of an electrical field lowers the potential barrier
restricting migration of charged ions in the ap-
propriate direction of the applied field. The self
diffusion coefficient of a given ion can be used in
conjunction with the Nernst-Einstein equation®
to calculate the contribution of that particular ion
to the total equivalent conductance of the sait.
When this is done, it is observed for sodium nitrate
and thallous chloride that, in each case, the cation
accounts for about 95% of the equivalent con-
ductance of the respective molten salt at temper-
atures about 25°C above the melting point. This
indicates that the transport numbers of these
cations relative to their anions in these two salts
are approximately 0,95,

operation for viscosity determinations cof alkali
nitrate melts. Effort has been concentrated on
determining viscosity changes immediately above
the melting points as an adjunct to the work being
done by Van Artsdalen to establish the signifi-
cance of ion size on physical properties (see
section above). In view of the low melting points
of the salt mixtures being studied, a glass instru-
ment is used, but it is planned to use an all-metal
apparatus when the investigation is extended to
chloride and fluoride melts.

The salt mixtures studied included pure sodium
and potassium nitrates as well as mixtures of the
two in 12.5 wt % steps. The values obtained for
the pure salts were about 0.3 centipoise above the
data reported by Dantuma,3® who determined the
viscosity by the logarithmic decrement method.
The viscosities of the mixtures nearly overlap at
higher temperatures, being located between the
viscosity curves of the pure components. A plot
of reciprocal temperatures vs the log of viscosity
gave an apparent deviation from linearity near the
melting point of most of the mixtures, while the
pure salts showed a direct linear correlation,

Studies of the corrosion of Inconel, type 316

~ stainless steel, Hastelloy B, and several special
‘alloys were continued through the use of thermal-
convection apparatus. Additional information on

the compatibility of the sodium-beryllium-Inconel
‘system was obtained from static, whirligig, and
thermal-convection loop tests. In an effort to find
a brazing alloy that has good resistance to sodium
and to NaF-ZrF ,- +UF,, tests of several brazes on

type 304 stainless steel T-joints were made. Simi-

lar joints of A-nickel brazed with various alloys
were also tested in NaF- -ZrF -UF ; at 1500°F and
in sodium hydroxide at 1100 and 1500°F. Addi-
tional screening tests were made of carbides of
boron, titanium, zirconium, and chromium in static
sodium, lithium, and NaF-ZrF ,-UF, at 1500°F for
100-hr periods. An 80% Mg—20% Li alloy being
considered as a crew-compartment shielding material
was corrosion tested in water at various temper-
atures; the weight losses were found to be negli-
gible. The resistance of Inconel to attack by
molten rubidium was studied in a dynamic loop
apparatus. Fundamental studies are under way of
the mass transfer in liquid lead and of fused hy-
droxides as acid-base analog systems, and further
information has been obtained of the flammability
of sodium-bismuth alloys. In further chemical
studies of corrosion, information was obtained on
the effect of temperature and of chromium additions
on the corrosion of Inconel by fluoride melts with

Inconel Loop Containing UF, in
- Alkali-Metal-Base Mixtures

Additional tests were made with alkali-metal-base
fluoride mixtures containing UF; and UF, in Inconel

“thermal-convection loops, but the results obtained
were not so favorable as those reported previously. !

Considerable difficulty was encountered in making

76

the mixtures, in controlling the total uranium con-
tent, and in determining the ratio of UF; to UF.

Two supposedly duplicate Inconel loops were
operated for 500 hr with the UF;-UF, mixture in
NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42-46,5 mole %) at a hot-leg
temperature of 1500°F (AT of ~200°F); however,
the rough surface of one loop showed maximum

penetration to a depth of 2 mils, whereas the other

loop was attacked to a depth of 13 mils. In three
other supposedly duplicate loops operated for 1000
hr, attack to depths of 8, 13, and 13.5 mils de-
veloped. Metallic-appearing layers were found in
the cold legs of all these loops.

Several loops filled with NaF-KF-LiF with and
without UF, were operated to obtain comparative
data for use in evaluating the results of these

tests, The data obtained are presented in Table
6.1,

Type 316 Stainless Steel Loops Containing
UF, in Alkali-Metal-Base Mixtures

Several batches of the eutectic NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-
42-46.5 mole %) containing mixtures of UF ; and UF,
were circulated in type 316 stainless steel loops.
However, the results obtained cannot be used for
comparative studies because the UF j-to-UF ; ratios
in the fluoride mixtures were unknown and the mix-
tures were of doubtful purity. One loop plugged after
886 hr of operation at a hot-leg temperature of
1500°F; examination showed heavy, intergranular,
subsurface voids to a depth of 11.5 mils in the hot
leg and some intergranular attack in the cold leg.
Another similar loop operated its scheduled 1000
hr, but a large deposit of dendritic crystals was
found in the cold leg.

A similar loop in which all the uranium (12 wt %)
was present as Ur, was operated to obtain com-
parative data. This loop plugged after 570 hr of
operation, and metallic crystals were found in the
cold leg. The hot-leg surface was very rough, and
there was penetration to a depth of 5 mils. The

Metallurgy Division
As one phase of the sodium-beryllium- Inconel
“compatibility studies, a series of Inconel thermal-

“gg

of the hot legs were operated. The inserts were
hollow cylinders about 6 in. long with inside
diameters the same as those of the Inconel tubing
of the loop. The outside of the beryllium was pro-
tected by an Inconel sleeve and was separated
from it by a 0.050-in. annulus filled with slow-
moving sodium. The loops were operated for 500
hr with high-purity sodium at hot-leg temperatures
of 900, 1100, and 1300°F, In none of these loops
was any attack found on the inside surface of the
beryllium, and the outside surfaces of the inserts
in the loops operated at 900 and 1100°F were
similarly unattacked. However, in the loop oper-
ated at 1300°F, the outside surface of the beryllium
insert showed widely scattered voids to a depth of
3 mils. All the beryllium specimens were darkened,
but no deposits were found by metallographic
examination.

A summary of compatibility tests conducted by
two different methods is presented in Table 6.4.
In none of the tests was a layer deposited in the
cooler portions of the test system that could be
detected metallographically. In all the tests, how-
ever, beryllium was found to be present on various
sections of the Inconel tubes. Figure 6.1 shows
the distribution of beryllium around an Inconel
whirligig loop following a 270-hr test at a hot-zone
temperature of 1200°F and a cold-zone temperature
of 1060°F, Since the velocity of the sodium bath

 

 
 

in this apparatus was 10 fps, the bath temperature

* was practically isothermal, The temperatures given
: are the outside tube wall temperatures. The be-
. ryllium distribution shown appears to be temperature
PP dependent; however, in other dynamic tests, this

was not so obvious. The outside and inside sur-
faces of a beryllium insert from the hot leg of an
Inconel thermal-convection loop are shown in Fig.
6.2. As in nearly all the other compatibility tests,

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

the heaviest attack was on the outside surface of
the insert, The attack was due to dissimilar metal
mass transfer between the beryllium and the Inconel
sleeve which surrounded it, The result of direct
contact between Inconel and beryllium in a system
containing sodium at elevated temperatures may be
seen in Fig, 6.3. The Be-Ni intermetallic layer
which formed was approximately 20 mils thick and
was extremely hard and brittle, Tests are presently

Brazing Alloys on Stainless Steel

Additional tests have been made in an effort to
find a brazing alloy that has good resistance to
both sodium and the fuel mixture NaF-ZrF -UF,
(53.5-40-6.5 mole %). The results reported in Table
6.5 were obtained from tests of type 304 stainless
steel T-joints brazed with the alloys listed by the
Wall Colmonoy Corporation, Tests are ‘also being
conducted on Inconel T-joints brazed with each of
the alloys listed in Table 6.5. All the brazing
alloys listed had good resistance to the fluoride
mixture, but only alloy C-29 had good resistance
to both the fluoride mixture and to sodium.

Brazing Alloys on Nickel

A series of T-joints of A-nickel were brazed with
the various alloys listed in Tables 6.6 and 6.7 in
a dry hydrogen atmosphere and were then exposed
for 100 hr to static NaF-ZrF ,-UF (53.5-40-6.5
mole %) at 1500°F or to static sodium hydroxide at
1100 and 1500°F, The specimens were examined me-
tallographically in the as-received condition in
order to evaluate the inclusions and the porosity.
The brazed specimens were thoroughly cleaned
before and after testing so that valid weight change
data could be obtained. In order to prevent the
rounding of the fillet edge upon polishing, each
specimen was nickel plated after testing. The
data obtained from metallographic examination of
the specimens exposed to the fluoride mixture are
presented in Table 6.6, and the data on the speci-
mens exposed to sodium hydroxide are in Table

6.7.

Most of the alloys tested appeared to have good
corrosion resistance to the fluoride mixture, except
the braze alloy with the composition 69% Ni-20%
Cr-11% Si. Several of the brazed T-joints, es-
pecially those which included copper, gold, or
silicon as an alloying element in the braze material,
showed numerous voids in the interface between
the base material and the braze fillet. These voids
are not considered to be caused by the attack of
the fluoride mixture but rather by diffusion of a

The reasons for failure of the B,C to withstand
the corrosive actions of the sodium and lithium are
not known-at this time; powder x-ray analyses of
the tested specimens of B,C indicate that B,C is
the primary phase and that a new, secondary,
unidentified phase is present as a result of both
the sodium and lithium corrosion tests, The attack
on the B,C by the fluoride mixture is not definite
or uniform, The 5 mils of attack found on one side
of the specimen was the maximum depth of attack
if the 14-mil-thick unidentified phase found on the
other side can be attributed to fluoride mixture in
a surface imperfection of the test specimen. Fure
ther tests will be necessary to properly evaluate
BC corrosion resistance to the fluoride mixture.

These screening, single-run, static corrosion
tests of B,C, TiC, ZrC, and Cr,C, indicate that
these carbides, except B,C in lithium or sodium,
warrant further and more severe tests in the in-
vestigation of materials to withstand the long-term,

of Inconel to attack by molten rubidium were dis-
cussed in the previous report.? Static tests at
1500 and 1650°F have shown a maximum attack of
The attack has been
both intergranular’ and in the form of subsurface
voids. Since these tests indicated that under

static isothermal conditions corrosion of Inconel

by rubidium was no serious problem, a dynamic
test was conducted. The resistance of Inconel
to corrosion by flowing liquid ‘and vaporized ru-
bidium in a closed system incorporating a tempera-
ture gradient was determined by means of a dynamic
loop apparatus, somewhat similar in appearance
to the conventional thermal-convection loops. A

The hot legs of the loop were constructed of 0.5-

section was of 0.25-in.-OD, 35-mil-wall tubing.
The loop was loaded with 8 cm® (approximately
12 g) of vacuum-distilled rubidium, which filled
it to the level indicated in Fig. 6.12, A vapor-
phase heat transfer system of this type will elimi-
nate mass transfer in the vapor regions. However,
the temperature gradients present in the liquid
region might conceivably cause crystal deposition.

The first loops in which the 50% Fe~-50% Cr
specimen was tested in liquid lead failed after
46 hr of operation with hot- and cold-leg tempera-
tures of 805 and 550°C, respectively. The second
loop failed after only 30 hr of operation vith hot-
and cold-leg ‘temperatures of 805 and 500°C, re-
spectively. Microscopic - examination showed
clearly that a phase transformation took place in
the test specimens during the operation of the
loops. As shown in Fig. 6.16, a narrow layer of a
second phase formed at the outer surface of the
hot-leg specimens, Hardness measurements yielded
values of 162 and 1140 (DPH hardness scale) for
the new and original phases, respectively. These
values correspond closely to those expected for
ferrite and sigma phases. The possibility that
the new phase was ferritic was supported by the
fact that it was magnetic and by a chemical analy-
sis of the plugs formed in the loops. Since the
plugs were slightly richer in chromium than in
iron, a decrease in the chromium content of the
outer layers of the test specimens was indicated.
The test temperature was close to the sigma-to-
ferrite transformation point, ‘and therefore even a
slight alteration in the original 50% Fe--50% Cr
composition would produce an alloy in which only

ferrite is stable at the temperature in question.

A second alloy, 50% Mo—50% Fe, was also tested.

This alloy was chosen because an intermetallic

compound predominates at the indicated compo-
sition, Circulation of lead in this loop stopped

after 520 hr with hot- and cold-leg temperatures
"of 805 and 500°C, respectively. Examination of

this loop has not yet been completed; therefore,
the results obtained will not be discussed other
than to point out that the plugging time was ap-

for loops containing their pure constituents,

Fused Hydroxides as Acid-Base Analog Systems

G. P. Smith
Metallurgy Division

If fundamental research is to make an effective
contribution to the development of hydroxide
technology, one of the primary goals must be the
evolution of a systematic chemistry of these sub-
stances. No such systematic chemistry now exists.
It is the purpose of this research to establish a
theoretical “ basis on which such a systematic

chemistry can be built,

In the first report on this investigation® the

‘various types of self-decomposition equilibria in

fused hydroxides were considered with the aid of

thermodynamics. In the case of sodium hydroxide

Equilibria | and |! are far to the left except at very
high temperatures. Equilibrium Ill favors the oxide
over the peroxide, although somewhat less so at
higher temperatures than at lower temperatures.
This report is devoted almost exclusively to the
qualitative application of two acid-base analog
theories to Equilibrium |. This is, of course, only
a small part of fused hydroxide chemistry, and the
conclusions reached will not, by themselves, tell
vety much about corrosion phenomena, However,
they are an essential part of the over-all corrosion
picture, Co

Subsequent reports will be concerned with some
: quantitative aspects of subjects treated ‘qualita-

z tively in this report, and with Equilibria Il and 111,
and, hence, with oxidation-reduction processes
* including mass transfer. oC

A large percentage of all chemical reactions in
liquid systems can be classified as acid-base analog
reactions or as oxidation-reduction reactions. In
most systems the nature of the solvent controls
the acid-base analog reaction, while in oxidation-
. reduction reactions the solvent usually plays a

minor role. On the other hand, oxidation-reduction
reactions in fused hydroxides are related to acid-
: base equilibria in at least three ways, First, acid-
base reactions depend on Equilibrium | and oxida-
tion-reduction reactions depend on Equilibrium I,
but both are interrelated by Equilibrium Ill. Second,
in some cases the ‘solvent can stabilize higher
oxidation states of metals through solvolytic re-
action. Third, in some cases the kinetics of the
hydrogen replacement reaction in fused sodium hy-
droxide appears to be dependent on acid-base equi-
5 libria in a way analogous to similar replacement
reactions in liquid ammonia, Thus, a study of
acid-base equilibria i in fused hydroxides is a neces-
sary prelude to a more interesting study of the
~ oxidation-reduction reactions which are important
in the corrosion ‘and mass transfer of metals.

In order to focus attention entirely on the simpler
dcid-base analog reactions, only Equilibrium | will
be considered. This treatment is valid at lower
temperatures and in ‘the absence of strong oxidizing
or reducing agents,

onic radius and small charge of the cations and,

second, the exceptionally small ionization energy

* of the parent atoms.

Solvent-System Concept. In terms of the solvent-
system concept first introduced by Franklin? for
liquid ammonia and subsequently applied by
Jander® to a variety of liquids, it is clear that
Eq. 2 fulfills the formal requirements for a water-
like’ acid-base equilibrium and, hence, that the
fused alkali-metal hydroxides may be properly
considered as acid-base solvent systems.

The remainder of this report is concerned with
a determination of the types of reactions which

acid-base theories show to be a consequence of

Eq. 2.

The results are given in summary only,

‘together with enough comments to orient the reader

who is familiar with acid-base theory. It can be
shown that two acid-base theories, the Bronsted
protonic-solvent theory and the Lux oxide theory,
are applicable to fused hydroxide systems. Since
the approach in this report is largely qualitative,
it will be convenient to classify reactions as
either neutralization reactions or solvolytic re-
actions. Neutralization reactions are those in
which the covalently solvent species occurs as
a reaction product, while solvolytic reactions are
those in which the solvent species occurs as a
reactant.

Protonic-System Concept. Equation 2 represents
a proton donor-acceptor equilibrium. Hence, the
protonic-solvent theory is applicable and leads
to the following analysis. One-half the hydroxyl

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

The protons, having an exceptional polarization
potential, react almost completely with the sol-
vent, Eq. 4, represented by the other half of the
hydroxyl ions in Eq. 2. Water, the product of this

reaction, thus may be regarded as a solvated

proton (onium species) in fused hydroxide so-
lution. Using the protonic-solvent theory, the
quantitative extent of reaction is regarded as
being controlied by the relative proton affinities

“of the two bases involved in any acid-base equi-
librium,

Protonic-Solvolysis-Type Reactions. At least
three types of protonic-solvolytic reactions might
be expected. First, the hydride ion provides a
special case:

(6) H- + OH" =—=0"" + H,
(7) OH- + HB—>B- + H,0

where B™ is taken as a generalized representation
of an anionic species. Third,

(8) OH- + B-——> BH + O~~

The second type of solvolytic reaction requires
that the hydroxyl ion be a stronger proton acceptor
than the B~ ion. There are, of course, many
examples of this, such as the obvious reaction

9) OH + HCIl— CI= + H,0

which, in fused hydroxides, is a solvolytic re-
action and not a neutralization. Equation 9 repre-
sents an obvious reaction because of the ex-
ceedingly weak base character of the chloride
ion. There should, however, be a series of such
reactions involving bases with proton affinities
lying between those of CI and OH™, such as
HPO,~~ and HCO,™, so that the reaction

(100 HCO,~ + OH-—>CO,~~ + H,0

might occur; if it did occur, it would be an ex-
ample of Eq. 2.

The third type of solvolytic reaction, Eq. §,
requires that the B= ion be a stronger base than
the O~~ ion. At best, there will be very few

“instances of this.

Protonic-Neutralization-Type Reactions. Neu-

‘tralization reactions in fused hydroxides which

can be treated by the protonic theory are also of

‘three types: (1) the reaction of water with the

of

oxide ion according to the formula
mn H,0 + O77 — 20H"

where the water may come from the dissociation
of another compound; (2) the reaction of water
with an ion which is a stronger base than the
hydroxy! ion but a wecker base than the oxide
ion, that is, essentially the reverse of Eq. 7,

(12) H,0 + B~—> BH + OH"
and (3) the reverse of Eq. 8,
(13) O0"~ + HB—> B~ + CH-

An obvious example of the reaction given by

Eq. 13 is
(14) 0~- + HCI— CI= + OH~

Kinetically, this reaction undoubtedly would go
by two steps,

HC! + OH-—> CI= + H,0
H,0 + O==—> 20H"

if the oxide ion were present in low concen-
trations, with the second step controlling the rate.
However, the equilibrium would be represented
by Eq. 14. Equation 13 represents a wider range
of reactions than Eq. 8 because the permissible
proton affinity range for B™ goes all the way up
to that of the oxide ion; therefore the reaction

(15)  HCO,~ + O~~ —> CO;~~ + OH~

is undoubtedly an example in which the bicar-
bonate ion behaves like an acid.

Oxidic-System Concept. There are a great many
reactions in fused hydroxides which cannot be
usefully treated in terms of the protonic-solvent
theory. Consider, for example, the familiar re-
action

(16) CO, + 20H-—> CO,~~ + H,0

The application of the Bronsted theory here re-
quires a rather complex, formal treatment. The
actual proton exchange is between the bases OH™
and O=~. The weaker base, OH™, serves as the
proton acceptor, and the stronger base, 0 ~,

" serves as the proton donor. This is the reverse

of the neutralization reaction given in Eq. 11 and
would not be predicted by the protonic-solvent
theory. This seeming contradiction may be re-

solved in a formal way, but it is much more useful
to apply the following straightforward approach.
In Eq. 16 the greater oxide-ion affinity of carbon
dioxide compared with water determines the di-
rection of the reaction.

Lux? and Flood and Férland'® have advanced
a definition of acids and bases which was de-
signed for treating the special problems en-
countered in nonprotonic fused oxide systems.
According to these authors, a base is an oxide-ion
donor and an acid is an oxide-ion acceptor; thus

7) Base = Acid + O~~

Under this definition the conventional classifi-
cation of slags as acidic or basic is preserved.
This acid-base concept has not been applied to
solvent systems, but, by a small extension, this
may be done.

Two competing equilibria of the above type can
be considered:

AO = A" + O0=-=
ptt = BO

 

 

o~- +

(18) ~
AO + B*"T=—=B0 + A"
Base | Acid Il Base Il Acid |

The acid-base equilibrium shown by Reaction 18

“may be considered to be controlled by a balance

between the oxide-ion affinities of the reactant
acid and the product acid in a manner that would
be analogous to the balance between the proton
affinities of the bases in protonic solvents.

The self-dissociation of hydroxyl ions according

to Eq. 2 completely f fulfills the requirements of

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

Thus, water, H-O-H, may be regarded as a pyro-
analog compound of hydrogen and the hydroxyl
ion as the ortho-oxyanion of hydrogen. Because
of acid-base relations involving pyroions, such
as shown in Eq. 19, two hydroxy! ions will always
be taken together to serve as a Lux base analog.

Oxidic-Solvolysis-Type Reactions. The solvo-
lytic reactions involving the oxides and oxysalt
solutes can be classified according to the ioni-
zation energy of the atom other than oxygen in
the oxide. This method of classification is
possible because the ionization energy of an atom
is related to its oxide-ion affinity. It is con-
venient to divide the elements into four groups
according to ionization energy.

First, oxides and oxysalts of atoms having high
ionization energy should react with the fused
hydroxides to give a change in coordination. For
example,

(20) SO; + 2CH- = S0,~~ + HOH

(see also Eq. 16).

Second, oxides and oxysalts of atoms of medium
ionization energy should react with fused hy-
droxides either to form or to depolymerize poly-
anionic acids, For example, the reaction

(21) P,0,4~ + 20H===2POj2~ + HCH

will probably take place. The possible reactions
of this type are numerous because of the sub-
stantial variety of polyanions. For example, there
could be the step-wise depolymerization of silicon-
oxygen compounds beginning with the three-di-
mensional network in silicon dioxide, passing
through the two-dimensional net polyanions,

"through the one-dimensional chain (and ring) poly-
“anions, the pyroanion, and finally ending with
"the orthosilicate anion.

This second type of solvolytic reaction should

“tend toward depolymerization and, for some parent
“atoms, go all the way to the ortho-oxyarion be-
“cause of the relatively high basic character of
“ the hydroxyl ion. However, there is no assurance
* that ‘the ortho-oxyanion will be the most stable

form in all cases.
Third, oxides of atoms of low ionization energy

“should react with fused hydroxides’ to form oxy-

salt “This represents a conversion from a cation

to an anion. For example,

(22) NiO + 20H-==Ni0O,~~ + HOH

- acids,

 

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

If a meta-oxysalt rather than an oxide is used as
the starting material, in some instances, the meta-
oxysalt may be converted into the ortho-oxysalt.

Fourth, oxides of atoms having very low ioni-
zation energy should not undergo solvolysis at
atl. For example, the inert behavior of magnesium
oxide toward sodium hydroxide is no doubt due to
the low ionization energy of magnesium.

There still remain a large number of potential
solutes not treated above. Of these, the only ones
which the writer has considered are the relatively

ionic metallic ‘salts. These substances will

probably be separated into ions by the highly
dipolar hydroxyl ions, and the solvolysis of the
cation and the anion can be considered separately.
The cation should tend to form oxides and oxy-
salts. This reaction should go virtually to com-
pletion except for metals of very small polarization
potential. The anionic-solvolytic reaction can

“vary from very complex to nil, and an adequate
“treatment will require the development of a some-

what more generalized acid-base theory.

As an example of the reaction of a metal salt
with a fused hydroxide, a small amount of nickel
chloride was added to fused sodium hydroxide at
400°C. The reaction proceeded rapidly with the
evolution of gaseous water and the formation of
a fine black precipitate. The precipitate was
separated from the hydroxide and found by x-ray
analysis to consist largely of nickel(ll) oxide,
together with a small amount of an unidentified
compound.

This reaction can probably be represented, in
large measure, as

(23) NiCl, + 20H~== NiO + HOH + 2CI~

Previous experiments indicate that at higher
temperatures the reaction represented by Eq. 22
would have followed that represented by Eq. 23.

Oxidic-Neutralization-Type Reactions. The neu-
tralization reactions of nonprotonic, oxidic solutes
can be divided into two classes. First, the
neutralization of a base by water takes place
according to the reaction

(24) BO + HOH—> B** + 20H-

This reaction will only occur for nonprotonic
B** which are stronger than water.

Second, reactions of the following type, which

‘6¢cur in pure oxide melts, would represent a

special type of pseudoneutralization in which no

9%

solvent would be produced.

(25) Acid + O~™~——> Base

The reaction shown in Eq. 25 includes the entire
host of reactions treated in the original Lux
theory.

When reactions of the type given in Eq. 25 occur
in fused hydroxides, the oxide ion concentration
can be varied over a wide range of values. This
is not possible with the pure oxide melts to which
the Lux theory has previously been applied. Ex-
amples of the classes of reactions which are of
the type represented by Eq. 25 may be obtained
by substituting O~= for 20H~ and deleting H,0
in Eqs. 20 through 23. The essential difference
between reactions of the type of Eq. 25 and those
given in Egs. 20 through 23 is that water is
present in the latter reactions but not in the
former. The presence of the acid of medium
strength should shift the equilibrium considerably
for much weaker acids, that is, those derived from
atoms of low ionization energy, but only slightly
for stronger acids, those derived from atoms of
high ionization energy.

Mixed-Type Reactions. Finally, reactions of
substances of what may be called ‘mixed’ types
should be mentioned. These mixed reactions
might involve protonic-oxidic salts of alkali
metals, and protonic or oxidic salts of nonalkali
metals, or combinations of both. The resulting
reactions should be capable of analysis in terms
of the same considerations used in arriving at
the conclusions already stated.

The Bronsted protonic theory was originally de-
veloped to treat the more useful low-temperature
solvents, such as water and liquid ammonia, while
the Lux theory was originally developed to treat
the metallurgically important, high-temperature,
fused-oxide systems. It is of some theoretical
interest that both theories may be rigorously
applied to reactions in fused hydroxides, although
the types of reactions for which these applications
are useful form two sets of almost mutually ex-
clusive reactions — one set for each theory. This
is symptomatic of the need to develop a more
general acid-base theory along the lines proposed
by Audrieth.!! For many solvent systems, such a
theory would be a luxury; for fused hydroxides,
such a theory is a necessity.

It should be noted that of the types of reactions
discussed above only a few examples have been
studied experimentally in a detailed or quantitative
way; most have not been studied at all or else
are represented experimentally by some of the
more obvious and less interesting examples.

Flammability of Alkali Metal Solutions at
High Temperatures
G. P. Smith M. E. Steidlitz
Metallurgy Division

In the preceding report'? data were given for
the flammability of alloys of the sodium-bismuth
system. Additional data have now been obtained
for bismuth-rich alloys that provide a much more
complete picture of the reactivity of this system.
The relative reactivity of sodium-bismuth solutions
with dry air af 700°C as a function of the mole
fraction of sodium is shown in Fig. 6.17. The
relative reactivity scale is arbitrary. Pure sodium
was assigned a reactivity of four units. Unre-
active solutions were assigned a reactivity of
zero. No measurements were made for mole
fractions of sodium between 0.6 and 1.0 because
a solid compound of composition Na Bi precipi-
tates from solution at a mole fraction of sodium
somewhat greater than 0.6.

A temperature-composition diagram for liquid
sodium-bismuth solutions is presented in Fig.
6.18, on which is plotted a curve that approxi-

region of no reaction. The circles and triangles
on this diagram represent the temperature-compo-
sition values at which tests were conducted.
Most of the circles represent two to four tests
each. The open circles represent tests in which
reaction occurred, while the black circles repre-
sent those which showed no reaction. The black
triangles represent conditions under which part
of the tests showed no reaction, while the rest
of the tests showed a slight reaction. The two
open triangles represent tests which showed an
exceedingly slight amount of reaction. The broken
portion of the curve is poorly defined, inasmuch
as it may actually pass beneath the open triangles
rather than above them, as shown. It may be noted
that jets of pure bismuth showed appreciable re-

activity at 800°C but not at 750°C,

When air was saturated with water vapor, the
line of zero reactivity was shifted toward lower
sodium concentrations by a small but appreciable
amount for sodium-bismuth solutions. This effect
is shown for sodium-bismuth solutions at 700°C
in Fig. 6.19. It may be seen that, although data
for moist air scatter badly, there is unquestionably
a small shift toward lower sodium concentrations.

Effect of Temperature on the Corrosion of
Inconel Melts with NiF , Additions

H. J. Buttram R. E. Meadows

In order to study specifically the removal of
chromium from Inconel by a known corroding agent
in fluoride melts, additions of NiF, were made
to NaF- ZF, -UF, (53.5-40.0-6.5 mole %) in Inconel
capsules. These capsules were subjected to
100-hr static tests in the temperature range 600
to 1000°C.

When the chromium concentration of the melt
after the tests was plotted against the amount of
NiF, added to the melt, a temperature effect at
a relatively high concentration of NiF, (690
meq/kg) was noted. Additions of NiF, up to about
70 meq/kg yielded chromium concentrations which
were independent of temperature to within £100
ppm Cr**. The mixture to which the large addition
of NiF, (690 meq/kg) was made showed, at 600°C,
a chromium content of 280 ppm Cr + that was
considerably below the stoichiometric quantity;
at 800 and 900°C, there were successive increases
to 630 and 840 ppm Cr**; while aot 1000°C, 550
ppm Cr** could be found. Metallographic obser-
vations paralleled the chemical analyses. Pos-
sible explanations for the finding of decreased
chromium content at 1000°C were set forth ‘in a

previous report. 3

tests in order to establish the effect of added
nickel fluoride. In the absence of added chromium
metal, the plot of the chromium concentration after
test vs the nickel fluoride added followed a linear
relationship, although the amount found in the
case of very large additions of NiF, was smaller
than stoichiometric. Metallographic tests showed
a heavy subsurface void formation to a depth of
21 mils at the hot end (800°C) and 5 mils at the
cold end (650°C), while the corresponding blank
capsules (no NiF,) showed only light attack to a
depth of 1 to 2 mils.

A series of Inconel capsules containing the
same two fluoride melts and NiF, with chromium
pellets added were subjected to fhe same type of
testing. The after-test chromium values were
above stoichiometric, and metallographic exami-
nation of the capsule walls indicated that the
NiF, additions had little effect on the amount
of attack. The heaviest attack was to a depth of
3 mils, with the average being 1 to 2 mils, The
cold ends had thin metal deposits and a slight
void formation.

Effect of Chromium Valence State on Corrosion of
Inconel

H. J. Buttram R. E. Meadows
Materials Chemistry Division

Additions of chromous and chromic fluorides
were made to NaZrF_ and NaF-ZrF -UF (53.5-
40.0-6.5 mole %) in Inconel capsules to determine
the effect of chromium valence state. Metallo-
graphic examination showed that chromous fluoride
additions had essentially no effect even in the
case of large additions (18,000 ppm Cr**). The
depth of attack was about 1 mil. As would be
expected, when chromic fluoride was added, the
Inconel showed attack to a depth of 4 mils and
some evidence of intergranular penetration. The
chromous ion has been demonstrated as the stable
state in the NaF-ZrF ,-UF systems; therefore,
it is reasonable to assume that, when chromic
fluoride is the additive, chromium metal will be
removed from the Inconel to enable the chromium
to be reduced to the chromous state. Chemical

analyses made after these tests were inconclusive
and difficult to interpret.

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

7. METALLURGY AND CERAMICS

W. D. Manly

J. M. Warde

Metallurgy Division

The nickel-molybdenum base alloys are being
studied extensively as possible reactor structural
‘materials ‘with qualities superior to those of
Inconel. Efforts are under way to evaluate and
improve the existing alloys and to develop better
ones. Radiator test assemblies have been fabri-
“cated, and weld stability and mechanical properties
.are being studied. Work has continued on the
preparation of duplex tubing, boron carbide shield-
ing, tubular fuel elements, and other special
materials. The results of oxidation resistance
tests of brazing alloys are presented. In addition,
the first production of beryllium oxide ceramics by
casting. from a a slip which is basic is described.

. DEVELOPMENT OF NICKEL-MOLYBDENUM
BASE ALLOYS

The investigations under way for the evaluation
of nickel-molybdenum base alloys as structural
materials for circulating-fuel reactors include
attempts to improve the ductility and the fabrica-
bility of commercially available Hastelloy B through
purification, and efforts to find another suitable
and improved nickel-molybdenum base alloy that
has the strength and corrosion resistance of
Hastelloy B. Fabrication experiments are being
used to determine the effects of various treatments
on the materials developed,

Fabrication Experiments

H. Inouye J. H. Coobs
Metallurgy Division

One of the difficulties experienced in the fabri-
cation of Hastelloy B is due to the narrow range
of forgeability of the alloy — between 1950 and
2100°F. The upper limit of forgeability is due to
impurities which cause grain-boundary melting.
The low ductility at temperatures between 900 and
1800°F is less understood, but it is believed to be
due to aging and impurity precipitation in grain
boundaries. Therefore efforts are being made
to eliminate trace (tramp) elements by vacuum

: melting and the addition of elements to neutralize
"their effects.

~~~ One of the most critical components of a circu-
lating-fuel reactor will be the fluoride-to-NaK

100

heat exchanger, for which, because of its com-
plexity and fragility, it will be highly desirable to
have seamless tubing. Commercially available
Hastelloy B tubing, which is now made by welding
strip, is not satisfactory because of cracks in the
weld, checks on the surface, and, in the absence
of severe working of the weld, nonuniform proper-
ties, Therefore several extrusion experiments have
been performed in an effort to produce seamless
tubing.

The initial extrusion experiments were attempts
to produce rod from air melts of Hastelloys B and
C. When extrusion temperatures above 2100°F
and up to 2350°F were used, the alloys fractured
severely in all instances. For the subsequent
experiments, the extrusion temperature was lowered
to 2100°F, and a reduction ratio of 6.3:1 wads
established. The results obtained for the various
materials are summarized in the following.

Vacuum-Melted, As-Cast Hastelloy B. The
ingot that was extruded had been homogeneized
at 2100°F for 48 hr. The front of the extrusion
fractured severely, but some improvement was
noted in comparison with the air melts previously
extruded.

Air-Melted, As-Cast Hastelloy B Plus 0.2% Ti
as Ti-Mn-Al-Ni Master Alloy. The ingot was
homogeneized 48 hr at 2100°F before extrusion.
The extrusion fractured severely, and no improve-
ment in comparison with the vacuum melt was
noted,

Air-Melted, Commercial, Wrought Hastelloy B.
The extrusion fractured severely and thus indicated
that the cast structure was not responsible for
the poor hot forgeability of the alloy.

Air-Melted, Commercial, As-Cast Hastelloy C.
The extrusion was made through a cascade die
(cone plus shear) to determine the effect of die
design. Thus for, the alloy has been extruded
through cone dies varying from 45 to 25 deg and
through a shear die. In all extrusions, the rod
fractured severely. An extrusion was also made
by containing the billet in an Inconel can 0,063
in. thick on the outside diameter and with a Yminee
thick disk at the nose of the billet. The Inconel
nose separated from the Hastelloy, but the Hastelloy

of the extrusion appeared to be sound. A thin
layer of Inconel was found on the whole length of
the extrusion. This experiment has not, as yet,
been fully evaluated.

Nickel-Molybdenum Binary Alloys. In contrast
to the experiments with the Hastelloys, previous
extrusion experiments with vacuum melts of the
binary alloys in the cast condition showed marked
improvement in the quality and ease of fabrication,
The tendency to fracture was still apparent to a
slight degree and became progressively more
noticeable as the molybdenum content of the alloy
was increased from 20 to 24%. Two extrusions of
tube blanks of the 24% molybdenum alloy were
unsatisfactory for further reduction to small-diameter

tubing because of the large fractures and deep

defects. It was found that the defects could be
eliminated by homogeneizing the cast billets for
48 hr at 2100°F. The minimum homogeneizing time
was not determined. The data obtained in the
extrusions of the nickel-molybdenum binary alloys
are presented in Table 7.1.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

Since Hastelloy C could not be extruded with
any degree of success until it was canned in
Inconel, it is concluded that lubrication is an
important factor in these experiments, At the
temperature of extrusion, although the alloy is
probably not molten, the grainboundary is weakened
sufficiently by the friction of the flowing metal
against the die to cause fracture. By providing
a layer of Inconel between the die and the alloy,
as by canning, the friction on the alloy is removed.
The friction could also be reduced by increasing
the extrusion temperature, but, to increase the
extrusion temperature, it will be necessary to
eliminate the low-melting-point impurities from the
alloys. An alternative would be to reduce the
extrusion temperature and the extrusion ratios.

The following tentative conclusions have been
drawn: (1) Vacuum melting has little effect on the
extrudability of the alloys. (2) The extrudability
of the alloy does not depend on whether it is in
the wrought or the as-cast condition. (3) Homoge-
neizing has a beneficial effect, as evidenced by

alloys of the 24% Mo—76% Ni composition. (4) Poor

New Alloys

H. Inouye J. H. Coobs
Metallurgy Division

Several new alloys are being studied in an attempt
to find an alloy that is superior to Hastelloy B,
“and efforts are being made to improve the existing

Hastelloys.’ Preliminary results of experiments
with alloys of various compositions are presented
“in the following.

Hastelloy B Plus 0.03% Cerium, A 3-Ib vacuum
melt was rolled at 2100°F, and there was con-
siderably less cracking than would have been
found with Hastelloy B. Numerous small defects

_ were present, however, that may be eliminated by

© increasing the cerium content of the alloy.

" Molybdenum-Columbium-Nickel Alloy. A 20%
Mo-5% Cb~75% Ni alloy could be cold rolled from
the cast structure to sheet, The structure is two-
phased at 1500°F and single-phased at a solution
annealing temperature of 1950°F. The tensile
strength of the alloy at 1500°F is 36,800 psi
(elongation 3.5%). A creep test at a temperature
of 1500°F and a stress of 8000 psi is in progress.

Molybdenum-Aluminum-Nickel Alloy. A 20%
Mo-2% Al-78% Ni alloy could be rolled at room
temperature from the cast condition. At 1500°F
the tensile strength was 43,500 psi with an elonga-
tion of 5%.

Molybdenum-Nickel Alloy. A 100.g arc melt of
a 24% Mo-76% Ni composition was hot rolled
60% at 2200°F. Following a 1-hr anneal at 2100°F,
the alloy was cold rolled 72% without cracking.
The work hardening data for the alloy are listed
below:

A 3-lb vacuum melt of this alloy has been rolled
to sheet and will be screened for sirength and
ductility in creep and tensile tests. In addition,
an extrusion of the alloy has been rolled to sheet
for obtaining more detailed data,

A 100-g arc melt of a 32% Mo—-68% Ni composition
was successfully hot rolled 60% at 2200°F, The
alloy was further cold rolled 72% without cracking.

A 3-lb vacuum melt of the alloy has been rolled
to 0.063-in. sheet and is being machined into
creep and tensile test specimens.

A 100-g arc melt of a 38% Mo-62% Ni compo-
sition was rolled 60% at 2200°F. The alloy cracked
when cold rolled. In the annealed condition the
hardness of the alloy is 396 VPN. The micro-
structure of the cast alloy shows a considerable
quantity of eutectic, which appears to be similar
to that found in Hastelloy B.

The following additional arc-melted alloys were
evaluated:

Oxidation and Oxidation Protection

H. Inouye J. H. Coobs
Metallurgy Division

Temporary cycling tests from 1500°F to room
temperature in air have been performed on Hastelloy
B and other nickel-molybdenum base alloys to
determine the behavior to be expected in a NaK-to-
air heat exchanger such as will be required for
aircraft reactor application. The severest operating
condition that could exist would be a thermal
cycle from operating temperature (1500°F) to room
temperature under stresses caused by high-velocity
air.

The cycling tests of Hastelloy B were evaluated
by daily visual examination of the test piece which
had been through a heating cycle of 17 hr at 1500°F
and then cooling to room temperature in the furnace,
Weight changes were also measured daily. In
conjunction with these tests, identically prepared
specimens were tested at a constant temperature
of 1500°F. The results of these initial tests are
shown in Table 7.2 and in Fig. 7.1.

The results presented in Table 7.2 show that
the loss of metal from the Hastelloy B specimen
through oxide spalling was prevented by the use
of platings. In general, aluminum and aluminum
plus nickel are considered to be unsatisfactory
platings, however, because of spalling of the
protective coating.

Several other alloys have been tested for oxi-
dation at 1500°F for comparison with Hastelloy B
and to determine whether they need oxidation
protection during elevated-temperature mechanical
and corrosion tests. The results of the tests are

shown in Fig. 7.2.

PERIOD ENDING DECEMBER 10, 1954

At a constant elevated temperature in air, nickel-
molybdenum alloys of intermediate compositions
form a protective coating of NiMoO,. Upon cooling,
regardless of the rate, the coating will spall vigor-
ously at temperatures between 440 and 230°F.!
Experimental evidence shows that this spalling
may be due to a change in the crystalline structure
of the NiMoO, coating.

The fabrication of the three test assemblies
made to date has been routine, and no unusual
behavior or difficulties have been encountered.
Although it is expected that the characteristic
aging of Hastelloy B and the subsequent loss in
room-temperature ductility will affect the longevity
of these test specimens, the first assembly has
withstood, without failure, as determined by a
helium leak test, 100 accrued hours of life with
one air quench and one water quench directed at
the fin surfaces. Other test assemblies are being
fabricated with type 310 stainless-steel-clad
copper in order to determine, in conjunction with

the evaluation of Hastelloy B, the dimensional

stability and oxidation resistance of this material
under thermal shock,

Mechanical Properties Studies

The stress-rupture properties of the nickel
molybdenum base alloys are being studied in
fused salts, sodium, and various gases. Six new
lever arm machines are being used to testHastelloy
B sheet specimens, and eight additional tube
burst units have Hastelloy B pipe in test. It is
anticipated that design curves for properties in
the fused salts at 1500 and 1650°F will be available
by February 1955. Data are also being obtained
for a design curve for properties in argon. The
results obtained in argon at 1500°F are presented

in Table 7.4.

As Table 7.4 indicates, Hastelloy B has sub-
stantially greater strength at 1500°F than Inconel,
which will rupture in 1200 hr when stressed to
3500 psi. A Hastelloy B specimen tested in hydro-
gen at 12,000 psi ruptured in 1300 hr; a similar
time to rupture was found in argon. Thus there is
an indication that Hastelloy B may not be sensitive
to a hydrogen atmosphere when tested in the so-
lution-annealed condition.

tubing is now being used in which the composite
billets are extruded.

A study of the flow of metals during an impact
extrusion is being made. For the study, the effect
of the shape of the nose of the extrusion billet
was determined on extrusions of Zircaloy canned in
copper and extrusions of vanadium canned in steel.
In addition, a two-ply and a three-ply hillet of
stainless steel—carbon steel were extruded, but
the extrusions have not yet been evaluated.

The results of the tests show that large-grained
billets, such as cast billets, produce a rough
interface between the outer cladding and the core.
A tapered nose on the can and a square edge on
the core result in a short section of can material
restricted to the front of the billet; thereafter, the
core has a thin layer of the canning material on
the surface. A square nose on the can and a
tapered core result in a thin section of core begin-
ning very soon after the front of the extrusion and
increasing in thicknesses toward the end of the
extrusion,

Boron Catbide Shielding

Suitable compositions for the boron carbide
shield for the ART heat exchanger are being de-
veloped by The Carborundum Company and by the
Norton Company by using various nonmetallic
bonding materials, including BN, SiC, and carbon,
as well as those mentioned previously.® All these

have developed a suitable composition by using
SiC as the bonding material. However, specific
details and samples of the material have yet to be
received.

Tubular Fuel Elements

Twelve fuel plates have been prepared for forming
into tubes, and eight more are being prepared.
These tubes are to be drawn at Superior Tube Co.
by the plug-drawing technique with low (10%)
reductions. Other techniques such as hot drawing
or hot swaging may be used.

Control Rods

Thirty-five control rods are being prepared for
the GE-ANP project. They were received as
specially straightened tubes, 0.504 in. ID, 0.625
in. OD, 35 in. long, with one end plugged. The
tubes are being filled with a mixture of 50% alumi-
num powder and 50% B 4C, both supplied by the

‘General Electric Company. The B,C is a special

grade containing 81% boron. The mixture is pre-
pared with 2% paraffin as a binder and is being
packed tightly into the tubes with a pneumatic
hammer. Very small increments are used to obtain
a high density, Twenty tubes have been filled
with average boron concentrations of about 0.8
g/cm®, that is, somewhat in excess of the 0.7
g/cm? required. After filling is completed, the

. tubes will be heated and evacuated to remove

the paraffin and then cold swaged to final size.

Al-Uo, Elements for Shielding Experiment

Fuel plates 28 in. long and 2%, or 2} in, wide
are being prepared for an experiment to determine
the shielding necessary for delayed neutrons.
These plates are to be mounted on a belt and
rotated at speeds up to 22 fps. The fuel concen-
tration of 0.25 g/cm? required for these plates is

quite high compared with that usually specified

for fuel plates, and therefore new fabrication
problems must be resolved.

~ Several plates have been fabricated by using
uo, and aluminum powder cores roll clad with
aluminum. Three plates having 0.040-in. core
thickness with 62 wt % UO, had the required fuel
concentration. Both high. fired and steam-oxidized
uo, were used with good results. The edges of
the core were quite clean and straight, and the
UO, was distributed faitly uniformly, as shown by
radiograph examination. Because of the high

108

percentage of uo,, it was necessary to hot roll
the plates with the covers on at all stages to
prevent oxidation. Plates with lower percentages
of UO, may be protected with thin aluminum foil
pressed on the core compact during cold pressing.

The finished plates, as-clad with 2S aluminum,
were judged to be too weak for the high stresses
involved in the rapid cycling. Several more ele-
ments are being assembled by using 525 aluminum
as frame and cladding in the hope that work harden-
ing obtained in finish cold rolling will yield plates
of sufficient strength.

The resistance to oxidation of a number of high-
temperature brazing alloys when used in con-
junction with Inconel as a base material was
described in a previous report. This study has
been extended to include tests of several additional
brazing alloys. These tests have been conducted
in accordance with the experimental procedures
used in the previous studies. The results of
metallographic examination of inverted T-joint
specimens after exposure to static air at 1500°F
for periods of 200 and 500 hr are summarized in
Table 7.6. It appears that the majority of these
alloys are suitable for service within the limits of
this investigation. The periods of exposure cur-

rently being studied extend to 1000 hr. Tests are,

also being conducted at 1700°F in static air,

It is recognized that the test results obtained to
date may nof be applicable except under isothermal
conditions. Therefore a duplicate set of experi-
ments will be conducted to determine the effect
of thermal cycling on the adherence of protective
oxide films. Included in these tests will be a
determination of the effect of the presence of water
vapor on the nature of the scale formation and the
resistance of this scale to spalling under con-
ditions characterized by temperature fluctuations.

it was not possible to detect any trace of gold at

" Beryllium oxide ceramics are being produced,
probably for the first time, by casting from a slip
which is basic. For successful slip casting, a
well-deflocculated slip is necessary, and hitherto
this has been accomplished through the use of an
acid, usually HCl. In comparison, a basically
deflocculated slip is more easily and rapidly

Although it is -

prepared, does not attack the plaster of paris
molds, is not unpleasant to the operator, and
requires very small amounts of deflocculants.
As an example, tubes 4 in. long, 0.25 in. in outside
diameter, with a 0.04-in, wall, have been slip cast
recently from beryllium oxide and also from be-
ryllium oxide containing 16.2 wt % of natural
uranium oxide. These tubes are to be used for
tests by the Advanced Design Section of GE-ANP.
To 83.8 g of BeO (previously milled to about 2p
average particle size) plus 16.2 wt % of UD, were
added about 26 ml of distilled water and 4 ml of a
2% solution of sodium pyrophosphate, After 5 min
of stirring, a creamy slip with a pH of 8 to 9 was
obtained which spread evenly over a glass stirring
rod and flowed off the rod in a smooth stream.
Casting of the tubes required a two-piece plaster
mold with an opening 5 in. long to allow for
shrinkage and trimming to 4 in. and a diameter of
0.29 in. to allow for shrinkage on the diameter.
The deflocculated slip required about 10 to 15 sec
to form a tube of the proper wall thickness in this
mold. The excess slip was drained off, and, after
an additional 3 to 5 min in the mold, the tubes
released readily from the mold and had sufficient
green and dry strength to permit handling.

A firing operation of 1 hr at 1700°C in a hydrogen
or argon atmosphere is necessary to produce the
density of 3.0to 3.4 required. In order to determine
how warpage in firing may be avoided, some tubes
are being fired suspended in a furnace, while
others will be fired lying on their sides.

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

8. HEAT TRANSFER AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

H. F. Poppendi ok

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The heat transfer experimentation during the
quarter included studies of ARE fuel in an Inconel
tube, the determination of performance character-
istics of an in-pile loop heat exchanger, studies of
velocity and temperature distributions for several

Aree-convection volume-heat-source systems, and

preliminary determinations of fluid flow character-

“istics of a proposed ART core geometry. Several

approximate mathematical temperature solutions for
forced-flow volume-heat-source entrance systems
were developed, and the question as to whether
electric currents which generate heat in the circu-
lating fluids of experimental volume-heat-source
systems affect the fluid flow characteristics was

“investigated.
~ The enthalpies and heat capacities of NaF-ZrF ,-

UF, (53-43-4 mole %) and LiF-KF-UF, (48-48-4
mole %) were determined. The viscometry equip-
ment was modified for greater accuracy, and new
measurements were made for NaF-ZrF ,-UF,. The
thermal conductivities of NaF-ZrF -UF, and of
NaF -KF-LiF with and without UF, were measured.

FUSED SALT HEAT TRANSFER
~ H. W. Hoffman J. Lones

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

Preliminary heat transfer experiments have been
performed with the ARE fuel NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (53.5-
40-6.5 mole %) flowing in an Inconel! tube. In
brief, the heat transfer system used consisted of
two small tanks (approximately At capacity)
connected by an electrically heated Y -in.-OD tube
with a length-to-diameter ratio of 43. Flow through
the heated section was produced by helium gas
pressure and controlled by an automatic cycling
mechanism actuated by the fluid level in the tanks.
The helium was purified by passage through a
NaK bubbler.

Operation of the system was terminated after
15 hr in order to inspect the Inconel tube. The
averdge fluid temperatures during the period of
operation were 24 hr at 1200°F, 85 hr at 1300°F,
and 6 hr at 1400°F. Heat transfer measurements,
made in the heated section over the Reynolds

‘modulus range of 5,600 to 10,000, yielded results

“which were 24% below the generally accepted

112

correlation for ordinary fluids. The precision of
the measurements was approximately 10%. Visual
examination of the test section after removal from
the system showed no apparent film. Samples of
the tube have been submitted for metallographic
examination. It is recalled that in the case of the
previous experiments for moiten NaF-KF-LiF
flowing in Inconel tubes, 55% reductions in heat
transfer were measured and corrosion deposits
were found on the tube walls.

About 15 individual heat transfer measurements
were made between 24 and 115 hr of operation of
the NaF-ZrF,-UF ,-Inconel system. During this
period no reductions of the heat transfer coef-
ficients with time were observed. A new Inconel
test section is currently being installed for ob-
taining measurements in the period between 0 and

24 hr.

F. D. Miraldi
M.L.T. Practice School

The heat exchanger for the LITR fluoride fuel
loop was constructed in an unusual geometry to
fit in the limited space available in a beam hole.
In order to determine the operating characteristics
of this exchanger, an experimental investigation
of its fluid flow and heat transfer performance was
conducted. The heat exchanger for the loop is
formed with helical fins brazed around a section
of straight pipe. The fins are enclosed in a
closely fitting tube and form an annulus in which
air flows in a helical path. Molten salt passes
through the center tube.

A duplicate of the actual exchanger to be used
in the loop was connected to an air supply so that
air passed through the annulus just as it would
in in-pile operation. However, instead of a fused

salt, dry steam was admitted to the center tube

as the hot fluid. The air flow rate and inlet and
outlet temperatures were measured, as were the
steam pressure and the condensate rate. From this

 

\

“ow
 

information the air flow rate and the thermal re-

. sistance of the air side were obtained as functions
of the air pressure drop across the exchanger (the

: steam-side resistance was negligible compared
. with the air- -side r istance). Combination of
these data with estimated coefficients for the
fused salt, after allowance for difference in oper-
ating temperatures, yielded performance curves for
the exchanger under anticipated in-pile operating
conditions. The data and a description of the
2 : experiment are reported elsewhere.! The method
of conversion of the results of the experiment to
in-pile conditions and the performance curves for
the exchanger have been reported.? A curve of
the heat removal rate as a function of pressure
drop of the in-pile loop heat exchanger is given

in Fig. 8.1.

however, more limited objectives than before. In

the beginning of the ORNL-ANP effort, there was

‘no information on free convection in fluids with

volume heat sources. Since the temperature struc-
ture in the fuel pins of the first fused salt aircraft
reactor experiment could not be readily predicted
because of a lack of knowledge about the free-
convection heat transfer in such a system, a
free-convection research program was initiated.
The principal objective was to determine both
theoretically and experimentally the temperature
and velocity structure in a free-convection flat-
plate system and, from these data, to discover
basic postulates that would permit analytical pre-
diction of different systems which might be of
interest in future fuel element designs. This
project was well under way when the change to
the present circulating-fuel reactor design was
made. At that time the effort was greatly reduced,
and later this research was temporarily abandoned
in favor of more pressing problems. A series of
memorandums summarizing the theoretical work
which had been accomplished were prepared.
Also, some preliminary experimental velocity
measurements in a flat-plate apparatus were ob-
tained.

In the intervening years there has been a con-
tinued interest in the temperature structure in
fluids with volume heat sources that are losing
heat by free convection in applications such as

- dump tanks for liquid fuel reactors, radiation

damage capsules, and pins containing liquid fuel.
The repeated queries on this subject prompted
the decision to reactivate the research, but on a
less ambitious basis than before. Hence, a report?
was prepared recently which ‘provides a wider
distribution to the theoretical analyses which were
distributed locally as memorandums in 1951 and

One of the considerations in the selection of a
coolant for a nuclear reactor or any heat exchange
system is the amount of flow work required for
removal of a unit of heat. This quantity, which
is referred to as the ‘‘cooling work modulus,”
varies with the geometry of the system, the fluid
velocity (and flow regime), and the properties of
the fluid.

A memorandum is being prepared that gives the
development of equations for calculation of the
cooling work modulus for turbulent flow. Curves
which simplify computation are provided, and the
results of a study of a specific reactor are pre-
This study has been
performed for an idealized reactor coolant system
which is considered to be somewhat representative
of actual solid-fuel-element reactors. In this
analysis the cooling work modulus is related to
the reactor geometry, the heat removal rate, the
thermal properties of the coolant, and certain
coolant temperature differences which are de-
termined by such factors as mean coolant temper-
ature,’ coolant melting and boiling temperatures,
tube wall corrosion and mass transfer, and thermal
stresses.

All the thermal roporties of a coolant are found
to influence its effectiveness in transferring heat
"from the reactor. An ideal coolant is indicated
to be one that has high thermal conductivity, heat

capacity, and density and a low viscosity, but the
relative merits of actual fluids depend strongly
on the temperature differences which are taken
as limiting in the system.

ART CORE HYDRODYNAMICS

F. E. Lynch G. M. Winn
Reactor Experimental Engineering Division
G. L. Muller

Pratt & Whitney Aircraft

The experimental flow system for studying the
hydrodynamic characteristics of proposed ART
cores was completed, and several photographs of
particles and grids were made which yielded much
information about the apparatus but no quantitative
data. Some qualitative evidence for the existence
of two, and possibly three, regions of flow sepa-
ration in the ART core currently being tested
was obtained by visual observation. Additional
qualitative observations are continuing which are
soon to be supplemented with quantitative data,
but these preliminary observations indicate that
the core with ideal entrance conditions must be
considered to be unacceptable and that it will
be necessary to use vanes at the entrance.

It was found that sufficient light is available
to produce photographs of particles flowing with
the water at a Reynolds number of 100,000, al-
though at such high velocities the flash duration
is a little long. It is believed that this can be
remedied with a different flash tube, which is
being procured. In addition, these first photo-
graphs revealed the need for an additional light
source arranged to illuminate the particles con-
tinuously so that their tracks would represent a
line on the photograph. This is necessary to
reduce the uncertainty associated with identifying
the two images of each particle. A 1000-w incan-
descent projection bulb proved to be inadequate,
and arrangements are being made to test two
different mercury-vapor light sources; they will
increase the light intensity by a factor of 10 to
20, which should resolve the illumination problem.

Several details such as the quality of the grid
photographs, the settling velocity of the particles,
and the reliability of the Hewlett & Packard Co.
electric counter have received attention. A new
grid was made with much finer, shallower lines
than the first. The photographs of the new grid
were far superior to those of the old one, since

a much smaller area was obscured by the grid
. lines themselves. Inherent difficulties have beset
attempts to measure the settling velocity of the
particles; however, it can be said that the terminal

Wan

under gravity is certainly less than 0.2 cm/sec

and probably much less. Even this is only about

0.16% of the mean velocity which will be measured.

The Hewlett-Packard counter which measures the

time interval between flashes was adjusted; its

. absolute accuracy was checked; and it was found
to be satisfactory.

The design of another entrance section which
= will impart a rotational component of velocity to
the fluid as it flows through the test section has
been started, This will produce a velocity struc-
ture which is more realistic in terms of what is
envisaged for the ART, but it is much more
difficult to measure. It is conceivable that a
rotational component will help to reduce the
‘possible adverse thermal effect of separation
regions, perhaps by eliminating these regions.
The velocity distribution in a diverging channel
under turbulent flow conditions was studied with
the phosphorescent-particle technique. Flow
asymmetry at a half-angle of 4 deg was observed.
This angle is somewhat less than the 5-deg half-
angle given in the classical report on velocity
profiles in channels by Nikuradse.* A large flow-
visualization system that utilizes the phospho-
rescent particle and dye techniques for studying
fluid flow characteristics has nearly been com-
pleted.

volume heat sources within the fluids of experi-
mental forced-flow volume-heat-source systems,

An experimental study of the factors affecting
gas formation at an electrode-electrolyte interface
was carried out pursuant to the problem of gener-
ating volume heat sources electrically. The
generation of gas at an electrode was found to
be dependent upon the material of the electrode
and the current density and independent of the
applied potential, as well as the type of electro-
lyte employed. Platinum was found to have the
most desirable characteristic of conducting the
maximum amount of current per unit area of elec-
trode to an electrolyte for a given degree of gas
This effect is most probably the
result of an increased surface area because of
the known porosity of this metal. For brightly
polished platinum, a current density of approxi-
mately 8 amp/in.? was achieved before gas liber-
ation was noticeable. This value exceeded that
of Carpenter 20 stainless steel by two orders of
magnitude. Also, tests were carried out to study
the compatibility of the more common stainless
steels and dilute solutions of strong electrolytes
in those portions of an experimental volume-heat-
source system where no electric currents ore
flowing. Carpenter 20, type 347, and type 316
stainless steels were found to be accordant.

Concomitant with the problem of generating
uniform volume heat sources within annuli of

generation.

nonuniform cross section, a method for embedding
platinum electrodes to form a hydrodynamically
smooth surface has been developed. It has been
established that several of the new epoxy bonding

handling of the instruments and improve atmos-

Recent measurements made on NaF-ZrF,-UF,

It may be noted that the average values obtained
from the recent measurements are about 30% lower

However, when the preliminary measurements were
reported, only the more pessimistic, Brookfield

Fig. 8.4 that the agreement between the two instru-
ments for the recent measurements is much better
than for the earlier set of measurements. This
result is due to improved fluoride preparation and
handling techniques, as well as to the refined
viscometry methods.

9. RADIATION DAMAGE

J. B. Trice
Solid State Division

A. J. Miller
ANP Project

" The program of MTR irradiations of Inconel
capsules containing fluoride fuels has continued,
and the capsules examined thus far have revealed
no evidence of radiation damage. The horizontal
type of fuel-circulating loop designed for irradiation
in the LITR has been operated out-of-pile with a
non-uranium-bearing salt and is now being inserted
in the HB-2 facility of the LITR, A small loop suit-
able for vertical operation in the LITR lattice has
also been successfully bench tested, and a second
model for ‘in-pile operation is being constructed.
The creep test apparatus for testing Inconel at
high temperatures in the MTR is being bench
tested. The stress-corrosion apparatus for LITR

“operation has been successfully bench tested, and

an in-pile apparatus is being constructed.

Remote metallographic studies of solid fuel
elements were continued, and additional information
on’ the relationship between UO, particle size and
radiation damage was obtained,

MTR STATIC CORROSION TESTS

W. E. Browning G. W. Keilholtz
Solid State Division

H. L. Hemphill
Analytical Chemistry Division

The program of MTR irradiations of Inconel
capsules containing fused fluoride fuels has been
continued. Additional irradiations were carried out
on capsules containing NaF-ZrF ,-UF, (48.9-49.3-
1.79 mole %) and on capsules containing NaF-
ZrF,-UF, (50.1-48.2-1.74 mole %). These fuels
generate 1100 w/em® in the A-38 position in the
MTR. To date, five capsules in this series, three
with UF; and two with UF, fuels, have been

"successfully irradiated for a two-week period with

metal-liquid interface temperatures of 1500 + 50°F,
The capsules have been examined metallographi-
cally, and the fuels have been chemically analyzed.
One out-of-pile electrically heated control capsule
containing UF; and one containing UF, have also
been examined, and the fuel batches have been
chemically analyzed.

120

The irradiated UF ;-bearing capsules and one of

the irradiated UF ; capsules showed practically ro
corrosion — that is, they were similar to the control
capsules — while one irradiated UF ,-bearing cap-
sule, previously reported,! had subsurface voids
to a depth of 2 mils. There were no significant dif-
ferences in the iron, chromium, or nickel contents
of the irradiated fuels, as compared with the starting
fuel batches, and there was no evidence of segrega-
tion of either uranium or impurities. The chemical
analyses of the two out-of-pile controls that have
been examined to date were accidentally spoiled.
The uranium in the UF -bearing fuel analyzed not
less than 96% UF,, and the UF ,-bearing fuel

showed no trivalent uranium. In an attempt to de-

tect any minute radiation effects which might be
occurring, the irradiation period is being extended
to six weeks for the other capsules in this series,
Additional examinations were made of capsules
containing NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4 mole %) that
had been irradiated at a nominal temperature of
1620°F and had generated 2700 w/cm®. In this
series of irradiations, the in-pile temperature
history was quite complex. No evidence of chemi-
cal damage could be found in the fuel, and there
were no high concentrations of Inconel components.

“There was some corrosion evident, and therefore

out-of-pile control tests will be made in which the
in-pile temperature patterns will be duplicated
insofar as possible. New experiments with this
fuel are to be made in which more closely controlled
temperatures and planned temperature excursions
will be used.

The chemical analyses of samples of fuel taken
from irradiated Inconel capsules have at times
shown increases in iron such that the iron-to-
chromium ratio was greater than that found in the
Inconel, and therefore a series of radioactivation
analyses of the iron content in the irradiated fuel
was made; these analyses demonstrated that the
high values were due to contamination of the fuel

with unirradiated iron that had entered the fuel
during or after opening of the Inconel capsule. The
techniques developed by G. Smith (Analytical
Chemistry Division) are particularly adaptable to
the separation of minute amounts of iron (10 to 100
pg) from very large amounts of fission products.
Four samples of fuel from irradiated capsules
showed that between 70 and 99% of the iron came
from an unirradiated source, whereas samples from
an irradiated Inconel capsule showed that less than
6% of its iron content was not radioactive, Since
the amount of iron contamination involved is very
small (of the order of 50 pug), some possible sources
of contamination would include the steel drill used
to remove the fuel from the capsules and also the
impurities in the reagents used in preparing sample
solutions. In the future, samples will be obtained
by using a nonferrous drill, Unfortunately, radio-
activation techniques cannot be applied to analyses
for chromium and ‘nickel because of unfavorable
activation yields, insensitivity of detection, and
chemical separation difficulties associated with
trace amounts of these elements.

An improved and modified version of the capsule
irradiation facility is being put into service (Fig.
9.1). Before being shipped from ORNL, each
capsule is mounted in a sleeve which provides a
sufficiently large annulus for the passage of cooling
air between it and the capsule. The bottom of the

sleeve is tapered to fit an inside taper at the
bottom of the air tube in the MTR. The advantage
of this arrangement is that the capsule can be
fitted to the sleeve prior to insertion into the
reactor. Several tubes and capsules prepared with
this new arrangement have been used satisfactorily
in the MTR. In order to speed up the capsule
program, arrangements have been made for irradiating
two capsules simultaneously in separate, but
adjacent, facilities in the MTR.

An improved set of temperature controls fabricated
by the Instrumentation and Controls Division has
been subjected to dynamic performance tests by
using an electrically heated capsule. These tests
have shown that the new controls will maintain a
more constant temperature in the capsule during
irradiation,

EFFECT OF IRRADIATION ON UF -C,F

W. E. Browning G. W, Keilholtz
Solid State Division

Examinations were made of material from welded
nickel capsules that were filled under vacuum with
a UF -C,F, solution containing 20 wt % UF and
then irradiated in the ORNL Graphite Reactor and
in the Tower Shielding Facility, These irradiations
were made to determine the suitability of UF -
C,F, for use as fuel in a Lid Tank Shielding

Facility mockup of the circulating-fuel reactor.

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Three of the capsules were exposed to 1.1 x 107
nut. Gray-green solid residues which filled as
much as 90% of the volume were found in all the
capsules. The residues in the capsules exposed

oo “to a flux of 1. 1 x 1017 analyzed 92% uranium, and

“the residues in those exposed to a flux of 2.0 x
1018 analyzed 24% uranium. In the capsules given
the higher exposure, gas pressures of between 55
and 100 psi developed. Analyses of these gases
“showed about 30% CF, and about 25% C,F; the

remaining gas was unidentified.

"7" MINIATURE IN-PILE LOOP
. Bench Test

W. R. Willis M. F. Osborne
H. E. Robertson G. W. Keilholtz
Solid State Division

The first successful bench test of the miniature
in-pile loop designed for insertion in a vertical
hole in the LITR included four freezing and melting
cycles in 260 hr of operation. The loop was oper-
ated at 1466°F, The linear velocity of the fused
salt circulated in the loop was between 3.3 fps
(as calculated from the flowmeter) and 3.8 fps (as
calculated from the pump speed); thus a Reynolds
number of about 3000 was obtained. Since it was
possible to freeze and melt the fused salt without
causing failure of the loop, it may be advisable to
fill the in-pile loop before it is inserted in the
reactor and then melt the fuel mixture after the
loop is in position. Since, during the bench test,
the flowmeter was found to be temperature sensitive,
the dependence of the measurement on the temper-
‘ature must be established.

The bench test was terminated because of a leak
in a collar that was welded over a joint in the fuel
tube. The two ends of the loop did not butt together
_at this location, and the annular space thus formed
between the collar and the tube sections trapped
the fused salt in such a manner that expansion of
the salt caused the collar (not the weld) to rupture.
The metal collar stretched from 0.4 in. in diameter
to 0.5 in. before it ruptured. The salt from the
leak, which existed during operation for about 4
hr, showed a tendency to oxidize and to stick to
- the Inconel surface rather than to flow rapidly down
- the outside tube wall. Thus, a leak in the colder
portion of a loop that was operating in-pile would
"probably not flow downward into the high-flux

region before a safety alarm from the released
“radioactivity could scram the reactor.

122

A Delco motor from the group being used in bench
tests has been rebuilt to withstand radiation and
a higher temperature, The wire on both the rotor
and the stator was replaced with glass-insulated
wire. All paper was removed, and mica was used
in the commutator and in the rotor segments; glass
cloth was used, where possible, for other insula-
tion, These changes required that the shaft as-
sembly be slightly modified to allow more space
for windings. The rebuilt motor was tested during
the bench test of the miniature loop, and it was found
to be satisfactory. In a comparison of the operation
of the rebuilt motor with that of the original motor
under no load and under load conditions, the rebuilt
motor was found to be slightly more efficient than
the original motor. Furthermore, since the rebuilt
motor can withstand a higher ambient temperature
and since for a given voltage it produces a higher
speed, higher fuel velocities can be obtained than
were possible previously.

Heat Transfer Calculations

D. F. Weekes, Consultant

An extensive series of heat transfer calculations
has been carried out on the ORNL Reactor Controls
Computer in order to predict the thermal behavior
of a miniature in-pile circulating-fuel loop. The
derivations of appropriate differential equations
and the details of their solution are given in a
forthcoming report, The model finally adopted for
the calculations and for the in-pile loop is shown in
Fig. 9.2. It was assumed to be mounted in position
C-48 of the LITR, with the lower end at the location
of maximum thermal-neutron flux.® The maximum
power density in the fuel in position C-48 was
assumed to be 540 w/cm®.

The computer results were obtained for a variety

of different flow rates of fuel (NaF-ZrF -UF,,

53.5-40-6.5 mole %) and of cooling air expressed
as Reynolds number of the cooling air stream, Re ,

REMOVAL OF Xe!3% FROM
MOLTEN FLUORIDE FUELS

M. T. Robinson
Solid State Division

W. A. Brooksbank
Analytical Chemistry Division

D. E. Guss
USAF

The study, described previously,? for determining
whether Xe 135 would escape from ART-type purging
equipment rapidly enough to prevent serious poi-
soning was continued. It was realized at the time
this study was initiated that the ARE might answer
the question satisfactorily, but it was decided to
go ahead with experiments to measure the xenon
solubility under the more pertinent ART conditions.
lt was considered unlikely that 97% of the equi-
librium xenon would be removed from the ARE with.
out special purging equipment, and, yet, this is
what happened according to two independent sets
of calculations. During the initial stages of
reactor operation, data were obtained from a re-
activity calibration of the ARE regulating rod by
noting changes in rod position required to maintain
criticality as increments of U233 were added to the
fuel. The value of the rod was calculated to be
0.030 +0.006% Ak/in., which agrees well with the
preliminary value reported by J. L.. Meem (cf. Sec.
1, “‘Circulating-Fuel Aircraft Reactor Experiment”’).

When the ARE was operated for 25 hr at an esti-
mated 2 Mw, constant power was maintained by
adjustment of the regulating rod. At the end of
this period of operation, the rod had been withdrawn
an amount equivalent to a reactivity decrease of
0.015 + 0.003%. The expected decrease in reactivity
was calculated to be:

From burnup of U233 0.001%
From Sm '4? poisoning 0.008%
From Xe'35 poisoning 0.41%

Since over one-half the observed change in reactiv-
ity may be accounted for by burnup and Sm'4?
poisoning, the amount of Xe'35 retained in the fuel
was less than 1 to 2% of the amount expected.

Therefore, the ARE supplied evidence that the
rare gases escape readily from the fluoride fuels
under dynamic conditions, Since the amount of
xenon present in a circulating-fuel reactor is prob-
ably more than the amount produced in one complete
fuel cycle (50 sec in the ARE), the amount remain-
ing in the fuel will be measured by using an ARE
fuel sample for radiochemical comparison of the
concentration of the fission products (Sr8?, Cs'37,
and Ce 41) which come through rare-gas precursors
with those (Cs 3% and Zr%?) which do not.

The gamma-ray scintillation spectrometer to be
used for the experiments has been calibrated with
Cs'37, Na?2, and Hg2%3, and the equipment has
been tested with radioactive noble gases taken
from samples of off-gas from the iodine dissolver
used by the Radioisotopes Department of the
Operations Division, The gases used were pri-
marily Xe'33 and Xe'33, In order to prevent the
gamma rays from other short-lived nuclides from
competing unfavorably with those from Xe!3® and
thus making resolution of the Xe 3% isotope diffi-
cult, a charcoal adsorption column (0.190 in. in
diameter and 0.5 in. long) for delaying isotopes
such as those of krypton was tested at room temper-
ature by using Kr®> and the gamma-ray spectrometer.
It was found that the charcoal trap would delay
krypton isotopes for about 10 min (at a flow rate
of about 15 ecm®/min) and xenon isotopes for about

200 min, Thus the spectrometer would measure

only long-lived isotopes ‘such as Xe'35,

in the fuel and since it has no known rare-gas
precursor (if Kr®> exists, it probably has a very
short half life, say 1 or 2 sec), This isotope will
be used therefore as the basis for normalizing the
yields of the other radioisotopes to be studied.

Volatility of the rare gases will be examined by
studying the yields of S5r®? and of Cs'3’ which
come through 2.6-min Kr®? and 3.0-min Xe'%7,
respectively, Low yields for these two isotopes
would indicate high volatilities for their parents,
Kr89 and Xe 37, A further check of the experiments
will be made by using Ce'4!, a descendant of
3-sec Xe'4!, which should be retained in the fuel,
and Cs'3%, a shielded nuclide formed directly in
fission. Comparison of Zr?> with Cs'3% and Ce'4!
will give a measure of the loss of the important
alkali and rare-earth elements through adsorption
on metal surfaces, since Cs'3® and rare-earth
elements will be present only in trace quantities
but chemical zirconium will be present in very
large quantities, as mentioned above,

The data obtained from the ARE fuel sample will
be compared with similar data to be obtained from an
irradiated sample of NaF-ZrF ,-UF ,(50-46-4 mole %)
that will be maintained solid to retain all the fission
products. The cooling period for the irradiated
sample will be the same as that for the ARE fuel
sample.

joints has been poor, and therefore Dy-Chek is
being used in the inspection of all new welds.
The LITR Experiment Review Committee has ap-
proved the apparatus for irradiation, and the
necessary safety circuit for the LITR has been
completed.

In the bench tests the outside of the ‘specimen
was in air, rather than in sodium as it would be in
the in-pile apparatus. The tests were for periods
of 432 and 866 hr at 1500°F and a stress of 1500
psi. The specimen exposed for the longer time
showed roughly twice as many voids per unit area
on the sides of the tube stressed in tension and
compression as there were on the sides at zero
stress. The maximum depth of voids was about
0.001 in. It was also noticed that the etching (or
perhaps staining) characteristics of the salt-metal
interface were not the same for the stressed and
unstressed regions when etched in aqua regia.
The reproducibility of the creep data obtained was
not good, and therefore the specimen shape has

with 3-u particle size and the element with 15- to
44-u particle size showed that irradiation induced
greater final hardness in the elements with the
smallertpdrticle-size material (Figs. 9.5 and 9.6).
Four samples from the smaller-particle-size elements
showed cracking of the core without bending.
Since cracking did not occur in elements with
lower total burnups, it appears that the increased
burnup (29%), together with the small particle size,
can cause cracking of the core, as illustrated in

Fig. 9.5.

The research effort in analytical chemistry was
concentrated primarily on NaF-KF-LiF-base reactor
fuel, and, in particular, on analysis after it had
been utilized as- a solvent for the reduction of
UF, by U° to UF,. Tentative methods for the
determination of U° and UF; were developed.
Studies were continued on the determination of
oxygen as oxides in fluoride fuels. Development
work was completed on the determination of sulfur
in various reactor fuels and coolants and in off-
gases from the production of fluoride fuels. Be-
cause of the urgency of other activities, no further
work was done onthe determination of alkali metals

in NaF-KF-LiF-base fuels. !

The volumes of gas derived from reactions 1 and
2 are reproducible; 1.5 moles of CO is formed for
each mole of UH, decomposed when the ignition
is carried out at temperatures between 500 and
600°C, and 0.5 mole of CO is formed per mole of
UF, under similar conditions, The CO must be
removed from the effluent gases before the meas-
urement of hydrogen is made. This is accomplished
by passing the gases through a tube packed with
1,0; and powdered pumice, which is maintained at
< temperature of 150°C. The CO is oxidized to
CO, in the following reaction:

5C0 + 1,0, —> 5CO, + I,

When the method was tested by analyzing samples
of pure uranium metal, the hydrogen evolved
corresponded to 97% of the theoretical value with
a coefficient of variation of 2%. Satisfactory
precision has also been obtained for the deter-
mination of U° in NaF-KF-LiF-base fuels and in
UF ,. The concentration limits of the methcds have
not been measured experimentally, but, on the
basis of the quantities measured, concentrations of
U° as low as 0.05% may be determined when l-g

samples are utilized.

Since the 1,0, tubes may become inactivated
after only limited service, a more dependable
method of eliminating the CO is needed. In a

chloride, TiCl,, and methylene blue, C, ¢H1sN3SClL
Of these reagents, methylene blue appears to be
the most promising reagent for a possible routine
method for the determination.

Cupric Chloride (CuCl,). Previous attempts to

oxidize UF; by Cu(ll) in H,SO, solution were un-
successful. Since the formal oxidation potential of
the [Cu(ll),Cu()] couple is increased in solutions
of high chloride concentration, experiments were
performed to ascertain whether quantitative oxida-
tion of trivalent uranium could be achieved by
adjusting the acidity and chloride concentration of
the CuCl, solvent solution.
Samples of UF, were dissolved under an atmos-
here of CO, in acidic solutions of NaCl which
contained a “measured excess of a standard solu-
tion of CuCl,. After dissolution of the samples,
the unreduced. CuCl, was determined iodometrically
and the trivalent anivm was calculated on the
basis of the stoichiometry of the equation

Cut + US*—> Cut + U4*

When the dissolution was carried out in a solu-
tion 1 M in HCl and 2 M in NaCl, the results were
in agreement with those obtained by the hydrogen
evolution method.?2 Lower values were obtained
when either the chloride concentration or the
acidity was altered.

Samples of UF, which had been fused with NaF-
KF-LiF evolved hydrogen and subsequently
yielded low results when analyzed by the above-
described procedure. The method therefore appears
to be of limited applicability.

Titanium Tetrachloride (TiCl ,). It was found that
UF, dissolved without evolution of hydrogen in
solutions of TiCl, in concentrated HCl to yield
dark-brown solutions of TiCl.. The color of these
solutions, when diluted, reverts to the rose tint
usually associated with Ti{lll) solution. When
these diluted solutions are titrated with a standard
solution “of K,Cr,0,, the equivalents which are

consumed at the first sharp change in potential

correspond to about 95% of the trivalent uranium
as determined by the hydrogen evolution method.
If the solutions are then heated to a temperature
of 90°C, the total uranium can be determined by
oxidizing UY) to U(VI) with further addition of

the dichromate solution.

While this is the only method which has been
found to give a titration for trivalent uranium
without subsequent back-titration of excess
oxidant, it is not readily adaptable to routine
analysis because of the slow equilibrium of the
electrode potentials and the rapid oxidation of
titanous solution by air after the dilution of the
concentrated acid solutions. Experiments are now
being conducted to determine whether the TiCl,
can be titrated in the concentrated acid with
bromine which is generated coulometrically.

End points obtained potentiometrically in the
concentrated solutions were found to be poorly
defined, but sharp breaks with potential changes
of about 400 mv were obtained: with polarized
platinum electrodes.  Titrations between 5 and
10% in excess of the theoretical value were
obtained when UF, samples were titrated cou-
lometrically. This excess titration is probably a
result of diffusion of TiCl, from the cathode com-
partment, ’

Methylene Blue. A proposed method based on
the oxidation of trivalent uranium to the tetravalent
state by methylene blue was developed for the
determination of UF, in a fluoride fuel. In the
proposed procedure, the sample is dissolved in a
measured volume of 0.02 N methylene blue solution
in 3 to 6 N HCI under an atmosphere of CO, by
stirring for 2 hr at room temperature. The excess
methylene blue is then titrated to its reduced
state, methylene white, with 0.05 N chromous
sulfate solution. The equations involved in the
determination are as follows:

2U3* + methylene blue + 2HY — 2U4*

+ methylene white

2Cr?* + methylene blue + 2H*—> 2Cr3*
+ methylene white

Because of the intense color of the dye, the
visual end point, blue to green, is sharp and re-
producible even when the titrations are carried out
with 0.025 N chromous sulfate.

For the determination of trivalent uranium in
UF, the coefficient of variation is approximately
1%, and the results are in excellent agreement with
those obtained by the hydrogen evolution method. ?
While somewhat poorer precision was obtained in
the analyses of NaF-LiF-KF-UF,-UF, samples,
the variations were probably a result of hetero-
geneous sampling, as is also indicated by the

or and the volume of the solution.

irreproducibility of determinations by the hydrogen
evolution method.” In the analyses of some of the
NaZrF ,-UF, samples, low results were obtained
because the samples were not completely dissolved
in 6 N HCI.

The methylene blue procedure requires less
operational time than the hydrogen evolution
method, and, for the samples which have been
tested, it appears to give results of comparable
precision and accuracy. Tests are being conducted
to determine the extent of the reactions between
methylene blue and uranium hydride, uranium
metal, and other metallic contaminants of the
fluoride samples.

‘In order to carry out subsequent determinations
of the total uranium concentration on the same
samples, the final solutions from the methylene
‘blue determination were titrated with oxidizing
agents, Titrations with Ce(lV) and Fe(lll) solu-
tions did not yield stoichiometric end points.
Although the reaction with K Cr 0, was extremely
slow, two well-defined potentiometric end points
were obtained when the solutions were titrated
slowly. The second of these end points corre-
sponded to the reoxidation of methylene white to
methylene blue plus the oxidation of the U(IV) to
U(VI). The stoichiometry of the first break in the
potential curve has not yet been accurately de-
fined, but it appears to be consistent with the
oxidation of U(lV) to U(V). Further investigation
is under way to elucidate the nature of these
changes in potential.

is used, a concentration of 1% water corresponds
to 235 mg of oxygen. From the above linear
relation the calibration curve can be extended to
concentration ranges too low for direct measure-
ment by weighed primary standards.

At the temperatures at which liquid HF could be
safely maintained in the reaction vessel, the rate
of the reaction between metallic oxides such as
Uo, and HF was found to be too slow for applica-
tion to analytical measurements. The oxides were
found to react rapidly with fused KHF, according
to the postulated reaction

4KHF, + UO, —> UF, + 4KF + 2H,0

The procedure has been modified accordingly to
carry out the dissolution of the sample in molten
KHF ,.

In the revised procedure, the sample is mixed
with about five times its weight of anhydrous
potassium fluoride, KF, in a platinum crucible.
The crucible is then placed in the reaction vessel
and the KF is converted to the acid salt by trans-
ferring a portion of the HF acid from the conduc-
tivity cell to the reaction vessel. After the excess
HF has been returned to the cell, the KHF, is
fused by heating the reaction vessel to about
300°C, The water is then transferred to the con-
ductivity cell for measurement by repeated distilla-
tions with portions of HF.

Because part of the KF was carried over to the
cell during the distillation, the original apparatus
was modified by placing a silver-lined vessel,
which is similar in design to a Kjeldahl trap,
directly above the reaction vessel. The revised
procedure is now being tested on pure samples of

presence of sulfur. A colorimetric method? was
adapted to determine the concentration of sulfur
quantitatively. In this method, sulfur is released
from solution as H,S by acidification with HCl.
The gas is adsorbed in a solution of zinc acetate
solution, and, upon the further addition of ferric
ammonium sulfate, a reaction occurs between
the organic reagent and sulfur to form methylene
blue, an intensely colored dye. The absorbancy
of the solution of methylene blue is measured with
“a photometer at 670 mu. The method is extremely
sensitive with a workable range of from 5 to 50 pug
‘per 100 ml of solution. This range corresponds to
a practical lower limit of determination of about
1 part of sulfur per million parts of sodium.

Analyses of the sodium revealed that the sulfur
was not uniformly distributed. In particular spots,
‘the concentration was of the order of 0.1 to 1% or
higher. The sulfur content of the sodium sampled
from the bulk of the trap was, however, much lower,
50 to 100 ppm, and that of the sodium in the system
was less than 1 ppm. These results indicate that
sulfur in sodium precipitates rapidly as sodium
sulfide and can be effectively trapped and removed
from the system. The solubility of sodium sulfide
in sodium is evidently extremely small.

Sulfur in Fluoride Salt Mixtures. The presence
of sulfur in mixtures of fluoride salts which are
being considered as proposed reactor fuels is con-
sidered deleterious, principally from the standpoint
of corrosion. The major problem in determining
‘sulfur in fluorides is that sulfur exists in at least
two oxidation states, sulfate and sulfide, and, in
order to adapt the methylene blue colorimetric
method, the sulfate must be reduced to the sulfide.
The reducing mixture recommended by Johnson
and Nishita® for sulfate in soils is used for this
purpose. About 1 g of the fluoride mix is heated
at the boiling point with 4 ml of a reducing mixture
composed of 15 g of red phosphorus, 100 ml of
hydriodic acid, and 75 ml of formic acid, Reduction
of the sulfate is complete within 30 min, and
then the colorimetric method can be utilized. When
sulfur is found in fluoride mixtures, the principal
‘portion of the sulfur is in the form of sulfate rather
than sulfide, as might be expected.

Sulfur in H,-HF Gas Streams. The odor of H,$S
has often been noted in gas streams in. the fuel
production work. Two sources of this sulfur are
known: sulfate contaminant in fluoride salts and
fluorosulfonic acid, HSO,F, in hydrogen fluoride.
Sulfur from the first source is known to be of the
order of a few parts per million. A test of the
sulfur content of hydrogen fluoride was made by
dissolving the gas in a solution of NaOH, deter-
mining sulfur in the solution by boiling the basic
solution in the presence of H,0,, and precipitating
the sulfate as BaSO, with BaCl,. The sulfur

concentration was 2.7 mg per liter of HF.

A semiquantitative method for determining sulfur
as sulfide in off-gas from fuel production was set
up in which the gas was passed through a 6%
solution of NaOH. An equal volume of bismuth
nitrate in glacial acetic acid was- added to the
scrub solution, and the turbidity, as a result of
formation of Bi,S,, was compared with previously
prepared standards. The procedure was made more
precise by measuring the absorbancy of the turbid
solution at 350 my in a 7.5-cm cell with a total

volume equal to the volume of the test solution. .

The concentration of sulfur found by this pro-
cedure ranged from 2 to 35 pg per liter of off-gas.

investigation was continued on the feasibility of
a spectrophotometric titration of fluoride based on

Zirconium alizarin sulfonate and zirconium Erio

A titration cell based on the design of Sweetser
and Bricker® was fabricated so that the Beckman
Model DU spectrophotometer could be usedto meas-
ure absorbancy. Although the data have not yet
been thoroughly evaluated, the technique does not
appear to be feasible for application to NaF-KF-
LiF-base fuels because of the slowness with
which equilibrium is reached. The procedure will
be evaluated before further work is done.

PETROGRAPHIC INVESTIGATIONS OF
FLUORIDE FUELS

G. D. White, Metallurgy Division
T. N. McVay, Consultant

Petrographic examinations were made of several
hundred samples of fluoride melts. The majority of
the samples were from alkali fluoride systems con-
taining UF ,.

When small amounts of UF, (<20 mole %) are
melted with NaF-KF-LiF, KF-NaF, or KF, a red
‘compound is formed which is thought to be K,UF,.
In melts which contain only KF and UF, this com-
pound is isotropic. However, in the two with NaF
present, the compound exhibits slight anisotropism.
This is thought to be due to a slight solubility of
NaF in the K,UF ..

Some work was done on the systems KF-LaF,,
NaF-LaF,, and RbF- LaF. The first two systems
contain colorless, 1:1 compounds which are uni-
axial positive with refractive indices in the
vicinity of 1.50. The system RbF- LaF, contains
a 1:1 compound which is biaxial positive with a
moderate optic angle and refractive indices also

near 1.50.

returned “o a diffusion plant or made into heter-
ogeneous fuel elements, additional decontamination
must be obtained. This may be accomplished by
adding a complete UF, fractional distillation step
to the procedure shown in Fig. 11.1.

This method of uranium recovery and decon-
tamination can also be used for processing heter-
ogeneous reactor fuel elements of the type that
can be dissolved in fused fluoride salt by means
of hydrogen fluoride.  Compactness of plant,
operation at atmospheric pressure, and economical
waste disposal are some of the advantages of this
type of process.

FISSION-PRODUCT REMOVAL

Three methods have been tested for removing
fission products from the UF ,-F, mixture obtained
by fluorination of a uraniumecontaining fused
fluoride salt: scrubbing the gas with a molten salt
(NaF-ZrF,), scrubbing the gas with C.F, and
passing the gas through a solid NaF absorbent
bed at650°C, Of the three methods, NaF absorption
is the best; it gives an over-all gross beta decon-
tamination factor of more than 104,

Use of a molten salt scrub, NaF-ZrF, (56-44
mole %) at 650°C, followed by sublimation, for
removing fission-product activity from the UF,
product of the fluorination step gave, as reported
previously,’ over-all decontamination factors of
2 x 10 and 430 to 750 for gross beta and ruthenium
beta activities, respectively. However, in the
scrub step alone, the decontamination factor for
the ruthenium, which is by far the most important
volatile activity in the long-cooled material, was
only 6, as shown by determination of the ruthenium
in the molten salt. In a repetition of this experi-
ment, the ruthenium decontamination factor in the
scrub step was only 2 (run 1, Table 11.1), and the
over-all ruthenium decontamination factor was 350.

. reactor entirely. Ruthenium and niobium plated
s out heavily on the metal walls of the reactor. The
distribution ratio between metal wall and salt was
about 5 for ruthenium activity and less than 0.01
for niobium activity.

The behavior of plutonium in the fused salt
fluoride-volatility process is important inprocessing
fuel that has a high proportion of U238, The
results of many fluorination runs at 650°C show
, that only about 0.01% of the plutonium is carried

over with the UF ( product.

Further study was carried out on the absorption
. of UF, in NaF.ZtF, (56-44 mole %) at 650°C.
In one trial, 9 g of UF, was absorbed in 30 g of
NaF-ZrF , in 1 hr with no noticeable loss. How-
ever, passage of helium through the fused salt,
either concurrently with or after the UF; addition,
produced considerable fuming. A positive test for
fluorine with potassium iodide paper was obleined,

properties of the liquid could not be demonstrated
by a simple correlation of friction factor with
Reynolds number, such as js found in ordinary
fluid flow through pipes. The acetylene tetra-

liquid phase was induced by a gas rate of 9.5 cfm

assembled to verify these conclusions with molten

APPLICATIONS OF FUSED SAL T~VOLATILITY
PROCESSES

A long-range study has been made to survey the
over-all feasibility of fused salt-volatility tech-
niques in the chemical processing of ARE-type
reactor fuels and certain types of heterogeneous
reactor fuel elements. The volumes of radioactive
waste from such processes should be much lower
than those from the aqueous processes, and
processing costs should be low, even though a
means of disposing of excess fluorine will have
to be provided. Total chemical costs, which in
present aqueous processes represent approximately
10% of operating costs, have been estimated to be
20¢ per gram of U235, The operational procedure
is much simpler, and the equipment should be
inexpensive, even though nickel will be required
as the material of construction.

standpoint of both operational and corrosion prob-
lems but is efficient and rapid in the high-tempera-

ture liquid medium of fused fluoride salts.

Aircraft Reactor Fuels

The recovery and reprocessing schedule for
fluid-fuel aircraft reactors will probably be dictated
by aircraft reactor and turbine maintenance sched-
ules rather than by the rate of formation of neutron
poisons. It is anticipated that operation will
follow a schedule such as: (1) one day of oper-
ation and one day of downtime for an accumulation

“of seven operating days, (2) seven days of downtime

for minor maintenance, (3) repetition of this sched-
ule until 1000 operating hours have been accumu-
lated, After 1000 hr of operation, the entire reactor

will be dumped and the fuel will be reprocessed.

The anticipated cooling period before repro-

cessing will be 10 days to allow decay of short-

lived activities. The minimum decontamination
factor required for the process would be approxi-
mately 100 for poison removal only. The other
steps in fuel makeup can easily be handled remotely,

The following essential steps are used in the
chemical processing (Fig. 11.2). First, the UF,
in the molten fuel mixture is fluorinated to volatile
UF by introducing a 10-fold excess of elemental
fluorine to achieve separation and partial decon-
tamination from the other fuel components and
fission products; second, the UF, is reduced to
UF, with hydrogen in the gas phase in the Y
reactor, as designed by K-25; and third, the re-
sulting UF, is added to 2 moles of NaF to prepare
a fuel concentrate for subsequent return to the
reactor. Presentknowledge of this systemindicates
that all steps are adaptable for radioactive remote
operation. Considerable engineering development
and operational experience have been obtained
with the second and third steps, while extended
laboratory development has indicated the feasibility
of the direct fluorination of the molten fuel mixture.

Heterogeneous Reactor Fuels

The separation of U23% from zirconium alloy
fuel elements is currently the most promising

application of the fluoride process to fixed fuel

element reactors. The dissolution rate of zirconium

‘with HF in the NaF- ZrF , fused salt is very high,

that is, 22 to 35 mils/hr (Table 11.4). The range

is probably due to metallurgical differences.

138

Although the ratio of zirconium to uranium is very
high in STR elements, the cost of HF to dissolve
zirconium will be only 5¢ per gram of U233, A
probable method for zirconium separation as a
guide for process development is indicated by the
flow diagram shown in Fig. 11.3. This flow sheet
is similar to that for fluid-fuel processing, but it
includes hydroflucrination of the fuel element in a

The Monte Carlo method was used for two calcu-

composite slab shields and the heating in beryllium
slabs resulting from gamma rays in an adjacent
source, In addition, a three-parameter mathematical
formulation of the variation of radiation-induced
injury to pilots of nuclear-powered aircraft with
time after exposure was derived, and analyses

. were made of the preliminary differential experi-

ments and of the first experiments with the GE-ANP

ENERGY ABSORPTION RESULTING FROM
INCIDENT GAMMA RADIATION AS A FUNCTION
" OF THICKNESS OF MATERIALS
WITH SLAB GEOMETRY

C. D. Zerby

The interaction of radiation with the atomic
particles of matter results in an energy transfer to
the particles or in the creation of secondary radie-
tion. The secondary radiation, in turn, is usually
absorbed close to the primary interaction. With

" high radiation intensity, the absorption of radiation

energy in biological shields or in structural members
can be important, Since essentially all the energy
absorbed becomes heat, problems of induced thermal
stresses in already stressed structural members
may well determine design limitations, The heating
effect may also be a limiting design factor in some
cases ‘in which material strength is seriously de-
pendent on temperature, In all cases some knowi-
edge of the energy absorption distribution within a
material is necessary. Only a preliminary study of
heating in beryllium has been completed thus far,
and results are reported here.

Most radiation absorption problems can be at
least approximated by known analytical methods.
For the gomma radiation absorption distribution,
however, solution of the Boltzmann transport equa-
tion is necessary for accuracy. At NDA, extensive
calculations have been carried out® to solve the
transport equation for the penetration of gamma
rays. The NDA calculations included the energy
absorption as a function of position for a point
isotropic source,® but it was not possible to in-
clude the absorption distribution for plane slabs.
At ORNL, the total energy absorption of incident
gamma radiation in the different materials of finitely
thick composite slabs was also calculated,? but,
again, the calculation did not include the absorption
distribution,

‘In this study the Monte Carlo method is being
used for the calculation of the energy absorption
distribution in finitely thick slabs, and the calcu-
lations are programmed for solution on the ORACLE

at ORNL. For a monodirectional beam of mono-
energetic photons on a slab of material of finite
thickness, the energy absorption was calculated
in every interval of 0.10 in, through the slab. The
absorption included the energy transmitted to the
material in a scattering collision as well as that
transmitted in an absorption collision; in every
case the photon was followed until it was reflected
from the slab, was absorbed, or had penetrated the
slab, The scattering cross sections were calcu-
lated with the use of the Klein-Nishina scattering-
cross-section formula,® while the absorption cross
sections were obtained by empirical fits to published
data,®

A 9-in.-thick slab of beryllium was used, and the
incident photons were considered to have energies
of 0.5, 1.5, and 5.0 myc? and to be normally incident.
For the 1.5-myc? case, angles of incidence of 30,
60, and 85 deg were also investigated (1 myc?
= 0.51 Mev).

The results obtained for the normally incident
0.5-myc? photons on the slab of beryllium are shown
in Fig. 12.3, The histogram indicates the statistical
nature of the Monte Carlo solution, while the smooth
curve is a fit, by eye, to the data, The values
given on the histogram are the averages of the
values for the 0.10-in, intervals. In the future it is
intended that a rigorous method of fitting the data
will be employed. The area under the curve is the
total energy absorption.

It may be noted that the half life of the reparable

"appears to constitute 90% of the total.

~~ Other formulations are suggested to take account
of other phenomena, such as enhancement of sensi-
tivity by previous doses, Nothing basic to the
biology of the problem is intended; rather, it is
suggested that if the restrictive planning chart is
satisfactory for airplane design and strategic plan-
ning, then the formulation should also be satis-
factory from a biological point of view, Since it
is much more flexible than the chart, it would be
much more useful for interpretation of actual radia-
tion schedules in terms of injury.

This same model predicts that the AEC laboratory
tolerance doses administered over a 30-year period
give the same injury as does an instantaneous
dose of about 60 rem. These numbers are not in-
consistent with presently accepted concepts.

ANALYSIS OF SOME PRELIMINARY
DIFFERENTIAL EXPERIMENTS

M. F. Valerino!3

In order to investigate the adequacy of simple

analytical models proposed for describing some of

the neutron transport processes involved in the

aircraft divided-shield concept, some of the data

obtained in the preliminary differential experi-
ments'® at the TSF have been examined. Only
thermal-neutron measurements have been made.

The thermal-neutron flux measured at the rear of
the detector tank as a function of the angle 0 (angle
between the reactor axis of symmetry and the
source-detector axis) for a 65-ft reactor-detector
separation distance and a 195-ft altitude is shown
in Fig. 12.6. The flux is plotted relative to that
for 8 = 0 deg and is compared with a curve of the
direct beam flux to be expected at the detector, as
calculated on the basis of the total water thickness
between the reactor surface and the detector. In
the calculation of the direct beam flux the leakage
neutrons were assumed to have a cosine distribu-
tion at the reactor surface, and the attenuation
lengths were based on Lid Tank Shielding Facility
(LTSF) data corrected to give the point-to-point
material attenuation kernel. The calculated curve
agrees well with the experimental curve for angles
up to 45 deg. Beyond the 45-deg angle, the calcu-
lated flux drops off rapidly, and at 90 deg the direct
beam is gone, The measured flux for 6 = 90 deg
must hence be presumed to be due to air-scattered
neutrons only, Single-scatter theory calculations
have not yet been performed for the case of a beam
whose axis of symmetry is at an angle with the
source-detector axis, and hence it was not possible
to calculate the magnitude of the air scattering to
be expected.

In order to estimate the air scattering into the
rear of the detector tank, the air-scattered flux

measurements taken at the side of the detector tank
were considered. For 0 = 90 deg, the experiments
indicate that the scattering into the side and that
into the rear of the detector tank are approximately
equal. If it is assumed that this is nearly true for
angles between 45 and 90 deg, the air scattering
into the rear can be estimated from the measure-
ments at the side. When the air-scattered neutron
flux estimated in this manner is added to the
calculated direct beam flux, the dashed curve in
Fig. 12.6 is obtained. The fair agreement between
the dashed curve and the measured curve indicates
that the simple model used to calculate the angle
of distribution of the leakage neutrons from the
shield surface may be adequate for divided-shield
design.

Figure 12.7 represents an attempt to compare the
measurements of the air scattering into the side of

when the beam is pointed directly towards the
detector tank, that is, for 6 = 0 deg. Hence, the
ordinate is a measure of the fraction of the beam
scattered into the sides of the detector tank. The
abscissa is the beam direction 6. The points indi-
cated by the experiments for 6 = 30 and 90 deg were
obtained by extrapolation of the fluxes measured
in the water to give the extrapolated surface.values.
The measured relaxation lengths were used in the
extrapolation; no relaxation length measurements
were made for 6 = 0 deg, and therefore this pro-
cedure could not be used for this angle. The only
single-scatter calculation presently available is for
0 = 0 deg, and it is based on the assumption of a
2n-isotropic detector, that is, an isotropic detector
with one hemisphere shielded. This calculation
gives a value of 0.048 for 0 = 0 deg, which is to be
compared with the values indicated by the experi-
ments of 0.063 for 6 = 30 deg and 0.048 for 6 = 90
deg. As the beam is rotated from 30 to 0 deg, it is
nearly cut in half insofar as scattering into the one
side of the detector tank is concerned, and this
should result in a decrease of the scattering into
the one side of the detector tank. The scattered
flux measurements taken within the water show
this to be the case. The point calculated by
single-scatter theory for 8 = 0 deg appears to agree
with the points obtained from the experiment for

= 30 and 9 = 90 deg. However, it should be
cautioned that the fair agreement indicated in the
figure could be fortuitous. [In the comparison, the
assumption is involved that the thermal flux re-
sulting from a given fast-neufron current into the
side of the detector tank is the same for air-scattered
neutrons as for direct-beam neutrons. Also, some
Uncertainties ¢ are introduced in ‘the extrapolation of

 

the thermal flux to obtain the surface value.

200 ft are relatively free from a background of
ground-scattered neutrons,

In each experiment the neutron flux reaching a
BF, detector placed inside the detector tank and
near a side wall was measured as the altitudes of
the source and the detector were varied simul-
taneously from the ground to 200 ft. The only
major difference between the two experiments was
the shielding placed around the TSF reactor. In
the first case the reactor was placed in the reactor
tank at a distance (p) of 45 ecm from the tank wall
and a reactor angle (6) of 330 deg from the source-
detector axis; '4 in the second case the reactor
was placed in a mockup of the GE-ANP R-1 shield
design (see ‘TSF Experiment with the Mockup of
the GE-ANP R-1 Shield Design,’’ in Sec. 15).

In order to estimate the actual ground-scattered
contribution at the 200-ft altitude, attempts were
made to analytically separate the experimental
measurements into their air- and ground-scattered
components. A calculation'® of the number of
neutrons singly scattered into a point isotropic
detector as a function of the solid angle in which
they had left the source had been made previously
for the case of infinite height. Also, a calculation!”
of the number of air-scattered neutrons lost because
of the presence of the ground and the number of
ground-scattered neutrons reaching the detector as
a function of source solid angle and altitude had
been made. All three calculations assumed single
isotropic scattering, air attenuation, and a separation
distance of 64 ft.18

The integration over the source solid angle to
obtain curves of air and ground scattering as a
function of altitude was ‘weighted in each case by

This normalized curve was then used to subtract
the air-scattered contribution from the experimental
measurements at lower altitudes, and thus a series

tained. A fit of the calculated ground-scattering

A measurement of the removal cross section of
lithium was made at the Lid Tank Shielding Fa-
cility (LTSF), and the experimentation on the
GE-ANP helical air ducts was continued. Prepa-
rations for the circulating- fuel reflector-moderated
reactor and shield mockup tests are nearing com-

EFFECTIVE NEUTRON REMOVAL CROSS
SECTION OF LITHIUM

~ G. T. Chapman
J. M. Miller C. L. Storrs!

An effective neutron removal cross section (og)
of 1.01 % 0.04 barns was determined for lithium at
the LTSF. This. value was obtained from measure-
ments made in a “medium of oil behind a slab of
metallic lithium which was placed against the
source plate.

The slab of lithium (p = 0.53 g/cm? ) was con-
sfructed by filling a 122-cm-dia by 29.1-cm stain-
less steel tank with melted lithium and allowing
the material to “solidify. The walls of the tank
were reinforced with a framework constructed of
6-in. l-beams to assure that they would remai
parallel during the pouring and ‘solidifying p
esses. Figure 13. 1 is a schematic diagram of ‘the

The presence of the Inconel resulted in a 9-Mev
capture gamma ray,? and the photoneutron contri-
bution from this high-energy gamma and the
naturally occurring deuterium in the oil markedly
affected the thermal-neutron measurements in oil
(no lithium present) for distances greater than
120 cm from the source (Fig. 13.2). A 3.81-cm-
thick bismuth slab placed in the oil approximately
45 cm from the source suppressed this gamma ray
and the resulting photoneutrons without any ob-
servable effect on any other component of the
thermal-neutron flux.

The lithium tank was then placed in the oil tank

adjacent to the source, and thermal-neutron flux

these measurements the value of 1.01 * 0.04 barns
was calculated for the removal cross section of
lithium by the procedure presented below.

All previous removal-cross-section measurements
were made in water. In order to verify that a
correction to a water medium would not be neces-

sary for these measurements, thermal-neutron
 medsurements were also made in oil behind a
madterial which had a op predetermined in water.

larger than, and concentric with, the LTSF source
plate. The measurements were made behind the
tank in the LTSF water.

As indicated in Fig. 13.6, the presence of the
35 ducts in the gamma shield increased the
thermal-neutron flux by a factor of approximately
3000. In the medium of plain water, the flux was
increased by a factor of 300. For the water
medium the increase in flux seems to be consistent
with a calculation which takes into account only
the reduced density of the attenuating medium.
For the case in which the ducts were in the gamma
shield, the neutron streaming in the ducts appears
to be relatively more important. The latter is not
surprising, since the addition of the steel in-
creases the attenuation of the medium to neutrons
as well as to gamma rays.

The fast-neutron dose rates beyond the 35-duct
array both in a medium of water and in the Raschig
ring—borated water medium are shown in Fig. 13.7.
The gamma-ray dose rate beyond the gamma shield
without the ducts is compared in Fig. 13.8 with
that beyond the shield with the 35 ducts. The
presence of the ducts increased the gamma dose
rate by a factor of approximately 160.

It was previously reported? that the radiation
decomposition in samples of a solution of UF
in C,F,, was found to be too great for use of the
liquid as the simulated fuel in the LTSF mockups
of the circulating-fuel reflector-moderated reactor.
It is now planned to use solid UQ, in the form of
enriched uranium—aluminum MTR-type fuel plates.
A mechanical system has been developed so that
a continuous series of plates can be mounted on
a sprocket-driven chain-link belt. The uranium
will be moved on this belt from the neutron
window, where it will be irradiated, to the heat
exchanger region, and back to the window. The
speed of the belt can be varied so that a complete
transit will be made in a minimum of ¥ sec and
a maximum of 4 sec. The system will be tested
under operating conditions in a special rig outside
the LTSF. Other preparations for the tests are

~~ being completed.

For much cf the time during the last quarter the
Bulk Shielding Facility (BSF) was shut down for
modifications to the reactor pool. The modifi-
cations were being made to permit the use of
demineralized water in the reactor pool in order
to eliminate corrosion of the reactor fuel elements.
The set of high-power fuel elements which had

"previously been operating in process water that
had been treated by chromate addition had to be
discarded, even though burnup of the uranium in
‘these elements was negligible, because of the
extent of pitting of the aluminum’ cladding. In
order to utilize demineralized water, the pool was
cleaned and painted, and all steel was either
removed or sprayed with a stainless steel pro-
tective layer. A bypass demineralizer is being
installed to maintain the water purity, The
measurement reported below was made by members
of the BSF staff in other facilities.

A SEARCH FOR SHORT-HALF-LIFE NUCLEAR
ISOMERS IN x37, Rb85, Rb87, AND 2:90

R. W. Peelle
E. C. Campbell F. C. Maienschein

Rubidium, potassium, and zirconium are among
materials which have been considered as fuel
components for reactor systems in which the fuel
is circulated. Any short-period isomeric gamma-
ray transitions would complicate the shielding of
the external fuel loop, especially if the gamma
rays were of high energy. Rubidium was previ-
ously known to possess a low-energy isomeric
transition with a half life of about 1 min, but
measurements had not been made which would
reveal any shorter period that might be present.

Electromagnetically enriched K3?, Rb&5, and
Rb87 in the form of nitrates were injected into
the ORNL Graphite Reactor by use of a fast

 

1 Part time.

pneumatic probe assembly designed by E. C.
Campbell. Since the samples were ejected from
the center of the reactor within about 0.1 sec from
the end of the bombardment, it was possible to
moke a search for very short-period activities.
The ejected sample was viewed by a thallium-
activated sodium iodide scintillation-crystal
gamma-ray detector. The signal from the photo-
multiplier was transmitted by coaxial cables to
a multichannel differential pulse-height analyzer
located at the BSF. In addition, the counting rate
of any part of the spectrum could be measured as
a function of time with a linear count-rate meter
and a very fast Brown recorder. Thus both
spectral and time decay analyses of gamma radi-
ation emitted by the irradiated sample were ob-
tainable.

A study of K39 yielded no short-period activity.
In the rubidium isotopes the previously known
radiations were found, but no shorter period
isomers were discovered. Isomers with an ap-
preciable energy and cross section would have
been detected if they had had a half life greater
than about 0.03 sec. A sample of Rb®% was found
to contain the known 550 + 6-kev transition, with
a 1.05 + 0.05-min period, and bombardment of
Rb87 produced the known Rb®8 activity.

The apparatus described above was also used
in the discovery of a number of new isomeric
transitions with half periods? between 0.05 and
5 sec. One of these is Zr?%”, which yields a
2.30 + 0.03-Mev gamma ray with a half life of
about 0.83 + 0.03 sec. This isomer is produced
by inelastic neutron scattering.’

‘thus far has also included thermal-neutron flux and
some’ gamma-ray dose rate measurements in the
TSF detector tank located a horizontal distance of
64 ft from the reactor shield. This work was in-
‘ferrupted for a period of two and one-half weeks so

“that the TSF could participate in an Air Force

TSF EXPERIMENT WITH THE MOCKUP OF
THE GE-ANP R-1 SHIELD DESIGN

T. V. Blosser J. Van Hoomissen

D. L. Gilliland F. N. Watson

The mockup of the GE-ANP R-1 reactor shield
design (Fig. 15.1) is being used at the TSF for a
series of measurements. Fast-neutron and gamma-
ray dose rates were measured around the reactor
shield section while it was submerged in water in
the reactor handling pool. In addition, thermal-
neutron flux and gamma-ray dose rate measurements
have been made in the detector tank located a
fixed horizontal distance from the reactor shield.

The reactor loading for this experiment (Fig.
15.2) was a 5 x 7 fuel element array which gave a
‘symmetrical power distribution throughout the re-
actor. In order to avoid excess reactivity, a fuel

“element was removed from the center of each of
“the two seven-element faces. The measurements

were compared with similar measurements made
earlier at the BSF.! Co Co

In general, the BSF and TSF data were in agree-
ment, as is indicated in Figs. 15.3 and 15.4, How-
ever, they were not in complete agreement, largely
because of differences in the experimental setups
at the two facilities. For example, while the TSF
had a symmetrical power density distribution, the
fuel element loading at the BSF gave an asym-
metrical distribution which had a maximum 8.1 ecm
from the center line of the reactor grid. Also,
only compartments A and D contained borated water
at the BSF, whereas at the TSF all compartments
contained borated water for the first in-pool meas-
urements, Later, plain water was used in Com-
partment D, The BSF boration was 1.1 wt %, while
the TSF boration was 0.85 wt %. For the measure-
ments off the rear section at the BSF, no lead or
iron side shielding was present, while at the TSF
the side shielding shown in Fig. 15.1 was in
position, For the measurements off the front and
side sections, the side shield at the BSF had a
total of 1 in. less steel than the side shield at the
TSF.

Measurements of the neutrons scattered into the
side of the detector tank (located a horizontal
distance of 70.8 ft from the G-E reactor shield)
were made as a function of altitude. The flux
(Fig. 15.5) is a slowly varying function of the
altitude, and it exhibits a peak at about 35 ft.
A decrease of about 6% in the readings between
150 and 200 ft indicates that the ground-scattered
neutrons are still observable at these altitudes for
this particular reactor-shield combination. The
shape of the curve is quite different from that ob-
tained in the differential shielding experiments

with the water tank,? because the G-E shield

mockup emits neutrons in a direction more favorable
for ground scattering. The intensity from the G-E
shield peaks at about 55 and 120 deg from the
reactor-detector center line and is symmetrical
about the reactor-detector axis.

Measurements were also made of the thermal-
neutron flux and the gamma-ray dose rates within
the detector tank at an altitude of 195 ft. The
G-E reactor shield was a horizontal distance of
64 ft from the detector tank, and, for these meas-
urements, five 1-in.-thick lead stabs were installed
1 ft from the rear face (reactor side) of the tank.
The lead slabs simulated the shielding in the crew
compartment.

A knowledge of the thermal-neutron flux distri-
bution in the detector tank is useful in extending
the fast-neutron dose rate measurements into
regions where the intensity is foo low to be meas-
ured with the dosimeter, This distribution is also
necessary for predicting the capture gamma-ray

infensity fo be expected in the crew shield. The

flux (Fig. 15.6) along the y axis (coincident with

’ the reactor-detector axis) exhibits an average re-

~ laxation length of 5.0 cm in the water between the
rear face and the lead. This indicates that these
neutrons are largely air-scattered neutrons, as
would be expected, since the thick neutron shadow
shield eliminates the direct beam. The apparent
* transparency of the lead is suspect, since the
possibility exists that neutrons were streaming in

through the lead from the side of the detector tank.

crew compartment side shielding. The apparent
relaxation length, which is not constant, is very
short, 4.2 cm, in the first few centimeters of pene-
tration and increases to 6.0 cm between 25 and
40 cm of penetration. This short relaxation length
is probably indicative of the large number of low-
energy neutrons escaping through the air ducts in
the reactor shield.

In a y traverse (Fig. 15.8) the gamma relaxation
length is approximately 13 cm at the front of the
detector tank and approximately 17 cm at the rear
of the tank.
