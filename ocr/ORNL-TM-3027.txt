> SIRAY, MIST, BUBBIES, AND FOAM IN THE
MOLTEN SALT REACTCR EXFERIMENT

J. R. Engel, P. N. Haubenreich, and A. Houtzeel

1. INTRODUCTION

One of the purposes of the MSRE was to show that handling molten
fluoride salts in a reactor is a practical matter. Of course, before the

MSRE ever operated there was a considerable body of experience which said

. that handling problems would not be bad. But the question still had to
be answered whether after long exposure of the salt to the reactor en-
‘vironment with the concomitant changes in composition, there might not be

‘some unforeseen problems with its ‘physical behavior.

The general conclusion from the years of MSRE operation is that the

- salt is well-behaved, and the original premise that molten salts can be

handled in a reactor without much difficulty deepened into conviction
that this is true. B |
That the conclusion was favorable ‘is not to say, however, that nothing

‘unexpected turned up or ‘that ‘there were no problems, Salt mist in the

fuel-pump bowl led to plugging in the offgas line; there was salt transfer
into an overflow pipe above the salt surface by a mechanism that was never
definitely established; and there were changes that affected the behavior

of gas that was churned into the salt. These matters were the subject of
- much discussion and study and have been described from time to time in in-

"formation meetings and progress reports. It has been difficult for an

interested person to form a clear overall picture, however, because there

are so many facets and the experience has been spread out over such a long
‘period of time. The pur pose. of this report, then, is to bring. together
the available ‘evidence in one Place and to tell what we have ‘been able to

deduce. y

 
 

 

2. TESCRIPTION OF FUEL FUMP AND CIRCULATING LOOP

Many of the phenomena to be discussed in succeeding chapters of this
report are closely related to the particular components and their configu-
ration in the MSRE, Although much detailed information is available from
other sources, notably the MSRE Design Report, a description of some parts
of the system is presented below to provide a common base for further dis-

cussion.
Hump

The spray, mist, bubbles, and foam in the fuel system all have their
origin in the fuel circulating pump. This is really a multipurpose com-
ponent whose tank not only houses a centrifugal impeller and volute to
circulate the salt through the loop but which also serves as the surge
tank, the salt sample point, the uranium addition point, and the contactor
for continuously stripping gaseous fission products from the fuel salt.
Figure 1 is a cross section of the fuel pump with details of construction
omitted to emphasize the flow patterns.

The motive force for the salt flow is provided by an 11.5-in.-diam
impeller driven at 1189 rpm by an induction motor. The impeller and its
volute are installed in a 36-in.-diam tank or pump bowl. In the MSRE fuel
system the impeller delivers 1250 gpm against a head of 55 ft of salt ~
(~ 53 psi). Some 50 gpm is diverted as described below, so the flow out
through the tangential discharge line that penetrates the side of the pump
tank is 1200 gpm. -

Since fluid pressures inside the volute are high relative to those
in the pump tank, some salt "leakage" occurs when there are unsealed fit-
tings. The major component of this "leakage" is the so-called fountain
flow through the clearance between the impeller shaft and the top of the
‘volute. Baffles are provided around the shaft to keep the fountain flow

from spraying into the gas space, This flow partly fills the annular
~ spaces between the shaft and the two concentric cylinders that support a
the volute top and the volute itself, Although there is a row of 1/8-in, v
drain holes near the bottom of each eylinder, the salt flow (15 gpm at
design conditions) exceeds their capability and most of the fountain flow
enters the main part of the pump bowl by overflowing at the "windows."
Other possible sources of "leakage" from the volute are the joint between
the volute outlet and the discharge line (not shown), and a recirculating
flow past the labyrinth seal at the eye of the impeller,

The primary source of salt flow into the pump tank is a deliberate

bypass that is taken from the volute discharge line into a toroidal spray
- ring in the upper part of the pump bowl. From there, the salt sprays out .
through 2 rows of holes and impinges on the salt surface in the tank to
provide gas-liquid contacting for xenon stripping. It should be noted
that the spray ring is not quite a complete torus; a 15-degree segment is
omitted to provide space for the sampler cage (see partial plan view and
section at far left of Fig. 1). Also there are no holes in a 60-degree .
segment above the salt discharge line from the volute. The opening from Yh
the pump discharge into the spray ring was sized to limit the spray system

O

flow to 50 gpm. At this rate the average velocity of the streams emerging
from the drilled holes in the ring is 7.5 ft/sec. About 40 gm is directed
downward at 40° from the horizontal through the lower row of 1/8-in, di-
ameter holes. The other 10 gpm emerges from the row of 1/16-in. holes
drilled at 30° below the horizontal.

The salt that flows into the pump bowl returns to the main circulating
stream through the clearance between the pump tank and the suction end of
the volute. Normally the fuel pump contains about 2.9 ft3 of salt that is
outside the main circulating stream. Of this, about 1.8 ft> is in the
region above and outside the skirt that extends out from the volute. This
region is agitated by the jets and should be rather well-mixed. Salt

"enters the region under the skirt with an average radial (inward) velocity : .
Cr
of only 0.11 ft/sec, accelerating to 1.7 ft/sec through the scalloped - «&>
opening into the pump suction. Those gas‘'bubbles which rise out of the =

bubbler level tubes, can move along the bottom surface of the volute and

up through vent holes at the Juncture of the skirt and the volute.

With the fuel pump off, both the spray ring and the volute support
cylinder are practically empty. These regions fill with salt, at the ex-
pense of the level in the pump bowl, when the pump is turned on, Thus,
even if there are no gas "pockets" in the loop, some drop in fuel-pump

level occurs each time the pump is started. The salt volume associated

. with these two regions is 0.27 f£t>.

“The volute calibration of the fuel pump is of interest in translating
level changes to volume changes in the rest of the loop. Figure 2 shows
the volume of salt in the sump region of the fuel pump (outside of the
volute) as a function of salt level. This calibration does not include
salt inside the volute support cylinder or spray ring since the amount of
salt in these regions does not vary with pump-bowl level when the pump. is
on. a |
Another important function of the fuel pump 1s to provide the gas-
liquid interface and a compressible surge volume for the fuel loop. Since
the gas space in the pump bowl (nominally 1.9 ft) was judged inadequate

for a major salt-level excursion, an annular 5.5-ft> overflow tank was pro-

vided below the pump bowl, around the pump suction line, Communication
between the pump bowl and the overflow tank is through a 1-1/2-inch IPS

line that extends upward into the pump bowl above the normal salt level.

(See partial section immediately to the left of the main drawing in Fig. 1.)
To minimize the intrusion of salt spray into the top of this open line,
the baffle on the spray ring | has an extension that forms a "roof" over the

line,

Four cover-gas streams normally flow into the pump bowl. ‘Two of

“these flow through separate internal surge chambers to the dip tubes of
the bubbler level elements, The surge chambers prevent expulsion of salt
into unheated gas supply lines during rapid pressure excursions, Normal
~ gas flow through each bubbler tube is 0.37 £ [min STP. Another minor gas

flow (0.15 g/min STP) enters through the bubbler reference line. The en-

trance of this line into the pump bowl is baffled, as shown, to minimize

the intrusion of salt spray.

The principal flow of cover gas enters the pump bowl through the an-

 nulus between the rotating impeller shaft and the shield plug. The pur-
pose of this entry point is to. prevent diffusion of radioactive gases

(and possibly salt mist) up ‘the shaft annulus to the vicinity of the oil-

~ lubricated bearings. The flow enters the annulus between the bearings

and the impeller and a small amount (~ 0.1 g/min) flows upward to keep oil
vapors from diffusing downward; the remainder Tlovs down into the pump bowl,
The normal gas flow rate to the shaft annulus is 2. L 2 /min STP, but values
between 1.5 and 5 £2 /min have been used,

Additional cover gas can be provided by flow down the sampler line
but this line is normally closed at the sampler. During routine sampling
(or enriching) operations, a gas flow of 1 g/min STP down this line is
maintained.

The cover gas normally leaves the pump bowl through two 1/2-1n. IPS
lines with ‘baffled bottoms. The two lines penetrate the pump bowl b-1/2 in.

apart and merge into a single 1/2-in, pipe within 8 in. The offgas flow

carries out gaseous fission ‘products (and some salt mist) and provides a

means of regulating the system overpressure. Two circular baffles are

. provided in the pump-bowl gas space to minimize the transport of salt mist

into the offgas lines, When the mein offgas lines are restricted, part
or all of the pump-bowl cover gas flows down the salt overflow. line and
bubbles through the salt in the overflow tank. It then enters the main

fuel offgas line through the vent line on that tank,

: "The last device in the pump bowl is’ the cage for the sampler-enricher.

This cage consists of. 5 vertical rods to confine the capsules that are

: lowered into the pump bowl. However, ‘the cage ‘has no bottom so capsules
can reach to the bottom head of the pump tank. This cage 1s surrounded
by a spiral baffle whose purpose: is to prevent salt spray from entering

and obstructing the ‘opening into. the pump bowl. .There is ‘a narrow slot

between the bottom of the baffle and’ the ‘bottom head of the pump bowl to

permit circulating of liquid salt through the sampling ‘chamber.

 
 

 

Loop | .

The general configuration of the fuel circulating loop is shown sche-

| 8}

matically in Fig. 3. Although many details have been omitted, some rela-
tively minor items are deliberately included because of their importance
to the discussion in subsequent sections of this report.

In general, the components and connecting piping are arranged and
pitched so that, under stagnant conditions, gas bubbles within the loop
will tend to migrate toward the gas-liquid interface in the pump. The
most notable exceptions to this are the top of the heat exchanger where
the fuel salt enters the shell and a small region at the bottom of the
larger core access plug in the reactor neck. The extent to which such
bubble migration actually proceeds depends on a number of relatively in-
determinate factors including the tendency for bubbles to slide along
surfaces.

An important factor in evaluating the behavior of circulating bubbles -
is the fluid pressure as a function of position in the loop. The table on
Fig. 3 shows the calculated absolute pressure at several points when the
pressure in the pump bowl is 5 psig and the salt flow rate is 1200 gm <
(Ref. 2). Other tabulated quantities of interest are the salt volumes
between points and the transit times at 1200 gpm. ~

Thermocouple TE-R52 will be referred to later. This thermocouple
is in a well that protrudes into the salt stream at the lower end of the
core specimen access plug (just to the right of point 8 in Fig. 3). There
is good reason to believe, however, that the thermocouple junction was not
actually inserted to the very bottom of the well but remained up inside
the plug. At any rate its reading was several hundred degrees below the
temperature of the salt leaving the core and seemed to be responsive to

changes in the salt level in the annulus around the plug.

3. SIRAY AND MIST

During operation of the fuel pump there is a mist, or suspension of
molten-salt droplets, in the gas space of the pump bowl. There is much
evidence for this, but none clearer than Fig. lk, This is a photograph of
a 1/2-inch-wide strip of stainless steel that was exposed in the sampler
cage for 12 hours, The k-1inch-long strip was positioned so that the lower
end was at the salt pool surface (as indicated by the bubbler level elements).
The upper end was near the penetration of the sampler tube into the top of
the pump bowl. (See Fig. 1.) Although the size of the droplets and the
amount of salt on the specimen in Fig. 4 are unusual (possibly because of

the long exposure or the condition of the stainless steel surface), quali-
tatively similar deposition was observed on numerous other sample capsules
and a set of graphite specimens exposed in the gas space, |

The origin of most of the mist in the MSRE pump bowl is undoubtedly
the spattering and splashing of the streams from the spray ring. In some
of the pumps that were operated during the development program, the leakage
up around the shaft also emerged into the gas space as a spray. The mist
may drift with the purge gas flow into the gas lines attached to the top
of the pump bowl and freeze there. Frozen mist has been a problem in some
pumps, not in others. Spray or falling mist has also been suggested as a
possible contributor to the transfer to the overflow tank on the MSRE fuel
pump, but, as will be explained below, this can hardly be the main cause.

Observations in Development Facilities

One of the first moves after the MSRE was approved in 1960 was the
design and construction of a water loop for pump development, The pump

tank and inlet pipe in this water loop were made of Plexiglas to permit

direct observation of flows. "The hydraulic design of the test pump and -

that of the reactor fuel pump were jdentical."®. "Various baffles were de-
vised to control splash, spray, and gas bubbles caused by the operation
of the bypass flows in the pump tank."® "Observations of the fountain
flow from the impeller upper labyrinth revealed the need to control it;
the slinger impeller was causing an undesirable spray, This spray was
contained and controlled by use of a cover enclosing the labyrinth and
slinger impeller, and having drain ports located at its lower end."”
Five different configurations of xenon strippers were tried; the last was
the toroidal spray ring with two rows of holes and a flow of about 50 gpm.
"Considerable splatter of liquid resulted from the impingement of this flow
onto the volute and volute support. Control of this splatter was obtained
through use of baffles installed on the stripper and on the volute support,"
The prototype fuel pump, which was tested by circulation of salt for
thousands of hours, was equipped with the same kind of stripper and baffles
that had been in the final tests with water. That the spray situation was
adequately handled was indicated by circulation of salt for nearly 1k,000
hours, During the first 11,000 hr, there was no trouble at all with the
offgas, but the purge flow was quite low (<0.lL g/min). After the purge
was increased to the MSRE design rate of 4 g/min, some minor difficulty
was encountered with plugging in & needle valve about 15 ft downstream of
the pump tank. After 2500 hr at the high purge rate a "hot trap" con-
sisting of an enlarged section of pipe which could be heated was installed
in the offgas line near the pump tank, After this modification the pump
was operated only 300 hr longer before it was shut down to make way for
testing the Mark II pump, but in that time there was no indication of
plugging.®

A similar salt pump, the PK-P pump, was operated for a long period
of time without trouble. . During a shutdown after 5436 h of operation

"there was no evidence of salt collecting in the offgas line or spark-plug

risers in the pump tank."?© This pump eventually operated a total of
23,500 hr with fluoride salts with no plugging of the offgas system. The
gas purge rate was only about a tenth of the MSRE design rate, however.
The pump in the Engineering Test Loop was a DANA pump left over from
the ANP, The hydraulic performance of the DANA pump is not the same as
the MSRE pumps, but the two pump configurations and the fountain flow
which emerges into the gas space are very similar. . "Some difficulty was
experienced during the operation of the loop with plugging of the pump
offgas line. Examination after the first 788 hr of operation revealed a
collection of salt at the junction of the unbaffled 1/2-inch-pipe offgas
connection with the DANA pump-bowl 11d." The bubbler reference line
through which gas entered the pump bowl was covered with an "internal
splash shield" or baffle and although there was some salt around the pipe
opening it was not obstructed. There was however a potentially trouble-
some deposit 6 in. above the liquid level at the capsule stop area of the
sampler-enricher guide tube. An air-cooled copper tube inserted in the
pump bowl during 89 h of salt circulation at 1100°F accumulated a deposit
of what appeared to be frozen droplets, No such deposit appeared on a
cold finger in the drain tank and it was concluded that "the pump bowl

The Mark-II fuel pump was designed to provide 8 greater surge volume
for fuel salt expansion, In the new design the spray ring and baffles
were also changed with the intention of improving the xenon stripping.

In the water tests of the pump tank models "large numbers of very small
bubbles were present in the pump tank liquid."?> In the effort to reduce
‘the bubble production in the liquid, a baffle was added which intercepted
the spray jets. This created another problem: impingement of the jets
on this baffle produced much spray and mist. Another baffle or cover over
the spray area prevented direct splashing against the top of the pump tank
but mist could still drift out underneath the impingement baffle into the
region from which the offgas is drawn.

The Mark-IT pump was never installed at the MSRE, but it was opera-
ted for an extended period in the pump development facility. During the
first L000 hr of salt testing of the Mark II, there was far more accumu-
lation of frozen salt droplets in the offgas line than there had been in
the tests of the earlier model pump. A filter about 15 ft downstream from
the pump bowl trapped salt particles (all 1oy or smaller) at a rate of
about a cubic inch per 100 hours of salt circulation.® A noticeable re-
striction which built up in the offgas line was repeatedly (about once a
week) relieved by applying a torch to the vertical section of offgas line
Just above the pump bowl or by rapping at this location. Examination re-
vealed a brittle deposit which crumbled easily and was made up of salt
beads up to 15u in diameter.” After LOOO hr of operation, the salt level
in the pump bowl was raised about 5 in., submerging the lower edge of the
impingement baffle so that mist-laden gas could not flow so freely into
the region of the offgas line. This drastically reduced the rate of accumu-
lation of salt in the offgas line, although it did not altogether eliminate
it,

Salt-in _MSRE Offgas System

‘From time to time throughout the operation of the MSE, solids have
been removed from filters, valves, and lines in the fuel and coolant off-
gas systems. Material from the coolant of fgas system has shown only traces
of salt constituents, but many of the fuel offgas solids have included
tiny beads of frozen salt, evidence of the salt mist in the fuel bump bowl.

During the precritical operation, ‘special side- outlet inserts were
installed in the offgas flange nearest the fuel pump bowl: the first for
a krypton-stripping experiment, the second for drawing off gas to a fluo-

ride analyzer. When the flange was opened to install and remove these in-

~ serts, the line appeared generally clean but small amounts of solids were

found between the flange faces, These contained tiny glassy beads which

were presumed to be frozen salt nist, The behavior of the fluoride ana-
lyzer during startup and operation of the fuel pump also suggested the
presence of particulate fluorides in the sample stream,l®

Frozen salt beads were also found during the prenuclear operation
far downstream at the fuel pressure control valve in the vent house. Near
the end of the first run with flush salt, fuel pressure control became
erratic and after the end of the run (March, 1965) the small control valve
was found to be partially plugged. An acetone rinse contained small
(1 - 54) beads of a glassy material. After a week of carrier salt circu-
lation in May 1965, the small control valve again began to plug. This time
it was removed and cut open for-examination, A deposit on the stem was

found to be about 20% amorphous carbon and the remainder 1- to 5-y beads
having the composition of the flush salt.?® The beads were glassy rather
‘than crystalline, im implying rapid cooling of molten salt mist. The carbon

was presumably soot from oil thermally decomposed. in the pump bowl,

was first operated at power (January - February 1966). Samples of the
offending material were nearly all radiation-polymerized organic, either
as a viscous liquid or a sticky solid, with traces of salt showing in only
a few of the samples. In September 1966, when the first particle trap was
removed, the material Plugging the entrance stainless steel mesh was found
to be organic with a very high fraction of barium and strontium (20 wt Ba,
15 wt% Sr). There was only a minute amount of salt (0.01 wt% Be, 0.05 wtd
zr), 2° indicating that if frozen salt mist was still leaving the pump bowl
it was being stopped somewhere short of the vent house where the particle
trap was located, | |

Material chiseled and rodded from the offgas line near the pump bowl
“in November 1966 appeared to be mostly residual frozen salt from the over-
£111 with flush salt that had occurred in July. The increase in Pressure
drop during operation must have been caused by some material gradually £ill-
ing the small blow-hole through the frozen salt, but the nature of this
plugging material was not determined.

The offgas line at the pump bowl was opened next 16 months later, in
April 1968, to investigate the unusual pressure drop that had showed up in
intervals of low-power operation during the preceding 6-month run, A flexi-
ble cleaning tool pushed to the pump bowl came out with material adhering
to it that appeared to be a tar-like base with a fair amount of salt in it.
The flexible jumper line and the flange joints were found to contain light
deposits of soot-like material with a small amount of frozen salt droplets.Z?

In December 1968, the offgas line was again cleaned from the nearest
flange to the pump bowl to relieve a restriction that had appeared during
the 2800-h of high-temperature operation in the 23° startup. An obstruc-
tion was encountered sbout where the one had been at the end of the 23%U
operation: just above the pump bowl, where the temperature of the gas
stream would be decreasing rapidly. The material that came out on the
cleanout tool looked different, however. Instead of adhering, tarry ma-

terial generally distributed, there were a few bits of material having the

) which appeared to contain 4 to 7 mg of fuel salt which had gotten there
since the 2335 startup, ®2

During the first § months of 1969 a significant restriction again de-
veloped near the pump bowl, As was the case with other restrictions, this

‘diverted the offgas flow through the overflow tank, However, one week be-

fore a scheduled shutdown on June 1, 1969, a restriction also developed in
the vent line from the overflow tank, Since the latter restriction was

essentially complete, the of fgas again flowed through the restriction in

the normal offgas line which by that time had increased to about 10 psi
at normal flow, Some adjustments were made in operating parameters and
this condition persisted until the scheduled shutdown with no serious ef-

fect on the operation. This time, however, the line was not opened to

determine the nature of the plug. Instead, a heater was installed on the

line section nearest the fuel pump and the restriction was cleared by

heating and then applying a differential pressure toward the pump. bowl.
The heater was left in place and connected to a power supply for possible
future use, Tests showed that the overflow tank vent line was plugged in

a flanged section containing two valves. This was replaced and the plug

was found to be organic material, with very little, if any, salt, located

in a 1/k-inch port in one of the valves.Z>

‘A restriction again became detectable in the offgas line near the fuel

pump after another 2200 hours of salt circulation, This occurred on Decem-
‘ber 8, 1969, only four days before the scheduled final ‘shutdown of the MSRE.

Since the restriction was not great enough to interfere with operation and

shutdown, no effort was made %o clear it.

Possible Effects on Transfer to Overflow Tank

The possibility of salt spraying or splashing into the top of the
overflow line was considered in the pump design, and the baffles and shed
roof over the overflow line were laid out to prevent this, Observations
in the transparent tank of the water test indicated that the baffles were
effective, and there is no reason to believe that they were not effective
in the MSRE pump. When the salt was first circulated in the MSRE fuel sys-
tem, there was only a very slow accumulation in the overflow tank when the
indicated salt level was within 2.8 in. of the overflow point and none at
lower levels, Thus the baffles were evidently preventing heavy splashing
into the overflow line. If the accumulation had been due to spray there
would have been no reason for it to stop when the level reached a certain
point. Therefore, there is no reason to attribute any of the transfer in
this period of operation to spray. Neither can later response of transfer
rates to changing fuel-pump level, beryllium additions, and other variables
(including the striking difference between flush salt and fuel salt trans-
fer rates) be explained by any hypothesis in which spray or mist is the
. dominant mechanism,

Although spray or mist can practically be ruled out as the primary
mechanism for transfer, it is interesting to look at possible rates, Since
the first beryllium addition in the 233; startup, the rate of salt trans-
fer to the overflow tank has normally averaged between 4 and 15 lb/hr,
This is 50 to 180 in?/hr. The cross section of the overflow line is
2.04 in? So the observed transfer rates would be equivalent to a "rain"
of 25 to 90 in, of liquid per hour, far more than the hardest torrential
downpours. | Co

How dense is the mist in the pump bowl? The CpeiTanis of the salt
droplets on specimens exposed in the sampler gives the impression of a
fairly light mist or heavy fog. Fog and mist concentrations are typically
around 1078 g/cm”, This 1s consistent with the transport of roughly a
gram a month of salt mist out of the pump bowl with the offgas, which is
not inconsistent with the amounts of. frozen salt beads found in the off-
gas line. On the other hand, attempts to measure concentrations of uranium

and ®5zr in the pump bowl gas indicated much higher mist concentrations

(where the samples were taken), - Apparent concentrations in early sample
attempts ranged up to 10” %g/cm® (Ref. 24). If this were typical of the

 offgas leaving the pump bowl, about 500 g of salt would be lost each day,

No such loss actually occurred. In an effort to explain this discrepancy,
Nichols suggested that high concentrations might be sustained in the pump
bowl by electrokinetic phenomena and that in the offgas nozzle a large
fraction of the salt particles would lose their charge and fall back into
the pump.2® If a similar situation existed in the mouth of the overflow.
line, what transfer rate could result? One pound per hour is all the salt
from 80 1liter/min of gas at a concentration of 107% g/cm This gas volume
is already unreasonably high, but it would have to be even higher since
later, more representative samples of pump bowl gas taken in double-walled,

evacuated, freeze-valve capsules gave much lower salt mist concentrations,

on the order of 10~8g/cm®. Thus it is evident that the rate of gas trans-

port into and out of the overflow line that would be required to produce
a salt transfer of a few pounds per hour from mist fallout is entirely too
high to be plausible. oo |

+ Conclusions

¢

We are reasonably confident of the following conclusions,

1. There is a mist in the pump bowl, produced largely by the jets
from the xenon stripper ring.

2. . The concentration of salt droplets in the gas Leaving the pump
bowl is in the range of ordinary mists.

3. - Frozen mist particles in the MSRE fuel- pump offgas contribute to

gradual restriction of the offgas line near the pump bowl, which requires

cleanout at intervals of a few months to a year or s0.
4, Spray and mist are “not significant contributors to the ‘transfer
into the overflow tank. So :

4, BUBBIES AND FOAM IN THE RUMP BOWL

The xenon stripper jets described in the preceding chapters drive
about 50 gpm of salt into the surface of the salt pool in the pump bowl.
These streams carry under copious amounts of blanket gas. The gas bubbles
tend to coalesce and float back up to the surface, but there is a region
in which the density of the fluid is significantly reduced by the presence
of the gas, This region always exists, but it appears from the few ob-
servations that can be made directly that the depth of the low-density
region and the density profile in it depend on several variables.

The condition in the MSRE pump bowl has sometimes been referred to
‘loosely as "foam", It appears that under some conditions, the density near
the surface is low enough to justify this appellation. It should be noted,
however, that "foam" has a connotation of persistence that is neither sup-
ported by the MSRE observations nor appears likely from laboratory experi-
ments with similar salts,

The primary evidence for the presence of bubbles or "foam" in the pump
bowl comes from analysis of the salt level indications, The purpose of

this chapter is to present this evidence and to draw some inferences.

Description of Bubbler Level Elements

The pump-bowl level indicators, shown schematically in Fig. 5, are
based on the principle of a pressure differential between a reference line
connected to the gas space above the salt and a bubbler tube submerged in
the salt, There are two bubbler tubes (596 and 593) extending to different
depths. During construction of the pump, the distances from the bubbler
“tips up to the plane of the volute centerline vere measured to be 3,510 in.
for bubbler 596 and 1.636 in. for bubbler 593. Thus if the bubblers were
both submerged in a pool of fluid of uniform density, the pressures in the
bubbler tubes (and the differentials between the bubblers and the reference
line) would differ by 1.874 in. times the density of the fluid. The dif-
ferential pressures are measured by electric d/p cells having two ranges
that can be selected electrically. The span that is used when fuel salt
is in the system is 22.4 in. Hz0; the other span, 19.4 in, Hz0, is used

when flush salt is in the system, These spans are equivalent to 10 inches
of fluid having densities of 140 1b/ft> and 121 1b/ft> respectively. Read-
out instruments are in percent of span. To make the level indicated by the
two instruments agree, a zero shift of 19% (nominally 1.9 in, of fluid) was
added to the instrument on the shallower bubbler. Thus if the fluid in ‘the
pump bowl is of uniform density equal to that assumed in setting the span,
the two instruments would read the same, namely the distance from the tip
of the lower bubbler up to the surface, on a scale of 10% per inch.

The idealized situation described above does not exist and the level
instruments consequently do not generally indicate exactly the same level.
One set of reasons is associated with the instrumentation. Gas flowing
through the three lines produces appreciable pressure drops between the
d/p cell connections and the pump bowl. The normal pressure drops are
compensated inthe zero settings of the instruments, If the zero settings
should drift (as they do over long periods of time) by different amounts
or if the pressure drops should change by different amounts (as they some-
times do because changes in pump-bowl pressure affect the three flows dif-
ferently), then a difference will appear in the indicated levels. Another.
reason for difference in the two level indications can be the fluid in the
zone between the bubblers having a density other than that used in setting
the instrument span. The flush salt density was close to the 121 lb/ft
used in setting that span but the fuel salt density was above 140 1b/£t3
when the 2357 - 238) pixture was in the salt, less than 1L0 1b/ft> after
the 233% was substituted, Furthermore, the density that affects the dif-

ference between the level indications is the average density of the fluid, -

which is less than that of salt if there are any gas bubbles in the salt.
How the various factors mentioned above affect the indicated levels

can best be understood by looking at some simple relations.

Measurement of Absolute Densities

It is evident from the last equation that the difference in level
indications could be used to measure the density of the fluid between the
two bubblers, If the instrument factors A and pr are known exsectly, and
the level readouts are precise, the accuracy in the calculated density is
limited only by the accuracy with which hg - hs is known, (Distortion or
tilt of the pump could make it different from the measured 1.874 in.) In
fact, level measurements made at times shortly after the instrument zeroes

were checked, with the pump off so that the salt in the pump bowl contained

virtually no gas, gave densities for the flush salt and fuel salts in rea-

sonably good agreement with those predicted or observed by other methods
(see Appendix B). Up to 10% discrepancy in the densities measured for
quiescent salt were encountered at other times however, apparently due to
drifts in the differential pressure instrument factors. (A 10% change in
calculated density would result from a drift in A of 1.9% of scale.)

~ Measurement of Relative Densities

Although the measurement of absolute density is compromised by the
long-term zero drifts, the bubblers are a most useful indication of changes
in density with operating conditions over reasonable periods of time.

The most striking short-term changes in density are produced by

‘starting and stopping the fuel pump, When the pump is off the salt in the

bowl is virtually free of gas bubbles and the density in the bubbler zone
is that of pure salt. When the pump is turned on, the difference between
the levels indicated by the bubblers changes within a few minutes to a new
value, with the deeper bubbler indicating a lover level than the other.
The indication is that the zone between the two bubblers produces a smaller
increment of pressure at the lover bubbler than it did when the pump was
off and the zone was filled with gas-free salt; that is, the average den-
sity of the fluid in the zone is reduced by starting the pump.

Further changes occur as the pump continues to operate and the amount
of salt in the bowl varies due to the slow transfer of salt to the over-

flow tank and periodic recovery from the overflow tank. -As the amount of

salt and the actual level change, the difference between the two bubbler

level indications varies somewhat, with greater differences observed at
lower levels,

The behavior described above is easily understood, qualitatively at
least. The jets from the spray ring, impinging on the salt pool, carry .

substantial amounts of gas below the surface. The fraction of the gas in

. the salt decreases with depth until only the very small bubbles that can

be dragged down with the salt flow are present, If the low-density region
were entirely above the tips of both bubblers, the difference between the
level indications would be the same as with the pump off (although both
would indicate a level Lower than the actual top of the gas-liquid mix-
ture.) If the low-density region extends into the bubbler zone, the dif-
ference between the level indications reflects the density reduction due
to the gas. As the amount of salt in the pump bowl decreases, ‘the gassy.
region moves down and more gas appears in the bubbler zone.

An implication of this picture is that the density profile should
change with pump speed. That is, at reduced speed and head the velocity
of the jets and the net downward velocity in the salt. pool are less, s0

there should be less gas. at a given ‘depth. This was proved to be the case

in experimental operation of the fuel pump at various rotational speeds
in Runs 17 - 19 (February - Se ptember, 1969).
Figure 6 shows the effect of pump speed on the apparent void frac-

“tion in the zone between “the two bubbler tips, (The errors due to zero
shifts are cancelled in the calculation of void fraction or density rela-
“tive to that of clear salt, ) ‘The data for this plot were all obtained
. with approximately the same indicated salt level. _ The results clearly
“show the greater depth of ‘the low-density region ¢ or "gassy zone" at ‘higher
pump speeds and higher salt “Jet velocities.

The points in Fig. 6 also show that in this particular parameter, any

difference due to changing - from helium to argon cover gas is not discern-

a ible and the differences between fuel salt and flush salt ‘have only a minor

effect. It will be shown later (Chapter 6), however, ‘that when the gassy
region extends sufficiently deep in the pump bowl, very small changes can

. produce pronounced effects in the circulating loop.

Variation of Void Fraction with Depth

It. is quite clear that there is a substantial void fraction in the

. pump bowl, Its variation with salt depth (i.e, the density profile) is

of interest, but 1s not so clearly determinable, With some approximations
and other observations, however, we can use the same data to develop at
least a qualitative description, Because of the approximate nature of
this treatment, we will apply it only to the normal flow condition,
Figure T shows results obtained in Runs 15 and 16 (October - December,

1968) which indicated the correlation between bubbler difference (void

fraction) and pump-bowl level already alluded to. This correlation was
approximated by a straight line obtained by least-squares treatment of the
data, If we extrapolate this line to the bubbler difference for bubble-
free, stationary salt (1.58% at the time of these measurements) we obtain
the indicated salt level sbove which substantial bubbles would not appear
in the zone ‘between the bubblers. This level is 77% on the shallow bub-
bler (IE-593), which corresponds to 5.3 in, of clear salt above the tip
of this bubbler. . -

If we then assume that the total thickness of the bubble zone is in-

‘dependent of pump level, this zone will reach down to the deeper bubbler

tip when that bubbler indicates 5.3 in. of salt (56.1%). At this salt

depth, the correlation from Fig. 7 gives a reading of 61. 5% on the shallow

bubbler. At this level, the average vold fraction between the bubblers
would be 20%.

- Data on the rate of salt transfer to ‘the overflow tank during the time
of the above level observations showed a substantial drop when the indica-
ted level on IE-593 fell ‘below ~ 60%. This change may be associated with

Ca drop in the level of the - top of the foam to a ‘point just below the over-

flow pipe. Using the level indication and the distance from the bubbler

to the overflow point (6.5 in.) we obtain an average void fraction of 46%
~~ in that zone, At the same condition, the average void fraction between

the bubblers is 25%. Transfer rates were relatively uniform at indicated

levels between 60 and 69% on IE-593. However, above this range much higher

rates prevailed. This seems to suggest a region of very low density

material (foam) at the top of the salt with a region of higher density
below it, The very high transfer rates would then be associated with
overflow of salt from the intermediate region.

The several pieces of information presented above were used to gen-

erate a void-fraction profile in the pump (Fig. 8). The characteristics

of this profile satisfy the behavior described above but it must still be

regarded as only an educated guess, i.e., a profile of this general shape
must exist but the values assigned to it are relatively crude.

This analysis was carried one step further to indicate the relation
between the actual top of the salt and the internal structure of the pump.
Figure 9 shows the "true" level as a function of the indication on the
deeper bubbler (IE-596). This suggests that the thickness of the gassy
zone is not as great as indicated in Fig. 8, or at least not uniformly
this great, If it were, the offgas line would normally be submerged in
the foam and substantial salt transport to the offgas would occur. It is,
of course, possible that the hardware in the gas space could depress the

. foam in some areas but a more likely explanation is that the thickness is

overestimated. Nevertheless, it seems clear that a substantial bubble

head does exist under normal pumping conditions and that this layer could

easily reach as high as the overflow pipe.

Effects on Reactor Operation

“The existence of the gassy region in the pump bowl affects the opera-

“tion of the MSRE in several ways. The sometimes fairly rapid transfer of
salt into the overflow tank has as its most likely explanation the mount-
ing of the foam level to the’ “top. of the pipe. The taking of samples and
the exposure of materials in the sampler cage were affected by. the increase
in level due to the gas, Most- importantly the gas in the pump bowl intro-
duced gas into the circulating Loop. These effects will be discussed in

later chapters,

5. TRANSFER TO THE OVERFLOW TANK

The more or less continuous transfer of salt from the pump bowl into
the overflow tank has been alluded to in the discussions of mist and foam
in Chapters 3 and 4. This chapter presents the data on transfer rates.
The most significant point about the transfer is that it occurs at all
when the pump is operated, as it usually is, with the indicated salt level
from 2 to 4 inches below the open top of the overflow line, -This is what
first drew attention to the conditions which are the subject of this re-
port. Other intriguing features of the transfer rate behavior that will
~ be brought out are as follows:

1. the dependence (or sometimes the lack thereof) of the transfer
rate on indicated salt level, |
2. the shift in transfer rate from one interval of accumulation

to the next,

3. the changes that have occurred very gradually or between runs,
hk, the comparison of rates with flush salt and with fuel salt,

5. the effect of beryllium additions, and

6. the effect of salt pump head (speed).

Initial Observations

Transfer to the overflow tank was first observed during prenuclear
testing with flush salt in February 1965 (Ref, 26). After overflow during
a deliberate overfill had been observed to occur at an indicated level of
924 with the pump off (as predicted), the operating level was set at T0%.
~ At this indicated level, however, salt transferred to the overflow tank
at a rate of about 0.7 lb/hr during pump operation. The transfer stopped
at an indicated pump level of 64% and in continued operation at that level
or below for another two weeks there was no measurable transfer. Fuel
salt was circulated in May and June, 1965 for a total of 1000 hr, always

with the pump-bowl level at or below the "threshold" of 64%, which was then
prescribed as the maximum normal operating level. Over the 1000 hours only
86 1b of salt accumulated in the overflow tank.Z7

Experience with Fuel Salt

When operation resumed in December 1965, the rate of fuel salt trans-

fer was still very low, As shown in Fig. 10, the rates observed through

February, 1966 are practically zero. This figure shows that as operation
continued, however, a measurable transfer rate developed, increased gradu-
ally, and appeared to level out near 1 lb/hr. After about a year in this

range, the transfer rates shifted downward by about a factor of two and

‘remained there for the final six months of 27U operation. Then, just

after the resumption of fuel circulation following salt processing and

initial loading of 23%, there was a drastic change in behavior involving

much higher transfer rates than ever seen before.

The transfer rates that are plotted in Figs. 10 - 12 were computed
from rates of rise of overflow tank level. Rates based on the decrease
in pump-bowl level are in general agreement, but are less accurate because
of effects of changes in loop temperature and gas volume,

The rates shown are averages measured from one overflow tank emptying

to the next, so each covers a range of fuel-pump levels, A remarkable

fact is that through Run 14 the rate in any interval of overflow accumu-

lation (usually 1 to 4 days) was practically independent of pump-bowl level
between the normal operating limits of 644% and 50%. It is also remarkable
that although the rate was practically constant between any two emptyings

of the overflow tank, it rarely was the same in any two successive intervals.

There is no cause known for the very noticeable shift in rates be-

tween Runs 12 and 13 shown clearly in Fig. 11. The rates in Run 12 were

slightly over 1 lb/hr and had been relatively steady for some time.

Throughout the 3 days of fuel circulation in Run 13 and the 6 months in

‘Run 1k, however, the observed fuel salt transfer rates were consistently

lower by about a factor of. two. Otherwise the characteristics of the
transfer were unchanged, that is, there was virtually no dependence on
pump-bowl level in the operating range. :

The whole behavior of the fuel transfer changed drastically on Sep-
tember 15, 1968, during a beryllium exposure a few hours after the begin-
ning of fuel circulation following the long shutdown for salt processing.
As shown in Fig. 12, some very high rates were measured in October and
November, As will be described in Chapter .7, the highest rates occurred
only Just after some additions of beryllium. Because of the apparent cor-
relation with beryllium additions subsequent to the salt processing and
2337 loading, the times and smounts. (in grams) of all beryllium additions

“through 1968 are indicated on Figs. 10 - 12. Some of the effects of the
~ beryllium were only temporary, but the transfer rate remained significantly

higher after the first beryllium addition in Run 15 than it had been before.
Another difference was that the rate became strongly dependent on

pump-bowl level. The continuous variation of overflow rate with level

makes a continuous chronological plot of the rate in Run 15 and thereafter

impractical. The transfer rates plotted in Fig. 12 for this period simply

indicate the range of rates that were encountered, Usually the rate de-

creased from 10 - 1k lb/hr tol - 2 1b /hr on each cycle of salt transfer

to the overflow tank and return to the pump bowl. This level dependence

persisted through the remainder of the MSRE operation, but it was found

to vary with time, Figure 13 shows the effect of indicated fuel-pump

i level on transfer rate for two time periods separated by about 1 year.
"Small zero shifts in the fuel-pump level element (1.- 2%) cause some un-

certainty in the relative positions of the two sets of data, but these do
not affect dependence of the overflow rate on level. - The slopes of the

two sets of data differ by about a factor of 2. No reason has been deter-

‘mined for this change.

Experience with Flush Salt

During the L-year period from 1966 through 1969, there were 9 occasions
on which flush salt was circulated for sufficient time to provide meaning-
ful data on the rate of transfer of this salt to the overflow tank. These
data are summarized in Table 1, along with the reagon for flushing and the
major events that preceded the flush. The transfer rates through June,

1967 are practically the same as those observed with fuel salt. However,
the 4 measurements over the 6 days of flush-salt circulation in September-

1967 gave values that were significantly higher than the previous values

~ with fuel salt, Even more astonishing is the comparison of these high

flush-salt rates with subsequent fuel transfer rates which were a factor
of 2 lower than those before the flush. The later flush-salt transfer

“rates (with the possible exception of the final measurement) were again

reasonable consistent with the early fuel-salt data, The flush-salt rates
never reached the very high values experienced with the 233 fuel salt.
The precision for the final flush-salt transfer measurement is poor, but

there is some suggestion of an unusually high transfer rate.
Relation to Other Operating Variables

High transfer rates went with high bubble fractions in the pump bowl.
In experiments in Runs 17 - 19 vhen the fuel pump was operated at lower
speeds to reduce the amount of gas churned into the salt, the overflow

rate showed a striking drop, For ‘example in September, 1969, the fuel

~ salt transfer rate went from 3.h - 8.1 1b/nr with the pump at 1189 rpm to
0.% - 1.0 1b/hr with the pump at 600 rm. This is, of course, consistent

with the hypothesis, advanced in Chapter L, that the transfer is caused

by "foam" rising to the top of the overflow pipe.

~~ There was never any detectable “transfer with the ump , off  (excert
during. deliberate overflows). This implies that there was no leak into

the overflow line below the” ‘surface of ‘the salt pool,

The shifts in transfer rate between successive intervals of overflow

accumulation cannot be correlated with any other observable change.

Effects on Operation

In order to place the matter of salt transfer in proper perspective,
it should be noted that although the transfer was an unexpected phenomenon,
it caused few problems in the operation of the reactor. Normally, it was
a simple matter to rressurize the overflow tank and return salt to the
fuel pump to maintain the pump-bowl level in the desired range. The only

period when this recovery operation was much trouble was in Run 9 (November

1966) while the main reactor offgas line (L-522) was completely Plugged
near the fuel pump. Since all the of fgas then flowed out through the over-

flow tank, the act of pressurizing the overflow tank blocked the reactor
offgas. This required that the reactor be made subcritical and the fuel
pump stopped 80 that the helium flow into the pump could be stopped while

salt was being returned from the overflow tank. - This rather avkward mode

of operation was adopted only as a temporary expedient and the system was

soon shut down to clear the main offgas line.

6. GAS IN THE CIRCULATING LOOP

From the evidence described in Chapter L, it is clear’ that large
quantities of gas are driven into the salt in the pump bowl. Some of this
gas is drawn into the circulating loop with the 65 gm of salt that flows
from the pump bowl into the pump suction. This was observed in the pump
development tests and was therefore expected in the MSRE. This chapter
describes the ways in which gas has been detected and measured in the de-
velopment loops and in the MSRE, then goes on to present the results of

the observations over the years of MSRE operation.

Indicators

There are several independent indicators of gas in the MSRE fuel loop.
‘One used only before the beginning of power operation was a densitometer
based on gamma-ray penetration. Changes in pump-bowl level sttending cir-
culation, behavior during pressure-release experiments, accumulation in
the access nozzle annulus, direct effects on reactivity, effects on xenon
stripping, and effects on neutron noise are indicators useful during later

operation,

Densitometer

Early in the pump development program it was recognized that some of
the gas churned into the salt by the xenon stripper spray would enter the
circulating loop and a program was started to measure the density of cir-
culating fluid by gamma-ray attenuation,?8 Eventually, a sensitive, sta-
ble densitometer was developed, using a 4O-curie *7Cs source and an elec-
tron multiplier phototube positioned on opposite sides of the 5-inch salt
pipe.2® This device of course could not be used in the reactor after the

beginning of power operation because of the very high gamma radiation from

the salt itself. Results obtained with the densitometer under various
conditions in the pump test facility and in the pre-power testing of the
MSRE are described later in this chapter under "Experience".

Pump Bowl Level Changes -

The indicated salt level in the pump tank decreases when the pump is
started and rises when the pump is stopped. As explained in Chapter 2,
part of this difference is because salt fills some parts of the pump above
the level of the main body of salt only when the pump is running, However,
the level change on starting or stopping the fuel pump has alvays been
greater than could be accounted for by salt holdup in these regions. At
least part of this excess volume change occurs immediately ubon a pump

- start or stop, (even on the first start after filling the loop with salt
‘that should be free of bubbles), evidently as salt moves into and out of

a trapped gas volume when the pump head and the pressures around the loop

change, Possible candidates for such volumes are the spaces between gra-

‘Phite stringers and the anmuli at the reactor access nozzle.

When circulating bubbles are introduced by starting the pump, they
displace salt from the 1060p into the pump tank, causing a level rise, If
there are bubbles when the pump is stopped and the loop pressures decrease,
their expansion causes more of an immediate level rise followed by a slow
level decrease as the gas finds its way from the loop into the pump, If
while the pump is running there is a sudden change in the rate at which’
gas is being drawn into the Loop, there should follow a change in average
loop bubble fraction (and pump-bowl level) with a time constant about equal

“to 520 gal [65 gpm = 8 min, Changes with time constants almost this short

have, in fact, ‘been observed,

| Pressure-Release: Experiments Lo

The level change produced by a sudden change: in ump-bowl pressure

~ would seem to be a simple, direct indication of the amount of bubbles in
“the loop. Of course, as indicated above, compressible trapped pockets of

gas would have the same effect as circulating bubbles and would be included

in the calculated volume of gas. But what really complicates interpretation

 
 

 

Ly

of pressure-step experiments is the presence of gas in the pores of the
core graphite. Salt is not moved into or out of these pores to any ap-
preciable extent by pressure changes of the attainable magnitude; gas is,
but the rate varies widely depending on the nature of the pressure change.
On a sudden pressure increase the pores would have very little immediate
effect: although gas would begin to flow into. the pores, the rate would
~ be limited by the transport from the salt stream to the graphite surfaces.
In addition, the total amount of gas in the graphite is limited by the
partial pressure in the flowing liquid. (This can be an important factor
if the salt in the core is not saturated with gas.) However, after the
gas pressure. in the pores has equilibrated with that in the salt, a sudden
decrease in system pressure that leaves the total pressure in the core
liquid below this gas pressure will allow gas to fizz from the graphite
pores into the salt. This would have the same effect on pump-bovl level
as the expansion of a large volume of circulating bubbles. The effect
can, in some cases, be further magnified by gas coming out of solution in
the salt. Thus a pressure-release test tends to be misleading if the
graphite pores have been charged with extra gas before the release,

Pressure-release tests, although not an accurate measure of circula-
ting void fraction, are believed to provide an indication of whether there
are some bubbles circulating through the core or none. In a typical test
the pressure is brought up by about 10 psi over a period of an hour or so,
then is dropped back in a few seconds to near the original pressure.

Since gas transport between bubbles, liquid, and graphite in the MSRE is
quite rapid, it is likely that near-equilibrium conditions prevail except
during and just after the release. Thus the important factor in a pressure -
release is the gas partial pressure in relation to the liquid static pres-
sure in the core.

When there are circulating voids throughout the core, the gas partial
pressure and the liquid static pressure are approximately equal. (The gas
pressure may even be greater if the bubbles are small enough to be affected

by the surface tension of the liquid.) In this case, any pressure release
"will cause gas to escape from the graphite and the amount that escapes is

proportional to the pressure change.

hs

At the opposite extreme is the case where the amount of avallsble gas
is so low that it is completely dissolved in the liquid with a partial

pressure much lower than the liquid static pressure, Again, the gas pres-

sure in the graphite will be near the gas partial pressure in the liquid.
In this case no gas will escape from the graphite (and there will be no

associated pump-level or reactivity effect) until the static pressure is =

reduced below this gas partial pressure. Since the usual pressure release

was only about 10 psi, no excess gas would be expected to appear in the

“circulating stream under the conditions described in this paragraph. Con-

versely, the absence of such gas would indicate rather conclusively that -

these conditions did prevail,

Let us now consider the intermediate case where sufficient gas is
available so that the liquid would be very nearly saturated at equilibrium.
The gas pressure in the graphite would then exceed the liquid pressure
after the release and gas bubbles could appear in circulation even though
none had been present before. ‘However, the MSRE is a dynamic system and,
to reach this condition, gas introduced at the pump suction would have to
dissolve before the liquid arrived at the core. The rate of gas dissolution
tends to decrease as saturation is approached, .and it is strongly influenced
by bubble diameter,© (For bubbles larger than ~ 2 mils in diameter, the
available time is insufficient for complete dissolution, ) Thus, it is not
possible to attain the no-void condition in the core with the liquid nearly
saturated. However, the void fraction would be quite low. The response
of the system to a pressure release would, thus, accurately reflect the
presence of voids, Ce |

The principal value of. ‘the ‘pressure release is in distinguishing he-
tween the complete ‘absence of voids and the presence of only a few, Higher
void ‘fractions (>0. 2% or r 50) a are readily measured by their level and reac-

oo tivity effects,

Access Nozzle Annulus

Variations in temperatures in the reactor access nozzle annulus also
afford some information on the presence or absence of circulating gas bub-
bles in the fuel loop. In the Engineering Test Loop (where there vere no
entrained bubbles) helium trapped in the annulus was gradually removed by
dissolution in the sglt circulating past the lower end,>! Iess-soluble
argon was removed much more slowly. Therefore provisions were made for
freezing salt in the annulus to prevent molten salt from rising to the
flange seal at the top of the annulus. When the MSRE was started up, how-
ever, it proved difficult, if not impossible, to freeze a dependable plug

of salt low in the annulus.”? Nevertheless, the thermocouple readings did

indicate that molten salt did not rise very high in the annulus, suggesting
that some mechanism was maintaining the amount of trapped helium. Subse=
quently it was observed that the salt level inferred from the temperatures
varied and that the level variations were correlated with variations in
circulating bubbles indicated by other, independent evidence.®® It clearly
appeared that collection of circulating bubbles was delivering gas to the
annulus, driving the level down closer to the circulating stream until the
removal by dissolution increased to balance the input by the bubbles. The
equilibrium level then afforded a semi-quantitative indication of the rate

of separation of bubbles from the circulating stream.

Direct effect on Reactivity

Gas in the core reduces the amount of fuel and thus decreases the re-
activity. Hence during nuclear operation a change in the bubble fraction
“in the core must be accompanied by a change in some other variable to keep
the reactor just critical, The density coefficient of reactivity of the
25 fuel salt was 0.18; for the ®3U fuel it is 0.45. That is, a 1% de-
crease in fluid density (an increase of 1% in bubble fraction in the salt

bt

in the core) produces. a 0.45% decrease in reactivity. This is a very use-
ful and precise indicator, but it has its limitations: it can be used

“only when the reactor is critical and it may be confused by concurrent
changes in reactivity from other causes. A distinction is that it measures

an average void fraction in the core rather than the density at a point,

as measured by the densitometer, or the average in the whole loop indicated

by the pump-bowl level changes, ,

Xenon | Stripping

The presence of blanket gas bubbles circulating with the fuel salt
strongly affects the fate of the 135Xe produced during power operation.
A few bubbles dispersed in the circulating salt can contain far more of
the low-solubility xenon than all the salt, and provide an avenue by which

. the xénon can escape from the salt into the offgas stream. On the other

hand, bubbles of xenon-laden gas churned into the salt, in the pump bowl
reintroduce xenon. The partial pressure of the xenon can increase drasti-
cally in a bubble if most of the diluent gas goes into solution after com-
pression in going through the pump, Helium and argon behave differently
in this respect. In summary, the xenon poisoning is sensitive to the bub-
ble fraction in the fuel, but the complexity of its dependence severely

limits its usefulness as a clear indicator.

Noise Analysis

When the reactor 1g critical the presence of compressible gas in the

core affects the observable fluctuations in neutron flux. = Thus there is

potential information on ‘the ‘bubble fraction in the neutron flux noise,

“and sophisticated noise analysis techniques have been developed to take
: advantage of this,

"Noise Analysis," as used here, refers to the examination of the

frequency spectrum of small statistical variations in the neutron flux (or

power level) of the reactor, The flux variations result: from small reac-
tivity perturbations which are, in turn, caused by small variations in

other system parameters, For example, if there are circulating voids in

the MSRE, the effective fuel-salt density and, hence, the reactivity will

 
 

48

be affected by variations in core pressure. Analytical studies 34 showed
that the absolute amplitude of the noise spectrum should be proportional

to the square of the circulating void fraction. Although this relationship
nominally applies to the entire noise spectrum, the. spectrum itself may be
more sensitive to voids at one or more frequencies either because of the
spectrum of the input (pressure) disturbance or because of the response
(gain) of the reactor system as a function of frequency. Measurements of
the inherent noise spectrum in the MSRE show a peak near 1 Hz that appears
to be closely related to the circulating void fraction. Changes in the
void fraction have produced pronounced changes in the noise spectrum, par-
ticularly at 1 Hz and, in fact, the power spectral density around this
frequency was shown to vary approximately as the square of the void frac-
tion, as predicted by the analytical model.>> Based on these results an
instrument was built to give a direct readout proportional t6 the root-
mean-square of the neutron noise around 1 Hz. This instrument, located

in the reactor control room, is a convenient and immediate indicator of
changes in the fuel void fraction. It is affected to some extent by changes
in other variables, however, and must be calibrated by some other indepen-
dent measurement of void fraction,

An experimental measurement of an absolute value for the void fraction

can be obtained by a method very closely related to noise analysis, This
is the "sawtooth pressure" experiment.”® The pump-bowl pressure is cycled
on a Lo-sec period by opening and closing a valve to vent gas to a drain
tank, Taped records of the pressure and neutron flux signals are then ana-
lyzed to obtain the actual neutron-flux-to-pressure frequency-response
function. The equivalent frequency-response funetion of the analytical
model is adjusted to the best fit by varying the void fraction assumed in
the model. |

‘Experience

The first dependable measurements of circulating void fraction in the
pump test facility were obtained in 1965. (Earlier measurements were ques-
tionable because of inadequacies in the densitometer.) With a nominal 69%

- level in the pump bowl, the densitometer showed 4.6 vol 9% voids in the

loop; when the level was raised to 79% (submerging the jets) the void frac-
tion in the loop was reduced to 1.7% (Ref, 37). In these tests, however,
the pump had a 13-inch impeller which sent 1615 gpm through the loop and
85 gpm through the stripper. Measurements in 1966, with an 11.5-inch im-
peller (as in the MSRE pump) showed only 0.1 vol % voids in the loop.>®

Flush salt was first circulated in the MSRE fuel loop in January 1965.
On several occasions in February and March the pump-bowl level rise when
the pump was stopped indicated some compressible gas in the loop. There
was more on some occasions than on others , indicating some bubbles. On
March 5 the temperature was reduced to 1030°F to bring the level down from
70 to 50% and there was clear evidence of bubble ingestion in the lower

circulated in May 1965. The densitometer, which had been moved from the
pump test facility and installed on the line between the heat exchanger
and the reactor vessel, showed no detectable bubbles (<0.076 vol%) when
the pump was started and stopped under normal conditions .>® When the pump
was turned off and on at 1150°F and reduced level, there was some indica-

the salt circulating. Three tests were performed in which the overpres-
sure was first increased to 10 - 15 psig and then rapidly decreased to

~ 5 psig (Ref. LO). We reasoned that the rapid pressure decrease would
allow any circulating voids to expand and produce an observable change in
the densitometer reading. The first two tests were carried out at normal
fuel-system temperature (~ 1200°F) with the normal operating level (~ 60%)
of salt in the fuel-pump bowl. In neither case was any change observed,
either in the densitometer reading or in other system parameters that
should have responded to a change in salt density. The third test was
performed at an abnormally low pump-bowl level (~ 50%) - that was obtained
by lowering the salt temperature to 1050°F. This time the densitometer
responded dramatically to the rapid pressure decrease, indicating a de-
crease in salt density or an increase in the circulating void fraction.
In addition the pump-bowl level increased and the system reactivity de-

“creased, lending further support to the densitometer evidence.

At first we (erroneously) assigned all of the observed effects to
simple expansion of gas already in circulation, Evaluation on this basis
indicated that the circulating void fraction was 2 - 3 vol %. As other
evidence was accumulated, we concluded that much of the gas that appeared
in circulation immediately after a pressure release came from a non-
circulating reservoir — probably the pores of the graphite — and that the
steady-state circulating void fraction was actually much smaller. (See
discussion on pp. 43 - 45.)

The densitometer was removed after the initial zero-power experiments
as part of the preparation for reactor operation at power, (Since its
operation was based on a collimated y-ray beam and a high-sensitivity
detector, it could not be used in the high radiation fields produced by
power operation of the reactor.) The most important conclusion to be
drawn from the densitometer studies is that, at normal loop conditions,

the circulating void fraction in the MSRE initially was near zero.

‘On the basis of this information, the early power operation was com-
pared with the expected behavior with no circulating voids, The most ob-
vious disagreement between the predicted and observed behavior was in the
135Xe poisoning. A model used to describe xenon behavior with no bubbles
predicted a xenon poisoning of 1.08% ok/k at full power while the observed
poisoning was only 0.3 to 0.4%. Reevaluation of the mathematical model

indicated that the low poisoning values could be explained only if circu-

lating voids were Present to greatly enhance xenon removal to the offgas

system, In addition, each time the overflow tank was emptied, small re-
activity perturbations appeared that raised some suspicions about circu-

lating voids, Detailed analyses“! shoved that an average loop void frac-

tion of 0.1 to 0.15 vol % with a high probability of exchange in the pump

bowl (50 to 100% per pass) was required to explain both the steady-state

and transient behavior of xenon in the reactor.

As a result of the above observations, a series of pressure-release
experiments was performed with fuel salt in July 1966 to see if any direct

evidence could be found for the postulated voids.%2 gix tests were per-

formed and substantial voids were observed in each. Although the quanti-
tative evaluations that vere ‘made then are now believed to be incorrect,
there was no doubt that the behavior was markedly different from that ob-
served in earlier tests. (It may be of incidental interest to note that
the change in circulating void fraction occurred during the same general
time period in which significant salt transfer to the overflow tank was
developing; see Fig. 9.)

Two additional sets of. pressure-release experiments were: performed

“in October 1966. The first set was performed with flush salt and none of
6 tests shoved any evidence of circulating voids, The second set, with

~ fuel salt, showed circulating voids in each of 6 tests,

Another experiment was ‘also performed in an ‘effort to obtain a quanti-

_ “tative indication of the circulating void frection.4> When the reactor was

filled with fuel salt for the start of Run 8 (October 1966), the salt had .
been in the drain tanks for 11 weeks and should have been free of all voids.
This was verified by observing the lack of compressibility of the loop con- CL

ka

tents immediately after filling. We then measured critical control-rod
configurations with the fuel pump off and after it had been on for some
time, The reactivity loss associated with pump operation was somewhat
greater than that expected (and previously observed) from circulation of
the delayed-neutron precursors, The discrepancy, when attributed to cir-
culating voids indicated a core void fraction of 0.1 to 0.2 vol %. Al-
though the confidence in this value was not very high (because the amount
of reactivity involved was only ~ 0.02% 8k/k), it was in at least general
agreement with the void fraction required to describe the xenon behavior,

The circulating void fraction remained essentially unchanged for the
remainder of the reactor operation with 235U fuel. A few isolated pressure-
release experiments provided no new information. However, between December
1967 and March 1968, an extensive series of tests was performed to determine
the effects of small changes in reactor operating parameters on the circu-
lating void fraction and xenon poisoning.%* The parameters varied were
system temperature, overpressure, and fuel-pump level and significant
changes in the core void fraction were detected. The minimum void frac-
tion, for the range of parameters studied, occurred at the highest core
outlet temperature (1225°F) and the lowest helium overpressure (3 psig);
there was no discernible level effect between 5.3 and 6.2 in, The abso-
lute change in void fraction as conditions were changed to the lowest
temperature (1180°F) and highest overpressure (9 psig) was 0,15 to 0.2
vol %.

The results reported in the previous paragraph are based on reactivity
measurements at zero power but considerable supporting evidence was ob-

tained from neutron-noise measurements?°,“® and related pressure-fluctuation

tests. 47 These measurements showed a change by about a factor of T between

the extreme conditions and that the minimum core void fraction was around
0.02 to 0.04 vol %. Thus, there is good agreement on the change in void
fraction with operating parameters and some apparent disagreement on the
minimum value. However, the void fraction required to satisfy the xenon
behavior (0.1 to 0.15 vol %) is an average over the entire loop while the
above measured minimum value applies only to the core, Because of its
solubility in fuel salt, helium cover gas can lead to a void fraction that
varies widely with position in the fuel loop. So these two values are not

necessarily incompatible. The single reactivity-based core void measure-

ment (0.1 to 0.2 vol % in Run 8) was made at ~ 1180°F which again, reflects.

agreement with the noise measurements.

A dramatic change occurred in the system behavior shortly after the
start of reactor. operation with 23% fuel when the normal circulating void
fraction increased rather abruptly by more than a factor of ten, into the
range of 0.5 to 0.7 vol %. (Details of this transition and other related
observations are described in subsequent chapters of this report; we will
deal only with measured void fractions here. )

Following the increase in void fraction, other phenomena vere observed,
notably power blips*® and variations in xenon ‘poisoning, 4° which prompted
additional investigations. into. the behavior of voids in the fuel loop, Of
primary interest in these experimental studies were the effects of fuel-
pump speed and cover-gas solubility on the circulating void fraction.

Since all circulating gas must originally enter the loop from the

 fuel-pump bowl, 1t is clear that conditions in the pump bowl must have a
~~ significant effect on the circulating void fraction. We ‘have already de-
a tailed the effects of fuel=-pump speed and cover ‘gas on conditions in the
© pump bowl (Fig. 6). Figure 1k shows the corresponding effects on the cir-

culating void fraction. The data for flush salt are based on fuel-pump

"level changes and, hence, represent average void fractions for the entire
fuel loop. As:shown by the error flags, the uncertainties in these values
~ are relatively large. However, it is important to note that these data
represent the only times that circulating voids were observed in the flush

salt, The fact that circulating voids could be produced in flush salt with

- helium cover gas by running the pump at speeds only slightly higher than

normal (1245 vs 1190 rpm) indicates that the normal condition was very
close to the bubble threshold. Although only two data points were obtained
with this combination, the respective absence and presence of circulating
voids were confirmed by pressure-release tests, The higher void fractions

with argon cover gas in flush salt result from the fact that argon is less

_ soluble than helium by a factor of ~ 10. Thus, for low rates of gas in-

gestion at the pump, all the helium dissolves while the argon remains as
bubbles. oo
The data for fuel salt are based on reactivity effects which give a

more Precise measure of the void fraction, Consequently, these data repre-

sent average core (rather than loop) void fractions, The fuel-salt points

- show the lower speed threshold that would be expected from the slightly

higher void fractions observed in the pump bowl (cf. Fig. 6). ‘They also
show the same gas-solubility effect as the flush salt. oo
Experiments were also performed to study the sensitivity of the high
void fraction obtained with helium at normal pump speed to changes in sys-
tem temperature, overpressure and pump level. As before, the most signifi-
cant parameter was temperature but the effects were much less dramatic than

at low void fractions; the maximum change observed was less than a factor

of two,

. Although there appear to have been minor variations, under normel con-

‘ditions the circulating void fraction remained relatively stable at about

0.5 vol % throughout the remainder of the operation with 23% fuel, Sig-
nificant, short-term changes were observed during special experiments that
changed the oxidation-reduction condition of the salt. These temporary

effects are described later in this report.

7. REMARKABIE BEHAVIOR OF GAS AFTER THE 1968 SHUTDOWN

Significant changes in the behavior of the salt and gas in the MSRE
fuel system occurred shortly after operation was resumed in the fall of
1968, following the processing of the salt and the loading of the first
batches of #3 enriching salt. The first, most conspicuous change was
a rather sudden, large increase in the amount of gas bubbles circulating
- with the fuel salt which occurred several hours after the beginning of
fuel circulation, Thereafter the void fraction remained generally high
- but displayed at times some remarkable behavior. This behavior contri-
buted to the understanding of the MSRE operation (although it may seem to
have raised more questions than it answered). Perhaps more importantly
it focussed the attention of reactor chemists and designers upon the inter-
relation of the chemical state of the salt, its physical properties, and
behavior at gas-salt-solid interfaces, Our observations and correlations

during operation with 233] fuel are described in this chapter.

Salt Condition at the Start of Run 15

As will be described later in detail, during Run 15 the amount of
gas circulating in the fuel loop was observed to change during and after
exposure of beryllium or zirconium metal to the salt. No such response
had been detectable when reducing agents had been added during earlier
operation, Thus consideration of the changes in the chemistry of the fuel
salt between previous operation and this run may afford a clue to the
causes of the phenomena.

During August and September 1968, between Runs 1k and 15, both the
flush salt and fuel salt were processed.5® This on-site processing con-
sisted of fluorination to remove uranium, followed by reduction of cor-
rosion product fluorides to the metals, and, finally, filtration of the
processed salts as they were being returned to the reactor tanks. The

changes in salt composition were small, by far the largest being the

removal of 0.9 mole 4 UF, from the fuel. Some fission products (such as
tellurium and iodine) were removed by the fluorination, but these were
Present only to a few ppm to begin with, Immediately after the filtra-

“tion, salt samples showed container metal concentrations not very different

from what they had been during earlier operation of the reactor. Although
there was no gross change in cation composition, it appears that ‘the state
of reduction of the salt at the beginning of Run 15 was different from
vhat 1t had been earlier, :

In discussing the processing and later additions of beryllium, it
will be necessary to refer to the relative reducing power of the various

elements. Table 2 lists the standard free energies of formations of
_ fluorides at 1340°F in molten LigBeF, (Ref. 51). - The point to be made

from this table is that exposure of an active metal to a mixture contain-
ing these species will result in the formation of its fluoride and the re-
duction of some species below 1t on the list. The lowest species present
in the mix tends to be reduced first, but in the vicinity of a strong re-

| ducing agent fractions of several species can be reduced, Another point

is that reactions may be slow in reaching equilibrium,

Prior to the MERE salt processing, experiments had shown that in
molten fluoride mixtures, 2) hydrogen sparge will reduce NiFp easily, FeFo
with difficulty, and CrFo to a negligible extent in a practical time
period.52 Extension of these experiments showed that a practical process

for reduction of FeFp and CrFs in simulated MSRE carrier salt was addition

of pressed slugs of zirconium metal turnings, followed by hydrogen sparging.

After the addition of an amount of zirconium equal to 2. 8 times the num-
- ber of equivalents of FeFp and Crfz originally rresent, filtered samples
“showed T% of the original tron and 6% of the original chromium concentra=

tions, Although one interpretation is that this was dissolved iron and

chromium fluorides that had not been reduced, it was recognized that at
least part was probably reduced. metals that had gotten through the sample
filter.

of Cr2* and Fe® in the salts, So it might be expected that the chromium,
iron and nickel in the fuel salt when it returned to the fuel circuit were
present mostly or entirely as reduced metals. In this case the Cr, Fe,
and Ni in the drain tank samples. were presumably very finely divided par-
ticles that had passed through the process filter and the filter on the
sample capsule, If so, this condition did not persist, for very soon af-
ter the beginning of fuel circulation it became clear that there was a
substantial amount of Fe®' in the salt, |

The first evidence of FeZt in the salt came on the second day of fuel
circulation when a rod of beryllium exposed to the fuel salt came out with
an iron-rich coating, evidently the result of reduction of Fe? by the Be®.
This was in contrast with earlier operation (with 2U), when exposure of
beryllium metal had resulted mainly in reduction of U% to UP (both solu-
ble), with only a small amount of Cr®' reduction also oceurring.5% But on
this first beryllium addition in Run 15 (described later in this chapter
“and in Appendix A) there was a heavy coating in which the Fe:Cr ratio was
113:1.

A further indication of the salt condition came from the corrosion
rate. During the first three months of fuel salt circulation its chromium
concentration rose from 34 ppm to about 70 ppm, indicating corrosion of
the Hastelloy-N fuel loop surfaces by some oxidizing agent. One hypothesis
that might be advanced to explain this corrosion would be that the fuel
salt came back from the processing containing some 3 g-atoms (168 g) of
iron as Fe®t, A difficulty with this is that the effectiveness with which
the chromium was reduced in the final stages of the salt processing seems
to preclude the likelihood that significant quantities of FeZt were de-
livered to the fuel circuit. It has been suggested that the iron came back
“as Fe’ all right, but was oxidized to Fe2+ by some contaminant (probably
oxygen) in the fuel circuit.®® The Fe®* then reacted with the Hastelloy
to leach the chromium,

61

In any case 1t is clear ‘that very early in Run 15 an unprecedented

condition existed in which exposure of beryllium served mostly to produce

‘reduced metal. As detailed: in Appendix A, examination of the addition

capsules showed significant amounts of finely divided metal that seemed
to collect on the surface of the salt, Magnets lowered into the pump bowl
revealed that some of these ‘materials persisted in the rump bowl after the
reduction, The ‘amount of iron powder that could have been involved is
substantial, possibly on the order of 100g. (This figure is based on ‘the

amount of corrosion and also on the amount of beryllium that was added be-

fore the Fe:Cr ratio in the deposits on the cages reached a low level.)

Another significant observation in Run 15 was that each of the beryl-
lium addition assemblies removed from the pump bowl showed evidence that
fuel salt had wetted the nickel cage and had adhered to it.5® (None of

the beryllium additions during earlier operation had showed such wetting.)
~ Semple capsules taken between beryllium additions showed the normal non-

wetting behavior, so the conclusion was that although major changes in the
salt-metal interfacial tensions were induced by the exposure of the beryl-
lium, they were transient in nature. | |
In addition to the foregoing differences, the fuel salt density was
reduced roughly 5 percent by the substitution of 38 kg of uranium (85%

 23%)) for the 221 kg of uranium formerly in the fuel.

In summary: when operation was resumed at the beginning of Run 15,

, the fuel salt was somewhat less dense and, for the first time, was in a

state such that exposure of strong reducing. agents could produce sub--

. stantial quantities of insoluble solids and also affect (at - least tempo-
rerily) the gas- liquid-solid interfacial behavior.

pebsstor During Elaih Salt Circulation -

‘On August 1k, 1968, after samples of flush salt from the drain tank

~ showed that the chromium vas ‘acceptably low, the salt was transferred in-

to the fuel loop and circulated for a LO-hour trial. There was no per-
ceptible difference in behavior of the ‘salt between this and earlier periods

62

of operation. The two pump-bowl bubblers indicated practically no gas
between the bubblers or in the loop. The rate of transfer to the over-
flow tank was steady at 0.lL lb/hr, very close to that which had existed

in the fuel salt operation in the preceding run. (The rate was substanti-
ally less than in the last lengthy period of flush salt circulation, which

was before Run 13.)
Behavior During First Period of Circulation of Fuel Salt

After the fuel salt was processed, LiF-UF, (73-27 mole $) enriching
salt containing 21 kg of uranium was loaded in through FD-2., Then, on
September 14, the fuel loop was filled and circulation started. The pur-
pose of the circulation was twofold: to obtain a sample of the thoroughly
mixed salt and to permit the exposure of a beryllium rod to reduce part’
of the U%* to U3, (The production process for the enriching salt had
left practically all the uranium as U*t and it was desirable to reduce
some so as to attain a reducing environment that would prevent corrosion.)

When fuel circulation was started, chart records showed no abnor-
mality. As shown in Fig. 15, when the pump first started, the bowl level
dropped 0.8 inch, then very slowly increased. As explained in Chapter 2,
this drop was due to filling the spray ring and volute support cylinder
and compressing the normal gas pockets in the loop. The slow increase
could be explained entirely by a slight rise in loop temperature that was
observed during this 2-hour period, Proof that the rise was not due to
gas building up in the loop came when the fuel pump was stopped at 0BL6:
the amount that the bowl level rose was the same by which it had dropped
on the initial start. The same behavior was seen eleven hours later when
the pump was again stopped and started, By the time the beryllium rod in
its nickel cage was lowered into the pump bowl at 2037 on September 1k,
the fuel had been circulating for 14 hours, with no anomalous behavior
and with a very low rate of transfer to the overflow tank.

For. some two hours after the beryllium entered the pump bowl, every-
thing apparently continued normally. Then the indicated salt level began

to rise. At the same time the trace on the recorder chart became much

more noisy, as shown in Fig, 16. After gradually rising about 0.4 inch,
the indicated level curved over and began to decrease at the relatively
high rate of 0.08 in./hr, implying an abnormally high rate of salt trans-
fer to the overflow tank, (The computer was unfortunately not fully opera-
tive during this period of circulation, so a detailed record of the over-
flow tank level does not exist.)

When the remains of the beryllium rod were removed after - -a 12-hour
exposure,” there was no immediate effect on the apparent amount of gas in
the loop or in the overflow rate. Both continued high for the remaining
10 hr that the fuel was circulated. . Quite clear evidence of the high gas
fraction shortly before the fuel was drained is shown in Fig. 17. When
the fuel pump was stopped, the indicated level rose 1.3 in., compared to
the 0.8-in. change the first time it was stopped. The difference was the
effect of expansion of more gas in the loop as the pressure fell with the
stopping of the pump, Immediately afterwards, the level began to subside
as some of the gas found its vay out of the loop... When the pump was re-
started after about 13 min., the level dropped about 1. 6 in., indicating
a remarkably large amount of gas still in the loop where it could be com
pressed. After the start, more gas apparently was ingested, causing the
level to rise gradually. (Contrast Figs. 17 and 15,) Additional evidence
of a high gas fraction was the response to a pressure decrease shown in
Fig. 17. Before the salt was drained the drain tank vents were opened,
dropping the fuel loop pressure (the lower trace on Fig, 17) quickly by
1 psi, Expansion of the gas in the loop caused the sharp level rise of
about 0.15 in, When the drain valve was thawed, the pump was allowed to
run until the dropping level cut it off through a control interlock, which
‘explains the abrupt drop at the end.

Although it was not noticed at the time, the behavior of thermocouple
TE-R52 changed sharply T hr after the beryllium went in. (See p. 8 for a
description of this thermocouple location.) Up until then the recorder
chart shows it was quite steady. Then it began to fluctuate in the manner

Figure 18 is a reproduction of the fuel-pump level record spanning
the 10.5-hr exposure of the beryllium (during which time the rod lost
8.3-g Be). At the outset the void fraction was high, as it had been since
the first beryllium addition, In less than a half hour after the beryl-
lium went in, the level began to decrease and the reactivity to increase,
indicating a decrease in the amount of gas in the loop and in the core,
This trend was soon reversed and from then until the beryllium was removed,
the void fraction went through the gyrations indicated by the level chart.
The control-rod movements associated with each level change were consistent
with changes in the core fuel density expected from the suggested void-
fraction variations. Except for the return of salt from the overflow tank,
no operator actions were performed that should have influenced the behavior
in the loop. Thus, the observed level changes were spontaneous and sug-
gestive of major changes in the circulating void fraction. The transfer
rates observed just before the Be exposure and in the intervals during the
exposure when the pump level and circulating void fraction were low were
between 2,5 and 4 1b/hr. However as shown in Fig. 19, at higher levels
and just after the exposure, rates as high as 30 lb/hr were observed, The
very high rates were nearly independent of indicated salt level between
6.1 and 6.9 inches (on IE-593). Unusually high transfer rates persisted
for some 100 to 120 hr of salt circulation time and then returned to the
3 - 5 lb/hr range.

Comparison of the transfer rates with the densities indicated by the
differences between the two bubblers revealed what seemed to be paradoxical
behavior but which may actually be a clue as to what was happening in the
pump bowl during this beryllium exposure. The comparison of the two bub-
‘bler readings while the beryllium was in the bowl showed less voids in the
bubbler zone than usual at that indicated level. This is consistent, of
course, with the clear evidence that less gas was being drawn into the
loop. It clashes, however, with the inference from the unusually high
transfer rate that more than the usual emount of gas was causing froth to
spill into the overflow line at a high rate, These indications could be
reconciled by postulating that, while the beryllium was in, there was the
unusual condition of a thick blanket of persistent foam that produced the

high transfer rate and at the same time prevented the jets from driving -
gas deep enough into the underlying pool to reach the bubbler zone and the

circulating stream,

Third Beryllium Exposure
The third beryllium exposure was made on November 15, 1968, The total

immersion time was 11 hr with 9.4 g of Be dissolving. However, as described
below, ‘the exposure was not continuous.

This exposure was started with a lover indicated salt level in the
pump bowl to reduce the risk of salt transport into the offgas line. (Some
evidence of a restriction in line 522 had already been observed.) In con-
trast to the previous exposure, this capsule spent some 2-1/2 hr in the
pump before any effects were detectable; then the level began to decrease

‘and the regulating rod began to insert as bubbles disappeared from circu-
"lation. The beryllium was withdrawn with the level down by 0.64 in, and

still dropping because the level had gone below the specified operating
range for the pump. As soon as the beryllium was withdrawn, the salt level
and control rod began to recover and the initial conditions were restored
in only 15 min, The beryllium was immersed again and decreases in pump:
level and rod position began immediately. The exposure was interrupted.
again because of the low salt level and, again, the effects vere quickly
reversed, At this point some salt was transferred from the overflow tank
to alleviate the concern about the low level.

When the beryllium was immersed again, a LO-min wait ensued in which

only minor effects were observed. The pump level ‘then dropped rapidly to

produce & total change of 0.85 in. The remaining 8 hr of the exposure were
uninterrupted with the salt level remaining relatively low. However, there

were variations (+ 0.1 in.) around this low level. By the end of the 8-br

period, the pump level had risen 0.3 in. and the difference between the

two bubblers had returned to practically the same value that was observed

with the beryllium out,

While the pump level vas Low with beryllium metal in the salt the
transfer to the overflow ‘tank’ ‘proceeded at only 1 - 2 1b/nr. In the interim
periods with the beryllium out, the rate was ~ L lb/hr. However, shortly

 
 

2

after the end of the exposure, the transfer rate jumped to T2 lb/hr. At
least part of this high rate was due to an unusually high (70%) fuel-pump
level. However, even at more moderate levels, transfer rates were in the
range of 5 - 10 lb/hr, After about 48 hr more, the transfer rates were
back to 5 lb/hr or less at normal levels.

Fourth Beryllium Exposure

A fourth assembly containing beryllium was exposed to salt in the pump
bowl on November 21, 1968. The previous three exposures had resulted in
the deposition of considerable "crud" on the perforated nickel container
for the beryllium rod, Since it appeared that this was reduced corrosion
products, the fourth assembly contained several high-temperature permanent
magnets to collect any magnetic material that might form as the beryllium
dissolved, The presence of the magnets substantially decreased the beryl-
lium surface area in this assembly so that only about 1 g of beryllium dis-
solved in the T-hr exposure. The circulating void fraction decreased some-
what during the exposure but the effect was much less pronounced than in
earlier exposures, There was no detectable effect on the salt transfer
rate, either during or after the exposure. Only a small amount of material

was attracted to the magnets.

Comparisons

In all four beryllium exposures described above, there was some ef-
fect on the circulating void fraction as indicated by level changes and/or
reactivity effects. However, the effects were not entirely reproducible,
even qualitatively. The first beryllium exposure apparently contributed
to the establishment of a high void fraction. Once these voids began to
appear, some 2 hours after the start of the exposure, there was no evi-
dence of a decrease in the void fraction, either during or after the ex-
Posure, In all other cases, there was at least a tendency for the void
fraction to decrease while beryllium was in contact with the salt and to
return to the higher value after the beryllium had been removed. During
the second exposure, the void fraction was quite unstable, exhibiting

both decreases and increases while the beryllium was present. The

{.

instability appeared almost immediately upon insertion of the beryllium |
and stopped as soon as it was removed, On the third exposure, there was

~ & 2-1/2-hr delay before the void fraction started to decrease, However,

no additional instabilities were observed while the beryllium was present,
In addition, the response of the void fraction to removal and the reinser-
tion of the beryllium rod was immediate. The fourth exposure was appar-
ently similar to the third but the effects were much smaller.

We also. observed that the rate of salt transfer to the overflow tank

vas ebnormally high for as long as 100 hr after some beryllium exposures,

implying that the beryllium produced some kind of abnormal condition from

which the system recovered only very slowly.

Power Bll in Run 1

The observations described so far in this chapter were all made in
Run 15 with the reactor subcritical or at very low power. Pover operation
with 23% fuel was started with Run 17 in January, 1969. One of the more
unusual aspects of the early power operation was the appearance of small,
positive disturbances in the nuclear power (blips). The blips will be )
treated at length in another reports® but some discussion is presented
here because of the interrelation between blips, circulating voids and
beryllium exposures,

When first observed, the blips were occurring with an irregular fre-
quency of 10 to 20 per hour. A typical blip involved a reactivity increase

“of 0.01 to 0.02% 8k/k for 1 to Lo seconds, resulting in a temporary power
increase of 10 to 15%. - The size and frequency of the blips. decreased with
“time and, by the end ‘of March 1969, they could no longer be distinguished

_ from the continuous noise in the neutron flux. Although the blips were

not recognized until January, when the reactor power ascension had reached .

5 MW, a detailed search of - data records revealed that disturbances in other

system parameters associated with the blips began occurring in September

Ts

when the high circulating void fraction first developed. Figure 20 shows
the typical, small disturbances in fuel-pump pressure and level and in the
temperature indicated by TE-R52 that accompanied the blips.

Since the blips were associated with circulating voids (this was
proved later by running the fuel pump at reduced speed to eliminate voids
and blips) and the voids were affected by the presence of beryllium, the
blip behavior was carefully observed during a beryllium exposure made on
January 24, 1969, The beryllium had the expected effect in reducing the
circulating void fraction and, for 2-hr 20-min while the void fraction was
low, there were no blips. As soon as the beryllium was removed, the void
fraction increased and the blips returned. Figure 21 shows two segments
from the record of linear nuclear power (as indicated by a compensated ion
chamber) before and during the beryllium exposure, These observations were

used to support later conclusions sbout bubbles and blips.

. Other Redox Experiments

Although the power blips gradually disappeared during Run 17 and the
void fraction became stable, a number of other reduction-oxidation experi-
ments were performed, Table 3 summarizes all the tests with 23% fuel,
including the five beryllium exposures already discussed. These experi-
ments had a variety of objectives which ‘included the effects of milder re-~
ducing agents (cr and Zr), observation of changes in interfacial tension
of the salt with beryllium present, and the effect of the salt redox state
on fission-product behavior. Since this report is concerned primarily: with
spray, mist, bubbles, and foam, only those aspects of the experiments will
be discussed, To provide a uniform basis for comparison, Table 3 also lists
the amount of reduction or oxidation, in grem-equivalents, accomplished by
each exposure. The chemical effects of these actions have been evaluated

elsewhere,

With the exception of the two major zirconium exposures, there was
no discernible effect on the void behavior in any of the last experiments.
There may have been some decrease in the void fraction in the pump bowl
but the effect did not carry over into the circulating loop.

Within two hours after the start of the first zirconium exposure
(4/15/69) the circulating void fraction began to decrease significantly
and then recovered to its original value. The entire transient required
less than 1 hr for a decrease and recovery of 0.4 vol % in void fraction.
Within 30 min after this transient, the exposure was interrupted by an
unscheduled drain of the fuel salt fue to a local electric power outage).
The exposure was continued after the loop had been refilled but this time

there was no discernible effect. The second zirconium exposure (L/2L/69)

began to affect the circulating void fraction within 35 min; a decrease of .

0.k vol 4 occurred and remained as long as the zirconium was in the salt.
This zirconium assembly was withdrawn once and reinserted during the ex-
posure. The circulating void fraction responded promptly to both actions,
increasing when the zirconium was removed and decreasing when it was rein-
serted. This behavior was similar to that observed in the third beryllium

exposure described earlier,

8. HYPOTHESES AND CONCLUSIONS

. Although the primary purpose of this report is to record, under one
cover, the observations and experience related to a particular aspect of
the MSRE operation, some conclusions can be drawn sbout the mechanisms -that
contributed to this experience. Some of these conclusions are relatively
firm while others must be regarded as. hypotheses.
It is clear from the appearance of objects exposed in the gas space
in the fuel pump that there was a fairly high concentration of mist inside
the shield around the sampler cage. . It must have been higher out in the
pump bowl, although it could hardly have been high enough to contribute
significantly to the observed transfer to the overflow tank, A small
(perhaps surprisingly small) gmount of the mist was drawn into the offgas
line where it contributed to the plugging near the pump bowl. The problems

engendered by the mist in the MSRE pump were not intolerable, but they did

illustrate the need for effective mist protection in molten-salt systems.
The pump-bowl bubblers indicated rather conclusively that, whenever

the pump was running, for several inches below the surface there was a

region that contained a high (up to 50 vol 4%) void fraction. This high

~ void fraction apparently raised the actual salt level in the pump bowl

high enough to cause some spill-over into the overflow line, which probably

accounted for most of the salt transfer to the overflow tank. That only

- a small fraction of the pump-bowl gas appeared in the circulating loop as

bubbles is due to the fact that the normal pump speed was just below a

‘sharp threshold for ‘bubble ingestion, The gas ingestion and the general

behavior of the circulating: voids are all readily explained by ordinary
hydrodynamic principles provided that: gas solubility effects are included.
The explanation for the shift in the circulating void fraction from

a very small value with 2757 fuel to a higher value with 23% fuel is

most likely small differences in the physical properties of the two salts.
We know that the salt densities were different, and small differences in

viscosity and surface tension would not be surprising, Since the thres-
hold for bubble ingestion was very steep, only small differences would be

required to produce a pronounced effect on the void fraction. However,

 
 

 

80

in the absence of precise physical-property data, we can only speculate
about the significance of such effects.

It appears from the various correlations that the redox condition
of the salt may have been a significant factor in the bubble behavior,
~ presumably through changes in surface tension and/or viscosity. Although
recognition of the possibility of such a correlation has led to some |
studies, a thorough understanding of: this area has yet to be gained.

AFENDIX A
MATERTALS RECOVERED FROM FUEL FUMP BOWL

‘Many of the capsules used for special exposures in the pump bowl were
examined in detail in hot cells after their recovery. The prineipal find-
ings of these examinations have been reported elsewhere,'»2 Inasmuch as

the wetting of the capsules by the liquid, the presence of floating solids,

and indications on the capsules of salt level and foam are clues to the

conditions in the pump bowl which are the subject of this report, some
pertinent information which is not fully described elsewhere is presented
in this section. Ss .
During the years of operation with #7°U fuel, practically all of the
objects exposed in the fuel pump came out relatively clean except for very

light deposits of what appeared to be droplets of salt. The perforated

capsules used to expose beryllium were unusually radioactive due to fission
product deposition and some contained deposits high in chromium but the
outsides were relatively clean in appearance ,> After the fuel processing
and 23% loading, the experience with ordinary sample capsules was similer,
in that no unusual deposits were observed, but the appearances of the cap-
sules used to expose reducing agents were markedly different.

Figures A-1 through A-5 are representative of the appearance of cages
used for beryllium exposures after the fuel processing and the 233% load-

~ ing. The first two show overall views of the cages used for the second

“and fourth exposures (Oct. 13 and Nov. 21, 1968). Both show very heavy
deposits on. the outside and Fig. A-2 shovs the presence of a considerable

“amount of white salt. In general, the deposits were predominantly salt

with a covering of dark scum. The tops of both of these capsules were

relatively clean, suggesting that they were not totally immersed in the

BE salt, However, the absence of a distinct "water mark" indicates that the
salt-gas interface was not sharp. and constant, even inside the sampler
shroud. fe Vn

posure, The deposit 1s at least as heavy as on the outside. The cage in
Fig. A-4 was used for the third beryllium exposure, This view clearly

dispersion of the salt phase suggests wetting of the nickel surface — a
condition that did not normally prevail, The top of the cage used for the

suggest residues from cruddy bubbles that burst on the surface.

The deposits on the cages were leached off and analyzed chemically.
Such analyses confirmed that the bulk of the deposits was fuel salt, but
large amounts of structural metals were also found. For example, the de-
posit on the cage used for the first beryllium exposure contained 8% Ni,
0.1% Cr, -and 124 Fe. The relative abundances tended to eliminate foreign
materials (e.g. stainless steel) as sources of the metals. In addition,
the high concentrations of Fe and Ni suggested either that the salt was
in an off-equilibrium redox state or that significant amounts of the free
metals were present in the salt. |

Some characteristic results of attempts to recover free metallic par-
ticles from the fuel salt are shown in Figs. A-6 through A-10. Figure A-6
is the result of the first attempt using a 1/2-1in.-dism Xx b-in, long Alnico-V
magnet in a copper capsule. Although some magnetic material was trapped in
the 5-min exposure, the amount was not impressive, probably less than 1
gram. Figures A-7 and A-8 are two views of another attempt shortly after
a beryllium exposure. This time, somewhat more material was collected but
the difference was not enough to be significant, A capsule containing
both magnets and some beryllium was also exposed. The result (Fig. 2-9)
was much like any other beryllium exposure but little magnetic material
| was collected. Another stack of short magnets was exposed at the start
of Run 16, just after the loop had been filled but prior to any salt cir-
culation. The presence of some magnetic particles (Fig. A-10) suggested
that at least some of this material was floating on the salt surface,

As indicated in the body of this report, some relatively mild re-
ducing agents were exposed to fuel salt in the pump bowl. Figures A-1l

There was little attack on the Cr but both kinds of deposit, salt and crud,
appeared. In this case, however, the salt appeared to be non-wetting., The
fractured surface in Fig. A-12 (broken as part of the post-exposure exami-

nation) shows a black deposit on the lateral surfaces,

APIENDIX B
~ MSRE SALT IENSITIES

As was explained in Chapter 4, the fuel-pump bubblers could be used
when the pump was not running to measure absolute salt densities and re-
sults were obtained that compared favorably with those produced by other
methods. Table B-1 summarizes the densities for the various salts used
in the MSRE as determined by several different methods. Since only the

“bubbler-difference technique is described in detail in this report, a

brief discussion is given below for each of the other methods.

Salt Charging

The amounts of flush salt and fuel carrier salt initially loaded into
the MSRE were carefully weighed during the charging operation, Since both
salts were loaded into FD-2, 1t was possible to use the two level probes
in that tank as a volume measurement. The weight of salt required to fill
the space between the probes (62.38 ft” at 1200°F) was used to calculate
the salt densities. | |

Fill of Primary Loop
After the primary loop was filled, the pressures in the fuel pump and

drain tank were balanced to hold a constant salt level while the loop drain

valve (FV-103) was frozen. The Iressure difference required to support a

column of salt ~ 25 ft high then gave a measure of salt density.

Addition of Molar Volumes:

Effective molar volumes have been developed for the various pure com-

ponents of molten fluoride mixtures. These volumes are weighted with the

‘component mol fraction and added to obtain mixture densities at temperature,

- &This method was also applied to the coolant salt which has the same
composition; a density of 121.8 1b/ft> was obtained at 1239°F.

Ppensities obtained by this method are generally regarded as the most
accurate, at least in the absence of direct measurements.

: Method of Mixtures?

This method is based on an empirical correlation between measured
densities of liquid fluoride mixtures and calculated room-temperature
densities, The roou- temperature densities are obtained by addition of
actual densities of the pure solid components, velgnted by their mol

fractions.

Laboratory Measurements

These are ‘results of direct measurements made in the laboratory

under carefully controlled conditions.

Discussion

Bach of the above approaches to density evaluation has limitations

‘which become apparent when “the details of the method are examined. How~

ever, it 1s not our purpose to evaluate or criticize the various methods.
Nevertheless, the table illustrates that the highly precise values needed
for accurate inventory control were not readily available during the opera-
tion of the MSRE. |
