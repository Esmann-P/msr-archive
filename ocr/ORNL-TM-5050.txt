This study addresses certain aspects.of analysis of performance

of and projections for nuclear reactor power plants.

Introduction

There is considerable interest in the performance characteristics of
nuclear power plants. Concern over availability of fuel from ore
leads directly to emphasis on the development of plants which breed
fuel. This discussion addresses several aspects of performance

analysis, some of which have received attention in the literature.l™2

Consider an installed nuclear power capacity of N plants designed for an
average power level P each and operating at an effective load factor of
u (total power level relative to total design power level). The rate

of energy generation is given by

dE

at = uPN . . (1)

Given an effective rate of nuclear fuel consumption per unit energy
generation, and the fraction useful energy conversion, n, the rate of

fuel consumption is known,
dF dF dE wu __ dF
dt "ndE dt on VE (2)

Here dF/dE refers to the destruction of nuclear fuel per unit energy

generated,

The amount of useful energy produced over a time interval T is given
by

T
dE
E_(T) = J It dt = uPNT, (3)

The amount of fuel consumed over this period is given by

F(T) = [ [£] dt = [tm [Ea

F _ Eg dF

A

F(T) =

rd

Mean values of the variables were assumed to be appropriate.

The conversion ratio C is defined as the rate of fuel generation relative
to the rate of fuel consumption. Given a consumption of F(T), the
production is CF(T), and the difference between generation and consump-

tion is net production,

AF(T) = (C - 1) F(T) = (C - 1) = . (5)
Thus if C < 1, fuel is used, while for C > 1, fuel is produced or bred.

In common terminology, when C > 1, it is called the breeding ratio.

Given a fuel inventory associated with each plant of I, the committed
amount of fuel is IN. The net production of fuel, or consumption of it

if negative, relative to the committed inventory, is given by

 

AF(T) _ PT
IN I

u dF
For C > 1, when this ratio is unity, the amount of fuel produced equals
the inventory, and the required time may be interpreted as a doubling

time,

a] pre ”
dE

Thus the time required to double the inventory is proportional to the

inventory and to the energy conversion efficiency, and inversely propor-

tional to the other contributions considered. Note that the factor

(C - 1) dF/dE is of basic interest, relative to the fuel inventory. P/I

is the power level per unit fuel inventory. Decreasing the energy conver-

sion efficiency reduces the doubling time (but it also increases the energy

throw away and seriously affects exposure and power density). A short

doubling time is associated with a high load factor.
Demand for expanding capacity (new, replacing old plants, or both) can be
satisfied by breeder plants. Consider expansion in generating capacity in

the form

This study is directed at a better understanding of the requirements

for analysis by examining the equations for specific situations.

Although the above equations are rather basic, their use can only be
rather casual; application is subject to interpretation. The 'associated
fuel inventory" is not defined. Can conversion ratio be determined
adequately from neutron reaction rates? What is fuel? What are the

effects of fueling plants discretely and losing material in processing?
Does realistic analysis demand more sophisticated formulas? What are

the effects of uncertainties?

Conversion Ratio

A basic, generic formulation for the conversion ratio is

_ Rate of fuel generation
Rate of fuel destruction

 

defined at a point in time. A primitive formulation is

Cp = xX. (13)

where the numerator is the integrated rate of neutron capture

(n, no n) in fertile material,

R, -[ [x NN ()o,  (E) ¢(r,E)dEdr,
r E n

where N (r) is the concentration of fertile nuclide n at location r, and

¢(r,E) is the local neutron flux at energy E, and

Xe = /f 3 N_ (1) %a,n'® ¢(r,E) dEdr,
r E m

where the fuel nuclides are indexed m. Special weighting may be applied,

as importance by nuclide or by reaction rate type.

The conversion ratio may be expressed as the ratio of two time derivatives,
dF

C = ry , (14)

dt

where the superscripts refer to generation (+) and destruction (-).
The conversion ratio may be related to the mass balances for a period of
plant operation (fuel exposure), Let Fe be the amount of fuel supplied

(a batch of fuel assemblies or a representative particle of material),

and Fy be the amount of fuel discharged subject to recovery,

and using mean values,

Fq = Fg + [4 | | dF d dt,

Fy=F +T [5] Cc -1) .

Considering the relationship between the power level and the energy
generated, dE = Pdt, the use of mean values yields the more fundamental

formulation

Fy = r+" | &] (c-1 . (16)
An effective conversion ratio may thus be defined from mass balances as

F, -F
CL fa Fe
Ce ltE@m (17)

n dE

If the primary use of the reported values for the conversion ratio is
for analysis of fuel utilization, then that estimate which best predicts
the fuel discharge by Equation 17 is the preferred one. What material
is fuel must be decided, as is disucssed later. Further, account should
be taken of the difference between fuel discharged and fuel recovered

for subsequent use.

Criticality

A basic requirement for a nuclear plant is that the system be maintained
critical (ignoring very short time behavior): the rate of generation
of neutrons must equal the total rate of neutron loss. Fortunately the
neutron half-life is sufficiently long that decay loss is negligible,

leaving the overall neutron balance

Rate of generation _ G(t)

k(t) = Rate of absorption + leakage T X(t) + L(t)

Ge = Rate of neutron production
Xe = Rate of neutron absorption in fuel

Xen = Rate of neutron absorption in fission products

Xx, = All other losses.

Note that Ge/X, is an effective eta for the fuel mixture (vog/o,)- In

a reactor, this ratio tends to remain constant unless there is a large
change in the neutron energy spectrum, except as shift occurs in the fuel
mixture.

The power level is nearly proportional to G If there is net fuel con-

f°
sumption, the neutron flux level must increase to maintain the power
level; this increases the terms in the numerator requiring control rod
removal to reduce X,. If there is net fuel generation, control rod

insertion may be required. As the fission product poisoning increases,

approximately linearly with time, control rod absorptions must be reduced
for compensation. One objective in design is to reduce this swing, as

by partial refueling or by tailoring the loading to improve the behavior.

Of primary interest in fuel utilization analysis is not the conversion

ratio but C - 1. Expressing this in the primitive sense

R. Ge X £ + X, + Xx,
C-l=3=5-2- be . (20)
f f f

Clearly Ge/X, must be significantly greater than 2 if C - 1 > 0 for
breeding. Control rod losses, for example, directly reduce C - 1.
Uncertainty in C - 1 is directly related to reaction rates and is also
dependent on the requirement for X, to control reactivity swing and
associated fuel inventory adjustments and their effects as a function

of the multi-refueling history, not simply evaluated.

Results from calculations which ignore the requirements for a critical
system and the losses in the neutron balance required for control
generally have no more value than those ignoring practical design re-

quirements.

Primitive Economic Analysis

Evaluation of nuclear reactor plants includes economic considerations.
The core design which is preferred under a set of economic conditions
is that which will produce energy at the lowest cost. (Breeder plants

are attractive for the future only because they are expected to produce
10

energy economically in competition with other schemes.) The cost of
generating energy involves capital charges and operating costs which
may have to be considered. Here the fuel cost component is addressed

which could be from fuel ownership or rental.

Consider a reactor plant which achieves a quasi-equilibrium condition
quickly so that examination of this situation is representative of the
plant history. The life history of a fuel particle or the contents of
a batch of fuel assemblies may be followed. There may be fuel make up
from one or from another plant, fuel recycled from this reactor, and
exposed fuel recovered for recycle or use in another reactor or sold
or even thrown away. The history of interest is shown below for the

general situation:

Fuel from ore, converted

Fuel from another reactor, converted
Recycle fuel, converted

Fuel preparation, fuel element fabrication
Shipment, accumulation lead

Reactor loading

 

Energy generation by exposure . Energy

 

 

 

Reactor unloading
Storage for cooling
Shipment, scheduling lag
Reprocessing Fuel Recovery
Losses of material occur in processing stages and through decay not shown

explicitly. Also, complicated fueling schemes may not admit such a simple

description.
11

An economic analysis requires that the costs associated with the above
steps be determined per unit energy generated. Considering only those
costs associated with fuel and not with processes, a simple formulation

is as follows:

Let
We be the unit value of fuel supplied,
W_ be the unit value of fuel recovered,
E_ be the associated energy generated,
T_. be the effective lead time,
T be the effective lag in recovery time,
i be the effective simple interest charge, and

r be the loss fraction in recovery.

The total cost component of energy generation is given by the sum of
direct and indirect (interest) costs?,

, _ 1 ; - - 3
Partial Energy Cost = AS + iT) wr 11) . (21)

Note that the indirect costs are a direct consequence of displacement
in time between the generation of energy (sale of it) and the purchase

and sale of fuel (or its rental).

As shown in Equation 21, the basic data are fuel mass balances. For the
more general economic analysis of a plant history, the basic data are

still the mass balances.l»?

 

80f course the powers that be could decide that sale of produced fuel is
profitable and income taxable which would have to be accounted for, but
this is deemed to be unreasonable for power reactors; fuel rental is
another possibility not addressed.
12

A source of uncertainty in the economic analysis is the unit value of
fuel. When one considers sale or purchase of fuel produced by a reactor
plant, its value is not simply predicted. Generally a multi-plant economy
would have to be considered and appropriate plant performances determined
given the necessary coupling of the fuel cycles. A specific situation
must be assessed. A special set of conditions is of considerable interest
because of simplicity and applicability: The quasi-equilibrium cycle

for a plant involving a set feed composition (from ore, from another
reactor discharge, and/or recycle from this plant) and recovered fuel
used in this plant or in others of the same type. The fuel cycle may
involve full recycle or throw-away in part, or it may be for a breeder
supplying fuel to inventory others of the same kind in an industry of
expanding capacity. At some time in the future, a system consisting of
two types of plants may be of primary interest with bred fuel used as
make up for plants which do not breed. These situations avoid the
uncertainty associated with assigning a unit value to recovered fuel;
direct economic analysis is possible. Indeed the unneeded unit value

of the fuel may be established, although it depends on the assumptions
(formulation used and the economic parameters), and hence would be

expected to have a relatively large uncertainty.

Recasting Equation 21 in terms of conversion ratio,

useful for casual analysis. For iT, < 1, the last term increases the
energy cost for C < 1 and decreases it for C > 1; low fuel cost for a

breeder plant is anticipated due to the magnitude of this last term.

In projections for the future there has often been a disregard of the
fact that increasing the conversion ratio (breeding ratio) in a reactor
concept generally increases some of the components of the cost of power
production. Under reasonable ground rules there is some optimum which
must lie below the highest possible conversion ratio of minimum possible

doubling time.
Stable Breeder-Converter Industry

It is of interest to examine a possible future situation. Consider part
of a nuclear power plant industry consisting of two reactor types. A
fixed total power level is assumed, a fixed rate of energy generation.
The first plant type produces excess fuel while the second type uses

this excess as make-up. Parameters for the analysis are given below.

The ratio of the number of plants depends directly on the ratio of the
rates of net fuel production and consumption and on the power levels
at which the plants are operated. The electrical energy generation
rates are in the ratio of the rates of fuel production and consumption.
Primary contributions come from the energy conversion efficiencies

and the amount of fuel consumed per unit product energy.

Consider the situation where type 2 plants are less expensive to build
than type 1. The results indicate that given the flexibility, type 1
Plants should be operated at the highest power level. Increasing the
conversion ratios of both plant types may be desirable to increase the
number of type 2 plants, but subject to detailed economic justification,
There would be a playoff for increasing the efficiency of the type 1
plants at an associated increase in cost. These clues come from the
formulation using conversion ratios; they must be representative for
the situation to produce reasonable predictions from such casual
analysis, Such casual conclusions are subject to more thorough analysis
with consideration of all aspects, Required inventories, detailed

scheduling and interruptions for refueling can be assessed given mass
17

balances for the fuel. These mass balances may be required under several
operating conditions (different fractions of plant refueled, for example),
for which the assumption that a value for the conversion ratio is repre-

sentative may not hold. Loss in recovery should not be ignored.

For such analysis it is important that the fuel generated and the fuel
used be the same thing. If consistent depletion calculations are made,
there is no problem with mass balances for the heavy metals. But when
casual analysis is done with conversion ratios, they should be on a
common basis. If fuel is defined as the fissile nuclides (considering
these as the primary thermal reactor fuel), then any attempt at optimiza-
tion or choice between alternatives may produce a distorted result. Thus
consideration should be given to the likely use of data such as conver-

sion ratio in defining how it is to be calculated.

Doubling Time

The doubling time of a specific breeder reactor type and design is used
in the sense of supplying the inventory for two reactor plants from the
fuel recovered from one under appropriate ground rules.2 The rate of
growth of that segment of a power industry consisting of breeder plants
is directly related to the doubling time. Only if the doubling time of
breeder plants is appreciably shorter than the doubling time of the power
industry can the fraction of plants which are breeders grow to dominate

the industry in a reasonable time given limited fuel for inventory.
18

Consider a young and fractured nuclear breeder power industry in which the

feed for a plant must come from its own discharge, from an external source,

or from excess production. Given fuel balance data for a plant on the

basis of the batch of material involved each refueling, with allowance for

all losses, account can be made of the capability to inventory plants.

The following terminology is used:

total fuel feed

recycle feed

feed from an external source

recovered fuel .

excess recovered fuel (after recycle to the plant)
period of time between fuelings,

exposure period for a batch,

lag time between removal and availability for subsequent
use (after cooling, shipping, processing, refabrication,
and accumulation)

additional lag time associated with bringing a new plant
on line at full load,

fraction of the reactor fueled each time.

number of plants fueled and in operation during period n.

These definitions lead to the following relationships:

A simple estimate of doubling time is available. An operating plant
producing F, excess fuel in period t. will supply the material F /f to
fuel a second plant after a time, which may be called a primative

doubling time, of
Fe Fy
BT TF | TF | (26)

This estimate of doubling time can have but small utility as an index

of performance, yet its simplicity makes use attractive.

A first plant requires a fuel inventory of (F, + F)/f from an external
source. Recovered material is available as recycle feed only after a
period of time of t. + Ep If the fuel is managed in a simple way to
move directly to an equilibrium, refueling on a regular period with no
complications in the fuel management, and it may be assumed that the rate
of fuel generation is linear, then the amount of fuel recovered from the

material from an external source had to be supplied for the initial
inventory, plus that for [e,/t,] refuelings, F { 1/f + [eye 1} where

the bracketed term is truncated.

Special note should be taken of the difference between the delay time
associated with refueling an operating plant and the delay time associated
with adding capacity with recovered fuel. It is reasonable to expect that
there will generally be extra delays associated with bringing new plants
on line and achieving full load capacity. Here the approach taken is to
assume that fuel for an operating plant must be recovered from its

discharge (when available). A key variable is the delay time between
21

the time of removal of fuel from a plant and the time when the excess

fuel produced becomes useful in a new plant.

The analysis of a breeder reactor economy presents a basic difficulty.
With expansion, a relatively large fraction of the installed plants may
represent newly added capacity for which an equilibrium condition has not
established. It will now be assumed that refueling and addition of capac-
ity occur at the same time for all plants, periodically. It will also be
assumed that a fraction of each plant is discharged at the end of each
operating period, and that the excess fuel production is proportioned to

exposure time.

The amount of capacity added at the start of period n is N - N._1° and

It should be noted that this analysis does not address the situation where
recovery of fuel is delayed, as due to shuffling and deferred removal of
blankets, although it could be treated. Such delay in making recovered
fuel can significantly increase the doubling time. Full treatment of a
specific situation is possible, but attempts to generalize the treatment

were not fruitful.

Equation 29 appears very useful for analysis although it must be solved

by trial and error (iteratively). Given mass balance data, namely the
ratio of recovered excess feed to original feed, explicit account is

taken of expanding capacity considering delays and no external fuel
source. It may be practical to tailor the early fueling history to
improve performance not accounted for here; however, any delay in recovery
of produced fuel can be expected to increase the doubling time, requiring
careful assessment. Of course decreasing the fraction of a plant fueled
would usually increase down time for fueling decreasing the plant factor,
reducing availability. Decreasing exposure would decrease the plant
factor and would increase the losses associated with recovery, processing.

These factors must be considered.

In applying Equation 29, it should be kept in mind that m and I are integers,
multiples of the generation period. They can be used as non-integers, as
to produce continuous results over a range of values of the parameters,

but the physical situation represented thereby is less tangible.

Study of these results shows that delay in availability is indeed
significant. The delay time in fueling a second plant is dependent on
how well the fueling schedule fits lag times; it can be longer or shorter
than the doubling time of a developed industry. Perhaps some weighting
over the first several generations would be most representative in a
young industry. The doubling time for a second plant is representative

of that obtained for the developed industry, in this example.

An attempt made to produce useful results considering explicit delays

for an industry expanding exponentially was not fruitful.

Increase in capacity in increments is not the same as an exponential
increase. If it is assumed that an equivalent of an exponential increase

in capacity is desired,

With fractional fueling, the situation is more involved and the result

the mass balances are considered basic data, more tangible than other

measures of conversion.

Breeder Industry Economic Benefit

Consider a power industry of nuclear breeder reactor plants, the capacity
expanding. A casual look is taken here at an economic benefit analysis
required for a selection between possible alternatives, and at the

parameters which play a major role in such evaluation.

For simplification, the continuous capacity expansion form will be
used,

dP (t)

3c bP(t),

where parameter b is related to the effective doubling time by

P(t + ty) = 2P(t),
btg
P(t + tg) = P(t)e —,
b = 1 n2,
d

The ability to expand capacity depends on the availability of bred
fuel for inventory. Given only one plant at the start, a second plant
could be fueled only after a full inventory had been accumulated. Given

several plants at the start, the capacity would double on the period of
30

the doubling time. Starting in 1990 with an effective doubling time
of 10 years, the capacity could increase by a factor of 16 after 40
years, in year 2030; with a doubling time of 15 years, this could

occur in 2050, and for 25, in 2090, well into the future.

The amount of product from the plants (electrical energy) can be assumed
to be proportional to the capacity (fixed plant load factor, etc.).

The total of this product for a time period T is

T
V(T) “f P(t)dT = 2" - 1), (35)
Oo

increasing rapidly as T increases, and significantly dependent on the
doubling time, increasing as b increases. The shorter the doubling

time, the more the useful product. For T = 40 years, the product with
a doubling time of 10 years would be 387% more than for a doubling time

of 12 years,

It is noted that if a substantial fraction of the total demand is to be
satisfied well into the future with such plants, then the rate of capa-
city expansion should be no less than the rate of increase of demand,

preferably somewhat more to make an ingress.

It is now assumed that a given amount of reactor fuel is available at
the start, Each unit of product is considered to have a value and cost
of its production fixed for a specific reactor plant design. The future
will be considered out to time T after the start and the situation (con-
tributions) ignored at and beyond that time. The time variation in

benefit will be removed by the technique of continuous discounting to

where

Q - the amount of fuel available initially,

G ~ the rate of energy production,

I - the associated fuel inventory,

u - the average plant load factor,

n — the efficiency of energy conversion,

assessed damage and even technological uncertainty,

Ce

z = unit value of the product,
consistent units required, Granted that this simple formulation leaves

much to be desired; usual data must be interpreted carefully and more
32

complicated relationships would be typical, as of C_ on n, and the

P
dependence of b on n and u is not shown. Still, fundamental aspects

can be addressed.

Increased benefit is associated directly with independent differences
in the parameters, assuming it is positive:
shorter doubling time (larger b),
smaller inventory,
lower unit costs,
lower cost penalty,
higher plant load factor (which would also reduce the doubling time),
higher efficiency with the same doubling time,
higher product worth,
increase in size (increase in the amount of fuel at the start),
lower assigned value of the discount factor, and

larger value of T (the further the projection into the future).

By the approach taken, the product must be assigned a value, as from
some other source than that under analysis as a competitive reference.
[ne present worth of the benefit could be set zero to determine an un-
known product value (break-even considering all costs including in-
direct, usually for a single plant instead of an expanding industry),
and considering any contributions at the end of the projection time,
The best economic choice between alternatives is that for which the

A significant contribution from the fuel inventory is indicated unless

A comparison is now made between two situations for which only the in-
ventory and doubling time parameters differ. The difference in benefit

reduces to a comparison of the differences between the results in the

B(T=50) 72.5 113.0

B(T=100) 249,0 1277.0

 
34

The results show that the benefit curves cross over as the projection
time increases, Case 1 is best for T < 28 years, Case 2 for T > 28
years. Unless this cross over occurs at a relatively short time, the
choice between the alternatives in such a situation may be difficult to
make, and it may well depend on considerations not addressed here. But
given T large enough, the system with the shortest doubling time shows
the most economic benefit even if a larger fuel inventory is associated

with it, other factors the same.

The economic benefit expected from the differences between two sets of
parameters may be estimated directly. The amount is directly dependent
on the number of reactor plants considered at some reference time,
that is, on the amount of nuclear fuel considered initially, The rela-
tive economic benefit is now approximated with the simplified equation
un o (b=1)T -1
I b-1 ’
where I is relative plant fuel inventory. The parameter b is allowed
to be negative (negative doubling time) to admit converter reactors
such as currently being installed. Setting i=0.04 and T=50, the fol-

lowing results are obtained:
35

-2.5 1.6 3.2 4.8

 

Note that a 50% increase in efficiency would be expected to increase
the doubling time by 50%; the data above indicates that this may or
may not increase the benefit, although consideration of all factors
could well show a gain, but basic cost differences would make a primary

consideration which would have to be included.

Consider a present generation water moderated thermal neutron water
reactor, Assuming effective values for the conversion ratio of 0.6, a

fissile inventory (feed) of 3.0 Kgm/MWe, and a rate of fuel consumption
36

of 1.7Kgm/MWe-yr, at a load factor of 0.8, the effective doubling
time is about

3,0 ¢n2 / (-0.6 x .8 x 1,7) = -2.5.

The table above indicates the economic incentive and therefore justifi-
cation for investment in development of a design which conserves fuel,

up to the break even "breeder" having an infinite doubling time. Moving
toward the right in the table is also important, increasing efficiency
and reducing the fuel inventory. But truly significant economic benefit
is shown toward the top of the table with a breeder design having a short

doubling time,

There is a crucial value of the doubling time, perhaps considered
critical in some circles. When b=i the result is proportional to T.
For b<i, the result for all future time is proportional to the re-
ciprocal of (i-b), independent of T for T large, Assuming the model is
realistic and that a limited amount of fuel is available for commitment
(probably only a small fraction of total capacity for power generation
would be committed to breeders), with only a reservation regarding the
possibility that the electric demand would be exceeded by the model,

the crucial value of the doubling time is
n2, (38)

where 1 is the economic discount factor, For i=0.04, this value of the
doubling time is 17.3 years. The economic benefit over the future
would be smaller with a longer doubling time than this, relative to

that for a shorter one, If i=0,02, the value is 34 and for i=0,06,
37

the value is 11.6. What value of the discount factor is appropriate

to analysis of the future utility industry in the United States?

A different model could lead to different conclusions. An attractive
alternative would be starting with a fixed initial capacity, or fixed
initial investment in plants (the investment which could include fuel
inventory cost, or be just the construction labor cost). Such would

be a direct assessment of economic benefit from investment. The higher
the plant fuel inventory, the more fuel required, and the benefit would
contain a negative contributing term proportional to the inventory (no
inverse dependence); multiply the results by relative inventory to
assess this situation. The benefit would still depend directly on the
same function of the doubling time, only with a different leading
coefficient, For the first example above, the cross over time would be

much shorter.

The projector resorts to philosophical arguments to justify assumptions

(to select formulations and parameters). In the extreme, these arguments
might include, "Real benefit to the individual in our society is measured
by his happiness and requires an increasing level of gross national pro-
duct driven directly by an increasing supply of electricity, although

the rate of increase is dependent on the economic climate in which condi-
tions are expected to decrease this rate of change; an appropriate
discount factor may be a direct consequence, not primarily influenced

by bank interest rates, Decrease with time of the value of money (capital)
is the result of maximizing this benefit. Varying interest rates, due to

artificial forcing, produce pathetic consequences and chaos in projections.
38

Past history is but a clue to the future because it was forced by greed
and exploitation (will the future be?), Etc." So how do we make
reliable projections into the future? We tend to use a large value

of the discount factor to cause an estimate of the incremental benefit
to be conservative, Perhaps the discount factor should be increased
with the projection time, a dependence of i on t in eq. 36, to dis-
advantage the predicted benefit due to increasing uncertainty, but

then an argument can be made to decrease it.

Extending the above development to treat two reactor types, let the

first have the shortest doubling time, the fuel production rate being

Using some of this to fuel the second reactor type,

Thus, b3/by; is the fraction of the fuel produced by the first type plant

increasing its efficiency and reducing its inventory relative to the

first type and increasing the conversion ratio of the first type plant.

Defining Nuclear Fuel

 

For evaluation of fission reactor power plants, it is often necessary to
define just what is nuclear fuel. By assigning weights to the individual
actinide nuclides, the projected performance of two or more different
designs may be compared. The effects of differences in operation and
fuel management may be evaluated and the future examined considering the
many possibilities. Of special interest are fuel utilization and optimum
performance. The objective must be satisfying the requirements for
reliable analysis. It does appear that a definition of fuel adequate

for one purpose is quite inadequate for another. Note that even in a
thermal reactor the fissile nuclides U233, U233, Pu239, and Pu?"! do not
have equal weights when performance and fuel utilization are assessed,

and relative worths have a dependence on reactor type.

For consistency, it is desirable to satisfy the reciprocal doubling time

expression,

 

PT ( dF _ (power) (time) consumption rate
—\5=/)(C€ -1) = :
I \dE intentory energy generation rate

 

y (Eeseraiion rate — consumption fate |
consumption rate

 

_ _energy net production rate )
inventory \ energy generation rate/’
41

by satisfying the individual components, I, dF/dE, and C. Assigning

weight Ww to nuclide n, the form of weighting chosen here is

n n

Cc = ;
L WX,
TWX

‘dF _ on "7

dE ’
L HX,

where Xx is the absorption rate, R is the generation rate, H is the
energy generation per absorption, and Mo an assigned amount of nuclide n.
As shown, the conversion (breeding) ratio is independent of the normal-
ization of the weights, but the other quantities are not, and the values

of these will be meaningful only if care is taken in the normalization.

Consider the total neutron absorption by a nuclide over some interval of

time T in the sense
XT = $VIN o, h = J. J. Je Nr, t)0, (E)e(r,E,t) dE dr dt ,

where a simple parametric form is used to characterize the behavior:
effective values for ¢ the flux, V the volume, N the concentration, and
9 n the absorption cross section. (Difficulties with separability in

?

certain situations must be avoided, as by using reaction rate integrals,

perhaps for individual regions of the reactor.)

A steady-state neutron balance over this period is expressed as
42

other losses _ 0

LN, 00g - %a,n’ - = or 0 (43)

("Other losses" should be proportional to ¢T.) Importance in the neutron
balance sense may be considered directly. If a small amount of one
nuclide were substituted for another, neutron conservation is obtained
for small T (or a point in time) by neglecting secondary effects:

Consider that an increase in the amount of fuel loaded into a fuel pin
requires a decrease in the amount of primary fertile material which can

be loaded. With this physical constraint applied,

dN, Gog - an) + dN (vo 0 - Sa,m + dN (vo, - Sa.) =0.

where % refers to the primary fertile material. usually U238 (or Th?32),

The constraint on feed material is generally recognized. Baker and Ross
43

showed that Eq. 45 is appropriate in certain fast breeder studies.

Note that the reference fertile material has a zero worth assigned.

A worth may be assigned to the neutrons generated. Given use of ©
3

neutrons for absorption, vo neutrons are produced. Assigning worth

f,n

Wo to the nuclide and Wy to the neutrons generated,

¥1%,n = W Vos >

or in a relative sense, the return relative to the investment is

W = —— = eta. (46)

No attempt has been made to satisfy neutron balance requirements. Net
worth is associated with the net generation of neutrons, since only

these are available for producing fuel by capture in fertile material,

W%a,n = Wy, (vog o - %a,n) ?

or in the relative sense

W = -1l=eta-1. (47)

 

Selection of weights which do not account for the worth of capture
products is inadequate for much evaluation. There is a penalty asso-

236 4nd pu242

ciated with such nuclides as Pu which are produced from
capture by high eta fissile nuclides which should be accounted for with
appropriate weights,

Equating the worth of loss of a nuclide with the value of the

excess neutrons generated, plus value of the capture product, gives
44

Yarn = wy og 4 - %a,n) + Vn ‘

In a relative sense, Wy may be set to unity, leaving

VO n Som

Of course this weighting ignores many aspects including design con-

straints, and neutron balance requirements were not addressed.

It is of interest to consider that worth of a nuclide in a reactor may
be associated with its ability to produce useful energy. Thus an im-

portance may be defined as the thermal energy generated per atom de-

stroyed,

where H is the energy generated per fission. Worth of the capture

This weighting cannot generally be very useful because of the high
importance assigned to fertile material. Probably better is an average

from Eqs. 47 and 48, or in the relative sense, essentially

 

noo, (og - %,n + 9% .n + WO oom’ ' (51)
b

The worth of a nuclide supplied as feed can be expressed in terms of its

worth in the specific reactor and the worths and amounts of other nuclides
45

produced by exposure. Such analysis is especially complicated by the
need to account for worth of a nuclide as and where generated and also

its worth as recovered for recycle feed. If the excess feed is for a
second type of plant, performance of this plant must be considered. To

be reliable, such analysis must consider not only the effects of exposure
(the length of the exposure), but also satisfy basic design objectives.
The fact that the use of one fuel nuclide as feed instead of another one
decreases the doubling time of a breeder reactor or increases the con-
version ratio of a converter reactor, indicates it has higher worth.

Its relative worth must somehow be related to be real improvement realized

from its use in an assessment which considers all aspects.

Results for the above equations are shown in Table 2 for the more in-
teresting nuclides under selected thermal reactor conditions using

effective cross sections ignoring high energy effects.

This array of results should indicate that while some weighting of the
nuclides may be adequate for a specific purpose, it won't be for another.
Importance in one reactor design won't be the same as in another. The
subjects of fuel utilization and comparative reactor evaluation present

challenges.

A simple approximation of the mass balance of nuclide n in a reactor

plant operation is

F_(T) = T(X, - R) + z (T) >

where for interval in time T the feed is F, the discharge Z, and X is
the destruction rate and R the generation rate. Using effective cross
sections and nuclide concentrations, and considering only primary
aspects, the expression becomes

F(T) = VoT(N 0 nC No, ) + z (T) .

For some situations it is appropriate to define a doubling time as that
required to produce an excess of fuel equal in amount to the reactor

contents. This is done here with weights assigned to the nuclides as

Note that the doubling time so expressed is inversely proportional to
the flux level (i.e., to the power level), and independent of the

normalization of the weights assigned to the nuclides.
Alternative definitions of the doubling time may be of interest.

Consider that over period Tq the total feed to the reactor includes some

initial loading so that the total feed is

48

The discharge may include some quantity at the end of a discrete period,

In a situation where quasi-equilibrium with recycle is considered, a

fraction of the discharge material is used as feed,

where a nuclide dependence is shown as £ (chemical separation presumed
but not isotopic, and make-up Sn allowed, as of fertile material) giving

excess production of

Special external feed complicates the situation, as does partial discharge

or ignoring any contribution from external feed, the discharge and feed
compositions are identical for quasi-equilibrium (equal £ for isotopes),

So

T 1 - 1 (54)

 

regardless of which nuclide is referenced. The results are independent
of any assigned weights, but not when different recycle fractions are

n/em?-sec), the conversion ratio is 1.5 and the doubling time is 10
years. Data for other cases considering different nuclear properties

and results are shown in Table 3.

Note from these results that a 20 percent reduction in the fertile
nuclide cross section reduced the breeding ratio; however, compensation
by adjusting the nuclide densities resulted in a gain from reducing the
fissile inventory and a decrease in the doubling time. A 10 percent
increase in the fuel nuclide absorption cross section resulted in a
serious decrease in the breeding ratio and a large increase in the
doubling time. These results are of interest when the effects of cross
section uncertainties are considered: a difference in the fertile
nuclide absorption cross section can be compensated for with much smaller

effect on performance than difference in the fissile nuclide absorption

cross section.

Doubling time

Considering the above cases apply to different fertile, fissile nuclide
pairs, it is noted that any simple measure of fuel worth may be inade-
quate to reflect performance. Keep in mind that a special situation was
treated and several contributions have been ignored, including capture
products, intermediate nuclides, fission of the fertile material, space,

time effects, and so on.

The effects of mixtures of these sets of nuclides can be considered in
the uncoupled sense, and possible weightings assessed. Quite generally
a fertile nuclide which has a large capture cross section plays a major
role in fuel production while a fuel nuclide having a large absorption

cross section is consumed preferentially.

The worth of a nuclide as it exists while being consumed and produced in
a reactor may be quite different than its worth as loaded. It is essen-
tial in a reactor having a high breeding ratio, for example, to produce
some fuel in the blanket where the reactivity importance is low; maximum
fuel generation cannot be achieved if a reactivity increase associated
with increase in the fuel inventory must be compensated with control rod
absorptions. Certainly weighting reaction rates with the adjoint flux
solution to the neutron balance equation will not satisfy needs for

estimating nuclide worths.

Special significance is attached to the worth of material loaded as

fuel, and only careful assessment will produce this information. Some
criteria is needed on which to base worths in the sense of fueling
substitution. Quite generally, such substitution will cause a difference
in performance. The doubling time for a breeder would be altered. It

is likely necessary to perform a detailed economic analysis for a postu-
lated future industry satisfying some specified demand load to adequately
associate worth values to individual nuclides. In such assessment, it
appears necessary to consider that the expanding capability will level
out, and that more than one reactor concept will be involved, especially

breeders fueling converters.
53

Standard Definitions, Recommendations

The objectives of specifying reference or standard definitions are to

promote uniformity, ease understanding and facilitate comparisons of

results. Thus reference prescriptions could be offered for calculating

doubling time, conversion ratio, fuel consumption, and fuel nuclide

weighting. Considering that different objectives seem to require some-

what different prescriptions, suitable reference prescriptions are not

found.

IV.

Rather the following recommendations are made:

Carefully document in detail the formulations used in generating

results reported.

Report conistent and complete information for assessment of fuel
utilization (typically fuel mass balance, conversion ratio, energy

per unit fuel destruction, doubling time).

Qualify the importance of reported results regarding their merit
considering the quality of the analysis; for example, extrapolation
of information obtained at a newly fueled state to predict per-
formance history, or analysis which ignores realistic requirements
for heat removal and structural integrity (design constraints) is

of limited utility.

When detailed analyses are done, generate and report adequate

information to support extended analysis:

1. Detailed mass balances for the actinides including make-up
and recycle feed, recoverable discharge, and internal and
external inventories.

2. Neutron balances showing primary neutron reaction rates in the
actinides.

3. Fuel utilization information including an assessment of worth
of those fuels which may reasonably be expected to be available

for feed including that produced and recoverable for recycle.

Certain information is of special interest when breeder reactors

are studied, and should be reported:
54

1. Inventory doubling time using external feed.

2 Inventory doubling time with recycle (quasi-equilibrium).
3. An early industry doubling time.

4, Worth of excess product in a second reactor type (usually a

converter).

For an early industry doubling time, it is recommended that starting
with a new plant, a second, third, and fourth plant be fueled using only
produced, recovered fuel after refueling requirements have been satis-
fied with reasonable delay in availability for refueling. Half of the
time from when the first plant must be fueled to the time the fourth
plant can carry full load is a measure of doubling capability in an
early industry, of considerable interest along with the amount of fuel

which is required as external feed.

An industry composed of a mixture of breeder reactors and converters is
distinct possibility for the future. Thus it is of interest to assess
the worth of recovered fuel in excess of refueling requirements as
converter reactor feed. Other reasonable possibilities should also be
examined. For example, one type of design may be proposed to produce
much fuel to inventory a second type; not only is the early history of
plants coming on line of interest, but also a future time when there
could be three different types of plants involved, one a converter (or

perhaps the first type would phase out).

A complete analysis includes an assessment of reliability and uncer-

tainty in reported results, The assessment should cover the data and
the methods employed and the specific formulations applied. Lacking

other techniques, the effects on the results may be displayed for

perturbations.
55

Uncertainty

The uncertainty in a reported value for a quantity which can not be
uniquely defined independent of the situation may naturally be assumed
to be large and the quantity probably unreliable for general use. Such
is the case regarding conversion ratio, Mass balances for the nuclides
of interest are judged here to be basic data and uncertainty in reported
values is of considerable interest. Given uncertainty information for
the reference data (nuclide concentrations and broad-energy-group micro-
scopic cross sections), hopefully uncertainty in the calculated mass

balances can be established.

To study the uncertainty associated with a quantity which depends on
reaction rates, Equation 13 for the conversion ratio will be addressed.
An alternative formulation would not significantly alter the aspects

addressed here.

The change in conversion ratio from any cause is given directly in the

limit of zero change by

 

where x refers to most any variable. The collective effect of a number

of changes is given, to first order, by

8X, TI (55)
56

where § refers to a change in the quantity following it (as of a nuclide

concentration or of a microscopic cross section).

Let us consider an appropriate, specific neutron balance for a reactor

at some point in time:

Capture rate in fertile material 0.48
Absorption rate in fissile material 0.40
All other neutron losses 0.12

Total 1.00

This data yields a value of the conversion ratio,

_ 0.48 _
C= 0.40 1.20,

a breeding condition of course.

Consider that there are uncertainties associated with the reaction rates.
If there is a 95 percent confidence level of +5 percent in each (normal
distribution) an approximate 95 percent confidence level of uncertainty

in C is given from the skewed probable distribution by

0.48 + 0.024 _ +0.082 _ +0.068
C= 0.20 + 0.020 1:20 5.076 = 1-20 E 0.063

If these uncertainties were of equal density over fixed bands of #5

percent, direct calculation gives the extremes of uncertainty in C as

_ +0.126
¢=1.20 4 114

however, the probablity density drops off to zero at the extremes.
57

When uncertainties are normally distributed and quantities are additive,

the appropriate formulation is

1

Bto = (34) + Yo? , | (56)

where the quantities Y sum to the result B and may individually be posi-
tive or negative. Note that ¢ here refers to standard deviation (not
cross section); it may represent one standard deviation or any multiple
of it. A different form is desired for use here, one involving relative

uncertainties,

(57)

 

i = fY B = Y., .
since oy iti > i

Considering the form of the uncertainty contribution, Equation 26, the

appropriate weighting here evidently is

 

w

C(lL +f) =

od =X, liege +f, . (58)

58

_ 0.48 2 2 | _
CL: £) =o {i + Y (0.05) + (0.05) = 1.20 [1 + 0.071].

This result is in substantial agreement with the first result above.
However, one must address the situation carefully and be especially wary
of the precision and meaning of uncertainty estimates, especially so when

they are large.

Importance weighting may be applied given an appropriate function ¢* which
satisfies the specific situation within applied constraints .? Typically,
the local importance of capture by a fertile nuclide relative to the total

importance is given by

1 *
1, Mao E) ¢ (r,E) $ (r,E)drdE,

where

I - [fxr wo em ¢ (r,E) ¢*(r,E) dEdr.
r En

A change in N or 0 is expected to have a local relative importance of

i SIN, (r) o_ (n,E)] ¢ (r,E) ¢* (x,E) dEdr.

And the total of the contributions is the sum. Similarly there is a contribution

to the fuel absorption term, and a direct result is obtained from Equation (38).

A suitable weighting function is not simply defined; refer to the
expanding amount of literature on the subject and consider that
objectives may not be satisfied by simply improving the conversion
ratio.
29

Generally it would be fundamentally incorrect to report an uncertainty

in the conversion ratio based on the above or similiar analysis. Con-
sider the uncertainty in the microscopic capture cross section of a
fertile nuclide. If the cross section was actually higher than the value
used, the fertile loading might simply be reduced, thereby effecting about
the same reaction rates; the attempt would be made to hold No constant
in some integral sense. Consider that the cross section of structural
material was high; a lower value allows decrease in the fissile-to-fertile
nuclide ratio to effect a critical system which would be expected to
increase the conversion ratio. Yet the above equations do not consider
this aspect. More sophistication is deemed necessary. It may generally
be necessary to consider any specific situation special to assess the
uncertainty because of practical considerations. In analysis of a core
which satisfies design, performance requirements, some changes may be
admitted, others not. It will be assumed here that the heavy metal
content of the fuel pins or plates (the total inventory) can not be

adjusted.

A reactor plant is maintained at the state of criticality on the average
during its operation. Generally the estimate of fuel conversion is accurate
only if the calculation is an accurate approximation to this state;

otherwise, there is a direct contribution of uncertainty. When there is
a swing in the reactivity (control absorber requirement) then end-of-cycle

conditions must be satisfied; these may include a small amount of neutron

loss to control rods to allow operation. Those uncertainties which lead
60

to uncertainty regarding the satisfaction of end-of-cycle conditions will
make a direct contribution to the uncertainty in the estimate of any
neutron reaction rate integral, in conversion ratio and in doubling time

of a power industry consisting of breeder plants.

Example Effect of Uncertainty on Breeding Ratio

The situation is considered where it, is possible to adjust integrated
reaction rates in the heavy metals, as by changing concentrations, the
fertile and fissile loadings, or the positioning of specific fuel assem-
blies to alter importance. The assumption made is that if the absorption
rate in fuel is adjusted a given amount, the capture rate in fertile
material changes an equal amount of opposite sign. The equations for

breeding ratio and the multiplication factor applied are

R
B=

. NA

“a+rR+x "1 (n-1)A = R + X

where
B = the primitive breeding ratio
R = the neutron capture rate in fertile material
A = the neutron absorption rate in fuel
X = all other neutron losses
n = neutrons generated per neutron absorbed in fuel in the integral

sense (mo = vo).
61

The primary properties of the fuel are considered here to be % and n.
(See later discussion.) Consider that R is uncertain by AR. Allow
some adjustment within the constraint of k=1: (n-1)6A = 6R + AR. As
a first-order approximation, assume SA = -6R which might be effected by

adjusting concentrations,

The results for the approximation equations are summarized below; they are

adequate approximations.

B A nB
AB [n B+1

Fuel n B (3) B 1.8
AB (X_ -X (B+1

Other Losses B (%) nA ( B ) 0.18

Clearly the relative error in n is of primary concern. Some results are
sensitive to the specific values of n and B and therefore quite dependent
on the specific situation. Finally, the analysis presupposes that the
adjustments can be made--are not only physically possible but reasonable
within core design restraints--and that the low order approximation of
importance produces reasonable results. It is quite likely that imposing
physical and practical constraints causes symmetrical uncertainty data

(as of cross sections) to produce unsymmetrical uncertainties in results.

Note that the compensation significantly reduced the effect of uncertainty
in reaction rate on breeding ratio for capture in fertile or absorption

in fissile material:
66

 

 

Contributor Relative Effect
Uncompensated Compensated
Fertile Capture 1.0 0.10
Fuel Absorption -0.89 0.08
Fuel n 0 - 1.8
Other Losses 0 -0.18

 

Of course if the "other losses are uncertain, there will be an effect on
the conversion ratio, not reflected by the uncompensated result. So the
neutron balance must be considered. If a core design has been optimized
with reference cross sections, it may not be possible to achieve the full
reduction in uncertainty indicated above from the uncompensated ease to the

compensated one.

Uncertainty in the value of 1n of the fuel is identified as of most impor-

tance in the situation considered above.

It is also of interest to consider that more than one fertile nuclide and

more than one fissile nuclide are involved. Consider two of each.

Since AB = + ey (2 + te)

Thus the uncertainty contribution to that in B from a specific nuclide is

proportional to its relative contribution to the total reaction rate of

the type of interest.

When two fuels are involved, we should consider the effect of uncertainty

in n specifically;

It may be desirable to re-interpret the basic cross section data of the
fuel. Let us consider that v is known and that the equations are given by

considering the fission rate F and the capture rate y in fuel.

Consider the example case above and letting U = 0.12,

AB(F \  _

AB (U\
3 (i) - 0.24

Without compensation, these have values of -0.7 and -0.3 respectively.
Assuming that such compensation is necessary and can be achieved, the
indication is that uncertainty in either the fuel fission cross section

or the fuel capture cross section leads to more uncertainty in the breeding
ratio ( with compensation) than does the uncertainty in the fertile
material capture cross section (or than the absorption cross section of

the fuel given n), in the relative sense. Reasonable compensation does

not as dramatically reduce the associated uncertainty in the breeding

ratio as it can in the case of fertile capture.

It is noted that a more sophisticated mathematical analysis of uncertainty
is desirable than the rather pedestrian discussion above.l0 Still there
1s considerable utility in applying such analysis to assess the situation
in a direct way which is readily understood if the limitation on inter=~

pretation and use of such results is recognized.
70

There is difficulty associated with analysis of the effects of uncertain-
ties assoéiated with cross sections. Establishing realistic uncertainty

data is quite difficult considering the nature of experimental measurements.

Also, data is normalized in some sense to effect agreement with integral

measurements in the generation of "evaluated" data which is then used in

analysis; this procedure reduces uncertainty of the data, but the remaining

uncertainty is not easily established. Quite generally the analyst attempts
a reasonable assessment by selection from the possibilities. Often aspects

not considered lead to more uncertainty than predicted, while results are

reported as if they were absolute.
