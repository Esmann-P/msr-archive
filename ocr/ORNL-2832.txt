OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY FLUORIDE VOLATILITY PROCESS

A, P. Litman and A. BE. Goldman
SUMMARY

This report evaluates chemical corrosion on reaction vegsels and
equipment used during the fluorination of fused-salt fuels and subsequent
associated operations in the Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) Fluoride
Volatility Process and is a continuation and expansion of the Metallurgy
Division assistance Lo the Chemical Technology Division in this regard.

The Tluorination phase consists of converting uranium tetrafluoride to
volatile uranium hexafluoride by fluorine sparging of molten fluoride salts
and subsequent decontamination and recovery of the uranium hexafluoride.

For convenience in reporting, this document is divided into six sec-
tions, Sections I and TI describe the corrosion behavior of full-size
fluorination vessels fabricated from L nickel and used during Volatility
Pilot Plant (VPP) operations. Section III covers corrosion evaluations of
bench-scale fluorinators made of A nickel, Inconel, and INOR-8, which were
operated by the Volatility Studies Group, Chemical Development Section A,
of the Chemical Technology Division. Section IV describes scouting tests
of many proprietary and nonproprietary materials exposed to the pilot plant
fluorinator environments and the reactions of the various materials to
those service conditions. Appendix A shows selected photomicrographs of
the corrosion specimens described in Section IV. For comparison, results
of some of the corrosion tests performed by the Argonne National Laboratory
on metal coupons under simulated fluorination conditions are reported in
Section V. Section VI and Appendix B deal with results of examinations of
supplementary VPP equipment including a radiocactive-products trap, a
waste-salt line, the absorbers, valves and fittings, the fluorine-disposal
system, and process-gas lines.

In this report, corrosive attack is reported as mills per month based

on molten salt residence time or mils per hour based on fluorine exposure
time. These rates are included specifically for comparison purposes, ure
not exact, and should nol be extrapolated into longer time periods Tor
design work cy other applications,

Two flucrinators were used in the VPP to carry out the Iluorination
reactions. These vessels, Mark T and Mark 1I, were fabricated inte right
cylinders, approx b-1/2 £4 in height, from the same heat of L (low carbon)
nickel. The firsil vessel contained equimclar NaF~-ZrE), or NaF-7Zry) -UF),
(48-lS-!t mole %) for approx 1250 hr at (GO0-725°C. Over a period of (1 hr,
57 500 standard liters ofl Fa were sparged inte the salts. This constliuted
a FF :U mole ratio of 3:1 beyond theoretical requirements. The Mark IL
fluorinator contained fluoride salts of approximately the same compositions
plus small additions of PuF, during three runs. The salts were kept molten
at 5L0-730°C for approx 1950 hr and aboult (0 500 standard liters of EF, were
sparged into the Mark TT melts in 92 hr.

Both fluorinators sustained large corrosion losses consisting of exten-
sive wall thinning, severe interior intergranular attack, and a moderate
exterior oxidation attack. Maximum deterioration on the Mark [ vessel cc-
curred in the middle vapor region at a calculated rate of 1.2 mils/hr, based
on fluorine sparge time, or Lb mils/month, based on time of exposure to mol-
ten salts. The second vessel showed maximum attack in the salt-contzining
region at similarly calculated rates of 1.1 mils/hr and 60 mi ls/ month, Some
evidence was found to indicate that the intergramalar attack may have resulted
from sulfur in the systems. Bulk metal losses from the vessel's walls were

believed to be the result of cyclic losses of NiF,. "protective" films. ‘The

2
films were formed on the interior walls of the Tluorinators during conditioning
and fluorination treatments and lost as the result of rupturing, spalling,
Jluxing, washing actions, and/or dissolution in highly corrosive condensates
formed during operations. The shift in maximum corrosion attack geometry

in the two fluorinators is believed to have resulted from differences in
operating conditions. The Mark II vessel experienced higher temperafures,
longer fluorine exposure times, and extended uranium residence times in Its

salt baths.
- 3 ~-

Specimens removed from the wall of the Tirst [luorinator showed a
variation in average ASTM grain-size number of 5-6 to > 1, the largest grains
being Tound in the middle vapor region, The second vegsel had a more uniform
grain-size pattern, average ASTM grain-size numbers varying from 3-5 to oly,

The variations in grain sizes are believed to have resulted from variable
heating rates during initial usage. Low rates permit more complete internal
stress recovery prior to the start of recrystallization which results in
fewer nucleation sites and therefore larger grains during recrystallization,
Metallographic examinations did not provide evidence of a causal relationship
between grain size and fluorinator wall corrosion.

Examinations of bench-gcale reactors, where simulated fluorination
enviromments were provided to study process variables and corrosion, showed
that A nickel had the highest degree of corrosion resistance as a fluorinator
material of construction when compared with Inconel and TNOR-8. Intergranular
penetration and subsequent sloughing of whole grains seemed to be the pre-
dominant mode of corrosive attack on the Inconel vessel, At the higher tes
temperatures, 600°C, INOR-8 miniature fluorinators showed large bulk metal
losses plus selective losses of chromium, molybdenum, and iron from the exposed
alloy surfaces. Evidence of a marked reduction in attack on nickel and INOR-8
was found during lower temperature studies al 450-525°C. These lower tempera-
ture operations were made possible by adding lithium fluoride to the sodium
fluoride~-zirconium tetrafluoride salt mixtures.

Scouting corrosion tests were performed in the VPP's fluorinators using
rod, sheet, or wire specimens of commercial and developmental alloys. These
tests were subjected to serious limitations due to the lack of control over
operating conditions and thus considerable variation in the corrosion of L
nickel control specimens resulted. Those nickel-rich alloys containing iron
and cobalt showed some superiority in corrosion resistance when compared with
I nickel specimens. Yhis was probably because of the low volatility of iron
and cobalt fluorides. WNickel-rich alloys containing molybdenum additions
showed variable behavior in the [luorination environment. Some of the data

suggesbed improved resistance over IL nickel while other tests showed the reverse.
ho

Since both of the known molybdenum fluorides that could be formed during
fluorination have very high volatility, one would not expect improved resistance
from molybdenum additions. The experiments emphasize that the present method
of selection of test materials based on the low volatility of metal fluorides
tnat may form during {luorination continues to have merit. Additional ex-
perimental nickel-base alloy corrosion specimens, containing magnesium, alumi-
num, iron, cobalt, or manganese, have been fabricated and will be used in
future screening tests in a subsequent pilot plant fluorinator.

A review of one fluorination test series conducted by the Argonne
National Laboratory gave general agreement with ORNL scouting corrosion test
specimen results, although comparisons were hampered by different test con-
ditions. The Argonne National Laboratory has suggested that the corrosion
problem be attacked by further studies on the use of cold wall vessels, spray
towers, or low-melting salts for volatility processes.

Visual and metallographic examinations plus ultrasonic measurements of
other VPP vessels and equipment Tabricated generally from Monel or Inconel
showed a wide variation in resistance to those various local service condi-
tions. The studies suggest that Tnconel can continue to be used as a material
of construction for some components but frequent inspections are indicated.
Monel appears generally satisfactory for the applications to date.

From a corrosion standpoint, the Iluorination vessel in the VPP continues
to be the most vulnerable to attack due to the nature of the contained en-
vironment and the high temperature necessary for fluorination. The continued
use of IL nickel Tor the fluorination vessel does not appear prohibitive for
batch operations only due to the present high value of the pilot plant's
product. At present, the only guarantee for improved service life for nickel
fluorinators seems tc be utilization of the lowest practical temperature,
Although not conclusively proven for the fluorination vessels, reduction of
sulfur contamination and the ensuring of a uniform, small-grain si.e in the
vessels may improve vessel performance. For long-time fluorinator integrity,
selection or development of a new material of construction, the use of salts

with lower melting points, or the use of a cold wall vessel seems necessary.

The evaluation of process corrosion thal occurred during the develop-
ment studies of hydrogen fluoride dissolution of uranium-bearing fuel elements,
the head-end cycle of the volatility process, will be covered in a separate

report. s

I. Mark I Volatility Pilot Plant L Nickel Fluorinator

 

A. Material Selection and Fabrication

 

The selection of material for the first pilot plant fluorinator was
made by members of the Chemical Technology Division after a study of the availl-
able corrosion literature and the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vesgel Coe. ”7 3
Nickel seemed to be the most likely candidate material of construction, although
at 600-700°C, the anticipated operating temperature range of the fluorinator,
Myers and Delong reported penetration rates of fluorine on nickel of 16-34
mils/month. The ASME Code allowable design stress data above approx 315°C
were not available for commercial purity A nickel (0.05-0.15 wt % C). This
was because of the known effects of embrittlement through intercrystalline
precipitation of graphite in nickel containing carbon after long-time exposure

>

to high temperatures. However, satisfactory design data were avallable for
low-carbon L nickel at approx 650°C, so this material was selected for the
first pilot plant fluorinator.
The Mark I Tluorinator was fabricated at ORNL from I. nickel using a

heat with the vendor's analysis of 99.36% Ni—0.02% C~0.23% Fe-0.06% Cu—0,26% Mn
0.04% 8i—0.005% S. Annealed plate stock of 1/4-in. thickness was rolled into

B. Operational History

The Marx I fluorinator was used by the Unit Operations Scetion of
the Chemical 'schnology Division auring preliminary {luorination equipment
studies for a period of about three monlhs. During thal time, no i'lucrine or
uranium-containing molten salts were in contact wilh the vessel. Table T
cites the process conditions in detail for those studies and for the more
extensive "M" equipment shakedown ana "C" process demonstralion runs verformed
later in tne VPP.

Figure 2 shows the position of the Mark T fluorinator during the VPP
runs while ¥ig, 3 shows the interior piping, gas dispersion assembly, and the
placement of an early group oi corrosion lest specimens. The lower hall of
the fluorination vessel was surrounded by a vertical lube-type electric-
resistance furnace of 30-kw raling to provide the necessary heal (600-725°C)
for operations. During the pilot plant runs, rod-~type electric resistance
heating elements with a total rating of 9 kw were installed on the upper ex-
terior walls of the fluorinator.

Prior to exposing the fluorinator to elemental fluorine during actual
fluorination of the fused salts, a "conditioning" cycle was performed wherein
fluorine was introduced into the vessel which was heated to 20-150°C to
induce the formation of NiF, "protective" films. Fluorine used in the VPP
was obtained in steel tank trailers Trom the Oak Ridge Caseous Diffusion
Plant (ORGDP) fluorine generating station. A flowing stream sample analyued

by ORGDP personnel indicated the analysis of the fluorine was 95% TF < 5% HF,

and 1-2% Ny and/or 0 Prior to use of the fluorine in the VPP, the gas was

passed through a rived NaF pellet bed at approximately ambient temperatures.
Under these conditions, the hydrogen fluoride content in the fluorine was
lowered to approx 20 ppm. (ef 7)

After conditioning, the system was purged with commercial grade
nitrogen dried to < 1 ppm H,0. The nitrogen contained approx 100 ppm 0,
which was not removed. The fluorinator was heated to approx 600°C along with
the salt freeze valve and salt inlet line. The latter two components were
heated by autoresistance. Then a batch of fluoride salt was melted in the
charge melt tank and drained by gravity flow into the Tluorinator.

Fluorine was bubbled through the molten salt to convert any UF), in
the salt to volatile UF. During fluorination, the vessel operated with
approx 25% of its volume filled with about 50 liters of fused salts. The re-
maining 75% of the volume contained variable quantities of fluorine, uranium
hexafluoride, nitrogen, and various metal fluorides of high or intermediate
volatility. During the process demonstration "C" runs, an average mole ratio
of 3:1 (F,:0) beyond theoretical requirements was used in order to reduce the
final uranium concentration in the salt to a few parts per million.

While the vessel wall in the salt-containing region of the Tluorina-
tion vessel reached temperatures of 600-725°C, the upper vapor region remained
at lower temperatures. The maximum temperature recorded on a thermocouple
attached to the exterior wall of the fluorinator 12 in. down from the slip-on
flange was 500°C. The average temperature in this same region was about Lhoo°c.

After completion of fluorination, the waste salt left in the Iluori-
nator was pressure transferred through a freeze valve into a waste container;
and the gas from the fluorinator was passed through an Inconel trap, containing
either nickel mesh or NaF pellets, which was maintained at approx 4oo°c. Prior
to Run C-9, the trap contained nickel mesh for the purpose of collecting ZTE),
"snow," and thereafter the unit contained NaF pellets to trap entrained salt,
chromium, and zirconium fluorides. During and after Run C-9, the trap was

termed a "CRP" or complexible radioactive products trap.

Plant Equipment, CF-60-7-65, Section 15, p, 2206.

Downstream from the Snow-CRP trap, the product stream was diverted
through absorbers containing NaF at 65-150°C to absorb the UF. The un-
absorbed gas, mostly fluorine, was routed through a chemical trap (a NaF bed
at ambient temperature) to retain any residual UF and subsequently through
a KOH gas disposal unit to neutralize the fluorine before being exhausted to
the atmosphere. The product, UF, was desorbed from the absorber bed by
heating it to approx 400°C in a fluorine atmosphere and then passed through
two cold traps maintained at -40°C and -55°C where the UF condensed. The
cold traps were isolated from the rest of the fluorination system and heated

to approx 80°C to liquate the UF, which drained into a heated product cylinder.

C. Reaction to Environment

 

Ultrasonic-thickness measurements of the fluorinator were made with
an "Audigage," an ultrasonic-thickness measurement device, after the Unit
Operation's preliminary fluorination equipment studies. No detectable metal
losses could be found in either the shell of the vessel or in the bottom head;
this could be expected because no fluorine, uranium-bearing salts, or UF was
present during the short period of operation at elevated temperature and what-
ever attack occurred was so slight as to be undetected by the measuring

equipment.
1. Chemistry

During VPP Run C-6, a study was made of the interior deposits
which formed on the wall of the fluorinator. Figure 4 shows the location and
subsequent chemical analyses of these deposits. These data indicate a tendency
for chromium, presumably from impure feed salts, and uranium to collect in the
middle vapor region of the vessel. The values shown for nickel indicate that
extensive corrosive attack had occurred in the system during operations.

After completion of the "M" and "C" runs described in Table I,
the Mark I fluorinator was turned over to Metallurgy for corrosion evaluation.
Figure 5 shows the interior of the fluorinator after retirement. Most of the

interior walls of the vessel below the molten salt levels were free of surface

and corrosion products. A solid ring of material, about 1 in. in cross sec-
tion, was present on the interior of the vessel wall at about the same
elevation as the exterior furnace seal. This was a few inches above the
average elevation of the vapor-salt interfaces. Samples of some of these
interior deposits were submitted for chemical analyses and identification by

Most of the salt deposits were removed by washing the interior
of the vessel with a mixture of 0.7 M H 05, 1.8 M KOH, and 0.4 M Na C,H, Of at
room temperature, aided by hand chipping. After cleaning, another visual

inspection was made and the results are given as follows:

Region Results

Vapor Smooth, etched appearance near the top of the vessel with iso-
lated, shallow pits. A yellow-to-green deposit encircled the
vessel from a point approx 10 in. down to a point approx 20 in.
from the top. Several small areas of flaking and scaling were
noted at approx 16 in. from the top in the deposit zone. The
area from 20 in. down to approx 24 in. from the top had a bluish
cast and was rougher in texture than the top section.

Vapor-salt Smooth metallic appearance with distinct indentations encircling

interface the vessel at several levels.
Salt Smooth metallic appearance. Flange-to-vessel weld not noticeably
corroded.

In the middle vapor region, a tightly adherent, yellow-to-green deposit re-
mained on the wall of the fluorinator. Samples of this deposit, surface, and
subsurface millings, were removed and submitted for chemical analyses. Figure 6
details the results which indicate that chromium which had previously been
found to collect in the upper vapor region of the fluorinator had penetrated
into the vessel wall to some depth greater than 10 mils. This chromium con-
centration gradient was found both in the upper and middle vapor regions al-
though higher concentrations were found in the former region. No excessive

quantities of sulfur over that present in the base material were found.

2. Dimensional Analysis

 

Micrometer measurements were taken in the three major regions of
the Tluorinator in all guadrants and show the greatest wall-thickness losses
to be concentrated in the vapor region of the vessel shell. Figure 7 shows
a schematic drawing of the vessel and denotes the sections that were removed
from the vessel for these measurements and for metallographic study. The loss
data are given in Table III. A full-length vessel section was removed from
the northeast-by-east quadrant and micrometer measurements taken every vertical
inch to establish a corrosion wall-thickness-loss profile. Figure 8 shows this
plot and pinpoints the maximum metal loss of 47 mils as approx 12 in. below

the bottom of the slip-on flange.

3. Metallographic Study

 

Based on the corrosion wall-thickness-loss profile plot, areas
were selected from the full-length section of the fluorinator and from previ-
cusly trepanned samples for metallographic study. The location of these
areas is shown in Fig. 8. In the as-polished condition, some slight roughening
of the surfaces of the samples was noted. No grain-boundary modifications
such as is common to intergranular corrosive attack could be found.

After etching with an 0.5% HCl, approx 60% HC. H.O. and approx L0%

27372
HNO. mixture, the grain boundaries of the interior surface samples appeared

3

darkened below the exposed surfaces to depths varying from 4 to 25 mils.
Figure 8 illustrates the typical structures found at varying elevations on
the interior surfaces of the fluorinator wall. The deepest penetrations were
found on samples from the middle vapor region of the vessel, the vapor-salt
interface, and the salt region of the fluorinator. The exterior surface sam-
ples also showed intergranular attack varying from 3 to 8 mils in depth.

Widely variant grain sizes were found in the metallographic sam-~
ples examined. A summary of these sizes, converted to average ASTM grain-size
numbers, is shown in Table IV.

Grain sizes from interior wall and exterior wall samples were approxi-

At a later date, in an attempt to determine the reasons for the
variant grain size, diffractometer traces were obtained on selected samples
removed from the wall of the Mark I fluorinater. Samples were taken from
the 1-, 12-1/2-, and 43-in. levels, respectively, below the bottom of the
vessel slip-on flange. The maximum amount of residual strain was noted for
the 1-in. sample with little, if any, evidence of recrystallization having
taken place during the Mark T operations. A very limited amount of recrystal-
lization appeared to have occurred in the 12-1/2-1in, sample since there seemed
only slightly less strain present in this sample when compared to the one
above. The 43-in.-sample traces showed considerably less residual strain
present than either of the other samples. The indications were that partial,
if not complete, reecrystallization had taken place in the lower portion of
the fluorinator wall.

Figure 9 shows a section through the girth weld which was
located in the salt phase of the fluorinator. After etching, the specimen
showed no corrosive attack at low magnification. At higher magnification,
the weld deposit showed a grain-boundary attack similar to that found in the
base metal, but to a lesser degree of severity.

Early work on L nickel corrosion rods placed in the Mark I
fluorinator indicated sulfur contamination was probably a factor in the cor-
rosive attack of the vessel.o In view of the lack of evidence from chemical
analyses, other altempts were made to prove the presence of sulfur at the
grain boundaries of interior wall specimens from the Mark I fluorinator.

The use of sulfur print papers did not provide positive evidence
of the existence of sulfur compounds at the mating surfaces of the grains.

One sample from the middle vapor region of the fluorinator did present the
colors described as needed for the identification of nickel sulfide.

Figure 10 shows the grain-boundary deposit at the 12-in. level below the
bottom of the slip-on flange after etching with cyanide-persulfate and partial
repolishing to show the deposit to its best advantage. However, duplicate

results could not be obtained with the method.

Sulfur in almost any chemical form in contact with nickel at
high temperatures will result in the formation of a low-melting nickel-nickel
sulfide eutectic primarily along grain boundaries, leading to embrittlement

9

of the material. Consequently, samples of the fluorination vessel wall were
bend tested. The samples did not show brittle behavior.

Two other techniques were considered as identification methods
for the grain-boundary deposits described. One was the use of a microchisel,
presently under development by the Metallography Group of the Metallurgy
Division, by which some of the grain-boundary deposit could be removed and
subsequently submitted for x-ray diffraction analysis. The very small size
of the grain-boundary deposits prevented the microchisel's usage in this
situation. The second technique considered was the use of an electron probe
microanalyzer which could possibly identify a small portion of the deposit by
x-ray diffraction analysis, in situ. Such an instrument is not yet available
at ORNL and it was not possible to obtain service time on the few instruments

currently in operation in this country. Consequently, the nature of the Mark

fluorinator grain-boundary deposits was left in doubt.

4. Summary of Corrosive Attack

 

Table V summarizes the maximum corrosion losses of all types
found in the three major regions of the VPP Mark I fluorinator. The maximum
attack was calculated to be 46 mils/month based on exposure time to molten
salts during the VPP "M" runs (1-48) and "C" runs (1-15) or 1.2 mils/hr based
on fluorine sparge time during fluorination of molten salts. The maximum

attack occurred in the middle vapor region.

peared to hold, but at higher temperatures, 500 to 600°C, a parabolic behavior

seemed prevalent.

Nickel was found to form a continuous, adherent fluoride film with an un-
diluted fluorine atmosphere at temperatures up to about 980°C. Electron
microscopy indicated that the nickel fluoride films had few flaws in the in-
dividual crystals which would permit direct access of the fluoride to the
nickel surface underneath. The studies also indicated that, as the nickel
fluoride film thickened, more resistance to attack was obtained. However,
considerable intergranular attack of the metallic nickel was noted at tempera-
tures of approx 815 and 980°C (Fig. 12). The depth of intergranular penetra-
tion was estimated to be 5 to 8 times the average attack as calculated from
scale formation. The report indicated that the primary mechanism of attack
appeared to be diffusion along the crystal boundaries.

The second major corrosive agent placed in contact with the

Mark T fluorination vessel during operations was UF. The effect of this
compound on metals had undergone investigation in comnection with the design,
construction, and operation of the orgop. +1 Some recent work at the same site
indicated that on A nickel samples which were coated with nickel fluoride films
of 37 000 and 7! 000 A, the average penetration of the nickel by ur, at about
815°C, calculated from the average nickel fluoride scale formation, appeared
to be about one third of that experienced with fluorine at about 700°, (¥ef 16)
Later work by the same group indicated that at times one order of magnitude

greater (hundreds of hours versus tens of hours) NiF_ is lost by vaporization

2
and/or a reaction process so that catastrophic attack can occur by additional

UF, contact.
The nickel exposed to the UF, at those elevated temperatures ex-

hibited a grain-boundary attack beneath the fluoride scale quite similar to

that experienced in the exposures to fluorine. It was also observed that
both nickel fluoride and UF, corrosion products had appreciable vapor pres-
sures at Lhose test temperalbures and were observed to migrate to the cooler
portions of the reactor by vapor-phase transfer,

In addition to Fy and UF, fused~fluoride salts were also in
contact with the Mark T VPP fluorinator. Al ORNL, considerable progress has
been made in determining material compatibility in various Tused-Tfluoride~
salt systems through the Aircraft Reactor Experiment and Molteun-Salt Reactor
Projects.’ Nickel-base alloys were found to be, in general, superior to other
commercial alloys Tor the containment of fluoride salt mixtures under dynamic

low conditions.

2. Collective Attack During Fluorination

 

The fluorination cycle of the fluoride volatility process pro-
duced greater corvosive attack by the collective system of Fo, UF, and fused
Fluoride salts on nickel than had been reported for the individual constituents.
During VPP operations, the Mark I L-nickel fluorinator displayed maximum cor-
rosion rate losses of 1.2 mils/hr, based on F, sparge time, or 46 mils/month,
based on molten-salt residence time during VPP "M" runs (1-48) and "C" runs
(1-15). These rates include wall thickness or metal losses as determined by
dimensional analysis plus intergranular penetration as determined by metallo-
graphic examination. The rates are generally consistent with early bench-scale
work on the volatility process. 0

For convenience in reporting, the proposed reasons for the high
corrosive attack on the fluorination vessel will be discussed under four major
headings: (a) Interior Bulk Losses, (b) Interior Intergranular Attack,

(c) Exterior Intergramilar Attack, and (4) Grain-Size Variations.

a, Interior Bulk Losses

 

The first portion of this section described "conditioning"
treatments whereby nickel fluoride was induced on the walls of the Mark TI
fluorinator prior to actual high-temperature operations. This was in harmony
with prevailing generalizations concerning passive fluoride films, which, when
formed on exposed metal surfaces may inhibit further attack by elemental
fluorine. However, based upon ORGDP and Argonne National Laboratory work, 10,21
it appears that passivation temperature should have been equal to, or greater
than, the operating temperature, rather than 20-150°C, in order to induce
greater Tilm thicknesses. The work by Hale et al,, indicated that while cor-
rosive attack on nickel by flucrine did not cease after the nickel fluoride
film thickened, additional resistance to attack was obtained at test tempera-
tures up to 980°C. Considering the very high rate losses found on samples
removed from the wall of the first VPP fluorinator, it would appear that
conditions were present in the vessel which (1) did not allow sufficient film
thickening to occur, (2) reduced the protectivity of thickened nickel fluoride
films, or (3) permitted catastrophic losses of the nickel fluoride films.

Free fluorine was present, periodically, during all of the
VPP operations in quantities above those amounts necessary to oxidize any
UF), in the fluoride salt mixtures to Uk. Thug, even though catastrophic
losses of old nickel fluoride films might occur, new films would have oppor-
tunity to form. Therefore, a continuous cycle of initial loss, reformation,
and secondary loss of the nickel fluoride films forming on the walls of the
Tluorinator is proposed as the method whereby the large losses of bulk metal
occurred.

This proposed loss cycle could be initiated and maintained
in several ways depending on the region of the fluorination vessel under con-
sideration, In the salt region, fused fluoride salt baths could dissolve the

nickel fluoride Films until saturation of the baths with nickel fluoride
occurred. It has been reported that NiFp is soluble in eguimolar Naf-ZrF)
to the extent of 1.8 wt % at 700°¢. (ref 22)

At the vapor-salt interface, similar dissolution could have
occurred to remove protective wall films. Also, a washing action caused by the
fluorine sparge agitation and the rise and fall of the bath level could aid
film removal.

In the vapor region, where maximum metal losses occurred,
nickel fluoride films that have limited plasticity at the lower operating
temperatures might be lost through cracking or rupturing. Also, the dif-
ference in linear coefficients of thermal expansion of nickel and nickel
fluoride would be sufficient to exaggerate the spalling tendency. These
actions may also occur in the other two major regions of the fluorination
vessel, but the other loss mechanisms described for those areas would proba
bly predominate.

Cathers has suggested an additional mode of film loss for
the vapor region, i.e., dissolution of nickel fluoride in very highly corrosive

23

liquids which condense in the cooler zones of the fluorinator.’ Fluoride
compounds of intermediate volatility such as those containing high-valent
chromium, sulfur, titanium, and/or silicon, might be responsible, This con-
densate is pictured as being extremely variable in composition (possibly
including HF and water vapor, if they were unintentionally admitted into the
system) and in dissolution ability. After the condensate forms in a rela~-
tively cold region of the vessel, it would run down the wall toward a higher
temperature zone, where it could then dissolve the nickel fluoride surface
films, Progressing further down the walls of the vessel, it would eventually
reach a temperature zone where it could reflux, and leave with the product

stream or re-enter into the vessel corrosion environment.

Support 1s given to the Cathers' suggestion in view of
the design used for the VPP fluorination vessel and the results of the chemi-
cal studies on the interior wall deposits from the vapor region of the vessel,
The Mark I fluorinator heating system was designed to produce cooler tempera-
tures in the upper regions of the vessel. The maximun temperature recorded
on a thermocouple attached to the exterior vessel wall 12 in. below the
slip-on flange was 500°C, while the average temperature in the same region
was 400°C. The thought was that a cooler top vessel zone would permit
deposition of low volatility compounds that might entrap uranium products.
After some indefinite time of deposition, it was felt that these layers
would gradually fall back into the salt baths and become available for fur-
ther fluorination.

In support of the condensable corrosive liquid theory,
chemical analyses of residual wall deposits and millings from the fluori-
nator vessel walls in the middle vapor region (Figs. 4 and §) showed high
concentrations of uranium and chromium. Thus, it would seem that entrain-
ment of uranium and redeposition of materials containing uranium did occur
and that chromium was a part of the entrapping agent or agents.

Rather than describing the agents which seem to have aided
the corrosion progress in the middle vapor region as condensable liquids
which dissolve nickel {luoride, favor is given to the idea that the nickel
fluoride complexed with other more volatile fluorides, the combination of
which have lower melting points than nickel fluoride. It has been reported
that nickel fluoride complexes easily and that many combinations are renown. S
A complex of NiF, and high valent chromium fluoride appears to be a parti-
cularly wood possibility.

Of interest in discussing the wall-thickness losses on the
Mark I fluorinator is the region slightly above the salt-vapor interface where

very low losses were found. In this same region, a ring of deposited material

eee eesti

was found after operations. Unfortunately, chemical analyses were not ob-
tained on the deposit. However, the fact that this thick ring was present,
probably continuously during operations, 1s believed to have prevented inter-
actions with the nickel fluoride "protective" surface films undernzath and
thereby prevented high losses in that region. he reason for the formation
and continued presence of the ring is associated with the low temperatures

that predominated in this region. The location is between the furnace windings
and the tubular-type heating elements attached to the upper portion of the
vessel. Also, the presence of the furnace seal on the exterior of the Tluori-
nator at this same elevation probably affected temperature by acting as a

gink for conducted heat in this region.

b. Interior Intergranular Attack

 

In the "as-polished” condition, interior surface samples from
the Mark I fluorinator showed no sign of intergranular corrosive attack. After
etching with a strong acid solution, a mixture of 0.5% HCl, approx 40% HNO,

and approx 60% BCH 0, the surface grain boundaries to depths of from 4-25 mils

were atlacked more  verely and rapidly than grain boundaries closer to the
interior of the specimens. Using a mild etchant, KCN- (NH), ) ,8,,0g, and partial
repolishing, a pale yellow deposit was observed at the mating surfaces of the
grains. The appearance of the intergranular attack on the fluoriunator walls
was distinctly different than that produced in nickel by fluorine or UF, (with
an initial nickel fluoride film) and reported by Hale et 21.7?

The formation of grain-boundary compounds or other changes in
grain-boundary regions, such as those observed, and which are generally catego-
rized as intergranular corrosion attack, often result in the loss or “sloughing”
of entire grains from the exposed surface of the material. However, metallo-
graphic examinations of specimens from the fluorinator revealed relatively
smooth surfaces.

- 36 -

Some circumstantial evidence was available to indicate that
sulfur contamination produced the grain-boundary modifications observed. In
addition to previously reported work? where microstructures of nickel speci-
mens purposely embrittled with sulfur were compared with early VPP L nickel
corrosion specimens, a communication from ORGDP, which supplied the VPP with
process fluorine, indicated that as much as 200 ppm of sulfur as sulfuryl
fluoride had occasionally been detected in their manufactured fluorine.
Contamination from the commercial sodium fluoride used to strip hydrogen
fluoride and water from the process fluorine could also be a source of sulfur.
Sulfur could also be introduced into the system from impure feed salts or from
trace quantities contained in corrosion test specimens.

Attempts to prove the presence of sulfur in the fluorinator
wall samples in quantities greater than thal present in the base metal by
using sulfur print papers, chemical analyses of surface millings and wall
deposits, bend tests, and various metallographic techniques either met with
failure or produced inconclusive results. This was particularly frustrating
in view of early reports that free Ni_S. had been identified in nickel micro-

3e 28,29

scopically when 0.05 and 0.005 wt % 8, respectively, were present. Exam-

ination of the nickel-sulfur constitution diagram indicated that NLS, would
be the compound to seek in identifying low percentages of sulfur contamination

30

in nickel. It was considered that chromium znd/or other system contaminants

may have complexed the NL.8, and thus prevented identification by some of the

described methods. However, considering the extensive efforts employed on the
Tfluorinator samples, if sulfur were the major agent responsible for the inter

granular attack, more positive indications should have been found.

The nature of the grain-boundary deposits may not be deter-
mined until they are studied by an electron probe microanalyzer or some other
precise tool. Nevertheless, because of the potential effect on corrosion and
the cumulative and irreversible embrittling tendencies of the nickel-nickel
sulfide eutectic, reduction of sulfur in VPP nickel fluorinator's environ-

ments to the lowest possible levels is essential.

¢. Exterior Intergranular Attack

 

As described, the exterior of the Mark I Tluorinator shell
also suffered intergranular attack, but to a lesser degree than the interior.
Penetration on the exterior surfaces varied from 3-8 mils. The appearance
of this attack at nigh magnification, the exterior environment, and the
presence of N10, found on the second VPP fluorinator operated under similar
conditions, indicate typical high-temperature intergranular oxidation of

nickel.

d. Grain-B8ize Variations

 

Metallographic examination of samples removed from the shell
of the Mark I fluorinator disclosed widely variant grain sizes. Small, uniform
grains of 5-6 average ASTM grain-size number prevailed in the salt and salt-
vapor interface regions, while much larger grains were observed in most of the
vapor region. The largest grains Tound in the vapor region were at an eleva-
tion of approx 12 in. below the bottom of the slip-on flange. The average
ASTM grain-size number at the 12 in. elevation was greater than 1. Diffractom-
eter traces were obtained on vessel samples removed from the 1-, 12-1/2-, and
13-in. levels in order to compare the residual strain remaining in the samples.
The results indicated approximately no recrystallization had occurred at the
l1-in. level, only a very limited amount of recrystallization took place at
the 12-1/2-1in. level, and partial, if not complete, recrystallization occurred
in the salt-phase sample,

The classical factors which determine crystallite growth upon
heating are amount of prior cold deformation, annealing temperature, and

annealing time. Generally, larger amounts of cold deformation provide for
- 38 -

smaller resultant grain sizes after isothermal and constant time annealing.
Higher temperatures and, to a lesser degree, longer times result in larger
grain sizes on material containing some fixed amount of cold work.

In many materials a small amount of prior cold deformation
results in the production of exaggerated grains after annealing at ordinary
times and temperatures. In these cases, the term "critical strain” has been
given to the quantity of cold work originally introduced. The mechanisms
involved here have been studied and reported in detail, >t

The VPP Mark T fluorinator was fabricated from L nickel by
converting a flat, annealed, 1/k-in. plate into a 1b-in.-diam right cylinder
by roll forming. During forming, cold deformation was induced in the outer-
most fibers of the shell to a calculated maximum of approx 2%. This amount

"eritical strain" for most

of cold work is at the right level to be fermed
metals and presumably was present along the entire length of the fluorinator
shell. However, exaggerated grain sizes were observed only in a portion of
the vapor phase of the vessel after pilofl plant operations. Therefore, an
additional variable, rate of heating after prior deformation, has been sug-
ested as the most influential factor in producing the grain sizes found in
the Mark I fuori nator. 5°
The first time the fluorinator was heated was during pre-
liminary Tluorination equipment studies. During those cycles, the lower
23 in. of the vessel was surrounded by a high heat-flux 30-kw electric-
resistance furnace which raised the temperature of the enclosed portion of
the vessel to approx 450°C. No external heat or insulation was in close
proximity with the upper portion of the fluorinator. Later cycles during
the same preliminary studies were done with a glass-lined heating mantle
covering the top portions of the fluorinator. Temperatures in the lower re-
glons of the vessel reached 600~700°C, while temperatures in the upper regions

of the vessel were much lower.

- 39 -

In view of the initial Mark 1 heating cycles, and confirmed
by the diffractometer traces, the salt region of the [luorinator appears to
have experienced thermal levels where recovery and at least partial recrystal-
lization occurred, The recrystallization temperature for nickel varies from
approx 600°C for A nickel, 99.4 wt % (Ni + Co) to 370-470°C for various
purities of electrolytic nickel, 99.9" wt 4% (Ni + Co) after 50% reduction by
cold rolling and annealing for 1 hr at the temperature indicated. >> Jetter
and McHargue have suggested that during the initial heating the rapid rate
of heating did not allow complete relief of internal stresses which at higher
temperatures served as nucleation sites for recrystallization. The rate of
appearance of these nuclei is known to increase with time, exponentially with
temperature, and with increasing amounts of prior cold deformation. After
nucleation, stable nucleus growth occurred and the presence of so many grains
growing in a fixed volume limited the salt region grain size. Later heat
cycling of the fluorinator was done al approximately the same temperature
levels as the highest original heating (600-725°C) so that probably little, if
any, grain-boundary migration occurred after recrystallization to increase the
grain size in the lower portions of the vessel.

The top half of the Mark T fluorinator sustained lower tempera-
tures during the first heat cycles as the result of heat losses by radiation
and convection from the upper portions of the vessel wall. A steady state
temperature of < 200°C at the 12-in. level has been estimated." The upper
portions of the vessel also experienced sluggish heating rates when compared
to that portion of the vessel enclosed by the heating furnace. It has been
suggested that the latter influenced the grain size in the vapor region by
permitting more complete recovery and resulting in few nucleation sites,

During later operations in the pilot plant, rod-type electric
heating elements with a total rating of 9 kw were in contact with the vapor

region exterior surfaces of the fluorinator. A thermocouple at approximately
the 12-in. level indicated average temperatures of 400°C and a maximum of
500°C. Such thermal levels permitted only a small amount of recrystallization
to occur, as indicated by the diffractometer studies. An extremely coarse
grain size resulted from the described conditions.

Examination of samples removed from the Mark I fluorinator
revealed that the metal-loss profile and grain-size profile closely paral-
leled one another except for the region just below the top flange of the
vessel. Because of the evidence of corrosion by intergranular attack during
exposure to the volatility fluorination environment, a causal relationship
is suggested. Thus, loss of a large graln by effectively losing grain-boundary
material until the grain sloughs off would mean greater losses than for the
same procedure happening in fine-grain regions. However, sloughing of grains
was not observed and only a slight widening of the boundaries was noted at
the Junction of the boundaries and the exposed metal surfaces. Also, the
depth of intergranular penetration in coarse~-grain reglons was about the same
as in most of the fine-grain regions. The conclusion is that metal loss and
grain size do not seem to be interrelated in the corrosion of the Mark T
fluorinator.

However, for two reasons, the authors recommend using fine-
grained material for fluorination vessels. One, a higher strength level will
be achieved in nickel, a material not noted for superior strength; and two,
one variable will be removed in a system replete with variables, Hine-grained
material can be provided by modification of the specifications of purchased

35

stock and by revising the annealing cycle after fabrication.

A, Material Selection and Fabrication-Design Changes

 

While L nickel seemed deficient in its corrosion resistance for long-

time service, no other commercially available material. had, at that time, proved

itself on the basis of scouting or other tests to be worthy of immediate sub-
stitution as a fluorinator material of construction. Moreover, the heavy
vapor-phase attack on the Mark I fluorinator was still under investigation,
so that the use of the same construction material seemed especially appropriate
to ascertain more about this corrosion problam. Consequently, the Mark IT
fluorinator was fabricated in the ORNL shops from the same heat of 1/L-in.-
thick L nickel as was used in the previous pilot plant vessel. Analogous
fabrication techniques were used. Figure 13 shows the second VPP Tluorinator,
the vessel furnace, and the complexible radioactive products (CRP) trap.
Certain design changes were Incorporated in the second pilot plant
fluorinator, In order to provide for remote handling and to allow desirable
upward flow through the CRP trap, its location was changed from the original
side position shown in Fig. 1 to an elevation completely above the Mark II
fluorinator. Other process design changes included some modification of the
draft tube assembly, repositioning of the off-gas line, and installation of a

36

small port in the top blind flange of the fluorinator for observation and entry.
B. Operational History

The Mark II fluorinator was placed in service at the beginning of
the "E" runs during which time fuel used in the Aircraft Reactor Experiment
was reprocessed.’ The use of the vessel was continued during the "L'" (spiked)
runs and during the gas-entrainment studies, M-62 through M-6L. The process
history, summarized in Table VI, has been divided into three phases for con-
venience in reporting the Vidigage inspections on the vessel at the completion
of Runs L-% and 1-9.

The "L'" or spiked runs were made in the VPP to extend process develop-
ment data and used a nonirradiated salt with fully enriched uranium, 3° Some

During three of the "L" runs, selective additions of PuF, were added to the
feed salt so as to gather information on the behavior of plutonium in the

39

volatility process, Previous experiments had indicated that some volatili-
zation of PuF, would occur. However, greater than 99% of the plutonium
remained in the salt in the fluorinator during the "L'" runs.

Several months after the "L" runs were completed, the Mark IT fluori-
nator was used to study gas-phase entrainment problems in the VPP. © These
runs, M-62 through M-6kL, investigated ZrF) solid condensation in the vapor
phase. Barren equimolar NaF-ZrF) salt was used in these studies and fluorine

was not present.

C. Reaction to Environment

 

1. Visual and Vidigage Inspections

 

During the first portion of the "L" runs, 1 through 4, persistent
line plugging occurred. Presumably this was due to nickel contamination in
the feed salts plus corrosion losses which allowed the concentration of nickel
fluoride in the salt to exceed the solubility limit. After run L-4, the plant
was shut down and approx 200 lb of a high-melting salt complex was found in
the bottom of the Mark II fluorinator. See Fig. 14. Petrographic and x-ray
diffraction analyses showed the mass to contain 20-30 wt % NiF, and
50-60 wt % Nap-NiF,-2Z7F) . In order to continue using the vessel, the frozen
salt was chipped out with a pneumatic hammer.

Results of a visual inspection of the Mark II VPP fluorinator
after exposure to "E" and L-1 through IL-4 runs and cleanup operations are
cited:

Vessel walls Free of salt on the interior. Exterior surfaces were
covered with a dull gray film. Those portions of the
wall near the girth weld had scars on the interior sur-

faces presumably caused by glancing blows of the pneumatic-
hammer blade.

Exterior surfaces were bulged approx 1/16 in. in about six

Vidigage (ultrasonic thickness) measurements were made to assess the damages
during salt removal plus the wall-thickness losses that had occurred during
previous process cycling. A maximum wall-thickness loss of 68 mils was found
in the salt-containing region of the fluorinator. Complete results of the
Vidigage examination are shown in Table VII along with other data.

Despite the high-corrcsion losses indicated, a decision was made
to use the vessel for an additional five runs so as to complete the scheduled
process development studies. No plugging difficulties were encountered during
the subsequent "L" runs 5 through 9. This was accomplished by diluting the
feed salt with an equal amount of nickel-free barren salt.

Figure 15 shows the interior of the Mark II fluorinator after
run L-9. The results of a visual inspection after hand chipping and decon-
tamination were as follows:

Decontamination was done by alternate washings using a mixture of 0.7 M H,0,,
1.8 M KOH, and O.k M NaC) HO, at room temperature and 4 M (WF), ),C,0), at 100°C.
At that time Vidigage readings were obtained and are reported in Table VIT,
along with the previous readings obatined after Run L-4. No significant ad-
ditional wall-thickness losses were found.

The corrosion conditions established during the gas-entrainment
studies, Runs M-62 through M-6L4, which were done at a later date using the
Mark II fluorinator, were not felt to be sufficiently serious to warrant

another complete Vidigage inspection.
2. Chemistry

Samples of the dull gray film present on the exterior wall of
the Mark II fluorinator after Runs L-4 and 1-9 were analyzed by x-ray diffrac-
tion techniques to be Nio,. In addition, samples of the adherent. green
deposit which remained on the interior wall of the vessel in the vapor region
were submitted for x-ray diffraction analyses. The presence of NiF,, NiO, and
2x0, was noted.

Surface and subsurface millings were taken from the interior wall
of the vessel in the region where the green deposit seemed thickest, 15-17 in.
below the bottom of the slip-on flange, and submitted for additional chemical
analyses. For comparison purposes, subsurface millings were also taken from
the exterior vessel wall at the same elevation. The results of the metal
chemistry are shown in Fig. 16, and indicate an increase in chromium con-
centration in the millings near the surface of the interior wall of the ves-
sel. No significant increase in sulfur in the vapor region of the fluorinator
over. that quantity present in the base material was found. However, on
specimens removed from the salt region of the Mark IT fluorinator, which were
later analyzed by Battelle Memorial Institute (BMI), an increase in the sulfur
content of the interior wall specimens was noted. Figure 16 also shows these

results.

3. Dimensional Analysis

 

After decontamination and other cleanup operations, samples
were trepanned from the Mark IT fluorinator and sent to BMI for dimensional
analysis and metallographic examination. The location of these coupons is
displayed in Fig. 17. In addition, a full-length section from D-E area,
southeast quadrant, was removed and micrometer measurements taken at ORNL to
plot a complete corrosion profile of wall-thickness loss. This plot is shown
in Fig. 18 and incorporates BMI micrometer measurements on the trepanned
samples from the other quadrants of the fluorinator. For comparison, Vidi-
gage readings of the D-E area after runs L-U4 and 1-9 are also plotted in
Fig. 18. The maximum wall-thickness losses found were in the salt region
of Mark II fluorinator. In a region 40-43 in. below the bottom of the slip-
on flange of the vessel, a wall-thickness loss of 82 mils was recorded. Fair
correlation between the Vidigage readings and the micrometer measurements was

noted.

Lk, Metallographic Study

 

A metallographic study was made on the trepanned samples from the
Mark II fluorinator by personnel of the BMI Corrosion Research Division. Wt At
low magnification, 20X, the surfaces from the top vapor (T) sections showed a
light etch and some outline of grain boundaries. The middle vapor region
specimens (la and 1b) were etched to a greater extent and were covered with a
thin green crystalline deposit. Previous chemical analyses of this deposit
al, ORNL, indicated that the scale contained NiF,, NiO, and ZrQ,,. The vapor-
salt interface (2a and 2b) and salt region specimens (3a and 3b) seemed to
have been severely etched, and, in the latter, areas of intergranular attack
could be seen.

Typical photomicrographs of sections from the Mark IT fluorinator

can be seen in Figs. 19 through 23. Intergranular attack was prevalent in all

I'n the salt region of Area C, a few small intergranular cracks
were found on the interior of the vessel wall. A typical crack 1s shown in
the unetched condition in Fig. 26 and in the etched condition in Fig, 22.

Very pronounced darkening of the grain boundaries to approximately the same
depth as the crack was evident alter etching.

Cross sections from the fluorinator shell longitudinal weld are
shown in Fig. 27 (Samples B-T and A-3b) which depicts sections in the vapor
and salt phases, respectively. The weld joint from the salt region shows
what appears to be an increased attack at the weld root. This confirms the
visual examinations of the Mark IT fluorinator. Examination of the weld from
the salt section at high magnification revealed pronounced grain-boundary
darkening after etching to a maximum depth of 10 mils. Similar, deeper grain-
boundary darkening occurred in the base metal adjacent to the weld metal,
extending to a maximum depth of 33 mils.

The exterior of the vessel displayed a corrosive attack which
appeared to be intergranular in nature. Penetration varied from 1-6 mils, the
maximum occurring at or below the vapor-salt interface (Fig. 28, Sample A-3b).
However, there was one exception to this pattern. A grain-boundary penetration
of approx 12 mils in depth was found on the exterior surface opposite the

pitted region in the vapor near Area C.

5. Summary of Corrosive Attack

 

Table IX summarizes the corrosion losses of all types found in
the three major regions of the Mark II VPP L nickel fluorinator. The maximum
attack was calculated to be 60 mils/month based on exposure to molten salts
during the VPP "E" runs (1-6) and "L" runs (1-9) or 1.1 mils/hr based on
fluorine sparge time during fluorination of molten salts, The maximum attack

occurred in the salt region.

during VPP "EB" runs (1-6) and "L" runs (1-9). Maximum attack occurred in the
salt-phase region of this vessel whereas the first VPP Fluorinator experienced
maximum losses in the vapor-phase region. The rateg of attack for both vessels
were of the same orders of magnitude. The corrosive attack in the Mark IT
Tluorinator, as was the case for the Mark I vessel, can be categorized into
bulk metal losses from the interior wall of the vessel and intergranular at-

tack on both the interior and exterior walls of the unit.

1. Interior Bulk losses

 

Bulk metal losses are helieved to be the result of continuous loss
and reformation of "protective" NiF, films on the interior wall of the Mark IT
fluorinator. As discussed in Section I, the nickel fluoride films formed on
the walls of the volatility {luorinators during conditioning and fluorination
operations could be removed by three and possibly four wethods. These are:
removal (1) by rupturing or spalling, (2) by a fluxing action of the fluoride
salt baths, (3) by a washing action of the melts, and (4) by dissolution in
certain highly corrosive liquids condensable in the cooler regions of the
vessel,

Maximum losses occurred in the salt region of the Mark II vessel
which seems to indicate that the Tluxing action of the fluoride baths was the
predominant method of removing the protective films from the walls of the
fluorinator. The high vapor regions losses described for the first VPP
fluorinator were partially attributed to the presence of corrosive liquids
which condensed in the cooler regions of that vessel and some discussion of
whether similar liquids were present in the second vessel seems in order.

Evidence of the presence of these condensable liquids in the
middle vapor regions of both vessels were (1) the tenacious wall deposits,

(2) the segregation of chromium in surface and subsurface layers, and
(3) the bulk metal loss maxima, However, the bulk metal loss maximum in the
second vessel occurred a few inches below that of the initial fluorinator.

One major dissimilarity found was the lack of uranium segregation
in the vapor phase of the Mark II vessel which was in contrast to the behavior

of the first fluorinator. This latter fact may suggest the reason for the
- 68 -

lesser middle vapor region attack in the second fluorinator when compared with
the first vessel. Perhaps the additional operating experience of the VPP
personnel plus the modifications in the vessel's interior plumbing and ex-
terior appendages permitted UF), to remain in the salt baths until more or

less complete oxidation to volatile Ur, had occurred.

The wall-thickness-loss profile of the Mark [I fluorinator shows
an additional, smaller, maximum at a point 25 in. below the bottom of the
slip-on flange, This additional peak in the upper interface region is
believed to have been induced by low operational temperatures a few inches
below the 25-in. level. There was no direct method of heat at 28 in. below
the bottom of the slip-on flange. This region was between the furnace
windings used to heat the salt region and the rod-type heating elements used
tec heat the vapor region, In addition, the furnace seal was present at this
point, resulting in a built-in heat sink. Thus, the corrosion profile curve
probably would have continued in a smooth curve from the 25-in. elevation on
aown toward the salt region except for this low-temperature region cited. A
similar low-corrosion area wag found in the wall of the Mark I fluorinator
at approximately the same elevation.

The corrosion losses Tound in the salt region of the Mark II
Tfluorinator were the maximum found in the system and on the order of twice
that noted for the first fluorinator in the same region. Two reasons are
proposed for the higher salt-phase losses in the second fluorinator. First,
the fluoride salt baths in contact with the lower regions of the second
Tluorinator contained uranium for a period approx 67% longer than for the
first Tluorinator. As will be described in a later section, the presence of
uranium in fused fluoride salt systems during bench-scale volatility cor-
rosion studies has enhanced corrosive attack, Second, although the total
quantity of Tluorine sparged during Mark IT was only slightly higher than
thai used during operations with the Mark TI vessel, the total time of Tluori-
nation for the Mark TT vessel was approx 50% longer than for the first

fluorinator. Since in both cases an average of 3:1 excess fluorine over that
- 69 -

quantity necessary for theoretical reaction was used, {luorine probably had
opportunity to remain in the salt longer during Mark IT operations. This
would allow the corrodent a longer period of time to attack the Tluorinator
wall.

2. Interior Intergranular Penetration

 

Upon etching samples removed from the wall of the Mark IT fluori-
nator, the grain boundaries appear heavily darkened to various depths. In
the vapor region, a maximum depth of 8 mils penetration was noted. The vapor-
salt interface region showed a maximum of 16 mils while the salt region dis-
played penetration proceeding to a maximum depth of 33 mils.

Suspecting that the intergranular attack might he the result of
sulfur contamination, personnel alt BMI attempted two tests to make positive
identification of the grain-boundary deposits. The sulfur-print technique,
whereby acidified photographic paper is pressed against the metal surface,
was used. Sulfides could not be detected using this method. Next, the re-
action of a solution of lead nitrate and nitric acid upon constituents at
the grain boundaries was observed under the microscope. The precipitate
formed appeared to be similar to but weaker than that observed on a nickel
tube known to be grossly contaminated with sulfur. Battelle Memorial Institute
also indicated that the structures observed at the grain boundaries resemble
those found in I nickel rods tested and studied at ornL. 2

A section from the Mark IT fluorinator wall which had been ex-
posed to the salt phase was analyzed for sulfur content at several depths
by BM{ personnel, (Fig. 24). Twice the weight percent of sulfur was found
in the interior wall at an O to 5-mil depth as that found at the same depth
on the exterior wall, 240 vs 120 ppm. Sulfur analyses conducted at ORNL on
wall material removed from various depths in the middle vapor region of the
vessel (Fig. 16) did not disclose any increase in sulfur content on subsurface
interior samples when compared to subsurface exterior samples, 20 vs LO ppm.

Unfortunately, the poor correlation obtained on sulfur analyses
from BMI and ORNL on exterior wall samples plus the weak case for sulfur

- 70 -

contamination presented by other test methods dilutes any blanket statement
which could be made regarding the role that sulfur played in the interior
intergranular attack of the Mark II fluorinator. However, the serious
embrittling and potential corrosive effects of sulfur in contact with nickel
at high temperatures are definite and known facts. Therefore, sulfur con-
tamination should be stringently avoided in any of the VPP's nickel process

equipment.

3. Exterior Intergranular Attack

 

The exterior of the Mark IT fluorinator shell also underwent
intergranular attack. This was noted by BMI personnel in their examination
of samples removed from the vessel, The general depth of the attack, 1-6 mils,
was of the same order as that reported for the first VPP fluorination vessel.
In the analyses of scale from tne exterior wall of the Mark IT, NiO, was
found indicating that the exterior intergranular atlack on the second Cluori-
nator was due to air oxidation.

ht, Grain-Size Variations

 

Grain sizes found in samples removed from the wall of the Mark T
fluorinator varied from an average ASTM number of 5-6 to > 1. The large sizes
occurred exclusively in the vapor region of the vessel. The second VPP
Tluorinator showed a different grain-size pattern. Average ASTM grain-sive
numbers in this vessel varied from 3-5 to 2-lU, the largest occurring in the
salt region.

Althougn the second fluorinator was fabricated from the same
heat of L nickel and in a similar manner as the first vessel, initial thermal
conditions were quite different in the respective vapor regions, Initial
heatup for the Mark T was done without the benefit of an external heal source
in the vapor region while the Mark TT had rod-type heating elements with a
total rating of 9 kw attached to the upper half of the vessel. Heavy re-
Tractory insulation covered the rod-type clements,

From a classical metallurgical viewpoint, it appears that many

more nucleation sites were present in the vapor region of the second fluorinato
- 71 -

as the result of the initial rapid heatup and more or less incomplete
recovery when compared with the first vessel. The many sites affected the
production of many grains in constant volume which could only result in com-
paratively smaller grain sizes.

The somewhat larger grain sizes found in the salt region of the
Mark IT fluorinator when compared to the same region of the first vessel and
to the resulting grain sizes noted in the vapor region of the Mark TT seem
to be the result of some coalescence during operations. It will be recalled
that the first fluorinator was at 600-725°C for approx 1250 hr while the
second vessel was af about the same tewperature range for over 1900 hr.

The specific effect of grain size on corrosion in the fluori-
nation system has been reported in Section I as being conjectural. However,
maximum bulk losses on the walls of both fluorinators occurred at locations
where the largest grain sizes predominated. As such, the production and
stabilization of small grain sizes in nickel [luorination vessels seem a
reasonable precaution. Open annealing cycles for L nickel to ensure small

43

grain sizes have been reported.

£. Corrosion of Internal Components from the Mark TI VPP Fluorinator

 

Several internal components of the Mark IT fluorinator have been
examined and an evaluation of the corrosive attack on these parts made by per-

(ref Ub)

sonnel of the Corrosion Research Division, BMI. Figure 3 shows the
location of most of these components with respect to the top flange of the
fluorinator. Of particular interest are the draft tubes and fluorine inlet
tubes which, by virtue of their position in the system, were subjected to
initial contact by fluorine, and could be expected to sustain the greatest
corrosive attack. Two draft tubes, Mark ITA and Mark ITB, were used in the
Mark IT fluorinator during Phase I and Phase II of the fluorinator's lifetime,

(Teble VI). The draft tubes were fabricated at ORNL from A nickel. Results

cally displayed in Figs. 29 and 30 and show the configuration details of the
assemblies, Supporting photomicrographs are presented in Figs. 31 and 32.

Considerable metal loss was found on the Mark ITA draft tube, but
little visible intergranular attack was noted. Conversely, the Mark IIB
draft tube showed little dimensional change but a rather deep intergranular
attack. The etching characteristics and general microscopic appearance were
also quite different. While the Mark IIB tube etched normally for nickel
using a nitric-acetic acid mixture, the other draft tube did not, and it was
necessary for BMI personnel to use an HC1-HNO (3:1) etch, which they commonly
use for Inconel to develop grain-boundary detail. However, spectrographic
analysis at BMI showed the Mark ITB draft tube construction material to be A
nickel. HH

The maximum bulk metal loss on the Mark ITA draft tube by micrometer
average measurement was 77 mils and occurred near the upper support plate of
the assembly. Comparison of the measured outside diameter of the tube with
the original diameter indicated that most of the metal loss occurred on the
outer surfaces of the unit. Micrometer weasurements on the Mark IIB draft
tube showed maximum bulk losses of only © mils but a maximum total inter-
gramilar penetration on both the interior and exterior wall of 29 mils. The
fluorine inlet lines associated with the Mark TIB draft tube assembly showed
similar corrosive behavior when compared to the draft tube bodies. However,
the Mark IIA fluorine inlet line showed a much more severe intergranular at-
tack on the inside of the pipe when compared with the outside.

A high-probe line and a thermocouple well, both made from 3/8-in.
sched-~-40 A nickel, were inspected also by BMI personnel for corrosive attack.
Both components operated at temperatures essentially the same as those of the
fluorinator wall. The high-probe line was a high-pressure liquid level and
density~-probe combination which extended From the top flange of the fluori-
nator beneath the molten salt level. The line was open at the bottom to
allow contact with the fused fluoride salt baths, but pressurized nitrogen,

inside the tube, for the most part prevented the salts from entering the tube.

The thermocouple well wes positioned in a similar manner to that described
for the probe line but the end was sealed with an A nickel plug. Table X
cites the corrosive losses found on the high-probe line and thermowell as
well as giving more detail on the losses found in the fluorine inlet lines,

The internal components from the Mark IT VPP fluorinator sustained
total corrosion losses comparable to the walls of the fluorination vessel.
lo increased attack was noted on the fluorine inlet lines or on the draft
tube bodies as the result of the proximity to elemental fluorine during
operations.

Of interest is the indication of much more corrosive conditions
present during the L-1 through L-4 runs when compared to B-3 through BE-6 or
L-5 through L-9 runs. Extended times of service at high temperatures for
the early "L" runs may explain these differences. Corrosion control speci-
mens of L nickel in place during the run groups mentioned, and reported in
Section IV, corroborate the variable corrosive behavior present during these

different operation groups.

ITT. Bench-Scale Fluorination Corrosion Studies

 

The Volatility Studies Group, Chemical Development Section A of the
Chemical Technology Division, has continued to study process chemistry in
connection with the volatility process since their early work indicated the
latter's feasibility. These studies have included the gathering of corrosion
data from small-scale experiments.

As stated in Section I, nickel-base alloys have shown superior cor-
rosion resistance to fused fluoride salts under dynamic flow conditions,
and nickel and nickel-base alloys exhibit generally good resistance to ele-
mental Tluorine and UF. In this connection, commercial purity nickel and
Inconel have been the primary materials of construction for facilities using
the individual corrodents mentioned above, Extensive studies at ORNL on
Inconel in contact with fused fluoride salts have shown that appreciable

quantities of chromium were removed through reaction with UF), and other

oxidizing impurities. The chromium removal was accompanied by the forma-
tion of subsurface voids in the metal. Substitutions of molybdenum in an
approximate ratio of 2:1 (Mo: Cr) for about half of the chromium content in a
typical chromium-containing alloy, plus other modifications, provide an alloy,
TNOR 8, which has exhibited no measurable attack when in contact with molten
fluoride salts at temperatures up to approx 700°C. Also, INOR 8 has been used
as the material of coustruction for the VPP Dissolver-Hydrofluorinator, the
major vessel for the head-end cycle of the Volatility Program.

For these reasons, a 2-in.-diam Inconel fluorinator, ten l-in.-diam

A nickel fluorinators, and four l-in.-diam INOR 8 fluorinators were tested

and subsequently examined for comparative corrosion behavior.
A. Inconel Fluorinator
1. Test Method

The Tnconel fluorinator was used in hot-cell studies and was
fabricated from 0.065-1in. stock at ORNL. Prior to the exposure detailed in

Table XI, fluorine flowed into the fluorinator as it was raised from ambient

room temperature to operating temperature. This was done Tor leak-testing
purposes although, at the same time, the interior vessel walls were probably
"conditioned" by producing films of fluorides. The total time involved for
this testing-conditioning treatment was about 2 hr.

After exposure operations, areas from the vessel were selected for
micrometer measurements and metallographic examination. Figure 33 shows a
cross section of the vessel and the location of the sample areas removed for
study. A summery of corrosive attack found is shown in Table XII where total
losses are reported in mils per hour, based on fluorine sparge time, and mils
per month, based on residence time in molten salts. Representative photo-

micrographs are grouped in Fig. 3h.

2. Discussion of Results

 

Maximum corrosive attack in the Inconel Tluorinator was encoun-
tered at the vapor-sall interface and occurred at a rate of 0.2k mils/hr, based
on fluorine sparge time, or U8 mils /month, based on molten-salt residence time.
Intergranular penetration seemed the predominant mode of attack in the salt
and vapor regions but no evidence of intergranular corrosion was found at the
vapor-salt interface.

In this connection, the intergranular penetration seemed dis-
similar to that found on the interior walls of the VPP Tluorinstors. That is,
on the Inconel vessel there was evidence of the sloughing of whole grains of
material, a condition not observed on the full-size L nickel vessels. The
depth of the intergranular penetration on the Inconel vessel was only a single
grain deep. The VPP fluorinators demonstrated intergranmilar modifications
many grains in depth on samples removed from corresponding service regions con-
taining similar grain-size materisl.

In the Tnconel bench fluorinator, it appears that after inter~
granular penetration had proceeded to about one grain in depth, many of the
affected grains could not be retained in position by the remainder of the
grain-boundary material and sloughed off, leaving new material ready for cor-

rosive attack. This method of metal loss would seem devastating to the vessel

in service, but the anomaly of the situation is that maximum wall-thickness
losses occurred in the Inconel vessel at the vapor-salt interface and at that
point no evidence of intergranular attack could be found.

No explanation can be given for the interior wall interface
anomaly described nor can one be given for the heavy exterior intergranular
attack which has localized in a cooler region of this Inconel fluorinator

(see Fig. 34).

B. A Nickel Fluorinators

 

1. Test Method

In addition to the Inconel fluorinator reported upon in
Section ITTA, ten A nickel miniature fluorination vessels, each 1-in.-o0.d.
and 0.035-in.-wall thickness, have been operated by the Volatility Studies
Group, Chemical Development Section A, in order to compare fluorinator cor-
rosion using different process Tlowsheets. Figure 35 shows the units in test
position, while Table XIII is a summary of the imposed test conditions.

The vessels, in all cases, were charged with 75 g of fluoride
salt that had been ground and classified to -8 +20 mesh. The vessels were
then placed in split tube-~type furnaces and brought to the specified tempera-
ture under a nitrogen purge of 0.05 liters/min. At temperature, the nitrogen
was bypassed and fluorine was allowed to bubble through the salt at the same
flow rate. In those cases where uranium was added to the melt, 0.50 g
increments of UF), were added at intervals of 1 hr or more. As shown, some
reactors were placed in series both for convenience and to minimize the
fluorine consumption. The total elemental fluorine exposure in each case was
50 hr at a rate of 0.05 liters/min. During these 50-hr exposures on test re-
actors Nos. 5, 6, and 10, twenty-five ur), additions and UF, volatilizations
were made.

In all tests, the salts were kept molten for over 200 hr while
under a nitrogen purge. This was done to facilitate the test procedure, that
is, avoid remelting salts for the next fluorine test period. Figures 36 and 37

illustrate the corrosion results obtained by micrometer measurements and

are reported both in mils per hour of fluorine sparge and mils per month based
on total residence time in molten salts for comparison with other studies.
Figures 38 through 42 show representative photomicrographs from this test

series.

2. Discussion of Results

 

The A nickel fluorinators showed widely varying corrosion rates
as anticipated in planning this test series.

Comparison of the results on test vessel No. 6 with those of
vessel No. 3 indicated that uranium additions to equimolar Naf-ZrF) resulted
in increased corrosion occurring as intergranular attack at the vapor-salt
interface. A rate of 0.1 mils/hr based on fluorine sparge time was noted at
the interface of No. 6.

Comparison of vessel No. 2 with vessel No. 3 indicated that the
addition of 26 mole % of LiF caused increased attack at the vapor-salt inter-
face, as evidenced by bulk metal losses. Upon metallographic examination, no
evidence of intergranular attack was found in either vessel.

The addition of uranium to the LiF-NaF-ZrF) (26-37-37 mole %)
salt in vessel No. 5 resulted in significantly increased metal losses plus
intergranular attack at the vapor-salt interface. Additional intergranular
attack was noted in the vapor phase of this vessel.

Lowering the temperature of the reactor containing the same
LiF-bearing salt, LiF-NaF-Z1F) (26-37-37 mole %), to 525°C produced erratic
corrosion results. Two of the vessels, Nos. 4 and 7, showed uniform, compara-
tively small metal losses in all regions while vessel No. 8 showed an increased
attack, especially at the vapor-salt interface, Intergranular attack was also
exhibited by vessel No. 8. As shown in Table XIII, vessel No. 8 was in a down-
stream position from vessels Nos. 4 and 7, and the deviation in behavior may,
therefore, have been the result of carry-over and cecllection of certain con-

stituents conducive to greater corrosive attack.

Lovering the process temperature to 450°C and utilizing the same
lithium-bearing salt (No. 2) reduced corrosive attack to the lowest levels
found in this test series. These results were provided by vessel No. 1 where
the approximate losses were 0.02 mil/hr, based on fluorine sparge time. This
is especially significant since lithium-sodium-zirconium fluoride salt mix-
tures can be used in the volatility process at lower operating temperatures
than the Naf-ZrF) composite system because of the lower liquidus line of the
lithium-bearing system.

Tests Nes. 10 and 9 at 525°C used higher LiF- and ZrF), -content
salts, 31-24-45 mole % LiF-NaF-ZrF) , with and without uranium, respectively.
Vessel No. 9 showed slightly increased attack over vessels Nos. 4 and 7 which
were operated at the same temperature. Metallographic examination of
vesgel No. 10 revealed that intergranular penetration was present in all
phages of the interior wall.

The A nickel miniature fluorinators demonstrated generally lower
rates of corrosive attack in simulated fluorination environments when compared
to the full-sized L nickel vessels or the latter's A nickel internal components
which were exposed to pilot plant fluorination condltions. The following three
reasons can probably account for most of this deviation: (1) the temperatures
of fluorination generally were somewhat lower in the bench-scale work than
during pilot plant operations; (2) somewhat better control over thermal cycling
and other process conditions was obtained during bench-scale work; (3) the
feed salts used in the pilot plant work were contaminated by having been used
in previous loop studies, the ARE, or having been contained for long periods
of time in the pilot plant type 347 stainless steel charge melt tank.

The A nickel miniatures also demonstrated greater resistance to
corrosive attack during fluorination than the Inconel vesgsel used in Chemical

Development hot-cell studies.
¢. INOR-8 Fluorinators
1. Test Method

Four INOR-8 test fluorination vessels, each l-in.-o.d. and

0.065~in.-wall thickness, and of similar design to the A nickel reactors
~ 06 -

reported in Section IIIB were also fabricated at ORNL Tor bench-scale
volatility corrosion studies. The composition of INOR-8 used in test fluori-
nators was Th.5 wt % Ni-15.3 wt % Mo—6.5 wt % Cr—3.7 wt % Fe-0.02 wt % C.

A summary of the test conditions for the INOR-8 miniature (luori-

nators, as shown in Table XIV, indicates that only vessel No. 3 contained

ported. [Figures 43 and ki illustrate the corrosion losses cbtained by microm-
eter measurements and metallographic examinations on specimens removed fron
the walls of the vessel. The losses have been converted to mils lost per
unit time for comparison purposes. Figures 45 through 48 show typical etched

microstructures found in the INOR-8 fluorinator specimens.

2. Discussion of Results

 

The INOR~8 test Lfluorinators showed a variety of corrosion mani-
festations depending on the test conditions. Considering the two vessels which
operated at 600°C, vessel Wo. 2, which contained equimolar NaF-ZrF) , showed.

less attack than vessel No. 4, which contained LiF-NaF-7rF, (26-37-37 mole %).

Maximum attack in the latter vessel occurred at the vapor-salt interface at
a rate of 30 mils/month, based on residence time in the molten salts. This
was the maximum attack rate Tor the entire INOR-8 series.

Reducing the operating temperature to 450°C and using the same
lithium~bearing salt significantly reduced attack as indicated for vessel No. 1
(Figs. 43 and 44). The maximum attack found in this vessel was also at the
vapor-salt interface at a rate of 5 mils/month. The addition of uranium to
the lithium-bearing salt described plus operation at U50°C more than doubled
the corrosive attack when compared to the nonuranium~containing salt. This
occurred in vessel No. 3.

Examination of the metallographic specimens in the as-polished
state, Fig. 49, disclosed spongy layers on the surfaces of the vapor region
specimens from vessels Nos. 2 and 4. These two vessels operated at the highest
temperatures of the test series, Upon etching with a modified agua regia

solution, 5:1, HCI1:HNO the spongy regions were for the most part destroyed.

2
Figures 46 and 49 display the microstructures for specimens from the two ves-
sels and show that in only one region, the upper vapor area of vessel No. 2
(Fig. 46) did significant emounts of the spongy region remain.

Careful repolishing on the upper vapor area sample from vessel
No. 2 and examination of the surface disclosed a corrosion product which re-
solved itself into two distinct layers, as shown in Fig. 50. Just above the
INOR-8 base metal was a spongy region which was composed of voids and solid
metal intermixed, Many of the voids appeared to be partially filled with
nonmetallic-appearing compounds. Above the spongy region, on the outermost
surface of the specimen, was an irregular layer that had the angular appear-
ance of metal crystals,

Upon etching the specimen with a mixture of 10% KCN and
10% (NH),),,8,005 1:1 ratio in water, the outermost layer of the surface showed
different characteristics than the INOR-8 base metal. The comparatively mild
etchant delineated grain boundaries in the outer layer but left the base metal

unaffected, as displayed in Fig. 51.

Samples of the outer corrosion product layer and of the spongy
subsurface region were obtained by mechanical milling and scrapping. Most
of the material cecmprising the outer layer was found to be strongly ferro-
magnetic in contrast to the base metal, These samples plus milliags removed
from the exterior diameter of the No. 2 vessel wall, 5-10 mils below the
surface, were submitted for spectrochemical analyses. All of the samples
were quantitatively analyzed Tor Cr, Mo, Fe, and Ni by emission spectroscopy
using a porous cup electrode method of sample excitation. The results are

shown in Table XV.

Spongy subsurface layer 7.6 3.8 16.3 69.4
Base metal 6.6 3.75 15.45 75.45

Examination of Table XV shows that the outer corrosion product
layer was 13 wt % richer in nickel when compared to the base metal, INOR-8,
while the chromium, molybdenum, and iron contents in the corrosion product
decreased 140, 45, and 11 wt %, respectively. The spongy subsurface layer
showed generally small welght percent increases for the chromium, molybdenum,
and iron, respectively, when compared to the base metal analysis, Nickel in
the subsurface layer was approx 8 wt % less than that found in the base metal,

The mode of corrosive attack on INOR-8 in contact with the
simulated volatility process fluorimation enviromment at 600°C appears to
involve selective losses of chromiuwm, molybdenum, and iron from the nickel
solid solution. This may occur by formation of metal fluorides on the bulk
metal surface which subsequently volatilize, or by the various methods of

fluoride film losses described in Section I.
- 108 -

The reason(s) for the slightly higher minor element concentra-
tions in the spongy subsurface corrosion layer when compared with the base
metal appear(s) anomalous to normal diffusion processes. Concentration
gradients produced by the initial selective losses should become the driving
Torce for diffusion of the minor alloy elements toward the exposed surface
of the reactor and lower than base metal concentrations of chromium,
molybdenum, and iron would be expected in the subsurface region, It may be
that complex fluoride compounds are formed in the subsurface region which do
not volatilize under the test conditions and thus simply tie up higher con-
centrations of chromium, molybdenum, and iron. However, since x-ray
diffraction patterns on samples from the sublayer disclosed only the presence
of a face~centered cublc material very similar to the pattern obtained on
the base metal, supporting evidence for this theory has not been obtained.

Detailed treatment of the corrosive attack on INOR-8 deserves
separate study which may or may not be warranted considering the ultimate
goal of the entire test series covered in this section; that is, comparative
behavior of A nickel, Inconel, and INOR-8 in contact with a volatility process
fluorination environment. In regard to the latter, A nickel had the best
resistance to attack at pilot plant fluorination temperatures of 600°C; but
at 150°C INOR-8 presented favorable competition to the nickel. There are
several advantages attendant fo using INOR-8 as a fluorinator construction
material including its high strength and oxidation resistance. Also, since
the construction material for the VPP hydrofluorinator is TNOR-8, it might be
possible to consolidate both hydrofluorination and fluorination operations in

a single vessel.

IV. Volatility Pilot Plant Scouting Corrosion Tests

 

A, Material Selection

In order to take advantage of the service conditions provided by the
VPP process runs and to achieve insight into the resistance of other materials
to the complex fluorination environment, a series of corrosion specimens was

located in the Mark I and Mark II fluorinators and examined at convenient
- 109 -

intervals. As mentioned in Section I, resistance to further attack by
fluorine on metals was felt to be imparted by passive fluoride films which
form on the metal. Protection has been shown to be dependent on the proper-
ties of the fluoride films, especially volatility, adherence to the substrate
metal, mechanical and thermal stability, and thickness.

For the scouting corrosion tests described in this section, selec-
tion of materials which contained constituents known to form low volatile
fluorides seemed especially appropriate. As a guide to volatility, the
melting and boiling points of the common ingredients in many commercial
materials of construction were reviewed. A partial listing taken from Brewer?
is shown in Table XVI. It can be seen that chromium and molybdenum, commonly
added for improved resistance to air oxidation and/or improvement of high-
temperature properties, form highly volatile fluorides, especially at their
higher oxidation states. Nevertheless, because of the previous use of nickel-
base alloys containing chromium (Inconel) and/or molybdenum (TNOR-8) in
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE) and the Molten-Salt Reactor (MSR) studies,
alloys containing these two constituents were included in the materials selected
for the scouting tests.

Table XVII lists the specimen materials, their trade names, where
applicable, and the general alloy classifications to which they belong. Most
of the materials were nickel-rich alloys. The 90 wt % Ni~10 wt % Co and
80 wt % Ni—20 wt % Co alloys were nonproprietary and were fabricated from
melts made in Metallurgy Division Tacilities. The remaining materials were
obtained from commercial suppliers. The platinum specimen served as an elec-
trode probe in an attempt by VPP operating personnel to investigate the
electrochemical effects during the fluorination process. However, current
did not flow through the probe and corrosive losses were recorded in a regu-
lar manner for the platinum specimen. Table XVIII shows the nominal composi~

tions for all scouting test materials.

B. Test Method

The scouting specimens consisted of lengths of rod, sheet, or split
pipe stock, or combinations thereof, each approx 48-56 in. long. They were
held in place in the fluorination vessels by two methods. During the Mark I
Tluorinator's operations, all specimens were welded to the top blind flange of
the vessel as shown in Fig. 3. When the Mark IT vessel was in use several
specimens were welded to the inspection port flange in a similar manner while
the remaining test rods were held in place by metal connectors gripping a fit-
ting prewelded to the end of the test rod. The end fittings were A nickel
tubing 1/2-in.-o0.d. Xx approx 3 in. long and seal welded to prevent the escape
of process gases, Figure 52 shows a cut-away view of the Mark II VPP fluorina-
tor illustrating the placement of corrosion specimens and a typical test
specimen prepared for insertion.

A total of 31 test specimens was exposed to the fluorination environ-
ments. In each test grouping at least one L nickel specimen was included as a
control, Figure 53 shows a top view of the fluorinators indicating the placement
off the specimens in terms of polar geometry, the testing order and identification
number, and corrosion specimen numbers. The corrosion specimen number Identifies
particular fluorinator runs when specimens were in place and also indicates the
total number of specimens tested simultaneously. The major test groupings were
fluorination runs M-21 through M-48, C-9 through C-15, E-3 through E-6,
IL-1 through IL-l, and I~5 through 1-9. Figure 5k details the process cycling
for each run group. Tables I and VI summarize the other process details during

these scouting runs.

C. Reactions to Environments

 

After exposure, the test specimens were removed from the fluorination
vessels and subjected to dimensional analyses and metallographic study,
Figures 55 and 56 summarize the maximum corrosive losses found in each major
exposure region as determined by micrometer measurements and optical microscopy.
Figure 55 details the loss data as a plot of mils per month, based on individ-

nal molten-salt residence times, while Fig. 56 shows the loss data in terms of

mils per hour, based on operational fluorine sparge time. In both figures
dotted and cross hatched bars represent bulk metal losses and visible inter-
granular attack, respectively, while solid bars indicate a total loss of the
specimen occurred at the point indicated,

Several specimens registered lower rates of maximum corrosive attack
than the L nickel control rods. These specimens included Hymu 80, INOR-2,
INOR-8, Hastelloy W, Hastelloy X, Waspalloy, and the 90 wt % Ni—10 wt % Co
alloys. In particular, Hymu 80 was superior to all test specimens in all runs,
although the specimen registered a maximum bulk loss rate of 11 mils/month,
based on molten-salt residence time, at the vapor-salt interface. Total loss
of corrosion specimens, indicating corrosion rates of > 105 mils/month based
on molten-salt time, was found for one L nickel specimen, one INCO-61 weld
wire specimen, and for the Hastelloy B, Nimonic 80, Inconel, Monel, copper, and
platinum specimens.

Selected photomacrographs and photomicrographs of samples from many
of these corrosion specimens are presented in Appendix A. In most cases, the

areas of maximum attack are shown.

D. Discussion of Results

 

A wide variation in resistance to the fluorination environment was
found on corrosion specimens used in the compatibility testing described. The
variations in corrosion noted were anticipated because of the widely divergent
process conditions. Because the VPP has essentially been operated for feasi-
bility studies, demonstration runs, and runs designed to recover uranium from
available Tluoride salt mixtures, the determination of optimum process condi-
tions rather than the gathering of corrosion data has been the prevailing
philosophy.

In many groups of runs a wide variely of scouting materials was
used which were in proximity. This was recognized as being far from ideal for
corrosion testing, but little choice was available under the circumstances.

However, Run Group M-21-h48 did contain only the reference material, L nickel,
- 120 -

and the results were almost as divergent as the data obtained in run groups
where as many as seven different materials were present in the same system.

The L nickel reference specimen's mean rate of corrosive attack was
similar to that found on the walls of the corresponding pilot plant fluori-
nators, although large deviations from the mean existed. While maximum
corrosive attack occurred in the vapor region on the Mark I fluorinator and
in the salt region of the Mark II vessel, in almost all cases the L nickel
specimens showed maximum attack at the point of vapor-salt interface contact.
A notable exception was specimen M-21-48:4, tested in the Mark I fluorinator,
which exhibited failure in the upper vapor region. The addition of chromium
fluoride during the M-21-M-48 Run Group may have produced the vapor region
failure through mechanisms proposed in Section T.

The increased attack on the IL nickel specimens at the vapor-salt
interface possibly resulted from salt agitation at the center of the vessel
induced by the fluorine and nitrogen sparging through the draft tube. This
agitation could result in increased erosion and vibration of the specimens
with resultant loss of protective films. In addition, the location may have
allowed primary contact of the specimens with the fluorine sparge before the
latter reached the vessel walls. However, the increased corrosion to be ex-
pected from this effect was not noted on the A nickel fluorine inlet tubes,
the draft tube walls, or other fluorinator internal components discussed in
Section IT.

Tests on INCO-61l weld wire were intended to provide data on a nickel-
rich alloy with additions not readily available in commercial alloys. Besides
nickel, this material contains small amounts of Al, Ti, Pe, Mn, 8i, and Cu
(Table XVIII). Since this material was used in fabricating the fluorinators,
these tests provided an indication of weld metal behavior, although the weld
metal after deposition would have a cast structure compared to the wrought
structure of the weld wire. ‘The INCO-6l specimens showed generally analogous
bulk metal loss behavior when compared to the L nickel specimens, However, no

intergranular attack was found in the INCO-61 specimens.
~ 121 -

The behavior of the gold-plated L nickel corrosion specimens indicated
that no protection was provided by the plating. Comparison with L nickel speci-
men number L-1-I-4:6 in Fig. 55 shows comparable losses.

On the basis of single exposures of the 90% Ni—-10% Co and 80% Ni—20% Co
specimens, cobalt additions seemed to improve the resistance of commercial
nickel to the fluorination environment with the one exception of the high vapor-
salt interface attack found in the 80% Ni-20% Co specimen. The cobanic alloy,
containing 45% Co, was tested only in the fluorination vapor phase and showed
greater losses when compared with L nickel. Thus, further investigation of
nickel-base alloys with less than 20% Co seems warranted. Because the most
corrosion-resistant Ni-Co alloys are experimental, the Investigation should
ultimately include the determination of mechanical and physical properties and
fabricability.

The nickel-rich copper specimen, Monel, provided poor resistance to
the fluorination environment during a single test run. The specimen failed
completely at the vapor-salt interface,

The D nickel, containing about 5% Mn, and developed for improved
resistance to sulfur attack in oxidizing atmospheres at elevated temperatures,
presented somewhat higher loss rates than the L nickel specimen simultaneously
exposed, The D nickel specimen presented a different geometry to the corrodents,
sheet vs rod, but that difference is not believed to have been significant in
producing the higher rates of attack.

As expected, the Nimonic 80 alloy, containing 20% Cr and approx
2.5% Ti, exhibited substantially greater bulk losses than the corresponding
L nickel specimen. Reference to Table XVI shows that chromium and titanium
can form highly volatile fluorides at their higher valence states.

A high-temperature, oxidization-resistant, nickel-chromium-iron alloy,
Inconel, has been mentioned as being useful in contact with fused fluoride salts.
During the single test in the fluorination environment, the specimen completely
failed at the vapor-salt interface, and also exhibited a rather high vapor-phase

attack.
- 122 -

The Ni-Co-Cr alloys, Waspalloy and INCO 700, differed significantly
in attack. Samples of INCO 700 were available only for a salti~phase test
(L-1-L-4:4) and in this region had a bulk loss rate > 100 mils/month which
considerably exceeded the IL nickel specimen exposed simultaneously. The
Wagpalloy specimen showed a rate of attack slightly less than that of a cor-
responding I. nickel specimen. Further investigation of Waspalloy seems war-
ranted, although it should be remembered that the alloy ages at 750°C, a
temperature only slightly higher than the fluorinator operating range. Thus,
temperature excursions, which may be encountered in extended operations, might
drastically reduce the ductility of the material.

The Hymu-80 specimen, Ni-Fe-Mo, presented the best resistance to
corrosion of any of the specimens tested including the IL nickel reference
material, This alloy is commercially available and six miniature fluorinators
have been fabricated for compatibility testing with Naf-4rF), and Li¥-NaF-2r¥)
salt mixtures by the Volatility Studies Group of Chemical Development Section A,

The essentially Ni-Mo-Fe alloys, Hastelloy B and W, again showed the
variant behavior characteristic of this test series. The Hastelloy~B specimen
had extremely poor resistance and Tailed completely 22 in. above the static salt
level. ©Since the specimen was exposed during the Mark IT operation, the high
vapor-phase attack evidenced at that time may well have influenced the behavior
of Hastelloy B. The Hastelloy-W specimen, in place during a relatively low
corrosion run series, L-5-1~9, exhibited slightly lower losses when compared
with the IL nickel control specimen, This was because of the intergranular
attack experienced by the I. nickel.

One of the early manifestations of the Ni-Mo alloy series developed
at ORNL for fused-fluoride salt use was INOR 2. The single INOR~-2 specimen
tested had corrosion resistance superior to either of the L nickel specimens
exposed concurrently. Lack of additional material has hindered further corrosion
testing.

The Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe alloys tested, INOR 8 and Hastelloy X, had corrosion
resistance comparable to that of the L nickel rods exposed simultaneously. As
described in Section III, miniature fluorinators were fabricated from INOR 8

and tested. These tests did nol indicate any superiority over commercial nickel.
- 123 -

A single copper specimen, L-3-L-6:7, was exposed Lo the Mark IT
environment. The specimen failed completely in the middle vapor region. Cu-
pric fluoride was considered most likely to form under the excess fluorine
conditions present during testing. Although Cur, has a melting point of
approx 950°C and should have afforded protection to the parent metal, copper's
lack of resistance to oxidizing environments al fluorination temperatures may
explain its poor performance.

The platinum specimen was completely severed by corrosive attack in
the upper vapor region. This wire was intended to serve as an electrode probe,
out never carried current. The reason for the extreme rate of attack on
platinum seems to be the instability of PF which has been reported to de-
compose at 280°C (Table XVI).

Whereas the L nickel specimens exhibited intergranular attack, very

4

ew instances of this wmode of attack were noted on the other specimens tested,

Sections T and IT describe the mechanisms presumably operating on IL nickel.
E. Future Studies

The corrosion rates for all scouting materials tested to date appear
to be excessive Tor long-time use. Therefore, additional fluorination scouting
corrosion tests of the type described have been planned. Particular emphasis
was been placed on binary nickel-rich alloys containing various amounts of
Fe, Co, Mn, Mg, and Al. The latter two elements have not been considered in
previous experiments because of the fabrication, age hardening, or other
difficulties characteristic when alloyed in appreciable quantities with nickel.
Only a few nickel-base commercial alloys containing magnesium and aluminum in
combination with other ingredients nave been available and still fewer have
been commercial as Ni~Mg or Ni-Al binaries. Yet, aluminum and magnesium are
known to form fluorides at thelr highest valence states, which have higher
melting points than NiF,.

To date, Fe, Co, Mn, Mg, and Al in the quantities shown in Table XIX
have been added to induction melts of nickel and cast into l-in. rounds. After

suitable homogenization treatments of the castings, the rounds were cold swaged

to 1/k-in.-diam rods and hydrogen annealed. The rods have been cut to proper
lengths, end fittings attached by seal welding, and are presently awaiting
placement in a VPP Tluorinator.

In addition, high-purity vacuum-melted nickel has been obtained and
fabricated into the proper test specimen shape for examining the resistance

of that material to the fluorination environment.

V. Argonne National Laboratory Fluorination Corrosion Studies

 

The Chemical Engineering Division of Argonne National Laboratory has
done extensive work on nonayueous processing of irradiated fuels. A portion
of their effort has been on studies of fluoride volatility processes. A re-
view of one of the Argonne National Laboratory studies on materials compati-
bility in a simulated fluorination environment is included here Tor comparison

with ORNL data.
A. Test Method

Fluorination corrosion tests were conducted on coupons of L nickel,
D nickel, Hastelloy B, and INOR p, (ref 18) The coupons were contained in a
vessel which had an inner liner and internal piping fabricated from A nickel.
The coupons, each & in. long x 0.5 in. wide x 0.032 in. thick, were wired to-
gether to form a gimulated draft tube of square cross section. The composition
of the wire was not indicated. The nominal composition of the first three
waterials listed above has been given in Table XIX. Another of the early ex-
perimental alloys, INOR 1, studied in the development of INCOR 8, had a nominal
composition of 78 wt % Ni-20 wt % Mo—0.5 wt % Mn-0.5 wt % Si—0.25 wt $ Fe—
0.01 wt % C.

The simulated draft tube was partially immersed in a bath of equi-

bottom of the coupons. The bath was held at 600°C while fluorine or helium
was introduced centrally beneath the melt surfaces at rates of approx O.1
standard liters/min. During this test series, the fluoride salts were kept
molten for a total of 216 hr and for 63 hr of that time fluorine was sparged
into the bath. The process gases were introduced on a cyclic basis, i.e.,
for 7 hr/day fluorine wag sparged while helium was sparged for the remaining
17 hr of a day.

Figures 57 and 58 illustrate the corrosion losses obtained during
this test series. Figure 57 is a bar graph where bulk metal losses as
determined by micrometer measurement and additional losses as determined by
metallographic examination have been converted to mils/month of molten-salt
residence time. Figure 58 is a similar graph plotted as mils/hour of fluorine
sparge time. Rates have been plotted instead of original data for comparison

with ORNL data.

B. Discussion of Results

 

The corrosion losses in this Argonne National Laboratory test series
suggest that TNOR 1 was the most resistant to the test environment, while the
I. nickel reference material fared poorly. This is attributed to the extensive
intergranular attack on the latter material, particularly at the vapor-salt
interface.

Comparison of the Argonne National Laboratory corrosion results with
those obtained at ORNL is difficult because of differences in test procedures
which include fluorine flow rates, specimen location and geometry, and salt
compositions. However, Argonne's results on L nickel fit the corrosion
limits determined for the ORNL scouting corrosion reference specimens in the
salt and at the salt-vapor interfaces. Vapor-phase specimens are not readily
comparable, since Argonne specimens were only 3 to 4 in. above the salt
surface.

The Argonne National Laboratory Hastelloy B and the D nickel specimens
generally had less attack than scouting specimens at ORNL. The differences may
be attributed to more severe operating conditions in the CORNL pilot plant
fluorinator. Since no INOR-1 specimen had been tested at ORNL, no comparisons

could be derived,

Close cooperation has been maintained with the Argonne National
Laboratory on the selection and testing of candidate materials of construction
for use in the fluoride volatility process. In addition to materials research
as a means of containing the fluorination environment, Argonne National
Laboratory has suggested three other approaches. These have been the use of
(1) cold wall fluorination vessel, (2) a spray tower fluorination, and

hg

(3) lower melting salts. © Further work on these approaches has been covered

in the Argonne National Laboratory Chemical Engineering Division Summary Reports.

VI. Supplementary Volatility Pilot Plant Equipment

 

The operation of the VPP necessarily included the use of a number of
auxiliary components such as traps for radioactive products, absorbers, valves,
fittings, fluorine disposal systems, and piping. Each of these are subject to
various corrosive conditions including fluorine, uranium hexafluoride, fused
fluoride salts, etc. Thus, successful operation of the volatility process
requires that materials be selecled appropriate for the particular conditions
of service. Construction of the present system was predicated on the knowledge
available at the time and as cperating experience has been gained these parts
have been examined to verily the original assumptions. In most cases the metal
selected appears to give satisfactory service and failure analyses have sug-
gested alternate metals in the case of those which proved unsuitable. The

etails of the findings of this investigation are presented in Appendix B.

Supplementary Volatility Pilot Plant Equipment

 

Sections I and II have described reactions to the process environment of
VPP I, nickel fluorination vessels. Other important components used in the
fluorination cycle of the fluoride volatility process have been examined for
corrosion resistance to their local environments. The components include a
CRP trap, a waste-salt line, the absorber vessels, valves and fittings, com-
ponents in the fluorine disposal system, and selected sections from the
piocess gas lines. Figure 79 illustrates the relative positions of these

components in the pilot plant.

Complexible Radioactive Products Trap

 

To date, two CRP traps have been utilized in the VPP. The trap examined
was the second used and was in service during the Mark II fluorinator's life-
time, as has been described previously in Section TIA. This vessel was
fabricated from a 5-in. sched-U0 Inconel pipe, 31 in. long and it contained
NaF pellets to scrub the fluorinator effluent gas. The trap was designed to
remove ZrF), and Cry and provides a certain amount of radioactive decontami-
nation, Table XX summarizes the exposure conditions for the trap. A couplete
description of the performance of the CRP trap has been published,” ? 2:22

After the Mark II fluorinator was taken off stream, trepanned sections
vere removed from the CRP trap and sent to BMI for corrosion analyses.
Figure 80 illustrates the sections removed.

Macroscopic examination of the samples at 20X revealed outlining of the

Inconel grains and an etched surface with increased attack noted at Section B-T.

Dimensional analyses were performed on the sections as well as a microscopic
examination. A summary of the corrosion losses found by BMI personnel is
presented in Table XXI. TInelunded in the table is a column converting the
maximum total losses to a mils per hour rate based on fluorine exposure time
at operating temperature for the vessel. A maximun total corrosion attack
rate of 0.46 mils/hr occurred in the lower section of the trap which sus-
tained the higher operating temperatures.

Optical microscopic examination of sections removed from the trap
revealed intergranular attack on both the interior and exterior surfaces of
the vegsel in the lower regions. The upper region showed intergranular attack
only on the vessel's interior wall. A typical cross section of the interior
wall of the CRP trap is shown in Fig. 81.

Comparison of the corrosive attack on the Inconel CRP trap and the Inconel
bench-scale fluorinator described in Section IIT indicated maximum rate losses
for the trap to be approximately twice that for the bench-scale fluorination
vessel. The most simllar areas with respect fo operating environments were
the lower vapor region of the fluorinator and the lower region of the CRP trap.
At those locations, similar temperatures (approx 500°C) and process gases
(F_,UF,) were present. In addition, however, sodium fluoride pellets were
in contact with the wall of the CRP trap. The maximum bulk metal losses in
the two regions were in a ratio of 3:1 (Trap:Fluorinator) while the maximum
interior intergranular penetration ratio was > 5:1. These differences are
difficult to reconcile in view of the 2:1 ratio for fluorine contact time at
elevated temperatures for the two vessels.

No appropriate reason can be advanced to explain the variations cited in
corrosive behavior for the CRP trap and the Inconel bench-scale fluorinator.
However, the results present additional evidence that Inconel should be used
with caution as the construction material for certain fluoride volatility

process components.

into & low-carbon steel waste container. Pressures of approx 5 psig in the
fluorinator were normally used to start the waste-salt flow. The salt then
flowed through the waste line by siphon effect (See Fig. 79). The salt line
reported here was used during the VPP IL Runs 1-0 and for a single transicr at
the end of Run M-0l,

The subject waste-salt line was 3/8-in. sched-h0 Inconel pipe. The line
was held at temperatures of 550-835°C for approx 22.5 hr and exposed to
flowing molten salils for about 2.5 hr during the pressure transfers. o Tt was
probable that residual salts remained in static contact with the interior wall
of the piping for all operations.

After Run M-6l, the piping was removed from the pilot plant, sectioned
in nine places and specimens sent to BMI for corrosion analyses. Figure G2
shows & schematic drawing of the waste line and the location of the specimens.
Table XXII lists the corrosion data established at BMI by micrometer measure-
ments and metallographic examinations. Maximum wall-thickness losses of
21 mils were found in specimen IX which was at the exit end of the waste-salt
line,

Metallograpnhic examination of the specimens snowed slight intergranular
attack of 1/2-mil penetration depth had occurred on the interior wall of all
the samples with the exception of specimen IX. In the latter, a 3.5-mil thick
corresion product layer was found on the interior surface of the specimen.

Figure 83 shows the corrosion product layer and the subsurface structure.
The product layer was spongy in character and similar in appearance to surface
layers found on sections removed from early test Inconel freeze valves which
had been in contact with NaF, ZrF,, UF, (50-hé-h mole %) at c50°¢, (ref 53)

Personnel at BMI suggested thal the product layer might be the result
of selective leaching of chromium by the fused salt. They indicated that the
appearance was quite similar to layers found on Inconel in contact with hydrogen
fluoride and Tused fluoride salts where chromium leaching had been proven.
Analyses of the metallic spongy deposit found on sections removed from the

Inconel freeze valve referenced above indicated considerable losses of chromium

Since air, probably containing water vapor, could enter tne exit line

effect of a strong oxidant in the fluoride salt contacting the Inconel, In
such cases, it has been reported that the nickel ion rapidly goes into

present in this area of the absorber were NaF pellets, F, and UF. Table XXTII
shows the prior history of the ring up to the time of failure. Three unusual
plant operating procedures were a part of this prior nistory:” | (1) substitu-
tion of hydrogen fluoride for low temperature fluorine conditioning, (2) allowing
fluorine to enter the absorber at approx 600°C rather than 375°C as specified
in the standard operating procedures (the higher temperature was used to
minimize hydrogen fluoride from the NaF and to reduce the sodium fluosilicate
content of the War), (3) use of an accelerated cooling rate after desorption.
Only (2) is felt to be pertinent toward causing the failure described.
Metallographic examination and chemical analysis of the samples cut from
the failed pipe, revealed only that the Inconel was normal in chemistry and
microstructure. The microstructure was equivalent to as-recelved stock. The
molten and recast nodules exhibited a typical cast structure.
The Inconel gas-distribution ring appears to have failed as the result
of ignition with fluorine. Ignition is believed to have been initiated by an
unknown foreign substance, guch as dirt or grease, introduced while the absorber
was open. The failure points up the necegsity for extreme cleanliness when

handling fluorine.

Inspection of Absorbers. Following Tluorination Run [-9, the absorbers

 

were visually inspected and thickness measurements taken with a"Vidigage."
The ultrasonic device was operated by members of the Nondestructive Testing
Group of the Metallurgy Division. Results of those examinations are cited in
Figs. 86 and 87. The maximum detectible losses found were approx 30 mils in
the upper regions of the vessel, a rate of approx 0.06 mils/hr, based upon
fluorine residence time.

Based on these results, it 1s believed that the vessels can continue to

be used in pilot plant operation.

Valves and Fittings

 

Agide from sporadic leakage and some plugging by unidentified deposits
of valves carrylog UF, valves and fittings in the VPP performed satisfac-
torily. Many screwed fittings carrying nitrogen were back-welded after
various amounts of plant operational time to eliminate such leakage.

fluorine carrying valves of various body materials, i.e,, Monel, nickel,
Tuconel, steel, types 316 and 347 stainless steel, brass, and copper, were
welded or brazed into the associated piping. AU temperatures greater than
150°C, only nickel and Tnconel valves were in contact with fluorine under
normal. operating conditions.

One faillure, originally thought to be in a valve but later discovered
to be in the adjacent fittings, has been selected for treatment here because
of the materials involved and their reaction to service conditions.

Following Run I-44 in the VPP, leaded, yellow brass valve fittings of the
composition 60-63% Cu-2.5-3.7% Pb-0,35% Max Fe-0.5% other-bal %n (vendor's
analysis) were removed from a nitrogen purge line, PE-34, because of defective
valve operation,

The inlet side of the valve, a packless diaphragm-seal valve with an
Inconel diaphragm, Duranickel stem point, and Monel body and trim, was placed
in conjunction with the Wal absorber outlet piping which carried F, and. UF.
Under normal operating conditions, the valve was not in contact with process
gases, but there was continuous nitrogen contact. The valve was shut only
when nitrogen pressure was low and there was the possibility of process gases
diffusing past the valve to the instrumentation units.

During the early L-runs, persistent system plugs and low pressure in the
nitrogen line probably permitted ¥, and UF to contact the valve and its
fittings for an unknown period of time. The operating service time on the
velve and its Tithings was approx 6 weeks.

Visual examination of the valve disclosed no obvious defects. Therefore,
it was subjected to several times operating pressure (15 psig) by VPP persou-
nel and found to function satisfactorily without leakage. The valve was

subsequently placed in stock to be used as an emergency replacement.
Visual observation of the fittings revealed that several components nad
ruptures running the complete length of the walls, The fissures were normal
to stresses induced during installation. Figure 88 and Table XXIV show and
describe the defects noted. Metallographic examination of the fittings re-
vealed the cracks to be intergranular in nature. Dezinciification apparently
occurrea along the inside edges of the fissures, as evidenced by copper-rich
deposits which lined the fissures. (See Fig. 89.) Copper deposits were also
evident in several grain boundaries radiating outward from the flaw. General
corrosive attack was noted on the outside of the inlet union, Fig. 90.

Although all evidence indicales that failure was by selective inter-
granular dezincification, the stresses induced during installation were believed
to have provided a strong directional driving force. The use of stock Monel
fittings, because of ils increased corrosion resistance, was recommended for
use in the environment described.

The associated Monel valve was found to be in good operating condition,
appeared satisfactory, and can continue to be used for the mentioned service
conditions.

This failure serves to point out the necessity for constant vigilance in
selecting materials and components for a highly corrosive process scheme.
This includes the selection of piping and joining couples which should, if at

all possible, match the components in corrosion-resistant properties.

Fluorine Disposal System

 

Excess fluorine and nitrogen from the VPP have been disposed of by co~
current contact with an aqueous KOH solution in a gas-disposal unit. (See
Figs. 79 and 91.) The KOH solution was prepared in a caustic surge tank,
shown in Figs. 79 and 92, to a concentration of 2—10% KOH and pumped to the
disposal unit. The caustic solution was then sprayed into the disposal unit
as the excess process gases entered the vessel. Fluorine in the waste gases

formed potassium fluoride in water solution according to

which subsequently was discharged as chemical waste while the nitrogen re-

~

maining in the excess gases was exhausted Lo the atmosphere, The entire
Tluorine disposal system was fabricated from Monel.

After VPP Run L-9, visual and ultrasonic thickness measurements were
taken on the gas-digposal unit and the surge tank Lo ascertain thelr suita-
bility for additional VPP service. The respective service conditions for
the two vessels and the results of those inspections are presented in
Figs. 91 and 92. A maximum wall-thickness loss of 5 mils was Found near
the top head of the gas-disposal unit while no detectable metal losses were
found in the surge tank.

Previous studies have indicated that heavy corrosive attack can occur
on the process gas inlet pipe inside the gas~disposal SE Therefore, an
inlet pipe fabricated from l-in. sched-UO Monel pipe in service for approx
L900 hr was removed from the disposal unit and subjected to visual and metallo-

graphic examination. Figure 91 shows

Visual examination of the exterior of the pipe inlet disclosed the
presence of two holes, approx 1/32 in. and 3/32 in. in dianeter, res
on the upper half of the pipe. The holes completely penetrated the pipe wall
and were 1-1/2 in. and 2-1/2 in, from the exit end of the pipe. Insovection

the interior of the nozzle showed an extremely rough surface and a severe
pitting attack extending from the end of the nozzle inwards Tor approx 3 in.
A white crystalline deposit encircled the interior at a point 4 in. from the
end of the pipe. Subsequent x-ray dlffraction analysis indicated this deposit
to be wholly KHF,,

Metallographic examination of sections removed from the pipe showed a
roughened surface and metal losses concentrating in circular cavities but no

evidence of intergranular attack. The holes described above wera simple ax-

=

tensions of the localized attack. I

Corrosion seemsd to have been directional from the interior toward the
exterior of the pipe. Examination of the fluorine~-nitrogen entrance end of
the pipe disclosed no noticeable or measurable attack.

Intermittently during operations, the gas-inlet nozzle plugszed (presum-
ably by KF and/or KF, deposits) and this condition occurred with such
frequency during the "BE" and early "L" runs that a secondary nozzle was in-
serted in place of a lower KOO inlet. HExamination of this secondary nozzle,
which had approx 100 service hours, disclosad a very slight attack similar
to that found on the primary pipe.

The presence of RUF, inside the main gas~inlet pipe is believed to
occasion the high localized corrosion found in that component. It would
appear that an easy way for KiIF,, to form in the pipe would be by the alkali

deficient reaction of KOH with HF as
2HF + KOH orn KH, + i 0. (ref 59)

The formation of hydrogen fluoride seems possible from the reactions of
fluorine monoxide or fluorine with the available water of solution present,

Investigators have reported the hydrolysis reaction of r.0

to be very slow at ordinary temperatures out a steam-¥,0 reaction occurs so
rapidly that it can be considered explosive, For reasons unknown, the re-
achbion of fluorine with water has been reported as not always occurring.

One source has indicated that fluorine reacts with water easily, giving oxygen
mixed with ozone, hydrogen peroxide, and other oxidizing substances.

If hydrogen fluoride is present In the gas-1inlet pipe, then the high

degree of localized attack on the nozzle may be explained ag the result of

hydrogen fluoride corrosion highly accelerated by the presence of oxygen.
Also, at particular concentrations of hydrogen fluoride in water, close to
the azeotropic composition (38 wt %), one invesiigator has reported corrosion
rates on Monel of 145 mils/yr at orc, (ref 63) It may be that either or
both of these reactions may be responsible Tor the localized attack described.
Considering the easy replacement of the gas-inlet nozzle and the major

corrosion problems remaining to be solved in the VPP, no development work

has been planned toward finding an Improved material of construction.
Process Gas Lines

Sections of Monel pipe and copper tubing near the VPP absorbers, chemi-
cal traps, and cold traps were removed from the process gas piping system
after Run M-Eh and sent to BMI for corrosion analyses. A schematic drawing
showing the location of these sections is presented in Fig. 94, and a descrip-
tion of the piping and the individual process environments can be found in
Table XXV.

The wall thicknesses of the sections were measured by BMI and no indica-
tion of significant metal losses were found. The metallographic examinations
conducted on the specimens disclosed no serious corrosive attack. Almost all
of the specimens showed isolated pitting but the pits were less than one grain
deep. Slight indication of selective attack at the grain boundaries was
observed on specimens 1-1, 1-2, 1-3, 2, and 3 which were located close to the

absorbers and the first cold trap. However, the intergranular attack was

never deeper than one grain, and for the most part, was less than 1 mil deep.
