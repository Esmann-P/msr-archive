THEORETICAL DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF THE MSRE WITH 233U FUEL

R. C. Steffy, Jr. and P. J. Wood¥

Abstract

A study undertaken to characterize the dynamics of the
233y-fueled MSRE prior to operation revealed that the system
is inherently asymptotically stable at all power levels above
zero. The motivation for these studies was the expected dif-
ference between the MSRE dynamic response with 233U fuel and
with 2357 fuel because of the smaller delayed-neutron frac-
tion of 233yU, An existing system model, previously verified
for 235y fuel, was modified for use in this work. The reac-
tor system response to:reactivity perturbations is rapid and
nonoscillatory at high power, and it becomes sluggish and
oscillatory at lower powers. These characteristics were de-
termined by three methods: (1) transient-response analyses,
including a check of the validity of the linear model, (2) a
frequency-response and sensitivity study, (3) stability analy-
ses, both by inspection of the system eigenvalues and by ap-
plication of the recently developed, modified Mikhailov cri-
terion.

Keywords: MSRE, ?33U fuel, stability, eigenvalues,
modified Mikhailov criteria, frequency response, sensitivity,
time response, Padé approximations.

1. Introduction

As a preliminary step in the development of a molten-salt-fueled
breeder reactor, the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was fueled with
233y to perform the necessary physics and chemistry experiments on this
first 233y-fueled nuclear power reactor. Before nuclear operation, it was
important to anticipate the dynamic behavior and the inherent.stability of

“the system in order to insure safe, orderly operation and to plan safe,

definitive experiments.

The principal motivation. for evaluating the operating characteristics
of the 233y-fueled MSRE after more than 70,000 Mwhr of power operation
with 235U fuel is that .223U has a much smaller delayed-neutron fraction

(B) than that of 23°U. The 233y fuel was ‘expected to have operating char-
acteristics somewhat different from those of 23°U end, in particular, a
faster response to reactivity perturbations. Table 1 lists the predicted
basic nuclear-kinetics properties of the MSRE with ?33U fuel and compares
them with those of the reactor with 23°U fuel.

Several different techniques were used in analyzing the dynamics of
‘the 233U-fueled MSRE, primarily because each technique either gave infor-
‘mation unavailable from the others or used different approximate treat-
ments to describe the system. In performing the ‘dynamics analyses a model
developed by Ball and Kerlin' was modified slightly and used to describe
the MSRE with 233U fuel. (This model did not include the effect of the
reactor control system.) The time response of the reactor system to a
reactivity perturbation at several power levels was calculated first. The
‘computer code MATEXP, 2 which calculates the time response of a multivari-
able nonlinear system with pure time delays, was used in this study. Next
. the system frequency response was determined by using the computer code
SFR-3 (Ref. 3). This code was also used to determine amplitude ratio (or
gain) sensitivity to changes in the system variables (i.e., the ratio of
‘the change in amplitude ratio to the corresponding change in a system vari-
‘able was determined as a function of frequency). Finally, the absolute
stability of the system was investigated by two techniques. The system
eigenvalues were calculated at several powers to determine whether oscil-
lations induced in the system would increase or decrease in amplitude,
and the Mikhailov stability criterion, as modified by Wright and Kerlin,*
was used to obtain this same information with fewer approximations ‘in the
mathematical model.

"Linearized system equations were used in the frequency-response and
sensitivity calculations and in both types of stability analysis. This
was necessary because general calculational methods do not presently exist
that would permit these types of analysis with a set of nonlinear system
equations. The ‘time-response calculations utilized the nonlinear equa-
tions. This was possible because they involved an iterative procedure |

that provided for -updating the nonlinear terms after each iteration.

2. Model Description and Verification

A mathematical model was required to describe the dynamic ‘behavior
of the ??3U-fueled MSRE. The model chosen for this study was essentially
that called the "complete model" in Ref. 1, which was developed to analyze
the dynamics of the 235y_fueled MSRE. The justification for using this
model was its good agreement with experimental results when applied to
the 235y. fueled system. ?

Some changes were made in the model of Ref. 1, however, before it
was applied to the ?33U-fueled system. The experimental results of the
previous testing program did not verify the dip in the calculated frequency
response curve at approximately 0.25 radian/sec, . which. corresponds to a
fuel circulation time of approximately 25 sec. This was attributed to .in-
sufficient mixing of fuel salt in the external loop of ‘the theoretical
model. To provide the model with more mixing, an additional 2-sec first-
order ‘time lag (mixing pot) was incorporated at the core outlet. This is
a reasonable approximation for the mixing in the upper and lower reactor-
vessel plenums.

The chief features of the 44th-order model, shown in Fig. 1, are the
following:
1. The reactor core was divided into nine regions, each of which
was split into two fuel lumps and one graphite lump. Consideration was
given to the nuclear importance of thermal disturbances in each of the
lumps. (The term "lump" as used in mathematical modeling refers to a seg-
ment of a physical system that is considered to have constant properties
throughout and which interacts with its surroundings through only those
properties.) :

‘2. A five-lump representation of the fuel-to-coolant heat exchanger
‘was used, with heat being exchanged to a single metal lump at the tempera~-
‘ture of the fuel leaving the first of two fuel lumps and heat being ex-
-changed from the metal lump to the coolant at the outlet ‘temperature of
‘the first of two coolant lumps.

-3. A three-lump coolant-to-air radiator. was used in which the coolant
transferred heat to a single metal lump at the temperature of the coolant
leaving the first of two coolant lumps.

4. A linear model of the reactor kinetics equations was used in all
studies, except the time-response calculations, in which nonlinear kinetics
‘effects were taken into account. .

5. The neutron kinetics equations were represented by a mathematical
expression that accounted for the dynamic effect of circulating precursors
(except for the eigenvalue calculation, which required the use of effec-
tive delayed-neutron fractions).

6. Xenon poisoning was assumed to be at steady state and not influ-

enced by small perturbations.

3. Transient-Response Analysis

Time responses were obtained at several power levels to provide a
physical picture of the reactor response to reactivity perturbations such
as control rod motions. The computer code MATEXP? applied in this analy-
sis makes use of the matrix exponentiation technique of solving a system
of nonlinear ordinary differential equations (with pure time delays) of
the form

Soa) TR), (1)
where
X = the solution vector (system state variables),
A = system matrix (constant square matrix with real coefficients),
MA(X) = a matrix whose elements are deviations from the values in A,
[thus AA(X) x includes all nonlinear effects and time delay
terms],
f(t) = forcing function.

The predicted response of the reactor power to a step reactivity in-
crease of 0.02% 8k/k is shown in Fig. 2 for various initial powers. These
response curves point out several important characteristics of the MSRE.
At 8 Mw the maximum power level is reached during the first second after
the step reactivity input. The rapid increase in reactor power is accom-
panied by a rapid increase in fuel temperature in the core, which, coupled

with the negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, more than

counterbalances the step reactivity input, so the power level begins to \/
decrease. The temperature of the salt entering the core is constant dur-
‘ing this interval, and when the power has decreased enough for the reac- +
‘tivity associated with the increased nuclear average temperature to just
cancel the step reactivity input, the power levels for a brief time (from
~6 to ~17 sec after the reactivity input). About 17 sec after the reac-
tivity increase, the hot fluid generated in the initial power ‘increase
has completed its circuit of the loop external to the core, and the nega-
tive temperature coefficient of the salt again reduces the reactivity so
that the power level starts down again. - At large times the reactor power
‘has returned to its initial level, and the step reactivity input has been
counterbalanced by an increase in the nuclear average temperature in the
core. The short plateau observed in the time-response curve at.8 Mw was
also noted in the 5-Mw case. At lower powers, however, the slower system
response prevents the reactor from reaching the peak of its first oscilla-
tion before the fuel has completed one circuit of the external fuel loop.
The plateau therefore does not appear in the lower power cases.

An important characteristic of the MSRE dynamic response is that as
:the power ‘is decreased the reactor becomes both sluggish (slower respond-
ing) and oscillatory; that is, at low powers the time required for oscil-
lations to die out is much larger than at higher powers, and the fractional

)

amplitude of the oscillations (A power/power) is larger.

As part of the time-response analysis, the validity of the linear ap-
proximation for reactivity perturbations roughly equivalent to 1/2 in. of
‘control rod movement (0.04% 8k/k) was checked. The results of this analy-
sis are shown in Figs. 3 and 4 for 8- and 0.1-Mw operation. At 8 Mw the
linear approximation is fairly good, but at 0.1 Mw it is poor. This re-
sult can be understood by considering the general form of the neutron-

kinetics equations:

where

dn = deviation of power from its initial value (ng),
po = reactivity necessary to overcome effect of fuel circulation,
Br = total delsyed-neutron fraction,
! = neutron generation time in system,
Op = deviation of reactivity from its initial value,
N = decay constant for ith delayed-neutron precursor,

5C4 = concentration of ith delayed-neutron precursor.

The last term in Eq. (2), 5p8n/!, is the nonlinear term. In the
8-Mw case the maximum deviation of the power from the initial power is
only about 30% of the initial power, whereas in the 0.1-Mw case the maxi-
mum deviation is 560% of the initial power and is still increasing after
50 sec. When the dn term is this large with respect to the ng term, the
nonlinear terms in the kinetics equation play a much larger role than the
linear terms. Thus, neglecting the nonlinear terms may lead to signifi-
cant ‘error if the power -deviates from its initial level by more than a
few percent. For the time-response analysis, it was necessary to include
the nonlinear terms to obtain realistic results; however, use of the lin-
earized equations in the frequency-domain analysis (Section 4 of this re-
port) is acceptable because the analysis is based on small reactivity and

power perturbations that oscillate around their initial values.

4. Frequency-Response Analysis

Because a closed-loop frequency-response analysis provides informa-
tion about relative system behavior, the linear MSRE model was studied at
different power levels from this point of view. The linear system equa-
tions were first Laplace transformed and then solved for the ratio of an
output variable (such as power or temperature) to an input variable (such

as reactivity). This ratio, called a transfer function, is

 

.
 

”

n

n

Ral

where
G(S) = transfer function,
0(8) = the output variable,
I(S) = input variable,
S = Laplace transform variable.

For a stable system, S may be replaced by jw, where J = V-1 ana w is the

frequency of an input sine wave. With this substitution, G(jw) is a com-

plex number; the magnitude of G(jw) is called the gain or the magnitude
ratio and is the ratio of the amplitude of an input sinusoid to that of
an output sinusoid. The phase of G(jw) is the phase difference between

the input and the output sinusoids. A plot of G(jw) and the phase of

G(jw) versus w is referred to as a Bode diagram or a frequency-response
plot. A Bode plot provides qualitative stability information in the peaks
of ‘the magnitude ratio curves. High, narrow peaks indicate lower stability

“than flatter, broader peaks.

There are two basic reasons for calculating the frequency response

of a system. First, the frequency-response curves are good indicators of

system performance, and second, the frequency response of a system may be

‘experimentally determined. The latter consideration is important because

it provides a means for checking the validity of a model. When the ex-

 perimentally determined frequency response of the system is in agreement

with that of the theoretical model, confidence is gained in the conclusions
drawn from the stability analysis applied to the model.
4.1 Calculated Frequency Response of Power to Reactivity

4.1.1 For Noncirculating Fuel. The calculated frequency response
of the MSRE for ‘the noncirculating, . zero-power,. 233U-fueled condition ‘is

~ shown in Fig. 5. These curves are very similar to those of the classic

zero-power reactor, and reference curves may be found in most textbooks
on ‘reactor dynamics.® 7 At zero power, temperature feedback effects are
not important, so.the calculated response is that of ‘the neutron-kinetics

equations.

4.1.2 For Circulating Fuel. A set of frequency-response curves for
circulating ?33U fuel is shown in Fig. 6. These curves show the effect

of power over the range from zero to 8 Mw. The primary reason for the
change in curve shape as the power level is changed is the change in mag-
nitude of the temperature-feedback effect. At higher power levels a
smaller percentage change in power ‘level causes a larger absolute tempera-
ture change which, in turn, affects reactivity through the negative tem-
perature coefficient.
| At higher power levels, the maximum peaks of the magnitude-ratio
plots decrease, and these maximums are reached at higher frequencies.
This implies that after a reactivity perturbation, the relative power re-
sponse sn/ng will be of smaller magnitude and will tend to return to zero
faster at high power levels than it will at lower power levels. (This
observation was also made in the time-response calculations of the pre-
ceding section.)

The dip in the higher power curves at approximately 0.25 radian/sec
(corresponding to the fuel loop transit time of ~25 sec) results from tem-
perature feedback from the external loop. During a periodic reactivity
perturbation at a frequency of about 0.25 radian/sec, the fuel in the
core during one cycle would return to the core one period later and pro-
‘duce a reactivity feedback effect that would partially cancel the exter-
nal perturbation. With the 2?°U fuel the amplitude ratio of the frequency-
response curves was relatively low at this frequency, and the dip was not
as pronounced. However, the amplitude ratio of the frequency-response
curves for the 233U fuel loading are relatively high out to greater than
1 radian/sec, so the loop feedback is emphasized. The more negative tem-
perature coefficient of reactivity for the 233y fuel also tends to -empha-~
size the effect of loop feedback.

4.2 Effect of Mixing in the Fuel Loop

| The curves in Fig. 6 were calculated with the model discussed in
Section 2 of this report. The choice of a 2-sec mixing pot at the core
outlet was based on the estimated mixing that occurs in the reactor ves-
sel plenums but was somewhat arbitrary, and it was therefore desirable to
explore the effect of different mixing approximations on the frequency-

response curves. Figure 7 shows the effect on the 8-Mw frequency-response

curve of varying the lag time of the mixing pot from O to 5 sec. (Note
that mixing was still assumed to occur in each "lump" of the reactor and
heat ‘exchanger and that in this -analysis the effect of additional mixing
was considered.) The use of pure time delays (i.e., no mixing) to describe
flow in lines external to the core gives a plot with sharp curves. As the
time in the mixing pot increases, the curve becomes smoother. At low fre-
quencies (<0.06 radian/sec) and at high frequencies (>1.0 radian/sec) the
effect of mixing is negligible. At low frequencies the fuel temperature
changes slowly enough for the effects of additional mixing in the lines

to become insignificant, and at high frequencies, the neutron-kinetics ef-
fects dominate and temperature feedback from the external loop is unimpor-
tant.

The amount of mixing in a circulating fuel, such as in the MSRE, is
not easily determined analytically. The quantity of interest is not really
the amount of salt "mixed" with other salt but, rather, the extent to which
the temperature of a slug of salt is affected by its surroundings during
its journey around the loop. Physical mixing of the salt, conductive heat
transfer with adjoining slugs of salt, convective heat transfer to the
pipe wall, and heat transfer in the heat exchanger all result in "mixing"
the salt temperature. The experimental results of the 233y testing pro-
gram may permit a determination of the size of the mixing pot that best
describes the actual physical situation in the MSRE.

4.3 Sensitivity of dn/ne” Ok to Parameter Changes

The equations used to model the MSRE contain many independent parame-
ters. Most of these are well known, but conditions may be postulated un-
der which their values might change. The effects on the magnitude ratio
of changes in each individual parameter were determined by performing a
sensitivity analysis. > The results of this analysis for selected vari-
ables are shown in Fig. 8.

The frequency range in which each variable is most important is &
parent from the curves. In principle the theoretical frequency response
could be compared with the response determined experimentally and the pa-
rameter that might be changing could be selected, or it could be determined

that the value of a certain parameter was estimated incorrectly in the
theoretical model. In practice, it is more likely that an actual change
in system performance would affect more than one parameter. For example,
a change in fuel-salt flow rate would affect the temperature feedback,
effective delayed-neutron concentration, prompt temperature effects in the
core, and heat transfer in the heat exchanger. ‘The frequency response .
would be expected to change in the region where each of these variables
was important. Certainly any appreciable change in fuel-salt flow rate
could be detected by an experimental frequency-response determination,
but to pinpoint the exact cause might be difficult. There are changes
other than fuel-salt flow rate that might have an effect on only one or
two parameters. For these changes, it might be possible to determine the
exact cause of the anomalous behavior. Under any conditions, the sensi-
tivity analysis gives valuable information as to the frequency range in
which each parameter affects the system response and the relative jmpor=-

tance of each parameter.

4.4 Frequency Response .of Outlet Temperature to. Power

Analyses of experimental data taken at the end of operation with 235U
fuel showed that temperature perturbations were being introduced into the
core as a result of heat transfer fluctuations at the radiator. These
. were significant enough in some cases to appreciably affect the experimen-
tal frequency-response determination. This, together with the mixing
problem, led to a calculation of the frequency response of the reactor
outlet temperature with respect to power (5T/8n) to provide a means of
determining the effect of extraneous temperature disturbances.

From a theoretical standpoint, many temperature-to-power frequency
‘responses may be calculated. However, only those that may be experimen-
tally verified are of use in comparing a theoretical model with a physi-
cal system or in determining the effect of outside influences (such as
wind velocity affecting the radiator heat transfer) during an actual test.
The model discussed previously was modified to include a term that rep-
-resented the fuel-salt temperature, as recorded by a thermocouple, 2.5
sec ‘downstream of the outlet of the 2-sec mixing pot. This position was

chosen because it corresponds to the location of a particular thermocouple.

with a convenient output. The response of a thermocouple located on the
outside of a fuel-salt pipe to a change in fuel-salt temperature was found®
to be adequately approximated by a l-sec pure time delay plus a 5-sec
first-order lag. - A schematic diagram of the model that incorporates these
changes is shown in Fig. 9.

Figure 10 gives the frequency response of ‘the salt temperature to
power changes and the thermocouple response to power changes. At low fre-
quencies these are the same, but at high frequencies there is an increas-
ing difference between the frequency response of salt temperature to power
changes and that of the indicated temperature to power changes because of
the finite time required to transfer heat through the pipe wall.

The effect of fuel mixing-on the 8T/8n frequency response may also

be seen in Fig. 10. In addition to the 2-sec mixing pot at the reactor

outlet, a 5-sec mixing pot was included between the heat exchanger and the
core. This caused the frequency-response plot to be smoothed between 0.1
and 0.3 radians/sec but had no noticeable effect at other frequencies.

The differences in magnitude of the 8T/5n curves at low frequencies
for different power levels is caused by heat transfer changes at the ra-
diator. The tube-to-air heat transfer coefficient was assumed to vary

with the air flow rate to the 0.6 power. The air flow rate was assumed

© to vary linearly with the power level.

5. Stability Analysis

be represented by the block diagram shown in Fig. 11, its closed-loop
power-to-reactivity transfer function can be written as

In this application, G is the transfer function of the reactor kinetics

and H is the transfer function for the system feedback, which includes the-

effect of prompt temperature changes in the core, as well as delayed tem-

perature effects caused by the salt circulation. The denominator of this

transfer function, 1 + GH, is a polynomial (called the characteristic
polynomial) in the Laplace transform variable S. The roots of this poly-
nomial are the poles of the system transfer function. These roots are
equal to .the eigenvalues of the system coefficient matrix, A. . A necessary
and sufficient condition for linear asymptotic stability is that the syg-
tem poles (and therefore the eigenvalues of A) have negative real parts.
This criterion gives a definite answer to the question of linear stability.
If the physical system has an N X N coefficient matrix (N linear equations
‘in N system state varisbles), it will have N eigenvalues. The dominant
-eigenvalues of a stable system are the complex eigenvalues nearest to the
imaginary axis. These eigenvalues dominate the time response of a system
Af the other eigenvalues ‘are relatively far removed from-the imaginary
axis. Two things can be learned about the behavior of a system from the
location in the complex plane of the dominant eigenvalues. First, after

a stable system has been perturbed, the amplitude of the oscillations in
a system variable decreases exponentially with a time constant equal to
the inverse of the distance of the dominant eigenvalue from the imaginary
axis. Second, the transient overshoot of the system is determined by the’
effective damping ratio, § (Ref. 9). This damping ratio is determined by
the angle Pp a vector from the origin of ‘the complex plane to the dominant

-eigenvalue makes with the imaginary axis:
tan B

f= ————

(4)

As tan B increases from O to =, & increases from O to 1. The value of &
determines how large the overshoot of the system is during a transient.
Small values of § indicate larger overshoot than large values. .

One characteristic of a zero-power ‘reactor is a. pole of the system
‘transfer function at ‘the intersection of ‘the real and imaginery axes.
Since the system eigenvalues correspond to the system poles, this also
implies an eigenvalue at the origin. The output. (for a reactor, the power)
of a system of this type will increase as long as there is a positive in-
put (reactivity) but will level out when there is no input.

0 vas used to determine the

"The computer code of Imad and Van Ness!
eigenvalues of the system matrix, but before the eigenvalues of ‘the sys-
tem could be determined, an approximate treatment of the pure time delays
"in ‘the system model was necessary. An eighth-order Padé approximation
(see Appendix) was used for all time delays except the one representing
the circulation of the delayed-neutron precursors around the ‘external
loop. To account for the fact that the fuel was circulating, a set of
effective delayed-neutron fractions (Bepr) was used in the ‘eigenvalue
calculation. - I.

© 5.1.2 Eigenvalue Calculation Results. Figure:12 shows several of

the dominant eigenvalues plotted for various power levels. The real part

 

of each calculated eigenvalue is negative, with the general trend being
toward smaller absolute values with decreasing power level. The negative
real parts insure linear asymptotic stability, and the trend toward smaller
absolute values with decreasing power level again points to a higher de-
gree of stability at higher power levels. The eigenvalues that lie rela-
tively far removed from the real axis (those with positive imaginary com-
ponents between 0.20 and 0.30) are a result of the coupled energy-balance
‘equations and are relatively independent of nuclear power. They do, how-
ever, exhibit some power dependence, primarily because of the variation
in heat transfer coefficient at :the radiator with power level. - The physi-
cal implication of these eigenvalues is that any temperature disturbance
in the system would tend to cause slight temperature oscillations around
the system, even if the nuclear power were zero. The eigenvalues for the
nuclear kinetics equations were all on the real axis for the Zero-power
condition.

The calculation for zero power resulted in a. dominant eigenvalue with
"a real part equal to ~0.36 X 10~7 sec”! and an imeginary part equal to
0.0. By proper manipulation of one coefficient in the system equations in
the fifth significant digit (the coefficients are generally not known to
better than four places) the value of the real part of the dominant eigen-
velue could be changed from a small negative velue to a small positive
value. While from a mathematical standpoint the positive sign would imply
instability, it must be realized that within the accuracy of the calcula-
tion, both these values are zero. A calculated value of identically zero

(the expected value at zero power) would have resulted only if absolute
precision had been maintained throughout the calculation.

As a point of general interest, a set of system equations with an
eigenvalue with real part equal to -1 X 10-6 sec™! implies that a perturbed
system, after the input perturbations has vanished, spontaneously returns
to. its original state with a time constant of 10° sec (11.5 days); simi-'
larly, an eigenvalue with real part equal to +1 X 10"6 sec”! would spon-
taneously deviate away from its original state with an 11.5-day time con-
stant. While the difference in stability between these two cases is ob-
vious, neither would represent a difficult problem to the control system
designer, and either case would represent acceptable system behavior; or,
conversely, for a particular application, if one of these was unacceptable,
both would probably be unacceptable.

The eigenvalues that form the curve which goes to the origin at zero
power (see Fig. 12) were used to calculate the damping ratio, £. Results
of this calculation are listed below:

Power ¢, Damping

(Mw) Ratio
0.1 0.16
1.0 0.37
5.0 0.96
‘8.0 0.99

Since there are eigenvalues on the real axis that have real parts of about
the same magnitude as those used in the calculation, the system damping
ratio cannot alone be used to determine the system oscillatory behavior;
however, it is useful as a relative indicator. The damping ratio again
emphasizes the MSRE characteristic of being less oscillatory at high power

‘levels than at low power.

5.2 Modified Mikhailov Method

5.2.1 Theoretical Discussion. An alternate technique for determin-
‘ing absolute stability of a linear system was recently developed by Wright
and Kerlin® along the lines of the method of Mikhailov. The chief advan-
‘tage of this method over the eigenvalue technique is that no approximations
 

27

are necessary to treat pure time delays. The technique of Wright and
Kerlin is based on a linear constant-parameter system of order N, which
can be written as a set of coupled, first-order differential equations
with constant coefficients:

St) A X(t) + R(t,7) + 5 £(t) , (5)

where

x(t) = column vector of system state variables,

A = constant N X N coefficient matrix,
f(t) = forcing function,
B = column vector of coefficients of £(t),
R(t,T) = matrix of time delay terms, each of the form

Tix (t - Tyy) .
A Laplace transform of Eq. (5) yields
S X(S) = A X(S) + R(S,T) +B £(S), (6)

where S is the Laplace transform variable. The transform of one of the

time-lagged elements,
Ty 4%, (t - Tyg) ,

is

Ts x,(8) ST s

so R(S, 7) may be written
R(S,7) = L(S) x(s) , (7)

where L(S) is a matrix composed of the Tyg e"S™ terms. Substitution
into Eq. (5) and manipulation yields

x(s) ;
— =—[A-ST+1]"'E, (8)
£(s)

i

where I is the identity matrix, and super —1 indicates the inverse matrix.

 
 

28

The absolute stability of the system is determined by the location of the

roots of ‘the equation
det (A-SI +1L1L)=0.

The values of S for which the sbove equation is satisfied are the system
eigenvalues or characteristic roots.

In their development of the modified Mikhailov stability criterion,
‘Wright and Kerlin defined a quantity M(S) as

D(s)
M(s) == (9)
P(S)
where
D(S) = det (A— SI +L) , (10)
P(S) = det (T — 8I) , (11)

and T is an N X N diagonal matrix, each element of which is the negative
of the absolute value of the corresponding elements of the A matrix. The
quantity P(8) can be considered to be a factor that normalizes D(S) in
both magnitude and phase. The stability criterion associated with M(S)
is that "the number of zeros of the system determinant det (A— SI + L)

in the right half plane ‘equals the negative of the number of counterclock-
‘wise encirclements of the origin by the vector M(jw) as w goes from — to
400, "4 While hot explicitly stated in this quotation the important parame-
"ter is the net number of encirclements of the origin, with clockwise en-
circlements counting negative and counterclockwise encirclements counting
positive. Because of symmetry about ‘the real axis it is necessary only
“to plot M(jw) for w running from O to +o©. It can also be shown that M(jw)
approaches 1.0 as. w becomes large, so a finite number of w values can com--
pletely describe the motion of M(jw).

5.2.2 Results of Applying the Mikhailov Stability Criterion. By
using a computer program developed by Wright and Kerlin, plots were gen-
‘erated of M(jw) for w running from O to +o. Figures 13 through 17 show
these plots for several power levels. As shown, at significant power lev-

els there are no .encirclements of the origin as w goes from —© to *«. As

in the eigenvalue calculation, the results of zero-power calculations
were highly sensitive to small changes in coefficients in the system ma-
trix. While the zero-power plots actually show an encirclement of the
origin when the total plot from —=o to + is considered, the intercept at
—6.5 x 1078 should, of course, be interpreted as passing through the ori-
gin. This is typical for a zero-power reactor.

Application of the modified Mikhailov stability criterion to the set
of system equations that describe the MSRE verifies that the MSRE is in-
herently stable at all power levels.

6. Concluding Discussion

The overall result of this study is a determination that the MSRE
fueled with 233U is an inherently stable system at all power levels of
interest. The response of the uncontrolled system at powers. above zero
power, as seen in the transient analysis and corroborated by the eigen-
values, is rapid and nonoscillatory at high powers and becomes sluggish
and oscillatory at low powers. It is recommended that the 233U-fueled
MSRE be subjected to a testing program at powers from zero to full power
to experimentally verify the predicted response. These experiments should
be performed in such a way that both the on/0k and 8T/on transfer functions
can be determined, since both can now be compared with theoretical predic-

tions.

PADE APPROXIMATIONS

In the analysis of physical systems it ‘frequently becomes necessary -

‘instance, would be necessary to relate the outlet ‘temperature to the in-

let temperature of a fluid flowing in plug flow through an adiabatic pipe
if the axial heat conduction were negligible. If the inlet temperature

is x(t) and the delay time is T, the outlet temperature will be x(t — T).
The Laplace transform of a delayed variable x(t = T) is x(8) eI5, and if

a system containing time delays is to be analyzed simply, a linear approxi-

e ‘is as an infinite series:

Unfortunately this approximation does not converge rapidly for large val-

ues of TS. A better approximate treatment is the Padé approximation:®

r=1 1 + 20 TS + 1282

r=1

The order of this approximation is 2n. . Stubbs and Single! have suggested

that the criterion for selection of I. and Ty be such that the actual phase:

is as close as possible to the ideal phase shift for a pure time delay,

do = 4ltw

To meet this criterion, .they have suggested (for an eighth-order Padé
approximation) that the following values be used:

In =Vs/2

Iz = 0.40

T3 = 1.0

r, =0.5 -
11/72 = 1.68
13/1; = 1.14

For ‘this choice of constants the phase error (¢ — do) in the Padé approxi-

mation is less than one degree at wT = 13.5 radians. At higher frequen-

cies this error increases, and at lower frequencies it. decreases.

The following linear equations have been developed for the eighth-
order Padf approximation, where X35 is the variable input :to the time de-
lay, xo is the delayed variable output of the time delay, T is the delay

‘time, and y; through ys are Padé variables:
