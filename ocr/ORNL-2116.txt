CHARCOAL ADSORPTION TRAPS

by
W. E. Browning and C. C. Bolta

Summary
The purpose of this study is to determine holdup behavior of gaseous fission

| products in charcoal traps. The holdup behavior for a given gas is a function of
trap geometry, type and amount of charcoal, trap temperature, flow rate, and type
of Inert gas used to purge the trap. Radiokrypton, used to typify gaseous fission
products, was swept through the trap with either nitrogen or helium purge gas. Trap
temperatures studied were from + 16°¢ to ~110°C. It was determined that holdup times
of radiockrypton were greater for helium purge gas than for nitrogen purge gas. In
all cases holdup times increased with decreasing trap temperature. The maximum
concentration of krypton in effluent gas was lower for helium than for nitrogen
purge gas, and was lower at lower temperatures. For a given trap diameter, doubling
the length of trap doubles the time to peak and increases break through time and time
to reach the end of the peak. Doubling trap length reduces the maximum effluent
krypton concentration by half,

| An analytical expression is presented from which It appears possible to
predict holdup curves for gases when trap geometry and the linear adsorption isotherm
for the gas mixture on charcoal are known, Optimized traps may be designed for any

purpose with this information.

introduction

Gaseous fission products, from regions of nuclear processes which may be con
taminated by such gases, usually cannot be vented directly to the atmosphere. Charcoal
traps have been used to reduce to a safe level the rate at which the activity is

vented to the atmosphere.
ow 2 om

The traps reduce the amount of activity by holding it up while it decays and in the
case of a sudden burst of activity they reduce the rate of activity release by
releasing it slowly over a long period of time. To determine the amount of activity
leaving the traps as a function of time, the time the radiocactive gases are delayed
(holdup time) in the traps must be known, as well as the length of time over which
they are released. Both factors for a given gas are a function of trap geometry,
type and amount of charcoal, trap temperature and type and flow rate of inert
purging gas. The function of these parameters must be known to design and determine
the effectiveness of charcoal traps for gaseous fission products.

An investigation of the literature on adsorption of gases yielded two pertinent
reports. The paper by E. Wicke published in 1940 presents a comprehensive study of
the "microscopic mechanism of adsorption in long, small diameter tubes. High con-
centrations of COp in nitrogen as carrier gas were studied at 0°C and at 100°C. A
mathematical analysis of gas mixing and sorption velocities is presented. As stated
in the report; the results obtained are not directly applicable to many industrial
processes, but nevertheless, they afford an excellent foundation for experiments to
develop industrial uses of adsorption.

D. Cues? reported a study of the adsorption of radiokrypton on charcoal in a
Solid State Division Semiannual Report. Break through times of radiokrypton at room
temperature were reported for several traps of different geometry, The objective of
the experiment was to determine the length of time before the adsorbate first appeared
in the effluent gas from the trap, rather than concentration changes with time after
break through. The need for information on this type of work was increased and the
present experiment was a natural ocutgrowth of Guss'! work.

Experimental Procedure
An experiment was set up (see Fig. 1) using radickrypton to typify fission

gases, BRadickrypton was chosen because it is the first fission gas to emerge from a
-3 =

charcoal trap, Ten year krypton was used in this work so decay is negligible, Two
different purging pases, nitrogen and helium were used to sweep the radickrypton
through the trap. The trap was made from 2" schedule 40 stainless steel pipe and
was 13" long. It contained 3/4 1b of 8 to 1, mesh Columbia ACA Charcoal. Trap
temperatures were kept constant using freezing solutions of CaCly brine for the
-50°¢, and freezing solution of Freon 11 and 22 for the -110°C temperature, Liquid
nitrogen was used tc keep the material at its freezing point.

For each run the trap was filled with purge gas, the manifold was evacuated
and radiokrypton allowed te flow into the krypton chamber. The chamber was sealed
and the rest of the manifold evacuated. Carrier gas was then allowed to push the
radickrypton into the traps at constant flow rate of 5.0 rt per hr. The concentra
tion of radiokrypton in the effluent gas and therefore its partial pressure can be
determined by measuring the activity of the gas. The relative activity of the
effivent gas was measured as it passed through a small cell, ons wall of which was
the end window of a Geiger tube. The gas activity was registered on a log-counting
rate recorder.

Experimental Regults

Figures 2, 3, 4, 5 show the resulis obtained for nitrogen purge gas using one
trap, and using two identical traps in series, at # 16°C, £5°C, -51°C and -110%
respectively. In zach cass the aciivity injected was determined by integration of
the activity vs. tine curves, All were normalized to the same area under the curve.

It can be seen that for a given trap geometry the holdup times, i.e., time for activity
to break through, time for activity to peak, and time for last appearance of activity,
all increase with decreasing temperature. This can be predicted since the energy of

a gas molecule is less at low temperature and 1% cannot as readily desord from the

charcoal surface into the moving gas stream, The maximum concentration of radio-

krypton in effluent gas is lower for lower temperatures.
-t =

The effect of using two identical traps in series with nitrogen purge gas
is also shown on figures 2, 3, 4 and 5, These curves show that the time to peak
is approximately twice as long as for one trap and that the break-through time is
from twice as long to three times as long as for one trap. The time to the end of
the effluent activity is also increased and the maximum radiokrypton concentration
is about half as great.

Figure 6 shows two curves for helium purge gas at -5%C and -51%. The shape
of these curves is somewhat uncertain since their accuracy was limited by the
sensitivity of the flowmeter in its lower range when used with He. Several runs
were made at each temperature and the holdup times are significent even 1f the exact
shape of the curve may be in doubt. These curves show that radiokrypton is held up
for longer periods of time in the presence of flowing helium than in the presence of
flowing nitrogen. Since nitrogen is itself adsorbed In large amounts on charcoal,
the charcoal surface is not as frees to adsorb krypton. Helium will pass over char-
coal with very little adsorption, Hencs, krypton is retained on the charcoal for
longer periods of time in the presence of flowing helium, Maximum radiokrypton
concentrations are significantly lower for helium than for nitrogen.

Figures 7 and 8 show the same data as figures 2, 4, and 5 plotted together for
comparison. The time to reach maximum activity and the height and duration of the
peaks are clearly indicated as a function of temperature.

Analytical Theory

A theoretical analysis of the holdup process in charcoal traps is postulated,
making use of a number of theoretical charcoal~filled chambers, N, comnected in series,
occupying the total volume of the trap. This analysis is similar to the continuous
dilution tank problem in chemical engineering. It is assumed that as gas enters each
chamber it is instantly spread and brought to adsorption equilibrium throughout the

entire theoretical chamber, These conditions apply only to systems where dilution
bw

applicable to liquid chromatography and ion exchange where these processes are
slower, The rate of removal of radiokrypton in each chamber is first order with
respect to its partial pressure, and therefore to its concentration in that chamber,

i.€e;

N differential equations of this type for the N chambers are solved simultaneously.

km is a measure of the adsorptive capacity of the charcoal trap for radickrypton in the

In order te fit the expression to the experimental curves of activity vs. time,
experimental data were used from three points on each curve: time to reach maximum

partial pressure and the two times to reach a definite fraction of the maximum partial

pressure (1/10 or 1/2), The time ty to reach maximum partial pressure Pp, is

Equation (3) will give the maximum concentration of radiokrypton in the effluent gas,
and FP 1s the maximum rate of release of activity. Dividing equation (3) vy 10
(or 2) and using experimental values for tyax, © at 1/10 (or 1/2), P., and F,
equations (2) and (3) are solved simultaneously for N and for km. These values of N
and km are used in equation (1).
Analytical Results

Figures 2 through 5 show how closely the curves from the analytical expression
fit the experimental curves. The deviation is within experimental error, most of
which comes from counting statisties,

Figure 9 is a plot of parameters N and ln (km) as a function of temperature as
determined by fitting equation (1) to the data in figures 2 to 5. N has the same
value al all temperatures.

Figure 9 indicates that km and therefore k increases exponentially as 1/T
increases (decreasing temperature) since the curves are for constant charcoal mass m.
Analtyical Interpretation

In the analytical expression, equation (1), km and N determine the time to
maximum krypton concentration, and the narrowness of the peaks respectively. The
quantity (km) will determine the time to reach maximum partial pressure and therefore
concentration; regardless of trap geometry for a given trap volume. km is directly

proportional to trap volume (amount of chareoal) since the slope k of the linear

pressure and x = amount of gas adsorbed isothermally by m grams of adsorbent with
equilibrium pressure P).*

One would expect that for krypton on charcoal sathrated with helium the slope
ky will be greater than for krypton on charcoal saturated with nitrogen, because of
interference by adsorbed nitrogen, Therefore the holdup times for krypton with
helium purge gas should be greater than those for nitrogen as observed.

If km, the parameter in equation (1) which specifies holdup time, is the slope
of the linear isotherm, multiplied by the amount of charcoal, then the logarithm of
km plotted ageinst z should yield a straight line as shown in Fig. 9. The activation
energy caleulated from this curve is 3,0 k cal. for adsorption of krypton on
nitrogen-saturated charcoal, This straight line relationship indicates that the para-
meter k is proportional to the slope of the linear isotherm. Whether the proportion-
ality factor is unity has nob yet been determined. At a given temperature, km, for
two traps in series, is twice as large as for one trap. This should be true since k
is constant for a given temperature and m is doubled.

In Fig. 9 it appears that the number of theoretical chambers N is a character~
istic of the geometry of the charcoal trap since N does not vary for the different
temperatures studied. This should be true if the model used to derive the expression
for the curve has physical significance. For two traps in series, N is twice as large
ag for one trap, indicating that N may be a first order function of the length of the
trap divided by the diameter.

N is a function of trap geometry and does not effect the time to reach maximum

concentration. It does effect the shape of the concentration vs. time curve, and

therefore, the maximum concentration for a given amount of adsorbate. For small N, the
w 8 ow

curve will be flat and broad; for large N, the curve will be more sharply peaked.

For example:

Effluent
Krypton
Concentration

 

 

Pe Time

At a given trap temperature (or value of km), the breakthrough time and time to end
of pulse is influenced by N. This effect is shown clearly by comparing the various |
curves for one and for two traps, The time to reach maximum concentration is twice
as great for two traps in series as for one trap since km is twice as large. The
breakthrough time for twe traps is about four times as long as for one trap and the
time the last activity appeared is somewhat greater than twice as long.

If N is a function of trap geometry only, it appears that the function is the
length of trap divided by trap diameter. For nitrogen, N is constant. Since the data
for helium is somewhat in doubt because the flow rate was erratic, the value of N
obtained from these curves varles. Values of N for the helium purge gas runs varied
from 6 to 14. This is a fairly good indication that the N obtained is not greally
different from those obtained using nitrogen purge gas. A more complete study of N with

He must be made.
-9 =

Equation (3) is of particular interest since Ppax indicates the maximum concen-
tration of fission gases in the effluent gas and F ¢ Ppay is the maximum rate of
release of fission gases to the atmosphere. Both quantities are inversely propor-
tional to trap size, m, and to k. Since k is very sensitive to temperature, as
discussed above; it is more efficient to reduce F o Ppyyx by chilling the trap than
by using a larger trap, especially if trap size is important as when radiation shield
ing is required. F # Ppgx is smaller for small N as in short large diameter traps.
The flow rate, F, should be minimized to keep F o Ppuyy at a minimum.

For application to gas chromatography, both equations (2) and (3) must be
considered. To obtain maximum separation of different adsorbate gases the difference
between tyay for the different adsorbates should be as large as possible, However, to
gain sensitivity of detection Ppax should be large. These two conditions place opposite
requirements on k, the only parameter which is expected to depend on adsorbate gas.
Improved resolution can be obtained by using large N so that concentration peaks are
high and narrow, since tp,, is relatively insensitive to N while Pp,y depends strongly
on N. The long thin traps conventionally used in gas chromstography provide the large
N required for optimum design.

Conclugions

 

The expression of equation (1}, derived in a previous section can be used to
determine holdup times, maximum concentration, and the shape of the concentration curve
of a gas carried by an inert purge gas when values for N and k are known. A close
estimate of N may be obtained for the narrow range tested from the trap geometry using
N equal to length of trap divided by trap diameter. The slope of the linear isotherm

k mist be obtained for mixtures either from the literature or by experiment. If k at
two temperatures is known, then k at any other tempersture msy be obtained by plotting
In k ve. temperature as a straight line, With this information, an opiimized trap can

be designed for any purpose. If a low maximum effluent concentration of adsorbate is
- 10 =

needed, then N should be small and the trap temperature as low as possible, For a
given volume, a short wide diameter trap would be best, If a trap is needed which will
holdup the adsorbate gas for a relatively long time and then release the gas in a
short, high concentration peak as is done in gas chromatography, then a long, small
diameter trap is best, This geometry will mske N large, For a given volume of
charcoal, the time delay that is needed before the gas leaves the trap will determine
the trap temperature and therefore k, The choice of purge gas will also determine the
time delay of adsorbate in the trap. For long time delays, a purge ges that is not
itself adsorbed on charcoal to a great extent is better than a purge gas that has
appreciable adsorption.

This analysis makes it possible to predict the concentration as a function of
time of mixtures of gas flowing through charcoal traps.

Future Work

A study is in progress to determine if N is always a linear function of trap
length divided by trap diameter by studying traps of varying length to diameter ratio
with the same volume of charcoal used in the work presented in this report, These
traps will be purged with a variety of gases some of which are nitrogen, helium, argon
and air, Adsorbates used will be radiokrypton and radioxenocn. Exact amounts of adsor-
bate injected willl be measured,

Saturation effects of adsorbate on charcoal will be studied. This will be done
with a radioactive tracer of Kr mixed with inactive Kr to Increase the Kr partial
pressure many fold.

Studies will be made with varying trap geometry, temperature and gases and with
adsorbate continuously injected into the traps instead of a single short duration
injection. Saturation values and equilibrium concentration will be correlated. Pre-
diction of the results will be attempted using an extension of the theory presented in

this report.
- 11 =

Experimental measurements of isotherms will be made for gases in mixtures of
interest to determine whether the k determined in this study is indeed identical with

the adsorption isotherm,
