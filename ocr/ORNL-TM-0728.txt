PREFACE

The report on the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) has been
arranged into twelve major parts as shown in the General Index. Each
of these covers a particular phase of the project, such as the design,
safety analysis, operating procedures, etc. An attempt has thus been
made to avoid much of the duplication of material that would result if
separate and independent reports were prepared on each of these major
aspects.

Detailed references to supporting documents, working drawings,
and other information sources have been made throughout the report to
make it of maximum value to ORNL personnel. Each of the major divi-
sions of the report contains the bibliographical and other appendix
information necessary for that part.

The final volumes of the report, Part XII, contain the rather ex-
tensive listings of working drawings, specifications, schedules, tab-
bulations, etc. These have been given a more limited distribution.

Most of the reference material is available through the Division
of Technical Information Extension, Atomic Energy Commission, P. O.
Box 62, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. For material not available through this
source, such an inter-Iaboratory correspondence, etc., special arrange-
ments can be made for those having a particular interest.

None of the information contained in this report is of a classi-

fied nature.

ACKNOWLEDGMENT

The list of biographical references provides an indication of ORNL
personnel contributing most valuably to the MSRE literature, and thus
to this report.

Either directly, or indirectly, all of the forty to fifty engineers
and scientists in the Reactor Division assigned to the MSRE project
helped to prepare this material. Personnel in the Chemistry, Metallurgy,
Physics, Engineering and Maintenance, and Instrumentation and Controls
Divisions of the laboratory also made extensive contributions. In this
broad-based team effort it 1s impossible to single out individuals more

deserving to be mentioned here than others.

1. INTRODUCTION

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was undertaken by the
Oak Ridge National Laboratory to demonstrate that the desirable features
of the molten-salt concept could be embodied in a practical reactor that
could be constructed and maintained without undue difficulty and one that
could be operated safely and reliably. Additional important objectives
were to provide the first large-scale, long-term, high-temperature tests
in a reactor environment of the fuel salt, graphite, moderator, and high-
nickel-base alloy (INOR-8). Operating data from the MSRE should provide
important information regarding the feasibility of large-scale molten-
salt reactors.

Molten-salt reactors were first investigated as a means of providing
a compact high-temperature power plant for nuclear-powered aircraft. In
1954 an Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE) was constructed at ORNL which
demonstrated the nuclear feasibility of operating a molten-salt-fueled
reactor at high temperature. Fuel entered the ARE core at 1200°F and
left at 1500°F when the reactor power level was 2.5 Mw.

Immediately after the successful operation of the ARE, the Aircraft
Reactor Test (ART) was started at ORNL as part of the Aircraft Nuclear
Propulsion Program (ANP). This test was discontinued in 1957 when the
ANP Program was revised, but the high promise of the molten-salt reactor
type for achieving low electric power generating costs in central power
stations led ORNL to continue parts of the basic study programs. Features
of the molten-salt concept which deserve special mention with regard to
its future propects are: |

1. The fuel is fluid at reactor temperatures, thus eliminating the
extra costs associated with the fabrication, handling, and reprocessing
of solid fuel elements. . Burnup in the fuel is not limited by radiation
damage or reactivity loss. The fuel can be reprocessed continuously in
a side stream for removal of fission products, and new fissionable ma-

terial can be added while the reactor is in operation.

2. Molten-salt reactors can operate at high temperatures and pro- «
duce high-pressure superheated steam to achieve thermal efficiencies in
the heat-power cycle equal to the best fossil-fuel-fired plants. The
relatively low vapor pressure of the salt permits use of low pressure
containers and piping.
3. The negative temperature coefficient of the reactor and the
low excess reactivity are such that the nuclear safety is not primarily
dependent upon fast-acting control rods.
L, The fuel salt has a low cross section for the parasitic ab-
sorption of neutrons, and when used with bare graphite as the moderator, -
very good neutron economies can be achieved. Molten-salt reactors are |
thus attractive as highly efficient converters and breeders on the mm -F3%
cycle. $i
5. The fluoride salts used as the fluid fuel mixture have good
thermal and radiation stability and do not undergo violent chemical re-
actions with water or air. They are compatible with the graphite moder-
ator and can be contained satisfactorily in a specially developed high-
nickel alloy, INOR-8. The volumetric heat capacity, viscosity, thermal
conductivity, and other physical properties are also within desirable
ranges.
6. Use of relatively high circulation rates and temperature dif-
ferences results in high mean power density, high specific power, and
low fuel inventory. : «
These attractive features of the molten-salt reactor concept are
partially offset by the disadvantages that:
1. The fuel salt mixture melts at about 816°F, so means must be ¥
provided for maintaining all salt-containing portions of the system
above this temperature.
2. The fluoride salts react with oxygen to precipitate fuel con-
stituents as oxides. Although zirconium tetrafluoride is included in
the salt mixture so that Zr0, will precipitate in preference to Uo, care
must be taken to prevent the fuel from being contaminated with air, water,
or other oxygen-containing materials.
3. The radioactivity in any fluid-fuel system is in s mobile form, oO

and special provisions must be taken for containment and maintenance. -

 
1

 

During the period 1957-60, investigations were carried out at ORNL
on the fuel salt chemistry, metallurgy of containment meterials, the de-
sign of salt-circulating pumps, and on remote maintenance techniques. The
results of this work lent additional encouragement, and in 1959 studies
were made by H. G. MacPherson® and L. G. Alexsnder et al.?, pertaining
to the applicability of the molten-salt concept to central power station
reactors. The studies resulted in a proposald to the AEC for construction
of a molten-salt experiment to investigate remaining areas of uncertainty
that could be resolved only by actually building and operating a molten-
salt reactor. In April, 1961, ORNL received a directive’ from the AEC to
design, construct, and operate the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE),
the subject of this report.

Barly in the design phases it was decided that the MSRE was to have
as its primary purpose the investigation of the practicality. of the molten-
salt concept for central power station applications. As such, the MSRE
was envisioned as a straightforward-type of installation, uncomplicated
by the inclusion of experimental apparatus which might jeopardize reliable,
long-term operation. It was also necessary that the MSRE be of a large-
enough capacity for the experimental findings to be meaningfully extrapo-
lated to the full-scale plants. It was decided that a reactor of 10 Mw
thermal output would satisfy the criterion.

Conversion of the 10 Mw of heat to useful electricity was not con-
sidered to be necessary to demonstrate the concept, so existing blowers
and stack were used to dissipate the heat to the atmosphere. Containment
requirements dictated a ‘double barrier between the highly radicactive fuel
salt and the environment, and a salt very similar to the fuel salt in com-
position and physical properties was chosen to transport the heat from the
fuel salt to air-cooled surfaces.

An expanded plant layout was adopted in order to provide access to

equipment and to facilitate maintenance operations, The MSRE was instelled

in an existing building in the 7503 Area at ORNL that was constructed spe-
cifically for the ARE and ART. This arrangement provided some savings and
expedited construction in that the building included a containment vessel

vhich, with modification, was suitable for the MSRE. A significant amount
of usable auxiliary equipment was also on hand, including air blowers and

 
a stack for dissipation of heat to the atmosphere, emergency diesel-
electric power supply, heavy-duty cranes, etc. Shop, office, washroom,
and control room spaces were also available, and some of the heavy con-
crete shielding was adaptable to the MSRE. Fitting the MSRE design to
the existing facilities required numerous design compromises, but no ex-
treme difficulties were encountered.

Construction of the MSRE officially started in July, 1961, although
much of the advance thinking and preliminary design work were well under
way by that time. Major building modifications were started in 1961 and
were completed by the end of 1962. Iack of funds and late delivery of
the graphite moderator delayed installation of major equipment until early
1964. The installation was scheduled for completion in the early summer
of 1964, and the target date to achieve criticality was set for the end
of that year.

 
2. GENERAL DESCRIPTION

2.1 Type

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is a single-region, un-
clad, graphite-moderated, fluid-fuel type of reactor with a design heat
generation rate of 10 Mw. The circulating fuel is a mixture of lithium,
beryllium, and zirconium fluoride salts that contains uranium or thorium
and uranium fluorides. Reactor heat is transferred from the fuel salt

to a similar coolant salt and is then dissipated to the atmosphere.
2.2. location

The Experiment is located in the 7503 Area of the Oak Ridge
National laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The site is about one-half
mile south of the main Iaboratory buildings, in a wooded, secluded bend

of the Clinch River that is reserved for special reactor installations.
2.3 Fuel and Coolant Salts

The composition and physical properties of various fuel and coolant
salts are given in Table 2.1. Favorable neutron absorption and chemical
and physical properties were important requirements for the compositions
selected. Beryllium fluoride is used to obtain a low melting point.
Lithium fluoride (99.99% il in both fuel and coolant salts) imparts
good fluid flow properties to the mixture. Zirconium fluoride protects
the fuel salt against precipitation of uo, from contamination by air and
moisture. Fuel salts containing throium are of interest for future large-
scale thorium breeder reactors. The first experiments in the MSRE will
be run with partially enriched uranium because there are fewer uncer-
tainties concerning the chemical behavior of that fuel. Iater the
reactor will be operated with the highly enriched uranium fuel and then

with the thorium-uranium fuel.

2.4 Equipment and Process

The major items of equipment in the MSRE are shown on a simplified
flowsheet in Fig. 2.1. The fuel-salt-circulating system is the reactor
primary system. It consists of the reactor vessel where the nuclear
heat is generated, the fuel heat exchanger in which heat is transferred
from fuel to coolant, the fuel circulating pump, and the interconnect-
ing piping. The coolant system is the reactor secondary system. It
consists of the coolant pump, a radiator in which heat is transferred
from coolant salt to air, and the piping between the pump, the radiator,
and the fuel heat exchanger. There are also drain-tank systems for con-
taining the fuel and coolant salts when the circulating systems are not

in operation.

2.4.1 Reactor

The reactor vessel is a 5-ft-diam by 8-ft-high tank that contains
a 55-in.-diam by 6k-in.-high graphite core structure. A cutaway draw-
ing of the reactor is shown in Fig. 2.2. Under design conditions of
10 Mw of reactor heat, the fuel salt enters the flow distributor at the
top of the vessel at 1175°F and 20 psig. The fuel is distributed evenly
around the circumference of the vessel and then flows turbulently down-
ward in a spiral path through a l-in. annulus between the vessel wall
and the core can. The wall of the vessel is thus cooled to within about
50F of the bulk temperature of the entering salt. The salt loses its
rotational motion in the straightening vanes in the lower plenum and
turns and flows upward through the graphite matrix in the core can.

The graphite matrix is an assembly of vertical bars, 2 in. by 2
in. by about 67 in. long. Fissioning of 23% in the fuel occurs as it
flows in O.4-in. by 1.2-in. channels that are formed by grooves in the

sides of the bars. There are about 1140 of these passages.
The nominal core volume within the 55-in.-diam by 64-in.-high core

structure is 90 £3, of which 20 £3 is fuel and TO £63 is graphite.
At 10 Mw, and with no fuel absorbed by the graphite, 1.4 Mw of heat is
generated in the fuel outside the nominal core, 0.6 Mw is generated in

the graphite, and 8.0 Mw is generated in the fuel within the core. This

corresponds to an average fuel power density of 1k kw/liter in the nominal o
core. The maximum fuel power density is 31 kw/liter.

Flow in the coolant channels is laminar, but both the graphite and
the fuel have good thermal conductivities, so the maximum temperature of
the graphite is only about 60°F above the mixed mean temperature of the
adjacent fuel. The nuclear average and the maximum temperatures, respec-
tively, of the graphite are estimated to be about 1255°F and 1300°F. The
temperature of the fuel leaving the hottest channel in the core is about
1260°F.

Fuel leaves the top of the reactor at 1225°F and 7 psig through the
side outlet of a special fitting designed as an access port for insertion
of graphite and metal samples and for three 2-in.-diam control rod thimbles.
The poison elements in the control rods are short hollow cylinders of
gadolinium oxide 1 in. in diameter, clad with Inconel and arranged on a
flexible Inconel hose to permit passage through two bends that form an
offset in each thimble. The control rods and drives are cooled by circu-
lation of cell atmosphere through the flexible hoses and thimbles.

A 1-1/2-in.-diam outlet line is provided at the bottom of the reactor

vessel for discharging salt to the drain tanks.

2.4..2 Fuel Pump
The fuel salt from the reactor flows directly to the centrifugal

sump-type pump shown in Fig. 2.3. The pump has a vertical shaft and
overhung impeller and operates at a speed of 1160 rpm to deliver 1200
gpm at a discharge head of 49 ft. The pump bowl is about 36 in. in di-
amter, and the pump and 75-hp motor assembly is about 8 ft high.

Devices are provided in the pump bowl to measure the liquid level
as a means of determining the inventory of salt in the system. Small
capsules can be lowered into the bowl to take a 10-g sample of salt for
analysis or to add 120 g of fuel to the system. About 65 gpm of the
pump output is circulated internally to the pump bowl for release of en-
trained or dissolved gases from the salt.

Helium flows through the gas space in the bowl at a rate of about
200 £t3 [day (STP) to sweep the highly radioactive xenon and krypton to
the off-gas disposal system. The helium also acts as a cover gas to ex-

~

clude air and water vapor.

The pump is equipped with ball bearings that are lubricated and w
cooled with oil circulated by an external pumping system. The oil is
confined to the bearing housing by mechanical shaft seals. A helium
purge enters below the lower seal. A small part of this helium flows up-
ward along the shaft and leaves just below the lower seal, carrying with
it any oil vapors that leak through the seal. The remainder flows down-
ward along the shaft to the pump bowl and subsequently to the off-gas
system. This prevents radioactive gases from reaching the oil.

Cooling oil is also circulated through a metal block above the
pump bowl which shields the lubricating oil and the pump motor.

The motor and the bearing shaft and impeller assembly are remova-
ble separately to facilitate maintenance.

An overflow tank of 5.5-Ft

provide sufficient volume for free expansion of salt under all foreseen

volume is installed below the pump to

conditions.

2.4.3 Heat Exchanger

Salt discharged by the fuel pump flows through the shell side of
the horizontal shell-snd-tube heat exchanger shown in Fig. 2.4, where
it is cooled from 1225°F to 1175°F. The exchanger is about 16 in. in
diameter and 8 ft long and contains one hundred sixty-three 1/2-in.-0D
U-tubes with an effective surface of 259 £2. The coolant salt circu-
lates through the tubes at a rate of 850 gpm, entering at 1025°F and

leaving at 1100°F.

2.4.4 Coolant Pump

The coolant salt is circulated by a centrifugal pump identical in
most respects to the fuel pump. The pump has a T75-hp, 1750-rpm motor
and delivers 850 gpm against a head of 78 ft.

2.4.5 Radiator
The radiator is shown in Fig. 2.5. Seven hundred square feet of
cooling surface is provided by 120 tubes 0.75 in. in diameter by 30 ft
long. Cooling air is supplied to the radiator by two 250-hp axial
blowers with a combined capacity of 200,000 cfm. Salt enters the radi-
ator at 1100°F and leaves at 1025°F. The temperature rise of the air -
is 200°F at design power. To guard against freezing the salt in the < .

radiator tubes on sudden reduction of reactor power, quick-closing doors
are provided to shut off the air flow, and the radiator is heated by
electrical heaters inside the enclosure. The opening of the doors can
be adjusted, and some of the air can be bypassed around the radiator to

regulate the heat removal rate.

2.4.6 Drain Tank Systems

Four tanks are provided for safe storage of the salt mixtures when
they are not in use in the fuel- and coolant-salt circulating systems.
Two fuel-salt drain tanks and a flush-salt tank are connected to the
reactor by means of the fill and drain line. One drain tank is provided
for the coolant salt.

A fuel drain tank is shown in Fig. 2.6. The tank is 50 in. in
diameter by 86 in. high and has a volume of about 80 £3, sufficient
to hold in a non-critical geometry all the salt that can be contained
in the fuel circulating system. The tank is provided with a cooling
system capable of removing 100 kw of fission-product decay heat, the
cooling being accomplished by boiling water in 32 bayonet tubes that
are inserted in thimbles in the tank.

The flush-salt tank is similar to the fuel-salt tank except that
it has no thimbles or cooling system. New flush salt is like fuel salt
but without fissile or fertile material. It is used to wash the fuel
circulating system before fuel is added and after fuel is drained, and
the only decay heating is by the small quantity of fission products that
it removes from the equipment.

The coolant-salt tank resembles the flush-salt tank, but it is
40 in. in diameter by 78 in. high and the volume is 50 £3,

The tanks are provided with devices to indicate high and low
liquid levels and with weigh cells to indicate the weight of the tanks

and their contents.

2.4.7 Piping and Flanges

The major components in the salt circulating systems are inter-
connected by 5-in. sched-4O piping. Flanged joints between units in
the primary system facilitate removal and replacement of components by

remotely operated tools. These flanges, called freeze flanges, utilize

a frozen salt seal between the flange faces as well as a conventional
O-ring-type joint to form a helium-buffered, leak-detected type of
closure.

The fill and drain lines are 1-1/2-in. sched-4O piping and contain
the only "valves" that come in contact with salt. The valves, called
freeze valves, have no moving parts, ummodulated flow control being
achieved by freezing or thawing salt in a short, partially flattened

section of pipe that can be heated and cooled.

2.4.8 Heaters

“All parts of the salt-containing systems are heated electrically
to maintain the salts above the liquidus temperature of 840 to 850°F.
The equipment is preheated before salt is added and the heaters are
energized continuously during reactor operation to make sure that there
is no uncontrolled freezing in any of the piping and that the salt can
be drained when necessary. The total capacity of the heaters is about
1930 kw, but the actual power consumption is somewhat less than half
of this. About 300 kw of heat can be provided by the diesel electric

emergency power supply.

2.4.9 Materials

The salt-containing piping and equipment are made of INOR--a
special high-nickel and molybdenum. alloy having a good resistance to
attack by fuel and coolant salts at temperatures at least as high as
1500°F. The mechanical properties are superior to those of many austen-
itic stainless steels, and the alloy is weldable by established pro-
cedures. The chemical composition and some of the physical properties
are given in Table 2.2. Most of the INOR equipment was designed for
1300°F and 50 psig, with an allowable stress of 2750 psi,

- Stainless steel piping and valves were used in the helium supply
end in the off-gas systems. |
2.4.10 Cover- and Off-Gas Systems

A helium cover-gas system protects the oxygen-sensitive fuel from
contact with air or moisture. Commerical helium is suppled in a tank
truck and is passed through a purification system to reduce the oxygen

and water content below 1 ppm before it is admitted to the reactor.

systems. A flow of 200 £t°/day (STP) is passed continuously through the
fuel pump bowl to transport the fission product gases to activated charcoal
adsorber beds. The radioactive xenon is retained on the charcoal for a
minimum of 90 days, and the krypton for 7-1/2 days, which is sufficient
for all but the 8 8
tained well within tolerance, the effluent gas being diluted with 21,000

Kr to decay to insignificant levels. The “Kr is main-
cfm of air, filtered, monitored, and dispersed from a 3-ft-diam by 100-ft
steel-containment ventilation stack.

The cover-gas system is also used to pressurize the drain tanks to
move molten salts into the fuel and coolant circulating systems. Gas
from these operations is passed through charcoal beds and filters before

it is discharged through the off-gas stack.

2.4.11 Instrumentation and Control Systems

 

Nuclear and process control are both important to the operation of
the MSRE. The reactor has a negative temperature coefficient of 6.4 to
9.9 x 107° (0k/x)/°F, depending on the type of fuel that is being used.
The excess reactivity requirements are listed in Table 2.3, and they

are not expected to exceed U4 x 1072 ONk/k at the normal operating temper-

. ature. The three control rods have a combined worth of 5.6 to 7.6 % Ak/k,

depending upon the fuel composition. Their major functions are to elimi-
nate the wide temperature variations that would otherwise accompany
changes in power and xenon poison level and to make it possible to hold
the reactor subcritical to a temperature 200 to 300°F below the normal

operating temperature. They have some safety functions, most of which

are concerned with the startup of the reactor. Rapid action is not re-

quired of the control rods; however, a magnetic clutch is provided in
the drive train to permit the rods to drop into the thimbles with an ac-
celeration of 0.5 g as a convenient way of providing insertion rates
that are more rapid than the removal rates. Burnup and growth of long-
lived fission product poisons is compensated by adding fuel through the

sampler enricher. Complete shutdown of the reactor is accomplished by

“draining the fuel.

When the reactor is operated at power levels above a few hundred

kilowatts, the power is controlled by regulating the air flow, and

thereby the rate of heat removal, at the radiator. The power level is
determined by measuring the flow rate and temperature difference in the
coolant salt system. . The control rods operate to hold the fuel outlet
temperature from the reactor constant, and the inlet temperature is per-
mitted to vary with power level. At low power the control rods operate
to hold the neutron flux constant, and the heat withdrawal at the radi-
ator or the input to the heaters on piping and equipment is adjusted to
keep the temperature within a specified range.

. Preventing the salts from freezing, except at freeze flanges and
valves, and protecting the equipment from overheating, are among the
most important control functions. Over one thousand thermocouples are
installed throughout the fuel and coolant salt systems, and about three-
fourths of these serve indication, alarm, or control functions. The
heating and cooling equipment is controlled to maintain temperatures
(throughout the systems) within specified ranges.

Digital computer and data handling equipment are included in the
instrumentation. to provide rapid compilation and analysis of the process
data. This equipment has no control function but gives current infor-

mation about all important variables and warns of abnormal conditions.

2.5 Fuel Processing

Batches of fuel or flush salt which have been removed from the
reactor circulating system can be processed in separate equipment to per-
mit their reuse or to recover the uranium.

~~ Salts that have been contaminated with oxygen to the saturation point
(about 80 ppm of 0p), and thus tend to precipitate the fuel constituents
as oxides, can be treated with a hydrogen-hydrogen fluoride gas mixture to
remove the oxygen as water vapor. These salts can then be reused.

A salt batch unacceptably contaminated with fission products, or one
in which it is. desirable to drastically change the uranium content, can
be treated with fluorine gas to separate the uranium from the carrier
salt by volatilization of UFg. In some instances the carrier salt will
be discarded; in others uranium of a different enrichment, thorium, or

other constituents will be added to give the desired composition.

 
 

 

24

The processing system consists of a salt storage and processing 4

tank, supply tanks for the Hy»

ature (750°F) sodium fluoride adsorber for decontaminating the UF,

HF, and Fo treating gases, a high temper-

several low-temperature portable adsorbers for UF, a caustic scrubber,
and associated piping and instrumentation. All except the UF¢ adsorbers
are located in the fuel processing cell below the operating floor of
Bldg. 7503, as shown in Fig. 4.4. :

After the uranium has been transferred to the UF adsorbers, they
are transported to the ORNL Volatility Pilot Plant at X-10, where the
UF is transferred to product cylinders for return to the-4KC production

plants.
2.6 Plant Arrangement

The general arrangement of Building 7503 is shown in Fig. 4.3. The
main entrance is at the north end. Reactor equipment and major auxil-
iary facilities occupy the west half of the building in the high-bay
area. The east half of the building contains the control room, offices,
change rooms, instrument end general maintenance shops, and storage
areas. Additional offices are provided in a separate building to the
east of the main building.
Equipment for ventilating the operating and experimental areas is
located south of the main building. A small cooling tower and smsll »
buildings to house stores and the diesel-electric emergency power equip-
ment are located west of the main building.
The reactor primary system and the drain tank system are installed
in shielded, pressure-tight reactor and drain tank cells, which occupy
most of the south half of the high-bay area. These cells are connected
by an open 3-ft-diam duct and are thus both constructed to withstand
the same design pressure of 40 psig, with a leakage rate of less than
1 vol % per day. A vapor-condensing system, buried in the ground south
of the building, is provided to keep the pressure below 40 psig during
the maximum credible accident by condensing the steam in vapors that
are discharged from the reactor cell. When the reactor is operating, | O

the reactor and drain tank cells are sealed, purged with nitrogen to ~

 
 

25

obtein an atmusphere that is less than 5% oxygen, and maintained at about
2 psi below atmospheric pressure.

The reactor cell is a carbon steel containment vessel 24 ft in di-
ameter and 33 ft in overall height. The top is flat and consists of two
layers of removable concrete plugs and beams, for a total thickness of
7 ft. A thin stainless steel membrane is installed between the two layers
of plugs and welded to the wall of the steel vessel to provide a tight seal
during operation.

The reactor cell vessel is located within a 30-ft-diam steel tank.
The annular space is filled with a magnetite sand and weter mixture,
and there is a minimum of 2 ft of concrete shielding around the outer
tenk. In addition to this shielding the reactor vessel is surrounded
by a 14-in.-thick steel-and-water thermal shield.

The drain tank cell adjoins the reactor cell on the north. It is
a 17-1/2-ft by 21-1/2-ft by 29-ft-high rectangular tank made of rein-
forced concrete and lined with stainless steel. The roof structure, in-
cluding the membrane, is similar to that of the reactor cell.

The coolant cell abuts the reactor cell on the south. It is a

‘shielded area with controlled ventilation but is not sealed.

The blowers that supply cooling air to the radiator are installed
in an existing blower house along the west wall of the coolant cell.

Rooms containing auxiliary and service equipment, instrument trans-
mitters, and electrical equipment are located along the east wall of the
reactor, drain tank and coolant cells. Ventilation of these rooms is
controlled, and some are provided with shielding.

The north half of the building contains several small shielded cells
in which the ventilation is controlled, but which are not gas-tight.
These cells are used for storing and processing the fuel, handling and
storing liquid wastes, and storing and decontaminating reactor equip-
ment.

The high-bay area of the building over the cells mentioned sbove is
lined with metal, has all but the smaller openings sealed, and is pro-
vided with air locks. Ventilation is controlled and the area is normally

operated at slightly below atmospheric pressure. The effluent air from

 
26

this area and from all other controlled-ventilation areas is filtered,
and monitored before it is discharged to the atmosphere. The contain-
ment ventilation equipment consists of a filter pit, two fans, and a
100-ft-high fuel stack. They are located south of the main building

and are connected to it by a ventilation duct to the bottom of the re-

-actor cell and another along the east side of the high bay.

The vent house and charcoal beds for handling the gaseous fission
products from the reactor systems are near the southwest corner of the
main building. The carbon beds are installed in an existing pit that
is filled with water and covered with concrete slabs. The vent house
and pit are also controlled-ventilation areas. Gases from the carbon
beds are discharged into the ventilation system upstream of the filter.

Maintenance of equipment in the fuel circulating and drain tank
systems will be by removal of one or more of the concrete roof plugs
and use of remote handling and viewing equipment. A heavily shielded
maintenance control room with viewing windows is located above the
operating floor for operation of the cranes and other remotely con=-
trolled equipment. This room will be used primarily when a large num-
ber of the roof plugs are removed and a piece of highly radioactive
equipment is to be transferred to a storage cell.

Equipment in the coolant cell cannot be approached when the rer
actor is operating, but since the induced activity in the coolant salts
is short lived, the coolant cell can be entered for direct maintenance

shortly after reactor shutdown.

3. SITE

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment is located in Melton Valley about
one-half mile southeast of the main X-10 area of the Oak Ridge National
Laboratory, Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The site can be approached from either
the northeast or southwest on the asphalt-surfaced 7500 Road. A location
map is shown in Fig. 3.1.

It may be noted that in the plot plan, Fig. 3.2, and on all con-
struction drawings, that the long axis of the building has been taken as
the reference, or plant, north. The true north lies about 30° east of
this .*

The brief descriptive remarks made here regarding the MSRE site are
sufficient only to outline some of the factors influencing design of the
experiment. The meteorology, climatology, geology, hydrology, seismology,
and the general suitability of the location from a safety standpoint are
discussed in detail in the Barty Analysis Report, Part V, of this report.

57s

The location is a safe one for construction of reactor equipment, as
is evidenced by the several other reactors installed in the area and the
fact that the ARE and the 60-Mw(thermal) ART experiments were approved
for the same site.

The terrain consists of wooded hills and valleys. The elevation of
the MSRE site is about 850 ft above sea level. Haw Ridge, which lies
between the MSRE and the main X-10 area, has an average elevation along
the top of about 980 ft. The Clinch River (Melton Hill Reservoir) lies
two or more miles to the east and south and marks the boundary of the
ORNL reservation. The eight or ten square miles included in this bend
of the river are also occupied by six other ORNL reactor installations.
These are, in most instances, separated from each other by intervening
hills and distances of one-half mile or more. The installations include

the Tower Shielding Facility, the Health Physics Research Reactor (HPRR),

 

*In most instances this report gives compass directions only to in-
dicate a general relationship, and the distinction between plant north
and true north is not important. In general, unless otherwise stated,
the directions given are referred to plant north. Should the reader
have need for exact compass bearings, care should be taken to identify
the north used in a particular reference or drawing.

the High-Flux Isotope Reactor (HFIR), and the associated Trans-Uranium FT

Facility (TRUF), the Experimental Gas-Cooled Reactor (EGCR), and the now “ .

dismantled Homogeneous Reactor Experiment (HRE-2, or HRT).
The direction of the prevailing wind is from the southwest, but

close to the ground in Melton Valley during the night, or in stable con-

ditions, the wind tends to be from the northeast regardless of the di-

rection of the gradient wind. Very strong winds aloft, however, do con-

trol the direction and velocity of the valley wind. A frequently en-

countered condition is for up-valley light air movement from the south-

west during the day followed by a down-valley movement at night .”?10
The soil is largely Conasauga shale, and there are no persistent

limestone beds in the area to cause rapid movement of underground water

through solution channels or caverns. The shale is relatively imper-

meable to water, and such ground flow as might exist is probably limited a

to a few feet per week. Surface water has a natural drainage to the

south into a small spring-fed tributary of Melton Branch, which in turn,

empties into Whiteoak Creek.” 10
Only one or two very slight earthquakes occur per year in the

Tennessee Valley, and it has been judged highly improbable that a major

shock will occur in the Oak Ridge area for several thousand years.’ 10
The MSRE is supplied with potable water from the X-10 distribution

system. The source of the water is the Clinch River. After treatment

the water is stored in a T-million-gal reservoir located near the Y-12

Plant. This supply serves the main laboratory complex and also furnishes -

water to a 16-in. line which makes a complete loop to the south of X-10

to supply the several reactor sites, as shown in Fig. 3.3.* Two 1.5-

million-gal tanks, with maximum water level of 1055 ft elevation, are *

located at the top of Haw Ridge as part of this loop system. The MSRE

normally receives water through a 12-in. main laid along 7500 Road to

the east of the MSRE reactor Building 7503 and joining the 16-in. loop

where it crosses the road. An existing 6-in. line along the same road

to the west of Bldg. 7503 serves as an alternative supply line. The
total available capacity probably exceeds 4000 gpm. Building services

and the fire protection system draw directly from the potable supply.
Process water also comes from the same supply, but a backflow preventer
is installed in the process water line to protect the potable water
system.

The MSRE is supplied with electric power from the 154-kv TVA system
through a substation located just north of the main X-10 area, as shown
in Fig. 3.4. The 13.8-kv transmission line from the substation to the
MSRE (ORNL Circuit 234) skirts the western side of X-10 along First
Street. A 13.8-kv feeder line from another 154 to 13.8-kv transformer
at the same substation (ORNL Circuit 294) passes to the east of X-10
to supply the HFIR area. This line passes close to the MSRE, and the
two circuits are connected together through automatic transfer switches
on poles at the MSRE so that each can serve as an alternative to the
other. The MSRE is normally supplied through Circuit 234.

The 13.8-kv, 3-phase, 60-cycle input to the MSRE serves process
equipment through a new 1500-kva, 13.8 kv to 480 v, transformer located
on the west side of Bldg. 7503. An existing bank of three 250-kva,

13.8 kv to 480 v, transformers on the east side of the building supplies
the building lighting, air conditioning, and other general purpose loads.

Diesel-driven generators serve as an additional source of emergency
power. These were originally installed for the ARE and the ART. There
are two 1200-rpm engine-generator sets of 300-kw capacity and one set
with a generator name-plate rating of 1200-kw but having a continuous
duty, limited by the size of the diesel engine, of 300 kw. The total
emergency generating capacity for the MSRE is thus 900 kw. These units,
together with the air compressors and compressed air tanks used for
starting the large engine and the batteries for starting the two smaller
units are housed in a generator house just west of Bldg. 7503.

Saturated steam at about 250 psig is supplied to the MSRE through a
6-in. main from the X-10 power plant as shown in Fig. 3.5. There is no
condensate return. The chief uses for the steam are building heat and
a few distillation processes.

Sanitary disposal facilities consist of a septic tank and a drain-

age field west of the building.

4. PLANT

4.1 General

General views of Bldg. 750% are shown in Figs. 4.1 and 4.2.

Since some of the building spaces serve no functions which are
clearly related to the requirements of the MSRE, attention is again
called to the fact that the 7503 Area was originally constructed for
the ARE and later modified for the ART. It was not occupied between
cancellation of the ART in 1957 and the present usage. Although some
accommodations in the MSRE design were necessary to fit the experiment
into the existing structures, considerable savings in time and expense
were gained by thelr use.

Office, control room, shop and washroom spaces could be used almost
without change, and the heat rejection equipment, which included axial
blowers, ducting and stack, were a valuable asset. The existing con-
tainment vessel height was increased by about 8-1/2 ft, and the shield-
ing walls, roof plugs, cell wall penetrations, supports, and other
structural features were extensively modified. Considerable excavation
was needed within the high bay to make room for the drain tank cell.

In modifying the existing buildings for the MSRE, the areas were
divided into five classifications (see Ref. 11 for detailed description):

Class I. These areas have high radiation levels at all times
once the reactor has operated at power and highly radioactive fuel or
wastes have been handled in the equipment. They include the reactor
cell, drain tank cell, fuel processing cell, liquid waste cell, charcoal
bed pit, etc. The equipment in these areas must withstand relatively
high radiation levels and in most cases must be maintained by remote
maintenance methods. Direct maintenance will be possible in the fuel
processing and liquid waste cells, but the equipment mst first be
decontaminated. |

Class II. Areas in this classification are not accessible when
fuel salt is in the primary circulating system but can be entered with-
in a short time after the salt has been drained. The coolant salt area,
which includes the radiator, coolant pump, and coolant-salt drain tank,

are in this category. The west tunnel and the unshielded areas of the

blower house are other examples. Equipment in these areas can be re-
paired by direct approach.

Class III. These are areas that are accessible during periods of
low-power operation of the reactor, such as the special equipment room
and south electric service area, but cannot be entered if the power is
above 1 Mw. The equipment in these areas can be inspected and repaired
without draining the reactor.

Class IV. These are areas that are accessible or habitable at all
times except under the conditions described in Class V, below. These
areas include office spaces, control rooms, etc.

Class V. The maintenance control room will be the only habitable
areas during maintenance operations when large, radioactive components
are being removed from the reactor cell. The rest of the MSRE site
must be evacuated. This shielded room contains remote control units

for the cranes and TV cameras.

4.2 Offices
Offices for the operational personnel are located in Bldg. T7503
(see Section 4.3). Administrative and supporting personnel are located
in Bldg. 7509, which adjoins Bldg. T7503 on the east side. Bldg. 7509
is a new one-story, 43-ft x 87-ft concrete-block building equipped with
central air conditioning. The main entrance for visitors to the MSRE

is at the east end of this building.

4.3 Building

Above grade, Building T7503 is constructed of steel framing and
asbestos cement type of corrugated siding with a sheet metal interior
finish. Reinforced concrete is used in almost all cases below the
850-ft elevation.

Floor plans at the 852- and 840-ft levels are shown in Figs. 4.3
and 4.4, The general location of equipment is also shown in Fig. 4.3.
An elevation view is shown in Fig. 4.5.

The west half of the building above the 852-ft elevation is about
42 ft wide, 157 ft long, and 33 ft high. This high, or crane, bay area
houses the reactor cell, drain tank cell, coolant salt penthouse, and

most of the auxiliary cells (see Section 4.3.9).

The eastern half of the building above the 852-ft elevation is 38
ft wide, 157 ft long, and about 12 ft high. Offices for operational
personnel are located along the east wall of the north end. The main
control room, auxiliary control room, and a room used for the logger,
computer, and for the shift supervisor on duty are located across the
hall on the western side. The large hall provides ample space for an
observation gallery. Windows behind the control panel enable the
operating personnel to view the top of the reactor cell and other
operating areas of the high bay. The change rooms are located near
the center of the building. The southeastern corner is used for an
instrument shop, instrument stores and offices for instrument depart-
ment supervisory personnel.

Most of the western half of the building at the 840 level is
occupied by the reactor cell, drain tank cell, and auxiliary cells.
The emergency nitrogen-cylinder station is located against the west
wall in the northwest corner of this level. Switch boxes used in the
heater circuits are located across the aisle between columns A and C

(see Fig. 4.3). Behind these switch boxes is an 8-ft x L0-1/2-ft pit

with a floor elevation of 831-1/2 ft. This pit contains heater circuit

induction regulators with some heater transformers mounted above. It
is accessible from the 8L4L0-ft level by stairs located at the east end.
Additional induction regulators and rheostats are located at column
line C between columns 2 and 3.

The heater control panels and thermocouple scanner panels are
located along column line C between columns 3 and 4.

The batteries for the L48- and 250-volt DC emergency power supply

are in an 18-ft x 18-ft battery room in the northeast corner. The motor

generators and control panels for the 48-v system are in an area west
of the battery room. The main valves and controls for the fire pro-
tection sprinkler system are installed along the north wall.

A maintenance shop area is provided between columns 2 and 4. The
process water backflow preventer is installed on the east wall between
columns 2 and 3.

The area between column lines 4 and 6 houses the main lighting

breakers, switch boxes and transformers, the intercom control panel,

ow

.
 

a

water heater and air conditioners for the main control room and
transmitter room, as well as a lunch room and meeting room for main-
tenance personnel. The transmitter room located between column lines
5 and 6 is described in Section 4.3.7.

The service room, a 16-ft by 27-ft room, located at the northeast
corner of the 84O-ft level, serves as a small chemistry laboratory and
access to the service tunnel (Section 4.3.6). The instrument panels
for the fuel and coolant lube oil systems are located in this area.
4.3.1 Reactor Cell

The reactor cell, shown in Fig. 4.5, is a cylindrical carbon steel
vessel 24 ft in diameter and 33 ft in overall height (extending from the
819 to 852-ft elevation), with a hemispherical bottom and a flat top.
The lower 24-1/2 ft (819 to 843-1/2-ft elevation) was built for the ART
in 1956. It was designed for 195 psig at 565°F and was tested hydro-
statically at 300 psig. ? The hemispherical bottom is 1 to 1-1/k in.
thick. The cylindrical portion is 2 in. thick except for the section
that contains the large penetrations, where it is 4 in. thick.

This vessel was modified for the MSRE in 1962 by lenghtening the
cylindrical section 8-1/2 ft (843-1/2 to 852-ft elevation). Several
new penetrations were installed, and a 12-in. section of 8-in. sched-80
pipe closed by a pipe cap was welded into the bottom of the vessel to
form a sump. The extension to the vessel was 2 in. thick except for the
top section, which was made as a T-1/4-in. by lh-in. flange for bolting
the top shield beams in place. The flange and top shield structure
were designed for 40 psig, measured at the top of the cell. Both the
original vessel and the extension were made of ASTM A201, Grade B, fire-
box quality steel. Material for the extension was purchased to speci-
fication ASTM A300 to obtain steel with good impact properties at low
temperature. Steel for the original vessel was purchased to specifi-
cation ASTM A201.

~All the welds on the reactor cell vessel were inspected by mag-
netic particle methods if they were in carbon steel, or by liquid
penetrant methods if they were in stainless steel. All butt welds and
penetration welds were radiographed. After all the welding was completed,
the vessel was stress relieved by heating to 1150 to 1200°F for 7-1/2 hr.

 
 

 

hy

Calculated stresses in the vessel were well below those

permitted by ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Case 1721-3, (49)
Allowable stresses for ASTM A-201 Grade B steel were taken as

16,500 psi for general membrane stresses, 24,750 for general membrane
plus general bending plus local membrane stresses, and 45,000 psi

for combined primary and secondary stresses. (13)

The top of the cell is constructed of two layers of 3-1/2-ftwthick,
reinforced concrete blocks, with a stalnless steel membrane between, as
shown in Figure 4.6. The top layer is ordinary concrete with a density
of 150 1b/£t2, and the bottom layer is magnetite concrete with a density
of 220 1b/£t. Blocks in both layers run east and west. To aid in
remote maintenance, the bottom layer is divided into three rows of
blocks. Blocks in the outer rows are supported on one end by a 13-in.
by L-in.-channel iron ring welded to the inside of the cell wall. The
cavity in the channel is filled with steel shot to provide shielding for
the:cracks between: edges of the blocks and the cell wall. One-half-inch
steel plate stiffeners are installed at 9° intervals. The top of the
channel is at the 848-1/2-ft elevation.

Two beams provide the rest of the support for the bottom layer of
blocks. These beams were built of 36-in. WF 150-1b I-beams with angle
iron and steel plate stiffeners. The cavities were filled with con-
crete for shielding. The beams rest on a built-up support plant
assembly, which is welded to the side of the cell at the 847-ft-T7-in.
elevation. Offsets 6-1/4-in. by 26 in. are provided in the ends of the
bottom blocks to fit over the support beams. Guides formed by angle
iron assure proper alignment. Several of the bottom blocks have stepped
plugs for access to selected parts of the cell for remote maintenance.
These are described in Part X.

The sides of the blocks are recessed 1/2 in. for 14 in, down from
the top. With blocks set side by side and with a 1/2-in. gap between,
a 1-1/2-in. slot is formed at the top. One-inch-thick steel plate 12 in.
high is placed in the slots for shielding. The ll-gage, ASTM-A240 304
stainless steel membrane is placed on top of the bottom layer of blocks
and is seal-welded to the sides of the cell. Cover plates are provided

over each access plug. These are bolted to the membrane and are sealed

by neoprene O-rings. A 1/8-in. layer of masonite is placed on top of |
the membrane to protect it from damage by the top layer of blocks.

The top blocks are beams that reach from one side of the cell to
the other. The ends of these blocks are bolted to the top ring of the
cell by use of fifty 2-1/2-in. No. I NC-2 studs, 57-1/4 in. long, made
from ASTM-A320, Grade LT, bolting steel. These studs pass through holes
that were formed by casting 3-in. sched-40 pipes in the ends of the
blocks. Cold-rolled steel washers, 9 in. by 9 in. by 1 in. thick, and
standard 2-1/2-in. No. 4 NC-2 nuts are used on each stud.

A removable structural steel platform (elevation 823-1/2 ft at top)

forms a floor in the reactor cell vessel and a base for supporting
major pieces of equipment.

The reactor cell vessel is installed in another cylindrical steel
tank that is referred to here as the shield tank. This tank is 30 ft
in diameter by 35-1/2 ft high (elevation 816-1/2 to 852 ft). The
flat bottom is 3/4 in. thick, and the cylindrical section is 3/8 in.
thick. The shield tank sits on a reinforced concrete foundation that
is 34-1/2 ft in diameter by 2-1/2 ft thick. The reactor vessel cell
is centered in the shield tank and supported by a 15-ft-diam by 5-ft-
high cylindrical skirt made on l-in.-thick steel plate reinforced by
appropriate rings and stiffeners. The skirt is joined to the hemispheri-
cal bottom of the reactor cell in a manner that provides for some flexi-
bility and differential expansion and is anchored to the concrete
foundation with eighteen 2-in.-diam bolts.

From elevation 816-1/2 to 846 ft, the annulus between the shield
tank and the reactor cell vessel and skirt is filled with magnetite ~
sand and water for shielding. The water contains about 200 ppm of a
chromate-type rust inhibitor, Nalco-360. A k-in.-diam overflow line
to the coolant cell controls the water level in the annulus.

The region beneath the reactor cell vessel inside the skirt con-
tains only water, and steam will be produced there if a large quantity
of salt is spilled into the bottom of the reactor cell. An 8-in.-diam
vent pipe is provided to permit the steam to escape at low pressure, (14)
This pipe connects into the skirt at the junction with the reactor cell
and extends to elevation 846 ft where it passes through the wall of o/

 

the shield tank and terminates as an open pipe in the coclant cell.

 
*

 

47

From elevation 846 to 852 ft, the annulus between the reactor cell
and shield tank is filled with a ring of magnetite concrete. The con-
crete ring improves the shielding at the operating floor level and
provides some stiffening for the top of the reactor cell vessel. The
concrete ring is supported off the wall of the shield tank, and the
reactor cell wall is free to move through the ring and to expand and
contract relative to the shield tank.

Numerous penetrations are required through the walls of the reactor
cell and shield tank to provide for process and service piping, electrical
and instrument leads, and for other accesses. The penetrations are L-
to 36-in.-diam pipe sleeves welded into the walls of the reactor cell
and the shield tank. Since the reactor cell will be near 150°F when
the reactor is operating, and the temperature of the shield tank nay
at times be as low as 60°F, bellows were incorporated in most of the
sleeves to permit redial and axial movement of one tank relative to the
other without producing excessive stress. The bellows are covered
with partial sleeves to prevent the sand from packing tightly around
them. oo | |

Several other lines are installed in the penetrations directly
with welded seals at one or both ends, or they are grouped in plugs
which are filled with concrete and inserted in the penetrations.

The major openings are the 36-in.-diam neutron instrument tube and
drain tank interconnection and the 30-in.-diam duct for ventilating
the cell when maintenance is in progress. The original tank contained
several other 8-in.-and 24-in.-dlam penetrations, and they were either
removed or closed and filled with shielding. The penetrations, their
sizes and functions are listed in Table L.l.

4,3,2 Drain Tank Cell

The drain tank cell shown in Fig. 4.3 is 17 ft, 7 in. by 21 ft,
2-1/2 in., with the corners beveled at 45° angles for 2-1/2 ft.

The flat floor is at the 8l4-ft elevation, and the stainless steel
membrane between the two layers of top blocks is at the 838-ft-6-in.
elevation. The open pit extends to the 852-ft elevation.

The cell was designed for 40 psig and when completed in 1962, it
was hydrostatically tested at 48 psig (measured at the elevation of
the membrane at 838-1/2 ft).

The bottom and sides have a 3/16-in.-thick stainless steel liner
backed up by heavily reinforced concrete, magnetite concrete being used
where required for biological shielding. The liner is welded to an
angle-iron grid work at approximately 8-in. spacing, with 1/2-in. plug
welds. The angle irons are welded to reinforcement rods embedded in
the concrete.

Vertical columns in the north and south walls are welded to
horizontal beams embedded in the concrete of the cell floor. The tops
of the columns are welded to horizontal 36-in. WF 160 I-beams at
elevation 842 ft 1 in. to 842 ft 4-3/8 in. by welding a 1-1/L-in.
plate to the web of the beam. Eighty-two 3-1/k-in. by 4-1/2-in. by
10-in. steel keys are wedged into this slot to hold down the top blocks.

The top of the cell is constructed using two layers of reinforced
concrete blocks with an 1l-gauge (A-204, 304 stainless steel) membrane
between. Both layers of blocks are ordinary concrete (density 150
1b/5t7). The bottom layer is 4 ft thick and the top layer is 3-1/2 ft
thick. |

The block arrangement shown in Fig. Lk. 7 was selected to facilitate
remote maintenance. One side of the lower blocks, which run east and
west, is supported by a ledge at an elevation of 834-~1/2 ft. The
other side of these and the ends of the north-south blocks are sup-
ported by beams that extend from the east to the west side of the cell.
These beams are built up of 24-in., 105.9-1b I-beams with angle iron
and steel plate stiffeners. ‘The cavities are poured full of concrete
for shielding. These rest on a built-up support plate assembly, which
is welded to the side of the stainless steel liner and is anchored
into the ‘concrete walls. Offsets, 4-1/4 in. by 25-1/2 in., are pro-
vided in the ends of the bottom blocks to fit over the support beams.
nym grooves formed by angle irons assure proper alignment. The sides
of the bottom blocks are recessed 1/2 in. for 14 in. down from the top.
With two blocks side by side, with a 1/2-in. gap between the sides
at the bottom, a 1-1/2-in. slot is formed at the top. One-inch steel
plates, 12-in. high are put into the slots to provide biological
shielding.

Fig. 4.7. Block Arrangement on Top of Drain Tank Cell.
 

51

The 1l-gauge (ASTM A-240, 304 stainless steel) seal pan is placed
on top of the bottom blocks (elevation 838 ft 6 in.), and is seal-
welded to the sides of the cell. A 1/8-in. layer of Masonite is placed
on top of the seal pan to protect it from damage during installation
of the top blocks. The top blocks are beams that reach from the north
to the south side of the cell. They are held down by the eighty-two
3-1/b-in. by 4-1/2-in. by 10-in. steel keys discussed previously. These
are inserted into slots in the top beams of the north and south sides
of the cell and are driven in approximately 4 in., leaving approximately
5 in. bearing on the ends of the blocks, There are approximately four
keys for each end of each block. A 1-1/2-in., 6 NC square nut is
welded to the top of each key to aid in removing the keys for handling.

The floor elevation is 814 ft at the highest point along the west
wall and slopes 1/8 in./ft to a trench along the east wall. The trench
slopes 1/8 in./ft toward the south and terminates in a sump located in
the southeast corner. The sump consists of a 10-in.-long section of
4-in. sched-40 pipe and a 4-in. butt-welded cap (347 stainless steel).

Numerous lines are required through the walls of the drain tank
cell to provide for process and service piping, electrical and instru-
ment leads, and for other accesses. These enter through 3/4- to 6-in.
pipe or pipe sleeve penetrations that are welded to the stainless
steel liner and cast into the concrete walls. Lines are installed
in these individually or grouped in plugs that are filled with con-
crete and inserted. The penetrations, their sizes, and functions are
given in Table 4.2.

4.3.3 Coolant Cell and Coolant Drain Tank Cell
Expect for line 200 and 201 in the reactor cell, all coolant salt

 

piping is located in the coolant and coolant drain tank cell, shown in
Fig. 4.3. The top section of the coolant cell is a concrete enclosure
(penthouse) which rises from the southwest corner of the high bay to

an elevation of 863 ft 3 in. The walls are ordinary reinforced, 24-in.-
thick concrete except for the south corner, which is 15-1/2 in. thick.
Additional shielding for this corner is provided by the 2-ft-thick

base for the stack, which goes to the 859-ft elevation. A L4-in. ledge

penthouse supports the bottom layer of the top shield blocks. These
are constructed of 12-in.-thick reinforced regular concrete. The 12-
in.-thick top shielding blocks rest on the bottom blocks. The 1/2-in.
gaps between plugs in each layer are staggered for better shielding.
Ledges at the 862-ft-9-in. elevation on the northeast side and at the
861-ft-9-in. elevation on the other sides are provided for shielding.

The bottom of the coolant radiator is at elevation 836 ft 1-3/4 in.
The floor of the coolant stack enclosure, located south of the radistor,
is at elevation 835 ft 5 in., and the 2-ft-thick reinforced regular
concrete walls extend to the 859-ft elevation.

A 1-1/k-in. steel grating and/or ll-gauge sheet metal pan at
elevation 834 ft 11 in. separates the coolant cell from the coolant
drain tank cell. Thus, the coolant drain tank cell is below ground
level on ell sides. The elevation of the concrete floor is 820 ft.

It is bounded by the reactor cell annulus on the northeast and by the
special equipment room on the esst.

Penetrations No. XIII to XXII from the reactor cell terminate in
the coolant cell or coolant drain tank cell. The wall between the
coolant and coolant drain tank cells and the special equipment room is
16-in. thick to the 835-ft-5-in. elevation and 12 in. thick above this.
Existing openings between the cells (2 ft by 2 f8; 3 ft by 4 ft 6 in.;
9 ft by 5 ft 5 in.;- and 5 ft by 3 ft) are closed by stacked magnetite
concrete blocks to enable proper ventilation of both areas and to
provide adequate shielding. A 6-ft-wide concrete ramp with 2-ft stairs
in the center (slope 7 in 12) extends from the northwest corner of the
coolant ‘drain tank cell (west northwest to the blower house at the
840-ft elevation. This is closed off by stacked magnetite blocks.

Shielding from the coolant pump and piping is provided by 8 ft
of barytes blocks stacked above the 835-ft elevation between the radi-
ator housing and reactor shield.
4.3.4 Special Equipment Room

The major items of equipment locsted in the special equipment room
are the component coolant blowers, the containment boxes for the fuel pump,
cover gas and bubbler lines, the 30-in.-diam cell ventilation line and

the rupture discs and lines to the vapor-condensing system. This cell is

located southeast of the reactor cell and, as discussed previously, has
a common wall with coolant cell and coolant drain tank cell. The other
walls are 12-in.-thick reinforced concrete below ground level. The
cell is 15 ft 11 in. by 17 ft. The floor elevation is 828 ft 7 in.
except for a 5-ft by 15-ft-11-in. by 3-ft-deep pit which runs east

and west 2 ££ 3 in. from the south wall.

The top consists of 2 rows of removable concrete shield plugs
with staggered joints. Each row of blocks is one foot thick. The
bottom row is supported by a L-in. ledge at the 850-ft elevation.
Containment is provided by ventilation from the stack fans.

Penetrations No. X, XI, and XII from the reactor cell terminate
in the special equipment room. A typical electrical lead penetration

is shown in Fig. 19.10.

4.3.5 Pump Room
The pit pump and sump pumps are located in the pump room. This

room 1s located under the north end of the special equipment room.
It is 7-1/2 ft by 15 ft 3 in. by 6 ft 7 in. high, with a floor
elevation of 820 ft. A 3-ft by 3-ft sump located near center of
the north wall extends to the 811-ft elevation. Access to the pump
room is through a 3-ft by 4-ft hatch located near column C-8.

4.3,6 Service Tunnel

The fuel and coolant lube oll systems and the reactor cell ventila-
tion block valves (HCV 930 A and B) are located in the service tunnel.
This tunnel is 7 ft wide by 11 ft high by approximately 67 ft long.
It is located under the southeast corner of the 7503 building and
extends south and west outside the building. The floor elevation is
833 ft 3 in. Normal access is from the service room on the 8k0-ft
level; however, a 3-ft by 3-ft hatch located near the west end provides
access from outside the building. This hatch is normally closed by
a sheet-metal-covered wood lig. Containment is by ventilation from the
stack fans.

4.3.7 Transmitter Room and Electric Service Areas

The area north and west of the reactor cell annulus at elevation
831 ft (west tunnel) connects by a narrow passage to a similar area
north and east of the reactor cell annulus (east tunnel). These extend
eastward under the 840-ft floor to a 2L-in.-thick concrete wall 12 ft
north of column line 6. This entire area is called the south electric
service area. Six penetrations (No. I, II, III, IV, V, and XXIII)
from the reactor cell and eighteen (No. Q and R and 1 to 16) from the
drain tank cell terminate in this area. The walls, except for those
Joining the reactor or drain tank cells, are located below ground
level. The ceiling, which connects with the transmitter room, is 2L-
in.-thick reinforced concrete with a 3-ft-7-1/2-in. by 6-ft-7-1/2 in. by
24-in.-thick concrete plug for access to the area. This plug has a

h-in. by 12-in. offset on all sides for shielding.

The north electric service area is located north of the 2L-in.-
thick concrete wall mentioned above. The floor of this room is at the
82L4-ft elevation. Most of the remaining drain tank cell penetrations
terminate in this area (see Table 4.2) as well as some from the spare
cell. The ceiling of this area and the floor of the transmitter room
above is 2- to 4-in.-thick reinforced concrete poured on "Q" decking
No. 3-16. Containment is by ventilation from the stack fans. A 2-ft
by 3-ft manhole with hinged steel door provides access from the trans-

mitter room. . .
The floor of the transmitter room is at the 8LO-ft elevation.

The 5-in. floor of the high-bay, 852-ft elevation is the ceiling of the
transmitter room. A o-ft by 9-ft-3-1/2-1n. plug can be removed from
the high-bay floor so that the high-bay crane can be used to remove

the shielding plug on the 840- ft level between the transmitter room
and the south electric service area. This room is approximately 16 ft
by 20 ft and contains the leak detector system and instrumentation for
the drain tank. weigh cells, pump level and speed, sump level, component

cooling air, ete.

4.3.8 Auxiliary Cells
Six smaller cells are located between columns 2-5 and A-C. Removable

concrete blocks provide access from the high bay area at the 852-ft ele-

 
 

 

 

56

vation. General information regarding these cells are given in Table 4.3.
Containment of each is by ventilation from the stack fans. Descriptions
of their projected uses are given below.

Fuel Processing Cell. The fuel storage tank and other incell equip-

 

ment for hydrofluorinating or fluorinating the fuel or flush salt are
located in this cell. The absorber cubicle is located east of this cell
at the 852-ft level.

Decontamination Cell. This cell contains a decontamination tank.

 

Both tank and cell are used for underwater maintenance and storage of
contaminated equipment.

Liquid Waste Cell. The liquid waste tank, sand filter, and cell
sump jet block valves are located in this cell.

Remote Maintenance Cell. The liquid waste pump and waste tank

 

exhaust blower are located in this cell. It will also be used as a
remote maintenance practice cell.

Hot Storage Cell. This cell will be used to store contaminated
equipment removed from the reactor or drain tank cell.

Spare Cell. The absolute filter in the chemical processing cell
air exhaust line and the flame arrester in the chemical processing off-

gas line is located in this cell.

4.3,9 High-Bay Containment Enclosure

 

The high-bay containment enclosure between columns 2-8 and A-C is
42 ft by 136 ft with a ceiling elevation of 885 ft 4 in. The containment
extends east near column 8 to include the neutron instrument tube and
provide room for the fuel salt sampler.

A false ceiling and containment seal is installed 15 ft above the
floor between columns 8-9 and B-C. The containment walls extend from
this elevation to 885 ft 4 in. along column line C from columns 8 to 9,
then west along column line 9 to column A, then north along column A
to column 8. Thus the coolant cell penthouse is included in the high
bay area and the high-bay crane can be used for handling equipment and
shielding blocks in this cell. A 10-ft by 12-ft loading hatch and Bilco
door in the false ceiling of the area between columns 8-9 and B-C is used

for moving small equipment into or out of the containment enclosure

5. FUEL CIRCULATING SYSTEM

5.1 Layout

The fuel circulating system consists of the reactor vessel, the
fuel pump, the heat exchanger, interconnecting piping, and auxiliaries
and services. The major components of this system are contained within
the reactor cell, as indicated in Fig. 5.1 and Fig. 5.2, and shown on
ORNL Dwgs. E-GG-A-LOT700 (plan) and E-GG-B-4O701 (elev.).

The fuel pump bowl is at the highest elevation in the primary circu-
lating system and serves as an expansion volume for the salt. The level
of the molten-salt interface in the bowl is an indication of the inven-
tory of the salt in the system.

The heat exchanger and all piping in the circulation system pitch
downward at about 3° with the horizontal to promote drainage of the
salt to the reactor vessel. A drain line from the bottom of the reactor
also pitches downward at 3° and leads the salt to the drain tanks in
the adjoining cell.

The level of radioactivity in the reactor and drain tank cells
prevents direct approach for maintenance of equipment. The items most
likely to require servicing are therefore arranged to be accessible from:
above when using remotely operated tooling. In many cases the flanges,
electrical disconnects, etc., are provided with special bolting, clamps,
and lifting bails to facilitate remote manipulation. Five frozen-seal
type flanges ("freeze flanges") are provided in the main fuel and coolant
salt circuits to allow removal and replacement of major components. The
drain line from the reactor vessel can be cut and rejoined by brazing,
using specially developed, remotely operated tools and viewing equipment.
The procedures used in maintenance operations are fully described in Part X.

In general, the thermal expansion in the primary circulating loop
is accommodated by allowing the pump and heat exchanger to move. The
coolant salt piping and the drain line are sufficiently flexible in
themselves to absorb the displacements. The effect of temperature changes
on piping and equipment movements and stresses is discussed subsequently
in Sec. 5.6.2.

5.2 Flowsheet | | *

A detailed process flowsheet of the fuel circulating system is shown
in Fig. 5.3 (ORNL Dwg. AA-A-40880) . 2? An explanation of the symbols
used on the flowsheet is given in the Appendix. The data sheets, 0 the
17

line schedule, and the instrument application dlagrams supply the
supplemental information needed for detailed study of the flowsheet.
Thermocouple information is tabulated on ORNL Dwg. A-AA-B-40511 (51
sheets).

In the following discussion of the process flowsheet shown in Fig. 5.3,

detailed descriptions of the reactor, heat exchanger, and pump are re- *

gerved. for Secs. 5.3, 5.4, and 5.5. The instrumentation and controls

are mentioned in this section only to the extent necessary to explain
the flowsheet. A detailed description of the instrumentation, including ~
the interlocking controls, etc., is given in Part II.

During operation of the reactor, fuel salt is circulated through
the fuel system at a rate of 1200 gpm. The base pressure in the system
is 5 psig--the pressure of the helium cover gas at the surface of the
salt in the pump bowl. At design conditions of 10 Mw power level, fuel
enters the reactor at 1175°F and 35 psig, flows through the reactor vessel
and the reactor core, and leaves at 1225°F and 7 psig. It flows through
line 100 to the suction of the fuel pump and is discharged by the pump
through line 101 to the heat exchanger. The fuel enters the shell side
of the heat exchanger at 1225°F and 55 psig and leaves at 1175°F and v
35 psig. Coolant salt is circulated through the tubes, entering at 1025°F
and 77 psig and leaving at 1100°F and 47 psig. Fuel from the heat ex-
changer is returned to the reactor vessel through line 102. The pipe
lines in the circulating system are all 5-in. sched-4O INOR-8 pipe, and
the flow velocity is about 20 ft/sec. The total volume of salt in piping
and primary circulating system equipment under normal operating conditions
is about T3 £42,

Line 10% is provided to drain the contents of the fuel salt through
freeze valve 103 into the fuel drain tank system. An overflow tank under
the pump bowl, and connected to the bowl through line 520, provides 5.5 .
£47 of additional volume for expansion of salt and for protection against J

overfilling of the system. The drain and overflow lines are 1-1/2-in.
sched-40 INOR-8 pipe.

The reactor vessel is installed in a stainless steel thermal shield
that supports the reactor vessel and forms the outer wall of the reactor
furnace, The thermal shield is 16 in. thick and contains about 50% steel
and 50% water, which absorbs most of the neutron and gemma ray leakage
from the reactor. Water circulates through the shield at a rate of 100 gpm
and removes 180 kw of heat. It enters through line 844 and leaves through
line 845, with an estimated maximum temperature rise of 12°F. The
treated water supply is described in Sec. 15.

A nuclear instrument thimble penetrates the wall of the reactor cell
vessel, the outer wall of the thermal shield, and terminates at the inner
wall. This thimble is filled with water and contains two compensated ion
chambers, two fission chambers, and three safety chambers for monitoring
the nuclear performance of the reactor.

The inside of the thermal shield is lined with 6 in. of high tempera-
ture insulation, and the annulus between the reactor vessel and the in-
sulation contains 126 vertical tubular heaters. The heaters are divided
between three circuits with a total capacity of 60 kw.

Temperatures are monitored at 48 locations on the reactor vessel and

top head assembly, most of which have spares, giving a total of 80 thermo-

couples (see ORNL Dwg. D-HH-B 40528). Temperatures at 25 of these locations

are scanned continuously and are used as a guide to control the operation
of the heaters.

A flanged nozzle on the top of the reactor vessel passes through the
top of the thermal shield and provides access to the core for the control
rod thimbles and for insertion of graphite and metal specimens for irradi-
ation. The access nozzle and plug are cooled by gas to provide frozen
salt seals in the annulus between them and in the sample port annulus.
‘Gas coolant is supplied through lines 961, 962, and 96% at a rate of 10
scfm through each and is discharged directly to the cell atmosphere. Gas
coolant for the three control rods is supplied at a rate of 15 scfm through
line 915 and is discharged to the cell atmosphere through line 956.

Valves are provided in the inlet and outlet lines to block the flow and
prevent fuel salt from being discharged into the cell if a thimble
develops a leak.

 
<«)

 

69

The system for circulating the cooling gas, which is 95% nitrogen
and <5% oxygen (and is also the atmosphere in the reactor and drain tank
cells), is described in Sec. 16.

The sample port in the access nozzle opens into the graphite sampler
housing. This is a steel tank in which the atmosphere can be controlled
to prevent the reactor and the samples from being contaminated by oxygen
and moisture as the samples are transferred into and out of the core.

The transfer must be done with the reactor shut down and drained. Line
918 ventilates the sampler housing to the reactor offgas system. Dry
helium or nitrogen is supplied to the housing through the seals on the
cover,

Line 100 connects the outlet of the reactor vessel to the suction of
the fuel pump. Thermocouples near the entrance to line 100 are used for
alarm and control circuits and to sense the reactor outlet temperature,
which is recorded and logged on the data logger. Line 100 has & freeze
flange joint (FF-100). The buffer zone of the ring joint seal is supplied
with helium and monitored for leakage through line 410. Three pairs of
thermocouples are installed on the flanges with one thermocouple of each
pair serving as a spare. Thermocouples at two locations are connected
to temperature switches to annunciate an alarm if the temperature falls
below a preset value (see Instrument Application Diagram, Part II, or
ORNL Dwg. D-AA-B-40500). The leak detector and thermocouple installations
on FF-100 are duplicated on all other freeze flanges in the reactor
system.

A pipeline heater of 4-kw capacity and a spare are installed between
the reactor vessel and FF-100. A similar heater of h-kw capacity is
installed on the horizontal section of the pipe between FF-100 and the
pump bowl. The vertical section of pipe beneath the pump bowl is in the
pump furnace. The pipeline heaters, described in detail in Sec. 5.6.4,
are small furnaces that are assembled from ceramic heaters and reflective
insulation and are made to be easily removable for maintenance. Thermo~
couples are attached to the pipe under each heater unit to monitor the
temperature and are used as a guide to control the heaters.

The fuel pump is a vertical sump-type pump that circulates 1200 gpm
of salt against a head of 49 ft when operated at a speed of 1150 rpm.

 
 

 

 

 

70

About 65 gpm is recirculated internally into the pump bowl, 15 gpm along
the shaft and 50 gpm in a spray into the gas space, for removing krypton
and xenon. The liquid level in the pump bowl is determined by means of
two bubblers. Helium is introduced near the bottom of the pump bowl
through lines 593 and 596. Line 592 is a reference line that connects to
the expansion volume in the pump bowl near the top and is purged with
helium to prevent back diffusion of radioactive gases. Signals from the
level indicators are monitored continuously, logged on the data logger,
and used for alarm and control circuits.

The main purge of helium through the pump bowl enters through line
516 just below the lower shaft seal in the bearing housing. Most of the
gas flows downward through the labyrinth between the shaft and the shield
block in the neck of the bowl to prevent large amounts of radioactive
gas from reaching the seal. This helium combines with the helium from
the bubblers and carries the radioactive gases out of the pump house
through line 522. Line 522 is enlarged from 1/2-in. pipe to L4-in. pipe

to provide a holdup volume of 6 £12

and one hour of delay for the decay
of the short-lived radioactive isotopes before the gas leaves the reactor
cell and enters the offgas disposal system. The helium supply system

is described in Sec. 10.4. The offgas system is described in Sec. 12.

The distribution of helium to the pump is listed in Table 5.1, below.

Line 521 connects the pump offgas line to the gas lines in the drain
tank system to equalize the gas pressures in the drain tanks during normal
operation and facilitate the transfer of gas between systems during a
reactor drain.

A small amount of helium that enters the pump bowl through line 516
flows upward through the labyrinth, combines with a small amount of oil
that leaks through the lower shaft seal, and the mixture passes out of
the reactor cell through the lead-shielded (1-1/2) line 524% to the oil
catch tank located in the special equipment room. After leaving the oil
catch tank, the gas flows on to the offgas system through line 524, which
is fitted with a pressure reducing capillary, a filter, and a flow indi-
cating instrument. Signals from this instrument initiate an alarm if the
flow is outside a specified range.

The maximum height of the liquid level in the pump bowl is limited by
overflow into line 520, which connects to a 5.5.42 tank beneath the pump.
This tank is provided with helium bubblers that operate through lines 599
and 600 and reference line 589. Indication of high level in the overflow
tank causes the reactor system to be drained. Helium leaves the over-
flow tank through line 523, which connects to line 522. Valves HCV-523
and HV-523 are used to block the vent line so that the overflow tank can
be pressurized through the bubbler lines and salt can be discharged to
the pump bowl.

Line 999 connects the pump bowl to the sampler enricher. Capsules
are used to remove samples of fuel from the pump bowl through this 1-1/2-in.
line, and small slugs of fuel may also be added through it. The sampler
enricher is described in detail in Sec. 7.0.

The lower two-thirds of the pump bowl, the overflow line and tank, and
the vertical section of the suction line to the pump are installed in the
pump furnace. The furnace is divided into an upper zone around the pump
bowl and a lower zone around the overflow tank. The upper zone has nine
vertical tubular heaters with a total of 22.5-kw capacity, and the lower
zone has five similar; but longer; heaters with a total of 22.5-kw capacity.
There are 22 thermocouples and spares on the pump, eight thermocouples
on the overflow tank, and two thermocouples on line 100 inside the

furnace, for use in monitoring the temperatures and controlling the heaters.

 
72

The upper part of the pump bowl is not cooled by the circulating
fuel salt and must therefore be cooled by gas circulated over the outer
surface of the pump bowl to remove the heat generated by absorption of
beta and gamma radiation. The cooling gas is supplied through 3-in.
line 903 at a maximum flow rate of 400 scfm. The gas flow is confined
by a shroud around the bowl and is discharged to the cell atmosphere.
Temperatures of the top of the pump bowl and the flanged neck are used
in controlling the flow of coolant.

0il is used to cool and lubricate the pump bearings and to cool the
shield block in the neck of the pump bowl. Lubricating oil for the
bearings enters the top of the bearing housing through line 703 at =
rate of 4 gpm, and coolant for the shield block enters through line TOk
at a rate of 8 gpm. Oil leaves the shield block through line 707 and
passes through an ejector where it induces flow of oll from the bearings
through line 705. The combined flow leaves the pump through line 706.
The temperature of the oil supply is 150°F and the return temperature is
160°F. Line 590 is a breather pipe that connects the top of the lubri-
cating oil supply tank to the topmost passages in the bearing housing to
equalize the pressure between the two points. Details of the lubricating
oil system are discussed in Sec. 5.4.1.4. Temperatures in the oil
system on the pump are monitored by two thermocouples on the outlet oil
lines.

The fuel pump is driven by a T5-hp, 1150-rpm, 440-v, three-phase
electric motor. The motor is installed in a steel housing that will con-
tain oil and radioactive gases if either or both were to leak through the
upper seal in the bearing housing. The motor is cooled by 5 gpm of process
water that is circulated through a coil on the outside of the housing.
Water enters the coil through line 830 and leaves through line 831. A
microphone, XdbS, permits pump noises to be monitored in the control room.
The electrical input to the pump motor is instrumented for voltage,
current, and power readings. The motor speed is monitored and motor tem-
peratures are measured by a thermocouple (with spare).

All the lines to the pump bowl have flanged joints, and the pump is
assembled by means of two large flanged joints. The ring-Jjoint seals on

the flanges are connected to the leak detector system (see Sec. 11.0).

Fuel salt flows from the pump to the heat exchanger through line 101.
The line is provided with a freeze flange joint FF-10l. There are two
pipeline heaters, one of 4-kw and the other of 5-kw capacity, on the
section of line between the pump and the flange, and one 4-kw heater be-
tween the freeze flange and the heat exchanger. Thermocouples are
attached to the pipe under each heater to monitor the temperature and are
used as a guide to control the heaters.

The fuel heat exchanger is of the horizontal shell-and-tube type
with the fuel salt in the shell and the coolant salt in the tubes. The
exchanger has three electrical heater units that are similar in construc-
tion to those used on the pipelines but are considerably larger. The
total heater capacity is 30 kw. Sixteen thermocouples are distributed
between ten locations on the heat exchanger shell and nozzles. Fuel salt
leaves the heat exchanger and returns to the reactor inlet through line
102. Coolant salt enters through line 200 and leaves through line 201.
Freeze-flange disconnects FF-200 and FF-201 are installed in those lines
close to the exchanger.

Line 102 contains FF-102 to Join the heat exchanger and reactor
vessel, The vertical section of line 102, directly below the heat
exchanger, is heated by three calrod heaters that are attached perma-
nently and have a capacity of 6 kw. Three spare heaters with an addition-
al 6 kw capacity are installed on this section of line. The horizontal
section of the line to the freeze flange has three removable pipeline
heaters with a total of 16 kw capacity. One pipeline heater of 4 kw
capacity is provided between FF-102 and the thermal shield.

The temperatures on line 102 are monitored by eleven thermocouples

distributed between five locations. Four of the thermocouples are in-

‘stalled near the location where the line enters the thermal shield and

~ serve to indicate the fuel temperature at the inlet to the reactor for

all control and safety purposes.

Salt is introduced into the primary circulating system or drained
from it through line 103, which runs from the bottom of the reactor
vessel in the reactor cell to the drain tanks in the drain tank cell.
The line has a freeze valve, FV-103, to provide "on-off" control of the

salt flow. The valve is located within the reactor furnace so that in

 
 

 

 

Te

the emergency situation of loss of electrical power, the residual heat
in the furnace will be sufficient to melt the salt in the valve and cause
the system to drain. A cooling gas stream of 25 to 75 scfm is supplied
through line 919 and directed against the valve to maintain a frozen plug
of salt. A 1.5-kw electrical heater is installed on the valve to effect
a quick thaw under normal circumstances.

The freeze valve has three thermocouples, each with a spare, to
monitor and control the operation of the cooling gas and the heater.
Line 103 is insulated and heated by passing an electric current through

the pipe wall. The heating capacity is 0.3 kw/ft, resulting in a total

load of 17 kw. The line temperatures are monitored by twelve thermocouples.

5.3 Reactor Vessel and Core

A summary description of the reactor vessel and core is given
in Section 2.4.1, and a simplified drawing is shown in Fig. 2.2.
The general location of the reactor within the containment vessel

is shown in Figs. b.4 and 4.5.

5.3.1 Description

The reactor vessel is 58 in. ID and about 94% in. high. Cross
sectional views of the vessel, access nozzle, and core are shown in
Figs. 5.4 and 5.5, and the principal dimensions are given in Table 5.2.
It vas designed for a pressure of 50 psig at 1300°F, using an allowable
stress of 2750 psi for the INOR-8 alloy used for fabrication of all salt-
containing portions (see Section II of Ref. 18, Ref. 19, and ORNL
Specification JS-80-122). The properties of the INOR-8 are summarized
in Table 2.2 and described in detail in Part IV. The vessel has two
58-in.-ID torospherical ASME flanged and dished heads 1 in. thick.

The wall thickness of the cylindrical portion is 9/16 .in., except
for the top 16 in.; which is 1 in. thick. The extra thickness is needed
in the upper section to allow for 84 holes, 3/4 in. in diameter,
located with variable spacing around the top of the vessel to dis-
tribute the incoming salt evenly around the circumference. Salt is
delivered to the holes through a flow distributor, half-circular in
cross section, and with an inside radius of about 4 in. (see Fig. 2.2).

The 6-in.-diam inlet to the distributor is arranged tangentially
to the vessel, and the holes enter the vessel at an angle of 30° with
a tangent to the outer surface to impart a spiraling flow to the salt
as 1t moves downward through the reactor-vessel-wall cooling annulus.
Turbulent flow is promoted in this 1l-in.-wide annulus between the
vessel wall and the outside of the core can to improve the cooling
of the wall (see ORNL Dwgs. D-BB-B-40OLO7 and D-BB-B-404O1).

The salt then flows into the bottom head, which contains 48
swirl -straightening vanes extending radially 11 in. toward the center
of the vessel. These vanes are fabricated of 1/8-in.-thick INOR-8
plate. Elimination of the swirl in the bottom head reduces the radial
pressure gradient and promotes more even flow distribution through

the core.

The reactor vessel 1-1/2-in. sched-40 drain line extends about
2-3/4 in. into the inside of the vessel at the centerline and is
covered with a protective hood to prevent debris on the bottom of the
vessel from dropping into the opening. A 1/2-in.-diam tube is
mounted through the wall of the portion of the drain line protruding
inside the vessel to allow the salt to drain completely (see ORNL
Dwg. D-BB-B-4OL05). This tube extends through the drain line (103)
and the freeze valve, FV-103.

The core can, or shell, is 55-1/2 in. ID and 67-15/16 in. high
and was rolled from 1/4-in.-thick INOR-8 plate (see ORNL Dwg. D-BB-B-
40410). The can is supported, and also held down when salt is in the
reactor, by a ring at the top of the can which is bolted to 36 lugs
welded to the inside wall of the reactor vessel. The can, in turn,
supports the graphite used as a moderator material in the reactor.

The properties of the graphite are discussed in Section 5.3.2.

The reactor core is formed of 513 graphite core blocks, or stringers,
each 2 x 2 in. in cross section and about 67 in. long, overall, mounted
in a vertical close-packed array, as shown in Figure 5.6 and ORNL Dwg
D-BB-B-4O416. In addition there are 104 fractional-sized blocks at the
periphery. Half-channels are machined in the four faces of each stringer
to form flow passages in the assembly about 0.4 by 1.2 in. in cross
section. There are 1108 full-sized passages and, counting fractional
sizes, the equivalent total of 1140 full-sized passages. The dimensions
of these flow channels were chosen to provide a passage that would not
be blocked by small pieces of graphite and also to obtain a nearly
optimum ratio of fuel to graphite in the core. The volume fraction of
fuel is 0.225; the mass of fissionable material in the reactor is near
the minimum, and the effect of the fuel soaking into the pores in the
graphite is small.

When not buoyed up by being immersed in the fuel salt, the
vertical graphite stringers rest on a lattice of graphite blocks,
about 1 by 1-5/8 in. in cross section, laid horizontally in two layers
at right angles to each other (see ORNL Dwg. D-BB-B-40OL4L20). Holes in
the lattice blocks, with 4®-30' taper and 1.040 in. in smallest diam-

eter, accept the 1.000-in.-diam doweled section at the lower end of

each stringer with sufficient clearance to allow both angular and
lateral displacement. The upper horizontal surfaces of the graphite
lattice bars and stringers are tapered so that salt will not stand on
them after a reactor drain.

The lattice blocks are supported by a grid of 1/2-in. thick
INOR-8 plates, set on edge vertically, and varying in height from about
1-5/8 in. at the core periphery to about 5-9/16 in. at the center. (See
ORNL Dwg D-BB-B-4O413). This supporting grid is fastened to the
bottom of the core can and moves downward as the can elongates on a
temperature rise.

The regular pattern of the graphite stringers in the core is
disrupted at the center where the control rod thimbles and the graphite
and INOR-8 samples are located, see Figure 5.7. The control rod thimbles
are supported from above and the samples are supported from below when
no salt is in the reactor.

The INOR-8 and graphite samples are contained in three baskets in
the lattice position shown in Figure 5.7. Each basket can be withdrawn
independently of the others. A basket must be in place at each of the
three locations during reactor operation, however.

Each basket is formed of 1/32-in.-thick INOR-8 plate, perforated
with 3/32-in.-diam holes. The top fitting is drilled with 1/8-in.-diam
holes on 1/4-in. centers for circulation of the salt and is provided with
a T-shaped lifting bail. This bail permits the sample removing tool to
rotate as well as lift the basket for better maneuverability. The upper
portion of the basket assembly extends from 1/2 to 1-in. into the fuel-
salt outlet strainer and is held in position by it. The lower end of the
basket is provided with an INOR-8 fitting, also drilled with 1/8-in. diam
holes, which, in conjunction with the other two baskets, forms a dowel
to fit into the lower graphite lattic blocks in the same manner as the
graphite stringers previously described.

Fach basket contains four 0.250-in.-diam x 5-1/2-ft long samples of
INOR-8 and five graphite sample bars, 0.250 in. x 0.470 in., as shown in
Figure 5.8. The graphite bars are divided into samples of varying length
(up to about 12 in.), which laid end to end total about 5-1/2 ft. The

arrangement of the baskets and contents is experimental in nature and { ND
will be varied during operation of the MSRE.
The sample baskets are held down by a cup mounted on a 5/16-in. diam
rod which is an extension of the nozzle access plug, as shown in Figure 5.k.
The cup rests on the T-shaped lifting bails. A thermocouple is installed
on the hold-down rod to indicate the salt temperature leaving the reactor.
In addition to the graphite samples in the baskets, the five
graphite stringers at the center of the core can be removed, although
with considerable more difficulty. The location of these stringers is
indicated in Figure 5.7. The five stringers are of a special design
(Types 7, 60 and 61 on ORNL Dwgs D-BB-B-40L16, 40418 and 40581). They *
are 2-in. x 2-in. in cross section but are 64-1/2 in. long rather than
the 62-1/8 in. of the average stringer. They do not have the dowel
section at the bottom and the hole for the hold-down rods and they rest ~
directly on the INOR-8 supporting grid rather than on the graphite
lattice blocks. The lattice blocks do not extend across the five
stringer locations, the opening thus provided through the blocks per-
mitting insertion of a viewing device through the core to permit obser-
vation of the lower head should this prove desirable.
Each of the five stringers is drilled and tapped with a 3/L-in.
6 Acme thread on the upper end for an INOR-8 lifting knob, or stud,
which can engage a Snaptite quick-disconnect coupling. They are pre- Cv
vented from floating in the fuel salt by 1/8 in. x 1/2 in. hold-down
bars welded to the strainer assembly at a level even with the top of
the graphite core. (See ORNL Dwg E-BB-B-40598) .
The graphite core matrix is sufficiently unrestrained so that on
a temperature rise the induced stresses due to expansion of the graphite
will be minimized. The coefficient of expansion for the graphite is 1.3
to 1.7 x 1076 in./in.-°F, whereas for INOR-8 it is 7.8 x 107° in./in.-°F
(in the 70-1200°F range). This difference causes the core can to move
3/16 in. radially away from the graphite core blocks on heatup of the
reactor. To prevent an excessive amount of salt flow in the annuluar
space thus created, an INOR-8 restrictor ring, 1/2 x 1/2 x 54-1/2 in.
ID, surrounds the bundle of graphite stringers at the bottom (see
ORNL Dwg. D-BB-B-4OU27). The stringers are restrained from excessive 2)

movement at the top by a graphite retainer ring, 1 x 2 x 53-1/4 in.
ID. This ring, in turn, is held in place by an INOR-8 retainer ring,
3/4 x 3/k x 53-1/4% in. ID (see ORNL Dwg. D-BB-B-40428 for both rings).
At the top of the graphite blocks a centering bridge holds a row of
stringers in position on two diameters at right angles to each other.
This bridge helps to prevent shifting of the entire stringer assembly
(see ORNL Dwg. D-BB-B-L4oh2l),

A 5/16-in.-diam INOR-8 rod passes through a 0.010-in.-wall-thickness
bushing placed in a 0.375-in.-diam hole in the dowel section at the
bottom of each graphite stringer. These rods also pass through the
INOR-8 grid-supporting structure and prevent each graphite stringer
from floating in the fuel salt. If a graphite stringer were to break
in two, the top portion would tend to float away and leave a relatively
stagnant pocket of fuel salt which might reach a higher temperature
than desired. The effect of this on the reactivity and on the tempera-
tures in the reactor has been studied.¥ To guard against this eventu-
ality, a 1/16-in.-diam INOR-8 wire is passed through a 1/8-in.-diam
INOR-8 insert about 1 in. from the top of each graphite stringer,

‘fastening the tops together and to the core can.

To prevent possible overheating in a region that might otherwise
have been stagnant, about 24 gpm of the salt entering the reactor is
diverted into the region just above the core-can support flange in the
annulus between the pressure vessel and the core can. This is accom-
plished through 18 slots or channels, 0.2 by 0.2 in., cut in the core-
can flange. These slots are machined at an angle of 30° to promote
better mi ximg in the region. In addition, a by-pass flow of 3-22 gpm
of salt will pass through the annular clearances at the core can support
ring.” :

The salt leaves the reactor core and flows through the upper
head to the 10-in. nozzle opening. It is diverted through a 5-in.

 

*If a graphite stringer were to break in two near the center of
the core and the upper half floated away, the reactivity increase would
be 0.004% 8k/k for each 1 in. of stringer replaced by the fuel. If
the entire central stringer were replaced by fuel, the reactivity in-
crease would be only 0.13% 8k/k and no power or temperature excursion
of consequence should result.

the three control rods and for taking and placing of the four graphite-

sample rods in the core matrix. A strainer made from 16-gage INOR-8

centers, is built into the top head and access plug assembly to

prevent large chips of graphite from circulating with the fuel salt.
The control rods are discussed subsequently in Section 5.3.5

and the graphite sampler in Section 5.3.6.

5.3.2 Graphite

A moderator is desirable in a molten-salt type reactor to achieve
good neutron economy and low inventory of fissile material. It is
particularly desirable that the moderator be used without cladding
in order to obtain high breeding or conversion ratios. Graphite
is compatible with molten salt, making it possible to design the
MSRE with a heterogeneous type core, using unclad graphite as the
moderator.

A 2 by 2-in. cross section was adopted for the graphite core
stringers in the MSRE largely because it was believed that this was
about the largest size of high-density low-permeability graphite of
reactor grade that could be made available within a reasonable
amount of development time.

The graphite for the MSRE was ordered from the National Carbon
Company (New York), 2t the only bidder, to ORNL Specification MET-RM-1.
The graphite is a special grade, given the designation "CGB" by the
National Carbon Company, and new techniques and facilities were re-
quired to produce it. The graphite manufactured for the MSRE satisfied
all the requirements of the specifications except for freedom from
cracks and spalls. Some of this graphite was examined and tested,
and the actual requirements of the MSRE were carefully restudied,
with the result that material with some cracks and spalls was accepted
for use in the reactor.o2

The physical and mechanical properties of the MSRE graphite are
summarized in Table 5.3. The graphite is discussed in detail in
Part IV, but some of the features, particularly those relating to

the design, are briefly mentioned here.

Use of unclad graphite in the MSRE required that the graphite
be compatible with the fuel salt, fission products, and INOR-8.
The graphite must not introduce prohibitive amounts of contaminants,
such as oxygen, into the system. Further, the graphite must not
disintegrate or undergo excessive dimensional changes and distortion.
Its thermal conductivity should not decrease too much with time. A
most important characteristic is that the penetration of salt into
the voids in the graphite be a minimum, since this degree of salt
permeation determines the graphite temperature both during operation
and after shutdown. The extent of absorption of fission-product

135

gases is of concern in that the Xe contributes significantly to

the poison fraction.”
Both in-pile and out-of-pile loop and capsule tests demonstrated
that there need be no concern for solution of the graphite by the salt,
and that there are no apparent corrosion problems. 2 Other tests
demonstrated that the disintegration of the graphite does not occur
with or without chemical additions of fission products, either in or

thought high enough to cause the graphite to carburize the INOR-8, where
the two are in direct contact and there is any likelihood of failure of
the INOR-8 due to embrittlement, an INOR-8 insert has been placed be-
tween the load carrying piece and the graphite.

The graphite will be carefully heated in dry helium to desorb
water vapor after installation in the reactor. A purge salt will be
thoroughly circulated through the primary system to remove all but
trace amounts of oxygen before any fuel salt is introduced. It is
estimated that the oxygen in compounds in the CGB graphite and in
the oxide film on the INOR-8 surfaces, does not exceed about 130 ppm
of the purge salt, by weight. The purge salt, on an as-received basis,
is estimated to contain no more than 200 ppm of oxide ion; thus, the
salt, with its oxide saturation limit of about 1000 ppm, can reduce the
oxygen in the primary system to satisfactory levels before the uranium-
bearing salt is added. 2”? 26, 27

irradiation tests. This loss was taken into account in the reactor

design and an even greater reduction could be tolerated without
encountering undue aifficulties.>”

Shrinkage in the graphite will occur in proportion to the inte-
grated fast neutron flux. The radial flux gradient in the core will
cause the inner stringers to shorten at a greater rate, resulting in
the top of the graphite core matrix gradually becoming slightly dished.
Based on data taken on similar graphite, the axial shrinkage rate of a
stringer located at the point of maximum flux in the MSRE for one year
of operation at the 10-Mw reactor power level was estimated to be 0.1h4
in./yr. The radial shrinkage was estimated to be roughly one-half of
that in the axial direction. The radial flux gradient in the core will
cause uneven shrinkage in each stringer, and the resulting unsymmetrical
distribution of stresses will tend to bow the stringers outward to give
a slight barrel shape to the core. The maximum bowing effect was esti-
mated to be about 0.1 in./yr for a stringer at the point of maximum
flux and with continuous operation at 10 Mw. The widening of the fuel
passages, and other related effects of graphite shrinkage, were studied
from the nuclear standpoint and found to amount to changes in the reac-
tivity effect of less than 0.6h Ok/k per year of full-power operation,
and are not of consequence , 257 29 The nuclear aspects of graphite
shrinkage are discussed in detail in Section 14.2 of Part III.

In designing the graphite stringers for stresses induced by tem-
perature gradients, it was decided to limit the rate of temperature rise
to about 60°F/hr. Preheating 1s accomplished by circulation of helium
in the primary system, using the fuel pump as an inefficient blower.
Heat is introduced through use of the electric resistance heaters
installed throughout the primary and secondary systems.”

Even though the MSRE graphite has a density of about 1.87, it con-
tains about 16% by volume of total voids and T% by volume of voids that
ere interconnected and accessible from the surface, The graphite, as
produced for the MSRE, however, has pore openings that average less than
0.3 u in diameter. Since the salt does not wet the graphite, the surface
tension and contact angle are such as to limit the salt penetration to

less than the permitted amount of 0.5% by volume of the graphite at 165

psia. The heat produced in the graphite by this quantity of fuel salt
under full-power conditions of 10 Mw increases the average graphite tem-
perature by about 197.0% Fission products entrapped in the graphite
with the salt will continue to generate heat after the remainder of
the fuel salt has been drained from the reactor. With the cooling
medium thus withdrawn, and with no other means of heat removal effective,
it has been estimated that the temperature rise of the graphite would
be less than 100°F in 48 hr.oc

Despite the considerable amount of preliminary testing expended
in development of a graphite for use in the MSRE, it is recognized
that some uncertainties exist that can be resolved only by operation
of the reactor.” The behavior of the graphite will be monitored by
periodic removal and examination of samples placed near the center
of the core. Full-sized pieces located in the core adjacent to the
samples can be examined in place by means of a periscope, or can be
withdrawn infrequently for hot-cell examination by removing the

reactor vessel access nozzle plug and control rod thimble assembly.

5.3.3 Fluid Dynamics, Temperature Distribution, and Solids Deposition
5.3.3.1 General. A general description of the flow through the
reactor vessel and core is given in Section 5.3.1.

Models were used to investigate the fluid dynamics and heat trans-
fer within the reactor vessel, but prior to these studies, several
decisions were made early in the project to initiate the design effort.
One of these was to choose a right cylindrical shape for the vessel,
mainly because of the ease of manufacture and because the flow pattern
could be fairly well predicted. Preliminary studies of the vessel
size as a function of the critical mass required indicated an accept-
able diameter range of 4 to 5 ft. A relatively large mass flow rate
was decided upon in order to obtain hydraulic characteristics more
nearly approximating those that would exist in a full-scale reactor.
Early studies, subsequently confirmed, indicated a reasonable “tempera-
ture rise for the salt passing through the reactor if the flow rate
were 1200 —

Another early decision was that the flow should be upwards through

the core in order to facilitate removal of gases from the core passages

“and upper plenum. Preliminary estimates of the heat generation rate

in the reactor vessel wall indicated that cooling would be necessary.
It appeared best to cool the wall with the incoming fuel, by circulat-
ing the salt between the vessel wall and the reactor core container
can. > Because of the heat generation within the salt in this annulus,
the so-called Poppendiek effect,” flow rates well within the turbulent
range were needed. This led to adoption of the spiral flow pattern in
the annulus and the annulus width, somewhat arbitrarily taken, of 1 in. 3H
Regularly shaped, flat passages through the graphite were selected
as being better than circular ones in reducing radial temperature gradi-
ents. This geometry also reduces the tendency of the salt, with a
Reynolds number in the transition region, to fluctuate between laminar
and turbulent flow as the Reynolds number increases with temperature
during passage through the core.
5.3.3.2 Model Studies. One-fifth and full-scale model studies vere
made, to investigate the flow distribution in the reactor, to verify the
pressure drop estimates, and to study the settling of solids or sludge
and the efficacy of its removal through the reactor drain line. Heat
transfer studies were also made through use of a heat meter.
The small model was made of clear plastic and used water as the cir-
culating fluid. The full-scale model, Fig. 5.9, was made of carbon steel
with aluminum core blocks. Water was used as the circulating fluid in
the first test runs of the full-scale model; later, a gel was added to
the water to duplicate the viscosity (but not the density) of the fuel
salt at operating temperature. All testing was at room temperature
with essentially no heat transfer to or from the circulating liquid.
Both models were fluid dynamically similar to the reactor system, operated
at the same Reynolds number as the salt, and could be related with simple
proportionality constants. The full-scale model served to refine the data
taken from the one-fifth-scale installation. There were no major differen-
ces between the findings from the two models, most variations being due to
the difficulty of obtaining good geometric similarity in the small model.
5.3.3.3 Overall Pressure Drop Across Reactor. The overall pres-

sure drop from the reactor vessel inlet to the outlet was measured

on the full-scale model and found to be about 9.2 ft or fluid at a

flow rate of 1200 gpm. The overall pressure drop varied as the square
of the flow rate, as shown graphically in Fig. 5.10. An overall pressure
drop very nearly proportional to the velocity squared implies that the
controlling pressure loss (in the flow distributor) is almost independent
of the Reynolds number over the range of flows that are of interest. 0
5.3.3.4 Flow Distributor. The flow distributor was described
in Section 5.3.1. Full-scale model studies showed that the centerline
velocity in the distributor varied from 9 to 23 fps, as shown graphically
in Pig. 5.11. The increase in velocity immediately following the inlet
opening is due to the recirculation of liquid around the distributor.
Within the limits of experimental error, the velocity decreased linearly
with distance from the inlet, indicating that the flow was being dis-
tributed uniformly to the cooling annulus around the circumference of
the vessel.

Based on an equivalent diameter of 5.1 in. for the distributor, the
Reynolds number is essentially equal to 1.29 x 10% per ft/sec of velocity.
The residence time of the fuel in the distributor is ~1.1 sec, and the
average temperature increase is estimated to be only 0.004°F at rated
conditions (see Chapter II, Ref. 18).

The 3/4-in.-diam holes through which the fuel salt flows from the
distributor to the annular space in the vessel are drilled at an angle
of 30° with a tangent to the vessel to conserve much of the circum-
ferential velocity developed in the distributor. The vertical rows of
holes are spaced 5° apart at the upstream end, but the spacing is in-
creased to 22 1/2° at the downstream end because the fluid static
pressure is greater. At rated flow of 1200 gpm, the velocity through
the upstream holes is estimated to be ~3.7 fps, and at the downstream
holes is ~18.5 fps, giving Reynolds numbers of T7050 and 35,250, re-
spectively. (See Chapter II of Ref. 18.)

5.3.3.5 Cooling Annulus. As the fluid moves downward in the wall-
cooling annulus, the swirl component of the velocity decreases and
the total velocity becomes less. (The total velocity is the vector
sum of the axial and circumferential components.) The midplane
velocity of 5.1 fps gives a Reynolds number of 25,800 and an esti-
mated heat transfer coefficient of 2090 Btu/hr-£t°-°F. At design

estimated to be 0.054 w/cc. The temperature difference between the
inside wall surface and the bulk fuel temperature is thus only
about 0.12°F (Chapt. II, Ref. 18).

The lowest total velocity is at the bottom of the annulus and
is estimated to be ~k.2 fps, a value that is essentially constant
around the circumference.

The residence time in the annulus is estimated to be 2.43 sec
and the temperature increase to be ~1,13°F at rated power and flow
rate (see Chapt. II of Ref. 18). A conservative estimate is that
the pressure-vessel wall is cooled to an average temperature of no
more than 5°F above the bulk temperature of the entering salt (1175°F).

5.3.3.6 Lower Head. After leaving the cooling annulus the
fuel salt enters the lower head of the vessel, which serves as a
plenum in which the salt is distributed to the reactor core passages.
The 48 vanes in the head have a radial length of about 11 in., or
about 30% of the vessel radius. The vanes check the swirl developed
in the annulus to reduce the radial fluid pressure gradient in the
lower head to less than 2 in. of fluid. This small gradient is
judged to have a negligible effect on the distribution of the fuel
to the core passages (Chapt. II, Ref. 18).

Fluid age measurements were made throughout the lower head on
the one-fifth-scale model by use of salt conductivity techniques.

A salt solution was added suddenly to the circulating fluid just up-
stream of the model inlet and changes of conductivity were measured
by numervus probes in the lower head. Although these values were
taken from the small model in which good hydrodynamic similarity was
difficult to obtain, they lead substance to the qualitative conclusion
that the region of the lower head with the highest combination of
fuel-salt residence time, power density, and nuclear importance, is

at the centerline.

The integral residence time of the fuel salt in the lower head
is estimated to be about 4.2 sec, and the integral average temperature

increase is about 0.5°F at rated flow and power.

Heat transfer measurements were made in the lower head of both
the small and full scale models. The latter appeared to give the
most reliable results and indicate a heat transfer coefficient of about
1500 Btu/hr-£t°-OF at a point about 17 in. radial distance from the
outer circumference. This value is based on both heat meter measure-

37

ments and on calculations which make use of the measured velocity
profiles. The heat transfer coefficient, based only on heat meter
measurements, at a radius of 4 in. from the center of the head was
indicated to be about 900 Btu/hr-£t2- OF. (See Chapter II of Ref. 18.)

The average heat generation within the wall of the lower head
was estimated to be 0.61 w/cc. If the walls were so insulated that
all internally generated heat must be dissipated to the fuel solution,
the inner wall surface temperature would be about 1193°F, or 16°F
above the bulk fluid temperature of 1177°F. The outside surface of
the lower head at a point 4 in. from the centerline would be about
14°F hotter than the inside surface and would be at 1207°F. The
highest temperature associated with the cap over the drain line in
the lower head would be about 1202°F, or 25°F above the temperature
of the surrounding salt. All the estimated values mentioned above
assume no deposition of solids on the lower head.

If solid particles of ALUN were formed in the MSRE by oxidation
of the fuel salt, these particles would probably settle on the lower
head. The presence of this sludge would increase the temperature of
the wall of the lower head by increasing the heat source at the
wall and also by reducing the heat transfer coefficient from the
wall to the salt. If a thermal conductivity of 2 Btu/hr-£t°, and a
porosity of 30%, are assumed for the Zr0,
rate is estimated to be about 40,620 Btu/hr-£t°, of which 90% mey be

due to gamma heating and the remainder due to fissioning in the fuel

sludge, the heat generation

in the ‘sludge voids. If the sludge accumulation were 0.1 in. thick,
the added temperature difference between the wall and the salt would
be about 21°F, giving a temperature of 1228%F on the outside surface.
If the sludge were 0.5 in. thick, the difference would be about
120°F (see Ref. 18, Part II, p 19). Thermocouples are installed on

the lower head of the vessel to assist in detecting the accumulation

 
 

28

of solids and to provide assurance that the temperature of the head
does not exceed the design temperature of 1300°F for long periods.

The behavior of solid particles on the lower head was studied
by introducing iron filings into the circulating stream in the full-
scale model. After circulation for several hours, the core was
drained and the placement of the sediment in the bottom head was
examined. Fine particles appeared to have been swept out by the
draining fluid. Larger particles accumulated near the drain line
opening, but there were no indications of a tendency for the opening
to plug, and the design appeared to be adequate in this respect.

5.3.3.7 Core. The 1/2-in.-thick INOR-8 grid plates that support
the graphite core, as shown in Fig. 5.3 and described in Section 5.3.1,
are exposed to the flow of salt on both sides. The average velocity
of the salt at the grid is estimated to be about 0.16 fps, the Reynolds
number is 1400, and the heat transfer coefficient is ~200 Btu/hr-££°-°F
With an assumed heat generation rate of 1.7 w/ce in the liquid, the
temperature difference between the surface of the INOR-8 and the circulat-
ing salt is estimated to be about 17°F (Chapt. II, rer. 8).

The salt flows in a tortuous path through the graphite lattice above
the INOR grid, and the pressure drop through the lattice is greater than
the pressure loss through the core passage. Since the restriction
due to the lattice blocks is absent at the five stringer positions
at the center of the core, the velocities through the central
passages are about three times higher than the average core velocities.

The flow rate through a typical core passage is roughly 1 gpm,
with about 20% more flowing through the passages toward the center
than those near the periphery of the core. The variation of the
flow rate with distance from the center of the core, as shown graphic-
ally in Fig. 5.12, is due to the pressure gradient in the lower head. >?
The point scatter on this graph is largely due -to the greater tolerances
in the model than exist in the active core.

Flow studies made on the fuel-scale model showed that the flow
through the north-south fuel passages was about 10% less than that
through the east-west passages because the upper lattice blocks slightly

obstructed the entrance. To equalize the flow distribution, 0.104-in.-

The temperature distribution in the graphite and in the fuel
salt within the reactor core is a function of the heat production
rate and the heat transfer. Heat production follows the overall
shape of the neutron flux, which is discussed in detail in Part III.
The heat transfer is a function of the velocities, which were determined
largely through the model studies.

Bulk mean temperatures were obtained by integrating the local
temperatures over the core volume. These bulk temperatures are use-
ful in estimating the mean density of the fuel and graphite to arrive
at the inventory of fuel in the core. Nuclear mean temperatures
consider the local nuclear importances as well as the temperatures.

Overall fuel and graphite temperatures were calculated for a
core that was divided radially and axially into regions having
similar hydraulic or nuclear characteristics, giving a total of
twenty regions. At the design power level of 10 Mw, with the reactor
inlet at 1175°F and the outlet at 1225°F, the nuclear mean tempera-
ture of the fuel was 1211°F and the graphite was 1255°F. The
bulk mean fuel temperature, including all fuel in the reactor
vessel except that in the flow distributor, was 1199°F, and the
bulk mean temperature of the graphite was 1229°F, assuming no salt
were absorbed in it. With 0.5% fuel permeation, the nuclear mean
temperature of the graphite was 1258°F and the bulk mean temperature
was 1227°F. The central portion of the core, which is defined as
that portion inside the core can and between the bottom of the
lower layer of lattice blocks to the top of the uniform fuel passages
through the core, produces about 87% of the total power. Peripheral
regions, where the fuel to graphite ratio is much higher, such as
at the top of the graphite matrix, account for the remaining 15%.

A summary of the nuclear data for the reactor is shown in
Table 5.4. Values are given for three kinds of fuel salt: (1) fully
enriched uranium with thorium, (2) fully enriched uranium, and (3)

partially enriched uranium. Thorium-containing salts are of interest

in future large-scale breeder reactors. The salt with the high en-
richment of 2354 is representative of the core fuel for a two-region
breeder reactor. A higher concentration of uranium was used in the
third salt to give increased tolerance for fluoride loss. This was
accomplished through use of partially enriched uranium and a relatively
large amount of 238y The third salt will be used in initial oper-
ations or the MSRE (see Part IV for detailed discussion of the chem-
istry of the fuel salt).

The difference between the mean fuel temperature and the tempera-
ture of the center of the graphite is the sum of the differences
between the center and edge of the fuel including the Poppendiek effect,”
and the temperature difference in the graphite caused by its own in-
ternal heat generation. These values have been calculated and the
maximum graphite temperature in the reactor 1s estimated to be 1296°F
at rated flow and power. This maximum occurs about 50 in. from the
bottom of the 6b4-in.-high core matrix and about 7 in. from the center-
line.ot

The average fuel residence time in the core is 7.5 sec, and the
average fuel-salt temperature increase as it passes through the core
is about 50°F at 10 Mw of reactor power and with a flow rate of 1200
gpm, providing nominal temperatures for the entering salt of 1175°F
and for the leaving salt of 1225°F. It is calculated that the fuel
salt leaves the hottest flow channel through the core at about
1262°F ,

5.3.3.8 Upper Head. On leaving the reactor core, the fuel
salt passes into the reactor vessel upper head. Flow in the head
was observed in the models to be turbulent and the heat transfer
more than adequate; therefore, few detailed studies were made of this
region of the reactor vessel.

The region just above the core-can flange, described in Section
5.3.1, was given some study. Although more than 24 gpm is introduced
into the region through slots and clearances, estimates of temperature
were made on the basis that the slots were plugged. The method of heat
transport was considered to be transfer down the pressure vessel wall

and through the core-can flange to the wall-cooling annulus, and radial

 
 

 

 

104

transport of the heat to the fuel in the gap between the core can and
the graphite core. It was assumed that the reactor was insulated and
that gamma heating in the metal walls was 0.1 w/cc. With these
assumptions, the temperature was calculated to be about 30°F above
the reactor inlet temperature of 1175°F and occurred at a point about
3 in. above the flow distributor. With the flow-restrictor ring
gap plugged so that no salt flowed upward between the graphite core
and the core can, the temperature at the same point was estimated to
be about 4O°F above the reactor inlet temperature.

The upper head also contains the discharge strainer assembly,

which will be described subsequently.

5.3.4 Reactor Access Nozzle, Plug, and Strainer

The 10-in. nozzle through which the salt leaves the upper head
of the reactor vessel has a 40-in.-long extension welded above it.
This extension has a 5-in. side outlet for the leaving salt. The
extension serves as a housing for the nozzle plug, which is a removable
support for the three 2-in. control rod thimbles, the 2-1/2-in.
graphite sample access pipe, and for the discharge screen, as shown
in Fig. 5.k.

Thermal stresses induced by the temperature gradient across
the nozzle extension wall were investigated and found to be well
within the allowable limits.

The removable nozzle plug is about 20-1/2 in. long and is 9.770
in. OD at the top and 9.520 in. OD at the bottom to provide a taper
to assist in freeing the plug for removal. The radial clearance is
1/8 in. at the top and 1/4 in. at the bottom. Fuel salt is frozen
in the annular space between the plug and the nozzle, to effect a
salt seal. The salt is maintained below the freezing temperature
by cooling the outside of the nozzle extension and the inside of the
plug with a flow of cell atmosphere gas. About 10 cfm of this gas
is supplied to the outside of the nozzle extension and the inside of the
plug with a flow of cell atmosphere gas. About 10 cfm of this gas
is supplied to the outside cooling jacket through a 1/2-in. pipe,
line 962, and about 10 cfm is supplied through line 963 to the inner
cooling jacket. The discharge of both jackets is to the cell atmos-

phere. The salt seal prevents the salt from coming in contact with -
and corroding the ring-joint gas seal on the upper flange.

The nozzle plug is hollow and is filled with insulation. The
upper end of the plug is welded to the mating flange for the 1l0-in.
closure. This flange is provided with an O-ring seal to make the
joint gas tight. The bolting for the flange is arranged for manipu-
lation with remotely operated tooling. It may be noted that when the
flange is unbolted, the plug can be withdrawn, carrying the control
rod thimbles, the graphite-sample guide tube, and the discharge
screen assembly with it.

The upper head of the reactor vessel has an 18-in.-diam strainer
ring mounted just below the discharge nozzle opening, as shown in
Fig. 5.4. This ring is welded to six equally spaced lugs and to a
strengthening ring. The strainer is fabricated of 16-gage INOR-8
plate with staggered 3/32-in.-diam holes on 9/6k-in. centers, and
will stop large graphite chips. The center of the strainer ring is
cut away to permit the 9.52-in.-0D strainer-basket assembly on the
nozzle plug to pass through it. An INOR-8 seal ring, 1/4 in. by 3/4 in.
wide, 9583 in. ID and 11.083 in. OD, 1s loosely mounted with the
strainer ring and makes an acceptably close fit with the stralner basket.

The lower end of the nozzle plug 1s contoured to direct the
fuel salt stream toward the 5-in. side outlet. Projecting below
this is & 9.520-in.-diam by 12-17/32-in.-long cylinder of 1/8-in.-
thick plate for supporting the strainer basket. The basket is
welded to the bottom of the cylinder, is 9.520 in. OD at the top
and about 8-1/2-in. OD at the bottom and is about T in. deep. The
holes in the basket strainer are of the same size and configuration
as those in the strainer ring, mentioned above. The three INOR-8-
graphite sampler baskets, described previously in Section 5.3.1, pass
through a 2-3/8 in. diam opening in the strainer basket. The three
2-in.-diam control rod thimbles also pass through the strainer basket.
A cross-shaped extension of the basket assembly projects beneath the
basket about 2-1/2 in. to act as & hold-down for the five full-sized

graphite stringer samples at the center of the reactor core.

106

All clearances between the strainer basket and the strainer ring, -
thimbles, etc., are less than 1/16 in. so that graphite chips will

be retained.

5.3.5 Control Rods

5.3.5.1 Introduction. Excess reactivity must be provided over
that required for the reactor to be critical while clean and noncircu-
lating at 1200°F, in order to compensate for xenon poisoning, loss of
delayed neutrons from the reactor via the leaving fuel salt, the
negative power coefficient, and for some burnup in the fuel. Variations -
in the pump speed and possible differences in the degree of fuel pene-
tration into the graphite may also require some shim control of reac- «|
tivity. It is also desirable to hold the reactor subcritical during
startup operations when charging fuel salt into the system by pro-
cedures other than heating the system to high temperatures. The
adjustment of reactivity is provided for in the MSRE by three identical
control rods located near the center of the MSRE core.

While control rods are employed for the above-mentioned reasons,
the nuclear safety of the reactor is not primarily dependent upon
them. The rods are, therefore, not a fast-acting type, designed for
extreme reliability. Simultaneous withdrawal of all three rods would,
however, create an undesirable situation under certain conditions,
necessitating certain interlocks and controls. The control philosophy
is covered in Part II. ‘

The need for a graphite-sampling arrangement at the center of the “
reactor complicated design of the control rod system in that it was
also necessary that the control rods be in a region of high nuclear
importance. The graphite-sampling equipment interfered dimensionally
with the use of straight control rods and dictated that the rods be
flexible and used in thimbles having offsetting bends. This type of
rod was used successfully in the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.

Early plans for use of natural boron carbide (19% 30) as the
poison material were abandoned in favor of gadolinium oxide in that
the latter increased the control rod worth as well as eliminated the
problem associated with the boron of helium pressure buildup in the
sealed cans containing the poison. The selection of the control rod -

poison material is discussed in detail in Part III.

5.3.5.2 Description. Three control rod thimbles are arranged
equidistant from the center of the core matrix at the graphite
stringer locations shown in Fig. 5.7. The centers of the control
rods are 2-53/64 in. from the reactor centerline.

The thimbles are fabricated of 2-in. sched-40 INOR-8 pipe that
is reduced to 2-in.-OD by 0.065-in. wall tubing in the bottom 5 ft
of length that is inserted in the graphite core. They are supported
by the removable plug in the reactor access nozzle, and have two
16-in.-radius 3-° offsetting bends just above the nozzle extension
closure flange to permit the control rods to clear the graphite-
sampler equipment. The thimbles extend through the core matrix to
about 1/2 in. above the graphite lattice blocks. Four INOR-8 spacer
sleeves, about 1-1/2 in. long and with eight fins, are welded to
each thimble to position it equidistant from adjoining graphite
stringers, as indicated in Fig. 5.4 (see ORNL Dwg. E-BB-B-40598).

The control rods are segmented to provide the flexibility
needed to pass through the bends in the control rod thimbles. The
poison material is in the form of thin-walled cylinders, as shown
in Fig. 5.13. The ceramic cylinder is a mixture of 70 wt % gadolinium
oxide and %0 wt % aluminum oxide, 1.08 in. OD x 0.8% in. ID x 0.438
in. long. Three cylinders are canned in a 0.020-in.-thick welded
Inconel shell 1.140 in. OD x 0.790 in. ID x 1.562 in. long (see ORNL
Dwg. E-BB-B-56347 and ORNL Specification J5-81-183). The properties
and fabrication requirements of the poison elements are discussed in
Part IV.

Thirty-eight elements are used for each control rod, providing
a poison section 59.4 in. long. As indicated in Fig. 5.14, the
segments are threaded, bead-like, on a 3/4-in.-OD by 5/8-in.-ID
helically wound, flexible stainless steel. Two 1/8-in.-diam braided
Inconel cables run through this hose to restrain it from stretching
when dropped in free fall at operating temperature of 1200-1400°F.
At the top of the poison section a retainer ring holds the elements
in place and an adapter changes the hose to a stainless steel con-
voluted type with a single wire-mesh sheath. This hose passes upward

through the thimble to the positioning chain on the control-rod drive

mechanism. The total length of a control rod assembly from the bottom Go
of the poison elements to the drive chain connector is about 14 ft.
See ORNL Dwg. E-BB-B-5633h4.

Each control rod is provided with an individual rod drive mechan-
ism housed in a box located adjacent to the graphite-sampler stand-
pipe. The drive mechanism is accessible using remote tooling operated
through the standpipe workshield (see Section 5.3.6).

Each rod is moved by a 1/30-hp servo-motor driving through a

brake, gear reducer, clutches, and a sprocket chain, as shown dia-
grammatically in Fig, 5.15. Two small synchros, driven from a bevel
gear on the main sprocket drive shaft, indicate rod motion, one at
5° per inch of movement and the other at 60° per inch of movement.
A linear potentiometer is also actuated by the drive shaft to pro-
vide a position signal which is used in the safety circuits. The
method of calibration of those instruments will be discussed sub-
sequently.

The control rod drive is self-locking in that, with the magnetic
clutch engaged and the drive motor exerting no torque, the rods will
not descend by their own weight (6 to 8 1b). An over-running clutch
provides a positive drive connection between the motor and the chain
sprocket to assure rod insertion. When the electromagnetic clutch
is disengaged, the over-running clutch also allows the rod to fall
freely. The drive unit is capable of exerting a downward thrust of
about 20 lb, and an upward pull of roughly 25 1b. The total stroke
is 60 in. at a maximum speed of 0.5 in./sec. The direction of movement
of the rods can be reversed in less than 0.5 sec. Motion can be -
stopped in less than 0.25 sec. The clutch release time is not more
than 0.05 sec, and the rod acceleration during a scram is at least
12 ft/sec’. Limit switches are provided at each end of the stroke.

The drive units were designed to operate in a radiation field
of 10°

unit is arranged for remote maintenance, or replacement, by tooling

rad/hr. The bearings are of the nonlubricated type and the

operated from above. The control rod drives were designed and fabri-
cated by the Vard Corporation (Pasadena, Calif.). (See ORNL om

The control rods are heated principally by the absorption of
fission capture and fission-product decay gamma rays and the absorp-
tion of recoil kinetic energy of the products of reaction. The
poison elements are cooled by 15 scfm of cell atmosphere gas (95% N,,
5% 0,) supplied at 150°F through line 915 to the flexible positioning
hose of each rod (5 scfm per rod), the gas returning upwards around
the canned poison sections to be exhausted to the reactor containment
cell atmosphere. The gas discharge temperature is estimated to be
about 1100°F and the poison elements may operate at a maximum tempera-
ture of about 1350°F. Complete loss of cooling air with the reactor
at full power would cause the maximum temperature in the control rod
to rise to about 1500°F.

A positive-position indicator is provided for the lower end of
the rod which permits recalibration of the position-indicating de-
vices, which are related to the upper end of the rod, should there
be variations in the length. The accuracy of rod position indication
needed for safe reactor operation was established as 10.2 in. tO
Development tests indicated that variations in length greater than
this could be expected when dropping the rods in simulated scram
conditions at operating temperatures. Positive indication of position
of the lower end is provided by the cooling gas flow down the center
of the flexible hose. A nozzle with radial ports is attached to the
bottom end and a restrictor, or throat, is welded to the guide bar
cage at a known point near the bottom of the thimble. When the nozzle
passes through the throat, the change in pressure drop in the gas flow
through the rod assembly is readily apparent and gives a position
indication to within less than 0.1 in. the position-indicating
instruments can be calibrated against this known position of the
lower end of the rod. (See Figure 2.2, p. 49, Ref, 122.)

5.3.5.3 Control Rod Worth. Each of the three rods, when fully
inserted and the other two completely withdrawn, has a worth of
2.8% Ak/k.* When all three rods are completely inserted, the total
worth is 6.7% Ak/k.* At the maximum withdrawal rate of 0.5 in./sec,
normally limited to one rod at a time, the change in reactivity is

0.04% (Lk/k)/sec.* Simultaneous insertion of all three rods at a
»”

i

113

rate of 0.5 in./sec causes a change in reactivity of 0.09% (Ak/k)/sec.*
These and other control rod constants are summarized in Table 5.k.
A discussion of the nuclear aspects of the rods is given in Part III.

Instrumentation is described in Part II.

5.3.6 Graphite Sampler

One of the objectives of the MSRE is to investigate the behavior
of the unclad graphite moderator in the reactor environment. Thus,
the reactor was designed for periodic removal of graphite specimens
from near the center of the core. The samples are exposed to much
the same salt velocity, temperature, and nuclear flux as the graphite
stringers which make up the core matrix. The specimens can be with-
drawn only when the reactor is inoperative and the fuel salt is drained
from the primary circulating system. When a sample is removed for
analysis, it must be replaced by another sample in order to maintain
the same flow pattern through the core.

The three graphite sample baskets mounted vertically within a
stringer position and the five removable stringers at the center of
the core have been described in Section 5.3.1. The small baskets
can be removed or replaced more or less routinely through the sample
access nozzle (to be described subsequently). Access to the five
stringers is obtained through removal of the entire reactor-vessel-
access-nozzle plug assembly. While this 1s accomplished through a
special work shield provided for the purpose, it is not a routine
procedure. oo

As shown in Figs. 5.4, the graphite-sample access plug fits into
the sample access nozzle. The INOR-8 plug is 1.610 in. ID x 2.375
in. OD x 46-13/32 in. long and terminates at the top in a 7-in. flange.
The flange is fitted with a Y-in. -diam O-ring closure. The bottom of
the plug is contoured to help direct the flow of fuel salt to the
side outlet of the 10-in. reactor- vessel nozzle. The plug is cooled
by cell atmosphere gas (95% Ny % 0 0) introduced at the center
through a 1/2-in. sched-ho stainless steel pipe (see Fig. 5.4 ). (This

cooling tube has a two-bolt flange at the top to permit it to be with-
drawn from the graphite sample access nozzle during maintenance or
sampling procedures and temporarily replaced with a metal-sheathed
heater of the "Firerod" type. This arrangement assures melting of any
residual salt to permit withdrawal of the sample access nozzle and its
attached hold-down rod and cup.) The cooling-gas flow is adjusted during
reactor operation to freeze fuel salt in the 1/8- to 1/L-in. tapered
anmlus between the plug and the nozzle to obtain a seal. The O-ring
closure is buffered and leak-detected with helium.

The INOR-8 graphite-sample access nozzle is 2.421 in. ID x 2.875 in.
0D x 39-17/32 in. long, and is welded to the closure for the 10-in.
reactor-vessel access nozzle, as shown in Fig. 5.4. A flange at the
upper end bolts to the mating flange on the sample access plug with an
O-ring joint (previously mentioned) and also bolts to the graphite-
sampler standpipe. The standpipe connections is through a 10-in.-diam
by 8-in.-long stainless steel bellows, which permits relative movement
of the standpipe and the reactor vessel.

Two different graphite-sampler standpipes are available for
joining the reactor access nozzle to the opening in the reactor-contain-
ment roof plug. The one left in place, and designated "No. 1," is used
when taking one of the small graphite-sample assemblies. Standpipe
No. 2, which will be described subsequently, is used when removing
and replacing the 2 by 2-in. graphite stringers.

Standpipe No. 1 is fabricated of stainless steel and is 19-3.4 in.
ID x 20 in. OD x 8 ft 10-1/8 in. high. All joints and connections are
gas-tight, and the standpipe is provided with purge and off-gas con-
nections. As indicated in Figs. 5.1.4, 5.5, and 5.16 the upper end of
the standpipe is bolted to a 40-in.-diam stainless steel liner set into
the lower magnetite concrete roof plug. The lower end of the standpipe
is fitted with the bellows extension which is bolted to the graphite-
sample access nozzle.

During normal power operation the liner opening is closed with
a magnetite-concrete plug 35-1/2 in. thick, 41-1/2 in. OD, and weigh-
ing about 6000 1b. A 6-in.-diam inspection port in this plug can be

opened by removing a stainless-steel-canned magnetite-concrete plug,

which is 35-1/2 in. long, and inserting a lead-glass plug. The 3-1/2- )
ft-thick ordinary concrete shield block, or roof plug, would cover
these openings during reactor operation.
When taking a graphite sample, with the reactor shut down and

drained of fuel salt, the upper shield block is taken away, the mag-
netite concrete plug is removed from the top of the liner, and a 3-ft-
high working shield is installed by placing it on the lower shield
block above the opening. This working shield (see Fig. 5.17) has
walls of l4-in.-thick lead, is canned in stainless steel, and weighs
about 8250 1b. A gas-tight seal is made by its weight bearing on two
Teflon O-ring seals on the bottom periphery (see ORNL Dwg. D-BB-C-
LO657). A work plug inserted in the top of the working shield is 12 in.
thick and contains a 3-in.-diam, heavy plate-glass viewing port,
tool openings, illuminating light, and purge and off-gas connections.
The work plug sits on Teflon gaskets to make a gas-tight seal. The
plug can be rotated by a gear and pinion arrangement (see. ORNL Dwg.
E-BB-C-406L6).

The 40-in.-diam liner in the lower roof plug and the 20-in.-diam
graphite-sampler standpipe No. 1 are not concentric but have circum-
ferences which are almost tangent. The crescent-shaped opening thus
provided to one side of the standpipe gives access to the control-rod-
drive mechanisms. Maintenance of this equipment can be accomplished 7
through the work shield. The shield can also be used to clear the
equipment from the 10-in. reactor-vessel access nozzle to remove the
five graphite stringers at the center of the core or to view the lover
head of the vessel.

In brief, the procedure for taking a graphite sample is as follows.

TH ra BE

First, the upper concrete shield block is removed and the 40-in.-diam
concrete plug is taken out of the lower shield block. The work shield

is then placed over the standpipe opening, a specimen assembly in an

unexposed sample holder with a top cover, an empty specimen holder with

no top cover are placed in the standpipe in the wells provided. The

standpipe is then carefully purged with nitrogen or helium gas until
the atmosphere is acceptable for entry into the reactor circulating

system. Working with remotely operated tooling through the work plug, )

the sample access plug is unbolted from the sample access nozzle flange
in the bellows extension at the bottom of the standpipe. The 1/2-in.
cooling-gas lines are disconnected from the access plug by use of the
quick-disconnect couplings. The access plug, with its attached hold-
down rod, is then withdrawn and set aside in the rack provided in the
standpipe. A special tool can then be inserted through the graphite-
sample access nozzle to the top of the core to engage and withdraw
one of the exposed graphite-sample assemblies. This is placed in the
empty specimen holder and the top cover front the unexposed specimen
holder installed on it. The unexposed specimen assembly is then
inserted into the core, and the access plug is replaced. The stand-
pipe is purged of radioactive gases to the off-gas system. After a
suitable decay period the graphite sample is transferred to a special
carrier for transport to the analytical laboratory in the X-10 area.
Should it be necessary to remove and replace any of the five
2 by 2-in. stringers from the center of the core, the reactor would
be shut down and drained, the upper roof block would be removed,
the round plug in the lower roof block would be lifted and set aside,
and the work shield, with its work plug, would be set in place. Stand-
pipe No. 1 would then be disconnected, which also necessitates discon-
nection and removal of the control-rod-drive assemblies. After setting
the working shield aside, the overhead crane would be used to lift
standpipe No. 1 and to set standpipe No. 2 in place. This standpipe is
34-1/2 in. OD and is fabricated of 1ll-gage stainless steel. The top
flange of the standpipe attaches to the lower roof block in the same
manner as standpipe No. 1. The lower end attaches to the 10-in.
access nozzle flange. Then, by working with special tooling through
the work plug, the plug in the 10-in. access nozzle would be removed
and the 2 by 2-in. graphite stringers would be withdrawn from the core

matrix.

5.3. Mechanical Design of Reactor Vessel

 

The reactor-vessel-shell and head thickness requirements were
determined by the rules of the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel Code,
Section vir.

 
 

My

119

The vessel design conditions were taken as 50 psig and 1300°F.
The allowable stress used in the various computations was 2750 psi.

The allowable stress for INOR-8 changes with temperature as shown
in Fig. 5.18. The stress values shown in this figure are for wrought
and annealed sheet, plate, piping and tubing, and do not apply to weld
or cast metal. However, tests have shown welds to have properties as
good as the parent metal. The allowable stresses used in the design of
the reactor were based on the lowest value obtained from any of the
following criterias’

1. One-fourth of the minimum specified tensile strength, adjusted
for temperature variation. As shown in Fig. 5.18 this criterion was
controlling in the 0 - 200°F range.

2. Two-thirds of the minimum specified yield strength, adjusted
for temperature variation. This criterion established the allowable
stress in the 200 - 900°F range.

3. Four-fifths of the stress to produce rupture in 100,000 hr.

In the temperature range of 900 - 1030°F this factor was controlling.

4. Two-thirds of the stress to produce a creep rate of 0.1% in
10,000 hr. This criterion established the allowable stress above 1030°F,
which is the range for which the pressure vessel must be designed.

The first three of the above criteria correspond to standard
practices (see Ref 47, Appendix Q, p 174). A safety factor of two-
thirds was applied in the fourth criterion to allow for variation
between batches of material and other uncertainties.

In 1962 the ASME code committees accepted INOR-8 (Hastelloy N)
as a material of construction for unfired pressure vessels. The
allowable stresses under the code exceed those used in the MSRE
design by about 20%.

The curves of Fig. 5.18 show that the allowable stresses drop from

6000 psi at 1200°F to 1900 psi at 1400°F and emphasize the need to

maintain effective cooling of the pressure-stressed portions of the
system. Under normal operating conditions the wall of the pressure
vessel is estimated to be no hotter than 1180°F, the lower head 1190°F,
and the upper head 1230°F. A design temperature of 1300°F was taken

in order to provide some additional margin. The low allowable stress

of 2750 psi used for design is based on the long-term creep properties
of the material at 1300°F, but it is to be noted that even at 1800°F
the tensile strength and yield strength of the material are still above
20,000 and 20,000 psi, respectively. This implies that short exposures
to abnormally high temperatures would not produce complete failure of
the equipment.

Estimates of the thicknesses of the material required were based
on standard formulae. 0 In all cases the actual thicknesses used were
greater than those calculated to be required. Estimates of the stresses
at the nozzles were based on early predictions of the forces and moments
imposed by the piping system. 18 Since the calculated stresses were
53

well within the acceptable range, the values were not revised to
correspond with the nozzle reactions obtained by more refined analyses
of the piping systems.

The portions of the reactor pressure vessel receiving special
study were the upper and lower heads, the shell, the inlet nozzle
and flow distributor, and the outlet nozzle. The INOR-8 core grid
support bars were also investigated. Stresses induced by possible
thermal gradients were considered in all cases.

The stresses imposed on the reactor support lug by the support
rod were found to be less than two-thirds of the yield stress but
higher than the allowable two-thirds of the 0.1% CRU (Creep Rate Unit).
As a result, it can be anticipated that a small amount of creep could
occur, increasing the contact area and rapidly lowering the contact
stress to within an acceptable range (see page 48, Ref. 18).

The graphite lattice blocks were designed on the basis of bending
stress estimates at points of maximum moment. The calculated stresses

were less than 100 psi (see page 38, Ref. 18).
5.3.8 Tubes for Neutron Source and Special Detectors

Thimbles are provided in the thermal shield for a neutron source
and for two special neutron detectors for use primarily during the
critical experiments. The inherent source of neutrons in the unirradi-
ated fuel from react ns between the alpha particles emitted by the

uranium, primarily U, and the beryllium, fluorine, and lithium

nuclei will be 3 to 5 x 10° neutrons per second. This is adequate for

 
 

122

safety purposes; but a stronger source is desirable for following the

approach to criticality, and an antimony beryllium or polonium beryllium

neutron source of about 107 neutrons per second will be provided for
this purpose.
The source will be inserted in a thimble made from a 1-1/2-in.

sched-40 pipe, 9-1/2 ft long, located in plug No. 1 in the west-

northwest sector of the thermal shield (see ORNL Drawing E-DD-B-40726).
The source pipe is protected from damage by the 1-in.-diam steel balls

filling the thermal shield by a surrounding half-section of 8-in.
sched-40 stainless steel pipe. The location in the thermal shield
was chosen because the temperature will be low, so any standard
source can be used without concern for its thermal properties. The
source is on the opposite side from the nuclear instrument thimble

and near the inner wall of the thermal shield. The source will be

placed in a cage and will be lowered or raised by a simple arrangement

of a small, braided, wire cable fastened to the cage and extended to
the operating floor level.

The two tubes for the special neutron detectors are similar to
the source tube but are 2-in. sched-10 pipe and are located in the
northeast and southeast sectors of the thermal shield. The chambers
in these tubes are intended for use only during the critical experi-
ments and the early power experiments.

Use of the neutron source during startup of the reactor is dis-
cussed in detail in Part III and Part VIII. The fission chamber

instrumentation is described under Instrumentation, Part II.

5.3.9 Support

The reactor vessel is supported from the top removable cover of
the thermal shield by twelve hanger-rod assemblies. As shown in Fig.
5.19, the bottoms of these assemblies are pinned to lugs welded to
the reactor vessel just above the flow distributor. The tops of the
assemblies are pinned to the support plates in the cover. The cover
is supported by the thermal shield assembly, which, in turn, rests
on the I-beams of the major support structure in the containment

vessel. The thermal shield will be described subsequently in Section
5.3.11,

Since the reactor vessel is not accessible when in position inside (=
the thermal shield, the vessel will be attached to the thermal shield
cover in a job outside the reactor cell. All adjustments, attachment
of thermocouples, etec., including final inspection, will be completed
before the reactor and cover assembly is lowered into position. Maint-
enance on the reactor, other than that which can be accomplished
through the reactor access nozzle, requires lifting of the cover and
the attached reactor from the reactor cell.

The twelve hanger rods are 1-1/4 in. in diameter and about 24 in.
long. They are threaded for 3 in. on each end (opposite hands) with
1-1/2-in. 6-NC threads, and are fabricated of INOR-8. A hex section |
in the center is for applying a wrench in the turnbuckle arrangement
to level the reactor and to distribute the load evenly between the
hanger rods.

The support brackets, or lugs, welded to the reactor vessel,
are fabricated of INOR-8 and are, for the most part, of 3/h-in.
plate. The centerline of the pin hole is about 1-3/8 in. from the
wall of the vessel. The pin is 1-1/4 in. in diameter and is made of
INOR-8 (see ORNL Drawing D-BB-B-4OLOT).

The support arrangement is such that the reactor vessel can be
considered to be anchored at the support lugs. The portion of the
vessel below this elevation is free to expand downward on a temperature
rise with essentially no restraint. Expansion of the portion above
the elevation of the support lugs creates forces and moments on the ¥
connecting piping which are considered in the flexibility analysis
of the piping, as discussed in Section 5.6.2, following. <

The temperature and stress distributions in the hanger rods were
estimated using derived equations and analog computer solutions. t?27
The reactor vessel and contents weigh about 30,000 1b, giving a static
stress of about 2000 psi per rod. The top end of the rods are cooled
by conduction to the water-cooled thermal-shield cover and are assumed
to be at about 200°F. Assuming the lower end of the rods to be at a
maximum of 1250°F, and the gamma heating to be a maximum of 0.23 w/ce,
the combination of the thermal stress due to the temperature gradient ) -

and the static load is a maximum at the cool end. This value is T7350 =’

psi and is well within the allowable stress of 24,000 psi for INOR-8
at 200°F. At the hot end the estimated combined stress is ~2700 psi,
which is within the allowable stress of 3500 psi at 1300°F. The
maximum temperature occurs about 1/2 in. from the reactor vessel and is
estimated to be about 1280°F; the combined stress at this point was

determined to be 2500 psi.

5.3.10 Thermal Shield
The primary functions of the thermal shield, which might be more

properly called the "internal shield," are to reduce the radiation
damage to the reactor containment vessel and to cell equipment, to
serve as part of the biological shielding, and to provide a support for
the reactor vessel. It is estimated that the thermal shield reduces
the total neutron dosage inside the containment vessel by a factor of
about 10% and attenuates the gamma irradiation by a factor of about 10°.

The shield is a water-cooled, steel- and water-filled container
completely surrounding the reactor vessel. A general exterior view of
the thermal shield before installation is shown in Fig. 5.20.

The shield is about 10.4 ft OD by 7.8 ft ID and 12.5 ft high overall.
The 14-in.-wide annular space is filled with l-in.-diam carbon steel
balls. The shield cooling water circulates through the interstitial
spaces. Including the l-in.-thick plate, of which the thermal shield
is primarily constructed, the shield is 16 in. thick, 50% of which is
iron and 50% is water. Type 304 stainless steel is used as the con-
struction material because fast neutron irradiation of the inner wall
could raise the nil ductility. temperature (NDT) of carbon steel above
the operating temperature in less than one year of full-power operation.
The support structure, however, is constructed of carbon steel. The
weight of the complete thermal shield, including the water, is esti-
mated to be about 125 tons. The cooling-water system is designed to
remove about 600 kw of heat, but the actual cooling load 1s estimated
to be considerably less than this.

Six separate pieces make up the thermal shield assembly: ‘the base,

the cylindrical section, three removable sections, or plugs, and the

removable top cover. The plugs fill the slots in the cylindrical section

through which the reactor fill and drain line, the fuel-salt inlet line

to the reactor, and the fuel-salt outlet line must pass as the reactor
is lowered into position. The base and cylindrical section are per-
manently installed in the reactor cell. [See ORNL Dwgs E-BB-D-40729
(elev), E~BB-D-40730 (plan), and E-BB-D-40T2k (assembly and sections]

5.3.10.1 Structural. The base is essentially a flat, rectangular
tank about 18 in. deep which rests on a grid of radial beams at the
bottom of the reactor cell (see ORNL Dwg. E-KK-D-40723). The base
supports the entire thermal shield and the reactor vessel and is the
anchor point in the fuel piping system. The base is welded to the
radial support beams to prevent shifting. The base contains fifteen
8-in., 20-1b/ft, wide-flange, carbon steel I-beams (ASTM A-36) arranged
in two layers, with the six beams in the bottom layer at right angles
to the nine beams in the top layer. The beams are welded to each other
at all intersections and to the 3/4-in.-thick 30L stainless steel top
and bottom plates, the former being accomplished by 2-in.-diam plug
welds on about 15-in. centers. The 3/L-in.-thick 304 stainless steel
side plates are welded to the ends of the support grid beams.

Attached to, and part of, the base is a vertical section formed to
fit the inside curvature of the bottom hemispherical head of the reactor
cell vessel. The outer hemispherical plate, the inner semicircular
plate, and the inner conical-shaped "skirt" plate of this vertical pro-
jection are l-in.-thick 304 stainless steel. The projection is internally
reinforced with six 3/L-in.-thick radial web plates.

The cylindrical section is fabricated of l-in.-thick 304 stainless
steel and is 151 in. high, 125 in. OD, and 93 in. ID. The 1h-in,-wide
annulus is divided into 30° segments by twelve l-in.-thick radial
reinforcing web plates. The plates are perforated with 2-in.-diam
holes in a pattern to promote efficient circulation of the cooling
water. The annulus is filled with approximately 70 tons (475 £87) of
l-in.-diem carbon steel balls, around which the cooling water circulates.

A large cutout in the bottom of the cylinder fits over the vertical
projection on the base, mentioned above. The cylinder is slotted in
three places to accommodate the reactor fuel-salt inlet (line 102),
the fuel-salt outlet (line 100), and the reactor fill and drain line
(line 103). A 37-1/b-in.-ID pocket is provided in the side of the

 
 

 

 

128

cylinder for the neutron instrument tube. At two points near the

inner surface of the thermal shield, at about the northeast and south-
east positions, 2-in. sched-10 pipes about 10 ft long are mounted
vertically to serve as thimbles for the special neutron detector instru-
mentation. These tubes extend about 8 in. above the top of the thermal
shield. The portion of the thimble inside the shield is separated

from the l-in. steel balls by a semicircular section of 8-in. pipe.

A similar arrangement at the west-northwest position, but using a
1-1/2-in. sched-40 pipe, serves as the neutron source tube (see

Section 5.3.8).

The three plugs that slip vertically into the slots in the
cylindrical portion are primarily constructed of l-in.-thick 30k
stainless steel plate. The portions that fit over the fuel inlet and
outlet lines include semicircular sections of 20-in. pipe. The plugs
are also filled with 1l-in.-diam carbon steel balls. Each plug is pro-
vided with 1/2-in. sched-LO cooling-water connections at the top,
the inlet pipe dipping on the inside to near the bottom of the plug.

The thermal shield cover is fabricated of l-in.-thick 304 stain-
less steel plate and is about 79-3/4 in. OD by 16 in. thick. A
22-5/8-in.-diam hole through the center is provided by a 22-in.-long
section of 24-in. sched-40 pipe; the reactor access nozzle passes
through this opening. The cover is divided into 30° segments by twelve
l-in.-thick radial reinforcing web plates. These plates project beyond
the circumference of the cover for about 4 in. and rest on the top
surface of the cylindrical portion. The projections, which carry the
weight of the cover and the reactor vessel, are reinforced with 3/8 in,
plate on each side to give each a total bearing surface about 1-3/L in.
wide by 4 in. long. The web plates are perforated with 3/k-in.-diam
holes spaced to promote efficient circulation of the cooling water.
Each of the wedge-shaped segments in the cover between the radial
plates contains four l-in.-thick carbon steel plates, spaced about 1l-in.
apart, to serve as shielding.

At the outer circumference of the cover are sixty-three vertical
2-in. pipe penetrations through which the reactor furnace heaters are
inserted (see Section 5.3.11). At about the northwest position on the

 
 

a

129

cover, 2 1/4-in.-thick rolled plate sleeve, 5-3/4 in. ID, provides
access to the heaters at the freeze valve on the drain line, FV-103.
Two nozzles of: 2-in. sched-40 pipe serve as the cooling-water inlet
and outlet connections.

5.3,10.2 Cooling. The thermal shield is cooled by a flow of about
100 gpm of treated water containing potassium nitrite and potassium
borate as corrosion inhibitors. (The treated cooling-water-system
water chemistry is discussed in Section 15.2.3). Water is supplied
to the thermal shield through the 2-1/2-in. line 844k. It flows in
series through the base, the cylindrical portion, and then through
the cover”? At appropriate points, water is withdrawn from the
cylindrical portion in 1/2-in. pipes to flow through one of the three
plugs, after which it returns to the cylindrical portion.

The cooling water enters the base through a 2-1/2-in. pipe on the
north side and flows through the base to the south side and upward
through the vertical projection of the base. The water is then con-
ducted through the 2-1/2-in. line 84lL-A to the bottom of the cylindrical
portion. The water moves around the llh-in.-wide annular space in a
counter-clockwise direction (viewed from above), flowing through 2-in.-
diam holes in the radial web plates, which are spaced to give the great-
est circulation rate near the top of the shield. Three 1/2-in. pipe
connections at the top withdraw some of the water for circulation
through the plugs, after which it is returned to the cylindrical
portion (see ORNI, E~-BB-D-4OT72k4).

The water leaves the cylindrical part of the thermal shield
through the 2-1/2-in, line 844-B and flows to the cover. The water
flow in the cover is in & counter-clockwise direction (viewed from
above) and follows a serpentine course as a result of the spacing
of the 3/L-1in.-diam holes in the radial web plates (see ORNL Dwg.
E-BB-D-40727). The water leaves the top cover through a 2-1/2-in.
pipe (line 845).

The cooling-water system was designed to remove about 600 kw
(2 x 10° Btu/hr) of heat. At a flow rate of 100 gpm, the temperature
rise of the water flowing through the thermal shield is about 402°F.

In case of loss of water flow, the heat capacity of the material in

 
 

130

the shield is such that the reactor operation could continue at
the 10-Mw reactor power level for about 3 hr before the water tempera-
ture would rise sufficiently to create a vapor pressure exceeding
the design value of 20 psig.
5.3.10.3 Mechanical Design. The vessel was designed in accordance
with the provisions in the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel Code, Section
VIII. 45 I+ was hydrostatically tested at 32 psig at room temperature.
A 1/2-in. relief valve, set at 20 psig, is incorporated in the cooling-
water supply system. As a further protection, the cooling-water circu-
lating pump has a pressure-actuated cutoff switch in the discharge set
at 22 psig.
5.3.10.4 Shielding Considerations. Radiation damage to the steel

in the containment vessel wall is not considered to be a significant

8 n/c me. 2?

 

problem unless the fast neutron (»1 Mev) exposure exceeds 10t
This would be an exposure corresponding to 10 yr of operation at a
10-Mw reactor power level with the containment vessel exposed to a fast
flux of 3 Xx 107 n/n’ -sec. The thermal shield has a total thickness of
16 in, 50% of which is Fe and 50% is HO, a 12-in. gap between the
reactor and the shield, and an estimated escaping neutron flux of about
1.5 x 108 n/cn-sec.”?

The biological shielding required in the roof above the reactor is
not materially reduced by the presence of the thermal shield in that
the aforementioned 22-5/8-in.-diam hole through the center of the
thermal-shield cover permits direct impingement of radiation from the
reactor vessel over a fairly wide area of the roof plugs. The thermal
shield does, however, make an important reduction in the amount of
biological shielding needed at the coolant-salt penetrations of the
containment vessel wall.

As previously stated, the cooling-water system is capable of
removing 600 kw of heat. The nuclear heating in the thermal shield
is expected to contribute to less than 100 kw of heat. The amount of
heat transmitted from the reactor furnace to the thermal shield through

the thermal insulation is estimated to be less than 50 kw.

5.3.11 Heaters
The 11-in.-wide annular space between the thermal insulation on

the inside of the thermal shield and the reactor vessel wall is heated
by electrical resistance-type heaters to form a furnace. A total of
about 68 kw of heat can be supplied by one-hundred twenty six lengths
of 3/8-in. by 0.035-in.-wall-thickness Inconel tubing, each 8 ft 7-1/2
in. to 9 £+ 11 in. long, through which the current is passed (see

ORNL Dwg. E-MM-B-56225). This furnace provides the heat to the reactor
vessel during warmup and maintains the vessel at temperature during
low-power operation.

The reactor furnace heater tubing is in the form of sixty-three
U-tubes, which are arranged in nine removable sections of seven U-tubes
each. Each of the U-tubes is inserted in a 2-in.-OD by 0.065-in,-wall-
thickness 304 stainless steel thimble, which is suspended from the top
cover of the thermal shield. The tops of the thimbles extend about
6 in. above the top cover and are flared to about 2-3/8 in. in diameter
to facilitate insertion of the heater U-tubes. The centers of the
thimbles are about 2.615 in. from each other and about 1-7/8 in. from
the insulation can.

The distance between the centers of the legs of the U-tubes is
3/4 in. The U-tube assemblies are suspended from the junction box
for each assembly. The junction boxes are fabricated of 1ll-gage 30k
stainless steel, are about 4 in. by 4 in. in cross section and about
18 in. long, and are curved longitudinally to the segment of -a circle
about 37-1/2 in. in radius. The junction boxes sit on top of the.
thimbles which pass through the thermal shield cover. Each Junction
box is provided with a lifting bail at the center of gravity to permit
withdrawal of the seven U-tube assemblies as a complete unit.

The seven U-tubes 1n each section are electrically connected in
series so that each junction box has but two electrical power leads.
The lead wire inside the junction box is solid No, 10 Alloy 99 soft-
temper nickel, insulated with fish-spine ceramic beads (Saxonburg
Ceramic Company Part No. P-897). The lead wires are connected to a
male plug mounted on top of the junction box. The matching female
socket is fitted with a lifting bail to facilitate remote manipulation.

 
 

132

The socket is connected by cables to the terminal boxes mounted on
the support structure.

The top 31-1/2 in. of each heater U-tube leg is constructed of
solid Inconel rod, 3/8 in. in diameter, and therefore does not heat
to as high a temperature as the lower tubular portion. The solid rod
is formed at the top to electrically connect the U-tubes in series.

About 27 in. of the upper portion of each U-tube assembly is
stiffened by being incased in a 1-5/8-in.-0D by 0.065-in.-wall-
thickness 304 stainless steel tube. Ceramic insulators (American
Lava Company, Type A) position the U-tube legs within this tube.
Ceramic standoff insulators of the same material are also spaced
at regular intervals along the lower legs of the U-tubes to prevent
their contact with the thimble walls.

The U-tubes in five of the sections are about 12 ft long overall,
including the solid portions, and those in the remaining four sections
are about 1 ft shorter. The short tubes are required in the southwest
quadrant of the furnace where the thermal shield is shortened by the
proximity to the curved wall of the containment vessel. The U-tubes
in each section are staggered in length by ~1/2 in., with the longest
U-tube in the center of the array of seven. This arrangement facili-
tates insertion of the U-tubes into the thimbles.

The electrical input to the reactor furnace heaters is controlled
manually in response to indicated temperature readings. There are
three controllers, each serving three junction boxes, or sections.

The electrical circuits for the power supply to the heaters is described
in Section 19.7. The reactor heaters are not connected to the Diesel-
driven emergency power sypply.

The annular space between the reactor furnace and the thermal

shield wall is thermally insulated to a built-up thickness of 6 in.

with "Careytemp 1600°F" block insulation, covered with 16-gage 304
stainless steel sheet, on the side, bottom, and top (see Section 5.6.6.3).

5.4 Fuel Circulation Pump

The fuel-salt circulation pump is a centrifugal sump-type pump
with an overhung impeller. It is driven by a T5-hp electric motor
at ~1160 rpm and has a capacity of about 1200 gpm when operating at
a head of 48.5 ft. The 36-in.-diam pump bowl, or tank, in which the
pump volute and impeller are located, serves as the surge volume and
expansion tank in the primary circulation system. A small tank located
beneath the pump and connected to it through an overflow line provides
additional volume for expansion of fuel under abnormal conditions.

A general description of the pump was given in Section 2.6.2
and Fig. 2.3, which is a simplified cross-sectional drawing of the pump.
Figure 5.21 is an exterior view of the pump. The basic data for the
pump are summarized in Table 5.5. The general location of the fuel
circulation pump and overflow tank within the reactor cell is indi-
cated in Figs. 4.4 and 4.5.

The sampler-enricher system, which can add or withdraw small
quantities of fuel salt from the pump bowl via line 999 is described
in Section 7 and is not included in this discussion of the pump.

All parts of the pump in contact with the fuel salt are fab-
ricated of INOR-8.

The pump is of a design similar to those used extensively at
ORNL for circulation of molten salts and liquid metals. The pump was
first tested at simulated reactor conditions of speed, flow and head using
water in a circulating Loop. 2 It was subsequently tested with molten
salt at reactor conditions, including those of pressure and temperature.

The fuel and coolant-salt pumps were machined and assembled at
the machine shops of the Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge. Castings for the |
volutes and impellers were made at General Alloys Company (Boston) ©
The ASME dished heads for the pump bowls, or tanks, were fabricated
at Lukins Steel Company (Philadelphia) 2 from INOR-8 material furnished
by ORNL. The pump motors were purchased from Westinghouse Electric
Corporation (Buffalo). > The pressure vessels and the seals needed

Testing of the completed pumps was performed by
personnel of the ORNL Reactor Division. Complete assemblies of motors
and rotating parts were provided for four pumps--two for the fuel-
salt system and two for the coolant-salt system--in order to have a
spare pump on hand for each system.

The pressure-containing parts, which include the drive-motor
housing, the bearing housing, pump bowl, lubrication reservoir, lubri-
cant passage, nozzles, the overflow tank, etc., were all designed in
accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel

coat! and Code Interpretation Cases 12708*0 and 1273870

for primary
vessels.

A lubricating-oil system is required for each pump. The oil-
circulation pump, cooler and storage tank, and filter are located
in the secondarily shielded tunnel area outside the reactor cell.

The lubrication system is described in Section 5.4.1.4, following.

In order to prevent salt from getting into the gas and lubricant
passages, etc., on too high a level in the pump bowl, an overflow
pipe leads to a catch tank located directly beneath the pump. This
overflow tank is described in Section 5.4.7.

Other auxiliary systems are the cooling water, which is circulated
in a coil around the pump-motor vessel, the cover gas, and the cooling
gas, which is directed around the exterior of the upper portion of the
pump bowl,

The pump is designed to operate at a synchronous speed of

~1160 rpm. If it proves desirable to conduct experiments in the MSRE

other than design flow rates, the pump speed can be changed by varying
the frequency of the electrical input to the motor through use of a
motor-generator set, which can be brought to the MSRE site and operated

on a truck-trailer unit.

5.4.1 Description

The fuel-salt pump consists of three principal assemblies: (1)
the rotary-element assembly, which includes the rotating shaft and
impeller, the bearing housing and bearings, the shield block, and the
impeller cover plate and upper labyrinth subassembly; (2) the pump
bowl, which contains the volute and has inlet and outlet nozzles;

and (3) the drive-motor assembly.

>t

 
*%

 

137

The motor can be removed by unbolting it from the bearing-housing
upper flange. A splined coupling joins the motor shaft to the pump
drive shaft so that the motor can be withdrawn. The rotary-element
assembly can be removed by unbolting the lower bearing-housing flange
from the pump-bowl flange. Each of the twenty-four bolts in this
flange has an extension with universal joints which allow the bolts
to be turned with simple socket wrenches with extension handles
operated from directly above the unit (see ORNL Dwg. F-RD-9830-F).*
Both the flanges mentioned above have ring-joint leak-detected closures.
All water cooling lines, gas lines, lubricating-oil lines, etc., which
serve the removeable motor and rotary-element assemblies, have special
disconnect couplings to facilitate disengagement using remotely
operated tooling.

5.4.1.1 Rotary-Element Assembly. The rotary-element assembly
consists of the 347 stainless steel bearing housing, which is about
8 in. in diameter by 23 in. long and has a 29-1/2-in.-diam flange at
the upper end and a 23-in.-diem flange at the lower end. The pump shaft,

 

which is ~3 in. in diameter by 48 in. long, passes through this
housing and is supported by ball bearings. The upper bearing is an
SKF-T317BG angular contact type in a face-to-face duplex configuration
which absorbs both radial and thrust forces. The lower bearing is an
SK-T7219G angular contact type in a back-to-back duplex configuration
which absorbs radial forces and provides additional stiffness for the
shaft. The impeller is overhung about 22 in. beneath the lower
bearing. Both bearings are lubricated and cooled to an operating
temperature of about 150°F by a k-gpm flow of oil supplied through
line 703 and leaving via line 706. The lubrication system will be
described subsequently in Section 5.4.1.L.

Contact-type seals are located above and below the bearings to
confine the oil to the lubrication system. The seals have stationary
graphitar rings (U. S. Carbon Company) supported on flexible stain-
less steel bellows (Rovertshaw-Fulton Company) that bear against

case-hardened, low carbon steel rings mounted on the pump shaft.

 

*ORNL drawings for the MSRE pumps have a different numbering
system than that used for all other MSRE drawings.

 

 
 

 

138

The seal assemblies were manufactured in the machine shops of the
Y-12 Plant in Oak Ridge. The seals are of the balanced-piston type
and are designed to operate normally with a pressure on the lubricant
side 2 to 8 psi higher than that in the pump bowl, which is at about
5 psig. Under these conditions the lower seal can accept, without
opening, pressure transients in the pump bowl as high as 65 pesia or
as low as 1 psia.

A catch basin located above the coolant passages in the shield
plug (to be described subsequently) collects any lubricant that leaks
past the lower shaft seal. This seepage is conveyed from the reactor
cell Shrough line 524 to an oil catch tank. The gas that accompanies
the oil seepage is disposed of through the off-gas system. The

amount of oil leakage, which is estimated to be less than LO ce/day,

can be measured and compared to the reduction of the oil in the
lubrication system reservoir. At this rate of oil loss the system
could operate for more than a year before an oil addition to the oil

67

reservoir would be necessary. The oil catch tank, however, is
limited 90 days storage capacity for the same leak rate.

The gas pressure on the lubricant (upper) side of the lower shaft
seal is maintained equal to that in the gas space above the oil level
in the lubrication system reservoir located in the tunnel area by
interconnection through the breather pipe (line 590). The gas pressure
on the lower side of this seal is that of the helium cover gas in
the pump bowl, or normally about 5 psig.

Helium gas is introduced into the pump-shaft annulus Just below
the lower shaft seal through line 516 at a maximum rate of 0.084 scfm.
A small part of this gas flows out through line 524 to prevent migration
of oil vapor to the fuel salt in the pump bowl; the remainder flows
down the annulus to prevent the migration of radioactive gases and
particulates from the salt region into the lower shaft-seal areal and
serves as the main flow of sweep gas for removal of fission product
gases from the pump bowl. The pressure drop in the gas flow through
the pump from line 516 to 524 is about 0.25 in. H;0 at design flow
conditions. The offgas system will be described subsequently in
Section 12.

An INOR-8 shield block, which is 13 1/2 in. in diameter by ~8 in.
thick and has a hole at the center for the pump shaft, is bolted to
the bottom of the lower bearing housing flange. This block provides
some shielding for the oil in the bearing housing and for the pump
motor against irradiation by the fuel salt in the pump bowl. It is
withdrawn as part of the rotary element assembly. The block is
cooled by an 8-gpm flow of oil supplied through line 704 and leaving
with the lubricating oil through line 706. The cooling oil flows
through grooves 1/4 in. deep by 3/4 in. wide, spiraling from the
3 in. to 10 1/2 in. in diemeter on the upper surface of the plug.

The estimated heat to be removed to maintain the lower shaft seal
temperature to an acceptable value is about 18,000 Btu/hr. ©

The 11.5-in.-diam impeller is keyed to the lower end of the
INOR 8 pump shaft and retained by a bolt tack welded in place. A
slinger ring is located on the shaft just above the impeller.

The pump shaft speed is sensed continuously with a magnetic
reluctance pickup (Electro Point 721280) utilizing an interrupter
gear that is integral with the lower portion of the shaft coupling
(see ORNL Dwg. F-9830-62). The output of this pickup (SI FP-E) is
transmitted to a speed indicator, the control circuit and alarm
system, and to the data logger. The direction of rotation can also
be sensed by the pickup.

Labyrinth-type seals are used on the impeller inlet shroud
(lower labyrinth) and on the impeller support shroud (upper labyrinth)
as shown in Fig. 5.22. The upper labyrinth is integral with the
impeller cover plate, which is sealed to the volute with a 1/4-in. OD
INOR-8 O-ring about 12.75 in. ID. Labyrinth seals are also pro-
vided on the shaft at each of the aforementioned contact seal assemblies.

5.4.1.2 Pump Bowl. The pump bowl, or tank, is about 36 in. in
diameter and 17 in. high at the centerline. It is formed of two INOR-8
ASME dished heads with a wall thickness of 1/2 in. The normal fuel salt
level in the bowl is about 11 in. from the bottom, measured at the
centerline.

The pump volute is an Allis-Chalmers 8- by 6-in. Type SSE (Allis-
Chalmers Dwg. 52-423-L98) with 5/8-in. wall thickness. The 8-in.-IPS

sched-L40 inlet nozzle on the bottom of the bowl is concentric with
the centerline of the pump. The volute entry nozzle and the impeller
inlet opening are also 8 in. in diameter. The pump discharge from
the volute is through a special thimble, 5 in. ID by 7 in. long, having
spherically shaped ends. (See ORNL Dwg. D-2-02-054-10065-A). The
spherical portions fit into similarly shaped seats in the volute and
in the pump-bowl discharge nozzle (see Fig. 5.22). This bridge tube
provides the flexibility needed to absorb the three-dimensional
relative motions between the volute and the bowl and at the same time
allows only a small bypass flow through the joints back into the pump
bowl.

A second bypass flow, called the "fountain flow,’

t

escapes through
the clearance between the top side of the impeller and the pump casing,
and thence through the clearance between the pump shaft and the pressure
breakdown bushing. With the clearances shown in Fig, 5.22, the fountain
flow is estimated to be about 15 gpm (ref 60, p 27).

A third bypass flow, termed the "stripper flow," of about 60 gpm
is taken from the pump-bowl discharge nozzle into a ring of 2-in.-diam
pipe encircling the vapor space inside the pump bowl on a radius of
about 15-1/2 in. This distributor has regularly spaced holes, half about
1/16 in, and half 1/8 in. in diameter, oriented about 30° from the
horizontal and pointing downward toward the center of the pump bowl.
The holes are about 1 in. above the normal fuel-salt level in the bowl.
The bypass flow is sprayed from these holes into the bowl £o- promote
the release of fission product gases to the vapor space. The efficiency
of this stripping action is estimated to be sufficient to reduce the
135%e poison level in the reactor to less that 2% in Ak/k. The in-
fluence of residence-time Si strivution on fission product decay in the

pump bowl was investigated,’ and the efficiency of xenon removal and the

effectiveness of the purge gas system were studied prior to completion

TL,72

of the pump design. . The same spray holes serve as vents for the
gas in the pump discharge (line 101) during preoperational filling
of the system with molten salt. This gas, after venting into the bowl,

is withdrawn through line 521.

 
 

142

The bypass flows circulate downward through the pump bowl and re-
enter the impeller. The spray entrains a considerable volume of cover
gas in the liquid, and the tendency for this entrainment to enter the
pump is largely controlled by a baffle on the volute. Tests indicated
that the liquid returning to the impeller will contain 1 to 2 vol %
of gas.

A 1-1/2-in. vertical sched-40 nozzle is provided at the top of
the pump bowl to allow a capsule to be lowered into the salt in the
bowl to take a sample or to add small amounts of enriched fuel. A cap-
sule guide and latch stop inside the pump bowl positions the sample
capsule.”? The sampler-enricher system is described in Section 7.

The liquid Level in the pump bowl is sensed by bubbler-type probes.
One of the 1/2-in.-IPS bubbler tubes (line 596) extends about 3-7/8 in.
below the centerline of the pump volute, or a min. of 6-1/8 in. below
the salt level in the bowl. The other (line 593) extends to about 1-15/16
in. below the centerline of the volute. A third 1/2-in. connection
(line 592) at the top of the pump bowl provides the reference pressure
as helium gas is bubbled through the two tubes. Through previous cali-
bration, the helium pressures can be converted to liquid level; also
the difference in pressure between the two probes at different levels
may possibly be translated into approximate salt densities. The
bubbler system is further described in Section 10.9.1.

A pump-bowl overflow pipe (line 520) releases salt to the overflow
tank in event the salt level in the circulation system becomes too
high.”

The lower portion of the pump bowl is cooled by the flow of fuel
salt. Above the liquid level, however, heat produced at a rate of about
15 kw through beta and gamma absorptions would tend to overheat the
metal and would cause undesirably high thermal stresses unless cooling
is provided. The top portion of the bowl is fitted with a shroud
that is spun from 305 stainless steel and is about 38 in. in diameter;
a space l/h in. to 1 in. wide is provided between the shroud and the
pump-bowl surface through which cooling gas can be directed (see ORNL
Dwg. E-4T7296). The estimated quantity of cooling gas (95% No» 5% 0,)
required is about L400 cfm (stp). ™*

5.4.1.3 Drive Motor. The pump drive motor is a Westinghouse
totally enclosed, water-cooled, explosion-proof, NEMA Design "B,"
special-purpose, squirrel-cage induction motor of T5-hp capacity.

It is rated at 480 v and normally has a starting (locked rotor)
current demand of 450 amp. The starting torque is slightly less than
135% of full-load torque, and the pull-out torque is slightly less
than 200% of the full-load torque.

It is planned that the motor will normally run at synchronous
speed of 1160 rpm. Operation at different speeds can be obtained
by varying the frequency of the electric power supply through use of
a motor-generator set which can be brought to the MSRE site.

The drive motor is directly connected to the pump shaft through
a modified flexible coupling (Thomas Flexible Coupling Company Cat.

No. 263 DBZ; also see ORNL Dwg. D-2-02-054-9848). This type of
coupling does not require lubrication. The motor shaft is splined
to slip into the coupling to facilitate removal of the motor.

The electrical insulation used in the motor is Class "H", designed
for 150°F ambient conditions and a radiation dosage of 2 x 107 r before
mechanical breakdown and a total dosage of 2 x 10%° r before electrical
breakdown!” (also, see ref 66, p 52). The background radiation in the
region of the pump motor was estimated to be in the order of 10° 5
red/br. T° A three-conductor, mineral-insulated, copper-covered cable
connects the motor to a three-prong plug that can be inserted into a
receptacle by a remotely operated manipulator tool of the type described
in Section 19.7.5. The electrical lead seal through the pressure-tight
motor housing is a ceramic type.

The motor housing, or can, is surrounded by a water coil through
which about 5 gpm of treated, demineralized water is introduced through
the 1-in. sched-40 pipe (line 830) and leaves through line 83. The
11/16-in. OD x 1/16-in. wall thickness stainless steel tubing is
heliarc welded to the can using stainless steel filler rod.

The lower end of the motor casing is flanged and is bolted to the
top flange of the bearing-housing assembly by use of a ring-joint leak-
detected type of closure. The motor casing is fabricated of ASTM A-201

Grade A carbon steel to meet the requirements of the ASME Boiler and

5.4.1.4 Lubricating-0il System. The oil system serves to lubri-

 

cate and cool the pump bearings and to cool the shield plug located
between the bearings and the pump bowl. The fuel-salt pump and the coolant
salt pump have separate lubricating-oil systems, but they are intercon-
nected so that one system could serve both pumps in an emergency situation.
Each lubricating-oil system consists basically of a water-cooled oil
reservoir, two centrifugal pumps connected in parallel, and an oil filter
as shown in the lubrication system flowsheet, Fig. 5.23 (ORNL Dwg. D-AA-
A-40885). The equipment is located in the east tunnel (see Fig. L4.k),
which is a secondarily shielded area. The design data for the lubrication
system are presented in Table 5.6.
The lubricating oil is a turbine-grade, paraffinic base, 100%
straight mineral oil having a viscosity at 100°F of 66 SSU. Other
lubricating-o0il properties are shown in Table 5.7. The lubricating-
oil specifications are discussed in reference 77. Investigation of
the oil temperature after cessation of the oil flow in an accidental
situation determined that the temperature would not exceed about 500°F,
the approximate condition at which oil damage would become appreciable,
until about 10 min after the oil flow stopped. [0
The oil reservoir is a carbon steel tank, 22 in. in diameter by 32
in. high, with ASME dished heads 1/4 in. thick. The tank is surrounded
by eight turns of a water-cooled coil of 1l-in.-diam copper tubing. The .
required water flow rate is about 10 gpm of 85°F water. The -inside
surface of the tank is provided with passageways, about 2 in. by 3/8 in., =
to direct a 50-gpm bypass flow of oil from the pump against the tank
wall at an average velocity of about 21 fps. The overall heat-transfer
coefficient is estimated at 230 Btu/hr-ft2-°F, and the maximum heat-
removal rate at 41,000 Btu/hr (see ref 66, p 57).
The oil reservoir is provided with a liquid-level indication,
LI-OTT, the output of which is fed to the data logger and the alarm
system. In event of a drop in oil level, indicating an oil leak past
the lower shaft seal of the pump, the flow control valve FSV-703 auto-
matically stops the flow of oil to the pump. Alarms are also provided “

for high oll temperature, low oil flow rates, or high lube oil pump
motor temperature.

A blanket of helium gas 1s maintained over the oil in the reservoir
tank. The helium supply line (line 513) and the off-gas vent (line 535)
are provided with pressure-control valves (PCV-513% A-1 and A-2) to
maintain the gas pressure at about 7 psig. The gas flow rate is
essentially zero. The top of the oil reservolr tank is vented to the
bearing housing on the fuel pump through line 590. The helium pressure
above the salt in the pump bowl is about 5 psig.

Two 5-hp Allis-Chalmers "Electric-Cand" centrifugal oil pumps,

2 x1,5, type MH, are connected in parallel, either one of which has
sufficient capacity if used alone. The pump motor is cooled by a
small internal by-pass oil stream. About 50 gpm of the pump output
is returned to the oil reservoir as a bypass flow to promote heat
transfer at the tank wall.

The oil filter is a standard Cuno EFS filter using carbon steel
filter elements.

Radiation monitors (RIA-OTI) are located in each lubrication
system to detect contamination of the oil or the blanket helium gas,
The lubricating-oil system equi pment is compactly arranged into a
"package" which can be conveniently shielded with lead bricks. The
valves have extension handles passing through the lead shield.
Sampling nozzles are located on oil lines external to the package for
periodic sampling of the oil for both radiation and thermal damage.

5.4.1.5 0il Catch Tank. Lubricating oil seeping past the lower
shaft seal of the pump is piped from the reactor cell through 1/2-in.
line 524 to an oil catch tank located in the special equipment room.
The portion of the line inside the reactor cell is shielded to reduce
the amount of induced activity in the oil. The catch tank is fabri-
cated of a 46-1/2-in.-long section of 2-in. sched-Lo pipe topped
by a 20-in.-long section of 8-in. sched-40 pipe. The top portion
catches gross leakage while the lower portion, holding 0.7 gal, pro-
vides sensitivity for a level indicator, LIA-524. This level instru-
ment, and those on the lubricating-oil supply tanks, provide for close
inventory of the lubricating oil. Details of the tank are shown on

ORNL Dwg. E-GG-C-41518.

The rate of oil loss from the system is estimated to be less
than LO cc/any. In event the oil catch tank cannot hold the accumu-
lated oil for a satisfactory operating period, a 55-gal stainless steel
drum is provided in the coolant drain cell to which the catch tank can
be drained through line 720 during reactor shutdown. This drum may
vent through the valve to the off-gas system through line 525 during
draining.

A small amount of helium gas leaves the pump with the oil. A
capillary flow restrictor in the gas line downstream of the oil catch
tank limits the flow to less than 0.07 liters/min. This restrictor is
preceded by a sintered disc filter, and followed by a flow indicator,
FIA-524. Line 524 continues as 1/2-in. pipe through the coolant salt
drain cell to the vent house instrument box. The gas is vented through

the off-gas system described in Section 12 following.

5.4.2 Hydraulics
The MSRE fuel-salt pump has an 8-in. by 6-in. volute-impeller

combination. These sizes were selected on the basis that this provided
a reasonable hydraulic capability and were sufficiently standard so
that existing patterns could be used in making the INOR-8 impeller and
volute castings.

Hydraulic performance data were determined on prototype pumps
over a wide range of flow and head conditions and at several speeds,
using 1l1-in.- and 13%-in.-diam impellers. A design pump speed of
1150 rpm was selected, and the impeller diameter was established as
11-1/2 in. The hydraulic performance data are summarized in Fig. 52k.
It may be noted that at the design speed of 1150 rpm and design flow
rate of 1200 gpm the developed head is 48.3 ft. The pump efficiency
under these conditions is 80-85%.

The flow startup times for the primary circulation system were
estimated using assumed motor accelerating torques (which are nearly
constant up to about 60% of speed), and it was found that 50% of full
flow is attained after about 3/4 sec, T5% after 1-1/4 sec, 90% after
1-3/4 sec, and 100% is reached in about 3 sec. 2

Coastdown tests determined that about 10 sec are required for the
pump motor to stop after the electrical supply is interrupted (see
ref 80 p 47 and ref 60 p 31).

Tests of the prototype pump (with 13-in,-diam impeller) indicated
that when the liquid level in the pump was lowered to 4-1/2 in. below
the centerline of the volute, increased amounts of entrained gas were
present in the pump discharge. At about 5-1/2 in. below the volute
centerline, the-system flow was cut about in half; and at 6-1/2 in.,
the flow was reduced essentially to zero (ref 60, p 31).

The prerotation baffle shown in Fig. 2.3 at the pump inlet has
the effect of increasing the head at the lower range of flows when
operating at a constant speed (ref 60, p 15).

At the most efficient operating conditions, when the various losses
in the impeller and volute are at a minimum, the pressure distribution
in the volute is essentially uniform, and the net radial force on the
impeller is near zero. When operating at higher or lower flow rates
at the same pump speed, the volute pressure distribution becomes non-
uniform and produces a radial force on the impeller and a resulting
deflection of the shaft. (The impeller is overhung about 22 in. below
the lower bearing.) Tests of the prototype MSRE fuel pump indicated
that a running clearance of 0.025 in. in the lower labyrinth (see Fig.
5.22) would provide for all reasonably anticipated conditions of "off-

design" operation of the pump. BL

5.4.3 Mechanical Design Considerations

Design of the rotary elements involved computation of shaft stresses,
deflections, natural frequency, bearing life expectancy, flange bolting
requirements, etc. Design of the pump bowl, or tank, required calcu-
lation of the wall thickness, stresses, the flange requirements, and
the reinforcement needed &t nozzles, etc.

5.4.3.1 Volute and Impellers. The maximum stress in the volute

 

will be at shutoff flow conditions at 1160 rpm and is estimated to be
2560 psi in bending (ref 66, p 21). The maximum impeller stress is
at the keyways and is estimated to be about 2000 psi.
5.4.3.2 Shaft. The impeller horsepower at rated conditions is
47.5 hp, based on a pump efficiency of 80% and a pump speed of 1150

 
 

 

 

152

rpm. Assuming a radial thrust on the impeller of 195 1b, (see Section
5.4.2), the net axial thrust is 1130 1b, downward. Some of the calcu-
lated stresses are summarized in Table 5.8 (ref 66, pp 28-30).

The maximum shaft deflection at the end of the impeller was esti-
mated to be 0.0110 in., based on the above-mentioned radial thrust
(ref 66, p 31).

The natural frequency of the shaft was predicted to be at 2850 rpm,
which is well above the design operating speed of 1160 rpm (ref 55, p 33).

5.4.3.3 Bearings. The SKF catalog data were adjusted for MSRE

q

operating conditions, and a life expectancy of 300,000 to 500,000 hr for

h

the pump bearings was predicted (ref 66, p 32).
5.4.3.4 Pump Bowl and Nozzles. Using standard equations from the
ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code, Section VIII," the wall thickness

tr

required for the pump-bowl ASME torisphericel heads was determined to .
be 0.438 in.; based on an allowable stress for the INOR-8 of 3600 psi.
The actual thickness used is 1/2 in. (ref 66, pp 16-21).
A reinforced area is provided at the 8-in. suction-nozzle opening
to provide material in excess of 140% of that needed to maintain the
stresses within the allowable limits. The 1-1/2-in. sched-L0 fuel-
sampling-enricher nozzle is also reinforced. The discharge nozzle
requires an elliptical opening 6 in. by 7 in. The weld fillet in the
knuckle region at this nozzle is enlarged to provide some excess re-
inforcement. The upper nozzle is 13.625 in. ID and does not require %
extra reinforcement (ref 66, pp 16-21). .

The stress in the pump bowl due to the discharge nozzle reaction

©

was determined to be of little concern. The stress in the 23-in.-diam
pump-bowl flange, which is designed for 50 psi and 300°F, were found
to be about 13,290 psi, using standard methods of combining stresses
(ref 66, p 23). Stresses in the pump bowl due to axial loading only
were analyzed and found to be about 5000 pei. 52

The bearing-housing upper flange, which is 27-1/2 in. -in diameter
and has an assumed operating temperature of 150°F, has calculated

5.4.4 Thermal-Stress Design Considerations

The MSRE fuel pump is subjected to relatively high thermal stresses
at operating conditions because nuclear heating can raise the tempera-
ture of some parts above the 1225°F inlet salt temperature and because
of the relatively large temperature gradient between these parts and,
say, the top flange of the pump, which is only at about 180°F. The
cyclic nature of these stresses as the reactor power level is varied
requires that they be evaluated on a strain - fatigue basis to determine
the extent of relief that can be expected due to thermal relaxation in
the materials.

The temperature distributions in the pump bowl were calculated for
various conditions of reactor power, salt temperature, and cooling-gas
flow over the outside top portion of the bowl, using the Generalized
Heat Conduction Code (car)®? (see also ref 66, p 36). The thermal-
stress distributions were calculated for heatup from room temperature
to 1200°F, power changes from zero to 10 Mw, and loss of cooling gas,
using the general procedures of Stanek 8d and wit£50787 In these
studies it was assumed that the MSRE would undergo one hundred heatup
cycles and five hundred power-change cycles. It was further assumed
the allowable number of cycles as determined from the fatigue curves for
INOR-8 should exceed the anticipated number of cycles by a factor of at
least 1.25. The estimated thermal-fatigue life was found to be adequate,
and the calculation indicated that the cooling-gas flow rates could be
varied over a broad range with small effect. oO (See also ref 66, p 37) .

The sampler-enricher connection line (line 999) to the fuel pump
bowl is subjected to thermal stresses due to the axial temperature =
gradient in the line and also to the pump movements caused by the thermal
expansions in the primary circulation system. The stresses caused by
the piping reactions in the sampler line were estimated to be 7580 psi
in bending and 1940 psi in shear. These stresses were combined with
the pipe reaction stresses and compared to the strain-cycle data. A
usage factor of 0.367 was obtained, which provides a margin of safety
greater than two when compared to the maximum permissible value of 0.8

89 =

for the usage factor.

5.4.5 Pump Supports

To provide the flexibility needed in the primary-circulation-system
piping to maintain the stresses within the allowable limits, it is
necessary that the heat exchanger and the fuel-salt pump be allowed to
move in certain directions as the system is heated. (The reactor is
fixed in position and an anchor point for the piping.)

Because of the degrees of freedom needed, and the amount of expected
movement, the fuel-pump support equipment is relatively complicated (see
Fig. 5.25). The fuel pump is bolted to a 2-1/2-in.-thick plate that is
mounted on two sets of 2-in.-diam rollers, allowing the pump to move
in a horizontal plane. (See ORNL Dwgs. E-CC-C-41450 and D-CC-C-41511).
The rollers travel on a spring-supported parallel-iink framework that

permits the pump to rise vertically from the cold to the hot position.

The pump is restrained from rotation about any axis. Three 3-3/h-in.-

diam by 4-in. stainless steel, NaK-filled, double bellows, with orifice

plates between the bellows, act to dampen the vibrations induced by the

pump-shaft rotation. The entire pump assembly is carried by two 8-in.

horizontal I-beams . 2°
When the primary system is brought up to operating temperature,

the pump moves about 0.4 in. horizontally in the north-south direction, |

about 0.3 in. in the east-west direction, and about 0.8 in. vertically.

As stated above, there is no rotation of the pump assembly.

5.4.6 Heaters

The lower half of the pump bowl, a 3-ft-long section of suction
piping and the 5-in. 90° bend at the bottom of the piping section,
and the overflow tank are all heated in a common furnace, which is
about 51 in. OD by 66 in. high.

The heating elements are 3/h-in.~diam straight tubes of - stain-
less steel, containing ceramic-positioned resistance heating elements
at the lower ends and having the trade name "Firerod" (Watlow Manu-
facturing Company). Five of the rods are about 8 ft long overall,
with a heated length of about 5 ft, which extend all the way from
the terminal boxes to the bottom of the basket. Nine of the rods are
about 7 ft long with a heated length of 4 ft. The heater rods slide

into 1-in.OD 304 stainless steel tubes (0.065 in. wall thickness).
(See ORNL Dwg. E-MM-B-51604).

The long and short heater rod are arranged, with but one exception,
into removable assemblies of one long rod and two short ones. Each of
these groups of three rods has a terminal box, or housing, at the upper
end which has a lifting ball, and in which the electrical power and
thermocouple connections are made at a terminal block. The nine shorter
heater rods, called the "upper portion," are connected as one electrical
circuit and have a total heating capacity of 6.5 kw. The five long rods,
or "lower portion," are another circuit and have a capacity of 12 kw.

The 51-1/2-in.-0OD furnace has a 5-in.-thick layer of "Careytemp
1600°F" block insulation (Philip Carey Manufacturing Company), covered
with 20-gage 304 stainless steel sheet, The bottom of the furnace is
similarly insulated and covered. The top insulation is 2-1/2 in. of
"Fiberfrax" blanket, "Type XIM," and is also covered with stainless
steel sheet. The top of the insulated portion of the basket is Just
below the bottom of the cooling-gas shroud on the top half of the pump
bowl. Gas for cooling the overflow tank can be supplied through a pipe
at the bottom of the furnace although such cooling should not be
necessary. Supports for the tanks pass through insulated sleeves and
bellows in the bottom also. (See ORNL Dwg, E~-MM-B-51606).

The furnace is suspended from the fuel-pump support plate and moves
with the pump. The heater rods have collars which also rest on the
support plate.

The terminal box for the three rods in each group is connected
by three No. 12 wires with insulating beading to a 30-8, 600-v, 3-pole
mele plug provided with a lifting bail. This plug can be pulled upward
by remotely operated tools from the female unit located on the support
structure to disconnect the heater wiring for removal of a heater unit
or for other maintenance operations. The power input to each heater
circuit is manually controlled in response to the temperature-indicat-
ing instrumentation. - The heater control circuits are described in

Section 19.

5.4.7 PFuel-Pump Overflow Tank
Abnormally high salt levels in the fuel-pump bowl might result from

rp,

overfilling, from temperature excursions while operating, or from un-
usually high gas entraimment in the circulating salt. An overflow pipe
and catch tank prevent the salt level from becoming high enough to allow
salt to enter the gas and lubricant passages of the pump.
5.4.7.1 Overflow Pipe. The overflow line is a 1-1/2-in. sched-40
INOR-8 pipe passing through the bottom of the pump bowl and extending

“a

to 1-1/2 in. above the normal operating level in the bowl, i.e., to an
elevation of about 840 ft 3 in. The pipe extends downward from the bowl, a
as line 520, and makes three turns in a coil about 29 in. in diameter
before entering the overflow tank located directly beneath the pump
bowl (see ORNL Dwg. E-CC-C-56419). The line is contained entirely
within the pump furnace and does not require a heating jacket.

5.4.7.2 Overflow Tank. The overflow tank is a torus-like vessel
surrounding the tapered section of the pump intake pipe. It is located
entirely within the pump furnace, but is not structurally connected
to it.

The tank is 30 in. OD x 18 in. ID x 27-3/4 in. high overall.
The tank wall thickness is 1/2 in., and the annular space between the
straight walls of the cylindrical portion is 5 in. wide. The ends are

closed with heads dished to a 2.5 in. radius, as shown on ORNL Dwg.
3

D-CC-C-56418. The salt storage volume is 5.4 ft”. The INOR-8 vessel ‘
is designed for a pressure of 50 psig at 1400°F and in accordance with .
the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel Code™’ and Cases 12708-58 and

1273N-7"°. :

The overflow pipe (line 520) enters the top of the tank and dips
to within less than 1/2 in. of the bottom. A 1/2-in.-deep dimple is
pressed in the lower tank head at the exit opening of the overflow
pipe to permit more complete removal of the tank contents.
The liquid level in the tank is measured by two helium bubbler
lines and one reference pressure line in an arrangement similar to that
used in the pump bowl. Helium is supplied through lines 599 and 600
in 1/4 in.-OD tubing enclosed in 1/2-in. sched-40 pipe, the tubing oO

terminating about 15 in. from the overflow tank with the flow continuing -

in the pipe. As in the pump bowl, the helium supply lines have a |
surge volume inside and at the top of the tank in the form of a curved =
portion of 1-1/2-in. pipe. This volume would prevent salt from backing
up into unheated portions of the helium supply lines in event of a
pressure surge in the salt system. The helium bubbler lines dip to
within about 1/2 in. of the bottom of the tank.

The top of the overflow tank is vented to the off-gas system through
a 1/2-in. sched-40 pipe connection, line 523. A 1/4-in.-0D tubing con-
nection (line 589) is made to line 523 to provide the reference pressure
for the bubbler liquid-level indication. Line 523 continues through
the control valve HCV-523, which can be closed to pressurize the over-
flow tank with helium to force the fuel salt from the tank back to
the fuel-pump bowl through line 520. Normally, valve HCV-523 is open
to vent the gases from the upper portion of the overflow tank. Line
523 joins the off-gas line 521 from the fuel-pump bowl upstream of the
holdup volume in the reactor cell.

5.4.7.3 Tank Support. The overflow tank is located directly
beneath the fuel-pump bowl. Three 1/2-in.-diam rods with clevis ends
suspend the tank from the pump support during initial installation or
maintenance operations. Normally, these rods carry no load, and the
tank is supported from below by a flat plate mounted on the lower end
of three 1l-in.-diam 304 stainless steel rods. The plate rests on three '
spring-mounted balls (Mathews Conveyers Company, Type 501) which allow
the tank to move laterally in any direction. While connected to the
fuel pump only through the overflow line, there may be some displace-

ment forces as the pump shifts position with temperature changes. The

B

overflow tank remains at a fixed elevation, the flexibility of the over-
flow pipe accommodating the 0.8-in. Vertical displacement of the fuel-
pump bowl with temperature changes (see ORNL Dwg. D-CC-C-56420).
The three l-in.-diam stainless steel support rods mentioned above
pass through the pump furnace insulation through corrugated stainless
steel bellows welded to the rods at the top of the bellows and with the
bottom of the bellows welded to the furnace casing. The clearance
between the rods and the furnace bottom allows for relative movement of -
the tank within the furnace, and the bellows prevent the chimney effect (-

from inducing a flow of cell atmosphere gas through the furnace.

If the overflow tank must store a large amount of fuel salt that

has a relatively high internal-heat-generation rate, it may be necessary

to cool the overflow tank. A 1-1/2-in. connection is provided at the

furnace bottom through which cell atmosphere gas can be supplied from

the component cooling system. A 3-in.-diam stainless steel bellows in

this connection provides a spring-loading on a sliding metal-to-metal
flat-plate joint to allow relative movement of the furnace and the gas

supply line connection (see ORNL E-CC-C-56419).

5.5 Fuel Heat Exchanger

Ia

The fuel heat exchanger is used to transfer heat from the fuel
salt to the coolant salt. The location of the exchanger in the reactor
containment vessel is shown in Figs. 4.4 and 4.5. The relationship
of the heat exchanger in the primary system flowsheet is discussed in
the preceding Section 5.2 and shown in Fig. 4.6. The physical prop-
erties of the fuel and coolant salts are summarized in Table 2.1.

With the exception of the furnace-brazing of the tube-to-tubesheet

joints, the heat exchanger was fabricated in the machine shops of the t
Y-12 Plant. The furnace-brazing was performed at the Wall Colmonoy 2
Company (Detroit). All this work was covered by ORNL specifications, 293M ; ‘

5.5.1 Description

G4

The heat exchanger is a horizontal, shell and U-tube type, with
the fuel salt circulating in the shell and the coolant salt in the
tubes (see Figs. 2.4 and 5.27). It is of all-welded construction and
is fabricated of INOR-8 throughout, except for the back-braze alloy used
in the tubesheet joints. The overall dimensions and design data are
given in Table 5.9. (See ORNL Dwg. D-EE-Z-40850).

The shell is al6 in. OD and about 8 ft 3 in. long, including the
8-3/L4-in.-long coolant salt header and the ASME flanged and dished
heads at the ends (see ORNL Dwg. D-EE-A-40874). The shell is 1/2 in. .
thick in both the cylindrical portion and the heads. The fuel enters

¢

at the U-bend end of the shell through a 5-in. sched-L40 nozzle, near the
top of the dished head. A 1/k-in.-thick baffle on the inside prevents

direct impingement on the tubes. The fuel salt leaves through a T-in. x

»

5 in. reducer nozzle at the bottom of the shell at the tube-sheet end.
To prevent vibration at the higher flow rates due to the
clearance between the tubes and the baffle plates, INOR-8 rods,
0.166-in. x 1/L4-in., are inserted, or "laced", between the tubes.
The rods are used at each baffle plate, with one set inserted in
the horizontal direction and the other at an angle of 60°. The rods
fit snugly into the spaces between the tubes and effectively restrain
each tube from transverse motion relative to the others. The horizontal ow
rods are tack welded in place at each end. The inclined rods are tack -

welded at least on one end, and on both ends where accessible. The

rods are left out at locations where neither end could be fastened.

For this reason, rods are used in the horizontal direction only at the
stub baffle plate and at the lower portion of the baffle at the fuel
inlet end of the exchanger. The rods at these two locations are
0.171-in. x 1/b-in. ard 0.174-in. x 1/b-in., respectively. The tubes
are also restrained at the U-end of the tube bundle by rods inserted
in two directions through the five outermost rows of tubes. Two l-1/2-
in.-wide INOR bands are used to hold the rods in position. One of the
bands, which is slotted to accept the ends of the rods, is inserted
horizontally into the tube bundle. The other band is wrapped around
the outside and has the ends of the rods tack welded to it. See ORNL
Dwgs 10329-R-001-E and 10329-R-002-E.* Six 25% cut baffles of 1/L-in.
plate, spaced at 12-in. intervals, direct the fuel-salt flow across

the tube bundle (see ORNL Dwg. D-EE-A-LO866). A varrier plate, similar
to the baffle plates but with no cutaway segment, is located 1-7/8 in.
from the tubesheet to provide a more or less stagnant layer of fuel
salt and reduce the temperature difference across the tubesheet. The
baffles and the barrier plate are held in position by spacer rods,
screwed and tack-welded together, to the tubesheet, and to each baffle.

A divider separates the entering and leaving coolant-salt streams
in the coolant header. It is fabricated of 1/2-in. plate and extends
from the tubesheet to the dished head a maximum distance of about 12 in.;
it is welded only to the dished head. It is positioned by guide strips
on the shell wall, and a groove in the edge fits over a 1/4-in. pointed,
horizontal projection on the tubesheet. This arrangement provides a
labyrinth-type seal between the channels without stiffening the tube-
sheet.

The divider prevents use of a horizontal row of tubes at the exact
center of the tubesheet. Also, in arranging the U-tube bundle into a
configuration that could be assembled, it was necessary to leave out
the nine tubes on the horizontal row immediately above and below the
center. These holes are not drilled in the tubesheet. To maintain fuel-
salt velocity distributions in the shell and also to keep the fuel-salt
inventory to a minimum, solid rods of INOR-8, 1/2 in. in diameter, are

used at these locations in the tube bundle.

There are 159 tubes, 1/2 in. OD by 0.042 in. wall thickness,
affording a total heat transfer surface of ~254 ft2, The tubes are
arranged on a 0.775-in. equilaterial triangular pitch. The tube-
sheet is 1-1/2 in. thick. The holes through the tubesheet had
trepanned grooves on both sides of the sheet.

The grooves on the coolant-salt side were to permit the tube-to-
tubesheet welds”? to be made between the tube and a lip of about equal
wall thickness. The groove has an overall depth of 0.090 in., is 0.068
in. wide, and leaves a lip of 0.042 in. (see Fig. 5.28). The tubes
were expanded at the tip end into the holes before welding; after
welding, the tube openings were reamed to the inside diameter of the
tubes. 2° }

The tubesheet holes had trepanned grooves on the fuel-salt side to
permit back-brazing of the joints. These grooves were 0.100 in. deep,
0.100 in. wide, and with a lip of 0.025 in. (ref 94) (see Fig. 5.28).
This groove held an 82% gold - 18% nickel brazing ring prior to furnace-
brazing.” The brazing operation consisted of holding the assembly
between 1850 and 1885°F for 60 min in a hydrogen atmosphere having a
dewpoint temperature below _go°F, and a flow rate of 345 f£t3/hr.

Both the heating rate and the cooling rate for the brazing cycle were
limited to 300°F/hr. Three 3/32-in.-diam equally spaced holes were
drilled from the bottom of the braze-ring trepan to communicate with
the 0.0015 to 0.003-in. annular space between the tube and the tube-
sheet hole, to permit the braze metal to flow into this space during

98

the furnace brazing. An excess of the braze filler metal was
provided to assure complete filling of the void and enough to form a
fillet between the tube wall and the full thickness of the trepan lip.
Visual examination of these fillets after brazing gave an indication
that each braze void was completely fillea.%® There was no apparent

distortion of the tubes, and the metal was bright and clean. Ultra-

sonic inspection by use of a Lamb-wave probe, with a 3/32-in.-diam

flat-bottomed hole as a standard, indicated some porosity but no open
channels in the brazed joints.

After fabrication the unit was hydrostatically tested to 1335 psig
on the tube side and 800 psig on the shell side. The shell side was

pressurized first and maintained at 800 psi while the tube side was pressure
tested. >??? A helium mass spectrometer leak test was applied, with the
shell-side pressure less than 5 microns abs and the tube-side pressurized
with helium to 100 psig. There were no leaks.

The heat exchanger is installed horizontally, pitching toward the
fuel-salt outlet at a slope of about 3°. Each U-tube is oriented so
that the coolant salt will also drain. The supports are described in
Section 5.5.3. The unit weighs about 2060 lb when empty and 3500 1b
when filled with both fuel and coolant salts. The fuel-salt holdup is
6.1 £42, and the coolant-salt holdup is about 3.7 £42.

The shell is surrounded by electric heating units of about 30 kw
total capacity, as described in Section 5.5.k.

In normal operation, the coolant-salt pressure will be maintained
at a slightly higher value than the fuel-salt pressure so that coolant
salt will flow into the fuel system if a leak develops.

5.5.2 Design Considerations

 

The heat exchanger was designed for low holdup of salts, simplicity
of construction, and moderately high performance. The space limitations
within the containment cell required a fairly compact unit. A U-tube
configuration best satisfied this requirement and also minimized the
thermal -expansion problems in the exchanger.

From the heat transfer standpoint, it was better to pass the fuel
salt through the shell and the coolant salt through the tubes, since
the fuel-salt volume flow rate is larger. The shell side also presents
less opportunity for retention of gas pockets during filling operations.
A further consideration in this respect was that the fuel-salt system
operates at a slightly lower pressure than the coolant-salt system and
there was a small savings in the required shell thickness.

5.5.2.1 Heat Transfer. The behavior of molten salts as heat
transfer fluids had been investigated prior to design of the MsgE. 100
There was good agreement between measured values of the tube-side

coefficients by Amos et a1,100 and calculated values based on the

generalized formula of Sieder and Tate. OL The heat transfer design
conditions are given in Table 5.9, and the physical properties of the

fuel and coolant salts are given in Table 2.1.
 

ny

a

169

The mean At for a true countercurrent heat exchanger would be
137°F. A correction factor of 0.96 was applied to include the effects
of a single-pass shell, which reduced this value to the 133°F shown
in Table 5.9 (see Section VI, Ref 18).

Film coefficients were assumed to be constant on both sides of
the tube wall. The velocity in the tubes is about 12.1 fps and the
Reynold's modulus about 9060, giving a film coefficient of about 4900
Btu/hr-ft2-°F.* The pressure drop in the tubes was estimated to be
about 2.2 psi/ft.* (See Section VI, Ref 18)

The film coefficient on the shell is estimated to be 3200
Btu/ft2-hr-°F for a Reynold's modulus of 13,000. The overall heat
transfer coefficient is about 1100 Btu/hr-ft2-°F. The resistance to
heat flow is about equally divided between the tube-side film, the
tube wall, and the shell-side film. The overall coefficient makes an
allowance of about 10% for possible "scale" deposits on the tubes. 10

In estimating the overall capacity, or rating, of the heat ex-
changer, the active length of the tubes was taken as the straight
portion between the thermal barrier plate and the last baffle, since
experience indicates that the heat transfer coefficient in the bends
of U-tube-type exchangers is considerably less than in the straight
sections. On this basis the effective area is 259 ft2, which is about
&% more than the calculated requirement for 10-Mw capacity. This
extra amount, plus the "dirty tube" allowance, affords a margin of
about 20% on the conservative side. 18

5.5.2.2 Pressure Drops. The estimated total pressure drop on

the shell side was estimated to be 22 psi at 1200 gpm.!0? Preliminary

testing of the complete exchanger indicated a pressure drop of almost
twice this amount, primarily due to the inlet and outlet losses. The
shell was lengtheried by l-in. to make room for an inlet impingement baffle,
four tubes vere removed (Leaving a total of 254), and the baffle stay

rods which partially blocked the fuel-salt exit nozzle opening were
eliminated. Subsequent testing indicated a total pressure drop at

1200 gpm of 25-30 psi.lT!

¥These values, given in Ref 18, are based on a coolant-salt circu-
lation rate of 830 gpm rather than the rated conditions of 850 gpm. The
greater velocity afforded by the latter will increase the calculated
values of the film coefficients and the overall coefficient slightly.

 

 
 

170

The estimated tube-side pressure drop was 29 psi at 850 gpm.
Tests on the 25hk-tube exchanger indicated a value of about 30 psi TT

5.5.2.3 Stresses. The thickness of the shell was determined
from the formulae of the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel Code, Section
vir. 7

The heat exchanger was designed for pressures of 55 psig on the
shell side and 90 psig on the tube side at 1300°F (see Section V,

Pp 2, Ref. 18). Except for thermal stresses in the tubes, the stresses
were limited to 2750 psi. Taking into consideration the actual thick-
nesses of material used and the higher stresses permitted by the Code,
the allowable working pressures are 75 psig for the shell side and

125 psig for the tube side at 1300°F.

The tube wall thickness was based more on the welding requirements
than on pressure-stress considerations. Experience had indicated that
wall thicknesses of less than 0.04 in. had more of a tendency to crack
at the tube welds; therefore the tube wall thickness was more or less
arbitrarily fixed at 0.042 in. This provides considerably more strength
than is needed to contain the design pressure. The stresses developed
in the tubes due to one leg of the U being hotter than the other are
not excessive and are largely self-adjusting. The thermal stress due
to the temperature difference across the tube wall is estimated to
be a maximum of 10,000 psi and is greatest in the U-bends where the
fuel salt is hottest. Under normal operating conditions the tube wall
in this region will not exceed 1150°F. The stress for 0.1 CRU is about
10,000 psi at 1150°F so there should be no concern for the life of the
tubes unless the reactor is operated through a large number of cycles
between zero and full pover at higher temperatures. =

The gg cimess of the tubesheet was determined by standard TEMA

formulae to be 1.5 in. for a pressure of 55 psi across the sheet and
a pressure stress of 2750 psi. This pressure differential assumes
that the coolant salt is at 65 psig and the fuel salt is at 10 psig

(no flow condition). The thermal barrier plate on the shell side is
estimated to limit the temperature difference across the tubesheet to
less than 20°F (see Section V, p 18 of Ref 18). The baffle on the
coolant-salt side is kept separate from the tubesheet in order to

avoid large localized stresses.

5.5.2.4 Vibration. Development testing of the heat exchanger
as constructed to the original design indicated excessive vibration
of the tubes at the rated flow rate. The design was then modified to
include an impingement baffle on the fuel-salt inlet and installation
of "lacing" rods to restrain lateral movement of individual tubes.
Subsequent testing showed that the noise due to the tube vibration

had been eliminated. t

5.5.3 Supports

The heat exchanger is connected to the reactor vessel and the pump
by short and stiff piping, so one of the primary considerations in de-
signing the supports for the heat exchanger was that it must be allowed
to move with but little restraint when the system is heated and cooled.
The coolant salt lines attached to the heat exchanger have sufficient
flexibility in looping around the reactor cell space to substantially
reduce the reactions on the heat exchanger nozzles due to thermal
expansion in these lines.

The heat exchanger rests on two INOR-8 saddle supports that are
welded to the shell about 46 in. apart. The INOR-8 legs on which the
saddles are welded are of different heights to give the shell a pitch
of about 3° toward the fuel-salt outlet end. The legs are bolted to
a carbon steel frame, about 30 in. wide and 10 ft 8 in. long, fabricated
of 6-in. I-beams. This frame is installed horizontally and rests on
four 3-in.-diam rollers (see ORNL Dwg. E-EE-D-L41L492). The support
bracket for each of the rollers has a 2-15/16-in.-diam pin inserted
in a thrust bearing, which carries the vertical load and permits the
rollers to be self-aligning. The thrust bearings are mounted on top
of the Grinnel¥* spring hanger assemblies having adjustable spring tension,
load indicator and scale. The special tension adjustment bolt can
be turned by use of remotely operated tools from above (see ORNL Dwg-
D-DD-D-41491). The spring hanger assemblies rest on a fixed support
structure of 8-in. I-beams. (See Section XI, Ref 18).

The arrangement of supports allows the heat exchanger to move
horizontally in a north-south direction on the rollers, and to move

vertically and rotate against the spring actions. A small amount of .

 
 

 

172

east-west horizontal translation (very little should be required) can
be accommodated by the frame slipping laterally on the rollers to the
"least-loaded" position.

Piping reactions on the heat exchanger nozzles are shown on ORNL

Dwg. D-EE-Z-40852 and are discussed in Section 5.6.

5.5.4 Heaters

The salts in the primary heat exchanger are kept molten by
electric resistance heaters installed outside the shell. The
heater units are arranged in three sections and are essentially
identical to the removable heaters applied to the 5-in. straight
sections of salt piping (see Section 5.6.6.2) except that they
are designed for the 16-in. OD shell. The heaters are connected
in three separate circuits, each three-phase, 208-v, 10-kw, to
give a total heat input capacity of 30-kw. The thermal insulation
is similar to that used on the pipe sections. (See Mirror Insulation

Company Dwg G-108-A).

5.6 Primary Circulating System Piping, Supports, Heaters,
Insulation, Freeze Flanges and Freeze Valves.

5.6.1 Piping

With the exception of a transition piece at the pump suction, all
the primary circulating system piping is fabricated of 5-in, sched
40 seamless INOR-8 pipe. Flanges are provided between the three major
pieces of equipment in the loop to facilitate their removal and replace-
ment. These "freeze" flanges are described subsequently in Section 5.6.4.

Forged elbows are used in the piping where space did not permit
use of longer radius bends. The system includes one 90° bend, one bend
of about 30°, three 90° elbows, one 57° elbow and one 34° elbow.

All piping in the circulating system pitches downward at 3° to cause
drainage towards the reactor. (The drain line from the bottom of the
reactor, line 103, pitches at about 3° to drain toward the fuel drain
tanks.)

The piping between the reactor discharge nozzle and the fuel-salt
pump suction nozzle, line 100, is welded to the reactor nozzle and extends
almost horizontally, with a slight bend, approximately 6 ft to a freeze
flange, FF-100; from this flange it bends slightly in the horizontal plane
and turns upwards 90°, terminating in the pump nozzle transition piece.
This special conical section is approximately 32 in. long and rolled from
3/8-in. INOR-8 plate. It is required to make the transition from the
5-in. pipe in line 100 to the 8-in. nozzle on the pump bowl. A 5-in.

x 6-in. eccentric reducer is used at the pump discharge nozzle. See
ORNL Dwgs E-GG-B-40700, E-GG-B-40701 and E-GG-E-41866.

Line 101 is welded to the pump discharge nozzle and extends
horizontally about 3-1/2 £4 where it makes a 90° bend in the horizontal
plane and joins the freeze flange FF-101, which is close-coupled to the
heat exchanger inlet nozzle. |

Line 102 drops vertically from the outlet at the underside of the
heat exchanger a distance of about 5-1/2 ft to a 90° elbow and then
runs horizontally through a sweeping 90° bend to the freeze flange, FF-102;
from this flange 1t continues horizontally through a slight bend to the

reactor inlet nozzle.

The pump bowl overflow line is described in Section 5.4.7.1 and the

drain pipe, line 103, is discussed in Section 6.

5.6.2 Piping Stresses and Flexibility Analysis

The reactor vessel is suspended from the stationary top cover of
the thermal shield and is thus fixed in position and the anchor point
for the piping in the primary circulating system. The circulating loop
is rather compact, with short relatively stiff lengths of 5-in. pipe con-
necting the equipment. To avoid use of bellows-type expansion joints to
relieve stresses due to thermal expansion, the heat exchanger and fuel
pump supports were designed to allow relatively free movement.

The fuel pump mount allows the pump to move on rollers in the hori-
zontal plane and a parallel-link framework, supported on springs, permits
vertical movement from the cold to the hot position (see Section 5.4.5).
The pump bowl is thus restrained from rotation about any axis.

The heat exchanger supports permit it to move horizontally in two
directions on rollers and to move vertically and rotate about its longi-
tudinal axis by acting against the spring supports, as described in
Section 5.5.3.

The sustained stresses in the piping, i.e., those due to internal
pressure and weight of the equipment and contents, were estimated using
conventional relationships’! and found to be less than the allowable
stress of 3,500 psi at 1300%. 1°

Flexibility analyses were made on the primary circulating system
piping using the IBM Modification of Pipe Stress Program, SHARE,

No. GS 3812, 9% Estimates were based on a reactor power level of 10 Mw
when the primary piping is between 1175°F and 1225°F, the coolant-salt
piping is between 1025°F and 1100°F, and the reactor vessel and heat ex-
changer are at about 1200°F. For every anticipated reactor operating
condition the maximum stresses were calculated to be well below the al-

*
lowaeble stress range of 32,125 psi, as determined from the Code of Pressure

 

*See p 96, ref 106. Based on §, = £(1.25 §_ + 0.25.8. ), where S

and is allowable stress in hot condition, taken as 3,500 psi at 1300°F
(see ref 16).

at 10 mw were: Ax (N-S) = 0.401 in.; Ay (E-W) = 0.335 in.; and Az (vert)

._ 91

= 0.826 in.

5.6.3 Supports

There are ten supports on major piping inside the reactor cell,
three on the fuel-salt piping and the remainder on the coolant-salt
lines. Rigid supports can be used at one location in the fuel-salt
system and at two places in the coolant-salt piping; at all other
locations the piping rests on spring-loaded mountings. The supports
for drain line 103 are described with the drain tank cell salt transfer
line supports, Section 6.28.

The spring supports are Bergen Pipe Support Corporation (New York,
N.Y.) units, Model VS-3F, in sizes 3, 5, 6, 7 and 8. The spring setting
in each is variable to adjust the support to the piping load, as will be
discussed subsequently. A short column of 3-in. sched 4O pipe rests on
the spring support and carries a 10-in. x 10-in. x 1/2-in.-thick steel
plate at the top. Nine 1l-in.-diam steel balls (Mathews Type 101) are
mounted on top of the plate. A similar horizontal plate, which rests on
top of the balls, is welded to a bracket arrangement extending through the
thermal insulation at the bottom of the pipe. These plates, with the ex-
ception of the plate at support S-2, are installed parallel with the slope
of the pipe at each location. The supporting arrangement. thus allows freedom
of movement of the piping in the horizontal plane, provides a variable spring
force in the vertical direction, and by supporting from below, allows the
piping to be removed for maintenance operations without disturbing the support
structure. (See ORNL Dvgs E-GG-~E-41886) . |

The support loads and the movements of the piping were estimated

using the methods given the Bergen Pipe Support Corporation Catalog No.
59.107 These values, for both the fuel-salt and the coolant-salt piping
inside the reactor cell are summarized in Table 5.10. The following

107

weights were assumed in making the estimates:

 
 

176

5-in. sched 40 INOR-8 pipe 15 1b/ft
Weight of salt in pipe* 22 0"
Thermal insulation 0
Electric heaters 5
Support frame 10
Freeze flange and clamp 290
Clamp frame 212 "

The movements listed in Table 5.10 are for uniform heatup of
the system to 1300°F. The values for actual operation may differ slightly.
In most instances the springs will exert upward forces on the piping when
the system is cold. These forces approximately equal the weight of the
salt in the effected portion of the system.

A description of the forces on a typical support, S-3 on line
201 in the coolant-salt piping, will explain the operation. The spring in
this support is initially compressed 1-11/16 in. and a plug is inserted to
maintain the spring in this position. The spring scale pointer will read
608 1bs. The support is then placed in position and the empty pipe load
of 397 lbs 1s rested on it. Since the pipe will expand 1/4 in. upwards
when heated, a second spacer 1-7/16 in. long is substituted for the first
one. The spring will then exert the full 608 lbs force against the pipe,
with a resultant upwards force on the pipe of 211 pounds. As the system
is heated, but still empty of salt, the pipe expands upwards and the spring
also expands the 1/4 in. maximum travel allowed by. the 1-7/16-in. travel
stop spacer piece. The spring scale will then read 581 lbs, but no force
greater than the 397 lbs weight of the plpe can be exerted because of the
travel stop. When the system is filled with salt, an additional 184
1bs must be carried by the support; the total piping load of 581 lbs
is thus counter balanced by the spring setting of 581 1bs.107

The variable spring support, S-10, for line 101 is compressed
when the system is cold in order for it to give full support after the
pipe has: moved 3/8 in. upwards to the hot position. The cold spring
setting is 188 1bs and it supports a weight of 180 lbs at operating

conditions.

 

*In estimating the weight of the salt in a pipe, a density of 150 1bs/ft7 \
was used in both fuel and coolant-salt systems, since the difference in
the weights amounted to but 4 1lbs/ft of pipe.

The piping between the heat exchanger and the reactor, line 102,
also has a variable spring support, S-2, As the system is heated the
net thermal expansion of line 102 is downward about 3/8 in. The support
is installed with a spring setting of 234 lbs, which is 82 lbs less than
the calculated hot position loading of 316 lbs. During system heatup, the
3/8-in. downward expansion of the pipe exerts a force of 17 lbs and com-
presses the spring to the stop. The unit then acts as a rigid support and
when fuel salt is added to the system there is no further spring deflection.
Supports S-1 on line 100, S-5 on line 201, and S-9 on line 200,
each carry the weight of a freeze flange. Since the movement of the pipe
at these particular support points is negligible, rigid-type supports
are used.
The piping supports in the coolant cell are described in Section 8.6.2
and those in the fuel drain tank cell in Section 6.5.

5.6.4 Freeze Flanges

Mechanical-type joints are provided in the 5-in. piping in the
fuel and coolant-salt systems inside the reactor cell to permit the
major equipment to be disconnected and removed for maintenance or re-
placement. The locations of the five flanged joints are shown in
the flowsheet, Figure 5.3.

The so-called "freeze flange" type of joint was adopted be-
cause of its proven reliability in providing tight connections with
zero salt leakage and insignificant gas leakage under all anticipated
thermal cycling conditions. It is also a joint in which the salt does
not contact the ring-joint gasket, an important factor in that residual
salt would be difficult to remove with remotely-operated tooling. Salt
particles in the ring joint could cause corrosion of the seating surfaces
when the salt is exposed to moisture and air and thus make the Joint
difficult to reseal to the necessary leak tightness. There is also an
advantage to keeping the salt out of the ring joint in that there is
less scatter of salt particles as the flanges are separated.

Figure 5.29 shows a sectional view of a typical flange and clamp
assembly (also see ORNL Dwg. E-GG-C-40610). The 23-in.-diam flanges
are held together by two semi-circular spring steel clamps which are

forced around the circumference of the flanges. The spring action

exceeds the piping codel®® requirements for gasket loading in pro-
viding more than 136,000 1b of clamping force and also affords a more
constant gasket loading during thermal cycling than would be obtainable
with more rigid fastenings, such as bolting. The arrangement also

was amenable to design of equipment and tooling for remote assembly
and disassembly of the joint from above.

Hydraulically operated jacking tools are lowered into the cell
to provide the five to ten tons of force required to install the clamps.
Once installed, no external force is required to keep the clamps in
place. The same jacking tools are used for separating the clamps
and the forces required are only slightly less than those needed for
installation. A clamping frame is provided for each of the five
flange installations inside the cell but the jacking tools, etc.,
are interchangeable and may be used at each location.¥*

5.6.4.1 Flanges. The flanges are fabricated of INOR-8 and
are about 23-1/8 in. OD and 1.48k in. thick when measured through the
thickest portion of a flange face. They are the welding-neck type.

The male flange has a guide ring, 5.798-5.802 in. diam by
1.248-1.252 in. long, welded into the face on the same centerline.
The outside of the guide ring is tapered at 15° so that as the flange
faces are brought together during assembly operations the ring will
enter a similarly shaped opening in the female flange to guide the
two together in correct alignment (see ORNL Dwg D-GG-C-40611 and
40612). In each case the male flange is installed facing "uphill"
in the salt piping, all of which slopes at 3° to promote drainage.

A groove, 0.34L in. wide x 0.25 in. deep x 20.375 in. pitch
diam, is machined to close tolerances in the face of both the male
and female flanges to accommodate the ring gasket. The flange faces
are also machined in the vicinity of the grooves to serve as gaging
surfaces. Either the male or the female flange is drilled with a
3/32-in.-diam hole through the bottom of the groove for the helium
buffer gas and leak-detection connection. The flange half selected

 

*¥Due to crowded conditions, the flange in line 100 may require

is the one judged to be less likely to require removal. The hole is

trepanned on the back side of the flange for the welding of a 1/8-in.
sched-40 pipe. The connection is made at a point on the flange which
falls between the two semi-circular spring clamps (see ORNL D-GG-C-40615).

The sliding surfaces for the clamps on the backs of the flanges
have first a 6° and then a 3° slope to draw the flanges tightly together,
and then a ramp with 0° slope to make the clamps self-retaining.

These surfaces have a machined finish (32 RMS micro-in.) and are care-
fully contoured to provide the required gasket loading with a minimum

of surface galling or stress concentrations. A graphite-alcohol lubri-
cant, "Nearlube," is applied to the flanges before applying the clamps.

As indicated in Fig. 5.32, a clearance of 0.030 in. is provided
between the flange faces at the outer circumference to take care of
tolerances in machining of the ring gasket and groove and also to
allow for deformation of the flange under internal pressure loading,

a condition which tends to close the clearance gap at the outer edge.

A groove, or line, is cut around the circumference of each flange
disc to serve as a reference mark for the optical alignment of piping
inside the reactor cell.

The outside edge of both the male and female flanges has two
projecting lugs, or ears, horizontally 180° apart, which are used in
the disassembly operation to be described subsequently. As shown in
ORNL Dwgs D-GG-C-40611 and 40612, these ears are about 1.625 in. wide
and project about 1-1/4 in.

Flange loadings, stresses, and deformations are discussed
separately under Sections 5.6.4.6 and 5.6.4.7, following.

5.6.4.2 Ring Gasket. The ring gasket .is fabricated of
nickel (ASTM B-160). This material was selected because it is
sufficiently softer than INOR-8 to seat properly and has a similar
coefficient of thermal expansion¥* to remain tight after thermal
cycling. The ring has a pitch diameter of 20.375 in. (+ 0.002 in.)

and has the inner and outer edges rounded to a radius of 0.155-0.157

 

%¥The coefficient of thermal expansion for Ni at 100°F is 5.66
x 1076 in./in.-°F; for INOR-8 the value is 6.45 x 10-6 in./in.-°F
in the 70-4OO°F range.

 
 

182

in. The ring is machined to the close seating tolerances required
through use of a special jig furnished to the manufacturer, as shown
on ORNL Dwg D-GG-C-LO61k.

In common with other leak-detected ring Jjoings in the MSRE, the
gasket seats on both sides of the groove to form two sealed spaces
which are buffered with helium and monitored for leakage. A 1/16-in.-
diam hole is drilled through the ring in two places to allow the
sealed and buffered spaces to communicate.

The inside surface of the ring is drilled with eight equally-
spaced 1/16-in.-diam holes, about 5/32 in. deep, to accept the re-
taining pins on the salt screen, to be described subsequently. The
inside surface of the ring also has a "notch" 0.062 in. deep and to
a radius of 1 in. at the bottom and two side-by-side identical notches
at the top to engage the remotely operated tool used to maneuver the
ring during maintenance (see ORNL Dwgs D-GG-C-LO611 and 40614).

A small 304 stainless steel bracket is fastened with flush-headed
screws to the outside of the seal ring at the top. This bracket
supports a l-in.-long horizontal pin formed from a 30k stainless steel
1/4 in. x 20 UNC bolt which has the top portion of the threads ground
away. This pin is inserted in a 1/b-in. tapped hole at the top of
the male flange when the ring is to be positioned for reassembly of the
joint. The lack of threads on top of the pin allows it to be slipped
into the hole, but when released, the threaded portion prevents it
from slipping out, thus retaining the ring in position for mating of
the two flange faces. All the male flanges are made with a similar
tapped hole on the bottom to allow them to be installed either side
up and thus provide more interchangeability of parts (see ORNL D-GG-
C-L061T).

5.6.4.3 Salt Screen. The 0.050-in.-wide clearance between the
male and female flange faces contains a salt-retaining screen formed
of 0.015-in. OD INOR-8 wire on a 20-by-20 to the inch mesh. Salt
entering the cavity solidifies on the screen, the uninsulated flanges
being cooled by loss of heat to the cell atmosphere. No other source

of cooling is required.

At a salt temperature of 1200°F, the freeze point is about 5-5/8 in
radially from the center of the pipe. This distance decreases about
11/16 in. for every 100°F decrease in bore temperature ,-0° The screen
helps somewhat in preventing the salt from moving radially outwards,
but, more importantly, when the joint is disassembled, provides & con-
venient means of removing the frozen salt as an intact cake. Undue
scattering of salt particles is thus avoided. The flange faces have
very little salt adhering to them.

The outer edge of the screen has eight equally spaced radial
pins, 1/16 in. diam by 3/4 in. long, which engage the aforementioned
holes in the seal ring to join the two units together for convenience
in handling. The outside edge of the screen has a 3-in.-wide by
3/hk-in. notch at the top and a 1-1/4-in.-wide by 3/4-in. notch at the
bottom to allow access for the ring gasket holding tool mentioned
above. (See ORNL Dwg D-GG-C-40O61T)

5.6.4.4 Clamps. The clamping rings are fabricated of No. 4130
heat-treated steel forgings made to ORNL Specification 81-180, and
as shown on ORNL Dwg D-GG-C-40616. After welding, the clamp assemblies
are quenched from 1550°F and tempered at 800°F to obtain a surface
hardness of 380 BHN. This material was proven to have a sufficiently
high yield strength to provide the necessary clamping load, and with
the hardened surfaces, to be sufficiently compatible with the INOR-8
to minimize galling.

The clamping rings are more or less U-shaped in cross section,
with the base portion about 1 in. thick and the legs tapering to 5/8
in. in thickness at the ends. The clearance between the legs is
2.908 in. (#0.010 in.). The semi-circular pieces have the inside
corners rounded to a 3/4-in. radius and are contoured to prevent digging
in and galling of the INOR-8 flanges at these points (see ORNL Dwg
D-GG~C-4O616) .

Right and left hand guide ears are welded to both the upper and
lower clamp halves. These ears are also fabricated of No. 4130 steel
and are heat treated along with the clamps. Each ear is formed of
two more or less identical pieces with a 1/8-in. gap in between.

This arrangement was proven necessary to prevent stiffening of the

 
 

 

 

 

184

backbone of the clamp at the ear location, with subsequent overstressing

or galling of the sliding surfaces at these points. The ears have a
1-5/8-in. by 2-1/32-in. opening through which the clamping-frame guide
bars pass, as will be explained in Section 5.6.4.5, to follow.

The top and bottom halves of the clamp are each drilled with a
1-5/8-in.-diam hole to permit passage of the 1-1/2-in.-diam load
transmitting rod on the clamping frame, as described below.

5.6.4.5 Clamping Frame. The clamping frame assembly is shown
schematically in Fig. 5.30 and on ORNL Dwg E-GG-C-40610. The frame
allows the clamps to be moved as a unit into position around the
mating flanges and then serves as a leverage point for applying
hydraulic jacks on each side of the clamps to draw them together.
Since the frame encircles the pipe, it must remain inside the reactor
cell after assembly of a joint. For storage it is moved along the
pipe to a supporting rack.

The clamping frame is about 33-5/8 in. wide by 55-1/2 in. high
and is 7 in. thick. It is fabricated, in most part, of ASTM A285
Grade C steel. The upper and lower pieces of the assembly are joined
by 1-1/2 Xx 2 x 34-in.-long guide bars on each side. The upper and
lower ends of these two bars have 1-3/8-in.-long oblong holes through
which a 3/b-in.-diam pin is mounted to provide a freedom of movement
of the upper and lower elements to make the clamps self-aligning.

The inside of the rods at mid-height have two projecting lugs to
engage the lugs on the outer rims of the flanges, as mentioned above.
A 1-1/2-in.-diam rod extends downward about.1l0 in. from the
center of the upper element, or beam, of the frame and a similar rod

extends upward from the lower beam, both rods passing through the
holes in the respective semi-circular clamps. The purpose of these
rods is to transmit the load, or force, when removing the clamps.
Brass pads are brazed on the ends of the rods to avoid injury to

the flanges. The distance between the ends of the rods is about 1/4
in. greater than the overall diameter of the flange discs.

To install the frame it is first moved from the storage rack
using the liftingeyes on the upper clamp. In this position, the

upper beam will drop down until its ears bear against the clamp ears.

The lower clamp also drops down with its ears bearing against the
lower guide-rod-pin joint housing. The frame is then moved horizontally
along the pipe and lifted into position with the lugs on the flange
rims between the two lugs on the frame guide bars. The clearance
between the lugs is about 3/32 in. so that close alignment is not
required.

The upper clamp is then lowered, as indicated in Fig. 5.30, so
that the bottom end of the upper load-transmitting rod rests on the
top of the flange, the clearance in the pinned Joints on the guide
bars allowing the necessary movement. The hydraulically operated
Jacking tools are then applied to each side, the jaws of this tool
closing around the top of the upper clamp ear and the bottom of the
lower clamp ear. The jacks are operated simultaneously, drawing
the clamps into position. The pressure to the jacks can be varied
as required to draw the clamps on evenly. The force required on
each side is 12,000 to 24,000 1b, depending on the condition of the
sliding surfaces, the sum of the dimensional tolerances, etc.

In disassembly of a joint, the lower clamp is removed first.

The jaws of the jacking tool are placed above the ears on the lower
clamp and below the lower pin joint housing, as shown in Fig. 5.30.
The lower load-transmitting rod will push against the bottom of the
flanges and transmit the jacking force, with no load being carried
by the pin joints on the guide bars. Unequal distribution of the
friction between the clamp and the flanges may cause one side of the
clamp to tend to "get ahead" of the other, an action which is self-
multiplying. The resulting forces tending to move the frame out of
vertical, i.e., rotate about the flange, are counteracted by the lugs
on the flange rims bearing against the lugs on the guide bars. Since
the first rotational movement takes the "slack" out of the pinned
guide bar joints, the position of the pin in the slotted holes serves
as an indication to the operator that the jacking force on one side
of the clamp should be reduced, If sufficient imbalance occurs to
move the guide bars to the limit of their travel in the pinned joint,
the end of the bar butts against the housing to transmit the load
rather than acting through the pin.

The upper clamp is then removed, using the jacking tool as
shown in Fig. 5.30. The upper load-transmitting rod is effective
in this case and, again, the guide rods and pins carry little of
the load. The force required to remove a clamp is only slightly
less than that needed to install it,

After both clamps have been loosened, the upper clamp and
frame assembly can be raised and moved horizontally out of the way.
Once the flanges have been separated by more than 2 to 3 in., the
frame could be removed from the reactor cell, should this be
desirable.

A detailed description of operation of the clamping frame and
associated tooling is given in Maintenance Procedures, Part X.

5.6.4.6 Gas Leak Rates During Thermal Cycling. Changes in
gasket loading, and thus the gas leak rate, occur during temperature
cycling. This is due to the differences in the coefficients of
thermal expansion of the flange material (INOR-8), the ring gasket
(nickel), and the flange clamps (No. 4130 carbon steel). The
resiliency of the clamps, however, causes the load on the gasket to
be more constant than if more rigid fastenings were used.

Even if excess temperatures existed at a freeze flange, allow-
ing the salt to come in contact with the ring joint gasket, no salt
leakage would occur. (Some damage might be done to the ring seal,
however.) Thus, the only manner in which salt could leak would be
for gross failure and separation of the flange faces. Tests of
early models of the freeze flanges demonstrated, however, that gas
leakage could be encountered, 0? For this reason, the development
tests were primarily concerned with measurements of helium gas leak-
age from the leak-detected buffer zones. i

Tests of the effect of thermal cycling on gas tightness showed
that the MSRE flange design maintained acceptable gas seals under
high temperature (about 1300°F), under repetitive cycling (in which
the temperature was raised from 150°F to 1300°F and returned to 150°F
in a 2h-hr cycle, for more than 100 cycles), and under severe tempera-
ture transients (100°F/min for six minutes). (See p 10 ref 110)

The joints displayed the desirable characteristic of having a smaller

 
 

 

188

gas leak rate at the higher temperatures than at lower. After 36

‘thermal cycles, typical leak rates were 2.6 x 1070 ce/sec in the cold

condition and 0.39 x 107° cc/sec in the 1300°F condition (see p 45
ref 108).

The effect on the leak rate of the interchangeability of parts
was investigated (see p 41 ref 108). Two female flanges were thermal
cycled several times and then mated with new (uncycled) male flanges
and gasket rings to simulate the situation which might exist in the
replacement of a major component in the reactor cell. Both pairs
sealed satisfactorily, even after subsequent extensive thermal
cycling.

A gasket ring with an octagonal cross section was found to seal
better than one with an oval cross section, but both performed more
than adequately (see p 43 ref 108).

5.6.4.7 Loading and Stresses. The clamping force which can
be exerted by the clamps was estimated to be between 136,500 1b and

 

241,200 1b, depending upon the combinations of tolerances that could
exist in the fit of the various parts. Itt The gasket loading re-
quired for proper seating was calculated using the method outlined
in Par UA-47 of Section VIII of the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel
code, and estimated to be about 28,800 1p, 1 The clamps are

thus capable of seating the ring gaskets with ample reserve for
withstanding pipe stresses and internal pressure.

The force required to drive the clamps onto the flanges is a
maximum just as the legs of the clamp slide onto the ramp with 0°
slope. This force was estimated to be 2k, 750 1b for each side of
the clemp (if the clamping force is 241,200 1b), or a total of 49,500
1b for each of the clamp halves. tt This estimate essumes a coeffici-
ent of friction between the clamp and the flange of 0.15, a value
which is ample in most cases but could be exceeded if galling should
occur,

Under maximum clamping effort, the maximum stress in the clamp
was estimated to be about 90,500 psi, and the maximum clamp deflection
0.092 in, The clamp is forged and heat treated to have a yield

strength of greater than 100,000 pei. ttt

189

The mechanical stresses in the flange due to axial loadings
resulting from thermal expansion in the piping systems were found to
be less than 4000 psi. 112 This value includes the effect of internal
pressure. The total axial loading resulting from a stress of L000 psi
is 17,200 1b (based on 6-in. OD by 0.204-in. wall thickness tubing).
The allowable axial loading on the flange vag estimated using

methods developed in the Sturm-Krouse study,t and based on an
allowable working stress range of 30,000 psi,* a value of 86,936 1b
obtained. The flange is thus capable of withstanding the axial
loadings with a factor of safety or more than four.

The flange internal thermal stresses were analyzed both analytically
and by photoelastic studies to determine the stress concentration
factors. 1° (These estimates were based on 6-in. OD tubing, but
are applicable.) These studies indicated that the stresses could
be higher than the elastic limit and that plastic strain could exist.
Development tests proved that both radial and transverse strains
occur, the former causing a reduction in the bore diameter, and the
latter a distortion of the plane surface of the face, One test showed
that after 36 thermal cycles the female flange bore decreased by 10
mils and the male bore by 30 mils. No permanent distortion was
noted on the outer surfaces of the flanges (after 30 cycles) but the
"out-of-flatness"” of the interior face of the female flange increased
from 14 mils to a value of 18 mils. No warpage was detected in the
male face. These strains are judged to be of such magnitude that a
large number of strain cycles could be applied without failure. 0
Further, the differences between the deformations of the faces at
1%00°F and at 850°F (the salt liquidus temperature) are not sufficiently
great that "excess" salt could be trapped between the flange faces to
cause abnormally high stresses or distortions. Thus, the plastic strain

that occurs is small and flanges of the design used in the MSRE have

undergone more than 100 thermal cycles (probably equivalent to 10 to 15

years of normal MSRE operation) with no significant leakage, or defor-

1
- mations of consequence.

 

¥As indicated in the footnote, Section 5.6.2, a more recent value
for the stress range is 32,125 psi.

5.6.5 .Freeze.Valves

5.6.5.1 General Description. The flow of salt in the MSRE
drain, fill and processing systems is controlled by freezing or thaw-
ing a short plug of salt in a flattened section of 1-1/2-in. pipe,
called a "freeze valve." This arrangement was adopted for the MSRE
because of a lack of a mechanical-type valve with a proven reliability
in molten-salt service.* The freeze valve concept, on the other hand,
has a good record of satisfactory application. While mechanical-type
valves would have the advantage of faster action and ability to modu-
late the flow, the freezing and thawing times for the freeze valves
are satisfactorily short and the "on-off" type of flow control does
not impose any particular handicap.

There are a twelve freeze valves in the MSRE. All are fabri-
cated of 1-1/2-in. pipe. Six are installed in 1-1/2-in. lines and six
in 1/2-in. lines. As may be noted in Table 5.11, one freeze valve is
located in the reactor drain and fill pipe, line 103, and is inside
the reactor furnace. Six of the freeze valves are in the fuel drain
tank cell, three are in the fuel processing cell, and two are in the
coolant cell.

Figure 5.32 shows the general arrangement at a freeze valve.

The valve illustrated is used at FV-104, 105 and 106, but with the
exception of the flat-plate heaters, is also typical of valves 107
through 112. Electric heat is applied, either directly or indirectly,
to thaw a valve and to keep it in the open condition. A stream of
cooling gas*¥* or air is used to cool the pipe section to freeze a
salt plug and positively stop the salt flow. Some system gases may
diffuse through the frozen plug but the seepage through the valve is

inconsequential to operation of the MSRE.

 

¥Preliminary investigations at ORNL of Kenametal seats and poppets,
electrically-driven actuators, etc., indicated that a mechanical-

type valve for molten-salt service may be practical provided that

a satisfactory stem seal could be devised with reasonable effort.

The valve "body" in each case consists simply of a flattened
section of the piping about 2 in. long. The shaping was done at
room temperature using a forming die in a hydraulic press. Each
section was dye-checked after forming, although there was no evidence
of a tendency for cracking. Sections identical to those used in
the MSRE were tested through more than 200 freeze-thaw cycles without
evidence of over-stressing or cracking. All the freeze sections,
with the exception of the one in line 103, are installed with the
flat faces in a horizontal plane.

A cooling gas flow of 15 to 35 scfm will freeze a valve,
initially at 1200°F, in 15 to 30 minutes. The gas flow is then
reduced to 3 to 7 scfm to maintain the valve in the frozen con-
dition (i.e., with the salt below 850°F) but limiting the growth
of the frozen plug to the freeze valve section. To allow longer
plugs could cause unacceptably long thawing times and/or present
. the opportunity to thaw the center section of the plug while the
ends remain solid, thus perhaps overstressing the pipe wall.
| In most cases a shroud, or box, is used to direct the flow
of cooling gas around the freeze valve section and to prevent the
gas from cooling nearby heated surfaces. The thermal insulation
arrangement at the freeze valve helps establish the freezing and
thawing times. The time allowed depends upon the particular ap-
plication. For example, the freeze valve in line 103 is designed
to melt the plug in about 5 minutes, while others may take sub-
‘stantially longer.

Short vertical lengths of 4-in. NPS piping are placed at most
freeze valves to form syphon breaks, or "pots," which insure that
ample salt will remain in the freeze valve section after a salt trans-
fer to provide a full and solid frozen plug. Where freeze valves are
installed in 1/2-in. lines, the pipe size changes to 1-1/2 in. at the
reservoir.

Design-and development of the freeze valves did not lend it-
self to analytical treatment of the stresses, heat transfer, ete.,
because of the irregular shape of the section and the unpredictable

temperature distributions. The MSRE freeze valves, therefore, are

the result of development testing, primarily with regard to the arrange-
ment of the heaters and coolers to attain the required freezing and
thawing times, and to provide stations that could be maintained with
remotely-operated tooling. 114

5.6.5.2 Definitions of "Deep Frozen, Frozen and Thawed". These
terms were defined to have the following meanings: 1?

a. Deep Frozen. The salt plug is frozen, and will remain so,
even on loess of electric power, cooling gas supply, etc. The heaters
on the freeze valve are off, and may be off on piping adjacent to the
valve, The cooling gas may or may not be supplied to the valve.

b. Frozen. Heaters on the valve are off but the heaters on
adjacent piping are on, the plug remaining frozen by the cooling
action of the gas stream. These valves will thaw in a specified
time if the electric power fails (causing loss of the gas flow and
power to the heaters) and will remain thawed for at least 20 minutes.

¢. Thawed. Electric heaters on adjacent piping and/or on the
valve are on; the cooling gas flow is off. If electric power fails,
the valve remains thawed for at least 30 minutes.

5.6.5.3 Thermocouples. In general, two thermocouples are
attached on the upper surface at the center of each freeze valve
section; two are attached to the upper surface of each "shoulder"

(the transition between the round pipe and the flattened section),
and one couple is attached to the bottom of the pipe at each end
about 5 in. from the centerline of the freeze valve. Thermocouple
locations are shown on ORNL Dwg D-HH-B-40543, and the thermocouple
numbers are listed in Table 5.11. It is to be noted in this table
that only those couples with an "py prefix are listed and that near-
by thermocouples having line number designations are not included.

The chromel-alumel, mineral-insulated thermocouples have Inconel
sheaths 1/8- in. diam, and are attached by welding the sheath to the
ground surface of & weld-deposited INOR-8 pad, about 3/8 in. square
by 1/16 in. thick, on the process piping.

All the installed thermocouples are used in the circuitry. About
half, those with an "A" suffix, lead to control modules, and the others,

with a "B" suffix, are used in the monitoring circuits. If a spare

 
 

 

tr

194

should be needed, a monitoring couple can be diverted for that purpose.

ba

Some thermocouples provide the signal for two amplifiers, one for the low

temperature setpoint and the other for the high setpoint. If the temper-

ature at the center section of a freeze valve rises above 1300°F, or falls

below a set value, an alarm will be sounded. 110 The absolute value of the

control setpoint temperature depends upon the freeze valve function, the

type of heaters and insulation, etc., so that study of each thermocouple

installation is needed in the field to make final settings. The nominal

setpoint temperatures are given in the thermocouple tabulation, ORNL -
Dwg D-AA-B-LO511.

5.6.5.4 Freeze Valve 103. This freeze valve is in the reactor
drain and fill line and is located within the reactor furnace adjacent
to the reactor vessel. It is frozen, and maintained frozen, by a cooling
jet of gas directed against it. It thaws quickly when the gas flow is
interrupted due to the residual heat within the pipe wall.

The 1 1/2-in. sched 40 INOR-8 drain line is flattened for a distance
of about 2 in. to a flow area 1/2 in. wide, giving it outside cross
sectional dimensions of 0.79 x 2 1/2 in., overall. The shoulders of the
flattened section make an angle of about 30° with the pipe axis. The
valve is installed with the flattened faces in the horizontal plane,
as shown in Fig. 5.31 and on ORNL Dwg E-GG-C-40603. (If the flattened
faces had been mounted vertically, special precautions would have been
required to eliminate the gas pocket tending to exist in the projection
of the flattened section above the top of the pipe, an effect found to .
encourage porosity of the frozen plug.)

The valve is surrounded by a 2-3/4 x 2-in. long x 1-3/4-in. high
shroud fabricated of 1/16-in.-thick INOR-8 sheet. One end of this
shroud is welded to the process pipe and the other to a b-in.-diam
bellows about 13/16 in. long, having two convolutions, and fabricated
of 20-gage INOR-8 sheet. The other end of the bellows is welded to
the process pipe. The bellows allows for differential expansion due

to the shroud operating at a lower temperature than the pipe wall.

The cooling gas enters the shroud from the side through a 3/h4-1in.
OD tube, and leaves through a similar pipe on the opposite side. The
shroud is made concave on the top and bottom, as shown on ORNL Dwg
E-GG-C-L40603, to increase the gas velocity and improve the heat trans-
fer in those areas to obtain more rapid freezing of the salt plug at
the center of the flow area.

The freeze valve and shroud assembly are enclosed in a 20-gage
stainless steel box about 8 in. wide x 5 in. high x 6 in. long, filled
with Fiberfrax wool thermal insulation. (See Section 5.6.6.3.)

Two sheathed thermocouples are installed on the top outside flat-
tened face of the valve, the sheathes passing through sleeves in the
side plates of the shroud. Two thermocouples are also located on the
top shoulder of the valve opposite the bellows end, and two couples
are located on top of the pipe immediately adjacent to the bellows, as
shown on ORNL Dwgs D-HH-B-40543 and E-GG-C-40603.

A Calrod heater, 0.315 in. diam with Inconel sheath, of 1500-watt
capacity, is formed into a saddle shape and fits over the top of line
10% between the freeze valve box and the electrical connection to the
line used for resistance heating between the reactor and the drain
tanks. The saddle-type heater is removable with special tooling from
above through a special standpipe arrangement, as shown on ORNL Dwg
D-GG-C-4060k. The heater may be needed to prevent the pipe from be-
coming too cool in the vicinity of the electrical connection lug, and
is not directly associated with operation of the freeze valve.

The valve can be frozen by the 68 scfm jet of cooling gas in less

115 When the temperature of the shoulders of the valve

than 30 minutes.

reaches about 680°F, the cooling gas flow is reduced to about 15 scfm;

at 650°F all gas flow would be cut off. When the temperature rises

slightly above 650°F, the holding air would be resumed and if the temper-

ature reaches 850°F the blast air flow of 68 scfm is again turned on.

but are deep frozen at all other times. Dae

The flattened sections on the process piping for these valves
are essentially as described for FV-103, above, except that the flat
sides are mounted in the horizontal plane. The general features of
the cooling gas shroud, or box, are indicated in the sketch, Figure
5.34. The cross sectional shapes of the shroud and the process pipe
at the center of the freeze valve are very similar. The shroud is
2-1/8 in. long, measured along the axis of the pipe, and has maximum
overall dimensions of 2-5/16 in. high and 3-7/8 in. wide. The end
pieces are fabricated of 1/8-in.-thick INOR-8 plate and are welded
to the process pipe. The outside shell, which is welded around the
end pieces, consists of two layers of 0.024-in.-thick INOR-8 shim
stock separated by two thickness of 1/8-in,-thick Fiberfrax in-
sulating paper, Type 970-H. Additional details are shown on ORNL
Dwg D-GG-C-55509.

The cooling gas is introduced at the bottom of the shroud through
1/2-in. OD x 0.042-in. wall thickness INOR-8 tubing. The gas circulates
inside the shroud around the freeze valve section and leaves through
a similar 1/2-in. OD tube at the bottom, the inlet and outlet openings
being separated by a 1/8-in.-thick baffle. The inlet gas tubing has
a 6-in.-long, 316 stainless steel, corrugated flexible connector
welded in it to provide for relative movement of the process pipe
and the-gas supply line. The gas discharge pipe terminates about
8 in. below the freeze valve, the gas discharging into the cell
atmosphere.

The thermocouple leads are ‘brought into the shroud through:the
exit gas tube. Two chromel-alumel, mineral-insulated thermocouples
with 1/8-in. OD Inconel sheaths are applied to built-up pads on the
top of the center section, as indicated in Figure 5.32. Two .thermo-
couples are also attached to pads on top of each shoulder outside
the cooling gas shroud. = | Co }

The cooling gas shroud-is enclosed in the removable heater-
insulation units for the process lines, see Section 5.6.6, following.
The 3/4-in.-thick flat-plate ceramic heaters (Cooley Electric Mfg. Corp.,

Indianapolis) are arranged on the sides and top of the process piping, o

fa

are attached to the insulation assembly and are removable with it. The
heaters at FV-104 consist of two sections, FV-10L-1, made up of six
heater elements with a total capacity of 2.4 kw (at 230 v); and
FV-104-3, containing three elements with a total capacity of 2 kw
(at 115 v). The heaters at FV-105 are arranged in three sections:
FV-105-1 has six heater elements with total capacity of 2.4 kw (at 230 v),
FV-105-3 has three heaters and a total capacity of 2.0 kw (at 115 v), and
FV-105-4 has three heaters with total capacity of 1.95 kw (at 115 v). .
Freeze valve 106 has two heater sections: FV-106-1 has six elements
and a total capacity of 2.0 kw (at 230 v), and FV-106-3 has three
elements and a total capacity of 2.0 kw (at 115 v).
As shown on the Mirror Insulation Company Dwgs G-118B and G-118C,
the heater plates are not applied for a distance of about 2 in. along
the pipe at the cooling shroud, due to the lack of space. Sufficient
heat is obtained by conduction along the process pipe to thaw the
freeze valve. Also, see ORNL Dwg E-MM-A-51660.
Heaters on the piping adjacent to FV-104, 105 and 106 are on
at all times during reactor operation. A valve is thawed by cutting
off the cooling gas flow. While freezing and thawing times are not
critical in the operation of the MsgE, 1? the observed time is less
than 10 minutes with electric power available and less than 20 min
when relying only on the residual heat in the system.
A cooling gas flow of 15 scfm through the cooling shroud will .
freeze a salt plug in less than 30 minutes. When the temperatures
of the shoulders of the valve are indicated to be less than T750°F, -
the cooling gas flow is reduced to about 3 scfm to hold the plug
frozen. Should the temperature climb to about 820°F, the high flow
rate will be resumed. If the temperature falls below 650°F, the
gas flow will be stopped altogether to prevent the formation of too
large a frozen zone.
5.6.5.6 Freeze Valves 107, 108, 109, 110, 111 and 112. These
freeze valves are installed in salt transfer lines in the fuel drain
tank and fuel processing cells. Although direct maintenance is not .
possible in the drain tank cell, FV-107, 108 and 109 were not provided OC

with removable heater and insulation sections, as were FV-104, 105 and
106, which are also in the drain tank cell, because the non-removable
type heaters were simplier and more economical to install. Lines

107, 108 and 109 are not essential to reactor operation, and, in

most cases, if a line fails to thaw properly, an alternate route

can be used for transfer of the salt. A further consideration is

that the heaters at FV-107, 108 and 109 are seldom used, the valves
remaining in the deep frozen condition for long periods, and could

be reasonably assumed to require no maintenance during the life of

the MSRE.

The freeze valves in the sealed drain tank cell use cell atmosphere
gas for cooling whereas FV-110, 111 and 112 are in the fuel processing
cell and use air as the coolant.

As may be noted in Figure 5.32, freeze valves 107, 108, 109 and
110 have pots, or reservoirs, on each side of the valve. Freeze valves
FV-11l and 112 have a pot on one side only as shown in Figure 5.33.

The transition from 1/2-in. pipe size to the 1-1/2-in. NPS freeze valve
section is made at the reservoirs.

The dimensions of the flattened section of 1-1/2-in. pipe are
as described for FV-103, Section 5.6.5.4, above. The construction
of the cooling gas shrouds, the freezing and thawing times, and the
thermocouple locations, are essentially the same as listed for FV-10k
in Section 5.6.5.5, above, and in Table 5.11.

The heat for thawing of freeze valves 107 through 112 is conducted
along the pipe walls from the permanently-installed curved-plate ceramic
pipe line heaters on each side of the freeze valve section. The pipe
line heaters are described and listed in Section 5.6.6, following.

5.6.5.7 Freeze Valves 204 and 206. These two freeze valves

 

are located in the drain and fill lines for the coolant-salt system
and thus are not part of the primary circulating system. They are
described here, however, to complete the section on freeze valves.
Both freeze valves are located in the coolant cell, and both must be
thawed to completely drain the coolant-salt circulating system.

The flattened section of 1-1/2-in. pipe at each freeze valve

is the same as described for FV-103, Section 5.6.5.4. The 1500-w

(at 110 v) Calrod heater unit is identical to the one used on FV-103
(see ORNL Dwg E-GG-C-40603) except that the flat sides of the valves
are in the horizontal plane and the heaters are applied from the side,
FV 204 and 206 being approchable for direct maintenance a short time
after reactor shutdown. Curved-plate ceramic heaters are applied

to the process piping on each side of the freeze valves, as shown

on Dwg E-MM-Z-4T7489. The thermal insulation on the outside of the
line heaters is 3-in. of Careytemp 1600°F (Philip Carey Mfg. Company).
No thermal insulation is used around the center sections of the freeze
valves.

No cooling gas shrouds are used. The cooling air is supplied
through the 3/4-in. lines 906 and 907, each of which branches at a
tee beneath its freeze valve into two 3/8-in. steel pipes discharging
about 5/8 in. from the top and bottom outside surfaces of the valve.
See ORNL Dwg D-GG-E-41885 and Figure 5.35.

Two thermocouples are welded on the side of the center of the
flattened section of each valve, and two are applied to each shoulder.
In addition, single couples are installed about 5 in. upstream and
downstream of each valve, and two are on the reservoir pot located
between the two valves. Thermocouple locations are shown on ORNL
Dwg D-HH-B-LOSL3.

When the valves are to be thawed the cooling air supply is
stopped and the center heater is turned on until the temperature
measured at the center of the valve is greater than 1,000 - 1,100°F.
A frozen valve will thaw in less than 5 minutes. Without electric
power the valves will thaw in less than 25 min, by conduction of
heat, and will remain thawed for 30 min or more.

The center heater, if on, is turned off before the valves are
to be frozen. A cooling flow of 25 scfm of air will freeze a solid
salt plug in less than 15 min in either FV 204 or 206. After the
temperatures of the shoulders of the valves reach about T50°F, the
air flow is reduced to a holding rate of 5 scfm. Should the tempera-
ture of the center of the valve climb above T50°F the high air flow
rate will be resumed. Below 650°F the valves are deep frozen and

all air flow is cut off.

5.6.6 Pipe Insulation and Heaters

5.6.6.1 General Description and Design Considerations. All
salt-containing lines in the MSRE are thermally insulated and provided
with electrical heaters capable of maintaining the salt above the
liquidus temperature of 850°F.

The heaters can be broadly classified into the removable and

permanent types. The former are defined as those with the thermal

“insulation and heaters arranged into an integral unit that can be re-

moved and replaced by remotely-operated tooling as illustrated in
Figure 5.35. The types, which use more conventional materials and
methods of installation, are defined as those which would require
direct approach for maintenance, although in some instances this
would not be possible because of the activity level. All such per-
manent heaters have spare heating elements installed and connected
ready for use except for minor out-of-cell changes.

Some of the heaters at the more inaccessible sections of piping
have excess installed capacities so that they may be operated at re-
duced voltage to promote longer heater life. In general, vertical
lines require about twice the heater capacity needed for horizontal
pipes. The heaters are supplied with either single phase 115-v,
single phase 208 and 230-v, or three-phase 208-v power, and some are
connected in series and some in parallel, all as dictated by the
heater requirements and the nature of the electrical supply equip-
ment already on hand in Building 7503 at the start of the MSRE project.

The maximum amperage, total power per heater, and the watts
per ft of pipe length, as listed on the drawings and in Table 5.12,
are based on the current-carrying capacity of the electrical supply
equipment and not upon the power that can be delivered to each pipe
section without excessive heating of the materials. Such values
must be determined in the field during preliminary testing. of the
reactor. : oo

© The thermal insulation can be divided into (1) the metallic,
multiple-layer reflective type, and (2), the low thermal conductivity

ceramic fiber or expanded silica types. The reflective insulation

 
 

206

»

has the important characteristic of not dusting, and is used on all salt

lines in the reactor cell, with the exception of line 103. The low
conductivity types, as installed, have a lower heat loss per ft of pipe.

In selecting the materials, consideration was given to the resistance

,to radiation damage, accumulation of long-lived induced activity, and

to compatability with other materials in the system. Almost all the

removable heaters use reflective type insulation. (The removable heaters

at FV-104, 105 and 106 use the ceramic fiber type). Almost all per-

manent heaters use expanded silica insulation. -

At least one thermocouple is provided on the piping for each
heater unit. Anticipated "cold spots" in the piping have additional
couples.

With the exceptions noted below, all the pipe line heaters on the
portions of the fuel and coolant-salt piping within the reactor cell
are of the removable type. See Table 5.12. These heaters have
resistance wire embedded in flat ceramic plates and are arranged at
the top and sides of the piping. All the removable heaters in the
reactor cell use multi-layer reflective type insulation.

The vertical leg of piping in line 102 just below the primary
heat exchanger is very difficult to reach with remotely-operated
tools. The heaters for this section are a tubular type strapped
to the pipe. A set of spare heater elements is also installed.

This portion of piping would be removed with the heat exchanger
if repairs are needed. These heaters on line 102 have reflective +
type insulation.

The portions of lines 100 and 102 that pass through the thermal :
shield of the reactor also have removable type heater-insulation units,
as described above, but since access to them would require lifting of
the thermal shield plugs, each ceramic heater element is provided with
a duplicate set of resistance wires in the plates.

Line 103 is heated by passing an electric current through the
pipe wall itself. Non-removable, expanded silica insulation is applied
over the resistance-heated length, including the portion inside the

drain tank cell. See Section 5.6.6.2, following.
*ig

»

 

207

Lines 104, 105 and 106 in the fuel-salt drain tank cell have re-
movable heater-insulation units such as those used in the reactor cell.
The heaters on lines 107, 108 and 109 in the drain tank cell see
little service since the freeze valves in these lines are deep frozen
most of the time. In most part, these three lines have permanent
tubular-type heaters. Although they should be maintenance-free during
the life of the MSRE, duplicate spare heaters are installed. The
portion of the fuel-salt transfer line 110 located in the drain-tank
cell also has permanent tubular-type heaters, but, since this line
is used more often than 107, 108 and 109 (although still infrequently),
it is provided with two sets of spare heaters in each pipe section.
The section of line 110 in the fuel processing cell, and lines 111
and 112 in this cell, have permanent heaters and expanded silica in-
sulation. The equipment in the fuel processing cell will require
decontamination before approach for direct maintenance, therefore
spare heater elements are provided.
Some sections of the piping in lines 107 through 112, such as
adjacent to the freeze valves and at the drain tank furnace walls,
require a greater concentration of heat than is available from the
tubular heaters. Permanent curved-plate ceramic heaters are used
at these points.* See Table 5.12.
Direct maintenance can be used on the coolant-salt piping in
the coolant cell a short time after reactor shutdown. Tubular-type
heaters are strapped to the piping and covered with expanded silica
insulation. The penetrations through the reactor containment vessel
wall for the coolant salt lines 200 and 201 are provided with
ceramic plate heaters having spare heating wires. These heaters,
and the low-conductivity thermal insulation used with them, can
be removed by manipulation from the coolant cell end of the pene-
tration, but they cannot be as readily approached for direct maint-

enance as the other coolant cell equipment.

 

¥The energy input on & 1/2-in. NPS horizontal pipe is about 750
watts/ft from a ceramic plate type heater and about 200 vatts/ft
from a tubular type.

5.6.6.2 Pipe Heaters. The process piping is heated by three
methods: (1) ceramic plate and (2) tubular type heaters applied
to the piping, and (3) resistance heating of the pipe wall with an
electric current. The heaters are listed in Table 5.12 for each of
the sections of piping. The coolant-salt piping has been included
in this section to complete the discussion of heaters and insulation..

(1) Ceramic Plate Heaters. These heaters consist of nichrome
resistance wire embedded in a ceramic plate about 3/u in. thick to
form either flat plates 1/2-cylinder, or l/b-cylinder shapes curved -
to fit the pipes. These "Thermoshell" elements, manufactured by
the Cooley Electric Manufacturing Company (Indianapolis) are used
in a variety of sizes, but the flat plates are typically about 5
in. wide x 12 in. long. (See heater schedules on ORNL Dwgs E-MM-
A-51601 and 40833, 51661). As indicated in Table 5.12, some
ceramic plates have spare resistance wires.

The ceramic plates are largely composed of sodium atoms, but

small amounts of thorium, leading to 232pg, after irradiation, can

‘cause significant activity in the elements after long exposure.

The resistance heating wires are primarily nickel and chromium with
small amounts of cobalt. Induced activity, due to formation of 580
from the nickel and 604, from the natural cobalt, probably will re-
strict direct handling of heater units removed from ‘the reactor
ce11.118

(2) Tubular Heaters. These heaters are of the "Calrod" type, -
as furnished by the General Electric Company. The Inconel sheaths
are 0.315 in. OD. The lengths and capacities vary, as shown in
Table 5.12. The No. 12 wire extension leads are insulated with
ceramic beads, as shown in detail on ORNL Dwg E-MM-B-5167.

(3) Resistance Heating. Drain line 103 is heated by passing a
heavy electric current at 18 v through the pipe walls. The 25-kva
420/18-v transformer to supply the current is located in the south-
west corner of the drain tank cell. Leads from this transformer are
connected at about midpoint in the line, which is in the drain tank
cell near to the transformer. The current flows from this connection

to each end of the line. Electrical connections are made about 12 in.

from the intersection with line 104 and just inside the reactor furnace
on the other end. These connections are made by welding the lug to
the pipe. The return electrical connection from the pipe ends is
routed along the pipe as a single-No. 4 wire mineral-insulated cable
0.699 in. OD laid in special brackets about 4 in. above the line 103
insulation. See ORNL Dwg E-MM-A-562L40,

5.6.6.3 Thermal Insulation. Primary considerations in the
selection of the pipe line insulation were the tendency of the
materials to dust, the resistance to radiation damage and long-
term activation, the thermal conductivity, and the presence of
organic materials causing thermal deterioration or incompatability
with other materials in the system.

The multi-layer reflective type of insulation presents fewer
dusting problems as compared to the low-conductivity type and is
used almost exclusively in the reactor cell, although the stainless
steel does contain some cobalt which will become radioactive. The
reflective units have a higher heat loss than the latter, however,
as illustrated by the fact that horizontal sections of 5 in. pipe
with reflective insulation require, on the average, about 2,000
watts/ft of energy input whereas similar pipe sections with ex-
panded silica insulation require about 600 watts/ft.

Some compromises were necessary in selection of the low-conduc-
tivity insulation in that the good thermal conductivity and mechanical
properties must be coupled with good resistance to spread of air borne
contamination. Many mineral wool fibers contain significant cobalt or
organic materials. Both the ceramic fiber and the expanded silica types
selected for use in the MSRE are fired at 1200°F for about four hours
before installation to drive off small amounts of volatile sulfur and
chloride compounds. The types of insulation and the thicknesses used
are listed in Table 5.13.

(1) Reflective Insulation. Reflective insulation is used in all
but a few of the removable heater units. The typical reflective unit,
as manufactured by the Mirror Insulation Company (Lambertville,

New Jersey) consists of a removable section, which surrounds the

top and sides of the pipe, and a permanent bottom section which

is attached to the structure below the pipe and supports the top section.
The heater plates are mounted in clips in the top section and are re-
movable with it. Application of heat to only the top and sides was
demonstrated to give satisfactorily even temperature distribution to

the pipe contents. (The thermocouples for measuring the pipe wall
temperature are, for the most part, attached to the bottom of the pipe).

Starting at the inside, the first layer of reflective metal is
16 gage 310 stainless steel. The next layer is a sheet of pure silver
0.002 in. thick. The following nine layers are 321 stainless steel,
0.006 in. thick, arranged about 0.36 in. apart to provide a total
thickness for the assembly of about 4 in. The outside surface is 18
gage 304 stainless steel. The removable units have a lifting eye at
the top for handling with remote tooling.

Life tests on the heater-insulation units covering six months of
continuous operation at 14O0°F indicated about a 10% increase in the
heat loss due to change in the emissivity of the surfaces. The units
showed good resistance to warping. (See p 30 ref 117).

(2) Ceramic Fiber Insulation. "Fiberfrax", a product of the
Carborundum Company (Niagra Falls) is used in the paper form in the
freeze valve cooling gas shrouds, and in the blanket and bulk forms,
at such points as the removable heaters at FV 10%, 105 and 106. The
ceramic fiber is about 51.2% A104 and 47.8% 510, (by weight) and is
recommended for temperatures up to 2300°F. The thermal conductivity
of the blanket and bulk forms, when packed to a density of 6 1bs/£t°,
is 1.24 Btu-in./br-°F-£t° at 1000°F and 1.89 at 1400°F. The Fiber-
frax paper used in the MSRE is Type 970-JH, which contains no organic
binder. The paper has a thermal conductivity of 0.73 Btu-in./hr-ft°-°F
at 1,000°F and 0.95 at 1400°F. Activation analyses after 16 hrs in a
neutron flux of 7 x 10! n/cu’-sec indicated that the 140p with a
L4O-h half-life, and the Ma, with 15-h half-life measured 24 hours
after irradiation, gave 2.72 x 10° disintegrations per sec-gm and
1.87 dis/sec-gm, respectively. (See p 48 ref 108). These values
indicate relatively good resistance to long-lived activation
as compared to most inorganic, low-dusting, high-temperature insulation

with low thermal conductivities.

 
 

218

(3) Expanded Silica Insulation. The expanded silica insulating
material used in the MSRE is reinforced with inorganic fibers and has
the trade name "Careytemp 1600", and is marketed by the Philip Carey
Manufacturing Company (Cincinnati). The thermal conductivity is listed
as 0.76 Btu-in./hr-fto-°F at 1,000°F. It is recommended for use up to
1600°F. It contains no inorganics, has a low hygroscopicity, and has
good resistance to dusting. Irradiation with neutrons for 16 hrs at

3

a flux of 7 x 10M! n/cme-sec gave activations of 3.06 x 10” dis/sec-gm

for the 40-h half-life hop, 1.12 x 10% dis/sec-gm for the 85-4 46ge,

5.02 x 10° for the 45-4 pe, and 8.57 x 107 for the 15-h a (See
p 48 ref 108). The insulation is applied to the piping over the tubular

heaters in 1/2-cylinder molded shapes. It is then covered with asbestos

finishing cement and glass cloth, and a bonding adhesive to give a

glazed finish.

5.6.6.4 Pipe Line Thermocouples. Since the pipe line thermo-
couples are intimately associated with installation and operation
of the heaters and the insulation, they are briefly described here.
See Part II for a detailed description of the couples and the
associated circuitry.

Thermocouples are installed at the bottom of the pipe at each
heater unit in the reactor and drain tank cells, and at the more
important "cold spots." These spots, such as where pipe hangers
are attached, may have lower than average temperatures and are there-
fore of particular interest. As shown on Dwg E-HH-B-41713, and in
the thermocouple tabulation, ORNL Dwg D-AA-B-40511, many of the
couples on the reactor cell piping are provided with spares.

The coolant-salt piping also has a thermocouple at each heater
unit and at some of the cold spots, but very few spares are provided
since this piping is accessible for maintenance. An exception to this
is lines 204 and 206, which have spare couples at several points because
of the importance of knowing the condition of the line.

The penetrations of the coolant-salt piping through the reactor
containment vessel wall have thermocouples on the bottom of the pipe
spaced 12 in. apart. Each of these points is provided with a spare
couple. See ORNL Dwg E-HH-B-40537.

 
 

219

In all cases, except as noted below, the thermocouples are mineral-
insulated chromel-alumel wires in a 1/8-in. OD Inconel sheath. The
couple junction is welded to the end of the sheath, as described in
ORNL Spec MSR 63-40, and illustrated on ORNL Dwg D-GG-C-55509. An
INOR-8 strip, 1/4-in. wide x 0.0L5 in. thick, is shop-welded to the
end of the sheath. With the exception of the 1/2-in. NPS piping, the
ends of this strip are field-welded to pads, formed by welding, on
the process piping. The ends of the couples on 1/2-in. piping are
attached to a 1/8-in. high projection, formed by welding, on the out-
side of the pipe, and the thermocouple sheath is strapped to the pipe.
The same straps are used on all pipe sizes where it is necessary to
fasten the sheath to the pipe at points other than at the ends. The
INOR-8 banding material is 1/4 in. wide and fastened by a patented -
"Wraplock" process.

The duplex thermocouple sheaths described above are not used on
the reactor vessel discharge piping at the fuel pump inlet, line 100.
This set of three couples, and the associated spare, for measuring
this important temperature, use two single-wire 1/16-in. OD Inconel
sheaths, with the welded couple Junction made at the ends. Another
set of these "safety" couples is used in line 202 at the radiator out-
let. These single-wire couples also use 1/16-in. OD sheaths but are
not attached in the manner described above. Removable thermocouples
are used in thermowells at this point (202 A-1 through D-1) and at
the thermowell in the radiator inlet, line 201, to measure the At in
the coolant-salt flow through the radiator.

The thermocouples for line 103 are a special case in that an

electric current flows through the pipe wall. The thermocouple

sheath is insulated from the pipe with ceramic beads except for

about 1/4 in. at the end. The junction is an ungrounded type.

6. FUEL DRAIN TANK SYSTEM
6.1 General Description and Layout

The MSRE primary circulating system is provided with two fuel drain
tanks and & flush salt tank. The drain tanks are used to store the fuel
salt when it is drained from the reactor. Either of the two drain tanks
can store the entire salt content of the primary circulating system. The
flush salt tank is used to store the salt, which is circulated through
the primary system to clear it of oxides and other contaminants before
the enriched salt is added. (In addition, a fuel storage and reprocessing
tank is located in the fuel processing cell. This tank 1s described in
the chemical processing portion of this report, Part VII.)

The geometry of the fuel-salt drain tanks is such that the concen-
tration of uranium in the MSEE fuel salt (see Table 2.1) cannot produce
a critical mass under any conditions. 7 A fourfold increase in con-
centration would be necessary for criticality. Although studies have
1ndicatedt20? 121 that in equilibrium cooling of salt mixtures the last
phase to freeze may contain about three times the uranium concentration
in the original mixture, it is unlikely that the salt in the tanks will
freeze, in that this would require an electric power outage of more than
20 hr, or that gross segregation of the concentrated phase could take
Place in a large-sized tank having so many thimbles on which initial
solidification would take place. 122 The risk of criticality can be
eliminated altogether by dividing a fuel-salt charge between the two
drain tanks. One tenk will be kept empty for this contingency. |

The two drain tanks and the flush salt tank are located in the drain
tank cell, which is Just north of the reactor cell and connected to it by
a short 36-in.-diem tunnel. The drain tank cell is constructed of heavily

reinforced concrete, lined with stainless steel, and of the general dimen- -

sions given in Section 4.3.2, The layout of the equipment in the cell is
indicated in Figs. 4.b and 4.5, and is shown in more detail in ORNL Dwg.
E-GG-D-41512. The arrangement was primarily influenced by the requirement
that all maintenance operations be performed from overhead. Other con-
siderations were the arrangement and flexibility of the piping, and the

relative elevations so that the reactor could drain by gravity.

The drain line from the bottom of the reactor vessel, line 103,
branches inside the drain tank cell into three lines which lead to the
two drain tanks and to the flush salt storage tank. The fuel salt lines
from these tanks, which permit interchange of salt with the fuel process-
ing ares, combine into a single pipe, line 110, before leaving the drain
tank cell. Each of the six lines mentioned bas a freeze valve, as
described in Section 5.6.5.

The three branches of the reactor drain and £111 line, line 103,
reduce from 1-1/2-in, sched-lO to l-in. pipe where each passes through
the tank heating furnace and makes a loop about kl in. in diameter, encom-
passing about 340°, then enters the respective tank through the top head.
This loop provides the flexibility needed to prevent pipe reaction forces
due to thermal expansion from overly affecting the tank weigh cells used
to judge the salt inventory. The loops also reduce the thermal stresses
in the piping.

Each tank is provided with an electrically heated furnace to main-
tain the contents in a molten condition. Portions of the salt lines are
provided with removeble heater units and others have permanently installed
Calrod-type heating units, as described in Section 5.6.6. The reactor
drain line 103 is unique in the reactor system in that it is heated by
passage of an electric current through the pipe wall itself. The drain
line is heated by this method from a point at the reactor furnace wall
to about 1 ft from the branch point inside the drain tank cell, a distance
of sbout 64 ft, and requires sbout 17 kw. The 25-kva high-current elec-
trical transformer, 420 to 18 v, 1s located in the drain tank cell (see
Section 19.7.3.2). | | |

It has been estimated that, on opening of the freeze valve in line
103, eleven to thirteen minutes are required for sufficient salt to drain
from the primary system to leave the reactor core region one-fourth
empty. 123 About 30 min 1s required for all the salt to drain.

The two drain tanks are each provided with a heat removal system of
100-kw capacity. This rate of heat dissipation is required for the first
80 hr after shutdown; about 50 kw is needed in 80- to 500-hr period, 12
The heat removal system consists of 32 thimbles, 1.9 in. in diameter,

 
 

yx

222

immersed in the salt, and containing bayonet tubes in which water is =
evaporated. The steam from the tubes is collected in a steam drum
located sbove each tank and piped to condensers outside the drain tank
cell. The condensate is returned by gravity in & closed cycle.

Transfer of the salt from one part of the system to another is accom-
plished by pressurization with helium gas. The gas is admitted at the top
of the tenks through lines 572, 57h, and 576. All salt lines enter near
the top of the tanks and have dip tubes to the bottom. The tanks are
provided with weigh cells, as described in Pert IT.

Provisions are made to cut the piping to permit replacement of the -
drain tanks and freeze valves. Lines 104, 105, and 106 can be cut and .
rejoined later by a brazed-on sleeve applied at the cut, using remotely
operated tooling developed at ORNi,, This special equipment is described =
in Part X. Lines 107, 108, and 109 have one-half of a 150-1b, slip-on,
ring-Jjoint flange installed in them. If a tank is removed, the line
leading to the flange involved is cut on the tank side of the flange.

The replacement tank can have a mating flange, or, as seems most likely,
a blank flange can be bolted in place, If the line is blanked off, lines
104, 105, ‘and 106 can be used to interchange the salt between the tanks
by manipulation of the appropriate freeze valves. The sslt can then be

transferred to the fuel storage tank through whichever of lines 107, 108, .
and 109 remain.
The steam drum liquld-level lines have cone-sealed, single-bolt, yoke *

type disconnect couplings, which were designed and developed at ORNL, and
are described in Part II. The gas lines have special L-bolt flanged dis-
connect joints installed in the horizontal position to facilitate remote
maintenance. Detalled discussions of the maintenance procedures are given
in Part X.

in Part XI, and operating procedures are given in Part VIII.

As shown in the flowsheet, Fig. 6.1, the fuel drain tanks, FD-1 and
FD-2, and the fuel flush tank, FFT, are provided with 1 in./1-1/2-in.
sched-40 lines 106, 105, 104, respectively, to permit interchange of the
fuel salt with the primary circulating system. Each of these three lines
includes a freeze valve for positive, non-modulating control of the salt
flow. The freeze valves are simply flattened sections of 1-1/2-in. sched-~
40 pipe, which can be either heated by electric heating elements or cooled
by a jet of cell atmosphere gas. The freeze valves are described in
Section 5.6.5.5. | :

The main supply for the freeze valve cooling gas is the 2-in. sched-4oO
line 920, which branches into 3/k-in. lines 908, 909, 901, to supply each
freeze valve. These three lines are provided with control valves and remote
hand-operated regulators.

A short, vertical cylinder of k-in. pipe is included in the salt piping
on the tank side of each valve to form a reservoir which assures that the
freeze valve section will be filled with salt. Either freeze valve FV-105
or 106 is always thawed during operation of the reactor to permit ready
drainage of the circulating system into one of the drain tanks. The other
valve is operated in a frozen condition such that the heat stored in the
adjacent piping and heater box will cause the valve to thaw on loss of
heater electrical power and coolant flow. All other valves on the drain
tank system, FV-107 through 110, are deeply frozen and will remain 80
even on loss of power. The times required for freezing and thawing are
indicated in Table 5.11.

Helium gas pressurization and vent lines control the transfer of salt
from one part of the system to another. The tops of the drain tanks and
flush tanks are vented to the top of the fuel-salt circulating pump bowl

‘through the 1/2-in. sched-4O pipes, lines 5hl, 545, and 546. Each of
these lines contains a pneumatically actuated control valve which can be
positioned from a remote location by a hand-operated regulator. The
three lines combine to form 3/k-1in. line 521 leading to the pump bowl.
This vent line not only permits transfer of the cover gas as the salt is
being exchanged between the primary circulating system and the storage

 

yA

 
 

“lu

. 225

tanks, but provides a large gas "cushion" so that the overpressure in the

“pump bowl can be more evenly maintained.’

The gas line from the top of each tank is connected to the charcoal
beds through lines 573, 575, and 577. These lines contain control valves
with remote hand regulators and combine to form 1/2-in. line 561 leading
to the off-gas system. Co

Helium for the cover gas and pressurization is supplied at about 40
psig through the 1/2-1in. line 517 to. the pressure control valve PCV-51T,
which delivers the gas at sbout 30 psig-to the branch-pipes, lines 572, 57k,
and 576, leading to the top of each salt storage tank. A flow restrictor
is installed upstream of PCV-51T7 to limit the rate at which the fuel can
be transferred to the reactor... When the reactor system 1s sbout two-
thirds full, this rate is 1/2 £3 of .salt per minute. The three branch
lines have check valves and-pneumatically.-actuated control valves po-
sitioned by hand regulators. The.three lines are also provided with
pressure transmitters for the recorders and the alarm system. Vent lines
582, 584, and 586 from the transmitters contain floating diaphragm seals
vhich would store any ges thet might escape a lesking transmitter. These
lines vent to line 588, a 1/k-in. OD tube, leading to the radiation
monitors RIA 596A and 596B, and then to line 937 and the off-gas dis-
charge stack. -

Decay heat is removed from the drained fuel salt in FD-1 and FD-2 by
bayonet-type, bolling-water cooling tubes. The steam drum, or dome, above
each drain tank separates. the. water. from the steam-water mixture dis-
charged from the tubes, and recycles the-water to the tubes. The saturated
steam 1s transported by 3-in. sched-L0 steinless steel pipes, lines 80k
and 805, to condensers, DIC~1l-and DIC-2, located in the west tunnel area.
The condensers sre cooled by-process. water. circulated through lines 810
end 811, end 812 and 813. Condensate flows by gravity from the condensers
to feedwater storage tanks-located beneath the condensers vie 1-in. lines
878 end 879. Water is recirculated-from the feedwater tanks by gravity
feed to the steam drum through l-in. sched-UtO stainless steel pipes, lines
806 and 807. Valves LCV-806 end LIC-807, for these valves are connected
to the steam drum but are located in the transmitter room. The maximum
rate of feedwater flow 1s ebout 2.1 gpm. When the decay heat generation

 
 

 

 

226

is low, intermittent operation.of. the..cooling system is required. To .
reduce the cooling rate to zero, the water flow is shut off and the tubes
allowed to evaporate to dryness. Steam from-the X-10 plant is condensed
to provide water for the heat removal system. Both the condensers and
the feedwater tanks are vented to the vapor condensing system through
lines 808, 809, 888, and 889. These lines join to form l-in. line

338, which leads to line 980 connecting the vapor-condensing system to

the primary containment. The top of each steam drum is vented to its
respective condenser through lines 804 and 805.

The 1/2-in. sched-4O pipes, lines 107, 108, and 109, which dip to
the bottoms of the flush tank, FFI, and the drain tanks, FD-1 and FD-2,
are used to interchange salt between the tanks and the fuel processing
cell. Each of these lines is provided with a freeze valve before they
merge to form line 110, a 1/2-in. sched-40 pipe leading to the fuel
storage tank, FST. The freeze valves and the juncture with line 110
are shown on the fuel processing flowsheet, Fig. 6.2 (ORNL Dwg. AA-A-40887)
shown here for convenience. These freeze valves are equipped with the
salt reservoirs at both ends of the flattened portion to assure salt in
the valve at all times. The freeze valves are provided with thermocouples
in an identical manner with the valves on lines 104, 105, and 106, described
above. The 1 to 15 cfm (std) of cooling gas needed for the valves is
supplied through lines 911, 912, and 913, which branch from line 920,
previously mentioned.

6.3 Drain Tanks No. 1 and 2

6.3.1 Description

The drain tanks are 50 in, in diameter and about 86 in. high, not
including the steam dome, and hold about 80.2 £13) of salt contained in
the primary circulating loop. The tare weight of a drain tank, including
the steam drum, etc., is TO00 lb. The maximum weight 1s about 17,000 lb.
Other dimensions of the tanks are given in Table 6.1.

The top head of each drain tank acts as a tube sheet for 33 thimbles
of 1-1/2-in. sched-4O INOR-8 pipe, about T7-1/2 in. long, which extend
into the tanks to about the elevation of the lower head welds. All but
one of the thimbles project about 11 in. above the upper head. The re-
maining thinble 1s for thermocouples. The 32 thimbles are evenly spaced

127

on two circles concentric with the centerline of each tank, 20 on the
outer circle, and 12 on the inner one. The thimbles serve as recept-
acles for the bayonet-type cooling tubes and have flared openings at
the upper end to facilitate insertion of the bayonets. It may be noted
that two independent barriers, the thimble wall and the bayonet tube |
wall, separate the fuel salt from the water. The annular gas space
between the two walls 1s open to the cell atmosphere, which is continu-
ously monitored for the presence of fuel salt, water, and the products
of their reaction. |

The fuel transfer lines 108 and 109 enter the drain tanks through the
upper head flange and extend downward to a cup at the center of the lower
head. This cup, which is fabricated of a 2-in. INOR-8 pipe cap welded

to the outside of thw lower head, makes it possible to remove essentially

all the salt from the tank.

Lines 105 and 106, which are used to exchange fuel salt with the
primary circulating system, enter through the top head of each tank and
extend downward, with a bend at the lower end, to terminate approximately
2.5/8-1in. above the lower head, and near its center. The lower end of
each of these pipes is closed, and a segment of the pipe wall is cut away

~ at the bottom end to provide an opening which does not draw salt from the

bottom of the tank. This leaves a "heel" of about 1/2 £3 of salt below
the inlet to minimize the likelihood of transferring any solids from the
bottom of the drain tank into the fuel circulating system.

The above-mentioned interior fuel-salt piping is held in position .
inside the tank by restraining brackets febricated of 1/b-in.-diam >
INOR-8 rod.

A nozzle is provided in the top head of each tank for installation
of the level probes, LD-1 and ID-2. The probes are the single-point,
conductivity type, and indicate whether the salt level is above or below
points marking 5% and 90% of the salt volume.

A 3-in. pipe nozzle st the center of the head serves as an inspection
port and can also be used for installation of a salt sampler. The closure <
for this nozzle is an eight-bolt blind flange with an integral ring-joint
gasket provided with leek detection openings.

A 1/2-in, nozzle on the top head serves as a common connection for

t

helium cover-gas venting and pressurization lines 572 and 573 on FD-1,
and for lines 5Th and 575 on FD-2. The lines are provided with a large
loop encircling the top of the tank, in much the same manner as the drain
lines, to provide flexibility. The nozzle, the- short length of connected
piping, and the disconnect flangé are of INOR-8. (Beyond this point the
lines are fabricated of stainless steel.) The four-bolt disconnect
flange is a l-in. size, but is drilled for 1/2-in. NPS, with a side out-
let to permit installation in a horizontal position and easy access to
the bolting from above.

The INOR-8 steam drum and selt-cooling bayonets are an integral
unit. The 32 bayonets are-febricated-of 1-in. sched-4O INOR-8 pipe, as ¢
shown in Figs. 6.3 and 6.4. A 1/2-in. OD tube on the inside of each *
bayonet serves as the downcomer for the entering feedwater. The l-in.

”

bayonet size increases to 1-1/2-in. pipe size above the elevation of

the thimble openings, and. a 1l-1/2-in. corrugated, flexible Inconel hose

is welded to each. (The corrugations are covered with stainless steel

braiding.) The other end of each hose is welded to 1-1/2-in. nozzles

at corresponding positions on the bottom of the steam drums. The 1/2-in,
dowmcomers have stripwound Ihconel flexible hoses in the same relative

position. This flexible arrangement provides for the differences in

radial thermal expansion between the drain tank upper head and the steam

drum.¥* The weight of the steam-and-water-filled bayonets is not imposed o
on thé flexible hose couplings but is carried by a plate on which a collar £

welded to each bayonet tube rests.. This 1/4-in, 304 stainless steel plate
is suspended from the steam drum by four 1/4-in,-diem stainless steel wire
cables. The plate clears the tops-of the thimbles by 1/4-in. so that
none of the weight of the steam.drum-and attached bayonets is carried by
the drain tank itself (see Section 6.3.5, following).

The 1-1/2-1n. nozzles on the-bottom of the steam drums extend about
7 in. into the drums. The 1/2-in. downcomer tubes bend inside these
nozzles and exit through the nozzle wall. The elevation of these exit
openings alternates in adjacent thimbles on both bayonet ¢ircles, one-half
being at 1 in. gbove the steam drum lower head and the other half at 5 in.
(see ORNL Dwg. D-FF-A-40U65). With this arrangement, the water level in
the drum may be adjusted to-take. one-half of the cooling thimbles out of
service and thus obtain better control of the temperature of the salt
stored in the tank. :

The 48-in.-diam by 16-1n. high eteam-drum has an 8-in. pipe pene-
tration through it at the center (see Fig. 2.6 and ORNL Dwg. D-FF-A-LOUS6).
The central openings allow the 3-in, inspection nozzle on the drain tank
to extend sbove the steam drum. for eccessibility. Lifting eyes on the
top of the steam drum allow the. drum and the attached bayonet tubes to
be raleed end set aside for-maintenance on the drain tanks. The 3-in.
steam outlet and the 1/2-1n. water inlet connection nozzles on the steam
drum are fabricated of INOR-8 between the drum and the bolted disconnect
couplings. The mating flenges snd the-remainder of the piping in the heat
removal system ere: 304 stainless-steel. The 3-in. steam piping conteins
a corrugated, bellow-type , -stainless steel expansion Joint in a horizontal
run inside the drain. tenk. cell.. ~The. 1/2-1n. water line has sufficient
flexibility without. use of an expansion. joint. The condensers , .and the
feedwater tanks used in the heat removal systems are described in
Section 6.3.3. A.

The drain-tank wall temperature is monitored by 20 thermocouples.
Two of these are located on the top head at the fuel system drain and
£111 line; four are located on the bottom heed, two of which are at the
center; the remaining 1h are distributed over the cylindrical tank wall.
Two of the thermocouples on the wall are at the tank charging line. The
data logging system is supplied with thermocouple readings from the fuel

 

 
 

 

234

system fill line, the tank charging line, the tank wall near the midplane,
and at the center of the bottom. One of the tank wall thermocouples is
connected to a temperature recorder and the remaining lead to a scanner
vhich monitors and displays the values. The previously mentioned thermo-
couple bayonet assenbly, which is inserted into a thimble in the drain
tank, carries five pairs of thermocouples distributed over its length,
One of the lower of these couples is connected to the data logger and one,
Just above midplane, has its output read on a temperature indicator.

6.3.2 Design -
The drain tanks, thimbles, bayonet cooling tubes, steam drums, and

all attachments welded to them, with the exception of the flexible hoses,
are fabricated of INOR-8 and generally in accordance with Specification
MSR-62-3.120 The flexible hoses were fabricated of Inconel and meet

the specifications of Section VIII of the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel
Code. *T Lo

The drain tanks will withstand an internal pressure of 65 psig and
1300°F in accordance with. the requirements of Section VIII of the ASME
Unfired Pressure Vessel Code, for primary nuclear vessels.’ 0 The
allowable stress in INOR-8 at 1300°F was taken to be 3500 ps1. 16 The
calculations for wall and head thicknesses, etc.,-were based on standard
relationships and are presented in Part IV of Ref. 18 and in Ref. 10.4.
Basic design data are shown in Table 6.1.

Calculations covering.differential thermal expansion between the
drain tanks and steam drums,. and transient and off-design operating con-
ditions, are also given in.Part IV.of Ref. 18.

The drain tank and cooling. system was designed for a cooling rate
of 100 kw. Heat transfer and hydraulic computations are given in Part IV,
Ref. 18.

{

6.3.3 Decay Heat Removal System

The heat generated by the decay of fission products in the fuel
salt stored in the drain tanks is removed by boiling water in bayonet
tubes inserted in thimbles which are immersed in the salt. This arrange-
ment provides double barrier protection between the salt and the water.

The saturated steam-water mixture from the bayonets is discharged
into a steam drum, where the water is separated and recycled to the
bayonets. The steam is condensed outside the. drein tenk cell and the
condensate returned by gravity through flow-control valves to the down-
comers in the bayonet cooling tubes. The reliability of the system is
enhanced by this simplicity of operation.

The drain tanks, thimbles-bayonet tubes, and steam drums, all
located in the drain tank cell, have been described in Section 6.3.1
The condensers and feedwater tenks are located in the west tunnel, an
area which is not accessible vhen the reactor is in operation but can de
entered a short time after shutdown.

The two condensers are commercisl. shell and tube units, about 8-5/8 in,
dien by T £t 10-1/2 in. long, with ebout 38 £t2 of surfece and a capacity
of 300 kw. Other dimensions and date are given in Table 6.2. The units
meet the requirements of the ASME. Unfired Pressure Vessel Code, Section
VIII, for secondary nuclear vessels. 'd The shell-side design pressure
1s 50 psig, although the steam will condense in the shell at essentially
atmospheric pressure. The cooling water, or tube-side, design pressure
is 150 psig. The shell, tubes, and baffles are all febricated of 304
stainless steel.

The two cylindrical feedwater tanks are 36 in. in diameter and about
24 in. high, including the ASME flanged and dished torispherical heads.
Each has a volume of about 10.5.-£63, They are constructed of 304 stain-
less steel, vith a wall thickness of 3/16 in., in accordance with the
requirements of Section VIII.of the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel Code,
for secondary nuclear vessels.'d --Each tank 1s supported by four legs,
and the bottom of the. tank is.sbout 12 in. sbove floor level. A l-in.
nozzle at the center of the lower heed serves as both the condensate
inlet and outlet, the tanks "floating" on lines 806 end 807. Both top
and bottom heads have 1/2-in; -nozzles for the level indicator connections,
the top nozzle elso serving as a vent for the tank, A 2-in. flanged nozzle
is provided at the top of each tank &s an inspection port.

As previously mentioned a feedwater control valve in each heat
removal system, ICV 806 and ICV 807, control the gravity flow of conden-
sate from the condensers and feedwater tanks to the steam drums, These

pneumatically operated valves were selected to fail in the open position,
since overheating the drain tanks is more serious than overcooling, par-
ticularly in that the latter could be largely overcome by the electric
heaters. By controlling the water level in the drums, the entrance
openings at two levels in the bayonet tube downcomers permit the cooling
capacity to be off, one-half off, or all in operation, thus affording
control of the salt temperature in the drain tanks.

The condenser shell spaces and the feedwater tanks are vented to the
vapor-condensing system tanks, which are at essentially atmospheric
pressure. The entering steam drives the air out. When the steam supply
is cut off, air will be drawn in as the remaining steam condenses.

All the water in the heat removal systems can be stored in the feed-
water tanks. The water in the steam drums can be evaporated, using the
drain tank heaters, and collected in the feedwater tanks.

Design calculations are given in Part IV of Ref. 18.

6.3.4 Drain Tank Electric Heaters and Insulation

The two drain tanks are heated by cylindrical "furnaces" surrounding
the tank walls. The tank tops, bottoms, and heater units are enclosed in
canned insulation units. The heaters for drain tank FD-1 have a total
capacity of 46.9 kw and those for FD-2 a total capacity of 45.0 kw. The
difference in heater capacity is due to the arrangement of heaters re-
quired for the different nozzle locations on the two tanks.

The tank wall heaters are arranged in removable vertical sections,
or panels, each about 2 3/8 in. thick {see ORNL Dwgs E-MM-B-5168k and
51685). The heaters are arranged into two groups, an upper and a lower,
each group being supplied with electric power from a separate induction
regulator (see heater schedule, ORNL.Dwg E-MM-B-51651). There are two
widths of panels, one covering about 35° of the tank circumference, and
the other about 15°. On FD-1 there are six of the large panels, with a
capacity of 3680 watts (at 230 v) each, and one of the smaller panels
(1360 watts at 230 v), in the upper group of heaters. There are a simi-
lar number in the lower group. Drain tank FD-2 has five of the larger

units and three of the smaller in each of the upper and lower groups.

 
 

 

 

 

238

The heaters in each group are connected-in parallel to the wye-
connected secondary of the power transformer. Unlike other heaters in
the MSRE, one terminal of each of the drain tank heaters 1s grounded
through the grounded center tap of the transformer wye.

Each of the large panels conteins four heating elements consisting
of curved ceramic plates in which the nichrome heating wire is embedded.
The elements are mounted in stainless steel frames and enclosed in 16-gage
347 stainless steel to complete the panel assembly. Each panel has a
lifting hook and separate power and thermocouple disconnects (see ORNL
Dwg. E-MM-B-51610).

The outside of the heaters and the tank bottoms are insulated with
two 2-in.-thick layers of expanded. silica (Careytemp 1600°F - see Section
5.6.6.3) insulation. The high temperature side of the sheet metal cans
for the insuletion is fabricated of ll-gage 347 steinless steel. The
low temperature, or outside, surface of the cans is 16-gage carbon steel.
An insulated cover fits between the steam drum and the drain tank at an
elevatién Just below the bayonet. tube positioning plate. This location
permits the primary system. drain.end f£ill lines to be inside the heated
furnace, The U4-1/2-in,-thick cover is fabricated more or less in place
and is an integral part of the steam drum and bayonet tube assembly. A
6-in.=-wide portion of the cover on the outer circumference consists of
two 2-in,-~thick layers of expanded silica insulation. The remaining inner
portion is insulated with ceramic fibers (Fiberfrax - see Section 5.6.6.3).
This flexible type of insulation is. used because it is easier to fit
around the large number of bayonet cooling tubes. The insulated cover
is canned in 1l6-gage 347 stainless steel on both sides.

All of the drain tank heaters are designed for use and none are
connected as spares. The installed cepacity of about 45 kw for each
tank, however, is greatly in excess of the 20-kw measured heat loss from
a drain tank at 1200°F. The same tests indicated that about 34 kw is

required to heat the tanks from 50 to 1150°F at a rate of 67°F per —

6.3.5 Supports for Drain Tanks
Each of the two drain tanks is supported by two columns resting on
the drain tank cell floor (see ORNL Dwg. E-FF-D-41500). The supports

were designed for a load of 17,000 1,127 Each drain tank installation
incorporates two pneumatic weigh cells for estimating the inventory of salt
in the tanks,

Each drain tank is provided with a support skirt welded to the tank
Just above the upper head- circumferential weld. Twelve type 316 stainless
steel hanger rods, 3/4 in. OD by 15 in. long, are fastened by clevis-
type couplings to this skirt and suspend the tank from'a support ring
located at about the elevation of the bottom of the steam drum. This
carbon steel support ring is sbout 53 in. OD x 6-1/2 in. wide x 8 in. deep,
built up of steel plates, and has two 22-3/k-in.-long arms extending from
it on opposite sides. Each of these arms is suspended by three hanger
bolts, 1/2-in. OD by 38 in. long,- fabricated of carbon steel’, from a
pneumatic weigh cell resting on. top of & support column. Each of these
two welgh cells hes a point support consisting of a bearing ball 3/4 in.
in diameter. The support columns are fabricated of 5-in. sched-4O carbon
steel pipe, except for the top.2k-1n. , vhich is k-in. sched-4O pipe, and
rest on the drain tank cell floor. The columns pass through holes in the
arms on the support ring with. 1/k-1in. clearance on a diameter, an amount
sufficient to allow proper-coperation.of the weigh cells while at the same
time to prevent the tank assenbly from falling off the two support points.
The long hanger bolts and the point. support arrangement reduces the
horizontal leading on the weigh cells to a negligible amount.

The steam drum and bayonet. assembly also rests on the support ring
mentioned above and is thus a part of the total loading indicated
by the weigh cells.

To effect maintenance on a weigh cell or prior to removal of a drain
tank of its cooling system, the weight of the drain tank assembly must
be removed from the weigh cells. To accomplish this, the end of each
support ring arm is equipped with a jack bolt which operates against
a bracket on the supporting colums Just below the arm. A slight lifting
of the arm by this bolt will permit unthreading of the three hanger bolts
on each weigh cell. It may be desireble to remove the weight from the

 

¥ASTM A-193 Grade BT.

 
 

240

Jack bolts for example to prevent swaying during removal or replacement
of the steam drum and bayonet assembly. To provide for this a collar is
installed on each column Just below the arm onto which the weight of the
essenbly cen be lowered by backing off the Jack bolts.

On initial installation, the bayonet tubes were lined up and guided
into the thimble openings under shop conditions. Replacement of the
steam drum - bayonet tube assembly in the radioactive drain tank cell
environment requires use of a guide plate slipped over the lower end of
the bayonets to align them for-entry into the thimble openings. The
thinbles have flared openings to assist in this operation. Once inserted,
the steam drum assembly is lowered, . with the guide plate slipping up the
beyonets, and the plate is left in place resting on the tops of the
thinbles. Further description of maintenance procedures is given in
Part X.

6.4 - Fuel Flush Tank

The flush-salt storage tenk is located in the drain tank cell, Fig.
Lh and Fig. 4.5, and is used to store the salt used to cleanse the primary
system prior to charging with fuel salt. The flush salt consists primarily
of 66% 11'F and 3% BeF), (see Table 2.1 and Part IV).

The flush-salt tank has the same dimensions as the fuel drain tanks
(see Section 6.3, above) but is two inches shorter in overall height. The
tank has a storage capacity of 82.2 £t3, however, as compared to 80.2 £t3
in the drain tanks because of the absence of cooling thimbles. The materials
of construction and the design criterias are the same as for the drain
tanks. The design data are summarized in Tsble 6.3. The design calcu-
lations are presented in Part IV of Ref. 18.

The flush selt tank 1s supported in the seme manner as the drain
tanks and is heated by an identical electric furnace arrangement having a
capacity of 8.8 kw, The thermal insulation is arranged in essentially
the same fashion. The tank temperature is monitored by 15 thermocouples.
Two are on the top head and four are on the bottom head with two of the
latter at the center. The other nine thermocouples are distributed over
the tank wall surfaces, with two of these at the charging line.

the fuel salt circulating pump bowl, via lines 576 and 546, and to the
off-gas system, through lines 576 and 577, each of which has pneumatically
operated control valves actuated by hand-operated regulators located on

6.5 Salt-Transfer Pipe Line Supports

Drain line 103-is supported by nine. constent-load Bergen supports »
as shown in Table 6.4. Three of these supports are located in the reactor
cell and six are in the drain.tenk cell. Pipe hangers (both mmbered S-5)
support each end of a beam passing through the opening between the reactor
and drain tank cells to support that portion of line 103. Line 103 is
anchored at the heating lug connection near the junction with line 104 in
the drain tank cell.

Line 104, 105, 106, and-110 each have one constant-load type pipe
support. The 1/2-in. piping, lines 107, 108, and 109 are mounted in
simple fixed pipe hangers.

T. SAMPLER-ENRICHER SYSTEM

The MSRE includes provisions for dipping 10-g samples of salt
from both the fuel and coolant-salt pump bowls while the reactor is in
operation. Shielded carriers are provided for transporting the samples
to the analytical laboratory. Chemicsl analyses of the samples provide
frequent observations of the behavior of the salts and, in the case of
the fuel salt, of the uranium inventory in the system.

The sample-taking system may also be used during reactor operation
to add up to 150 g of enriching salt (72 mole % LiF - 28 mole % UF),) per
sample capsule, to compensate for the burnup of fissile material. Should

n

it become necessary, the same system may also be used to add a nuclear
poison (11% -Ber,) to the fuel-salt circulating loop. (To make gross
changes in the fuel-salt composition, it is necessary that it all be
drained from the circulating system and transferred to the fuel-salt
processing cell.)

The sampler-enricher systems for the fuel-salt and coolant salt
systems operate on the same principle. The primary differences between
the two stem from the fact that the radioactivity level in the coolant
salt is much less than in the fuel salt, that the containment of fission-
product gases is not a problem, and that the equipment can be approached
a short time after reactor shutdown for adjustment and maintenance. The *
fuel-system sampler-enricher is described in Sections 7.1 through 7.9.
The equipment for the coolant-salt system is briefly covered in Section

7.10.

T.1 Brief Description of Operation

The sampler-enricher system consists of a 1-1/2-in,-diam transfer
tube connecting the top of the pump bowl to a two-chambered, shielded
transfer box on the operating floor level. A small copper capsule,
fastened to the small wire cable by a special latch, is lowered through
the tube into a cage beneath the surface of the sglt in the fuel-pump
bowl. The capsule, with its lU-cc sample (10 g of salt), is then pulled ,

up through the tube, through two gate valves, and into the shielded oO

245

leaktight trensfer box. Using a simple manipulator and a periscope,
the sample capsule is unlatched from the ceble and transferred to a
transport container gbout 1-3/8-in, in diameter by 18-in. long. After
the transfer box has been purged, a removal tool is inserted and the
transport container is pulled up into a lead-shielded transport cask.
This cask is then placed in a sealed container and tsken to the ana-
lytical chemistry facilities in the X-10 Ares of ORNL.

Two or more barriers are provided at all times to guard against
escepe of radioactive gases or particulates. Eight inches of lead, or
equivelent, shield the operator from radioactivity. A system of inter-
locks in the sampler-enricher system prevents accidental opening of
velves, etc.

A procedure in reverse of that described ebove is used for adding
enriched salt to the system. A longer copper cepsule is used, holding
30 cc. This capsule is lowered into the pump bowl where the enriched
material quickly melts and drains through openings in the capsule as it
is raised from the bowl, Poison material may be added in essentially

the same manner.

7.2 Design Criteria

The unique features of the sampler-enricher system--primarily the
fact that the sample~transfer tube passes through both the primary and
secondary containment berriers in the MSRE--led to adoption of relatively
stringent criterie for the design of the — In summary these
are:

7.2.1 Sampling

"The samples teken must be representative of the salt circulating in
the system. It may also be desirsble at times to take separate samples
in which the material floating on the surface of the selt in the pump
bowl predominates. Each sample must be easily removeble from the cap-

~ sule, and all of it recovered for chemical analysis. Approximately

Lk ce (10 g) of salt mist be isolated per sample » end the system must be
capsble of taking three samples per 24 hr for one year or more. During
prenuclear runs, etc., the sampling may be more often.

 
 

 

»

246

7.2.2 Enriching

About 30 cc (150 g) of enriching salt (72 mole % 18 - 28 mole %
UF) ri be added per capsule. Each 30-cc eddition will contain 90 g
of U and/or thorium. The capsule must drein completely, and re-
covery of the empty capsule must be assured. The enriching salt must
enter the circulating fuel stream as a liquid, not as a solid.

T.2.3 Poisoning

The system mist be capable of adding a nuclear poison to the fuel-
salt-pump bowl at all times, including outages of the electrical power

supply.

T.2.4 Addition of Contaminants

.

Belium ges introduced into the salt loops during sampling or en-
riching operstions must be of reactor grade. Portions of the system
in contact with the salt must be fabricated of INOR-8 or other materials
thet will not edd contaminants to the system. A dry inert atmosphere
mst be maintained around the sample at all times, including transport
to the analytical laboratory. (The capsule may be fired in a hydrogen
atmosphere prior to use to remove the oxide film.)

T.2.5 Containment

Fission-product gases entering the sampling compartment mst be
purged to the off-gas system prior to removal of a sample. The sample
mst be sealed in a shielded container during transport. Portions of 3
the sampler system which could be contaminated by particles of sslt
must be sealed from exposure to the atmosphere. Double conteinment
mist be provided in such e manner that breaching of one barrier will
not result in the release of radiosctivity to the environment.

All mechanical seals and valves in the primary areas must be
buffered with helium gas to a pressure higher than that in the reactor
system, and legk-detection equipment must be provided. Any portion of
the system not structurally strong, such as the flexible bellows, must —
be buffered with ges under & pressure less than that in the primary Oo

br

.)
 

 

 

Aig

system, and the buffered space must be vented to the containment air
system. Exhaust hoods must be provided in the operating floor areas
where the sampler-enricher equipment is located.

(For convenience, the containment areas in the sampler-enricher
system were classified as follows: Portions of the primary contain~
ment were designated l-a, 1l-b, etc. Areas of secondary containment,
such as the interior parts of the valve box, were designated 2-a, 2-b,
ete. The outer compartment of the transfer box, also a secondary con-
tainment area during certain phases of the operating procedure, is
designated 3-a, etc. See Fig. 7.3.)

All portions of the primary and secondary containment areas must
be helium leak checked and the leak rate must be less than 1 x 1078

std cc/sec.

7.2.6 Stresses

The sampler-enricher equipment must be designed for a pressure of
at least 50 psig in primary containment areas and 40 psig in secondary
containment regions. Design temperatures range from 1200°F in the pump
bowl to about 100°F at the transfer box. (The normal operating pressure
is about 5 psig.) The calculated stresses in stainless steel must not
exceed those allowed in the ASME Unfired Pressure Vessel Code, Section
vir, ¥
shown in Table 2.2 and ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Case 131
The primary containment must comply with ASME Code Case 12753 N-77° and
secondary containment with Code Case 1272 N-5.9

and those in INOR-8 must conform to the allowable stresses

7.3 Description of Equipment

7.3.1 Capsules

Two types of copper capsules are used, one for sampling and one
for adding enriched or poison material.

7.3.1.1 Sampling Capsule. As shown in Fig. 7.1, the sampling
capsule is fabricated from a 3/4-in.-OD copper rod, drilled to 5/8-in.
ID, with a rounded bottom. The solid copper top cap is also rounded

to minimize the likelihood of becoming stuck in the transfer tube or

valves. The cap is pinned to the capsule with a short length of 1/8-in,-
OD copper tubing. Two holes through the cap permit the 1/32-in,-OD
twisted Inconel wire latch cable to pass in end out to provide a T-in.-
long loop connecting the cepsule to the latchkey, to be described below.
The overall length of the capsule, with end cap, is ebout 1-13/16 in.
Holes, 180° apart, in the side of the capsule, sbout 0.88 in. sbove the
bottom, end roughly elliptical in shape, 1/k by 3/8 in., with the major
axis at right angles to the axis of the capsule, permit the salt to enter
the sampler after immersion in the salt in the bowl. The capsule volume
below the level of the holes is gbout 4 cc. A new capsule must be used
for each sample.

Te3.1.2 Enriching Capsule. This capsule is also shown in Fig. 7.1.
It is febricated of 3/L-in.-0D by 0.035~in.-wall-thickness copper tubing.
The bottom is spun shut on & radius of 3/8 in. The top is closed with a
solid copper plug similsr to thet used on the sampling capsule but with
two 1/8-in.-OD copper tubes passing longitudinally through it. The
molten enriched materiel (or poison) is added to the capsule through one
of these tubes, which extends sbout 1/k in. on the inside, end the dis-
placed inert gas is vented through the other. After filling, the 1/8-in,-
OD tubes are cut off short end sealed. A hole is drilled through the
cap at a right angle to the centerline for the 1/32-in.-0D Inconel wires
used to attach the latchkey. Nine 0.191-in.-diem holes are then drilled
in the side of the capsule 120° epart and at 1-1/k in., 2-1/2 in., and
at 3-3/4 in. from the bottom. A tenth hole, 0.221 in, in diemeter, is
drilled in the bottom. The overall length of the salt-sddition tube is
about 6-3/8 in. end it holds epproximately 30 cc, or ebout 150 g of salt
(90 & 22%). on insertion into the pump bowl the selt melts end dreins
from the capsule as’ it 1s lifted out. A new capsule is required for
each salt addition. a |

T.3.2 Cepsule Latch $53 Letchkey

A latch is provided at the end of the cable which raises and lowers
the capsule to permit easy ‘engagement and disengagement of the capsule
from the cable. This latch does not come into contact with the salt.

7.3.2.1 latchkey. The 1/32-in.-diam Inconel wire attached to ~
the top of each capsule, see above, is fitted with a brass (or bronze)
latchkey ebout 3/16 in. OD by 1-5/8 in. long, overall. The key has an
enlarged section at the upper end, 5/16 in. OD by about 3/8 in. long,
to form & shoulder on the key which engages a notch in the latch, as
shown in Fig. 7.2. The key is disengaged from the notch by grasping
the latch wire with the remote manipulator fingers and lifting it
slightly as it is pulled forward and upwards. A new latchkey is re-
quired for each sample taken.

n

T.3.2.2 latch. As shown in Fig. 7.2, the stainless steel latch »
at the end of the cable is 1-3/8 in. diam by about 2-1/2 in. long, and -

is tapered at the lower end to help guide it through the valves in the
transfer tube, etc. A slot is provided in the tapered end for in-
sertion and support of the latchkey, the shoulder on the key resting
on the edges of the slot. The upper end of the latch is beveled to
35°, When the latch is in the full raised position, this beveled
surface bears sgainst a corresponding surface on the upper latch stop
in the capsule removal chamber, causing the latch to rotate on the
cable to the desired position with the slot opening facing the access

port. The upper latch stop is described subsequently in Section
T.3.T.1 .

Te3.3 Cable

The cable used to lower and raise the capsules through the trans-
fer tube is a Teleflex, Inc. (North Wales, Pa.), Catalog No. 19553,
0.118-in.-diam by 25-ft-long 321 stainless steel cable. It is coated
with a high-temperature lubricant supplied by Teleflex, Inc. The
cable can operate under a 35-1b tension load without being damaged.

7.3.4 Pump Bowl Equipment

7.3.4.1 Capsule Guide Cage. A guide cage is provided inside the
pump bowl to confine the capsule to its proper position in the pool of

salt. As shown on ORNL drawing F-RD-9846-G, the cage is fabricated
from five 1/4-in.-diem by 8-1/4-in.-long INOR-8 rods attached to a GO
1-1/8-in.~-diem ring at the bottom. s

7.3.4.2 lower Latch Stop. A stop is provided in the connection
between the transfer tube and the capsule guide cage to prevent the <
latch from entering the cage and coming into contact with the salt.
The stop consists of a restriction tgpering from 1-5/8 in. ID at the
top to 1-1/16 in. ID at the bottom. The latch stop also serves to
support the top ends of the rods for the guide cage.

7.3.4.3 Baffle. A baffle plate surrounds the capsule guide cage
to shield it from excessive salt velocities and, more importantly, to
retard the aerosol of salt in the vapor space in the pump bowl from 1
entering the transfer tube. This baffle is a spiral-shaped INOR-8
plate, 1/8 in. thick by 8 in. high, curved to about 3 in. overall

diameter.

"

T.3.5 Transfer Tube

A 1-1/2-in. sched-LO pipe connects the top of the fuel pump bowl
to the bottom of the maintenance valve in the sampler-enricher valve
box located at the operating floor level (852-ft elev). (See Fig. 4.3.)
The pipe, or transfer tube, is about ll ft long, with two 35-1/2° by
15-in. radius bends at the top and bottom, with the central straight
portion inclined at an angle of 54°30" with the horizontal. This is
sufficient slope for the capsule to drop into the pump bowl by gravity
alone (see Fig. 7.3).

The transfer tube is fabricated of INOR-8 from the pump bowl to
the expansion joint section, described below. The expansion joint and .
the upper portions of the transfer tube are 304 stainless steel.

7.3.5.1 Expansion Joint. The transfer tube includes an expansion
joint at about the mid point to provide the flexibility needed to ab~
sorb the movement of the pump bowl (see Section 5.4.5) relative to the
fixed sampler-enricher station. The expansion joint section, or spool
piece, is about 40-1/2 in. long (see ORNL drawing D-BB-C-41337). The
upper portion of the spool piece 1s a sliding fit into the lower portion,
with a clearance of 0.003 to 0.007 in. Points of contact have ground
No. 6 Stellite surfaces. A 321 stainless steel bellows, 3.31 in. OD x

spool piece to provide a leaktight joint. The bellows was manufactured
by the Fairchild Instrument and Camera Company (El Cajon, Calif.). A
permanently attached jack, operated by a system of bevel gears and
roller chains motivated by a remotely operated tool from above, permits
compression of the expansion joint for insertion between the flanges

at the connection at each end. (See ORNL drawing D-BB-C-41365.) A po-
sitioning jig for the spool piece provides proper alignment of the
flanges during reinstallation.

The flanges for the spool piece are, as are the other flanges in
the transfer tube assembly, 4-1/4 in. OD, integral O-ring, leak-detected
units, with the mating faces held together by spring clamps which can be
remotely removed by special tooling operated through the portable shield.

Te3.5.2 Sleeve. The upper portion of the transfer tube passes
through a sleeve as it crosses the annular space between the inner and
outer reactor containment vessel walls. This 6-in. sched-4O pipe is
about 5-1/2 ft long, overall, and is provided with a bellows-type ex-
pansion joint at the mid point to compensate for relative movement be-
tween the walls of the two vessels (see ORNL drawing D-KK-D-4090TL).

Iead shielding fills the annular space between the sleeve and the trans-
fer tube for a distance of 20 in.

T+3+5.3 Upper Terminus. The upper end of the transfer tube passes
through a box set into the concrete at the operating floor level. The
box, fabricated of a 5-in. section of 1lh-in. sched-10 pipe, is closed
at the top by a 21-in.-diam by 1-1/2-in.~thick flange bolted to a cor-
responding flange on the top of the box with a double O-ring gasket,
which can be leak detected. The transfer tube is welded to, and extends
through, the flange. The 1-1/2-in. pipe terminates inside the valve box,
described below, about 7-5/8 in. above the operating floor elevation of
852 ft in a 4-1/4-in.-OD integral O-ring flange having a spring-clamp

closure.

7.3.6 Operational and Maintenance Valve Box

 

Two mechanically similar gate valves are located one above the other
in a sealed valve box at the upper end of the transfer tube assembly.

The upper--or operational--valve is used during normal operation of the

“»

in

255

sempler-enricher system. The lower--or maintenance~--vaelve is normally
open end is closed only during maintenance on the upper portion of the
sampler-enricher equipment, or in case of failure of the operational
velve to seal properly.

7.3.6.1 Valve Box. The velves are located in a box about 15 in.
x 19 in. x 38 in. high. The 15-in. by 38-in. sides face north and south,
and the 19-in. by 38-in. sides face east end west. The southern side
of the box has a cover plate bolted to the box by 1/2-in, studs on gbout
l-in, centers, and a neoprene O-ring gasket with metal-to-metel seats.
The upper portion of this cover has an opening, which, in turn, is
closed by another cover plate with a neoprene O-ring gasket and bolted
down by the same 1/2-in. studs, the studs being longer at the top of the
box to accommodate the two thicknesses of cover plates.

The valve body is welded to the transfer tube and therefore the
major portion of the weight of the valves and flanges is carried by the
flange welded to the transfer tube at the operating floor level.

The valve operating stems pass through the box cover plete in
bellows-sealed joints. These Joints segl the opening and also allow
some lateral movement of the valve for alignment. The two seals, or
Joints, are welded to the box cover plates, the lower one to the large
Plate and the upper one to the smaller, outside cover plate. Vertical
alignment of the valves and flanges is achieved by slotted holes in the
cover plates, permitting vertical shifting of each cover plate (about
1/4 in.) relative to the flanges and to each other.

Six 1-5/8-in.-diam tapped holes are provided in the 19 by 38-in.
west face of the box, each opposite en operator for the spring clamps
on the three valve flanges. The holes are normally closed stainless
steel nuts, sbout 6 in. long, which extend through the lead shielding
on the outside of the box. The nuts are provided with neoprene O-ring
gaskets. oo

The velve box is febricated of 30k steinless steel. Two stiffeners
of 1/2-1n.-thick by 3-in.-wide plate are equally spaced verticelly on
the three sides of the box. The box was designed for a pressure of
40 psig at 100°F, although the normsl operating pressure is atmospheric.
The box was hydraulically tested to 54 psig or pneumatically tested at

 
 

 

256

46 psig. It satisfactorily passed a helium leak check, with a maximum

leekage of 1 x 1078 sta cc/sec (see Section 7.2.6). Co «
7.3.6.2 Valves. The operational and maintenance valves are

1-1/2-in., 150-1b stainless steel body, "Belloseal" gate valves manu-

factured by The William Powell Company (Cincinnati). The valves are

the double-sealing type, with No. 6 Stellite-to-Stellite metal seats.

A helium pressure of 40 psig is maintained between the two seats when

the valve is closed. The normal leak rate through both seats is less

than 1 std cc of hellum per minute. The valve stems were modified by €

cutting and inserting about 6 in. of extra length so that a second

stainless steel bellows could be added to the stem seals.

The velves are operated by "Limi torque ," SMA-000, control motors
located outside the valve box. The motors are for 220-v, 3~-phase oper-
ation and have an output torque of 2 ft-lb, which is geared to produce
50 £t-1b at a stem speed of 6 in./min. ‘On closing, the torque-limiting
feature cuts off the drive when the valve is fully seated. The inter-
locks in the sempler-enricher electrical system prevent operation of
either valve motor while the cgpsule is in the transfer tube. The motors
draw power from the 25-kv motor-generator set which can be supplied with
auxiliary battery power in event of failure of the normal supply. In
addition, the valve stem drive can be shifted to manual operation for

in

emergency closing of the valves.

T.3.7 Transfer Box

”

As a sample capsule is withdrawn through the transfer tube, it
passes upward through the maintenance and operation valves in the valve
box and then into a capsule access chamber located in the transfer box.
As shown in Figs. 7.3 and T.4, this box is located just above the valve
compartment. In addition to the access chamber, in which the sample
capsule is disengaged from the lifting cable, the transfer box also
contains the cable drive box, the manipulator, and the valve port for
introducing the capsule transport container. The interior of the trans
fer box, sometimes referred to as the outer compartment, is a region of
secondary containment when the operational and meintenance valves are Oo

open. The capsule access chamber, or inner compartment (area l-c in
Fig. 7.3), is a primary containment region et this time.

T+3.7.1 Capsule Access Chamber. The 1-1/2-in.-diam upper end of
the transfer tube assembly is welded to the bottom of a bellows, which,
in turn, has the top welded to the bottom of the capsule access chamber
(see Fig. T.4t). This arrangement accommodates relative movement and
minor misalignment. The bellows is 2-ply 304 stainless steel, with
each wall 0.004 in. thick. It is 2.406 in, OD x 1.562 in, ID x 3 in.
long, has eight convolutions, and was tested at 75 psig. The manu-
facturer was Fairchild Instrument and Camera Company (El Cajon, Calif.).

The bellows described above is housed in a guide about 5 in. diam
by 5-3/4 in. long, welded to the bottom of the capsule access chamber.
The outside of the guide is provided with two neoprene O-ring gaskets
and fits into a short cylinder in the top of the valve box. When the
flanged joint above the operational valve is separated, this arrange-
ment permits the capsule access chamber and cgble drive unit to be with-
drawn for maintenance through the top of the transfer box, as will be
described subsequently.

The 304 stainless steel capsule access chamber has a square cross
section, about 4-1/2 in. on outside dimensions, is about 10-3/8-in. high,
and has walls about 1/2-in. thick. A 2-3/4-in. by 8-in.-high opening
and a door are provided on the south face. The door swings on hinges
which are spring loaded to hold the door in the open position. As shown
in Fig. 7.4, the door is closed and clamped shut by three pneumatic cylin-
ders on each side, operated by 75 psig helium, which are connected through
pinned linkages in a toggle action to lock the door shut after the gas
pressure has been released. The door is opened by applying helium
pressure to the reverse side of the piston. These same links swing the
clamps out of the way when released to allow the door to swing open.

The clamps are not attached to the door but have Stellited rounded noses
which bear against Stellite pads on the door. The clamps, each of which
can exert a force of 300 1b on the door, are Knu-Vise Clamps, Catalog
Number AODT-200, manufactured by the Lapeer Manufacturing Company
(Detroit). Two Buna-N gaskets are provided on the door opening , and the
space between the gaskets is buffered with helium when the door is closed.

A three-way valve in the helium supply to the pneumatic cylinders vents
the spent helium to the containment ventilation system.

When the capsule is hoisted to the fully raised position, the
beveled surface of the upper portion of the capsule latch contacts a
similarly beveled surface on a stop mounted in the top of the capsule
access chamber. As mentioned in Section 7.3.2.2, and shown in Fig. 7.2,
this arrangement causes the latch to rotate on the ceble so that the
notch faces the door opening.

T+3.7.2 Capsule Drive Unit and Box. The electric-motor-driven
reel vhich raises and lowers the capsule cable is located in a drive .
unit box just gbove the capsule access chamber. The interior of the
box communicetes with the chamber and is thus also part of the primary
containment,

The box is gbout 8-3/8 in, x 1%-1/8 in. x 11 in, high and is fabri-
cated of 1/2-in.-thick 304 stainless steel plate (see ORNL drawing
10301 R-157-E). The box has a 1-1/2-in.-diem hole at the bottom through
which the cable passes into the capsule access chamber. The box is
designed for, and tested at, the same pressures as the access chamber.

The transfer box has an O-ring-gasketed cover bolted in place just
ebove the drive unit box. After the flange sbove the operational valve
is separated, the lifting eyes in the top of the transfer box may be used
to pull the drive unit box and the attached capsule access chamber as-
sembly upwards through the opening for maintenance or replacement.

The capsule ceble drive unit is & Teleflex, Inc. (North Wales, Pa.),
Catalog No. 19553, drive with e storage reel holding 25 ft of cable.
The cable is positively raid out end returned by a non-slip geer~driven
wheel capable of exerting 35 1b of force on the cable in tension and
20 1b in compression. (It is to be noted, however, thet the normal
loading is but a small fraction of these values and that the capsule
drops downward to the pump bowl solely by gravity.) As the cable moves
upward through the drive wheel, it winds onto a storage reel which is
spring-loaded to maintein e tension on the cable between the reel and
the drive wheel,

The drive unit motor is a 115-v, single-phase, reversible, Jordan
(Milwaukee) "Shaftrol” unit, Model SM-11-W-3, 1/2 FLS, exerting 28 in.-1b

 
 

260

torque at 3-1/2 rpm output speed. It is provided with a built-in
electric brake. One revolution of the motor reels in about 8 in. of cable.

A threaded shaft, gear-driven from the motor, moves a nut along it
to contact limit switch arms. An upper limit, lower limit, and two inter-
mediate points are provided. The upper and lower limit switches cut off
the cable drive motor while the intermediate positions are part of the
interlock system. Two gear-driven synchro motors are incorporated into
the drive unit to send signals to the "coarse" and "fine" position indi-
cators on the operating panel. These show the capsule position to within
1/8 in. of the actual point.

T.3.7.3 Transfer Box layout and Construction. The box that houses
the capsule access chamber and the drive unit is a sealed L-shaped con-
tainer, with the vertical leg about 15 in. by 20 in. and 24 in. high,
and the horizontal leg about 15 x 15 x 36 in. long (see Fig. 7.3). It
is fabricated of 1/2-in.-thick 304 stainless steel plate. Reinforcing
bars 1/2 in.~thick by 3-in.-wide are welded along the center lines on
the 24-in.-long sides. The design pressure is 40 psig at 100°F, the
normal operating pressure being atmospheric. The box was hydraulically
tested at 54 psig or pneumatically at 46 psig. The helium leek rate
was less then 1 x 10™0 std cc/sec (see ORNL drawing 10301-R-150-E). The
box, as secondary containment, complies with the ASME Code Case 1272 N-5.

The capsule access chamber is located in the north end of the box,
in the vertical leg, with the drive unit mounted above it. The south
end of the horizontal leg is fitted with a manipulator and a quartz
viewing port. The upper portion of the horizontal leg is provided with

bo

another quartz port for the illumination system and with a valve port
for insertion and removal of the sample-capsule-transport container.
These devices are described separately in the sections that follow.
T+3+T.4 Manipulator. A shielded manipulator extends through the
wall of the transfer box. It is used to remove the capsule latchkey
from the latch and to lift the sample capsule from the access chamber
to the capsule-transport container, etc. As indicated in Fig. 7.3, the
manipulator hand has two fingers of the forceps type. These are actusted
by a push-pull rod extending through the arm to the handle, located out-
side the transfer box. A grip-type lever, which has a ratchet and pin,

~

 
h

(sn

 

261

or trigger, arrangement to lock it in any position, imparts the push-
pull motion to the rod. The hand can be rotated about 180° by turning
the arm. The insides of the fingers are padded with neoprene gbout

1/32 in, thick.

The arm passes through the box wall in a Castle-type joint. The
side-to-side motion of the arm is provided by & vertically mounted
6-in.-diem by 8-in.-high depleted uranium cylinder that is mounted on
ball bearings at the top and bottom. This cylinder turns, with a
clearance of sbout 1/64 in., in a depleted uranium housing fitted into
the 1lh-in.-diam extension of the transfer box. The up-snd-down motion
of the hand is provided by a ball-bearing-mounted horizontal axle on a
7-in.-diem by 1-1/4-in,-thick depleted uranium disk, which turns with
gbout 1/64-in. clearance in a cutout in the ebove-mentioned cylinder.
This gimbal arrangement allows full freedom of swinging motion of the
erm to any position within a cone of about 40° included angle. The ef-
fective shielding thickness of the depleted uranium is 5 to 6 in. All
uranium pieces have hard chrome plating about 0.001 in. in thickness,

The arm is sealed by a 2-ply-polyurethene, conicel-shaped, corru-
gated bellows, ebout 8 in. in diameter at the large end and tapering to
gbout 1 in. in diameter to the point where it is clamped at the "wrist"
of the erm. Each ply is gbout 0.020 in. thick. The space between the
inner and outer bellows is maintained below atmospheric pressure. Ef-
fluent gas from the space passes to the containment ventilation system,

where it is monitored for radioactivity.

A cover cen, or cap, is placed over the portion of the manipulator
handle extending outside the transfer box when the manipulstor is not in
use, or if gas leakage is detected in the assembly. This stainless steel

‘can is about 10 in. in diemeter by 12 in. long and is joined to the mani-

pulsator housing by "Conoseal” mltiple T-bolt latches (Catalog No. SOTE5H)
end uses a tube-type gasket (Catalog No. 50887-10008). This can passes
the seme leak checks as does the transfer box. The cen also can be used
to equalize the pressure on the polyurethane bellows when the transfer
box is under pressure or vacuum.

7.3.7.5 Viewing Ports and Periscope. A h-in.-diam viewing port is
located on the front of the transfer box. The 1/2-in.-thick quartz lens

 
 

262

is mounted in a pressure-tight, screwed fitting. A simple periscope,
using two front-surface mirrors about 2-1/2 by 3 in. and located about
3 ft apart in a >-in.-square stainless steel box, is arranged at a con-
venient height for an operator in the standing position. A knob at the
top has & belt drive to edjust the viewing angle of the lower mirror,
and the periscope can be rotated slightly to view the required portions
of the box interior. The viewing port and the lower section of the
periscope are inside the lead shielding which surrounds the transfer
box. A hood prevents the operator from placing his face closer than
gbout 7 in. from the upper mirror.

A second quartz lens port, identical to the one described above,
is located at the top of the transfer box in such a position that the
100-watt electric bulb placed outside the box illuminates the work area.

7.3.7.6 Capsule Removal Valve. A 2-in. ball valve is located on
the top of the transfer box for the removal snd insertion of the sample-
transport container. The seal assembly for the tube is described below.
The valve is a Jamesbury Corporation (Worchester, Mass.) type DHV-33TT,
with an air-actuated pneumatic cylinder operator No. OL Model P-100. A
h-way solenoid-operated valve controls the air flow to the cylinder end
vents the air to the atmosphere. The valve is enclosed by the lead
shielding around the transfer box.

T3.T.T Capsule Removal Tube Assembly. The capsule transport con-
tainer is inserted into the removal valve through a seal assembly de-
signed to prevent entry of air into the transfer box. The seal assembly
also prevents the escape of contaminated gases from the box as the con-
teiner is withdrawn.

The seal is contained in & vertical stainless steel tube, 2.375-in.-
OD by 11-3/16 in. long, joined with 2-in. 11-1/2 NPT to the removal valve
outlet. The upper portion is fitted with a nylon bushing 3 in. long end
with two guiding surfaces, 1.373 in. ID by 3/k in. long, at each end,
through which the 1.367-in.-0OD trensport carrier tube slides. Immedi-
ately beneath the guide bushing ere two Parker No. 220 neoprene O-ring
gaskets, 1-3/8 x 1.5/8 x1/8 in., mounted 1 in. apart. The space between

the gaskets is drilled with a 1/16-in.-diam hole end provided with 1/4-in.,

30,000-1b sutoclave tubing fittings for the introduction of helium purge.

o

263

A similer tubing connection is made beneath the O-ring seals for the
connection to vacuum pump No. 2 or the helium supply (see ORNL drawing
10301-R~-152-E).

In operation, the transport container is first inserted into the
seal until the lower end is below the two O-ring gaskets, the removal
valve being closed. Helium is then introduced between the O-rings, and
the space between the seals end the removel valve is evacuated by vacuum
pump No. 2. After helium is introduced into the space, the removal valve
mey be opened end the transport container inserted into the transfer box.
It is to be noted that the removal tool is also & leektight fit into the

capsule removal seal.

7.3.8 Capsule Transporting Equipment

After taking & sample from the pump bowl, the sample capsule is
placed in a gas-purged leaktight compartment of a transport container.
This container is then withdrawn from the transfer box up into a lead-
shielded transport cask, using a special tool. The cask is then taken
to the anslytical laboratory.

7.3.8.1 Sample Transport Container. The sample capsules are trans-
ported in a 304 stainless steel container assembly, 1.367 in. OD by
18-13/16 in. long, maintained in a vertical position for both loading
and shipping. The sample capsule rests in a compartment in the bottom,
gbout 7/8 in. ID by 6 in. long. The compartment fits inside the con-
teiner, and when the container is turned by & special tool, is joined to
it by threads at the bottom of the assembly. Double O-ring, neoprene
gaskets seal the joint. The bottom of the compartment is notched to fit
over lugs on & positioning jig in the bottom of the transfer box to keep
the compartment from turning when the container is rotated to make or
breek the thresded joint (see ORNL drawing 10301-R-050-E)..

The upper portion of the transport container is filled with an
8-1/k-in.-long plug of leed for shielding in the transport cask, and the
upper end has a vertical 1/b-in. threaded hole and transverse 5/16-1in.-
diam hole for a latching pin, as will be discussed subsequently.

7.3.8.2 Transport Container Removal Tool. The special tool used
to insert and remove the transport container and to rotate it inside the

 

 
 

 

 

264

transfer box is 1-3/8 in. in diameter by about 53 in. long. A 1/2-in.- x
diem rod extending through the handle is threaded with 1/4 in. x 20 UNC a
threads at the bottom to engage the threads at the top of the container.
A T/16-in,-wide slot on the bottom of the tool fits over a projecting lug
on top of the carrier tube to prevent relative turning. The tool 1s long
enough to extend through the transport cask, the removal valve on top of
the transfer box, and into the box for joining to the transport container
(see ORNL drawing 10301-R-050-E).

7.3.8.3 Transport Cask. The transport container, with the enclosed
semple capsule, is drawn upward from the transfer box into a shielded trans- 04

n

port cask, as shown in Fig. 7.5. The removal tool, described above, is .
then disengaged from the transport container.
The cask consists of a 25-in. length of 18-in. sched~10 austenitic .
stainless steel pipe with 3/8-in.~thick flat plates welded to the ends.
A 17-1/2-in. length of 2-in, sched-160 pipe at the center serves as the
transport container compartment. Two lugs project from the top of the
cask at each side of the central hole. Each lug has a 5/16-in.-diem hole
through which a spring-loaded latching pin operates to engage the corre-
sponding hole in the lug at the top of the carrier tube. The pin is posi-
tively locked in place to prevent sccidental removal or spills from the

cask (see ORNL drawing 10301-R-051-E). .
The cask is completely filled with about 2250 1b of lead to provide

a minimum of 8 in, of shielding in all directions. The opening at the «

top of the transport container is filled with a lead plug 8-1/4 in. long. *

The bottom of the cask is closed with an 8-in.-thick sliding lead door.
Lifting trunnions are provided on each side of the cask, which
weighs a total of gbout 2500 lb.
Three casks are available for the MSRE.

T.4 Containment

During all phases of operation, the sampler-enricher system pro-
vides a minimum of two barriers to the escape of radioactive particles
and gases. Thus, failure of any one component will not result in the :
release of dangerous amounts of contaminants, as is briefly reviewed o

below. (For a detailed description of operation of the system, see
Operating Procedures, Part VIII.)

When the sampler-enricher system is not in use, the operational
valve in the transfer tube is closed. The space between the two seating
surfaces in the valve is buffered with helium gas at a pressure greater
than that in the pump bowl. If leakage in the valve does occur, the cap-
sule access chamber at the top of the transfer tube is sealed with double
O-ring gaskets with the space between the gaskets buffered with helium
gas. If leakage should occur from this chamber, or from any of the flanged
Joints in the transfer tube connections, the escaped gases will be con-
tained in either the transfer box or the valve box. These gases are moni-
tored for radioactivity before being discharged either to the auxiliary
charcoal bed or to the containment ventilation system.

In preparing to take a sample, after the transport container with
the empty capsule has been placed in the removal valve seal assembly and
purged of air, the removal valve on the transfer box is opened. At this
point in the procedure, the operational valve and the access chamber door
remgin sealed, providing the requisite double containment barrier.

After the transport container and empty capsule are placed in the
transfer box, the removal valve is closed and buffered with helium gas.
(The transfer box may then be purged of any entering air should this be
necessary.) When the access chamber door is opened to latch the empty
capsule to the cable, the operational valve remains sealed. This valve
and the transfer box thus constitute two blocks to the escape of activity.

The access chamber door is closed and buffered with helium gas be-
fore the operational valve is opened to lower the capsule into the fuel
pump bowl. The door and the transfer box are the double barrier at this
point.

After the sample has been taken and moved to the transport container
in the transfer box, in the reverse procedure to that outlined above,
helium purge gas sweeps any fission-product gases from the transfer box
to the auxiliary charcoal bed.

At the completion of the sampling procedure, when the fuel salt is
contained in a helium atmosphere inside the sealed transport container

located in the transport cask, the cask is sealed in a gas-tight compartment

 
 

4

267

for shipment to the hot-cell facilities at the analytical laboratory.
Double containment is thus provided during the transport phase.

7.5 Shielding

Preliminary estimates indicated that after extended operation of
the MSRE at 10 Mw, one 10-g sample of the fuel salt would have a radi-
ation level of agbout 200 r/hr at a distance of 12 in. In the design of
the sampler-enricher shielding it was assumed that one such sample would
be in the apparatus and that, in addition, the deposits of the decay
daughters of the fission-product gases, particles of fuel salt, etc.,
would amount to about 200 r/hr. Figure 7.6 indicates the estimated ap-
proximate dose rate at the surface of the shielding for varying thick-
nesses of lead.

The outside of the sampler-enricher valve box, transfer box, etc.,
is shielded with a minimum thickness of 8 in. of lead, mostly in the
form of stacked lead bricks. As described in Section 7.3.7.4, the mani-
pulator is shielded with 6 in. of depleted uranium. During maintenance,
with no sample in the apparatus and the radioactivity due only to re-
sidual contemination, it is estimated that 6 in. of lead shielding is
sufficient after a lL-day decay period.

The sleeve opening through the reactor containment vessel shielding,
through which the transfer tube passes, requires special consideration.
As mentioned in Section 7.3.5.2, the annular space between the sleeve
wall and the transfer tube is filled with a 20-in. length of lead. In
addition, stacked blocks of borated polyethylene, lead bricks, etc., are
used to attenuate and absorb the beam coming through the opening.

7.6 Stresses

The stresses in the valve and transfer boxes were investigated

using standard relationships. The design pressure was LO psig at room

TT Cover-Gas and Ieak-Detection System

. Helium is used in the sampler-enricher system to purge the sealed
compartments of air or contaminated gases, to operate the pneumatic door
latches on the capsule access chamber door, and to pressurize, or buffer,
the space between the double gaskets used throughout. A drop in the |
helium supply pressure to the latter, indicating a leak, actuates the
various interlocks in the control circuits.

As shown in Fig. 7.7 (Instrument Application Diagram, ORNL drawing
D-HH-B-10505) , helium is supplied to the fuel and coolant salt sampler-
enricher equipment at 250 psig through lines 509 and 515, respectively,
from line 514 in the west tunnel ares (see Section 10). With but few ex-
ceptions, all helium lines in the sampler-enricher system are 1/ {=in,-OD
by 0.083-in.-wall-thickness stainless steel tubing with 30,000-1b auto-
clave fittings. All helium supply lines have double check valves to pre-
vent backflow,

At the fuel-salt sempler-enricher control board, line 509 divides
into lines 650 and 67k. The former has a pressure-reducing valve, PV-650,
which furnishes helium at 75 psig to 3-way solenoid valves HSV-652 and
HSV-653, each of which supplies three of the pneumatic clamps to close
and latch the capsule access chamber door. After the doors are latched,
the 3-way valves vent the spent helium to the containment ventilation
system, as will be described subsequently. The doors are unlatched and
opened by the admission of helium through HSV-651, a 3-way valve also
supplied from line 650.

Line 674, mentioned above, is provided with helium through a pressure
control valve, PV-509, which reduces the pressure to 40 psig and supplies
two headers, 664 and 683, which have branch lines to the various seals,

flanged joints, etc. Most of the branch lines contain a flow element
consisting of a short length of capillary tubing, to restrict the flow
should a buffered joint develop a significant leak. In this event, the
pressure drop in either of the two headers, 664 or 683, would be sensed
by pressure indicators and an alarm would be sounded. The branch lines
and the data on each restrictor are tabulated in Table 7.1.

Line 674 also supplies helium at 40 psig to line 672, which pro-
vides a supply of purge gas for the transfer box. The relatively large
flow is regulated through PV-672, rather than through a restrictor tube.
Two check valves in series at the exit of the line inside the box pre=-
vent backflow of possibly contaminated gas. (The line between the check
valves and PV-672 can be evacuated by vacuum pump No. 2 and the gas dis-
charged to the containment ventilation system.)

The cable drive box is supplied with helium at 40 psig from line
674, via line 657. This line is provided with a flow restrictor, as
listed in Table 7.l. The helium flows through the drive box to the cap-
sule access chamber, and is vented through line 678, as discussed below.

Line 666, branching from line 67h, is provided with a pressure-
regulator, PV-666, which reduces the pressure to 15 psig for the helium
supply between the double O-ring seals at the transport container seal.

7.8 Off-Gas System

Off-gas from the capsule access chamber and transfer box is vented
through vacuum pump No. 1 to the auxiliary charcoal bed. All other gas,
some of which may pass through vacuum pump No. 2, is vented to the con-
tginment ventilation system. All discharged gas is monitored for radio-
activity both at the sampler-enricher station and again in the MSRE gas
disposal systems. All off-gas lines leading to the charcoal beds can be

blocked with two valves in series,

7.8.1 System No. 1

The “capsule access chamber is vented through line 678, which is
provided with valves HCV-6T8 and HSV-678. Gas in the transfer box is
vented through HCV-6T77 and line 677, which. joins line 678 to connect to

the suction of vacuum pump No. 1, after passing the radistion monitor
RE-678. The vacuum pump discharges through a check valve to line 542,
which connects to line 501 leading to the auxiliary charcoal bed de-
scribed in Section 12.L.2.

The vacuum pump is a W. M. Welsch Manufacturing Company "Duo-Seal”
unit, Model 1402, having e cepacity of 140 liters/min STP end is driven
by a 1/k-hp motor. The pump is located in a vented box at the rear of
the sampler-enricher unit.

7.8.2 System No, 2

The pneumatic cylinders on the capsule access door latches exhaust
through the 3-way solenoid-operated valves HSV-651, 652, end 653, through
HSV-675 and line 675, past the radiation monitors RE-6T5A and RE-6T5B,
and joins the 9-in.-diam line 949 leading to the containment ventilation
system described in Section 13.

The box in which vacuum pump No. 1 is located 1s vented through
line 660 to the containment ventilation system, via line 68k. A branch
of line 68k draws gases from the vacuum pump No, 2 vented box. The valve
box is vented through line 659 to the vecuum pump No. 2 box. A remotely
operated valve in this line, HSV~-659, permits the line to be closed to
determine which of the compartments is the source of contamination,
should this be indicated by radiation monitors RE-675 A&B.

Air or contaminated gases in the removal tube asserbly are drawn
off through line 679 and valve HCV-679, to the inteke of vacuum pump No. 2.
This pump discharges into the vented box in which it is located, to be
vented through line 68%, mentioned sbove.

Vecuum pump No. 2 is identical to the No. 1 unit, described above.
Both pumps are > Operated only when the sampler-enricher equipment is in

use.

7.8.3 Exhaust Hood

An exhaust hood is located over the transport cask position on the
sampler~enricher to draw off any fission-product gases which might es-
cepe. This hood is connected to the containment ventilation exhaust
system, the air being drawn from the high-bay area, as described in
Section 13.

 
 

274
T.9 Electrical =

Electrical power for the sampler-enricher system is supplied from
the 25-kw dc-ac motor-generated set No. 4, via instrument power panel
No. 2. In event of failure of the dec supply normally driving the motor-
generator set, batteries can provide at least two hours of running time,
es described in Section 19.

The capsule cable drive motor is arranged for 110-v, single-phase
operation. The 220-v, 3~-phase power for the operational and maintenance

valve-control motors 1s obtained from a static converter used to change <

the single-phase power from the 25-kw motor-generator set to 3-phase, <
Mineral-insulated electrical leads are used at all points where

wires must pass through the walls of the lesktight compartments. All |

electrical disconnects are located outside the containment areas.
T.10 Coolant-Salt Sampler-Enricher System

Salt samples are taken from the coolant-salt pump bowl in es-
sentially the same manner as that used in the fuel-salt system. Samples
are removed but about once a month, however, and single, rather than
double, containment is sufficient in that long-lived radioactive material .
is not normally present in the coolant-salt pump bowl.
The same sampling capsules are used in the fuel end coolant-salt .
systems, see Section 7.3.1.2 and Fig. T.l. The transfer tube, capsule
drive mechanism, capsule latch, pump bowl internals, including the
sampling cage, are all identical to those used in the fuel-salt system.
See Sections T.3.2 through 7.3.5 and T.3.7.2.
The 1-1/2-in, NPS transfer tube extends from the coolant-salt pump
bowl upwards through the side of the penthouse to a dry box mounted in
a "packaged" coolant-salt sampling unit. The dry box is a 30-in.-long
vertical section of lk-in. sched 40 pipe. The pipe is closed at the
bottom with a pipe cap and at the top with a 150-psi hinged and clamped
flanged Tubeturn closure having elastomer O-ring seals.. This dry box
houses the capsule drive unit. The box is provided with one rubber $C
glove, the opening for which can be sealed with an 8-in, hinged flange ‘

 
[ES

¢

 

275

similar to that used on the top of the box. A 1-1/2-in, NPS connection
at the bottom leads to the two 2-in. Jamesbury ball valves (see Section
7.3.7.6) in the transfer tube, and a top connection is provided for the
1-1/2-in. ball valve for insertion and removal of the capsules. The box
is also equipped with two 3-in.-diem quartz-lens viewing and illuminating’
ports, helium and vacuum connections. See ORNL drawing 10333-R-002-E.

‘The dry box was designed for a full vacuum or for LO psig at 100°F
in accordance with the ASME Code for secondary nuclear vessels.” The
normal operating pressure is 5 psig.

A system of six different keys and sbout nine locks is used on the
valves, electrical switches, opening latches, etc., to reduce the likeli~
hood of using an improper operating sequence. This system of "key inter-
locks" operates on the principle that a key is used to unlock a device
end also to gain access to a key which can be used to unlock the next step
in the procedure. An electrical system sounds an alerm if the pressures
in the equipment are not suitable for the next step to be undertaken.

The sample capsules are inserted into the dry box from, end with-
drawn from the box into, a portable container which is used to transport
the samples to the analytical lsboratory in an inert atmosphere. This
container is a short section of 1-1/2-1in. pipe with a 1-1/2-in, Jamesbury
bell valve at the bottom and & Wilson, Teflon, sliding dynamic vacuum
seal where the 1/h-in,-diam raising and lowering rod passes through the
top cap.

In brief, the samples are taken by first evacuating the glove and
the dry box by means of the vacuum pump provided in the packaged system.
The gases are exhausted to the containment ventilation system filters
end stack. The box is then purged with helium, after which the sample
is lowered from the transport container which has been temporarily
mounted on the ball valve on top of the dry box. The flange cover on
the dry box glove is then opened, allowing the operator to insert his
hend and to attach the capsule to the latch on the capsule drive cable.
After the capsule has been lowered into the pump bowl end filled, it is
retained in the transfer tube for sbout ten minutes to allow the salt to
solidify and the activity to decay. It is then raised into the dry box
and the reverse sequence of procedures used to transfer the capsule to the
transport container. The operation is described in deteil in Part VIII.

8. COOLANT-SALT CIRCULATING SYSTEM
8.1 Layout and General Description

The coolant-salt system transports reactor heat from the fuel salt
heat exchanger to the air-cooled radiator where the energy is dissipated
to the environment by the discharge of warm air from the stack. The
¢oolant salt, or secondary , system circulates a lithium and beryllium
salt, similar in physical properties to the fuel salt but barren of fis-
sionable materials (see Table 2.1). The main components in the system
are the fuel salt heat exchanger, located in the reactor cell and de-

scribed in Section 5.5, the coolant-salt circulating pump and the radi-

ator, both located in the coolant salt cell.

The coolant-salt circulating pump is very similar to the fuel salt
pump described in Section 5.4. Both pumps use a T5-hp motor, but the
coolant salt pump operates against a higher head of 78 ft, turns at a
higher speed of 1750 rpm, and delivers only 850 gpm as compared to 1250
gom fpr the fuel pump. Other differences are that the coolant salt pump
does not have the cooling shroud for the top portion of pump bowl, spray
nozzles in the bowl for release of fission-product gases, and the over-
flow tank. The pump bowl has a centerline elevation of 833 ft 6 in.,
and as the highest point in the coolant salt system, serves as an ex-
pansion volume. It is located in what is sometimes referred to as the
penthouse area. ET
© The rediator has 120 tubes, 3/4-in. diam x 30 ft long, arranged in

2 of heat transfer surface. The coolant-

serpentine coils to provide T06 ft
salt enters at 1100°F and leaves at 1025°F at 10 Mw design conditions. The
éooddiigngir isis supplied: by two 250-hp axial blowers located in the
blower house and having a combined capacity of about 200,000 cfm. The
leaving .air, heated at design conditions to about 300°F, .is discharged

from the existing 10-ft diam x T5-ft-high steel stack at the southwest

"corner of Bldg. 7503. To guard against freezing of the coolant salt in

 

x .
MSRE literature occasionally refers to the coolant salt equipment
as the secondary system.

 
 

278

the radiator tubes on reduction of power or loss of circulation, quick- .
closing doors are provided for the radiator to close off the air flow, v
and the radistor assembly includes electric heaters inside the enclosure.

A bypass damper and duct permits regulation of the air flow over the

coil.

The 5-in. pipe from the coolant-salt pump discharge enters the re-

actor cell through a penetration on the south side and circles the cell
on the east side to the fuel heat exchanger inlet opening to the tube side.
At 10-Mw the coolant salt enters the enchanger at about 1025°F and leaves *
at about 1100°F. The exit coolant salt line circles the cell on the west .
side, leaves through a penetration on the south side at about the 836-ft
level, and then rises to the inlet header at the top of the radiator.

The coolant-salt piping has low points on each side of the radiator,
therefore two 1-1/2-in. drain lines are provided. These lead to the
coolant-salt drain tank. A 1/2-in. bypass line vents gas from the top
of the radiator when filling the system with salt. This line has no
valves, the salt bypass flow being inconsequential.

Al] parts of the coolant-salt circulating system can be maintained
above the liquidus temperature of the salt, about 850°F, by means of
electric heaters. The heaters on the coolant-salt piping inside the re-
actor cell are removable for maintenance in the same manner as pipe line
heaters on the fuel salt system, see Section 5.6.4. Heaters for the
coolant-salt system located outside the reactor cell can be approached
for direct maintenance a short time after reactor shutdown. Pipe line .
heaters are attached tubular types with standard insulation. Heaters
installed inside the cell wall penetrations can be maintained from the
coolant cell side.

The coolant-salt piping is anchored at the cell wall penetrations,
at the coolant-salt circulating pump and at the radiator. The piping
runs between these points are sufficiently flexible to absorb the thermal

expansion. This arrangement eliminates the need for the rather elaborate

“flexible support system for the pump, as is used in the fuel system, and

also permits the radiator structure to be rigidly mounted.
Auxiliary equipment for the coolant-salt circulating system includes CJ

the helium cover gas supply, the off-gas system, the bubbler liquid level

 
at

¥,

 

 

279

system, the lubricating oil system for the pump, cooling water, etc. The
coolant-salt drain tank for storing the charge of salt in the circulat-
ing system is located almost directly beneath the radiator and is described
in Section 9.

All salt-containing portions of the system are constructed of INOR-8,
see Table 2.2.

‘8.2 Flowsheet

The coolant-salt circulating system and the coolant salt drain system
are shown in Fig. 8.1 (ORNL Dwg D-AA-A-40881).

When operating at the 10-Mw reactor design power level, the coolant
salt circulating pump discharges about 850 gpm of salt at 1025°F and about
TO psig into the 5-in. sched 40 line 200. At lower power levels the tem-
perature will increase and at zero power will be 1200°F to 1225°F. Line
200 enters the reactor cell and is connected through freeze flange F-200
to the fuel heat exchanger, see Fig. 5.3 (ORNL D-AA-A-40880). Line 200.
has three heater sections and thirteen thermocouples within the coolant
cell, and twelve heater sections and seventeen thermocouples inside the
reactor cell. The penetration through the cell wall contains eight heat-
ers and seven thermocouples . The fuel system process flowsheet indicates
a future freeze flange in the reactor cell at the wall penetration. This
new flange would be required should it become necessary to replace line
200. |

The coolant-salt leaves the heat exchanger through the 5-in. sched
40 pipe, line 201, at about 1,100°F and 47 psig. After passing through
the freeze flange FF-201, and the cell wall penetration, it returns to
the coolant cell. Line 201 is provided with heaters, thermocouples, and
has provisions for a future freeze flange, in the same manner as line
200, described above. .

After passing through a venturi, FRA-201, to indicate the flow rate,
the coolant~-salt enters the top header of the radiator at a pressure of
about 36 psig. The radiator has 120 tubes, 3/4 in. OD 0.072-in. wall
thickness x 30 ft long, arranged in serpentine coils between two headers,

to provide a total of about T06 £2 of heat transfer surface. The pressure

drop of the coolant-salt in flowing through the radiator tubes is 20 psi.
There are 149 thermocouples installed, which includes one thermocouple
for each tube so that a plugged flow passage can be detected. The re-
maining thermocouples on the radiator inlet and outlet headers provide
dats for heat balances used to determine the reactor power. The radia-
tor utilizes eight heater circuits.

The radiator is cooled by a flow of 200,000 cfm of air supplied by
two 250-hp motor-driven axial blowers. The air is drawn through the
louvered sides of the blower house and delivered to the radiator coil
face at a pressure of about 10 in. of HO. Each blower has a motor-
operated axial damper which can be closed to prevent back flow. The
air is heated about 200°F in passing through the radiator coil and, after
passing through turning vanes, is discharged up the 10-ft diam x T5-ft
high steel stack. The stack has a pitot+venturi tube, FI-AD3, to measure
the air flow and to enable heat balances to be made on the heat rejection
system. The by-pass damper and the radiator doors are used to adjust the
air flow across the coil to establish the desired heat removal rate and,
thus, the power level at which the reactor operates.

The coolant-salt leaves the bottom header of the radiator at about
1025°F and 23 psig and returns to the circulating pump via line 202, a
5-in. sched 40 INOR-8 pipe. The heaters for the line are listed in Table
5.12, Section 5.6.6.

The salt enters the bottom of the pump bowl where any entrained gases
are drawn off. A 5-psig over-pressure of helium is maintained above the
salt level in the bowl, the helium being introduced through line 512 and
the liquid Level bubbler lines. About 15 gpm of the 850 gpm discharge
rate of the pump returns to the pump bowl by escaping through the clear-
ances between the impeller and the casing, the so-called "fountain flow"
described in Section 5.4.1.2. The pump operates against a head of 78 ft
and the discharge pressure is TO psig. The pump discharges into line
200, described previously as leading to the heat exchanger inside the
reactor cell.

The 1-1/2-in. sched 40 fill and drain, line 204, is connected to
the low point of elevation in line 201. A similar drain, line 206, is

provided for the low point in the radiator at the lower header. Both

 
 

282

of these lines have freeze valves, FV-204 and FV-206, and connect to the wv
coolant-salt drain tank through line 204. This line is provided with a
reservoir, consisting of a 5-in. length of 4-in. sched 40 pipe with pipe
caps welded on each end, which insures that a sufficient quantity of salt
will remain behind after a drain to completely fill the freeze valves so
that a seal can be effected. (See ORNL Dwg E-GG-C-40603). Each of the
drain lines, 204 and 206, has one heater circuit and seven thermocouples
on the circulating system side of the freeze valve.

The coolant-salt drain tank is located beneath the radiator and has

3

sufficient capacity to store the Ui ft~ of salt contained in the circu-
lating system. The drain tank is described in Section 9, following.

Line 205 is a 1/2-in. sched 40 pipe which connects the high point
of the inlet line to the radiator, line 201, with the outlet, line 202,
to vent the gas from line 201 when filling the system with salt. An in-
significant amount of salt is by-passed through line 205. The pipe has
one heater circuit and two thermocouples.

Thirteen auxiliary pipes connect to various parts of the coolant-
salt circulating pump. Lines 594, 595 and 598 are 1/L4-in. OD stainless
steel tubes carrying helium for the bubblers and the reference pressure
for determining the salt liquid level in the pump bowl. The normal
helium flow rate in line 59% is 0.15 liters/min, and in lines 595 and
598 is 0.37 liters/min. The solenoid valves in these lines are in the
coolant cell and the hand control valves and flow indicators are in the
special equipment room.

Line 512 is a 1/h-in. OD stainless steel tube supplying 0.6 liters/
min of helium purge gas to the pump shaft annulus just below the lower
shaft seal, to provide an inert cover gas, to provide off-gas to the
radiation monitor, and to reduce the migration of oil vapor to the coolant
salt in the bowl.

Off-gas is vented from the pump bowl at an estimated rate of 1.4
liters/min through the 1/2-in. line 528. The gases are at a pressure of
about 5 psig and flow through a filter and a pressure-regulating valve,
PCV-528. By controlling the rate of venting the gases, this valve es-
tablishes the operating pressure in the coolant-salt system. Line 528 o

continues to the vent house where, after passing the radiation monitor

"

283

RIA-528, it joins line 927, via lines 565, 557 and 560, to be vented
through the filters and the off-gas stack.

The small oil leakage through the lower shaft seal on the pump is
swept away by 0.07 liters/min of helium that flows upwards through the
labyrinth seal and out through line 526. The 1/2-in. pipe leads to an

- 0il catch tank in the coolant-salt drain cell where the separated oil

drains into a 595-gal stainless steel drum. The helium vent pipe con-
tinues as line 526 through a hand valve, V-526, a filter, and a 30%
stainless steel capillary restrictor which limits the flow to about 70
ce/min. The vented gas joins the above-mentioned line 528 for discharge
through the filters and the off-gas stack.

The coolant-salt is sampled through line 998, which is a 1-1/2-in.
sched 40 pipe rising vertically from the pump bowl and into the high bay
area. Salt is dipped from the bowl and withdrawn through a ball valve,
HCV-998, in the same manner as described for the fuel pump in Section 7,
with the exception that the lower activity level allows the coolant-salt

“system to be somewhat less complicated.

Iubricating oil is supplied to the pump bearings through the 3/4-in.
line 753 at a rate of about 8 gpm through the 3/h-in. line 754%. The oil
leaves the shield block through line 757, in which the oil temperature is
monitored, and passes through an eductor to induce a flow of oil from
the bearings through line 755. The combined oil flow leaves the cell
through the l-in. line 756, end returns to the coolant-salt lubricating
oil system. Co

Line 591 is a 1/2-in. pipe connecting the top of the lubricating
oil supply tank with the topmost passages of the bearing housing to
equalize the pressure between the two points. The lubricating oil system
for the coolant-salt pump 1s essentially the same as for the fuel pump,
as described in Section 5.4.1.k.

The coolent-salt pump is driven by & 75-hp, 1,750 rpm, 4ho-v, three-
phase electric motor. The motor is installed in a steel housing that
will contain oil and radioactive gases if either or both were to leak
through the upper seal in the bearing housing. The motor is cooled by
5 gpm of treated water supplied through line 832 and leaving through
line 833. A microphone, XdbE, permits monitoring of the pump noise

 
 

 

284

level. The motor speed, SIA CP-G, electrical input, EiIl, EvE, Ew-I, and
temperatures are also monitored.

The radiator is cooled by a 200,000-c fm flow of air supplied by two
250~-hp motor-driven axial blowers. Bach blower has motor-operated damp-

ers which close to prevent back flow. The air is drawn through the lou-

vered openings in the blower house walls and delivered to the coil face at

a pressure of sbout 9.9 in. HO. The air is warmed about 200°F by the
heat rejected from the cooling salt, and after leaving the coil passes
through turning vanes and flows upwards through the 10-ft-diam x 75-ft-
high steel discharge stack. The stack is provided with pitot-venturi
tubes which can traverse the stack for flow measurements to establish
heat balances for the heat rejection system, FI-AD (See Part II).

The by-pass damper and the radiator inlet and outlet doors are used
to adjust the air flow across the radiator coil face to fix the heat re-
movel rate from the coolant salt and, consequentially, the power level

at which the reactor operates.

Two 10-hp axial blowers located in the blower house discharge 10,000

cfm each of air into the annular space between the radiator air duct and
the building walls to prevent damage to the building structure and ra-
diator duct. This is particularly necessary when the reactor is oper-

ating at zero or very low power levels and the main blowers are off.

8.3 Coolant-Salt Circulating Pump

The coolant-salt circulating pump is identical in most respects
to the fuel salt circulating pump. The two pumps were fabricated to .es-
sentially the same drawings and specifications with the various parts
and subassemblies supplied by the same manufacturers. (See Section 5.4)
Development of the coolant pump, final assembly and testing proceeded
at ORNL almost concurrently with work on the fuel pump.

The pump bowl is the highest point of elevation in the coolant-salt
circulating system and, similarly to the fuel circulating system, serves
as a surge volume, as the point for pressurizing the system with the
helium cover gas, and as a means of separating and venting of gases en-
trained in the salt stream.

The fuel and coolant-salt pumps are both centrifugal sump types,
driven by direct-connected motors, and differ mainly in their hydrau-
lic characteristics through having different operating speeds and im-
peller diameters. ‘Because of the lower level of radioactivity in the
coolant-salt, the coolant pump has no provisions for cooling of the
upper portion of the bowl, and does not include the "stripper" flow in
the bowl for removal of fission-product gases. Unlike the fuel pump in
the reactor cell, the coolant pump can be approached for direct main-
tenance a short time after reactor shutdown, a feature which simplified
flange bolting arrangements, electrical disconnects, pump bowl heater

design, thermal insulation, etc.

8.3.1 Description

Fig. 2.3 serves as a general illustration of both the fuel and
coolant salt pumps. (See ORNL coolant pump assembly Dwg F-2-02-054-
10062-B¥). The general location of the pump in the coolant cell is
shown in Figs. 4.4 and 4.5. Cn

The coolant pump has a design capacity of 850 gpm at a head of 78
ft when driven at 1750 rpm by a T5-hp motor. Other design date are
given in Table 8.1

 

*ORNL drawings for the MSRE pumps have a different numbering system
than that used for all other MSRE drawings.

All parts of the pump in contact with the coolant salt are fabri-
cated of INOR-8. The pressure-containing portions were designed for
T5 psig and 1300°F and in accordance with Section VIII of the ASME Un-
fired Pressure Vessel Code, *T Code Interpretation Cases 127080 and
12738. 7° The thermal stresses were eveluated on the same basis as for
the fuel-salt pump, see Section 5.4.4 and Ref. 88.

The coolant-salt pump is arranged in three principal assemblies:
the rotary element, the pump bowl, and the drive motor.

The rotary element assembly includes the rotating shaft and impeller,
the bearing housing and bearings, and the impeller cover plate and upper
labyrinth subassembly. The bearings, seals, and lubrication and helium
gas passages, are all of the same type and arrangement &s in the fuel
pump. (See Section 5.4.1.1). The impeller diameter is 10.33 in. and
is provided with the same type of impeller shroud as the fuel pump.
Pump speed and noise pickups are essentially the same as in the fuel
systen.

The lubricating oil system for the pump is identical to that used
for the fuel pump, although the heat rejected in the oil cooler is much
less. See Table 5.6 and the lubrication system flowsheet, Fig. 5.25
(ORNL Dwg D-AA-A-40885). The same oil is used as a lubricant in both
systems, see Table 5.7. The lubricating oil systems are separate from
each other, although located adjacent to each other in the east tunnel
area, with the exception that in an emergency Lines 762, 712 and the
breather interconnection, Line 601, allow either lubricating oil system
to supply both pumps.

The pump bowl, pump volute and discharge thimble in the bowl are
almost identical to the fuel pump components. The thimble has a 4-in.
length of 1/4-1n. OD tubing welded to the top to vent gas from the pump

Co discharge as the system is being filled with salt. A small flow of salt

will return to the bowl through this by-pass during normal operation.
The "fountain flow" of about 15 gpm, which escapes from the clearances
between the impeller and the pump casing, etc., is about the same in
both pumps. The coolant pump does not have the spray nozzles above
the salt level in the pump bowl for the stripping of gases from the

 
 

 

 

 

288

pumped salt, as is required for release of fission-product gases in the
fuel-salt system. (See Section 5.4.1.2)

A 1-1/2-in. vertical nozzle is provided at the top of the pump bowl
for the taking of salt samples and for adding enriched material. The
sampler-enricher system is a simplified version of the fuel sampler-
enricher system.

The salt level in the pump bowl is sensed by helium gas bubbler
tubes in the same manner as in the fuel pump, and as described in Section
10.9.1. The short tube, line 598, extends 1-5/8 in. below the center-
line of the pump volute, or roughly 4-3/8 in. below the normal operating
level in the bowl. The long tube extends 4-1/16 in. below the center-
line of the volute and is supplied with helium through line 595. The
reference pressure is transmitted by line 594 through a connection at
the top of the bowl. In addition, a float-type level instrument is
used. This instrument is a special differentisl-transformer type de-
veloped at ORNL, see Part II. The electrical signal is transmitted to
both the data logger and, after conversion to a pneumatic signal, is
recorded on the same instrument as the level indication from the bubbler
tubes.

Helium cover gas is supplied through line 512 and FCV-512 to the
pump shaft annulus just below the lower shaft seal. Off-gas is with-
drawn from the top of the pump bowl through line 528. Line 526 with-
draws the oil-helium mixture leaking through the seals to prevent the
migration of oil vapor to the coolant salt, in the same manner as in
the fuel salt pump.

The pump bowl was fabricated with a 1-1/2-in. overflow line nozzle
but the connection is capped and not used. Protection from overfilling is
provided through use of liquid level instrumentation.

The coolant pump bowl does not have a shroud and a flow of cooling
air around the upper portion. The level of activity in the cover gas
is so low that cooling is not required.

The pump drive motor is a 75-hp, Westinghouse, direct-connected
type identical to that used on the fuel-salt pump except that the normal
synchronous operating speed is 1750 rpm. Operation at different speeds

can be obtained by varying the frequency of the electric power supply
through use of a motor-generator set which can be brought to the MSRE
site. The pump motor is cooled by treated water flowing through stain-
less steel coils heliarc welded to the motor can. The motor data are

listed in Table 8.1. (Also, see Section 5.4.1.3)
8.3.2 Hydraulics

The hydraulic performance of the coolant-salt pump was determined
on a water test rig for impeller diameters of 11.6, 10.82 and 9.9 in M9
Although the required design capacity of 850 gpm at 78 ft of head could
be achieved with an impeller diameter of 9.9 in., a diameter of 10.33 in.
was specified in order to provide a margin for error of about 10% in the
system resistance calculations and for a 5% variation in flow between
the water test pump and the MSRE operational unit. As shown in the
characteristic curves in Fig. 8.2, the coolant-salt pump has a capacity
of 850 to 940 gpm under heads about 10% higher than the design value of

78 1.730
8.3.3 Stresses

The operating stresses in the coolant-salt pump are no less severe
than in the fuel-salt pump, and in some cases, required even closer at-

tention. See Sections 5.4.3 and 5.4.4 and Ref. 88.

8.3.4 Pump Supports

The coolant-salt pump is mounted in a fixed position in the coolant
cell. The coolant-salt piping has sufficient flexibility to absorb the
thermal expansion with the pump and radiator acting as anchor points.
The flexibility of the piping system is discussed in Section 8.6.1.

The pump is bolted to a 2-in.-thick support plate (See ORNL Dwg.
D-CC-D-41516), which in turn is bolted at each end with eight 5/8-in.
bolts to a 5-in. square box header beam 18 in. long. These two box
beams are welded to a 5-in. I-beam structure which is fastened with
through bolts to the concrete wall of the coolant cell. Isomode vi-
bration absorber pads are used under the wall mounting plates. (See
ORNL Dwg. E-CC-D-41515)

8.3.5 Heaters

The coolant-salt pump bowl has 11.2 kw of electrical heat applied
in the form of fourteen 6-in. x 8-in. x 5/8-in.-thick flat-plate ceramic
heater units of 800 w at 230 v capacity each. (See ORNL Dwg E-MM-B-40837).
Six of the heaters are equally spaced at the bottom of the pump bowl and
eight are arranged vertically around the sides, with the surface of the
heater plate averaging about 1/2 in. from the outside surface of the bowl.
The heaters are connected in parallel and mounted in brackets in a 304
stainless steel heater basket. This basket is hung by four hooks from
the pump support structure so that the heaters and basket do not touch
the pump bowl. The heater leads use fish-spine ceramic insulating beads
0.260-in. OD x 0.124-in. ID x 0.260 in. long.

The electric power supply is through heater control panel HCP-4 and
is adjusted by a Type 1256 Powerstat from O to 240 v. (See Section
19.7.4)

8.3.6 Thermal Insulation

The outside of the heater basket is insulated with 4. in. of Carey-
temp high-temperature insulation applied in a conventional manner.
(See ORNL Dwg E-MM-B-40837).

8.4 Radiator

One of the chief considerations in design of the MSRE radiator was
that it be protected from freezing of the coolant-salt in the tubes in
131, 132 other important de-
sign factors were that the radiator was to be used in conjunction with
air-handling equipment already installed in Bldg 7503 as part of the
ART program, that the heat dissipation rate be adjustable from zero to
10-Mv, end that the unit must be capable of operating for long periods
of time without direct approach for inspection or meintenance.l?t The
salt should move downward through the radiator as it is cooled. In
general, the above considerations were of greater importance than de-

signing for high performance characteristics.

 
 

 

 

292

8.4.1 Description

A drawing of the radiator and enclosure is shown in Fig. 2.5. (Also,
see ORNL Assembly Dwgs E-DD-A-40431 and E-DD-D-4O4T70). The radiator de-

sign dats are summarized in Table 8.2

8.4 1%811C0oil. - The radiator coil has 120 INOR-8 tubes, 3/4 in.
OD, with 0.072-in. wall thickness, and each about 30 ft long.* The
tubes are arranged in an S-shaped configuration, 12 tubes high and 10
tubes deep in the direction of air flow, as shown in Figs. 8.3 and 8.L4.
The tubes are spaced 1-1/2 in. on centers, and the rows are 1-1/2 in.
apart, with the tubes staggered, as shown in Fig. 8.4. This arrange-

2 of effective heat transfer surface.

ment provides about 706 ft
Each vertical row of tubes terminates in a manifold. The ten mani-
folds at each end of the coil join horizontal 9-in. OD inlet and outlet
headers, to which the 5-in. coolant salt circulating lines are welded.
The manifolds are 2-7/16-in. ID and fabricated of 1/k-in. INOR-8
plate. (See ORNL Dwg E-DD-A-4OT4L). The plate was first formed into
8 U-shape and then cold-drawn with a die to form the nozzles for weld-
ing the 3/4-in. OD tubing to the manifold. The plate was then formed
into a circular cross section and the longitudinal seam weld and pipe
cap were added to complete the assembly. The headers were constructed
in essentially the same manner except that the plate thickness was
1/2 in.
The outlet header is bolted to the fixed radiator structure and is
an anchor point in the coolant-salt piping system. The inlet header
is supported with slotted bolt holes that allow movement of the header
due to thermal expansion. (See ORNL Dwg D-DD-A-40438).
The tubes are supported about every 4 ft by 3/4-in.-wide stainless
steel strap hangers, as indicated in Fig. 8.5. The tubing is suffi-
ciently free within the hangers to allow longitudinal movement. Align-

ment pins passing through the straps maintain the row-to-row spacing.

*Extended surface tubing usually associated with air-cooled coils is

not used in the MSRE radiator because less rapid heat transfer is de-

sirable on sudden loss of reactor power to prevent freezing of the cool-

ant salt in the tubes.

Each of the radiator tubes is provided with a thermocouple to pro-
vide warning of restricted coolant-salt flow in any of the passages. A
total of 149 couples are installed in the radiator, 120 on the tubes and
the remainder on the inlet and outlet headers and tube supports. (See
ORNL Dwg D-AA-B-40511). The insulation used for the thermocouples on

‘the tubes is Fiberfrax- Ceramic Fiber, Grade 970-F, manufactured for

the Carborundum Company (Niagera Falls, New York) by the Harlbut Paper
Company. Although tests indicated that the small amounts of sulphur,
aluminum and lead in the insulation caused no significant attack on
INOR-8 at elevated temperatures, 53 the insulation having been baked at

1600°F for four hours to remove volatiles prior to instellation.

8.4.1.2 Enclosure and Insulation. - The radiator enclosure sup-

 

ports the coil and provides a heated and an insulated jacket around it
during the periods when it is desirable to maintain the heat within the
coil. The coil supports in the high-temperature regions consist of an
inner 304 stainless steel frame made of 1/4-in.-thick built-up and formed
structural shapes. This is covered with 16~-gage stainless steel sheets.
The stainless steel frame is bolted to a carbon steel exterior structure,
composed chiefly of 6-in., 12.5-1b I-beams anchored to the coolant cell
structural steel framework. Slotted bolt holes allow for differential
thermal expansion. Johns-Manville 1/2-in.-thick Marimite~-23 insulation
board is used between the stainless and carbon steel sections at points
of contact to reduce the heat transfer to the latter. (See ORNL Dwg
E-DD-D-hO472) ., The remainder of the carbon steel framework is protected
from high temperature by Eagle-Picher Supper -Temp block insulation up to
6 in. thick. (See ORNL Dwgs E-DD-D-LOLT0 and LOKTL). The portions of
this insulation with surfaces which would have been swept by the air
stream have protective covers of 16-gage 304 stainless steel. (See
ORNL E-DD-D-LO4T0)

Flow of air, estimated to be about 30,000 cfm at the 10-Mw design
power condition, by-passes beneath the coil to cool the radiator support

structure. The radiator doors do not cover these by-pass openings.

8.4.1.3 Doors and Door Mechanism. - The upstream and downstream

faces of the radiator enclosure are equipped with insulated doors that

 
 

 

298

can move downward in vertical tracks to provide a fairly air-tight seal
to completely contain the radiator coil in an insulated and electrically-
heated enclosure during the periods when it is required to conserve the
heat in the coolant salt system. The doors are 8 ft high x 11 ft wide,
and each weighs about 1,770 lbs. (See ORNL Dwg D-DD-B-40LLO)

Each door moves on cam rollers in a U-shaped track, and as it reaches
a nearly-closed position, raised areas on the tracks force the door toward
the radiator enclosure, compressing a braided Inconel-wire, asbestos-
packed gasket, mounted on the door periphery, against a sheet-metal spring
seal mounted on the radiator enclosure. (See ORNL Dwgs D-DD-B-LOLLS,
40446, LOUKT and LOLLY) |

The door frame is made of 4-in. x 0.120-in.-thick square carbon
steel tubing, reinforced internally with vertical carbon steel T-sections
and angle-cross braces. (See ORNL Dwgs D-DD-B-4O4L1, LOL42 and LOUL3)

Door insulation is L-in. thick Careytemp block covered with over-
lapping sheets of 1/16~in.-thick stainless steel on the side facing the
radiator coil. The exterior is covered with 1l0-gage carbon steel plate.
(See ORNL Dwg D-DD-B-4OLlk)

The doors are raised and lowered at a rate of 10 ft/min by a 3-hp,*
3,150 ft-lb, 5-rpm output, U. S. Electric Motors, Inc., Model 254U-50,
gear motor mounted above the radiator enclosure, as shown in Fig. 2.5.
The motor is comnected to the drive shafts for the individual doors by
a chain drive. (See ORNL Dwgs D-DD-C-LO450, LO451, L4O452 and LOL68)

Each door is equipped with a Fawick Corporation Model SC-11%50
stationary field type magnetic clutch and a Stearns Electric Company
Style EB Size 1004, 48-volt DC, magnetic brake, which permit the doors
to be positioned independently of each other. Clutch and brake torques
are 2,700 ft-lbs and 800 ft-lbs, respectively.

Each door is suspended from its drive shaft by means of four 3/8-in.
diam stainless steel wire ropes attached to two 8-in.-diam sheaves.

(See ORNL Dwg D-DD-C-40454) The wire ropes have a breaking strength of

AS

¥The theoretical horsepower required to raise the door is only
slightly more than 1 hp, but the motor was oversized to provide the
"break away" torque needed to overcome the friction in the door gasket
seal.

299

12,000 1bs. The four ropes are connected in pairs through two shock-
absorbing springs mounted on the top edge of each door. A 2,310-1b fly-
wheel, 39-1/2-in. diam x 6-1/2-in. wide, made of laminated steel plates,
is attached to one end of each of the door drive shafts through a Form-
sprag Model FS-T00/2.75 over-running clutch. (See ORNL Dwg E-DD-C-40469)
The inertia of the flywheels limit the speed at which the doors would
fall in case of a.loss of electrical power, or of a reactor scram. The
time required for a door to close is estimated to be about 3 seconds and
the final velocity of the door about 6 ft/sec. (See Ref 15, Section VII,
p 69)

8.4.1.4 Cooling Air Blowers, Ducting and Dampers. - Air is supplied
to the radiator by two 250-hp Joy Manufacturing Company "Axivane" blowers,
Model AR600-36D-1225, Unit X-T709-29 driven at 1750 rpm by 250-hp General
Electric "Triclad", direct-connected, induction motors, Model 2M6335-JY-1
Type M Frame 6335Z, 3-phase, 60-cycle, 44O-volts. Each blower is rated
at 82,500 cfm at 15 in. HQ or 114,000 cfm with free air delivery. The
normal discharge pressure at the reactor design power level of 1O-Mw is
9 in. of H,0, providing a combined capacity from the two blowers of about
200,000 cfm. The characteristic performance curve is shown in Fig. 8.9,
and discussed in Section 8.4.3. Each blower is provided with a four-
bladed, motor-operated shut-off damper on the discharge which can be
closed to prevent backflow through the fans. The blowers discharge into
a 10 x 12-ft air duct leading to the plenum at the face of the radiator
coil. | |

A by-pass duct beneath the radiator contains a vertical-louvered
damper which can be adjusted to control the flow through the by-pass and,
therefore, the air passing over the radiator coil. The entrance section
to the by-pass duct is 2 x 10 £t and sbout 5 ft long, and leaves the main
duct at an angle of about 60° with the horizontal. The center section
contains the by-pass damper and is 3 x 7 ft in cross sectional area. The
exit section is identical to the entrance section. :

Air leaving the radiator or the by-pass duct passes through turning
vanes to direct it up the 10-ft-diam x 75-ft-high free-standing steel
stack. A pitot-venturi tube is located near the top of the stack to

measure the air flow rate.

 
 

 

300

The air ducts are fabricated of stainless steel sheet. These ducts
are contained within another duct to form an annulus through which cool-
ing air is passed to cool the inside ducting to prevent excessive warping
and buckling. The annulus air also protects any nearby concrete from
overheating at low reactor power levels when the exit air from the radi-
ator coil may be as hot as 1,000°F. Air for the annulus is supplied by
two 10-hp, 1750-rpm, Joy Manufacturing Company Series 1000 “"Axivane" fans,
Model 29-1/4-21-1750, having a capacity of 10,000 cfm each at 2 in. H,0
static discharge pressure, as indicated in the performance curves shown
in Fig. 8.6. After cooling the annulus the air joins the air from the

radiator for discharge up the stack.
8.4.2 stress

The radiator tubes were designed for a maximum internal pressure
of 350 psig at 1250°F. The maximum combined thermal and mechanical
stress, which includes the effect of wind pressure, was found to occur
at the outside circumference of the tube and calculated to be 5,224 psi.
(See Ref 15 Section VII p 46). As indicated in Table 2.2, the maximum
allowable stress in INOR-8 at 1100°F is 13,000 psi and at 1200°F is
6,000 psi. Stresses in the headers, tubes and piping due to the internal
operating pressure of 75 psig was investigated and found to be only about
785 psi. (See Ref 1k Section VII p 47) The radiator was hydrostatically
tested at 800 psi and pnepmatically et 670 psi. 13H

Design studies were made of the stresses in tubing supports, headers,
doors, and other members and found to be well within allowable limits. (See
Ref 15 Section VII pp 48-59 and pp 60-69) Shock loads on the structure
when the radiator doors are dropped was calculated to be about 1,980 lbs.
The wind load on the closed upstream door produces a meximum stress of
8,550 psi in the carbon steel T-sections when the pressure difference

across the door is 15 in. HO.
8.4.3 Performance

At 10-Mw reactor power level the coolant salt enters the radiator
at 1100°F; at zero power the entering temperature is 1200°F - 1225°F.
The coolant--salt temperature leaving the radiator is about 1025° F at 10-Mw
and is 1200°F to 1225° F at zero power.

At the maximum load conditions the effective log mean temperature
difference is 862°F, the salt film coefficient is about 3,420 Btu/hr-

£2 OF, the air film coefficient is about 61 Btu/hr-£t°-CF, and the over-

all heat transfer coefficient is about 58 Btu/hr-£t--CF. (See Ref 15
part VII pp 8-25) The effective heat transfer surface of 706 £2 thus
provides a calculated capacity of 10.4 Mw.

Inasmuch as the air film resistance is about 95% of the total re-
sistance to heat transfer, the overall coefficient is strongly influenced
by the air velocity over the tubes. At partial loadings of the reactor,
the air flow will be regulated by the by-pass damper, by changing the
radiator door position, and by on-off control of the blowers. The pres-
sure drop due to the flow of air through the radiator coils is a function
of the flow rate and this, in turn, effects the static pressure at the
blower outlets and the blower capacity. The interplay of these several
variables on the air temperature leaving the radiator under various load-

135

ing conditions is summarized in Fig. 8.7, assuming stepless control
of the air flow over the coil. If the cooling air enters the coil at
100°F, at the 10 Mw design power condition, the leaving air temperature

is about 300°F. At lower power levels the exit air temperature is higher,

being about 450°F at 4 Mw. Below this power level the exit air temperature

increases sharply, and is estimated to be about 800°F at 1 Mw and 1000° to
1100°F at power levels below 0.5 Mw when the air flow rates are relatively
small.

There are many possible combinations of mode of blower operation
and radiator door and by-pass damper positions which will hold the reactor
power at a given level. One set of combinations is summarized in Table
8.3.136 The effect of the various step-wise adjustments on the air flow
was estimated, as illustrated in Fig. 8.8.132 There is some disparity
between values in these two studies but this is not of concern because
experimentation with the actual system is necessary to establish the best
procedures. Preliminary testing of the blowers, radiator doors and by-
pass dampers has indicated that the static pressure losses in the system

may be substantially less than the estimates used in the studies, de-

monstrating further that the best combinations for stable operation,

particularly at reactor power levels below 1 Mw, will have to be de~
termined in the field.

Studies were also made of the operating sequences for rapidly
changing the reactor power from low to high levels while maintaining the
stability of the system and the required condition of constant fuel salt
temperature leaving the reactor.¥* In these studies the system was sim-
ulated by an analog computer. 137

Ioad changes are made manually using a single, spring-return type
load demand switch to increase or decrease the power. The switch actuates
the programmed control for the radiator doors, blowers and by-pass damper,
essentially as outlined in Table 8.3. In increasing the reactor loading
from, say, 1 Mw to 10 Mw, the initial condition will be with the radiator
doors about 35% open and the by-pass damper fully open and one blower
in operation. Manipulation of the load demand switch first causes the
radiator doors to be opened to their limit. A further increase in load
is obtained by closing the by-pass demper. A still greater load demand
starts the second blower and at the same time opens the by-pass damper
again. These procedures will be reviewed during the preliminary testing
of the reactor system.

The characteristics of the axial blowers supplying the cooling air
are as indicated in Fig. 8.9. Parallel operation of the two blowers
under certain loading conditions can lead to unstable conditions with
possible surging of the load distribution between the two blower driving
motors. As indicated in Fig. 8.9 this is most likely to occur at about
100,000 cfm air delivery and would tend to be avoided by using one blower
at 100% of capacity rather than two at reduced capacity. General operat-
ing characteristics must be determined from the actual system.

Anslog computer studies were made to determine the freezing time
for stagnant salt in the center of a radiator tube. Under design con-
ditions, with the maximum air flow, the estimated time was sbout 50

138

seconds .

 

*In the "starting mode" of operation at reactor power levels below
1 Mw, the nuclear power is held constant. In the "run mode", at power
levels above 1 Mw, the fuel-salt temperature leaving the reactor is held
constant.

8.4.4 Heaters

About 223 kw of electric heater capacity is provided inside the
radiator enclosure. These heaters are used to preheat the system before
the coolant -salt is added and to maintain the temperature above 850°F at
all times that the salt is in the system.

Tubular-type heaters are mounted 3-1/2 in. apart on the vertical up-
stream and downstream faces of the coil. These "Calrod" units are tri-
angular in cross section, about 0.35 in. on a face, and are in straight
lengths. There are twenty-four 48-in. lengths, with a capacity of
1,350 w each; twelve 82-in. lengths of 2,500 w capacity each; twelve
0-in. pieces having a capacity of 2,750 w each; and twelve pieces 102
in. long with 3,150 w capacity in each length; making a total of 133,200 w

capacity in tubular heaters. The heaters are supported in vertical rows

of six each in 304 stainless steel clamps. The heaters use 230 v, 3-phase
delta-connected electric power supplied through induction regulators CR1,
CR4, CR5 and CR6 (See ORNL Dwg E-MM-B-40802 and Section 19.7 of this
report).

Flat ceramic-type heaters are used in the horizontal positions on
the baffle plates above and below the tube bundle. The 60 heaters are
identical 7-1/2-in. x 18-in. flat plates with a capacity of 1,000 w each.
The 208-v power is supplied through induction regulators CR2 and CR3.

The inlet header is in an insulated enclosure provided with fifteen
h-in. x 12-in. flat ceramic heater plates of 1,000 w capacity each. These
are served by induction regulator CR7 and are rated at 230 volts. (See
ORNL Dwg E-MM-B-40808)

The outlet header enclosure is equipped with twenty-seven L4-in. x
12-in. plates of 550 w capacity each at 230 volts. Induction regulator
CR8 supplies these heaters. (See ORNL Dwg E-MM-B-40809) All the ceramic-
type heaters are mounted in 20-gage 304 stainless steel cans held in place
by 16-gage clips. The ceramic heaters total 90 kw of capacity.

The nichrome heater wire leads are heliarc welded to extension leads
of No. 12 alloy 99 soft temper nickel wire covered with 0.330-in. OD x
0.124-in. ID x 0.330-in.-long ceramic fish-spine beads.

8.5 Cell Wall Penetrations for Lines 200 and 201

The coolant-salt lines 200 and 201 pass through the reactor cell
wall through special penetration assemblies which contain electric heat-
ers, thermal insulation, radiation shielding for the annulus between the
process pipe and the penetration sleeve, and a rigid support to serve as
an anchor point for the piping.

The penetrations for each pipe are essentially identical. The fol-

lowing description of a penetration would apply to either.
8.5.1 Reactor Cell Sleeve

The 5~in. coolant-salt pipe passes through an anchor sleeve which is
mounted inside a reactor cell sleeve joining the reactor cell vessel and
the outer shell, or tank. (The space between the vessel and the shell is
filled with a magnetite sand-water mixture, as described in Section 4.3.1.)

A 24-in. sched 80 carbon steel pipe, averaging about 16 in. long, is
welded to the k-in.-thick portion of the reactor cell vessel at the lo-
cation shown in Table 4.1. A 32-in. OD x 0.625-in. wall thickness pipe,
averaging about 25 in. long, is welded to the outside 3/8-in.-thick tank
wall, which also has 3/8-in.-thick stiffeners at this point. An ex-
pansion joint, about 30 in. OD x 26 in. long, (Badger Manufacturing
Company Model 24-6WT Series 50) connects the 24-in, and 32-in. pipes to
make a leak-tight joint and accommodates 3/8 in. lateral movement and
1/4 in. axial movement between the inner and outer vessels. (See ORNL
Dwg D-KK-D-LOT1l and ko712)

8.5.2 - Anchor Sleeve

The coolant-salt lines 200 and 201 are each anchored on the reactor
cell end of each penetration. These anchors are designed to withstand
the forces due to the thermal expansions in the primary and secondary
systems. -

A 20-in. sched 80 carbon steel pipe about 5 ft long fits inside the
reactor cell sleeve, described above. The reactor cell end of this pipe
has a welded cap through which the 5-in. NPS salt line passes. The pipe

is welded to the cap by using & special 3-in.-long section welded into

 
 

 

310

the process line, this section containing a shoulder which permits a full
penetration weld that can be inspected and stress relieved. This Joint is
the anchor point in each line. The coolant-cell end of the 20-in. pipe
anchor sleeve is welded to the 32-in. 0D reactor cell sleeve described

above. See ORNL Dwg E-GG-C-41855

8.5.3 Shielding

The annular space between the 5-in. process line and the 20-in. anchor
sleeve is essentially filled with 1l-in.-thick 304 stainless steel shield-
ing discs for a distance of 8 in. on the reactor cell end of the penetra-
tion. The annual space between the heater shell, to be described below,
and the anchor sleeve has l-in.-thick firebox steel shielding discs for
a distance of 12 in. The first eight discs are stainless steel because
they will operate at a higher temperature than the remaining twelve. The
discs are thermally insulated from the process pipe with a thin layer of
Fiberfrax bulk ceramic fiber insulation (described in Section 5.6.6.3).
Other voids inside the anchor sleeve are also filled with this insulat-
ing material. See ORNL Dwg E-GG-Z-55498.

8.5.4 Heaters and Insulation

 

With the exception of about 12 in. on the reactor cell end of the
penetration, the process pipe inside the anchor sleeve is surrounded by
electric heating elements contained in a stainless steel shell. The
heaters are removable from the coolant-cell end of the penetration,
although probably with some difficulty because of the radiation streaming
through the opening.

Four 1/4-cylinder ceramic heating elements (for description see
section 5.6.6.2) 12 ih. long, each with a capacity of 3,000 watts
(at 230 v) provide the relatively large amount of heat needed on the
reactor-cell end of the penetration to keep the unheated length up to
temperature and to compensate for the heat conducted from the pipe wall
at the anchor point. On the coolant-cell side of this heater section
are four 12-in. long heater sections, each containing four 1/4-cylinder
heating elements of 300 watts capacity each (at 230 v). Only one-half
of each of the heater sections is used at one time, the other portion
gerving as a spare.

 
 

&

311

With the exception of the last heater section on the coolant-cell
end, the heaters are contained in a 22-gage, 304 stainless steel shell,
about 10 in. diam x 4 ft long. This shell is provided with spacers and
lugs to hold the ceramic heating plates, the heater leads, and the thermo-
couple sheaths, in position. The outside of the heater shell is thermally
insulated with a 3-1/2-in. thickness of Careytemp 1600 expanded silica
insulation, as described in Section 5.6.6.3.

See ORNL Dwg E-MM-Z-51670 for general assembly of heaters and in-

sulation.
8.6 Secondary Circulating System Piping and Supports

The tube side of the primary heat exchanger, the coolant-salt pump
and the radiator are interconnected with 5-in. sched 40 INOR-8 piping.
With the exceptions of the portions of the lines 200 and 201 inside the
reactor cell, all the coolant-salt piping is accessible for maintenance
a short time after reactor shutdown and uses more or less conventional
welded pipe joints and methods of heating, insulating and supporting the
piping. long radius (25-in.) bends are used where possible. The piping
at the reactor cell wall penetrations, at the pump and at the radiator
nozzles, is fixed in position, the thermal expansion being accommodated
by the flexibility of the piping.

All horizontal runs of piping in the circulating and drain systems
pitch downward at about 3°. The circulating system pitches to two low
points, one in line 201 Just outside the reactor cell wall penetration,
and the other in line 202 at the bottom outlet of the radiator. The
two 1-1/2-in. sched 40 INOR-8 drains, lines 204 and 206, are connected
at these points.

The freeze flanges, freeze valves, pipe line heaters and thermal
insulation for the coolant-salt piping are described and included in
the tabulations of the corresponding equipment in the primary circulat-
ing system, Section 5.6, in order to complete each of those particular

sections of the report.

8%.1 Piping Stresses and Flexibility Analyses

The coolant-salt piping inside the reactor cell, lines 200 and 201,
are sufficiently flexible between the anchor point at the cell wall and
the heat exchanger nozzles to absorb the thermal expansion of the piping

and the movements of the heat exchanger. The stresses in the coolant-

salt piping were included in the flexibility analyses made of the primary

piping, see Section 5.6.2. It is to be noted that the maximum stress in
the reactor cell salt piping was determined to be about 7,700 psi at the
coolant-salt inlet nozzle to the heat exchanger. 0?

The coolant-salt piping outside the reactor cell is anchored at the

cell wall penetration and at the radiator and pump nozzles. See ORNL Dwg

‘BE-GG-B-40T02. The major pieces of piping, all of which are 5-in. NPS,

are: line 200 from the pump discharge to the cell wall penetration,
line 201 from the penetration to the inlet header at the top of the ra-
diator bottom outlet header to the bottom of the coolant pump bowl. Line
202 contains a 25-in. radius return bend for the necessary flexibility,
and it is in this bend that the maximum pipeline expansion stress of
12,818 psi oceurs.t3? This is within the allowable stress range of
32,125 psi as determined by the Code of Pressure Piping, ASA p31.1.106
(Also, see footnote, Section 5.6.2) The expansion stresses in lines 200
and 201, which also contain 25-in.-radium 180° return bends, are 11,931
and 8,851 psi, respectively. 3”
The forces and moments at the pump support plates and at the ra-
139

diator inlet and outlet nozzles are within the acceptable values.
8.6.2 Coolant-Salt Piping Supports

The supports for coolant-salt lines 200 and 201 inside the reactor
cell are listed in Table 5.10 in Section 5.6.2.

The 5-in. coolant-salt piping in the coolant cell is hung on con-
stant-load Bergen supports to minimize stresses during warmup of the
system. Each of these supports a preset load equal to the calculated
weight of the piping and contents at that particular point, when the
support spring is in the zero position. As the system is heated, the

piping moves up or down at each position, as shown in Table 8.4. This

This movement is less than the maximum permissible movement of the

hanger in each case so that no additional stresses are imposed on the
piping by the supports.

Additional information on each hanger is shown in Table 8.L.

9. COOIANT-SALT STORAGE SYSTEM

A storage tank is provided at the bottom of the coolant cell to per-
mit complete drainage of the coolant-salt circulating system. The coolant
drain system consists of a drain tank, various drain and transfer lines,
freeze valves, and the associated valving, electric heaters, instrumen=-
tation, thermal insulation, etc.

Since the coolant salt does not generate appreciable afterheat when
drained into its storage tank, the heat removal system used on the fuel
drain tanks is not required on the coolant-salt drain tanks. In other
respects the tanks for the two systems are similar, see Fig. 2.6. Much
of the equipment in the coolant-salt drain system is of conventional de-
sign, since the coolant cell can be entered a short time after reactor
shutdown for direct inspection and maintenance. All parts of the system
in contact with the coolant salt are fabricated of INOR-8.

The portable cans for transfer of coolant salt to and from the MSRE
site are described separately in Part VII.

9.1 Iayout and General Description

The coolant-salt drain tank is located at the 820-ft elevation below
the radiator and its ducting in the coolant cell, as shown in Figs. 4.4
and 4.5. (See ORNL Dwgs E-GG-D-41888 and E-GG-B-40702)

Two drain lines are required to completely empty the coolant-salt
circulating system because of the piping configuration resulting from
the requirement that the flow of coolant salt be downward through the
radiator. ‘Each of these 1-1/2-in. sched 40 drain lines is provided with
a freeze valve, which, on interruption of the cooling air flow against
it, will thew and cause the system to drain by gravity. During drainage
the gas in the drain tank can be transferred to the top of the circulat-
ing system, or it may be vented to the off-gas system through a 1/2-in.
pipe leading past e radiation monitor and to the absolute filters and
the stack.

The 4O-in.-diam x 78-in.-high drain tank has a volume of about 50 £3;
there is approximately 4h £t3 of coolant salt in the circulating system.

 
 

316

The drained salt enters the top of the tank, and by means of an internal
dip tube, is discharged at the bottom. This dip tube permits transfer of
salt back into the circulating system by pressurization with helium gas
introduced at a top connection. The tank is provided with a single-point
liquid level probe and with weigh cells to determine the tank inventory.
The coolant salt is brought to the site in 2-1/2-5t3 cans holding
250 to 300:.1lbs of the non-uranium-bearing salt. The charging station,
where the cans are heated and connected to the system, is at the 852-ft
elevation above the special equipment room. Removal of a shield block on
the southwest corner of the roof of the room permits connection of a
charging line from the cans to a permanently-installed l-in. flange at
the 849-ft elevation, which is the terminus of a 1/2-in. INOR-8 pipe lead-
ing to a flanged connection Just above the coolant salt drain tank. The
blank flange normally in place at this lower comnection is removed and the
permanently-installed charging line is connected. The charging line dips
internally to the bottom of the tank so that salt can be transferred back

to the portable cans through the same lines.
9.2 Flowsheet

The coolant-salt drain system is included on the flowsheet for the
coolant system, Fig. 8.1 (ORNL Dwg E-AA-A-40881).

Salt is drained from the low point of the coolant-salt piping in the
coolant cell just outside the reactor cell wall penetration through the
1-1/2-in. sched 40 line 204. The low point in the piping at the radiator
outlet is also drained through a 1-1/2-in. pipe, line 206. The freeze
valves in these two lines, FV-20k and FV-206, have their exits joined by
a tee with the branch outlet facing upwards and connected to a short,
vertical length of L-in. sched 40 pipe with caps at each end. This res-
ervoir, which has an overall height of about 7 in., is to assure a suf-
ficient quantity of salt in the freeze valves after a drain to affect a
good seal. The pipe from the top of the 4-in.-pipe reservoir to the top
of the drain tank, line 204, is 1-in. sched 40, the smaller size being
used to obtain the flexibility in the tank connections needed for proper

operation of the weigh cells.

317

One electric heater circuit and one thermocouple are provided be-
tween the drain tank and the freeze valves. Bach of the two freeze
valves has three heater circuits, one in the center, one to control the
shoulder temperature at both ends of the valve and one on the freeze
valve reservoir. There is a thermocouple at each section of the shoulder
heaters and three couples on the freeze valve itself.

Salt is added to the drain tank through a 1/2-in. pipe, line 203.
This line leads from a flanged joint at the top of the special equipment
room to a flanged connection at the top of the drain tank, and, by means
of a dip tube, to within about 1-1/2 in. of the tank bottom. Line 203
has one heater circuit and eight thermocouples. When not in use in
adding or removing salt from the system, line 203 is blanked off both
at the flange above the drain tank and at the connection near the roof
plug.

When salt is to be added to the system, a helium cylinder is con-
nected to the 3/8 in. tubing at the charging station, line 615. This
line contains a pressure regulator, PCV-615A, and upstream and downstream
pressure gages. Line 615 then branches into two identical pressurizing
stations, or tinits. In the following description of one of the stations,
the line numbers for the other are given in parenthesis. Line 615 con-
nects to line 611 (612) at the pressure control valve PCV-611 (PCV-612).
Downstream of the control valve and the pressure gage connection, the
line branches to flow through two valves connected in parallel, V~-611-A
(V-612-A) and V-611-B (V-612-B), one of which serves as a spare. Line
611 (612) continues past a pressure gage connection and to a removable
spool piece, which is used to make the temporary connection to the port-
able salt cans. .

Helium for pressurization of the drain tank for salt transfer from
the tenk is supplied by the 1/2-in. pipe, line 511. The helium is fur-
nished at 40 psig from the 1/2-in. line 500 in the cover-gas system, see
Section 10. A pressure regulator, PCV-511, limits the helium supply pres-
sure to the tank to 30 psig. A throttling valve, HCV-511B and a control
valve HCV-511A, downstream of the regulator, are used to adjust the rate
of transfer. The three valves are pneumatically agpérated, with the

throttling and control valve adjusted from the control panel. A check

 

 
 

 

318

valve, CF-511, is provided in the helium supply to prevent backflow into
the cover gas system. The handvalves, V-511A and V-511B, provide iso-
lation of the gas supply valves for maintenance purposes.

The coolant drain tank is normally vented to the off-gas system
through a 1/2-in. stainless steel pipe, line 547, via line 527. The
latter is connected to the top of the tank at the same nozzle as the
helium pressurization gas supply. Line 547 contains a pneumatically-
operated control valve, HCV-547, which is adjusted by a hand switch at
the control panel.

When draining salt from the circulating system, the salt in the
loop is exchanged for the gas in the drain tank through the 1/2-in. inter-
connecting piping and valves, lines 527, 536 and 528. Line 527 contains
a control valve, HCV-527, before its juncture with line 536 upstream of
the control valve HCV-536. Line 536 joins line 528 upstream of the con-
trol valve, PCV-528. Line 528 connects to the top of the pump bowl.
This valving arrangement permits venting the gas from the top of the
pump bowl through line 528 and 536. Line 536, and its valve, HCV-536,
bypasses the control valve PCV-528, which is set to pass only about 1.k
liters/min of gas into the system, and would thus have insufficient
capacity when the flow is in the reverse direction as salt is being
added to the circulating system. A detailed description of the filling

procedures is given in Part VIII.

9.3 Coolant-Salt Drain Tank

9.3.1 Tank

The coolant-salt storage tank is 40 in. OD x about 78 in. high,
overall, with a wall thickness of 3/8 in. in the cylindrical portion.
The torispherical ASME flanged and dished heads are 5/8 in. thick. The
tank is mounted vertically on weigh cells by a support system described
subsequently in Section 9.3.2. Other pertinent data are given in Table’
9.1.

The tank and all its attachments are fabricated of INOR-8 and
generally in accordance with ORNL Specification MSR 62-3. The tank was

v}

ry

 
 

ty

 

319

designed for an internal pressure of 65 psig at 1300°F, and in accord-
ance with the requirements of Section VIII of the ASME Unfired Pressure
Vessel Code tT for primary nuclear vessels. The calculations of the
stresses in the walls, heads, and nozzles were based on standard re-
lationships (See Part IV Ref 18) and are within the allowable stress of
3500 psi at 1300°F for INOR-8.°

The top head is penetrated by five nozzles, as listed in Table 9.1.
A 3-in. sched 40 pipe provides an inspection port and access for a salt
sampler. This nozzle is flanged with a 3-in., 150-1b, ring-joint, weld-
neck flange and a mating blind flange having a leak detector connection.

The 1-in. nozzle for the drain connection, line 204, enters the top
head at the center and extends approximately 1-1/2 in. above the lower
head. A 1/2-in. sched 40 pipe, line 203, also extends through the top
head and, by means of a bend in the dip tube, terminates at the center
of the lower head. This arrangement is designed to reduce the amount
of "heel" left in the tank after a transfer. The two lines are welded
together at the bottom to provide stiffening. Line 203 has a special
flange just above the tank, see Section 9.4, following.

A 1/2-in. sched 40 nozzle in the top head is used for gas pres-
surization and for venting. A 2-1/2-in. nozzle is used for insertion
of the level probe, LE-CDT. This instrument has two single-point con-
ductivity type probes which indicates whether the salt is above or below
points marking 5% and 90% of the salt storage volume. (See Instru-

mentation, Part II)
9.3.2 Supports and Weigh Cells

The coolant drain tank is supported by two L-in. NPS steel pipe
columns resting on the coolant drain cell floor at the 820-ft elevation.
(See ORNL Dwg E-FF-D-41503) The installation incorporates two pneumatic
load cells (A. H. Emery Company) for determining the inventory of salt
in the tank.

A 11/16-in.-thick x 6-in.-wide skirt is joined with a full cir-
cumferential weld to the top of the tank just above the head weld.
Twelve stainless steel hanger rods, 5/8-in.-diam x 8-1/2 in. long, are

fastened by clevis~type couplings to this skirt and suspend the tank

from the support ring above. The carbon steel support ring is about
41-7/8-in. OD x 6 in. deep, and is fabricated of 1-1/2-in. plate*. Tt
has two arms about 20 in. long extending from opposite sides. Each of
the arms is suspended by three carbon steel hanger bolts,** 3/8-in. OD
x 38 in. long, from a pneumatic load cell resting on a 3/4-in.-diam steel
ball mounted on top of the support column. The columns pass through
holes in the above-mentioned support ring with a clearance of 1/4 in.
on a diameter, an amount sufficient to allow proper operation of the
weigh cells, but at the same time preventing the tank assembly from
falling off the supports. The long hanger rods and the point support
arrangement reduces the horizontal loading on the weigh cells to a neg-
ligible amount.

To effect maintenance on a weigh cell, or prior to removal of a
tank from the system, the weight of the tank must be removed from the
weigh cells. To accomplish this, the ends of each support ring arms
are equipped with a jack bolt which operates against a bracket on the
support columns, just below the arms. "A slight lifting of the arms by
these bolts permits unthreading of the three hanger bolts on each weigh
cell. It may be desirable at times to remove the weight from the Jack
bolts, such as to prevent swaying when cutting a pipe. To provide for
this a collar is installed on each support column just below the arms.
The weight of the assembly can be lowered onto these collars by backing
off on the Jack bolts after disconnecting the weigh cell hanger rods.

Further description of the maintenance procedures is given in Part X.
9.3.3 Electric Heaters and Insulation

The coolant-salt drain tank is heated on the sides by tubular
heaters totaling 11 kw, and on the bottom by ceramic flat-plate heater
units totaling 6 kw. A like amount of heater units are installed as
spare capacity. (See ORNL Dwgs E-MM-B-51668 and E-MM-A-40832)

There are thirty-two tubular heaters curved to a 20-13/16-in.

radius installed on the tank sides in a 304I, stainless steel frame.

 

*AST™M-A-285-57T Grade C fire box steel.
¥ASTM-A-193 Grade BT steel.

 
 

322

Each unit is a Calrod heater 0.315 in. OD x T4 in. long, with a heated
length of 60 in., sheathed in inconel, and rated at 2500 w at 230 v.

In each case two heaters are connected in series, and with a supply
voltage of 24k v, the actual capacity of each unit is 700 w, or 140 w/ft.
The tubular heaters are arranged in 16 horizontal rows on L-in.
centers, with the two heaters per row connected in series. The 16 rows
are divided into two equal groups, one termed the "top" section and the
other the "middle" section. Every other row is for normal use and the

remaining rows serve as spare units. There are thus four rows of two
working heaters each in each section, or a total of 5.6 kw/section,
with the four rows connected in parallel. The spare heater leads are
terminated in junction box CS-1, located at the 84O-ft elevation. (See
ORNL Dwgs E-MM-Z-51625 and E-MM-C-51667)

The sixteen heaters on the bottom of the drain tank, and termed
the "bottom" section, are flat ceramic heater plates about 7/8 in. thick
and having a trapizodial shape roughly resembling a right triangle with
an altitude of 14 in. and a base of 7 in. (See ORNL Dwg E-MM-B-40829)
The heaters are rated at 750 watts each at 230 volts. Half of the units
are used as spares, providing a total working capacity of 6 kw. All
heaters are connected in parallel with the electrical leads for the spare
group terminating in junction box CS-1 in the basement regulator area.
The units are arranged radially in a 30LL stainless steel support basket
suspended from the bottom of the tank.

The drain tank is thermally insulated with two layers of 2-1/2-in.-
thick "Careytemp" 1600°F block insulation. A 20-gage 304L stainless
steel liner is used between the tubular heaters and the thermal insu-
lation. The insulation is applied in a conventional manner since the

unit can be approached for direct maintenance.

9.3.4 Thermocouples

The temperature of the drain tank is monitored by thirteen thermo-
couples. Two of these are located at the center of the bottom, two at
the charging line nozzle, two at the drain line nozzle, and the rest
are distributed over the tank wall, as shown on ORNL Dwg D-HH-B-40532.

One thermocouple on the bottom head, two on the top head (one from each

 
[LEN

 

323

location) and one on the wall near the bottom, are connected to the data
logger. One thermocouple from the wall near the midplane is recorded

and the remaining eight couples are scanned and displayed.
9.4 Coolant-Salt Transfer Line 203

This line is used to transfer salt from the portable cans to the
drain tank when adding salt to the system and for returning the salts
to the cans when reprocessing is required. The line consists of a 3/8-in.
OD x 0.035-in. wall thickness monel (or inconel) tubing portion which is
installed only when making transfer operations. The tubing leads from
the portable cans to a special flange at the 849-ft elevation at the
southwest corner of the special equipment room. From this flange a per-
manently installed 1/2-in. sched 40 INOR-8 pipe leads to another special
flange located just above the top of the coolant-salt drain tank.

9.4.1 Upper Flange on Line 203

 

The 3/8-in. OD tubing from the portable cans is connected to a 1/2-in.
stainless steel, ring-joint flange. (See ORNL Dwg E-GG-D-55412) The
tubing is inserted 8 in. through the center of the flange using compres-
sion fittings. This flange mates with a stainless steel flange having
the basic dimensions of a 1l-in. 150-1b ring-joint, weld-neck flange, but
is machined to attach a 1/2-in. sched 40 INOR-8 pipe. The side of the
1l-in. flange is provided with a 1/4-in. OD tubing connection through
which helium purge gas can be introduced. This arrangement is used to
purge the line of air before the salt transfer is made and also assures
a gas space in the annulus between the tubing and the pipe wall to pre-
vent the coolant salt from coming in contact with the stainless steel
flange.

When Line 203 is not in use, the tubing to the portable cans is
disconnected and a stainless steel blank flange is used to close the

upper flange opening to prevent contaminants from entering.

9.4.2 lower Flange on Line 203

 

The 1/2-in. INOR-8 pipe leading from the upper flange terminates in

 
 

324

a 1/2-in. INOR-8 ring-joint, weld-neck flange just above the drain tank
nozzle. A 3/8-in. OD x 0.035-in. wall thickness x 12-in. long piece of
monel (or inconel) tubing is welded to the bottom center opening to ex-
tend the line into the drain tank nozzle. (See ORNL Dwg E-FF-A-40453)
The mating flange on the drain tank nozzle is a l-in. INOR-8 ring-joint,
weld-neck flange bored to accommodate the 1/2-in. sched 40 drain tank
nozzle. The side of this flange is provided with 1/4-in. OD tubing
connections leading to the helium gas supply in the leak-detector system.
As in the upper flange, this arrangement is designed to form an annulus
in which the helium gas prevents the salt from contacting the gasketed
Joint, where exceptional cleanliness is required when resealing the
flange.

When line 203 is not in use, the lower flanged joint is broken and
the opening is closed by an INOR-8 blind flange that has a 7/16-in. OD
INOR-8 rod 12 in. long welded to it to extend into the drain tank nozzle
to serve the same purpose as the tubing extension mentioned above. The

ring-joint is leak-detected during normal operation of the reactor.

10. COVER-GAS SYSTEM

The MSRE cover-gas system supplies helium for use as an inert gas
above the salt surfaces, as a carrier for removing fission-product gases
from the system, as a pressure source for the transfer of salt from one
vessel to another, as a means for control of the pressure within the
system, and, in the leak-detector system, as a monitor for leaks in the
mechanical joints.

The helium introduced into the system must be essentially free of
water vapor and oxygen (<1 ppm) to reduce the likelihood of oxide pre-
cipitation in the salt system.

The cover-gas system consists of a helium supply, dryers, oxygen-
removal units, a treated helium storage tank, and various valve mani-

folds and distribution piping, as indicated in Fig. 10.1.
10.1 Iayout and General Description

Helium is normally supplied from tanks mounted on a trailer parked
at the northwest corner of the Diesel House, see Fig. 3.2. The tanks
can be periodically refilled at the Y-12 Plant area.

Connections are made from the trailer to two parallel helium-treating
systems and the treated-helium storage tank located in the second bay of
the Diesel House. Bach of the two treatment systems consists of a helium
dryer, a preheater, and an oxygen-removel unit. The storage tank has a
capacity of 500 £3 (STP). An oxygen esnalyzer continuously monitors the
treated helium for residual oxygen. The treated helium is then piped to
the various process areas.

An emergency supply of helium is provided by six standard helium

cylinders located in the second bay of the Diesel House.

10.2 System Requirements

The primary requisite of the cover-gas system is to supply the

quantity of "high-purity" helium necessary for use in the fuel and

140

coolant salt systems, and the auxiliary systems.

The purge of helium through the fuel pump bowl was set initially at
3.5 liters/min, and it was estimated that 1 ppm of 0, in a 3.5-liter/min
helium purge stream would precipitate 5.5 g of Zr0, per year (equivalent
to 18 g of uranium per year). 41 Neutron irradiation of the fuel salt
will produce about 10 ce/day of oxygen in the fuel salt system when the -
reactor power level is 10 Myr, 142 which 1s equivalent to about 2 ppm of
0, in a 3.5-liter/min helium purge stream. On this basis, it was de-
cided that the oxygen contributed as a contaminant in the helium purge
gas supply should be held to a value of near 1 ppm, present either as
moisture or as 05+

The total volume of helium to be supplied continuously by the cover-

gas system is about 5.6 liters/min, distributed as follows:

Sweep gas to the fuel pump 2.4 liters/min
Two fuel pump bubbler level elements 0.9 "
Two coolant pump bubbler level elements 0.9 "
Purge to the coolant pump 0.6 "
Two overflow tank bubblers 0.9 "

Additional intermittent flows are used for pressurizing the leak-detection
system, for the transfer of salt, or for replacing the cover gas for the
lubricating-o0il tanks.

The cover-gas system was designed on the basis that a treatment and
supply facility with a capacity of 10 liters/min, when used in conjunction
with a 500-43 (STP) treated helium storage tank, would be capable of
handling the total demand.

An obvious requirement in the treated-helium storage and distribution
system is that it be as leaktight as possible to prevent the loss of helium
or its contamination by inleskage.

10.3 Flowsheet

The flowsheet for the cover-gas system is shown in Fig. 10.2 (ORNL
Dwg. D-AA-A-4088Y ). All the major piping in the system is 1/2-in. sched-40
stainless steel.

The helium is normally supplied from trailer-mounted tanks contain-
ing 39,000 £t3 (STP) at 2400 psi through the supply valve V-500A on line

500 downstream of V-500A through valves V-502A or V-502B via line 502.
Two pressure indicators, PI-S502A and PI-502B, show the emergency cylinder
bank pressure.

The supply line is provided with a pressure indicator and alarm,
PIA-500E, which alarms at 500 psig. This is followed by a pressure-
reducing valve, PCV-500G, which lowers the supply pressure to 250 psig.
This pressure is monitored by a high-low alarm switch, PA-500B, set at
275 psig and 200 psig. The supply line also has a 1/8-in.-0D tubing take-
off, line 548, leading to the oxygen analyzer A0,-548 through valves V-548
and the check valve CV-548.

The supply line then branches into two parallel 1/4-in.-0D, 0.065-in.
wall thickness, stainless steel tubing lines to supply the two helium-
treatment stations. The identical branches contain a hand velve, V-500B
(V-500A); a tee to a purge vent, line 505 (line 504); dryer No. 1 (No. 2);
a tee leading to a rupture disc, line 507, to be discussed subsequently;

a tee for a gas cylinder connection, line V-500C (V-500B); and an isolation
valve, V-500D (V-500C). The dryers, preheaters, and oxygen-removal units
will be discussed in Sections 10.5 - 10.8, following.

The 1/h-in. purge vents, lines 504 and 505 mentioned above, are used
to vent helium from cylinders which can be connected at V-500B and V-500C
to backflush and regenerate the helium dryers. The vents combine into a
single tube, line 5095, which contains a flow indicator, FI-505, before
the helium is vented to the atmosphere.

The rupture discs in lines 506 and 507 are rated at 350 psig and
provide overpressure protection for the helium-treating equipment. These
lines also contain high-pressure alarms, PA-506 and PA-507, which are set
at 275 psig.

The two branches of the treatment system recombine as line 500, which
is connected to a flow-indicating controller, FICA-500, and an air-operated
control valve, FCV-500, which limits the supply of gas flow to 10 liters/
min.

A second supply line to the oxygen analyzer, line 549, is taken off
line 500 at this point through the check valve, CV-549, and through the

stop valve, V-549. The treated-helium storage, or surge, tank is con-
nected to line 500 via line 597. This 1/2-in. line contains a normally

 
 

 

 

 

330

open valve, V-597A, and a branch connection to valve V-597B, which
serves as a temporary vacuum connection. A pressure gage, PI-He, on
line 597 indicates the surge tank pressure.

Downstream of the surge tank connection, line 500 contains a pres-
sure indicator, PI-500A, and a pressure alarm switch, PA-500K, which is
set to alarm at a low pressure of 100 psi. Following these instruments,
the helium supply to the leak-detector system is taken off, line 51k.
(This 250-psi supply line is routed through the water room and the elec-
tric service area to the transmitter room.) The leak-detector system is
described in Section 11, following. A branch from line 514, line 509,
supplies the sampler enricher, the graphite sampler and the coolant salt
sampler. (Line 509 tees off line 514 in the west tunnel and is routed
through the coolant drain cell, the special equipment room, then to the
high-bay area.) Line 541 supplies the graphite sampler; line 509, the
sampler enricher; and line 515, the coolant sampler.

The helium supply, line 500, then divides into two parallel lines,
line 500 and line 605, each of which contains a pressure~reducing station
set to lower the helium pressure to 40 psig. These control valves, PCV-
500C and PCV-605, have the usual isolation valves. After lines 500 and
605 rejoin, a pressure indicator, PI-500M, and a high-low alarm switch,
set at 48 psig and 30 psig, monitors the pressure in the continuing line
500.

Line 500 contains a check valve, CV-500B, ahead of a radiation
monitor, RIA-500. The helium supply to the chemical processing cell,
line 530, is taken off at this point.

In the water room, line 508 branches from line 500 to a rupture disc,
set at 50 psig. A pressure-relief valve is located in the vent line down-
stream of the disc. The vent discharges into the ventilation duct through
line 932. ‘A low-pressure switch in line 500 closes two solenoid valves
in the helium purge gas supply to the pump bowl, line 516, to insure that
back flow will not take place in that line in event the rupture disc blows.

Line 501 branches off line 500 in the west tunnel area to supply the
fuel and coolant salt pump bubbler systems. Line 517 is connected to line
01 and supplies helium to the drain, flush, and transfer tanks in the

drain tank cell, see Section 6. This line contains a flow restrictor,

 
wv

-

 

331

FE-517, which limits the flow to 0.5 scfm at the 65% full condition.

The restrictor is followed by a pressure control valve, PCV-517, which
limits the pressure used for transfer of salts, see Fig. 6.1 (ORNL Dwg
D-AA-A-40882). Line 517 is connected to the valve manifold, HCV-572,
HCV-574, and HCV-576, which serve the fuel drain tank No. 1, drain tank
No. 2, and the fuel flush tank, respectively. The control valves in
each of the three lines, 572, 574, and 576, are followed by two check
valves and a hand valve in series. (The check valves and the hand valves
are contained in a pot in the electric service area, and the 1/%-in.
line from each hand valve is run inside a 1/2-in. pipe to the drain tank
cell wall penetration.) Pressure transmitters for measuring the drain
tank pressures, PRA-572, PRA-5TL4, and PRA-576, are located in each of
the three lines downstream of the check valves.

As shown in the cover-gas system flowsheet, Fig. 10.1, line 511
leaves 500 to supply the coolant drain tank. This line has the follow-
ing valves in series: V-511A, CV-511, PCV-511, HCV-511B (throttling),
HCV-511A (block), and V-511B. Line 512 branches off line 511 upstream
of the first valve to supply the coolant salt pump with helium. As
shown in the coolant salt system flowsheet, Fig. 8.1 (ORNL Dwg D-AA-A-
40881), line 512 contains a hand valve, V-512, a check valve, CV-512,
and a flow control valve, FCV-512, with a maximum rate setting of 1.47
liters/min.

Line 510 branches off line 500 in the special equipment room and
leads to the service tunnel to supply helium to the lubricating-oil
storage tanks. As shown on the lubricating-oil system flowsheet, Fig.
5.25 (ORNL Dwg D-AA-A-40885), line 510 provides oil to the coolant pump
lube oil tank through valves V-510A, PCV-510A1, CV-510, and V-510B.

Line 513 branches off line 510 upstream of V-510A to similarly supply
the fuel salt pump lube-o0il tank through valves V-513A, PCV-513Al,
CV-513 and V-513B.

The cover-gas system flowsheet, Fig. 10.2, also shows a branch line
downstream of the line 510 takeoff, line 554, for attaching a possible
helium recycle system.

Another branch of line 500, line 516, supplies helium to the fuel-

 

 
 

332

salt circulating pump at a pressure of about 40 psig and a maximum rate
of 0.085 scfm. Line 516 contains two solenoid valves, HCV-516A and
HCV-516C; an indicating flow controller and alarm, FICA-516; and a flow
control valve, FCV-516, followed by two check valves, CV-516A and CV-
516B, and a hand valve, V-516. The function of the two check valves and
the two solenoid-operated valves is to assure that radioactive backflow
cannot develop in this line in event of loss of pressure in the helium sup-
ply. Line 516 then enters the reactor cell and goes to the lower gas in-
let on the fuel-salt circulating pump. A capped tee is provided between
the hand valve and the check valve to enable the check valves to be pres-
surized in order to test leak tightness. See Table 5.1 for helium supply
rates to fuel pump.

The check valves in lines 516, mentioned above, are located in a con-
tainment pot. The line is reduced from 1/2-in. pipe to 1/%-in. pipe at
the control valve and to 1/4-in.-OD tubing at the check valves. From the
check valves to the pump, line 51€ is 1/4-in.-OD tubing inside 1/2-in.
pipe to provide double containment for the portion outside the reactor

cell and to protect the tubing inside the cell.

10.4 Helium Supply

The helium supply trailer has 30 cylinders, each 9-5/8 in. diam
by 21 ft long, with a total capacity of 39,000 £3 (STP) at 2400 psi.
At the maximum estimated rate of use, 10 liters/min, this is equiva-
lent to a T6-day supply.

The emergency helium supply consists of six standard cylinders ar-
ranged in two banks of three cylinders each. At a use rate of 10 liters/
min this would be a 2.l-day supply. However, by changing these emergency
cylinders in banks of three, the emergency supply arrangement could be

used indefinitely.

10.5 Dryers

The helium dryers in lines 500 and 503 each consist of a vertical

section of 2-in. 304 stainless steel sched-40 pipe capped at each end

 
 

a

333

and with a 1/2-in. sched-40 pipe nipple welded to each cap, see ORNL Dwg

BE-JJ-C-40855. The pipe section is sbout 41 in. long and ¢ontains a 30-in.

depth of drying medium supported on a l-in. depth of stainless steel wool
at the bottom and having about 1-3/8 in. of the same wool at the top. The
wool is held in place by 1/8-in.-thick plates with 1/16-in.-diam holes on
1/k-in. centers in a square pattern for a total of 37 holes. The plates
are tack-welded in place.

The drying medium is Linde type 13x Molecular Sieve, 1/16-in.-diam
pellets. Each dryer contains about 2-1/2 1b of pellets.

Bach dryer bed is designed for a flow rate of 10 liters/min (STP) and
to decrease the moisture content of the helium from 100 ppm to < 1 ppm on

143

an on-stream cycle of 15 days. The actual moisture content of the
helium supply is thought to be less than 10 ppm so the bed life should be
well in excess of 15 days.

The dryers are to operate at 250 psig and 80°F. For mechanical
strength considerations, however, the design conditions were taken as
LOO psig and 70°F. Since conventional hydraulic testing could not be
employed after final assembly, the units were pneumatically tested at
500 psig (see ORNL Dwg E-JJ-C-40855).

The normal flow direction is upward through the bed. The dryers can
be regenerated by purging with a downward flow of fresh helium while heat-
ing the bed. Heat for the regeneration is supplied by two 500-w, 240-v
strip heaters (Chromolox Cat. No. S. E. 2550) about 25 in. long strapped
to the upper portion of the pipe section. The heat is controlled by
thermocouples located on the pipe wall about 1 in. from the end of the
heated section. The wall is heated to a maximum of 500°F . The purge
flow rate is about 1.5 liters/min, the exit gas temperature at the com-
pletion of the drying cycle is about 500°F, and the internal pressure
during regeneration is a maximum of 10 psig.

" The entire unit is insulated with 1 in. of magnesia insulation.
10.6 - Preheater

Each of the preheaters in lines 500 and 503 is designed to heat a
flow of 10 liters/min of helium to 750°F, required for the oxygen-

 
 

 

 

334

removal units.

The preheater consists of a 2-in. sched-40 stainless steel pipe
section 10 in. long with flat plates tack-welded to each end, see ORNL
Dwg. E-JJ-C-55485. Two 250-w, 120-v curved Chromolox strip heaters,

8 in. long, are strapped to this shell. Two thermocouples mounted 4 in.
from the end are used to control the temperature. The helium flow is
through a 10-ft length of stainless steel tubing 1/4 in. OD x 0.035 in.
wall thickness, coiled around the heater unit. The entire assembly is
covered with 3/b in. of the heat-conducting medium, "High Temperature

Thermon," and insulated with 2 in. of high-temperature insulation.

10.7 Oxygen Removal Units

 

Identical titanium sponge-type oxygen-removal units are installed
in lines 500 and 503 to assure that the helium flow to the cover-gas
system contains less than 1 ppm of 0,- Oxygen contamination of the
helium supply is largely the result of handling and should not exceed
about 100 ppm. The average 0, content may be about 10 ppm.

As indicated in Fig. 10.3, the oxygen-removal unit consists of a
l-in. sched-5 titanium pipe 21 in. long filled with an oxygen getter of
Electromet (Cleveland, Ohio) titanium sponge having a Brinell hardness
of 125 and sized so that 100% passes a 5/8-in. mesh screen and 95% is
retained on a 1/8-in. mesh. The pipe is mounted vertically, using lava
spacers, inside 220-v "Thermoshell" ceramic heating elements (Cooley
Electric Co., Indianapolis), of 1200 w total capacity. A stainless steel
reflector, 0.005-in. thick, is tightly wrapped around the heating ele-
ments. The heat reflector is surrounded by a 3/4-in. thickness of
"Fiverfrax" QC-10 thermal insulation (Carborundum Company). The as-
sembly is contained inside a 4-in. sched-UO stainless steel pipe, with
ring-joint flanges at top and bottom. One-half-inch IPS pipe nipples
are provided at top and bottom for the gas exit and inlet (see ORNL Dwg
E-JJ-C-56250).

The units operate at 250 psig with a temperature in the titanium
sponge of 1200°F + 50°F. The design pressure is 400 psig and the de-

sign temperature of the pressure-containing 4-in. pipe is a maximum of

1000°F. Leak tests were made in accordance with Par. UG-100 of Section
VIII of the ASME code, ¥T using nitrogen at 700 psig. Helium leakage
wes less than 107 liters (sTP)/24 hr.

A chromel-alumel thermocouple is inserted in a well a short dis-
tance into the bottom inlet of the titanium sponge. This 1/8-in.-diam
stainless steel-sheathed couple is welded to a trepanned hole in the
lower flange and has compression-type fittings on the outside of the
flange.

Three 1/16-in.-diam sheathed thermocouple leads are inserted
through the 4-in. pipe wall near the top through lava-sealed packing
glands, "Conax" Cat. No. MPG - 1/16 in. Two of these chromel-alumel
couples are located at about mid elevation between the titanium pipe
wall and the heater element, and the third is at the top outlet gas pas-
sage.

Two 1/8-in.-diam chromel-alumel sheathed thermocouples are pro-
vided on the outside of the 4-in. pipe.

The two electric leads for the heater elements are brought through

the 4-in. pipe wall near the top in individual seals, "Ceramaseal"

Dwg 804A38878.

10.8 Treated-Helium Storage Tank

 

A storage tank is provided for treated helium to take care of the
intermittent periods when the helium demand 1s considerably greater than
the normal continuous flow rate of 10 liters/min. The volume of the
storage, or surge, tank is specified to be 27 £3 so that two fuel salt
transfers and two coolant salt transfers could be made without decreas-
ing the helium supply pressure below 100 psig.

The tank is an 8-ft long section of 24-in. sched-30 pipe of 347
stainless steel, capped at each end. It is designed for a working pres-
sure of 250 psig and a test pressure of 375 psig. The design operating
temperature is 80°F. The tank has a storage capacity of about 500 £3

(STP) of helium.

10.9 Bubblers for Indicating the Salt levels in the Fuel
and Coolant Pump Bowls and Overflow Tank

The helium bubbler arrangement used to indicate the level of salt
in the pump bowls and the overflow tank is described in this section
since it is closely associated with the helium distribution system. In
brief, the level is determined by measuring the gas pressure required
to displace the liquid salt in dip tubes which extend below the surface
of the salt in the pump bowls and overflow tank. The dip-tube pressure

is measured by a/p cells, referenced to the pressure in the vapor space.
10.9.1 layout and General Description

The bubbler arrangements used on the fuel and coolant pump bowls
and overflow tank are identical except for location and the containment
of the fuel system. The fuel pump bubbler is described in the following
paragraphs with the coolant pump and the overflow tank equipment and
locations given in parenthesis in the same order.

The fuel pump bowl is described in Section 5.4.1.2.

As shown on the fuel system flowsheet, Fig. 5.3 (8.1), there are
two bubbler lines, lines 593 (598)(599) and 596 (595)(600), and one ref-
erence line, line 592 (59%)(589). These lines are fabricated of 1/4-in.-
OD x 0.065-in.-wall stainless steel tubing and are connected to the
4O-psig helium supply, line 501, in the transmitter room. Bach line has
a block valve at the header and & throttling valve to adjust the helium
flow. All the bubbler lines are routed past duplicate radiation monitors,
R1A-596A and R1A-596B, through conduit to the special equipment room. In
this location the fuel pump and overflow tank bubbler lines have flow
restrictors installed which limit the flow in lines 593 (599) and 596

(600) to 366 cc/min (STP) and in line 592 (589) (the reference line) to

150 cc/min, when the helium supply pressure is 25 psig. The three coolant
pump bubbler lines, 598, 595, and 594%, continue to the coolant cell where
similar flow restrictors are provided.

The fuel pump and overflow tank bubbler lines enter a containment
tank (not required for the coolant pump lines) where each line has two

check valves in series (one check valve in coolant system). The check

 
 

338

valves are followed by solenoid valves as follows: line 592, HCV-593-
B2 (line 59%, HCV-595-Bl) (line 589, HCV-599-B2); in line 593, HCV-593-
B3 (line 598, HCV-595-B3) (line 599, HCV-599-Bl); and in line 596, HCV-
593-Bl (line 595, HCV-595-B2) (line 600, HCV-599-B3). (See valve tabu-
lations in Table 10.1.) Following these valves, the reference pressure,
line 592 (59%) (589) is connected to line 596 (595) (600) through a
solenoid valve, HCV-593-B5 (HCV-595-B5) (HCV-599-B5), and to line 593
(598) (599) through the solenoid valve HCV-593-B4 (HCV-595-Blk) (HCV-
599-Bl4). These cross connections are for equalizing the pressure across
the d/p cells, which are connected between lines 592 (59%) (589) and

596 (595) (600), LI-596 (1I-595) (LIA-600), and between lines 592 (594)
(589) and 593 (598) (599), IRA-593 (LRA-598) (LTA-599). The last-
mentioned a/p cells serve both as level indicators and as an input to
recorders and an alarm system. As was mentioned in Section 5.4.1.2, a
difference in 2 in. in the distance the two dip tubes extend beneath the
surface of the salt in the pump bowls, 593 (598) is the shorter, may
permit variations in the density of the salt to be noted. Both dip tubes
extend to the bottom of the overflow tank since it is desirable to have
duplicate readings on the quantity of salt remaining.

A connection is made to line 592 (589) for the fuel pump bowl pres-
sure transmitters, PRC-522A and PIA-522B, and to 589 for PIA-589 and
PXM-581.

Each of the lines, 592 (594%) (589), 593 (598) (599), and 596 (595)
(600) has a hand valve outside the cell wall penetration. The lines
to the fuel pump and overflow tank are 1/4-in.-OD tubing run inside

1/2-in. pipe inside the reactor cell to provide double containment.
10.9.2 Containment Tank

The fuel pump bubbler containment tank, or instrument box, is a pres-
sure-tight container for the above-mentioned solenoid valves and 4/p
cells.

The tank is fabricated of a 21-in. length of 24-in. sched-10S, 304
stainless steel pipe, with a flanged pipe cap at each end to give an
overall length of about 44 in. (see ORNL Dwg E-JJ-D-55422). The de-

sign pressure is 50 psig but the normal operating pressure is 0 psig

at ambient temperatures. The inlet tubing penetrations consist of
1/4-in., 30,000-1b autoclave couplings. The outlet tubing penetration
is a 6-in. sched-40 tangential pipe nipple which is also welded to the
extension of the reactor cell penetration (see ORNL Dwg E-JJ-D-55428).
The four electrical conductor penetrations of the tank have Amphenal
seals and serve the two d/p cells from the 11 solenoid valves. Two
l-in. pipe nipples extending from the top of the tank serve as con-
tainment for the 1/4-in. tubing leading from line 502 to the pressure
transmitters PRC-522A and PIA-522B.

The a/p cells are accessible by opening one of the flanged ends

of the tank and the solenoid velves may be serviced from the other end.

10.10 Piping, Valves, and Appurtenances

 

All piping in the cover-gas system is 304 stainless steel sched 40.
The tubing is 304 stainless steel of various diameters and thicknesses.
All fittings are welded, with the exception of the threaded valves in
the portions of line 500 and 502 that contain untreated helium. The
tubing fittings are 30,000-1b autoclave, or equivalent, with the ex-
ception that the control valves in the 1/8-in. lines S48 and 549 have
Swaglok compression-type fittings.

The hand valves are listed in Table 10.1, the check valves in
Table 10.2, and the control valves, including the pressure regulators,
in Table 10.3.

11. IEAK DETECTOR SYSTEM

A legk detector system is used to monitor all flanges in the MSRE
system which could permit the escape of rediocactive materials. Joints
in lines containing lubricants or coolants important to the operation
end safety of the reactor are also leak detected. In addition, all
flanges which must be maintained by remotely operated tooling are pro-
vided with leak-detected type joints to serve as an indication of satis-
factory reassembly. 1% There are about 100 leak-detected flanges in the
system.

The leak detector system operates on the principle of maintaining
an over-pressure of 100 psig of helium at all joints. In event of a
leek in the process system, helium will flow into the affected system.
The resulting loss in pressure at the leak detector system supply headers
actuates an alarm system. Each of the 60 or more lesk detector lines is
provided with a hand valve at the header to permit isolation of the line
to determine the location of the leaking joint.

11.1 Iayout and General Description

In brief, the leak detector system consists of eight manifolds, or
headers, mounted in a leak detector station cabinet, 2-ft x L-ft x 6-1/2
ft, located on the south side of the transmitter room. (This room is
at the 840-ft elevation, east of the drain tank cell and north of the
reactor cell. See Fig. 4.4.) The headers are connected to the helium
supply from the cover-gas system and to the leak detector lines leading
to each flange. Ieakage is detected by header pressure drop and measured
by the rate at which the pressure in the header drops as compared to an
equivalent tank volume (500 cc). This arrangement partially compensates
for pressure changes in the system due to ambient temperature variations
in the transmitter room.

 

*By definition, if a continuous inflow of helium is required to a
part of the system, it is termed & "buffer" flow rather than lesk de-

tection.

»

 
f

 

345

The leak detector lines leading to the reactor, drain tank, and
fuel processing cells, pass through the floor beneath the leak detector
system cabinet and are routed to the cell wall penetrations in "Iay-In-
Ducts." The general location of the lines is shown in Fig. 11.1. The
leak detector lines to the coolant cell and vent house are run through
conduit around the reactor cell to the special equipment room; from here
to the point of application they are mounted on "Unistrut." The leak
detector tubing inside the reactor and drain tank cells is either sup-~
ported by "Iay-In-Ducts” or mounted on "Unistrut."

Figure 11.2 shows a typical lesgk-detected joint. The leak detection
arrangement as applied to a freeze flange is shown in Fig. 5.29. The oc-
tagonal O-ring type gasket is drilled to permit transmission of the helium
gas pressure to gll four of the sealing surfaces.

On some lines, one leak detector is connected in series to serve two
or more sets of flanges. Where valves have leak-detected joints, both
sets of the valve flanges are served with one leak detector line, see
Fig. 11.3.

Where both flange faces in a pair must be removable for maintenance
reasons, such as on the pumps, the freeze flanges, etc., it is necessary
that the leak detector lines have disconnects which cen be remotely ma-
nipulated. These disconnects are described in Section 11.6, following.

The leak detector system is constructed of 30k stainless steel.

The tubing is 1/b-in. OD x 0.083-in. wall thickness and all piping is
sched hO. All valves are bellows sealed, as described in Section 11.5.

If it is assumed that the leak rate of 107° cc/sec determined in
the development of the freeze flanges (pp 41-45 Ref 38) is representative
of the average leak rate of the 100 flanges in the MSRE system, the total
leakage is in the order of 6 cc/min. This amounts to about 75 cc/min per
header. Teking the average volume of a header and its connected lines
to be about 1,000 cc, this loss of helium smounts to a pressure loss of
gbout 0.66 psi/hr., The minimum full range of the differential-pressure
cell used to indicate the pressure difference between the header and the
volume tank is 5 in. of water, or about 0,18 psi. A change in the dif-
ferential pressure of 0.05 psi per hour (28% of full range) indicates a
leak rate of about 0.04 cc/min (6.67 x 107% cc/sec).

11.2 Flowsheet

The flowsheet for the leak detector system is shown in Fig. 11.4
(ORNL drawing D-AA-A-40890).

Helium is supplied at 250 psig through 1/2-in, Line 514 from the
cover-gas system (see Section 10,3). This line reduces to 1/kh-in.
tubing inside the leak detector system cabinet. The helium is supplied
through valves V-514-B, CV-51L, and PCV-514, the latter regulating the
pressure to 100 psig. After passing a connection through which helium
can be supplied in an emergency, the flow is distributed to each of the
eight headers. The distribution line, Line 51k, contains a high-low
pressure alarm switch set for the 90 to 110 psig range. Each helium
supply to a header is provided with an isolation valve. Each header
serves as a valve manifold for ten 1/b-in, leak detector lines, which
are grouped by application and location, as shown in Table 11.1.

Lines 410 through 41h on header 401 serve the reactor cell freeze
flanges. Lines 415 through 419 are spare leak detector lines leading
into the reactor cell, All ten of these lines have one hand valve at
the header and are ‘provided with disconnect couplings inside the reactor
cell,

Header L402 serves the reactor cell helium lines. Each of these
leak detector lines, 420 through 429, has two hand valves in series,
with the inner, or "B" valve, being used to prevent backflow from the
cell in event maintenance is required on the operational valve, "A."
Each of these leak detector lines is connected to two pairs of flanges
in series. There are no spare lines on this header.

Header 403 monitors reactor cell water lines. Ieak detector Lines
430 through L434 are connected to half-flanges in the thermal shield water
piping. (These half-flanges are installed where the welded piping system
is likely to be cut for maintenance procedures snd later rejoined by
spool pieces with bolted mechanical joints.) Lines 435 through L439 serve
other water piping flanges. Each of these ten lines has one hand valve
at the leak detector system header. :

Header UOL serves miscellaneous reactor cell flanges, such as the
oil piping flanges (leak Detector Lines L440, 441, and 442), and the pump

and reactor neck flanges (Lines L43 through 446). Lines 4L43 through Lib
have two valves in series at the header. Lines Lik through 449 have dis-
connect couplings inside the cell. Lines Lh7, LLB, and LLY are spare
lines for the reactor cell,

Header 405 is used to monitor gas piping flanges in the drain tank
cell. Iine L450 is a spare leak detector line to this cell. Lines 451
through 459 have two valves in series at the header.

Header L406 serves the drain tank cell steam and water piping flanges.
Lines L460 through 465 are used for this purpose and the remaining four
lines serve as spares for the drain tank cell.

Header 407 is used for flanges classified as miscellaneous. These
include the coolant salt circulating pump upper and lower flanges (Leak
Detector Lines 470 and 471), and flanges at the gas control valves in the
coolant cell and in the vent house (Leak Detector Lines 472, 473, and
479). Lines UT4 through 476 monitor flanges on the fuel drain tanks.
These three lines have disconnects inside the drain tank cell. Lines 473
through 476 have two valves in series at the header. Line L478 is a spare
line to the coolant cell.

Header 408 monitors flanges in the fuel processing cell. Lines L480
and 481 serve flanges on the control valves HCV-692 and HCV-694. Lines 482
and L483 are installed spares to the electrical service area. Lines L484 ana
489 are spares. ’

All eight of the above-mentioned headers are connected through hand
valves to Line LOO, which leads to the 500-cc tank through a normally
closed block valve, V-40O. A differential-pressure cell, PAT-L0O, con~-
nected between this tank and Line 400, senses small changes in the header
pressure compared to the tank pressure. In addition, Line 400 has a high
end low pressure switch which annunciates an alarm on the main control
panel in event of deviation from the 90 to 110 psig set range.

11.3 Headers

Each header consists of a 19-1/2-in. long section of 1-1/2-in. sched
Lo, 30k stainless steel pipe, capped at each end (see ORNL drawing
D-JJ-D-55403)., A 1-1/h-in.-diam stainless steel rod is enclosed inside

 
 

353

each header to reduce the free volume. To assure that this inserted
rod does not block any of the leak detector openings, three equally
spaced wires, 0.040-in. diam, are tack welded the length of the insert
to space it centrally within the header pipe. The free volume of any
branch was limited so that the response time for a leak of 1 cc/min
would not be less than 0.5 psi/hr (p 2 Ref 145).

There are thirteen 1/4-in. OD x 0.083-in. wall thickness tubes
welded to each header. To these are connected the ten leak detector
lines, the helium supply from Line 514, the connection to Line 400 and

the tank, and a line to a pressure gage.
11.4 Valves

Each tubing line contains a miniature, bellows-sealed hand valve
(Hoke, Type 480). These valves were salvaged from the Homogeneous Reactor
Test (HRE-2) and were completely inspected, reconditioned and tested.

Leak detector lines which monitor flanges in direct contact with radio-
active gases have two of these valves installed in series at the header
so that the inner valve can be closed to isolate the system while the

operational valve is being repaired.
11.5 Disconnects

In the cases where flanges inside the reactor cell must have both
faces removed to effect a maintenance procedure, the associated leak de-
tector lines must have nearby disconnects which can be operated by remote
tooling. These couplings must be as free as possible from any leakage.

The design selected for use in the MSRE, as shown in Fig. 11.5, was
developed in the ORNL Chemical Technology Division and in the Reactor Di-
vision. 140 The sealing principle is based on elastic deformation of a

‘polished metal cone when inserted in a polished seat. The block on which
the male cone is mounted and the block containing the matching seat are
of the proper dimensions to make contact to prevent the cone from being
Jemmed into the seat and deformed plastically. The two blocks are held
together by a simple but positive yoke assembly. The single bolt on

this yoke facilitates operation by remotely handled tools.

Tests made during development of the coupling indicate that a leak
rate of less than 107 cc/sec (STP) can be expected even after the joint
has been broken and remade thirty times or more. These tests were made
at room temperature. tT At temperatures of a few hundred degrees (°F),
it was indicated that the joint might be manipulated at least twenty times
before the lesk rate was increased. It is anticipated that all MSRE dise
connects will operate at the cell ambient temperature of about 150°F. A
light coating of an alcohol-graphite mixture is recommended for the cone
before the joints are made.

11.6 Iocal leak Detectors

The flanges in the fuel and coolant pump lubricating oil systems
are provided with local lesk detector connections to which helium gas
cylinders can be connected when a lesk is suspected. This leak detection
arrangement is not connected to the reactor lesk detector system. Each
of the lube oil packages contains nine local leak check points, see the
lubricating oil flowsheet, Fig. 5.25 (ORNL drawing D-AA-A-40885).

12. OFP-GAS DISPOSAL SYSTEM

The off-gas facility provides for the safe disposal of radioactive
gases discharged from the MSRE. The system handles three different types
of gas flow: (1) the continuous discharge of helium containing highly
radioactive fission-product gases swept from the fuel salt circulating
pump bowl; (2) intermittent, relatively large flows of helium containing,
at times, significant amounts of radioactive gases and particulates, such
as that discharged during salt transfer operations; and (3) flows of up to
100 cfm of very low activity cell atmosphere gas (5% 0,, 95% N,), which
is ejected either intermittently or continuously to maintain the reactor
and drain tank cells at sub-atmospheric pressure. )

The unstable isotopes of iodine and bromine resulting from the fis-
sioning of the 23% in the fuel salt largely remain in the salt solution
as complex halides until they decay to elemental xenon and krypton. Since
it is desirable to remove the 13%e from the fuel salt circulating system
because of its high cross section for capture of neutrons (a= 3.5 x 10° b),
it and other fission-product gases are swept from the fuel pump bowl by a
helium gas flow of about 4 liters/min (0.15 cfm at STP). When operating
at the 10-Mw reactor power level, the activity of this stream leaving the
pump is about 280 curies/sec. 48

The gases are held in the piping for about two hours for the short-
lived isotopes to decay. They then pass into a water-cooled bed of acti-
vated charcoal. The adsorbed xenon is retained in the bed for at least
90 days and the krypton is held for 7-1/2 days or more. During this time,
essentially all the fission-product gases decay to stable elements, some
of which are solids that remain in the charcoal. Only three radioactive
isotopes, 8%, 131mg. and 133, exist in any significant amounts in the
helium carrier gas leaving the charcoal bed. (See Table 12.1) Of these,
the 8x with its half-life of 10.27 years, is of the greater concern.
The maximum discharge rate of this isotope is 5 curies per day.

The effluent from the charcoal bed is monitored for activity before
passing through roughing filters and then absolute filters having an ef-

ficiency of 99.9% for particles greater than 3 microns in size. The gas

is massively diluted with atmospheric air and discharged from the top of

a 100-ft-high stack about 110 ft south of Building 7503. The concentration
of 85 in the stack discharge is a maximum of 6.2 x 10 ~ microcuries/cc,
which is within the accepted tolerance level. The ground level concen-
tration is estimated to be less than this by a factor that may be as great
as 10,000.

12.1 Iayout and General Description

In addition to the fuel pump bowl, other equipment vented to the off-
gas system includes: the three fuel salt drain tanks in the drain tank
cell, the fuel pump shaft seal seepage in the reactor cell, the graphite
sampler, also in the reactor cell, the sampler-enricher in the high-bay
area, the coolant salt pump seal and pump bowl in the coolant cell, the
two lubricating oil system packages in the service tunnel area, the coolant
salt drain tank in the coolant drain cell, and the reactor and drain tank
containment cells themselves.

Design data for the off-gas system are summarized in Table 12.1.

The schematic diagram in Fig. 12.1 and the following brief outline
of the course of the fuel circulating pump bowl off-gas line, and the
equipment associated with it, will serve as a general description of the
off-gas system. The gases leave the bowl through a 1/2-in. stainless
steel pipe, line 522. The pipe size changes to 4 in. at the disconnect
flange and partially circles the inside wall of the containment vessel.
The total length of 4-in. pipe is about 68 ft, which includes a serpen-
tine section, and provides a holdup volume of about 6 £3. This is suf-
ficient for about one hour's delay for the decay of fission-product
isotopes. A U-ft horizontal length of the 4-in. line 522 is enclosed
in a 6-in. sched 10 pipe at the 831-ft elevation and 400-600 scfm
containment atmosphere gas (95% No,» 5% 0,) is introduced through line
960 into the annular space to help cool the off-gas.

The off-gas line continues through the reactor cell wall penetration
as 1/2~in. pipe and across the coolant salt areas as 1/b-in. pipe encased
in a 3/4-in. pipe, which, in turn, is surrounded by about 4 in. of lead

shielding. Line 522 then passes through valves in a pressure-tight

instrument box located in the lower portion of the vent house. From here
it continues as a 1/4-in. pipe in an underground shielded duct to an under-
ground valve box and then to the charcoal bed cell. This cell is located
below grade just south of the vent house, as shown in Fig. 3.2. The cell
was an existing facility consisting of a 10-ft-diam x 22.7-ft-deep re-
inforced concrete pit with a 3-ft thick removable concrete cover.

The off-gas pipe, line 522, connects to three vertical 20-ft high
U-tubes of 3-in. pipe which provide about 7 £3 of holdup volume and an
additional one hour of residence time. The gas then enters one of two
activated charcoal beds, the other bed acting as a spare. Each of the
two beds consist of two vertical sections of U-tubes with the pipe size
varying from 1-1/2 in. to 6 in., and each containing about 22 £63 of
activated charcoal. The charcoal bed cell is filled with water and the
beds are cooled by the water flow through the cell.

The effluent from the charcoal beds, which consists primarily of the
helium carrier gas¥*, flows through an underground 1/2-in. pipe to an under-
ground valve box and then to a filter pit located about 75 ft south of
Building 7503. (See Fig. 9 and Section 4.7) The reinforced concrete
filter pit is about 21 x 29 ft, varies from 5-1/2 ft to 7-1/2 ft in depth,
and is covered by 1-1/2-ft-thick concrete roof plugs. The off-gas mixes
with about 21,000 cfm of air drawn through the filters by a 50-hp fan
(an identical fan is installed as a spare) and, thus massively diluted,
is discharged from a 3-ft-diam x 100-ft-high steel stack located about
110 ft south of Building T7503.

Off-gas vented from other points in the MSRE system is handled
similarly and utilizes much of the same equipment. The gas discharged
from the fuel drain tanks flows through a 1/2-in. pipe crossing the
coolant salt area to the aforementioned instrument box at the vent house,

end to an auxiliary charcoal bed located in the charcoal bed cell. The

isotopes in this stream have already decayed to reduce the heat release

rate sufficiently to permit use of larger diameter pipe for this charcoal

 

*There are no provisions in the MSRE for processing and reuse of
helium. Consideration has been given to adding this facility later in
the experiment.

bed. Two vertical U-tube sections of 6-in. pipe contain about 16 £3 of
activated charcoal. The outflow of this bed joins the flow from the main
charcoal beds, and other off-gas streams, and is monitored, filtered and
diluted before discharge up the off-gas stack to the atmosphere.

Cover gas vented from the coolant salt circulating pump bowl and
from the coolant salt drain tank bypasses the charcoal beds in the off-
gas system, but is monitored and filtered before discharge.

The cell atmosphere gas is evacuated from the reactor containment
vessel and the drain tank cell by blowers located in the special equip-
ment room. The blower discharge, after passing through a gas cooler, is
for the most part, returned to the cells to cool specific items of equip-
ment, such as the upper portion of the fuel circulating pump bowl. - (The
component cooling system is described in Section 16.) A small side stream
of the blower discharge is vented through the off-gas system to atmosphere
to maintain the cells below atmospheric pressure. This 1-1/2-in. line
passes through the vent house, where the gas is monitored, and may be
sampled when necessary, before being filtered and discharged up the stack.

The filters, stack fans, and stack are described in Section 13.
12.2 Flowsheet

The off-gas system flowsheet is shown in Fig. 12.2 (ORNL Dwg D-AA-A-
40883). The origin of the lines venting to the off-gas system are, in
general, not shown in Fig. 12.2, but on the flowsheets fbr the particular
items of equipment involved.

The off-gas line from the fuel circulating pump bowl, line 522, is
1/2-in. pipe but changes to L-in. pipe a short distance from the pump and
extends for about 68 ft inside the reactor cell to provide a holdup volume
of about 6 £3 and a residence time of about one hour. The line continues
as 1/2-in. pipe through the cell wall penetration and across the coolant
drain cell as 1/4-in. pipe to an instrument box located in the lower
portion of the vent house. In this box the flow passes through a hand
valve, V-522-A, a porous filter, and then a pressure control valve,

PCV-522. This valve maintains a constent pressure of ~ 5 psig in the
pump bowl by throttling the sweep gas discharge. (The flow rate of the

sweep gas is largely determined by the control valve and flow indicator
on the helium supply to the pump bowl line 516.) Provisions are made at
each side of the pressure control valve for a future gas sampling station
(valves V-522-B and V-522-C). A differential pressure cell, PAI-556, is
connected at this point and to line 557 downstream of the charcoal bed to
indicate the pressure drop due to gas flow across the bed.

pump flows through the 1/2-in. line 524 to outside the reactor cell and

radiation damage. The estimated oil flow is less than 40 cc/day and
the accompanying helium flow is about 0.07 liters/min. The oil
catch tank, waste oil receiver and connecting piping are shown on the
fuel salt circulating system flowsheet, Fig. 5.3. The equipment is de-
scribed in Section 5.4.1.5. The gas flow leaving the oil catch tank,
stripped of oil, passes through a sintered disc filter, a capilliary
flow restrictor which limits the flow to the above-mentioned 0.07 liters/
min, and a capilliary flowmeter, FIA-524.

at this point leading to a sampling valve, V-524. After passing through
a check valve, CV-524, line 524 joins the above-mentioned line 522 down-
stream of the control valve, PCV-522.

Continuing with the discussion of the off-gas line from the fuel
pump bowl, line 522, a 1/4-in. sched 40 pipe leads from PCV-522 in the
instrument box through the underground valve box to the hold-up U-tubes

leaves the holdup volume via line 556, a 1/2-in. pipe connection to the
distributing header for the main charcoal beds, line 5%0.

Lines 620, 621, 622 and 623, each containing a hand valve, lead
from the off-gas distributing header to each of the four sections of the
main charcoal bed. Bach of the four sections contains about 22 £3 of

activated charcoal. Any two of the four sections are capable of handling

the continuous off-gas flow of ~ 4.25 liters/min. The header, line 550,
also has a capped-tee connection for the possible future addition of a
helium recycle plant.

The gas discharge lines from the four sections of the charcoal bed,
lines 624, 625, 626 and 627, each contain a hand valve in a valve box
adjacent to the charcoal bed cell and has an extension to bring the handle
to grade level. The four lines join to form line 557, which has a tem-
porary vacuum connection, valve V-577-A, a check valve, CV-557-A, a hand
block valve, V-577-B, and a radiation monitor, RIA-557. On indication of
an abnormal level of activity this monitor would cause closure of the block
valve, HCV-557-C. The off-gas line from the auxiliary charcoal bed, line
562, and the vent from the cooling salt drain tank and the lubricating cil
storage tanks, line 560, connects to line 557 upstream of the radiation
monitor.

The off-gas vented from the fuel drain tanks and the flush salt tank
flows through lines 573, 575 and 577, respectively, to form line 561 lead-
ing to the off-gas system. Each of these three lines contains a control
valve, as shown on the fuel drain tank system flowsheet, Fig. 6.1. Line
561 is contained within a 1l-in. pipe in its route from the drain tank cell,
through the reactor cell and coolant drain cell, to the instrument box in
the vent house. It continues as a 1/2-in. line from this box to the valve
pit and then to the auxiliary charcoal bed in the charcoal bed cell.

During initial filling of the fuel system with salt it will be
necessary to vent a relatively large volume of cover gas from the system
at flow rates of up to about 1 cfm (STP). This can be accomplished through
line 533, which connects the fuel pump bowl vent, line 522, with the con-
nection to the auxiliary charcoal bed, line 561. This 1/2-in. cross con-
nection contains a check valve to prevent back flow, CV-533, and a control
valve, HCV-533.

The gas vented from the sampler-enricher through line 542 is shown on
the fuel system process flowsheet, Fig. 5.3. This 1/2-in. pipe joins line
561 inside the reactor cell and is vented through the auxiliary charcoal
bed along with the gases from the drain tanks, etc.

The 1-1/2-in. cell evacuation connection, line 565, leading from the

discharge of the blowers in the special equipment room to the vent house,

 
 

366

filter pit and stack, is cross connected through line 571 to line 561.
(Line 565 will be described subsequently.) This connection, which con-
tains a check valve, CV-571, and a hand valve V-571, allows the reactor
cell to be evacuated through the auxiliary charcoal bed if there has been
a release of activity within the cell.

The 1/2-in. effluent from the auxiliary charcoal bed flows through
line 562, which joins line 557 and 565 in the vent house upstream of the
radiation monitor and block valve, for discharge through the filters and
up the stack. Before making the juncture, line 562 contains a hand valve
in the valve pit at the charcoal bed cell, V-562-A, a check valve in the
vent house, CV-562, followed by another hand valve V-562-C. Upstream of
the check valve, a valved connection, V-562-B, is provided as a temporary
vacuum connection.

The coolant drain tank, CDT, is vented to the off-gas system through
line 527, and then through line 547 and control valve HCV-547, to join
line 560. These lines, and those described in the next two paragraphs,
are shown on the coolant system flowsheet, Fig. 8.1.

The coolant salt circulating pump, CP, has its bowl vented through
line 528. This 1/2-in. pipe is provided with a porous filter ahead of
the control valve, PCV-528. This control valve has a maximum capacity of
0.623 liters/min. It is followed downstream by a check valve, CV-528

(located in the vent house), and a radiation monitor, RIA-528. The check

valve prevents backflow from line 560. The monitor provides an early warn-

ing in event the coolant salt circulating system becomes contaminated
through a leak in the main heat exchanger. It also indicates whether a
radiation alarm by the monitor on line 557 1s attributable to such a heat
exchanger leak or to contaminants from other potential sources which flow
past this monitor.

The gas space of the coolant salt drain tank and the vapor space in

 

the coolant salt circulating pump bowl have the pressure equalized by being
interconnected through line 536 and HCV-536, which joins the above-mentioned
drain tank vent, lines 527 and 547, with the pump bowl vent, line 528. The
connection to line 528 is upstream of the filter in order to bypass it and

the control valve, PCV-528, when the system is being filled with salt. An

a

367

additional 1/2-in. cross connection is made between these two lines through
line 527 and HCV-527, to permit the rapid exchange of cover gas for quick
drainage of the coolant salt from the circulating system.

Line 534 from the vapor space of the coolant circulating pump oil
supply tank, OT-2, is shown on the oil system flowsheet, Fig. 5.25. (ORNL
D-AA-A-40885) This line contains a hand valve, V-534-A, and a pressure
control valve, PCV-510-A2. This control valve is set to open at a slightly
higher pressure than the normal operating pressure in the tank (~ 10 psig),
and thus serves to protect the tank from a pressure buildup due to a leaky
cover-gas supply valve, PCV-510-Al. The control valve is followed by a
check valve, CV-53%4, a hand valve, V-534-B, and two capped sample taps.
These taps can be used to check for leakage through the check valve. The
hand valves on each side of the control and check valves permit isolation
for maintenance purposes. The vented gas from the fuel circulating pump
0il supply tank, 0T-1, is similarly equipped, as shown on the same flow-
sheet, and joins line 534 downstream of the valve, V-534-B, for routing
across the coolant cell to combine with the aforementioned line 527.

In summary, line 560 vents off-gas from the coolant drain tank, the
coolant pump bowl, the coolant pump oil catch tank, and the fuel and coolant
pump lubricating oil supply tanks. The vented gas flows past a radiation
monitor-controlled block valve, HCV-557-C, to the filter pit for subsequent
dilution and discharge up the off-gas stack.

A portion of the gas discharged by the component cooling system
blowers, described in Section 16, is diverted through line 565 to the off-

gas system to maintain the reactor and drain tank cells below atmospheric

pressure. “(The point where line 565 branches from line 917 is shown on the

fuel system flowsheet, Fig. 5. 3. The remainder of line 565 is shown on the

off-gas system flowsheet, Fig. 12.2.) Line 565 passes from the special

equipment room “through the ‘coolant drain cell to the vent house, where it

contains a radiation monitor, RIA-565. A 3/4-in. branch connection down-
stream of the monitor, line 566, permits returning 20 to 100 cfm (STP) of
the gas back to the component cooling system via lines 922 and 930. Line
566 contains a check valve, CV-566, to prevent backflow, and a hand valve,
V-566. The remainder of the cell atmosphere gas (5% 0,, 95% N,) flows
through a control block valve, which receives its signal from the radiation

monitor.

 
 

 

368

The reactor cell can be evacuated intermittently at ~ 100 cfm (STP)
through valve V-565-C and check valve CV-565, or by a continuous small
flow of about 1 liter/min through a bypass around V-565, line 569. This
1/4-in. bypass line contains a ceramic filter, two hand valves, V-569-A
V-569-B, a check valve CV-569, and a wet test meter to measure flow,
FqI-569. Sample taps on line 565 and on line 569, with valves V-565-B
and V-569-C, respectively, allow installation of a sample bomb between
the two points. The aforementioned line 557 connects to line 565 in

the vent house before it continues to the filter pit.
12.3 Holdup Volumes

The highly radiocactive gas from the fuel circulating pump bowl is
held up for about 1-1/2 hrs to allow the short-lived fission-product
isotopes to decay and thereby reduce the heat generated in the charcoal
bed.

Based on an average off-gas temperature inside the reactor cell
piping of 500°F, a specific activity in the gas of 0.15 watts/cc, an
ambient cell temperature of 150°F, and an average temperature of 100°F
for the gas in the charcoal bed holdup volume, the total holdup volume

3

requirement was estimated to be about 13 ft-. The minimum holdup time
is one nour . #8 At design flow rates, 13 £3 of holdup volume provides
1-1/2 hrs of residence time.

About 6 £t3 of the holdup volume is provided inside the reactor cell
upstream of the pressure control valve PCV-522. This volume not only
allows for the decay of fission-product gases and dissipation of heat to
the cell atmosphere gas, but acts as a surge volume to provide for better
action of the pressure control valve. 48 The holdup volume consists of
68 ft of 4 in., 304 stainless steel, sched 40 pipe. The 4 in. pipe circles
the cell wall counter clockwise at the 831-1/2 ft elevation until reaching
the north side of the cell where it doubles back in a flat "S" bend,
dropping it to the 829-1/2 ft elevation. The pipe continues downstream
at this elevation and bends up to terminate at a pipe reducer where the
line size again becomes 1/2 in. to leave the reactor cell through the wall

penetration. On the other side of the wall the line continues as 1/4-in.

bs
369

sched 40 pipe contained within 3/k-in. sched 40 pipe. The 3/4-in. pipe
is sealed at the cell wall but open to the instrument box in the vent
house.

Additional holdup volume is provided in the charcoal bed cell in the
form of six 19.8-ft lengths of 3-in. sched 10, 304 stainless steel, pipe
connected in three vertical U-tube configurations, with 180° bends at the
bottom and each leg capped at the top. The U-tubes are connected in series
by 1/2-in. piping to give a total volume of about 7 £63. (See ORNL Dwg.
E-JJ-A-41519) The U-tubes are immersed in water for cooling, as is the

other equipment in the charcoal bed cell.
12.4 Off-Gas Charcoal Beds

12.4.1 Main Charcoal Beds

The radioactive fission-product gases in the off-gas stream have an
average residence time on the activated charcoal of about 90 days for the
xenon and 7-1/2 days for the krypton.

The charcoal beds were designed on the basis of a 10-Mw reactor power
level, assumption of 50-gpm complete removal of fission-product gases
from fuel salt in the pump bowl and a 2.5 £3
bowl at 1200°F. The maximum rate of helium purge gas flow was taken as

6,000 liters/24t hrs (STP). The minimum holdup time for the xenon was

of gas space in the pump

fixed at 90 days and the corresponding time for the krypton as 7-1/2 days.
The maximum allowable charcoal bed temperature was assumed to be 250°F and

148

the maximum cooling water temperature as about 85°F. Flow rates to the

149

charcoal bed were calculated by the method of Stevenson, using nuclear

data from Blomeke and Toad . TP Data sheets were prepared using an exist-

ing TBM TO90 program. >-

There are two charcoal beds connected in parallel, and each is
capable of handling the full off-gas load of the MSRE. Each bed con-
sists of two vertical sections containing, first, 80 ft of 1/2-in.
sched 10 pipe, 80 ft of 3-in. sched 10 pipe, and then 80 ft of 6-in.
sched 10 pipe. The smaller pipe sizes are used on the inlet end to pro-
vide more surface-to-volume ratio for the dissipation of heat to the sur-
rounding water. The effect of the pipe size on the bed temperature in
the first section is shown in Fig. 12.6. The overall height of the
vertical sections is about 20 ft. (See ORNL Dwg E-JJ-B-41519 through
41524) All piping is 304 stainless steel and the system is of all-
welded construction with each joint X-rayed after fabrication.

~ The total volume of each bed (two sections) is Lk 3, requiring
about 1,455 1bs of charcoal for filling.* The charcoal is Pittsburg
Type PGB 6 x 16, a type that has proven satisfactory in static and
5

dynamic absorption tests. Each section has a maximum flow rate of
2.1 liters/min. The centerline temperatures calculated for several flow
rates are shown in Fig. 12.4. The temperatures are measured by a thermo-
couple at the inlet of each different pipe size in each section. The

maximum pressure drop is estimated to be 1.5 psi.
12.4.2 Auxiliary Charcoal Bed

Since the auxiliary charcoal bed is used intermittently, there is
enough time between periods of use for fission-products to decay to
levels where a breakthrough of activity from the bed is highly im-
probable, +8 Further, the specific activity of the gas passing through
the bed is low enough to make heat release in the bed only a minor
consideration.

The auxiliary bed is designed to contain 140 ft

The bed consists of two vertical U-tube sections of 6-in. sched 10,
30k stainless steel pipe. The legs are about 19.21 ft long connected
by short-radius 180° bends at the bottom and with 1/2-in. pipe connect-

ing the capped tops in series. The total amount of charcoal in both

12.5 Piping, Valves and Filters

12.5.1 Piping

All piping inside the reactor and drain tank cells is seamless 304
stainless steel, sched 40. In most cases this pipe wall thickness was
not governed by internal pressure considerations but was selected to pro-
vide resistance to mechanical damage during installation and maintenance
of the reactor. The piping outside the containment areas is sched LO
carbon steel. Fittings used with the stainless steel piping are butt-
welded. Some valves, however, are socket-welded, or flanged, as may be
noted in the off-gas system valve tabulations, Tables 12.3, 12.4, and
12.5. The carbon steel piping is either screwed or welded, depending
upon the accessibility for inspection and maintenance and upon the
seriousness of the situation developing from a possible leak.

The main off-gas pipe, line 522, and the auxiliary off-gas pipe,
line 561, are each contained within another pipe in the run between the
containment vessel wall and the valve box in the vent house. Both inner
and outer pipes are seamless 304 stainless steel, sched 40, and all
joints are butt-welded and X-ray inspected. The annular space is pres-
sure-tight, sealed at the reactor cell wall and open to the instrument
box atmosphere. The slight vacuum in the box produced by the suction
of the stack fans provides assurance that any out-leakage of radioactive
gases will be carried to the filters and the off-gas stack. The monitors
on the lines leading to the filters would detect any radioactivity

escaping through such leaks.
12.5.2 Valves

The sir-operated valves in the off-gas system are of the flanged

type. All others inside the containment vessel were welded into the

 
 

37

piping either by butt or socket-type welds. The valves in the off-gas
system are listed in Tables 12.3, 12.4, and 12.5.

Hand valves in piping which must be shielded, such as those in the
underground valve box at the charcoal bed cell, have special extension

handles, as shown on ORNL Dwg D-JJ-A-56255.
12.5.3 Filters

12.5.3.1 Porous Metal Filter in Line 522. - A filter is provided
in line 522 upstream of the control valve, PCV-522, to protect it from
possible damage or plugging. The filter housing is a section of 1-1/2-in.
304 stainless steel pipe about 20 in. long with a cap welded on the bottom
and a ring-joint flange at the top, as shown in Fig. 12.7. The filter
element is a fluted porous metal cylinder 1-1/32-in. diem x 17-in. long.
The pore diameter is 40 microns and the surface area is about 6 in.2/in.
of length. The filter element is screwed to a 1/2-in. coupling welded
to the 1-1/2-in. x 1/2-in. reducing flange which effects the top closure.
The 1/2-in. inlet pipe, line 522, enters the side of the filter housing.
The 1/2-in. outlet pipe connects the top flange to the control valve
HCV-522. The pressure loss due to flow through the filter is negligible

at the maximum design flow rate of 4.2 liters/min.

12.5.3.2 Porous Metal Filters in Lines 524, 526, 528 and 569. - The
filters in lines 524 and 526 are upstream of capillary flow restrictors
to provide protection against plugging. The filter in line 528 is up-
stream of the control valve, HCV-528. Line 569 leads to a sampling
station and the filter is installed upstream of the sampling valve,
V-569:=D. The four filters are Nupro Filters, Type F, No. SS-P4-60, with
modified 30,000-psi Autoclave connections. The body of each filter is
3/4-in. diam x 3 in. long (before modification) and contains a porous
metal thimble with a surface area of 1.386 in? The nominal pore diameter
is 60 microns. The body has a threaded closure with a metal O-ring seal.
The units are constructed of 316 stainless steel. The pressure loss due

to flow at design conditions of 1 liter/min is negligible.

13. CONTAINMENT VENTILATION SYSTEM

The containment ventilation system provides a continuous and con-
trolled flow of air through all areas where radioactive or beryllium
contaminstion is likely to occur. Such areas include the high-bey ares,
the reactor and drain tank cells (during maintenance), the six smaller
special-purpose cells, the electric service areas, trensmitter room,
service tunnel, special equipment room, coolant cell, vent house, and
charcogl bed cell.

The generel pattern of the air flow is from the less hazardous to
the potentially more hazardous arees and then to exhaust ducts where it
is passed through ebsolute filters and monitored for radioactivity before
release. In & broad sense, the air flow is from the north end of Build-
ing T7503 toward the exhaust stack at the south end.

The ventilated areas are operated at less than atmospheric pressure
to assure that leakage of eir is inward. With but few exceptions, such
as in the change room, the concern is for maintaining this negative
pressure rather than for ventilating at en established flow rate. To ac-
complish this, particularly when the ventilation rate must be increased
to certain areas during sbnormsl or maintenance conditions, it may be
necessary to sharply decrease the air flow into certain other areas.

13.1 Iayout and General Description

The containment ventilation system utilizes either of two 21,000-cfm
(nominal cepacity) centrifugel fens located at the base of the 100-ft-
high stack to induce air flow through the various containment areas in
and adjacent to Building 7503. The estimated rates of air removel from
these areas during normal reactor operation are shown in Table 13.1.

As shown in the simplified air flow diegram, Fig. 13.1, the bulk of
the air (14,000 to 17,000 cfm) enters the main building at the northwest
corner through en inlet air filter house. In addition to dust filters ’

this house contains steam-heated coils for warming the intake gir during:

the winter months. A bypass damper in the house wall assures an air
supply even though the filters become excessively clogged. Another
counter-balanced bypass damper prevents the differential pressure between

the atmosphere and the high-bay area from becoming high enough to collapse
the sheet-metal liner. The air enters the high bay between columns 2 and
3 at the 87h4-ft elevation. About 1000 cfm of air is also drawn into the
high-bay area through the change, or locker, room located at the same
level.

Exhaust ducts leading to the main intake ducts for the stack fans
withdraw air from each of the six small cells located beneath the oper-
ating floor level, ™ causing air to be drawn from the high-bay area down
through the openings between the concrete roof blocks covering these
cells. The ventilation rate for each cell varies from 200 to 1500 cfm,
depending on the exhaust-duct damper settings. A blower on the exhaust
from the liquid-waste storage tank maintains it at a lower pressure than
that of the cell. Another exhaust duct pulls 400 to 600 cfm of air from
the electric service area transmitter room, west tunnel, etc., the air
having reached these rooms from the high-bay area through various stair-
ways, passages, etc. The bulk of the air from the high-bay area (12,000
to 15,000 cfm) is normally exhausted at the operating floor level through
two openings that flank the sampler-enricher station area. A hood above
the samplers also provides ventilation during sampling.

The coolant cell is maintained at a lower pressure than the high-bay
area. Air is exhausted from the cell through an opening in the south wall
at about the 861-ft elevation. Air also enters the coolant cell through
general leakage, etc., from outside the building and is only partially
drawn from the high-bay area.

Air is also exhausted from the small vent house located at the south
end of the main building. Air enters the house through a filter in a
small opening in the wall and leaves through a small duct leading to the
main intake duct for the stack fans.

During maintenance operations in the reactor or drain tank cells,
air can be exhausted from the cells to cause a downflow of air through

the openings where concrete roof plugs have been removed. This positive

downward movement of 100 fpm, or more, materially aids in preventing es-
cape of sirborne contaminants into occupied building areas. To accomplish
this circulation, 15,000 cfm of air is withdrewn through a 30-in.-diem,
shadow-shielded opening et the bottom of the southwestern sector of the
regctor-cell containment vessel. The air then flows through a 30-in.-
diem carbon steel duct across the coolent drgin cell and through the
special equipment room to a valve station in the service tunnel containing
two 30~-in.-~diam motor-operated butterfly valves in series. The valves are
closed during reactor operation end are opened only when roof plugs have
been removed for maintenance end cell ventilation is required. (A 12-in.
sched-40 pipe tekes off the 30-in.-diam duct upstream from the butterfly
valves and leads to the reactor containment vessel vapor-pressure suppres-
sion system, as described in Section 17.) The 30-in.-diem duct continues
underground to the vicinity of the filter pit, where it turns to join the
main 36-in.-diem duct leeding to the pit.

The two motor-driven fans and the 100-ft steel stack for discharge
of the air are located gbout 110 ft south of Building 7503. (0ff-gas from
the charcoal edsorber beds is also vented through the filter pit and stack,
see Section 12.) |

The containment ventilation system 1s provided with numerous manually
positioned dampers to adjust the air flow. Differential-pressure cells
indicate direction of air flow, filter resistances, ete. In general, all
components in the system are commercially availeble.

The general layout of the containment ventilating system and key to

house is counter-weighted to open if the negative pressure exceeds 0.35
in. of E0, and assures an air supply in event the filters become ex-
cessively dirty. After passing over a steam~-heated extended-surface
heating coil, the air 1s delivered to the high-bay ares of the main
building through a LO x 60-in. insulated duct, line 953. A manually
set damper located in this line just above the filter house permits ad-
Jjustment of the negative pressure in the high-bay area to 0.1 to 0.3 in.
of H,0. A counter-weighted damper in the 30 x L4B8-in. bypass duct, line -
954, opens at a negative pressure of 0.45.in. of H,0 to. protect the high-
bay liner from excessively low pressures. Air is also drawn into the
high-bay area through the chenge room at an estimated rate of about

1000 cfm.

10 balance the air flow and differential-pressure cells to indicate the
cell pressure. The estimated ventilation rate for most cells is about
200 cfm during normal operation. An individual cell may have a venti-
lation rate as high as 1500 cfm during maintenance in that cell. Air
finds its way into these six cells from the high-bay area through the
openings between the concrete blocks covering the cells.

Line 94h exhausts air from both the liquid-waste cell and the re- -
mote maintenance cell. Gases vented from the waste storage tank in the
liquid-waste cell are exhausted through a 6-in. pipe, line 948, to a
blower in the edjoining remote maintenance pump cell; this location for
the blower makes it more accessible for maintenasnce. The energy input
of the 180 cfm blower is sufficient only to overcome the pressure loss
due to flow in the 6-in. pipe end permit discharge directly into the ex-
heust duct, line gLs5, without backflow into the remote maintenance cell.

Air in this cell, which is open to the high-bay area a major portion of

the time, is exhausted through line 945, It is to be noted thet the gases

vented from the waste storage tank may at times be redioactive, such as o
when the caustic scrubber in the fuel reprocessing system is vented, or

possibly when the air-operated (.,26 cfm) jet pumps are used to remove
water from the drein tenk cell and reactor containment-vessel sumps.
The control system interlocks would cause the waste blower to stop on
& loss of flow to the stack fans.

The inleakage through the seals in the sealed high-bay area is
estimated to be less than 1000 cfm.

Air from the south electric service ares is exhausted through a
12 x 12-in. duct, line 937, &t & rate of about 600 cfm. Some of this
air is drewn in through the transmitter room end from outside, but most
of the flow is from the 8L0-ft level to the north electric service area
end then to the south electric service area. A packaged air conditioner
removes heat from the transmitter room in e closed air circuleticn cycle.

The six 12 x 12-in. ducts described above have manual dempers at the
853-ft elevation on the east wall of the high-bay area. They then combine
in e manifold to form a 20 x 20-in. duct, line 936, then to a 26-in. duct,
line 928, which runs south at the 873-ft elevation sbove the roof of the
office erea.

The bulk of the air is drawn from the high-bey area through sn in-
teke opening located at the southeast corner. About 15,000 cfm is re-
moved through the 33~in.-diem duct, line 935. Two openings are pro-
vided for exhausting air into this line, A 9-in. side connection draws
eilr from the exhaust hood at the sampler-enricher station. After the
26-in.-diem duct, line 928, and the 33-in.-diem duct, line 935, join
above the roof of the office areas, the duct size becomes 36 in. in dia-
meter and continues es line 927 above ground to the entrance of the
filter pit. A motorized damper, HCV-935, permits regulation of the
total air flow.

~ Mr is exheusted from the coolant cell through a 16 x 16-in. duct,

line 934, with the intake opening at the 855-ft elevation. This duct
contains & motor-operated demper at the 862-ft elevation. Another 16 x
16-in. duct, line 933, exhausts air from the coolant cell at the 862-ft
elevation. Either one, or both, can be used for venting the coolant cell.
During maintenance the flow rate may be ebout 1500 cfm. The nearby vent
house is ventilated by drawing about 250 cfm through a filter in the wall
of the vent house and exhausting it through line 959. This ll-in.=-diam

 
 

 

390

duct connects to line 933 on the outside south wall of the main building.
A manually operated damper in line 959 permits adjustment of the air flow
to about 250 cfm.

The charcoal bed is ventilated by exhausting air through line 950.
Air from the instrument box, which contains the valving for the charcoal-
bed gas lines, is withdrawn through line 951. These two lines combine,
and as line 950, join the 18 x 18-in. duct, line 932. As mentioned
above, line 932 joins the main duct leading to the filter pit, line 927.

The reactor and drain tank cells normally operate at about 2.0 psi.
below atmospheric pressure and with an atmosphere of about 95% N, and 5%
0,. During maintenance operations, when concrete roof plugs are removed,
the two butterfly valves are opened in line 930, to exhaust the cells and
pull air from the high-bay area down through the opening. For openings
of 150 £42, end smaller, the downward velocity will exceed 100 fpm. Under
most maintenance circumstances, the openings will be small and the bulk
of the air leaving the high-bay containment area will continue to be with
drawn through line 935 at the southwest corner of the building.

Two 30-in. butterfly valves are provided in line 930 rather than one
to permit periodic testing for leak tightness of the valves. The space
between the two valves may be pressurized with air through valve 930-C.
The shaft seal can also be pressurized to test for leaks. A 2-in. bypass,
line 955, is provided around the two butterfly valves to accommodete low
flow rates. The space between the two valves in this line may also be
pressurized with air through valve 955-C to check for leakage.

The gas supply for the component cooling system blowers is taken
from line 930 just upstream of the butterfly valves through the 10-in.-
diam line 522 (see Section 16).

The 12-in. pipe shown on the flowsheet as leaving line 930 upstream
of the two butterfly valves leads to the reactor cell vapor-condensing
system. This arrangement for emergency condensing of water vapor that
might be generated in the cell in a major failure of equipment is de-
scribed in Section 17.

A 12-in. ventilation pipe, line 931, from the service tunnel ares
Joins the 30-in. pipe, line 930, just downstream of the two butterfly
valves. This pipe exhsusts air from the western end of the tunnel to

 
-

 

391

promote a positive flow of air toward that end. A 6-in. continuation of
line 931, numbered 958 , exhausts alr from the special equipment room.
Both of these lines contain manually operated dampers. The 30-in,~diam
line 930 joins the main duct, line 927, above ground near the entrance
to the filter pit.

The filter pit is arranged in three sections, each section having
a prefilter followed by an absolute filter. The efficiency of the latter
is 99.97% for particles greater than 3 p in size. Manually operated
dempers are provided at the inlet and outlet of each section. Each of
the six groups of filters is provided with differentisl pressure sensors
to indicate the condition of the filters. Normally, all three sections
are operated in parallel.

The two stack fans are ducted in parallel through lines 925 and 926,
s0 that either may be used to exhaust the containment enclosures. Stack
fan No. 1 will operate continuously, with the No. 2 fan in standby con-
dition. Both manually operated dampers in the fan suctions will remain
open. The air-operated damper in the No. 1 fan discharge, FCD-925, will
normally be open and that in the No, 2 fan discharge, FCD-926, will be
closed. If the pressure increases upstream of the filters, as indicated
by PI-927, the No. 2 fan will start, the No. 1 fan will stop, end the
air-operated dampers will reverse position. This arrangement prevents
backflow through the fan not in use.

The stack is equippped with a pitot tube, FI-S1l, to indicate the
flow and to transmit this information to the data logger. A radiation
monitor, RIA-S1, is installed in the stack. Rain water accumlating in
the steck is drained to the waste sump in the main building through a
2-in., stainless steel pipe.

135.3 Description of Equipment

13.3.1 Inlet-Air Filter House

13.3.1.1 House. The inlet- (or supply) air filter house serves
as an enclosure for the dust filters and tempering colls for the enter-
ing air. The structure is 13 ft wide, 21 ft long, and 10 ft high; it
has a concrete floor at en elevation of about 840 ft and is located

 
 

 

392

outside the northwest corner of the main building. The walls and roof
are lh-gage corrugated steel siding welded to a channel and angle-iron
supporting structure. A portion of the interior walls and roof is in-
sulated with 1-1/2-in. of "Fiberglas" (type PF-617). The insulated
section extends a distance of about 8 ft from the eastern end and sur-
rounds the heating coil and the heated air plenum. Two steel doors are
provided for access (see ORNL drawing D-KK-D-41123).

15.3.1.2 Heating Coils. The air heating coils are of the one-row,
nonfreeze type, with welded steel heeders and with copper. tubes and
aluminum fins. Three units are used, each with a face area of about
12.7 £12, Steam is supplied from the X-10 area at 250 psig and reduced
to 60 psig at a l-1/h-in. reducing valve located in the supply-air filter
house. The combined capacity of the three units is sufficient to raise
16,000 cfm of air from 0°F to 85°F. The pressure drop across the coil
is about 0.06 in. of H,0. The coils were tested with steam at 100 psig
and with air at 400 psig. The coils were manufactured and tested in ac-
cordance with American Standards Specification DS-1R-17-78 and ORNL Speci-
fication X5-192, p. 7-5.

15.3.1.5 Air-Supply Filters. The filter medium is pleated 3/32-in.-
thick "Fiberglas" arranged in 24 x 28 x 8-3/h-in.-thick units (Americen
Air Filter type PL-24). The units are placed in three side-by-side,
vertical V's, each leg of a V being two units wide and three units high,
making a total of 36 units (see ORNL Specification XS-192, p. 6-2).

13.3.1.4 Louvers. Two steel louvers, each about 6 x 6 ft, with
bronze insect screen, admit air to the west end of the inlet-air house.
A 30 x 48-in. louver is located between the filters and the heating coil,
as will be discussed under Section 13.3.1.5, below,

15.3.1.5 Dampers and Ducts. A regulating damper is mounted in the
horizontal position just above the intake-air house roof in the 36 x 36-in.
duct leading to the high-bay area, line 953. This steel, multi-blade
damper is manually adjustable and can be locked in position (see ORNL
drawing D-KK-A-41069).

The damper in the side of the inlet-air house between the filters
and the heating coil is 29-5/8 x 47-5/8-in., is mounted vertically, has
16-gage steel blades, and has an adjustable counter-weight set to open

 
 

393

the damper at g negative gir pressure of 0.35 in. of H,0. A similar
damper, 29-5/8 x 47-5/8 in., horizontally mounted in the bypass duct,
line 954, at the roof of the intake air filter house is weighted to
open at a negative pressure of 0.45 in. of H,0 (see ORNL drawing
D-KK-A-141069).

The duct leading to the high-bay area is constructed of 20-gage
sheet metal, insulated with 1-1/2 in. "Fiberglas" weatherproofed board.

13.3.2 Liquid-Waste Tank Blower

The blower used to discharge geses from the top of the liquid-
waste tank into the containment ventilation exhaust system is located
in the remote maintenance pump cell. The blower is an ILG type P volume
blower, 6-in. line type, having a capacity of 180 cfm.

13.3.3 Vent House

Air is drawn into the vent house through & 24% x 2h-in. louvered
opening in the west wall, The filter instslled in this opening uses a
filter medium of "Fiberglas” and 1s en American Air Filter type PL-2k,
with 3/32-in.-thick type G "Airmat." It has a NBFU rating of Class I
and has a rated pressure drop at 1000 cfm of 0.028 in. of E,0 when clean,
The actual flow is estimated to be a maximum of sbout 250 cfm.

13.3.4 Filter Pit

The filters in the filter pit are divided into three cells, or

sections, and each section is provided with both roughing and absolute

filters.

13.3.4.1 Roughing Filters. The roughing, or pre-filters, are a
modified American Air Filter deep-bed, multiple-media, pocket type (see
ORNL drawing D-KK-A-41075). The filtering media are & layer of spun
glass 1/2 in. thick, made up of 3.25 micron fiber (No. 25 FG) and a

1/2-in.-thick layer of 1.25 micron fiber (No. 50 FG). The units are
27 x 27 x 36 in, deep. The capacity 1s not less than 1000 cfm at a

velocity of 20 fpm and an initial resistance of 0.6 in. of H,0. Seven
of the filter units are installed in a horizontal rack in each of the
three sections of the filter pit (see ORNL Specification XS-192, p. 6-3).

 
 

394

13.3.4.2 Absolute Filters. The absolute filters, which are down-
stream of the roughing filters in each of the three sections, are a
"Fiberglas" fire-resistant, high-efficiency type. 10? The filter units
are 24 x 2k x 11-1/2 in, deep, and are arranged vertically, two across
and three high, for a total of 24 £t2 of filter face area in each section.
The minimum efficiency is 99.97% for particles greater than 5 microns in
size (DOP test*) at the design flow rate of 1170 cfm each.’? The in=-
itial static pressure loss is 1.05 in. of H,0 at a face velocity of
280 fpm. Operation is limited to 250°F.

13.3.5 Stack Fans

Two centrifugal fans are installed outdoors at the base of the con~-
tainment ventilation system stack. One of the fans serves as a spare.

The fans are identical except for the direction of rotation, fan No. SF-1
being counterclockwise and No. SF-2 clockwise. Each is driven by a 50-hp,
Lho-v, 3-phase, 60-cycle, continuous-duty motor, through an adjustable
V-belt drive. The fan blades are the backward-curved, nonoverloading
type. The capacity of fan SF-1 was measured as 19,750 cfm at 9.2 in. of
H,0 and 1473 rpm. Fan SF-2 delivered 20,500 scfm at 10.1 in. of H,0 and
1584 rpm. The minimum specified static efficiency is 83% under rated con-
ditions of 21,500 scfm and 10 in. of H,0 negative pressure. The maximum
outlet velocity is 3800 fpm. The fan operating characteristics are shown
in Fig. 13.2.

The fans are arranged for horizontal, bottom discharge, and the low-
points of the scrolls are provided with a 1-1/2-in. drein line. The fans
and motors are weather-protected for outdoor installation (see ORNL Speci-
fication XS8-192, p. 6-4). The units were menufactured by the Fly Ash Ar-
restor Corporation and have the catalog designation 3938 515W.

13.3.6 Stack

The stack is a free-standing type, 100 ft high, 3 ft ID at the top
and 4 ft ID at the bottom, tapering to 3 ft ID about 25 ft above the con-
crete base (see Fig. 3.2 and ORNL drawing D-KK-D-141120). The carbon steel
Plate is ASTM A 283 grade C, 1/2 in. thick in the bottom tapered section
and 3/8 in. thick gbove. Rectangular openings are provided for the two

discharge ducts from the stack fans. Exterior ladder rungs are provided
to the top of the stack.

Four equally spaced 1/2-in. pipe couplings are installed about
40 ft above the base for pitot tube flow measurements. An opening is
also provided for insertion of a radiation monitor.

The octagonal reinforced concrete base is at a grade elevation of
850 ft and is 16 ft across the flats and 7 ft thick. The bottom of the
stack contains a 1ll-gage 304 stainless steel drain pan sloping toward a
center drain of 2-in. sched-U4O stainless steel pipe. This drain line
slopes to a soil pipe which drains to the building sump (see ORNL
Drawing D-KK-A-L41078).

13.4 Design Criteria

Design of the containment ventilation system was necessarily based
on certain assumptions and broad estimates: 1%

It was assumed that during normal operation of the reactor the con-
taimment vessel would be at a negative pressure of 2.0 psig. During main-
tenance operations the vessel pressure would be about 0.3 in. of H,0 be-
low atmospheric. The minimum downward velocity through an opening in the
cell roof would be 100 fpm. (For an air discharge rate of 15,000 cfm the
maximum allowable opening would thus be about 150 £t2.)

The maximum leakage in the cell system and exhaust duct was taken
to be 1% of the cell volume in each 24-hr period. Leakage through the
two 30-in. butterfly valves in line 930 was assumed to be 1/10% of the
cell volume per 24 hr.

The high-bay, storage cells, etc., were assumed to be maintained at
0.1 in. of H,0 below atmospheric with a maximum negative pressure of 0.5
in. of H,0. The maximum air leakage into the containment ventilation
system enclosures was taken to be 6 x 1072 cfm per cubic foot of volume,
or about 900 cfm, and the desirable air change rate not less than about
six per hour. All occupied adjacent areas were required to be at a
positive pressure with respect to the containment ventilation system

enclosures.

14. LIQUID WASTE SYSTEM

The primary function:of the MSRE liquid waste system is to collect
all waste water which is likely to be contaminated, store and treat it,
when necessary, and discharge it to the Central Pumping Station of the
Melton Valley Waste System. 2? The liquid waste system also includes a
cell and tank for decontaminating tools and reactor equipment. Filter-
ing equipment is provided to clarify the water used for shielding in
this cell to obtain better visibility of work being done underwater. A
sump, which normally handles non-contaminated general building drainage,

is also associated with the liquid waste system.
14.1 Iayout and General Description

The liquid waste system equipment is in the liquid waste cell, the
decontamination cell, the remote maintenance practice cell, and the sump
room. The three cells are beneath the operating floor level, as shown
in Figs. 4.3 and 4.5. The sump room is beneath the special equipment
room, and with a sump elevation of ~812 ft, is the point of lowest
elevation in Bldg. 7503.

14.1.1 Liquid Waste Cell

The liquid waste cell is 1h x 21 ft and 24 ft deep, with a floor
elevation of 828 ft (See Table 4.3). This auxiliary cell is located
between north-south columns 2 and 3, and east-west columns A and B, in
Fig. 4.4. The cell contains a 11,000-gal storage tank for waste water,
the waste filter, and associated piping and remotely operated valves.
Concrete shield blocks form the roof of the cell but there is no membrane
to make the enclosure pressure tight." The containment ventilation system
exhausts air from the cell to provide a down-draft through the small
openings between the roof plugs to contain airborne contaminants. (see

Section 13).

14.1.2 Decontamination Cell

 

The decontamination cell is located just south of, and adjacent to,

the liquid waste cell. The cell is 14 x 15 ft, about 20 ft deep, and

 

 
 

 

398

has a floor elevation of 832 ft-6in. The cell can be filled with water
for shielding larger radioactive items of equipment which require main-
tenance or ‘decontamination. The only equipment in the cell is the de-
contamination tank and simple piping and valves. The cell can be covered
with concrete roof plugs and ventilated in the same manner as the liquid

waste cell, but it may remain open most of the time.
14.1.3 Remote Maintenance Practice Cell

This cell is east of, and adjacent to, the liquid waste cell, see
Fig. b.h. It is 13 x 21 ft and 2k ft deep with a floor elevation of 828
ft. The cell is used to practice maintenance procedures before they are
carried out in the reactor cell. The cell is also used to house the waste
pump and associated valves which transfer liquid from the liquid waste
tank. The small 180-cfm blower which removes gases from the top of the
liquid waste tank is also located in the cell (See Section 13.3.2).

14.1.4 Sump Room

The sump room is an 8 x 16-ft x T-ft-high space with a floor elevation
of 820 ft. In the floor of the room is a 3 x 3 x 8-ft-deep sump, which is
the lowest point of elevation in the main building. The room is located
partially beneath the special equipment room between columns 8 and 9, and
C and B, in Fig. 4.k. Access to the sump room is by a 30-ft vertical ladder
through an opening in the floor of the southern end of the high-bay area.
Positive ventilation of the sump room is achieved by a blower in the room
which discharges up a small duct into the high-bay area. The sump room
contains a 55-gal stainless steel drum for collecting water which could
possibly be contaminated, and a centrifugal pump for transferring its
contents. The room is also provided with two pumps mounted in the sump

for pumping out uncontaminated water.
14.2 Flowsheet

The flowsheet for the liquid waste system is shown in Fig. 14.1
(ORNL Dwg D-AA-A-40888).

Eleven lines empty into the top of the 11,000-gal waste tank, as

The sumps in the reactor and drain tank cells are equipped with liquid
level indication through use of bubbler lines 965 and 966, respectively.
These 1/2-in. sched 40 stainless steel lines are supplied with nitrogen
for purging oxygen from the cells and contain rotameters of up to 0.31 1/min
capacity. The bubbler level indication is in addition to the level alarm
switches which are provided on all sumps.
The above-mentioned sumps in the reactor and drain tank cell are
emptied by ejectors actuated by service air. The 100-psig supply air is
passed through a pressure regulator, PCV-332, and distributed to the drain
tank cell through line 342 and to the reactor cell through line 332. Both
of these lines are 3/4-in, sched 40 stainless steel and have hand-operated
valves and check valves to prevent back flow from the cells. The reactor
cell jet discharges into line 333 and the drain tank cell jet into line o
"343, both of which are 3/4-in. sched 40 stainless steel pipe leading to the
liquid waste storage tank. Before entering the storage tank, each line is
provided with two flow-control valves in series, FCV-333-A, FCV-333-B and
FCV-343-A, FCV-343-B. These normally-closed, air-operated valves are inter-
locked to close on a sudden rise in reactor cell pressure. Lines 334 and
344 permit the application of a test pressure between the two flow-control
valves to check for leak tightness. The reactor and drain tank cells can
be depressurized for leak testing through the Jet discharge lines.

A sink in the change room, located east of the high bay, and part of
the controlled ventilation area, has a drain, line 340, leading to the Jd
waste storage tank. A funnel is provided in the high-bay area for the

addition of caustic to the liquid waste tank, through line 339. (The
liquid waste is made a basic solution before transfer to the Melton Valley
waste disposal system.)

The discharge of the waste pump, located in the remote maintenance
practice cell, may be directed into the waste storage tank through the
2-in. sched 40 stainless steel line 301. The waste pump discharge may
also be diverted to the waste filter located in the liquid waste cell
through the 2-in. pipe, line 302. The discharge of the waste filter is
through line 306 to be returned either to the decontamination cell or de-
contamination tank. Line 307, connecting the waste pump discharge to line
306, permits recirculation of water in the decontamination tank, or partial
by-~passing of the filter when recirculating the water; it also allows pro-
cess water to be added to the waste storage tank via lines 819, 306, 307
and 301.

The sump pump drawing liquid from the 55-gal contaminated storage drum,
referred to as the "pit pump" to distinguish it from the sump pumps also
located in the sump room, can discharge into the liquid waste tank through
a 2-in. pipe, line 326. The pressure relief valves in the treated water
system serving the reactor and drain tank cells discharge into the 1-1/%-
in. line 335, which joins the afore-mentioned line 326 for release into the
waste storage tank (See Section 15.10).

The waste tank is vented through the 6-in. sched 10 stainless steel
pipe, line 948, which leads to the remote maintenance practice cell, where
a small in-line blower of 180 cfm capacity is installed in the pipe to pro-
vide a positive movement of the gases into the containment ventilation ex-
haust system (See Section 13.3.2).

The only bottom connection on the waste storage tank is line 300, a
2-1/2-in. sched 40 stainless steel pipe leading to the suction of the waste
pump in the adjoining cell. The bottom of the decontamination tank in the
decontamination cell also drains into line 300, and the pump suction,
through a 2-1/2-in. pipe, line 304. The sump in the floor of the decon-
tamination cell can be pumped out by the waste pump through line 303, which
Joins the afore-mentioned line 304 inside the decontamination cell.

The waste pump discharges through line 305, a 2-in. sched 40 stain-

less steel pipe containing a pressure-measuring tap and sample point.

 
 

402

Downstream of valve 305-A, the pump discharge line continues as a 3-in.
cast iron pipe to the central pump station of the Melton Valley waste
system, which is located just west of the Bldg T7503 area.

The sump in the sump room receives general building drainage, as
listed in Table 14.1. This water will not normally be contaminated.

Two 1.5-hp T5-gpm float-controlled sump pumps remove the water and dis-
charge it through a 3-in. pipe, line 327, to a concrete catch basin. This
basin, about 2 x 3 ft and 6 ft deep, is located just west of the charcoal
bed and has a bottom elevation of 846 ft. It drains through a 150-ft-long
12-in. reinforced concrete pipe away from the site toward the natural
drainage leading to Melton Branch.

The overflow line from the charcoal bed cell empties into the above-
mentioned sump pump discharge, line 327 and thence to the catch basin.
Line 327 is provided with a check valve upstream of this connection to
prevent the overflow from moving backwards down the line into the sump.

It is possible for contamination to be present in the drainage from
the bottom of the filter pit and from the bottom of the containment
ventilation system exhaust stack. Each of the two 2-in. stainless steel
drain pipes from the filter pit has a sight indicator and a hand valve in
the concrete filter pit valve box located just east of the filter pit. The
two lines combine, as line 351, and join the 3-in. cast iron drain line
from the bottom of the stack, line 350, which in turn empties into the
55-gal stainless steel drum in the sump room.

The 5-hp pit pump can remove water from the drum through the 3-in.
suction, line 325, and discharge it via line 326 to the liquid waste
storage tank. If there is no objectionable contamination, the drainage
water can be pumped through line 330 and 331 to the above-mentioned catch
basin for release to the natural drainage from the site. Check valves in
both lines 326 and 330 prevent backflow into the sump from the pump dis-
charge lines.

Line 328 is a 3-in. cast iron pipe installed to drain water from the
charcoal bed cell. A similar arrangement is provided in line 329 to drain
water from the reactor containment vessel cell annulus. It is unlikely
that either of these spaces will be drained frequently. The two drain

lines combine in the sump room to join line 325 at the pit pump suction.

The water can thus be pumped out of the sump room by the pit pump to the
waste storage tank or to the natural drainage from the site. If necessary,
it could also be dumped into the sump room sump for removal by the sump
pumps. Check valves in both lines 328 and 329 prevent backing up in these
lines due to the difference in elevation. The reactor cell annulus is also
provided with an overflow pipe, line 331, which drains to the catch basin
outside. A check valve in line 330, from the pit pump discharge, which
Joins line 331, prevents the overflow water from moving backward through

the pump into the sump.

14.3 Description of Equipment

14.3.1 Liquid Waste Storage Tank

 

The waste storage tank is 11 ft diam and 16 ft high, giving a storage
capacity of about 11,000 gal. The tank is always vented to operate at es-
sentially atmospheric pressure. The tank has a flat bottom resting on the
concrete floor of the waste tank cell. The top is a dished head contain-
ing a 12 x 16-in. manhole, eleven flanged nozzles for inlet lines, and a
6-in. nozzle for the vent line. The discharge is a 2-1/2-in. dip pipe to
the bottom which penetrates the tank wall about 18 in. above the lower
circumferential weld. The tank is made of 1/L-in. 304 stainless steel
(See ORNL Dwg D-KK-B-41283).

14.3.2 Waste Filter

The waste filter is a Cochrane, Type A, vertical,pressure filter. The
tank is 3 ft 6 in. in diam and 48 in. high between the head welds, and has
dished top and bottom heads. The tank is rated at 100 psig, but is not a
Code vessel. The filter bed consists of a 34-in. depth of graded sand and
gravel having a cross sectional area of about 9.6 £2, Water enters through
8 2-in. pipe in the top head and is distributed uniformly by a concave
baffle. The underdrain is through a convex, slotted diffuser plate welded
to the bottom head. The capacity is 4 gpm/ £62, or a total of 38 gpm, with |
a maximum pressure drop due to flow through it of 5 to 10 psi. The filter

can be cleaned by back washing with process water, the normal back wash

405

requiring 5 to 15 min at a flow rate of 10 to 15 gpm/ £42, or a total of
96 to 14h gpm, at pressures of 20 to 25 psig.

14.3.3 Waste Pump

The waste pump is located in the remote maintenance practice cell.
It is a canned-motor unit, Chempump Type CH-5, and has a 2-in. suction, a
1-1/2-in. discharge, and a 6-1/2-in. impeller. It is rated at 150 psig
and will deliver 140 gpm ageinst a head of 80 ft. The motor is rated at
10 hp, and it is supplied with 3-phase, 60-cycle power from the 50-amp

circuit breaker No. 23 on the G-4 motor control center.

14.3.4 Sump Pumps

The two sump pumps in the sump room are rated at 75 gpm, with a dis-
charge head of 40 ft. The motors are rated at 1.5 hp. The power supply
is through moter control center G-3-3 and a 30-amp circuit breaker. The

pumps are controlled by float-operated switches.

14.3.5 Pit Pump

The pit pump in the sump room is a Peerless unit rated at 200 gpm at
a discharge head of 70 ft. It has a 3-in. suction and a 2-in. discharge.
The motor is rated at 5 hp. The electrical supply is through the motor
control center G-3-3 and the same 30-amp circuit breaker used for the sump

pump, described above.

14.3.6 Jet Pumps

The jets used to evacuate the sumps in the various cells are Penberthy
ejectors, Model XL96, Series 2A (Penberthy Manufacturing Company), having
capacities at various conditions as listed in Table 14.2. The sump jets
normally operate with a suction head of about 2 ft. and the caustic scrubber
jet has a suction head of about 12 ft. The jets in the reactor and drain
tank cells are air operated and those in the auxiliary cells are actuated

by steam.

agueous effluent from the MSRE which might be contaminated be collected
and stored, treated with caustic when necessary, and discharged to the
central pump station of the Melton Valley waste system, located just
west of the Bldg T7503 area.

Although not a direct part of the system, the liquid waste arrange-
ment also includes provisions for collection of certain non-radioactive
general building drainage and disposing it to the natural drainage from
the site. This general building drainage does not include storm water
or that from the sanitary system.

A requirement for operation of the decontamination cell is that the
shielding water be circulated through a filter to permit better visibility
for underwater operations.

The jet ejectors used to remove water from the sumps in the reactor
and drain tank cells are operated by dry air rather than by steam to avoid
the introduction of moisture into the cell. The jets removing water from
the sumps in the auxiliary cells are steam-actuated. The steam is con-

densed and easily retained.

15. COOLING WATER SYSTEM

15.1 layout and General Description

The MSRE cooling water facilities include the potable water,
process water, cooling tower, treated water and condensate systems.

The potable water system distributes water supplied from the
X-10 area of ORNL, as described in Section 3. This system provides
for fire protection, sanitary uses and drinking water. A portion of
this potable water, after passing through a back-flow preventer,
supplies the process water for cooling tower make-up, etc. The
potable water supply line is at the north end of Bldg. 7503 and
enters the building at the northeast corner.

The cooling tower water system is a circulating system in which
the water is cooled by a 2.75 x 10% Btu/hr forced-draft cooling tower
located southwest of the building, see plot plan, Figure 3.2. Either
of two outdoor 20-hr, 80-ft head, centrifugal pumps of 547 gpm capa-
city, circulates water from the tower basin to the treated water
cooler and other equipment listed in Table 15.1, Water from the
cooling tower is also used to cool the charcoal beds but this water
is discharged to drain and is not circulated.

The treated water system is a closed circulating system contain-

ing condensate with an added chemical inhibitor to minimize corrosion.

Water from this system is used for cooling equipment in which there
is a possibility of the water becoming contaminated. The equipment
cooled is listed in Table 15.2. The water is circulated by either

of two 20-hp, 136-ft-head, 320-gpm centrifugal pumps located in the
water room in the blower house at the southwest corner of Bldg. 7503.
The treated water passes through a shell-and-tube type heat exchanger
in the Diesel house to be cooled by the cooling tower water system.
The water is distributed by a header in the water room and metered to
the various items of equipment. The return lines discharge into a
common header leading to the pump suction. A surge tank is provided

for the expansion of the water in the closed system. This vented

tank has a float-operated valve for makeup from the condensate system
and has provisions for addition of corrosion inhibitors amounting to
2,000 ppm of potassium nitrate (754) and potassium borate (259).
Condensate is used for makeup in the treated water system and
for makeup to the boiling water decay heat removal system in the fuel
drain tanks. The condensate is provided by condensing steam supplied

from the X-10 area of ORNL. The shell-and-tube type condenser is

~ located in the water room and is stored in two nearby 500-gal tanks.

15.2 Flowsheet

The cooling water system flowsheet is shown in Figure 15.1
(ORNL-DWG-D-AA-A-40889) and includes the cooling tower, treated water
and condensate systems. The potable water supply is also shown in-
sofar as it is connected to the reactor processes, but does not in-
clude building services.

Appropriate flowmeters and indicators are provided at all points
in the system where water flow rates are needed for heat balance cal-
culations. In general, these are not mentioned in the following

discussion, as they are covered in detail in Part II.

15.2.1 Potable and Process Water

 

Two 6-in. carbon steel pipes supply Bldg. 7503 from the water
main at the road. One is a potable supply for general building use.
The other, line 894, supplies the reactor processes through a 4-in.
backflow preventer. The backflow preventer, BFP-890-1, has a relief
line discharging to a floor drain in the north end of the main build-
ing, and isolation valves V-894-Bl and V-890-Al, which can be closed
for maintenance. Additional valves, V-894-B2 and V-890-A2, are pro-
vided in event it is necessary to install an additional backflow
preventer for temporary use.

Water from the backflow preventer is distributed through 890, a
6-in, header.* A branch from the header, line 896, supplies process

water for general process use in the high bay area. Line 892 is s oO

 

Water taken from this potable water header is sometimes referred to IN
in this report and in the MSRE literature as process water. .

1-1/2-in. pipe for supplying water to the vapor condensing tank used
in the vapor condensing system for the reactor containment cell. The
liquid waste cell is supplied with potable water through the 2-in.
line 819. A backflow preventer in this line, BFP-819, is located in
the west side of the liquid waste cell, and prevents contamination of
the cooling tower water system by reverse flow.

Emergency cooling water is supplied to the two instrument air
compressors and the service air compressor located in the Diesel
house, through 2-in. line 872. These units are normally cooled by
the cooling-tower water system. The condensers in the fuel drain
tank decsy-heet removal system also have an emergency water supply
from the process water system through the 2-in. line 882, and three-
way valve HCV-882. The normal coolant for the condensers in the
drain tank system is cooling tower water. Line 890 continues as a
1-1/2-in. schd 40 pipe to provide makeup for the cooling tower basin
through the float-operated valve, LCV-890.

15.2.2 Cooling Tower Water System

Water from the cooling tower basin is supplied through a 6-in.
pipe, line 850 and 852, to the suction of the cooling tower water
circulating pumps. Pump No. 1 discharges through a check valve into
line 851 and Pump No. 2 into line 853. This water, at about 35 psig,
and a maximum temperature of 85°F, is distributed through the 6-in.
header, line 851. A major take-off, also numbered 851, is a 6-in.
pipe supplying about 260 gpm of cooling water to the shell-and-tube
cooler in the treated water system. This water circulates back to
the cooling tower through lines 854 and 856. A 1-1/4-in. pipe, line
'880, is connected to line 851 for the 36-gpm cooling water supply to
the instrument air and service air compressors, and associated after-
coolers, all located in the diesel house. The water 1s returned
through lines 881, 854 and 856.

The other major branch of line 851 is the 3-in. take-off, line
860, supplying a subheader, line 816. Lines 821 and 823, each 1-1/4
in. supply about 7.5 gpm from this header to the fuel and coolant
salt circulating pump lubricating oil system coolers located in the

   
 

413

service tunnel. This water returns to the cooling tower through lines
820 and 822 via lines 817 and 856. A 1-1/2-in. pipe, line 891, from
line 816 is used to fill the annulus around the reactor cell containment
vessel,

The caustic scrubber cooling jacket in the fuel processing cell
is supplied through line 842 and returned through line 843, A take-
off from the 3/4-in. line 842, the 1/2-in. line 839, supplies water
to the cooling jacket on the HF trap and HF cylinder in the area out-
side of Bldg 7503, just west of the drain tank cell. The cooling
water is returned through lines 843 and 849, via lines 817 and 856.
Line 816 also supplies water to the steam condenser in the water room,
previously mentioned as the source of water for the condensate system
to be described subsequently, through the 1-1/4-in. line 814. This
water is returned through line 815. Also as previously mentioned,
the drain tank heat removal system condensers are supplied with about
40 gpm each of cooling water through the 2-in. pipes 810 and 812, through
a three-way valve HCV-882. The return water lines from the condensers
are numbered 811 and 813.

The main cooling tower water return header, line 856, is a 6-in.
pipe leading to the top of the tower. A 3-in. subheader, line 817,
collects much of the water flowing into this main header. Line 856
divides to supply both sections of the cooling tower. .The water is
normally returned at a temperature no hotter than 95°F, and under
maximum ambient wet bulb temperature conditions of 79°F could be
cooled to 85°F (7°F approach). Since the commonly-used design wet
bulb temperature in the Oak Ridge area is 75°F, cooler water tempera-
tures can be attained, particularly during the winter months. A 4-in.
by-pass, line 858, leads through the control valve, TCV-858, to the
tower circulating-pump suction to regulate the pump discharge

temperature.
15.2.3 Treated Water System

Condensate from the storage tank in the water room is added to

the treated water system surge tank, located directly beneath it,

 
 

414

through line 825. This 1-in. pipe contains a float-operated control
valve, ICV-825, to maintain an operating level in the tank. The surge

tank is vented to atmosphere at all times. Potassium nitrite (759),
and potassium borate (259) are added through a funnel to inhibit cor-
rosion in the treated water system. The surge tank is connected to
line 827 by two pipes, one on each side of valve V-827-C. The down-
stream line is a direct connection to line 827 and the upstream one
contains a valve, V-827-D. This arrangement allows some of the flow
in line 827 to be diverted to flow through the surge tank for mixing
purposes and also assures that the surge tank is always connected

to the system.

The above-mentioned line 827 is a 4-in. header leading to the
suctions of the treated water circulating pumps. A duplex strainer
is included in the line upstream of the surge tank connections. The
pump discharge lines, 829 and 835, combine to form line 829. This 4-
in. pipe delivers the water at 100°F and 58 psig, and at a flow rate
of about 300 gpm, to the treated water filter located in the Diesel
house. The filter when clean has a pressure drop of less than 1 psi
and a maximum pressure drop of 5 psi, and removes essentially all
particles greater than 30 microns in diameter. After leaving the
filter the water enters the treated water cooler, where it is cooled
to about 90°F. It leaves the heat exchanger at about 43 psig through
the 4-in. sched 40 distribution header, line 826. The following
equipment is supplied from this header in the water room, each
connection being provided with a hand-operated regulating valve, a
flow indicator, stop valve, check valve, and a sampling valve
arrangement to test the leak tightness of the check valve:

(a). The thermal shield for the reactor is cooled by 60 gpm of
treated water supplied through a 2-1/2-1in. pipe, line 844, and re-
circulated to the system through line 845. A normally-open block
valve on the supply, FSV-844, is controlled by a pressure switch,
PSS-844B, on line 844 to limit the water supply pressure to about 16
psig. A flow-limiting orifice in line 844 also prevents over-
pressuring the thermal shield if the manual flow adjusting valve,

V-844A, is opened too wide. Line 844 contains a check valve upstream

 
 

FE)

 

415

of the orifice to prevent back flow. Rupture discs, rated at 18 psig,
in lines 844 and 845 discharge to line 855 leading to the vapor
condensing system.

(b) The fuel pump motor eooling water is taken from line 844,
described in (a) above, downstream of the block valve FSV-844. This
l-in. pipe, line 830, is provided with a check valve, located in the
blower house. The required flow rate is about 5 gpm and the water is
returned through line 831. This line, and the return water line from
the thermal shield, line 845, combine in the blower house to form line
847. This line contains a block valve, FSV-847, which is also
controlled by a radiation monitor, RE-827.

(c) The reactor cell air cooler (No. 1) is supplied with 60 gpm
of treated water through the 2-in. line 840. This line includes a
check valve located in the blower house. Water is returned from the
air cooler through line 846, through a block valve, FSV-846. A relief
valve set at 100 psig is included in the return line upstream of the
block valve to vent excessive pressure through the 1-1/4-in. line 335
to the waste tank.

(4) The other reactor cell air cooler (No. 2) is supplied with
60 gpm of treated water through line 838 in the same manner as the
cooler connections described in (ec), above. The return water is
through line 841.

(e) The coolant salt pump drive motor requires about 5 gpm of
cooling water, supplied through 1-in. line 832, and a check valve,
CV-832. The return water is through line 833 directly to line 827.

(£) The 60-gpm treated water supply to the drain tank cell air
cooler is through line 386, a 2-in. sched. 40 pipe with a check valve
located in the blower house. The return water pipe, line 837, is
equipped with a block valve, FSV-837, and a relief valve venting to
line 335, in a similar arrangement to the reactor cell air coolers.

(g) The nuclear instrument tube penetration is filled with
water from the treated water system. The water is supplied through
the 1/2-in. pipe, line 848. oo

 
 

416

(h) The aftercooler used downstream of the component cooling
system gas blowers, located in the special equipment room, is cooled
by 20 gpm of treated water supplied through the 1-1/4-in. line 873,
and returned through line 874. The oil coolers on the two blowers
are also water-cooled by about 10 gpm of water supplied through line
875. The water is recirculated through line 876, also l-in. pipe
size, which joins the above-mentioned water return line from the
aftercooler, line 874, before discharging into the return header,
line 827.

15.2.4 Condensate System

Saturated steam at 15 psig is condensed in a shell-and-tube heat
exchanger located in the water room at the southwest corner of Bldg
7503. The condenser is cooled by cooling tower water, as described
in Section 15.2.2. The condensate leaves through a 1/2-in. strainer
and steam trap on the stainless steel line 801, and discharges into
the vented condensate storage tank, No. 1 or to tank No. 2 through
the branch line 818. The drain from the bottom of tank No. 1, line
802, and from the bottom of tank No. 2, line 825, combine as the 1-
in. line 883, and is used to feed the float-operated make-up valve on
the treated water system surge tank.

Lines 802 and 803, both 1/2-in. stainless steel, also branch from
line 883 to supply makeup to the drain tank heat removal system water
tanks.

another project. It is a shell-and-tube type, four-pass, horizontal
heat exchanger, and is located in the west end of the Diesel house.

The shell is 28 in. OD x 20 ft long, not including the heads, and has
10-in. flanged nozzles. The 360 straight tubes are admiralty metal,
1 in. OD, No. 18 BWG, 20 ft long, spaced on 1-1/4-in. squares. The
tubes are supported by fixed tube sheets and baffle plates of naval
brass. The tube-side connections for the treated water are 8-in.
flanged nozzles.

The total heat transfer surface is 1,885 £t2, the shell-side water
velocity is about 0.48 ft/sec and the tube-side velocity 1.75 ft/sec,
providing an estimated overall heat transfer coefficient of 232 Btu/hr-
£t2.°F, 156 Operating design conditions are that the cooling tower
water enters the shell at 85°F and leaves at 97°F. The treated water
enters the tubes at 100°F and leaves at 90°F. 27

15.3.6 Treated Water Circulating Pumps

There are two identical treated water circulating pumps, one
operating and one for standby. Each is sized for 1204 of the 96-ft

158 and for a flow of

head of pressure drop estimated for the system
about 310 gpm. The units are Peerless centrifugal pumps, Model 2 x 3

the total capacity is about 1.2 gal/min.

15.3.9 Space Coolers

The five space coolers in the MSRE processing cells are designed
to maintain the cells at temperatures below of 150°F. There are two
units for the coolant cell, two in the reactor cell and one in the
drain tank cell.

15.3.9.1 Coolant Cell Coolers. - The two space coolers for the

 

coolant cell were existing units in Bldg 7503. They are external to
the cell, located at the 850-ft elevation, and connected to the cell
with short ducts. Each unit is mounted in a gas-tight, 1l2-gage sheet
metal casing, one on the northwest side of the cell and the other on
the southeast. The two return ducts to each unit are 12 x 19 in. and

15.3.9.2 Reactor and Drain Tank Cell Space Coolers. - The reactor
and drain tank cells are estimated to require the removal of a total of
about 500,000 Btu/hr to maintain the cell temperature below 150°F. Two
space coolers are used in the reactor cell and one in the drain tank
cell. The units are identical and are Young Radiator Company Model 55,
modified for direct drive and installed to facilitate maintenance using
remote ly-operated tooling. The water tubes and headers are backbrazed

to reduce the likelihood of water lesking into the cell. The treated

water supply and return lines are connected by ring-joint type flanges,
which are monitored for leakage.
Design data for the coolers are listed in Table 15.3.

15.3.10 Piping Valves and Appurtenances

15.3.10.1 Piping. - All water system piping -located outside the

containment cells is sched 40 black steel, ASTM A-53. Pipe and

fittings above 1-1/2-in. pipe size are butt-welded, and the fittings
are ASTM A234 Grade B. Smaller pipe and fittings are threaded; the

fittings are 150-psi black malleable iron. Condensate piping is 304
stainless steel with standard weight screwed fittings.

All water system piping inside the cells is 304 stainless steel,
sched 40, with butt-welded ends. Flanges are either 150-psi or 300
psi weld-neck, ring- joint flanges, depending on service and location.
All of these joints are leak-detected.

15.3.10.2 Valves. - Valves of 2-1/2-in. size and over have
flanged connections. The gate valves are 125-psi Ferrosteel wedge
valves with bronze trim and outside screw and yoke, -Crane No. 465-1/2.
The globe valves are Ferrosteel with Joke bonnet, bronze trim, Crane
No. 351. Bronze trim is also used in the 125-psi Ferrosteel swing
check valves, Crame No. 363. | |
Valves used in piping 2 in. and smaller have screwed ends. The
gate valves are 125-psl bronze valves with rising stems, Crane No.
430-UB. Globe valves are 150-psi bronze, Crane No. 14P. Except as
noted below, the check valves are 125-psi bronze, Crane No. 34.

The check valves in lines 836, 838, and 840, which supply treated

water to the reactor and drain tank cell space coolers, are Circle Seal

 
 

424

Model 230B-16 PP, 0.5 - 1 psi. The check valves in lines 830 and 832,
supplying treated water to the fuel and coolant salt pump motors, are
Circle Seal Model 230B-8 PP, 0.5 - 1 psi. These special check valves
prevent back flow if the block valves in these water supply lines are
closed by detection of radioactivity in the return water stream.
The pressure relief valves used in return water lines 837, 846,

841, 847, etc., are Farris Series 1475, 1/2-in. size, set at 100 psi.
The pressure relief valve in line 855 is identical but set at 20 psi
to protect the thermal shield from excessive pressure.

The air-operated control valves are described in Part II.

15.3.10.3 Backflow Preventers. - The potable water system is
protected from contamination due to reverse flow by a 4-in. backflow
preventer in line 890. The cooling tower system is also protected
from contamination from the liquid waste system by a similar, but 2-in.
pipe size, backflow preventer in line 819.

Both units are Beeco Model 6 C, reduced-pressure, backflow pre-
venters, as shown in Figure 15.4. The units operate on the principle
that two spring-loaded check valves, "A" and "B" in Figure 15.4, (with
8 psi springs) are in series with a spring-loaded diaphragm-operated
relief valve, "C", in between. The upstream pressure, "D", acts on
one side of the diaphragm and the intermediate pressure, "E", and a
4-psi spring, act on the other. If the supply pressure drops, or the
intermediate pressure increases in a condition tending to create
backflow, the diaphragm-operated relief valve opens to discharge the
water to drain. The 4-in. potable water valve, BFP-890-1, relieves
water to the building sump. The 2-in. valve in the liquid waste cell,
BFP-819, discharges the relief water to the waste tank. The capacities

of the two valves at various pressure heads are shown in Figure 15.5.

15.3.10.4 Strainer. - The suction line to the treated water
pumps is equipped with a 3-in. Schute and Koerting duplex strainer.
The unit consists of two 24-in. strainer baskets with a plug valve
to select the strainer in use. While one strainer is in service the
other can be removed for cleaning, The unit has a cast iron body with

brass strainer baskets.

15.3.11 Treated Water Filter

The filter in the treated water circulating pump discharge, line
829, is rated at 75 psig and 120°F to remove particles of 30 microns
in diam and greater from a flow of a minimum of 380 gpm. The maximum
pressure loss due to flow through the unit 18 15 psi. The inlet and
outlet connections are 6-in. pipe size, sched 40. A by-pass is incor-

- porated to allow cleaning of the unit without disrupting the flow of

treated water. The filter is manufactured by the Dollinger Corporation
(Rochester).

16. COMPONENT COOLING SYSTEMS

The upper portion of the fuel circulating pump bowl and the control
rod drives are cooled by streams of gas in order to avoid excessively
highly operating temperatures. The freeze valves, the seals at the reactor
access nozzle, etc., are cooled by gas to maintein the salt well below the
melting temperature to assure a frozen salt seal.

The component cooling equipment is arranged in two separate systems: ~
(1) & circulating gas loop for cooling equipment located in the reactor -
and drain tank cells, and (2), an air supply system for cooling freeze

valves in the coolant and fuel processing cells.

16.1 General Description and Layout

| AY

16.1.1 Circulating Gas System
Cell atmosphere gas (95% No, 5% 0,) is circulated by a T5-hp, 885-cfm
positive-displacement blower sealed in"a 6 ft diem x 8 ft steel tank
located in the special equipment room. (An identical blower unit is in
standby). The blower discharges through a vertical, 8-in.-diam x 9-ft
long, shell and tube, water-cooled heat exchanger, also located in the
special equipment room. The gas, now at about 150°F and 21.3 psie, flows
to a 6-in. distributing header in the reactor cell, where streams are -
taken from it to cool the equipment listed in Tsble 16.1.
The gas passes over the various surfaces to be cooled and then
mingles with the cell atmosphere. The 10-in. blower suction connection -
is made to the 30-in. diam containment ventilation system pipe, line 930,
vhere it passes through the special equipment room.
Each gas blower has sufficient capacity to also be used for evacuation
of the reactor and drain tank cells. In this operation, a portion of the
blower discharge is diverted to the containment ventilation system, to
be monitored and filtered before discharge from the stack. Due to cell
inleakage, or to various purge gas streams that may be introduced, a
periodic, or perhaps continuous, evacuation will be required to maintain
the cells at the desired 12.7 psia operating pressure.

In estimating the gas flow rates required, it was assumed that not
all freeze valves would require a high rate of cooling at the same time.
In general, no gas flow measurements will be made during operation of
the reactor, the flow rates simply being adjusted to maintain the equip-
ment at the proper operating temperatures.

16.1.2 Cooling Air Supply

Air for cooling the freeze velves in the coolant and fuel processing
cells is provided by a 5-hp positive-displacement type blower of 60 scfm
capacity, located in the blower house at the southwest corner of Bldg T7503.
Alr in the 3-in, discharge pipe is divided to cool the equipment listed in
Tsble 16.2. After blowing on the flattened sections of process piping
that serve as freeze valves, the air is then carried off by the cell
ventilation ducts.

16.2 Flowsheet

The flowsheet for the gas blowers and cooler located in the special
equipment room is included on the fuel system process flowsheet, Figure
5.3 (ORNL Dwg D-AA-A-40880). Other portions of the gas circulating
system are shown on other process flowsheets to be mentioned subsequently.

The cell atmosphere gas blower (95% No, 5% 0,), CCP-1, draws gas from
inside its 6-ft-diam x 8-ft high containment tank: A 10-in. sched 40
stainless steel pipe, line 923, connected to the bottom of the tank, joins
a similar suction line to the alternate blower, CCP-2, (line 922), and
as a 10-in. pipe connects the short distance to the 30-in. containment
ventilation pipe, line 930. The suction lines contain instrumentation
for temperature indication and each has a hand valve to permit switching
of service between the blowers. The normal opereting pressure in a
blower containment tank, i.e., the blower suction pressure, is 12.5 psia
and the gas enters at about 150°F. The T5-hp blower drive motor is cooled
by the gas flow through the tank.

The gas blower CCP-1 discharges at about 21.3 psia and 320°F through
a 6-in. sched 40 stainless steel pipe, line 916, which passes through the
bottom head of the containment tank. The portion inside the tank contains
a flexible connector, a pressure-relief valve connection, and a check valve

is located inside the tank and vents to it when the differential pressure
exceeds 12 psi. Lubricating oil from the blower sump is circulated by

& gear pump driven by the blower shaft, the oil flowing through a water-
cooled stainless steel heat exchanger and oil filter before returning

to the blower bearings. A pressure relief valve on the oil line 16 set
et a differential pressure of 12 psi to vent the oil to the blower sump
in event the heat exchanger or filter becomes clogged. The oll pressure
is monitored by & pressure transmitter located in the oll return line
from the filter.

The alternate ges blower, CCP-2, in an identical arrangement dis-
charges into the 6-in. line 921, which joins the above-mentioned dis-
charge line from blower CCP-1, before entering the gas cooler.

The compressed gas enters the shell side of the gas cooler at about
320°F and leaves at about 150°F. The tube side of the horizontsl shell-
and-tube heat exchanger is cooled by a flow of sbout 20 gpm of 90°F
treated water, supplied through line 873 and leaving through line 87k.

. The inlet and outlet gas lines have thermocouples to permit heat balances
+0 be made and an estimation of the gas flow rate. The gas leaves the
cooler through the 6-in. sched 40 steinless steel line 917.

A 1-1/2-in. sched 40 stainless steel pipe, line 565, branches from
line 917 inside the special equipment room, and leeds to the vent house.
As shown on the containment ventiletion system flowsheet, Figure 12.1,
(ORNL Dwg D-AA-A-40883), line 565 connects to line 5T1 in the vent house,
and continuing as line 565, is provided with two GM probes to monitor
for radioactivity, RIA-565, and a block valve HCV-565, actuated by the
monitor. A 1/2-in. by-pass line, 569, leads through a wet flow meter,
to a sempling point, and through a flow totalizer and indicator, FqI-569,
back into line 565. The hand valves in the by-pass line, 569, and in
line 565, are used to regulate the cell pressure. Line 565 discharges
into line 927 to pass through the roughing and sbsolute filters before
release from the ventilation system stack. This arrangement for venting
a portion of the blower discharge to the atmosphere is used to evacuate
gas from the reactor and drain tank cells to maintain them at the desired
operating pressure of about 12.7 psia. A hand valve in line 565 is used
t0 regulate the cell pressure.

Continuing with the compressed gas line 917, this 6-in. sched LO
pipe passes through a penetration into the reactor cell, there the
pipe material then becomes carbon steel, and serves as & header for the
seversl component cooling system gas supply lines listed in Table 16.1.
This teble lists the line sizes and flow rates in each of the eight
branches.

All eight of the gas supply lines, except line 920, contain air-
operated valves for controlling the gas flow.

Line 920 is a 2-in. sched 40 carbon steel pipe passing through the’
36-in.~-diem opening between the reactor and drain tank cells end then
through a penetration in the drain tank cell wall to supply & valve mani-
fold station located in the north electric service area. Here, through
six throttle valves, as shown in Figure 6.1 (ORNL D-AA-A-40882), lines
branch off to supply cooling gas to freeze valves in the drain tank cell
on lines 104, 105, and 106, 107, 108 and 109. (The freeze velves on lines
107, 108 and 109 are shown on the fuel processing flowsheet, Figure 6.2
(ORNL Dwg D-AA-A-4088T).

The air-operated valve in line 960, PACV-960, is controlled by a
differentiel-pressure cell connected between:lines 917 end 923, i.e.,
between the gas blower suction and discharge lines, This valve varies
the flow through line 960 to regulate the component cooling gas supply
pressure to a relatively constant value irrespective of the rate of use
at various freeze valves, etc. The 3-in. line 960 discharges into the
reactor cell in the annular space between a L-ft length of 10-in. sched
10 pipe and the b-in. portion of the off-gas line 522, at the 831l-ft
elev near the cell wall. This arrangement helps cools the leaving
off-gas stream,

The 5-hp, 60-scfm, positive-isplacement type blower, CCP-3, supplying
component cooling air to the coolant and processing cells is located in the

. blower house. As shown on the coolant system flowsheet, Figure 9. (ORNL

Dwg D-AA-A-}0881) , air is drawn from the blower house through a filter.

The blower discharge is a 3-in. sched LO carbon steel pipe, line 906, which

is provided with a check vslve and safety block velve ESV-906C. A pressure-
relief valve, set at 10 psig, vents to the blower room. An air-operated

 
 

434

valve, PCV-906B, in a branch line from 906, also vents to the atmosphere,
and is controlled by a pressure transmitter in line 906, PICA-906B, to
regulate the air supply pressure.

An alternate air supply ie provided through line 967, & l-in. sched
40 pipe which connects to line 906 down stream of the check valve CV-906.
Line 967 supplies air from the service air system through a l-in. check
velve, pressure reguletor, PCV-967, and a stop valve.

heeder, line 924. As shown in the flowsheet, Figure 6.2 (ORNL Dwg
D-AA-A-40B8T), before entering the fuel processing cell, line 924 branches
into the 3/k-in. steel pipe lines 929, 969 and 92k, to supply air to the
freeze valves FV-110 and FV-112, respectively.

Line 906 continues as a 1-1/k-in. sched 40 pipe to enter the coolant
cell. A 3/k-in. pipe size branch, line 907, with hend-operated reguleting
valve, supplies 1-15 scfm of air to the freeze valve FV-206. Line 906
continues as a 3/4-in. pipe to supply 1-15 scfm to the freeze valve
FV-204k, The discharged cooling air mingles with the air in the coolant
cell and is vented through the ventilation system.

16.3 Description of Equipment

16.3.1 Gas Blowers CCP-l &nd CCP-2 and Containment Tanks
The positive-displacement type blowers used to circulate the cell

- atmosphere gas (95% N,, 5% 0,) are Roots-Connersville Type RAS blowers,

size 10 x 15. Each will deliver 885 scfm at 12.7 psia and 150°F suction
conditions and at 21.3 psia discharge pressure. The discharge gas tempera-
ture 1s estimated to be about 320°F. Under these conditions the brake
horsepower requirement is 70.3 bhp and the speed 900 rpm. The blowers
are driven through a V-belt drive by T5-hp, 1,200-rpm, Lh0-volt, squirrel
cage induction motors, Type F, mounted ebout 4 ft ebove the blowers on
& common channel-iron framework. (See ORNL Dwg E-JJ-C-414T2).

The blower bearings, seals and gears are pressure lubricated and
cooled by pumping oil from a sump in the blower housing through a stein-
less steel, water-cooled heat exchanger, through a filter and back to

the bearings and seals. Excell oil is by-passed through a relief valve
and vented to the oil sump. The oil pump is e Worthington gear pump,
Type 3 GAFT, driven by an extension of the blower shaft.

Since there could possibly be gas leakage at the blower shaft
seals, each blower 1s contained in a steel tank, which is, in effect,
an extension of the reactor containment, and was designed accordingly.
Each blower was mounted in a separate tank so that one could be in
service while the other is open for maintenance. Each tank is 62 in. OD
x 96 in. high, overall, with 5/16-in. wall, and upper and lower ASME
torospherical heads 3/8-in. thick. The height of the cylindrical portion
between the top head weld and the bottom closure flange is 60-7/ 8 in.

The tanks are constructed of carbon steel, SA-201l. Each was
designed for 40 psig internal pressure, T psig external pressure at
200°F, in accordance with the ASME Code Section vir, Nuclear Case
1270N end 1272N. The vessels were stress relieved at 1100°F and
hydrostetically tested at 60 psig.

The upper head of each tank is welded in place end the lower head
1s bolted to the tank with an ASME Grade 350, Class LF1, raised-face
flange joint, using 60 steel bolts, 1-3/4 in. x 6 in. long, and a 1/8-in.-
thick "Viton" gasket. The top head is provided with three lifting lugs
to facilitate removal for maintenance. The tank is supported by four
3-in. pipe legs sbout 28 in. long welded to reinforcing pads on the
bottom head. oo

The 10-in. sched 40 stainless steel suction line is welded to
a 10-in. carbon steel nozzle welded into a reinforced opening at the
centerline of the lower head. The gas is drawn into the interior of
the tank and in passing through it to the blower suction opening
helps cool the drive motor. The 6~in. blower discharge is flanged to

‘the 6-in. sched 40 discharge nozzle welded into & reinforced opening

in the lower head. A 12-in. bolted-flange inspection nozzle is located

on the side of the tank sbout 14 in. above the vessel closure flange
‘and 18 used for checking the oil level, changing the oil, filters, etc.

The electrical leads for the motor are brought through a special sleeve
in the lower head using copper-sheathed, mineral-insulated, 3-conductor
No. lt cable.

16.3.2 Air Blower, CCP-3
The blower for furnishing cooling air to the freeze flanges in the

coolant and fuel processing cells is located in the blower house at the
southwest corner of Bldg T7503. It is a Sutor built, Model Uk, rated at
60 scfm of eir at 8 psig discharge pressure, vhen operating et 1,510 rpm.
It is driven by & 5-hp, 1,800-rpm electric motor through a V-belt drive.
The timing gears are oil-splash lubricated end the bearings and seals
ere grease-lubricated. The basic blower design is similer to the CCP-1
end CCP-2 gas blowers described sbove,

16.3.3 Gas Cooler, GC.

The 320°F compressed gas leaving the gas blower, CCP-1l or CCP-2,
1s cooled to about 150°F in & horizontal, shell-and-tube, stainless steel
all-welded, heat exchanger located in the speciel equipment room. The
exchanger is cooled by a flow of sbout 20 gpm of treated water circu
lating through the tubes in & two-pass arrangement. The shell is 8-in.
sched LO pipe and sbout 9 ft 5 in. long. Two 6-in. sched 40 gas nozzles
are butt welded to the shell to provide a single pass for the ges flow
through the shell. There are 56 tubes febricated of 5/8-in. No. 16 BWG
seamless 30k stainless steel, mounted on 13/16-in. triangular pitch.
The effective heat transfer surface is sbout 73 £t2, The tubes are
rolled into the tube sheet and seal-welded. The tube sheets are welded
to the shell. The heat removal capacity is estimated to be ebout 181,000
Btu/hr and the pressure loss due to flow on the shell side is sbout
0.5 psi.

16.3.k Valves

Valves used in the component cooling systems ere listed in Table
16.3. All valves used in the gas circulating system outside of the
reactor cell are in effect part of the reactor containment end are 304
stainless steel or Monel. The valves inside the cells ere steel, with
either threaded or flanged connections. Threaded valves ere back-welded.
All valves have flenged disconnects in the horizontal plane in ‘the lines

& short distance from the velve to facilitate remote maintenance procedures.

Steel valves are used in the air distribution system.

17. CONTAINMENT
17.1 General Design Consideretions

During operation, maintenance, end in case of an accident, it is re-
quired that the containment be adequate to prevent escape of multicurie
amounts of radioactivity to the surrounding areas. The containment must
also prevent the release of dangerous amounts of other hazardous materials
end, in genersl, serve to protect personnel and equipment.

Any equipment which contains, or could contain, multicurie emounts of
redioactive material must have a minimum of two barriers to prevent its es~
cape. 161 During operation of the MSRE the primary containment consists of
the walls of the components and the connecting piping. The reactor end

drain tank cell enclosures provide the secondary containment during oper-

‘ation. These cells normally operate at sub-atmospheric pressure to assure

that any leakage is inward and that the rate can be continuously measured.

The controlled ventiletion areas in the high bay and various cells,
as described in Section 13, constitute a third barrier to the escape of
activity during normal opergtion of the reactor. Air is drawn through
these sub-gtmospheric-pressure enclosed areas, passed through absolute
filters, and monitored for radioactivity before discharge from the venti-
lation system stack located south of Building 7503.

When the reactor or drain tank cells are opened for maintenance,
air flow through the openings at velocities in excess of 100 fpm is sub-
stituted as the secondary barrier. If the primary piping in the cell is
opened for maintenance, then the air flow through the cell opening becomes
the primary barrier end the controlled ventilation area becomes the second-
ary containment. EEE Co

In teking semples of fuel salt from the bowl of the fuel pump through
the sampler-enricher system described in Section 7, sealed containers con-
stitute the primary and secondary containment.

In the hypothesis of the maximum credible accident (see Part V), in
which it is assumed that hot fuel salt mixes with the water in the cells
to generate steam, the total pressure in the containment vessels could ex-
ceed the design value of 40 psig and 260°F, if not controlled. 2 161 A

 
 

440

vapor condensing system is provided which can rapidly condense the steam
and also retain the non-condensible gases.

During normal operation the atmosphere in the reactor and drain tank
cell containment enclosures is maintained as an inert mixture (> 95% N, ’
>5% 0,) to eliminate hazards due to combustion of inflameble materials in
the cell, such as the oil in the fuel circulating pump lubrication system.

The entire primary system is of all-welded construction with all
flanged joints leak detected, except at a few less vulnerable locations
where sutoclave fittings are used. Pipe lines which pass through the cell
wells to connect to the primary system have check valves and/or gir-oper-
ated block valves which are controlled by radiation monitors or pressure
switches sensing a rise in cell pressure. The portion of this piping out-
side the cell, between the cell wall penetration and the check or block
velve, and the valves themselves, are enclosed to provide the required
secondary containment. These enclosures are designed to be capable of
withstending the same maximum pressure (40 psig) as the reactor and drain
tank cells, except in some speciel cases where containers vented to the
ventilation system are used.

Al] service lines penetrating the secondary conteinment, that is,
the cell walls, heve check valves or air-operated block valves which
close on detection of abnormal radioactivity or abnormally high cell
pressure, or are parts of completely closed piping systems.

17.2 Reactor and Drein Tank Cells

During normal operation of the reactor, all fuel salt will be in
equipment or piping contained in the resctor end drain tank cells. The
reactor containment vessel is 24 £t ID x 33 ft in overall height, with
hemispherical bottom and flat top, as described in Section 4.3.1. The
drain tank cell is rectangular, with inside dimensions of 17 ft 7 in. x
21 ft 2-1/2 in. x 20 ft 6 in. high, and is described in Section 4.3.2.
The two cells ere interconnected by an open tunnel, operate at the same
pressure at all times, and will withstand internsl pressures in excess
of 40 psig. Both are sealed and operate at 12.7 psia to prevent out-
leakage of airborne contaminants. The negative pressure is maintesined

«

t

 

441

by the gas blower in the component cooling system, described in
Section 16.

17.2.1 Cell Ieak Rate

The allowable leskage from the reactor snd drain tank cells is taken
as 1% of the cell volume per day at the conditions encountered in the post-
ulated maximum credible accident. This amounts to 8.2 liters/hr STP at a
cell pressure of 40 psig. For the capillary type flow which occurs through
very small openings, the leek rate is a direct function of the cell gbso-
lute pressure. At a cell pressure of 12.7 psia, the normal operating
pressure, the leak rate equivalent to the maximum allowable is 0.42 scfh.

17.2.2 Cell Atmosphere

The cell atmosphere is N, containing less than 5% Os the low oxygen
content serving to eliminste the hazards of explosions due to possible
leakage of oil from the fuel salt circulating pump lubricating system.
Nitrogen is edded to the cell as needed to make up for air inleakage. The
leak rate into the cells is determined by: (1) observing changes in abso-
lute pressure (after compensating for changes in cell air temperature),
(2) observing the change in differential pressure between the cells and a
temperature-compensating reference volume located inside the cell, and (3)
observing the changes in oxygen content of the cell atmosphere.

At the 12.7 psia normel cell operating pressure, and with a leak rate
of 0.42 scfh, the required nitrogen purge rate is 1.5 scfh. The nitrogen
is normally supplied from a bank of two cylinders located in the northwest
corner of Building T7503 at the 8L0-ft elevation. The nitrogen enters the
cell through the bubblers used for ‘measuring the liquid level in the cell
sump, as mentioned in Section 1k, 2. After the cells have been opened for
maintenance, approximately 26, 000 scf of nitrogen gas is required to lower
the 0, content in the cell to 5%. This large volume of ges will be added
through a temporary line from treller-mounted nitrogen cylinders to the

sump Jet supply lines.

 
442

17.2.3 Penetrations and Methods of Segling

Piping end wiring penetrations through the cell walls were given
careful design study to reduce as much as possible this source of gas
leakage. The penetrations through the reactor containment vessel wall
are listed in Table 4.1 and those in the drain tank cell are shown in
Table L.2.

The outside of all process piping entering the cell is welded at
the penetrations.

| All electrical leads passing through the cell wells are magnesium-
oxide-filled copper sheaths. The outside of the sheaths are sealed to »
the 3/4-in. pipe penetrations by two compression-type fittings, one in-
side and one outside the cell. The ends of the sheaths which terminate
inside the cells are sealed at the disconnect by glass-to-metsl seals. .
The ends which terminate outside are sealed by standard mineral-insulated
cable-end seals, as manufactured by the General Cable Company. (The
seal is formed by compressing ea plastic insulating materiel around the
wires.)

All thermocouples have Fiberglas insulated leads in multi~-conductor,
sheathed cebles. The outside of the sheaths are sealed to the 3/k-in.
pipe penetrations inside and outside the cell, using soft solder. The
ends of the sheaths terminating inside the cells are sealed at the dis- -
connect by glass to metal welds. The ends of the cables outside the
cells are terminated in epoxy sealed headers. The headers can be pres-
surized to test for leaks. oo -

The outside of all instrument pneumatic signel lines and instrument

13

air lines are sealed to the 3/h-in. pipe penetrations by two compression
type fittings, one inside and one outside the cell. Each of these lines
contains a block valve located near the cell well, the valves closing
automatically if the cell pressure becomes greater then atmospheric.

Methods of sealing certain lines require special mention, es
follows:

a. Cell ventilation line 930 contains two 30-in. motor-operated

butterfly valves in series, as described in Section 13. These valves are .
strictly supervised to assure that they remein closed during reactor oper- W
etion.

b. The component cooling system blowers described in Section 16
are sepled in containment tenks to guerd egeinst loss of gas at the shaft
seals.

¢. The cell evacuation line 565 conteins a block valve, HCV-565,
which automatically closes in event FealoRetiviey is detected in the line
by the monitor, RE-565.

d. The air supply lines 332 and 342 for the cell sumps contain
soft seated check valves.

e. Jet discharge lines 333 and 343 from the sumps each contain
two block valves in series, FCV-333-A and B, and FCV-3L43-A and B, which
gutomatically close if the cell pressure becomes grester than atmospheric.
A 1/2-in, connection is provided between the valves to test them for leak
tightness.

f. The fuel sampler-enricher system is interlocked to prevent a
direct opening to the atmosphere, as described in Section 7. All helium
supply lines contain soft seated check valves.

g. The steam condensing system used in conjunction with the
drain tank heat removal system is a closed loop except for the water supply
lines, which contain soft seated check valves, and the vent, which relieves
to the vepor condensing system, to be described subsequently.

h. All cooling water lines entering the cell have soft seated
check valves or block valves controlled by redietion monitors. All lines
leaving the cells are Provided with block valves controlled by radiation
monitors.

i. me fuel pump lubriceting oil system is a closed circulating

loop. Strict supervision is provided during additions of oil or oil

sanpling to assure that the containment is not violated.
J¢ The leek detector ‘system is closed and operates at a higher

pressure then in the reactor process systems.

‘k. Severel differential-pressure cells and pressure transmitters

“are located outside the cells but are connected to process piping inside

through instrument tubing. The instrument lines are doubly contained.

The diaphragm of the DP cell provides primary containment. The instrument
cases are vented to en expansion chamber designed for an internal pressure
of 50 psig to provide the secondary containment. The cases also serve as

an atmospheric reference pressure for the transmitters.

cell wall and the instrument box is a 1/2-in. pipe enclosed within a

‘1-in, pipe. Lines 522 and 561 share a common 3-in. containment pipe be-

tween the instrument box and the valve box attached to the charcoal bed
penetration. The charcoal bed pit, instrument box, valve box and the
ennular spaces around the off-gas pipes, are vented to the containment
ventilation system. The off-gas lines from the charcoal beds have sg
common block valve, HCV-557C, which closes on detection of radioactivity
in the line.

n. The coolant salt lines 200 and 201, penetrating the reactor
cell wall, are part of a closed circulating system. They are described in
Section 8.5.

17.3 Vapor Condensing System

An sccident can be conceived in which hot fuel salt and the water
used to cool equipment inside the cells become mixed and generates steam
to pressurize the reactor and drain tank cells. (See the Analysis of
Hazards, Part V). A vapor condensing system. is provided to prevent the
steam pressure from rising sbove the U0 psig allowable pressure for the
cells, and to retain the non-condensible geses. This equipment, con-
sisting primarily of a vertical water tank and a horizontal gas storage
tank, is located about 60 ft from the southeast corner of Building 7503,
as shown in Fig. 3.2. The general arrangement is shown schematically in
Fig. 17.1.

 

*
The vapor condensing system is sometimes referred to in the MSRE
literature as the pressure suppression system,

(The method of handling steam that might be generated beneath the
reactor cell containment vessel if hot fuel were spilled to the bottom
of the cell is discussed in Section 4.3.1.)

As shown on the off-gas system and containment ventilation process
flowsheet, Fig. 13.2 (ORNL drawing D-AA-A-40883), and on the layout draw-
ing, ORNL D-KK-D-54287, a 12-in. sched-40 steel pipe, line 980, branches
from the 30-in.-diam cell ventilation pipe in the special equipment room
upstream of the two butterfly valves, HCV-930-A and HCV-930-B. 10 Inside
the special equipment room, line 980 contains a 10-in. rupture disk having
a bursting pressure of 20 psi, and in a parallel connection with it, a
3-in. rupture disk with a bursting pressure of 15 psi. In relieving at
the lower pressure the 3-in,-disk reduces the dynamic impact on the con-
densing system when the large disk ruptures. Calculated flows through
the 3-in., disk indicates a negligible pressure increase downstream of the
10-in. disk, allowing it to rupture as planned, 170 A lL-in. hand valve
with an extension handle to the operating floor level is piped in parallel
with the two rupture disks to permit equalization of the pressure on the
disks when the cells are being pressure tested sbove the normal operating
pressure for the disks. With the reactor cell at LO psig and the vapor
condensing system at 30 psig, the estimated mass flow rate in line 980
is 16 1b/sec.t 3 Line 980 continues underground to the vapor condensing
tank, VT-1, located east of the ventilation system stack, see plot plan,
Fig. 3.2. A 12-in. expansion joint is provided in line 980 to absorb
thermal expansions,

The vapor condensing tank, or water tank, is a vertical tank about
two-thirds full of water, through which gases forced from the reactor
cell in a major accident would be bubbled to condense the steam. The
tank contains about 1,200 £t7 of water stored at 70°F, or less. The es-
timated maximum of 5 x 10° Btu that could be released from the fuel salt
in the reactor and drain tank cells would therefore raise the water temper-
ature to about 10°F. 165; 166 The non-condensible gases are vented to a
large gas storage tank.

The vertical water tank is 10 ft OD x 23 ft 4 in. high, including
the ASME flanged and dished, 1/2-in.-thick, top and bottom heads. The
shell is 3/8-in. thick and constructed of SA-300 Class I, A-201, Grade B

firebox steel. 12? There are stiffening rings, l-in. thick x 3 in., lo-
cated on the exterior ebout 2 ft 6 in, gpart. The tank is designed for

8 peis at 100°F or 63 psia at 300°F. The 12-in. ges inlet pipe in the

top head extends 13 ft 8 in, into the tenk to sbout 6 ft below the normal
water level, end terminates in a cylindrical screen, 11-7/8-in. OD x 1k in,
long, perforated with 7/32-in,-diem holes on 3/8-in. centers, and providing
31% free area. See ORNL drawing D-KK-B-41283.

The gas inlet line in the interior of the tank has a 12-in, pipe
cross about 3 ft gbove the water level to which are connected two 12-in.
cast-steel-body check valves. These check valves close when the gas flow
is into the tank but open to return non-condensibles to the reactor cell
through line 980 during cooldown after an accident.

The tenk is filled to the operating level with potable water through
e temporary line or hose, Liquid level indication is provided by the
float operated instrument, LI-VT-1l. The pressure is indicated by PI-VT-1,
end the temperature is measured. There is no bottom drain on the tank,
the weter being removed by pumping should this be required.

The top head of the tank is provided with en 18-in.-diem blind flange
to serve as & manhole, The 12-in. discharge nozzle for non-condensible
gases is also in the top head. The tank is installed vertically with the
top gbout 8 ft below the normal grade level of 850 ft and the bottom at
an elevation of ebout 819 ft. About 5 ft of additional earth is mounded
above the tank to provide biological shielding. The tank is supported
and also held down by a skirt on the bottom head bolted to & reinforced
concrete pad, 18-in, thick x 1b ft diam, which also includes a cylindri-
cel wall, 12-in. thick x 10 ft OD, end about 8 £t high.

The non-condensible gases leaving the top of the water tank through
the 12-in. pipe, line 981, flow through the expansion Joint in the line
end to a side nozzle on the gas retention tenk, VP-2. Gases can asccumu~
lete in this tenk, initially at atmospheric pressure, until the pressure

falls to a lower level in the reactor cell. The gas then returns to the

reactor cell to prevent the pressure from falling below 8.0 psia. Iine
98k, g 2-in. line with a hand valve (with removeble handle) is provided
to vent gas to the absolute filters and ventilating system stack.

 
 

448

The gas retention tank is 10 ft OD x 66 ft 3-1/2 in. long, in-
cluding the two ASME 1/2-in.-thick flanged and dished heads. The shell
is 3/8-in. thick, reinforced with 1-in.~thick x 5 in. rings located about
4 ft 7 in. epart. The tank is fabricated of SA-300 Class I, SA-201 Grade B
firebox steel and is designed for 8 psia at 100°F and 63 psia at 300°F. It
is anchored into a sand and gravel base by four l-in.-diam galvenized steel
tie rods fastened to expanding type earth anchors. The nozzle end of the
tank is anchored to a reinforced concrete saddle and pad, roughly 18 in,
thick, 12 ft wide, and 6 ft long. The centerline is about 1h ft from the
centerline of the vapor condensing tank and the elevation at the bottom is
842 ft. A 1-1/2-in, sched 40 drain pipe, line 982, at the bottom, drains
into the vapor condensing tank. See ORNL drawing D-KK-B-41282.

The drain tank condensers, line 338, and the relief valve on the water
line from the thermal shield and fuel pump, line 885, are both vented to
the vapor condensing system by joining line 982. (See Section 15.2.)

18. BIOLOGICAL SHIELDING

The MSRE building areas are divided into five classifications:

(I), those with high radiation levels that cannot be entered under any
circumstances after the reactor has been operated at power, such as the
reactor and drain tank cells; (II), those that can be entered a short time
after the fuel salt is drained from the primary circulating system, such
as the radiator area; (III), those that can be entered at low reactor
power levels, such as the special equipment room; (IV), areas which are
habitable at all times; (V), the maintenance control roam, which is the
only habitable area on the site when certain large-scale maintenance
operations are being performed. These classifications are described in
more detail in Section k.1.

The MSRE is designed to permit prolonged operation at 10 Mw without
exposing personnel to more than the permissible dose" of 100 mrem/week in
areas which are entered routinely and have unlimited access. 167 However,
it is ORNL policy to limit all personnel exposures to a minimum and it is
not anticipated that MSRE operators will accumulate 100 mrem/week except
in unusual circumstances. The areas which will have unlimited access and
which, therefore, might be occupied continuously, will be essentially at
normal background level for the Oak Ridge vicinity.

"Hot spots,” or areas of high local activity, are generally located
near the reactor or drain tank cell penetrations and are in areas which
have only limited access, such as the coolant cell. The overall activity

in the coolant cell, however, does not exceed 100 mr/hr. The blower house

‘is also a limited access area, with a radiation level of about 20 mr/hr

near the No. 4 blower. Although the special equipment room is classified
a limited access area, the radiation field does not exceed about 10 mr/hr.
The south electric service area, another limited access portion of the
building, has a generally higher radiation level of 200 mr/hr, with some
"hot spots" near the penetrations. * All the ‘above estimates of activity

levels are based on operation of the reactor at the 10-Mw power level.

 

*Based on 40-hr work week and that 1 roentgen equals 1 rem for gamma
radiation in soft body tissue.

 
 

450

The intensity of the radiation in the auxiliary cells is less de-
pendent upon the reactor power level than upon the nature of the materials
present in the cells. These conditions change from time to time, but in
general, all the cells have limited access.

When the reactor is subcritical, all areas except the reactor, drain
tank and fuel processing cells, may be entered a few minutes after the
reactor is shut down. In general, access can be on an unlimited basis
except where "hot spots" may exist. 100 For example, if the coolant salt
were drained from that circulating system, two 4-in.-diam holes would be
left through the reactor shielding, one of which "looks" directly at the
fuel pump bowl, and could cause a localized beam in the coolant cell of
several r/hr. Entry to such areas and work in the areas will be monitored

and additional shielding provided as required.
18.1 General Description

This section provides only a summary description of the biological
shielding. The general construction of the cells and other aress is de-
scribed in more detail in Section 4 of this Part I of the design report.
The calculations necessary to confirm the adequacy of the shielding are
presented in Section 13 of the nuclear analysis portion of the report,
part 111.168 19 170 me chierding needed for the fuel handling and
processing system is covered in Part VII. Shielding required during
maintenance procedures is described in Part X.

The reactor vessel is surrounded, except for a 2-ft-diam opening at
the top, by a 16-in.-thick iron and water thermal shield. This is located
within the reactor cell containment vessel which, in turn, sits within a
shield tank to provide a 3-ft-wide annular space which is filled with -
magnetite sand and light water. The shield tank is surrounded by a
cylindrical monolithic concrete wall 21 in. thick. A portion of this
wall facing the south electric service area and another portion facing
the coolant area are left out in order to make the penetrations accessible.
Barytes concrete block walls are provided to shield accessible areas ad-

Jacent to the coolant cell. The additional shielding is not necessary

in the electric service area in that there is a minimum of 2 ft of con-
crete between it and any accessible area.

The top of the reactor cell is constructed of a 3-1/2-ft-thick layer
of barytes concrete blocks covered with 3-1/2-ft-thick blocks of ordinary
concrete. The joints between the upper and lower layer of blocks are
staggered. High-density shielding blocks are temporarily stacked above
this as required.

The pipe penetrations through the reactor and drain tank cell walls
pass through sleeves which are filled with magnetite concrete grout or
magnetite sand and water. Where possible, these lines have an offset
bend. The penetration of the 30-in-diam exhaust line through the bottom
hemisphere of the containment vessel required special treatment because
of the size of the opening. A shadow shield of a 9-in. thickness of
steel is provided in front of the opening inside the cell and a 12-in.-
thick wall of stacked block is erected outside the cell at the foot of
the ramp to the coolant cell.

The top and sides of the coolant and coolant drain tank cells pro-
vide at least 24 in. of concrete shielding as protection against activity
induced in the coolant salt while the reactor is producing power. The
large openings provided between the coolant cell and the blower house
for the cooling air supply to the radiator, however, make it difficult
to shield the blower house from this induced activity. A 12-in. wall
of barytes blocks is stacked across the opening between the reactor cell
and the radiator duct to shield the blower house area from the coolant
salt lines.

The drain tank cell has a minimum thickness of 3 ft for the magnetite
concrete walls facing accessible areas. The top of the cell consists of
a layer of h-ft-thick ordinary concrete blocks covered by a layer of
3-1/2-ft-thick ordinary concrete blocks. The joints between the blocks
are staggered. The pipe lines penetrating the cell walls have offsets,
the smaller ones being cast into the walls. Shield plugs are provided
for the larger penetrations.

The 1/2-in. off-gas line from the reactor cell, line 52k, is
shielded by 4 in. of lead as it passes through the coolant drain tank

cell. Barytes concrete blocks are stacked to a thickness of 5 ft above
the line in the vent house, and 17-in.-thick steel plate is provided
above the line between the vent house and the charcoal beds. 111 The
charcoal beds are submerged in water and the pit is covered with two
18-in.-thick by 10-ft-diam barytes concrete blocks. Barytes blocks
will be stacked on the cover if additional shielding is required.

The walls of the filter pit for the containment ventilation system
are 12 in. thick and the roof plugs for the pit are 18 in. thick.

The thicknesses of the walls and tops of the auxiliary cells is
given in Table 4.3. Additional shielding is provided by stacked blocks

on the west side of the fuel processing and the decontamination cells.

19. ELECTRICAL SERVICES

The MSRE électrical services system furnishes power for process
pumps, equipment heaters, instrumentation, nuclear control and safety
circuits, and various auxiliary equipment. Power is also provided for
the building cranes, repair shops, and general building lighting, venti-
letion end air conditioning.

The MSRE installation makes use of the relatively extensive electri-
cal facilities that were installed for the ARE and ART operetions in the
Building 7503 area. This existing equipment was modified and supplemented,
es required.

The installed electrical capacity of MSRE process equipment, ex-
cluding general building services, is about 2,000 kw. The normal operating
load is approximately 1,100 kw.

Power 1s supplied from the Tennessee Valley Authority distribution
system through two parallel 13.8 kv feeder lines. In the event of failure
of the normal power supply from the TVA system, batteries provide the L8-v
DC power for the reactor control and safety circuits and also 250-v DC
power to drive a 25-kw motor-generator set to supply AC power to other in-
struments and controls, the sempler-enricher station, the control-rod
drives, end the lubrication systems for the salt circulating pumps. These
batteries serve until the emergency diesel-generator sets can be started
end loaded, a procedure normally requiring a maximum of 5 to 10 minutes.¥
In event none of the diesel units can be started, bettery capacities are
more than smple to maintain control of the reactor snd to drain the fuel
selt to the drain tenks without damage to the system.

The three emergency diesel-generstor sets have a combined capacity of
900 kw AC. This emergency AC power cen drive the 3-kw, 48-v, DC motor-
generator set normally supplying the reactor control and safety circuits.
During the emergency period, the lube oil systems, control-rod drives,

 

*¥The time availsble for starting the emergency diesel-genergtor units
without draining the reactor is limited by the thaw time of the freeze
valve on the reactor drain line 103 and by the pressure and temperature
rise in the reactor containment vessel. A period of sbout 10 min is esti-
mated to be available,

 
 

 

 

454

and other important AC equipment mentioned above, can continue to re-
ceive power from the battery-driven 25-kw motor-generator set (for at
least two hours), or they may teke power directly from the diesel-driven
generators. With the three emergency diesels in operation the reactor
can operate at the heat-loss power level indefinitely until normal
electric power can be restored.

19.1 General Description

A simplified one-line diagram of the electrical supply and dis-
tribution system for the MSRE is shown in Fig. 19.1. Reference numbers
on this diagram are keyed to the descriptive material in the following
sections.

The MSRE is supplied with electric power from the 15k-kv Tennessee
Valley Authority system through a substation located just north of the
X-10 area (see Fig. 3.4). Either of two 13.8-kv transmission lines from
the substation, ORNL circuit 234 or 294, serve the Building 7503 area
end ere interconnected through interlocked motor operated switches at
the MSRE site so that circuit 299 can serve as an alternative to circuit
234, The normal supply is through ORNL circuit 234.

The feeders supply a bank of three 250-kva, 13.8~kv to 480-v, trans-
formers located on the east side of Building 7503 to provide power for
general building services. The feeder power is also connected to a new
1,500-kva, 13.8-kv to 480-v, trensformer located on the west side of the
building to serve the MSRE process equipment loed.

The process equipment distribution system is shown schematically in
Fig. 19.2. (ORNL drawing D-KK-C-41152) The 1,500-kva substation feeds
a TVA® switchgear bus which supplies power through circuit breakers to
three generator® switchgear busses, two TVA motor-control centers, two
250-hp radiator blower motors, and to the 200-hp motor for the 250-v DC
motor-generator set. The two TVA motor control centers supply power to

 

*Throughout the electrical service system reference literature and
drawings, the normal source of electric power has been designated "TVA,"
as contrasted to the emergency source, which has been called "generator."

the less critical process heater distribution centers and to a few non-
critical smaller motors.

The three generator switchgear busses are normally fed from the TVA
system but each has its own diesel-driven, 300-kw generator’ to supply
emergency power. Generator No. 5 supplies one heater distribution panel
and two motor control centers which provide power to the heater distri-

bution panels for the more critical process heaters.

Generator No. 3
and generator No. 4 switchgear busses furnish power directly, or through
motor-control centers, to all critical motorized equipment and to some
instrumentation. Where reactor process equipment is installed in dupli-
cate, each unit is supplied from a different generator bus to provide
greater reliability of emergency operation.

The process distribution system includes the aforementioned 48-v DC
motor-generagtor set which supplies power to the important reactor control
and safety circuits. This direct-current system operates from a battery
supply during a failure of the normal power source until either diesel
No. 3 or No. 4 can be started.

The building services distribution system is shown schematically in
Fig. 19.3. ‘This system supplies power for building and grounds lighting,
for heating, ventilating and air conditioning, and for maintenance services,
such as cranes, welding, etc. The power is supplied from two main dis-
tribution panels and from various lighting panels located throughout the
building. Part of the building lighting load can be transferred to the
generator No. 3 switchgear bus for emergency lighting in event of failure
of the normal supply from the TVA system.

 

*The No. 5 diesel~-generator unit has a nameplate rating of 1,200 kw,
but has a continuous duty output of 300 kw due to the limited output of
the diesel engine. See Section 19.3.

*¥Across-the-1line motor starter contactors and circuit breakers in the
motor control centers originally installed for the ART are utilized ex-
tensively in various MSRE circuits and are termed "motor control centers"
in the MSRE literature and on drawings even though a particular center
may be controlling a heater, for example, rather than a motor.

19.2 Transmission Lines and Substations

Electrical power is supplied to the MSRE site by two 13.8-kv over-
head feeder lines from the ORNL substation located just north of the main
X-10 area, see Fig. 3.4. These are designated ORNL circuits 234 and 29k.
The preferred supply arrengement is through circuit 234, through the motor-
operated disconnect switch, M-1. The elternate arrangement is through
circuit 294 and the motor-operated disconnect switch M-2. These two
switches are interlocked to prevent both switches from being closed at the
seme time. The switch, M-1l, has an opening delay timer which allows a 1
to 10 sec loss of power on circuit 234 before the switch opens, then the
switch M-2 sutomatically closes if there is supply voltage on circuit 29k.
The control circuit for M-2 will also prevent the switch from closing if
there is an electrical fault in the Building 7503 area. The control power
for the breakers M-l1 and M-2 is from the Building 7503 ares 250-v DC system.
The switches can be closed from the remote pushbutton station in the MSRE
auxiliary control room or manually at the switch poles C and D located north
of the building.

The process power substation is located west of Building T7503 and con-
sists of an oil filled, 1,500-kve, 13.8-kv/480-v, 3-phase, 60-cycle, 3-wire,
delta-connected Uptgroff trensformer with a maximum impedence of 5.75%.

The 13.8 kv supply enters the substation through a high voltage, fused cut-
out disconnect switch. The 480-v transformer output enters the switch
house through twelve 750 mem” (0.998-in. diam) cables laid in underground
conduit, through a 1,600-emp bresker, R, to connect to the TVA switchgear
bus.

The building service substetion is located to the east of Building
T7503 and is supplied through a disconnect switch. The substation consists
of three 250 kva, single-phase transformers connected delta-delta to re-
duce the 13.8-kv supply to 480-v, 3-phase, 60-cycle power. The transformer
output is brought into the building through nine 500 mem (0.814-in. diam)
underground cables. Six cables (two per phase) lead to the 600-amp main

 

*
mem = thousand circular mils.

 
 

460

circuit breaker for distribution panel No. 1 and the other three lead
to the 600-amp distribution panel No. 2. These circuit breakers are
located on the wall of the main building at column D-L4 (see Fig. 4.4)
at the 8LO-ft elevation.

19.3 Emergency Diesel-Generators

Of the five diesel-generator units initially installed in the
generator house for the ART project, two were removed for other duty
and three remain for use in the MSRE. These units, numbered 3, 4 and 5,
have a continuous capacity of 300 kw each, as explained below.

Individual busses were selected for distribution of the power from
the generators to the centers on the basis of calculations of the size
and nature of the MSRE emergency electrical loads, the sizes of the
existing switchgear, and the characteristics of the diesel-generator
units. 2 A ground detector alarm is provided for each bus.

The three diesel-generator units can be operated from control panels
located in the switch house. These panels have the necessary switches,
controls, and indicating meters to adjust the generator output voltage
and frequency and the synchronizing equipment for paralleling generators
No. 3 and 4 with the TVA system. All three units can be started remotely
from panels DPM 3, DPM 4, and DPM 5 in the auxiliary control room. These
panels also include remote switches to open circuit breakers Al and A2
to isolate busses 3, 4, and 5 from the TVA system and to close breekers
A3, Al, and A5 to connect the generators to their respective busses.

The remote panels also include diesel ennuncistor alarms, voltmeters
end ammeters for the generator outputs, and a voltmeter for the TVA

system power.

19.3.1 Diesel-Generator Units No. 3 and No. U4

These idential machines are Allis-Chalmers Buda units, Model
8nc 56-2505. 172
450 at 1,200 rpm. A 10% overload can be carried for a maximum of four
hours, which must be followed by a cooling period of at least two hours

The engine is rated at an available brake horsepower of

at no more than the rated load. The engines are started by a battery -

 
 

461

bank for each unit. Annunciators are provided to sound alarms on high
cooling water temperature, high oll temperature, low oll pressure and
low fuel level. )

The generator is a direct connected Electric Machinery Model
DCSG-300-A3E, rated at 300 kw, 375 kva, 480 v at 0.8 power factor, for
continuous service. Each generator frame is equivalent to a 500-kw,
625-kve machine, however, this oversizing heving been provided to com-
pensate for the reactence load which would have been imposed by sterting
the large motor involved in the ART operations. Although the generator
1s constructed to AIEE end NEMA standards for an intermittent overload
of 50%, the maximum overload is limited to 10% by the capacity of the
driving engines. (These overload values do not apply to repid load
changes due to motor startings.)

Synchronizing equipment enables diesel-generator unit No. 3 or
No. 4 to operate in parallel with the TVA power supply so that the loads
can be trensferred from the generators back to the TVA system without
interrupting reactor operation. However, both units must not be oper-
ated in parallel with the TVA system at the same time. This would expose
the motor control center busses to the combined cgpacities of both gener-
ators and the TVA system and would greatly exceed the current carrying
cepacity of the busses in event of a dead short in & connected load.

The individual busses for generators No. 3 end 4 supply all motors
which need emergency power. Since the voltage drop in a generator bus
is. critical when starting motors » starting currents have been limited to
540 amps® s0 that the generator voltage will not fall below 80% of the
initiel value.

19.3.2 Diesel-Generstor Unit No. 5

The diesel engine for this unit is & Caterpillar Model D-397. It
1s rated at 455 bhp at full losd and at 1,200 rpm. It may be overloaded
15% for two hours, which mst be followed by & cooling period of at least
two hours at no ‘more than rated load. The engine is started by a con-
pressed air motor supplied by a nearby air receiver end compressor. The
receiver stores sufficient air for five 10-sec starts. The compressor

 

*Equivalent to a 75-hp motor with a starting current 5.5 times full
load rating.

 
 

462

can recharge the receiver in 20 to 30 min following one 1l0-sec start.
An annunciator sounds an alarm on high cooling water temperature, high
oil temperature, low oil pressure, low fuel level, and low starting air
pressure.

The generator was manufactured by Electrical Machinery, is rated at
1,000 kw, 1,250 kva, and is direct connected to operate at 1,200 rpm. For
continuous loading it is rated at 300 kw at 0.8 power factor. As pre-
viously mentioned, the oversized generator was provided to compensate for
the reactance in starting large motors involved in the ART. Although this
generator was also built to conform to the AIEE and NEMA standards for in-
termittent loads of 150%, the maximm load is limited to 115% by the ca-
pacity of the driving engine.

19.4 Process Electrical Circuits

19.4.1 Switchgear Equipment

Except as otherwise indicated, the switchgear equipment is located
in the switch house, as shown in Fig. 19.4.

The equipment was menufactured by Westinghouse Electric Corporation.
The busses are rated at 1,600 amps, 480 v, and have a 50,000-amp short
circuit carrying capacity. The R, P, Q, and Al circuit breakers are
Westinghouse Type DB 50, with a 1,600-amp frame, 50,000~amp asymmetrical,
at 600-v, short circuit capacity. The remaining circuit breakers are
Westinghouse Type DB 25, with 600-amp frame, 25,000 amp asymmetrical at
600 v. ** See Table 190.1 for other data on switchgear busses end breskers.

19.4.1.1 TVA Switchgear Bus and Current-Limiting Reactor. The TVA
switchgear bus, including breeker R in the supply line from the substation,
is located in panels 2 through 5 on the south side of the switch house, as
shown in Fig. 19.4. There are ten circuits connected to the bus, as in-
dicated in Fig. 19.2. The first two 300-amp breskers, P end Q, supply
power to the 250-hp motors of the blowers which supply cooling air to the

 

¥60,000 emp asymmetrical at 480 v.
*%35,000 amp asymmetrical at 480 v.

radistor. The remaining eight circuits are connected to the bus through
a current limiting reactor. This inductance coil protects the busses and
circuit breakers in event of dead shorts in the feeder circuits by creating
a back electromotive force to limit the short circuit current. There are
three Westinghouse Type MSP - 6R2207 reactors, one for each phase, rated
at 16.6 kva, single-phase, 1,200-amp, 13.8 voltage drop, and 480-v line.
Two of the eight circuits supply the TVA motor control centers T=-1 and T-2
through the circuit breskers X and Y. Three circuits supply the generator
switchgear busses through breakers S, T and Z. Another circuit provides
power for the 250-~v DC motor-generator set through bresker W. Circuits U
and V are spares. See ORNL drawing D-KK-C-41175.

19.6 Direct-Current Electrical Systems -

There are two independent direct current electrical systems, an
existing 250-v system and a new U8-v system installed for the MSRE. The
25-kw motor-generator set driven by the direct current system to supply
emergency power to certain important process equipment is discussed in
this section. The location of the major components in the two DC systems
is shown on ORNL drawing D-KK-C-55106.

19.6.1 Battery, M-G Set and Distribution Panel for 250-v DC System

The 250-v DC system provides emergency power to various important
lighting and switching circuits and drives the 25-kw DC-AC motor-generator
set used to supply 120/240-v AC power to the control-rod drives, sampler-
enricher, etc. The 25-kw DC-AC M-G set is described in Section 19.6.3.

19.,6.1.1 AC-DC, 125-kw, 250-v Motor-Generator Set MG-l1. The 250-v
DC power source is a Reliance Electric and Engineering Company motor-
generator set, Model 1TH-11924, It is mounted in a size 6-FM sheet

19.6.1.3 Distribution Panel. The 250-v DC distribution panel is
supplied through & switch and a 400-amp fuse. The following circuits
are supplied by the panel through switches and “fuses of the size indicated:
DC emergency lights (30-amp fuse), switchgear trip circuit (60-amp fuse),
TVA power transfer switch (30-amp fuse), end the 25~kw M-G set (L4OO-amp
fuse).

19.6.2 Battery, M-G Set and Control Panel for 48-v DC System

The 48-v DC system provides power for the electrical- and air-operated
controls systems. These systems normally receive DC power through either
the 3-kw No. 2 AC-DC motor-generator set (driven by AC power taken from
the motor-control center G3-9 which is supplied either with power from the
TVA or diesel-generator unit No. 3), or through the 3-kw AC-DC motor-
generator set No. 3 (supplied with power either from the TVA or from diesel-
generator unit No, 4). = In an emergency, when no AC power is available to
run the 3-kw motor-generators, 48-v DC power can be supplied directly from
a 2h-cell battery system described below. (See ORNL drawing D-KK-C-55112.)

- 19.6.2.1 AC-DC, 3-kw, Motor-Generator Sets. Each of the two identi-
cal units is an Electric Products Company diverter-pole, motor-generator
Type 17961. 17% The L4O-v, 3-phase, 60-cycle, AC motor is rated at 5 hp
at 1,750 rpm. It draws a meximm of 6.6 amps and is rated at 40% temper~
ature rise under continuous duty. The direct-connected DC generator is
rated at 3 kw (53.5 amps at 56 v).

19.6.2.2 Battery for 48-v System. The 2l-cell battery supplying the
48-v emergency power utilizes Exide "Tytex" Type FOP-19 ce11s. 113 The

‘cells have a 12-hr discharge capacity at 600 amp-hr when discharged to

42 volts. The 2h cells normally provide a potential of about 48 volts.

© -19,6.2.3 Control Panel for 48-v System. The control panel for the
4L8-v system is located outside the battery room et the 840-ft elevation.
The panel provides the controls to start and stop the M-G sets, run them
individually or in parallel, to detect system grounds, and to recharge the

‘battery. - (See ORNL drawing 'D-KK-C-55108 and drawing D-KK-C-55109.)

19.6.3 DC-AC 25-kw Motor-Generator Set MG-4 and Connected Load

This motor-generator set is driven by the 250-v DC system and is
used to generate AC power to drive certain important process equipment in

 
 

478

in an emergency. The set is a Reliance Electric Model 1TH-11946, 1
mounted in a size 5-FM sheet steel cabinet having & pressure ventilating
system utilizing dust filters.

The motor is a special direct current motor, frame No. 92-T. It is
a shunt-wound type with l.6l-amp maximum field current. For operation at
1,800 rpm the field controller resistance at 258-v full-load voltage is
36 ohms; for 210-v full-load voltage the required resistance is LO ohms.
The motor is rated at a 40°c temperature rise for continuous service. The
ball-bearing-mounted shaft has an F-2 mounting with back end extension.

The generator is an Electric Machinery, frame 5-20, rated at 25 kw
at 0.8 power factor. It is a single-phase, 120/240-v, 5-wire unit, with
field rheostat, field discharge resistor, end integrally mounted exciter.

The generator supplies AC power to the following equipment: instrument
panel No, 3 (see Part III); process power panel No. 3, which powers the
sampler-enricher and control-rod drive motors; process power panel No. 2,
vhich supplies power to the fuel and coolant salt lubricating oil pumps
through two 220-v single-phase/LL0-v three-phase converters manufactured
by the System Analyzer Corporation, Type 35; and the control power for
diesel-generator unit No. 5. (See ORNL drawing D-KK-C-41152.)

To decrease the load on the 25-kw generator when running the motor
on power from the 250-v battery system, the fuel and coolant salt lubri-
cating pumps, FOP-2 and COP-2, can be stopped end the two spare pumps,
FOP-1 and COP-1l, can be started, these being driven by diesel-generator
units No. 3 and No. 4.

The instrument power panel No. 2 and the process power panel No. 2
receive 120/240-v AC power either from the 25-kw motor-generator set or
through the 480-v/120, 240-v single-phase instrument power transformer
No. 1. This transformer takes its L480-v primary input vie the motor-
control center bus No. 4 and the TVA system, or in en exergency, from
diesel-generator unit No. 4. The secondary of the transformer will be
connected to the instrument and process power panels through en sutomatic
transfer switch which, on low voltege from the 25-kw generator, transfers
the load from the set to the motor-control center bus No. 4. This suto-
matic switch will not transfer if there is no voltege on the No. } bus.
(See ORNL drawing D-KK-C-41152.)

are powered from the TVA motor control center, T-1; and panel T2-Y is
supplied from the TVA motor control center T-2.

The circuit breakers supply power to thirty-eight 30-kva induction
regulators, which are controlled from the heater control panels described
below.

The breakers used in all six circuits are General Electric Type
CCB, 225-amp, 600-v, 3-watt switches, with General Electric Controllers
Type CR 2811D-101B, having a 25-hp capacity with 3-phase, LL0-600-v power.

19.7.3 Circuit Breaker Panel G5-2X and Drain Line 103 Heater Circuit.

Circuit breaker panel G5-2X takes power from the switchgear bus
No. 5 to supply a saturable reactor and a high-current transformer to
provide stepless control of the current to the resistance-heated drain
line 103. |

19.7.3.1 Saturable Reactor. The saturable reactor is a Hevi- 1
Duty Electric Company, Catalog No. D-T73331, single-phase, 60-cycle,
unit, rated at 25 kva, 460 line volts, a load voltage of Llh at 60.5

amps, and with a DC control input of 4 to 75 v. The total resistance

>

is about S54 ohms. The reactor is located in the north electric service
area between columns 5-B and 5-C at the 824-ft elevation.

The 4 to 75-v DC control current to the saturable reactor is
provided by germanium diode rectifiers mounted in the cabinet of heater
control panel No. 8. The DC output of the rectifiers is varied by
controlling the AC input through a Type 136 Powerstat mounted on the
control panel. (The Powerstat is described in Section 19.7.4, below).
A current transformer and ammeter on the control panel provide indi-

cation of the heat input to the drain line,

19.7.3.2 Special 25-kva High-Current Transformer. The output of

 

the saturable reactor is fed to a special 25-kva transformer located in
the drain tank cell. The transformer was manufactured in accordance
with ORNL Dwg B-MM-A-56244 by the Hevi-Duty Electric Company. The pri-
mary is rated at 420 v and the secondary at 18 v. The unit supplies the
heavy current of up to about 1,400 amps needed for resistance heating
of the INOR-8 1-1/2-in. sched 40 drain line 103. The ungrounded side

of the transformer is electrically connected to the drain line about
midway between the reactor and the drain tank and the ends of the

drain line have ground wires to the grounded side of the transformer.

19.7.4 Heater Control Panels and Equipment

 

The twelve heater control panels are located in the north-south
hallway at the 840-ft level, with panels 1 through TA on the west side
of the hallway facing panels 8 through 11. Two additional heater panels
are in the same general location to control the heaters in the fuel
processing system. These are described in Part VII.

A list of the heaters controlled by each panel and the controls
showing on the face of the panel is given in Table 19.10.

The heater panels are supplied with power from the circuit breaker
panels described in Sections 19.7.1 and 19.7.2, above. Some of these
breaker panels supply as many as five different heating panels.

There are no heaters in the process system having the power input
automatically adjusted by heat-sensing devices and controls systems. The
power is regulated by manual adjustment of the voltage at the heater con-
trol panel in response to temperature indications in the nearby tempera-

ture-scanning instrumentation, see Part ITI.

19.7.4.1 Type 136 "Powerstat." This panel-mounted, hand-positioned

 

variable autotransformer is a product of the Superior Electric Company
and is rated at 2.8 kva, 20 amps, 120 v, 60-cycle, with O to 120-v out-
put. A schematic wiring diagram is shown in Figure 19.5, There are a
total of 67 of this type of control.

19.7.4.2 Type 1256 "Powerstat". This Superior Electric Company
variable autotransformer is panel-mounted and hand-positioned and similar
to the Type 136 but is rated at 7.8 kva, 28 amps, with 240 v input and
0 to 280-v output. A typical schematic wiring diagram is shown in

Figure 19.6. Twenty-two of these "Powerstats" are used.

19.7.4.3 Motor-Operated Type 1256-1035 "Powerstat". This variable
autotransformer is motor-operated and mounted on a rack on the west side
of the north-south hallway between columns C-2 and C-3 at the 8Lo-ft
elevation. It is controlled by a "raise-lower" push button on the
heater control panel. The unit is manufactured by the Superior Electric
Company and is rated at 7.8 kva, 28 amps, 240 v input and 0 to 280-v
output, single-phase. The motor is operated on 115 v, 0.4 amps, and
has a 45 sec travel time. A typical wiring diagram is shown in Figure 19.6.

Twenty of the controls are of this type.

19.7.4.4 Induction Regulator. Thirty-eight induction-type voltage
regulators were existing in Bldg 7503 as part of the ART. They are
located on the west side of the north-south hallway at the 840-ft level,
and below this elevation on the south side of the east-west hallway.

Each regulator is a General Electric Company Type AIRT Cat No. 3263366,

and are rated at 480 v, three-phase, 36.5 amp, and 30-kva. Each is

positioned by "raise-lower" buttons on the heater control panels. Since \
the regulators can not produce zero voltage, "on-off" buttons are
provided on the heater control panels. A listing of this "on-off" button
for a heater tabulated in Table 19.10 identifies use of an induction regu-
lator, with the one exception of the drain line heater. The regulators
have mechanical stops to limit the voltage output to 208 v. A

schematic wiring diagram for the induction regulator and a motor

operator are shown in Figure 19.7.

There are 38 of the induction regulators in use. Nine feed 30-kva
three-phase transformers which supply heater breaker panels. Eleven of
the regulators supply 10-kva single-phase transformers, one transformer
for each phase. The transformers are described below. The remaining
regulators feed power directly to the heater breaker panels. The os
number of heaters supplied by a regulator depends upon the size and OU
application of the particular heaters.

19.7.4.5 Three-Phase 30-kva Transformer. There are nine of
these transformers located on a platform behind the heater breaker
panels in the east-west hallway at the 840-ft level. Each is a
Jefferson Electric Company, Cat No. 223-194, "Powerformer", rated at
30-kva, three-phase, 60-cycle 480 4A/208-120 v, 36.1 amp and for 150°C
temperature rise. The transformer secondaries are provided with ground-
detection voltmeters mounted on the heater control panel. See ORNL

Dwg D-KK-C=-55137.

19.7.4.6 Single-Phase 10-kva Transformers. Thirty-three of these
transformers are mounted on the wall of the south side of the platform
mentioned above. Each is a Jefferson Electric Company, single-phase,
dry-type transformer, Cat No. 243-466, rated at 10-kva, 240-480-v
primary and 120-240-v secondary at a 150°C temperature rise. The
primaries are delta-connected and the secondaries are wye-connected
and grounded. See ORNL Dwg D-KK-C-55137.

19.7.4.7 Heater Breaker Panels. As stated above, an induction

 

regulator may supply several different heater circuits. In such cases,
each heater circuit is provided with a circuit breaker. Since most

of the breakers and panels are existing equipment adapted for the MSRE,
there is a variety of combinations of makes and styles.

Seven panels of circuit breakers are mounted on the east wall of
the north-south hallway. Two panels use fourteen Trumbull Electric
Company, Type TQL, or R, 120/208-v, three-phase breakers, having
various current ratings. Four panels use General Electric Company
Type TF 136020, 600-v, 3-pole breakers with several different current
ratings. There are three spare circuit breakers included.

Six panels of heater circuit breakers are located along the south
side of the east-west hallway. Eech panel contains four General Electric
Company Type CCB, three-phase, circuit breaker mounting panels, seventeen
of which are rated at 600 v and seven &t 120/208 v. The mounting panels
may contain up to 20 circuit breakers but only 5 to 8 are usually in
use. Four of the mounting panels have Westinghouse De-Ion, F Frame,
Style 1222033 circuit breakers. Thirteen panels use General Electric
Company Cat No. TF 136020 for 600 v; five use General Electric Type ES-93
and two General Electric Type EP-37,both rated at 125 wv.

19.7.5 Heater Leads

Electrical leads for the process heaters in the coolant cell are
multi-conductor No. 19/22 Type TW cable run in trays and conduit from
the heater control equipment to a junction box in the special equip-
ment room. From this box, multi-conductor No. 19/22 RH cable is run
in trays to the equipment in the cell.

Electrical leads for heaters in the reactor cell are multi-con-
ductor No. 19/22 Type TW cable, laid in trays between the heater con-
trol equipment and junction boxes in the south electric service area.
The leads for the drain tank cell are identical except that the junc-
tion boxes are located in the north electric service area. The con-
nections between the junction boxes and the cell equipment are made
with mineral-insulated, copper-sheather cables carrying three No. 10
or 12 wires. These pass through the cell walls in 3/h-in. pipe size
penetrations described in Section 19.8, following. The heater leads
passing through each penetration are listed in Table 19.11.

Inside the cells the cables are run in square duct, either to
junction boxes or to special 600-v, 50-amp, metal-and-ceramic, fe--
male disconnects. The disconnects, as illustrated in Figure 19.8,
are mounted in the cells convenient to the heater served and are
located in a manner to facilitate remote manipulation. The cell
ends of the cables are sealed with brazed bell-end housings. The \
outside ends are sealed with a General Cable Co. insulating cap and
threaded gland using a cold plastic sealing compound. There are
eight spare leads to the reactor cell and fourteen for the drain
tank cell.

Some of the process heaters which are designed for removal and
replacement have male, 600-v, 50-amp, 3-wire disconnect plugs mounted
directly on the removable unit. The connection between the matching
female disconnect and the porcelain terminal blocks in the Junction
boxes inside the cell is made with ceramic-beaded nickel alloy 99
wire, sheathed in 1/2-in. OD flexible steel hose.

Permanent heaters have the same type of flexible leads connected
directly to the heaters. The leads pass through junctions, where o

the heaters are connected in parallel, and continue to terminate in

male plugs, as illustrated in Figure 19.9. These are plugged into the
female disconnect fittings which are the terminus of the mineral-in-
sulated cables brought into the cell.

Table 19.11 also list the mineral-insulated cable data for each
heater lead, including the length, wire size and type of terminal
used. When single-phase heater circuits are required, one wire of

the three-wire cables is not connected.

19.8 Cell Wall Penetrations for Electrical Leads

Copper or stainless steel sheathed, mineral-insulated cables
are used for the electrical leads passing through the walls of the
reactor containment and drain tank cells. The cable passes through
individual pipe sleeves with compression fittings at each end to form
a leak-tight joint around the sheaths. Although gas diffusion through
the mineral insulation is considered negligible, the sheaths are also
sealed at each end. The number of cable sleeves at each penetration
is indicated in Tables 19.12 and 19.13. The heater leads in pene-

trations II (Bz) and III (Ry) are listed in detail in Table 19.11.

19.8.1 Sheathed Cable.

The mineral-insulated sheather cable is manufactured by the
General Cable Company. The catalog numbers for the various numbers
of conductors and wire sizes are listed in Table 19.14. Copper
sheathing is used on all MI cable leads.

The reactor cell end of a sheath is sealed with a brazed-on
Ceramaseal MI cable pothead, Cat. No. 805B-0110, or Olll, etc. The
end of the sheath outside the cell is sealed with a screwed-on pothead
filled with a cold-setting plastic insulating compound. See ORNL
Dwg. E-MM-Z-56238.

19.8.2 Cable Sleeves.

The MI cable passes through the cell walls in individual sleeves
of 3/8-in. IPS to 1-in. IPS, depending on the cable size. These pipes
have a minimum of a 2-1/2-in. offset at the midpoint through the

cell wall to prevent radiation from streaming through the opening.

The cable sleeves are grouped to pass through a poured concrete
plug mounted in existing penetrations in the reactor containment
vessel wall, or, in the case of the drain tank cell, are arranged
on a rectangular grid in the poured concrete of the 3-ft-thick east
wall of the cell. See ORNL Dwg D-KK-C-4O947 for the drain tank cell
sleeve layout. All drain tank cell cable sleeves are 3/b-in. IPS.

The cable sleeves have pipe couplings screwed to each end to
accept a General Cable Company compression gland. This fitting con-

sists of a compression sleeve and nut to effect a leak-tight seal

around the MI cable sheath. See ORNL D gs D-HH-B-40539 and Figure 19.9..

19.8.3 Reactor Cell Penetration Plug and Sleeve.

Existing reactor containment vessel penetrations consist of

sleeves, about 23-in. ID, with one end welded to the inner contain-
ment vessel wall and the other end to the wall of the outer vessel.
A corrugated bellows midway between the ends permits relative movement
between the two vessels, as shown in Figure 19.10 and on ORNL Dwg
D-KK-D-40976.

A plug, about 22-3/k-in. OD x 3 ft 5 in. long, fits into the

above-mentioned sleeve, and is welded to it on the outside end.

This plug consists of a carbon steel sleeve, about 22 in. ID of 3/8-in.

wall thickness, with end plates welded to it through which the cable
sleeves pass. These sleeves are welded to the plates at both ends,
using a trepanned groove at each weld. The space between the cable
sleeves inside the plug is filled with concrete. See ORNL Dwg
E-BB-D-4186k4.

20. BUILDING SERVICES

20.1 Potable Water

The source of potable water for Building T7503 is briefly described
in the discussion of the site, Section 3 and shown in Figure 3.3. The
water is normally obtained from the two 1.5 x 10 -gal reservoirs east
of the site, with flow from east-to-west in the 12-in. water main along
7500 Road. These reservoirs have a maximum water level elevation of
1,055 ft, providing a maximum pressure of about 93 psig at the 8Lo-ft
elevation in Building 7503. Potable water can also be provided by
west-to-east flow in the 6-in. main along 7500 Road, as indicated
schematically in Figure 20.1. Both sources connect to the same 6-in.
tee supplying the building.

The 6-in. potable water main enters the north end of Building T7503
at about the 840-ft elevation, where it then divides into two major
branches. One 4-in. main supplies all building services, such as water
closets, lavatories, sinks, showers, drinking fountains, etc. The
other 4-in. main provides water for the fire protection system, as

discussed in Section 20.10.
20.2 Process Water

Process water is supplied to the MSRE from the same potable water
mains at 7500 Road, but through a different 6-in. main leading from the
road to the east side of Bldg. 7503, as shown in Figure 20.1. There
are two shutoff valves outside the building at the 848-ft elev. A
back-flow preventer is installed in the line just inside the building
to relieve water to the building drain in event the building process
water pressure should exceed the supply pressure. Piping connections
and valves are provided for installing a spare back-flow preventer
should this be found necessary.

Distribution of the process water to the MSRE systems is discussed
in Section 15 and shown on the flowsheet, Figure 15.1 (ORNL Dwg
D-AA-A-40889).

20.3 Building Lighting

The 13.8-kv feeder lines supplying electric power to the MSRE site
are briefly described in Section 3 and shown in Figure 3.4. A bank of
three 250-kva, 13.8-kv to 480-v, transformers located on the east side
of Bldg 7503 supplies power for interior and exterior lighting, air
conditioners, and general office and building uses.

There are two main distribution panels. Panel No. 1, located at
the 840-ft level, has a capacity of 750 amps and supplies the 3-ton
and 10-ton cranes, the control room air conditioning equipment, the
main floor unit heater and fan, and the basement area unit heat and
fan. This panel also provides power for a 480-v/120-v-2L40-v transformer
supplying Panel 1A. This 750-amp panel distributes power to the control
room panels, lighting, the high-bay area roof vent fans, the sump pit
vent fan, and to Panel 1Al, which supplies the remainder of the light-
ing circuits.

Panel No. 2, of 325-amp capacity, supplies the remaining unit
heaters and vent fans and the 480-v building outlet receptacles.

The electric building services are shown on ORNL Dwg D-KK-C-4113kL.

20.4 Fencing

The MSRE site is a non-classified area and security guards are
not required. An 8-ft Cyclone fence serves as a perimeter enclosure.
Vehicular gates are provided at the northwest and southeast corners

and a 30-ft-wide main gate is located at the north end of the building.
20.5 Steam Supply

Saturated steam at 240 psig is supplied to Building T7503 from the
X-10 power plant through a 6-in. main as shown in Figure 3.5. The
pressure is reduced to 50 psig at a reducing valve station on the east
side of the building. The main then enters the building at about the
842-ft elevation, where it then divides into numerous branches supply-
ing steam throughout the building. Condensate is not returned but is
discharged to the building drains.

20.6 Roof, Foundation and Floor Drains

Storm water from the roof drains flows through a 6-in. line to
a catch basin located west of Bldg 7503 with an invert elevation of
837 ft, as indicated in Figure 20.2. A 12-in. reinforced concrete
pipe carries the water from the basin to a drainage area west of the
building, leading to Melton Hill Branch.

The various floor drains, etc., emptying into the sump room are
listed in Table 1hk.1. As described in Section 14, sump pumps deliver
the water to another catch basin, with an invert elevation of 843 ft,
to drain through a 12-in. reinforced concrete pipe to the same drainage

area mentioned above.
20.7 Sanitary Disposal

The Building 7503 sanitary waste system piping is directed to a
septic tank located about 100 ft west of the building at an elevation
of 840 ft. The drainage field is outside the perimeter fencing and
about 250 ft west of the building.

20.8 Air Conditioners

The main control room and the data processing room are air con-
ditioned by a Trane Company steam-heated coil, blower and filter unit
located at the 852-ft elevation in the hallway south of the control
room, and by an evaporator coil in the discharge ducting from the
heater unit. This direct-expansion coil is supplied with Freon-l1l2
from a 15-ton Worthington 2VC-6 reciprocating compressor-condenser
unit located at the 840-ft elevation.

Two 5-ton Trane Company "Climate Changers", located at the 852-

ft elevation, air condition the office areas.
20.9 Fire Protection System

The entire Building 7503 area, with the exception of the shielded
cells, the switch house, the fan house, and the battery room, is pro-

tected by a Grinnell Company water sprinkler system installed as part

of the MSRE project. Water for the system is obtained from the 6-in.
potable water line entering the north end of the building, see Figure
20.1. A 4-in. Siamese double-hose connection is provided outside the
north end of the building to attach a booster source of water for the
sprinkler system.

The 6-in. potable water main also has a U-in. branch connection
just inside the building with U-in. shutoff and check valves, to supply
six fire hose cabinets. The 4-in. hose supply can also be augmented
from the booster connection outside the building.

Under normal conditions the sprinkler system is valved off from
the water supply, the consequences of inopportune release of water
being more serious than the short delay in opening the valves if

vater is needed.
