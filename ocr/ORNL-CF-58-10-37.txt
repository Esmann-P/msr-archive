ABSTRACT

Breeding 1s expected to become a necessity in about Lo years
and in view of the 20 years development time and 20 years service
life of breeder reactors, develomment of such reactors at present
is timely. In plutonium breeders, the specific power is inherently
low and the doubling time long. This seems to prevent such breeders
from furnishing a large fraction of the energy demands of the
expending economy from uranium recoverable at: or about present cost.
UED3 breeders can be designed to the requirements of low inventory
and short doubling time, but the aqueous homogeneous reactor seems
to be the only type which can adequately meet these requirements.

I. HISTORY AND SCOPE OF THE STUDY

The Oak Ridge National Laboratory has conducted a study regarding breeding
on the m2 233 cycle. Object of the study was, on one hand, the importance
of breeding on this cycle and, on the other, a comparison of the various reactor
types with respect to their sultabllity as 3 3 breeders.

The study was prompted, in part, by temporary difficulties in the Aqueous
Homogeneous Reactor Program. These difficulties made it advisable to re-
investigate the validity of the old reasons which originally mede the aqueous
homogeneous reactor appear as one of the desirable reactor types, in order to
see vhether these reasons still hold. Breeding on the eI 1233 was one of

these reasons.

During the course of the study, the homogeneous reactor experiment;
operated in a far more satisfactory manner than anticipated at the time when
the study was originated, and this inereased expectation that the aqueous .
homogeneous reactor will be a desirable reactor type even without 233 breeding.
This made it less important to carry the study to its final form at the present
time. On the other hand, enough unexpected phenomena ere appearing in the
homogeneous reactor experiment to let it seem possible. that: Amporbant. past 1.
rameters for breeding, for instance potsorming. by, corrvsidni products, may, tink
out differently than enticipated. These uncertainties plus the recently de-
veloped large uncertainty in the 7 of #33 will be resolved in the near future.
The final form of the study should be postponed until these uncertainties are
resolved. This memo serves the purpose of an interim report.

The importance of breeding on the me y2 33 cycle depends primarily on
the importsnce of breeding in general, and secondly on the comparison of the
ia 8_py239 breeding cycle with the 22.3 3 cycle. As to the necessity
of breeding in general, E. D. Arnold and J. W. Ullmann have reached conclusions
which are reported in ORNL Ccr-58-8-16.1 As to the comparison between Pu

and #2 breeding a few remarks are contained in thé: present memo.

The desire to compare various reactor types as to their suitability
as UP” breeders resulted in an investigation by A. M. Perry, C. A. Preskitt,
and E. C. Halbert on the use of gas-cooled, graphite-moderated reactors for
this purpose. This investigation is now being extended to gas-cooled, heavy-
water-moderated reamctors.

E. Guth, S. Jaye and A. Sauer spent considerable time on the optimization
of the aqueous homogeneous reactor for PP breeding purposes (as contrasted
to the much discussed optimization ass to cost per kwh). This part of the
study is not finished and is most strongly affected by the above-mentioned
uncertainties.

II. THE NECESSITY FOR BREEDING

The fuel burmup cost in a straight burner, with present prices, is
about 3 wills/kvh. Thus a difference of 10% in breeding ratio amounts to
about 0.3 mills/kwh, since a reactor of breeding ratio p could buy fuel
amounting to 10% of its burnup for 0.3 mills/kvh and end up with the seme
amount of flssionable material as a reactor of breeding ratio fp + O.l. A
‘breeder and a converter of reasonably high conversion ratio will not differ
in conversion ratio by more than a small multiple of 10%, and the difference
in fuel-burmup cost will thus be smaller then the uncertainty in the esti-
mated power cost of a nuclear reactor. Fuel burnup cost on the basis of
present prices will thus not offer a strong reason in favor of breeding.

Any Justification for breeding thus involves an element of planning
for the future, a consideration of the time when the rissionsble material
recoverable at reasonable cost will be exhausted and the nuclear-power
econany depends on tapping the energy content of fertile material.

The Justificatlon for breeding is then analogous to the Justification
of nuclear-power production in general - nuclear-power production is Justi-
fied with a view to future depletion of fossile fuel, rather than with a
view to present prices. The long-range planning is needed in the wuclear-
power field because of the long development and design time - estimated at
4

20 years - and long life of power plants, estimated at 30 years. Thus,
if breeding will be necesséxy 20 + 30 = 50 years hence, it is not too
early to proceed with the development now. Otherwise » Wwe will have,
50 years hence, a large installed capacity which still could be used
except for the fact that it burns fissionable material which we can no
longer afford to burn. If it is the intention to scrap these reactors
before they are worn out » they would have to be burdened by larger
depreciation costs during ‘their use.

Any estimate of future supply and demand of fissioneble material is
very uncertain. Estimate of how much fissionable material will be avail
able, and at what price, depends on guesses as to future discoveries of
deposits and also on how much fissionable material the U. 8. will be able
to import from abroad, or will export to other countries. Demand depends
not only on the extremely uncertain requirements of the power economy it-
self, but to a large extent on the demand for nuclear-powered navel vessels ’
aircraft, rockets and weapons. Conceivably the latter could even become a
source rather than a sink of fissionsble material,as within the time periods
considered muiclear dissrmement and release of stock-piled material eould
become a reality. On the other hand, some of ‘the uses of nuclear energy
could be extremely wasteful of fissjonable material. An example for this
is the "bomb rocket" intended to propel a large weight into outer space by
a large number of "small" nuclear-bomb explosion behind the weight to be
lifted.

The impact of fusion on fission reactors is likewise very uncertain.
Conceivably, fusion could produce power cheaper than fission and put fission
power reactors out of business, or fusion based on the D-D reaction could be
a source of neutrons and hence of fissionable material. On the other hand,
large-scale power generation by fusion may be uneconomical, or unfeasible,
or dependent on outside supply of tritium and hence on fission reactors with
good neutron economy.

An accurate prediction of the supply and demand situation with respect
to fissionable material is obviously impossible, but it is also unnecessary
=-5-

for the purpose of deciding on the development of a breeder reactor. If
there is a reasonable probability of breeding being attractive during the
next 50 years, such development would be indicated. In fact, it 1s quite
likely that applications of nuclear energy wlll be proposed which consume
large amounts of fissionable material. The bomb rocket is an example. If
there 1s a prospect of fissicmable material beeaming scarce, the decision
regarding such proposals may very well depend on the feasibility of a suite
able breeder. In that cage, any effort spent on development of a breeder
would pay off in terms of hard information regarding the feasibility of the
breeder, and in a firmer basis for the above decision.

Even if breeding were of little interest for the nesr future in the
United States, it may well be important in foreign eountries with less
native supply of fisslonable material. The potential need of foreign
countries for power is one of the main Justifications for development of
miclear-pover reactors. An axralogous argument could justify the development
of breeders.

It appears that, for a breeder, the doubling time is the more important
concept than the breeding ratio. In part this is due to the somewhat
philosophical point that breeding ratio 1s not always easy to define. Breed-
ing ratlo 1s the ratio of the amount of fissionable material available at the
end of a fuel cycle to the amount of fissionable material at the beginning
of the cycle. If different parts of the fissionable material have different
histories, the "cycle" is a semewhat controversial concept. On the other
hand, the doubling time, thet is the time at which the emount of flssionable
material has doubled, is clearly defined.

More important than the above philosophical point 1s the fact that
the doubling time of the reactor can be compared directly with the doubling
time of the demand of the fission-power economy. If the reactor doubling
time is longer than the doubling time of the demand, then the reactors esnnot
keep up with demand. A future shortage of the supply of fissionable material
will be reflected back to earlier dates.
“ba

Doubling time has to defined as the time in which the whole fission-
able inventory of a reactor is doubled. This inventory includes fissionable
material contained in the reactor core, the blanket » the reprocessing plant,
etc. Reprocessing losses have to be taken into account.

In considering the reactor doubling time one should really consider
the average over the whole economy. Since there will be a large mumber of
reactors which will not breed(mobile reactors, for instance), the incentive
for short doubling time will be high in those reactors which can be made to

breed.

As to the actual mubers, Arnold snd Ullmann assume & U. S. nuclear-
power production which at first increases very rapidly as the nuclear-power
production increases its share of the total power production which, in turn,
is increasing, Finally, the nuclear-power production 1s assumed to increase
with the same doubling time as the total power production, this doubling
‘time being between 5 and 10 years. Assuming that the United States power
production can drew on the ores of the U. S. and Canada, the raw material
which could be recovered at up to twice the present cost would last until
1990-2000. From this, Arnold and Ullmsnn concluded that breeding will not
be necessary for about 30 to 40 years.

As has been discussed above, a case can be made for the development of .
breeder reactors up to 50 years shead of the time when breeding is necessary.
Thus the figures of Arnold and Ullmann seem to show that development of
breeders is quite timely at present. This conclusion is made even stronger
if considerstion is given to the possibility that the non-power use of
fissionable material, export of Canadian ore to other parts of the world,
ete., could advance the date at which breeding will be a necessity.

Since the power economy is expected to have a doubling time of 5 to
10 years, the doubling time of the breeders should be the same s or preferably
shorter to make up for non-breeding uses of fissionable material.

Arnold and Ullmann point out, however, that other factors are more
important than breeding. Among these factors is high thermal efficlency,
which means high operating temperature of the reactor. This deserves
-7-

underlining. A reactor with high thermal efficiency, which does not breed,
uses a relatively small amount of fisslonable material, and, though it does
not convert sufficient fertile into fisslonable material, it leaves the
energy comtent of same fertile material untouched, to be available for future
users who are ingenious enough to extract it. A low-thermal-efficiency
breeder replaces the fissionable material it uses, but it uses a relatively
large amount of. fissionable, and hence fertile atoms, snd whatever is wasted
is gone forever. In this respect, high temperature reactors, like the
‘liquid-metel fuel reactor and the molten-salt reactor are more desirable even
if they are no breeders.

Another parameter of great importance in an expanding nuclear-power -
economy 1s, as Arnold and Ullmann point out, a low inventory. Low inventory
is closely connected with short doubling time, the importance of which has
bemmentioned above, A further drastic example of this will be mentioned
below.

Arnold and Ullmenn emphasize that there 1s an enormous supply of
uranium, estimated at 100,000,000 tons for the U. S. and Canada, which could
be recovered at up to $100/1b U;0g. This supply will not be exhausted within
a foreseeable future, and even if a breeding progrem fails to produce enough
fisslonable material for the energy requirements, only an increase in power
cost ,but no catastrophic power shortage,wlll result.

III. COMPARISON OF PLUTONIUM AND U°27 BREEDING

From a practical viewpoint, the main difference betieen plutoniwm end
3 breeding lies in the inventory of fissionable material. This inventory
is much larger for plutonium breeders than for 23 3 breeders. Large
inventory is connected with low specific power (kw/kg of fissiomable material)
and long doubling times. The large inventory is mainly a consequence of
basle physical facts: because of the energy dependence of the n of Pe,
plutonium breeders have to operate at high neutron energies where the cross
sections are small and where it takes many plutonium atoms to catch a
neutron with sufficient probability before it escapes or slows down. A
-8-

contributing cause of the large inventory is the intricate core structure
of fast breeders and the resulting large hold-up of flssionable material
external to the reactor.

The specific power of the Enrico Fermi Fast Breeder Reactor is 149 kw/kg
of total inventory of fisssionable material,” or approximetely 1 kw/kg of
natural uranium (assuming that essentially all ue» contained in natural
uranium could be used in the reactor). The U. S. and Canadian uranium re-
sources recoverable at present prices are, according to Arnold and Ullmann,
550,000 tons, which would allow the production of 550,000 Mw (thermal) s Or
1.6 x 10%6 Btu/year. The time when this would have covered the total energy*
input of the United States alone has » according to Putnam,” passed around
1910.

At a given specific power, the energy production can increase only at
a rate determined by the doubling time. At 149 ku/kg, the time of 100% burnup
would be 1h years. Hence » with any reasonable breeding gain, the doubling
time of the reactor, and hence of its power production, would be around
100 years. In practice the non-breeding uses of flssionable material would
more than use up the small yearly production of plutonium in the breeders.

With the above figures, the plutonium breeders could supply only a small
part of the energy requirements of the U. S., and because of thelr long
doubling time, they would fall further and further behind the rapidly increasing
demand,

The Te breeders, on the other hand, operate best in the thermal region
where the cross sections are large, and fewer atoms suffice to prevent an
adequate mumber of neutrons from escaping. More important, atoms other than
fissionable ones can be used to do a large part of the neutron scattering and

*Thus when other power sources were used up and we had to rely on the above
uranium resources and the above specific pover, we would have to revert to
the 1910 standard of total energy consumption. Total energy means all the
energy, including the part now derived from fossile fuel for space heating,
vehicle propulsion, ete.

escape preventing. Neutron-energy degradation by these "other atoms" does
not have to be prevented and is in fact desired. Thus, the critical mass
and inventory in a 3 breeder can be made very low, and the specific power
very high. (The design parameters of a 300 Mwe agqueous-hamogeneous reactor
station call for about 4500 thermal kw/kg of fisslonable material. t With
this specific power a breeding gain of 8.2% would correspond to 5 years
doubling time.)

Unless these design data are upset by low 9 values resulting from new
measurements, or by unexpected changes necessitated by new experiences with
the homogeneous reactor experiment, the power generated from the available
5 resources could be considerably higher than with the fast plutonium
breeder, and after conversion to U->- the doubling time would be in line with
the doubling ‘time of the muclear-power economy.

The above 1s not meant to imply that the specific power of the Enrico
Ferml Fast Breeder Reactor is the maximum that can be achieved in a fast
plutonium breeder. However, in view of the somewhat fundsmentsl consider—
* atlons which lead to low specific power in this type of reactor, it is un-
likely that the specific power can be raised by a large enough factor to
satisfy the expanding power economy, end to compete in this respect with
‘thermal NE breeders. At the very least, it seems considerably simpler to
achleve the required specific power with thermal © breeders.

Another important point of comperison for the breeding cycles is ‘the
availability of the fertile materials, U22° for the plutonium cycle and
ha? for the 233 cycle. For the world as a whole, the amount of high
grade ore are about the same for uranium and thorium.” The largest deposits
of thorium are, however, in Brazil and India, and both countries have at
present embargoes against the export of thorium. Whether this is serious for
‘the time period under consideration in this Study is debateble. The

table, 16 kg have been added to allow for holdup in the "Chem Plamt",” etc.

North American continent, U. S. and Canada, have about 200,000 tons of hiah
grede thorium ore, which is a fraction of the high grade uranium-ore supply
but still of the same order of magnitude and very substantial. If all
converted into energy this supply would correspond to 17 x 1018 Btu which is
quite comparable to the whole fossile fuel supply of the U. S. and Canada.

It would cover, according to Arnold and Ullmann's figures, the anticipated

Us S. requirement of electrical energy well beyond the year 2000. Considering
the U. S. alone, the known thorium supply is relatively small, but this is
probably largely due to the lack of interest in finding thorium.

In summary of the supply situation there are considerably less thorium
deposits in the U. S. than uranium deposits 3 but if thorium were needed, it
could be found in sufficient quantities either by- further exploration or by
import from Canada, if not from India or Brazil.

As far as price goes the 238 is obviously cheaper than thorium because
it is obtainable from the tailings of a production which is needed by
users other then commercial power plants. However, the price of the fertile
material makes an insignificant contribution to the cost of power derived
from a breeder. )

Both recycled thorium end plutonium are radiation hazards. However,
there seems to be no significent difference in the handling of the two
substances.

A strong case can be made for parallel development of the plutonium and
v3 breeding cycles. Nelther cycle has been demonstrated to glve breeder
reactors of sufficiently low inventory end doubling time. Gambling on one
cycle - with the possibility that the other cycle would have been the only
successful one - would be dangerous to the extent that breeding is necessary.
More important, the optimm development might very well involve a start with
a low-inventory, short-doubling-time 2 breeder which would allow, with a
Limited supply of fissionable material, to produce & substantial amount of
power and a substantial yearly increase in the power production. With the
fissionable material supply increased by these breeders » high inventory
Plutonium breeders could be put into operation in order to tap the 28 supply.

IV. COMPARISON OF DIFFERENT REACTOR TYPES FOR U°2° BREEDING

As mentioned in Section I, Perry, Preskitt and Halbert investigated the
use of gas-cooled, graphite-moderated reactors for #3 breeding. The
breeding gain turned out to be small, if not negative, mainly because of the
dilemma between, on one hand, large C:U ratio and large sbsorption in graphite,
and, on the other hand, a smaller C:U ratio with insufficient moderation and
lower n -velues corresponding to higher neutron energies. The inventory was
of course large. With respect to breeding, the gas-cooled, graphite-moderated
reactors are not competitive with the agueous homogeneous reactors.

The same authors are now investigating gas-cooled, D,0-moderated reactors,
with some misgivings about the absorptions in the zlrconlum-pressure tubes.
Ligquid-metal fuel reactors end molten-salt reactors are bound to have large
inventories and, at best, low breeding gains, and are no good as breeders for
this reason. Their high-thermal efficiencies speek, however, in their favor,
even if conservation of fissionable and fertile material is made the primary
consideration (see Section I).

In view of the uncertainty in the 1 -values, 1t is not planned to extend
in the immediate future the calculations regarding vr? breeders, other than
the aqueous homogeneous reactors, beyond the already scheduled computations
of the gas-cooled, D0-moderated reactors.
