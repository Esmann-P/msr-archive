R. W. Swindeman

ABSTRACT

Tensile, creep, and relaxation tests were performed on INOR-8, a nickel-
base alloy developed for use in the Molten-Salt Reactor. The mechanical
properties are summarized and discussed in relation to the composition,
microstructure, and environment.

The results indicate that the minimum strength properties of INOR-8
are sufficient to permit the use of workable design stresses up to 1300°F,
although certain areas are pointed out where additional information is

desirable.
INTRODUCTION

The chemical, metallurgical, and nuclear properties required of a
structural material for use in the Molten-Salt Reactor brought about the

g. (ref 1) As soon as

development of a nickel-base alloy, designated INOR-
commercial heats of this material became available, mechanical properties
studies were initiated by several laboratories. This report summarizes the
results obtained by the Mechanical Properties Group of the Metallurgy
Division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

The testing program had two major objectives. The first was to obtain
design data for INOR-8 under conditions similar to those in the Molten-Salt
Reactor, while the second was to study the effect of various metallurgical
factors on the strength and ductility of the alloy. Most of the testing was

done on two heats of material, designated SP 16 and SP 19. The program

included tensile, creep, and relaxation tests at temperatures in the range of
interest for the Molten-Salt Reactor. The program is supplemented by
mechanical properties data obtained by several other groups at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory, the Haynes-Stellite Company, and the Battelle Memorial
Institute.
Because the range of testing techniques and conditions was broad, this
report has been separated into sections covering each type of test. Repre-
sentative data are shown and the variations discussed. More detailed data
are supplied in the Appendix. Where pertinent, the mechanical properties

data obtained by other investigators will be discussed.

MATERTAL

Procurement and Chemistry

 

Five heats of wrought material have been tested. These are SP 16,
SP 19, M-1566, 8M-1, and 1327. Two heats, SP 16 and SP 19, were supplied
by the Haynes-Stellite Company and were air melted. Two other air-melted
heats, M-1566 and 8M-1, were procured from the Westinghouse Electric Company.
Heat 1327 is identical to 8M-1, except that it was vacuum-arc remelted.

The chemical analyses of these heats are presented in Table I. The
composition specified for INOR-8 is also given and a comparison of the analyses
reveals that the most significant variation occurs in the carbon content which
ranges from 0.02% for SP 16 to 0.14% for 8M-1 and 1327. Only SP 19 and M-1566
are within the present carbon specifications.

Annealing Response and Microstructure

 

The annealing treatment was chosen to be above the anticipated brazing
temperature but below the temperature where excessive grain growth occurs.
For most heats this treatment was for 1 hr at 2100°F. Heat SP 16 developed
a coarse-grain size under these conditions, however, and the temperature was
reduced to 2000°F for most of the test series on this heat. Even this treat-
ment produced a relatively coarse-grain size.

The variations in the ASTM grain-size numbers and the Rockwell B hardness
numbers corresponding to the annealing treatment are shown in Table IL. Rod

stock of SP 19 exhibits two grain sizes, ASTM 1-3 and 5-7, corresponding to

two different rods designated SP 19-1 and SP 19-3, respectively. With the
exception of SP 19-1 the high carbon heats have the finest grain size and
highest hardness numbers.

Photomicrographs of the annealed sheet specimens are shown in Figs. 1
through 5. The microstructures reveal an equiaxed grain structure with
stringers and clusters of a second phase through the grains and along the
grain boundaries. This phase has been identified as a (Ni, Mo)¢ C carbide
and appears to increase with increasing carbon content. The size, number,

and distribution of these carbides vary from heat to heat.
TENSILE PROPERTIES

Equipment and Procedure

 

Tensile tests were performed in air on sheet and rod material. The
sheet specimens were 0.063-in. thick, 0.5-in. wide, with a 3-in. uniform
gage length. A detailed description of the specimen design has been pre-

sented by Douglas and Manly.’

Rod specimens were of the standard ASTM design
for 0.505- or 0.357-in.~diam gage sections. Tests were performed on a
Baldwin-Southwark hydraulic testing machine having a 120,000-1b capacity.

In all cases the extension rate was 0.05 in. per min.
Results

Typical Data: A series of tensile curves for INOR-8 rod specimens
(SP 16 annealed at 2000°F) is shown in Fig. 6. At elevated temperatures it
is evident that yielding takes place quite abruptly and very little work
hardening occurs during the initial stages of plastic flow. The stress at
the proportional limit and the 0.2% offset yield strength (indicated by the
dash on the tensile curve) exhibit very little temperature dependence between
1000 and 1400°F. This type of behavior was observed for all of the heats
tested. The tensile strength and elongation are considerably more temperature
dependent, as illustrated in Fig. 7.

Effect of Composition and Grain Size: The tensile properties for sheet

specimens of four heats—SP 16, SP 19, M-1566, and 8M-1 (data for SP 19 and

 

8M-1 are for 0.045-in.-thick sheet and were taken from a test serles performed
for Inouye?) are presented in Figs. 8, 9, and 10. The data shown in Fig. 8
indicate that the tensile strengths do not vary greatly from heat to heat.
Although high-carbon and fine-grained heats are slightly stronger than
coarse-grained and low-carbon heats, the tensile strengths for all heats of
the sheet specimens fall within a narrow scatterband.
Figure 9 shows the variation in the yield strength from heat to heat.
Heat 8M-1, high in carbon with a fine-grain size, exhibits the highest yield
strength; while SP 16, low in carbon and coarse grained, is the weakest. -
Values range from 25,000 psi to 38,000 psi at 1300°F.

Tensile elongation data are presented in Fig. 10. The elongation is
constant up to 1000°F, but rapidly drops to a minimum value near 1500°F, the
highest temperature investigated. The elongation decreases with increasing
carbon content and/or decreasing grain size with the exception of M-1566.
Heat M-1566 is the least ductile above 1000°F. A summary of these and
additional tensile data are given in Tables A-1 and A-2 in the Appendix.

Effect of Notches: Tests were performed on notched-rod specimens of
SP 19-3 at several temperatures. These specimens had a gage diameter of
0.357 in. and a notch radius of 0.005 in.

As in the case of most metals, the effect of the notch is to increase
the ultimate tensile strength; but at the lower temperatures, the increase
for INOR-8 is only slight. The notched to unnotched strength ratios at room
temperature, 1000, 1200, and 1500°F are 1.08, 1.07, 1.13, and 1.38,
respectively. Data for these tests are presented in Table A-3 of the Appendix.

Effect of Aging: A few aging tests were performed on notched specimens
of SP 19-3. The selected treatments were 200 hr at 1200°F, 40 hr at 1650°F,
and 4 hr at 1800°F. Data are summarized in Table A-3 of the Appendix. The
results do not indicate any significant aging effect, although the notch

strength ratios are very close to unity below 1500°F.

Data are also reported in Table A-3 of the Appendix for smooth rods of
coarse-grained SP 19-1 aged 40 hr at 1650°F. No change in the strength
properties is evident, but the elongation at 1500°F has increased from 20
to 50%. This improvement appears to be associated with coarsening of the
carbides and evidence of this coarsening is presented in the section of the
report covering creep.

Effect of Carburization: A few tensile tests were performed on smooth-

 

and notched-rod specimens of SP 19-3 which had been carburized in sodium-
graphite for LO hr at 1650°F. This treatment resulted in a high-carbon case
which penetrated to a depth of about 0.010 in. Data for smooth rods are
compared to noncarburized material in Fig. 11. Up to 1200°F carburization
results in a slight increase in the yield strength and a decrease in the
tensile strength, elongation, and reduction in area. Data for notched
specimens parallel this behavior with the notch strength ratio being less
than unity when the ratio is in respect to the unnotched-uncarburized
specimens. Summary data are reported in Table A-3 of the Appendix.

Fracture Characteristics and Microstructure: Metallographic studies

 

were performed on the rod specimens of SP 19-3. This study revealed that the
temperature at which the ductility begins to drop corresponds to the tempera-
ture at which grain-boundary fracture begins to occur. Below 1000°F, the
fracture is predominately transgranular as shown in Fig. 12, while above this
temperature the fracture becomes intergranular as indicated by Fig. 13. The
effect of carburization on fracture is to change the low-temperature mechanism
to one of intergranular fracture. Figures 14 and 15 show the fracture at the
surface for carburized and noncarburized specimens tested at room temperature.
The intergranular fracture which occurs at room temperature in the carburized
zone becomes transgranular in the interior of the specimen where no carburiza-

tion occurs.

CREEP PROPERTIES

Program
Creep tests were performed in molten salt and alr between 1100 and 1800°F.
Since the maximum temperature for long-time service was not expected to exceed

1300°F, most of the tests were conducted in the 1100 to 1300°F temperature

few tests were performed on the other three heats for comparative purposes.

Equipment and Procedure for Tests in Salt

 

Sheet specimens were tested in molten-salt No. 107; the nominal
composition of which, in terms of the mole percentage, is NaF-11.2, KF-4l,
LiF-45.3, and UF,—2.5. A static system was used, but in some cases the
salt was periodically changed. The testing chambers were constructed of
Inconel, Hastelloy B, or Hastelloy C and are described together with other
equipment in a report written by Douglas and Manly. '

Extension measurements were obtained from a dial gage which recorded
the upward travel of the pull rod on the exterior of the testing chamber.
Such a technique lead to scatter and inaccuracies in the strain measure-
ments especially for strains less than 0.5%. This point should be

considered in evaluating the low-strain creep data reported for molten-

salt tests.

Results for Tests in Salt

 

Typical Data: Typical creep curves for tests in salt at 1300°F are
shown in Fig. 16. These are for SP 16. (Unless otherwise stated, SP 16
has been given a l-hr anneal at 2000°F.) Creep occurs in the three
classical stages: transient, steady, and accelerating. The change in
strain rate during the transient period is quite small and similarly, the
acceleration in creep before failure is not large. Most tests in salt
exhibited this type of curve, although many of the low stress tests on
SP 16 at 1500°F and above exhibited a continually decreasing creep rate
to rupture.

Figure 17 is a comparison of the creep curves for the five heats at
1300°F and 20,000 psi. With the exception of heat M-1566, the curves show
fairly good agreement. Heat 8M-1 exhibits the lowest creep rate while
heat 1327 is the most ductile. Heat M-1566 exhibits an inflection at the
end of transient creep and accelerates immediately to rupture after a

short time and small strain.

Summary Data: A digest of the creep data obtained from tests in molten
salt is presented in Table A-L of the Appendix. Data include the time to
specified creep strains for each test conducted. These values were taken
from smooth curves as plotted on log-log coordinates. The rupture life
and elongation are also reported. Summary data taken from this table are
presented in Figs. 18, 19, and 20. Figure 18 is a log-log plot of the
stress vs time to 1% creep strain. Scatterbands have been drawn to cover
the data corresponding to various temperatures. At 1100, 1200, and 1300°F
these bands are nearly parallel, while the slopes at 1650 and 1800°F are
apparently different. Air test data indicate a break in the curves above
20,000 psi, near the yield strength, but the data obtained from tests in
molten salt exhibit too much scatter to define this break clearly.

Figure 19 is a log-log plot of the stress vs the minimum creep rate.
The scatterbands exhibit the same characteristics as Fig. 18, except that:
(1) the scatterband for 1100°F data is not parallel to that at 1200 and
1300°F, and (2) the data at 1500°F and above show considerably greater
stress dependency.

Figure 20 is a log-log plot of the stress vs the rupture life.
Scatterbands resemble those for 1% creep at 1100, 1200, and 1300°F, but
here again a considerable stress dependency occurs at 1500°F and above.

The rupture ductility values recorded for INOR-8 are lowest at 1100°F.
The minimum value listed in Table A-4 of the Appendix is 1.7% which
corresponds to 12,725 hr at 1100°F. Ductilities are greater at the higher
temperatures, but the rupture lives corresponding to these ductilities
are short. The maximum value reported is 22% for heat 1327 at 1800°F
after 23 hr.

Microstructure: Photomicrographs are shown in Figs. 21 through 25
for the various heats of INOR-8 tested in molten salt at 1300°F and
20,000 psi. (The creep curves for this series are shown in Fig. 17.)
Fracture occurs by intergranular cracking, but the grain size apparently
has not affected the rupture life at this temperature. Heat 1327, for
example, exhibits a structure and crack pattern similar to heat M-1566,
yet one lasted 1177 hr and the other only 180 hr. Heat SP 16, which is
coarse grained as compared to heats 1327 and M-1566, failed after 882 hr,

a time between the two extremes.

Photomicrographs showing the effect of environment and exposure time
on the microstructure are presented in Figs. 26 through 33. These structures
are for SP 16 at temperatures of 1100, 1200, 1300, 1500, 1650, and 1800°F.
A precipitate forms at all temperatures and becomes coarser and more
evident as the temperature and time increase. There does not appear to be
evidence of severe corrosion, but surface roughening occurs at nearly all

temperatures.

Equipment and Procedure for Tests in Air

 

The creep program in air consisted of a series of tests on rod and sheet
specimens of SP 16 at 1250°F and on sheet specimens of SP 19 at several
temperatures. All specimens in these programs were annealed 1 hr at 2100°F.
Tests were performed in Arcweld Model C.E. lever arm creep machines.
Extensometers were clamped on the gage length of standard 0.063-in.-thick
sheet specimens and on the shoulders of the standard 0.505-in.-diam rod

specimens.

Results for Sheet Specimens in Air

 

Typical Data: Typical creep curves for SP 16 in air at 1250°F are
shown in Fig. 34. In contrast to the tests in molten salt, no transient
creep occurs. The initial stage is rather one of nil or slowly accelerating
creep which in some cases extends as long as 1000 hr. For several tests a
period of slightly negative creep was even observed. This nil creep rate,
of course, made it impossible to define a minimum creep rate in the usual

sense; hence, only plots of the 1% creep and rupture data are presented here.

Summary Data: Summary-type data taken from Table A-5 of the Appendix
are shown in Figs. 35 and 36 and include data reported by the Haynes-Stellite
Company for fine-grained SP 16 (ASTM L-6). Figure 35 is a log-log plot of
the stress vs the time to 1% creep strain in which scatterbands have been
drawn which cover most of the data. In contrast to the tests in molten salt,
the scatterbands at 1500 and 1700°F are roughly parallel to the low-
temperature data. Figure 36 is a log-log plot of the stress vs the time to
rupture. Here again the scatterbands have been drawn to cover all data,
although the data obtained by the Haynes-Stellite Company indicate greater
creep strength at 1300°F and less strength at 1700°F.

The creep ductilities for tests in air are low and values range from
2.7% at 1200°F to 14.5% at 1700°F. Many of the failures in sheet specimens

were under the knife edge of the extensometer clamp.

Microstructure: Photomicrographs for two SP 16 specimens tested in
air at 1250°F are shown in Figs. 37 and 38. Here, after 4562 hr in test

at 15,000 psi, there is evidence of a fine precipitate.

Results for Rod Specimens in Air

 

Data for rod specimens of SP 16 tested at 1250°F are given in A-6
of the Appendix. A series of creep curves are shown in Fig. 39, and
summary-type data are presented in Fig. 40. The creep curves show a
short period of accelerating creep followed by a steady creep rate. Rod

specimens are stronger than the sheet at the higher stresses.

Effect of Aging and Carburization

 

Several creep tests on specimens aged 50 hr at 1300°F have been
performed in molten salt. Heat SP 16 was tested at 1500 and 1800°F and
heat 1327 was tested at 1200, 1500, and 1800°F. These data are included
in Table A-4 of the Appendix. Data do not indicate any significant aging
effects, although there does appear to be an increase 1n creep rate and
loss in rupture life at 1800°F.

Several creep tests have been performed on heavily carburized material
and these are discussed in another report.o Typical results are plotted in
Fig. 41 for untreated and carburized SP 16, in this instance tested at
20,000 psi in molten salt at 1300°F. A curve for a specimen tested in a
carburizing atmosphere is also shown. The creep rate for the carburized
specimen is nearly half of that for the untreated specimen, while the
creep rate of the specimen tested in the carburizing atmosphere is inter-
mediate. It should be noted, however, that the early portion of the curves
(for strains below 1%) do not reflect the over-all trends which have just

been summarized.

RELAXATION PROPERTIES

Equipment and Procedure

 

Relaxation tests were performed on 0.357-in.-diam rod specimens of

9

SP 16, with equipment described by Kennedy and Douglas. The tests were
performed in air over a temperature range from 1150 to 1600°F. Extensions
between 0.05 and 0.2% were employed, although most tests were conducted at

0.05 or 0.1%. Both of these strains are in the elastic region.
Results

Typical data are illustrated in Figs. 42 and 43. These curves show
selected data at 1200, 1300, 1400, 1500, and 1600°F for extensions of
0.05 and 0.1%. Additional data are provided in Table A-7 of the Appendix.

The curves at 1200 and 1300°F reveal an interesting phenomenon which
was common in relaxation testing of INOR-8. That is, the stress often
exhibits an increase, or at least no decrease, for some time after loading.
This "induction period" may be caused by the same phenomenon which produces
negative or nil creep during the initial period of creep testing in air.
The length of this induction period depends upon the temperature. Near
1200°F it appears to last between 10 and 50 hr, while above 1300°F it is
present only for a fraction of an hour. At the end of this period
relaxation occurs in the normal manner, with the relaxation rate decreasing

with time.

DISCUSSION

For an alloy, whose composition and microstructure are permitted to
vary as much as in the case of INOR-8, reasonable variations in the mechanical
properties should also be expected. In general, the tensile properties con-
form to expectations. The creep behavior, on the other hand, is not so
easily understood. Variations do occur with changes in composition and micro-

structure, but creep-stress and temperature complicate the behavior pattern.

At 1100 and 1200°F there are indications that the creep strength improves
with increasing carbon and decreasing grain size. At 1300°F, however,
heat M-1566, which has an "average" composition, is the weakest while the
high-carbon and fine-grained heats are not significantly stronger than
Sp 16. Above 1300°F further variations arise which cannot be clarified
without additional data. It is possible, of course, that 1300°F is a
transition temperature above which the coarse-grained SP 16 is stronger
than the fine-grained heats.

There are at least two additional features of the microstructure which
may also have an influence on the creep properties. These are substructure
and carbide precipitation. Different substructures developed in SP 16
for anneals at 2000, 2100, or 2150°F (the treatment used by Haynes-
Stellite) might explain why the initial stage of creep in some cases is
transient while in other cases it is accelerating. Parker" has shown
some of the effects which substructure can have in this regard.

Carbide precipitation could also play a role in creep. The very
slight contraction, sometimes observed in SP 16 during the initial period
of creep or relaxation tests, might be explained by assuming a volume
contraction associated with precipitation. Furthermore, the continually
decreasing strain rates in SP 16 for low stresses at 1500°F and above
might be explained by the strengthening produced through the precipitation
and coarsening of the carbides along the grain boundaries. Unfortunately
no coarse-grained, high-carbon heats were tested at these low stresses to
check this possibility.

It should also be remembered that carbon is not the sole compositional
variable. The disposition of the boron in SP 16, for example, has not been
established but it is possible that this element could have an influence on
the behavior of this heat.

Attempts have been made to establish a time-temperature correlation
for creep and rupture properties of INOR-8. Haynes-Stellite presents
Tarson-Miller plots but a correlation can also be obtained for the Dorn-

Shepard Parameter. The activation energy for creep, relaxation, and

recrystallization were calculated to be near 83,200 cal/mole-°K. This
activation energy has been used to correlate the creep data at all temperatures
and stresses. Data for tests in molten salt and air are shown in Fig. Lh.

This is a plot of the Dorn-Shepard parameter for 1% creep strain against the
log of stress. Most of the creep data for INOR-8 is included in the plot
although the various heats are not distinguished from one another. The
scatterband has been drawn to include most of the data, but it appears that

the data for air tests often fall near the top of the band and data for salt
tests lie near the bottom at the low stresses.

The data obtained by the Mechanical Testing Group constitute a major
portion of the mechanical property data available on INOR-8. Significant
contributions have been made by other investigators, however, and their results
should be considered in evaluating the over-all strength properties of INOR-8.
For example, the Haynes-Stellite Company reports stress-rupture, tensile,
impact, and creep data for both cast and wrought SP 16. Inouye’? has per-
formed aging studies on several heats of INOR-8 for temperatures up to
1400°F and times as long as 10,000 hr and the Welding and Brazing Group3r 1H 15
has studied the weld metal tensile and bending properties of several heats.

The cold work and recrystallization characteristics of SP 16 have been

17

reported by Spruie11 © while Carlson” has conducted high-temperature fatigue

tests on SP 19. Finally, Cook and Jansen® are presently investigating the
effect of carburization on the tensile and creep properties of SP 16.

Most of the data accumulated on INOR-8 indicate that the strength
properties at 1300°F and below are comparable to those of the stainless

steels. Bince the creep and tensile properties of the stainless steels,
with a few exceptions, vary sharply with annealing treatment an actual
numerical comparison between INOR-8 and these alloys is not too significant.
Possibly one of the fairest comparisons which could be made would be for
types 316 and 304 stainless steel and INOR-8 rod material in air at 1250°F.
The stress to produce a minimum creep rate of 10779, /nr (usually stated
0.01% in 1000 hr), a criterion on which high-temperature design stresses
are often based, is about 5250 psi for type 316 stainless steel, 3200

for type 30k stainless steel,” and 5350 psi for INOR-8. If the stress

to produce 1% creep in 100,000 hr were selected from the salt data, however,

the value for INOR-8 would be 4300 psi. This figure is still above the .
design stress for type 304 stainless steel. It is possible to be even

more conservative by selecting the lower stress for the design criterion -
or interest from the scatterbands shown in the summary data curves.
Fractions of the minimum observed yield strength and tensile strength
could also be obtained in accordance with the Unfired Pressure Vessel
code. “0 Such data have been plotted in Fig. 45 and compared with design
stresses for type 316 stainless steel.

Although the tensile and creep ductility do not directly enter into
the design of a component intended for long-time service, they can be
considered important from a safety viewpoint. The tensile ductility up
to 1300°F appears to be satisfactory for wrought, cast, and weld metal,
but Cook and Jansent® report a figure of only 7.75% for SP 16 carburized
at 1600°F and tested at room temperature. In addition, the low-notch
strength ratios and low-relaxation rates may suggest poor ductility or
notch sensitivity in stress rupture. The poorest creep ductilities occur
at 1100°F, but are still above 1% even after more than 12,000 hr of
exposure. To determine the maximum effect to be expected, one should
study the tensile properties of specimens after creep testing under the
worst conditions.

There are several other questions which have not been completely
answered regarding the mechanical properties of INOR-8. The more important
of these are:

1. What are the effects of grain size and annealing treatment
on the long-time creep properties?

2. What is the notch strength ratio in stress rupture?

3. How significant is the effect of notches on the fatigue
strength?

4. How do the creep properties of weld metal compare with
wrought materials?

5. What is the effect of irradiation on the mechanical
properties?

6. What is the effect of carburization on the mechanical
properties during service?

Mechanical property data which answer these questions might eliminate
the use of unnecessary safety factors in the design of a reactor. This,
in turn, would reduce the material required and thereby decrease over-

all structural costs.

CONCLUSIONS

The results of this investigation reveal the range of tensile and
creep properties which INOR-8 can be expected to exhibit when the compo-
sition and grain size are permitted to vary significantly. Tor low-
temperature applications a fine-grain size produces the best strength
properties, although even the weakest of the coarse-grained material is
superior to many of the stainless steels.

Since most of the long-time creep tests were performed on relatively
coarse-grained material, a clear picture of the range in creep strength
cannot be presented. The short-time data, however, reveal that at
1100°F the fine-grained material is slightly stronger while at tempera-
tures above 1300°F a coarse-grain size is desirable. The long-time
creep properties of coarse-grained INOR-8 are better than many of the

stainless steels.

 
 

- 63 -

The only area of concern regarding this alloy is that of ductility.
Certain heats exhibit low values, especially at temperatures above 1300°F
for tensile tests and around 1100°F in creep tests. This behavior points
toward possible problems should carburization or notches occur in the
metal. The effect of these two variables on the stress-rupture and

tensile properties is a subject that should be studied further.
