TENSILE PROPERTIES OF HASTELLOY N WELDED AFTER IRRADIATION
H. E. McCoy, R. W. Gunkel, and G. M. Slaughter

ABSTRACT

Fusion welds affecting 75% of the cross section were
made in small tensile samples (0.125 in. in diameter) of
Hastelloy N irradiated to thermal fluences up to
9.4 X 102° neutrons/cm?. All of the unirradiated samples
and 67% of the irradiated samples were satisfactorily welded
using a specialized technique developed for this program.
Surface contamination is suspected to be the cause of the
unsuccessful welds in the irradiated samples. The welded
irradiated samples generally had as good tensile properties
at 25 and 650°C as the irradiated base metal. The weld
metal deformed appreciably at 650°C and made a significant
contribution to the overall fracture strain. The fracture
location in the irradiated samples tested at 650°C shifted
from the weld metal to the base metal following the post-
weld anneal of 8 hr at 870°C. The porosity which was
observed near the fusion line of the irradiated samples
probably results from transmuted helium bubbles, but this
did not seem to affect the location of the fracture.

 

INTRODUCTION

The maintenance and repair of nuclear systems will frequently
involve cutting and rewelding pipes and components that have been irra-
diated. The prospect of these repairs raises the obvious questions of
how such welds can be made and what are their mechanical properties.

It is this latter question that will be discussed in the present report.
This report will also deal specifically with molten-salt reactors where
the additional problem exists of removing residual fluoride salt or
corrosion products. However, cleanliness will likely be ‘a paramount

problem in making remote welds in any reactor system.
 

 

 

The alloy studied is Hastelloy N, & nickel-based material developed
specifically for use in molten-salt reactors. The irradiated material
studied had been exposed to the core of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experi-
ment for long periods of time as a surveillance material for the reactor
vessel. The welds made in this study were simple gas tungsten-arec
fusion welds that melted about 75% of the cross-sectional area of a
miniature (0.125 in. in diameter) tensile sample. Thus, the welds were
made with very low heat input and minimal restraint, and the results
can be used only qualitatively.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

The heats of material involved in this study were air-melted and
* the chemical compositions are given in Table 1. These heats were used
in fabricating the MSRE vessel; heat 5065 for the top and bottom heads
and heat 5085 for the cylindrical shell.

Samples of these heats were placed in the various surveillance facil-
ities of the MSRE.2~% These samples have the general configuration of a
long rod 1/4 in. in diameter with periodic reduced sections 1 1/8 in. long
and 1/8 in. in diameter. After the desired exposure, these rods can be
segmented to obtain small tensile samples. The core surveillance assembly
is located axially about 3.6 in. from the core center line where the ther-
mal flux (< 0.876 Mev) is 4.1 x 102 neutrons cm™2? sec”! and the fast flux

(> 1.22 Mev) is 1.0 x 1012 neutrons cm”? sec”. The environment is a

650°C. There is a control facility in which the samples are exposed to

static "fuel salt" containing depleted uranium.

The temperature follows

that of the MSRE. - A second surveillance facility is located outside the

core in a vertical position about 4.5 in. from the vessel. The tempera-
ture is also 650°C at this location and the thermal flux (< 0.876 Mev)
is 1.0 x 10%! neutrons em”? sec”! and the fast flux (> 1.22 Mev) is

1.6 Xx 10! neutrons em=2 sec~l. The environment is nitrogen with 2 to

5% 0,, and the Hastelloy N samples have a thin oxide film after exposure.
In order to make fusion welds (no filler metal added) on the irra-

diated tensile specimens, it was necessary to design a special welding

‘fixture that could be operated remotely in a hot cell. We aimed for &

reasonable assurance of good penetration (high percentage of cross sec-

tion of specimen to be weld metal) without specimen distortion.

Figure 1 is a photograph of the welding fixture assembled for use in

the hot cell. As can be seen, the fixture consists of a rigid stand,

motor-driven chuck, specimen support, and a gas tungsten-arc welding

the fillet radius of the tensile sample and keeps the sample aligned
during welding. The torch was connected to a programmed welding power
supply located outside the hot cell. The welding conditions were
adjusted to obtain penetration of about 75% of the sample cross section.
All samples were abraded with 240-grit emery paper and cleaned
with acetone before welding. We did the final abrasion on each sample
with a clean piece of emery paper in an effort to minimize contamination.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

We welded 25 unirradiated samples both in the hot cell and in the
laboratory and all welds visually appeared sound. We welded 15 irra-
diated samples; three welds were completely unsatisfactory and two

others were very questionable due to surface cracks. Thus, 67% of the

welded irradiated specimens were found to be sound by visual examina-
tion. The bad welds occurred randomly, and we suspected that cleanli-
ness was our main problem in obtaining sound welds.

The results of tensile tests on base-metal samples are given in
Table 2, and those for the welded samples are given in Table 3. Numer-
ous variables are included, and care must be used in making comparisons.
The changes in strength are not thought to be significant, and we shall
discuss in some detail only the changes in the fracture characteristics.

A comparison of Groups 3, 4, and 5 in Table 2 shows that the
fracture strain of the unirradiated base metal decreases with aging at
650°C. (Corrosion is very slight in the samples and the property
changes are attributed entirely to thermal aging.2:4) The property

“changes are greater for heat 5085 than for heat 5065. Groups 1 and 2,

Table 2, show that irradiation reduces the fracture strain with the
magnitude of the change increasing with increasing fluence. The reduc-
tion in fracture strain in tests at 25°C is thought to be due to carbide
precipitation, and samples 7982 and 7976, Group 2, Table 2, lend sup-
port to this hypothesis. The fracture strain at 25°C was only 32.8% in
the as-irradiated condition, but improved to 48.3% after an anneal of

- 8 hr at 870°C. The reduction in the fracture strain at 650°C due to

irradiation is even more dramatic. We attribute this reduction in
fracture strain to the production of helium in the metal by the
108(n,0)7Li transmutation and have found that postirradiation annealing

Comparison of the data for Group 3 in Tables 2 and 3 shows that weld-

ing decreases the fracture strain in the unirradiated condition and that

the fractures were located in the weld metal for the conditions investi-
gated. Group 4, Table 3, involves unirradiated samples welded in the
hot cell. Sample 10,081 is a duplicate of 10,085 prepared outside the
hot cell and attests to the reproducibility of the welding technique.
Sample 10,082 was not given a postweld anneal before testing at 25°C

as was sample 10,086 and the location of fracture changed from the weld
metal to the base metal. Sample 9010, Group 5, Table 3, had been
exposed to fluoride salt for 4800 hr at 650°C, and its good properties
show that no basic problem prevents welding components that have been
exposed to salts. ;

The samples in Groups 1 and 2, Table 3, were welded after irradia-
tion. These samples generally have lower fracture strains than their
unirradiated counterparts shown in Groups 3, 4, and 5, Table 3. The
fracture strains for heat 5085 tested at 25°C are an exception, since
they are about equal for unirradiated and irradiated welds. The frac-
ture strains for samples from heat 5065 which were irradiated, welded,
and tested at 25°C are quite low (samples 7899 and 7959, Groups 1 and
2, Table 3). Co

A comparison of the properties of the irradiated base metal,
Groups 1 and 2, Table 2, with those of the samples irradiated and
welded, Groups 1 and 2, Table 3, shows that the welds generally have as
high a fracture strain as did irradiated base metal. The poor proper-
ties of heat 5065 at 25°C after welding are again an exception to this
generalization. The fracture strain of samples irradiated, welded,
annealed 8 hr at 870°C, and tested at 650°C is higher than for the
comparable irradiated base metal sample. Note that the fracture loca-
tion in the irradiated sample shifts from the weld metal to the base
metal following the postweld anneal of 8 hr at 870°C. This is in con-
trast to the unirradiated welds where fracture occurred in the weld
metal of both as-welded and postweld annealed samples.

Several of the samples were examined metallographically. The frac-
ture of an unirradiated welded sample is shown in Fig. 2. This sample
was tested at 25°C without postweld annealing, and fracture occurred in
the base metal. The weld area has a larger diameter, indicating that

it is stronger than the base metal under these test conditions. The
fracture of an unirradiated weld sample is shown in Fig. 3. The frac-
ture is across the weld zone and the base metal fracture has both trans-
and intergranular sections. There is also some porosity in the weld
metal. The fracture of an unirradiated welded sample tested at 650°C
is shown in Fig. 4. This sample had been exposed to molten salt for
4800 hr at 650°C, and the weld looks very sound with only a little
porosity. The intercellular cracks. in the weld metal indicate that the
weld metal did deform. |

The fracture of an irradiated sample that fractured as it was
removed from the welding fixture is shown in Fig. 5. There is some
porosity near the fusion line and some within the weld metal. The
microstructure of another sample that was welded after irradiation is
shown in Fig. 6. This sample was tested at 650°C, and the fracture was
intergranular and located in the base metal. Again, there is a large
amount of porosity near the fusion line and in the weld metal. Much
of the porosity near the fusion line is associated with the carbide
stringers that are present. Because of the similar chemical behavior
of carbon and boron, it is quite reasonable to suspect that these
stringers of carbides would also be enriched in boron. Transmission
electron microscopy of this material shows that helium bubbles are
present in this material (Fig. 7), and the heating may allow enough
diffusion to occur near the fusion line for the bubbles to agglomerate.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

These tests have shown that the fracture strain of Hastelloy N in
tensile tests at 25 and 650°C decreases with long exposure at 650°C.
Neutron irradiation causes an even more dramatic decrease in the frac-
ture strain. We fused about 75% of the cross section of both unirra-
diated and irradiated samples. Welding alone caused rather large
‘decreases in the fracture strain of unirradiated samples. These sam-

ples responded much as we had noted earlier in another study® involving

welds in large plates of Hastelloy N. Some of the irradiated samples
were welded and these were found to have fracture strains at least as
high as those observed for the irradiated base metal. (Heat 5065 tested

at 25°C is an exception and its ductility was very low after welding.)

Our previous work had involved some samples that were welded and then
irradiated.” Most of our samples that were welded after irradiation
had higher fracture strains at 650°C than the samples in our previous
study that were welded before irradiation. This is probably due to the
drastic redistribution of helium that occurs when the metal is fused.
Most of the helium should be lost from the weld metal, and this exhibits

more ductility at high temperatures than the irradiated base metal
where the helium is thought to be associated with grain boundaries.

Thus, the weld metal will strain and make a significant contribution
to the total strain.

A rather consistent pattern evolves for the location of the frac-
ture in welded samples. In both irradiated and unirradiated samples
tested at 25°C, the fracture occurs in the base metal in as-welded
samples and shifts to the weld metal after a postweld heat treatment
‘of 8 hr at 870°C. The weld metal in the as-deposited form is stronger
at 25°C (Fig. 2) and does not deform as much as the base metal. After
annealing, the weld metal softens and fracture occurs in the weld metal.
This observation does not indicate anything about the relative ductili-
ties of the weld and base metals, since the sample geometry allows the

weaker material to deform without any deformation occurring in the
stronger material. Thus, the as-deposited weld metal is strong at 25°C ,
but may be extremely brittle. At 650°C unirradiated welded samples
failed in the weld metal in the as-welded and heat-treated conditions.
The irradiated samples failed in the weld metal when tested in the as-
welded condition and the fracture shifted to the base metal after
annealing for 8 hr at 870°C. Metallogrephic studies indicate that the
weld metal and the base metal both deform when tested at 650°C. Thus,
the location of the fracture is likely governed by crack propagation.

~ Cracks can propagate in unirradiated welds more easily in the weld
metal than in the base metal and fracture occurs in the weld metal.
Cracks seem to propagate very easily through irradiated base metal and
the postweld annealed weld metal has better resistance to crack propaga-
tion. Thus, irradiated welded samples fail in the weld metal in the as-
welded condition and in the base metal after annealing.

Two metallographic features in the irradiated welds deserve some
comment; the porosity in the weld metal and the porosity near the fusion
line (Figs. 5 and 6). The voids in the weld metal are thought to be
related to superficial surface films on the samples before welding or

are characteristics of the particular heats of material involved.

The porosity near the fusion lines is associated preferentially
with the carbide stringers. We have noted that these stringers are
high in silicon,® and that melting starts in these areas when the alloy
is heated to about 1400°C (ref. 9). Thus, the supposition that these
void areas result. from localized melting would seem reasonable were it
not for the observation that unirradiated welded samples do not contain
this porosity (Figs. 2, 3, and 4). The possibility that they are large
agglomerates of helium that form during welding must at least be con-
sidered. A shell of material 0.037 cm (~ 0.015 in.) thick around the

. fusion zone would contain about 0.2 em? of transmuted helium at

atmospheric pressure and 1400°C. If this helium were distributed as
small bubbles 0.005 em. (~ 0.002 in.) in diameter, there would be about
2 X 10° bubbles present in this small volume. Thus, it seems likely
that the porosity near the fusion line is actually helium bubbles.
There is no evidence that either type of porosity influenced the loca-
tion of the fracture.

SUMMARY

Our studies have shown that fusion welds can be made in irradiated
Hastelloy N after exposure to fluoride salts. The rather meager statis-
tics indicate that acceptable welds are not obtained as frequently
in the irradiated material as in the unirradiated samples.

Samples that had been irradiated and welded were found generally
to have as good tensile fracture strain at 25 and 650°C as the base

‘metal. Welded samples that were given a postweld anneal of 8 hr at

870°C were even more ductile than the irradiated base metal. At 25°C
both unirradisted and irradiated welds failed in the base metal in the
as-welded condition and in the weld metal after annealing 8 hr at 870°C.

At a test temperature of 650°C, the unirradiated welds failed in the
weld metal in the as-welded and heat-treated condition. The samples
irradiated and welded failed in the weld metal in the as-welded condi-
tion and in the base metal after annealing.

The weld metal in all samples contained minor porosity that likely
reflects the welding characteristics of this alloy under the welding
parameters that we used. The irradiated samples had a large amount of
porosity associated with the carbide ‘stringers near the fusion line.

We feel that this porosity resulted from the agglomeration of small
transmutation-produced helium bubbles during the welding.

The data are not sufficient to draw a meaningful conclusion about
the weldability of irradiated reactor components of Hastelloy N; the
samples were too small, the heat input too low, and the degree of
restraint too low. The observation that the fused weld metal will
deform readily at 650°C is encouraging since this indicates that the
weld metal might deform small amounts to relieve stresses between rela-
tively large and brittle components or pipe segments. The observed
porosity near the fusion line means that this area will be weakened.
Welds in large sections will be required to determine whether the com-

posite joint of weld metal and fusion zone has acceptable properties.
