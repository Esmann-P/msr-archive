ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

FOREWORD

The Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project at the Qak Ridge National Laboratory
1s comprised of some 300 technical and scientific personnel engaged in many
phases of research directed toward the nuclear propulsion of aircraft. A
considerable portion of this research is carried out to provide support for
other organizations participating in the national ANF effort. However, the
purpose of the bulk of the ANP research at OBNL is the development of a circu-
lating-fuel type of reactor. The nucleus of this effort is now centered on
the Aircraft Reactor Experiment ~ a 3-Mev, high-temperature prototype of a

circulating-fuel reactor suitable for the propulsion of aircraft.

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion Project

. at ORNL records the technical progress of the research on the circulating- fuel
reactor and all other ANF research of the Laboratory under its contract,
W-7405-eng-26. The report is divided into four parts; I. Reactor Theory and

Design; II. Shielding Research; III. Materials Research; and IV. Appendixes.

"

Each part has a separate "Summary and Introduction.

 
 
SUMMARY AND

Analysis of the circulating- fuel
aircraft reactor systems incorporating
intermediate heat exchangers has led
to the use of a spherical-shell type
of heat exchanger and shield ar-
rangement. This arrangement has
resulted in an engineered reactor-
shield assembly weighing about 8000 1b
less than the best arrangement previ-
ously examined. A most promising
design study has been undertaken of a
circulating-~fluoride-fuel reactor
core in which a thick reflector
replaces the moderator. Such a
design, which results in a homogeneous-
fluoride reactor, has been shown to
have a low critical mass and a neutron
lifetime more than adequate to permit
control. This compact, spherical-
core design 1s compatible with the
low-weight spherical-shell type of
heat exchanger and shield arrangements

(sec. 1).

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment to
be constructed by the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory was described in
the last report. Only minor modifi-
cations in the design have occurred
during the past quarter; the most
significant changes were the reduction
in number of fuel passes through the
core and the reversal of the inlet
and outlet fuel headers. The design
effort is concentrated on detailing
drawings of components of the reactor
and the procurement of these parts.
The building for the ARE was released
on June 6 to ORNL by the construction
contractor, and installation of
equipment is proceeding as rapidly
as the receipt of parts permits
(sec. 2).

The emphasis of the research and
development program for reactor
plumbing and associated hardware
continues to be placed on the tech-
nology of high-temperature fluoride
mixtures (sec. 3). Both pumps and
valves have been operated successfully

INTRODUCTION

with molten fluoride mixtures for
extended periods of time at 1500°F.
In both instances the problem reduces
te that of sealing a moving shaft;
this has been satisfactorily effected
by both frozen seals and stuffing-box
seals. NaK-to-NaK and Na-to-air
heat exchangers have beenoperated ~ the
former for over 3000 hours. In
addition considerable effort has been
devoted to developing instruments. for
measuring flow and pressure and for
liquid level indication and control
as required both by the ARE and the
experimental high-temperature-liquid
systems. Satisfactory techniques
have been developed for the manu-
facture, transfer, and loading of
fluoride mixtures without introducing

contamination. .

Studies of the kinetics of the
circulating- fuel aircraft reactor
have led to the conclusion that in
spite of the loss of some delayed
neutrons power oscillations in such
reactors will be strongly damped by
a mechanism associated with the actual
circulation of the fuel (sec. 4).
Physics research for the aircraft
reactor experiment has involved
numerous static calculations conse-
guent to significant, but more or
less minor, design changes.

A critical assembly of the box-type,
direct-cycle reactor was investigated
for the GE-ANP program. Fission rate,
flux measurements, reflector effects,
and temperature response were de-
termined. Upon completion of these
measurements, a mockup of the circu-
lating- fuel aircraft reactor will be
assembled ~ the components are now
on hand. The beryllium oxide machined
for the ARE will be used in the
critical assembly, together with a
simulated fluoride mixture. A resume
of the results from an earlier series
of experiments with a graphite-
moderated reactor is also presented

(sec. 5).
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

1.
A. P.

Fraas,

Several circulating-fuel aircraft
reactor systems employing closely
coupled intermediate heat exchangers
were described in the last report.(!)
The extension of these design studies
led to consideration of a spherical-
shell type of heat exchanger and
shield arrangement that resulted in a
saving of about 8000 1b in engineered
shield weight over the best arrangements
previously examined.(?> In addition,
a modified core design having all of
the moderator removed from the core
and added to the reflector now appears
to be an attractive possibility.
With the modified design, the critical
mass would not be large, the neutron
lifetime would be longer than with
previous designs (which would ease
the control problem), and the structure
in the core would be eliminated.

REFLECTOR-MODERATED CIRCULATING-FUEL
REACTOR

Calculations made on the basis of
relations derived for thermal reactors
had indicated that circulating- fuel
reactors employing a mixture of
fluoride salts as a homogeneous
working fluid would require a very
high critical mass and would be
difficult to control. Multigroup
two-region IBM machine calculations
made during the past quarter have
shown that this 1s not the case.
Removal of the moderator from the
core of a circulating-fuel reactor
does not result in excessive fuel
requirements Uf a thick reflector
1s employed. In a large measure
this comes about because the removal
of the moderator also means the
removal of the poisoning effect of a

substantial amount of stainless steel.
Critical mass calculations have heen
made on the IBM machines for two core
diameters. With a 12-in.-thick
beryllium oxide reflector, critical
masses of 23 and 19 lb were obtained
for 16- and 32-in.-dia spherical
reactor cores. The structural sim-
plicity and attendant advantages
of this type of reactor are obvious.

At first it also seemed that these
unmoderated circulating-fuel reactors
would have a high median energy for
fission and hence might present a
serious control problem. However,

about one-third of the fissions are
caused by thermal or near thermal
neutrons that have spent a large
fraction of their lifetimes in the

relatively poison-{free reflector.
Thus the effective neutron lifetime
from the control standpoint may
actually be greater than in beryllium
oxide-moderated <circulating-fuel
reactors that have of necessity a
substantial amount of stainless steel
in the core.

It was also feared that the power
density at the core-reflector interface
would be many times the average power
density. However, the attenuation
length for the fission~producing
neutrons from the reflector was about
10 cm, so the high power density
region was found to be quite thick.
Since approximately two-thirds of the
volume of a sphere lies between its
surface and the surface of a smaller
concentric sphere, or "island," having
a radins two-thirds that of the
larger sphere, much of the volume
of the core falls in the high power-
density region. As a result, the
ratio of peak-to-average power density
was about 2 for both of the
studied.

reactors
Further calculations are being
made ‘to determine the effects of a
spherical island of moderator in the
center. Since the extra structural
complication should not prove to be
too great, this may be very worth
while from the standpoint of both
uranium investment and power density
considerations.

SPHERICAL HEAT EXCHANGER AND SHIELD
DESIGN

The last report{?’ showed the large
saving in shield weight effected by
going from the tandem to the annular
heat exchanger arrangement. This
suggested that a further reduction in
weight might be realized by going to
a more nearly spherical configuration.
A heat exchanger in which the tube
matrix is laid out in the form of: a
spherical shell was therefore devised
to form a basis for further designs.
The basic configuration envisioned is
shown in Fig. 1; note that it ia-
corporates the reflector-moderated
reactor discussed above, This spheri-
cal heat exchanger design reduced the
over-all weight of the reactor, heat
exchanger, and shield combination for
the design conditions(!? to only
96,000 1b for the divided shield and
120,000 lb for the near unit shield
(a shield permitting 3 r/hr 50 ft
from center of reactor), a saving of
roughly 8000 1b over the annular heat
exchanger arrangement. (1) Both shields
are designed for 1 r/hr in the crew
compartment.

The heat exchanger tubes are grouped
in bundles and each bundle has a
rectangular cross section except where
the bundles terminate in circular-disk
headers. If the two pumps are at the
North and South poles respectively,
each tube bundle will lie on a vari-
able-pitch helix running from ap-
proximately the "Arctic" to the

 

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

"Antarctic Circle." The angle between
tube centerlines and the "equator"
will be about 40 deg, whereas the
corresponding angle at the Arctic
Circle will be about 90 degrees.
This will make it possible to keep
the center-to~center spacing of the
tubes independent of "latitude."
Although the tube bundle
quite unusual, fabrication of the
heat exchanger should not be too
difficule. After jigs have been
prepared for building up a tube bundle,
one tube bundle after another can be
assembled, brazed and/or welded 1nto
its header disks, pressure tested,
inspected, and assembled in the spheri-
cal, steel shell. A simple fillet
weld between the header disk and the
pressure shell should suffice to
complete. the installation.

shape 1s

In other respects the heat ex-
changer and shield design of Fig. 1
is essentially similar to the tandem
and annular arrangements described
in the previous report.¢!> The 11-
in.-thick reflector of the annular
heat exchanger design was used again
as was the same type of shield con-
struction employed in both of the
other designs. One difference is
the use of boron carbide in the baffles
between tube bundles instead of in
"dead" tubes.

This reactor design is suggestive
of a homogeneous reactor, which it
really approaches quite closely.
The thick beryllium oxide reflector
could be cooled by either metallic
sodium or a nonuranium-bearing fluoride
salt. It should be possible through
careful designof the moderator cooling
passages and the conical diffusing

vanes at the reactor core inlet to
keep the metal temperature at all
points below the average temperature

of the fuel leaving the reactor. Thus
the hottest metal anywhere in the
system would be the heat exchanger

tube walls at the fuel inlet end.

The reactor system description
given in the previous report(?) js
applicable to the current system and
will not be repeated. Furthermore,
detailed descriptions and 1llustrations
of this : its com-
ponents are the topic of a separate
report. (2?) The several changes made
duringthe last quarter and the progress
made in detailing the

reactor system and

system and
procuring outside manufactured com-
ponents will be discussed, as well as
a procedure that has been outlined
for the operation of the reactor.

CORE AND PRESSURE SHELL

The core design has been revised
to provide 11 tubes per serpentine
pass instead of 13. This change was
dictated by the number of beryllium
oxide-moderator blocks available and
had no major effect on the functional
performance of the core. Calculations
indicated a fuel-film temperature
gradient of approximately 4C°F due to
moderator heat inflow. This maximum
gradient occurred near the core center

and, as the fuel exited from this
region, was additive to a 1500°F
datum, which caused a fuel-tube wall

temperature of 1540°F. Accordingly,
the fuel flow direction was reversed
so that the 40°F gradient is additive
to a 1150°F datum (fuel inlet temper-
ature). The moderator heat inflow is
very small at the fuel outlet end
(core periphery), so the maximum
wall temperature is expected to be in

the region of 1500 to 1510°F.

CONTROL

The interlock circuit for the ARE
has been completed in its elementary
form and integrated with the process
instrumentation and operational plan
so that 1t will be possible to begin
the interconnection wiring diagrams
for the various control components.
Detailing of the control rods and
control rod actuators is 90% complete.
Fabrication of the shim-rod absorber
elements for one rod to be used in
the critical assembly has been com-
pleted by the X-10 Metallurgy Division
(cf., sec. 12).

OPERATION

An operational procedure has been
outlined in detail(2?) and will be
only briefly reviewed here. The
operation of the experimental reactor
may be divided into four separate
stages; pretesting, critical loading,
power operation, and shutdown.

Pretesting. After the reactor
plumbing has been installed and the
system 1s ready for checking, both
the primary and secondary circuits
will be given a pneumatic test. In
addition to eliminating any leaks to
atmosphere, it 1s also important that
any cross-talk between the primary
and the secondary circuits be elimi-
nated. With helium in the primary
circuit and vacuum in the secondary

12

circuit, 1t will be possible to
determine both the presence and extent
of the cross-talk between the two.
After both circuits have been made
tight so far as the above tests are
able to reveal, they will be filled
with NaK, which will be circulated at
near design flow rates. In addition
to giving a further leak test, the
circulation of the NaK will permit
checking of pumps, tanks, and level
controls under ambient temperature
conditions. The NaK will also further
clean the system and permit easy
repair, and up to temperatures of
about 1200°F it will not deteriorate
the piping. Upon completion of this
phase of the pretest, the hot Nak
will be removed from the system by
evacuating the system and then evapo-
rating the residual NaK under vacuum.
Then, with the vacuum maintained, the
fuel carrier (fluoride melt without
UF,) will be released into the evacu-
ated fuel system.

Critical Loading. For the critical
loading of the reactor, a fuel 1in-
jection system, which will be filled
with highly concentrated UF, in the
in the fuel carrier, will be employed
to inject the critical mass into the
fuel circuit. The injection system
is so arranged that samples of known
weight can be introduced into the
fuel system at a controlled rate.
The injection system is also equipped
with two weighing devices and a
television pickup to monitor the
injection of fuel into the reactor
fuel circuit. The UF,-rich fuel will
be charged to the reactor in distinct
fuel quanta and in such a manner as to
be equally distributed throughout the
reactor fuel circuit. As a safety
precaution attempts will be made to
measure the temperature coefficient
of reactivity when the reactor has
reached the value of kk = ~0.98. To
do this the fuel temperature will be
lowered from the equilibrium value of
1200°F to approximately 1175°F. If
the reactivity increases with this
lowering of the temperature, it will
show that the temperature coefficient
is negative and that the loading to
criticality may safely continue. ‘At
this time an attempt will alsc be
made to obtain a rough calibration of
the regulator rod.

Power Operation. Operation at
power will commence as quickly as
possible commensurate with safety.
After the control rod has been cali-
brated, the temperature of the reactor
will be raised to 1300°F and the
regulating rod withdrawn sufficiently
te put the reactor on a positive
period of about 20 to 30 seconds.
The reactor will then be at a power
level of about 10 kw. At this point
the helium blowers will be started
and heat extraction will have been
initiated. The mean fuel temperature
of 1300°F will be maintained closely,
but the fuel inlet temperature will
drop and the reactor outlet temperature
will rise until at full power there
will be a temperature drop across the
reactor of about 350°F. The servo
regulating system will not be employed
unless 1t is found to be necessary
because of an insufficiently large
negative temperature coefficient.

Shutdown. After the power run has
been made the reactor will be scrammed.
When temperatures have reached equi-
librium and after iodine has had time
(6 to 8 hr) to decay into xenon, an
attempt will be made to go critical
again. If xenon has evolved as a gas
from the fuel, the reactor should go
critical at essentially the same rad
conditions, since the xenon poison
will not be present. If, bowever,
the reactor will not go critical with
shim rod adjustment, instead of adding
fuel, further time will be allowed to
elapse and another attempt to go
critical will be made. If this attempt
1 it may be assumed that
decay and

1s successful,
the xenon has had time to

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

that the poison preventing criticality
in the first attempt was the xenon
that was not evolved from the fuel.
Nonuranium-bearing fluorides will
then be introduced into the system to
flush the fuel into the radioactive-
fuel dump tanks.

Detailed drawings of the heater

been released for most of the major
components such as motor-generator

but few orders have heen placed. The
delivery of these items will tend to
be critical and special follow-up will
be required.

Shielding by Concrete Pits (H. L. F.
Enlund, Fhysics Division). The sources
of radiation from the aircraft re-
actor experiment may be divided into
two categories: the reactor itself
and the components of the system
external to the reactor. Further,
the sources must be considered from a
full-power as well as a shutdown
condition. The shutdown condition 1s
important because of the necessity
for Since the reactor
core is the originating point, either
directly or indirectly, of all the
radiation in the form of active
particles, particular attention was
given to the determination of gamma-
radiation sources, neutron leakage,
and activity in the circulating fuel.

The reactor physics group furnished
core- and reflector-composition and
neutron-escape data based on multigroup
calculations for the experimental
reactor.

The shielding effectiveness of the
walls of the reactor pit was calculated
on the basis of the leakage data. It
was recommended that the 7 1/3 ft of
wall shielding be constructed of 4 to
5 ft of barytes-concrete blocks at the
control pit wall and 6 ft at the side
wall adjacent to the control instrument
bay instead of being entirely of
ordinary concrete blocks. This will
give factors of safety of about 8
based on a tolerance of 7.5 mr/hr.
The roof over the reactor pit was
found to give attenuation sufficient
to reduce the dosage to below labo-
ratory tolerance. The end leakage
from the reactor was less than from
the sides because of the greater
thickness of the Inconel shell.

In the vicinity of the proposed
reactor control instruments the

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

shielding provided by the Inconel
shell, and to a much lesser degree
by the thermal insulation blanket,
reduces the radiation leakage to the
following at a distance of 30 cm from
the boundary of the side reflector
of the reactor:

250-kv thermal = 8.6 Xx 101 sem? -sec
Fast (above 250 kv) = 4.5 Xx 101%/cm? *sec.

The side wall of the heat exchanger
room is sufficient to reduce the
activity from the equipment to below
tolerance levels, that is, about 0.1
mr/hr. Calculations are being made
for determining activity within the
heat exchanger space so that working
tolerances can be predicted for
personnel servicing equipment.

 

3. EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR ENGINEERING

H. W. Savage, ANP Division

The primary effort of the Experi-
mental Engineering Group is the
development of major components for
systems circulating high-temperature
fluids (1500 to 1800°F) that will
operate reliably over extended periods.
These components consist of pumps,
valves, liquid-level indicating and
control instruments, pressure sensing
instruments, and flow measuring
devices. Other than certain design
considerations to compensate for
thermal distortion and thermal ex-

pansion, the pump and valve problems

resolve themselves into the single
problem of developing a zero-leakage
seal for the pump shaft or valve stem.
Considerable progress has been made
and it is now possible to report that
satisfactory means of sealing against
molten fluoride mixtures at tempera-
tures up to 1500°F are available. Both
pumps and valves have been operated
successfully at 1500°F and experience
in the design, construction, and
operation of high-temperature fluoride
and liquid metal systems 1s continuing
to accumulate. Investigations are

15
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

under way to evaluate the several
sealing arrangements that have been
developed, and new designs are being
worked out, constructed, and tested
in order to improve on present sealing
methods.

Increased emphasis has been placed
on instrumentation for flow and
pressure measurement and liquid-level
indication and control in high-
temperature systems. This work has
resulted in instruments that accomplish
these functions with reasonable re-
liability; however, continued effort
is being made to improve both accuracy
and reliability.

Tests are being continued to
determine the over-all heat transfer
from fluorides to liquid metals and
liquid metals to air. Thin-walled
tube-finned radiators are being
investigated in sodium-to-air heat
transfer experiments to evaluate the
several design parameters.

Mockups of the ARE core and fluid
circuits are being made for studying
the fluid dynamics of the circuit and
for the development of techniques for
filling and emptying high-temperature
fluid systems such as the proposed ARE.

Progress has been made in the
technology of fluoride handling to the
point where the manufacturing and
handling of most fluoride fuels,
including the filling of systems, has
become routine. Fuels composed of
sodium, potassium, lithium, and
uranium fluorides are being produced
in sufficient quantities to meet the
experimental engineering requirements,
and equipment 1s almost ready for
producing the zirconium-bearing fluo-
rides in like quantities.

16

SEALS AND CLOSURES

Several satisfactory sealing ar-
rangements have been developed for
sealing rotating shafts and valve
stems at high temperatures. Frozen
seals have proved reliable for both
sodium and fluorides at temperatures
approaching 1500°F. Stuffing-box
seals packed with Inconel braid and
nickel and graphite powder have
successfully sealed against 1500°F
fluorides in both valves and pumps.
A program is under way to test the
effectiveness of bellows as a valve-
stem seal in intimate contact with

1500°F fluorides.

Seal Tester (P. G. Smith, ANP
Division). A seal-testing device has
been designed and is presently being
constructed that may be used for
testing either packed, stuffing-box
seals or frozen seals for 1500°F
fluoride systems. The equipment
includes a bearing housing and pump
volute mounting from a CG-1 Worthite
pump that can be easily converted to
pumping service when no longer needed
for sealing tests. The sealing section
has been designed to incorporate a
Calrod heater, which has proved
essential in stopping and restarting
frozen-fluoride seals. Shafts hard-
faced with Stellite No. 3, Stellite
No. 6, and chromium plating will be
tested.

Stuffing-Box Seals (H. R. Johnson,
ANP Division). Stuffing-box seals
with both rotating and reciprocating
shafts have been operating for several
hundred hours. The shafts are made
of type-316 stainless steel with
chromium-plated surfaces. The stuffing
boxes are packed with Inconel braid
and nickel and graphite powder, and
liquid tricresyl phosphate is added
as a lubricant. This type of seal
operates satisfactorily for loag
periods against 1500°F fluorides so
long as frequent additions of tricresyl
phosphate are made. However, both the
rotary and the reciprocating shafts
show tendencies to seize 1f not
frequently lubricated. This condition
is being corrected in actual pump
applications by the addition of a
forced-lubrication system that will
continuously add tricresyl phosphate
to the packing materials at a low
rate.

Bellows Tests (P. W. Taylor, ANP
Division). Thin-walled bellows made
of type-347 stainless steel have been
tested in 1300°F fluorides for possible
use as a valve-stem seal. Initial
tests indicate that this type of
bellows will not be satisfactory when
exposed to high-temperature fluorides.
The bellows tested ruptured at the
convolutions within 100 cycles at
1/4-1in. deflection.

Inconel bellows with thicker walls
will be tested as soon as such bellows
can be obtained. A bellows tester is
presently being designed in which the
bellows will operate in a cooled,
trapped—gas volume to eliminate ex-
posure of the bellows material to
high-temperature fluorides.

Oval-Ring Seal (W. G. Cobb, ANP
Division). A gasketed joint for
sealing fluoride salts at 1500°F has
shown excellent results in operation.
This joint was made with a Goetz
oval-ring gasket, size R-49 (6 3/4-in.
pitch diameter, 5/16 in. wide), made
of type-316 stainless steel. The
7/8-in. ~-thick flange contained twelve
5/8 N.C. bolts, on an 8-in. diameter,
that were tightened to 100 ft-1b
torque (in 20 ft-1b steps) with lubri-
cated threads.

The joint was operated at tempera-
tures of 1200 to 1500°F for approxi-
mately 960 hr and then cooled to

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

room temperature and reheated several
times to further increase the severity
of the test.

PUMPS

Mechanical pumps that have been
successfully operated for pumping
1500°F fluorides have demonstrated a
high degree of reliability. Pumps
with a variety of shaft sealing
arrangements have been operated in the
range of 1200 to 1500°F, and sufficient
experience has been obtained to
indicate that pumping at these tempera-
tures 1s not extremely difficult when
the pumps are carefully constructed
from sound engineering designs.

ARE Centrifugal Pump (A. G. Grindell,
Engineering and Maintenance Division).
Most of the components for the first
ARE centrifugal pump (gas-sealed
Model DA) have been fabricated and the
pump is nearly ready for assembly. The
second pump, Model E, incorporating a
frozen-fluoride with a closed
cooling circuit, has been completely
designed and is being fabricated. It
is expected that pump components for
the assembly of three ARE pumps will
be available to begin pump tests by
early summer. The components for
assoclated fluid circuits are presently
being fabricated.

seal

The first of these pumps will be
fabricated for initial tests from
type-316 stainless steel as a matter
of expediency because of long delivery
dates for Inconel. The components
exposed to high-temperature fluorides
in the final ARE pump will be con-
structed of Inconel.

Laboratory-Size Maintained-Level
Gas-Sealed Pump (W. G. Cobb, ANP
Division). The gas-sealed pump
previously reported(!) as operating

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

in an isothermal circulating loop was
restarted after repairs to the loop and
installation of anew type of throttling
valve. Operation was continuous at
temperatures of at least 1200°F for
a period of 314.5 hours. Termination
was caused by a leak in the loop near
the valve. The exact cause of failure
is yet to be determined. The final
100 hr of operation was at 1500°F.
Some leakage from the pump body
occurred during the latter stages of
operation but the leak was essentially
"self-healing" and pump operation was
not affected. The total operating time
for the pump was 964.5 hours.

The pump has been redesigned to
substitute a rotary mechanical seal
for the stuffing-box seal and to
relocate the parting faces of the pump
to avoid exposure to high-temperature
fluids. Most of the parts for two
pumps of this model have been received
and one pump is assembled and awaiting
test.

Worthite Frozen-Sodium-Sealed
Pump. The frozen-sodium-sealed pump
previously reported(!’ has now logged
over 3000 hr of operation ina figure-8
loop. The cooling arrangement for the
seal has been altered so that the seal
1s now cooled by water instead of
refrigerated kerosene, and as a result
the pump can be operated at higher
temperatures. The sodium temperature
at the pump has been increased from
approximately 800 to 1200°F. Tt is
expected that the pump will operate
with the fluid temperature near
1500°F; however, with the present
heater and insulation limitations on
the figure-8 loop, this is not possible
without a shutdown for a major heater
overhaul, which will be effected in
the near future.

The sealing annulus on the pump was
remachined to give approximately
0.035 in. of radial clearance between
shaft and sleeve, and a solid shaft

18

was substituted for the original
hollow shaft. Neither of these changes
seems to affect the ability to form a
frozen scal around the shaft, and as
a result the shaft clearance over a
fairly wide range is not thought to be
a critical parameter in the design of
such a seal. Heat removed from the seal
with the temperature of the stream at
1200°F is approximately 2500 Btu/hr.

Durco Convectiomn-Cooled Frozen-
Sodium-Sealed Pump (W. R. Huntley, ANP
Division). A Durco pump (Model H24
MBR654) has been designed to incorporate
a frozen-sodium seal that is convection
cooled. The pump and associated fluid
circuit equipment are being fabri-
cated by the Y-12 shops. The seal
consists of a copper-finned sleeve
approximately 5 1/4 in. long with
3 5/8-in.-dia fins. Heat transfer
calculations indicate that this seal
will operate effectively against
1500°F sodium. The pump will deliver
approximately 20 gpm against a 20-ft
head.

Durco Frozen-Fluoride-Sealed Pump
(P. G. Smith, ANP Division). The
Durco centrifugal pump (Model H34
MDVX-80) previously reported!’ was
operated for more than 500 hr in an
isothermal loop to pump 1100°F fluo-
rides. It was then modified to in-
corporate a frozen-fluoride seal that
was cooled by blowing air across a
finned sleeve constructed of type-316
stainless steel. Diametrical clearance
between shaft and sleeve was 0.060 inch.
The parting faces of the pump were
sealed with a nickel ring gasket.

The operation of this pump was
limited to 1100°F because of differ-
ential thermal expansion between the
shaft and pump housing that caused
interference between the impeller and
the housing when attempts were made to
operate at higher temperatures.
Al though the test was terminated
because of a slow leak at the parting
the seal was com-
pletely successful during the more
than 500 hr of operation.

face of the pump,

Upon examination of the pump shaft
and the internal surfaces of the
finned sleeve it was found that there
was only a very slight amount of
scoring of the shaft. The scoring
was not considered to be detrimental
to the operation of the pump, and it
probably can be eliminated completely
by coating the shaft with a harder
grade of Stellite than was used. No
difficulty was encountered with the
outboard pump bearings that were cooled
by continuously circulating the
lubricating oil through an air-cooled
radiator.

A new pump is being fabricated
that incorporates an improved design
of the frozen-fluoride seal. This
design employs a Calrod heater for
heating the portion of the seal in
which the fluorides are normally
frozen. The frozen seal is backed
up by a stuffing-box seal so that the
pump can be operated with either the
frozen seal or the packed seal.
Additional clearance has been provided
between the impeller and the pump
housing and it 1s expected that this
pump will operate to pump fluorides
at temperatures approaching 1500°F.

Fluoride Pumps with Stuffing-Box
Seals (W. R. Huntley, H. R. Johnson,
ANP Division). A small coolant pump
(manufactured by Eastern Industries,
Inc.), driven by al/15-hp motor, was
operated for approximately 300 hr to
pump 1500°F fluorides. The shaft had
a diameter of 1/8 in. through the seal,
which was the conventional stuffing-
box type packed with Inconel braid and
nickel and graphite powder. The shaft
operated at approximately 5000 rpm,
and the pumping rate was approximately
5 gpm. The test was terminated when
the 1/8-in. shaft broke at the outside
end of the packing gland. Since the

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

test was run for about 300 hr before
failure, 1t is significant in that it
demonstrates the feasibility of using
commerical pumps without extensive
modification for pumping high-tempera-
ture fluids.

A larger pump (Durco Model H-24
MBR-654) that has been modified to
incorporate similar packing will be
placed in operation at an early date.
The modification consists of machining
a suction plate of type-316 stainless
steel to improve the sealing arrange-
ment of the parting faces and increasing
the depth of the packing gland to
2 1/2 inches. Means for constant-
pressure lubrication of the seal with
tricresyl phosphate have been added.
It is expected that this pump will
operate with fluorides at temperatures
approaching 1500°F.

VALVES
D. R. Ward P. G. Smith
ANP Division

Three types of valves that may be
needed for handling molten fluorides
at 1200 to 1800°F in ARE-type reactors
are the wide-open valve (open except
for occasional closing), the closed
valve (closed except for occasional
opening), and the throttling valve
(requiring frequent adjustment). Extra
valve-stem seals may be desirable as
a precaution against loss of fluid in
case the primary seals fail. Leakage
of molten fluorides into the cool
region of the bonnet would form a
"frozen seal" between the stem and the
bonnet. Such leakage must be avoided
because the frozen seal thus formed
would immobilize the valve stem and
probably make the valve inoperable.

Certain valve features and components
can best be studied on an individual
basis rather than as a group in-
corporated in the same valve. Such
studies include (1) selection of stem

19
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

packing and lubricants, (2) selection
of anti-galling lubricants for threaded
members in the high-temperature region,
and (3) determination of the effects
of differential expansion between
stem and bonnet during heating and
cooling. Tests are under way to
assist in these studies.

Wide-Open Valve. One design of
a wide-open valve utilizes back-seating
of the valve in the open position as
the primary stem seal, which 1s
followed by a stuffing-box seal. With
this arrangement the packing will not
be exposed to the fluid until the valve
is closed and then only for a short
time.

Closed Valve. A closed valve may
be obtained by modifying the design
of the wide-open valve described
above. If the direction of flow
through the valve is chosen properly,
the fluid will not contact the packing
until the valve is opened.

Throttling Valve. The designs of
throttling valves are being examined.
One design, which is essentially
complete, consists of a 1 1/2 I.P.S.
globe valve machined from Inconel bar
stock. A stem packing is used in the
high-temperature fluoride region,
a finned temperature-gradient section
of the bonnet leads up to a bellows
seal located in the cool region.

and

Another throttling valve under con-
sideration employs an Inconel braid
and graphite and nickel powder packing
in the high-temperature region and a
convectional stem packing in the cool
region, with provision for introducing
inert gas into the region between the
two seals. By carefully controlling
the gas pressure between the seals,
the tendency for the molten fluoride
to escape through the high-temperature
packing will be balanced by the
opposing gas pressure against the
packing.

20

A third design of throttling valve,
the poppet type, employs a bellows
seal in the cool upper region of the
bonnet and no auxilliary stem seals in
the lower valve-body region. This
valve will rely on a cone of trapped
gas to prevent the molten fluorides
from leaving the high-temperature
region and reaching the bellows.
Obviously, this valve will not be
suitable for use in systems requiring
wide variations in pressure or filling
while evacuated, and it will operate
in only one position with respect to
the direction of gravity,

Canned-Rotor-Driven Valve (W, B.
McDonald, A. L. Southern, ANP Division).
Tests are under way to determine the
feasibility of using a canned-rotor
drive for valves in high-temperature-
fluid circuits. The proposed design
is shown in Fig. 6. Preliminary tests
indicate that a rotor constructed of
a permanent magnet can be operated in
a cooled, trapped-gas space with the
actuating-field coil separated from
the rotor by a stainless steel or
Inconel can up to 1/16 in. thick.
Complete control of the actuation
of such a valve may be obtained by
using amultiple-position rotary switch
to rotate the poles of a three-phase
induction-wound motor. One complete
rotation of the switch causes the
rotor to follow at the same speed in
the direction the switch 1s rotating.
Bearings could possibly be eliminated
by mounting the rotor on a shafy
having screw threads on one side of
the rotor and a guide sleeve on the
other and thus permitting the rotor
to travel axially in the magnetic

field.

HEAT EXCHANGERS

the primary and secondary circuits

1500°F for over 3000 hr; the test was

between the experimental heat transfer
data ard those calculated from Lyon's
equation was poor at low flows but
good at high flows. The heat transfer
coefficient showed little change for
2000 hr and at completion of the

endurance run was within 12% of the
initial value. Pressure drops, both
through and around the tubes, showed

no particular trend with time.

Tests on a variety of heat-exchanger
tube~-matrix spacers showed that a
spacer friction factor, defined as the
ratio of the spacer head loss to the
incident-velocity head, was a unique
function of the Reynolds number in the
tube bundle. Data for the several
sets of spacers were correlated with
model parameters to obtain a single
curve of friction factor against
Reynolds number.

The sodium-to-air radiator operated
for 330 hr at sodium inlet temperatures
up to 1600°F. The over-all heat
transfer coefficients were between
6 and 12 Btu/hreft?:°F, that is, about
20% below predicted values.

Nak-to-NaK Heat Exchanger (M. E.
LaVerne and A. P. Fraas, ANP Division).
The NaK-to-NaK heat exchanger previ-
ously reported?) has completed heat
transfer tests at inlet temperatures
from 800 to 1200°F and flows from 3.5
to 17 gpm and an endurance run of
2835 hr at an inlet temperature of
1500°F and a flow of 5.2 gpm. The
total operating time was 3006 hr and
the test was voluntarily terminated.

Results of the heat transfer tests
are shown in Fig. 7. It is apparent
from the figure that a considerable
discrepancy exists between the results
reported here and the heat transfer
data computed from Lyon's equation, (3)

particularly at low flows. However,
the convergence of the predicted and
experimental curves is such as to
indicate good agreement (within 10%)
for flows in excess of about 15 gpm.

An item of some concern at the time
the heat exchanger tests were begun
was the possibility of serious per-
formance deterioration with operating
time. It was noticed that changes
in the heat transfer coefficient were
negligible for the first 2000 hr ~ the
mean curve did not fall outside the
probable scatter band until 2200 hours.
The coefficient at completion of the
run was within 12% of that at the
beginning. Pressure-drop measurements
taken both through and around the tubes
during the endurance run displayed a
singular independence of operating
time. The observed scatter was of the
size expected with careful gage
readings and was as prone to be down
as up, with the result that there was
no discernible trend in pressure drop
with time.

A view of the inlets and exits of
the cut-up heat exchanger is shown in
Fig. 8; note the cleanness of the hot
end (operating at 1500°F) and the
extremely dirty appearance of the
"cool" end (operating at about 900°F).
These pieces are being examined
metallographically.

Tube-Matrix Spacer Tests (M., E.
LaVerne and A. P. Fraas, ANP Division).
Information on the flow characteristics
of spacers is of considerable interest
because the losses across spacers
of the type used in the NaK-to-NakK
heat exchanger may constitute an
appreciable portion of the total
losses. Since this information does
not appear to exist in the literature,
tests were run on a variety of spacers
with the expectation of obtaining a
general set of characteristics.

stainless steel rods was built for
testing with air. The matrix was
clamped between top and bottom pieces
and sides made of wood. Pressure taps
along the top allowed determination of
pressure gradients along the model,
The head loss chargeable to the spacers
was taken as the difference in head
loss between a section containing a
set of spacers and a section of equal
length containing no spacers. The
spacer friction factor was then defined
as the ratio of the spacer head loss
to the incident-velocity head. For a
given set of spacers, the friction
factor so defined was found to be a

24

unique function of the Reynolds number
in the tube bundle.

The data for the several sets of
spacers were correlated with the
spacer-thickness-to-width and spacer-
thickness-to-tube-diameter ratios as
parameters. Figure 9 gives the final
result; note that the two sections of
the curve have the same slopes (-1 and
~1/4 for the laminar and turbulent
regions, respectively) as the corre-
sponding curve for smooth pipe.

Sodium-to-Air Radiator (G. D.
Whitman, ANP Division). The sodium-
to-air radiator previously described(*)
operated for 330 hr before developing
a leak. During this time the average
temperature of the sodium entering the
radiator was 1200°F, including 140 hr
during which the inlet temperature was

between 1500 and 1600 °F.

The over-all heat transfer coef-
ficients obtained were between 6 and
12 Btu/hr+ft2.°F. The maximum coef-
ficient was about 20% lower than the
predicted value. There was no marked
change in coefficient with increase
in fluid temperature, and there was
a slight decrease in the coefficient
with respect to time. Varying the
sodium flow between 1 and 3.5 gpm did
not affect the over-all coefficient
since the local sodium film is not
controlling. The maximum rate of
over-all heat transfer was approxi-
mately 100,000 Btu/hr. The air-
pressure drop across the radiator at
the maximum heat transfer rate was
11.8 in. of water.

The exact cause of the failure is
not yet known, but the radiator
section 1s now being examined metal-
lographically. One plausible ex-
planation of the failure is that excess
Nicrobraz at the joint between fin
and tube may have caused undercutting

or local reduction of tube wall

The failure resulted in a small
sodium fire in a tube at a point
between the top fin and a header
drum. This section of the tube was
on the sodium inlet side of the heat
exchanger and was not exposed to the
air stream. Aside from this failure
the radiator appeared to be in excellent
condition. There is evidence that the
leak started 40 hr before shutdown was
necessary. During this period the
system pressure at the pump discharge
was observed to fall from 15.9 to
14.9 psi,

The core section tested was a
continuous fin-and-tube two-pass
counterflow exchanger with 3/16-in.-
OD tubes spaced 2/3 in. on a square

pitch. The 0.010-in.-thick fins were
spaced so that there were 10.5 per
inch of tube. The air inlet face was
2 by 3 3/8 in. and the length in the
direction of air flow was 12 inches.
The air-side surface had a total area
of 12.78 ft?. Heat transfer data were
taken at sodium inlet temperatures
between 700 and 1600°F and flow rates
between 1 and 3.5 gpm. The air flow
was varied between 0.06 and 0.16 1b/sec,
which gave a maximum Reynolds number
of 12,000, The maximum air tempera-
ture rise was from 80 to 1100°F.

Additional tests are planned in
which the core element to be used will
have 16 to 18 fins per inch and will
be coated with a thin layer of ceramic
to reduce oxidation.

.dluoride-to-Liquid-Metal Heat
Transfer System. A heat transfer
system has been designed and is under
construction that will transfer heat
from a fluoride to a liquid metal to

air. This system will be tested to
determine endurance, heat transfer
coefficients of fluorides, and the
effect of corrosion, if any, on heat

transfer performance and pressure
drop.

The system, which is being fabri-
cated from Inconel pipe or tubing,
has electric tube-furnace elements
for use as heaters and a double-pipe
intermediate heat exchanger. A
centrifugal gas-sealed pump will be
used for circulating the fluorides,
and an electromagnetic pump will
circulate the liquid metal. Fabri-
cation of the system is approximately
50% complete. Testing is planned over
a range of Reynolds numbers from
laminar to approximately 80,000 at a
maximum fluoride temperature of 1500°F.

INSTRUMENTATION

Pressure Measurement (P. W. Taylor,
ANP Division). Several techniques
are being tested in order to develop
a reliable method of measuring pressures
of high-temperature (1500°F) fluoride
systems. These techniques include a
pressure-sensitive diaphragm, two
null-balance systems and the use of
the Pourdon tube gage.

Bourdon Tube Gage. The Bourdon
tube gage consists of a pressure-pot
facsimile to which gages are attached
through stainless steel and copper
tubing. Experiments with this type
of gage should determine the cause of
gas-line plugging and also the re-
liability of this type of pressure
indicator. The fluid will be pumped
to the pressure pot at 1500°F, but the
gage will be at such a distance from

26

the pot that it can be maintained at
room temperature.

Pressure-Sensitive Diaphragm. A
pressure-measuring instrument con-
sisting of a pressure-sensitive.
Inconel diaphragm, 13 by 1/16 in.,
is being tested. The deflection of
the diaphragm is a linear function of
the pressure exerted upon it. At
60 psi and 1000°F the diaphragm should
deflect approximately 10 mils. The
deflection is sensed by a microformer
transformer that operates a servo dial-
indicating device. The accuracy of
this type of instrument is limited
by the temperature variation of the
sensing element; therefore, the
instrument must be maintained at the
temperature at which it is calibrated.

Nullmatic. A commercial instrument,
the Moore Nullmatic 1:1 pressure
transmitter is being tested. This
pneumatic instrument contains a stain-
less steel bellows and utilizes a
null-balance principle that should
eliminate all temperature effects.
However, since this device 1s not
rated for high-temperature service,
the purpose of the current test is to
determine its performance at high
temperatures when subjected to corrosive
vapors.

G-E Null-Balance Device. A null-
balance transmitter with a corrugated
diaphragm as the pressure-sensitive
element has been built and tested by
the General Electric Company at 1000°F
with good results. This instrument
is now being tested to determine its
performance in the 1500°F range.

Liquid-Level Indicators (A. L.
Southern, ANP Division). Several
different types of liquid-level
indicators are being developed for
use in high-temperature liquid sys-
tems. In addition to level indication,
the indicators can also be adapted for
level control.
Variable-Inductance Level Indi-
cators. The variable-inductance
level indicator consists of a lami-
nated, tapered core enclosed in an
Inconel tube. The pick-up coil 1s
wound on a form 1 in. in diameter and
1 in. long. The design of the coupling
rod between the float and the core
is such that the response of the
indicator is linear for only 10 in.
of the 18-in. level change for which
it was designed. The accuracy of this
indicator is approximately 0,75%.
An endurance run of 1500 hr gave
no trouble, nor was any change en-
countered in the operation of the
indicator. Level can be controlled
with this indicator to 0.5% of the
total indication by using limit
switches on the indicating millivelt
meter. In addition, by using two of
these indicators together a null-
balance system can be obtained that
will hold one level even with another
one.

Bubbler Type of Level Indicator,
A working model of the bubbler-type
of indicator described in the previous
quarterly report(®’ has been designed
and tested to operate over a level
range of 18 inches.

Two tanks were constructed with a
transfer line between them to give
the required level change. The fluo-
ride, NaF-KF-LiF (composition in mole
%:11.5-42.0-46.5), was alternately
pushed from one tank to the other by
gas pressure and the rate of level
change could be varied. A well-type
manometer was used to get a constant
zero and then only one reading was
needed from the manometer. (No. 3
Merian manometer fluid was used in
the manometer.) A Nullmatic pressure
regulator was used to hold a constant
pressure over the liquid, and the
temperature was varied between 1000

 

reid., p. 34.

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

and 1200°F., The gas flow through the
dip tube was indicated by a Fisher
and Porter flowrator. Level control
was accomplished by a "Thermocap™”
capacitance control that worked off of
the fluid in the manometer. The
level in the tank was checked by means
of a variable-inductance pick-up coil
in which inductance was varied by an
iron core mounted on a float.

The accuracy of this type of level
indicator depends on the difference
in specific gravity of the manometer
fluid and the liquid. In this experi-
ment the ratio was 1:3 and the accuracy
of the level was determined to 0.04
inch, The experiment has operated for
140 hr under dynamic conditions, with
over 1000 cycles of operation, and
742 hr under static conditions. As
a result of tests with this model, it
is concluded that the level in a
1500°F fluid system can be reffotely
indicated and controlled by this
technique.

Resonant-Cavity Type of Liquid-
Level Indicator. A liquid-level
indicator that uses the principle of
a resonant cavity has been designed
and will be tested as soon as the
commercial equipment now on order is
delivered. The frequency used will
be in the S-band microwave region,
and all S-band microwave components
will be used. The control signal

will be the energy absorbed by the
cavity. This signal will operate
a servo system which will in turn

contral the frequency of the Klystron
tube. Only simulated experiments
have been made with this indicator
and it will be between three and six
months before the actual tests are
made. This level indicator is well
suited for use in a reactor system
because all parts that will be within
the reactor shield can be made of metal
and thereby eliminate the danger of a
leak or radiation damage.

FLUID DYNAMICS OF THE ARE

Since criticality of the ARE reactor
depends, among other considerations,
upon the amount of fuel in the core of
the reactor and since the present
design of the core presents opportuni-
ties for entrapment of gas or vapor,
a full-size hydraulic model of the
fuel passages is being built (Fig. 10)
of transparent materials for obser-
vation of fluid-flow patterns, gas-
trapping characteristics, and for
testing filling, draining, and emptying
of the system,

has already been built and tested for
filling and emptying. The test system
consisted of six parallel sets of
six loops; each loop had 1/2-in. Tygon
tubing between the inlet and discharge
headers and an appropriate pump,
flowmeter, and tanks external to the
headers. Tests were made with (1) water
and air and (2) 56% zinc chloride in
water (sp. gr. = 1.65) and kerosene
(sp. gr, = 0,82), and the hydraulic
similarity to the reactor was based
on the Reynolds number. Test results
were as follows:

1. With a gradual increase in the
pumping rate, 17 gpm of water was
required to completely fill a system
originally filled with air.

2. With a constant pumping rate,
12 gpm of water was required to fill
the system from all air to all water.

3. With a gradually increasing
pumping rate, 7 gpm of zinc chloride
solution was required to completely
replace the kerosene.

4, With a gradually increasing
pumping rate, 9 gpm of kerosene was
required to completely replace the
zinc chloride solution,

5. 15-psia air failed to remove
the water, kerosene, or zinc chloride
solution from a full system. It did,
however, remove the liquid from any

one circuit fairly completely if the
other five circuits were closed.

6. With a gradual increase of
pumping rate or gas pressure each of
the above removals was stepwise in
character. That is, after replacing
the fluid in one circuit, an increase
in pumping rate was required to replace
the fluid in another of the remaining
parallel circuits. The increases
required were approximately equal
increments for each additional circuit
cleared.
7. At the design flow rate for the
reactor all bubbles were swept through
the tubes, but at considerably lower
flow rates bubbles were observed to
cling to the inside radii of the
bottom bends. It was noticed that a
large bubble would sweep out a col-
lection of smaller bubbles.

TECHNOLOGY OF FLUORIDE HANDLING

Fluoride Production (J. C. White,
ANP Division; F. F. Blankenship,
Materials Chemistry Division). The
need for large-scale testing of
corrosion by fluoride fuels in pump
loop and heat exchanger assemblies
has necessitated the preparation of
the pure fuels inup to 100-1b batches,
The equipment for effecting hydro-
genation and hydrofluorination 1is
being installed in Building 9928, which
has been modified to receive it.

The fluoride-production process
involves six steps (cf., sec, 10 gives
the specific process conditions):

1. Charge the reaction vessel with
an intimate mixture of the components.

2. Treat the charge with HF and
with H, at temperatures below the
melting point.

3. Melt the charge under an inert
atmosphere or one of the treating
gases,

4, Treat the melt at temperatures
in the range of 1500 to 1800°F with
HF and H,.

5. Strip the treating gases from
the melt with inert gas.

6. Filter into areceiver. Control
of batch temperature and atmospheric
pressure is available at all steps.
Mechanical agitation 1s available in
steps 3, 4, and 5. Treating and

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

stripping gases are introduced through
a perforated bubbler. An electrically
driven stirrer will be used to mix the
material during passage of the gaseous
reagents,

The equipment will be able to
produce from 5 to 100 lb of mixture in
a sealed, and easy to sample, receiver
as needed, and should be in operation
by June 15. At that time sufficient
zirconium fluoride should be available
for large-scale production.

Fluoride Removal (D. BR, Ward, ANP
Division). Tests were made to deter-
mine the best practical means for
removing the fluoride salts after
completing the operation of test
equipment. Specimens were prepared
by cutting rings containing solidified
Fulinak from the Inconel tubing used
for a previous test. The specimens
were then soaked in various chemicals
and the degree or ease of fluoride
removal was noted. No solvent for the
fluorides was found. Running water
appeared to be the best practical
fluoride softener, although up to
48 hv was required for softening in
some cases, Also, mechanical assistance
was usually needed. Removal of most
of the fluorides while they are molten
will simplify the final cleaning
problem.

Pretreatment of Pipeline Helium
(L. A. Mann, ANP Division). Pretreat-
ment of the bulk helium supply will be
accomplished by using the following
equipment (in series as listed)
(1) dry-ice cold trap, (2) Nak
bubbler, (3) molten-fluoride bubbler,
(4) water-cooled cold trap. Item 3
was added to previous pretreatments
so that the gas will have at least a
short-time contact with the type of
fluoride material 1t 1s later to
protect, Item 4 was added to remove
gross, condensible vapors. The equip-
ment 1s being constructed.

Pickling Procedures for Fluoride
Containers (D, C. Vreeland, E. E.
Ho ffman, BR. B., Day, L. D. Dyer,
Metallurgy Division). Some experiments
in which various pickling procedures
were used on type-321, -304 and -446
stainless steels and Inconel have
been carried out to determine the
efficiency of the pickling procedures
on these types of alloys. Three-inch
lengths of 1/2-1in. tubing were welded
at one end to subject them to the
oxidizing conditions that occur in

tube preparation prior to static
corrosion testing. After welding,
the tubes were cut in half, longi-~

tudinally, to facilitate observation
of the interior surface of the tube
during and after pickling. Some tests
were conducted on 1 by 1 by 1/4-in.
specimens that had been oxidized in an
air atmosphere furnace at various
temperatures to test the action of
the pickling solutions on oxide
coatings that were heavier than could
be obtained on the welded tubing.
Before pickling, the specimens were
degreased by immersing in a 10%
solution of sodium phosphate at 93°C
for 15 min, and then rinsed in warm
water.

The pickling treatments tried are
listed below. Treatments that were
most successful in these tests were
3 (b) for types—321 and -304 stainless
steel and 4 for type-446 stainless
steel or Inconel. Treatment 4 for
type-446 stainless steel and Inconel
was effective only for light-temper-
colored oxide films, Treatment 3 (b)
for types-304 and -321 stainless steel
appeared to be helpful on all types
of oxides tested, but 1t was most
effective on the thinner coatings.

4. REACTOR PHYSICS

W. K. Ergen, ANP Division

The belief that the circulation of
the fuel causes damping of power
oscillations in all practical cases
has been strengthened further by
theoretical considerations. Further-
more, specific examples have been
computed on the differential analyzer
at the University of Pennsylvania, and
some of the examples show the damping
to be extremely powerful. The damping
will counteract any antidamping
tendencies that the circulating-fuel
reactor, like any other high-powered
reactor, might have for various
reasons,

and
calculations for

The critical-mass power -
distribution circu-
lating-fuel aircraft reactors, although
incomplete, have been directed toward
determining how far it is possible to
go - in the interest of ease of fabri-
cation and mechanical ruggedness ~ in
increasing the fuel tube size and
decreasing the number of tubes. In
fact, the limiting case of a homo-
geneous fluoride reactor with all the
beryllium oxide-moderator in the
reflector was computed (cf., "He-
flector-Moderated Circulating-Fuel
Reactor," sec, 1). The critical mass
in this case is not far different from
the values obtained with multitube
reactors ~ a very gratifying result.
A possible difficulty may be a positive
temperature coefficient due to the
large number of fissions caused by
high-energy neutrons.

Work on the aircraft reactor experi-
ment was directed towards important,
but more or less minor, design questions.
In addition, the large number of ANP

OSCILLATIONS IN THE CIRCULATING-FUEL
AIRCRAFT REACTOR

S. Tamor, ANP Division

The kinetic equations of a somewhat
idealized circulating-fuel reactor,
given in the last ANP quarterly, (1)
were further investigated. At the
beginning of the reporting period it
was known that the power oscillations
are always damped if they are small to
begin with, and it seemed plausible that
even large oscillations are never
antidamped, (2:3)

Solutions of the kinetic equations
for representative values of the
parameters and initial conditions have
been obtained by Professor Cornelius
Weygandt and his staff on the dif-
ferential analyzer of the Univeraity
of Pennsylvania, The data are not
expected to arrive at Oak Ridge before
the end of the present reporting
period, but a preliminary communication
confirms that none of the solutions is
antidamped; and, furthermore, under
some conditions, the damping due to
the circulation of the fuel is so
strong that only an aperiodic motion
without any "ringing" occurs.

As to the general theory of these

equations, it was shown that the power

always stays between an upper and a

lower bound determined by the parameters
of the equation. In other words, there
are certainly no oscillations with
amplitude that increase to infinity,
The practical value of this statement
is somewhat impaired by the fact that
the bounds appear to be serious over-

estimates of the amplitudes, and while

the oscillations themselves may stay
within acceptable limits, if the
bounds were reached, it might mean
destruction of the reactor, It was
shown that no periodic oscillation
other than the ones with period 6/n
can persist,

CALCULATIONS FOR THE
CIRCULATING-FUEL ARE

C. B. Mills, ANP Division

The following results were obtained
fromcalculations assuming NaF-BeF,-UF,
fuel in the circulating-fuel ARE, but
the results are expected to hold for
the recently proposed ZrF,-bearing
fuels:

1. Tf the outermost 12 or 24 fuel
tubes in the core were eliminated,
leaving everything else constant, the
number of tubes could be reduced from
the originally contemplated 78 to 66
or 54. This would mean a decrease in
reactor size, but the reflector size
would increase. The net effect on
total uranium investment would amount
to an increase of only a few per cent
for each of the two groups of 12 tubes
eliminated. Hence, from the uranium
investment viewpoint, there is no
objection to some reduction of the
number of tubes, (*)

2. The fission heating of the ARE
and ANP reactors was investigated. (3)

3. An engineering simplification
in the reactor could be obtained, af
the inert-salt coolant were eliminated.
If the fuel-coolant were circulated,
for cooling purposes, through the
reflector, 6% of the fissions would
occur in the reflector, and the neutron
leakage would increase and shift
somewhat toward higher energies.(%)

From calculations assuming the most
recently proposed ZrF,-bearing fuels,
the following results were obtained. (7)

1. Two fuels were compared; the
inert part (fuel minus UF,) of one
had the following composition (in
mole %): 43% ZrF,, 37% NaF, 20% KF,
and the inert part of the other was
43% ZrF,, 5% NaF, 52% KF. The fuel
with the high KF content gave a
critical mass only 10% greater than
that of the low KF content fuel in
spite of the large K absorption cross
section.

2. The 2-in. Inconel layer around
the reactor does not act appreciably
as a reflector, since the neutron
spectrum is rather low in energy.

3. For the 20% KF content fuel,
the "best guess" for the total uranium
requirement is 124 1b of 93.4% assay
U235, This includes the uranium in
the reactor and the external circuit,
with allowance being made for k,; =

control, and uranium in tube bends at

METHODS FOR REACTOR COMPUTATION
B. T. Macauley C. B. Mills
ANP Division

The Reactor Physics group 1s
attempting to expand its computational
techniques to cover reactors with
hydrogen in the core and/or reflector.
No entirely satisfactory method to
take into account the correlation
between scattering angle and energy
loss has been found, and other un-
solved problems exist. Nevertheless,
correspondence between calculations
and the few available experiments is
quite satisfactory, at least as far as
the critical mass is concerned. No
experimental data are available
regarding power distribution and
neutron spectrum, and this, together
with the above objections on theoretical
grounds, prevents reporting these
attempts for general circulation at
present,

In order to simplify the survey of
variations of the ARE and similar
reactors, the results of the two-group
equations for the critical mass have
been presented, (19) with parameters of
the equations given numerically for
a beryllium oxide moderator. The
equations prove quite valuable, since
they agree within a few per cent with

the results of the machine calculations.

5. CRITICAL EXPERIMENTS

A. D. Callibhan,

The investigation of the direct-
cycle aircraft reactor has continued
during this quarter with the use of
the critical assembly described in the
preceding report. Fission-rate and
neutron-flux measurements have been
made and further changes in reactivity
produced by reflector modifications
have been observed, A significant
rearrangement of the components that
was intended to reduce the neutron
channeling decreased the reactivity to
a degree requiring additional end
reflector to retain a critical system.
This new assembly has a temperature
response similar to that of the
earlier one.

The components of the low-temperature
mockup of the ARE are being assembled
and the fuel composition has been
modified to conform closely with the
present ARE fuel design. Zirconium
oxide is to be substituted for zirconium
fluoride since the latter is unavailable
at this time.

A resume of the results from an
earlier series of experiments with
a graphite-moderated reactor is
included.

Power Distribution. A gross power
distribution throughout the core of the
reactor assembly shown in the pre-
ceding report(!) has been measured by
the usual "catcher-foil" method in
which aluminum placed in contact with
the metallic uranium collects recoiling
fission fragments. The resulting
activity 1s a measure of the fission
rate, This distribution, along the
axis of the reactor, is shown in
Fig. 11 in which the relative activity
is plotted against the distance from
the mid-plane. The distribution is
also shown in a direction parallel to
the axis at three locations on the
periphery of the core. Some fission
rate data were also obtained by count-
ing the induced activity in the uranium
and the results are plotted. It is to
be noted that the two methods

estimated at one dollar, that is, a
change in reactivity of the order of
the delay fraction of fission neutrons.

Control Rod Calibration. All
control rods have been recalibrated
and found to be comparable in value to
those of the shelf-type reactor except
the one at the center, which, as
pointed out above,. does not contain
plastic. Its removal corresponds to a
decrease in reactivity of 29 cents,
whereas each of the other rods corre-
sponds to about 17 cents. This dif-
ference is due to the variation in
neutron distribution caused by the
change in plastic distribution. It is
interesting to note that the cali-
brations of the rods are unaffected by
a transverse gap up to 0.8 in. thick at
the reactor mid-plane.

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

Temperature Effects. The dependence
of reactivity on reactor temperature,
referred to in Fig, 19 of the previous
report, (!) was again examined and found
to be greater for the present assembly.
The current value is 1.46 ¢/°F compared
with 1.25 ¢/°F in the shelf-type
reactor.

Variation of Reactivity with Plastic
Thickness. Also of interest was an
experiment in which the variation in
reactivity with plastic-layer thickness
was measured. The thickness of the
plastic in cells designated by column
K and rows 1 through 16 in Fig. 13 was
varied from 0.5 to 1.25 in. and con-
comitant changes in reactivity were
noted. The void resulting from the
removal of the plastic was not filled
and in the last test one stainless
steel sheet was removed. It was
observed that the reactivity was a
maximum with the plastic 7/8 in. thick
and that it fell sharply with thickness
changes in both directions. A reduction
to 0.5 in. and an increase to 1.25 in.
decreased the reactivity about 10 cents.

Variation of Reactivity with
Separation at Reactor Mid-Plane. The
construction of the assembly in two
parts, one of which 1s movable by
remote control, permitted separating
the core along 1ts mid-plane in an
axial direction. The accompanying
changes in reactivity have been
measured and the results are shown in
Fig. 14 in which the separation of the
parts 1s plotted against the cor-
responding reactivity change. The
accuracy of the separation distances
is no greater than +0.02 inch. The
purpose of the experiment was to
ascertain the degree of operational
safety incorporated in the mechanism
for separating the parts of the
assembly.

CIRCULATING-FUEL REACTOR
BD. Scott, ANP Division

A preliminary, experimental studyof
the nuclear design of the experimental
reactor is to be made during the
summer of 1952 at ORNL by building
some of the major components into a
system that will be made critical with
enriched uranium. The experiments
will be done at a power level of the
order of 1 w, maximum, and at room
temperature, and will yield information
on uranium requirements, control
problems, and power and neutron-flux
distributions, It is expected that
assembly of the mockup will commence
June 1 and that the system will be
made critical around July 15.

Reactor Materials. The beryllium
oxide hexagonal blocks prepared for the
ARE will be used as the reflector and
moderator in these experiments and
transferred to the ARE later. The
fuel is to be a dry-packed powder with
nuclear properties closely approxi-
mating those of the ARE fuel (cf.,
sec, 10). At present the ARE fuel is
designed to be a molten mixture of the

38

QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

fluorides ZxF,, NaF, and UF,, with the
possible inclusion of some KF. In this
preliminary assembly the fuel is
expected to be a mixture of Zr0,, NaF,
enriched UF,, and graphite. The ZrO,
is being substituted for the ZrF,
because the latter is unavailable at
this time; the graphite is being added
to give a total scattering cross
section of oxygen and carbon equivalent
to that of the fluorine. The compo-
sition will be that required to give
the designed uranium density of the
ARE fuel. 1It is probable that the
ratio of zirconium to sodium fluoride
will approach ARE design, but the over-
all density will be somewhat lower.
The simulated reflector coolant of the
ABE to be used in this preliminary
study has the same composition as the
fuel, with the omission of the UF,.

These materials will be packed as a
dry powder in stainless steel tubes,
1 1/4 in. in diameter and 40 in. long,
which can be sealed to minimize moisture
pick-up. The stack of beryllium oxide
blocks will be surrounded by an Inconel
shell.

Reactor Assembly. The beryllium
oxide blocks will be stacked, with
axes vertical, in a right cylinder,
also with its axis vertical, 36 in.
high and 47 in. in diameter. The
fuel and coolant mixtures in stainless
steel tubes will be placed vertically
through the axial holes in the beryllium
oxide blocks. Some of the tubes will
be movable, by remote operation, and
will serve as control rods. A section
of tubing containing a nuclear poison
will be attached above other fuel
elements, The fuel elements will be
magnetically supported. Upon release
by the magnet, the fuel tubes will
fall out of the core and will be
replaced by the poison. This safety
mechanism will be operated both manually
and by a high-flux-level detection
instrument,
will be made for in-
serting neutron-detecting foils, such
as indium and gold, through the re-
flector and moderator. The usual
neutron- and gamma-sensitive detectors
will be placed adjacent to the assembly
for operational control and safety.
They will feed recording and indicating
instruments in the contrel room.

GRAPHITE REACTOR

E. IL. Zimmerman, Physics Division

A critical assembly of enriched
uranium and graphite was described in
earlier reports, (*) and a summary of
the results obtained with this assembly
is given here. The core of the assembly
was essentially a cube 45 by 45 by
44.11 in. covered by a 3-in.-thick
graphite reflector on four sides.

Critical Mass. Although the quantity
of uranium available limited the load-
ing, the assembly became critical with
41.5 kg of U?35, Measurements indi-
cated that little increase in reactivity
would have resulted had uranium been
included in the reflector layer.
Therefore, for purposes of calculation
the reactor was considered to be un-
reflected, with dimensions 51.0by 51.0
by 44.1 in., and to contain 52.48 kg
of U235, The difference between the
two mass values is that required to
fill the 3-in. reflector to the same
uranium density as the core. A multi-
group calculation for the assembly, (5)
in which a value for the buckling, B?,
of 0.0018628 c¢m™2 and an extrapolation
distance of 2 cm were used, gave an
effective multiplication of 0.9912.
The disadvantage factor due to lumping
of the fuel in 0.01-in.-thick disks
was measured and found to be 0.94 %
0.04, which is comparable to the value

rods of the core-removal type were
calibrated by a “rod-drop" method and
by the observation of stable reactor

calibration curves indicated a contri-
bution due to neutron streaming in the
void formed by withdrawing the rod as
well as the expected cosine-sguared
variation. A comparison using a flat
strip of cadmium as a poison rod, which
left essentially no void when removed,
showed good agreement with a cosine-
squared sensitivity curve.

SUMMARY AND

E. P. Blizard
Physics

Measurements of the energy and
angular distribution of gamma rays
from the divided-shield mockup around
the Bulk Shielding Reactor have
continued, and development of the
proton-reco1ll counter for neutron
spectral measurements is progressing
(sec. 6). In another experiment with
this reactor the effect of radiation
from the side of the reactor shield
that scatters in air and penetrates
the crew compartment was measured,
These data for neutrons were reasonable,
but the gamma rays appear to be under-
shielded. The albedo of neutrons and
gamma rays on concrete has been
determined with artificial sources
to facilitate calculations for the
Tower Shielding Facility.

Both GE-ANP and NDA shield design
groups have come upon the difficult
problem of calculating secondary gamma
production from neutrons absorbed or

all data were well known, an extensive
survey was carried out in the Lid Tank.
This survey has enabled both groups to
proceed with their respective designs

(sec. 7).

The air-duct research in the Lid
Tank and Thermal Column Facilities
has continued. The Lid Tank research
has been concentrated on large-scale
mockups of annular designs, and the
Thermal Column work has been on a
series of experiments to provide
primarily a better understanding of
the important attenuation processes

(sec, 8).

The total neutron cross section of

the 5-Mev Van de Graaff. The measure-
ments show only one resonance, which
is at 270 kv. The time-of-flight
spectrometer has been operating
satisfactorily with a full resolution
width of less than 1.2 usec/meter.

The requirements for divided-shield
researchwere explored quite completely
during the past quarter. A set of
experiments at the Bulk Shielding
Reactor was executed to examine the
possibility of testing divided shields

 

on a limited basis, that is, testing
the radiation that penetrates the
side of the reactor shield, air-
scatters, and enters the side wall
of the crew shield. The experiments
were necessarily so unclean that it

43
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

is difficult to extrapolate from the
radiation measured to that to be
expected 1n the aircraft. This fact
is much more meaningful than the
actual results, which on a crude
interpretation seemed to indicate that
the divided shield described in
ANP-53¢(1) was properly designed for
shielding from neutrons but that in
regard to gamma rays it was somewhat

undershielded.

When 1t became apparent that such
partial experiments would not supply
adequate information, considerable
effort was expended in designing a
new facility that would be satis-
factory. To facilitate design work,
other experiments were carried out to
determine the scattering to be ex-
pected from the ground, and calcu-
lations were made to determine the
minimum requirements for power and
altitude. A proposal describing a
divided-shield testing facility has
been prepared and submitted to the
Atomic Energy Commission for review
and possible approval. The study
revealed that if the reactor operates
at 100 kw and the fast-neutron do-
imeter sensitivity 1s increased by a
factor of 10, full-scale divided-
shield mockups can be tested and
optimized. The tower configuration
shown in the last quarterly report
continues to be the favored design.

Measurements of the energy and
angular distribution of gamma rays
from the divided-shield mockup have
continued, and development of the
proton-recoil counter for neutron
spectral measurements 1s progressing.

Shielding Reactor include partial
participation 1n an experiment on the

MOCKUP OF THE DIVIDED SHIELD

Additional gamma-ray spectral
measurements with the divided-shield
mockup(2?) have been obtained and a
report on the spectra measured to date
is being prepared. (3?) Table 2 lists
the spectrometer positions for the
measurements, and Fig. 15 shows spectra
at various distances from the reactor
with and without the divided-shield
mockup. For all the measurements in
Fig. 15 the spectrometer was at zero
degrees, that is, facing the center
of the reactor. From this data
relaxation lengths as a function of
energy have been determined that are
not inconsistent with shielding theory.
An angular distribution has been
plotted from the data obtained at
147.6 cm from the reactor, and the
gamma-ray flux at this position has
been converted to dosage, which may
be compared with ion chamber readings.
Details will be given in the report
being prepared by Maienschein. (3)
A lead shadow shield has been added

later date.

AIR-SCATTERING EXPERIMENTS

During preparation of the Tower
Shielding Facility Proposal, the
question arose as to whether a meaning-
ful experiment on a divided shield
that would include the effect of air
scattering into the crew box could
be carried out in the Bulk Shielding
Facility. An experiment was devised(®)
to determine the attenuation of the
radiation leaving the sides of the
reactor shield, scattering in air,
and penetrating the side wall of the
crew shield. The results of this
experiment were compared with the
standard divided-shield design of the
ANP Shielding Board. (1!)

Shield Arrangement. The standard
divided-shield design 1s shown in
Fig. 16, and the experimental ar-
rangement is shown in Fig. 17. The
water level of the pool was lowered
to a predetermined distance above the
Bulk Shielding Reactor to mock up a
given reactor side shield thickness
for the standard design. Some of the
radiation leaving the surface of the
water above the reactor was scattered
in air and reflected down into the
water about 5 meters away where
measurements were made. By lowering
a counter under the water to a given
depth, the attenuation of the side
wall of the crew shield could be
simulated.

Three lead slabs with a total
thickness of 4.5 in. were placed in
front of the reactor so that the tops
of the slabs were at an angle to the
center of the Bulk Shielding Reactor
that corresponded to the angle of
interception of the gamma rays by
the lead in the divided-shield design.
The lead slabs plus the approximately
5 meters of water essentially blacked
out the direct beam of both neutrons

and gamma rays toward the point of
measurement.

Radiation Dosage at Crew Com-
partment. The experimental results
are shown in Figs. 18 and 19. Data
were taken at 30, 60, and 90 cm above
the active core of the reactor. In
Fig. 18 the neutron-dosage rate is
plotted against the distance of the
counter from the water surface. As
the counter went below the water
surface a sharp break in each curve
was noted and the break was taken to
define the position of the surface of
the water. Similar data for gamma-ray
dosage is shown in Fig. 19. The
uncorrected data are given else-
where. (®)

As can be seen in the standard
design (Fig. 16), the thickness of
the reactor shield side wall was
113 cm, which is equivalent to 116 cm
of water if corrections for the fast-
neutron cross sections of beryllium
carbide, iron, and gasoline are made.
Since it was necessary to run the
reactor at its maximum power to obtain
data with 90 cm of water over the
reactor, the neutron data were ex-
trapolated to 116 cm, as shown in
Fig. 18. At the position of the
detector below the water corresponding
to the thickness of the side wall of
the crew shield the dose was 8 X 1078
mrep/hr/w.

For the gamma-ray measurements the
effective thickness of the reactor
shield side wall was obtained from
the pt(density times thickness)of the
standard design, which was 142 g/cm?
(Fig. 16). Since this is equivalent
to 142 cm of water, the gamma-ray
data were extrapolated to that value
(Fig. 19). The value observed through
17.8 cm of water at the crew position
was 5.4 X 10°7 r/he/w without any
lead. Referring to Fig. 16, it can
be seen that the standard design
called for 1.54 cm of lead on the

water-tight container for an anthracene-

structed, The container had 3 in. of
lead on the sides, 1 in. of lead on

Sheets of lead varying in thickness
up to 1 in. were placed on top of the

below the surface of the water at the

curve for lead absorption is shown in

much lead would weigh approximately
25,000 pounds. Perhaps considerable
savings 1n welght could be made by
placing the lead in the reactor
shield. The experiment gave no in-
formation concerning such a dis-
position of the lead.

The approximations made in con-
verting the experimental dosage rate

to that expected in the airplane

configuration are admittedly crude.
Furthermore, the effect of the walls
of the pool and building in scattering
the radiation back to the point of
detection has not been determined.
However, the disconcerting fact re-
mains that the neutron data 1s 1in
rough agreement with the calculations
of the Shielding Board, whereas the
gamma-ray dosage appears to be high
by a factor, which, while less than
50, seems to be at least as highas 15.
Further experiments, at 100 kw reactor
power, are contemplated to verify or
correct this high factor.

DETERMINATION OF THE
NEUTRONS AND GAMMA

To aid in the calculations of
backgrounds at the proposed Tower
Shielding Facility several short
experiments (8) were performed to
determine the reflection of neutrons
and gamma rays. By using a neutron
source and the fast-neutron dosimeter
shown in Fig. 21, measurements were
made with the source and counter at
varying heights above the concrete
floor in the Bulk Shielding Reactor.

By using the relation®®’

where F is the scattered flux, Nj is
the source strength, and d is the
distance above the floor, the albedo,

for concrete. A similar experiment
in which an ion chamber and a Cof?°
source with lead shielding was used
gave the reflection coefficient of
gamma rays on concrete as 0.04.

Physics Division

A series of short experiments on
the gamma-ray attenuation of heavy
materials (iron and lead) in regions
close to the source have been completed
in the Lid Tank. The experiments
planned to aid in the design of both
thermal and shadow shields for various
aircraft reactors were necessary
because of the difficulty of calculating
the production of neutron-induced
secondary gamma rays in these regions.

63% IRON-37% WATER THERMAL SHIELD

Specific shield configurations
requested by Goldstein of NDA for
possible use in the supercritical-water
reactor are shown as part of Figs, 22
through 26. The iron-water mixtures
were placed at various distances from
the source to simulate the varying
water-reflector thicknesses present in
the reactor design; although the
reactor is cylindrical, it is sur-
rounded by a spherical pressure shell
and thermal shield.

54

The shield configurations were
mocked up with one to six 2.22-cm iron
slabs separated by 1.3 cm of water,
and they were placed at various
distances from the source. In each
series the sixth slab was moved forward
to touch the preceding slab to simulate
a pressure shell, as shown in Fig. 26.
The measurements were made with both
an air-filled 1onization chamber and
an anthracene scintillation counter.

Figure 27 indicates the gamma-ray
dosage distribution in water, and
Figs. 22 through 26 give the gamma-ray
measurements behind the i1ron-water
thermal shields. A curve of the dose
at a constant z (distance from the
source) as a function of the water
thickness between the source and the
nearest iron slab (referred to as
reflector thickness) is also shown.
The tabulated "z measurements to back
of last slab" (inset in each figure)
are probe measurements of the distance
from the source to the back of the
last slab in each array. As would be
expected, the data indicate that for
thick thermal shields the secondary
gamma-ray production is predominant
up to rather large reflector thickness
(i.e., 20 cm).

63% IRON-37% BORATED WATER
THERMAL SHIELD

A 0%... APY the effect of borating
the water in the region of the thermal
shield was made to determine the
resulting reduction of secondary gamma-
ray production (Figs. 28, 29, 30).
The configurations were chosen to
match the neutron and gamma-ray leakage
in the I.id Tank with that of the
reactor on the basis of a calculation
by Goldstein. A scale-up factor was
also calculated and used to determine
the required Lid Tank dosage beyond
the thermal shield. The 2.22-cm iron
slabs were separated by the borated
water, and since sufficient attenuation
was obtained with a four-slab (27%
borated water) thermal shield, attenu-
ation of the pressure shell (two
adjacent slabs) was then measured

(Fig. 30). The measurements were made
with the 10!'° jonization chamber
(air-filled).

A comparison of attenuation of the
borated-water thermal shield with that
of the unborated-water shields previ-
ously measured indicates that at this
reflector thickness (20 cm) a reduction
in intensity to 70% of the iron-water
case (at z = 80 cm) was obtained. The
reduction of intensity as the water
reflector thickness was increased to
30 cm indicates that secondary gamma-
ray production 1s not entirely sup-
pressed by the 1% boration of the
thermal shield water. This is not
surprising in view of the large volume
percentage of iron in this region.
There may also be some inelastic
scattering of gamma rays, which would
of course not be affected by the
boron.

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

SOLID IRON THERMAL SHIELD IN WATER

As a continuation of the thermal
shield investigation, the gamma-ray
attenuation of a 9-cm iron thermal
shield was measured for the GE-ANP
design group. Four 2.2-cm iron slabs
were clamped together and placed in
the Lid Tank at various distances from
the source, as indicated in Fig. 31.
Since the iron slabs are not flat,
water (approximately 0.3 cm) was
present in the space between adjacent
slabs.

The measurements presented in
Fig. 31 were obtained with the usual
air-filled ionization chamber, which
is, unfortunately, neutron-sensitive
owing to the nitrogen (n,p) reaction.
This invalidates the measurements
close to the iron, but since the
neutron relaxation length in water
behind solid iron is short (4 to
6 cm), the neutron effect should be
negligible beyond about 30 cm of
water. Measurements that indicate
the magnitude of the neutron effect
and confirm the fact that it 1s
negligible beyond 30 cm have been
made on similar mockups by using CO,
in the ionization chamber.

SOLID LEAD SHADOW SHIELDS IN WATER

Measurements were taken in the Lid
Tank at the request of GE-ANP to
determine the effect of various water-
reflector thicknesses on the gamma
attenuation of solid lead shadow
shields, Since the experiment was
performed in water, a large amount of
secondary gamma-ray production reduced
the effectiveness of the lead by a
factor greater than 40 in the worst
case. As the thickness of the water
layer between the source and the lead
was increased, the secondary gamma-
ray production was, of course, reduced
at a rate equivalent to the neutron
attenuation of the water.

55

The gamma-ray measurements for the
shadow shields consisting of one, two,

Duct work in the Thermal Column(1)
has continued to obtain further experi-
mental corroboration of the simplified
duct theory(?) of neutron transmission
through cylindrical air-filled ducts
in water. Measurements have been made
on ducts with two and three bends to
supplement the data previously reported
on straight ducts and ducts with one
bend. Some effort has been made to
determine what portion of the flux
measured by the counter is due to
neutrons suffering at least one col-
lJision in the walls of a straight duct;
the measured contribution appears to
be somewhat higher than was predicted
theoretically, Agreement with the
theory has remained good; however, the
value of the constant A, which con-
cerns the albedo at the corners and
other factors assumed to be constant,
had to be redetermined,.

An extensive survey of the radiation
transmitted by the annular air ducts
designed by G.E. has been started. The
lid Tank will be used for this survey
for approximately six weeks,

DUCT TESTS IN THE THERMAL COLUMN

Straight Ducts. Various lengths of
a straight, 4 1/4-in.-d1a aluminum-wall
(1/8 in. thick) duct were measured, A
circular fission source (4 3/8 in. in
diameter) was used for all the 4 1/4-
in.,-dia duct measurements. Typical
curves for the neutron transmission
measured along an extension of the
duct center lines are given in Fig. 35.

Ducts with Bends. Neutron measure-
ments were made on the 4 1/4-in.-dia
ducts with one to three bends formed
by 20-in. straight sections joined at
45 deg angles. Further experimental
data for the angular correlation were
obtained by using three ducts with
single sharp bends of various angles
(31, 65, and 90 deg). Typical duct
configurations are shown in Fig. 36.

To prevent neutrons from traveling
the full length of the ducts in air
without scattering at the bend, the
smallest angle of bend afforded more
than a one~diameter displacement of
the center of the duct. Measurements
of the neutron transmission along the
duct center lines are givenin Fig. 37.

Wall-Scattering Experiment. The
duct transmission theory that has been
used ignores all wall-scattering except
at the bends, so the attenuation of
each straight section is proportional
to the square of its length, If

straight sections is considered, a
component attenuated according to the
cube of the length should be added.
Therefore, an axperiment was carried
out to investigate the magnitude of
the inverse-cube component.

A 6~in.-dia by 36-in. duct (plastic
wall) and a fission source (6 in. in
diameter) were mounted in the Thermal
Column water tank so that the level of
the water surrounding the vertical
duct could be varied. A counter was
mounted 10 cm from the upper end of
the duct and surrounded by a small
volume of water, as shown in Fig. 38.
The neutron flux was then measured as
a function of the depth of water
around the duct.

A second set of measurements was
made with the upper two-thirds of the
duct filled with water. This prevented

the neutrons that would ordinarily
travel the length of the duct in air
from reaching the counter. The dif-
ference of the two curves should give
the flux contributed by scattering in
the walls,

According to calculations¢?) the
ratio of the flux contributed to the
counter by the neutrons that make one
collision in the walls to those which
travel the full length of the duct
directly in air is approximately equal
to mr/2L, where r is the radius of the
duct and L is the length. For a 6-in.-
dia by 36-in. duct the ratio should be
approximately 0.15, which is about a
factor of 3 lower than the ratio found
in the experiment. The curve in Fig.
37 shows that the "contribution is not
linear but peaks at the end of the
duct farthest from the source.

Comparison with Theory. The results
of the measurements with both the
straight and bent aluminum-wall ducts
indicate good agreement with the theory

(Fig. 39). If agreement were perfect,
all the curves in Fig. 39 would
coincide. The spread indicates the

errors in predictions of attenuations,
which in some cases are as much as 10.
A new value for A, the constant
independent of duct geometry, has
been obtained that gives a better
prediction of the transmitted dose.
The redetermination of A was necessary
because of the two- and three-bend
experimental results.

Preliminary measurements of the
wall-scattered components are higher
than was predicted by the theory. The
discrepancy is for the most part the
result of degradation in energy of the
neutrons.
were made,

Since thermal measurements
the degraded neutrons were

72

counted efficiently. The position of
the counter was approximately 10 cm
from the end of the duct to corre-
spond to the 10-cm point used in the.
previous duct measurements. Calcu-
lations of the scattered components
for these points werealso high compared
with the theory. Tf, however, the
20-cm points of the previous duct
measurements are compared with the
theory, the agreement 1s markedly
improved, which is in accordance with
the above reasoning.

Except for the three points nearest
the source, the shape of the curve
shown in Fig. 37 1s about what would
be expected. Failure of the initial
points to agree with the theory is not
understood, and plans are being made
to repeat this experiment under
different conditions,

GE-ANP ANNULAR AIR DUCTS

Mockups of the inlet and outlet air
ducts that penetrate the shield in the
G-E"direct-cycle design have been
supplied by G.E. foralid Tank experi-
ment, Measurements will be made to
provide complete neutron and gamma-ray
isodose plots in the water shield sur-
rounding the duct. Such plots will
indicate points of excessive leakage
that may require additional shielding.

A schematic diagram of the outlet
air duct is shown in Fig. 40. The
steel section between the source and
the duct consists of alternate 1 1/2-
in. air and water layers perpendicular
to the source and simulates the
transition region (perforated re-
flector) in the reactor design. A
photograph of the inlet air duct and
transition region is shown in Fig. 41.

and quaternary fluoride systems have
been examined, and a number of compo-
sitions in the NaF-ZrF -UF, and
NaF-KF-ZrF,-UF, systems with as much
as 4 mole % UF, have been shown to
have melting points around 500°C.
Although it is not certain that either
of these fluoride mixtures can be used
with the envisioned loading technique,
preliminary data are encouraging. A
substantial program of research and
pilot~scale production of liquid fuels
of high purity and a study of high-
temperature transfer methods have
recently been initiated.

The corrosion research effort was
divided among static and dynawic tests
of fluorides, hydroxides, and liquid
metals, with the fluoride corrosion
tests predominating (sec. 11). Static
tests and the modified dynamic tests
(seesaw tests) that have been developed
are useful for screeninga large number
of samples but are inadequate for
precisely predicting the corrosiveness
of a circulating liquid. However,
the tests have shown that small
additions of sodium, potassium,
manganese, and calcium are beneficial
in minimizing fluoride corrosion.

Various fluoride mixtures were
circulated in thermal convection loops
during the past quarter. Stainless
steel loops generally plug after short
periods, whereas Inconel loops con-
sistently operate for upto 1000 hours.
Some reduction in dynamic fluoride
corrosion has been obtained as a

result of improved fluoride- and loop-
preparation techniques. Fluoride
attack on Inconel is believed to be
the result of chromium diffusion out
of the metal lattice. A considerable
program of corrosion research om both
hydroxides and fluorides has been
undertaken.

The metallurgical processes involved
in the construction and assembly of a
high-temperature reactor, including
fabrication of control rods, welding
and brazing, and fabrication of solid
fuel elements, are being successfully
developed (sec. 12). Brazing alloys
were tested for flowability, corrosion
resistance, and joint strength, and
the 60% Pd-40% Ni alloy proved superior
in a fluoride environment. Powder
mixtures of B,C with Fe and with Al, O,
are being hot pressed for the safety
and regulating rods, respectively, of
the ARE. Loose-powder sintering has
been investigated as a technique for
the fabrication of solid fuel elements.

Heat transfer and physical property
measurements on the various fluorides
have continued, together with some
measurements on hydroxides (sec. 13).
Determinationsof viscosity, thermal
conductivity, density, heat capacity,
and vapor pressure have been made on
several fluoride mixtures. It is
apparent that the physical properties
of the ZrF -bearing fuels are compatible
with reactor design requirements. In
particular, the viscosity, which was
so high in the NaF-BeF,-UF, fuel
mixture as to necessitate ats rejection,
is less than 10 centipoises for the
NaF-KF-Zr¥ -UF, fuel mixture at all
reactor temperatures. Mathematical
analyses pertaining to circulating
fuel heat transfer systems have been
developed: A measurement of the heat

transfer coefficient of molten sodium
hydroxide showed it to be similar to
that of ordinary fluids rather than
liquid metals.

Pile irradiations of proposed fuel
mixtures in Inconel capsules comprised
the greater part of the effort on the
radiation damage program, although
measurements have continued on inpile
creep and thermal conductivity of
metals (sec. 14). Irradiation of

CHEMISTRY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIQUIDS

W. R. Grimes

Materials Chemistry Division

Researchon high-temperature liquids
has been concerned almost entirely
with their development for use as
fuels for an aircraft reactor. In
addition, some effort has been devoted
to the purification of alkali hydroxides
and the determination of the high-
temperature properties of these
materials. The principal research
work has been the phase equilibrium
studies necessary to define the optimum
concentration of the fuels, and, in
conjunction with others, the de-
termination of the physical properties
and corrosiveness of these high-temper-
ature systems. It has also been
necessary to intensify the efforts to
identify chemical species 1n the
cooled melts by x-ray diffraction and
other techniques.

Research on liquid fuels is still
directed toward development of low-
melting-point solutions of UF, in
mixtures of permissible fluorides.
The experimental reactor (the ARE)
will require about 16 1b of U?3% per
cubic foot of fuel solution, so it
will be necessary to incorporate about

4 mole % of UF, in the fluoride fuel.

82

A number of compositions in the
NaF -Zr¥F, -UF, and NaF-KF-ZrF,-UF,
systems with as much as 4 mole % UF,
have been shown to melt below 550°C.
In addition, it has been demonstrated
that the viscosity of typical mixtures
of these materials is sufficiently
low for successful operation (cf.,
13). For easy startup, it 1s
necessary to fill the reactor with a
dilute (subcritical) fuel and add
small increments of a concentrated
solution to bring the system to
criticality. This requires that
solutions of widely varying uranium
content and melting points considerably
below the operating range be available
and that no high-melting-point com-
pounds be formed at 1ntermediate
concentrations. It is not yet certain,
although preliminary data are en-
couraging, that the NaF-KF-ZrF,-UF,
system meets this requirement.

sec.

A substantial program of research
and pilot-scale production of liquid
fuels of high purity and a study of

high~temperature transfer methods
have recently been 1nitiated. A
smaller program for the study of
wr

chemical reactions of high-temperature
fluorides and hydroxides is presently
concerned with reactions that may
help to explain the corrosion behavior
of these liquids. Toward this end, a
guenching apparatus for studying
solid phases in the NaF-BeF,-UF,
system has been placed in operation,
and x-ray examination of complex
mixtures in the NaF-KF-ZrF, system
has yielded valuable information as
to species present.

Experimental preparation of simu-
lated fuel for the cold critical
experiment has been continued. Speci-
fications for the powdered mixture
can be completed as soon as the
actual ARE fuel composition is fixed.

LOW-MELTING-POINT FLUORIDE FUEL SYSTEMS

I.. M. Bratcher R. E. Traber, Jr.
C. J. Barton

Materials Chemistry Division

The high viscosity of the melts
has virtually eliminated the BeF,-
bearing salt mixtures from consideration
as ARE fuels, and the emphasis 1s now
being placed on systems containing

ZrF,.

In the previous report!) it was
indicated, on the basis of very
limited data, that the addition of
1 to 5 mole % UF, to systems con-
taining ZrF, affected the melting
point only slightly. Further 1in-
vestigation has shown that the ad-
dition of 1 or 2 mole % UF, depresses
the melting point of most alkali
fluoride~zirconium tetrafluoride
mixtures slightly but that further
additions produce an increase 1n
melting point.

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

The first separation of a solid
phase from these fused mixtures is
frequently accompanied by a small
thermal effect that makes detection
of melting points by thermal analysis
difficult. In several instances a
second break, probably corresponding
to a eutectic temperature, has been
mistaken for the melting point. Some
difficulty has been experienced with
poor reproducibility of data. This
may be due in part to sensitivity of
the melting point to variances in the
ZrF, concentration in the fused
mixtures. Loss of ZrF, may result
from both volatilization and con-
version to zirconium oxide., These
phenomena will be investigated in
detail as soon as possible.

NaF-KF-ZrF, -UF,. Most of the
effort on ZrF,-bearing fuels has been
concentrated on the NaF-KF-ZrF, -UF,
system, since preliminary studies
indicated that it was most likely to
produce a suitable fuel. Heating
and cooling curves have been run on
a large number of mixtures containing
4 mole% UF, and varying concentrations
of the other three fluorides. The
rather small thermal effect noted
when the first solids crystallize
from these systems has encouraged
the use of larger samples (200 to
300 g) in these studies. Zirconium
tetrafluoride purified by vacuum
sublimation was used in all the ex-
periments reported.

The data in Table 3 show the ex-
pected melting points when 4 mole %
UF, is added to various mixtures in
the NaF-KF-ZrF, system. The data are
not sufficiently complete to state
the optimum fuel composition at
present. It is obvious, however,
that fuels with melting points below
550°C can be obtained over fairly
wide ranges of NaF-KF and ZrF, con-
centration. These studies are being
continued to define the optimum
concentration.

positions in the KF-ZrF,-UF, system,

tested. Since all these mixtures
showed melting points at about 600°C
(about 150°C higher than the corre-
sponding KF~ZrF, binaries), it is not
likely that a satisfactory fuel
exists in this ternary system.

in behavior of the NaF-ZrF, -UF, and
KF-ZrF,-UF, systems is certainly due
to the strong tendency of KF to form
stable, high-melting«point compounds
with UF,.

NaF-RbF-2rF,-UF,. A few mixtures
have been investigated in the NaF-
RbF-ZrF, -UF, system to determine
whether substitution of RbF for KF
would result in lower melting points.
Data obtained with such mixtures
(Table 6) indicate that RbF has no
decided advantage over KF as a com-
ponent of a ZrF, fuel as far as
melting point is concerned.

Spectrographic Analysis (Russell
Baldock, Stable Isotope Research and
Production Division). Efforts to
develop a mass spectrometer method
for investigation of aircraft fuels
has been delayed by the discovery
that the molecular fragmentation
patterns of the fuel ingredients were
more complex than was anticipated.
In particular, the Ur, dissociation
pattern was largely masked by the
superposition of the dissociation
fragments from UF,. It is now believed
that the UF, comes from UO,F,, which
is a contaminant in the UF,, and
arrangements are being made to use
some isotopically enriched ingredients
to establish the origin and magnitude
of the UF,. The presence of UF, as
a contaminant in fuel mixtures could
give rise to considerable corrosion.

The investigations of elemental
compounds are summarized 1m the
following statements. Uranium tri-
fluoride dissociates at temperatures
above 700°C into UF, and uranium
metal, 1n agreement with findings
reported in the literature, but at
lower temperatures than heretofore
reported. No evidence of the subli-
mation of UF;, as such, could be
found at temperatures up to 750°C
with the mass spectrometer or up to
1000°C in sublimation tests. Even
UF; prepared by the reduction of

UF, with uranium metal shows some
evidence of higher valence compounds
of uranium that give rise to UF; on
heating. All unheat-treated UF,
examined has shown pronounced evidence
of UF, contamination when examined in
the mass spectrometer.

Study of Solid Phases in the
NaF-BeF,-UF, System (A. G. H. Andersen,
ANP Division, and C. J. Barton,

Materials Chemistry Division). A
study of the solid phases in the
NaF-BeF,-UF, system was initiated at
the time beryllium fuel was being
considered for use in the ARE. Since
a fuel composition in this system may
be suitable for use in a reactor
design not requiring a low viscosity
fuel, this study has been continued.

A furnace has been set up for the
heat treatment of fluorides or fluoride
mixtures sealed in quartz tubes under
a vacuum. The furnace is arranged
so that a number of samples can be
heat-treated simultaneously and
quenched by dropping into liquid
nitrogen or some other quenching
The quartz capsules are
heated to a definite temperature
(+10°C) for intervals ranging from
16 to 60 hr and then quenched or
cooled slowly. The samples are then
examined with a petrographic micro-
scope and by x-ray diffraction.

In the UF,-BeF, system, three
crystalline phases have been identified:
UF,, BefF,, and UO,. In addition, a
BeF, glass 1s present in mixtures
high in BeF,. This glass can be
converted into crystalline BeF, by
long heating at 300 to 600°C. The
UO, present is produced either by
hydrolysis or oxidation of the UF,
during the original sample preparation.
An unidentified phase appeared in a

SIMULATED FUEL MIXTURE FOR COLD
CRITICAL EXPERIMENT

D. R. Cunes L. G. Overholser
Materials Chemistry Division

The lack of complete definition of
the ABE fuel has prevented preparation
of final specifications for the
simulated fuel for the ARE critical
experiment. Since the ARE fuel will
probably contain ZrF,, NaF, KF, and
UF,, experimental studies have been
confined to mixtures containing these
fluorides.

Lack of an adequate supply of
hafnium-{ree ZrF, has made necessary
the substitution of Zr0, in the powder
mixture. Carbon is also added to
the mixture to compensate for the
difference in moderating power of the
ZrO, and ZrF,.

Calcination of the hafnium-free
ZrO, at 800°C is sufficient to reduce
the water content to below 0.1%.
Sodium fluoride has been shown to be
sufficiently pure and dry as received,

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 190, 1952

but some samples of KF may require

vacuum drying.

By grinding UF,, ZrO,, NaF, KF, and
activated carbon in a small ball mill
and by packing the mixed powder into
stainless steel tubes, 1t has been
possible to obtain a bulk density of
about 1,8. The powder so packed can
be made to show a uniform uranium
density of the proper value, and no
detectable segregation of the UF,
occurs with normal handling. By
use of reasonable precantioms, such
as drying of the ZrO, and KF and
subsequent handling of the powders in
a dry box and a sealed ball mill,
the water content of the final mixture
can be kept below 0.2%. The hydrogen-
to-uranium ratio that may be tolerated
corresponds roughly to 0.5% H,0 in
the mixture.

Grinding, blending, and canning of
the fuel and the preparation of the
large quantity of uranium-free base
material for the plenum chamber will
be started soon after the final ARE
fuel composition is chosen.

PREPARATION OF PURE HYDROXIDES

E. £. Ketchen L.. G. Overholser
Materials Chemistry Division

The only experimental work on
moderator-coolants during the past
quarter has been concerned with
purification of several of the alkala
hydroxides. Sodium hydroxide with
less than 0.1% Na,CO,; has been con-
sistently prepared, and a practical
technique for the removal of carbonate
and sodium ions from LiOH bas been
developed. Pure KOH has been prepared
both by removing the carbonate from
commercial material and by the re-
action of potassium and water. The
latter technique 1s expected to
ultimately produce the purest products;
however, the best material prepared

89
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

to date by either method has con-
tained 0.10% K,O,.

Sodium Hydroxide. Because of
continued interest in purified NaOH,
additional batches have been prepared
by the method in which Na,CO; is
removed by filtration from a 50%
aqueous solution of NaOH and the
clear supernatant liquid is dehydrated
under vacuum at 450°C. The material
has assayed 100.0% NaOH, and the
Na,CO, content has been less than
0.1% in all runs.

Lithium Hydroxide. A limited
amount of work has been devoted to
the purification of LiOH by using
the apparatus previously described?)
for the purification of Ba(OH),.
Since the method proved to be ef-
fective in removing the two major
impurities, sodium and carbonate ions,
it appears to be a practical procedure
for the preparation of very pure
L10OH when the demand warrants such
production.

Potassium Hydroxide. The major
effort has again been devoted to the
preparation of pure KOH by removing
the carbonate as BaCO,; in an aqueous
medium and dehydrating the filtrate
under vacuum at 475°C. Determination
of the solubility of BaCO; as a
function of KOH concentration in-
dicated that the minimum carbonate
content could be obtained if a KOH
concentration of 45 to 50% were used.
Under these conditions it appeared
possible to prepare a product con-
taining carbonate equivalent to 0.07%
K,CO,. To date,

preparation probably approaches the
lowest value possible by this method.
Substitution of Ca(OH), for Ba(OH),
to precipitate the carbonate proved
unsatisfactory.

One run has been made in which
pure potassium was reacted with excess
water and the resultant solution of
KOH was dehydrated by heating under
vacuum at 500°C. The apparatus used
allowed very slow addition of water
and removal of both hydrogen and
heat, thus the reaction occurred under
carefully controlled conditions. The

very pure atmosphere can be attained
will be used in future work, and the
dehydration system will be modified
to improve its vacuum performance.
With these refinements it is expected
that a purer product will be obtained.

COOLANT DEVELOPMENT

L. M. Bratcher R. E. Traber, Jr.

Materials Chemistry Division

The studies of uranium-free fluo-
ride systems to determine their
possibilities as coolants as well as
fuel solvents have been confined to
systems containing ZnF, and ZrF, for
which preliminary data have been
presented previously. (*) It now
appears that the previous data on
systems containing ZrF, was influenced
by the presence of ZrO, or ZrOF, in
the samples studied. Sublimed ZrF,
of high purity became available in
quantity during the past quarter and
has been used in all the studies

data obtained with the highly pure
material ‘have helped to clarify the
phase relationships to some extent.
It should be emphasized, however, that
the applicationof the thermal analysis
technique to the study of alkali
fluoride-zirconium fluoride systems
has not yet produced completely
satisfactory phase equilibrium dia-
grams. The diagrams presented here
should be regarded as tentative and
subject to revision after further
study. Thermal studies are being
supplemented by examination of solid
phases by means of the petrographic
microscope and x-ray-diffraction
equipment. The results of these
studies are given elsewhere in this
report.

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

The two- and three-componentsystems
containing ZnF, have not shown melting
points sufficiently low to be of
interest at present; however, they
may be of value as constituents of
more complex mixtures.

NaF-ZrF,. Cooling curves for the
NaF-ZrF, system have been obtained
from a large number of mixtures con-
taining from 5 to 60 mole % ZrF,,
but the data obtained do not give a
satisfactory phase diagram. The
compound NaZrF, melts at 510 + 10°C
and thereis a eutectic at approximately
43 mole% ZrF, that melts at 480 # 10°C.

KF-ZrF,. Thermal breaks for KF-ZrF,
mixtures containing from 5 to 65
mole % ZrF, are shown in Fig. 43.

The melting point of the eutectic

earlier.(®) The data indicate ad-
ditional eutectics at 42 and 55 mole
% ZrF, with melting points at 430 and
440°C, respectively. The compound
KZrF, appears to melt congruently at
445°C. The compound K,ZrF, probably
exists, but efforts to determine its
melting point with fused mixtures of
KF and ZrF, and with commercially
obtained material have been un-
successful. Data on mixtures con-
taining more than 65 mole % ZrF, are
unreliable because of the volatility

of ZrF,.

is 880°C. The eutectic at about 40

There is probably a compound RbZrF
melting at 425 * 10°C. The data at
55 and 60 mole % ZrF, do not show
whether the compound melts congruently.

NaF-KF-ZnF,. Not enough datahave
been obtained for the NaF-KF-ZnF,

of contour lines accurately. The
lowest melting point found was 626°C
for the mixture containing 25 mole

The cooling curves do not indicate
that any lower melting compositions
exist in the system, so no further

FUEL PREPARATION AND LIQUID HANDLING
F. F. Blankenship

Materials Chemistry Division

Because of the need for liquid
fuel samples for chemical examination,
physical property evaluation, and
corrosion testing, a program for
preparation of the molten liquids on
research and pilot-plant scales has
been started. The need for materials
of high purity for the final reactor
fuel, as well as the indications that
corrosion by the liquids 1s strongly
dependent on purity of the materials,
has airected the research program to
a study of feasible methods for

preparation of very pure liquids and
methods for handling the liquids to
minimize contamination.

Preparation of pure ZrF, has been
accomplished by vacuum sublimation of
impure commercial preparations and
incompletely hydrofluorinated materi-
als available in this laboratory.
The preparation of this material will
be handled in the future by the Y-12
Production Division; a supply of up
to 50 lb per week of pure, sublimed
ZrF, will be available after about
June 15.

The preparation of pure liquid
fuels of various types has, apparently,
been accomplished on a research (5-1b
batch) scale. Installation of similar
equipment to turn out 10- to 100-1b
batches for larger scale testing
should be complete by the time the
ZrF, production permits their use.

Zirconium Fluoride Production
{C. M. Blood, J. E. Eorgan, G. J.
Nessle, Materials Chemistry Division).
The sudden large demand for ZrF,,
which developed when mixtures con-
taining BeF, were shown to be un-
satisfactory, could not be met without
delay. Delivery from commercial
suppliers was slow, and their products
contained up to 20% of ZrO, and ZrOF,.

The commercial material has been
purified satisfactorily by vacuum
sublimation in nickel equipment
capable of handling 1 to 1.5 kg of
material per charge. The sublimers
are 4-1in. cylinders, 18 inches in
length, containing disk-shaped baffles
arranged to provide a tortuous path
for the vapor. An air-cooled finger
suspended from the gasketed lid
serves to condense the pure ZrF,.
Thermocouples and inert gas and vacuum
connections are introduced through
the lid.

The output of the sublimers has
increased, along with the supply of

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1932

raw material, to about 10 kg per
week. The best index of purity of
the material has been examination of
the product with the petrographic
microscope to ascertain uniformity
and the presence of not more than
trace quantities of Zr0,.

With the equipment and charge
material available at present it
appears that the sublimation of 1500-g
portions is best conducted at 800°C
for about 4 hr at a pressure of 450
microns. Under these conditions
virtually all the ZrF, is volatilized
and about 80% of the material 1s
deposited on the cold finger. The
rest is deposited on the upper portion
of the cylinder walls and 1s added
to another batch te be sublimed.

Under optimum conditions the product
is snow-white. However, a slightly
green coloration appears, which 1in-
creases with time, temperature, and
decreasing pressure. This discoloration
seems to be from nickel fluoride
formed by attack by HF, which is
formed from the hydrolysis of ZrF, by
the trace of water it contains.

Arrangements have been completed
for the Y-12 Production Division to
supply 50: 1b per week of pure, sublimed
ZrF, beginning in mid-June. The
plant for hydrofluorination of hydrous
zirconium oxide and sublimation of
the product is scheduled to be finished
June 1. This plant, which should be
capable of double the design figure
1f necessary, is also adaptable to the
use of hafnium-free ZrO, when this
becomes desirable.

PREPARATION OF PURE FUEL MIXTURES

C. M. Blood A. J. Weinberger.
F. P. Boody G. J. Nessle

Materials Chemistry Division

Several impurities are known to be
present in the materials that are

91
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

incorporated in the fuel preparations.
The sodium and potassium fluorides
are hygroscopic and contain up to
0.4% H,0 and about 200 to 300 ppm
of sulfur, mostly as sulfate. The
ZrF, even after sublimation contains
traces of ZrO, and probably ZrOF,

The commercial UF, contains small
amounts of water, up to 1% of hexa-
valent uranium probably as vo,Fr,, and
traces of UO, Sulfur compounds are
known to be quite corrosive expecially
to nickel and its alloys and hexa-
valent uranium is a strong oxidant.
Water reacts at elevated temperatures
with UF, and ZrF, to yield UO, (and
Zr0,) and HF. Accordingly, a purifi-
cation technique has been developed
for the preparation of small batches
of fuel for laboratory research
purposes. This technique has been
adapted to equipment capable of the
production of 10- to 100-1b batches
(cf., "Fluoride Production" in sec. 3).

It appeared that a sequence of
operations that would reduce SC, and
uo, ** to lower valence states followed
by high-temperature hydrofluerination
of the liquid would be desirable. The
sulfur, which had been reduced to S~,
would be eliminated as H,S5, and the
oxides and oxyfluorides of uranium and
zirconium formed by hydrolysis would
be reconverted to fluorides.

The apparatus used for this purpose
is shown schematically in Fig. 50.
The heated copper and titanium traps
for removing oxygen from the inert
gas and the cold trap assembly for
removing water from the inert gas and
hydrogen are not shown.

The fuel constituents are mixed as
powders and charged to the vessel.
The air is removed and an HF atmosphere
is introduced by repeated evacuation
and flushing. The melting operation

to minimize the hydrolysis produced
from the small amounts of water
adsorbed on the powders. Hydrogen
1s bubbled through the molten liquid
for 2 hrat 600°C to reduce the uranium
to the quadrivalent state. Hydro-
fluorination of the liquid is carried
out for at least 1 hr at 600°C or
higher to insure conversion of the
oxides. The HF is removed by stripping
with an inert gas at 800°C and the
fuel 1s forced through a sintered-
nickel filter to the receiver. After
the sample has cooled to room tempera-
ture under an inert gas the container
can be detached and sealed without
exposure of the material to an un-
controlled atmosphere.

The apparatus and all associated
lines exposedto HF at high temperature
are made of nickel. lines carrying
HF at low temperatures are made of
copper, and copper 1s also used as
the gasket material. The valves
seats are Monel or Fluorothene. The
major difficulties at present are
those associated with maintaining a
high-temperature system (600 to 800°C)
that will contain HF without leaks.
The receiver must be connected and
disconnected for each run, and the
connections are somewhat vulnerable
to the extreme conditions of exposure.

Approximately twenty 2-kg batches
of fuel have been prepared during the
quarter. The present production rate
is 3 batches per week.

The hydrogenation and hydrofluor-
ination treatment seems to be effective
in removing sulfur compounds. It is
significant that hydrolysis is mini-
mized, and re-hydrofluerination seems
quite successful, since no UO, or
ZrQ, has appeared in or on the nickel
filter.

Liquid Handling Equipment (C. M.
Blood, F. P. Boody, A. J. Weinberger,

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

G. J. Nessle, Materials Chemistry
Division). Purification procedures
have been perfected to the point that
the handling of the fuel materials
after purification can be the major
source of contamination. However,
equipment has been developed to ac-
complish transfer of fuels without
exposure to contaminating atmospheres.

In this equipment, molten fluoride
from a large reservoir is transferred
by inert-gas pressure to a small
container equipped with an overflow
so that a sample of constant size is
caught. This sample is then transferred
to the capsule or other receiver by
pressure of inert gas. There are no
valves in the liquid lines and transfers
from the container to the metering
volume and thence to the receiver are
controlled by valves 1n the inert
gas—vacuum manifold. Except for the
gas and vacuum lines, the whole system
must be maintained at about 600°C
while transfers are 1m progress.
Access to vacuum, HF, and H, manifolds
is provided; the receiving container
can be hydrogenated, hydrofluorinated,
or otherwise treated as required.

Trials to date have shown that the
method is feasible and indicate that
the apparatus can be operated on a
routine basis after a few modifications
to eliminate some of the minor diffi-
culties. Tt is worthy of note that
apparatus of this type should be
quite useful for bringing the reactor
slowly to criticality by injection of
a concentrated solution of UF, in the
alkali fluorides.

SOLUBILITY OF URANIUM IN
SODIUM CYANIDE(®)

Sodium cyanide has been proposed
for use as a fuel carrier because of

its stability at high temperatures

op. cit., ORNL-1170, p. 103

99
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

and its nonoxidizing characteristics,
Accordingly, several tests have been
run 1n an effort to determine the
solubility of uranium in this cyanide.
It was considered necessary to filter
the molten NaCN after a soaking period
at high temperature to eliminate any
particles of uranium that might
possibly be present. For this reason
the test was conductedin the following
manner. Sodium cyanide containing
uranium turnings was sealed into the
lower end of the test container,
which consisted of a piece of 1/2-in.-
OD type-1035 steel tubing with an
iron filter welded in at the center.
After holding for 100 hr at 816°C,
the tube was inverted and held fort
24 hr at 816°C to allow the molten
NaCN to filter through into the other

It 1s believed that the relatively
high percentage of uranium in the
first test might be due to a leak
between the filter that was welded
into the tube and the tube wall. A
small amount of free sodium was found
in the upper part of the tubes at the
conclusion of the tests. Since NaCN
1s hygroscopic, 1t is possible that
much of the uranium may have united
with the water that was present
instead of dissolving in the NaCN.
Therefore it is planned to run similar
tests with dehydrated NaCN to determine
whether the solubility of uranium can
be increased in this manner.

Dynamic corrosion tests in thermal
convection loops have been conducted
with uranium-bearing fluoride mixtures
and nonuranium-bearing fluoride
mixtures in an effort to find a
suitable container for the fluoride
fuels to be used in the aircraft
reactor experiment, Thirty loops have
been run with fluoride as a circulating
medium, The container materials tested
have included the 300- and 400-series
stainless steels, Nimonic, and Inconel.
The stainless steel loops operated
only a short period of time before
plugging, whereas the Inconel loops

100

Savage,

ANP Division

operated for 500 and 1000 hr success-
fully. However, the Inconel suffered
severe corrosion to a depth of 10 to
15 mils with the formation of voids.
The formation of these subsurface
holes at the hot zone was found to be
the result of chromium diffusion to
the molten bath. Lattice vacancies
resulting from such diffusion merely
"precipitate" to form the observed
voids, Static and modified dynamic
tests are being made in a concentrated
effort to ascertain possible inhibitors
for fluoride corrosion, Additions of
potassium, and

sodium, manganese,
calcium metals have been shown to be
guite beneficial in minimizing the
corrosive action of the fluorides on
the container material. Several static
tests on the compatibility of various
fluoride mixtures with beryllium oxide
and other ceramics have been performed.

Other static and modified dynamic
tests were conducted in an effort to
find a possible corrosion and/or
mass-transfer inhibitor for the metal-
hydroxide systems. Preliminary experi-
ments have shown that the corrosion and
mass transfer usually associated with
the metal-hydroxide systems can be
appreciably reduced by the removal of
oxygen from the system with purified
hydrogen. In the study of the reaction
products of container materials and
the hydroxides, a new compound has
been found that is believed to be
NaNiO,. This is the first time that
NaNiO, has been shown to exist. A
similar compound, NaFeO,, has also
been found as a reaction product of
iron with sodium hydroxide, but this
compound has been identified by
previous investigators. Two simplified
methods for studying dynamic corrosion
bave been developed. Preliminary
tests using these methods for studying
the metal-hydroxide mass-transfer
phenomenon have shown that the methods
operate successfully.

In the belief that a better under-
standing of the hydroxide and fluoride
corrosion mechanism will ultimately
lead to the reduction 1f not the
elimination of corrosion, considerable
effort is being devoted to fundamental
corrosion studies. The work includes
not only the synthesis and determi-
nation of corrosion reaction products,
but also such problems as emf measure-
ments of mass-transport phenomena and
determination of the free energy of
postulated reactions,

STATIC CORROSION BY FLUORIDES

D. E. Vreeland R. B. Day
E. E. Hoffman L. D. Dyer
Metallurgy Division

Static corrosion tests, while not
conclusively indicative of the cor-
rosion resistance of a material under
dynamic conditions, are useful for the
preliminary screening of a large number
of specimens, In particular, the
effect on corrosion of various additives
in a fluoride mixture and the effect
of fluoride corrosion of plated metals
have been examined by the static-
capsule technique. Neither the
additives nor the plating was signifi-
cantly beneficial, and when an 1mper-
fection existed in the plating the
resulting attack of the base metal
was quite severe. Measurements of the
static corrosion resistance of Inconel
and stainless steel have shown little
or no correlation with temperature

between 538 and 1000°C.

Effect of Additives. Static cor-
rosion tests of several materials in
fluoride mixture NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
(10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %) with
approximately 10 wt % additions of Zr,
Na, and U and also approximately 5wt %
additions of Li, K, Ca, Li, and Mn
have been run for 100 hr at 816°C.
These additions appeared to have some
effect in inhibiting corrosion in
these tests. Inconel, type-321
stainless steel, and A nickel were the
metals tested. Specimens and tubes
from the tests with Zr and U additions
had developed surface layers. A
nickel tested with the 5% Na additive
also showed some evidence of developing
a surface layer. Inconel developed
surface layers in the Li, Ca, and Ti
addition tests. Type~321 stainless
steel developed surface layers in the
Na and Ca addition tests. In those

Temperature Dependence. Temperature
dependence tests in NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
(10,9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %) have been
completed, Inconel and types-430,
~-304, and -321 stainless steel have
been tested for 100 hr at 538, 704,
and 1000°C, The maximum penetrations
of both containers and specimens are
listed in Table 10. The results of
previous tests of these materials at
816°C are also included for comparison.
It would appear from these results
that in static corrosion tests with
these materials there is little or no
effect on the extent of corrosion that
can be traced to varying the tempera-
ture within the range mentioned above.
Apparently the phenomenon of sensiti-
zation occurring in type-304 stainless
steel and Inconel has little if any
effect on corrosion by these fluoride
mixtures under the testing conditions
employed. The temperature range for
sensitization is usually accepted as

400 to 850°C.

The first three test temperatures
in Table 10 are within the sensitization
range (538, 704, and 816°C). The
final test temperature of 1000°C is
well above the sensitization range, and

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

yet no significant reduction of cor-
rosion can be noted.

Effect of Plating Metals. A speci-
men of type-304 stainless steel that
had been electroplated with approxi-
mately 8 mils of nickel was lightly
cut along one face with a hacksaw in
order to expose the base metal. This
specimen was then tested inNaF-KF-LiF-
UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %) for
100 hr at 816°C under vacuum. The
nickel plating was apparently un-
attacked, although many voids, which
may have occurred during plating, could
be noted, At the sawcut the type-304
stainless steel was more severely
attacked than any other steel corrosion
specimen that had been tested in the
static fluoride mixtures. There was a
layer approximately 12 mils thick of
either corrosion product or unremoved
fluoride, beneath which was a region
of severe intergranular attack 15 mils
deep (Fig. 51).

The results of this test might be
interpreted as giving some indication
that an electrochemical type of attack
had taken place. Tt is well known in
aqueous corrosion, in which it has been

established that electrochemical attack
takes place, that if a metal is coated
with a more noble metal and then the
coating is brecken and exposes a
relatively small area of the anodic
material beneath the cathodic coating,
the small exposed area will suffer from
accelerated corrosion attack. It would
appear that a similar process had
taken place in this test with molten
fluoride.

Effect of Cold Work. Previous
static corrosion tests in NaF-KF-LiF-
UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %) on
Inconel that had been cold worked
approximately 20% prior to testing
showed no increase in corrosion over
as-received material, Tests have now
been completed on Inconel with 52 and
also 74% cold working prior to test,
There appeared to be no increase in
corrosion even after this severe cold
working. In these tests for 100 hr
at 816°C both the specimens and tubes
were attacked to a depth of approxi-
mately 1 mil —~ the tubing was not cold
worked.

ceramic materials
various fluoride mixtures, The main
purpose of this study was to find
container materials suitable for
electrochemical studies. In addition,
the behavior of beryllium oxide in
contact with several fluoride mixtures
was especially investigated because of
the importance of this material as the
moderator for the ARE,

The time of exposure for these
exploratory tests was reduced to 25 hr
from the usual 100 hours. Comparison
of results in NaF-KF-LiF-UF,6 fuel and
in the corresponding nonuranium-bearing
mixture at 800°C showed that the attack
is heavier in the fuel since the UF,
appears to react with the oxides to
form a coating of UO,. In both
mixtures, vitrified beryllium oxide
was found to be the most satisfactory
material; it showed weight gains of
7% in the uranium-bearing mixtures and
1% in the uranium-free mixtures but
no dimensional changes. The materials
tested included zircon, various grades
of aluminum oxide, magnesium oxide,
and sapphire, Also, a number of hot-
pressed refractory carbides were
tested in the uranium-bearing mixture.
Silicon carbide was penetrated, but
the carbides of titanium, tantalum,
and columbium did not show visible
signs of attack, The penetration of
silicon carbide might have been due to
the porosity of the sample.

A special recrystallized aluminum
oxide, Morganite, satisfactorily
resisted attack by the NaF-KF-LiF
mixture but gained over 90% when UF,
was present because of the formation
of a heavy layer of UO, on the surface.
A similar deposit but a much lower
weight gain (18%) occurred when a

NaF-BeF,-UF, fuel was used,

The resistance of vitrified beryllium
oxide to uranium-free ZrF,-bearing
mixtures was followed in a series of
experiments using exposure times up to
500 hours, The weight gains ranged
from 0.3% after 100 hr to over 11%
after 500 hours. X-ray-diffraction
studies showed a layer containing
considerable amounts of ZrO, on the
surface of the specimen, whereas the
zirconium content of the liquid
decreased, It 1s possible that the
ZrO, layer will protect the body of
material from further attack.

Beryllium oxide specimens tested in
a NaF-BeF, mixture at 800°C showed no
apparent attack on the surface; the
specimens increased in weight by 0.7%
after 100 hr, 1.5% after 250 hr, and
8.7% after 500 hours.

STATIC CORROSION BY HYDROXIDES

D. C. Vreeland R. B. Day
E. E. Hoffman L. D. Dyer
Metallurgy Division

Static screening tests have also
been conducted on the effect of various
additives on hydroxide corrosion.
Although there was some indication
that manganese addition had an in-
hibiting effect on corrosive attack,
the corrosion was still quite severe.
The nickel plating of hydroxide cor-
rosion specimens is not yet an entirely
reliable technique of reducing hy-
droxide corrosion, but it is most
effective when the plating layer is
thick, that is, much greater than 4
mils,

Effect of Additives. There was
some indication in several tests that
when Inconel is tested inNaOH additions
of manganese may be beneficial in
inhibiting attack. Inconel, when
tested in regular static corrosion
tests with NaOH, is severely attacked;
the entire thickness of a 35 mil

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

specimen is often affected. In order
to check the possible inhibiting
characteristics of manganese, static
corrosion tests were run with approxi-
mately 4% and also 1 1/2% additions of
manganese powder and a 1 1/2% addition
of electrolytic manganese. The
manganese additions did seem to have
some inhibiting effect on corrosive
attack, with the manganese powder
additions being the most effective;
however, corrosion was still quite
severe even with these additions.

A nickel-zirconium alloy (1/4%
zirconium) was also tested an NaOH,
This alloy has attracted attention
because of its better physical proper-
ties at high temperatures as compared
with pure nickel, The results of the
static corrosion test (110 hr, 816°C,
vacuum) were encouraging, The only
attack that could be noted was 1/2 mil
of light intergranular penetration.

Effect of Plating Metals. A series
of tests in NaOH of some specimens of
Inconel and Inconel X: that were plated
with different thicknesses of nickel
by the International Nickel Company
has been completed. All the specimens
with platings under 4 mils were
severely attacked, but several of the
specimens with thicker platings were
unattacked even though the nickel
plating appeared to have many voids
(Fig. 52). Nickel plating as a means
of protecting materials against attack
by hydroxides does not appear to be
entirely dependable. When protection
is afforded, it is complete and ex-
cellent; but when this protection is

not complete, attack is very severe.
The plated specimens used were vacuum-

diffusion heat treated before testing
for 100 hr at B16°C under vacuum. A
summary of metallographic observations
is presented in Table 11.

DYNAMIC CORROSION BY LIQUID METALS

Two tests on the dynamic corrosion
of liquid metals were performed with
the seesaw corrosion apparatus previ-
ously described, (!? The tests were
made at a 1500°F hot-zone temperature
and a 950°F cold-zone temperature; the
specimens were made of type-310 stain-
less steel. One specimen contained
lead and the other contained lead plus
3% sodium. After 187 hr (50,000 cycles)
the specimens were sectioned for
examination. Metallographic exami-
nation of the specimens showed inter-
granular corrosion at the hot zone and
metal-crystal deposition at the cold

zone (Fig. 53). Both corrosion and
mass transfer were less severe in the
test specimen containing 3% sodium.
A similar test is being made with an
appreciably greater addition of sodium.

Tests (C. R. Croft, N. V. Smith, R.

All studies performed to date have
justified the former conclusion that
when carefully prepared fluoride
preparations are tested in sealed
capsules the corrosion on Inconel and
stainless steel can be tolerated at
temperatures above 1500°F. Recent
experiments have also verified that
when the fuel contains less than about
10 mole % UF, pretreatment of the

stainless steel or Inconel does not
appreciably improve the corrosion
behavior.

Addition of UO, to various fuel
preparations has not resulted in in-
creased corrosion by the mixtures;
addition of hexavalent uranium as U,0,
or as uo, F,, however, results in
considerably increased corrosion. It
still appears likely, therefore, that
oxidation of the fuel components during
preparation 1s more important than
hydrolysis in so far as the corrosion
behavior is concerned.

Addition of sulfate, as Na,sO,, to
various fuel samples has resulted in
large increases in corrosion. The
increase in penetration and weight loss
of the specimens seems to be pro-
portional to the sulfate added. Tt
does not appear likely, however, that
the small quantities of sulfate
present in the commercial fluorides
used can be responsible for the cor-
rosion routinely observed.

The evidence to date justifies the
conclusion that the ZrF,-bearing fuel
mixtures are somewhat less corrosive
to Inconel and stainless steel than
any of the mixtures previously tested.
Static testing has indicated that
negligible corrosion results when
these materials are tested in stainless
steel and Inconel. Studies with the
tilting furnace seem to indicate the
superiority of Inconel to stainless
steel as a container material for the
zirconium-bearing fuels. These experi-
ments are being continued and extended
to recently developed fuel compositions
as rapidly as possible.

Seesaw tests with NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
(10,9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %) fuel have
been made with type-304 and type-304
ELC stainless steel for 190 hr with a
hot-zone temperature of 715°C and a
cold-zone temperature of 575°C. The
tests revealed no difference 1n

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

behavior between these two specimens,
and confirmed the theory that the
carbon content plays an exceedingly
small role, if any, in fluoride cor-
rosion under these conditions. The
hot zone revealed voids to a depth of
4 mils; whereas a film slightly less
than 1 mil thick was observed on the
cold-zone surface. Similar tests with
Inconel have repeatedly shown about
5 mils of voids in the hot zone and a
small amount of crystal deposition at
the cold zone. Various additions are
being made to the fuel in an effort to
minimize or eliminate this attack.
Thus far, three additions, namely,
chromium, magnesium, and sodium, have
met with success in single tests.
These results should be confirmed by
either static or additional dynamic
tests. However, 1t 1s felt that
chromium additions should be expected
to be effective in suppressing void
formation, since it has been demon-
strated that the voids are caused by
chromium depletion.

Corrosion by Fluorides in Thermal
Convection Loops. (G. M. Adamson, K. W.
Reber, Metallurgy Division). The
program of dynamic testing with thermal
convection loops has received greater
emphasis during the past quarter.
Tests with new zirconium fluoride
fuel have produced optimistic results.
Although it appears that the fluoride
fuel NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-
1.1 mole %) will not be used as the
coolant, it is the only possible one
now available in large quantities, so
the preliminary work with it has been
continued, Considerable corrosion has
been measured with all container
materials in which this fluoride was
circulated. The same combination of
fluorides, but without the uranium, is
not nearly so corrosive, and the
addition of small amounts of NaK
reduces corrosion even more. The
attack, at least in Inconel, appears
to be a leaching out of the chromium

in the metal and a gathering of the
voids,

Two Inconel loops and one type-316
stainless steel loop were operated with
NaF-KF-ZrF,-UF, (4.8-50.1-41.3-3.8
mole %) at 1500°F. One Inconel loop
and the type-316 stainless steel loop
(No. 124) were cleaned by passing dry
hydrogen through them at 1950°F,
whereas the other Inconel loop was
degreased. In the degreased loop the
attack was very similar to that found
with the NaF-KF-LiF-UF, fuel but only
about half the number of pits was
present (Fig. 54). The depth of
pitting varied from 3 to 7 mils. In
the hydrogen-cleaned loops the number
reduced further and the
attack was more nearly confined to a
few grain boundaries; however, in a
few cases the attack extended to a
depth of 13 mils (Fig. 54). The 1in-
in depth of attack is thought
to have been caused by the large grain
size produced by the hydrogen firing,
which would not be present with other

cleaning methods. Very thin deposits
were found in the cold legs of both
loops.

The other special coolant tested
was NaF-BeF,-UF, (47.0-51.0-2.0
mole %). This mixture was circulated
in two Inconel loops at 1500°F.
Intergranular pitting that varied from
heavy to moderate was found in the
hot leg. The attack varied in depth
from 6 to 13 mils. Thin deposits
were present in the cold legs of both
loops. Coolant samples from both
loops showed slightly lower uranium
in all sections than
reported for the original batches.

concentration

This may be an indication that some
uranium precipitated from the system.

As mentioned above, since the
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, mixture was the only
fuel available in quantities, most of
the work has been done with 1t. The
data from the loops in which this

110

mixture has been circulated are tabu-
lated in the following tables. The
results from a few of these loops were
listed in the last report, but they
are repeated here for comparison.
Table 12 summarizes the results from
the Inconel loops, Table 13 those from
the 300-series stainless steel loops,
and Table 14 those from the remaining
loops. A study of the data presented
in these tables leads to the following
conclusions:

1. If NaF-KF-1iF-UF, is used as
the circulating media, all stainless
steel loops plug in a relatively short
time. The 400-series steel loops plug
in a shorter time than the 300 series
loops.

2. Inconel loops have not plugged
when any of the fluorides have been
con-

circulated in them; however,

siderable corrosion has been evident.

3. By comparing either Inconel or
stainless steel loops in which NaF-KF-
LiF has been circulated with those in
which NaF-KF-LiF-UF, has been circu-
lated, it is evident that the presently
available UF, accelerates both plugging
and corrosion.

4. When NaF-KF-LiF-UF, is circu-
lated in a loop in which chromium 1s
one of the alloying elements, the
chromium concentration of the mixture
increases and the iron concentration
decreases. Little, change
takes place in the nickel and uranium
concentrations. This 1s discussed
further below.

if any,

5. When NaF-KF-LiF 1s circulated,
no large changes are found in the
concentration of the impurities.

6. A thin metallic layer is de-
posited on the walls of the cold leg.

This deposit is usually thickest in
the top, or hotter, part of the cold
leg.

7. The addition of NaK to NaF-KF-
LiF reduces corrosion in both Inconel
and type-~-316 stainless steel and
suppresses formation of the metallic-
layer deposit.

8. The mechanism of plugging in
the loops has not been determined.
Definite crystal masses were found
during sectioning and melting out of
the fluorides in only three loops
(Nos. 43, 252, 2nd 104; see Tables 13
and 14). In the other loops either
no metallic crystals or only a few
scattered ones were found. The
chemistry group has checked melting
points and viscosities of both hot-
and cold-leg material without finding
changes from the original values,

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

9, The attack is about the same
at 1300°F as it 1s at 1500°F.

As an additional step in the under-
standing of corrosion in Inconel loops,
successive samples were drilled from
the inside of a section of hot-leg
pipe and analyzed. The results are
reported in Table 15. Since the pipe
from which these samples were drilled
was not perfectly round, the figures
in Table 15 should only be used for
discerning trends, The poor sampling
is one reason for the apparent presence
of fluorides at considerable depths.
In spite of the discrepancies it is
obvious that chromium was being removed
from the wall and that iron and nickel
were remaining essentially unchanged.

The chromium was being removed from
depths that appear by metallographic
examination to be unattacked.

As a further study of this attack,
the metallographic section was asked
to determine whether the apparently
unconnected spherical holes observed
actually connected to the surface. The
section was examined and photographed
while successive 1-mil layers were
being removed. By examining the
photographs and trying to follow the
holes, it was determined that they did
not connect to the surface.

Corrosion in Rotating Dynamic Test
Rig (W. C. Tunnell, ANP Division). As
mentioned in the last quarterly re-
port, (!) the rotating dynamic test rig
1s an attempt to determine corrosion
effects more conveniently than in the
thermal convection loops, The apparatus
was calibrated for temperature measure-
ments with lead and appeared to be
accurate within 5°F. The rig was
charged with NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42.0-
46.5 mole %) contained in nickel
liners. The mixture was held below
the melting temperature (550°F) and
under S-micron pressure for several
days to dehydrate the fluoride.
Following this pretreatment the tem-
perature was raised to 1500°F and
held for one day. Raising the temper-
ature did not affect the vacuum, so it
was assumed that the material was dry.
The rigs were then allowed to cool
and the stuffing-box seal assembly was
installed with the Inconel specimens.
The temperature was then raised to

1500°F and the specimens were rotated
for 100 hours.

The Inconel specimens were examined
metal lographically and the fuel mixture
was subjected to chemical analysis,
The fluoride mixture before rotation
showed 1340 ppm of Ni, 35 ppm of Cr,
and 170 ppm of Fe, but after rotation

116

one flvoride sample showed less than
20 ppm of Ni, 160 ppm of Cr, and 75
ppm of Fe and the other sample showed
less than 20 ppm of Ni, 45 ppm of Cr,
and 80 ppm of Fe, Photomicrographs of
the Inconel have not yet been made,
but preliminary examination on the
metallograph does not show an appreci-
able change.

DYNAMIC CORROSION BY HYDROXIDES

Corrosion by Hydroxides in Seesaw
Tests (A, D. Brasunas, L. S. Richardson,
Metallurgy Division). Since oxygen,
as NiO or as 0,, added to NaOH has
resulted in greatly accelerated mass
transfer of nickel in nickel tubes, a
series of oxygen getters have been
added to seesaw tests. These have 1in-
cluded Na, NaH, Be, Mg, Al, and Zr,
None has shown beneficial results with
the possible exception of Zr, which
has given very erratic results. A
summary of the seesaw test results 1s
given in Table 16, The temperatures
listed in Table 16 are not the liquid
temperatures but merely the tempera-
tures measured with a thermocouple
spot welded to the metal tube. Pre-
liminary experiments show that the

temperature gradient 1s probably in
error by 100°C.

The data in Table 16, in con-
junction with previous experimental
work, lead to several general con-
clusions,

1. Mass transfer is accelerated by
the presence of relatively large
quantities of oxygen.

2. Apparently there is a low
temperature limit below which little
or no mass transfer occurs.

3. Additions to the NaOH have
little or no beneficial effect on mass
transfer.

Hydroxide Corrosion in Cold-Finger

Thermal Convection Apparatus. (J. V.
Cathcart, W, H. Bridges, G. P. Smith,
Metallurgy Division). A new type of
thermal convection apparatus, desig-

nated as the cold - finger" apparatus,
has been developed for use in the
corrosion testing of hydroxides. In
principle, the cold-finger apparatus
consists of a small-diameter tube that
is sealed off at one end and inserted
into a pot containing molten hydroxide.
The inside of the small tube is cooled
by a jet of air to create a tempera-
ture differential between the inner
tube, or cold-finger, and the walls of
the hydroxide pot. As a result of the
temperature difference convection
currents are set up in the hydroxide.
This new apparatus has several ad-
vantages over the thermal convection
loops commonly used in corrosion
research: (1) few welds are required
in its construction; (2) it
easily operated and repaired; and (3)
it has a relatively large area of
contact between hydroxide and blanket-
ing atmosphere, It is probable that
the effective rate of flow in a thermal
convection loop 1s greater than that
in the new apparatus, but the rate of
flow in the cold-finger apparatus is
sufficiently large to cause copious
mass transfer under conditions that
were known to produce mass transfer in
a loop.

118

With the apparatus completely
assembled except for the quartz jacket,
the hydroxide pot was filled with c.p.-
grade NaOH pellets, which were then
dehydrated at 500°C under a vacuum of
approximately 0.04 mm Hg for 48 hours.
The temperature was then increased
until the outside of the hydroxide pot
reached the desired temperature. At
the same time the air jet was turned
on and regulated so that the cold
finger remained at a temperature of
approximately 500°C.

In the first of two runs in the
apparatus the hydroxide was blanketed
with a hydrogen atmosphere. The pot
walls and the cold finger were main-
tained at temperatures of 625 and 525°C,
respectively, for a period of 117
hours. Neither loose dendritic
crystals nor mass transfer of any sort
was noted during this run. The second
run was carried out under a vacuum of
about 0.04 mm Hg, and the temperature
was adjusted so that the pot walls and
the cold finger were at 725 and 500°C,
respectively. Heavy mass transfer
occurred between the walls of the
dehydration pot and the cold finger.
Large quantities of dentritic crystals
were observed on the surface of the
cold finger,

It was shown that at least under
the conditions specified for the first
run, a blanketing atmosphere of hy-
drogen effectively stopped mass
transfer in a mickel-sodium hydroxide
system.

Modified Thermal Convection Appa-

ratus - TCA (J. V., Cathcart, W. H.
Bridges, G. P. Smith, Metallurgy
Division). A second, modified, thermal

convection apparatus, representing a
simplification of both the thermal
convection loop and the cold-finger
apparatus, has been constructed and
given preliminary testing. Because of
its simplicity, the modified apparatus
is easy to erect, requires a small
amount of laboratory space, and can

be put into operation in a short
period of time. The apparatus 1is
designated as the TCA, or thermal

convection apparatus, Jt consists of
a 1-ft length of l-in.-dia nickel
tubing with a 1/8-in. plate welded on
the bottom. A Kovar seal is attached
to the top end. A nickel vane about
3 in. long is positioned inside the
tube near the bottom. There 1s suf-
ficient space below the vane to permit
circulation. The nickel tube is
placed between 4-in., split-core,
semicircular heaters and the system is
connected to hydrogen and vacuum lines.
The desired blanketing atmosphere is
then introduced, and one of the semi-
circular heaters is removed to expose
one side of the apparatus to the
atmosphere. The power in the other
heater may be increased until the
wall temperature on the hot side of
the apparatus reaches 800°C, This
procedure results in the formation of
a temperature differential between
opposite sides of the tube and sets 1p
convection currents in the hydroxide.

In the two runs to date with sodium
hydroxide the walls in the hot zone in
the vicinity of the heater were highly
polished whereas those in the cold zone
had a roughened appearance. Massive
deposits of crystals were found only
at the hydroxide-vacuum interface. On
the basis of these results it is felt
that the TCA represents an apparatus,
which, because of its simplicity and
ease of operation, might be well suited
to preliminary corrosion testing in
new systems. It is planned to continue
the development of the equipment,

FUNDAMENTAL CORROSION RESEARCH

In addition to the program of
empirically testing corrosion of
structural metals by fused salts,
considerable effort has been devoted

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

to a number of studies designed ‘to
assist in the discovery of the cor-
rosion mechanism. These studies have
included careful examination by
physical and chemical means of cor-
rosion products formed during large-
scale cyclic corrosion tests, exami-
nation of reactions of structural
metals with high-temperature liquids
in sample systems, and studies of
possible reactions of molten fluorides
and hydroxides under applied po-
tentials, A considerable program of
preparation of complex fluorides of
the structural metals has been con-
ducted to assist in the identification
of corrosion products. Preliminary
results have been obtained by several
independent groups, but the corrosion
phenomena and mechanisms proposed are
not yet entirely consistent.

Interaction of Fluorides and
Structural Metals (H. Powers, J. D.
Redman, IL. G. Overholser, Materials
Chemistry Division). The interaction
of fluorides and structural metals at
high temperatures is being studied in
an attempt to define the mechanism of
attack on containers and to assist 1n
development of measures to control the
corrosion observed.

In general the studies have been
concerned with the NaF-KF-LiF eutectic,
with and without UF,. This fluoride
mixture is heated in contact with
type-316 stainless steel at 800°C for
about 6 hr under an inert atmosphere
and then cooled to room temperature.
After representative samples are taken
for analysis, the remainder is re-
heated under an inert atmosphere, and
samples are removed by application of
vacuum to the filter in which the
porous diaphragm is sintered nickel
or a thin membrane of graphite,

As the data in Table 17 indicate,
the reaction of the NaF-KF-LiF mixture
under these conditions tends to
solubilize some iron but virtually no

chromium or nickel, Although the
iron passing the filters shows con-
siderable variation from test to test,
at least 2000 ppm are solubilized by
this technique, It is significant to
note that the use of nickel filters
(Micro-Metallic Corporation), which
are considerably more porous than the
graphite, does not change the values
for soluble iron and chromium com-
pounds; also, when nickel filters are
used, the nickel content of the
filtrate rises to about 300 ppm. In
general the agreement of results from
the two filters indicates that the
material found in the filtrate is dis-
solved rather than suspended and that
reaction with the filter is probably
not significant in so far as iron
and chromium are concerned.

When UF, 1s a constituent of the
mixture, however, significant changes
are apparent, The iron content of the
filtrates rises considerably (2 to 3
fold) and the chromium obviously
becomes solubilized to a large extent.
The nickel content of the filtrates

120

also rose significantly, except in one
case (as yet unexplained) in which the
soluble nickel remained at a low
level,

These studies have not yet yielded
sufficient concentrations of the
soluble corrosion products for identi-
fication by x-ray diffraction or other
means. However, 1t 1s believed, in
view of data presented below, that the
soluble materials are complex fluorides.
Similar and somewhat more detailed
studies are planned for the more
complex NaF-ZrF,-UF, systems in the
near future,

Synthesis of Complex Fluorides
(B. J. Sturm, L, G. Overholser,
Materials Chemistry Division). Analyses
of the various fluoride fuels after
static or dynamic corrosion testing
have shown that significant amounts of
the container (chiefly iron, nickel,
and chromium from Inconel or stainless
steels) interact with the fused
fluorides. Identification of the
chemical combinations in which these
$3

structural elements occur is an
important part of the study of the
reaction mechanism. It was assumed
that the iron, nickel, and chromium
are present as simple or complex
fluorides in the mixture of alkali
fluorides; consequently, the prepa-

ration of various fluorides containing
iron, nickel, or chromium was under-

taken.

The dehydration of most fluorides
can be accomplished without hydrolysis
only if an atmosphere of HF is main-
tained over the material. Dehydration
of KF, NaF, and LiF by heating under
vacuum or inert gas results in hy-
drolysis of the alkali fluorides; the
production of a free base may easily
be detected by measuring the pH of a
solution of the dehydrated alkali
fluoride. Melting of hydrated nickelous
and chromic fluorides results in
extensive hydrolysis unless the ma-
terials are kept under an atmosphere
of HF while heating. Ammonium bi-
fluoride may be added as an alternate
to provide the protective atmosphere.

Anhydrous nickelous, chromic, and
manganic fluorides have been prepared
from the commercially available
fluorides, Ferrous fluoride has been
prepared by the decomposition of
NH FeF, at 800°C; the ferric fluoride
results from decomposition at a lower
temperature. The NH ,FeF, may be
prepared by reacting anhydrous FeCl,
with NH,HF, at 350°C.

Compounds corresponding to K,CrF,,
Na ;CrFg, and (NH,),CrF, have been
prepared by heating the proper molar
guantities of the corresponding acid
fluorides with chromic fluoride.
Samples of Li ;CrF, were prepared by
heating LiF with (NH,),CrF,. NaK,CrF,
has been prepared by fusing a mixture
of fluorides corresponding to this
composition, Attempts to prepare
Na KCrF, by a similar method yielded
NaK,CrF; contaminated with excess NaF

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 16, 1952

and some unidentified chromium com-
pound. Preparations of complex
fluorides of iron and nickel with the
alkali fluorides are under way.

Examination of Corrosion Products
(D. C. Hoffman, F. F. Blankenship,
Materials Chemistry Division). Loop
tests in which ZrF, -bearing fuel
mixtures have been circulated by
thermal convection have not shown any
restriction to flow in tests up to
500 hr, however, stainless steel loops
in which NaF-KF-LiF-UF, mixtures have
been circulated nearly always plugged
after intervals of about 100 hours.
During the past quarter a concerted
effort has been made to determine the
nature and location of these plugs.

The loop sections to be examined
were selected, in general, to contain
the portion indicated by radiographs
to be the most dense. The apparent
density differences, however, seem to
be a result of contraction and re-~
arrangement of the melt on cooling and
do not necessarily reveal the presence
of a metallic phase. The presence of
large metallic deposits could be
deduced from the radiogram in the few
cases where they have been shown to
exist, but this technique was com-
pletely unreliable for the more finely
dispersed metallic crystals. Exami-
nation of representative sections
throughout the loops demonstrated that
the trap and the vertical cold leg
contained most of the deposited metal
1f there were any.

One section from the hot leg, two
sections from the cold leg, the trap,
and any additional sections showing
radiographic deposits were customarily
examined. Material was removed from
the sections, examined under the
microscope, and separated by means of
a magnet before and after selective
leaching with aluminum nitrate or
ammonium oxalate solutions. The
magnetic fractions and any others that

121
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

could be separated by the selective
leaching procedures were submitted for
examination by chemical microscopy,
x-ray diffraction, and spectrographic
and chemical analyses.

Loops in which NaF-KF-LiF was
circulated in type-316 stainless steel
and loops in which NaF-KF-LiF eutectic
plus 2 mole % UF, was circulated in
types-310, -316, -347, -410, and -430
stainless steel, nickel, Inconel, and
Nimonic were examined, In addition,
one Inconel loop in which NaF-KF-ZrF, -
UF, was circulated has been examined.

Metal "plugs" in quantity sufficient
to stop the flow were observed in
loops of types-410, -430, and possibly,
-310 stainless steel. In all other
cases, regardless of whether the loops
had plugged or not, only scattered
metal crystals, if any, were found,
therefore it does not seem possible
that physical plugging of the tubes
by these small quantities of material
could have occurred.

In the loops of types-316, -347,
-410, and -430 stainless steel the
metallic phase was highly magnetic and
all examinations indicated that the
material was nearly pure iron. The
deposit in the type-310 stainless
steel loop was only weakly magnetic
and showed a high chromium content:
the x-ray-diffraction pattern indi-
cated the presence of a noncubic
crystal in addition to a material that
was presumably a chrome-iron with a
shifted iron lattice. No evidence of
deposits of metallic nickel has been
found in loops of any of these alloys,
although in nickel loops copious
quantities of nickel crystals were
obtained.

Unidentified sulfides often seem to
concentrate in the vicinity of the
metallic crystals, as revealed by the
evolution of H,S during leaching with
acidified aluminum nitrate solution.

122

A green, crystalline substance that
was sparingly soluble in aluminum
nitrate solutions was found associated
with UO, and the metallic crystals in
many of the loops examined. In
addition, layers of the same material
were observed in containers in which
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, fuels were prepared and
stored. Spectrographic analysis of
samples from these sources indicated
the presence of Na, K, and Cr but
virtually no iron. X-ray-diffraction
studies by Agron and microscopic
examination by McVay indicated the
material to be a cubic erystal with
an index of refraction close to 1.422.
By comparison with complex fluorides
prepared by Sturm and Overholser, the
material has been positively identified
as K,NaCrF,. This material, which
appears quite soluble in the molten
fuels at temperatures above 1000°F,
seems to be the major product of
attack on chromium by the fluorides,

Since the chromium in this compound
is trivalent, whereas Cr*? would be
expected from the reaction

Cr® + 2u*3 —— 2u*3 + (Crt?

it appears likely that reduction of
U** does not explain the occurrence of
this compound.

Examination of the Inconel loop,
which circulated NaF-KF-ZrF,-UF, for

1500°F and showed no signs of plugging,
revealed only very slight quantities
of metal deposition in the trap. These
metal crystals, which have not yet
been identified, grew to a length of
about 1/8 in. in a band perhaps 3/16
in, wide. No other metallic deposits
or crystals were observed. No H,S
odor was detectable on leaching the
material from this loop with acidified
aluminum nitrate solution. Since the
fuel mixture used was treated with H,
and HF prior to transfer to the loop,
the sulfur should have been at a low
level prior to the run,

Chromium has been shown by other
groups on the project to be selectively
removed from Inconel and stainless
steel containers by the molten fluo-
rides; however, chromium was rarely
found in metallic deposits from these
experiments. Quantitative analysis
generally revealed the presence of
large amounts (about 3000 ppm) of
chromium in the fluoride melts from
the loop tests; the chromium was
generally uniformly distributed in
both hot and cold legs of the loops in
a manner such as to suggest that it
was dissolved in some fashion.

Chromium removal
studied, but it is suggested that 1t
may be explained by the reaction

1s still being

3UF, + 2Cr,0,—> 3U0, + 4CrF, .

If this is the reaction, then all
active oxygen in the system would
eventually be converted to UO, at the
expense of solubilizatien of the
chromium. The fact that Uo, is a
constant component of material from
corrosion tests, whereas UF, has not
been positively identified, would
seem to lend support to this hypothesis.

It is certain that difficulty from
the reaction

2UF, + Cr ——> 2UF, + CrF,

would be experienced. It seems, how-

ever, that a large portion of the cor-
rosion presently observed may be due
to the other mechanism and that
elimination of oxides and active
oxygen will remove a major portion of
this trouble.

The indexed lines of known com-
plexes, such as K;FeF,, Na,FeF, and
KNiF,, were compared with unknown lines
found in corrosion studies. None of
the latter materials were identified.
However, synthesis of the two new
compounds K,CrF, and K,NaCrF, (prepared
by B. J. Sturm, Materials Chemistry

commonly found in corrosion tests with
the NaF-KF-LiF-UF, mixture. Table 18

approach to the problem involves the
decomposition-potential measurement of
various fluorides (pure and in

its use as a vessel for potentiometric
and electrolytic experiments. Because
of difficulties in obtaining repro-
ducible results from the concentration
cells previously described, efforts
have been made to use the measurements
of decomposition potentials as an
approach to the evaluation ofelectrode
potentials; however, attention is
still being given to the relationship
of temperature to potential. Pre-
liminary measurements indicate that a
nickel electrode placed in a hot
region of NaOH melt becomes negative
with respect to one in acooler region.
This is consistent with present ideas
of the processes occurring during mass
transport, :

Voltage-current curves have been
obtained for the electrolysis of fused
NaOH with and without added NiO by
using nickel electrodes. For the
sizes and spacings of electrodes used,
currents ranged up to 2 ampat voltages
of up to 2 volts. With only NaOH,
extrapolation of the linear part of
the curve gave an apparent decompo-
sition potential between 1.2 and 1.4
volts, whereas in the melts containing
added NiO, an additional electrode
process having an apparent decompo-~
sition potential of 0.7 to 0.8 volt
was indicated. The melts containing
NiO gave a large deposit of metallic
nickel at the cathode but little or no
attack on the anode. Further experi-
ments will be necessary to obtain more
quantitative information about these
processes.

Various phenomena observed during
the electrochemical experiments de-
scribed have led to experiments con-
cerned with reactions occurring in
fused NaOH in the absence of applied
electric fields. In each case in
which NaOH and NiO were in contact at
temperatures of 700°C or higher, a
fine, crystalline deposit of metallic
nickel was observed when the melt was
cooled and leached with water. This

has been observed whether the container
used was nickel, recrystallized
alumina, or corrundum, The nickel may
be presumed to be formed by the same
process as that taking place as the
second step of the mass transport
phenomenon. :

When NiO and NaOH are held at 700°C
in a nickel vessel for several
and then slowly cooled, the solidified
melt is found to contain wiry, black
needles or fibers. These fibers are
from 0.001 to 0.003 in. in diameter
and up to 1/4 in, in length. Their
chemical analysis, 44% nickel and 29%
sodium, does not correspond well with
any simple formula. X-ray-diffraction
studies of this material indicate that
it 1s crystalline but not identical
with any. compound for which data are
available. When this material is
allowed to stand in water, it slowly
changes from black to dark green in
color without changing noticeably in
crystalline form. These washed needles
contain no sodium and have a nickel
content corresponding fairly closely
to the formula Ni (OH), 2H,0. X-ray

making these studies, compounds have

grade NaOH was heated in a nickel tube
at 700°C and oxygen was bubbled through
the melt for 48 hours. The tube of

the top portions of the melt were

When the hydroxide had dissolved,
black crystals were obtained. These
crystals were washed with absolute
ethanol until the washings failed to
turn a phenolphthalein solution red.
The product was vacuum dried over
Drierite and then washed with water.
The compound obtained by washing with

fraction as Ni,0,*H,0, which is a

Mechanism of Fluoride Corrosion
(G. M. Adamson, A. D. Brasunas, IL. S.
Richardson, Metallurgy Division). As
mentioned in the last report, (3)
magnetic changes were noted in stain-
less steels after exposure to fluo-
rides, Similar changes have also been
noted in the hot legs of the Inconel
loops. As an additional check on the

corrosion mechanism, a microscopic,
method for determining the
of these transformed layers
has been developed, Figure 55 shows
that the transformation in an Inconel
loop follows a fairly straight-line
interface and extends to a depth of
approximately two-thirds the depth of
the holes. This change of Inconel to
a magnetic material may be explained
by the removal of chromium, which
leaves an iron-nickel alloy. The fact
that complete removal of chromium 1s

presence

not necessary for this transformation,
explains the observation that the area
of apparent attack extends deeper than
the transformed layer.

A study of these facts leads to the
conclusion that the corrosion mechanism
of fluorides in Inconel is a leaching
of chromium from the surface of the
Inconel followed by diffusion of new
chromium from the interior of the pipe
to the surface from which it in turn
is also leached. As the chromium
diffuses to the surface, very small
voids are left behind. These voids
seem to concentrate in grain boundaries
and at similar areas of weakness faster
than nickel or iron can diffuse inward
to fill them.

A number of other experiments have
been made that strongly indicate that
true voids caused simply by
depletion of the surface
regions. It has already been es-
tablished that the chromium content of
fluoride 1s high after corrosion test-
ing. Such preferential solution would
necessarily result in reduced chromium
at the surface of the metal, In one
test, metal crystals precipitated from
the fluoride contained 4.9% Cr.(%)

Calculations of void volume based
on such chromium depletion are in good
agreement with the density of voids

may be expected.

It would be reasonable to expect
the formation of voids if chromium
depletion were accomplished by other
means, Therefore two tests were made.
(1) Inconel was oxidized at 1200°C for
200 hours. Chromium was selectively
oxidized and left a chromium-depleted
area. (2) Inconel and an 80% Ni1-20%
Cr alloy were heated to 1375°C for 42
hours. The vapor pressure of chromium
was appreciably greater than that of
iron or nickel. The voids formed in
both cases appeared to be identical
with those formed in fluoride media.

As a further verification of the
theory that holes are caused merely by
chromium depletion, a test was made
using NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-
1.1 mole %) in Inconel at 850°C for
100 hours. (This test has always
resulted in hole formation.) Abont
10% of -300 mesh chromium powder was
added to saturate the fluoride with
chromium, and, as expected, no voids
were formed.

These data and observations are in
complete agreement with the theory that
the holes observed in fluoride-attacked
alloys are true voids caused by selective
solution of an alloy component. The
mechanisms discussed above apply to
Inconel, but further work is necessary
to determine whether they also hold
for fluoride corrosion of stainless
steels,

of potassium metal at lower tempera-

smaller, perhaps by a factor of 10 at

It appears as a result of thermo-
dynamic considerations that even small
concentrations of potassium metal added
and dissolved in the fluoride melt, of
the order of 0.1%, can be expected to
have a considerable beneficial effect
on corrosion.

Fluoride Corrosion Phenomena (M. A.
Bredig, J. W, Johnson, H. F. Bronstein,
Chemistry Division), The observation
that alkali metals dissolve in appreci-~
able quantities in the melts of their
halides is of significance in several
respects. In the absence of other
corrosive agents such as oxides, cor-
rosive mass transfer under "dynamic"
conditions and the absence for practical
purposes of corrosion under "static"
conditions may be explained. The
equilibrium in corrosion reactions of
the type Fe + 2KFo=——= FeF, + 2K may
be favorably influenced by the addition
of alkali metal to the fluoride
mixture.

brium constants for reactions of this
type, based on the most recent data

cate concentrations of CrF_, FeF,, or

of 10 than at 1500°F. Thus the con-
stituents of the structural metal
dissolved as fluorides at 1500°F can
crystallize out as metallic elements
at 1200°F as a result of almost com-
plete reversal of the reaction occurring
at 1500°F. Assuming rapid establish-
ment of equilibrium for 2000 g of
molten NaF-KF-LiF (11.5~42.0-46.5
mole %) in both legs of the thermal
loops and a flow rate of 1 cycle per
minute, a quantity of 6000 x 2000 x
10°38 or approximately 15 g of metallic
iron would deposit in the cold leg for
6000 cycles in 100 hours, For chromium
and nickel, these guantities are
approximately 100 and 6g, respectively.
These are very crude estimates that
are probably correct to only within a
a factor of 10 except for the relations
between Fe, Cr, and Ni, which appear
qualitatively of the right order. . The
effect of the formation of complexes
such as K,CrF,, for which thermodynamic
data are not available at present,
remains to be considered in more
accurate calculations.

It is clear that the establishment
of equilibrium in a static test, that
is, without thermal gradients, would
not, with a mole fraction of the order
of 107% to 107° of CrF,, FeF,, or
NiF,, produce any considerable cor-
rosion., In fuel mixtures containing
UF; the free energy of reactions of
UF,, such as Fe + 2UF,z=—> 2UF, +
FeF, (AF oa ~6 kg/cal), is much less
positive than for the reactions dis-
cussed thus far for KF (AF = ~890
kg/cal). The comparatively small
increase in corrosion and mass transfer
observed with NaF-KF-LiF-UF, compared
with NaF-KF-LiF, in spite of the large
disparity of the free-energy changes
of the reactions, is explained by ‘the
much lower concentration of the UF,.

It has been possible to rather
dramatically demonstrate the oc-

currence, under suitable conditions,
of the reaction Fe + 2KF =====FeF, + 2K.

ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

A mixture of iron powder and potassium
fluoride was heated for several hours
at 920°C in an evacuated stainless
steel tube that had an air-cooled
section and a water-cooled section,
After the test it was found that most
of the potassium fluoride had evaporated
and redeposited at the air-cooled
portion. A very small quantity of
black particles were found that were
insoluble on dissolution of the fluo-
ride in water. The particles, which
were metallic iron, were probably
produced by the partial back reaction

FeF, ¢, + 2K gy === Fe + 2KF oy.

At the water-cooled part, approximately
1 g of potassium metal was collected,
which was the portion that could not
react backwards with FeF, because
of rapid precipitation of the latter
at the air-cooled part of the walls,

It 1s impossible to state at
present with certainty that the cor-
rosive mass transfer observed in
thermal loops must be entirely or
partly due to fluoride reactions of
this sort rather than to oxide reactions
as long as the possibility of the
presence of oxide in some form cannot
be ruled out. Equilibria of the type

Fe + Fe 0,<=== 4Fe0
or

Fe + U0, F, w====FeF, + uo,

obviously may also produce corrosive
mass transfer of metal. It seems that
recent observations on the decrease or
absence of corrosive mass transfer in
fuel mixtures containing ZrF, instead
of LiF or BeF, have been attributable
to improved purification and decreased
oxygen content. Although the removal
of oxygen appears to be a necessary
condition for a low corrosion rate,

130

the possibility of a fluoride reaction
cannot be neglected. Sufficiently
accurate thermodynamic data for ZrF,
are not available. The heat of for-
mation of ZrF,, AF = 445 + 30 kg/cal,
is 10 times that of KF, and the
equilibrium concentration of FeF, at
1100°X, which is from 1075 to 1079,
is one-thousandth that of KF. T1f the
figure 107% were correct, it would be
necessary to find an explanation for
the low rate of corrosive mass trans-
fer actually observed. Observations
on the peculiar behavior (the apparent
self-welding) of nickel in fluoride
melts containing ZrF,, which might
perhaps be connected with some alloying
of nickel with zirconium produced by
the reaction ZrF, + 2Ni === 2NiF, +
Zr, may indicate a possible way of
reconciling the large figure of 107°
for the concentration of Fel, (1f at
is correct) with the low corrosion
rate observed in the thermal loop.
Zirconium from the above reaction
might be thought to plate out on, or
form an alloy with, the steel or the
Inconel, This could reduce the cor-
rosion rate by at least two independent
mechanisms: (1) formation of a pro-
tective surface film containing zir-
conium and (2) absence of transport of
zirconium to the cold leg for reversal
of the equilibrium there, which
reversal alone would make new attack
by KF in the hot leg possible.

It is obvious that much more work
is required to completely elucidate
the mechanism of corrosive mass trans-
fer. However, the possible occurrence
of zirconium plating or alloying may
lead to the development of methods
other than the use of fluorine-deficient
melts that may permit general control
of corrosion and mass transfer in
fluoride melts.

Loose powder sintering has been

of solid fuel elements, This technique
involves sintering a loose powder of
the uranium-bearing mixture to a solid

have included sintering temperature,
sintering time, fuel-component particle
size, cold working and resintering,
surface preparation, and sintering
under load. Powder mixtures of boron
carbide and 20% iron by volume have
been hot pressed to make slugs for the
safety rod of the ARE. Hot-pressed
mixtures of aluminum oxide and boron
carbide are being studied for use in
the regulating rod of the ARE.

In the development of fuel elements
utilizing a solid fuel, a variety of
possible configurations has been
suggested for incorporating the fuel
with a structural material. One method
of fabrication would be to bond a
fuel-bearing powder to an appropriate
backing material by sintering the
powder either with or without appli-
cation of pressure. Preliminary
experiments to prepare flat sheets
covered on one side with a sintered
fuel-bearing powder were carried out
in a furnace at the Micro-Metallic
Corporation in New York. This work
has been reported elsewhere.(!*?%)

A furnace with a suitable reducing
atmosphere has been made available at
ORNL and used for further work on this
problem. Several variables of the
bonding technique, including sintering
temperature, sintering time, fuel-
component particle size, surface
preparation, and sintering under load,
have been investigated. Samples
processed to include these variables
were also cold worked and resintered,
and they were examined metallographi-
cally for evaluation of results. Only
the sintering temperature and the
fuel-component particle size had
appreciable effect on the bond. Both
the higher temperatures and larger
particle sizes tested were shown to
be beneficial.

loading of the samples. These were
carried out in a larger, molybdenum-
wound furnace equipped with an Inconel
tube. The furnace atmosphere in every
instance was hydrogen that had been
passed over a platinum catalyst and
through an activated-alumina drying
column, The type-316 stainless steel
stock was annealed in the hydrogen
atmosphere prior to coating with the
powder mixture.

Sintering Temperature. The trend
was toward improved strength of bond
between the backing sheet and powder
with increasing sintering tempera-
tures, After sintering at 1300°C and
lower, bonding of the 30% by volume
(-200, 1325 mesh) UO0,-70% (-325 mesh)
type-302 stainless steel mixture used
was very poor, whereas the samples
sintered at 1360°C or higher showed
considerable tenacity even on bending.

The four samples shown in Fig. 56
were sintered at 1300, 1325, 1360,
and 1385°C, respectively. The powder
mixture was placed on the backing and
leveled to approximately 0.030 in, in
thickness. Betention of the powder
became successively poorer as the
sintering temperature was lowered. In
an effort to consolidate the powder
layer, the composites were rolled to
a 40% reduction in area and heated to
1250°C for 30 minutes. These samples
are also illustrated in Fig. 56,

Sintering at high temperatures
caused transformation of some of the
austenite to delta ferrite, which
appeared as needle-like crystals in

132

the type-302 stainless steel matrix
and as a band about individual grains
of the type-316 stainless steel.
The latter distribution of the ferrite
might be expected to lead to a pref-
ferential grain boundary attack if the
backing were subsequently exposed to
one of the coolants of current interest.
The presence of the magnetic phase in
the type-316 stainless steel was made
evident by placing adrop of an aqueous
suspension of a colloidal iron com-
pound on the surface of the metallo-
graphic specimens and then exposing
the samples to a magnetic field.

Sintering Time. The sintering-time
study indicated there was no appreci-
able increase in the quality of the
bond obtained with samples heated for
times up to 2 hr over that for a sample
held at temperature for 30 minutes.
Duplicate samples from this group were
also given a 40% cold reduction and
reheated to 1250°C for 30 minutes. In
every case the rolled and sintered
samples showed well-consolidated
structures with relatively small
amounts of porosity. The UO, retention
in several instances was poor and the
UO, could be removed by polishing.
The poor retention is thought to be
caused by partial crushing of the
oxide particles during rolling.

Fuel-Component Particle Size. The
quality of bond between the metallic
particles in the powder layer and
backing sheet showed general improve-
ment as the particle size of the UO,
was increased. Particle sizes ranging
from -100, +140 mesh to -325 mesh were
used, The better continuity of
metallic particles with the larger
sizes is shown in Fig. 57. Both the
material sintered at 1300°C for 45 min
and its the rolled and resintered
counterpart are illustrated in the
figure. Cold rolling followed by
reheating at 1250°C resulted in
considerable compacting, as shown in
Fig. 57.

Surface Preparation. Contrary to
the results obtained with samples
sintered at the Micro-Metallic Corpo-
ration plant, surface preparation of
the type-316 stainless steel sheet
had little effect on the degree of
bonding to the powder layer. Some
small benefit may have been obtained
in roughening by sand blasting or by
using annealed as-received stock as
opposed to electropolished sheet.

Sintering Under Load. Samples were
loaded during sintering with steel
weights to obtain unit pressures of
1/2 to 5 psi, Cross sections of these
samples indicated that no gross
improvements were effected by the
maximum loading used.

CONTROL ROD FABRICATION

Several important decisions have
been reached concerning materials to
be used in these rods, and fabrication
of the components has begun. After
considering the availability of stock
for the cans and the time schedule,
it was decided to make the cans from
the types-316 and -304 stainless steel
tubing on hand. These steels are
admittedly not the best materials for
compatibility with boron carbide and
perhaps not the best from the self-
welding viewpoint; however, the delay
necessary to obtain the more desirable
type-430 stainless steel tubing is
prohibitive. The cans are being
fabricated by the Y-12 Shops, and they
will be loaded with slugs and brazed
with Colomonoy Nicrobraz by the Welding
Group. :

Safety Rod Slugs. The safety rod
slugs are being fabricated by hot
pressing an iron-boron carbide mixture
containing 56% by weight (80% by
volume) boron carbide. The mixture
was selected as an alternate to pure
boron carbide because the latter offers
special fabrication problems and is

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

considerably more expensive. The
slugs are prepared from boron carhide
that has been milled 16 hr in a steel
mill with steel balls and blended 8 hr
with the requisite amount of -325 mesh
iron powder. The mixture 1s then
fabricated by hot pressing at 1520°C
and 2500 psi. Enough slugs to prepare
one safety rod have been pressed with
little difficulty. Cracking of the
samples because of the difference in
thermal expansion of the iron-boron
carbide compact and the graphite
mandrel ‘was overcome by ejecting the
mandrel at temperature. The pressed
parts have densities of 2.80 g/cc
(about 80% of theoretical) and will
be brought within acceptable dimen~
sional tolerances by grinding.

Four slugs less than full size have
been pressed, canned, and brazed: two
in type-304 and two in type-316 stain-
less steel. One can of each material
was sectioned and examined after the
brazing cycle. There appeared to be
no appreciable interaction between the
cermet insert and the container. The
other two samples were held for 100 hr
at 815°C before opening for exami-~
nation. In each of these a thin layer
of a white, crystalline compound that
was slightly soluble in hot water was
found on the inside surface of the
container. The white, crystalline
compound was present in greater cone
centration at points wet by the
Nicrobraz. Efforts are being made to
establish the identity of the compound
by x-ray-diffraction techniques.

Regulating Rod Slugs. The require-
ments for the regulating (shim) rod
are somewhat different. For this
purpose a small amount of boron (3 to
12.5 g) must be uniformly dispersed
in a material relatively transparent
to neutrons, such as Al,0;. A l-in.
by 1/2-in.-dia slug was made by hot
pressing a mixture composed of 99%
grade 38-500 Al,0, plus 0.17% B,C au
at 1750°C in a graphite die under a
ANP PROJECT QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

pressure of 2500 psi. Metallographic
examination revealed that the two
materials are compatible. A second
slug containing 0,74% by weight of
-325 mesh B,C, prepared by the same
technique, had a density of 3.45 g/cc
(86% of theoretical) and possessed
satisfactory physical properties. The
composition of this compact corresponds
closely to that of material to be used
in the "high-B,C content" regulating
rad.

MECHANICAL TESTING OF MATERIALS

R. B. Oliver C. W. Weaver
D. A. Douglas J. W. Woods
Metallurgy Division

The installation of facilities for
stress-rupture testing in liquid
metals and fused salts is complete.
The testing machines were calibrated
with a standard-sheet test specimen
on which SR-4 strain gages had been
mounted, and this specimen in turn was
calibrated agalnst a standard proving
ring. The testing chambers were
originally designed to contain sodium
or other low-melting-point materials.
With the change in the program and the
need for data from tests using the
higher melting fused fluorides, a few
minor design changes had to be made.
Containers to charge and empty the
testing chambers have been designed
and are being constructed of Inconel.
These containers are designed to also
fit the apparatus used to produce the
fluoride mixtures. Testing will be
started shortly after the first lot
of fluoride mixture 1s received.

The primary purpose of these tests
will be to study the effect of stress-
corrosion on the creep rate and stress-
rupture life of these materials. Both
Inconel and type-316 stainless steel
are being tested in the new machines
in an argon atmosphere in the same
stress ranges as they were previously

136

tested in the old machines. A com-
parison of these two sets of data will
establish the effects of the inherent
variables of the new testing systems,
and thus the results of the corrosive

action can be studied.

Stress-Rupture Tests in Argon. Both
fine- and coarse-grained Inconel
specimens are being tested at stresses
from 1500 to 4500 psi in argon at
815°C. The expected test duration in
this stress range is from 800 to
3000 hours. Upon completion of these
tests, revised design curves will be
compiled. A short series of tests at
815°C in air are being initiated to
obtain data for a comparison of the
effects of oxidation and fluoride
attack on the creep rate and rupture
life.

Type-316 stainless steel specimens
are being tested in argon in both the
old and the modified test chambers at
5300, 5800, 6300, 6800, and 7300 psi.
These duplicate sets of data will
serve to correlate the work in the
two types of testing chambers and
will furnish data for a design curve
for type-316 stainless steel tested
in argon.

Stress-Corrosion Tests (G. M.
Adamson, K. W., Reber, Metallurgy
Division). Preliminary experiments
to determine the effect of fluoride
corrosion on the physical properties
of structural metals have continued
in the crude apparatus currently
available pending the installation of
more sensitive equipment. Both stress-
rupture and tube-burst tests were
carried out during this period.

The tube-burst tests have been
described in previous reports; however,
it should be noted that these tests
are designed to yield hoop stress-
rupture data, Table 21 is a summary
of the data obtained by immersing the
specimen under the desired stress in
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1
mole %) at 1500°F.

The stress-rupture apparatus trans-
mits a dead-load stress to the specimen
by means of a lever arm and a bellows
arrangement. A thin flat specimen is
subjected to a tensile stress while
immersed in a bath at the desired
temperature. For all these tests a
bath of NaF-KF-LiF-UF, held at 1500°F
was used. The data obtained are
tabulated in Table 22. The third

TABLE

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

column in this table presents data
obtained in argon atmospheres.

It 1s readily apparent that a
contradiction is present in these
data, At high stresses the two sets
of data check, whereas at stresses
below 10,000 psi there is no corre-
lation, In such testing, as the
stresses are lowered the relative
effects of errors become larger. It
is apparent that the corrosion-stress-
rupture apparatus is not sufficiently
sensitive at the very low stresses.

CONE-ARC WELDING

P., Patriarca G. M. Slaughter
Metallurgy Division

It was found desirable to determine
the applicability of cone-arc welding
techniques to fabrication of tube-to-
header joints in heat exchangers.
This study was given precedence over
the long-range approach of determining
the individual and combined effects
of the various cone-~arc welding
process variables. However, the
variables, such as arc time, arc
current, and electrode gap distance,
have been extensively tested on
materials and geometries applicable
to heat exchanger designs, One heat
exchanger was fabricated, and the
fabrication of test assemblies by
cone-arc welding will continue.
However, studies to evaluate the
fundamental effects of the cone-arc
welding variables will receive con-
current attention in future work.
Equipment used for cone-arc welding
experiments was described previ-
ously, (3?

Effect of Welding Conditions. A
series of headers were fabricated
to conform to a close-packed tube and
hole arrangement in a circular header.
The header material used was type-304
stainless steel sheet 1/8 in. thick.

receive type-316 stainless steel
tubing, 0,100 in. OD with 0.010-in.
wall thickness. The basic pattern
was an equilateral triangle with a
tube hole at each apex. Each tube
was 0,100 in., or one diameter, from
its nearest neighbor. Tube-hole to
header-edge distances were initially
chosen as 0,050 in. but were increased
in subsequent experiments to 0.100

inch. Suitable welding conditions
were chosen individually by experiment
be fore being applied to a 19-hole
header assembly for a consistency
evaluation,

Figure 58 illustrates a series of
typical tube-to-header consistency
determinations. Each header was
fabricated by using adifferent welding
condition, as set forth in Table 23,
to illustrate the flexibility of the
cone-arc process.

Cone-arc welds within the limits of
the material and joint design of this
investigation may be made over a range
of welding conditions. Although the
welds illustrated by Fig. 58 and
Table 23 are not representative of a
systematic study, their examination
reveals trends to be verified by future
work. It appears from comparison of
these welds that the primary effect of
shortening the arc distance is to
recess the cone-arc weld. Although

parable net effect of increasing

current with a corresponding decrease
in arc time, it 1s not believed possible
to determine these effects on variables
such as weld penetration without
thorough metallographic examination.
Welds d and e illustrate the combined
effects of further increasing arc
length, arc current, and arc time ~ a
condition is reached that indicates
superfluous welding. This is apparent
by observing the relatively large welds
and the tendency to form a rosette
pattern on the header edges. The heat
flow pattern, the uniformity of which
seems to be an important variable in
cone-arc welding, appears to have been
distorted on prolonged heating. It may
be noted that the outer holes of headers
e and f do not contain welded tubing.
The tube-periphery to header-edge
distance in this case was 0.050 inch,
This distance was found to upset the
uniformity of the heat flow pattern and
welding conditions were not found which
would give satisfactory welds.

There 1s a tendency for an are that
is terminated instantaneously without
a current taper to leave a crater,
Examination of the periphery of cone-
arc welds reveals a small spot that is
characterized by a small amount of

scale. The extent of these craters
indicates that porosity due to cratering
1s not a serious problem. However,
the presence of a single pronounced
crater on the cone-arc weld periphery
tends to confirm the belief that the
cone-arc may be a single, rotating-arc
beam.

TESTS OF BRAZING ALLOYS

G. M. Slaughter
Metallurgy Division

P. Patriarca

The primary objective of the high-
temperature brazing alloy investigation
during the past few months has been to
screen brazing alloys for aircraft
reactor applications by using flow-
ability and static corrosion tests in
sodium hydroxide and NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
fuel mixture. After these pre-
liminary investigations, premising
alloys can be further studied in
physical property tests such as butt-
tensile tests (at both room and elevated
temperatures), elevated-temperature
creep tests, dynamic corrosion tests,
and room- and elevated-temperature
ductility tests. Such screening
procedures seem appropriate 1n view
of the large number of alloys now
under consideration,

In Table 24 the results of pre-
liminary investigations of eight high-
temperature brazing alloys are re-
corded. Static corrosion tests on

140

joints brazed with some of these alloys
are being made, and the results will
be reported later. The melting points
of the various alloys are only approxi-
mate and will vary somewhat since
chemical analyses of various heats of
the same alloy differ slightly,
Although most of the brazing alloys
tested flowed satisfactorily, none
exhibited satisfactory corrosion
resistance in sodium hydroxide.
Nicrobraz, 60% Pd-40% Ni (with and
without a 3% Si addition), and 64% Ag-
33% Pd-3%Mn were the only alloys not
severely attacked by the fluoride fuel
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.,5-44.5-1.1
mo le %).

At the present time, static tests
on 4 nickel joints brazed with promising
alloys are being conducted. [It 1s
hoped that better resistance of the
brazing alloys to corrosion by sodium
hydroxide can be obtained, since
nickel 1s attacked only slightly by
NaOH ~ this may not hold true with
the introduction of a bimetallic
system.

Nicrobraz, Static corrosion tests
of Nicrobrazed joints on Inconel and
type-316 stainless steel in both
NaF-KF-LiF-UF, fuel mixture and NaOH
for 100 hr at 1500°F have been com-
pleted. Photomicrographs of corrosion-
tested, Nicrobrazed, Inconel joints
were presented in aprevious report, (4)
Nicrobrazed specimens of type-316
stainless steel tested in both the
fluoride mixture, NaF-KF-LiF-UF,, and
NaOH are shown in Fig. 60. The
fluoride bath had a relatively minor
corrosive effect onthis joint, whereas
the sodium hydroxide was much more
severely corrosive.

Manganese-Nickel Alloy. The 60% Mn-
40% Ni alloy was found to be extremely
brittle and many brazed joints made
with it were subject to severe cracking,
This brazing alloy was found to have

low resistance to corrosion in the
media in which 1t was tested; it was
severely attacked by the fluoride
mixture, NaF-KF-LiF-UF,, and NaOH (as
shown in the previous quarterly
report(3))., The poor corrosion re-
sistance coupled with relatively poor
flow properties seem to make this
alloy unsuitable for circulating- fuel
reactor applications.

Palladium-Nickel Alloy. The 60% Pd-
40% N1 brazing alloy has excellent
flowability properties, and the rather
limited experimental data obtained to
date indicate that it has better than
average resistance to corrosion by the
fluorides. The insignificant attack
of the fluoride mixture, NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
on an Inconel joint brazed with this
alloy is shown in Fig. 61. It can be
seen that intimate bonding with the
base metal is obtained during brazing,
since the grain boundaries of the

as the parent Inconel grains.

The 60% Pd-40% Ni alloy, with 3%
silicon added for its effect upon
melting-point lowering, was also. in-
vestigated. The silicon addition
caused phenomenal flow that traversed
the entire length of a 6-in. joint and
even flowed up the scratches. However,
the room-temperature tensile strength
of type-316 stainless steel joints
butt-brazed with the alloy was low,
and the brazed joint was very brittle.
In addition, the resistance to corrosion
in the fluorides of brazed Inconel
joints seems to have been lowered
somewhat by the addition of the silicon
to the 60% Pd-40% Ni alloy.

Further attempts to lower the
melting point of the 60% Pd-40% Ni
alloy by the addition of a third
component are being made. A 1% beryl-
lium addition and a 10% manganese

addition are being studied, but more
work has to be done before the desir-
ability of such additions can be
determined.

Ni~-Cr-Si-Mn Alloys. Two brazing
alloys of the Ni-Cr-Si-Mn type have
been investigated in preliminary
experiments. The 16.5% Cr~10.0%
S1-73.5% Ni and the 16.5% Cr~10.0%
S51~2,5% Mn-71.0% Ni alloys have
desirable flowability characteristics,
but they are apparently attacked to
some extent by the fluorides and rather
severely by sodium hydroxide. Static
corrosion tests for 100 hr at 1500°F
on Inconel joints brazed with the
alloy containing a small amount of
manganese have been completed. Typical
sections of joints show moderate
attack in the fluoride, NaF-KF-LiF-UF,,
and rather severe attack in sodium
hydroxide,

Silver-Base Alloys. Two silver-base
brazing alloys of the compositions
64% Ag~33% Pd-3% Mn and 75% Ag-20% Pd-
5% Mn, which melt at approximately
2100°F, have also been investigated.
The flowability of these alloys is
very good, but the static corrosion
results look promising in only a few
instances. Inconel and type-316 stain-
less steel joints brazed with the
64% Ag~-33% Pd-3% Mn alloy were static
corrosion tested for 100 hr at 1500°F
in both NaF-KF-~LiF-UF, and NaOH. The
fluorides were relatively noncorrosive
(Fig. 62), particularly on the stain-
less steel, whereas the sodium hy-
droxide was severely corrosive.

Inconel joints brazed with the
75% Ag-20% Pd-5% Mn alloy have been
tested in NaF-KF-LiF-UF, and NaOH for
100 hr at 1500°F. The resistance to
corrosion of both joints in these
media was poor, as evidenced by severe
attack, particularly in sodium hy-
droxide.

National Bureau of Standards ceramic
coating A-418 has been successfully
applied to samples of stainless steel,
and i1t showed good resistance to
oxidation at 900°C in a 100-hr test.
Work is in progress to apply a ceramic
coating to nickel and to develop a

ceramic coatings on the thermal effi-
ciency of a radiator is under con-
sideration. Moderator blocks for use
in the ARE have been fabricated from
beryllium oxide at the U, S. Bureau of

The viscosities of NaF-KF-LiF-UF,
(10.9-43.5-44.5-1.1 mole %) and two
BeF,-bearing fluorides have been
determined with a rotational vis-
cometer. The viscosities of NaF-KF-
LiF-UF, range from about 9 centipoises
at 530°C to about 3 centipoises at
750°C. The viscosities of both BeF,-
bearing fluoride mixtures were so
high, greater than 12 centipoises
at 725°C and greater than 25 centi-
poises at 600°C, that Bel, was eliminated
from»further consideration as a
potential fuel constituent for the
ARE. Preliminary viscosity measure-
ments of the NaF-KF-ZrF, -UF, fuel
mixture (5-51-42-2 mole %) have been
obtained with the efflux viscometer.
The viscosities, which were from about
10 centipoises at 570°C to about 4
centipoises at 750°C, appear satis-
factory for the ARE.

Thermal conductivity measurements
on NaF-KF-LiF (eutectic) have in-
dicated a mean value of about 2.6
Btu/hr- ft? (°F/ft) over the tempera-
ture range 500 < t < 750°C. Heat
capacity data on barium and potassium
hydroxide have been determined. The
density-temperature relations of
several of the zirconium fluoride
salt mixtures have been determined.
In addition, the vapor pressures of
BeF,- and a ZrF,-bearing fuels have
been measured. A table summarizing
some of the physical properties of
materials of interest to the ANP
Froject is included.

Experimental determinations were
made of the heat transfer coefficients
of molten sodium hydroxide flowing
turbulently in a heated tube. Results
indicated that sodium hydroxide heat
transfer was similar to convective
heat transfer of ordinary fluids.
Fundamental experimental information
on heat transfer of turbulently flowing
mercury in thermal entrance regions
has been obtained; the experimental
results are in agreement with previous
theoretical determinations. Mathe-
matical analyses pertaining to circu-
lating-fuel heat transfer systems
have been developed. In one analysis
a study of the thermal structure in
the entrance region was made, and
another analysis considered non-
isothermal heat transfer. Some ex-
perimental velocity information on
natural convection in an idealized
liquid fuel has been obtained.

VISCOSITY OF FLUORIDE MIXTURES

Study of the viscosity of fluoride
mixtures has been continued with both
the rotational (Brookfield) and
efflux viscometers that were modified
to obtain control over the melt.
In the case of the efflux viscometer,
the whole system has been housed in a
small dry box so that determinations
can be made in inert atmospheres.
The efflux viscometer and the con-
tainer for the test liquid are instru-
mented with several thermocouples so
that a reasonably accurate value of
the liquid temperature can be obtained
while making determinations. Tempera-
ture errors due to thermal radiation
losses have been reduced in the
system by reducing the radiation-
configuration factor. The dry box
is divided into two sections; dne
contains the furnace, viscometer, and
balance, and the other can be used
to load containers with test materials.
The Brookfield apparatus was similarly
enclosed.

With the modified apparatus, the
viscosities of several BeF,-bearing
fluorides, one ZrF, -bearing fluoride,
and several other fluoride mixtures
were determined. The two BeF ,- bearing
fluorides had viscosities greater
than 12 centipoises at 725°C and
both approached 25 centipoises at
650°C. These viscosities were too
high to permit satisfactory heat
transfer in the experimental reactor,
and as a result a search is being
made for a lower viscosity fuel.
The one ZrF,-bearing fluoride measured
has a satisfactory viscosity, that is,
8 centipoises at 600°C, which de-
creases to 4 centipoises at 750°C.

BeF,-Bearing Fluoride Mixtures,
The viscosities of two BeF,-bearing
mixtures were determined with the
Brookfield viscometer in the range
600 to 800°C. For these measurements
1t was necessary to minimize the
formation of beryllium oxide by
bubbling HF gas through the molten
liquid prior to the run and maintain-
ing an atmosphere of HF over the melt
during the measurement. The first
mixture contained 51 mole % BeF,,

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

47 mole % NaF, and 2 mole % UF, and
showed viscosities from 12 centipoises
at 800°C up to about 25 centipoises
at 650°C. Another preparation of
considerably lower BeF, concentration
contained 12 mole % BeF,, 76 mole %
NaF, and 12 mole % UF, and was con-
siderably less viscous at the high-
temperature end of the range. However,
the viscosity (5 centipoises at 810°C)
rose rapidly as the temperature was
lowered, reached 13 centipoises at
725°C, and approached 25 centipoises
at 650°C.

These findings are in agreement
with the fact that BeF, is a glass
formed with directionally bonded
atoms; 1ts viscosity increases with
decreasing temperature considerably
more rapidly than the viscosity of
other ionically bonded salt mixtures.
These high viscosities have virtually
eliminated BeF, from the list of
potential compounds for the ARE fuel
mixture.

4r¥, -Bearing Fluoride Mixtures.
Preliminary viscosity measurements
have been obtained for a ZrF -bearing
fuel mixture, NaF -KF-ZrF,-UF, (5-51-
42-2 mole %), on the efflux viscometer.
The results are shown in Fig. 63.
Although the viscosity is satisfactory
for the present ARE, this mixture
does not contain sufficient uranium
for criticality. However, the in-
crease in the uranium concentration
that would be required should not have
a significant effect on the viscosity.

In an attempt to determine possible
variations of viscosity with various
compositions of the mixture, measure~
ments have been made with the rotational
viscometer on a mixture of 55 mole %
ZrF,-45 mole % KF after additions of
varying quantities of NaF. The
viscosity of the ZrF, -KF binary was
quite low: 3 centipoises at 800°C and
8.5 centipoises at 600°C, Four
successive additions, which brought

Material from Corrosion Loops.
A number of dynamic corrosion loops
of type-316 stainless steel have
shown signs of plugging during circu-
lation of NaF-KF-LiF-UF, mixtures.
The melting point of the fluoride
mixture remained unchanged during
the runs and, in some cases, ho
physical evidence of a plug was
found. Repeated determinations have
shown that the viscosityof the mixture

after circulation was identical,
within experimental error, with that
before circulation. Measurements
made immediately after melting the
mixture were also identical with
those made after keeping it molten
under a blanket of inert gas for
24 hours.

At present the heat capacities of

The following empirical heat

REPORT

HEAT TRANSFER IN SODIUM HYDROXIDE

H. W. Hoffman

Reactor Experimental Engineering
Division

J. Lones

Experimental determinations were
made of the heat transfer coefficients
for molten sodium hydroxide flowing
by forced convection through a heated
tube. Measurements were made in the
Reynolds modulus range of 5,000 to
12,000. Results show that molten
sodium hydroxide may be considered an
ordinary fluid - that is, any fluid
other than the liquid metals - so far
as heat transfer is concerned.

The system used to make the study
consistedof two heated tanks separated
by a long tube, part of which was the
heated test section. The test section,
a 24-in. length of the A nickel tube
(0.1875 in. OD, 0.1175 in. ID), was
heated by passing a high-amperage
electric current through the tube
wall. Chromel-~alumel thermocouples
(36 gage) were welded to the outside
of the tube wall. The test fluid was
moved by inert-gas pressure from one
tank to the other through the test
section and the fluid flow rate was
determined by weighing the fluid as
it left the test section.

The heat transfer coefficients
were calculated from the experi-
mentally obtained tube-surface and
fluid temperatures and the heat input
by the equation:

BOILING HEAT TRANSFER

W. S. Farmer

Reactor Experimental Engineering
Division

Experiments using water as the
heat transfer medium have been con-
ducted on the horizontal-tube boiling
apparatus. Heat transfer coefficients
were computed from temperature measure-
ments taken at several circumferential
positions in the tube wall. The
resulting values exhibited the same
variation with position as found for
nonboiling heat transfer. The coef-
ficients measured on the sides of
the tube were much higher than those
found on the top surface. During an
experiment at a heat transfer flux
level of 600,000 Btu/hr*ft?, vapor
binding occurred on the tube surface
and caused a rapid rise of several
thousand degrees in the metal tempera-
ture and subsequent melting of the
heat transfer tube. A new tube has
been fabricated, and consideration 1s
now being given to operation of the
boiler an 1ts present position with
boiling sodium. A test is to be
conducted to evaluate the safety
hazard associated with operating a
tank of sodium vapors at high tempera-
ture under vacuum.

156

The flat-plate experimental boiler
has been revised and reassembled for
operation. The heat transfer of
boiling mercury to a copper-plated
surface will be the first test made
with this system. Amalgamation
between the copper and mercury will
result in complete wetting of the
heat transfer surface. The results
will then be compared with previous
data obtained for mercury boiling on
a chromium-plated surface that was
only partially wet by the mercury.

ENTRANCE REGION HEAT TRANSFER

W. B. Harrison

Reactor Experimental Engineering
Division

Several months ago, experimental
work was initiated on heat transfer
to sodium 1n an entrance region.
After considering a number of possible
explanations for rather scattered and
inconsistent results, it was suspected
that sodium was not wetting the copper
heat transfer surface. In order to
obtain heat transfer through a surface
which was wettedby the medium, mercury
was used in contact with copper.
Data that resulted from the use of
three different test sections are
shown in Fig. 66, and compared with
predictions from conduction solutions.
The range of operating conditions for
the tests is indicated in Table 32.

The experimental results tend to
corroborate the predictions for the
thermal entrance region as well as
the suspicion that sodium was not
wetting copper. The implication 1s
that 1f sodium were used in a wetted
test section in the same range of
conditions heat transfer coefficients
as high as 400,000 Btu/hr-ft?*°F

should be achieved.

The flat-plate natural-convection
apparatus, Fig. 67, is now operating
successfully. The test section 1s
defined by the two parallel copper
plates and the plastic end walls.
The copper plates serve as electrodes
for the electrolyte solution in the
test section. The heat is generated
by electrical resistance heating 1in
the volume of the liquid electrolyte.
The test section 1s approximately
0.75 by 6 by 20 inches. The generated
heat 1s carried away by the heat ex-
changer brazed to the copper plates.

The velocity traverse was obtained
by visually timing the movement of
suspended particles of bentonite.
The temperature traverse was obtained
by a traversing thermocouple assembly.
Qualitative velocity measurements were
taken in the laminar flow regions.
The mass flow rate and the velocity
distribution observed compare favorably
with theoretical analyses referred to
in previous reports. Temperature
traverses are currently being obtained.

RADIATION DAMAGE

D. S. Billington, Solid State Division

Studies of radiation damage have
continued in the X-10 graphite pile,
the LITR, and the 86-in. cyclotron.
Previously reported experiments on
the effects of irradiation on the
fused fluoride fuels, the operation
of liquid metal loops, the creep of
metals, and the thermal conductivity
of metals have been extended and
supplemented. Preparations are under
way to continue these studies in the

higher flux MTR.

An increased rate of attack on the
container was caused by irradiation
in the LITR of Inconel capsules con-
taining the NaF-KF-UF, type of fuel
mixtures, whereas capsules containing
berylliium-<bearing fuels showed no
signs of radiation-induced corrosion.
The evidence to date indicates that
rate of corrosion by
fuel mixtures was due
but that the

the increased

to the radiation field,

mechanism probably involved the im-
purities in the fuel rather than any
inherent instability of the fused
fluorides.

The inpile experiments on cantilever
creep were extended to Inconel. As in
the previously reported experiments
with stainless steel and nickel,
the graphite-pile irradiation at the
temperatures and stresses applied
caused an increase in the secondary
creep rate.

Thermal conductivity studies in the
graphite pile and LITR on stabilized
Inconel and high-purity nickel demon-
strated that there was no detectable
effect due to irradiation.

Additional details on radiation
damage studies are contained in the

IRRADIATION OF FUSED MATERIALS

G. W. Keilho ltz

Materials Chemistry Division

The study of the radiation stability
of fused fluorides in contact with
Inconel has continued in the LITR and
the 86-in. cyclotron. Experiments on
beryllium-bearing fuel samples in the
LITR indicate that they are stable
during exposures of 140 hr in fields
producing power dissipations up to
550 watts/cc of sample. Cyclotron
experiments of short duration have
shown that the lithium-bearing fuel
samples are stable to proton beams
dissipating 750 watts/cc of sample.
However, a slight amount of radiation-
induced corrosion is produced by beams
dissipating 4500 watts/cc.

ducted during the past quarter on
beryllium- and zirconium-bearing fuels
irradiated in the LITR., The results
of all the experiments on beryllium-
bearing fuels are shown in Table 33.

Inconel specimen that contained this
fuel is shown in Fig. 69. Analytical
results are not yet available on
irradiated capsules of zirconium-
bearing fuel.

Equipment similar to that to be
used for testing fuels in the MTR was
successfully operated in the LITR.
A concentrated NaF-UF, mixture was
successfully irradiated at a power

dissipation of 2450 watts/cc of fuel.
Bench tests indicate that the equip-
ment is suitable for a power dissipa-
tion of 3500 watts/cc. Equipment has

As reported last quarter, sodium
was circulated at a velocity of 1
ft/sec in the X-10 graphite pile
through a loop of Tuconel for 50 hr
at 1000°F and 115 hr at 1500°F. An
electromagnetic pump was used, and the
temperature of the material in the
pump cell was 10C0°F. The flow rate
of sodium through the loop gradually

FOR PERIOD ENDING JUNE 10, 1952

decreased and eventually the loop
could not be operated.

When the activity of the loop had
decayed sufficiently, an examination
was made to determine the condition
of the loop and the cause of flow
stoppage. It was found that there
were several constrictions caused by
penetration of welds. One of the con-
strictions in the cold part of the
loop was almost completely closed by
grey, powdery material. X-ray exami-
nation showed the powder to be largely
nickel, and it 1s now being analyzed
spectrographically.

At various times while the flow of
the loop was halted, radioactive decay
curves were obtained for the part of
the loop outside the pile. An analysis
of these curves showed that the sodium
contained no long-lived corrosion
products from the Inconel tube walls.
Specimens of the Inconel from the in-
pile and out-of-pile portions of the
loop are being examined metallo-
graphically.

A second sodium loop was operated
in the X-10 graphite pile for 95 hr at
1500°F; operation was discontinued
because of a leak in the pump cell.
An examination of this loop is being
made. Another sodium loop containing
several engineering improvements 1is
being constructed for operation in the
graphite pile. Design and construction
of the sodium loop for operation in
the LITR is under way, and a fused-
fluoride-fuel loop is being designed
for operation in the MTR.

The neutron spectrum and gamma-ray
heating in hole HB-3 in the LITR are
being determined. This horizontal
beam hole has been used for a large
number of experiments by the GE-ANP
project and is expected to be available
for a considerable amount of experi-
mentation by the ORNL-ANP group in the

near future.

CREEP UNDER IRRADIATION

J. C. Wilson J. C. Zukas
W. W. Davis
Solid State Division

Three cantilever creep tests on
Inconel have been completed in the
graphite pile; the results are shown
in Fig. 70. Tt appears that Inconel
as it 1s now heat treated (1650 or
1700°F anneal) is an unstable material
with respect to its creep properties
under irradiation. This is analogous
to the resvlts previously reported for
type-347 stainless steel and nickel.
A cantilever creep test on Inconel
with the standard, ARE, 1700°F anneal
is in progress in the higher flux LITR,

The first model of a bellows-loaded
tensile creep apparatus for irradia-
tion experiments in the MTR has been
designed and construction has begun.
The specimen tobe tested is 1/2-in.-0D,
0.035-in. wall Inconel tubing. Several
models of the furnace that will reside
inside the specimen have been bench
tested. An attempt is being made to
minimize temperature gradients.

Bench testing is in progress on an
extensometer that utilizes a Bourdon
tube and an electrical contact. It is
believed that this type of extensometer
will be operable in the MTR because
of its low mass and simple geometry.
A type-5734 RCA transducer tube has
been placed in the can with the
cantilever creep test in the LITR so
that the effect of neutron radiation
on its static and emission character -
istics can be studied. Approximately
0.003-in. movement of the sensitive
element of the tube gives a change in
output voltage of about 40. The low
mass of the tube should permit it to
be used in high-flux reactors without
excessive gamma-ray heating.

A piece of natural quartz, 0.18 in.
square and 1.3 in. long, was irradiated

164

in the LITR for a one-week period to
determine whether irradiation produced
dimensional changes, since the thermal
expansion of quartz along the Z axis
appears usable for calibrating ex-
tensometers in a reactor. A slight
discoloration of the crystal was noted
after irradiation, but, within the
precision of measurement (0.05%), no
dimensional changes were faund.

RADIATION EFFECTS ON
THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY

A. F. Cohen L. C. Templeton
Solid State Division

Recent experiments in the X-10
graphite pile and LITR on heat-stabi-
lized Inconel and high-purity nickel
show that the irradiation has no
measurable effect on thermal conduc-
tivity. In previously reported ex-
periments on Inconel at high tempera-
tures some loss of conductivity was
suffered by the inpile specimens. In
light of the recent results, this now
appears likely to be the result of
phase changes in unstabilized material
induced or accelerated by the irradia-
tion.

Two fabricated Inconel samples were
stabilized by heat treating for 1/2 hr
at 2050°F, slowly cooled to 1550°F
where they were held for 24 hr, and
then furnace cooled to room tempera-
ture. This heat treatment caused
precipitation of chromium carbides
during the slow cooling so that the
specimen would be in the most stable
condition from room temperature to
1500°F. One of these samples was used
for a relative type of experiment 1n
the graphite pile and the other for
an absolute conductivity experiment

in the LITR.
The

relative experiment in the
graphite pile was in a fast-neutron
flux of approximately 3 x 10'!. The

specimen was held at lower temperatures

and then at 1500°F for five weeks. No
change in ggpnductivity greater than
1 to 2% was observed.

The absolute thermal conductivity
specimen was a long cylinder with an
internal heater in which the heat
flowed radially outward. The specimen
was placed in the hole HB-3, and the
maximum power level of the LITR during
the experiment was 1000 kw. Changes
in thermal conductivity were sought
as a function of irradiation time at
a given flux level and a given specimen
temperature after thermal equilibrium
was reached. The time required to
reach equilibrium is of the order of
2 to 4 hr after a change in reactor
power level or a change in the heater
current. The highest temperature at
which measurements were made was
1300°F. No decrease in the conduc-
tivity was observed at 1300°F over a
period of 24 hours. At lower tempera-

166

tures no decrease in conductivity was
observed during a four-week period.

One absolute conductivity experi-
ment, mostly at low temperatures, was
carried out in the LITR on an ARE heat-
treated Inconel specimen. Preparations
are being made for two more such
experiments at elevated temperatures.

A cylindrical, high-purity nickel
specimen was used in an absolute thermal
conductivity experiment in hole HB-3 of
the LITR., A series of experiments were
performed at various LITR power levels
and at various temperatures up to
1475°F. Half of the 17-day total
irradiation time was at a power level
of 1500 kw. No changes in conductivity
as a function of irradiation time were
found. The constancy of the variables

conductivity would be very easily

nickel, and chromium ~ to determine
their applicability to the new fuel
mixtures.

A rapid and accurate method for the
determination of total alkali metals
has been developed. In this method,
the hydrogen ion displaced from: a
cation-exchange resin by the alkali
metals 1s titrated. A cation-exchange
column is also being used successfully
for the quantitative separation of
sodium and potassium,

A volumetric method for the deter-
mination of zirconium is being studied.
This method, which depends upon the
titration of the base liberated when
a fluoride is added to zirconium
hydroxide, appears promising, and it
1s expected to be more rapid than the

gravimetric method presently being
used.

Improvements that eliminate the
interference of zirconium have been
made 1n the method for the deter-
mination of iron. In the deter-
mination of sulfide in fluorides and
eutectics, the colorimetric method
that depends upon the formation of
methylene blue has been adapted. A
method is currently being studied for
the determination of total sulfur in
these materials by reduction of all
sulfur compounds and subsequent deter-
mination as sulfide by the same method.

It has been found that zirconium
oxide can be determined in zirconium
tetrafluoride because of its insolu-
bility in oxalic or tartaric acid.
However, a successful method for the
determination of zirconium oxyfluoride
is not yet available. A method 1s
being sought for the determination of
water in eutectic components to a

lower limit of 0,05%.

Total Alkali Metals. A rapid and
accurate me thod for the determination
of total alkali metals in fluoride
eutectics has been developed. In this
method, which makes use of an 1on-
exchange resin, a sulfate solution of
the alkali metals, separated from
uranium and other cations, is passed
through a cation-exchange column. The
alkali metals are retained by the
resin and replaced by equivalent
amounts of hydrogen ions, and the
sulfuric acid formed is eluted from
the column with water. Two titrations
are required: the first to determine
the free-acid content of the starting
solution and the other to determine
the total acidity of the eluted
sulfuric acid solution. The difference
in acidity is equivalent to the alkali
metals present.

The success of this method depends
upon the removal of all cations except
the alkali metals, since other cations
will also replace hydrogen ions on the
resin. In the case of uranium, the
separation is effected by passing the
solution through an anion-exchange
column in which uranium is retained as
an anionic sulfate complex. The alkali
metal ions, which are not retained,
are guantitatively eluted with dilute
sulfuric acid. The resulting alkali
metal sulfate solution is then ready
to be passed through the cation-
exchange column. The method has so
far been applied to fuel mixtures
containing only uranium in addition
to alkali metals. The same technique
for separating uranium and alkali
metals should, however, be applicable
to solutions containing zirconium,
since zirconium also forms anionic
complexes in IN sulfuric acid; this

will be investigated. Approximately
1% precision in the range 35 to 90%
can be obtained with this method of
determining total alkali metals.

Sodium, Potassium, and Lithium. In
view of the desirability of determining
individual alkali metals in the presence
of each other, attention has been given
to methods of separating the con-
stituents. Lithium can be separated
from sodium and potassium by extraction
of the alkali chlorides with 2-ethyl
hexanol.¢!) The use of ion-exchange
columns is being studied for separating
sodium and potassium. By means of a
70 by 2 cm column of Dowex-50 (50 to
100 mesh), sharp separations of sodium
and potassium in quantities of the
order of 100 mg can be achieved by
using 2N hydrochloric acid solution
as the elution agent. Although the
procedure is extremely time-consuming
(approximately 8 hr per separation),
it has the advantage that very little
attention by the operator is required.
Standard methods are used for the
determination of the separated alkali
metals.

McClure and Banks(?) hasbeen used with

sulfuric acid proved to be satisfactory
for dissolving the samples and for
volatilizing the fluoride, Because of
the interference of zirconium, the
method previously used to determine
iron could not be applied to the
analysis of the new fuel samples. An
alternate method employing hydroquinone
as the reducing agent, ammonium acetate
to adjust the pH and prevent the
precipitation of zirconium, and
orthophenanthroline as the chromogenic
agent is mow 1n use. Zirconium is
determined by gravimetric methods in
which phenylarsonic acid(*’ or mandelic
acid(3) are used as the precipitating
agents. This method has proved satis-
factory with respect to accuracy and
precision,

When large numbers of determi-
nations are required, however, volu-
metric methods are generally more
satisfactory; hence, investigations
are now under way to determine the
feasibility of a volumetric method
that would increase the output of
zirconium determinations. Sawaya and
Yamashita¢®) indicated that a fluoride
complex could serve as a basis for a
volumetric method, Zirconium is first
precipitated as Zr(OH),, KF is added
to form the zirconium~fluoride complex

necessity for removing zirconium from
the solution, the method was satis-
factorily modified by employing ammonium
acetate, which prevents hydrolysis of
the zirconium ion. Hydroquinone is
used as the reductant for iron, and
orthophenanthroline 1s used as the
chromogenic agent.

Chromium. The diphenylcarbazide
method for the determination of
chromium, in which perchloric acid is
used as the oxidant, has proven satis-
factory in the presence of zirconium.

ANALYSES FOR IMPURITIES IN
FLUORIDE COMPOUNDS

A study is being made of the
impurities in the individual components
of eutectics., The impurities are
alkali metal, beryllium, zirconium,
and uranium(IV) fluorides. Determi-
nations of traces of silicon, nitrate,
chloride, sulfate, sulfide, and oxides
have either been made. or are currently
in progress, Details of methods for
the determinations of the above
elements, with the exception of
sulfate, sulfide, and zirconium oxide
in zirconium tetrafluoride, have been
described in a previous report. (?)

Sulfate and Sulfide. The presence
of traces of sulfide in fluoride
eutectics 1s believed to be a cause of
corrosion of metal containers (stain-
less steels and Inconel) at high
temperatures. During the cleaning
(with acidic solutions) of containers
used for the preparation of the
eutectics, a distinct odor of hydrogen
sulfide has been noticed. Colorimetric
determinations of sulfide by the
methylene blue method(?? have shown
that traces of sulfide are present.
Development work is currently in
progress on methods for the determi-
nation of the sulfur content of

individual components of fuels, since
this 1s probably the only possible
source of sulfur contamination. The
method currently under study involves
the reduction of all sulfur compounds
(sul fate, sulfite, and thiosulfate)
to sulfide with a reducing mixture
composed of hydriodic, hydrochloric,
and phosphorous acids, and the deter~
mination of sulfide colorimetrically.
Preliminary tests have shown this
method to be applicable to fluoride
salts, It will also be extended to
eutectics.

Zirconium Oxide and Oxyfluoride. A
method for the determination of the
oxide in the fluoride has been de-
veloped. This procedure is based on
the fact that ZrO, is insoluble in
saturated solutions of oxalic acid
(pH = 0.6) or tartaric acid (pH = 0.7),
which readily dissolve ZrF,. No
soluble zirconium was detected in
tests in which ZrO, was refluxed for
40 hr with oxalic acid solution or
tartaric acid solution. Unfortunately,
this method does not separate all the
oxygen-containing materials, since the
oxyfluoride 1s nearly as soluble as the
the fluoride in oxalic
acid

or tartaric
Attention 1s being
given to chemical means for determining

solutions.

Some lots of ZrF, that were tested
contained as much as 9.5% of Zr0,.
Examinations of sublimed ZrF, by the
oxalic acid procedure have shown no
detectable residue.

Water. The water content of alkali
metal fluorides and zirconium oxide
must be taken into account in calcu-
lations connected with cold critical
experiments, For this reason, and
al so because traces of water may
contribute to the corrosive properties
of the fuel, 1t is important that
methods be available for the deter-
mination.

172

Two methods were tested. One, a
modified method of Feibig and Warf(®)
in which sodium carbonate 1s used to
react with any HF liberated during
combustion, yielded results which
showed that the lower limit for the
determination (0.05%) could not be
attained under the conditions used,
Indications are that the size of sample
must be increased topermit the weighing
of significant amounts of water.
Preliminary tests are in progress 1n
which a large sample is dried 1n a

vacuum ove,

The second method, that of Karl
Fischer, with certain modifications in
iodine concentration, may be used for
the determination of traces of water in
alkali metal fluorides. However, there
is some uncertainty in this method when
applied to solid materials,
part of the water may be trapped in
the solid phase and not come in con-
tact with the Karl Fischer reagent.

SERVICE ANALYSIS

H. P. House L. J. Brady
J. W. Robinson

Analytical Chemistry Division

Expansion of the work of the ANP
Reactor Chemistry group during the
last quarter resulted in more than a
twofold increase in the analytical
services required. Approximately 85%
of the samples analyzed were from
reactor chemistry studies of various
fluoride salt mixtures. During the
latter part of the period there was a
decrease in the number of fuel samples
containing beryllium, but fuel mixtures
in which zirconium fluoride is a major
constituent have become increasingly
important.

(8g, G. Feibig and J. C. Warf, Determination
of Water in Fluorides, CC-2939 (June 29, 1945).
Attempts were made to supplement
information, gained by metallographic
methods, concerning preferential
leaching of the components of the
container wall by analyzing samples of
consecutive thin layers taken from
the inner surfaces of tubes that had
been in contact with the molten salt.
Because of lack of uniformity of the
surface of the tubes only small amounts
of sample could be collected and thus
limitations were imposed on the
analytical results that could be
obtained.

Most of the remaining 15% of the
samples analyzed during this period
were alkali fluoride fuels derived
from tests conducted by the ANP Experi-
mental Engineering group. The Experi-
mental Engineering group has also been
interested in determining preferential
