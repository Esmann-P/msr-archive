DYNAMIC ANALYSIS OF A SALT-SUPERCRITICAL
WATER HEAT EXCHANGER AND THROTTLE USED WITH MSBR
Francis H. Clark O. W. Burke

 

 

ABSTRACT

A linearized, coarse space mesh model of a salt-supercritical water
heat exchanger and the downstream throttle was simulated on analog
computers. The effects on certain output quantities of changes in

~ certain input quantities were noted. The output quantities were heat-
exchanger water outlet temperature and pressure ’ salt outlet temperature,
and enthalpy output. The input quantities were heat-exchanger water
inlet temperature and pressure, salt inlet temperature, salt velocity, and
throttle setting. Changes were studied only around design steady state.

Sufficient input-output data were acquired to permit a greatly sim-
plified representation of these components for further system studies in
~ the neighborhood of design steady state. A tentative scheme of heat
exchanger~-throttle conirol was devised to hold water outlet temperature
within a 1°F range, and water outlet pressure within a few ‘pounds of
design while enthalpy output follows demand.
INTRODUCTION
To design a control system suitable for an electrical power generation system
with a Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor as a thermal source or simply to determine the
control requirements of the reactor alone in such a system, it is essential to under-

stand the dynamic responses of the major system components. It is economical and

therefore customary to maintain a constant inlet temperature and pressure to the

high pressure turbine and to vary mass flow with load. The turbine inlet temper-
ature and pressure and the heat rate are, in fact, the variables i in the power

generation section which are most closely controlled: the temperature and pressure

-
 

 

 

 

 

to be near constant,and the heat rate to follow the load. The steam generator”

and turbine are the components at which these variables are sensed and where the
control loops make their action felt. The dynamic behavior of the steam generator-
throttle complex is therefore crucial to determining control requirements in more
remote parts of the system. We have, consequently, simulated and studied these
components. The study was carried out on the Oak Ridge National Laboratory
analog computing equipment, consisting of one EAI 221R and two EAI 16-31R

computers.

STEAM GENERATOR DESIGN AND MODEL
The steam generator design which was studied may be described roughly as’
follows. It is a vertical U-shaped heat exchanger, total length about 70 feet.
It is a one shell pass (salt) and one tube pass (water) unit. There are 349 parallel
water tubes. The tubes are of Hastelloy N, OD 0.50 in., thickness 0.077 in. The
shell ID is 18.25 in. The mass flow rate of water is 6.33 x 10° Ib/hr, and of salt is
3.66 x 106 Ib/hr. The entrance and exit temperatures of the salt were, respectively,

1125°F and 850°F, and of the water, 700°F and 1000°F. The inlet and outlet

 

* Although this is a supercritical system which, strictly, does not have a liquid,

a boiling, and a steam section, we shall nonetheless use such terminology to describe

the high density, the rapidly changing density, and the low density regions and shall

refer to the component as a steam generator.

water pressures used were 3800 psi and 3600 psi respectively. * Further details
related to the design of this component are given in ref 1, p. 46 ff, case A.

The system modeled has been vastly simplified from the design system. It is |
believed, however, that the properties essential to the study of steady state control
have been preserved. |

The model is a single, water tubular channel surrounded by a salt annular
channel. The cross-sectional area of each channel is taken equal to the total

crosssectional areas of flow of water and salt, respectively, in the design system.

~ Heat transfer coefficients were computed to be consistent with the steady state, local

heat transfer and temperature profi les. The water-film heat transfer coefficient was
taken to vary as the 0.6 power of the water velocity, and the corresponding salt-
film coefficient as the 0.8 power of the salt velocity. |

Compressibility effects in the water were dealt with explicit! y. The salt was

i

treated as an incompressible fluid.

 

*The reference design gives 3766 psi as the inlet water pressure, and 3600 psi as
the outlet. The static design,” however, neglected important compressibility effects

and failed to achieve a system enthalpy balance . Both these effects, which are,

in fact, probably not separate, are allowed for if one increases the inlet pressure to

3800 psi.

reason of the assumption that the salt is incompressible. Neglect of the potential

REDUCTION TO ORDINARY DIFFERENTIAL

EQUATIONS AND LINEARIZATION

The analog computer can deal continuously with only one independent variable.

Hence, to solve partial differential equations, we must apply a mesh or differencing

scheme to all but one of the independent variables—- in our case, to the X variable.

There are a few optional connections in Fig. 2 beyond those indicated by the
above equations. These optional connections are feedback control loops which
were developed in the study and which will be dealt with in the section entitled

Boundaries and Controls, p. 22.

PARAMETERS OF THE PROBLEM

Initially, the system was cut into eight spatial nodes whose location in the
laboratory reference frame was held fixed. With so few nodes it would have been |
better to permit at least some of them, those associated with the "boiling" region,
to float. The problem was already of such complexity, however, that we could
not possibly meet the equipment demands of such an approach,and the nodes were
| assigned fixed coordinates.

Steady state design values of the system variables are given in Table 1.
Table 2 gives the derived parameters and constants at various nodes. Table 3 gives
the sets of parameters used to represent the equation of state of water. Other
parameters used in the study include

We will assume both a positive and b non-negative (as they are in any reason-

X > X _jand that V >0; that is, that motion is from low to high values of X.
Let us also assume that the boundary condition on f is applied at high values of X,
so that, in a marching numerical integration, the value at X will be known and the .

If either (19a) or (19b) is satisfied, it implies, of course, that G(f) contains
implicitly some negative feedback that compensates for the explicit positive feed-
back AF(t) in (17) and (18).

Note that the positive feedback in (17) and (18) was due entirely to two
circumstances :

1. That a in (15) was taken positive.

2, That the direction of integration was upstream; that is, that the
boundary condition was applied at the high-value end of X,while the velocity V
was positive.

It is clear that when these two conditions for positive feedback are met,and if
there is an overall implicit negative feedback contained in G by reason of the
satisfaction of (19a) or (19b), one must be careful in what one does with G not to
destroy the sometimes delicate balance. This problem and these considerations

will be found to be very relevant to the problem at hand.

LIMITATIONS OF THE MODEL
In checking out the problem on the analog computer it was found that there
were instabilities generated in the first two nodes. We have not made a complete
analysis of these instabilities, but we did arrive at a partial understanding of them,

at least.
17}

.

19

First, we note that the explicit positive feedback of (17) and (18) is present.

- [Boundary condition (10b) is applied at high X, and V is positive; hence, both

conditions for this kind of feedback are met.] There is a negative feedback due
to friction which, in all nodes except one and two, overcomes the positive feed-
back. Other terms which contribute to the implicit negative feedback are less
tightly coupled to the flow integrators. It is believed that the spatial nodes form
such a coarse mesh that this implicit feedback does not arrive with the gain and
phase necessary to insure stability.

The first two nodes, as can be seen in Tables 1 and 2, comprise about 10% of
the length and heat transfer capability of the system. They further are confined
to the "water" section, that is, the region where the water density is high and is
changing reasonably slowly. The "boiling" region lies beyond them.

In order to rid the system of the instability, the first two nodes were arbitrarily
excluded and the water entrance boundary was placed at node three. Such drastic
action was taken only with great reluctance. In extenuation it is argued

1. that only about 10% of the system is excluded;

2. that from the viewpoint of dynamics the water region; which was
excluded, has the least changeable characteristic on account of its near
incompressibility ; - :

C3 that the instability excluded was almost surely introduced by the numerical

~ scheme employed and would not therefore be a physical instability;

isl 4. that correction of the instability would probably require numerical methods

which imply far more computing equipment than the amount available.
J
 

 

20

“In any event, the first important limitation of the model is the truncation
of the water section.

As indicated in earlier sections the actual system is a bundle of 349 parallel
water tubes. The system as modeled is a single water tube. Parallel channel systems,
by reason of interactions and ‘oscillations possible between channels, are almost
always subject to certain kinds of instabilities which simply do not exist in a one-
channel system. The restriction to one channel was dictated by the limited amount
of computing machinery available. The second important limitation is, therefore,
the single water channel.

Reference to Table 1 will show that from node 3 to node 7 the water density
changed by a factor of about 6. Clearly, that indicates too broad a range of
physical variation to be treated at all adequately with only five nodes. Again
equipment limitations dictated the restriction. A faithful spatial representation
would have demanded many additional nodes. The third important limitation is
the coarseness of the spatial mesh.

We have already described the procedures by which the problem was linearized
and higher order terms neglected. In view of the linearization, one should place
no faith in the validity of the description of any system disturbance which leads to
a change of more than 10% in any system variable. Small changes about design
point are sufficient to permit studies related to design of a steady state control
system. In this the linearized model is sufficient. It is insufficient, however, to

study an automatic control system as it makes large changes in load demand, for

example. . Essentially all instabilities which will be of interest in a real system |
are non-linear. So are all accident events. The linearized model is of little help
in the study of such non-linear events.

It would have been possible with available equipment to have simulated some
of the non-linear aspects of the system. This was not done for the following
reasons; |

1. It was believed, and subsequent experience showed it to be so, that the
problem would place very severe demands upon machine performance. Linear com~
ponents are generally less troublesome in operation than non-linear. Hence, lineari-
zation increases the success s probability of the problem. |

2, The very coarse space mesh demanded that dynamic changes be restricted

to fairly small changes from steady state. For any large amplitude, spatial effects

would be badly distorted on the coarse space mesh. This amplitude limitation, in

_ effect, confines the problem to the region of linearity in time.

3. Not all non-linear effects could be handled with the equipment available.
The fourth major limitation of the model is, therefore, the neglect of non-
linear effects. 2 |
| It is evident in each of these impartant restrictions on the model that the
limited amount of canputing equipment available causes the restriction on the model.

This ought not to be surprising. The dynamic behavior of a once-through boiler is

known to be tremendously complicated.

Such systems have been successfully studied on hybrid computers, but not on

machines of lesser capability, digital or analog. Hence, to attempt the study
 

 

22

on an analog machine, or on anything less than a hybrid, was to insure that
something less then a full study be made.

As has been previously indicated this abbreviated model should answer some
important questions about control in the neighborhood of design steady state.
It should not be adequate to handle questions of control following large load

changes, of non-linear stability, or of accidents.

BOUNDARIES AND CONTROLS
We have already indicated that the specification of the water pressure and
temperature at boundary 0, in Fig. 1, and the salt temperature at boundary M
are left available to the user as boundary conditions. We have noted that R, P, and

T are connected by Equation (10b) at the eighth node, and this relation serves as

 

a boundary condition on R. In this relation >, the throttle setting, can
be varied as an additional control at the disposal of the user. The final available
control is "W"”, the change in the salt velocity.

All of the above controls can at the user's option, be set to a value selected
by the user. (With a linearized modzl, of course, change of any system variable by
more than 10% from design steady state would probably be unjustified.) Provision
has also been made to operate some of these controls, at the user's option, with a
feedback error signal. After some experimentation with the system it was determined

that the following feedback signals should be optionally incorporated for investigation.

RESULTS OF SIMULATION

Five variables have been reserved to be driven by feedback signals if desired.

They are inlet water temperature Tz (063), inlet water pressure P3 (513), inlet

salt temperature 87 (203), salt velocity W (003), and fractional throttle setting -
ALA (19), It can be seen in Fig. 2 that each of the above variables is an
integrator output. Each of these integrators is provided with first-order lag circuitry.
All of them except (063), the inlet water temperature, are provided with an option to
switch them out of the first-order-lag arbitrary input circuitry into an errorsignal-
feedback circuitry. These feedbacks will be dealt with shortly. Not shown in
Fig. 2 but available with minor patching changes is the capability of changing each
of these variables by an arbritrary amount in step fashion. | oo

The variables which we wish to observe most carefully with a view to their con-
trol are outlet water temperature Ty (18,), outlet water pressure P; (407), heat
output AH/H (48), salt velocity W (003), and water mass flow rate (75).

A set of eight diagnostic runs was performed. Each run started from design
steady state, and in each run a single variable was changed in a first-order lag or
a step. Table 5 summarizes what was done in each of these runs. Figures 3 through
10 are time traces of these runs showing the effects on important variables. From
these results rough gain-lag information can be estimated by examining steady states
before and after excitation. This information is summarized in Table 6. Use of
such information will permit a much abbreviated description of the steam generator
for incorporation in a system analysis.

Attension is next fixed on feedback control schemes. No attempt was made to find
anything like optimum control. There would be no point to such an attempt at this

stage of design. Accordingly, only simple integrating feedbacks were used.

The question to which an answer was sought was whether a scheme of control
could be found which would

n be generally consistent with the expected dynamic response of the reactor-
heat exchanger; | |

| 2. provide a heat rate which closely followed load demand;

3. hold water outlet temperature within a 1°F band of variation;

4. hold water outlet pressure within a small (but unspecified) band of
variation. |

To regulate outlet water pressure, a feedback connection from outlet water pressure
to inlet water pressure was constructed as shown in Fig. 11. Run 35 was made
with the connections and gains di shown in Fig. 11. The system was excited by a |
10% increase in salt velocity on a 1-sec first-order lag. Figure 12 shows the
results of this run. With other variables ignored the outlet pressure is very satis-
factorily held within a range of 21b of steady state, and these small fluctuations
damped out within 12 sec.

Figure 13 shows the circuitry for sending a feedback signal from the heat rate
amplifier (48,) to the throttle integrator (19). Also shown on that figure is the
circuitry for inserting heat demand by way of integrator(5,). }

Runs 36, J7A, 378, and 7¢ were conducted to find an appropriate feedback
from heat rate to throttle in order to hold the heat rate stably on a selected value.

[The value selected is determined by the output of (57). This output was held at

In each of these runs the system was excited when in steady state by increasing salt

velocity by 10% on a 1-sec First-order lag. Figures 14, 15, 16, and 17 are

the time tracer of Runs 36, 7A, 37B, and 37C respectively. Figure 14 shows a

classical divergent oscillation caused by too much gain. Figures 15, 16, 17 are

all fairly comparable showing reasonable stability over a broad range of gain. The

pressure controller (Fig. 11) is still in the system, but there is a more lively variation
.in outlet pressure with the throttle control also present. Configuration 37C (Fig. 16)

was chosen as a satisfactory compromise between heat rate and pressure control.

With pressure and heat-rate controls in, attention was turned to water outlet

temperature. Figure 18 shows a feedback path connecting water outlet temperature

T; (18) to salt inlet. remperature 87 (205). Runs 38A and 388 were conducted

with the following values set on the components in Fig. 18:

Inlet Temperature.

The system was excited from design steady state in each of these runs with a |
5% increase in heat demand (see Fig. 13) inserted at a ramp rate of 5%/min.

Figures 19 and 20 are the time traces of Runs 38A and 38B respectively.
Figure 19 shows an 8°F variation in water outlet temperature, completely |
unacceptable. Figure 20 shows a variation a shade over 1°F. This would be very
nearly acceptable. However, the feedback circuitry does not reflect the very con-
siderable time delay to the salt inlet temperature 6; that would be caused by the
presence of the reactor and the primary heat exchanger. (The pressure and throttle |
controls were present in these runs.) |

Run 39A was like 38B except that the inlet salt temperature 67 was inserted
through a 10-sec first-order lag. Figure 21, which is the time ace, is oscillatory
and diverging. Run 39B is like 39A but with feedback gain reduced to 1/10 its
value in 39A. Further, the excitation was limited to a 3% heat demand increase.
Figure 22 shows the system now convergent but with an unacceptable oscillation.

In order to avoid the oscillation introduced by the time lag on gy, it was

determined to control the water outlet temperature by varying salt velocity. This

makes possible a much quicker response. The salt velocity could then be returned to
