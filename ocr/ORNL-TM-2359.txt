ABSTRACT

We have examined the second group of Hastelloy N surveile

lance samples removed from the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment.
Two rods of standard Hastelloy N were removed from the surveil
lance position outside the core vessel and were exposed to the
nitrogen plus 2 to 5% 0, cell environment for 11,000 hr. Metal-
lographic examination showed that the alloy was compatible with
this environment, showing only superficial oxidation and no
evidence of nitriding. These samples were exposed to a thermal
fluence of 1.3 Xx 10° neutrons/cm®, and the mechanical proper-
ties were altered appreciably. Both tensile and creep tests
were run that showed significant changes in the mechanical
properties, particularly the strain at fracture. These changes

are in good agreement with those observed for materials irra-

a diated in a helium environment in the Oak Ridge Research Reactor.

 

Two rods of modified Hastelloy N containing small additions

of titanium and zirconium were removed from the core surveillance
facility with a thermal fluence of 4.1 X 102° neutrons/cm?.

These materials had not been annealed properly to put them in

their most radiation-resistant condition, but tests on these

materials ‘indicated that they have slightly improved postirra-

diation mechanical properties and that their corrosion resistance

is acceptable, ~

INTRODUCTION

| : E The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment is a single-region reactor

| that is fueled by a molten fluoride salt (65 LiF—29.1 BeF,—5 ZrF,~0.9 UF,,
oo mole %), moderated by unclad graphite, and contained by Hastelloy N

© (Ni-16 Mo—7 Cr—4 Fe-=0.05 C, wt %). The details of the reactor design

 

 
 

 

 

and construction can be found elsewhere.! We knew that the neutron
environment would produce some changes in the two structural materials —
graphite and Hastelloy N, and we were very confident of the compatibility
of these materials with the fluoride salt, However, we needed to keep
abreast of the possible development of problems within the reactor itself.
For these reasons, we developed a surveillance program that would allow
us to follow any changes in properties of graphite and Hastelloy N
specimens as the reactor operated.

The reactor went critical on June 1, 1965, and assumed normal opera-
tion in May 1966. The first group of surveillance specimens was in the
reactor from September 8, 1965, to July 28, 1966, and was removed after
8682 Mwhr of operation (designated "first group"). The results of our
tests on the Hastelloy N specimens were reported previously.? A second
set of specimens was removed from the core on May 9, 1967, after an
additional 27,600 Mwhr of operation (total reactor operation was
36,247 Mwhr), These specimens were two modified alloys containing
nominal 0.5% additions of titanium and zirconium. These were inserted
on September 13, 1966, after the first group was removed to determine the
mechanical property changes of these alloys due to irradiation and to
evaluate the compatibility of these alloys with the MSRE environment.

Two rods of standard Hastelloy N located outside the core and 5 in. from
the vessel were removed on June 5, 1967. These specimens had been in
place since the reactor began operation and were examined to determine
the compatibility of the material with the MSRE cell environment

(No + 25% 02) and the changes in the mechanical properties due to
irradiation.

This report will describe the results of tests on the Hastelloy N
surveillance specimens removed during May and June 1967 (designated
"second group"), which includes two rods of modified (zirconium and
titanium) alloys removed from the core and two rods of standard

Hastelloy N removed from outside the core vessel.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Surveillance Assembly

The core surveillance assembly was designed by W. H. Cook and others,
and the details have been reported.? The facility is shown pictorially
and schematically in Fig. 1. The specimens are arranged in three
stringers. Each stringer is sbout 62 in. long and consists of two
Hastelloy N rods and a graphite section made up of various pieces that
are joined by pinning and tongue-and-groove joints. The Hastelloy N
rod is periodically reduced to 0.125 in. in diameter and can be cut into

small tensile specimens after it is removed from the reactor. Three

stringers are joined together so that they can be separated in a hot

cell and reassembled with one or more new stringers for reinsertion into
the reactor. The assembled stringers fit into a perforated Hastelloy N
basket that is inserted into an axial position about 2.8 in. from the
core center line. |

When the basket was removed on July 28, 1966, some of the specimens

were bent, and the entire assembly had to be replaced. Slight modifica-

tions in the design were made, and the assembly was removed recently and

found to be in excellent condition.’

A control facility is associated with the surveillance program. It
utilizes a "fuel salt" containing depleted uranium in a static pot that
is heated electrically. The temperature is controlled by the MSRE com-
puter so that the temperature matches that of the reactor. Thus, these

specimens are exposed to conditions the same as those in the reactor

‘except for the static salt and the absence of a neutron flux.

There is another surveillance facility for Hastelloy N located out-

side the core in a vertical position about 5 in. from the vessel (Fig. 2).

These specimens are exposed to the cell environment (Na + 2=5% 05).

Materials

The compositions of the two heats of standard Hastelloy N are given

in Table 1. These heats were air melted by Materials Systems Division of

Union Carbide Corporation.

Heat 5085 was used for masking the cylindrical

portion, and heat 5065 was used for the top and bottom heads of the MSRE

vessel. These materials were given a mill anneal of 1 hr at 1177°C and
a final anneal of 2 hr at 900°C at ORNL after fabrication.

The chemical compositions of the two modified alloys are given in

Table 1. The modifications in composition were made principally to

improve the alloy's resistance to radiation damage and to bring about

Both procedures resulted in a very fine grain size (ASTM grain size
7 to 9).

Test Specimens

The surveillance rods inside the core are 62 in. long and those out
side the vessel are 81 in. long. They both are 1/4 in. in diameter with
reduced sections 1/8 in. in diameter by 1 1/8 in. long. After removal
from the reactor, the rods are sawed into small mechanical property
specimens having a gage section 1/8 in. in diameter by 1 1/8 in. long.

The first rods were machined in small segments (approx 11 1/2 in.
long) and welded together. An improvement in this technique has been

made that allows the entire rod to be machined as a unit (see Fig. 3).

A milling machine is used with a cutter ground to the shape of the gage
length, including the radius where the gage length blends into the full
1/4 in. diameter of the rod. The rod is held in position and rotated

. while being fed into the milling cutter. The rod then requires only ‘a

light hand polishing of the gage sections to obtain the desired surface

finish. This procedure is quicker, cheaper, and requires less handling

of the relatively fragile rods than the previous method of making the

rods from segments.

Irradiation Conditions

The irradiation conditions in the core were described in detail
previously.’ These measurements were repeated for the second group of
core specimens and found to be in excellent agreement, The specimens

outside the core are exposed to the cell environment of Nz + 2=-5% 05. ~

. The pertinent temperature and flux data are summarized in Table 2.

Testing Techniques

The laboratory creep-rupture tests were run in conventional creep
machines of the dead-load and lever-arm types. The strain was measured
by a dial indicator that showed the total movement of the specimen and
part of the load train. The zero strain measurement was taken immedi-
ately after the load was applied. The temperature accuracy was +0.75%,
the guaranteed accuracy of ‘the Chromel-P-Alumel thermocouples used.

The postirradiation creep-rupture tests were run in lever-am

‘machines that were located in hot cells, The strain was measured by an

extensometer with rods attached to the upper and lower specimen grips.

The relative movement of. these two rods was measured vy a linear differ-

ential transformer, and the “transformer signal was recorded. The

accuracy of the strain measurements is difficult to determine, The

extensometer (mechanical and electrical portions) produced measurements
that could be read to about +0.02% strain; however, other factors (tem-
perature changes in the cell, mechanical vibrations, etc.) probably
combined to give an overall accuracy of #0. 1% strain. This is consid-
erably better than the specimen-to-specimen reproducibility that one

would expect for relatively brittle materials. The temperature measuring

and control system was the same as. that used in the laboratory with only

“one exception. In the laboratory, the control system was stabilized at

the desired temperature by use of a recorder with an expanded scale. In
the tests in the hot cells, the control point was established by setting
the controller without the aid of the expanded-scale recorder. This error
and the thermocouple accuracy combine to give a temperature uncertainty
of about *1%. |

The tensile tests were run on Instron Universal Testing Machines.
The strain measurements were taken from the crosshead travel.

The test environment was air in all cases. Metallographic exemina-
tion showed that the depth of oxidation was small, and we feel that the

environment did not appreciably influence the test results.

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS
Visual and Metallographic Examination

W. H. Cook was in charge of the disassembly of the surveillance
fixture. Although some difficulties were encountered previously, ® the
design modifications were successful and the ‘assembly was in excellent
mechanical condition when removed. The graphite and Hastelloy N
surfaces were very clean with markings such as numbers and tool marks
very clear. The Hastelloy N was discolored very sligntly. Represen-
tative photographs are ‘shown in Fig. 4,

Small pieces of the modified alloys removed from the core were
examined metallographically. Photomicrographs of heat 21554 (zirconium
modified) are shown in Fig. 5. The bulk material is characterized by a
very fine grain size and small inhomogeneous areas that were found to be
essentially pure molybdenum (probably a result of poor melting practice).

The as-polished sample shows some very slight microstructural changes

- near the surface to a depth of 1 to 2 mils. Similar micrographs are

shown in Fig. 6 for heat 21545 (titanium modified). The grain size of
this material is slightly smaller, but the other features are quite
similar to those observed for heat 21554.

A small piece of the basket that contained the surveillance assembly
was examined metallographically. The basket was made from perforated .
Hastelloy N sheet. The entire surface exposed to the salt is character-
ized by the photomicrographs shown in Fig. 7. Small grains appeared to

be almost dislodged from the surface {Fig. 7(a)]. After etching, a fine

precipitate was revealed near the surface to a depth of 1 to 2 mils.

We examined the material used in fabricating the basket; the microstrue-
ture is shown in Fig. 8. There is some precipitate near the surface,

but not in the quantities observed in Fig. 7. We aged a piece of the
material for 1000 hr at 650°C (basket in MSRE was exposed 5500 hr) and
found that the quantity of precipitate increased (Fig. 9). However,

we were not able to dislodge any grains near the surface even after a

very sharp cold bend.

‘A sample from the basket was sent to N. R. Stalica, Argonne National
Laboratory, for microprobe studies, This investigator found that the

precipitates contained silicon and oxygen in large concentrations and

suggested that they were Si0,. Our studies on the unirradiated specimens

showed that the precipitates are metal-silicon compounds. We are contin-

uing to investigate this point, but presently feel that the precipitates

are probably related to ‘surface contemination of the basket during fabri-

cation. The silicon-rich contaminant should be dissolved during the post-

fabrication anneal (approx 1177° c) given the basket and. subsequently

. precipitate while in. service. at 650°C.

Small pieces of the standard Hastelloy N specimens that had been
exposed to the MSRE cell environment for 11,000 hr were examined. Micro-
structures of heat 5085 are shown in Fig. 10. A thin oxide is present
on the surface and some changes in microstructures occur to a depth of
about 3 mils. The sample examined from heat 5085 was from a welded
region. As shown in Fig. 11, the depth of attack seemed to be some-
what greater, but the reaction layer is very shallow. Neither specimen

showed any evidence of nitrogen absorption from the cell environment.

Mechanical Property Data — Standard Hastelloy N

The postirradiation tensile properties of heat 5065 are summarized
in Table 3. The fracture strains are plotted as a function of test
temperature in Fig, 12. There are significant reductions in the
fracture strain at 25°C and above 500°C. The properties of heat 5085
are given in Table 4. The fracture strains are plotted in Fig. 13 and
are very similar to those noted for heat 5065. The strain at fracture

for both heats is reduced above about 400°C by reducing the strain rate.

Some idea of the rate of property deterioration with fluence can
be obtained by comparing the results for heat 5085 obtained this time
on specimens irradiated outside the vessel to a thermal fluence of
1.3 x 10'® neutrons/em® with those obtained previously® for specimens
removed from the core with a fluence of 1.3 x 102° neutrons /cm?. The
unknown effects on the properties due to different times at temperature
must be recognized; the core specimens for 4800 hr and the vessel

specimens for 11,000 hr. The results are compared in Fig. 14.

At a strain rate of 0.05 min~!, the fracture strain is decreased v/
appreciably as the thermal fluence increased from 1.3 x 10? to
1.3 x 102° neutrons/em®. At a slower strain rate of 0.002 min~!, the v
same trend holds, but the change is much smaller. If this same trend
persists to lower strain rates, the fracture strain in creep tests may

not be influenced significantly by fluence over the small range studied.

 

Our previous studies showed that the tensile properties of materials
irradiated in the MSRE and those irradiated in the ORR and ETR in a |
helium environment were similar, the only significant difference being
the reduction in fracture strain observed? at 25°C. The present results
are in good agreement with this conclusion. Our present studies also -
support previous observations? that the yield stress was unaffected by
irradiation and that the ultimate tensile stress was reduced about 10%
at low temperatures and progressively reduced further above 500°C to a
maximum of 30% at 850°C.

The results of several creep-rupture tests on the standard
Hastelloy N surveillance specimens from the second group are given in

those obtained previously on surveillance specimens from the core. The
results on heat 5085 show clearly that the rupture life is less for the
specimens from the core than for those from outside the vessel. This is

probably due to the thermal fluence of the material from the core being

higher by a factor of about 10. Heat 5085 seems to have the poorest
“rupture life and heat 5081 the best; there is no apparent ‘explanation

for this behavior. The minimum creep rates for these same materials are

higher for the specimens irradiated outside the vessel to a thermal
fluence of 1.3 Xx 10° neutrons/cm? when tested at high strain rates (12
to 300%/hr). At lower strain rates most of the fracture strains are in
the range of 1.5 to 2.5%. Comparison of the results for the two sets of
specimens shows the fracture strains to be slightly lower for the specimens
exposed to the higher fluence in the core. These results do not indicate
the very pronounced ductility minimum at a strain rate of about 0.1%/hr
that is noted for these same materials when irradiated in the ORR. The
very long thermal exposures involved may be responsible for this behavior;
that is, about 5000 hr in the MSRE compared with only 1000 hr in the ORR.
Heat 5081 shows unusually high strains and exhibits the trend of

increasing strain with decreasing strain rate,

Hastelloy N, but the ductility of the zirconium-modified alloy at 760°C
is considerably lower. The strong dependence of fracture strain on
strain rate at 760°C is also quite unusual where the strain is higher
at the lower strain rate. The properties of this material after

irradiation are given in Table 7. The total elongation of the irradiated

material is shown in Fig. 19 as a function of test temperatures. The

behavior is very similar to that shown in Fig, 14, p. 25, for the standard
Hastelloy N exposed under similar conditions; however, the fracture strain

at 600 to 700°C is higher for the modified alloy. The ratios of the

various properties in the irradiated and unirradiated conditions are
shown in Fig. 20. The yield and ultimate strengths were not affected
appreciably by irradiation. The ratio for the elongation at fracture
drops precipitously above: about 600°C for standard Hastelloy N (ref. 10),
but the very low elongation observed for the unirradiated zirconium
modified material at 760°C causes the ratio to be very high at this tem
perature, The behavior of the ratio for the reduction in ares is quite

‘normal with the exception of. “the reduction of this parameter by about 25%

at low temperature.

The tensile properties of the control specimens of heat 21545
(titanium modified) are given in Table 8. The total elongation is shown
in Fig. 21 as a function of the test temperature. The properties are
quite similar to those observed for heat 21554 (Fig. 18, p. 31, and
Table 6, p. 30). The properties of the surveillance specimens are given
in Table 9, and the total elongation at fracture is shown graphically in
Fig. 22. The fracture elongations for this material are quite similar
to those shown in Fig. 19 for heat 21554. The ratio of the irradiated
to the unirradiated property is shown in Fig. 23. Generally the yield
strength is increased slightly by irradiation, and the tensile stress
is decreased. The elongation at fracture is generally decreased, but
decreases precipitously above 600°C. However, the ratio at 760°C is
again high due to the extremely low elongation of the unirradiated
material. ‘The ratio for the reduction in area is reduced about 30% at
low temperatures and decreases rapidly above 600°C.

Several creep-rupture tests have been run on both irradiated and
unirradiated specimens of heats 21554 and 21545. The results of tests
on these materials are given in Table 10 (annealed 100 hr at 871°C),
Table 11 (annealed 100 hr at 871°C and exposed to barren salt for
5500 hr at 650 + 10°C), and Table 12 (annealed 100 hr at 871°C and
exposed to MSRE environment for 5500 hr at 650 + 10°C). The stress-
rupture properties of heat 21554 are compared in Fig. 24 for the various
conditions studied. The strength is reduced slightly by the long thermal
exposure to barren salt. Exposure to the MSRE environment reduces the
rupture life at a given stress by about a factor of 10. The creep rates
of heat 21554 are compared in Fig. 25. The minimum creep rate is
increased slightly by the 5500 hr soak at about 650°C in the barren salt;
the same change is noted for the specimens removed from the MSRE.

The creep-rupture properties of heat 21545 are shown in Fig. 26
for the various conditions studied. Just as noted for the zirconium-
modified alloy in Fig. 24, the rupture life of the titanium-modified
alloy is reduced slightly by the long soak in the barren salt and the
rupture life is reduced by a factor of 10 by exposure to the MSRE
~ environment. The minimum creep rate was not affected significantly by

any of the variables investigated, Fig. 27.

The fracture strains of these materials in the unirradiated state
under creep conditions are excellent, ranging from 30 to 60% (Tables 10
and 11), However, the fracture strains after irradiation are appreciably
less ranging from 1.5 to 4.5% (Table 12). These strains are generally
higher than those obtained from standard Hastelloy N (Fig. 17, p. 29).

Metallographic Examination of Mechanical Property Specimens

Several of the fractured test specimens were examined metallograph-
ically. Typical micrographs from a specimen of heat 5065 exposed to the
cell environment for 11,000 hr and tested at room temperature are shown
in Fig. 28. Figure 28(a) shows the fracture region and demonstrates the
mixed intergranular-transgranular nature of the fracture. The edge of
the gage section is shown in Fig. 28(b). There is very little edge-
cracking or other indications of deleterious reactions with the MSRE
cell environment. Large quantities of fine precipitate that formed
during the long thermal history are also obvious. A higher magnification
photomicrograph made near the surface is shown in Fig. 28(c). Significant
features are the limited surface reaction and the copious quantities of
fine precipitates.

Photomicrographs of a specimen from heat 5065 tested at 650°C are
shown in Fig. 29. The fracture. shown in Fig. 29(a) is completely inter-
granular and typical of materials exhibiting low fracture strains.

The microstructure of a specimen from heat 5065 that was tested in
creep at 650°C and 27,000 psi is illustrated in Fig. 30. Figure 30(a)
shows that the fracture is entirely intergranular with some cracking
‘near the fracture. Figure 30(b) and (c¢) shows the thin reaction layer
at the surface and the large amount of fine precipitate that formed.

Several photomicrographs of the specimen of heat 5085 tested at
25°C are shown in Fig. 31, The gage portion of this specimen contained

a weld and the failure occurred in this region (Fig. 31(a)]. There is
“a very thin region near the surface that shows some modification of

‘microstructure [Fig. 31(b) and (c)]. This layer is quite similar in

appearance to that noted préviouslyll for this material when exposed to
the core enviromment. However, this layer seems to have only minor
effects on the deformation as evidenced by the very limited surface
cracking shown in Fig. 31(c).

The fracture of a specimen from heat 5085 that was tested at 650°C
is shown in Fig. 32. The fracture is completely intergranular and shows
little evidence of plastic deformation. A comparison of Figs. 32 and
31(b) gives an indication of the wide variation in the grain size of

this material.

Photomicrographs of a specimen of heat 5085 that was tested in
creep at 650°C are shown in Fig. 33. The fracture is entirely inter- |
granular with a few cracks near the fracture. The thin reaction layer
near the surface is apparent in Fig. 33(b) and (c).

Both the control and the irradiated specimens from heats 21554 and
21545 were exposed to salt for 5500 hr. The microstructures of these
alloys before stressing were shown in Figs. 5 and 6, pp. 14 and 15. The
microstructure of a specimen from heat 21554 that was tested at 25°C is
shown in Fig. 34. The fracture was predominately transgranular, There
was a layer near the surface of the specimen that showed extensive
intergranular cracking [Fig. 34(b) and (c)]. A typical photomicrograph
of the control sample is shown in Fig. 35. The fracture is a typical
ductile shear type and there is no apprecisble edge cracking.

The microstructure of a specimen of heat 21554 tested at 650°C is
illustrated in Fig. 36. The fracture is intergranular and relatively
brittle in appearance [Fig. 36(a)]. The edge cracking is quite extensive
at this temperature also. The fracture of the control specimen (Fig. 37)
is mixed intergranular-transgranular, There is some edge cracking, but
not at the frequency noted for the irradiated sample [Fig. 36(b)].

At a test temperature of 850°C, the fracture strain for heat 21554
after irradiation was higher than at 650°C. The microstructures shown in
Fig. 38 for the specimen tested at 850°C support this observation. The
fracture is entirely intergranular with extensive intergranular cracking
throughout the sample. The edge cracking is not quite as severe at this
temperature [Fig. 38(b) and (c¢)]. The fracture of the control sample
is shown in Fig. 39. The original grain structure has been fragmented
completely because of the very high mobility of the grain boundaries
at this temperature. |

| The microstructural features of heat 21545 were quite similar to
those for heat 21554, Typical photomicrographs for heat 21545 are shown
in Figs. 40 through 45 for tensile test temperatures of 25, 650, and 850°C.
Significant features are the shear fracture at 25°C in the irradiated

and unirradiated conditions, the extensive edge cracking in the

irradiated material, a completely intergranular fracture of the irradiated
material at 650°C compared with a mixed transgranular and intergranular
fracture in the unirradiated material, and grain boundary migration at a

test temperature of 850°C.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

The standard Hastelloy N used in constructing the MSRE continues ‘to
show excellent compatibility with the fluoride salt environment and the
cell environment consisting of N—2 to 5% 0. ‘There was no evidence of
nitriding, and the depth of oxidation in 11,000 hr was only a few mils.
We knew from previous studies that the mechanical properties of Hastelloy N
would deteriorate due to irradiation demage , 12-17 Our examination of the
first group of surveillance specimens? showed that the property changes
were as-predicted, the only exception being a reduction in the ductility
at 25°C. Extraction replicas showed that extensive carbide precipitation
occurred along the grain boundaries during irradiation at 650°C, and this
probably accounts for the reduction in ductility at 25°C. oe

Our primary purpose in this program is to continually assess the

condition of the MSRE core vessel. The surveillance facility in the core

receives a thermal flux about a factor of 40 higher than that received
by the vessel. The first surveillance specimens removed from the core
received a thermal fluence of 1.3 x 102° neutrons/cm? while being heated
for 4800 hr. The surveillance specimens of standard Hastelloy N removed
with the second group were located outside the core and received a thermal
fluence of 1.3 x 10% neutrons/cm? while being heated for 11,000 hr. The
- latter group should indicate more closely the properties of the vessel,
but a comparison of the properties of both groups is important in trying
to estimate the future properties. The fracture strain in tensile tests
(Fig. 14, p. 25) is reduced even more by the higher fluence. In creep-
rupture tests at 650°C (Fig. 15, p. 27), the rupture life is also slightly
shorter and the strain at fracture (Fig. 17, p. 29) slightly less for the
specimen irradiated to the higher fluence. In the unirradiated condition,
heat 5085 exhibited fracture strains of 20 to 40% in creep-rupture tests
compared with fracture strains of about 2.2 and 1.5% after irradiation to
thermal fluences of 1.3 X 101° neutrons/cm? and 1.3 x 102° neutrons/cm?,
respectively. Thus, even though the properties continue to change
slightly with increasing fluence, the rate of change has decreased
markedly. BN |
~ Another encouraging observation is that the MSRE materials do not
seem to have as low minimum fracture strains after irradiation as we
have noted for the same materials after irradiation to the same fluences
in the ORR (Fig. 17, p. 29). This may be due to the more extensive
carbide precipitation in the materials irradiated in the MSRE for long
periods of time. :
The modified alloys, ‘heats 21554 (zirconium modified) and 21545
(titanium modified), were annealed to produce a.small grain size.
Since these samples were placed in the MSRE, we have found that material
annealed to produce a coarser grain size has better properties after

irradiation, 19 Thus, we were not surprised that the postirradiation

properties of the modified alloys were not much better than those observed
for the standard Hastelloy N. However, two encouraging observations were
"made that demonstrate the absence of embrittling aging reactions: (1) the
mechanical properties of the control specimens exposed to salt for 5500 hr
were only slightly different from those of the as-annealed material

(Figs. 24 and 25, pp. 38 and 41) and (2) the strain at fracture in tensile
tests at 25°C was not reduced by irradiation. The most disturbing obser-
vation is the intergranular cracking near the surface of specimens that
were removed from the reactor. Our measurements?® of the lattice diffusion
of titanium in the modified alloy indicate that the gradients in these
samples should extend to a depth of only about 0.15 mil (based on a
lattice diffusion coefficient of 1 X 101% cm?/sec and 5500 hr exposure

at 650°C). However, titanium can diffuse more rapidly along the grain
boundaries and we can approximate this depth of removal by the Fisher
model.?! Assuming that the grain boundary diffusion rate is 10% times
that for the lattice,?? significant depletion of the titanium should
occur along the grain boundaries to depths of about 4 mils. This is in
reasonable agreement with the depth of the surface cracks observed in the
surveillance specimens (Figs. 34 and 40, pp. 50 and 56). However, the
control specimens (Figs. 35 and 41, pp. 51 and 57) were exposed to static
salt but did exhibit edge cracking when tested. It is possible that
corrosion in the static vessel proceeds more slowly than in the flowing
reactor circuit.-or that the grain boundary cracking may be a result of

the loss or ingress of some element besides titanium.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have examined the second group of surveillance samples removed

from the MSRE. Two rods of standard Hastelloy N were removed from the

surveillance position outside the core after 11,000 hr at temperature
with a thermal fluence of 1.3 x 1019 neutrons/cm?. The compatibility
of the material with the cell environment of nitrogen plus 2 to 5% 0,
seems excellent with no evidence of nitriding and only superficial
oxidation. Mechanical property tests show that the fracture strain at
25°C and above 500°C was reduced markedly by irradiation. Creep-

rupture tests at 650°C show a reduction in rupture life and ductility.

.A comparison with results from the first group of surveillance specimens

exposed to the core environment to a fluence of 1.3 x 102° neutrons /cm?
indicated that the mechanical properties deteriorated only slightly
with increasing fluence.

Two heats of modified Hastelloy N containing 0.5% Ti and O. 5 Zr were
removed from the core with a thermal fluence of 4.1 X 1020 neutrons /cm?.
They had not been annealed to obtain the optimum properties and their
postirradiation mechanical properties were only slightly better than those
observed for the standard alloy. However, these alloys did not seem to

age and their corrosion resistance seems acceptable.
