ABSTRACT

The solubility of PuF; in one NaF-LiF-BeF, mixture, three
NaF-BeF, mixtures and four LiF-BeF, mixtures was determined at
temperatures ranging from about 550 to 650°C. Solubility-
composition diagrams for the binary systems at 565°C show that
in the LiF-BeF, system a minimum solubility of 0.25 mole % PuF,
occurs at about 63 mole % LiF while in the NaF-BeF, system the
minimum solubility of 0.18 mole % PuF, occurs at approximately
57 mole % NaF. In both systems, the solubility increases

rather slowly on adding BeF, to the composition exhibiting

minimum solubility but increases quite rapidly on adding

alkali fluoride to this composition. The highest solubility
observed at 565°C was 1.2 mole % PuF; in the mixture NaF-LiF-
BeF, (56.5-17.5-26 mole %). In fused LiF-BeF,-PuF; mixtures,
the only plutonium species observed with the help of a polar-
izing microscope was PuF; but another compound believed to
have the formula NaPuF, was found in the fused NaF-BeF, -PuF;
mixture containing 64 mole % NaF and in the mixture resulting
from the addition of PuF; to the ternary solvent composition.
No evidence of disproportionation of PuF; was found in the

course of the solubility studies.

SOLUBILITY AND STABILITY OF PuF; IN
FUSED ALKALI FLUORIDE-BERYLLIUM FLUORIDE MIXTURES

INTRODUCTION
An extensive series of studies conducted by W. R. Grimes
and coworkers in the Chemistry Division of Oak Ridge National
Laboratory demonstrated that UF, can be dissolved in a number of
fused fluoride solvents to provide fuel for fused salt reactors.
The feasibility of the circulating fused salt reactor concept
was established by the successful operation of the Aircraft

3

Reactor Experiment.’ The only fissionable species that have

been considered for a fused fluoride burner reactor are v3°F,
235 3 3
and U F; but the possibility of a ThF, -U" °F, fused salt

breeder reactor seems promising.’ Some consideration has also
been given to the use of v?*%cl, or v?3%cl, as the fissionable
material in a fast neutron fused salt reactor.’ Thermodynamic
data’ which indicate that PuF; is more stable than UF; and that

PuF, is much more corrosive than UF, prompted the choice of PuF;

as the plutonium-bearing species for the first experimental
examination of the possibility of using Pu,;, as the fissionable
material in a fused fluoride power reactor (see Appendix A). It
seems reasonable to expect that PuF; will not be more corrosive
than UF, under proposed power reactor conditions but it is
recognized that data to support this belief will not be easy to
obtain. This report gives the results obtained to date of a
preliminary investigation of one aspect of this problem, namely,
the solubility and stability of PuF; in suitable fused salt
solvents. Alkali fluoride-beryllium fluoride systems were used
in these studies since they are the only solvents currently of
interest in the fused salt power reactor program. The studies
included determination of the effect of solvent composition and
temperature on the solubility of Pu¥F;. The effect of addition
of other fluorides on the solubility of PuF3; in fused LiF-BeF,

is being studied and will be reported at a later date.

EXPERIMENTAL

Equipment

Two glove boxes constructed for fused salt studies are
shown in Figures 1 and 2. They are connected by an interchange
chamber and constitute an extension of an inter-connected series
of negative-pressure glove boxes used by personnel of the
Isotopes Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, for handling
plutonium isotopes separated by use of the calutron. The

microscope glove box shown in Figure 1 has plywood back, bottom
and sides while the front and top are made of clear plastic
material for maximum visibility. The eyepiece of a Zeiss polar-
izing microscope protrudes through an opening in the slanting
front of the glove box which is sealed with an airtight bellows
arrangement permitting vertical movement of the eye piece. The
microscope support is constructed of transparent plastic mate-
rial to facilitate observation of ohjects beneath the microscope
which are illuminated with light from a bulb in the base of the
microscope. The microscope glove box is a modification of one
used at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory for microscopic exam-
ination of highly toxic materials. The stainless steel glove
box shown in Figure 2 is a modification of a muffle box built
for plutonium isotope work. Some of the more interesting
features of this glove box are: (1) A heating well consisting

of a 1-1/2" length of 6" I.D. pipe welded around an opening in
the bottom of the box and connected to an 8'" length of 4" I.D.
pipe closed at the bottom. The interior of the well is heated
to a maximum of approximately 800°C by means of a 5" I.D. 2700~-
watt tube furnace mounted on a jack beneath the box so that it
can be lowered to facilitate rapid cooling of the well. The

box is kept cool by water flowing through a copper coil soldered
to the bottom of the box around the well. (2) A discharge chute
consisting of a 12" length of 4" I.D. pipe welded to the right
side of the box at an angle of 60° from the vertical, loosely

sealed on the inside of the box by a sliding door and tightly

used to encase materials removed from the box. This discharge
arrangement is similar to that used on a number of glove boxes
at Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. (3) A small protrusion on
The the front of the box at the left side having a glass top over
tom which a low-power long focal length (9X and 18X) binocular micro-
scope scope and light is mounted for examination of objects inside the
the box. (4) Sodium fluoride traps (not visible in Figure 2) mounted
one inside of the box on the back wall, consisting of two 30" lengths
AT of 3" I.D. copper tubing filled with 1/8" NaF pellets to remove
ve HF from exhaust gases. The first one of the traps connected
1t in series is heated to 100°C by means of a heating coil to pre-
vent caking of the NaF through formation of HF-rich complexes,
ng while the second trap is unheated in order to effect more com-
] plete removal of HF.
in
D. The pressure in the boxes is maintained 1/2 to 1" of water
ted below that of the laboratory by means of an exhaust system.
700- Air filtered through a CWS filter can be alternately supplied
it to the box from the room (50% RH), from an 'Lectrodryer'" (approx-
Lo imately 15% RH) or from a drying tower packed with Drierite
dered (moisture content not determined). Bellows-type valves mounted
chute on a panel below the front face of the box control admission of
ght argon, 95% argon-5% hydrogen mixture, HF, and vacuum to appara-
ly tus within the box. The argon-hydrogen mixture was used to
1y supply a reducing atmosphere over the melts instead of pure

hydrogen because of safety considerations. The gas tanks and
vacuum pump are located outside of the laboratory.
Materials

Plutonium trifluoride used in these studies was high-purity
material supplied by Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory. Solvent
mixtures were purified prior to being introduced into the glove
box by treating fused mixtures with gaseous HF and H, at about
800°C and cooling under an inert atmosphere. The composition of
some of the purified mixtures was modified either by addition of
crystalline BeF, purified by the above-described procedure or by
addition of Harshaw optical grade LiF.
Apparatus

A picture of the filtration apparatus used in this inves=
tigation is shown in Figure 3. This apparatus is a modification
of that used earlier in these laboratories for solubility
determinations, * the main change being a reduction in the diam-
eter of the sample container in order to permit smaller charges
to be used. The copper bellows permit the filter medium to be
kept out of contact with the charge material prior to the actual
filtration in order to minimize clogging of the filter medium.
The apparatus shown in Figure 3 was assembled by heliarc welding
in the Special Services Shop of the Y-12 Plant. An improved

version of the apparatus used for the last few experiments per-

formed was assembled in the Welding and Brazing Facility, ORNL,

 

* Designed by B. H. Clampitt, formerly a member of the
Chemistry Division, Oak Ridge National Laboratory.

by brazing the top part together with gold-nickel alloy in a
hydrogen atmosphere at about 1000°C. This procedure permitted
use of thin-wall tubing for the thermocouple well and also
effected removal of oxide film from the nickel surfaces.

The temperature of the melt surrounding the tip of the
thermocouple well was measured and controlled by means of a
platinum-platinum 10% rhodium thermocouple connected to a Brown
proportional controller. It was recorded on a 300-1000°C
recorder. A portable potentiometer provided an e.m.f. to keep
the recorder on scale while the temperature was below 300°C and
was also used to check the potential of the thermocouple junction.
The recorder and potentiometer readings generally agreed within
2°C. The temperature near the center of the furnace heating
coils was indicated on a Brown Protect-O-Vane controller.

The temperature of the heated NaF trap was measured and
controlled by means of a chromel-alumel thermocouple, in a ther-
_mocouple well extending from the center of one end of the trap
to a point near the middle, connected to a Brown Pyr-O-Vane
controller.

Experimental Procedure

 

The filtration apparatus (Figure 3) was first connected to
the gas tanks and vacuum pump through the manifold system below
the stainless steel glove box (Figure 2) and vacuum tested at
room temperature. After a vacuum of about 50 microns was ob-
tained, the filter stick was removed and charge material con-

Sisting of 5.0 to 5.5 grams of solvent mixture and enough PuFs

 
- 8

to give 6.0 grams total charge was transferred from plastic vials
into the filter apparatus through a long-neck metal funnel. The
ratio of solvent to PuF; was adjusted to provide at least twice
the amount of PuF, that was expected to be dissolved. After the
filter stick was replaced, the filter apparatus was re-connected
and vacuum tested. It was then filled with argon-hydrogen mix-
ture introduced through the filter stick, which was positioned so
that its lower end was close to the fused salt mixture, providing
reducing atmosphere to help keep the plutonium in the trivalent
state. Argon-hydrogen mixture was used in preference to pure
hydrogen because of safety considerations. Gaseous HF was mixed
with the argon-hydrogen mixture before the temperature of the
filter bottle reached 250°C in order to minimize hydrolysis
resulting from adsorbed water on the surface of the fused salt
and PuF; crystals or to reconvert any hydrolysis products to
fluorides.

The filter bottle and contents were held at the desired
filtration temperature * 5°C for two hours with a slow flow of
the mixed gases over the surface of the liquid and then filtra-
tion was effected by applying a vacuum to the filter stick and
argon pressure of 3 to 6 lbs to the surface of the liquid while
the bellows was compressed to bring the filter stick into con-
tact with the liquid for a period of 5 to 10 minutes. The

filtrate and residue were allowed to cool slowly to room temper-

ature in an argon atmosphere. The filter stick was then removed

A variation of the above-described procedure was used in
vlent
filtration experiments with one solvent (71.3 LiF-28.7 BeF,).
ire
Flexible hose connections were placed in the three gas lines
mixed
leading to the filtration apparatus. This permitted the filter

bottle to be withdrawn from the furnace at the conclusion of the

filtration period while argon gas was still being pulled through

  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  

the filter stick, causing the filter bottle and contents to cool
quite rapidly (approximately 100° per minute between 600 and
300°C). This procedure eliminated any possibility of a portion
of the filtrate running through the filter medium during the
cooling period and it had the advantage of making the filtrate
available for examination at room temperature about 30 minutes
after the end of the filtration. It was also possible with this
arrangement to agitate the contents of the filter bottle by
moving the apparatus up and down. The principal disadvantages
are the hazards associated with the handling of hot objects in

the glove box and the extremely small crystal size of the

rapidly cooled mixtures which makes microscopic identification
of crystals difficult.
Results

Table I gives the composition of solvent mixtures which
were analyzed chemically. The first column shows the nominal or
intended composition of the mixtures while the last column shows
the composition calculated from analytical data. The composi-
tion of solvent mixtures not included in Table I was calculated.

Solubility data obtained with LiF-BeF, mixtures are given
in Table II; NaF-BeF, solubility data are contained in Table III;
and the solubility of PuF; in one NaF-LiF-BeF, mixture is shown
in Table IV. The data are shown graphically in Figures 4 and 5,
omitting doubtful results, as a plot of the log of the molar
concentration of PuF; versus 1/T (°K). Figure 6 shows solubility
data at three temperatures as a function of solvent composition
for LiF-BeF, mixtures while Figure 7 shows a similar plot for
NaF-BeF, compositions. The data obtained with the ternary mix-
ture (Table IV) were used to extend the data in Figure 7 by
considering 56.5% NaF and 17.5% LiF as equivalent to 74 mole %
NaF. A comparison of the two systems, using interpolated solu-
bility values at 565°C is shown in Figure 8, again using data on
the ternary system to extend the NaF-BeF, curve.

Dissolved portions of seven samples were examined spectro-

photometrically for Put* content. No Pu™ was detected in any

of the samples. The limit of detection varied from 0.2 to 3.0%,

ending upon the plutonium concentration in the samples and the
of the sample analyzed. Since these results, coupled with
careful examination of each sample by means of the petrographic
erosCope, demonstrated that all of the plutonium in these

mples was in the trivalent form, other samples were analyzed
emically only for total plutonium content but microscopic
xamination of the samples continued. A summary of the petro-
phic observations made by R. A. Strehlow is contained in
pendix B.

Since Putt produced by disproportionation of PuF3; could

ave been reduced by hydrogen in the atmosphere above the melt

by the nickel walls of the container, it seemed advisable to
look for other evidence of the absence of disproportionation of
PuF,. In similar studies with UF;-containing melts, U metal
esulting from disproportionation of UF; was found to have alloy-
2d with the container wall. In order to determine whether a
imilar alloying effect occurred when PuF;-containing melts

were in contact with nickel, the bottom section of two welded
nickel filter bottles (Figure 3) that had been in contact with
such melts were scraped as clean as possible and analyzed for

total plutonium content. One sample had contacted a mixture of

 

NaF, BeF, and PuF; at 600°C for two hours while the other had
contacted a similar mixture at temperatures varying from 550 to
6500C for approximately eight hours. The plutonium found in the

two samples, amounting to 0.05 and 0.17 mg respectively, could

 

 

 

 

 

 

 
 

 

 

be accounted for by the trace of fused salt remaining on the
nickel. No evidence of disproportionation of PuF; in fused
alkali fluoride-beryllium fluoride melts under the conditions
maintained in these solubility studies has been observed to date
Discussion

Straight lines correlate the data in Figures 4 and 5 with-
in the limits of reproducibility of the results. Changes in
composition of the solvent mixtures seem to have little effect
on the slope of the lines. It appears, therefore, that the heat
of solution of PuF; in these solvents is essentially constant
for the temperature and composition ranges studied.

The solubility-composition plots, Figures 6, 7, and 8,
show that the solubility of PuF; in the melts goes through a
minimum with a sharp increase on the alkali fluoride side and a
gradual increase on the BeF, side of the minimum. This result
is not unexpected since the BeF,-PuF; eutectic probably contains
a very low concentration of PuF; while the alkali fluoride-PuF;
eutectics almost certainly contain a much higher PuF; concentra-
tion,

Inspection of Figure 8 and the phase diagrams of the binary

systems LiF-BeF, > and NaF-BeF, ° shows that a higher solubility

of PuF, at 565°C can be achieved in the LiF-BeF, system than in
the NaF-BeF, system for solvent mixtures having the same liquidus
temperature. For example, the LiF-BeF, mixture containing 69
mole % LiF which is liquid at 520°C, will dissolve about 0.50
mole % of PuF; at 565° while the comparable NaF-BeF, mixture
melting at 520°C contains 62.5 mole % NaF and will hold 0.26
mole % PuF, in solution at 565°. If much more than 0.5 mole %
PuF; is needed for a circulating fuel reactor having a minimum
temperature of 565°, it may be necessary to resort to a ternary
solvent in order to keep the liquidus temperature of the soclvent
at an acceptably low figure.

Approximation 25% of the filtration data recorded in
Tables II, III, and IV (those results marked with asterisks)
were excluded from Figures 4 and 5 and some of the points in
these graphs do not lie very close to the lines. This scatter
of data reflects to some extent the difficulty in obtaining
equilibrium data with small amounts of fused salts. It was
desirable to use small amounts of materials for these experi-
ments because of neutron production in plutonium-beryllium
fluoride melts. However, an analysis of factors having a pos-
sible influence on the results may be of help in evaluating the
data. Low results could be due to failure to saturate the
solvent because of inadequate equilibration time, absence of a
means of agitation (see page 9), or lack of a sufficient amount
of PuF; in the mixture. There are two fairly obvious explana-

tions of high results. A temperature gradient is known to

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

exist in the heated zone occupied by the filter bottle during
filtration experiments, with the temperature decreasing in going
from the bottom to the top of the chamber. If the thermocouple
junction was above the surface of the liquid in the filter
bottle, the temperature indicated by the thermocouple was prob-
ably lower than that of the liquid. Some of the filter bottles
used in these studies had thermocouple wells too short to reach
the surface of the liquid and it is also possible that errors in
the determination of the temperature of the melts resulted from
the thermocouple being inadvertently pulled part way out of the
thermocouple well. The other possibility is that a portion of
the solvent or a low-melting ternary eutectic having a lower
plutonium content than that of the original filtrate ran back
through the filter after partial solidification of the filtrate
occurred. (See Experimental Procedure, p. 7)

Confidence in plutonium values reported by the analytical
laboratory was strengthened by having a number of samples
reanalyzed under different sample designations. The results,
shown in Appendix C, indicate that satisfactory reproducibility
was obtained although the differences for some samples were
greater than expected from the precision of the potentiometric
plutonium determination. It is possible that some of the early
samples which were ground but not sieved were not entirely homo-

geneous.

Optical Properties of Fluoride Mixtures Containing PuF,
Petrographic examinations were carried out on filtrates
and residues obtained in the study with a principal objective of
identifying the plutonium containing phase. All of the slide

preparations for the work were made in a glove-port plexi=-
glas box (Figure 1) in which was mounted a polarizing micro=
scope. The optical character of the various plutonium
compounds permitted distinction to be made from the crystals
of the various solidified solvents. The solvents generally

contained one or more of the compounds: Li,BeF, ,' Na,BeF, ,

NaBeF, , LiBeF, © and BeF, I. All of these compounds have
refractive indices of less than 1.4.

Inasmuch as the plutonium’ phases had much higher re-
fractive indices an initial observation was made of the growth
form of all phases of higher index by examining the crushed
specimen in an oil with a refractive index of about 1.35.
Under these conditions all phases of appreciably higher index
appear quite heavily bordered and are easily located in the

microscope field. Observation of the color and birefringence

of the phase indicated which of the possible compounds con-

taining plutonium was present: Pu(III) fluorides are blue

and Pu(IV) fluorides tan. (No PuF, was observed in the fil-
trates or residues in this study.) The maximum birefringence
of PuF; observed in this study is about 0.003, The inter-
ference color (observed with crossed polarizing discs) is
approximately that of the crystal observed in "white" light,
pale blue. The compound NaPuF, appears reddish blue and has

a maximum birefringence of about 0.02. The optical properties
of these compounds are compared in Table B-1 with those of some
Ce*3, U*3, and Ut4 compounds.

The Pu(III) ion is about the same size as the Ce(III)
and U(III) ions and differs from them in its polarizability
which is, of course, shown by the differences in refractive
indices.

The most common growth form of PuF, as crystallized from
the solvents used in the study was that of thin sheets which
could be observed with their maximum birefringence only when
they existed as platy inclusions in the solvent crystals.
Under these conditions they exhibited their maximum bire=-
fringence and parallel extinction. No compound was found
which could be considered a LiF-PuF, binary compound in LiF-
BeF,~PuF,; melts and no change in the refractive index of PuF,
was seen which would indicate solid solution of LiF in the

PuF,.

The growth form of the PuF, is strongly dependent on the

A sample prepared by mixing LiF-NaF-PuF; (50-33.3-16.7
mole %) was examined petrographically after fusing. A large

amount of a plutonium containing phase, LiF crystals, and

     
 

NaF-LiF eutectic aggregates were observed. Since the plutonium
compound was found only in mixtures containing sodium fluoride
and since the optical properties were similar to those for the
known compounds NaCeF, and NaUF,, this plutonium compound was
designated as NaPuF,.

It is interesting to note that NaPuF, was observed as the
sole plutonium containing phase in the filtrate from the mixture
NaF-LiF-BeF, (56.5-17.5-26 mole %). Some NaPuF, was seen in the
residue from the mixture containing 64 mole % NaF but not in
the filtrate. This indicates that the isotherms as shown in

Figure 7 probably cross the NaPuF,-PuF; primary phase field

NaF per mole BeF,. PuF; was observed in both filtrates and
residues of other NaF content.

A comparison was made of transmission spectra by means
of a Leitz pupillary spectroscope. The principal difference
between NaPuF, and PuF; is an absorption band between 6500 2
and 6650 A for PuF,; which exists at 6660 A to 6800 & for
NaPuF,. For the PuF, there is also more transmission between
5200 R and 6000 2 which presumably accounts for the difference

in color between NaPuF, and PuF;.
