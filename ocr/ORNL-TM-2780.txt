Abstract

A stand is required to test the salt pumps for the Molten Salt Breeder
Experiment (MSBE). It will be designed to accommodate pumps having capac-
ities up to 8000 gpm and operating with salts of specific gravities to 3.5
at discharge pressures to 400 psig and temperatures to 1300°F normally and
to 1400°F for short periods of time. Both the drive motor electrical supply
and the heat removal system external to the loop will be designed for 1500
hp heat removal capability. Preventive measures to protect personnel and
equipment from the deleterious effects of a salt leak will be taken.

The primary and secondary salt pumps for the MSBE will be operated
in the stand using a depleted uranium, natural lithium fluoride salt to
simulate the MSBE primary salt. A prototype primary salt pump, procured
from the U.S. pump industry, will be subjected, at representative operating
conditions, to performance and endurance testing of its hydraulic, mechan-
ical, and electrical design features. The MSBE and Engineering Test Unit
(ETU) salt pump rotary elements, mounted in the prototype pump tank, will
be subjected to hot shakedown testing in the stand to provide final con-
firmation of high temperature performance and construction and assembly
quality prior to installaticn in the reactor system. As they become avail-
able the xenon-removal device and molten salt instrumentation to measure
pressure, flow, liquid level, etc., may be tested at design conditions in
molten salt and the stand will be modified, as required, to accommodate
these tests if they do not interfere with the pump program.

The preliminary system design description and the Title TI design cal-
culations of the test stand are presented. Descriptions, functions, and
design requirements for components and subsystems are provided. The prin-
ciples of operation of the test stand, the safety precautions, and the
maintenance philosophy are discussed. The quality assurance program plan
is being prepared.

1.0 Introduction

1.1 System Function

Reliable salt pumps are necessary to the satisfactory operation of
the Molten Salt Breeder Experiment (MSBE), and efforts to obtain them will
include operating the salt pump with molten salt in a test stand to prove
performance and endurance characteristics.

The salt pump test stand will be utilized to provide design evalua-
tion and endurance testing in molten salt of a prototype primary fuel salt
pump for the MSBE and to prooftest the rotary elements of the primary and
secondary salt pumps for the Engineering Test Unit (ETU) and the MSBE.

The salt flow and head can be varied over the desired ranges by adjusting
the throttling valve in the salt circulating system and by adjusting the
pump speed.

We presently envision that the hydraulic designs of the primary and
secondary salt pumps will be very similar with the secondary pump operat-
ing at a higher speed. Hydraulic requirements of the primary and secon-
dary salt systems support this approach. In addition, the use of similar
hydraulic designs permits the developmental testing of both salt pumps
in this single test stand with one test salt. The salt pumps will be
obtained from the United States pump industry and the prototype pump and
the rotary elements for ETU and MSBE pumps will be installed into the test
stand in sequence. The design and procurement of these pumps and their
drive motors and auxiliary equipment are not parts of this salt pump test
stand activity, but all these activities will be coordinated.

The primary salt pump is expected to be located at the reactor core
outlet in the MSBE and thus will operate in the highest temperature salt
in the primary salt system, which is approximately 1300°F. The secondary
salt pump will be located at the outlet of the intermediate heat exchanger
and thus will operate in the highest temperature in the secondary salt
system, which is approximately 1150°F. The primary salt pump tank will
be located in a high temperature containment cell, which will alsc enclose
the primary system, and will be subjected to a high ambient temperature,
estimated to be 1100°F. In addition, it will be subjected to intense

nuclear radiation from components in the primary system, the circulating
primary salt in the pump tank, and from gas-borne fission products in the
pump tank gas space.

The prototype MSBE primary salt pump will be operated in the test
stand with molten salt over the full range of MSBE conditions of tempera-
ture, pressure, flow, and speed to prove the hydraulic, mechanical, struc-
tural, and thermal designs of the pump and to provide cavitation inception
characteristics at design and off-design operating conditions. However,
no attempt will be made to simulate all features of the high-temperature
containment cell or to impose nuclear radiation on components in the test
stand.

Rotary elements of the primary and secondary salt pumps for the ETU
and the MSBE will be subjected to high temperature, non-nuclear prooftests
in the test stand with molten salt prior to installation into their respec-
tive systems. At other times the stand will be used to subject the proto-
type pump to endurance operation with molten salt. It is important to the
MSBE program to demonstrate that the pump has the capability for uninter-
rupted operation with molten salt for periods of one year or longer. Sub-
sequently, the stand will be used to study unanticipated problems that may
arise during the operation of the ETU and the MSBE. The proposed test
program is discussed in Section 3.2.

It is expected that the loop will be modified after initial pump tests

to test gas injection and gas stripping devices as they are developed.

1.2 Summary Description of the System

 

1.2.1 Salt Circulating System

 

The salt circulating system consists of the salt pump being tested,
a throttling valve, two salt-to-air heat exchangers, a flow restrictor,
a Venturi tube, and the interconnecting piping. It provides a closed
piping loop for the molten salt from the pump discharge to the pump suction.
A salt storage tank is provided to contain the quantity of salt necessary
to fill the circulating system. It is connected to the circulating system
by a pipe containing a freeze valve. All salt containing components will
be constructed of nickel-molybdenum-chromium (Ni-Mo-Cr) alloy. Electric
heaters capable of heating the salt system to 1300°F will be provided.

Thermal insulation will be installed on the system as appropriate.
1.2.2 Structure
The salt piping, salt storage tank, and the test pump are supported

in a structure designed to provide containment in case of a rupture.

1.2.3 Heat Removal System

The heat removal system consists of two salt-to-air concentric pipe
heat exchangers, two positive displacement air blowers, an exhaust stack,

interconnecting ducting, controls,and noise abatement equipment.

1.2.4 Utility Systems

Necessary utility systems will be installed. An inert cover gas
system is needed to protect the salt from contact with moisture and oxi-
dizing atmospheres and, if needed, to suppress pump cavitation. Instrument
air will be used to cool the freeze valve and to operate instruments.

A 2400 volt electrical distribution system will be installed to connect
the existing electrical supply in the building to the salt pump drive motor.
The existing 480 volt system will be used to supply power to the heaters,
blower motors, and auxiliary equipment. The emergency power system in
Building 9201-3 will be used to supply certain functions when normal elec-
trical power is lost.

Cooling water will be used for heat removal from the drive motor,

the lubrication system, and the shield plug coolant system.

1.2.5 Instrumentation and Controls

 

The instrumentation and controls required to monitor and regulate
such test parameters as salt flow, temperatures, pressures, and liquid
level will be supplied. Salt flow will be regulated with a throttling
valve and measured with a Venturi tube. Temperatures will be measured
with stainless steel sheathed chromel-alumel thermocouples. NaK-sealed
high-temperature transmitters will be used to measure circulating salt
pressures. Salt level in the storage tank will be determined by four on-
off probes inserted at different levels in the tank.

The Beckman DEXTIR data acquisition system, presently in use for
collecting data in Building 9201-3, will be used to log the more important
salt temperatures, pressures, and flows and pump power and speed.

Other test stand temperatures, pressures, flows, and powers will be

monitored and controlled with conventional equipment.
1.2.6 Hazards

The hazards associated with the operation of the stand are chemical
toxicity, radioactivity, and high temperature. To protect personnel from
these hazards, the loop will be completely surrounded by a sheet metal
containment subject to controlled ventilation. Access to the containment

will be rigidly controlled through the use of written procedures.

1.3 System Design Requirements

 

Criteria have been established to obtain a test stand that will pro-
vide maximum performance and endurance information for the MSBE salt pumps

in a safe and economical manner. The criteria include:

1.3.1 Tunction

The pump test stand will be designed to (1) accommodate full-size
salt pumps for the MSBE primary or secondary systems, (2) provide a non-
nuclear test environment, (3) yield performance and endurance data to
assure satisfactory performance and reliability of the pumps and their
auxiliary systems in the MSBE, and (4) provide adequate personnel pro-
tection from all hazards. All components external to the salt loop will
be designed to accommodate pumps, up to 1500 hp, for the first prototypes

of molten salt reactor power plants.

1.3.2 Pump Size
The salt loop of the test stand will be designed specifically for

testing the pumps required for an MSBE with powers as high as 200 Mw(t)
and with a single loop. The pump design requirements for this power level
are shown in Table 1. The primary salt pump will be operated over the
head, flow, and speed range shown in Fig. 1. The head and flow require-
ments for the secondary salt pump permit the use of the same hydraulic
configuration as that of the primary salt pump but with a higher impeller

speed and possible minor changes in the impeller diameter.

1.3.3 Allowable Stress for Ni-Mo-Cr Alloy

 

The allowable design stresses for high temperature operation of the
Ni-Mo-Cr alloy will be those permitted in Case 1315-3 of the Interpretations
of ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code.

1.3.4 Instrumentation and Controls

 

Instrumentation and contrcls will be provided to monitor test stand
operation, to maintain test parameters within prescribed ranges, and to
obtain required pump test data. A control area will be provided from

which safe operation of the test stand can be maintained.

1.3.5 Engineered Safety Features

 

Engineered safety features will be provided. As a minimum, they will
be designed to cope with any unobstructed discharge from a large break in
the pressure boundary, resulting in all the salt in the loop being dis-
charged into the enclosure. The containment design basis is to contain
the pressure and temperature resulting from an accident without exceeding
the design salt vapor lezkage rate for the test stand enclosure. Appro-
priate features will be provided to protect personnel in case of an acci-
dental rupture.

An independent emergency power system is available, designed with
adequate capacity and testability to insure the functioning of all engi-
neered safety features.

Procedures will be prepared for controlled access to the enclosure.

1.3.6 Control of Effluents

 

The design of the test stand will provide the means necessary to pro-
tect personnel from toxic and radicactive effluents, whether gaseous,
liquid, or solid. A low level radioactivity is associated with Ra8y,
R32Th , and their progeny in the test salt. Control will be maintained
during normal operation and accident conditions to preclude the release
of unsafe amounts of these effluents and to protect personnel performing

maintenance.
1.3.7 Quality Standards and Assurance

A quality assurance program is being written and will be implemented
to enhance the certainty of achieving the pump-test objectives. Systems
and components that are essential to prevent accidents that could affect
personnel safety or to mitigate their consequences will be identified and
designed, fabricated, and erected to quality standards that reflect their
safety importance. Where generally recognized codes or standards on design,
materials, fabrication, and inspection are used, they will be identified.
Where adherence to such codes or standards does not assure a quality level
necessary to the safety function, they will be supplemented or modified,

as necessary.

1.3.8 Test Stand Parameters

 

Table 2 presents the MSBE design parameters which affect salt pump
design. The principal hydraulic and thermal design requirements for the
salt pumps, based on these MSBE design parameters, have been shown in
Table 1. The principal design requirements for the salt pump test stand,
as deduced from the MSBE requirements, are shown in Table 3. However, to
provide for the testing of larger pumps in the future, all components ex-
ternal to the salt loop will be designed for testing pumps up to 1500 hp.
This will include all air handling systems, the electrical supply system,
and auxiliary and motor cooling systems.

Assuming that future reactor systems have thermal and hydraulic char-
acteristics similar to the MSBE, these components will be sufficient for
testing pumps of larger molten salt reactor systems up to about 250 Mw(t)
per loop, or about 1000 Mw(t) for a 4 loop reactor system.

1.3.9 Thermal Transients

Preliminary analysis of the MSBE systems indicates that the plant
can be designed to operate without large fast temperature transients.
If analysis of the detailed design indicates that transients outside the
capability of the test stand are likely to be experienced, the test stand
could be modified or thermal transient tests could be performed in other

facilities, such as those being constructed at the Liquid Metals Engineer-

ing Center.

1.3.10 Codes and Standards

Section 6.0 outlines the codes, standards, specifications, procedures,
reviews and inspections, and the quality assurance program that will be
used to design, construct, and operate the test stand. The design of the
salt containing system will be based on Section III, Nuclear Vessels,
(Class C Vessels), of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code and on the
Code for Pressure Piping ANSI B31.1l. Approved RDT Standards will be used

for all systems and subsystems as applicable and available.
2.0 Detailed Description of System

The test stand consists principally of salt piping, a heat removal
system, utility systems, and instrumentation and controls which are de-

scribed below. The salt pump is described also.

2.1 Salt Pump

The salt pump includes its drive motor and controls and its auxiliary
lubricating and cooling systems. In the conceptual configuration, Fig. 2,
the salt pump 1s a vertical, single stage, centrifugal sump pump with an
in-line electric drive motor. This vertical pump configuration has been
used satisfactorily to pump molten salt in many component test stands,
and also in the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (ARE) and the Molten Salt
Reactor Experiment (MSRE). It is expected that the MSBE pumps will have
a similar configuration but will be larger in size. The primary salt pump
will be designed for service with highly radioactive, high temperature,
fissionable and fertile, molten salt. The secondary salt pump will be
designed for service at high temperature with a molten salt. The tenta-
tive design conditions for the MSBE primary and secondary salt pumps are
given in Table 1.

The specified design conditions for the MSBE primary and secondary
pumps are such that the same impeller and casing design can be used for
both pumps with the secondary pump operating at a higher speed. Fig. 3
shows the design points for the two pumps and the actual head-flow curves
for a pump operating at 880 rpm and the same pump with a 1% reduction in
the impeller diameter at 1180 rpm. From the brake horsepower curves of
the two pumps, see Fig. 3, it appears that the same rotary element design
could alsc be used for both pumps.

The design and procurement of the salt pumps and associated variable
speed drive motors are not part of this pump test stand activity. Their
procurement from the U.S. pump industry is directed and funded in another
portion of the MSBE program. This procurement activity will be closely

coordinated with the design, fabrication, and operation of the test stand.

2.2 Salt System

2.2.1 Function

The salt circulating system provides a closed piping loop for the
molten salt from the pump discharge to the pump suction and is shown in
a preliminary layout in Fig. 4. It also provides the thermal and hydraulic
characteristics for subjecting the pump to a range of specified test con-
ditions. A tank to store salt while the pump is inoperative and equipment
to transfer salt between the storage tank and the circulating system are

provided.

2.2.2 Descriptions
2.2.2.1 Salt Piping. The pumped salt leaves the discharge nozzle

of the pump and enters the piping which contains a fixed restrictor and
a variable restrictor (throttling valve, HCV-100).¥% The salt passes
through these restrictors, two concentric pipe salt-to-air heat exchangers
(HX-1 and 2), a Venturi tube (FE-100) for measuring flow, and simulated
reactor outlet piping before returning to the pump at the suction nozzle.
The pressure levels in the salt circulating system are established
by the head developed by the salt pump and the cover gas pressure in the
pump tank. Relatively small friction pressure drops will occur in the
piping loop, and relatively large pressure drops will occur in the salt
throttling valve, the flow nozzle, and the fixed restrictors. The piping
pressure profile for three primary salt flow rates is given in Fig. 5.
For a given speed the throttling valve can be used to change the flow
from approximately 50% to 125% of the flow obtained when the system re-
sistance curve passes thru the design point for the primary salt pump.
The pump will be operated from 10% to 110% of the design speed. Thus the
primary salt pump will be operated over a head-flow-speed regime approxi-
mately as shown in Fig. 1. The salt pump will be operated from the high
to the low limits of flow and speed to obtain pump data at design and off-

design conditions.

 

*
Component designations, e.g., HCV-100, are presented in the Instru-
ment and Piping Schematic Diesgram, Appendix E.

A pipe diameter of 8 in. was selected for the circulating salt loop
as the result of studies requiring (1) a’ salt velocity in. the pipe greater
than that anticipated in the MSEE, (2) minimization of salt inventory, and

(3) satisfactory heat transfer in the salt-to-air heat removal system. .
The Venturi tube is located where the seals of its attached pressure trans-
mitters will not be exposed to subatmospheric pressures when the pump is
cavitating in the high flow ranges. Also the Venturi pressures should

‘not be so high as to degrade the accuracy of the pressure measuring devices.
The chosen location meets these requirements and also provides the recom-

mended straight sections of pipe preceding and following the Venturi tube.

Location of the throttling valve close to the pump discharge provides a
lower pressure downstream from the valve to permit the use of thinner wall
pipe for the major portion of the salt piping. oo

The throttling valve will be a manually operated valve very similar
to one that was developed. several years ago for molten salt use at Oak
Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL). One of these valves (3 1/2 in. size).
is presently in use in a ‘molten salt test stand at ORNL, and it has been

‘operated more. than 40, 000 hr. Four other valves have operated from 10, 000

to 25,000 hr. The valve design will be Mscaled-up" to an 8 in. size as

‘shown in the preliminary layout in Fig. 6. Except for the inlet nozzle

the valve body will be subjected only to the valve outlet pressure of
about 250 psig -(max.). The design conditions will be 300 psig at 1300°F.
The valve consists of slotted concentric cylinders that will have the
minimum AP when the slots are aligned and the maximum AP when the slots
are fully misaligned due to the axial displacement of the. inner cylinder.
~The valve stem is sealed with a bellows that is pressure balanced with

inert gas.

2. 2. 2. 2 Salt Storage Tank and Transfer Line. The salt storage tank
will be designed to contain the quantity of salt required to fill the pump
tank, all the piping in the circulating system, the transfer line and pro-
vide a substantial gas volume. The salt in the tank can be in liquid or
solid form. The tank will be equipped with electric heaters capable of
heating the tank and contents to 1200°F. The tank, which is tentatively
sized 40 in. in diam by 10 ft long, (vol = 78 cu.ft) will contain the

the tank of 1 cu ft. A preliminary analysis indicates that for a design
temperature of 1200°F and design pressure of 100 psig, & tank wall thick-
ness of 1/2 in. will suffice for the cylindrical portion of the tank and
5/8 in. will suffice for the torispherical heads. A preliminary drawing
of the salt storage tank is shown in Fig. To g

The salt transfer line connecting the salt storage tank to the circu-

will be used to establish a plug of solid salt in the drain line and thus
maintain the appropriate salt inventory in the salt system. Auxiliary -

heating will be applied, when required, to melt the frozen salt plug and
permit molten salt to flow through the transfer line from the salt piping

Based on experience at the MSRE, it is ‘estimated that the freeze valve

be drained by gravity in 45 to T0 minutes.

2.2. 2. 3 Salt Selection. It is planned 1 to operate. the rotary elements
of both the primary and secondary ‘salt pumps in the test stand using a
single salt identical to the reactor primary salt, except that depleted

used. The cost of the test salt is significantly less than that of the
reactor primary salt, and the chemical and physical properties of both
salts are identical. Chemical composition and physical properties of the
primary and seeondizy salts are given in Tables 4 and 5. |

The head and £1ow requirements for the primary and secondary salt
pumps are such that the same hydraulic design (impeller and casing) can’
be used for both pumps with the secondary pump running at a higher speed
and with minor changes in the impeller diameter. If the secondary pump

were to be run at its design speed in the primary salt, the power and the

with a diameter about 84% of the design diameter and operating at secon-
dary pump design speed with a flow of TO00 - T7500 gpm the design power

and pressure rise would be obtained as shown in Fig. 8 (see Appendix G-VII).
By operating a secondary pump with a full size impeller at primary salt
pump speed and a flow of 5500-6000 gpm, the impeller itself would be sub-
jected to design torques.

The cavitation inception of the secondary pump with the secondary
salt can be predicted with assurance from the water tests to be performed
by the pump manufacturer and from the salt tests with the primary pump.

The effects of differences in viscosity between water, primary salt,
and secondary salt are very small for pumps with Reynolds numbers greater
than 2 x 108%. The Reynolds numbers for the MSBE pumps are greater than
107 whether pumping water or salt.

There are certain minor hazards associated with the use of the simu-
lated primary salt. Of primary concern is the toxicity of the beryllium
during routine maintenance of the pump and in the event of a leak in the
loop. Other components of the salt are less toxic than the beryllium.
There is also a radiation hazard primarily due to a relatively soft gamma
emitted by the thorium and its decay products. We estimate the dosage
rate to be about 10-15 mrem/hr at the surface of the storage tank when
all the salt is in the tank. In case of a leak there will also be some
alpha and beta emission. The company industrial hygienists and health
physicists propose that the containment be operated at a slight negative
pressure and provided with filtration of the effluent. This proposal
will be incorporated into the design. Operation and maintenance procedures
will be prepared in consultation with them.

If it were desired to test the secondary pump with secondary (sodium
fluorcborate) salt in the loop, the primary salt would be replaced with
a flush charge of secondary salt. The flush charge would be pressurized
into the loop and the pump operated for a short time. After draining
the flush charge into the storage tank, it would be replaced with the

operating charge of sodium fluoroborate.

2.2.2.4 Material for Construction. Design of the salt-containing

 

piping and all salt wetted parts is based on the use of the Ni-Cr-Mo alloy
that was used to construct the salt system in the MSRE and that is the
base material for the MSBE. The composition and properties of this alloy

are given in Table 6.

2.2.2.5 Electric Heaters. Electric heaters, capable of heating the
salt storage tank to 12C0°F and all other salt-containing piping and equip-
ment to 1300°F, will be provided. Additional electric heaters will be pro-
vided on the main loop piping and heat exchangers to be used during thermal
transient tests. The heaters will be 115 v and 230 v tubular type and
ceramic heaters. In general, the heaters will be operated at approximately
50% of their rated wattage.

Manually operated variable voltage circuits will be provided to con-
trol the power to the preheat heaters. "Off-on" type manual control is
proposed for the thermal transient test heaters, Sec. 3.4; however, a
study will be made to determine conformance with heat transfer and stress
conditions.

Ammeters will be provided for measuring the current in each heater
circuit. Operation of the heaters will be monitored by temperatures

obtained from thermocouples mounted on the surface of all heated components.

2.2.2.6 Support Structure and Stand Enclosure. The salt piping and

 

test pump are supported in a steel structure, also designed to provide
containment in case of a salt spill. A preliminary layout of the support
frame is shown in Fig. 9. The top, sides, and bottom of the structural
steel framework are lined with sheet metal panels for containment. Most

of the panels are welded in place but some of them are screwed and gasketed
to provide maintenance access. There are steel access doors at both ends
of the structure. Three protected windows are installed for inspection
purposes and the interior of the enclosure will have floodlights. An
exhaust blower is attached to the enclosure to provide a negative pressure
of sufficient magnitude to give air velocities of 150-200 fpm through all
openings in the enclosure. All openings, such as the valve access, exhaust
blower duct, etc., have either baffles or bellows seals to prevent the

egress of salt in case of a spraying leak.

2.3 Heat Removal System

2.3.1 Function

The power supplied by the pump to the circulating salt is dissipated
in heating the salt. The function of the heat removal system is to remove
from the circulating salt that portion of this heat necessary to maintain

the desired operating temperatures of the salt system.

2.3.2 Descriptions
Without heat removal the maximum pumping power of 1200 hp for the

primary salt pump would raise the temperature of the circulating salt
12°F /min and 26°F/min for system salt volumes of 65 cu ft and 30 cu ft,
respectively. During the conceptual design phase, several different heat
removal systems, were investigated to provide a tolerable noise level,
reasonable physical size, safety, economical and simple construction and
operation, and minimum maintenance. Systems investigated included (1)
thermal convection salt-to-air radiator, (2) forced circulation salt-to-
air radiator, (3) salt-to-steam heat exchanger, and (4) forced convection
salt-to-air heat exchanger with and without water mist. The last method

without water mist was the most suitable and was chosen for the design.

2.3.2.1 Heat Exchangers. A preliminary design was prepared for

the heat exchangers subject to the following design conditions or limi-

tations:
Salt flow rate 8000 gpm
Pump power 1200 hp
Salt temperature 1050°F and 1300°F
Salt pipe size 8 in. (Sch. 40)
Maximum air velocity 900 fps
Air inlet temperature 150°F
Air flow rate, total 10,000 cfm
Maximum air side AP 3 psi
Number of heat exchangers 2

Two separate, identical heat exchangers (HX-1 and HX-2) will be used to

reduce the size of the air blowers and the resulting noise level, to
26

simplify heat exchanger design, and to provide flexibility in the oper-
ation of the test stand. The use of two heat exchangers is also consistent
with the test stand layout.

A computer program was modified for performing the heat transfer ana-
lysis of the preliminary design (see Appendix G-2), a concept of which is
shown in Fig. 10. Salt flows through the 8 in. pipe and cooling air is
blown through the concentric annular flow passage. The length of each
heat exchanger is calculated to be 16 ft and the annulus 0.D. is 10.500 in.
(.938 in. annular gap).

The preliminary heat exchanger design was based on the maximum pump-
ing power of 1200 hp when operating at 110% speed and 125% flow. Subse-

quent calculations for the final design will be made for this power level.

2.3.2.2 Blowers. Air is used as the cooling medium and is forced
through appropriate ducting and the annulus of each of the two salt-to-air
concentric pipe exchangers by separate positive displacement blowers.

After the air leaves the heat-exchangers it is discharged through a stack
into the atmosphere at approximately U4OO°F. A preliminary layout of the
air handling system is shown in Fig. 11.

Positive displacement blowers were selected because of their relia-
bility, economy, and capability to move large quantities of atmospheric
air against a relatively high pressure drop. Blower data are shown in
Table 7.

The blowers (B-1 and B-2) and drive motors will be installed outside
the main test building (Bldg. 9201-3) to reduce the noise level in the
area around the test stand. They will be housed in an acoustically treated
building to reduce noise in the area adjacent to the test building. In
addition, blower intake and discharge silencers will be installed to re-
duce the noise level, and the intake air will be filtered.

The pressure rise-flow and the brake horsepower curves for the blowers
and the estimated alr system resistance curve are shown in Fig. 12. When
the by-pass valves (HV-145 and HV-1L46) are closed, the system will be oper-
ating at point "A." As a bypass valve is opened, the flow through the by-
pass valve will be the difference in the system resistance curve and the
blower P-Q curve and the remainder of the flow will pass through the heat

exchanger.

Consideration was given to the use of two surplus blowers located

at the Experimental Gas Cooled Reactor (EGCR) and the manufacturer was

asked for an estimate for refurbishing the blowers to meet our require-

ments. The estimate was a great deal more than the cost of procuring the

new positive displacement blowers which we have decided to use.

2.4 Utility Systems

The test stand will be provided with the necessary inert gas, instru-

ment air, cooling water, and electricity for the operation of the stand

and the salt pump. Argon, helium, and instrument air of appropriate quality

and sufficient quantity are available in the test building. The electrical

capacity available in the building is sufficient to supply all the test

stand and salt pump requirements.

2.4.1 Inert Gas

An inert cover gas is used to protect the primary salt from contact

with moisture and oxidizing atmospheres.

It is used to pressurize the

pump to prevent cavitation, to pressurize the salt storage tank and there-

by transfer the salt into the salt circulating system, and to reduce the

pressure differential across the bellows of the salt throttling valve.
30

ORNL DWG. 69-13459

 

Fig. 12. Air Handling System Characteristics.
31

Inert gas from two sources will be used. An 80 psig supply will provide
inert gas for most applications. A 250 psig supply station utilizing high-
pressure cylinders of either argon or helium will be made available. Neces-
sary piping, valves, and instrumentation will be provided to conduct inert
gas to the appropriate locations. The Instrument Application Diagram,

Inert Gas Supply System is shown in Appendix E.

2.4.2 Instrument Air
Dry instrument air will be used as a coolant for the freeze valve
(HV-129) in the salt transfer line (line 200) and for operating instruments.

This air will be obtained from the Y-12 instrument air supply.

2.4.3 Cooling Water

Cooling water will be required for the removal of heat from the pump
drive motor, the pump lubricant system, and the pump shield plug cooling
system. A brief study was made of the economics of using a cooling tower
versus using Y-12 Plant process water. A cooling tower for dumping 75 hp
(a 95% efficient 1500 hp motor) would cost about $15,000 to install.
Operating and maintenance costs would add to this figure. Y-~12 process
water to dump the same amount of heat for 5 years would cost about $6000.

Thus, Y-12 process water will be used for cooling. (See Appendix G-V).

2.4. Electrical

The principal electrical systems for the experiment are shown in the
Electrical Schematic Diagram, Appendix F. Present building facilities
include a 13.8 kv bus of sufficient capacity to supply a 1500 hp drive
motor, a 480 v bus duct available to supply the preheaters and all the
auxiliary equipment, and a 480 v diesel-driven generator system available

to provide emergency power during normal power outages.

2.4.4.1 2400 Volt System. A new 2400 volt electrical distribution
system will be installed outside the building to connect the power supply
to the pump drive motor and will provide for a motor as large as 1500 hp.
The new system will be connected to the existing 13.8 kv bus and will con-
sist of (a) one 1200a, 13.8 kv oil circuit breaker, (b) 350 MCM, 15 kv
cable, (¢) 1500 kva, 13.8/2.L4 kv 3¢ transformer, (d) 1200a, 2.4 kv reduced
voltage starter equipment, and (e) 300 MCM, 5 kv cable connected to the

pump motor.
32

The existing 13.8 kv bus is located in the southeast corner of the
building. The transformer and starter equipment will be outdoor type and
will be located at the west side of the building. Connecting cables will

be run in conduit.

2.h.h.2 L480/240/120 Volt System. All heaters and auxiliary equip-

 

ment will be fed from the existing 480 v system. Transformers will be
provided to supply 240 v and 120 v where necessary.

The heat exchanger blower motors (B-1 and B-2) and pump lube oil equip-
ment will be supplied directly from the 480 v bus through combination motor
starters. Seven circuits feeding 480 - 120/240 v transformers will supply
power to the salt piping and equipment heaters. Additional circuits will
supply 120 v power to miscellaneous equipment.

Power to the pump lube oil equipment, instrumentation, salt freeze
valve (HV 129), pump shield plug cooling system, stand enclosure blowers,
and air sampling heads will be automatically supplied by the building
emergency diesel generator in the event normal electrical power is lost.

Return to normal power will be by manual operation.

2.5 Site Location

The test stand containing the salt circuit will be located at the
west end cf the second floor of Building 9201-3 in the Y-12 Plant, Osk
Ridge, Tennessee. The cooling air blowers and auxiliaries will be located
on the ground level outside the west end of the building. See Figs. kL,
11, and 13 for salt circulating system, air handling system, and plant
location, respectively. This location in the building was chosen because
it (1) meets the stand requirements with very few building modifications,
(2) provides convenient access to existing pump maintenance facilities,
(3) permits installation of the large blowers (B-1 and 2) and the heat
removal system stack outside the test building, and (4) is available with
minimum renovation and disturbance to other test stands and shops.

A traveling bridge crane, with 20-ton and 5-ton hoists, serves the
area. A l-ton jib hoist is also available to provide additional hoisting

capability when needed.

2.6 Instrumentation and Controls

 

See Appendix E, Instrument Application Diagrams for a detailed pre-

sentation of instrumentation and controls.

2.6.1 Temperature Measurement and Control

 

Approximately 1hl4 stainless steel sheathed, insulated junction,
chromel-alumel thermocouples will be used to monitor temperatures on the
pump test section, on heat exchangers, in air systems, and for loop heater
control. The thermocouples will be connected to the reference junctions
at the control cabinets by double shielded chromel-alumel extension lead
wire, with the sheath being grounded at the thermocouple end only. Temper-
atures will be read out on available multipoint strip chart recorders and
indicating controllers. The more important temperatures will also be read
out on the DEXTIR data logging system (described in Sect. 2.6.6), and on

a 100 cycle per second oscillographic recording system.

2.6.2 Pressure Measurement and Control

 

The pump tank cover gas pressure will be used as a measure of the
pump inlet pressure. Pairs of NaK sealed high-temperature pressure trans-
mitters will be used to measure loop pressures at the pump outlet (PT-131
and PT-140) and at the outlet of throttle valve HCV-75 (PT-73 and PT-Th).
The seals (PX-131, PX-1L40, PX-73, and PX-T4), which will be rated at L4CO
psig, will have to be obtained and will be long delivery items, possibly
up to two years. The seals and pressure transmitters are being installed
in pairs to avoid costly delays should one of them fail. The outputs
from all the pressure transmitters will be read out on the DEXTIR but the
outputs from PT-140 and PT-73 will be read out on single point strip chart
recorders.

To protect the throttle valve bellows seal, which requires a balanced
pressure between the salt and inert gas, the outputs from PT-73 and PT-T2
will be used to regulate the gas pressure to the bellows. The outputs
from PT-T4 and PT-72 will be used for an alarm in case the differential

pressure across the bellows becomes excessive.
 

35

Cover gas pressure, lube oil pressures, and air pressures will be
read on conventional gauges and controlled by pressure switches, solenoid
valves, and hand valves. Differential pressures across filters IFS-1, IFS- 2
and the CWS filter will be measured by locally » mounted gauges PAI- 13k,
PAI-135, and PAI-136.

2. 6. 3 Flow Measurement oo

Main Loop salt flow in the range of 3000 to 8000. gpm will be deter-
mined by measuring the differential pressure of the truncated Venturi
tube (FE- 100) shown in Fig. 1h. The individual pressures will be measured
with redundant Nak. sealed pressure transmitters PT-1, PT-2, PT-3, and PT-L.
The differential pressure will then be deduced from the outputs of PT-2 Co
and PT-3 ‘with PT-1 and PT-k being used as’ spares. The resultant output
will be presented on a single-point strip chart recorder and on DEXTIR.
To avoid calibration problens, ‘the’ seals  PX-1, PX-2,. PE-3, and PX-4 will
also be rated at 400 psig. Co = Lu SEL

Instrument air flow to the freeze valve (av 129) will be read on
panel mounted rotameter Fi- -111. The measurement of lube oil flow to the
salt pump will be included in the lube oil package. Flow measurements
are not planned for the enclosure exhaust air or the cooling air to the
heat exchangers HX-1 and HX-2. oo

2.6.4 Level Measurements
© Salt level in the storage tank will be determined by four on-off
probes 1E-92, LE- -93, 1E- 94, and IE- 95 at different levels in the tank.
Salt level will be indicated by the on-off position of four indicating
lights.

2.6.5 -Alarms and Interlocks

The strip chart recorders, indicating controllers, and pressure

 

switches will have low and high signal switch contacts for control and
alarm (see Section 3.6) purposes. Alarms will be indicated by a bell
and existing annunciator panels with lighted windows that show abnormal
conditions before and after acknowledgment and normal conditions before °
and after reset. Scram action will be provided as appropriate, either
simultaneously with the alarm or at a desired increment sbove or below

the alarm setting.

2.6.6 Data Acquisition Computer System

This system is presently installed in Building 9201-3 and is used
for monitoring and recording data for experiments now being performed.

The system consists of a Beckman DEXTIR data acquisition system interfaced
to a Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8 computer which has a core memory
of 4096 twelve-bit words. Conversion of the data to engineering units

is done on-line, and all data are digitized and recorded on magnetic tape
for further processing by the ORNL IBM 360/75 computer. A large library
of programs is avallable to process these tapes.

The data acquisition computer system can provide a listing of data
in engineering units at the test stand. It has a capacity of 2500 analog
and 2500 digital inputs and has a speed of 8 channels per second. Overall
accuracy is + 0.07% of full scale, resolution is one part in 10,000,and
the input signal range is 0-10 millivolts full scale to 0-1 volt full
scale in three programmable steps.

Data gathering boxes, each with 25 analog and 25 digital channel
capacity, can be plugged into the "party line" cable at any point in the
network. Digital input capability is provided by both thumbwheel switch
and contact input modules. The modules can accept decimal or binary coded
decimal contact closures from counters, clocks, frequency meters, digital
voltmeters, and other devices that have digital outputs. Thermocouple
reference junction compensation is provided for all thermocouple inputs.

The PDP-8 computer software consists of a real time multiple task
executive system, with four levels of priority interrupt. The highest
priority level 1s assigned to protection of the operating system in case
of power failure. The second priority is assigned to the processing of
data, the third to keyboard input, and the fourth to printer output.

Another package of computer programs performs the engineering units
conversion tasks and such utility functions as punching tape, reading tape,
entering data into memory, listing the contents of specified memory loca-
tions, clearing specified memory locations, etc.

A disk file is being added that will provide an additional 32,000
words of bulk storage and will permit the individual experimenter to have

his own program for on-line calculations and teletype plots.
38

The salt pump test stand will require the installation of two addi-
tional data gathering boxes and the preparation of a program for on-line
calculations and graph plotting. The input to the DEXTIR from the test
stand is indicated with the nomenclature EDP on the Instrument Application

Diagrams, Appendix E.
39

3.0 Principles of Operation

 

The prototype pump tank and all the salt pump rotary elements will
be operated in a depleted uranium, natural lithium version of the MSBE
primary salt. Operation of the rotary element of the secondary salt pump
at its design head and flow conditions with the denser primary salt would
overload the pump drive motor and overpressurize the salt system piping.
Therefore, we plan to operate the secondary pump rotary element at its
design speed and temperature, but with a slightly reduced diameter im-
peller (about SI design diameter) which will load its motor to rated
power and will stress the coupling, bearings, and shaft to their respective
design levels without overstressing the salt piping system. This general
philosophy was used to proof test the fuel and coolant salt pumps for the
Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). The hydraulic performance charac-
teristics for the salt pumps will be obtained during water tests conducted

by the pump manufacturer.

3.1 Startup

All the facility and test components, assemblies, and systems will
be inspected individually and collectively prior to startup. These in-
spections will be made to check conformance to approved drawings, speci-
fications, and standards.

While at room temperature the salt system will be purged with inert
gas, evacuated to remove oxygen and moisture, and refilled with inert gas.
The lubrication system and shield plug cooling systems will be started.
The mechanical performance of the salt pump and drive motor will be ob-
served during operation with inert gas while preheating to 1200°F. The
salt system including the drain tank will be preheated to the desired
temperature (normally 1200°F). During preheating, the salt system will
be evacuated and then refilled with inert gas several times to reduce
moisture and oxygen levels even further. The salt pump will be rotating
during preheating to assist in giving a more nearly isothermal condition
throughout the loop.

With the pump off, the salt storage tank, previously filled with
molten salt, will be slowly pressurized with inert gas to transfer salt

into the pump loop until the proper salt level has been reached in the
40

pump tank. The freeze valve will be established to hold the salt in the
system. The required flow rates of inert purge gas will be established
and the appropriate pressure on the surface of the system salt will be
obtained. Finally the salt pump will be started and functional checks

will be made on all systems for proper performance.

3.2 Test Operation

When the salt pump and all test stand systems are performing satis-

factorily, the following salt pump test program will be initiated:

3.2.1 Prototype Pump

1. The mechanical performance of the salt pump and drive motor will
be observed for any abnormal behavior such as excessive noise or vibration.

2. The design of the drive motor and cooling system and the drive
motor support system will be proven.

3. The lubrication system for the salt pump and the provisions for
handling shaft seal oil leakage will be checked.

4. The transient characteristics of pump speed and salt flow during
startup and coastdown will be determined.

5. The hydraulic performance and cavitation inception characteristics
of the salt pump will be obtained over a range of pump speeds and salt
flow rates and temperatures.

6. The relationship of the purge gas flow in the shaft annulus to
the back diffusion of fission products from the pump tank to the seal
region will be determined.

T. The maximum salt void fraction that the pump will tolerate will
be determined. Measurements will be made of the void fraction in the
circulating salt due to gas entrained from the gas space by the salt by-
pass flows within the pump.

8. The effect of operating the pump with insufficient salt, to the
point of the start of ingassing, will be studied.

9. The production of aerosols of salt in the prototype pump tank
during pump operation will be checked as will any aerosol removal device
needed to protect the off-gas lines and components from plugging by aero-

sol deposition.
ha

10. The pump bowl cooling system will be evaluated.

11. Demonstration tests of Incipient Failure Detection (IFD) devices
and systems will be made. Pump manufacturers will be requested to recom-
mend IFD devices and systems to indicate a substantial change in a pump
operating characteristic that might point to an impending failure of some
pump component. Parameters that may yield significant reliability infor-
mation include pump power and speed, shaft vibration and displacement,
and noise signatures of the pump at various operating conditions.

12. Any other meaningful tests recommended by the MSBE pump manu-
facturer will be performed.

13. After all specific short term tests have been completed, long
term endurance test runs will be performed.

14. The characteristics of the pump with the gas injection and re-
moval devices, which will be used to remove xenon 135 from the MSBE circu-
lating salt, will be verified in salt. Nozzles will be installed on the

salt piping to accommodate these devices.

3.2.2 ETU and MSBE Pumps
Rotary elements of the primary and secondary salt pumps for the ETU

and the MSBE will be subjected to high temperature, non-nuclear prooftests
in the salt pump test stand prior to installation into their respective
systems. These tests will prove the high-temperature performance and the

construction and assembly quality of the rotary elements.

3.3 Shutdown

Shutdown of the system will be initiated by turning off the salt
pump and the air blowers. The salt will be drained into its storage tank
by thawing the freeze valve and equalizing the gas pressures in the pump
and storage tanks. After the salt is drained from the system, the pump
will be rotated for a short time to sling off any salt clinging to the
impeller. The electric heaters will be turned off and the system will
be permitted to cool to room temperature. The lubrication system and
shield plug cooling system will be turned off when the pump temperature
is reduced to near room temperature. An inert gas atmosphere will be

maintained in the loop. When the system is cool it will be ready for
Lz

maintenance of components or for removal of the salt pump in accordance

with the necessary procedures.

3.4 Thermal Transients

The test stand has a limited capability for performing thermal tran-
sient tests. Tor both heating and cooling, Fig. 15 shows that the attain-
able rates of temperature change depend greatly upon the amount of salt
in the loop and pump. At present it is estimated that the minimum salt
volume in the system will be about 35 cu ft. The cooling transient is
obtained by using maximum salt system cooling and reducing the salt pump
speed to obtain about 10% of the design flow. The heating transient is
obtained by turning off the salt system cooling and turning on all the
electric heaters on the loop and pump while the pump is operating at 110%
of design speed and the loop throttling valve is wide open.

A larger cooling thermal shock also can be applied to the pump in
the test loop as follows: With the pump motor stopped, the temperature
of the pump impeller and casing and salt in the pump tank can be maintained
at approximately 1300°F, while the salt in the loop piping is lowered to
about 1000°F. To reduce natural convection the throttling valve would be
"closed." After opening the throttling valve, the salt pump would be
brought up to design speed within 2 to 3 seconds, and the cool salt from
the piping would displace the hot salt in the fully loaded pump impeller
and casing. Thermal stresses in the salt piping appear to be acceptable;

see Appendix G-9.

3.5 Special or Infrequent Operation

 

In addition to the previously outlined pump test operation, the test
stand will be operated to:

1. Obtain the characteristics of instrumentation for measuring salt
flow and pressure as required.

2. Study problems which may arise during the operating life of the
ETU or MSBE.

3.6 Equipment Safety

Several pump and test stand operating parameters will be monitored
continuously to provide for the safety of the salt pump, test stand, and
test personnel. These parameters will include pump power, speed, and
lubricant flow; salt temperature, flow, and liquid level; pump tank cover
gas pressure; pump and test stand vibration; air blower power and oil
pressure, and shield plug and drive motor coolant flow. Table 8 presents

a list of the emergency conditions and the actions to be taken.

4.0 Safety Precautions

 

A preliminary safety analysis of the pump test stand was made to iden-
tify potential accidents and the consequences and to deduce methods to pre-

vent accidents and minimize the consequences.

4.1 ZILoss of Normal Electrical Power

 

Loss of electrical power will cause the salt pump motor, cooling air
blower motors, and preheaters on the salt piping and equipment to cease
operation. 8alt in the salt circulating system will become stagnant and
will cool from the normal operating temperature of 1300°F. To prevent
salt from freezing (~930°F melting point) in the piping and the pump, it
must be drained into the salt storage tank. Since solid salt in the freeze
valve can be thawed most quickly with electric heaters, a reliable, emergency
source of electric power is required. The emergency power source consists
of a diesel-driven 300 kw electric generator located in Building 9201-3,
which has been in backup duty for 12 years. It is operated once each week
to maintain readiness.

During power failure the emergency power supply will also be used to
operate the blowers for enclosure exhaust and air sampling, salt pump lubri-

cation and shield plug cooling systems, and appropriate instrumentation.

L.2 Operating Procedures

 

Instrumentation, including alarms, interlocks, and other safety devices,
will be installed to minimize cperating errors that could affect personnel
safety or result in damage to equipment. In order to minimize further such
errors the operation of the test stand will be under the supervision of
technical personnel experienced in the operation of molten salt systems.

They will use instructions contained in carefully written procedures to
startup, operate, and shutdown the test stand. Assistance in preparation
of test procedures, in test stand operation, and in the execution of the
salt pump test program is expected from engineers assigned by pump manu-

facturers who participate in the MSBE salt pump program.
kT

4.3 Leak or Rupture in Salt Containing Piping and Equipment

 

4.3.1 Consequences
a. Leak. High pressure could jet a small stream of molten

salt a distance in excess of 10 ft.

b. Rupture. Large quantities of molten salt could flow onto
the floor in the immediate vicinity of the test stand.

c. Salt vapors and particles could be picked up by cooling
air and released from the exhaust stack, if the salt pipe ruptures inside
the heat exchanger air cooling jacket.

d. Cooling air could blow vapors and particles over a large
area inside the building, if the salt pipe and the heat exchanger air

cooling jacket are ruptured.

4.3.2 Hazards

a. Toxic effects of beryllium to personnel. Beryllium pre-
sents the main chemical toxicity problem of all the components in the
test salt.

b. The effects of high temperature burns to personnel.

c. The ignition of fires in combustible material and equip-
ment in the surrounding area.

d. The effects of low level nuclear radiation to personnel

due to the presence of uranium and thorium in the salt.

1.3.3 Preventive Measures

a. Salt-containing equipment will be designed, procured, and
fabricated according to applicable high-quality standards.

b. The salt containing equipment will be enclosed within a
sheet-metal structure having a top, sides, and bottom to contain molten
salt leakage. The enclosure protects personnel from burns, prevents the
salt leak vapors from contaminating areas adjacent to the test stand, and
provides a controlled radiation hazard area.

c. An exhaust system, operating continuously, will be pro-
vided to ventilate the test stand enclosure. The air will be filtered
to reduce the concentration of the salt vapors to a safe level before it

is discharged into the outside atmosphere.
Lg

d. At least 7 air sampling stations will be provided inside
the enclosure, in the exhaust stacks, and in the immediate area around
the test stand. The air sampling stations will be monitored daily for
the presence of beryllium by the Industrial Hygiene Department. Air in
the Y-12 general area is monitored continuously for beryllium and other
materials.

e. In the event of a molten salt leak, interlocks and alarms
will be provided in the control system to shut off the circulating salt
pump and the cooling air blowers. Salt will be drained from the system
piping into the salt storage tank by manual control. The drain line is
not a safety feature and the drain time is not critical. The design of
the stand enclosure will provide adequate contaimment for the leakage of
all the salt inventory. The liquid level indicator in the pump tank will
be used to detect large salt leaks, and smaller leaks will be detected by
air sampling, as indicated in Item 4d above.

f. In the event of a simultaneous leakage of salt and the
failure of the filter in the enclosure ventilation system the enclosure
blower would be shutoff immediately to prevent the spread of unfiltered
effluent. The industrial hygienists would be alerted immediately to take
proper administrative action including evacuation of the building. The
salt would be permitted to freeze in the enclosure and the procedures for
its removal after freezing would be implemented.

g. The salt spill cleanup procedure, developed previously

for use in Building 9201-3, will be followed in case of a salt leak.

5.0 Maintenance

5.1 Maintenance Philosophy

Design, fabrication, equipment selection, and installation work will
be directed toward the goal of obtaining highly reliable equipment. The
equipment will be installed in the salt pump test stand with critical
equipment monitored continuously and shut down for maintenance when failure
is impending. Symptons of impending failure may be detected by visual and
audio observations and by pressure, temperature, flow, vibration, and other
diagnostic instrumentation. Experience has indicated that symptoms of im-
pending equipment failure usually develop sufficiently far in advance to
permit the scheduling of maintenance activities without excessive outages

or equipment damage.

5.2 Preventive Maintenance
Certain instruments and equipment, and in particular the ones with
moving parts, will be checked and serviced on a routine basis. Appropriate

instrumentation will be checked and recalibrated between test runs.

5.3 Maintenance Procedures

Procedures and controls that have been used satisfactory in the past
will be adapted to protect personnel performing maintenance within the
loop enclosure. Of concern are the toxicity effects of some of the salt

components and the radiation hazards of others.

6.0 Standards and Quality Assurance

6.1 Codes and Standards

6.1.1 Design

Specific requirements have been determined for the salt pump test
stand, as stated in Section 1.3. These requirements have been approved
by the Molten Salt Reactor Project and Laboratory Management. Experienced
and qualified designers will be assigned to the task, and when detail
drawings are completed, they will be reviewed for function, safety, and
construction. Engineering standards and procedures in the area of design
have been established and are given in Appendix A. In general, the require-
ments specified in Section III for Class C vessels of the ASME Boiler and
Pressure Vessel Code and in the Code for Pressure Piping USAS B3l.1 will
be used in the design of the salt containing system. A complete piping

stress and flexibility analysis will be made.

6.1.2 Materials

The Ni-Mo-Cr alloy selected for the salt containment will be purchased
with existing ORNL MET materials specifications developed for the MSRE and
with RDT standards as applicable. Other material will be purchased with
ORNL MET, RDT, and ASTM standards and specifications, as applicable. The

proposed material specifications are given in Appendix A.

6.1.3 Fabrication and Installation

High quality welding, quality control, inspection procedures, and a
record system, as defined by the SPTS Quality Assurance Program Plan will
be used to fabricate and install all the salt-containing equipment. Other
fabrication and installation procedures developed by Oak Ridge National
Laboratory will be used as required. The applicable procedures are given

in Appendix A.

6.1.4 Operations
Step-by-step instructions contained in carefully planned procedures,
developed by engineers experienced in molten salt pump operation at ORNL,

will be used during startup, operation, and shutdown of the pump test stand.
51

6.2 Quality Assurance

The Quality Assurance Program Plan, M-10559-RM-100-A-0O, is being
prepared to provide a system that will operate satisfactorily. Its pre-
paration is based on RDT Standard F 2-2T, Quality Assurance Program

Requirements.

Preliminary Design Calculations
G-2

G-I Salt Storage Tank

The preliminary tank design, shown in Fig. 7, is predicated on the
use of Hastelloy N material on hand and the use of forming dies on hand
at Paducah for the torispherical heads. At the design temperature of
1200°F the allowable stress is 6000 psi. The required tank volume of
75 cu ft is based on the volume of approximately TO ft of 8 in. (sched
40) pipe (24 f£t3), plus 4O ft3 estimated maximum pump volume, and 11 ft3
for a gas space and a heel in the tank.

Allowable pressure due to circumferential stresses in cylindrical

shell 1/2 in. thick

SEL _ _(6000)(1)(.5) _ _ q51 pei Para UG-27%

P= RT 08 T(9.5) + (-8)(.5)

Allowable pressure in torispherical head 5/8 in. thick

SET (6000)(1)(.625)

P=omsn + 0.1% (885)(36) + (L1(.5)

Volume of tank

Tank Support

Total weight of tank and 65 cu ft of primary salt
= 3000 + 65 X 205 = 16,325 1b

Assume tank is supported by 4 support rods attached to 2 straps
passing under the tank and an allowable stress of 3500 psi:

= 117 psi Para UG-32%

(2 x 2.78) + ( X 392 x 105.875/1728) = 78.75 cu ft

Area of one strap = 16,325/(4 x 3500) = 1.17 in. Use 1/2 x 2 1/2

Support Rod

Assume allowable stress = 10,000 psi
A = 16,325/(4 x 10,000) = .408 in.2 Use rod diam = 3/k4 in.

G-II Heat Exchanger

An existing computer program (SALTEX) for salt-to-air heat ex-
changers was used to study the preliminary heat exchanger design for

SPTS. The design is subject to the following conditions or limitations:

Salt flow rate 8000 gpm

Pump power to fluid 1200 hp

Mean salt temperature 1050°F and 1300°F
Salt pipe size 8 in. (sched 40)
Maximum air velocity 900 fps

Air inlet temperature 150°F

Air inlet pressure Lh psig

Air flow rate 10,000 scfm (total)
Maximum air side AP 3.1 psi

The change in salt temperature around the loop with this flow rate
and input power is about O0.7°F, which is essentially isothermal during
normal operation. The computer output is shown on the two following

pages. The more important output is as follows:

Heat exchanger length 16 ft
Annular gap .938 in.
Air side AP 3.0 psi

Air side AT 280 °F

G-III Temperature Transients

 

To obtain an approximation of the maximum heating thermal transient
it was assumed that the pump was operating at 110% of design speed, the
throttling valve was wide open, the air blowers to the heat exchangers
were shut down, all electric heaters on the loop were turned on, and there
are no heat losses. The BHP of the pump would be about 1200 and based on
3 kw/sq ft of pipe surface area the total electric heat would be about
475 kw. The weight of INOR-8 in the loop (not including the drain tank)
is estimated to be 5000 lb.

q = (1200 hp x L42.k Btu/hp-min) + (475 kw X 57 Btu/kw-min) = 77,900 Btu/min.

where Q = volume of salt in loop and pump in cubic feet.

The resulting curve of temperature rise per minute versus the amount
of salt in the loop is shown in Fig. 15.

For the cooling thermal transient it was assumed that the pump is
operating at 10% of design speed, the air cooling system is set for a
heat removal of 1200 hp, all electric heaters on the loop are turned
off, and there are no heat losses. At 10% speed the BHP of the pump will
be about 1/1000 of design horsepower, or about one hp which is negligible.

q = 1200 hp X 42.4 Btu/hp-min = 50,880 Btu/min

G-IV Pump Characteristics

 

Since the MSBE salt pumps are yet to be designed by the United States
pump industry, it was necessary to estimate the characteristics of the
pumps in order to establish the design criteria for the components of the
SPTS. The index of a pump's characteristics is given by its specific

speed which is defined as:

=

H
3
So

 

nn
ax}
w
~~
>

If a speed of 900 rpm is selected for the primary pump and 1200 rpm
is selected for the secondary pump their respective specific speeds are
1584 and 1488. The shape of the head-flow curve is a function of the
specific speed.* The resultant head-flow curves for the primary and

secondary salt pumps are shown in Fig. 3.

G-V Heat Removal from 1500 hp Motor

 

Two proposed methods were considered in this investigation.
1. Use of Plant Water

This system would consist of a water supply line with shut-off and
throttling valves connected to a cooling coil and a drain line with open-
end combination vacuum breaker, sight-flow fitting that empties into the
building water drain. For the 1500 hp motor at 95% efficiency, waste
heat = 75 hp, or 3200 Btu/min. Assuming AT of 10°F and plant water
maximum temperature of about 60°F, a flow of about LO gpm is required.

The present cost of process water is 5 cents per thousand gallons.
LO gpm = ~60,000 gpd = $3.00 per day

2. Use of Air-Cooled HX with Pumped Circulation

 

__8 _2.0x105 _
A=“ T5x2o7.h = 973 ft? (say 1000 £2)

Then the cost is

HX = 1000 X 7.20/S.F = $7,200

(From UCC Cost Man. I-200-217.0.1)

Cir. Pump and Motor 50 gpm at 50 ft hd = 340

Installation (33 1/3% equip.) = 2.513

Indirect (50%) = 5,027
$15 ,080%

¥Does not include electrical.

Operating costs for an air-cooled HX and circulating pump would re-
quire driving power for two motors of approximately 2 hp each plus main~
tenance associated with keeping this equipment serviced.

The air-cooled heat exchanger would have to be located outside the

building and this would increase the cost of the installation.
G=9

Operating costs for use of plant water would be essentially nothing
except for the cost of water. With the cost of water at .05/1000 g and
a 5 year test duration, it appears that the simplicity and low cost makes

use of the plant water system the most desirable.

Flow Measurement Instrumentation
Location of the Flow Sensors

The flow sensors are located in the pump discharge line downstream
of the throttle valve and preceded by a straight run of pipe of about
30 pipe diameters. It is anticipated that turbulence from the throttle
valve will be sbout equivalent to a gate valve. To a limited extent it
may act as a perforated-plate-type flow turbulence remover. Thus it is
expected that satisfactory accuracy will be achieved.

Description of Flow Sensor

The flow sensor itself will be a truncated nozzle venturi tube. Con-
sideration must be given to the configuration of the flow sensor so that
it can be installed in an all-welded piping system and so that pressure
taps can be located properly. At present, it seems likely that a truncated
venturi might solve the problems of machining, welding, and pressure taps.
A preliminary sketch of the truncated nozzle venturi tube is shown in
Fig. 14. It is important that the upstream pressure be larger than the
differential pressure. This avolds a vacuum in the throat pressure tap.

Flow Calculation

An engineering study was made of flow calculations. For purposes
of comparison, three pipe sizes (8-, 10-, and 12-in.), six gp = a/p rakios
(0.50, 0.56, 0.60, 0.65, 0.70, and 0.75), and three flow rates (3000,
5700, and 8000 gpm) were studied. The salt used in the calculations
weighs 204.9 1b per cu ft at 1300°F.

For these preliminary calculations, the following formula was used.
(See Principles and Practice of Flow Meter Engineering, 9th ed, by
L. K. Spark.) Several correction factors were omitted for the sake of
simplicity.

bh, - (q, 6,/ wwe, 8)?

h, = differential pressure in inches of water
G-11

Q = flow rate in gpm
vy = a constant, 5.667, to be used when Q is in gpm
D = inside diameter of pipe in inches
Gy = gpecific gravity of flowing salt
Geo = specific gravity of

water at 60°F = 1.0

8 = an operating figure from which a/D may be obtained by
reference to a table or curve for the particular kind of

flow sensor under study.

The above equation was modified as follows in order to convert "inches
of water" to "pounds per square inch" and to group certain terms together

for easier calculations:

Gy 2 - 2
b= [2] [oh] [3] (eo)

From the resulting data, graphs of differential pressure vs. pipe
size for the various a/D ratios were plotted. The permanent pressure
loss curves were obtained from Fig. 24, p. 48, "Fluid Meters — Their
Theory and Application," ASME 5th ed., 1959. From the graphs, one can
draw this conclusion:

For 8-in. pipe, the a/D ratio must be high to keep differential
pressures low enough at maximum flow to be within the ranges of high-
temperature pressure transmitters. The highest d/D ratio for which
engineering data is available is about 0.75. For the higher a/D ratios,
longer lengths of straight pipe upstream of the flow sensor are recom-

mended. The d/D ratios between 0.2 and 0.6 are preferable.
Measuring the Differential Pressure

We plan to measure the flow sensor's differential pressure with two
pressure transmitters rather than with one differential pressure trans-
mitter. The reason for this is that no high temperature (1300°F) dif-
ferential pressure transmitter with sufficiently high static pressure

rating is known to be on the market. Perhaps one can be developed later
G-12

by one of the instrument manufacturers. The procurement of the simpler
high temperature pressure transmitters may be somewhat of a problem too,
because prototype transmitters for the SPTS facility and the MSBE will
be used. These transmitters will have seals that have multi-ply dia-

phragms. Such seals are not standard items of commerce.

G-VII MSBE Secondary Pump Operating in Primary Salt with
a Reduced Diameter Impeller

 

For a given pump the following relationships hold:
H varies as N° and D?
Q varies as N and D?
BHP varies as N° and D4

If we assume the primary pump speed is 900 rpm and the secondary
pump speed is 1200 rpm, then N/N, = 1.333. By a trial and error pro-
cess, D,/Dg = .84 comes close to meeting our requirements Of subjecting
the secondary pump rotary element to its design power and pressure rise

at its design speed.

From the above relationships we can arrive at the following:

H, = (N/M)? (D,/D;)? Hp = (1.333)2 (.84)= He = 1.254 H,
Q. = (N/m) (D./Dp)2 Qp = (1.333) (.84)2 q, = .9k1 gq
BHP, = (mw /m,)e (D./Dg)* BHP, = (1.333)3(.8k4)4 BHP, = 1.180 BHP.

These relationships were used for extrapolating the primary pump
head, flow, and brake horsepower to the curves for the reduced diameter

impeller shown in Fig. 8.
G-17

G-VIII Summary of Pressure Profile Calculations

Pressure distributions around the loop were determined for three

conditions:

1. flow, Q, = 7850 gpm and pump head, H, = 168 ft.,
2. flow, Q, = 5700 gpm and pump head, H, = 150 ft., and
3. flow, Q, = 2850 gpm and pump head, H, = 165.4 ft.

The fluid properties used were 1050°F

density, o, 210.7 1b/ft3 and

viscosity, yu, = 34.2 1b/ft hr.

The loop was separated into the following in-line components:

1. 4 ft of conduit (8 in. nominal) at the pump discharge,

2. the flow control valve,

3. 22 1/2 ft of conduit,

Lt, the flow nozzle,

5. 3 1/2 ft of conduit,

6. a flow restrictor made up of a thin plate perforated with holes
so that the ratic of plate area to conduit area, A/D, =~ 0.578,
and

7. 50 ft of conduit to the pump suction (including 20 ft of return
conduit, 20 ft equivalent estimated for the return bend, and

10 ft equivalent estimated for the bend into the pump).

The above components were located relative to each other so that
with very low (~0 abs) pressure at the pump suction, the lowest pressure
within the flow nozzle 1s limited to about 20 psia and there is sufficient
"entrance" length of conduit for good nozzle performance.

The friction loss in any component, i, was calculated from

= 2
ap, = CQ% ,

where the "loss coefficient," Cis is different for each component. The

various values for C were determined as shown below:
G-18

1. Conduit

The Blasius equation provides a convenient means for calculating
friction losses in conduits,

_ fL pV2 _ [_foL @
D 2g Fal ’

where C is clearly given by Sorar . Since f 1s a function of Reynolds

modulus, R.> then C will not be strictly a constant. However, over the
range of flows considered f changes by only 13% (at Q = 7840 gpm,
= T.4b x 10°, and f = .012; at Q = 2850, R, = 2.7 X 105, gnd f =~ 0.0136).

Therefore, for the conduit,

L
2. Flow Control Valve

The friction characteristics of the valve were not determined. It
must withstand the difference between the pump head produced and the head
losses due to the rest of the loop.

3. Flow Nozzle

The maximum pressure difference in the flow nozzle at 7900 gpm is
128.5 psi of which approximately 45 psi is permanently lost (see
Appendix G-6, Selection of Flow Nozzle).

The loss-coefficient is therefore given by

= AP/Q2 = 15/(7900)2 = .721 x 107 psi/(gpm)?

Q

A coefficient was also determined for the maximum pressure change,

128.5/(7900)2 = 2.065 x 10™° psi/(gpm)?

L. Flow Restrictor

The flow restrictor was considered as a combingtion of a sudden
contraction followed by a sudden expansion with an area ratio of 0.578
(A, = 0.2 Tt?).

Pressure distributions were determined for the same conditions ex-
cept the salt temperature was increased to 1300°F. There was no signifi-
cant difference in the resulting pressure profile.

The resulting pressure profiles for the three flow rates are shown
in Fig. 5. Any profile may be moved upward by increasing the cover gas
pressure up to 50 psig, as shown for the 3000 gpm profile. The cover
gas pressure may be increased to prevent pump cavitation, to avoid sub-
atmospheric pressures at the low pressure PMD of the venturi tube, or

for other test purposes.
G-21

G-IX Stress Analyses

The Salt Pump Test Stand has been analyzed using the MEL-ZIP,
"Piping Flexibility Analysis Program,” to determine whether stresses
produced by the thermal expansion of the system are within the limits
set by "USAS B3l.l - The USA Standard Code for Pressure Piping,” using
the allowable stress values for the Ni-Mo-Cr alloy given in Code Case
1315-3 for Section VIII of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code -
Division 1.

Cases were analyzed in which the entire loop was at 1200°F and
where the top leg was at 1300°F and the bottom leg was at 1200°F. The
stresses produced by the restraint of the thermal expansion through
the supports were found to be below the allowable stresses for both
cases.

An analysis is currently underway to determine whether the stresses
due to pressure and welght are within the limits specified by the Piping

Code.
