PHASE EQUILIBRIA IN MOLTEN SALT BREEDER REACTOR FUELS.
I. THE SYSTEM LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF,

C. I. Weaver R. BE. Thoma H. Insley H. A. Friedman

ABSTRACT

The phase equilibrium relationships for the systems limiting the
quaternary system LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF, are described in detail along with
available information on the quaternary system itself. The implications

of the extensive solid solutions in the limiting systems are discussed

- and experimental information supporting the conclusions is presented.

The optical properties, crystallographic properties, and x-ray diffrac-
tion patterns for the phases occurring in these systems are tabulated.
Specific compositions of project interest to which references have been
made in the ORNL literature are given special attention. Reference is
made to literature reporting properties of these materials other than

those discussed in this report.

© 1. INTRODUCTION

Fluoride fused salts have attracted general interest for use in high-

temperature reactors because: (1) fluorine has a very low thermal neutron

1

absorption cross section, (2) fluorides have low vapor pressures at tem-

peratures and compositions of interest, ? (3) molten fluorides are very

2 and (4) there are no serious

resistant to damage by nucléar emissions,
corrosion problems between many fluorides and nickel-based structural ma-
terial. 2 Specifically, uranium tetrafluoride, a fissile material, is of |

interest because it is ‘the only nongaseous fluoride of uranium which does

not incur serious metal container _corrosion “and/or Tusl inhomogeneity as

i a fertile material, is the only fluoride of thorium.% The fluorides PbF,,
BiFs;, Li’F, NaF, ZrF,;, end BeF, have sufficiently low thermal neutron ab- oo !
sorption cross sections, vapor pressures, and melting points to allow their |
use as diluents for the UF, and ThF,. However, PbF, and BiFj3 are unsult- :
able because the cations are readily reduced to the metallic state by
structural metals such as iron and chromium.’ The lower thermal neutron
absorption cross section of Li” as compared with that of sodium allows
the design of reactors which have a smaller holdup of fissile material
1 : a and superior breeding performance. ©

Fluid salt mixtures containing high concentrations of ZrF, are not
“regarded as attractive reactor fluids because of significant vapor pres-

1 sure of ZrF, above 500°C. In a reactor system sublimation of ZrF, fol-

lowed by deposition as a solid limits the temperatures at which long op-

 

: &,
erating times are permissible. Comparable limitations do not occur in 1

mixtures containing BeF, rather than ZrF, 7 Molten salt reactor systems 3

 

which are designed to operate at sufficiently high temperatures that al-
kali fluoride—ZrF, solvents containing 30-40 mole % ZrF, can be employed
may offer advantages in the future, but present preference must be given
to BeF, on the basis of sublimation. Consequently, mixtures containing
"LiF, BeF,, UF,, and ThF, which have liquidus values several hundred de-
grees below the ThF, and UF, melting points are the most promising core

materials for a fused salt thermal breeder/converter reactor. A knowl-

 

edge of the liquidus values of such mixtures is necessary since as reac-

| tor fluids they must remain wholly in the liquid state during reactor op-

{(»

{ eration. Liquidus data alone are insufficient because mixtures of solids

and liquids will be formed during scme fuel handling operations. A knowl-
edge of the nature of the melting-freezing process, of the uranium-thorium

partition or phase separation during this process, and of the identity of

solids formed on cooling of molten mixtures is also necessary. Thus, the
phase equilibrium relationships for the quaternary system must be under-
stood, especially near liquidus temperatures and at compositions which
may afford attractive core or blanket materials. Before the determina-
tions of the phase relationships can be made in a quaternary system, the
14 limiting unary, binary, and ternary systems must be understood. All
these limiting systems for the quaternary system LiF-BeF,-UF,-ThF, have

been reported and are described in detail in the body of this report along

‘ with the available data on the quaternary system itself. It is remarkable

: that these studies have not disclosed the existence of ternary or of

quaternary compounds.

The majority of the information included in this report was derived

“in the High Temperature Phase Equilibrium Group of the Reactor Chemistry

Division at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Some of the preliminary
studies of the phase equilibria in the limiting binary and ternary sys-

tems were begun as early as 1951.

2. EXPERIMENTAL METHODS
2.1 Techniques and Apparatus

The experimental techniques and apparatus used in the studies of
IiF-BeF,-UF ,-ThF, phase equilibria have been described in detail else-
where." 13 1p general, the data were obtained by thermal analysis of
slowly cooled melts and by quenching mixtures which had been equilibrated
at known temperatures. Commonly, fused-salt diagrams are based entirely
on information from cooling curves (temperature of the sample plotted as

a function of time). (Changes in the slope of the cooling curve reflect

phase changes which occur on cooling, but are prone to give misleading
or irrelevant indications because of fhe impossibility of maintaining

— equilibrium auring the cooling process. Consequently, predominant use

has been made of the much more effective method of quenching equilibrium
samples and identifying the phases by examination with a polarizing light

microscope and by x-ray diffraction techniques.

 

A thermal gradient furnace with a single moving thermocouplet?t is
used for equilibration in the temperature range 650-1200°C. Five other
thermal gradient furnaces, operating at a maximum temperature of 900°C,
incorporate 18 thermocouples each. The independent readings from these
are used to determine a temperature calibration curve of the thermal gra-
dient within the annealing area of the furnace. Malfunction of a single

thermocouple becomes readily apparent. In quenching studies made at tem-

pr

peratures below 900°C, sample tubes are distributed among the five fur-
naces randomly, to achieve maximum reproducibility among independent tem~

perature readings. The region of temperature overlap, 650-900°C, is used

(»

to monitor the single high-temperature furnace. In the absence of super-
cooling effects, the completely separate measurements in the thermal anal- 2

ysis furnaces agree within 5°C with those from the thermal gradient fur-

 

naces. This interlocking system, by which multiple thermocouples within
five of the furnaces and three types of furnaces are used, provides a
continuous check on the proper function of the equipment.

The accuracy of the temperature measurements is limited by the char-
acteristics of the Chromel-Alumel thermocouples used.t* The invariant
point temperature data are so precise that a standard deviation of 1 or

2° is obtained.

2.2 Materials

The LiF used for this work was reagent grade obtained from Foote
Mineral Company and from Maywood Chemical Works. The UF, was a product
of Mallinckrodt Chemical Works. The ThF, was obtained from Iowa State
College and from National Lead Company. The BeF, was a product of Brush
Beryllium Company. No impurities were found in any of these materials
by x-ray diffraction or microscopic analysis. Spectroscopic analysis in-

dicates less than 0.25 wt % impurities.

© Because thoriuml’

and uranium fluorides are easily converted to ox-
ides or oxyfluorides at elevated temperatures it was necessary to remove
small amounts of water and oxygen as completely as possible from the
starting materials. In a few cases the molten mixtures were treated with
anhydrous HF. For the vast majority of preparations, however, NH FHF
was added to the mixture before melting. As such mixtures are heated

the water evaporates from the system. Trace quantities of oxide impuri-
ties are converted to products which have not yet been identified but

which are likely to be ammonium "fluometallates.'16»17

Upon further heat-
ing the ammonium "fluometallates"” and the excess NH F+HF decompose. The
products are metal fluorides and the gases NH; and HF. These gases are
quantitatively swept from the system by dry helium. The samples were
melted and cooled to obtain thermal analysis data. The purified solids
were transferred to an argon-filled dry box which contained BaO as a des-
-iccant. They were ground to pass a 100-mesh screen and used in the

quenching experiments. The heating cycles were conducted in closed cap-

sules or under an atmosphere of dry helium or argon.

~ 3. PHASE EQUILIBRIA AND RELATED PHENOMENA
3.1 The Components LiF, BeF,, ThF,, and UF,

A special character can be assigned to the behavior of combinations
of the four compounds 14F, Bel',, ‘ThF,, and UF, for in this grouping are
to be found a pair of metal cations in the lowest and a pair in the high-
est atomic number range. It might, therefore, be expected that the di-~
verse physical and chemical properties of these four components would ’

contribute to the occurrence of phase behavior in which a wide variety

   
   
  

 

of phenomena would appear. The melting points. of the components are

 
 
 

shown in Table 1.

The structure of BeF, is analogous to that of Si0,, as was predicted by
Goldschmidt; 1? all known modifications crystallize as SiOz-type struc-
tures. Being similar to Si0,, BeF, readily forms a glass upon cooling
from the liquid state. For this reason, establishing solid-state equi-
libria with BeF,, in which devitrification of this glass must be accom~
plished, is often a very slow process.

Optical and crystallographic properties for the compounds LiF, BeF,,
ThF,, and UF, may be found in Appendix A. Their x-ray diffraction data
are listed in Appendix B.

may be observed to grow slowly into solid mixtures of LiF and BeF, which

are held for several days at temperatures Just below 280°C. The forma-

tion of LiF-BeF, glass which devitrifies slowly also prevents compositions

"rich in BeF, from reaching equilibrium rapidly. Mixtures of 1iF and BeF,

No ternary compounds form within the system 1iF-BeF,-UF,%0, 51 (Figs.

those of the components or binary compounds described above (Secs 3.1,
3.2, 3.3, and 3.5). The compositions and temperatures of the five in-
variant points may be found in Table 5. The equilibrium phase behavior
of selected compositions of LiF-BeF,-UF, is given in Table 6 and in Ap-
pendix C. When mixtures of LiF, BeF,, and UF, cool slowly from the lig-
uid state, equilibrium is rarely, if ever, achieved. In the compositions
Cc-75, C-126, C-130, C-131, and C~136 solids have been routinely observed

in the cooled melts which are indicative of nonequilibrium cooling.’27%4

in this system which is of significance is the formation of a solid so-

lution in which beryllium replaces both lithium and thorium in the

3LiF-ThF, lattice. The single-phase composition area for this solid so-

lution is limited as indicated in Table 7. This results in the forma-
tion of phases at the solidus whose compositions are not so diverse as

those which would have been formed if the substitutional solid solution

Fig. 10. The System LiF-BeF,-ThF,.

The equilibrium phase behavior which will occur in several selected
LiF-BeF,-ThF, compositions is described in Table 9.

When mixtures of LiF-BeF,-ThF, are cooled slowly from the liquid
state, equilibrium is rarely, if ever, achieved. In compositions C-127,
-133 (or C-11l1a), and BelT-15, solids have been routinely observed in

the cooled melts which are indicative of nonequilibrium cooling.®:66

solid solution composition lies within the system LiF-UF,-ThF,. Each of
the solid solutions in this system, however, may be formed from mixtures
of two end members and in this sense is a binary series.

3.11 The System LiF- Ee (Selected Portions)

 

Detailed phase equilibrium studies for an entire quaternary system
require such a vast amount of time and money that they are usually com-
pleted over a number of years if at all. The system LiF-BeF,-~-UF,-ThF,
is no exception in this respect, and consequently the experimental work

was directed toward compositions which posses sufficiently low liquidus

and viscosity values to te of © project interest.

 
 
  

and the systens LiF-BeF,-ThF, and IiF- ~BeF2-

ve been atscussed in Sees 3. 2, 3, 5, and 3.8 of this report. Within

 

the systems UF,~ThF,, and LiF- -UF,~ThF,, extensive solid solutions are formed
between corresponding compounds. The existence of these similar systems

and of solid solutions between analogous compounds leads to the hypothesis

   

 
 

 

40

that UF, and ThF, are very nearly interchangeable in the quaternary mix-

tures with respect to their liquidus values and that the phase relation-

ships in the quaternary system will be very much like those in the ternary

systems LiF-BeF,~ThF, and LiF-BeF,-UF,. Four sections of constant mole
per cent LiF and BeF, were studied experimentally as a means of partially
verifying this hypothesis. These sections contain 70 LiF and 10 BeF,,
67.5 IiF and 17.5 BeF,, 70 LiF and 6 BeF,, and 65 LiF and 25 BeF, (mole
%). The first two sections include the compositions C-136 and BeLT-15
(see Appendix C). The experimental results of these experiments may be
found in Table 11. The liquidus values along the first three joins are
nearly linear functions of the composition (Figs. 30-32). The deviation
from linearity in the fourth join (Fig. 33) is in the direction of lower
liquidus temperatures. The ThF,-containing end member has the maximum
liquidus temperature for all the joins, while the UF-containing end
member has the minimum liquidus temperature for three of the four joins.
The solid solution 7LiF-6(U,Th)F, is the primary phase for all the com-
positions on the joins listed above. The interchangeability of UF, and
Th¥, implies that a breeder blanket selected from the quaternary system
or its limiting systems will contain the maximum concentration of ThE,
for a given temperature only if no UF, is present. In other words, if
UF, is added an approximately equal amount of ThF, must be removed to
maintain the same liquidus temperature.

Mixtures containing a maximum amount of ThF, for a given temperature
are found in the system IiF-BeF,-ThF, (Figs. 9-11) up to 568°C. Above
568° the mixtures must contain no BeF,; thus they will be binary mixtures
of LiF and ThF,.

The members of a second series contain a small total mole percentage
of UF, and ThF,; (Table 11). They represent the breeder fuels, such as
C-134, BULT 4-0.5U, and BULT 4-1U. Compositions containing up to 5 mole

% UF, + ThF, in the range 30-38 mole % BeF, have liquidus values close to

those of the system LiF-BeF,. These compositions differ from the LiF-
~~ BeF, binary mixtures in that their liquidus values are slightly lower

and solid solutions containing UF, and Th¥, precipitate as primary or

The uncertainty indicates the temperature difference between the quenched samples.

Oon1y phases found in major quantity are given.

Minor quantities of other phases resulting from

lack of complete reaction between solids or from trace amounts of oxide impurities are not noted.
Glasses or poorly formed crystals assumed to have been produced during rapid cooling of liquid were
found in those samples for which the observed phase is indicated as "liquid."

L = liquid.

Appi ternary mixture is included here because its liquidus temperature, as measured at ORNL, dif-
fers somewhat from that found on the Mound Laboratory diagram for the system LiF-UF,-BeF, (Fig. 7).

cooled melts cannot be relied upon to yield subsolidus equilibrium data.
Supercooling is also observed and so affects the thermal analysis that
this technique for studying heterogeneous equilibria cannot be used for
the system LiF- ~UF,- ThF ,-BeF -

salt reactor might be increased by adding the eutectic mixture of LiF
and UF, .%° Consequently, phase relationships in the quaternary section
between 73 LiF—27 UF, and 64.75 LiF—4.15 ThF,~31.1 BeF, have been inves-
tigated. This join contains the fuel mixture 65 LiF-30 BeF,—4 ThF,—1

ing 73 LiF-27 UF, and 64.75 LiF—4.15 ThF,~31.1 BeF,. The results of
