FOREWORD

The Subcommittee on Radiochemistry is one of a number of
subcommittees working under the Committee on Nuclear Science
within the National Academy of Sclences - Nationel Research
Council. Ite members represent government, industrial, and
university laboratories in the areas of radiochemigtry and
nuclear chemistry. Support for the activities of this and
other subcommittees of the Committee on Nuclear Science is
provided by a grent from the National Science Foundation.

The Subcommittee has concerned 1tself with preparation of
publications, encouraging and supporting activities in nuclear
education, sponsoring symposia on selected current topics in
radiochemistry and nuclear chemistry, and investigating special
problems as they arise. A series of monographs on the radio-
chemistry of essentimlly all the elements and on radiochemical
techniques is being published. Initiation end encouragement
of publication of articles on nuclear education in various
subject areas of chemistry have occurred, and development and
improvement of certain educational mctivities (e.g., laboratory
and demonstration experiments with radioactivity) have been
encoureged and assisted. Radioactive contamination of reagents
end materials has been investigated and specific recommendations
mede.

This series of monographs has resulted from the need for
comprehensive compilations of radiochemical and nuclear chemical
information. Each monogreph collecte in one volume the pertinent
information required for radlochemical work with an individual
element or with a specialized technique. The U. S. Atomic Energy
Commission hes sponsored the printing of the series.

Comments and suggestions for further publications and

activities of value to persons working with redicactivity are
welcomed by the Subcommittee.

PREFACE

This report has been prepared as one of a series of monographs on the radio-
chemistry of the elements for the Subcommitte on Radiochemistry of the Committee
on Nuclear Science within the National Academy of Sciences. There is included a
review of the nuclear and chemical features of plutonium of particular interest to
the radiochemist, a discussion of sample dissolution and counting techniques, and
finally, a collection of radiochemical procedures for plutonium.

The literature search was completed approximately through September 1964.
It is hoped that the bibliography is sufficiently extensive to serve the needs of the
radiochemist, but it is to be expected that important references were omitted.
The author would appreciate being made aware of such omissions, that they might
be included in possible future editions of this monograph.

The author wishes to express thanks to Dr. Earl Hyde, for the loan of his
extensive card file on the radiochemistry of plutonium, to Carl Wensrich and the
staff of the LRL Librery who greatly assisted in the literature search, to Mrs.
Shauna Ness who typed the first draft, and to Mrs. Vivian R. Mendenhall who
competently edited the final draft and prepared the bibliography.

Finally the author thanks his colleagues at the Lawrence Radiation Laboratory,
especially Dr. R. W. Hoff, for reading and criticizing the manuscript, and Dr.

P. C. Stevenson for his continued interest and support during the writing of this
monograph.

IV. CHEMISTRY OF PLUTONIUM OF SPECIAL INTEREST TO THE RADIOCHEMIST
A. Metallic Plutonium

A.1 Preparation

Plutonium metal is most commonly prepared by the reduction of a halide by a more
electropositive metal such as calcium. Connor has compared various combinations
of halide and reducing metal and found that the only satisfactory reactions were PuF,,
PuF , and PuCl, reduced with Ca metal. Harmon and Reag4 and Orth308 have
discussed the conversion of Pu salts to metal on an industrial scale, while Anselin,

et a1.%0 describe a method for the conversion on a gram scale.

A.2 Physical Properties

Pu is a typically silver-white appearing metal which has a number of peculiar
physical properties. The metal undergoes a total of five allotropic modifications
below the melting point, two of which have negative coefficients of thermal expansion.

Table IV-1 summarizes the more important physical properties.

A.3 Chemical Properties

Pu is a very reactive metal. The potential for the couple Pu = Putt +e is
2.03 volts, which places it between scandium (Sc) and thorium (Th) in the EMF series
of elements. Pu oxidizes more readily than does U, and resembles cerium (Ce) in its
reactions in air. Superficial oxidation of a freshly prepared surface occurs in a few
hours in normal air. The oxide is more or less adherent, and in several days the
oxidation reaction accelerates until finally the oxidation to PuO, is complete. However,
the oxide coating protects the underlying metal in dry air, and the oxidation proceeds
more slowly. Pu metal is attacked at elevated temperatures by most gases; Ho. N,,
halogens, 50,, etc. Pumetal dissolves easily and rapidly in modérately concentrated
HCI and other halogen acids.

Pu forms intermetallic compounds with intermediate solid solutions with most

metallic elements. However, simple eutectic mixtures are usually made with the group -

Va and Va ‘metals, and very little solubility in either the liquid or solid state is ex-
hibited by alkali and alkaline earth metals.

The behavior of Pu toward various solutions is given in Table IV-2.

B. Compounds of Pu

Pu forms compounds with a large number of elements. Compounds of Pu in the
II through VI oxidation states are known. Cunningham,” and Faugeras and Heuberger!28
describe the preparation and properties of those compounds which have been prepared.
Gel'man, et a1.3 ernphasize the data on complex compounds and attempt to systematize
the data by relating the structures and coordination numbers of the complex compounds
to other actinide elements, as well as to other regions of the periodic table.

The compounds of the III, IV and VI oxidation states are the ones with which the
radiochemist deals, and the insoluble compounds are of primary interest. Of these
the insoluble hydroxides, fluorides, and oxalates, phosphates and peroxides of the
IO and IV states are of major interest in precipitation and co-precipitation reactions
and are described in more detail in that section. One of the great complicating
factors in Pu chemistry is the formation of a polymeric form by hydrolysis in dilute
acid or neutral solutions. The polymeric form can be quite intractable in many reactions,
and may be difficult to destroy. The section on hydrolytic reactions of Pu gives
details,

Table IV-3 lists solubility information for the more stable Pu compounds which
have been prepared.

C. Plutonium Ions in Solution

C.1 Oxidation States
Plutonium in aqueous solution exists in the +3, +4, +5, or +6 oxidation states,
resembling both uranium (U), neptunium (Np) and americinm (Am) in this respect.

The formal oxidation potential diagrams for Pu in acid and basic solution are

taken from Latimer, 220

Formal oxidation potentials for Pu couples in various 1 M solutions are shown in
Table IV-4. The displacements of the potentials are due to the complex-forming
tendencies of the anions with Pu,

Pu(IIT)-Pu(IV) Pu(IV)-Pu(VI) Pu(dI)-Pu(VI) Pu(V)-Pu(VI)

HNO, -0,92 -1.05 -1,04 0 =e
H,50, -0.74 -1.2-14 ~~  ----- —--e-

 

The lower oxidation states become more stable in the actinide series from U to
Am, and correspondingly the higher oxidation states become more difficult to attain. -
* This effect is illustrated in Table IV-5, which shows the free energies of formation

of various actinide ions,
TABLE IV-5. Free Energy of Formation of Actinide Ions (kcal/mole)

 

 

Mt Mt MO; moj"
U -124.4 . -138.4 -237.6 -236.4
Np -128.4 -124.9 -221.0 -194.,5
Pu -140.5 -118.2 -204.9 -183.5
Am -160.5 -110.2 (-194.5) -156.7

 

Thus the most stable +3 ion in this series is Am while the most stable +6 ion is
vo,’ Pu is the first member of this series in which the tripositive state is stable
enough in aqueous solution to be useful in separation chemistry.

This fact is of supreme importance in the radiochemistry of Pu, since Pu can be
selectively maintained in either the +3 or +4 oxidation states in separation schemes.
Advantage is taken of this ability in many of the collected procedures in section VI.

The oxidation-reduction behavior of Pu is complicated by several factors:
3

>

(1) Puo?, disproportionates into putt and PuO, and under certain conditions Pu’
putt PuO,, and PuO, can all exist in equilibrium; put? is a small, highly
charged ion and therefore undergoes extensive hydralysis at low acidity and forms
many stable complex ions. This tendency is a dominant feature of Pu(IV) chemistry.
Pu(lV) forms a long-chain compound or polymer by hydrolytic reactions. Pu(IV)
polymer is one of the more unpleasant aspects of Pu chemistry from the standpoint of

Table IV-6 lists reagents and conditions to effect changes in oxidation state for
Pu ions. It must be emphasized that a relatively small change in conditions may -
produce a large change in the equilibrium, and that some of the oxidation-reduction
reactions may proceed beyond those listed. Therefore, the listed reactions should
be taken as a guide only.

In general, the change in oxidation state between +3 and +4 is rapid, since only
one electron is involved in this change. Similarly PuO}, and PuO," changes are rapid.
Changes in the oxidation state of Pu which involve the making or breaking of a Pu-O

bond are usually slower. However, Hindman, 1 84

in a general review of the kinetics of
actinide oxidation-reduction reactions, gives examples of reactions involving M-O
bonds which proceed as rapidly as some involving only electron transfer. Newton and

Rabideau 02 have also reviewed the kinetics of actinide oxidation-reduction reactions.
C.3 Disproportionation Reactions

 

The potentials of the various Pu couples are such that appreciable quantities of
several oxidation states may exist in equilibrium, Pu(IV) and Pu(V) are both unstable
with respect to disproportionation into higher and lower oxidation states in weakly
acid, uncomplexed media. There are several important equilibria which must be

considered for an understanding of Pu oxidation-reduction chemistry.

Appreciable quantities of Pu(Ill), Pu(IV),
and Pu(VI) cannot exist together in HoSO4
solutions.
These data show that strong influence of the anionic medium on the equilibrium.
The equilibrium is shifted markedly to the left even at these low ionic strengths by the
strong complexes formed by Pu(IV). Conversely, the equilibrium is shifted to the right by
lowering the concentration of the acid and complex forming anion, atleast until the onset of
hydrolysis at pH 1-1.5. The hydrolytic reactions again stabilize Pu(IV).

The disproportionation reaction probably occurs as a series of bimolecular reactions.

According to Connick and McVey, 100 the reaction path may be
oputt = pu’3 + PuO,’ (Slow)
PuO, + put = Puo, + put? (Fast)

The first reaction is slow because Pu-O bond formation is involved, while the second
reaction only requires electron transfer. The rate of the first reaction is second-
order in Pu(IV) concentration and inverse third-order in gh concentration, The

following reaction sequence is consistent with these discrepancies

Pu + H,0 = Puon™ + HB"
PuOH"? + H,0 = PuOH);* + HY
PuOH"? + Puom),;" = Pu"? + Pu + H,0 + HY
Crocker !08 determined the relative amount of each oxidation state present over a

wide range of temperature and HINOg concentration, He found that the minimum
concentration of HNOj to prevent formation of Pu(VI) in a 4 X 1073 M Pu(IV) solution
is 1.5 M, while at 98°C the required concentration of acid is 8 M.

The second important equilibrium is the disproportionation of Pu(V), which is
unstable in moderately acid solution with respect to the reaction

2 Pu(V) = Pu(IV) + Pu(VI)

Connick?® describes this overall reaction as proceeding by either of the two slow
reactions

(a) 2 Puo, + 4H" = putt +

+ PuO,, + 2H,0

(8) Puo) + Putd + an’ = aputt 4 2H,0

2

14
followed by the fast reaction
© Puo) + Put? = Puo," + Put?

Reactions A and B involve the breaking of Pu-O bonds, while C does not. Reaction A
is probably only important until sufficient Putd is formed for reaction B to occur,
since B is kinetically more probable than A.

These disproportionation reactions may be involved in oxidation-reduction
reactions by other reagents. Instead of direct oxidation or reduction, the
disproportionation reaction can occur first, followed by direct oxidation or reduction

of the appropriate product.

C.4 Radiolytic Reduction of Pu Solutions

 

The alpha particles emitted in the decay of pu23®

um to decompose solutions of Pu?3d by radiolysis. The radiolysis products then oxidize

supply enough energy to the medi-

or reduce the Pu, depending on the nature of the solution and the oxidation state of °
the Pu. This effect was first described by Kasha and Sheline 213 who noticed 0.6%
reduction of Pu(VI) to Pu(IV) per day in perchloric acid solution which was independent
of acidity over a range 0.1 to 2 M. The rate of reduction in HCl was considerably
less. In both cases the reaction is slow enough to allow the equilibrium quantities
of the various oxidation states to be present. The reduction of Pu(VI) probably
proceeds first to Pu(V), and the lower states obtained by disproportionation of this
ion.
Rabideau
rates of HClO4 and HCl reduction and found that the situation is complicated by the
production of CL™ in HClO4 solutions and Clg in HCI solutions. Also, if Br is added

a1 326

confirmed the above qualitative results concerning the relative

to HC1O4 solutions, a net oxidation instead of reduction occurs if the mean oxidation
number is initially approximately 4.

~308

Pages 309

and Pages and Haissinsky found that the rate of reduction depended
very strongly on the nature of the anion in a study of external gamma-radiation
induced reduction of Pu(VI). The rates of reduction decreased in the order

ClO, ¥ SO, >Cl >> NOg. These results presumably also apply to auto-reduction
by alpha particles,

Popov et 21.320

on the other hand found only oxidation by irradiation of HNOg
_ solutions of Pu with external x-radiation. . The rate of oxidation decreased with an
increase of NOg and total acidity.
The lesson to the radiochemist is clear: The stated oxidation states of old Pu
solutions, particularly low acidity HClO, and HyS0, solutions, should be viewed

with suspicion.

C.5 Hydrolytic Reactions of Plutonium

Pu in all of its oxidation states exists in aqueous solutions as highly charged ions

 

and therefore undergoes hydrolysis reactions in dilute acid solutions. The tendencies
for these ions to undergo hydrolysis is dependent on the charge and ionic radius. The
tendency thus increases with increasing atomic number for all the oxidation states

of the actinide series and in the case of Pu increases in the order Puo, < Putt cputt,

15
Putt has approximately the same tendency to hydrolyze as ce but less than that of
met and zrte,

The constant for the first displacement of a proton from the hydration sphere,
along with the solubility product for the hydroxide of the various Pu ions, is given in

Table IV-8. Inthe case of puts and Pud, the hydrolysis reaction may be written

n+ _ (n-1)+ +.
Pu (H,0), + H,O = PuOH (Hy 0) + H,;0 ;

or in the case of Pu,"

radius, showing the effect of the highly charged central Pu ion.

C.6 Pu(IV) Polymer

By far the most important hydrolytic reaction from a radiochemical standpoint
is the formation of colloidal aggregates in Pu(IV) solutions by successive hydrolysis
reactions. The polymer presumably forms with oxygen or hydroxyl bridges and the
reaction is apparently irreversible. Pu(OH), forms when the reaction proceeds to
completion. In intermediate stages, however, the colloid remains in solution and has
properties markedly different from those of the free ion. In macro concentrations the
color of a 0.3 M HNO, solution changes from brown to bright green when the solution
is heated. The adsorption spectra of polymer has an entirely differerit character than
monomeric Pu(IV) solutions.

The polymer can be formed from many solutions. The formation of Pu(IV)
polymer is favored by an increase in the Pu concentration and temperature or by a
decrease in the acidity, As the total nitrate concentration increases the polymer

- 104

precipitates, up to a maximum at 2-3 M NOg4 . The presence of strong complexing

anions inhibit the formation of polymer. Nevertheless, the presence of polymeric Pu

should be suspected whenever the acid concentration is below 0.5 m.3%7

Polymer is
formed when solutions are diluted with water because of the existence of transient
regions of high pH, even though the final acidity may be high enough to prevent formation

327, 64

of the polymer. The polymer is algo formed by adding less than a stoichio-

metric quantity of acid in the dissolution of Pu(OH), precipitate. Fortunately, Pu(OH),

16
can be precipitated from originally monomeric solutions and redissolved without

239 Pu(lV) polymer may

appreciable formation of polymer by using excess reagents.
be completely precipitated from solution by much less than stoichiometric amounts
(approximately 0.15 equivalents of anion) of oxalate, iodate, and phosphate, for

example. This phenomenon indicates that the complex contains few charges. This

305 to remove ionic Pu from the colloidal

fact was utilized by Ockenden and Welch
form by means of cation exchange.

Depolymerization is very slow at room temperature in moderate acid concentra-
tions. The rate is increased by heating, stronger acid concentration, and addition of
strong complexing agents such as fluoride and sulfate.

Care must be taken to prevent the formation of Pu(IV) polymer in radiochemical
separations because of the very different chemical properties of the polymer. The
example of non-adsorption on cation exchange resin has already been given. The
Pu(lV) polymer does not extract into tri- n-butyl phosphate, (TBP), for example, but
does extract into di-n-butyl phosphoric acid, BP). 46 The formation of polymer in

solutions of diethylene glycol dibutyl ether (butex) has been observed. 407

104

Costanzo and Biggers have determined the rate of polymerization and de-

polymerization as a function of acidity, temperature, Pu concentration, and salt con-
centration. Miner?’ 8 has summarized information concerning the formation of
polymer in nitrate solutions. Both the above references give suggestions for the
avoidance of polymer formation in handling and shipping macro amounts of Pu.
Polymeric Pu(lV) adsorbs strongly onto glass, paper, etc., indicating that it is
positively charged. v8 Saturation on glass occurs at approximately 1 ug/ cm®.

Samartsevas i) found that the adsorption is greater on silica than on glass, that 5 to 8

hours was necessary to reach equilibrium with 1078 to 5 X 10710 M Pu(IV) solutions,
and that adsorbtion on glass was reversible at pH < 4,
The adsorption of Puy)? and (v)346

aqueous solution. It was found that from 1% to 4% of the Pu{IV) can adsorb on a Pt
399

on platinum (Pt) has been studied from

surface from organic extractants such as TBP, tri-n-octylamine, (TOA), etc.
Increasing the concentration of the extractant or the aqueous nitric acid phase in

equilibrium with the organic phase decreased the adsorption.

C.7 Complex Ion Formation

The formation of complex ions in aqueous solutions with anionic ligands is an
important feature of the aqueous chemistry of Pu, Complex formation and hydrolysis
are competing reactions and may be looked upon as the displacement of the H,O
molecules in the hydration sphere by the anionic ligand or by OH , respectively. The
ability of an ion to form complexes is dependent on the magnitude of the ionic potential

which may be defined by the equation
d=z/r.

z is the charge on the ion and r is the ionic radius. The values of the ionic potentials

of Pu in different oxidation states are given in Table IV-8,

*After Gelman et al. 3

The relative tendency of Pu ions to form complexes then is
Pu(IV) > Pu(lll) > Pu(VI) > Pu(V)

Gel' man et al. 3 show that the anionic ligand has some effect on this series.
For example, the positions of Pu(III) and Pu(VI) are interchanged in the case of oxalate
complexes,

Singly charged anions form weaker complexes with actinides generally than do

multiply charged anions. The order of complex forming ability with some anions is
CO, > C,0 >80,>F > NOg > Cl > Clo, .

Tables IV-10, IV-11, and IV-12 list available stability constants for complexes of
Pu), Pu(v), Pu(V), and Pu(VI), respectively, which are based on the review of
Gel' man et al, 3 The chemigtiry of complex compounds and ions of the actinides was
also reviewed by Comyns?” Table IV-13 lists stability constants for some complexes

of several actinides for comparison.

D. Separation Methods

D.1 Co-precipitation and Precipitation

 

Co-precipitation and precipitation present different problems to the radiochemist
because, in general, the insoluble compounds of Pu which have desirable properties
in precipitation reactions are not those formed in co-precipitation reactions. Of the
and PuF, and co-precipitation of Pu(III)

3 4
and Pu(IV) by LaF, are analogous. Since the radiochemist is likely to have small or

common reactions, only precipitation of PuF

trace quantities of Pu in a relatively large volume, co-precipitation reactions are more

important to him, and will be considered first.

Co-precipitation
Co-precipitation reactions are extremely important in the radiochemistry
of Pu. Indeed, the first separation and isolation of the element was accomplished by
co-precipitation with LaF. This method has become the "classic' radiochemical
method for Pu and is still widely used.

The co-precipitation behavior of Np and Pu toward a number of precipitants is
shown in Table IV-14, taken from the review of Hyde. 8 The behavior of these elements
is representative ‘of the actinides in a given oxidation state. The possibility of separa-
tion arises when the elements can be maintained in separate oxidation states, and a
selective precipitant is used. The review of Bonner and Kahn*® gives a thorough
discussion of the mechanism of co-precipitation and a good review of co-precipitation
data for all the elements through 1948. The co-precipitation behavior of Pu has been
discussed by Leader.2%3

The separation of Pu by co-precipitation usually takes advantage of the afore-
mentioned oxidation and reduction cycles to effect purification. The procedure may be
illustrated with the carrying of Pu(IlI) and Pu(IV) and the non-carrying of Pu(VI) on
LaF,. Only those elements with co-precipitation and oxidation-reduction behavior
very similar to that of Pu interfere. The oxidation-reduction cycle may be repeated
as many times as needed to get any desired degree of purity. The use of LaF, pre-
cipitation is also a valuable group separation and volume reduction step, since not
very many elements have acid-insoluble fluorides.

In many radiochemical procedures, LaFg is mounted for alpha counting to

determine the Pu. 19%, 83, 82, 446

Chenley et a1.5% report a 2.6 % negative bias by this
method because of absorption of the alpha particles in the LaF. This bias is a
function of the thickness of the counting sample and must be determined for each pro-
cedure.

Calcium is one of the elements which interferes with LaF, co-precipitation,
since the fluoride is moderately insoluble. One method of solving the problem of high
Ca concentrations (>200 mg/1) is reported by Scheidhauer and Messainguiral. >>! The
Pu is oxidized to Pu(VI) and CaF, is precipitated away from the Pu. Following re-

duction, the Pu can either be co~precipitated or separated by other means.

of the process is reported by Thompson and Seaborg.

peculiarity is the fact that Pu(IV) is more efficiently carried than Pu(III). The optimum
conditions for the co-precipitation of Pu have been reported by Adamson.2? These are:
1) co-precipitation at the minimum BiPO, solubility, 2) the absence of strong com-
plexing agents, 3) slow precipitation, and 4) minimum digestion after precipitation is
complete.

In addition to being very successful in the large scale processing Pu, BiPO, pre-
cipitations have been used in general radiochemical procedures® +! 415

Other inorganic co-precipitants. Dupetit and Aten! described the co-

 

precipitation of actinides with thorium peroxide and uranium peroxide. All the elements
were in the tetravalent oxidation state. They found, that in general, the crystal type
made little difference in the co-precipitation of these elements. For example, Pu carried
equally well with thorium peroxide, which has a similar crystal structure to plutonium
peroxide, and with uranium peroxide which has a different structure.

A mixture of Pu(Ill) and Pu(IV) has been carried on lanthanum iodate from dilute
HCl solution.293

Plutonium can be separated directly from a urine sample by co-precipitation with

calcium ammonium phosphate. 102, 74

Pu(IV) and Am(IIT) have been quantitatively co-precipitated with K,La(s0,),,
and Pu(IV) and Np(IV) have been separated by precipitation of the Pu from solutions

Precipitation
Precipitation of macro quantities of Pu is necessary in many analytical
and radiochemical procedures. The precipitation reactions which have been found
useful in practice will be reviewed in this section. The use of various precipitates as
purification steps for Pu is illustrated by Table IV-15, which gives decontamination

431

factors for Pu from Fe, Co, Zr, Mo, Ru, and Ce. As usual, Zr and Ru give the

most trouble.

Hydroxide. Both Pu(Ill) and Pu(IV) may be precipitated from mineral acid
solution by sodium, potassium or ammonium hydroxide as hydrated hydroxides or
hydrous oxides. Care must be taken in redissolving Pu(IV) hydroxide in acid to pre-
vent formation of Pu(IV) polymer, by maintaining a high acid concentration during the
dissolution. Once formed, the polymer dissolves very slowly in acid solutions. This

subject is treated more fully in the section on polymeric Pu(IV).

Fluoride. PuF, and PuF4 may be precipitated from acid solution by
addition of excess HF. Prevot et al.32% found that PuF, forms a more tractable,
crystalline precipitate than does PuF,. The compound is stable to oxidation if the

compounds dissolve readily in reagents which complex fluoride ion, such as HBO,
but if heated to 500° dissolve only with difficulty. Metathesis to the hydroxide with
sodium or potassium hydroxide is another method of solution. Jones? found that
PuF, was suitable for use as a gravimetric standard for Pu, at least for a period of
several months. This method has not been widely used, however. It is interesting to
note that PuO,, prepared by ignition of this PuF, at 500°C in oxygen was readily soluble
in nitric acid, in contrast to the findings of other workers. This solubility is attrib-

uted to the extremely fine particle size of PuO, prepared in this work.

Peroxides. Pu(IV) peroxide is formed when hydrogen peroxide is added to
acid solutions of Pu(III), Pu(IV), Pu(V), and Pu(VI), because H,0, can act as both an
oxidant and a reductant. Pu(IV) peroxide always incorporates some of the anion pres-
ent into the crystalline precipitate. It has been suggested" that the presence of the

anion is due to a more or less random placement between sheets of Pu and peroxide

27
oxygen in the ratio 1:3. If an excess of peroxide is used in the precipitation, the
ratio may be lower. The extra peroxide also serves to hold the sheets together.
Precipitation of plutonium peroxide has been used as a purification step for Pu

72,158, 329, 425

from most other cations and as a step in the preparation of high purity

Pu compounds and solutions. 329 This precipitation has been used to separate Pu from
Am, the Am remaining in the supernatant solution, 2 and to separate Pu and u.277 In
the latter procedure the Pu was oxidized to Pu(VI) by potassium bromate which served
as a holding oxidant, and uranyl peroxide precipitated. Separation factors of 2-4

were obtained.

The oxalate is decomposed into carbonate and CO,

Other compounds. The precipitation of plutonium (IV) sulfate tetrahydrate

has been used to prepare a high purity Pu compound for use as a gravimetric standard

424

for Pu. Starting with a grossly impure solution, a product of 99.98% purity was

obtained after five successive recrystallizations. This compound is suitably stable as -
a gravimetric standard at least for 18-months, 448

Dicesium plutonium (IV) hexachoride has also been proposed as a primary
gravimetric standard.?'® The compound can be prepared by precipitation from an 8

M HCI solution of Pu(IV) by addition of CsCl in HCI.

D.2 Solvent Extraction Methods

 

The large-scale processing of reactor targets is largely done by liquid-liquid
extraction. This is so because of a combination of desirable properties of this
method; for example, great specificity for U and Pu, easy adaptability to remote
handling facilities, etc. These advantages are easily carried over to laboratory
separations where specificity and ease of handling are equally important.

A very great deal of research on liquid-liquid extraction systems for Pu has
been carried out in the development of large-scale processes, and a large portion of
the solvent extraction data reported in this section was taken under the spur of the
seemingly never-ending quest for more specific extractants, better radiation stability,
and the like. The basic data on the extractive properties of a given solvent are, of
course, equally applicable in the laboratory or industrial situation.

The general principles of solvent extraction have been put forth in the book by
Morrison and Freiser, 222 and in a comprehensive review by Marcus.287 The solvent

28
In this section the data will most often be given in terms of the distribution
coefficient D, which is defined by the equation

D = concentration of the solute in the organic phase
concentration of the golute in the aqueous phase

 

To save space, the notation "D_" for "the distribution coefficient of species x" will

be used in the text.

Organo Phosphorous Compounds

 

This large and important class of extractants includes the neutral and
acidic esters of ortho phosphoric acid and related compounds, the phosphonates,
phosphinates and phosphine oxides. The class divides naturally into neutral and
acidic compounds by the differences in extraction mechanism. The neutral compounds
extract by solvation of a neutral complex in the organic phase by the phosphoryl
oxygen, while the acidic compounds, in general, operate by an ion-exchange reaction
to form an extractable species. Further solvation may occur in the organic phase in

some extraction systems of this type.

Neutral Compounds

Tri-n-butylphosphate (TBP), (C4HyO)zPO, will serve as the typical
compound of this type. A complete survey of the literature on TBP extraction of Pu
ig beyond the scope of this review. The more recent papers will be emphasized,
although earlier project work will necessarily be included. A summary of early work

143

on TBP has been given by Geary. The physical and chemical properties of TBP

2
as an extracting agent have been summarized by McKay and Healy. 59 The TBP-nitrate
system will be discussed first, followed by other aqueous systems, and finally other

neutral organo-phosphorous compounds.

TBP-nitrate systems. Hesford and McKay! ™8 have formulated the ex-

traction reaction of metal nitrates into TBP as
+p - = .
M" +p NOs +q TBP, = M (NO), q TBP, (1)

where p is the charge on the metal ion and q is the number of TBP molecules solvating
the nitrate molecule in the organic phage. The subscript (0) refers to species in the
organic phase, and species withoit subscripts are in the aqueous phase. The equilib-

rium constant, neglecting activity coefficients, is then

Under constant aqueous conditions, and at a sufficient dilution of TBP in an. inert

diluent to make Eq. (2) valid, the distribution will be proportional to the qth power of

system on a semi-empirical basis and obtained good agreement with experimental data.

The distribution coefficients rises steeply at low nitric acid

concentrations because of the strong salting-out effect of the nitrate ion (Eq. 1),

passes through a maximum, and then falls at higher acid concentrations.

Some

elements (e. g. Th and Y) pass through minima and rise again.

Several other studies of the ex-
traction of Pu from nitric acid solutions
have been reported. Carleson'® used
40% TBP in kerosene and paid partic-
ular attention to requirements to main-
tain Pu in the desired oxidation state.

He found that NaNO4 was necessary to
prepare pure Pu(IV) from an equilibrium
disproportionated mixture. Figure 2
shows the effect of HNO, concentration
on several reducing agents in the ex-
traction of an equilibrium Pu solution,
and the extraction curve for Pu(III)
alone. Ferrous sulfamate with added
hydroxylamine effects complete re-
duction of Pu(IV) to Pu(IllI) at up to 2 M
HNO,, but fails at higher acidities.
Ferrous ion plus hydrazine and hydrox-
ylamine fail to complete the reduction
at progressively lower acidities.
Carleson algo found that solid KBrO,
did not oxidize Pu(IV) to Pu(VI) in 1.55
M HNO, at room temperature, but that
the oxidation was quantitative in 0.1 M
BrOy after heating to 95°C for several
hours.

Moiseenko and Rozen2o! measured the effect of temperature on the extraction of
Pu(IV) as a function of nitric acid concentration and uranyl nitrate concentration (Figs.
3,4, and 5). In the absence of uranyl nitrate the distribution coefficient decreases with
temperature below 5 M HNO,, while at higher acidities it increases. This effect is
explained by a decrease in the equilibrium constant for the distribution reaction with
temperature, with a compensating increase in the activity coefficient of Pu(IV) at higher
acidities. This increase is ascribed to a decreased association of Pu(IV) with nitrate
ions at higher temperatures. Shevchenko and Federov- 0% have studied the same system
at nitric acid concentrations below 4 M with similar results.

Best et al. *3 "measured the distribution of several tripositive actinides and
lanthanides from nitric acid solutions into 100% TBP. Some of their data are shown
in Fig. 6 plotted as a function of atomic number, along with the lanthanide data of
Hesford et a1. 177 for comparison. The curves for the two homologous series are
approximately superimposable if adjustment is made to compare ions of the same radius.
This illustrates the importance of ionic radius on the chemical behavior of these
elements. )

U(VI) and stabilized by volatile reductants, with the considerable advantage in large-
scale processing plants of not introducing non-volatile materials (e.g. irom) into the
waste streams, thus permitting a smaller waste volume. The behavior of fission pro-

ducts and other elements in this process has received much attention, both in the primary

Other neutral phosphorous compounds. A wide variety of organo-phosphorous

 

compounds has been studied in an attempt tofind other extractants for Pu and U.
Higgins et 1.181 working with the butyl series found the order to be phosphate
((RO)zPO) < phosphonate (R(RO), PO) < phosphinate (R,(RO)PO) < phosphine oxide
(RoPO). Thus the extracting power increases with the number of C-P bonds.

Burger?” "0contirmed this series and correlated the extracting power with the basisity

of the phosphoryl oxygen as measured by the P-O stretching frequency. Burger? 0
and Petrov et a1318 found that electronegative substituents in the alkyl chain such as Cl and
phenyl strongly depressed the extraction. Siddall 18 found that increasing the length of
the alkyl chain in the phosphate series made little difference up to 8 carbon atoms for
guadrivalent and hexavalent actinides. The effect of branching the alkyl chain is to in-
crease the extraction of U, Np, and Pu, but to strongly depress that of Th. This effect
is attributed to steric effects and possible tri-solvation of the Th complex at high ex-
tractant concentrations.

The extraction mechanism of these compounds is generally the same as that for

Trace quantities of U have been separated from large amounts of Pu by extracting

Table IV-16 is a compilation of data for the extraction of Pu(IV) by a large number
of compounds of this type. The extraction coefficients were converted to 1 M extract-
ant by using the ''square law," that is by assuming that the extracted complex is di-
solvated in every case. The distribution coefficients were taken at 1 M HNO, where
possible, but cases in which other ions were present or the acidity was different are
noted. The extractive power relative to TBP was calculated by direct comparison in the
same series of experiments where possible, or by comparison to other TBP data taken
under the same stated conditions. The conversion of the phosphine oxide data to 1 M
extractant generally required large extrapolations, since the experiments were done at
low extractant concentrations. For this reason the numerical values of the distribution

coefficients and the relative extractive power are only approximate.

Acidic Compounds

These compounds are the mono- and di-acidic esters of phosphoric
acid and related phosphonates and phosphinates. They have recieved considerable
attention in recent years during the search for more versatile or specific extractants.
In general, these compounds extract by an ion exchange type reaction analogous to
chelation. In many cases the chelate compound thus formed is further solvated in the
organic phase. For example the extracted complex in the extraction of Th(IV) with
bis-2-ethylhexyl phosphoric acid from several acids involves the anions such as NO, ,
C17, and possibly Clo, in extractions from the respective acids.312

Mono-acidic compounds. Di-n-butyl phosphoric acid (DBP) and bis-2-
ethylhexyl phosphoric acid (HDEHP) are the compounds that have received most
attention. They have been shown to be dimeric in the organic phase in a non-polar
solvent such as benzene ®The dimerization is presumably due to hydrogen bonding to
the phosphoryl oxygen. 130 The extraction reaction can be formulated as

In this equation, HA represents any monoacidic ester of phogphoric acid.

This equation has been shown to be correct for di- and trivalent ions, but tetra-
valent ions in general show a more complex behavior. The extracted complex is some-
times further solvated in the organic phase and nitrate, chloride, and even perchlorate
complexes may be involved in the extraction reaction, depending on the specific aqueous
conditions employed. Thus, no general reaction can be proposed which will account
for all of the observed behavior.

alkyl chain is increased from butyl to decyl, but that for 2-ethylhexyl is greater than
any of these. The non-linearity of the slope of these extraction curves is ascribed to
nitrate complexing in the extracted species. The acid dependency was determined by
extraction into HDEHP from HC10, solutions at a constant ionic strength of 1.0 and
found to be inverse first power in the region from approximately 0.05 to 1.0 M u'.
The Pu is probably extracted as a hydrolyzed species at low acid concentrations. The
distribution coefficient was found to vary directly as the square of the HDEHP con- -
centration.

curve at high acid concentrations is due to digproportionation of Np(V) into Np(IV) and
Np(VI), both of which are more extractable than Np(V). The minimum in the Am(TII)
“curve at high acid concentrations is probably due to nitrate complexing of the extracted
Am species.

Horner and Coleman!®” get a different result for the extraction of Pu(IV) by
HDEHP. As shown in Fig. 13, the extraction curve is concave downward with increasing
HNO4 concentration using 0.01 M HDEHP in Amsco 125-82. The magnijude of distribu-
tion coefficients are very much larger than those of Kosyakov et al., if the second
power dependence on the extractant concentration is taken into account. Another dif-
ference is the decreased distribution coefficient at 0.1 M acid. Horner and Coleman
ascribe this decrease to hydrolysis of the Pu(IV). Horner and Coleman prepared Pu(IV)
by reduction to Pu(IIl) with hydroxylamine nitrate, and reoxidation and stabilization
with sodium nitrite, while Kosyakov et a1238 did not state their method of preparation of
Pu(IV).

Dreze and Duyckaerts 2! investigated the extraction of Pu(IV) by di-n-butyl
phosphoric acid (HDBP) from nitrate solutions as a function of nitric acid concentration,
nitrate concentration, HDBP concentration, and ionic strength. Representative results
are shown in Figs. 14 and 15. These experimenters were able to invoke the known
stability constants of Pu(IV) nitrate complexes to fit the various functional dependencies.

They consider the extraction reaction to be

extensively studied of this type of compound. It is polymeric in the organic phase in

studied the extraction of Am(III), Pu(IV), Np(V), and U(VI)
by mono-2-ethylhexylphosphoric acid (H,MEHP) from nitric acid solutions with results
shown in Fig. 17. The distribution coefficients are in general higher for the same
aqueous conditions than those of HDEHP. Pu(IV) can be returned to the aqueous phase

by washing with a 5% solution of potassium oxalate.

Gindler et al. 146 used this method to purify pu236

for fission counting. The Np(IV) can
be returned to the aqueous phase by the addition of TBP to the organic phase, resulting
in a great reduction in the distribution coefficient because of anti-synergistic (or

antagonistic) effect of these reagents, (cf Mixed Extractants, p. 71).

Peppard et al.’ 11

used H,MEHP in various diluents, and tri-n-octyl phosphine
oxide to effect a sequential separation of various tri-, tetra-, and hexavalent ions from
urine.

314 used HDEHP to separate Bk from other tripositive actinides

Peppard et al.
and from Pu. The Bk is oxidized to Bk(IV} in 10 M HNO, by 1 M KBrOg and extracted
away from tripositive actinides. The Bk(IV) is then back extracted into 8 M HNO, by
reduction with H,0,. Pu is not reduced to Pu(III) under these conditions and remains

in the organic phase.

Amine Extractants

These compounds are long-chain alkyl or aryl primary, secondary, and
tertiary amines, and quaternary amine salts. Moore? 88 and Coleman et a1. have
given general reviews of the extraction of inorganic species by these compounds. The
amines react with acids to form an ion-association complex which is soluble in the

organic phase, illustrated by a tertiary amine

Much work has been done on Pu and other actinides with these compounds, in

process and analytical applications.

They have much higher distribution coefficients

than TBP for U and Pu(IV), and show much less deleterious effects on the distribution

due to high radiation fields because the radiolysis products do not interact with the

extractant to produce synergistic mixtures, (cf Mixed Extractants, p. 71).

The treatment here will be in the order nitrate, chloride, sulfate, and other.

The structure and nature of the amine exert a great influence on the extractability of Pu.

Nitrate Systems

The relative extractability of Pu in nitrate solutions is in the order

Puw(IV) > Pu(VI) > Pu(Ill) and the extractive power of the amines varies in the order

Keder et a1.219 reported the extraction
of geveral actinide elements from HNO,
solutions by tri-n-octylamine (TOA) diluted
with xylene. Their results for quadivalent
species are shown in Fig. 19 as a function of
HNO4 concentration. Pu(IV) and Np(IV) are
much more extractable than are Th and U.
These species show a second power depen-
dence on the amine concentration, indicating
that the extracted complex involves two amine
molecules. According to Eqs. 1 and 2, the
extracted complex involves the M(NOg)
anion and is (TOA), M(NOg), where M is any

quadrivalent actinide. No conclusions can
be drawn about the nitrate species in the

aqueous phase, however.

also determined the extraction properties of hexavalent, trivalent

and pentavalent actinides as a function of nitric acid concentration, with results shown

in Figs. 20 and 21. The maximum distribution coefficients for all these species is very

much less than for Pu(IV) and Np(IV), indicating an easy separation of these elements

from other actinide elements.

For the hexavalent species, the amine concentration

dependencies of the distribution coefficients were between first and second power, per-

mitting no unambiguous assignment of the extracted complex. The slope of the Am(III)

curve was unity, while that for Pu(III) was approximately 1.5. No explanation of this

fact was given.

Horner and Coleman®”

and Weaver and Horner +20 have determined the dis-

tribution coefficients of Pu(IV), Pw(III), and Pu(VI) for a number of amines from HNOg
solutions, with results shown in Figs. 22, 23, and 24. Their Pu(IV) results for unsalted

tri-n-octylamine (TOA) agree qualitatively with Keder et al.

219 and Baroncelli et 21,38 but

reach the maximum at a lower HNO4 concentration. The other classes of amines reach

a maximum at around 9 M HNO. The effect of salting with NaNO4 at a constant nitrate

concentration is to increase the distribution coefficient at lower acidities. Pu(III) and

Pu(VI) show very much lower distribution coefficients with all classes of amines (Fig.

23) although Al(NOg), salting raises the D py(111) to a relatively high value with tertiary

amines (Fig. 24).

Baroncelli et a1.36 measured the distribution of Pu(IV) between HNO4 solutions and

"tricaprylamine' (TCA, sold as "Alamine 336," a mixture of n-octyl and n-decyl-amines),

with similar results. The amine was diluted in "Solvesso 100," an aromatic naphtha.

The extraction reached a maximum of approximately D = 140 at 4 M HNO, and was

strongly depressed by the presence of macro uranyl ion, which saturates the extractant.

In experiments varying the concentration of the TCA the formation of the hexanitrato

Pu(IV) complex is confirmed, but the slope of the log D Pu vs log TCA curve is 1.4 in the

presence of 1.5 M uranyl ion. The corresponding slope for U is 1, indicating the for-

mation of a uranyl trinitrate complex.

amine," TLA) in an aromatic diluent (''Solvesso 100") and a paraffinic diluent ("Shellsol

5% nonanol to prevent formation of a third phase by increasing the solubility of the com-
plex in the organic phase. Valentini et al. 40% achieve maximum separation from U by
extracting Pu from 2 M HNO.

Other work with tertiary amine nitric acid systems with generally similar results
includes that of de Trentinian and Chesfie!18and Chesfie®* on TLA extraction of TL{IV), U(VI),
Np(IV), Np(VI) and Pu(IV); Knoch?32 and Knoch and Lindner2°} on tri-iso-octylamine

solutions by NH, OH: HCI solutions, in contrast to expectations. Valentini et a1,409 used
1M H,S0, to strip Pu(IV) from TLA with good results.

Several processes for the separation of Pu and U from irradiated U using tertiary
amines have been proposed. Wilson 2? used TLA + 2% Octanol in kerosene to extract
Pu(IV) from 4 M HNO,
Chesne et a1.8 used the same extraction system, but stripped the Pu(IV) by a HNO4-H,SO,
409 used the TLA-HNOg4 gystem.

The fact that Pu(IIT) does not extract into tertiary amines has been made the
basis of a Np-Pu separation. 27 The Np is extracted as Np(IV) away from Pu(III) in a
nitric acid solution.

Winchester and Maraman®3! made a study of the decontamination of Pu in an ex-
perimental pyrometallurgical laboratory from Fe, Co, Zr, Mo, Ru, and Ce by both
TBP and amine extraction. A summary of their results in terms of decontamination
factors for Pu is given in Table IV-17. They concluded that the best separation of Pu
from these metals was obtained in the secondary amine system and described a batch
equilibration process for recovery of Pu on a 300-gram scale in a metallurgical
laboratory. }

The Pu and U complexes have limited solubility in the organic phase, and
separate as a third phase at high metal concentration. The addition of a small fraction
of polar constituent, e.g. octanol, into the organic phase, increases the solubility of
the extracted complex. Baroncelli et al.3% have made a study of this effect, and also
of the effect of nitrous acid added to stabilize quadrivalent Pu. They found that nitrous
acid can have either an enhancing or depressing effect on the distribution coefficient,
depending on the nitric acid concentration, while the long chain alcohol always has a
depressing effect. At equal molar nitrous acid and alcohol concentration in the organic
phase, the distribution coefficient is at a maximum. This effect is explained in terms

of the formation of an alcohol-nitrous acid complex in the organic phase.

Maeck et a1.262 determined the distribution of a large number of elements for

quaternary ammonium compounds between various aqueous solutions and methylisobutyl
ketone (""hexone'). The aqueous solutions considered were NaOH, HNO, H,30,, HCI,

52
and HF. No extraction of Pu(IV) or Pu(VI) was found at any concentration of H,80,,
NaOH, and HF. The results for HNO, and HCI are given in Figs. 25 and 26 as percent
extractions from equal phase volumes as a function of aqueous acidity in the form of
periodic tables. Berkman and Kaplan? found that tetrabutylammonium nitrate (TBAN)
added to Pu(IV) extracted into hexone caused the formation of a hexanitrate Pu(IV)
species, while in the absence of TBAN the tetranitrate appears to be stable. A pro-
cedure for radiochemical determination of Np and Pu based on this extraction system
using aluminum nitrate as a salting agent has been developed by Maeck et 21.281 They
report a better decontamination from fission products, particularly Zr, than is ob-
tainable in other amine systems.

The quaternary amine "Hyamine 1622" has been used to extract Pu(IV) from HNO,

solutions as part of an analytical procedure for pu. 48

Chloride Systems

Pw(IV) and Pu(VI) extract well from HCI solutions by amines, while
Pu(Ill) is poorly extracted, in analogy with the strong base anion exchange system.
Plutonium chloride systems have found application mainly in analytical and radio-

distribution coefficients on HCl concentration is shown in Figs. 27 and 28. In every
case, the slope of the log D vs log TOA concentration curve is near 2, indicating that
the extracted complex has two TOA molecules for both valence states. Pu(IV) is much
more extractable than is Np(IV) and U(IV) under the same conditions. The hexavalent
actinides are more extractable than the tetravalent in this system.

Niobium and ruthenium extracted to some extent, but separation from these elements
is possible by scrubbing with 5 M HCl and reductive stripping of the Pu. Th(IV) or
trivalent and lower speices did not extract. The tri-laurylamine (TLA)-HCl system

has been used to separate Pu(IV) before spectrographic analysis of other elements. 234

Sulfate Systems

Shevchenko and ZhdanovS 13 investigated the extraction of Pu(IV) from
HSO, solutions by TOA. They showed that the extracted complex contains 2 amine
molecules. The sulfuric acid dependence from 0.1 M TOA is shown in Table IV-18.
The decrease in the distribution coefficient at low acidity is ascribed to Pu(IV) poly-

merization. As the acid concentration is increased, the decrease in D is ascribed

Pu(IV)
to the formation of an amine bisulfate complex.

Vdovenko et a1.412 investigated the
extraction of Pu(IV) by a mixture of 7 to
9 carbon primary aliphatic amines dis-
solved in chloroform. They determined
that the extracted complex involves 4
amine molecules, i.e. (RNH,),Pu(SO,),,
by the amine concentration dependence
method, and by direct macroscopic
measurements of the stoichiometry of the
reaction. From comparisons of the ad-
sorption spectra in the aqueous and
organic phases, they conclude that the
Puw(IV) exists primarily as a neutral sulfate

- complex in the aqueous phase. Therefore,

they conclude that in this case the anion exchange process does not operate.

Extractions from mixtures of H,S0, and HNO, proceeded by the formation of the

same amine Pu sulfate complex above, but the distribution coefficient decreased with
increasing HNO4 concentration because of the formation of amine nitrate complex. This
effect ig illustrated by the data in Table IV-19.

This behavior is attributed to partial

oxidation of Pu(II) to Pu(IV), even in the presence of holding reductants.

These authors propose a process for recovery of Pu from sulfuric acid decladding

solutions based on

primary amine extraction. 13

The primary amine- H, 50, system has been used for determination of Pu in

biological material, e.g. urine or solution of bone ash.

Moore2 82 found that the hexavalent actinides U(VI) and Pu(VI) could

be quantitatively extracted from 1 M acetic acid solutions and 1 M acetic acid — 0.1

M nitric acid solutions by 5% TIOA-xylene. Of the fission products only Ru, Zr, and
Nb extracted appreciably, and these could be scrubbed with 5 M HCl. A preliminary
ferric (or uranyl) hydroxide precipitation in the presence of niobium carrier improved
the decontamination from these elements. The U and Pu were leached from the insoluble
Nb,Og with 1 M acetic acid. The uranium could be stripped with dilute HNO, or HCI,
NH OH or ammonium bicarbonate. The Pu(VI) could be stripped by these reagents

or reductively stripped, since Pu(IV) and Pu(III) do not extract under these conditions.

Alcohols, Ketones, Ethers, and Amides

 

These compounds have in common the fact that they contain a basic oxygen
atom which can solvate a proton or metal atom. This type of extractant was once very
popular, but the newer organo phosphorous compounds and amines have received more
attention in recent years. Nevertheless, they are still important in laboratory and
process separations. Indeed, one of the large-scale processes for the processing of
irradiated U, the "redox" process, uses methylisobutylketone (MIBK or "hexone'')
as the primary extractant for U and pu 2°? as do several laboratory procedures. The
extractive properties of the ethers for U, Fe, and other elements have been known for
many years.

Nitrate systems have received by far the most attention as extraction media for
Pu. Both Pw(IV) and Pu(VI) are extractable at high nitric acid concentrations, or at
moderately high nitrate concentrations provided by a salt such as aluminum
nitrate. Pu(Ill) is practically inextractable at any nitrate concentration. The extracted
species depends on the aqueous phase composition. It has been shown that, for example,
the extraction of Pu(VI) from nitric acid solutions by dibutyl carbitol (DBC, the dibutyl
ether of diethylene glycol) the extracted species is the neutral plutonyl dinitrate at low
nitric acid ( < 0.8 N) is a mixture of dinitrate and trinitrate at intermediate acidities
(0.8-3N), is predominately trinitrate at higher acidities (3-6N), and finally is more
complex than trinitrate above 6N. 171 At these higher acidities the extraction must in-
volve the solvation of a proton to form the species H(DBC), Pu(NOg),, rather than
direct solvation of the Pu in the case of the extraction of the dinitrate species.

245, 246

Similarly, Pu(IV) extracts into hexone as Pu(NO,),

at 6 M HNO, with intermediate composition of the organic phase in between.

The species extracted into triethyleneglycol dichloride at high nitrate concentration have
been found to be H,Pu(NO,), for Pu(IV) and H PuO, (NO), for Pu(vI).’8 Dibutyl ether
behaves similarly. 413 Bh
Pu extraction by hexone has received the most attention, undoubtedly because of
its use in processing. The extraction of Pu(IV) and Pu(VI) as a function of nitric acid
concentration and the concentration of various salts has been measured by several

groups.

This curve was replotted from MacKenzie's

to aqueots phase original acid concentration
wag made by using data on nitric acid ex-

traction by hexone. Both Pu(IV) and Pu(VI)

approximately 7 M acid. A salting agent,

efficient. A useful comparison of various
salting agents for Pu(IV) into hexone was
reported by Stewart>25 (Fig. 33). The salts
increase in salting effectiveness at high

ammonium, lanthanum, nitric acid, mag-

Stewart3 23 reports on the comparative extraction of Pu (unspecified

initial valence) by hexone from hydrochloric, nitric, sulfuric, and acetic acids under
various conditions (Table IV-20). Plutonium (presumably a mixture of Pu(IV) and Pu(VI))
extracts well from 8 N HCI, but not from H,50, or acetic acid, while the extraction

is very low under reducing conditions for all these acids.

Stewart> 2 compiled a table of extraction data for a large number of
ethers, alcohols, ketones, etc. for Pu in the tri-, quadri- and hexavalant oxidation
states from ammonium nitrate-nitric acid mixtures. These data are reproduced in
their entirety as Tables IV-21, and IV-22, to show the variety of compounds
tried and to indicate the types of compounds which are efficient as Pu extractants. In
general, the ability of these compounds to extract correlates with the basicity of the
oxygen, nitrogen or other functional group. Thus, electronegative substituents in-
variably decrease the extractibility of Pu (see e. g. diethyl ether vs dichlorodiethyl-
ether).

investigated a series of aliphatic ketones as extractants for Pu(IV).
His results, shown in Table IV-23, show that the distribution of Pu(IV) into hexone is
decreased by (1) increasing the length of the side chain for the methyl-n-alkyl series,
(2) increasing the branching of the side chain for the methyl- (n-, sec-, and tert-)
butyl series, and (3) increasing the symmetry for the seven carbon atom series. These
results can be qualitatively explained by the effect of the decreased basicity of the
carbonyl oxygen as the alkyl side chain is lengthened, and by steric effects in branched
alpha carbon atoms. Khalkin et a1.224 found that the distribution coefficient for the ex~
traction of Pu(IV) from 5.0 M HNO, was 11.5 by diethyl ether, and this was the highest
among a number of oxygen containing compounds. Pu(IV) was extracted as H,Pu(NO,),
at this acidity. Kooi236 found that for extraction of Pu(IV) from 8 M HNO4 the ex~-
traction decreased in the order dibutyl carbitol (DBC) > diethyl ether (DEE) > hexone,
while for Pu(VI) the order was DBC > hexone > DEE. Branica and Bona? found that

U(VI) and Th extract at a lower HNO, concentration with several cyclic ethers (e.g.

efficient at about 7 M HNO, and decreases at higher acidities. A large decrease in the
distribution coefficient of quadrivalent Pu and Th occurs as the branching of the alpha
carbon atom is increased, while that of U(VI) is only decreased moderately. N, N-
dihexyloctanamide was superior to TBP in decontamination of Pu from Zr-Nb, but
slightly inferior for Ru decontamination. The potential uses of these compounds are
(1) as selective extractants for quadrivalent actinides, or (2) as selective extractants

using CCl, and benzene as solvents primarily, al-
though other chlorinated hydrocarbons were used also. They find that, by neglecting

aqueous phase nitrate complexing of the Pu, the equilibrium can be expressed by the

They derive the f's from the TTA concentration dependence of the distribution co-
efficient, and find that C is close to 1 X 107° over the range from 1 to 10 M HNO4 for
tracer Pu. Heisig and Hicks, 173 in a very extensive study of the kinetics of the ex-
traction of Pu(IV) from nitric acid solutions by TTA, in sec-butyl benzene, determined
that the rate of transfer of Pu chelate across the organic aqueous boundary controls
the forward and reductive back extraction rates. They find that at low nitric acid

concentrations (0.5 M) the extracted species is PuT,, while at 4.9 M total nitrate con-

centration some partially nitrated complex such as PUNO, T, exists.

Heisig and Hicks' 4 found that for Pu(VI) extractions into TTA-benzene from
nitric acid solutions the dependencies are direct second-power on the TTA concentra-
tion and inverse second-power on the hydrogen ion concentration, indicating that Eq.

(1) represents the reaction. These authors measured the distribution coefficients for

the Pu(IIl) obtained by reduction with 0.005 M ferrous perchlorate—0.01 M sulfuric acid as

a function of nitric acid and TTA concentrations. Theyobtaineda direct 2.3 power dependency
on TTA concentrationand aninverse 2.6 power dependencyonhydrogenion. These solutions
were never stabilized in the presence of TTA, however. Since the distribution co-
efficient increased with time, extrapolations to time zero were made, and the extrap-
olated values were used. Plots of the distribution coefficients for Pu(IIl) and Pu(VI)
obtained by Heisig and Hicks are shown in Fig. 36.

while the Pu is reduced to Pu(Ill) with hydroxylamine, oxidize to Pu(IV) with NaNO,,
extract with 0.2 M TTA-benzene, scrub with dilute HNO, and back-extract the Pu into

cedure both extractable and non-extractable impurities can be determined.

Mixed Extractants

Synergism

The term synergism is used to denote enhanced (or depressed) ex-
traction of metals by mixed extractants, as against the extraction by each extractant
taken separately. This subject has received considerable attention in recent years.

Pu has received its share (perhaps more than its share) of the general research, and
while not many radiochemical applications have appeared for this phenomenon, it is to

be expected that more will be found. Considered in this section are all cases of changed
extraction properties due to changes in the nature of the supposedly inert diluent, as well
as mixtures of different types of extractants such as TBP-TTA, TBP-DBP, etc. The
range of phenomena described under the term synergism is thus diverse, complex, and

in general not completely understood. The review of Marcus2®” is excellent in this re-

gard, and the reader is referred to it for a more complete discussion.

Influence of Diluent

Taubes 8 397, 398

polarity and polarizability of supposedly inert diluents on the extractability of tetra-

conducted extensive studies on the effect of the

and hexavalent actinides with various extractants, including hexone, TBP, DBC, TTA,
TLA, and TBAN. Examples of diluents used are polar (P): chloroform, non-polar (L):
carbon tetrachloride, non-polar but polarizable (H): benzene. He found that the nature
of the diluent exerted a large influence on the extractability, and proposed a theory
based on (1) the interaction between the dipole of the organic molecule and the diluent
dipoles, and (2) mutual interaction between permanent dipoles in the diluent mixture
giving rise to structure in the organic phase. The effects can be large; e. g., Dpy(1v)
increases a factor of three in going from pure CHCl, to pure benzene in TBP
extractions. In general, the extraction of a non-polar complex (Pu(IV) and Pu(VI) with
hexone, TBP, TTA, etc.) is favored by a non-polar diluent. In the case of the highly
polar Pu(IV)-TBAN complex, the extraction is favored by a polar diluent; however, the
presence of a polarizable diluent increases the extraction. The extraction as a function
of the mole fraction of H-type diluent thus exhibits a maximum. This is explained by
disruption of the association of the dipoles in the P-type diluent, followed by participa-
tion of the induced dipoles in the H-type diluent in the extraction.

Shevchenko et 21.36% 371 found that the extractability of U(VI), Pu(IV), Zr (IV), and
Ce(III) decrease with increasing polarizability of the diluent by TBP solutions from 3
M HNO,.

Far greater effects are observed when two different classes of extractants are

mixed. The enhancement (or depression) of the distribution coefficients may be 10% or

71
more. Siekierski and Taube, 38? and Taube?00 have proposed a system for synergistic

mixtures based on classification of extractors as anionic (A”), neutral BY, or cationic
(ch. Anionic extractants are acidic compounds such as TTA, DBP, HDEHP, etc. that
act as organic anions in the extracted complex; similarly neutral extractants (TBP,
TOPO, etc.) are neutral compounds that form complexes through a basic oxygen atom,
and cationic extractants are strongly basic-compounds (TOA, TBAN, etc.) that act as
cations in the extracted complex. In general the synergistic effect is small in mixtures
of compounds of the same class, and may be small or large in mixtures of different
classes. These authors define a synergistic coefficient as

S = log 1,2, exp

Di, 2, aad

D,, 2, exp ig the experimental distribution coefficient of a mixture of extractants 1 and 2,
and Dy 2, add is the calculated distribution coefficient based on additivity of the individual
distribution coefficients. Additivity is based on the assumption that (1) no interaction be-
tween the extractants occurs, and (2) no mixed complex of the extracted metal ion with
the two extractants occurs. Both assumptions are commonly not true when extractants

of different types are mixed. A summary table of examples of synergistic mixtures

for U and Pu extraction is given in Table IV-26, based on this clagsification system.

Taube?00 has made an extensive survey of mixed extraction systems.

Synergism in the system M-TTA-P, where M is an actinide and P is a neutral
phosphate compound has been studied by Irving and Edgington, 196-200 in nitric acid
and Healy 5? in HCl. Healy found no evidence of participation of chloride in the ex-
traction. The extraction reaction is thus

M* + x HT) + 3 Py = M (T), (Ply, + x H. (2)

Values of y ranged from 1 to 3 for various di-, tri-, and hexavelent ions. Th(IV) had
a y value of 1 as did vo,™, except in the case of TOPO where a value of 3 was also
obtained at high P concentrations.

Irving and Edgington found that 1 or 2 nitrates could enter into the complex,
depending on the nitric acid concentration. With tributyl phosphine oxide (TBPO) the
species identified were M(IV) T4(NO4)P,, M(IV) T4(NO,), Py, and M(TII) T, (NO4)P,,
whereas with P = TBP they were M(III) T4P,, M(IV) T43(NO4)P,, and M(VI) T,P,.
where M is an actinide. Thus the complex is influenced by the basic strength of P.
These authors postulate that the reaction mechanism for hexavalent species is the re-

placement of a water molecule in the complex by P, giving a coordinately unsaturated
product, thus

MO, T,, H,0 +P = MO, TP) + H,0. (3)

In the case of tetravalent species, one or more chelates are displaced by P molecules,
with nitrates added to preserve electrical neutrality, thus

MT, + mHNO, + mP = MT, (NOg) P_ + mHT. (4)

Fused Salt Systems

Some research has been done on the solvent extraction properties of
actinide and other elements in relatively low-temperature eutectic mixtures of fused
salts because of their potential use in homogeneous power reactors. Gruen et a1}?
give a general discussion of oxidation states and spectra of actinides in LiNO4-KNOg
mixtures, and indicate that TBP extracts a number of elements efficiently from the
eutectic mixture. Isaac et a1. 20! determined the distribution coefficients between
Co(II), M(III) (where M is a trivalent actinide or lanthanide), Np(V) and Np(VI), and
U(VI) in this eutectic mixture (MP 120°C) and dilute solutions of TBP in a mixture of
polyphenyls at 150°C. In general, the distribution coefficients were a factor of 102 or
108 higher than the corresponding concentrated aqueous nitrate solutions. The dis-
tribution coefficients all showed the same TBP concentration dependency as in acqueous
solutions, indicating that the extraction mechanism is the same, the higher distribution
being due to the increased salting-in effect. The effect of added chloride was to lower
the distribution coefficients. Quadrivalent actinides would be expected to behave
similarly, although none was determined.

Borkowska et a1.%! used a KCl-CuCl eutectic mixture at 180° to study the ex-
traction of Pu, U, and Am by solutions of TBP, TOA, and HDBP in diphenyl. For TOA

they find the extractability is in the order

<< D

Dpym < Pamam < Pum U(IV)

In this system a maximum in the D vs concentration of TOA curve occurs at ~40%
TOA, where Dyav) ~3. TBP shows similar behavior. The maximum in this case is
at 67% TBP, where Dyy ry) ~50. For Uirvy HDBP is similar to TBP.

Moore measured the distribution of a number of ions between the immiscible
salt pair LiCl-AICl, K* at 650°C. It is perhaps not proper to speak of this system as
extraction; however significant distributions (Kd > 1 on a mole fraction basis) in favor
of the LiCl phase were noted for ucl, (for which SnCl, was added as a reductant),
PuCl,, and FeCl,. The ratio of the distribution coefficients for tri- and tetravalent
actinides was > 40. Since the SnCl, uged to stabilize the U(IV) also reduced Pu to
the trivalent state, an easy separation is possible in this system. Similar results were
obtained by Moore and Lyon220 for the system KCI-AICl5-AlL In this case the
separation factor for U from Pu and Th ig approximately 100, while that for Th from
Pa is up to 800.

Cafasso etal, ’d determined the partition coefficient of a number of elements,
including U and Pu, between liquid lead and zinc at 703°C. The results (Zn/ Pb) are
Pd:600, U:21.5, Pu:7.3, Ce:3.4, Sr:0.05.

D.3 Ion Exchange

The phenomenon of ion exchange is of great utility in the radiochemical separa-
tion of Pu. Cationic Pu in dilute, non-complexing, acid solution will readily adsorb
on cation resin in the hydrogen or alkali metal form. On the other hand Pu(IV) and
Pu(V]) form anionic complexes in moderately concentrated nitric or hydrochloric acids
and so will adsorb on anion exchange resins. Anion and cation exchange methods are
thus both usable to separate Pu. The anion exchange separation is especially valuable
in the laboratory because of the simple equipment required, the ease of manipulation,
and the excellent decontamination from fission products by the use of redox cycles.

Recently synthetic inorganic cation exchangers such as zirconium phosphate have
been developed.

A good introduction to the subject of ion exchange in the actinides is contained in
Chapter 7 of Seaborg and Katz.! The review of Hyde 17 is valuable for ion exchange
separations of the actinides. The general subject of ion exchange has been reviewed
many times. The books of Helfferich''? and Samuelson 48 are good references
to the theory and applications of ion exchangers. Samuelson has a good review of
recent work done on actinides. Heliferich gives a table of the names and properties
of commercially available ion-exchange materials. Kraus and Nelson 24} reviewed
the general subject of ion-exchange separations in 1957, while Hardy 162 reviewed
the ion exchange data for actinides in 1958.

Cation Exchange

The general cation exchange reaction for an exchanger in the hydrogen

form (acid solution) is

M*P + bHR = MR, + bH" . 6)
In this equation R is an exchanger site. The exchange reaction is favored by a low
acid concentration or conversely, high acid can be used to displace the metal from the
exchanger by mass action, Another way to remove metal ions from the exchanger is
to decrease the concentration of MP by complexing. In general, the absorbability of
cations on ion exchangers increases with increasing charge and decreasing hydrated
radius. Thus, the order of absorbability on cation exchangers for Pu is Pu(IV)

> Pu(Ill) > PU(VI), For example, Schubert 358
for the strong base cation resin Amberlite IR-1: Th(IV) > Pu(IV)> La(lII) Rare
Earths > Y(III) Rare Earths > Ba(Il) > Cs(I) > Sr(II) > vo, All Pu species are

absorbed well at low acid concentration, and are desorbed at high acid concentrations,

found the following adsorption affinity

However, many anions form neutral or anionic complexes with Pu in all of its oxida-
tion states, and therefore Pu may be desorbed by reaction with the anion of the acid,
ag well as the mass action displacement.

The sulfonated cross-linked polystyrene resins have been by far the most
popular materials for the separation of inorganic species, including the actinides.
Typical of these is Dowex-50, This resin is usually specified ag "X 4" or "X 12," etc.,
which means 4% or 12%, etc. divinylbenzene was added to the styrene in the

75
polymerization of the resin to provide the cross linkage. In general, the low-cross-
linked resins have the advantage of faster kinetics, but also have the disadvantage of
greater volume change with changing ionic milieu.

As mentioned above, under non-complexing conditions, i.e., dilute acidic
solution, the absorption of Pu is essentially independent of the anions present. How-
ever, many anions form Pu complexes at moderate concentrations, which makes the
elution behavior of Pu variable.

The elution behavior of Pu on cation resin is summarized in Fig. 39,
where the distribution coefficient for Pu(Il), Pu(IV), and Pu(VI) on Dowex-50 is plotted

as a function of the acid molarity.

Fig. 39. Typical distribution coefficients of Pu on Dowex 50 in common acidic solu-
tions.

These data are intended to be only illustrative of the behavior of Pu. In
some cases, the data of other actinides (e. g.-Am(II), U(VI)) were adjusted to corre-
pond to Pu in the same valance state. The data in every case were taken from litera-
ture mentioned later in this section.

In general, the slopes of the curves are steeper for HNO,, H,50,, and
HCIO, than for HCL. A strong increase in the distribution coefficient in HC10, at high
acidities is shown for Pu(Ill) and Pu(VI). This increase occurs in a great number of
elements, °° and probably also for Pu(IV).

The classic work on cation exchange of the actinide elements in HCI solu-

L 117

tion was done by Diamond et a whose principal results are shown in Fig. 40 as

a plot of relative volumes required to elute tracer amounts of the ions from a Dowex-
50 column 10 cm long by 1 or 1.5 mm in diameter. These data are proportional to the
distribution coefficients, and illustrate the separations obtainable in this system.

The points for the Pu species have been connected to make a crude elution positon vs
HCl concentration plot. The extreme decrease of the Pu(IV) elution position in going
from 3.2 to 9.3 M HCI is undoubtedly due to the formation of an anionic chloride
complex. The tetravalent actinides elute in this sequence: Pu, Np, U, Th; i.e.,, Th
has the highest distribution coefficient at any HCI concentration, This order of elution
is in accord with the decreasing hydrated radii in going from Pu to Th. Th(IV) was not

the relative elution position of Th(IV). The well-known separation of the trivalent

Nelson et al.’ summarized the cation exchange behavior of most of
the elements in HCl. The summary is in Fig. 42 as a periodic table of Dy vs HCl

Strelow investigated the cation exchange behavior of 43 elements on
Dowex-50 X 8 resin at HCl concentrations up to 4 M with results in general agreement
with those above. He arranged the elements in decreasing order of the equilibrium
distribution coefficients in 1 M HCl. The values ranged from 7250 for Zr({IV) to 0.3
for Hg. The distribution coefficient of Th(IV), the only actinide studied, was 2049,

just below Zr.

Neill and Higgins 299 getermined distribution coefficients for Pu(Ill) and
Pu(IV) for several resins in sulfuric acid solutions, Their results are shown in Table
IV-28. They used Dowex-50 resin to demonstrate a process for recovering Pu from
sulfuric acid decladding solutions which contain stainless steel, The Pu is normally
trivalent in dilute sulfuric acid solutions, and is adsorbed from 0.5 M acid, scrubbed
with 0.5 M sulfuric acid, washed with water to remove sulfate, and eluted with 6 N
HNO. The product Pu solution contained 5% of the original stainless steel materials,
primarily iron and chromium.

The most common applications of cation exchange techniques for Pu are
(1) concentration from a dilute solution, or (2) separation from nonabsorbable

impurities, such as hydrazine. 419

Several processes for final purification and
concentration of Pu from solvent extraction plants have been developed. These
processes should be easily adapted to the laboratory scale. Bruce 60 describes the
process as adsorption of Pu(lI) from 0.25 M HNO4 by Dowex-50 X 12 from a 0.15 g/1
solution of Pu(ll) which is 0.1 M in hydroxylamine sulfate, washing with 0.1 - 0,25 M
HNOq containing 0.05 M hydroxylamine sulfate, and eluting with 5.7 M HNO, containing

0.3 M sulfamic acid to prevent oxidation to Pu(IV). Bruce reports a concentration

factor of 330 for Pu in this process. Decontamination factors of approximately 20 to
30 for Zr and Nb, and 2.4 to 8 for most other ions were obtained.

During the entire process the Pu is kept trivalent for several reasons;
among these are (1) the Pu is initially trivalent as it is stripped from TBP in the
Purex process, (2) oxidation during adsorption liberates gasses which may channel the
resin and (3) Pu(llI) is more eagily desorbed, permitting a higher concentration factor,

to elute the U(VI) and some fission products before elution of the Pu. Pm and Ce were
the major contaminating fission product activities in this procedure (see procedure

Al{IlI), which are common contaminants in the laboratory purification of trivalent
actinides for spectrometer sources. His results are shown in Fig. 45 with Am(ITI)
as a typical actinide. His procedure was to adsorb the ions from a very dilute HCl
solution, wash with 1 M HCI, and elute with 6 M HCI.

Zolotov and Nishanov 436 report the separation of Np from U, Pu and

Zagrai and Sel' chenkov 435 separated Np and Pu by elution from cation

Np(IV) with SO, for 20 minutes at 90-100°C.

The preparation of cation exchange resin beads with scintillating properties
wag reported by Heimbuch and Gee. 172 Polyvinyl toluene-divinylbenzene mixtures
were polymerized with p-terphenyl and 1, 4-bis- 2-(5-phenyloxyazolyl) -benzene as
scintillators. The resin beads were then surface-sulfonated, to give capacities rang-
ing from 0.01 to 0.1 milliquivalents/ gram. sr, Pu239, and P0210 have been
adsorbed with this resin and counted with efficiencies from 30 to 50% of the adsorbed
activity. Several applications are suggested:

1. Easy sample preparation for adsorbable radionuclides.
2. A combination of concentration of ions from dilute solution and sample preparation.
3. Rapid qualitative analysis for radionuclides in dilute solutions.

Kennedy et al. 222 prepared and tested phosphorylated resins, which are

analogous to acidic phosphorous compounds in solvent extraction systems. They found

that these resins are between carboxylic and sulfonic resins in acidity. The adsorption

81
affinity of geveral ions was Th(IV), U(IV)> U(VI), Fe(dI)> La(OI) > ats Cu(11),
Co(II), Cal) > Na‘. Pu was not measured, but Pu(IV) would presumably be with Th
and U.

Inorganic Ion Exchangers

Although inorganic ion exchangers have been long known, they have been
largely superseded by the synthetic resins, principally because of the higher
capacities and more tractable physical characteristics obtainable in the synthetic
exchangers. However experimentation has continued on natural and synthetic com-
pounds. In the actinide field this work has proceeded primarily toward the finding of
better separations from fission products. The inorganic exchangers are also quite
resistant to radiation damage, which is an advantage in process applications.

A general discussion of the ion exchange properties of hydrous oxides has

been given by Kraus et al, 242

Paper Chromatography

Clanet 0 determined paper chromatographic R; values for Pu(Ill), Pu(IV)
and Pu(VI), U(IV), and U(VI), and Am(OI) in HCl-butanol mixtures (1:1) ranging from
1to 10 M HCl. The Re values reached a maximum around 6 M HCI and ranged from
0.27 for U(IV) to 0.50 for U(VI), the other ions falling in between. The ions of lower
valency tended to have lower R. values,

methods, using different combinations of solvent and acid. The use of ion-exchange

separated U and Pu by several paper chromatographic

paper to separate U and Pu was also reported by these workers. For example, with
Whatman ET-20 using 6 M HCI as a developer, the R¢ values are 0.56 and 0.98 for U
and Pu, respectively. The oxidation states of the U and Pu were not specified.

‘Fink and Fink 131 investigated many combinations of solvent and acid to
develop paper chromatograms of both Pu(IV) and Pu(VI). In most systems Pu(IV)
failed to move or streaked, but in a few cases moved quantitatively. The results
indicated Pu(VI) and U(VI) might be separated in a methyl ethyl ketone — dilute nitric

acid system.

Anion Exchange

The behavior of the actinide elements in various oxidation states on a
strong base anion exchange resin (typically Dowex 1 or 2) in HCl is shown in Table IV-
29. Strong adsorption of the actinides in the higher oxidation states (IV-VI) occurs at
HCI concentrations above 6 M while desorption occurs below 2 M HCL

A convenient way of separating Pu from other actinides and most other
elements is to adsorb Pu(IV) or Pu(VI) onto such a resin from > 6 M HCI solution,
wash with HCl, and desorb by reducing the Pu to the trivalent with a suitable reducing

84
agent. This method is so simple and effective that it has become one of the standard
laboratory methods for the separation of Pu, as well as in larger scale procegs plants.
Pu(lV) may be also adsorbed from 7 M HNO, solutions and desorbed either
by dilute acid or by reduction. The distribution coefficients and separation factors
from fission products are higher than in the HCI system, but the room temperature
reactions are slower, resulting in some loss of convenience. 325
Many of the procedures collected in this volume are based on anion ex-
change.

separate Pu from Zr and other elements by eluting the Zr with 11 N HC1 - 0.06 M HF,
and the Pu and Np together with 6.5 N HC1 - 0,000¢ N HF.

Marcus 266 measured distribution coefficients for macro amounts of U,
Np, and Pu in the tetra- and hexavalent states on Dowex-1. The oxidation states of
the ions in these experiments were measured spectrophotometrically both in the solu-
tion and in the resin phase. The results, which differ somewhat from those above are
shown in Fig. 52 as volume distribution coefficients, D, obtained by multiplying the
usual D by the resin bed density, 0.45, in this case.

Hardy 162 has summarized equilibrium data for the actinides in HNO, and
HCl solutions for various strong base quaternary anion resins. These are shown in
Fig. 53. The Pu(IV) data in HNO, show significant differences for different resins
and different workers. The species adsorbed from 7 M HNO, has been shown to be

Data for the adsorption of other elements on Dowex 1 from HCI solutions 240

and HNO, solutions 127

are shown in Figs. 54 and 55. The great specificity for
actinides in the higher valence states is shown by Fig. 55.

Many examples exist of the use of anion exchange resins for Pu separations,
both in HCl and HNO, solutions. Adsorption in 8 to 12 M HCI and elution by reduction
to Pu(Il) with NEI in 8 M HCl, 108.382, 447,185,383 430 gy 45 concentrated HC, 18% 293
or with NH, OH and NH,1 in concentrated HCL are common procedures. An
alternative procedure which has been used ’ is to adsorb Pu(IV) from 7 M
HNO, wash the column first with 7 M HNO, then with concentrated HC], and finally
strip in 10 M HC1 - 0.5 M HI or NH, I solution. This method combines the advantages
of the somewhat greater selectivity and removal of iron of the nitrate system with the
ease of reduction to Pu(Ill) of the chloride system with resulting small strip volume.

methods have been incorporated in sequential separation schemes for Pu and many

108, 432, 433, 434

other elements. Np and Pu have been separated by reduction of the

Pu with NH, I before adsorption on the resin, 204

The removal of macro amounts of Pu before analysis of other elements is
commonly done by anion exchange either from HNO, or HCI solutions 280, 405, 319, 55
for example .

The separation of Pu {rom U by adsorption of U(VI) on anion exchange resin
in 60% ethanol which is 2 M in HCI has been reported. 298 Pu is reduced to Pu(Ill)
with hydroxylamine and is not adsorbed in this form. The advantage of this system
over a pure aqueous one is low shrinkage of the resin and rapid adsorption and de-
sorption of the U(VI).

In the nitrate system Pu is usually adsorbed from 6 to 8 M HNO4 because
the distribution coefficient decreases above this concentration and because resin de-
gradation becomes a problem at high acid concentrations. The applications are either
to separate Pu, or to separate other materials from Pu.

Roberts and Brauer 333 separate Am, Pu, and Np by adsorbing the Pu
and Np from 8 M HNO, eluting the Pu with 0.02 M ferrous sulfamate, and finally
eluting Np by oxidation with Ce(IV) sulfate in 0.25 M HNO,. In another method, Th is
included in the separation scheme by adsorption of Th(IV), Pu(IV) and Np from 8 M
HNO,, elution of the Th by 12 M HCI, of Puby 12 M HCl - 0.1 M NHI, and of Np by
4 M HCl. These authors report a clean separation with greater than 95% yields by
both methods.

Buchanan et al. 66 report separations of U, Mo, Ce, and Zr from Pu by
anion exchange methods in analysis of Pu-''fissium' binary alloys for these elements.

rapid separation of Pu from other ions. The 7 M HNO, solution of the ions ig slurried
with about half of the resin to adsorb the bulk of the Pu before placing in a column
containing the other half of the resin. The solution can then be run through the column
at a more rapid rate without Pu breakthrough, because most of the Pu is already
adsorbed. These authors used a low cross-linked resin (Dowex 1 X 2) to speed the
kinetics of the adsorption reaction. They report greater than 99,9% recovery of the
Pu by this technique when mixed with substantial quantities of over 40 elements. The
Pu is desorbed with an HC1-HF mixture, again to speed the elution.

Anion exchange from HNO, solutions is used as a unit process in a number
of large scale processes of different types. Among these are: (1) the concentration

and purification of Pu following a solvent extraction separation; 338, 339, 340, 325, 255

(2) the recovery of Pu metal scrap; 336, 331

23, 57

and (3) the main separation step from

fission products.
207

The separation of Pu and Th in HCI solutions has also been
described.
Anion exchange methods have been used in several procedures for the

used a liquid scintillation technique for counting Pu [rom bio-
logical materials, The counting was done by a single-phase mixture of sample in

aqueous solutions, absolute alcohol, and liquid scintillator.

Electrolytic Separation Methods

 

Separation methods based on electrolysis have been used Tor radiochemical
applications, but are not common because of the relative complexity of the method.

In very early work, Cook 101 found that Pu could not be separated from Np and U by

electrodeposition from acetate solutions at pH 6-7. However, Samartseva 344 found
that U, Pu, and Np could be separated by electrolysis from nitric acid ‘solutions by
varying the pH. His results are shown in Fig. 56 as a plot of % yield vs pH for the
stated conditions. Optimum conditions for the separation are stated as (1) current
density 750-1000 ma/ cm?, (2) plating time 2 to 3 hours, and (3) solution volume 20 to
40 ml.

Samartseva also found that electrolytic separation of Pu was successful against
many competing ions in concentrations up to 0.5 mg/ml. Among the ions tested were
Fe, Al, La, Ba, Cr, Mn, Ca, Mg, Bk, and Na, Of these only Fe interferred with the
separation to an appreciable extent. Oxalic acid at 0.002 M concentration was added

to complex the Fe.

On the other hand, Sinitsyna et a1, 384 found that the deposition of U and Pu

was strongly dependent on pH and current density, but that quantitative separations
could not be achieved at any pll from nitric acid solutions and acetate buffers.

Rein et 21.32? separated Pu from Cr, Co, Ni, FFe, Pb, Mn, Sn, and Zn by
deposition of these elements on a Hg cathode [rom 1 N HCI. Porter>?! found that

Pu metal could be deposited on a mercury cathode from an organic solution, and

determined that dimethyl sulfoxide solution saturated with the metal chloride was the
322

best solvent among those investigated.

V. DISSOLUTION OF PLUTONIUM SAMPLES FOR ANALYSIS
A. Metallic Plutonium

Plutonium metal dissolves in IICl and other halogen acids, but not in HNO, or
concentrated H,50,. Dilute H,S0, attacks Pu slowly. ! The addition of HI to HNO,
renders Pu soluble. 428 Sulfamic acid has been used to dissolve Pu metal.210

Pu-Al alloys can be dissolved in 6 M HNO, -0.05M Hg(NOg), - 0.02 M HF,
as well as HCI and HC1O,4. An alternative method is to dissolve the Al in a solution
of NaOH - NaNO,. The Pu and other actinide elements can then be dissolved in boiling

HNO4 or HCl after filtration.o +166

317

B. Other Compounds

PuO,, if ignited, dissolves only with great difficulty in the usual acids. Boiling
with concentrated nitric acid plus 0.005 M Hi, *4%-328 with 85-100% HPO, at 200° or
with 5-6 M H1%%1 have been recommended methods. Another method is fusion with

ammonium bifluoride, followed by treatment with aqueous aluminum nitrate or

107,62

acid. Ignited Pu oxalates and fluorides have been dissolved by fusion with

potassium bisulfate, dissolving the residuein water to precipitate Pu(OH) , and finally

263 The sealed tube method of Wichers et 1493 has been

used to dissolve Pu-containing samples.

C. Biological and Environmental Samples

The Pu in these samples ranges from readily soluble in the case of metabolized
plutonium in excreted samples, to extremely refractory in the cage of fallout samples.
Nielsen and Beasley>*3 describe methods for dissolving various biological samples.
Most procedures for dissolving fallout or other environmental samples involve treat-

ment with HF or a basic fusion step which renders the Pu soluble in acids.

VI. SOURCE PREPARATION AND COUNTING METHODS
A. Source Preparation

A universal problem in Pu radiochemistry is the preparation of sources suitable
for counting. Owing to the short range of alpha particles in matter, the thickness of
foreign material on the counting sample is limited to approximately one mg/cm? for
counting without serious loss. The requirements are much more severe if the ratios
of alpha-emitting isotopes are to be determined by energy analysis. This is so because
an alpha particle will be degraded in energy by interaction with the surrounding medium,
and the resulting pulse height distribution will be smeared out.

Most of the methods used for preparing alpha counting sources in use today were
developed in the Manhattan Project. Jaffey and Hufford and Scott 18? summarize the
project experience. Source mounting techniques are, in general, a trade-off of
quantitativity on the one hand with thinness on the other. In assay work it is very

important to be quantitative but not so important to have a "thin' sample. On ihe other

96
hand, for the separation of alpha particle energies by energy analysis the thinness of
the source is paramount, while quantitativity is not required, at least in the case of
isotopic dilution analytical methods.

Table VI-30 is a surnmary of the project method for alpha source preparation. The
reviews mentioned above are the primary source of this information and should be con-
sulted for more detail and literature references. Other general reviews may be con-
sulted for a discussion of the problem of mounting thin sources. 212,386,307

Two of the most widely used methods for preparation of alpha sources on a metal
backing for counting or spectroscopyare (1) direct evaporation of an aqueous or organic
solution and (2) electrodeposition. Other methods, such as volatilization of the sample in
a vacuum, adsorption from an aqueous solution, are not so widely used. However, the
method of vacuum 'flashing' from a tungsten filament produces very satisfactory sources

and is in routine use in some laboratories. (See for example Procedure 4 in Sect. VIII.)

A.l Direct Evaporation
This method has the advantage of speed and simplicity and the disadvantage of
tending to concentrate any mass present in the solution to produce local thick areas. The

1m

classic "LaF" method for the determination of Pu utilizes direct evaporation of a slurry

446 (Procedure 1 in Sect.

of LaF 4-Pu, followed by alpha counting to determine the Pu
VII). In general, the method is satisfactory if only total alpha counting is to be done.
However, in methods which depend on alpha energy analysis, direct evaporation of even
a "carrier free" solution will not be completely satisfactory. The reason for this failure
lies in the above mentioned concentration effect to produce an effectively "thick plate.
The great advantage of other methods in this regard is that the Pu and impurities in the
solution to be plated are spread evenly over the entire area of the plate.

Tuck*98 describes a method for evaporating organic solutions of alpha-emitting ma-
terials by heating only the edge of a circular plate, thus confining the liquid to the center.

The same principle was used by Westrum 428 to evaporate sulfuric acid solutions.

A. 2 Electrodeposition

This method has the advantage of producing thin uniform plates suitable for energy
analysis of the alpha particles, and the disadvantage of requiring a relatively complex
apparatus and relatively greater effort. The time to produce one sample can be as much
as two hours.

Ko233

Cm. He chose a buffered solution of formic, perchloric or sulfuric acid and ammonium

gives specific conditions for electrodeposition of the actinides from Th to

formate and achieved high yields for up to 100 pg of Pu at current densities of 100-300
mA/cm?. The deposition of all these elements occurs as a precipitation reaction ai the
cathode. In the case of Pu, the compound precipitated is Pu(OH), (hydrated). Moore
and Smith2%8 also used an acid solution of ammonium oxalate to electrodeposit Pu.
Mitchel1#°2 gives a rapid method for electroplating trace quantities of actinides from
HCl-ammonium chloride solutions. He gets essentially quantitative deposition in 15
minutes from a 0.1-0.2 g/ml chloride solution at pH about 1 using a current density of
1 A/cm?

A. 3 Other Methods

El Guebely and Sikkelandl?2 report an interesting method for preparation of ex-
tremely thin Pu sources. The basis of the method is adsorption of Pu(IV) onto glass or
metal plates from dilute (~0.01 M) HCI solutions, presumably as the polymeric form.
The method is not quantitative. Samartsevas 2’ reports that adsorption of Pu(IV) is 97-
! to 107% M HNO, solutions.

B. Counting

The subject of the determination of the amount of alpha radioactivity has been re-

viewed by Jaffey> C0 and recently by Johnson et al, 218 169

and Hanna. These accounts
should be consulted for details of the various detection systems and literature references.
Table VI-31 lists the major types of counting systems with applications, advantages, and
disadvantages of each.

The ratios of the isotopes of Pu can be determined by making use of the difference
in the energies of the alpha particles in alpha pulse analysis.

The isotope pu238 is very useful as a tracer in this method. This isotope is pre-
pared by the reaction

activity is not very much greater than the activity of the other Pu isotopes. The reason

for this precaution is that imperfections in the sample and detecting instrument always
result in low-energy alpha particles which appear as a continuum or low energy 'tail" in
the spectrum. The subtraction of this tail becomes difficult if higher energy isotope pre-
dominates.

VI. SAFETY CONSIDERATIONS

Hazards to personnel who work with Pu in the laboratory arise primarily from two
causes. First, Pu is extremely poisonous because of its high specific alpha activity,
long biological half-life, and tendency to concentrate in the bone. Second, inadvertent
criticality may occur. A full discussion of these hazards is beyond the scope of this re-
view, but some general comments concerning precautions and techniques can be made.
The subject of personnel monitoring and radiation surveying has been treated by Morgan.2
Appleton and Dunster>2 have written a manual on the safe handling of Pu.

91

A. Radioactive Safety

The primary hazard is due to the possibility of ingestion, since the alpha particles
are easily shielded and the gamma radiation associated with the common long-lived
isotopes is slight. The hazard is better stated in terms of the activity level rather than
the mass, since the biological damage is done by the alpha radioactivity and the isotopic
composition of Pu varies widely. Table VII-32 lists body burdens and maximum per-
missable concentrations (MPC) of Pu isotopes for continuous occupational exposure.
These data are taken from the National Bureau of Standards Handbook 69, which should
be consulted for details.

The most common control practice is total containment of high activities of
alpha-emitting isotopes by means of an enclosure which is maintained at a negative
air pressure with respect to the laboratory atmosphere. Operations are done either
with remote manipulators or with arm length gloves gealed to the enclosure,

In an intermediate or high-level alpha activity laboratory, a variety of
auxiliary equipment and practices in addition fo the primary enclosure of the activity,
are necessary to insure personnel safety. Among these are:

1. Adequate monitoring of the accidental release or "spilling" of radioactivity.
This monitoring can be done by hand-held survey instruments, by continuous filtering
and monitoring of the laboratory air, and by personnel monitoring instruments placed
at exits to the working area,

2. Protective devices and clothing. In most high-level radiochemical labora-
tories, special clothing is part of the laboratory practice. The availability of
respirators to prevent inhalation of airborne radioactivity in the event of a spill is
essential,

3. Procedures for normal operation of the laboratory as well as emergency
procedures must be worked out in advance and understood by all personnel. "Good
housekeeping," or the maintainance of a clean and orderly work space, should be
especially emphasized.

The kind, amount, and distribution of protective devices, as well as laboratory
practices for normal and emergency operation, vary considerably in detail from
laboratory to laboratory, This very brief introduction to the subject of the handling
and manipulation of large amounts of alpha activity is intended to serve mainly as a
warning to the uninitiated. The subject of enclosures for radioactive materials is
treated fully in a review by Garden and Nielsen, 142

Low activity can, of course, be handled in an ordinary radiochemical laboratory.
The limit beyond which total containment becomes a necessity is not very well defined.
The concentration of the alpha-active material, as well as the nature of the operation
and the skill and care of the operator, are factors which must be considered. At
the level of one microcurie, ordinary laboratory procedures can be done if
reasonable care is taken, while at higher levels the operations become more and
more limited. At the millicurie level total containment becomes necessary for any

chemical operation. In any case, proper monitoring of the activity is essential.

B. Criticality Safety

This hazard is most generally met in the radiochemistry laboratory by only
permitting an "always safe'' amount of Pu in any room or area. This is an amount
which will not be a critical mass in any configuration or dispersed in any medium,
While the determination of the always-safe amount in a particular situation is beyond
the scope of this review, Table 32 gives basic data for Pu239, This table was ex-
tracted from the USAEC Publication "Nuclear Safety Guide" 44

sulted for further information on this subject,

VIII. COLLECTION OF PROCEDURES
A. Introduction

The literature of Pu is replate with radiochemical and analytical separation
procedures. A survey disclosed 54 papers with procedures which were written in
enough detail to do justice to the name, and many more methods which could easily be
developed into procedures by making the directions quantitative or more complete.

Of the 54, 26 survived screening and are included in this collection. The basic
criteria for screening were fourfold: (1) distinctiveness in chemistry, (2) completeness
in detailed instructions, (3) generality in application, and (4) utility. In some cases
a rather arbitrary choice had to be made between procedures which met these
criteria equally well.
The procedures are divided into (1) general radiochemical procedures, (2)
. special purpose separation procedures, and (3) urinalysis procedures.

The procedures in the first group are concerned with purifying Pu from other
alpha emitters and from fission products sufficiently for the purpose at hand, usually
for alpha counting or alpha pulse analysis. The starting materials range from reactor
target dissolver solutions of varying ages to fresh samples of nuclear explosion debris
to very dilute environmental samples. There are 13 of these procedures included.

The second group of procedures ig concerned with a specific separation involving
Pu. Two examples are the separation of Np and Pu and the removal of Pu before
analysis for impurities in Pu metal.

Urinalysis is a separate category, primarily because there are so many pro-
cedures in the literature, all purporting to do the same thing. The chemistry after
the initial separation step is, of course, similar to that in the other categories. The

urinalysis procedures included were chosen primarily for distinctiveness of chemistry.

Procedure 1. Determination of Pu in solutions containing large amounts of Fe and
Cr. G. A Welch et al. (Ref. 446).

Qutline of Method

Hydroxylamine is added to the sample to reduce plutonium and chromium
to the trivalent state. The acidity of the solution is adjusted and lanthanum nitrate
carrier added. Lanthanum fluoride is precipitated by adding a limited amount of
ammonium fluoride and carries the plutonium with it, By strictly controlling the
amount of fluoride added the precipitation of iron and chromium is prevented. The
precipitate is separated by centrifuging, washed and mounted on a {lat stainless-steel
counting tray, and the a-activity measured with a scintillation counter calibrated

against standard sources.

Reagents

All reagents are analytical reagent quality where available.

1. Ammonium hydroxide, 9M

2. Nitric acid, 2M

3. Hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 5% w/v

4, Lanthanum nitrate solution, 5 mg La/ml,
Dissolve 7-8 g of lanthanum hyxahydrate in 500 ml of distilled water.

5. Ammonium fluoride solution, 12+ 5% w/v
Store in a polythene bottle.

6. Cellulose lacquer.
Dilute "ZAPON" lacquer with amyl acetate,

7. Standard Pu solution, 0+5 ug/ml.
Dilute a solution of known Pu concentration, The exact Pu concen-
tration of the diluted solution need not be known, but the isotopic
constitution should be essentially the same as that of the samples
requiring analysis.

Equipment
1. a-scintillation equipment.
Type 1093A or B scintillation unit with associated equipment.
2. Counting trays.

Stainless steel, flat, mirror finish, 1-1/16 in, diameter.

Prepare for use by heating in a flame until the surface is straw coloured.
Allow to cool and paint a ring of cellulose lacquer round the edge. Allow the lacquer

to dry and store the prepared trays in a closed container.
Procedure

1. Transfer a suitable portion of the sample to a 3 ml glass centrifuge
tube. Wash out the pipette with 2M nitric acid and add the washings
to the tube. [Note (a)].

(c)

(a)

Add 0-15 ml (3 drops) of hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution
and stir well. {Note (b)].

Add 9M ammonia solution until a faint permanent precipitate is
formed.

Add 2M nitric acid until the precipitate just redissolves, then
add 0-1 ml (2 drops) in excess.

Add 0-1 ml (2 drops) of lanthanum nitrate solution (5 mg La/m]l),
dilute the solution to about 2 ml and stir well,

Add 0-15 (3 drops) of 12+5% ammonium fluoride solution, stir
well and centrifuge for 10 min.

Remove the supernatant liquor [ Note (¢)] with a transfer pipette
[Note (d)] and wash the precipitate twice by stirring with a
mixture of 1 ml of water, 0-1 ml of 2M nitric acid and 0+ 25 ml
of ammonium fluoride solution. After each wash, centrifuge for
5 min before removing the supernatant liquor.

Slurry the precipitate with 2 drops of water and transfer it to a
prepared counting tray with a transfer pipette. Do not allow the
slurry to enter the wider part of the tube. [Note (e)].

Wash the centrifuge tube with 5-10 drops of distilled water and
transfer the washings and the residual precipitate to the counting
tray. Spread the slurry evenly over the tray within the cellulose
lacquer ring and break up agglomerations of solid matter with
additional drops of water where necessary.

Dry the slurry beneath a radiant heater and ignite the counting
tray in a flame to a dull red heat to drive off excess ammonium
fluoride and burn off the "ZAPON'" ring. Allow to cool.

Measure the activity on the counting tray using stable a-~scintilla-
tion equipment [ Note (f)].

Using a clean counting tray, measure the background of the equip-
ment and correct the counting rate of the sample source for back-
ground, [Note (g)].

Calculate the concentration of Pu in the sample solution from the
relation Pu (dpm/ml) = 100 Ce,/EE, V [Note (h)].

Usually not more than 500 ul should be used.

After each addition of reagent the mixture should be well stirred
with a platinum wire.

About 0-1 ml of liquid should be left behind at this stage and
after each wash to ensure that the precipitate is not disturbed.

(e) The precipitate is easily washed from the narrow portion of the
tube, but it is difficult to remove it if it is allowed to dry on the
wider part of the tube.

(f) The stability of the counter may be checked statistically using a
standard plutonium source (see Appendix I).

(g) The background should not normally exceed 2 cpm.

(h) The ratio E/E may be replaced by the ratio of the counting rates
of the plutonium control source at the time of standardizing and at

the time of sample count provided that the same control source is

used.

APPENDIX I. Calibration of the e-counting equipment,

Using 500 ul of the standard Pu solution (0.5 ug Pu/ml) (see Section B,
para. 7) obtain a series of standard sources by the procedures described in Section
D, paras. 2 to 10.

Measure the counting rate of each source and correct for background.

Determine the disintegration rate of each source using an a-proportional
counter of known efficiency. (This efficiency is measured with a source calibrated in
a low geometry counter.)

Calculate in each case the ratio

Corrected counting rate as cpm

and calculate the counter efficiency E = 100 mean ratio.

APPENDIX II. Preparation of the Pu control source.

 

Prepare a standard Pu solution containing about 10 ug/ml of Pu. Transfer
approximately 20 mg of this solution from a weight pipette to a clean prepared counting
tray, ensuring that the liquid forms a small spot in the center of the tray. Evaporate
the liquid on the tray to dryness by warming gently beneath a radiant heater. Allow
the tray to cool and add just sufficient of a solution containing 10 ug/ml of collodion
in acetone to cover the spot of activity. Allow to dry at room temperature. Determine
the counting rate of the control source and determine the disintegration rate using an
a-proportional counter of known efficiency, Calculate the efficiency of the counting
equipment,

is measured with each set of sample determinations and E, , the efficiency of the
equipment at the time of sample count, is calculated using the previously obtained

disintegration rate.
Procedure 2. Separation and determination of Pu by TTA extraction, F. I.. Moore
and J. E. Hudgens, Jr. (Ref. 287).

Outline of Method

The sample is pre-treated if necessary, with either HNO, or by precipita-
ting LaF gq and dissolving in Al(NOg3)3-HNO,. The pre-treatment destroys any polymer
which may be present and assures the proper valence state (IV) for the TTA extraction.
Pu(lV) is extracted from 2 M HNOg3 and stripped into 10 M HNO, , evaporated onto a

plate, and counted. Yield is quantitative.

Reagents

Hydroxylamine hydrochloride, 1 M, is prepared by dissolving 69.5 grams

of C.P. grade and diluting it to 1 liter.

Sodium nitrite, 1 M, is prepared by dissolving 69 grams of C. P. grade and
diluting it to 1 liter.

2-Thenoyltrifluoroacetone-xylene 0.5M, is prepared by dissolving 111 grams of
the ketone and diluting it to 1 liter with C. P. xylene. (2-Thenoyltrifluoro acetone
may be obtained from Graham, Crowley, and Associates, Inc., 5465 West Division
St., Chicago 51, Il.)

Pretreatment

Nitric acid method. A suitable aliquot of the sample solution is pipetted
into a 100-ml volumetric flask containing 13 ml of concentrated nitric acid. The solu-
tion is heated carefully to a low boil on a hot plate and the temperature is held just
under boiling for 5 min, The solution is then made to a known volume with distilled

water, The nitric acid concentration of this solution should be approximately 2M.

Fluoride method. A suitable aliquot (1 ml) of the sample solution is
pipetted into a 5-ml centrifuge cone. After addition of 0.4 ml of concentrated
hydrochloric acid and 0.1 ml of lanthanum carrier (5 mg per ml) the solution is
mixed well, Then 0.3 ml of hydroxylamine hydrochloride (5M) and 0.4 ml of hydro-
fluoric acid (27 M) are added and the solution is stirred with a platinum stirrer,
After a 5-min digestion at room temperature, the solution is centrifuged for 3 min.
Next, 0.1 ml of lanthanum carrier (5 mg per ml) is added and the supernatant is
stirred, care being taken not to disturb the precipitate. After another 5-min digestion
at room temperature, the solution is centrifuged for 3 min and the supernatant is
removed with mild suction. The precipitate is washed twice with 0.5-ml portions of
1M nitric acid — 1 M hydrofluoric acid, centrifuging each time for 3 min. The
lanthanum fluoride precipitate containing the Pu is then dissolved in 0.3 ml of 2 M
aluminum nitrate and 1 ml of 2M nitric acid.

This treatment not only aids in depolymerizing Pu(IV) but offers a method of
removing the Pu from interferences, as sulfuric acid, before performing the extrac-
tion. The liquid-liquid extraction technique described in this paper has been applied

successfully for several years to the purification and isolation of Pu isotopes.

112
Procedure

The choice of the sample size is governed by the magnitude of the con-
centration of Pu activity and of the beta and gamma ray emitters in the original
solution. The presence of high levels of radioactivity must be considered because of
the health hazard involved and because a beta ray counting rate of over 10° counts
per minute will interfere with the alpha counting on the Simpson proportional alpha
counter,

One ml of the sample solution (pretreated if necessary) is pipetted into
a 10-ml beaker, Three ml of 2M nitric acid and 1 ml of 1M hydroxylamine hydro-
chloride solution are added. The solution is mixed thoroughly and heated at approxi-
mately 80°C. for 5 min. The volume of the solution is adjusted to approximately 4 ml
by the addition of several drops of 1 M nitric acid. The solution is transferred to a
30-ml separatory funnel using 2 ml of 1 M godium nitrite, mixed thoroughly and
allowed to stand until gas evolution ceases. The aqueous phase at the time of extrac-
tion should be approximately 1 M in nitric acid.

The solution is extracted for 10 min with an equal volume of 0.5 M 2-thenoyltri-
fluoroacetone-xylene. When the two phases have disengaged, the aqueous phase is
drawn off and discarded. The organic phase is washed by mixing with an equal volume
of 1 M nitric acid for 3 min. After the phases have settled, the aqueous wash solution
ig discarded, care being taken not to lose any of the organic phase. The Pu is then
stripped from the organic phase by mixing thoroughly for 2 min with an equal volume
of 10 M nitric acid. If the aqueous strip solution is too high in gamma radioactivity
for alpha measurement, the last traces of radiozirconium and protactinium may be
removed readily by a 5-min re-extraction of the 10 M nitric acid strip solution with
an equal volume of 0,5M 2-thenoyltrifluoroacetone-xylene. Pu remains quantitatively
in the aqueous phase. The small percentage of iron extracted (produces a red color)
remains in the organic phase when the Pu is stripped into 10 M nitric acid. The
aqueous strip solution is drawn off into a centrifuge tube and centrifuged for 1 min.

A suitable aliquot is pipetted onto a platinum (or stainless steel) plate and evaporated
to dryness under an infrared heat lamp. The plate containing the evaporated sample
aliquot is heated to a dull red heat over a Fisher burner to destroy organic matter
and counted in a suitable alpha counter. In this laboratory, the methane flow propor -

tional alpha counter is used almost exclusively.

Procedure 3. Separation and determination of Puin U = fission product mixtures.
W. S. Maeck, G. L. Booman, M. E. Kussy and J. E. Rein (Ref. 261),

Outline of Method

Plutonium is oxidized to Pu(VI) with permanganate and quantitatively
extracted as a tetraalkylammonium complex into methyl isobutyl ketone from an acid-
deficient aluminum nitrate salting solution. Pu is stripped from the organic phase and
reduced to Pu(IIl) with a hydroxylamine-iron(ll) mixture, oxidized to Pu(IV) with
nitrite, then quantitatively extracted into TTA.

Yield

Overall recovery of Pu is 98.8%.

Decontamination

Overall fission product decontamination is greater than 1 X 10%; u

carry-through is less than 0.05%.

Reagents
Reagent grade inorganic chemicals, Eastman Kodak Co. White Label

tetrapropylammonium hydroxide, and thenoyltrifluoroacetone obtained from Peninsular

Chemical Research, Inc., Gainesville, Fla., were used without purification.

Aluminum nitrate salting solution. Place 1050 grams of aluminum nitrate
nonahydrate in a 2-liter beaker and add water to a volume of 800 ml. Warm on a hot
plate. After dissolution, add 135 ml of concentrated (14.8 N) ammonium hydroxide
and stir for several minutes until the hydroxide precipitate dissolves. Cool below
50°C, Add 50 ml of 10% tetrapropylammonium hydroxide reagent and stir until
dissolution is complete, Transfer to a 1-liter volumetric flask and dilute to volume
with water.

The 0.2 M ferrous sulfate and 0,22 M sodium nitrite solutions should be pre-
pared fresh daily, The 1.25M hydroxylamine hydrochloride and 0.05M potassium
permanganate solutions are stable for a month or longer. The potassium perman-
ganate solution is stored in a dark bottle.

Unless otherwise stated, the Pu levels in extractions were approximately
100,000 disintegrations per min (dpm). The stock solution was prepared from high
purity Hanford metal dissolved in 6 N hydrochloric acid. The isotopic composition
of the metal was 95.40% Pu239, 4,31% Pu240, 0.28% Pu24l, and 0.01% Pu242,

Equipment
The methyl isobutyl ketone (4-methyl-2-pentanone) extractions and strips
were made in 15 X 125 mm test tubes with polyethylene stoppers. An end-for-end
extraction wheel was used. Thenoyltrifluoroacetone extractions were made in 50 ml

centrifuge cones with a motor-driven wire stirrer, The samples plates were 1-in,
stainless steel. An alpha scintillation counter was used for gross counting and a

Frisch grid chamber, 256-channel analyzer system, for pulse height analysis.

Procedure.

Add 6 ml of salting solution to a test tube containing 0.1 ml of 0.05 M
potassium permanganate, Pipette 1 ml or less of sample into the tube. Add 3 ml
of methyl isobutyl ketone, stopper the tube, and extract for 5 min on the extraction
wheel. Centrifuge to facilitate phase separation. Pipette 3 ml of 3.125M nitric acid,
2 ml of 1.25 M hydroxylamine hydrochloride, and 2 ml of the above organic phase
into another 15 X 125 mm test tube. Stopper the tube and strip for 10 min, and then
centrifuge. Carefully transfer 2 ml of the aqueous strip phase to a 50-ml centrifuge
tube containing 0.1 ml of freshly prepared 0.2 M ferrous sulfate and allow the mix-
ture to stand for 5 min. Add 3 ml of freshly prepared 0.22 M sodium nitrite and let
stand until gas evolution ceases. Add 5 ml of 0.5 M thenoyltrifluoroacetone-xylene
and stir vigorously for 20 min. Remove an aliquot of the organic phase and dry on a
planchet under a heat lamp. Ignite and count.
Procedure 4. Plutonium R. J. Morrow (Ref. 293)

Outline of Method

The Pu is co-precipitated from acid solution with La(OH)3 with NH4OH.,
The precipitate is washed with NaOH solution, dissolved and the co-precipitation
repeated using La(IOg)3 as the carrier. The hydioxide precipitation is repeated and
the Pu adsorbed on an anion resin column from 8 M HNO3. The column is washed
successively with HNOg and 2 portions of 10 M HCl. Finally, the Pu is eluted with
a mixture of HCl and HI and mounted for counting.

Purification

This procedure is designed primarily for separation of Pu samples to be
alpha-counted; it does not yield samples highly purified from beta- and gamma-
emitters. Samples containing 1013 - 1014 atoms of Pu have been isolated from four-
day old solutions of 5 X 1013 figsions. No foreign alpha activities could be detected,
and the beta content was 10° dpm or less,

Yield

60% if an electroplating technique is used for the final step, and 35% if

vacuum volatilization is used.

Procedure

One operation can do 12 samples in 6 hours, exclusive of volatilization
or electroplating.
1. To an acid solution of mixed activities in a plastic centrifuge cone
add ~1 mg La*3 carrier and an appropriate amount of standardized

Pu alpha-emitting tracer, the isotope added and its level of activity
depending upon the isotope sought and its estimated level of activity.
Add 2-3 drops sat. NaNO, solution and heat in a hot-water bath for
five minutes.

2, Add enough conc. NH4OH to make the solution basic, Stir, and digest
at 60°C in a hot-water bath for five minutes. Centrifuge and discard
supernatant solution.

3. To the precipitate add 5 ml 25% NaOH solution, Stir and digest for 5
min at 60°C in a hot-water bath. Centrifuge and discard the supernatant
solution.

4. The hydroxide precipitate is then dissolved in a minimal volume of 3M
HCI and a volume of 0.5 M HIOj3 is added of the order of 4-5 times the
volume of HCl solution.

5. The precipitate is then digested for 10 min in a hot water bath.

6. The sample is centrifuged and the supernatant solution is decanted,
after which the precipitate is washed with 0.1 M HIOg.

7. The sample is again centrifuged and the supernatant solution decanted.

116

14.

A minimal amount of concentrated HCl is used to dissolve the

precipitate with stirring.

After dissolution the sample is precipitated with sodium hydroxide

and centrifuged.

The supernatant solution is discarded and the precipitate is washed

with HoO and centrifuged after which the supernatant solution is again

discarded.

To precipitate, add enough 8 N HNO; saturated with H3BOg (usually

~ 5-10 drops) to dissolve. Heat in hot-water bath if necessary,

Pipet the solution onto a 3 mm i.d. X 6 em long Dowex A-1 (1 X 8)

anion exchange resin column (previously washed thoroughly with 8 N

HNO,) and discard effluent. Wash column twice with 2 ml 8 N HNOg

each time, and twice with one ml portions of 10 N HCl, Discard all

washes.

To column add 2 ml of a solution 10 N in HCI and 0.5 N in HI, collect-

ing eluate in a 50 ml Erlenmeyer flask or a 40 ml centrifuge tube,

Either of two alternatives may now be followed:

a. Boil the solution to a very small volume and pipet the remainder
onto the central depression of the tungsten filament of vacuum bell
jar apparatus. Carefully boil the remaining solution to dryness in
the filament in air by application of current through filament.
Evacuate system and flash the contents of the filament onto a

platinum disc located about 1/4 in. - 1/2 in. from filament.

b. Evaporate the solution to dryness and redissolve residue with

three drops of conc, HCl. Transfer to an electrolysis cell suitable
for 1-in, diameter plates, Rinse tube successively with three more
drops of conc. HCI and three drops of water adding the rinses to the
solution in the cell. Carefully adjust acidity to the methyl red end
point with cone. NH, OH, then make barely acidic with two drops of
2M HCl. With a 1-in, Pt disc as cathode, and a volume of roughly

1 to 2 ml, plate at 5-6 volts with about 2.5 amps for roughly fifteen
min. Before stopping the current, add 1 ml conc. NH4OH. Shut

off current, remove solution and wash the disc first with water, then

with acetone. Mild flaming of the plate is desirable.

117
Procedure 5. Plutonium D. C. Hoffman (Ref. 185)

Qutline of Method

The essentially specific procedure for Pu utilizes the almost quantitative
carrying of Pu(IV) on lanthanum fluoride and also the great difference in ability of
Pu(IIl) and Pu (IV) in 12 M HCl medium to be absorbed on a Dowex A-1 anion resin,
One cycle of the procedure serves to separate Pu from other o-emitters, and two
cycles usually gives complete decontamination from B-emitting fissian products.

The initial lanthanum fluoride precipitation, carried out in the presence
of hydroxylamine, is an excellent volume-reducing step and also eliminates many
elements (notably iron) which may interfere in the subsequent adsorption of Pu on
the resin column, After dissolution of the lanthanum fluoride precipitate in 12 M
HC1, adsorption on the anion resin column of Np, Pu, and any traces of Fe and U
present is effected, while the rare-earths Am and Cm pass through the column. Pu
is eluted from the column after reduction to Pu(Ill) with hydriodic acid; Np is not
reduced to the +3 state and remains quantitatively behind. (A solution containing 15
ug of U235 was run through the procedure, and no fission counts above the usual
background of 0.1 - 0.2 smidgins (1 smidgin = 10-6 mg) could be detected.)

The Pu is collected directly from the resin column on 2-in. Pt plates
which are flamed, eo-counted, and, if necessary, pulse-analyzed. The plates are
usually very clean and may be a-pulse-analyzed with a resolution of 1 - 1.5%.

Samples are usually run in quadruplicate and yields are determined in
one of two ways. Pu236 tracer to the extent of about one-fourth to one-half of the
total Pu e-activity expected may be added to one or two of the original aliquote. On
completion of the analysis, the fraction of Pu236 in the sample is determine by pulse
analysis, thus permitting the calculation of yield. Yields may also be determined by
gpiking two of the four samples with a standardized solution of Pu activity which is
at least five times as active as the aliquot to be analyzed. The average of the number
of cpm in the two unspiked samples is subtracted from the average in the two spiked
samples. The resulting value divided by the number of cpm in the spike gives the
yield. The chemical yield is usually about 97% and for a set of four aliquots analyzed
simultaneously is constant to within =1%. In analysis of solutions of very high ionic
strength the yields are somewhat lower (90-97%), probably because under these con-
ditions the lanthanum fluoride carrying step is less efficient, Quadruplicate analyses

can be performed in 3 h,

Dowex A-1 (10% cross-link, Nalcite SBR) anion resin slurry in H,yO.

Preparation

The 200-400 mesh moist solid is washed about three times with successive
portions of water and conc, HCl, After each wash the resin is allowed to settle and
the liquid decanted by siphoning or by means of a vacuum pipet. The resin is then
stirred thoroughly with several times its volume of water in a large graduated
cylinder, and the following fractions are withdrawn on the basis of sedimentation
rates: <(1 cm/min, <5 cm/min, <10 cm/min and > 10 cm/min. The < 10 ¢m/min

fraction is employed in the procedure.

HI stock solution. Distill HI (Mallinckrodt analytical reagent grade,
5.5M in HI, 1.5% H4PO, preservative) under nitrogen. The HI cannot be used with-
out distillation, since the H,PO, preservative appears to cause the eluted drops to
attack the Pt collection disks and make the samples unsuitable for pulse analysis.
Commercial preparations of HI without preservative usually contain enough free
iodine to make them unsuitable. Even after storage under nitrogen, distilled HI is
slowly oxidized. Oxidation is inhibited by the addition of sufficient hydrazine (up to
20% by volume of 64-84% NH, in H,0) to decolorize the HI solution. The final
solution is about 4.4 M in HL

HI-HCI elutriant. 1 ml of HI stock solution is added to 9 ml of conc, HCl
to give a solution about 0.44 M in HI. The precipitate which results from the hydrazine
present is removed by centrifugation and the supernate is saturated with gaseous HCI.
The solution is permitted to come to equilibrium at room temperature before use and

since the solution is readily oxidized, fresh reagent is required every few days.

Procedure

Step 1. Pipet the samples (2M in HCI or HNO,) into 40-ml long taper
conical centrifuge tubes. (1-ml aliquots are used if possible, although aliquots as
large as 25 ml can be taken if necessary). If tracer or spike is added to 1 or 2 of -
the samples, make the others up to the same volume with a solution of acid strength
identical to that of the tracer or spike. Stir,

Step 2. Add 1-2 drops of La carrier and then 2-4 drops of NH, OH - HCl
per ml of solution. Make the solution at least 2.5M in HF by addition of conc.
reagent (Note 1). Agitate the solution and permit to stand for 5 min after the addi-
tion of each of the above reagents.

Step 3. Centrifuge and discard the supernate,

Step 4. Wash the precipitate with about 0.5 ml of 2M HF-2M HNO,
solution. Stir, centrifuge and discard the supernate.

Step 5. Dissolve the LaF, precipitate by adding 1 drop of saturated
HBO, solution, stirring, and then adding conc. HCI to a volume of 1.5-2.0 ml, The
solution may be warmed if necessary.

Step 6. Transfer the solution to a 5-cm Dowex A-1 resin column (see
Note 4 of Np procedure) which has been washed with 1-2 column volumes (Note 2) of
Solution I (Note 3). Wash the centrifuge tube with two 1-ml aliquots of Solution I.
The washes may be driven through the column with air pressure if so desired. The
effluent solutions from these washes may be used for the Am and Cm determinations;
if not to be so used the washes are discarded.

Step 7. Wash the sides of the centrifuge tube with 1.5 ml of conc. HCI,
wash and remove the Pt stirring rods, centrifuge and pass the solution through the
column with the use of pressure.

Step 8. Add a few crystals of Ni, OH - HCI directly to the top of the resin
column. (This helps to prevent immediate oxidation of the HI solution by any traces
of HNO, remaining on the column.) Wash the centrifuge tube with 1.5 ml of cone.
HCl, transfer the washings to the column, and permit them to pass through. The
column should not be permitted to run dry while air pressure is being applied to it,
since air bubbles will be forced into the column and channeling and erratic elution of
activity may occur,

Step 9. 1-2 ml of the HI-HCI elutriant is put on the top of the column and
no pressure is applied during elution. The dark band of the elutriant may be seen
migrating down the column, The activity appears to be concentrated about the lower
edge of the elutriant band and most of it comes off in a 6- to 8-drop peak. However,
to obtain quantitative yields, drop collection is begun on a 2-in. Pt disk when the band
is about 0.8 cm from the end of the column, and collection is continued for 10-15
drops after the band has reached the end of the column. This allows for possible
irregularities in the band or misjudgements regarding its position. The drops taken
before the band reaches the end of the column are arranged on the periphery of the Pt
disk, and those which are expected to contain most of the activity are collected near

the center. The drops are not permitted to run together.

120
Step 10. Place the Pt disk under a heat lamp and allow the drops to
evaporate. Heat the plate to red heat in an open flame and cool; a-count if the
original aliquot was spiked, and pulse analyze and a-count if Pu236 tracer was
employed (Notes 4 and 5).

Notes

1, When an appreciable quantity of Fe is present, enough HF must be
added not only to complex this element (thus decolorizing the solution) but also to
precipitate La carrier.

2. The column volume is defined as about one-half the volume calculated
from the actual dimensions of the column, The column volume may, of course, be
measured experimentally in each case if the interfaces can be clearly seen.

3. The presence of conc. HNO, in Solution I is necessary to destroy the
reducing properties of the original resin and thus avoid premature reduction of Pu(IV)
to the tripositive state.

4, If it is desired to fission count the Pu, plates may be prepared by
taking the activity directly from the column. However, if any drops are permitted
to run together giving an extreme ''bathtub effect," the fission counting results are
invariably too low. To avoid such effects attributable to sample thickness, the
following procedure for plate preparation is employed.

The Pu activity is evaporated on a 1-mil W filament under a heat lamp,
but the filament is not flamed. It is then placed in a vacuum evaporating apparatus
constructed at this Laboratory. The chamber of the apparatus is evacudted to
5 X 10-4 mm or less of Hg pressure and the filament is heated rapidly several times
to about 1300°C to remove readily volatile material. A 1-in. diameter collector
plate is then placed in position directly above the sample (1/4 to 1/2-in. away) and
the filament is heated to 2000°C for a few seconds to violatilize Pu. The Pt disk is
then flamed and mounted for fission counting. The yields vary, depending upon the
size of the sample being evaporated and also upon the distance between the filament
and the disk, but are usually about 40%, By careful control of the W filament tempera-
tures, plates having no visible deposit and checking to within 0.1% are ordinarily
obtained.

5. The Np activity whcih quantitatively remains on the column after
elution of Pu may be removed in the following manner:

Step 1: By means of pressure, run conc. HCl containing several
drops of HNO, per ml through the column until the dark color has been removed.
Discard the effluent, (During this process the column may separate as a result of
bubbling, etc., but can be resettled by means of pressure.)

Step 2. Wash the resin with conc, HCl and pressure, permitting the
column to rebed itself,

Step 3. Elute the Np with 0.1 N HCL. If the yield is very low after
only one elution with 0,1 M HCI, about three cycles of elution alternately with 0.1 M
HCl and conc. HCI usually give yields up to 85%.

Irradiated Reactor Targets R. G. Hart, M. Lounsbury, C. B. Bigham, L. P. V, Corriveau,

Qutline of Method

The Pu is adsorbed on anion exchange resion (Dowex 1) from 7-11 M
HNO, , the U and most of the fission products passing through. The Pu is then
eluted by reduction with 1 M NH, OH HNO, and impurities are extracted into TBP
while the Pu remains as Pu(IlI). The Pu is then precipitated as the hydroxide, dis-
solved in HNO, and extracted into TBP. Finally, the Pu is back-extracted by
NH, OH - HNO, ,

This procedure describes two specific types of analyses to be done on

followed

by mass spectrograph analysis, and (2) isotopic dilution by Pu followed by a

pulse analysis. These analyses are described before the separation procedure is given.

Procedure

Total Pu, isotopic dilution with pu?40, Two aliquots, one containing

 

~80C ug of Pu and the other containing ~ 400 ug of Pu, are removed from the dissolver
solution. Only the second aliquot need be measured accurately. To the second aliquot
is added ~ 400 ug of Pu containing a high percentage of the heavier isotopes. This
aliquot must be accurately measured and the Pu concentration and isotopic composi-
tion must be accurately known. The samples are allowed to stand for 4 or 5 days to
allow the spiked sample to reach isotopic equilibrium! and are then carried through
the Separation procedure. The purified Pu is then mass analysed. From the isotopic
compositions of the standard, the unknown and the mixture, and the total Pu content

of the standard, it is possible to calculate the total Pu concentration in the unknown,

238

Total Pu, isotopic dilution with Pu Two aliquots, one containing

 

~100 pug of Pu and the other containing ~ 50 ug of Pu, are removed from the dissolver
solution, Only the second need be measured accurately. To the second aliquot is
added ~ 0.19 ug of Pu238, This aliquot must be accurately measured and the Pu?38
disintegration rate of the solution must be accurately known. Both samples are
diluted to 15 ml with 7 M nitric acid, and are allowed to stand for 4 or 5 days to
allow the spiked sample to reach isotopic equilibrium.? The two samples are now
carried through the Separation method and a@-counting discs are prepared from each
as described in the following section. From the ratios of Pu238 to Pu239 in the
spiked and unspiked samples, the total disintegration rate of the standard Pu238
solution, and the isotopic composition of unspiked sample, it is possible to make an
accurate calculation of the total Pu content of the solution,

Ino detailed study has been made to determine the length of time required to
reach isotopic equilibrium, but it is known that some considerable time is necessary.

Preparation of ¢-counting plates. An aliquot containing about 50 ug of U

 

was transferred to a stainless steel source tray in the usual manner. The micropipette
used was then washed three times with a solution of tetraethylene glycol (TEG) in dilute
nitric acid (4 drops of TEG in 10 ml of 1 M nitric acid). The solution on the source
tray was then evaporated to dryness under an infrared lamp and the disc was ignited

to redness. The evaporation must take place very slowly to avoid decomposition of

TEG by hot nitric acid. Two to three hours are necessary for the drying.

Separation procedure
(1) The aliquot, in 7-11 M nitric acid, was passed through a 1-ml column

of 250-mesh Dowex 1 in the nitrate form to absorb the anionic Pu
nitrate complex.

(2) The uranium and fission products were washed through the column
with 20 ml of 7.5 M nitric acid. The strong acid was then displaced
with 1 ml of 1 M nitric acid.

(3) An aliquot of the effluent containing ~ 40 mg of U was retained for U
isotopic analysis and the remainder was discarded.

(4) The Pu was eluted from the column with 4 ml of 1,0 M hydroxylamine
nitrate.

(5) The Pu solution was extracted five times with 2 ml portions of 30%
TBP-soltrol to remove any U left with the Pu.

(8) The Pu was precipitated from the aqueous phase with concentrated
ammonium hydroxide, dissolved in 100 A of concentrated nitric acid,
diluted to 0.5 ml and extracted with two 0.5-ml portions of 30% TBP-
saltrol.3

(7) The Pu was then backwashed from the organic phase with 3 half-volume
1 M hydroxylamine nitrate washes, precipitated with ammonium hydro-
xide, washed once with water, and dissolved in 20 A of concentrated
nitric acid. The solution was then diluted to 100 A with 1 M nitric

acid,

Plutonium Calculation

To determine the amount of Pu in the original sample, it is necessary to

measure in a Frisch chamber the a spectrum of the plate prepared in step 8. The
239 and pu240 activity to pu236 activity is calculated. If the ratio is
236 ,4ded, the original activity of Pu2>? plus

can be obtained. From the mass analysis a pu23° to pu240 atom ratio is

ratio of Pu
multiplied by the original activity of Pu
pu240

obtained. The specific activity of the mixture is calculated from that of the individual

239 240 239 240

isotopes. The Pu plus Pu activity can be converted to Pu plus Pu™"" weight

by dividing this activity by the specific activity of the mixture.
Uranium Calculation

The ratio of the various U isotopes to 233 from the mass spectrometer
data is multiplied by the amount of y233 spike originally added to the sample to obtain

the amount of each U isotope present in the original sample.

Procedure 9a. Separation of Plutonium from Irradiated Uranium R. O. Lingjaerde
(Ref. 255)

Outline of Method

The Pu, U and fission products are adsorbed on a cation exchange column
from 0.3-0.5 M HNO, and washed with 0.5 M HNO. The U and fission products are
then eluted with 2.0 M HCI], and the Pu is stripped with 8 M HCl. The Pu is then
adsorbed onto anion exchange resin, washed with 8 M HCI, and finally stripped with
2 M HCI.

Procedure

5 ml of stock solution (containing about 15 ug Pu), 5 ml of 4.0 M HNO,
and 5 ml of 1.0 M NaNO, were mixed in a flask, and made up to a volume of 50 ml
with water. NO,” reduces Pu(VI) to Pu(IV), Care has to be taken that concentration
of HNO, is not allowed to fall below 0.1 M, since Pu then will hydrolyse and conse-
quently coagulate on the column.

This solution was adsorbed on Dowex 50 (140-160 mesh) and the column
was washed with 0.5 M HNO,. Then 2.0 M HCl was applied to elute U and accompany-
ing fission products, The washing with 2.0 M HCl was continued until the S-activity
was close to background,

Pu and remaining fission products were eluted with 8 M HCI, a small
amount of concentrated HNO, + some NaNO, added (to oxidize Pu(IIl) to Pu(IV)), and
this fraction was transferred to another column containing Dowex 1 (50-100 mesh),
which beforehand had been washed with concentrated HCl containing a little concentrated
HNO,.

After the sorption step, the column was washed with 8 M HCl (containing a
little concentrated HNO,) until the effluent was practically free from B-activity.
Finally the Pu was eluted with 2.8 M HCI.

Procedure 9b. Separation of Plutonium from Uranium Metal, J. Rydberg (Ref. 341)

Qutline of Method

This procedure makes use of the co-precipitation properties of the different
oxidation states of Pu on BiPO,. The Pu is first oxidized to Pu(VI) which does not

carry on BiPO,, and then reduced to Pu(IV) which carries. An additional purification

step is provided by extraction into TTA. Yield is greater than 60%.

Procedure

1.

The U sample is dissolved in hot conc. HNO, and kept at 90°C for 30
min, giving a solution of U(VI) and Pu(IV),

The solution is diluted to 5 M in HNO, and solid NaBiO, is added to
oxidize Pu to the +6 valency state.

The solution is made 0.1 M in HNO, (if it becomes turbid, HNO, is
added until the solution is clear) and 0.1 M in phosphate. The BiPO,
precipitate is centrifuged off. This precipitate carries most of the
fission products, and especially those with a chemistry similar to
Pu(IV).

The supernatant solution containing Pu(VI) is made 1 M in HNO, s
0.05 M in NH, and 0.005 M in Fe. In this solution Pu is rapidly
reduced to Pu(IIl).

The solution is diluted to 0.1 M in HNO, and made 0.1 M in phosphate.
Bit* is then added (1 drop 0.1 M Bit" for each m1 solution) to
precipitate BiPO, , which carries all the Pu. The precipitate, which
is usually contaminated with some U is centrifuged off and washed.
The phosphates in the precipitate are converted into hydroxides by
treating with warm ~ 10M KOH. After centrifuging the solution is
drawn off, and the precipitate is washed and dissolved in hot conc.
HNO,. i

After some hours at room temperature, the solution is diluted to 1
M HNO,

acetone in benzene. This gives a pure Pu(IV) solution in the benzene

and extracted with an equal volume of 0.3 M thenoyltrifluoro-

phase, leaving the rest of the U and the fission products in the aqueous
phase,

"If desired, the Pu(IV) can be back-extracted in to the aqueous phase

with 10 M HNO, or HC10, after a two-fold dilution of the organic

phase with benzene.

Procedure 10. Purification of Plutonium from Uranium and Fission Products
J. Rydberg (Ref, 341)

Outline of Method

The method takes advantage of the fact that Zr and Nb are adsorbed very

well on silica gel from strong nitric acid solutions. Further decontamination from

fission products is achieved by precipitation of CuS from a 0.5 M HNO, solution.
Pu(IV) does not carry. Finally the Pu(IV) is extracted into TTA. Yield is greater

than 90%. Purification is approximately 106 from B—y radiation of fission products.

Procedure

1.

The U0, sample is dissolved in hot conc. HNOg and kept at 90°C for
30 min, giving a solution of U(VI) and Pu(IV),
The acidity of the cooled solution is adjusted to 6 M in HNO, , and the

. solution is run through two columns of 510, gel, This removes most

of the Zr and Nb. The columns have a dimeter of 0.8 cm and a
length of 10 cm.

cut, La" and zro™ (1 drop 0.1 M carrier for each ml of solution)
are added to the solution, and it is then diluted to 0.5 M in HNO,. On
the addition of H,S, CuS precipitates and carries most of the fission
products with sulfides insoluble in 0.5 M HNO,. The precipitate

is centrifuged off.

The solution is evaporated almost to dryness and then kept for 30

min in hot ~10 M HNO,. This removes H,S and restores the Pu(IV)
valency state.

The solution is diluted to 1 M in HNO, and extracted with an equal
volume of 0.3 M thenoyltrifluoroacetone in benzene. Under these
conditions practically only Pu(IV) and Zr(IV) are extracted, leaving
u, Th(UX,) and the rest of the fission products in the aqueous phase.
After a two-fold dilution of the organic phase with benzene, Pu(IV)
can be extracted back into an aqueous phase with 10 M HNO, or
HCl1O, . This provides an additional purification from Zr. In

practice it has not proved necessary to use this step.
Procedure 11. Uranium and Plutonium from Environmental Samples of Soil, Vegetation
and Water E, L, Geiger (Ref. 144)

Qutline of Method

. The samples are pre-treated to bring the Pu into solution as Pu(IV) in
Al(NO,) 4 - HNO,. The U and Pu is then extracted together into 50% TBP in tetradecane,
washed with 4 N HNO,, and back-extracted into water for mounting and counting as total U

and Pu, Yield is approximately 80 + 15 (S, D. of mean) %.

Procedure

Preparation of samples
Vegetation. Cut oven-dried vegetation into small pieces and weigh 10.0 g

into a 150-ml beaker. Heat the sample at 600°C, starting with a cold muffle furnace.

When only white ash remains, remove the beaker from the muffle furnace and allow to
cool. Carefully add 2 ml of water, then add 10 ml of 8 N HNO4-0.5 M AL(NO,),
tion, Cover the beaker with a watch glass and boil the solution for 5 min. Allow to
cool, add 1 mlof 2 M KNO,
tube. Use 4 N HNO, to complete the transfer. Centrifuge and decant the supernate

solu-
solution and transfer the sample to a 100-ml centrifuge

into a 125-ml cylindrical separatory funnel graduated at 30 ml, Wash the residue
with 4 N HNO, centrifuge, and decant the wash solution to the separatory funnel. The
acid normality of the combined solutions at this point is 4-6 N and the total volume

should not exceed 29 ml. Proceed to the extraction procedure.

Soil. Grind 5 g of oven-dried soil with a mortar and pestle until the
entire sample can pass through a 200-mesh sieve. Weigh 1.0 g of the 200-mesh soil
into a 50-ml Pt crucible and heat the sample at 600°C for 4 hr. Remove the sample
from the muffle furnace and allow to cool. Add 3 mil of 70% HNO, and 10 ml of 48%
HF, then stir the sample for 2-3 min with a Pt rod. Heat the sample in a 200°C sand
bath until all traces of moisture are removed. Repeat this HNO, -HF treatment, being
careful that the sample is completely dry before proceeding to the next step, Allow
the sample to cool and then add 15 ml of 6 N HNO,-0.25 M AL(NO,) 4 solution, Cover
with a watch glass and heat in the sand bath for 5 min. Allow to cool and decant the
solution through a filter, such as Whatman No, 40, into a 125-ml cylindrical separatory
funnel graduated at 30 ml. Leave as much of the residue as possible in the crucible

Procedure 13. Plutonium from Environmental Water Samples J. Kooi and U. Hollstein
(Ref. 237).

 

Qutline of Method

BiPO, is used to concentrate the Pu after reduction to Pu(IV) with SO,
gas. The solution is heated to 100°C for several minutes to expel excess 50,. The
Pu is further purified by co-extraction into ferric cupferride as Pu(III) from dilute
nitric acid. Finally, the organic matter is destroyed by wet-ashing with H,S0, and

HNO4 and the Fe' precipitated as the hydroxide, mounted and counted.

Yield. Approximately 99% from solutions containing 0.8 X 1078 uy CiPu/ml,

Procedure

1. Acidify a 500 ml sample of water with 15 ml of 2 N nitric acid and add
10.4 mg of Bi°,

2. Bubble 50, gas, technical, gently through the solution for 20 min, using a
wide capillary.

3. Heat the solution to boiling and keep it boiling at 100°C for some minutes
to expel the excess of the 50, Add slowly 60 ml of a 1 M solution of
orthophosphoric acid under continuous stirring with a glass rod and leave
the suspension at 90°C for 30 min with occasional stirring. Allow the
precipitate to settle for at least 2 hr, by preference overnight.

4. Filter through a fine-fritted funnel, the stem of which has been drawn
into a wide capillary. Use 25 ml of 8 N HCL in total to rinse the beaker
and the glass rod and to dissolve the precipitate on the funnel. Suck the
solution through the funnel directly into a 50-ml narrow-necked flask placed
in a filtering flask with cut-off bottom, resting on a ground-glass plate.

5. Transfer the Bi-Pu solution to a 250-ml beaker, rinse the flask with a
little distilled water and add 5 ml of freshly prepared 10% hydroxylamine
hydrochloride solution. After 15 min make up to about 100 ml with distilled
water. }

6. Using a pH meter, adjust the pH to 0.7-0.8 by addition of 70-90 ml of 2 N
ammonia. Add 0.1 mg of Fett

7. Transfer the solution into a 1-1 separatory funnel, lubricating the stopcock
with any kind of grease that can be completely removed by the oxidation as
described in 14-16. Add 2 ml of a freshly prepared 5% cupferron solution
in water, shake, and let stand for 45 min.

8. Add 30 ml of purified chloroform. Shake the mixture repeatedly for 1 min
and run the chloroform extract through a 4-5 cm No. 41 Whatman filter
paper into a 250-ml separatory funnel, using the same kind of grease for
the stopcock.

9. Shake the chloroform solution with 20 ml of 0.3 N hydrochloric acid con-
taining 1.5 g of cupferron per liter, and run the chloroform layer through
a No. 41 Whatman filter paper into a 250-ml roundbottom flask with ground
joint. Transfer the water layer of the lower separatory funnel into the upper

Add to the solution in the upper funnel 0.1 mg Fe'™ and 2 ml of a 5%
cupferron solution, shake, and let stand for 45 min.

Repeat the whole extraction procedure twice (8 and 9) with 25 ml of purified
chloroform. Transfer the water-layer resulting from the first repetition
from the lower to the upper funnel. Discard both water-layers in upper and
lower funnel after the second repetition.

Wash down the sides of the two filter papers into the roundbottom flask with
as little chloroform as possible to remove traces of red-brown iron-cupferrate.
Distill off the chloroform until about 20 ml is left and remove the remainder
of chloroform by gentle blowing or suction, as shown in Fig. 59.

Add 1 ml of concentrated sulfuric acid (C. P. grade) and attach to the round-
bottom flast a 15-cm condenser. Reflux for 30 min.

Add 2 ml of fuming nitric acid (C. P. grade) and heat until the solution
appears light yellow.

Remove nitrous vapors and sulfur trioxide first by heating, later by
sucking air through an attachable tube, creating slight turbulence in the
bulb and the neck of the roundbottom flask. Two burners should be used,
one to keep the bulb hot, without heating the dry residue to a red glow,
however; and the other to prevent condensation in the neck of the round-
bottom. If the dry residue does not appear snow-white after cooling,

repeat 14 and remove sulfur trioxide by heating as above.

Dissolve the white residue in 1 ml of concentrated HCL while gently
heating. Some time may be needed before the solid is completely dis-
solved.

The final sample for counting is deposited on a Pt tray of 35 mm diameter
and 1/8 cm thick. Determine the counter background with the tray in
counting position. Place the tray under a radiant heater and, using a
drawn-off pipette, transfer the green-yellow solution onto the tray,
covering about half of the area. Rinse the flask with a second ml of con-
centrated HCL and transfer the washing onto the tray. Repeat with 1 ml

of water. After evaporation to near dryness, add a few drops of water.
Enclose the tray and two 10-ml beakers filled with 10-15% ammonia in a
large beaker upside down. Let stand for at least 5 min to ensure the
formation of Fe(OH), to be completed. Evaporate to dryness.

Place the tray in a porcelain dish, cover it with a second dish, and ignite
for 10-15 min to convert the hydroxides to oxides.

Count the sample under an @-counter. A simple counting device consisting
of a photomultiplier and a ZnS screen, provided with a light trap for insert-
ing samples without switching off the high voltage, showed to be very re-
liable and satisfactory. Efficiencies up to 47-50 percent may easily be ob-
tained. Calculate the Pu concentration according to the formula

Procedure 14. Separation of Plutonium in Uranium-Plutonium Fission Element
Alloys by TBP Extraction from Chloride Solutions R. P. Larsen and C. A. Seils, Jr.
(Ref. 249)

Outline of Method
The U and Pu are reduced to U(IV) and Pu(IIl) by contact with Mg turnings
in 2 2 M HCI solution. The U is then extracted into TBP. The Pu is then oxidized to
Pu(IV) with NaNO, and extracted into TBP and back-extracted with 0.1 M HCL. The
Pu is then precipitated as the hydroxide and taken up in HNO, for spectrophotometric

determination.

Reagents
Unless otherwise stated, reagent grade materials are used.

1. Tributyl phosphate, 30-volume % in carbon tetrachloride.

2. Tributyl phosphate, 30 volume % in Amsco-140 (a kerosine distillate).

3. Dilute 300 ml of tributyl phosphate (Commercial Solvents Corp.) to 1
liter with carbon tetrachloride (or Amsco-140). Scrub once with 200 ml
of 0.5 N sodium hydroxide to remove traces of mono- and dibutyl phos-
phate. Scrub four times with distilled water and filer through a large dry

filter paper to remove cloudiness.

Procedure

Dissolve the alloy sample, using the procedure described by Larsen* for
this type of material, and dilute to volume.

Pipette an aliquot containing 10 to 20 mg of Pu into a 50-ml Erlenmeyer
flask. For 20% Pu alloys, there will be 35 to 70 mg of U, more than enough for its
determination, Convert to a chloride medium by evaporation to near dryness (3X)
with 12M hydrochloric acid. Adjust the volume to 10 ml and the hydrochloric acid
concentration to about 2M. Add approximately 0.1 g of Mg turnings over a period of
several minutes. Using a double layer of glass fiber filter paper in a filter chimney
assembly, separate the precipitated Group VIII elements by filtration, and catch the
filtrate in a 60-ml cylindrical separatory funnel. Rinse the flask and filtering assem-
bly with three 5-ml portions of 12M hydrochloric acid. Add 15 ml of 30% tributyl phos-
phate in carbon tetrachloride and shake for 1 min. Allow the phases to separate and
transfer the U-béaring organic phase to a second 60-ml separatory funnel.

Repeat the extraction with 10 ml of 30% tributyl phosphate in carbon
tetrachloride and combine the U-bearing organic phases in the second separatory
funnel. Treat the Pu-bearing aqueous phase by the procedure outlined in the next
paragraph. Add 15 ml of 0.5M hydrochloric acid to the combined organic extracts
and shake for 1 min. Allow the phases to separate and drain the stripped organic
phase into a 60-ml separatory funnel. Add 10 ml of 0.2M hydrochloric acid and repeat
the stripping operation. Discard the organic phase and combine the aqueous strip
solutions in the second separatory funnel. Add 5 ml of carbon tetrachloride and shake
30 sec to wash out dissolved tributyl phosphate from the aqueous phase. Discard the

organic layer. Rinse the U solution into

a 50-ml Erlenmeyer flask and evaporate to dryness (2X) on a sand bath after addition
of 2-ml portions of 16M nitric acid. Add 5.0 ml of 16M nitric acid to dissolve the U.
Transfer to a 50-ml volumetric flask with water and make up to volume. Determine
U x-ray spectrometrically. For samples containing less U, use proportionately
smaller volumes of nitric acid and volumetric flasks (down to 5 ml).

Add approximately 100 mg of sodium nitrite to the aqueous raffinate from
the U separation to oxidize the Pu to the quadrivalent state. Add 20 ml of tributyl
phosphate-Amsco-140 and equilibrate 1 min. (Amsco-140 is used as the inert diluent
to give a light organic phase.) Discard the lower aqueous raffinate. Add 15 ml of
0.2M hydrochloric acid and equilibrate 1 min. Allow the phases to separate and trans-
fer the aqueous phase to a 50-ml Erlenmeyer flask. Add 10 ml of 0.2M HCL to the
organic phase and repeat the stripping operation. Combine the aqueous strip solutions,
add 2 ml of 12M hydrochloric acid, and evaporate on a sand bath to reduce the volume
to approximately 2 ml. Transfer the solution to a 15-ml glass centrifuge cone with a
transfer pipette and dilute to 7ml with water. Add 0.5 ml of 20% hydroxylamine hydro-
chloride and let stand 15 min with occasional mixing. While mixing with a Pt stirring
wire, add 10M sodium hydroxide dropwise until plutonium hydroxide precipitates. Add
10 drops of sodium hydroxide solution in excess and let stand for 5 min. (Evaporation
is not a satisfactory volume-reduction step, as it does not remove chloride. With the
nitrate introduced in the next step, oxidation of the Pu to the sexivalent state would
occur.) Centrifuge for 5 min and discard the clear supernate, Wash the precipitate
with water, centrifuge for 3 min, and discard the wash solution. Add 2.0 ml of 16M
nitric acid and stir to dissolve the precipitate. Heat the nitric acid solution in a
boiling water bath for 20 min. (This treatment will destroy any polymeric Pu which
may be present and ensure complete oxidation of the Pu io the quadrivalent state. If
the precipitate were dissolved in hot 3M nitric acid, some oxidation to the sexivalent
state would occur.) Allow the solution to cool and dilute to volume in a 10-mnl volu-
metric flask with water. Read the absorbance vs a reagent blank in 1-cm cells at
475 mu and a slit width of 0.02 mm, Calculate the Pu present from a calibration
factor prepared from a series of standards carried through the hydroxide precipitation

step only.

The activity of the solution is due almost entirely to the Am content
of the Pu metal. In general this is sufficiently low to allow a number
of solution to be evaporated to dryness at one time without exceeding
the tolerance limit allowed in a fume cupboard.

Each sample and reagent blank will thus have four exposures.
Transfer the solution to the appropriate residue bottle.

The column life is limited as some TBP is washed off with each run.
The effect of this is that the adsorbed Pu layer becomes longer with
each run and the column must be replaced when the danger of Pu

break-through becomes apparent.

Wet the powder with acetone, transfer to a 1-liter beaker and add
excess of 6 M HCI (Note (f)). Allow the KelF/HCI suspension to stand
overnight. }

Pour the KelF/HCI suspension into a funnel fitted with a cotton wool
plug and allow the acid to drain away. Wash the KelF free from acid
by pouring deionized water through the funnel.

Finally, dry the washed KelF by pouring acetone through the funnel
and then spreading the powder out onto a polythene sheet and allowing

the acetone to evaporate.

Procedure 17. Separation of Np and Pu by Anion Exchange N. Jackson and J. F.
Short (Ref. 204)

 

Qutline of Method

This procedure is described for macro amounts of Pu and Np. It is based
on the fact that Pu(Ill) is not adsorbed on anion exchange resin, while Np(IV) is
strongly adsorbed at high HCl concentrations. The valence adjustment is done before
adsorption on the column by dissolving the hydroxides in a concentrated HCI solution
which has been saturated with NH, I The Np is removed from the column with 2 M
HCl. The separation is quantitative and complete.

Procedure

The purification of 2.3 g of Np237 from approximately 50mg of pu?3® was

then undertaken. The Np and Pu were precipitated as hydroxides, centrifuged, and
dissolved in 210 ml of conc. HCl sat. with NH,L The solution was allowed to stand
for 30 min and poured onto a Deacidite FF anion column 20 cm long and

2.5 cm diameter while a flow rate of 1 ml/min was maintained. The first 200 ml of
effluent were pale blue [Pw(Ill)]. The column was then washed with 100 ml conc.
HCl and the wash collected separately. No activity was found in a drop collected at
the end of the washing.

The Np was finally eluted with 2M HCl. It was possible to follow the dark green
band of the Np down the column and the first 40 ml of eluate was included with the
conc. HCl wash. The whole of the Np was collected in the next 50 ml of eluate. No
activity was found in any eluate after this stage. Some B-v activity was detected on

the glass wool at the top of the resin column and was assumed to be Pass, the

daughter of Np227.

Procedure 18. Separation of Np and Pu by Cation Exchange Chromatography V. D.
Zagrai and L. I. Sel'chenkov (Ref. 435).

 

Qutline of Method

Np(IV) and Pw(III) are adsorbed on the cation resin KUl or KU2 from 0.25
M HCL solution after reduction with 50, at boiling water temperatures. Np is eluted
with 0.02 N HF and the Pu stripped with 0.5 N HF.

Procedure

1. To 6-8 ml of 0.25 N HCI containing ug amounts of Np and Pu, add
about half of the resin in the hydrogen form required to fill the plexi-
glass column (1 mm diameter X 90 mm high) and 1-2 ml of water.

2. Pass 50, gas through the solution vigorously for 15-20 min while
heating on a boiling water bath.

3. Allow the solution to cool to room temperature and transfer the resin
to the column with a pipette. Plug the top of the column with cotton
and pass the remaining solution through the column.

Wash the resin with 10 ml of 0.25 N HCI, followed by 10 ml of H,0.

5. Elute the Np into a Pt dishor a Teflon beaker with 40-60 ml of 0.02 N
HF.

6. Elute the Pu with 4-5 ml of 0.5 N HF.

Procedure 19. Determination of Plutonium in Urine R. O. R. Brooks (Ref. 56)

 

Outline of Method

A 24-hr sample of urine is dried and ashed and the residue dissolved in
dil. HCI and adjusted to a pH of 1. The Pu is reduced to the trivalent state with
hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution and co-precipitated on iron cupferride. This is
extracted with chloroform, the chloroform is distilled off, and the cupferrides residue
is wet oxidized. The iron carrying the Pu is finally mounted with conc. HCI, dried,
precipitated with ammonium hydroxide, dried again, and flamed off to Fey0,. This

233

procedure is based on that described by Smales et al. Differences in the two

procedures are given at the end of this procedure.

Reagents
Ferric chloride solution. 145 mg of FeClg/liter (i.e. 50 mg Fe/liter).
Hydroxylamine hydrochloride solution. 50 g of NH,OH- HCl/liter .

Cupferron. 5% aqueous solution, renewed weekly.

 

Procedure

1. Evaporate a 24-hr sample of urine overnight in a 2-liter porcelain
basin under infrared lamps.

2. When dry, scrape out and quantitatively transfer the residue to a
200-ml silica dish with washings of 4 N HCI, and re-dry it under
infrared lamps.

3. Place the sample in a muffle furnace at 500°C, and hasten oxidation
by periodic additions of 3-ml lots of conc. HNOg4 to the dish when it
is cool.

4. Dissolve the white residue in ~30 ml of 4 N HCI, transfer to a 250-ml
beaker and make up with alternate 4 N HCI and water washings to
about 100 ml to a final acidity of 2 N. Stir until only an insoluble
silica residue remains. Add 5 ml of FeCl, solution and 10 ml of
NH,OH: HCI solution followed by a few drops of cresol-red indicator.

9. Adjust the pH of the solution to 1 (with a pH meter until the operator
can correctly do it visually) with 2 N NH,OH added dropwise from a
burette with constant stirring. It is essential that no phosphate
precipitate forms, as this may reduce recoveries. Allow the solution
to stand for 1 hr to ensure reduction of Pu(VI) to Pu(III).

6. Transfer the solution to a 500-ml separating funnel and add 2 ml of
5% cupferron solution. Shake the contents thoroughly and let stand
for 3/4 hr to allow complete formation of iron cupferride.

7. Add 30 ml of chloroform and shake the funnel thoroughly. Allow the
chloroform layer to settle and then run it off through a 7-cm Whatman
No. 41 filter paper into a 100-ml separating funnel. Wash the
chloroform by shaking with 20 ml of distilled water and run the

chloroform into a 250-ml round-bottomed flask through a 7 cm
No. 41 filter paper as before. Return the water to the original aqueous

solution and add a further 5 ml of FeCl, and 2 ml of 5% cupferron as

a scavenge. After shaking, leave the oolution to stand for another

3/4 hr.

Extract the cupferrides with three 15-ml lots of chloroform — or

until the chlorlform remains colorless — and filter each lot separately
into the 100-ml funnel. Wash the filter paper with chloroform from

a pipette to remove the ring of cupferrides which forms around the
top, and collect the washings in the 100-ml separating funnel.

Add 20 ml of distilled water to the chloroform extracts, and shake the
funnel. After they have settled out, filter the extracts into the 250-ml
round-bottomed flask and wash the filter paper with chloroform.
Evaporate off the excess chloroform in a fume cupboard using an
"Electro-Thermal' mantle. Remove the final drops by blowing in air.
Add 3 ml of cone. Hy80, and 1 ml of conc. HNOg4 to the residue and
heat. Evaporate the final traces of HyS0, by blowing in air. If the
residue is not white, add further aliquots of the acids and take to dry-
ness again.

Dissolve the residue in 3 ml of conc. HCI and transfer by means of a
pipette to a Pt tray previously counted for background. Use two
further 3-ml aliquots of conc. HCI to obtain a quantitative transfer.
Dry the final solution, then take up in a few drops of water and add
enough 2 N NH,OH toensure complete precipitation of ferric hydroxide.
Spread this precipitation evenly over the tray (15 cm” effective surface)
using a glass rod with a fine tip.

Dry the tray, and finally heat it over a bunsen to form the red oxide

Fe,Oq before counting.

Counting Procedure

Count the tray "background" and sample each for one period of 8 hr in an

a-scintillation counter.

Calculating Maximum Permissive Level in Urine

 

Maximum permissive level in the body is 0.04 uc for pu23° (solution).

Excretion rate assumed is 0.01% per day.

Corresponding Maximum Permissive Level in Urine is .. 4 uuc

 

With a method recovery of 90% and a counter efficiency of (say) 35%, the

maximum permissive level in urine s 2.8 cpm above "background."

Reporting Results

Results are reported in pyuc/24-hr sample in the following ranges:

< 0.1 puc
<1 >0.1puuc

> 1 puc (exact figure reported with standard deviation).

NOTE:
Deviations from this report in steps 4, 7, and 8 above were made for reasons
of economy. The use of smaller quantities of reagents were found not to

affect the overall recovery. By using the amounts of H,50 and HNO, quoted

Procedure 20. Determination of pu?

Procedure) R. W. Perkins (Ref. 316)

in Urine (Small Area Electrodeposition

Qutline of Method

This procedure describes a method for the rapid separation of pu? from
200 ml (or smaller) urine samples, and the subsequent electrodeposition of the pu?3?

1. Place the urine sample (200 ml or less) in a 1-liter Erlenmeyer flask,
add 50 ml of concentrated HNO, 40 mg of Pr carrier (Note (a)) and
evaporate to about 20 ml. Add 20 ml of H,0 and cool under running
water, then transfer the solution to a 100-ml Lusteroid test tube (using
about 20-30 ml of wash water) containing 5 ml concentrated HF and
stir.

2. Allow the sample to stand 30 min, centrifuge 2 min, discard the super-
nate and dissolve the precipitate in 50 ml of 2 N HNOg. Add 5 ml of
concentrated HF and stir. Allow the sample to stand 5 min,
centrifuge 2 min, discard the supernate and dissolve the precipitate
in 5 ml of H,0 and 20 ml of 2 M AL(NO,)4-0.5 N HNO.

3. Transfer the solution to a 120-ml separatory funnel and shake 5 min
(or until clear). Add 0.25 mlof2 M NaNO, and shake 15 min. Add
10 ml of 0.45 M TTA (100 g/liter) in benzene and shake for 20 min.
Discard the aqueous phase and wash the organic phase with two 10-ml
portions of 0.5 N HNO, 5 min each. }

4. Add 10 ml of 8 N HCI and shake 15 min. Collect the aqueous layer in

"a 50-ml beaker. Add 5 ml of 8 N HCI to the organic phase and shake
5 min. Collect the aqueous phase.

5. Combine the aqueous layers, add 5 ml of concentrated HNO, 3 ml of
concentrated HC10,, lmlof 0.1 M KNO, and evaporate to dryness.
(Use low heat for final evaporation.)

6. Dissolve the residue in 7 ml of 0.5 N HNO, (Note 2). Rub sides of
beaker with policeman to make sure all of the residue is in solution.
Wash policeman with water, adding washings to the sample, then
evaporate the solution to 3-4 ml.

7. Add 4 ml of electrolyte (0.25 M (NH,), Cy0,), transferring the solution
to an electrodeposition cell with an 8-mm? stainless steel cathode area
(Note 3).

8. [Electrodeposit overnight at 110 mA.

The electrodeposited sample may be counted directly on a low back-
ground ao counter, or exposed to a nuclear track film and the o tracks

counted under a microscope” ito provide a greater sensitivity.

Notes

The element praseodymium as purchased (from the Lindsey Chemical
Division of the American Potash and Chemical Corporation, West
Chicago, Illinois) could be used directly without causing a high back-
ground; whereas, the use of lanthanum: as a carrier resulted in a
high background.

At this point, the sample can be evaporated on a counting dish for
direct counting if small area deposition is not required.

The electrolytic cells consist of lucite cylinders which are threaded
at one end for stainless steel caps which contact the stainless steel
cathode plating surfaces. A beveled lucite disk fits between the cap

and cylinder and-defines the electrodeposition area.

Outline of Method

The Pu is co-precipitated with BiPO, from acidified urine, the BiPO,

is wet-ashed with HNOg, and the Pu is co-precipitated with LaFgq from an HCl
solution. The LaF, co-precipitation is repeated and the fluoride is metathesized with
KOH. Pu is extracted into di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid from a 2 M HNOg4 solution,
and the aqueous phase is mounted for counting.

This procedure is included to illustrate the extraction of Pu(IV) into acidic
phosphate extractants. The procedure could presumably be used for a simultaneous
determination of Pu and Am in urine, by back-extraction of the Pu either into strong

acid or a reducing solution.

Sample Pretreatment

The volume of a "24-hr equivalent’ urine sample (two morning and two
evening voidings) is measured and the sample transferred to a 2-liter beaker. The
volume and the liquid level are denoted on the beaker with a china-marking pencil
or marking pen. Several glass beads, 1 ml of octyl alcohol and 200 ml of concentrated
nitric acid are added. The beaker is covered with a Speede-Vap and placed over an
asbestos pad on a hot plate at high heat. The sample is digested by gentle boiling

until it attains a clear appearance.
BiPO, Coprecipitation

A stirring bar is added to the cooled solution and rapid stirring initiated
over a magnetic stirring motor. Approximately 130 ml of concentrated ammonium
hydroxide are added cautiously, followed by 1 ml of bromthymol blue indicator solution.
Neutralization is completed by addition of concentrated ammonium hydroxide to the
yellow-green endpoint. If necessary, the sample volume is readjusted to its original
value with distilled water. Concentrated nitric acid is added to make the solution
0.15 M in HNO4 (Table VIII-1). 500 mg of hydroxylamine hydrochloride are added to
the solution and the beaker placed in a steam bath heated to 80 £5°C. Concentrated
phosphoric acid is then added to a concentration of approximately 0.09 M (Table VIIO-1).
An amount of bismuth nitrate solution, equivalent to 60 mg bismuth per 100 ml, is
"added dropwise to the heated, stirred solution.

The precipitate is digested by an

Wet-ashing of Bismuth Phosphate

 

Several drops of octyl alcohol are added to the HCl solution in the 90-ml
tube; it is placed in an aluminum block at approximately 100°C, and the solution taken
to dryness. The dried sample is then repeatedly wet-ashed with several drops of

159
concentrated nitric acid in a block heated to 350°C. After the sample has ashed to
whiteness, itis evaporated twice with 8 N HCI.

Lanthanum Fluoride Coprecipitation

 

The bismuth chloride ash is dissolved in 8 ml of 8 N HCI and the solution
is transferred to a 25-ml conical centrifuge tube. The walls of the 90-ml tube are
rinsed with an additional 2 ml of 4 N HC! and the rinse added to the centrifuge cone.
After addition of 0.1 ml of La(NOg)q solution, the tube contents are mixed thoroughly.
Two ml of concentrated hydrofluoric acid (27 M) are then added, and the solution
stirred with a Pt stirrer. The tube is allowed to stand for 5 min and then centrifuged
at 2000 rpm for 3 min. The supernatant is carefully aspirated and the precipitate dis-
solved in 2 ml of concentrated HCI.

Following the addition of 2 ml of distilled water, LaFg

repeated. Five ml of 8 N potassium hydroxide are added to the precipitate and care-
fully heated to boiling. After cooling the mixture is centrifuged for three minutes and

the supernate carefully drawn off.

D2EHPA Extraction

Following solution of the precipitate in 6 ml of 2 N HNO,, one ml of 2 M
hydroxylamine hydrochloride is added, and the sample is heated in a water bath at
70°C for 5 min. The tube is then removed from the water bath and 2 ml of 2 M sodium
nitrite solufion are added with swirling. When bubble evolution ceases, the solution is
transferred to a 30-ml separatory funnel. The centrifuge tube is rinsed once with 3 ml
of 2N nitric acid and the rinse added to the separatory funnel. The aqueous layer is
then extracted thrice with 5-ml portions of 0.1 MD2EHPA in chloroform for 5-min
periods. The chloroform extracts are removed and the aqueous layer is shaken for 3
min with a 5-ml portion of toluene. The aqueous portion is then withdrawn through
the funnel stem into another 25-ml conical centrifuge tube. Lanthanum fluoride is pre-
cipitated by addition of 2 ml of 27 M HF. The solution is allowed to stand 5 min
centrifuged at 2000 rpm for 3 min and the supernatant drawn off and discarded. Shake
the precipitate with 10-15 ml of 1:100 hydrofluoric acid wash solution and centrifuge
at 2000 rpm for 5 min.

Sample Planchetting
Aspirate the supernatant and invert the centrifuge cone quickly over ab-
sorbent tissue. Drain 15 min. Slurry the precipitate with distilled water and transfer
to a stainless steel planchet with a disposable capillary pipette. Dry the disk under
an infrared lamp and flame the dried planchet to red heat. The @ activity ig then counted

with a low-background proportional counter for 150 min.

Procedure 23. Determination of Plutonium in Urine by Anion Exchange E. D.
Campbell and W. D. Moss (Ref. 74)

Outline of Method

Pu is concentrated from urine by co-precipitation with alkaline earth
phosphates. The precipitate is dissolved in 7.5 N nitric acid and the Pu absorbed
from that solution onto Dowex 1 X 2 anion exchange resin. Interfering anions ab-
sorbed on the column are removed with 12 N HCl. The Pu is eluted from the column
with specially prepared hydrochloric and hydriodic acids, and the a activity determined
by direct planchetting or by electrodeposition of the eluate, followed by standard a-
counting techniques.

Ion exchange column. The ion exchange column container consists of a
glass reservoir, 2-5/8 in. long by 1-3/32 in, i.d., capacity 40 ml, on a chromato-
graphic column tube 3 in. long by 5/16 in. i.d., constricted at the tip.

Solutions

Hydriodic acid stock solution. Prepared by distilling hydriodic acid
(analytical reagent grade, 5.5 M in hydriodic acid, 1.5% hypophosphorous acid pre-
servative) under nitrogen. The hypophosphorous acid preservative interferes with the

electrodeposition step and also with the preparation of satisfactory planchetted samples.

 

Oxidation of the prepared hydriodic acid solution is inhibited by adding enough hydrazine
(up to 20% by volume of 64% to 84% hydrazine in water) to decolorize the hydriodic
acid solution.

Hydrochloric acid-hydriodic acid elutriant. Prepared by mixing 1 ml of

 

hydriodic acid stock solution with 9 ml of concentrated hydrochloric acid. The pre-
cipitate formed by hydrazine is removed by centrifuging; the supernatant then is
saturated with gaseous hydrogen chloride. The reagent must be prepared every few

days because it decomposes easily.

Reagents

All other reagents used in the procedure are prepared from analytical
grade chemicals.

Preparation of Ion Exchange Column

A glass wool pledget in the tube supports the resin. The tube is filled
with from 2-1/2 to 3 in. of a distilled water slurry of Dowex AG1-X2. chloride form,
50 to 80 mesh, anion exchange resin (Bio-Rad Laboratories, 32nd and Griffin,
Richmond, Calif.). The resin in the column is converted to the nitrate form by
washing with at least two 5 ml portions of 7.5 N nitric acid before adding the sample

solution. The resulting column flow rate is 1 ml/min.

161
Preparation of Sample

The 24-hr or equivalent urine sample is transferred to a 2-liter graduated
cylinder with concentrated nitric acid (50 ml of acid per liter). The cylinder is heated
in a steam bath at 75 to 80°C, and stirred with a magnetic stirrer, for 30 min. One
ml of phosphoric acid is added to the sample, then enough concentrated ammonium
hydroxide to form a copious precipitate, and the sample is digested, with continuous
stirring, for 1 hr. After 30 min of digestion the stirrer is stopped, the precipitate is
allowed to gettle for several minutes, and the clear supernatant ig treated with several
ml of ammonium hydroxide to be sure precipitation is complete. Should more precipitate
form, an excess of ammonium hydroxide is added, and the stirring is continued for
the remaining 30 min. After the cylinder is removed from the wdter bath and the
stirring bar from the cylinder, the sample is allowed to remain undisturbed overnight
at room temperature.

The following morning the supernatant is aspirated from the precipitate and dis-
carded. The alkaline earth phosphate precipitate is transferred to a 90-ml centrifuge
tube with distilled water and centrifuged. The supernatant is discarded, the cylinder
is washed with dilute (20%) nitric acid, and the washings are combined with the pre-
cipitate in the tube. The material in the tube then is evapprated to dryness in an
aluminum heating block at 85 to 90°C, and the residue finally is ‘whitened with con-
centrated nitric acid at approximately 300°C,

 

Ion Exchange. Isolation of the Pu

The ashed residue from the alkaline earth phosphate precipitate is dis-
solved in 25 ml of 7.5 N nitric acid. The residue may be dissolved with heat if
necessary, but will dissolve easily at room temperature overnight (preferred method).
The acid solution is transferred to the reservoir of a prepared ion exchange column
and allowed to drain completely. The centrifuge tube is rinsed with three 5-ml portions
of 7.5 N nitric acid, each rinse being allowed to drain through the column before the
next is added. The column reservoir then is washed down with 5 ml of 7.5 N nitric
acid, which is allowed to drain through the column completely... Three ml of concen-
trated hydrochloric acid are added carefully to the top of the resin without disturbing
the resin, keeping dilution from the 7.5 N nitric acid to a' minimum, and allowing the
hydrochloric acid to drain completely. All effluents from the absorptlion and washing
steps are discarded.

One to two ml of 0.5 N HCI are added to the top of the column, the first several
drops discarded, and the remaining eluate retained in a 15-ml centrifuge tube. The
column then is eluted with two 5 ml portions of 0.5 N HCI and allowed to drain completely
into the centrifuge tube. Finally, several crystals of hydroxylamine hydrochloride are
added to the top of the resin and 2 ml of hydriodic-hydrochloric acid solution drained
through the column and collected.

NOTE: The hydroxylamine hydrochloride is added to the column to prevent

immediate oxidation of the hydriodic acid. An excess of hydriodic-hydrochloric acid

162
solution should not be used because of possible interference in the electrodeposition
step. The eluate in the tube then is evaporated to approximately 1 ml in an aluminum
heating block at 75°C.

Electrodeposition
The residue from the vaporation is neutralized with 8 N potassium
hydroxide using phenolphthalein as indicator. When the solution is neutral, 2 ml of
sodium hypochlorite and 5 ml of 2 N potassium hydroxide are added to the tube, and
the contents of the tube transferred to an electrodeposition cell with distilled water.
(The final concentration of the alkali is 1 N.) The Pu is electrodeposited on 1/2 in.
polished stainless steel disks at 200 mA for 5 hr. The apparatus and techniques for

Xx
the electrodeposition of Pu are described by Schwendiman et al.

Determination of Alpha Activity

The « activity on the stainless steel plates can be determined either by’
the NTA (Nuclear Track Alpha) emulsion method or by the standard electronic
counting method. The background of the NTA method is 0.007 dpm, with an accuracy
of 1.6 dpm. A method of choice for more rapid evaluation of results is the electronic
determination of the a activity by the phosphor-coated mylar method described by
Hallden and Harley. The phosphor method uses a 1-in. photomultiplier tube and an
all-transistorized amplifier and counter system designed by P-1 (the Electronics
Group of the Los Alamos Scientific Laboratory's Physics Division), similar to that
described by Graveson et a1*3 _ The background of this system is 0.015 cpm when
adjusted to an optimum efficiency of 45%. The precision of this counting is. satis-

factory for 0.1 dpm.

Procedure 24. Determination of Plutonium in Urine by Co-crystallization with
Potagsium Rhodizonate W. H. Shipman and H. V. Weiss (Ref. 374)

Qutline of Method

Pu is co-crystallized with potassium rhodizonate by adding an equal
volume of ethyl alcohol to a pH 9 solution of the reagent in urine. The Pu is further
purified by co-precipitation with LaF, and adsorption on an anion exchange resin.
The Pu is eluted with 6 N HCl - 0.2 N HF, electrodeposited and «-counted.

Reagents
Potassium rhodizonate (Paul B. Elder Co., Bryan, Ohio).
Dowex anion exchange resin AG1-X8 (Bio-Rad Laboratories, Richmond, Calif.).
Lanthanum carrier solution. Lanthanum nitrate was dissolved in water and
purified from interfering « activity be passage through the anion exchange column
after adjusting the HCI content to 10 N. Excess HCl was removed by evaporation and
the salt was dissolved in 2 N HNO, to a final concentration of 5 mg of Lat per ml.

All other chemicals were either of reagent grade or C.P. quality.

Procedure

Based upon the experimental results, the following analytical procedure
was evolved: The procedure is described for a 500-ml sample volume. For a dif-
ferent volume, reagents are used in proportionate amounts.

Add 1 g of potassium rhodizonate to the sample. (If the urine is not fresh,
solubilization of the reagent may be difficult. Under such circumstances acidification
of the sample with HC1 to pH 2 to 3 effects rapid solution.) Adjust to pH 9 with 5 N
NaOH and crystallize the rhodizonate with 500 ml of absclute ethyl alcohol. Let stand
for several minutes and isolate the crystals by centrifugation.

Dissolve the crystals in 50 ml of 2 N HNOg.

separating the precipitate from the liquid, add 0.5 ml of lanthanum carrier with
stirring to the supernatant liquid and centrifuge. Discard the supernatant liquid.

Dissolve the precipitate in 5 ml of saturated H,BO, and 5 ml of concentrated
HCl. Add about 10 ml of distilled water and make alkaline with concentrated NH, OH.
Centrifuge. Without separating the precipitate from the liquid, add 0.5 ml of lanthanum
carrier with stirring to the supernatant liquid. Centrifuge. Discard the supernatant
liquid.

Dissolve the precipitate in a small volume of concentrated HNO, add about 15
ml of water, and reprecipitate with concentrated NH, OH. Centrifuge. Without
separating the precipitate from the liquid, add 0.5 ml of lanthanum carrier with
stirring to the supernatant liquid. Centrifuge. Discard the supernatant liquid.

Dissolve the precipitate in concentrated HNOg. Add about 3 ml of concentrated
HySO, and heat to dryness.

Dissolve the salts in 10 to 15 ml of 6 N HCl. Add 0.5 ml of 0.4 N NaNO,, and
make 9 N with concentrated HCl. Let stand 5 min.

164
Pour the solution through a Teflon column, 4 X 0.62 cm anion exchange resin
AG 1-X8 (C17: 0.297 to 0.144 mm) previously washed with 10 ml of 9 N HCL. Adjust
the flow rate to 2 ml/min.

Wash the column with 15 ml of 9 N HCl. Elute with 30 ml of 6 N HC1-0.2 N HF.
Collect the eluate in a Teflon beaker which contains 15 mg of NaCl. Evaporate to
dryness, Dissolve the salt in concentrated HNO, and transfer to glass. Add 3 ml of
HCIO, 2 ml of H,80,, and heat to dryness.

Dissolve the salt in 1 ml of water and transfer to the electrodeposition cell
fitted with a tantalum disk. Add 4 ml of 6 N NH,C1 solution and 2 drops of concentrated
HCl. .

Procedure 25. Determination of Plutonium in Urine and Bone Ash by Extraction with

Primary Amines F. W. Bruenger, B. J. Stover, and D. R. Atherton (Ref. 61)

Outline of Method

Concentrated urine, or a solution of bone ash is made 1 M in H,S0, and
Pu is extracted by a mixture of highly branched primary alkyl amines. The Pu is then
back-extracted with 8 M HCI and counted.

Reagents and Equipment
The o-detection instrument is a 27 proportional counter of conventional
design capable of accepting 2-in. stainless steel planchettes; counter performance is
checked with a U,0q standard supplied by the National Bureau of Standards.
Primene JM-T, a mixture of tert-alkyl primary amines, 5% by volume in xylene,
was purchased from Rohm and Haas, Philadelphia, Pa. The Primene solution is

washed with half its volume of 1 M H,S0, before use.

Procedure

Urine analysis. Urine is collected in polyethylene bottles over 10 ml of
concentrated formic acid to avoid excessive hydrolysis of urea, which would render
the specimen basic and could result in loss of Pu by adsorption on the wall of the con-
tainer. An aliquot of urine is transferred to a Kjeldahl flask containing enough 5 M
H,S0, to attain an acid concentration of 2 M in the final sample. The solution is
boiled without charring for about 1 hr. Thus far, volumes up to 500 ml have been
extracted. For larger volumes, amounts of reagents are increased proportionally.
The following amounts of reagents are used for 100-ml aliquots. The sample is
filtered through borosilicate glass wool into a separatory funnel and is allowed to
cool to room temperature. Twenty ml of a 5% solution of Primene JM-T in xylene is
added to the sample and the mixture is shaken for 15 min. After separation of the two
phases, the aqueous phase is put aside for a second extraction. The organic phase is
waghed twice with 25 ml of 1 M H,80,. Pu is removed from the organic phase with
two 20-ml portions of 8 M HCl. The aqueous phase is again extracted with 20 ml of
5% Primene, and Pu is back-extracted from the Primene with 20 ml of 8 M HCl. The
combined HCI fractions are dried under a heat lamp and then the organic contaminants
are destroyed by heating over an open flame or in a furnace at 500°C. The Pu residue
is dissolved in concentrated HNO4 and trangferred to a 2-in. -diameter stainless steel

planchette for ao counting.

Bone analysis. Bone is ashed for 4 hr at 600°C and, after cooling, is
dissolved in as little HNOg4 as possible and diluted with H,0 to a known volume, and a
suitable aliquot of this solution is taken for analysis. The amount of bone ash should
not exceed 250 mg for every 75-ml volume of the aqueous phase. The aliquots are
evaporated to dryness under a heat lamp to minimize the amount of HNO, and then put
in solution with 4 ml of concentrated HCOOH, and a 60-ml portion of 2.5 M Hy80, is
added. This solution igs heated in a water bath until it is clear, and then transferred
to a separatory funnel. Transfer is completed with a 10-ml rinse of distilled water.
Any CasO, that forms does not interfere. Pu is extracted as described above.
