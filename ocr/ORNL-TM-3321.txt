THERMAL STABILITY OF TITANIUM-MODIFIED
HASTELLOY N AT 650 AND 760°C

C. E. Sessions and E. E. Stansbury?

ABSTRACT

We have investigated the influence of small titanium

additions on the thermal stability of Ni—12% Mo-7% Cr—0.07% C.
"The mechanical properties at 650°C (tensile tests at 0.002/min

strain rate and creep tests at 40,000 psi stress) were mea-

sured for four heats of this alloy with titanium contents

from 0.15 to 1.2%. Solution annealing temperatures were 1177

or 1260°C, and subsequent precipitation heat treatments were

conducted at 650 and 760°C. Titanium increases the stability

of a complex MC-type carbide. At low titanium levels the

MC carbide is stable at 650°C but is unstable at 760°C, where

an MpC-type carbide is precipitated, resulting in inferior

properties. For the higher titanium concentrations the

MC carbide is stable on aging at 760°C and results in excel-

lent properties after a solution anneal at 1177°C. However,

high-titanium alloys are significantly less ductile if they

are solution annealed at 1260°C and aged at either 650 or

760°C. The heat with the lowest carbon content (0.04% C)

was most resistant to property changes on aging up to

10,000 hr at both 650 and 760°C.

 

INTRODUCTION

We are concerned with modifying the composition of Hastelloy N for
better performance as a material for a molten-salt thermal breeder reac-
tor with an expected lifetime of 30 years or more. The existing
Hastelloy N developed primarily at Oak Ridge over the past 10 to
12 years functioned well in an 8-MW(t) reactor built five years ago and
operated over the past three years.?2 ‘However, this reactor operated at

lconsultant from the University of Tennessee, Knoxville, Tennessee.

ment Hastelloy N Surveillance Specimens — Fourth Group, ORNL-TM-3063

650°C, and when it was constructed very little was known about the
problem of high-temperature irradiation demage to this alloy. Since
that time we have observed? damage by thermal neutrons on many mate-
rials, including nickel-base alloys such as Hastelloy N, in which a
larger deterioration in properties is observed than in most iron-base
alloys. Thus, an alloy with greater resistance to radiation damage 1s
needed. .

We found that small additions of reactive elements , notably tita-
nium, cen significantly enhance the postirradiation creep~-rupture life
and ductility.® Thus » we have proceeded with the development of a
modified Hastelloy N containing titanium. This report represents the
phase of the program concerned with the effect of thermal and mechani-
cal treatment on the creep and tensile behavior of these experimental
alloys.

EXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

The material investigated. in this program was produced by a com-
mercial vendor. These four 100-1b heats were vacuum induction melted
with initial ingot breakdown at 1177°C and final fabrication to 0.5-in.
‘plate at 870°C. The titanium content was the primary variable, being
0.15, 0.27, 0.45, ‘and 1.20% as shown in Table 1. Although & nominal
carbon level of 0.07% was specified, the carbon content of Heat 466-548
was lower than the others. The various thermal and mechanical treat-
ments applied are given in Table 2. The variables include solution
annealing conditions, cold work, aging time, and aging temperature.

The dimensions of the mechanical property test specimen are shown
in Fig. 1. This specimen was used so that the results could be compared
directly to postirradiation mechanical property tests for which this

specimen was designed. Specimens were solution annealed in argon and
aged in stainless steel capsules that had been evacuated and backfilled
with argon. Conventional tensile measurements were carried out using
an Instron tensile machined equipped with a specimen furnace. Two
Chromel-P vs Alumel thermocouples were used with a proportioning con-
troller to keep the test specimen at 650 + 3°C.

The mivrostructures developed during aging were studied by optical
and electron transmission microscopy, extraction replication, and
scanning microscopy. In addition, precipitated phases present in cer-
tain alloys were identified by x-ray diffraction using the Debye-
Scherrer technique on precipitates extracted electrolytically with a
methanol-10% HCl solution. Details of the microstructure examination
have been reported, > and the ‘alloying effects of titanium have been
summarized.® We shall concern ourselves here with the detailed mechani-
cal property response to heat treatment and a limited discussion of
microstructures revealed in optical metallography.

C

Because of the large number of variables included in this study
and the attempt to measure the complicated and very subtle differences
introduced by titanium additions, these experiments were statistically
designed as a full factorial replication’ including the variables in
Table 2. The purpose of this experimental design was to provide better
evaluation and separation of the influence of the specific variables on
the tensile property response. Results of these statistical analyses

"have been discussed previously.8

RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Typical results of the influence of preage thermal-mechanical
treatment, aging time, and temperature on the tensile and creep proper-
ties at 650°C will be presented first. The phase identification will
then be presented and discussed in light of the mechanical property
changes. Strength and ductility values for all specimens tested are

given in the Appendix.

Effect of Preaging on the Mechanical Properties

Figure 2 shows the yield strength (0.2% offset) and total elonga-
tion values for the three preage treatments investigated. Solution -
annealing 1 hr at 1260°C lowered the strength and increased the ductil-
ity at each titanium level as compared to a l-hr solution anneal at
1177°C. Prestraining 10% at room temperature after & l-hr 1177°C solu-
tion anneal doubled the high-temperature yield strength and reduced the
ductility by one-third. The yield strength increased with titanium
content for these unaged specimens, but the tensile ductility was not
appreciably affected by the titanium content for these pretest

treatments.

Strength and Ductility of Modified Hastelloy N at 650°C.

Effect of Aging on Ductility

Changes in tensile elongation with aging time are shown in Figs. 3
through 5 for both aging temperatures. Aging at either 650 or 760°C
after a solution anneal at 1177°C enhanced the ductility at 650°C for
the 1.2% Ti heat and decreased it for the 0.15% Ti heat. After & l-hr
solution anneal at 1260°C, the 1.2% Ti heat lost ductility on aging at
either aging temperature to the same extent as did the lowest titanium
level, 0.15%. Thus, the larger grain size or greater amount of solute
in solid solution after the 1260°C treatment made the high-titenium
heat susceptible to a detrimental aging reaction to which it was immune
after the 1177°C anneal. |

The effect of prestraining on the aging behavior is shown in
Fig. 5. Samples were solution annealed 1 hr at 1177°C, prestrained 10%
at room tempersture, aged at either 650 or 760°C, and then tested at
650°C. The variation in tensile ductility with aging time and titanium
was similar to that shown in Fig. 3 for samples not prestrained; how-

ever, the overall ductility was lower for the prestrained material.

For aging at 650°C the intermediate (0.45%) and high (1.2%) titanium
heats showed an increase in ductility with aging time. The low (0.15%)
titanium heat exhibited a rapid loss in hot ductility with aging time at
650°C. Aging at 760°C affected the ductility of the low- and high-
titanium heats the same as aging at 650°C, whereas the intermediate

760°C in contrast to the ductility enhancement found after aging at
650°C.

AGING TIME (hr)

Fig. 6. Yield Strength Changes as a Function of Aging Time and
Titanium Content for a 1l-hr Solution Anneal at 1260°C..

760°C the largest strength increase occurred for the 1.2% Ti heat.
The intermediate (0.45%) titanium heat exhibited the smallest change in
yield strength for aging at either temperature. The lower yield
strength values in this 0.45% Ti heat were most likely due to the lower
carbon concentration for this heat (0.04% as compared to 0.07%).

The changes in yield strength for samples solution annealed at

‘77°c before aging (not plotted) were comparable in most cases to

those shown in Fig. 6. For the 1.2% Ti heat solution annealed at 1177°C
and aged at 650°C, the yield strength at 650°C peaked at 46,000 psi
after 1500 hr aging and exhibited classical overaging by decreasing to
37,500 psi after 10,000 hr. The increase in strength on aging the

1.2% Ti heat at 760°C after the 1177°C solution anneal was appreciably

lower than for the 1260°C anneal. The yield strength peaked at
41,000 psi after 1500 hr and decreased to 37,000 psi after 10,000 hr.

 
 

10

The strength of the prestrained alloys did not increase on aging.
The 1.2% Ti heat actually showed a yield strength decrease with aging
time at both 650 and 760°C, and the intermediate- and low-titanium

heats did not show any large

change in yield strength after aging.

Stress-Strain Curves

The stress-strain curves for the two heats that showed the lowest
~ and highest strengths are shown in Figs. 7 and 8. The engineering
. stress and strain are plotted up to the ultimate stress for the 0.45

and 1.2% Ti heats in Figs. 7

ultimate tensile stresses from 50,000 to 90,000 psi and uniform elonga-
tions from approximately 15 to 40% were achieved by the thermal-
mechanical treatments investigated. The 1.2% Ti heat (Fig. 8) exhibited
a range of ultimate tensile strengths from 75,000 to 105,000 psi and

uniform elongations from 8 to 40%.

- Comparison of Measures of Ductility

Depending on the application, our criteria of usable ductility
often vary. Thus, Fig. 9 CONpATes three measures of the tensile ductil-
ity at 650°C for a l-hr anneal at 1177°C and aging at 650°C. This
particular treatment produced a high total elongation for the 0.45 and

1.2% Ti levels, as previously discussed, but the 1.2% Ti heat actually
deteriorated in uniform elongation from 35 to approximately 26% with
aging time. Therefore, to account for the high total elongation
observed, the nonuniform elongation must have increased to. compensate
for the observed decrease in uniform strain. That is to say, for this
heat, which exhibited the maximum ductility after this particular treat-
ment, we found & change in the stress-strain relationship induced by
precipitation. The change corresponded to an increase in yield strength,
an increase in reduction in area, and an increase in total elongation;
however, it corresponded to a decrease in ultimate tensile strength and

uniform elongation.

are similar for the various heats as solution annealed at 1177°C.

Aging 1500 hr at 650°C increases yield strength more than at 760°C.
However, the ductility decrease on aging was approximately the same for
the two aging temperatures. These trends in strength and ductility
were found for heats 466-535, 466-541, and 466-548. For heat 467-548
(1.2% Ti) we measured the effect of using a higher solution anneal tem-
perature (1260°C) on the aging response. Aging 1500 hr at 760°C
increased the room-temperature yield strength from 36,000 to 60,000 psi
and decreased the creep elongation from 68 to 42% strain. This change
in the room-temperature tensile behavior for the 1260°C solution anneal
was larger then that found after annealing at 1177°C. However, the
microstructural differences found for this high-titanium (1.2% Ti,
467-548) heat are significant and have been discussed previously.’ The
point is that, regardless of the differences in microstructure, the
room-temperature properties are similar.

Creep Properties After 3000 hr of Aging

The effect of titanium content on the creep properties of solution-
annealed and aged alloys was measured for 36 specimens. Each test was
conducted at 650°C and under 40,000 psi stress so that the rupture lives
and creep rates indicate the effects of aging. Creep ductility in these
tests reflected the influence of strain rate, which varied with the
strength of the alloy under this constant-load creep test. The ductili-
ties, rupture lives, and creep rates are given in Figs. 10 and 11 for

some of the treatments used.

Effect of Preage Treatments

For each alloy, except the 1.2% Ti heat, the lowest rupture life
and highest elongation corresponded to samples solution annealed at the
higher temperature (i.e., 1 hr at 1260°C). In most instances the lowest
secondary creep rate, maximum rupture life, and minimum duetility corre-
sponded to the samples prestrained 10% at room temperature.

Effect of Aging Temperature

In most cases (10 of 12 tests) the rupture life after aging 3000 hr
at 760°C was reduced by from 20 to 90% as compared with the unaged sam-~
ples. Correspondingly, the creep rates were significantly increased by a
factor of 3 to 10, depending on the alloy and heat treatment. The creep
ductility of the samples aged 3000 hr at 760°C ranged from 6 to 37%,
with the higher values corresponding to the higher titanium level (1.2%).

Less property deterioration was observed for aging 3000 hr at 650°C.
In fact, several heats, notably the 0.45% Ti heat, exhibited significantly

‘enhanced rupture lives and fracture strains even though the creep rate

was increased appreciably by the aging treatment. In general, the pre-

strained samples and those with the larger grain size (i.e. , solution
annealed at 1260°C) showed the largest reduction in rupture life after
aging at 760°C.

~ . Effect of Titanium

Generally, the creep-rupture lives and ductilities increased with
increasing titanium content for both the solution-annealed and the aged

samples. The creep rates decreased with increasing titanium content.

Fig. 11. Effect of Titanium Content and Heat Treatment on the
40,000-psi Creep Elongation at 650°C.

The titanium content influenced the magnitude of the aging effect.
For most treatments, the alloy with the highest titanium content
exhibited the smallest property deterioration after aging. However,
solution annealing for 1 hr at 1260°C led to creep property changes on
aging that were quite significant for all levels of titanium.

Comparison of Tensile and Creep Results

Table 4 lists the heat treatments for each heat of material that
corresponded to the maximum and minimum property value found in creep
and tensile testing of the samples aged 3000 hr. Since three treatments
were included in this study [i.e., solution anneals of (1) 1 hr at 1177°C
(2) 1260°C, and (3) 1 hr at 1177°C plus 10% prestrain at room temperature]
the treatment that is not listed under either minimum or maximum in
Table 4 would result in properties intermediate between the minimum and

maximum values.

Results of Unaged Samples -

In each case the maximum yield strength and maximum ultimate ten-
sile strength at 650°C were found for the 10% prestrained samples. The
minimum yield and ultimate strengths were found for the 1260°C treatment.
The minimum and maximum tensile ductilities corresponded to the strongest
and weakest alloys in tensile tests, with one exception, the 0.45% Ti
heat.

In creep the maximum resistance to rupture (maximum rupture life)
corresponded to the prestrained sample in only two of the four heats,
but prestrained samples crept at a lower rate in three of the four cases.
Notably, the 1.2% Ti heat exhibited the minimum and maximum creep resis-
tance (as measured by the creep rate) for the 1177 and 1260°C anneals,
respectively. This indicates that creep of this higher titanium heat
was affected more by solution annealing treatment than by 10% cold
working. The minimum and maximum creep ductilities of the other alloys
corresponded to the prestrained and to the 1260°C annealed material,

respectively.

Results for Aged Samples

 

The prestrained material aged 3000 hr at 650°C exhibited the
maximum yield strength for each heat. The minimum yield strength corre-
sponded to either 1177 or 1260°C samples aged 3000 hr at 760°C, depending
on the alloy. The maximum ultimate strength was for prestrained samples
eged 3000 hr at 650°C with one exception, the 0.15% Ti heat. The lowest
ultimate strength (UTS) was found for the 1260°C treatment; at lower
titanium level an aging treatment. of 3000 hr at 650°C caused the lowest
UTS, and at the higher titanium levels aging 3000 hr at 760°C caused the
lowest UTS. The rupture life was a maximum for prestrained samples
aged at 650°C, and the treatment that produced the minimum rupture life
differed for each alloy. An interesting point is that the 0.15% Ti
heat gave both the maximum and the minimum rupture life for the larger
grain size 1260°C treatment, depending on whether it was aged at 650 or
760°C.

Phases Identified in Aged Alloys

Table 5 lists the phases identified by Debye-Scherrer x-ray dif-
fraction analysis of electrolytically extracted precipitate particles
after 3000 hr of aging at the indicated temperatures. In the 0.15% Ti
heat a combination of MC and M,C type phases was present, but at 760°C
only the MC carbide was found. At the intermediate titanium level
(0.45%) only MC was present at 650°C, while at 760°C a weak trace of MC
and strong lines for M,C were found. At the highest titanium level
investigated (1.20%) the MC structure was present after aging at either
temperature. Thus, we conclude that the higher titanium content has

stabilized the MC-type carbide at higher aging temperatures.

The carbides found in these alloys were complex compounds involving
chromium, molybdenum, and titanium; and in several cases we found two
different lattice parameters that generally fit the hexagonal MpC-type

structure with the same c/a ratio of 1.63. In the case of the MC

structure the -lattice constant did not correspond to that of TiC
(4.33 &) but rather was significantly lower, which indicates that the
smaller molybdenum or chromium atoms were substituting for titanium in

the face-centered cubic MC structure.

Metallography

Initial Microstructures

 

The effect of solution annealing at 1177 or 1260°C on the grain
size for three of the four alloys is shown in Fig. 12. Annealing 1 hr
at 1177°C did not produce & single-phase alloy for most of these heats.
In the alloys containing 0.15 and 1.2% Ti after an 1177°C anneal, large
stringers of second-phase particles were evident. The 0.27 and 0.45% Ti
heats were virtually single phase after the 1177°C heat treatment.

After 1 hr at 1260°C the grain size of each heat was 2 to 4 times that
found after the 1177°C anneal. Also, fewer precipitate particles and
stringers were present after 1 hr at 1260°C.

Microstructures Developed During Aging

Typical structures obtained by interference contrast microscopy
are shown in Fig. 13. This figure compares the precipitate distributions
for samples solution annealed at 1177°C and aged 10,000 hr at either
650 or 760°C. These photographs were taken near the fracture sites of

tensile samples tested at 650°C after aging at the indicated temperatures.

After aging at 650°C the precipitate was generally finer, and the con-
centration of precipitate near grain boundaries appeared to be fairly
heavy, particularly for the low-titanium alloy. After aging 10,000 hr
at 760°C the precipitate was rather coarse, and the concentration of
precipitate near the grain boundary was lower than that found at 650°C.
The precipitate within the grain boundary was also coarse, as shown by
the micrographs of the 0.27 and 0.45% Ti heats in Fig. 13. Little pre-
cipitation occurred in the 1.2% Ti heat, since the stringers evident in
Fig. 13 were actually present to some extent even before aging; this was
shown for the as-solution-annealed condition in Fig. 12.

Microstructures developed during aging 10,000 hr after a l-hr
solution anneal at 1260°C are shown in Fig. 14. These structures are
typical also of those developed in 1500 and 3000 hr of aging and indi-
cate a large variation in optical microstructure with titanium content.
Alloys with lower titanium contents exhibited relatively coarse precipi=-
tate distributions. The 1.2% Ti alloy showed bands of precipitate
stringers after aging at 650°C. Apparently, the stringers present
initially along the hot-working direction of the rod stock were not com-
pletely eliminated even though the material was solution annealed at
1260°C., During subsequent aging these residual second-phese particles
coarsened. Thus, the longitudinal cross section of these aged alloys
exhibited a banded structure, which is similar to that found in the cold-
worked rod before solution annealing. In the 0.45 and 1.2% Ti heats
during aging at 650°C, however, some additional precipitation occurred
on both subgrain and grain boundaries.

The microstructures developed at 760°C after a 1260°C solution
anneal, shown in Fig. 14, were actually quite similar to those found
after the 1177°C anneal and 760°C age (Fig. 13). For the 1.2% Ti heat,

however, the structure developed after a 1260°C anneal was much differ-
ent from that developed in samples annealed at 1177°C. The precipitation
appeared to be a Widmanst&tten distribution; however, the concentration
of precipitate platelets shown in Fig. 14 varied within a given grain.
Generally, a higher concentration of "platelets" was found near grain
boundaries and near clusters of primary precipitate particles. This
"platelet"-type precipitate, which forms primarily after the 1260°C
solution anneal and 760°C age, has been shownl® by transmission electron

‘microscopy to result from precipitation on stacking faults.

very little effect on the structure of the 0.15% Ti heat, but the 1.2% Ti
heat showed much more precipitate in the prestrained samples (Fig. 15)
than in samples aged without prestraining (Fig. 13). In the prestrained

graphic platelet-type precipitate are shown in Fig. 15. Evidently pre-

(the platelets are actually a precipitate on stacking faults,l? as
mentioned previously). This apparent enhancement in formation of
stacking fault precipitate produced by straining this 1.2% Ti alloy
before aging is consistent with the effect of prior straining on forma-
tion of stacking fault precipitates in niobium-doped stainless steels

as reported by Silcock and Tunstallll and Neybour. 12 However, some
differences in the effect of strain on the tendency to precipitate on
stacking faults in steels and in this alloy are discussed in another

paper. 13

Fracture of Samples Tested in Creep

The fracture appearance of creep samples tested after solution
annealing at 1177°C and aging 3000 hr at 760°C is compared in Fig. 16.
The rupture lives (64, 135, and 1335 hr) and the total elongation values
(9.5, 16.7, and 36.8%) of samples with these fractures increased progres-
sively with increasing titanium content. The fracture appearance con-
firms the measured ductility trends, since the fracture mode exhibits a
transition with increasing titanium content from intergranular fracture
for the O. 15% Ti heat [Fig. 16(a)] to transgranular for the 1.2% Ti
heat [Fig. 16(c)]. The intermediate titanium content (0. 45% Ti) also

failed in a predominantly transgranulsr fracture mode; however, the
"tips of the fractured grains [Fig. 16(b)] show regions that appear to

have recrystallized during the creep test. Nevertheless, the creep
elongation of this 0.45% Ti heat after the 760°C heat treatment was only
16.7%, which indicates that the apparent recrystallization that occurred
during creep testing at 650°C did not significantly enhance the ductility.
That is, other heat treatments of this 0.45% Ti heat yielded post-age

~ creep ‘elongation values appreciably greater than 16.7% even though they

In Fig. 16 it is also apparent that the grain size is smallest for
the 1.2% Ti heat. Although the fracture was primarily transgranular in
that heat, many intergranular cracks have opened up along the gage
length in contrast to the alloys with lower titanium concentrations.
Apparently, the grain boundary structure in the higher titanium heat
inhibits the propagation of intergranular cracks even though the nuclea-
tion of cracks in this alloy is apparently quite easy.

Another comparison of fractures for creep tests after various aging
treatments is given in Fig. 17 for three heats with different titanium
contents. The total creep elongations for the samples shown in
Fig. 17(a), (bv), and (c) were 8.3, 42.1, and 24.5%, respectively. Thus,
the alloy with the intermediate titanium content [0.45% Ti, Fig. 17(b)]
was the most ductile of the three alloys, in contrast to the results in
Fig. 16. The grain size and the amount of precipitation evident at this
magnification is greater in Fig. 17(a) and (c) than in Fig. 17(b). As
in Fig. 16, the incidence of intergranular cracks is higher in the most
ductile alloy, Fig. 17(b), than in the othér materials. The fracture
mode is a mixture of transgranular and intergranular fracture in
Fig. 17(a) and (c) and is transgranular in Fig. 17(b)..

An influence of aging time at 760°C on the post-age fracture
appearance for the 0.45% Ti heat is found by comparing Fig. 17(b)

(1500 hr at 760°C) with Fig. 16(b) (3000 hr at 760°C). These two sam-
ples from the same heat were both solution annealed at 1177°C, aged,
and .then creep tested at 40,000 psi and 650°C. The creep properties

(59 hr rupture life and 42.1% elongation) for the sample aged 1500 hr

at 760°C [Fig. 17(b)] were much better than the properties (135 hr

rupture life and 16.7% elongation) obtained after aging 3000 hr at 760°C.

Similarly, the fracture appearance is more transgranular and the amount
of grain deformation is much greater for the samples aged only 1500 hr
[Fig. 17(b)]. Although a significant difference was found in creep

- properties after aging 1500 and 3000 hr at 760°C, the optical microscopy

did not reveal any large differences in structure. This effect of aging

time between 1500 and 3000 hr at 760°C is rather surprising since normally

aging follows a logarithmic rate, which would give small changes for a
factor of 2 difference in aging time, but it should change significantly

for a tenfold difference in aging time. Nevertheless, this observed
large difference in creep behavior between 1500 and 3000 hr of aging
was confirmed by the tensile ductility for this 0.45% Ti heat, as

shown in Fig. 3, p. 7. The 650°C tensile ductility decreased from about
38 to 21% between 1500 and 3000 hr of aging at 760°C. Thus in the

0.45% Ti heat, evidently either the type of precipitate present or its

amount and distribution differed significantly between 1500 and 3000 hr
of exposure at a temperature of 760°C (phases were not identified in the
samples aged 1500 hr).

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have investigated the effects of titanium content, solution
annealing temperature, aging temperature, and aging time on the mechani-
cal properties of modified Hastelloy N at 650°C. In the solution-
annealed condition the 0.002/min yield strength increased and the
ductility was approximately constant with increasing titanium content
from 0.15 to 1.2%. Aging and prestraining both generally increased the
yield strength, but the changes in ductility during aging depended on
(1) alloy content, (2) annealing temperature, and (3) aging temperature.

Phase identification of electrolytically extraced precipitates indi-
cated two types of carbides present. An M,C-type was favored in heats
with low titanium contents or alloys aged at the higher temperature,
760°C. An MC-type carbide was favored at higher titanium contents or
for alloys with a given titanium concentration aged at the lower temper-
ature, 650°C. Thus, the titanium content determined the carbide type,

. whether M;C or MC. The carbide type, its stability, and its morphology

subsequently influenced the deformation and fracture in creep and tensile
tests. Correlations of microstructures and high-temperature mechanical

properties as influenced by the carbon and titanium contents have pre-

viously been investigated.l4

Increasing the titanium content resulted in improved post-age
properties. Apparently, the MC carbide precipitate was more detrimen-
tal to ductility than was the MC carbide precipitate. However, certain
distributions of MC carbides were also detrimental to the ductility.
This was indicated by the 1.2% Ti alloy, which lost ductility and
increased its strength on aging after the 1260°C solution anneal. Since
. only MC carbides were identified in this alloy, the strengthening and
embrittlement are attributed to the precipitation on stacking faults.
Correlations of microstructures and mechanical properties for stacking
fault precipitates have also been made for stainless steels,)®;16
Inconel,” and Hastelloy N.18,1°

Several additional points should be made from these results.

The alloy with the lowest carbon content (i.e., heat 466-548) gener-
ally had the lowest strength and highest ductility. This low carbon
alloy, however, did show a pronounced difference in aging response at
650 and 760°C, which we attribute to the fact that different carbides
were precipitated at the two aging temperatures (i.e., MC at 650°C and
MoC at 760°C).

Overaging could be expected in most of these alloys before 3000 hr
at 760°C, as indicated from the peak in yield strength at 1500 hr in
Fig. 6, p. 9.

The comparison of creep and tensile properties indicated that the
higher solution anneal, which increases the grain size and amount of

solute in solution, actually produces the lowest yield strength. The
weakest alloys in creep (as measured by the highest secondary creep rate)
were found for the 1177°C anneal, which produces a smaller grain size
relative to the structure produced at 1260°C. This dependence of low
yield strength on large grain size and of low creep resistance on small

grain size is typical of the effects of grain size on the strength of

- alloys at elevated test temperatures. At such temperatures, inter-

granular fracture rather than transgranular fracture is favored.

Of the treatments investigated, cold working 10% at room tempera-
ture after a l-hr solution anneal at 1177°C had the greatest effect on
raising the strength and lowering the ductility, both before and after
aging. An exception to this was found for the 1.2% Ti heat, which
exhibited the lowest post-age tensile and creep ductility after a 1260°C
solution anneal and 760°C age. Samples that showed this large ductility
loss had a high concentration of the platelet-type stacking fault
precipitate.

The heat treatments investigated produced variations in the high-
temperature ductility between 5 and 50%, yet the significant point is
that most of these treatments change the room-temperature properties
only slightly. The irony, however, is that these subtle microstructural
modifications caused by titanium additions have affected the creep
behavior of this material even more than we found from this systematic
look at tensile behavior. However, testing in creep does not give a
constant rate of deformation, and the strain rate sensitivity of the
ductility would have made it more difficult to separate effects of aging
time and temperature than it has been for this tensile evaluation. How-
ever, the creep properties follow similar trends with precipitate type
and distribution and are, in fact, most important in reactor applica-
tions of this alloy.
