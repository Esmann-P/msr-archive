1. INTRODUCTION

This report contains background information which is believed to be
pertinent in establishing a policy with respect to the siting of spent-fuel
processing plants and their radioactive waste management facilities. It
contains much basic information that has been published previously; how-
ever, this material has been reviewed and revised, where required, to
serve present needs. In addition, much new information has been included,

particularly on the health and safety aspects of the problem.

The information is organized to conform generally with an outline
transmitted to ORNL by the USAEC (letter from Milton Shaw, USAEC, to
F. L. Culler, Jr., ORNL, dated February 16, 1968). It was developed in
cooperation with Battelle-Northwest, the Idaho Nuclear Corporation, the
Savannah River Plant and the Savannah River Laboratory, the Atlantic
Richfield Hanford Company, and the Atmospheric Turbulence and Diffusion

Laboratory of the Environmental Science Services Administration,

The information is analyzed and discussed principally within the
context of the subject matter contained in individual sections; however,
an attempt has been made to interpret a number of key issues more compre-
hensively in the Summary and Conclusions, Sect. 2. Section 3 contains the
basic data on reactor and fuel characteristics, projections of spent-fuel
processing loads, fuel shipping requirements, and waste characteristics
and production. In Sect. L, fuel reprocessing is discussed very briefly
and waste management technology is considered in significant detail;
considerations of cask design as related to safety in transporting spent
fuel and solidified waste are discussed in Sect. 5; fuel reprocessing and
waste management costs are considered in Sect. 63 environmental and geo-
graphical considerations of siting are reviewed in Sect. 7; and health

and safety aspects are presented in Sect. 8.

2. SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

The principal objective of this study is to identify and characterize
the factors that may influence the growth patterns of the fuel reprocessing
industry. Emphasis is placed on the siting of reprocessing plants and
waste storage and disposal facilities, particularly those for high-level
waste. Another purpose is to explore the need for an AEC policy on siting,
which, while fully meeting the requirements imposed by considerations of
public health and safety, would not present an impediment to the growth

of economic nuclear power.

In this section, a compilation of the key issues under consideration
and the principal conclusions of the study are presented. Then, the
technical information found in the body of the report relating to these

issues and conclusions is summarized.

In this study, it has been assumed that future fuel reprocessing
plants and their associated waste management facilities will be located,
built, and operated subject to the following bases, which are believed to

be practical and reasonable:

(1) The secondary confinement barriers (the cell, vault, water in the
storage pool, and ventilation-filter system) and the tertiary
barrier (the building) will be designed, tested, and routinely
inspected to ensure that their confinement potential is maintained

following exposure to any credible internal forces.

(2) Process and confinement systems will be designed, tested, routinely
inspected, and maintained so that exposure to credible external
events or forces (loss of power, earthquakes, tornados, floods,
hurricanes, impaction by moving vehicles, etc., but not including
acts of war) will not impair the ability to shut down the plant

safely and maintain safe shutdown conditions.

(3) While the circumvention of administrative measures (as well, in
general, as those involving instrument systems) for prevention of
accidents is considered credible, it is considered incredible that

the obvious remedial measures for mitigation of the consequences
2-2

of accidents would not be instituted within hours following a

clear notification of the occurrence of an accident,
2.1 Key Issues

key issues of this study were considered to be the following:

Are new federal regulations needed to govern the siting of fuel
reprocessing plants and waste management facilities, or should
licensing procedures continue to be performed using existing
federal regulations for protection of the public against radia-
tion (LOCFR20), siting of nuclear power reactors (LOCFR100), and
licensing of production and utilization facilities (1OCFRS0)?

Do routine releases or potential releases from accidents control
the siting of fuel reprocessing plants and waste storage facilities
with respect to site boundaries and population centers? After

what period of time will it be necessary to limit the release of
noble-gas fission products and tritium to the atmosphere to pre-
vent worldwide pollution of the troposphere? What local restric-
tions are imposed by the routine release of radioactive materials

to the environment?

Current fuel-cycle economics favor the use of large-capacity fuel
reprocessing plants, Are there technical and safety factors which
indicate preference for either a few large-capacity, or more
numerous small-capacity, fuel reprocessing plants (sites)? Are
there limitations, either inherent or as a matter of prudence,
which should be imposed on the capacity of fuel reprocessing
plants (independent of site size and geography) from a public
safety standpoint? Is the risk to the public increased by higher

inventories of hazardous materials?

Does the storage of high-level liquid waste in subsurface tanks
represent an acceptable waste management approach? (In this
report, "storage" connotes intended retrievability and a high

degree of surveillance, whereas "disposal! connotes the reverse.)
2-3

What are the technically acceptable alternatives to tank storage
of high-level waste? Is a significant economic penalty involved
in providing greater assurance of containment than has been demon-
strated by tank storage of waste? Does immediate solidification
of liquid waste result in an appreciable decrease in risk to the

public?

What are the considerations that affect the decisions to dispose

of radioactive waste on other than government-owned land?

Can the reprocessing plant ever be decontaminated to the degree
necessary to permit subsequent abandonment? If not, is government

ownership of the property required?

Are the hazards or the economics of shipping spent fuels, solid
wastes, and fissile materials of such magnitude that these ship-
ments should be limited to specified routes within regional

boundaries or that shipping off-site should be precluded?

2.2 Conclusions

Minimal impediments to the growth of economic nuclear power,

while meeting the requirements imposed by considerations of

public safety, may result from the promulgation of standards

or regulations that establish (1) the acceptable chronic and

acute radiation exposure of each of the critical organs of men,
women, and children, both in individuals and in critical popula-
tion groups, and (2) performance criteria for engineered safety
features. Information is presently available to allow substantial
progress toward these goals through revision of existing AEC regu-
lations. Any revisions should attempt to provide an appropriate
balance of risk vs benefit on the basis of current technological
alternatives, should be subject to periodic upgrading, and,
preferably, should be sufficiently inclusive to apply to all
nuclear fuel-cycle installations including their waste storage
and disposal facilities. The criteria for chronic exposure of

members of the public should be related to maximum acceptable
2-l

doses and to body organs rather than to permissible concentra-
tions of radioactive effluents in air and water. The latter do
not explicitly consider perhaps more limiting pathways of radia-
tion exposure than those caused by submergence in (or inhalation
of) air and ingestion of water. Given acceptable doses and dose
rates, the designer (with the assistance of experts in the field
of radiation protection) can evaluate all important pathways of
radiation exposure, However, it may be desirable to retain the
"maximum allowable’ concentrations in air and water as point-of-

departure reference values to facilitate monitoring and inspection.

The criteria for acute or emergency exposure of members of the
public surrounding a nuclear facility should provide guidelines
for acceptable doses and dose commitments to all organs and be
developed in conformance with the recommendations of authorita-
tive agencies such as the Federal Radiation Council (FRC) and
the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurement.
The acceptable acute doses and dose commitments for members of
the public would presumably be applicable to the quantitative
determination of a site boundary and the required distance from

a large population center,

The performance criteria for engineered safety features in fuel
reprocessing plants and waste management facilities would pre-

sumably be similar to those proposed for nuclear power reactors
in the proposed Appendix A of 10CFR5SO entitled, "General Design

Criteria for Nuclear Power Plant Construction Permits."

These studies indicate that, based on the current technology of
systems for cleaning off-gas streams from fuel reprocessing
plants, routine releases tend to control the site boundaries.

It is estimated that on-site waste storage facilities do not
materially increase either the rate of routine release of radio-
active material or the potential release of such material as a
result of accidents, provided these facilities are designed to
ensure containment following exposure to internal and external

forces. For large plants, the estimated site boundaries are of
2-5

such a size that economics will probably favor the installation
of noble-gas removal equipment in plants handling more than a few
tons of fuel per day. The development of off-gas systems having
a capability of routinely removing iodine by a factor of about
10° is necessary if FBR fuels are to be processed after decay

periods approximating only 30 days.

Study indicates that the worldwide distribution of 85k and 3u

in the year 2000, assuming the complete release of these nuclides
during fuel reprocessing, results in dose equivalents to man that
are small (<1%) compared with current guidelines for population
exposure. In other words, these nuclides will constitute radiation
problems to the local enviromment long before they cause worldwide

pollution hazards,

These studies indicate that the confinement barriers of fuel
reprocessing plants in the size range of interest, including

their waste storage facilities, can be designed to maintain

their confinement potential following exposure to credible
internal or external forces (excluding acts of war or sabotage).
Regardless of size, plants that are sited and constructed within
a given set of acceptable criteria for chronic and probably acute
exposure of members of the public at the site boundary are con-
sidered to be equivalently safe. The costs of preventive measures
and the relatively expensive confinement systems are estimated to
scale in such a way that larger plants are favored, while the
costs of off-gas treatment facilities required to achieve practi-
cal site sizes in large plants are estimated to be modest. Conse-
quently, the conclusion that economics favors fewer larger plants

is valid.

High-level liquid wastes can be stored safely in tanks that have
been provided with adequate engineered safety features. These
features include, as a minimum, two independent cooling systems
(e.g., submerged coils and a reflux condenser); reinforced
concrete vaults, lined with steel, which are designed either to

withstand credible internal pressures without rupture or to
2-6

relieve these pressures safely by ventilation to a containment
system with large capacitance or to a pool of water for steam
suppression; installation of a contaimment structure,located
above the waste vaults, that is ventilated through a condenser
and filter; provision of spare tankage; and the capability for
prompt, efficient transfer of the waste from any tank to a spare.
Because of the requirement for the continuous removal of heat,
the effectiveness of the containment system will require a very

high degree of survelllance. Liquid waste storage can be con-

doned only as long as the reprocessing plant remains fully active.

In this context, "storage!" does not constitute disposal, and
"perpetual tank storage," even under government auspices, is not

an acceptable substitute for disposal.

The only current, technically acceptable alternative to tank
storage of high-level liquid wastes is immediate solidification
of the wastes. Currently, the disposal of solidified wastes by
emplacement in bedded salt deposits is believed to be the safest
method and has been shown to be technologically feasible. Eco-
nomic studies indicate that the series of operations consisting
of immediate solidification, storage of the solid wastes on-site
for 3 to L years, and shipment and disposal in salt mines, could
be carried out for about 0.038 mill/kwhr (electrical). This is
about 20% more than is estimated for perpetual storage of liquid
wastes in tanks, If the solidified wastes are shipped to salt
mines after storage on-site for only one year (the earliest time
believed to be feasible), the total cost would be about 0.0LL
mill/kwhr. Disposal of wastes of low specific heat generation
rates by hydrofracturing or by emplacement in bedrock caverns
may be acceptable at sites with suitable geology. The applica-
tion of properly engineered safety features, together with a
high degree of surveillance, can result in low risk to the public,

regardless of whether the waste is stored as a solid or liquid.
2-7

Considerations of the long-term hazard of the wastes and the
nearly prohibitive costs for reclaiming large areas of contami-
nated land militate against any disposal (or burial) of wastes

on privately owned land. All radioactive wastes must be main-
tained in a retrievable condition as long as they are retained
on-site. In-tank solidification of wastes, as practiced at
Hanford and SRP, is not an acceptable form of storage on privately
owned land because of the difficulties that would be encountered

at the time of removal,

Government ownership must extend to any subsurface geological
formation used for disposal, as well as to the land areas above.
Control of the land surface must be maintained to prevent
unauthorized explorations of the formations utilized for disposal,
although the surface per se can be put to agricultural or recrea-

tional use,

Plants and storage facilities built with proper foresight can be
decontaminated and/or made sufficiently inaccessible (e.g., by
grouting) so that they do not represent hazards to public safety.
If it can be stipulated that all contaminated equipment and mater-
ials outside the massively shielded concrete canyons and vaults
be removed from the premises before abandonment of the site, then
government ownership is not required. Private ownership of the
site should be permitted, however, only if the site, with all its
facilities, appurtenances, buildings, tanks, cribs, and lands, can
be returned to unrestricted use within some finite time (perhaps

10 to 50 years) after plant retirement.

These studies indicate that shipping of all nuclear materials,
except high-level liquid wastes, can be conducted safely and
economically. The costs of shipping will tend to favor location
of the various fuel cycle and waste disposal facilities in close
proximity. The shipment of liquid wastes is considered to be
unwise because of considerations of steam-pressure buildup within

casks following a loss-of-cooling incident.
2-8
2.3 Magnitude of the Problem

Projections of the Civilian Nuclear Power Program (Table 2.1) indi-
cate that the nuclear economy will expand from about 1 gigawatts (elec-
trical) in 1970 to about 153 gigawatts by 1980, and to about 735 gigawatts
by the year 2000, It is expected that most of the nuclear power stations
will be located in FPC Power Supply Regions III (southeastern states) and
I (northeastern states) by the year 2000, and that the fewest will be found
in Regions VI and VII (the western plains and mountain states). The fuel
shipping industry will also expand at a very rapid rate. The number of
casks to be shipped annually will increase from 30 in 1970 (an average of
one in transit on any given day) to 1200 in 1980 (1 in transit on any
day) and to 9500 in 2000 (85 in transit). Approximate total fuel reproc-
essing rates (in metric tons/year) will increase from 100 in 1970 to 3500
in 1980, and to 15,000 in the year 2000. The heat-generation rate of FBR
core fuels at the time of processing, i.e., after 30 to 75 days of cooling
for FBR fuel and after 150 days for LWR fuel, will be 10 to 6 times as
high as that for LWR fuel. The gross beta activity of FBR core fuels will
be 8 to 5 times that of IWR fuels.

The total radioactivity due to beta emitters in the accumulated
wastes will increase from 210 megacuries in 1970 to 18,800 megacuries in
1980 and to 209,000 megacuries in 2000. The annual generation of high-
level wastes will increase from 17,000 gal in 1970 to 1,000,000 gal in
1980 and to 4,600,000 gal in 2000, If these wastes are stored as liquids,
60,000,000 gal is expected to accumulate by the year 2000, On the other
hand, if they are converted to solid forms, volumes may be reduced by a
factor of about 13.

Another significant type of solid waste will be spent-fuel hulls.
Induced activity will be produced in either stainless steel or Zircaloy

handle or to ship these hulls, In addition to the induced activities, up
to 0.1% of the plutonium in the fuel can be associated with the cladding.

2.4 Technical Considerations

Present-day fuel reprocessing plants make use of organic-aqueous
solvent-extraction processes to separate U, Pu, and Th from mixtures of
fission products and inert materials. Volatile fission products are
separated during dissolution of the fuel, These fission products, and
radioactive particulates from the process are removed from the plant
off-gas, as required before discharge, by sorption, chemical interactions, »”
and filtration. In addition to the treatment of normal radioactive
effluent streams, special consideration must be given, during the design
and operation of these plants, to the containment of radioactivity in
the event of accidents or natural phenomena such as earthquakes and

tornados.

The future trends in plant design for the nuclear power industry
must take both safety and economy into account while reprocessing fuels
containing higher quantities of fissionable materials and fission products
at shorter cooling times. This implies more severe problems at almost all
stages of reprocessing, including shipment and management of the waste
effluents. ~

Finally, in designing these plants, consideration must be given to

the problem of eventual decommissioning of the plants and the return of "
the site to other uses. Much of the technology for resolving these prob- *
lems either exists or is being developed. This includes the design of -

carriers for safe transport of fuels, efficient mechanical head-end
equipment, continuous dissolution equipment, high-speed solvent-extrac-
tion contactors, methods for improved separation and containment of
fission-product gases and particulates, and improved methods of waste

management,

High-level wastes originate mainly from the first cycle of solvent
extraction and contain greater than 99.9% of the nonvolatile fission
products. The present practice is to concentrate and store these wastes
on an interim basis in underground carbon and stainless steel tanks, which
are equipped with devices for removing decay heat if necessary. More

than 80,000,000 gal of waste are now in storage at AEC production sites. .
2-11

Although corrosion data indicate tank lifetimes in excess of 100 years
might be expected, there have been 15 known instances of tank failure,
all in carbon steel systems at Hanford and Savannah River. Eleven of
the failures have occurred at Hanford, where it is estimated that liquid
waste containing 140,000 curies of 130g has leaked to the ground and
been retained in the soil about 10 ft below the tank bottoms, In one of
the four tank failures at the Savannah River Plant (SRP), about 700 gal
of waste may have escaped the liner, although ground water has shown
contamination levels equivalent to only a few gallons of waste. The
causes of these failures are established as stress-corrosion cracking
and/or thermal stress of the reinforced concrete structures, and these
factors are being taken into account in new tankage under construction;
however, it is clear that many of the liquid waste storage facilities now

in existence do not merit confidence in their long-term integrity.

Waste management plans at Hanford call for separating about 95% of
the 70Sr and 137s from the waste and concentrating the residue, after a
suitable decay period, by in-tank evaporation until the residual salts
solidify into a massive cake. The strontium and cesium fractions are to
be solidified and packaged for interim storage in on-site storage basins
pending decisions on their long-term disposition, At SRP, the most prac-
tical, safe, and economical long-term alternative to present tank storage
practices is believed to be storage of these wastes in vaults excavated
in crystalline bedrock about 1500 ft beneath the plant site. Toward this
end, exploratory drilling has been done, hydrologic data have been collec-
ted, and safety analyses have been made, As presently conceived, the
storage facility would consist of tunnels, about 30 ft wide, 15 ft high,
and 1000 to 2000 ft long, radiating from a central access shaft that
extends vertically from the surface. At ICPP, all stored waste solutions
are converted to granular solids in the Waste Calcining Facility (WCF).

These solids are stored in underground stainless steel bins.

The storage of liquid wastes from power-reactor fuel reprocessing
will be even more difficult than the storage of current production wastes
because of their higher heat-generation rates, significant rates of radio-

lytic hydrogen production, and corrosive nature. Nevertheless, it should
2-12

be possible to store them safely for a limited period of time and at an
acceptable cost, provided adequate engineered safeguards are built into

the storage systems.

The alternative to long-term or perpetual storage of wastes in tanks
is conversion of the wastes to thermally and radiolytically stable solids
of low solubility for burial in selected geologic formations or storage
in man-made vaults. Processes for conversion of these wastes to solids
are being developed both in the United States and overseas. The four U.S.
solidification methods currently emphasized are the pot, spray, phosphate-
glass, and fluidized-bed processes. The pot, spray, and phosphate-glass
processes have been demonstrated for the AEC on a full-radioactivity-level,
engineering scale in the WSEP at Hanford. The fluidized-bed process has
been demonstrated at the ICPP in a large-capacity plant operating on inter-
mediate-level feeds since 1963. Within the next few years, the AEC's waste
solidification development program of currently known concepts will be
completed. The processes will have been demonstrated using wastes from
advanced fuels, and effects of severe temperature and radiation on the
properties of the solidified waste products will have been measured and
evaluated. This technology will provide a reliable basis for the design

and safe operation of waste solidification plants.

Once solidified, the wastes may be stored safely on-site (prior to
disposal) and at less expense than can the corresponding liquid wastes.
Conceptual designs have been published for the storage of encapsulated,
solidified wastes in water-filled canals and air-cooled vaults, and for
the storage of granular solids from fluidized-bed processing in air-cooled

bins.

The most promising method for disposal of the solidified high-level
wastes involves thelr placement in natural salt formations. In this
regard, a 19-month demonstration disposal of high-level radioactive waste
solids was carried out in a salt mine at Lyons, Kansas, using spent reactor
fuel in lieu of actual solidified wastes. In the course of this program,
most of the technical problems related to disposal in salt were resolved.
The feasibility and safety of handling highly radioactive materials in an

underground enviromment were demonstrated; salt was shown to be stable
ay

2-13

under the effects of heat and radiation; and data on the creep and plastic
flow characteristics of salt were obtained, thereby making possible the
design of a safe disposal facility. Cost studies indicate that this method
is economically acceptable. The 2000 acres of salt that may be committed
to disposal purposes by the year 2000 is only a small fraction of the
500,000 square miles that are underlain by salt in the United States.

Dry openings that could be utilized for the storage of radioactive
solid wastes can be excavated in rocks other than salt; however, investi-
gations are needed to delineate the effects of heat and radiation on the
rock media, as well as to define more precisely the geological conditions
that determine the usefulness of local sites within the most desirable

geographic regions.

Intermediate- and low-level wastes are usually large in volume and
are handled by storage in tanks, by disposal to the ground, or by partial
decontamination and release to surface waters, The release of large
quantities of these wastes to the environment has been controlled so that
the exposure of members of the public from this source has been consider-
ably less than the limits recommended by the ICRP and other authoritative
bodies. However, the trend is toward less dependence on envirommental
disposal and greater emphasis on methods for concentration and containment
of the radioactive material. Evaporation, ion exchange, and coprecipita-
tion and coagulation processes are frequently used for concentrating the
radionuclides, and waste-water recycle schemes have been studied. The
radioactive concentrates from treatment may be insolubilized by incorpora-
tion in asphalts or certain plastic materials for long-term storage, land

burial, or disposal in salt mines.

Disposal of intermediate- and low-level wastes by a method based on
the technique of hydraulic fracturing has been demonstrated to be both
safe and economical. This method prevents radionuclides from being
released, via any credible accident, into the biological environment by
depositing them deep underground in a solid matrix. The technique is
limited, however, to use at sites that are underlain by suitable geological

formations of low permeability.
2-1

Tritium causes difficulty in waste management because it is unre-
sponsive to separation and concentration by conventional procedures. For
example, the 75 to greater than 99% of the tritium in spent fuel that
appears in the low-level liquid wastes cannot be sufficiently diluted
with process water in the plant to obtain the concentration specified in
10CFR20 (i.e., 3 x 1073 uc/cc) before discharge to surface waters. Tritium
can be released more effectively as a gas to the atmosphere by vaporizing
the tritiated water up the stack; under this condition, the tritium would

be dispersed widely and diluted well below acceptable concentrations.

Currently, from 2,000,000 to 3,000,000 £3 of low- and intermediate-
level solid wastes are buried annually above the water table on state or
federal land; about one-fourth of this volume is from commercial sources.
Projections of future land requirements for burial of the solid wastes
that will accrue from power -reactor fuel reprocessing indicate that land
consumption will increase from 1 acre/year in 1970 to 80 acres/year in
2000, and that the accumulated area of land devoted to this purpose should
increase from lj acres in 1970 to 940 acres in 2000. In the interests of
land conservation, it may be desirable to store part or all of this material
in salt mines. Sufficient space already has been mined in bedded salt to
contain all solid wastes that are expected to be generated through the
year 2020, It should also be possible to utilize part of the space that
may be mined for disposal of high-level solidified wastes.

2.5 Transportation Considerations

The transportation of radioactive materials to and from the reprocess-
ing plant is an important consideration in plant siting. Fuel reprocessing
plants receive fuel elements from the reactor, export purified fissile and
fertile materials to fuel fabrication plants, and transport wastes to desig-

nated disposal sites.

Heavily shielded containers are used for shipping both spent fuel and
solidified waste. The main difference is in the integrity of the material
that is being shipped. Available evidence, based on experience, is that

all types of spent-fuel shipping casks can be designed to meet present
2-15

contamination requirements. Ruptured spent fuel must be encapsulated
prior to shipment, while fast reactor fuel will probably have to be
encapsulated with sodium for heat dissipation purposes. A canister and
closure can be designed such that containment of the contents is main-
tained even under accident conditions. Containment may be lost due to
relative deflections of the lid and cask body in a 30-ft impact; however,
tests have shown that feasible shock-absorbing members can sufficiently
dissipate energy and distribute the impact load in such a manner that

seals are maintained.

A reprocessor has more control over the solid wastes leaving his
plant than he has over the spent fuel entering it. Decay times of the
wastes are easily varied without incurring the economic penalties that
exist for spent fuel. In addition, waste containers can be designed for
shipment via either truck or rail, whereas there may be little choice
available for transporting spent fuel. The waste product will be doubly
contained, first by a welded steel container and then by the shipping
cask itself. The calcined or glass waste product is relatively immobile;
although the 30-ft impact accident condition could create some fracturing
of the product, this amount would be of little consequence. The 1L75°F
fire accident condition could increase the center-line temperature of
calcined wastes above 1650°F, but the consequences of this thermal tran-
sient do not appear to be severe. Pressure increases would be small,
certainly within the resistance capabilities of the steel pot whose
maximum temperature will not rise more than 300°F above normal. In short,
the degree of control over solid waste shipments, coupled with the fact
that the fission products are in a relatively nondispersible form, indi-

cate that such waste shipments should be safe,

The shipment of high-level liquid wastes is not considered safe
because of the possibility of radiolytic gas explosions or steam-pressure

buildup within casks following loss -of-cooling incidents.

Considerable experience has been accumulated in the shipment of
fissile material in both liquid and solid forms. Shipments are made in
a birdcage-type package, often a 55-gal drum in which a central cavity

is formed by metal, wood, or other support. Since the material is free
2-16

from most fission products, little or no shielding is required; and, since
there is negligible heat evolved from the material, substantial insulation
may be installed to protect the material from external fires. For these
reasons, the shipment of fissile and fertile products in either liquid or
solid forms is feasible. Designs of product containers that will meet
(and exceed) the requirements of the shipping regulations are available,
Potential damage resulting from severe accidents may be expected to be

minimal and thus should not affect siting of the plant.
2.6 Economic Considerations

Present-day spent-fuel processing costs, including waste disposal,
are approximately 0.2 mill/kwhr (electrical) for standard light-water
reactors (LWR's). Unit reprocessing costs are expected to decrease
significantly as plant size increases; unit waste disposal costs will
also decrease, but not as rapidly as reprocessing costs. The combined
total reprocessing cost for LWR fuel is projected to decrease to 0,1
mill/kwhr (electrical) by 1985-1990 and to 0,05 mill/kwhr (electrical)
by 2010, assuming that our cost estimates are valid up to about a LO-
metric ton/day capacity for IWR fuel or a 20-metric ton/day capacity for
FBR fuel and that plant size is permitted to increase to these levels by
about the year 2010. (By 2020, there should be about ten reprocessing
plants in operation in the U.S., with capacities ranging from 20 to 4O
metric tons/day for LWR fuel or 10 to 20 metric tons/day for FBR fuel.)
In making these estimates, we have used 1970 dollars and made no allow-

ance for escalation,

Reprocessing costs for FBR fuels are projected to be about twice
those of LWR fuels on a weight basis, but can be about the same on a
mills/kwhr (electrical) basis if the (core-plus-blanket) FBR burnup
averages about 60% higher (and the thermal efficiency averages 25% higher)
than for IWR's. If individual reprocessing plant sizes are limited to
10 metric tons/day for LWR fuel or to 5 metric tons/day for FBR fuel, the
cost will stop decreasing by about 1990. In this case, about 30 reproc-
essing plants would be needed in the United States by the year 2010, at
2-17

a cost penalty of 75% as compared with ten larger plants ($1.3 billion vs
$0.8 billion per year in 2010).

Present-day spent~fuel shipping costs for IWR fuels are about 0,020
to 0.025 mill/kwhr (electrical) for T700-mile shipments (estimated average
distance in 1970). Our estimates for 1000-mile shipments of spent FBR
fuel vary from 0.0L to 0.11 mill/kwhr (electrical), for a variety of pro-
posed designs. The costs for 700-mile shipments would be about 15% less.
Assuming that reprocessing plants can be built in all geographical regions
of the United States (as required by economic optimization of shipping and
reprocessing cost totals), shipping costs should decrease about 20% by the
year 2000 as the average shipping distance decreases from 700 miles (in
1970) to 350 miles; they should decrease an additional 10% as a result of
technological improvements. Shipping costs in the year 2000 are projected
to be $120 million for spent fuel, plus $15 million for recovered uranium
and plutonium. If siting policies are sufficiently restrictive to increase
the average shipping distance to 1000 miles, the total costs for the year
2000 would increase from $135 million to $200 million (not including an
estimated $6 million increase in inventory charges associated with

increased shipping time).

The current cost for perpetual tank storage of neutralized wastes at
Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc, (NFS) has been reported to be about 0.012
mill/kwhr (electrical); however, this does not include operating costs or
any interest or return on investment during the first 15 years. On a
somewhat more conservative basis, we estimate a total of 0.031 to 0,032
mill/kwhr (electrical) for perpetual tank storage of acid wastes in a
plant reprocessing 688 metric tons/year of spent fuel irradiated to
33,000 Mwd/ton, 0.03l to 0,039 mill/kwhr (electrical) for waste manage-
ment by a series of operations consisting of interim liquid storage, pot
calcination, interim storage of solids, shipment, and disposal in a salt
mine. Waste management unit costs decrease only slowly as the plant size
increases, perhaps 35% as the size increases by a factor of 10. Thus, in
1970, waste management may contribute 15% of a total reprocessing cost of
0.20 mill/kwhr (electrical), but may contribute 25% of a total of 0.07
mill/kwhr (electrical) in the year 2010.
2-18

These reprocessing and waste management cost estimates probably
should be revised upward about 10% to allow for improved containment
systems costs to cover enhanced removal of rare gases and iodine, improved
containment of internal explosions, and earthquake-resistant design and
construction, This alternative appears to be more economical than accept-
ing the extremely large and remote sites that would otherwise be required
for large reprocessing plants, especlally for those handling short-cooled
FBR fuel.

We have not estimated the cost of inspection to safeguard against
the diversion of fissile material to unauthorized use; instead, we have
assumed this to be a national or international policing cost that would
not be charged directly to the electric power industry. This cost should,
however, scale in such a manner that fewer larger reprocessing plants,

rather than many small ones, would be favored.
2.7 Siting Considerations

In general, except possibly for dispersive events caused by acts of
sabotage or war, engineered safety features can be devised that will miti-
gate practically all of the environmental or geographical deficiencies of
a site. However, in some cases (e.g., those involving the location of a
plant on a known active fault or in the center of a metropolitan city),
an economic analysis of the costs of development, design, construction,
and testing of special, engineered safety features will dictate against
a radical departure from the conservative norm. The following sections

will discuss environmental and geographical factors in site selection.

2.7.1 Environmental Considerations

The envirommental factors of principal concern in site selection are

meteorology, geology, hydrology, and geoseismology.

Meteorology. - An understanding of the meteorology of a site is
important because the atmosphere provides a potential means of conveying

an active, and practically unavoidable, threat to the safety of persons
2-19

downwind. Conversely, 1t can serve as a very large sink for the safe
dispersal of radioactive materials if local problems can be avoided.
Fortunately, meteorology is perhaps the best understood and most easily
quantified of the envirommental factors that influence siting. The
methodology for estimating concentrations and deposition of materials is
relatively well established, and appropriate data for a given site may
usually be obtained by relatively simple measurements, complemented with

data from local or regional weather stations.

Geology and Hydrology. - The geology and hydrology of the site of a
nuclear fuel reprocessing plant can influence: (1) the foundations of

the plant, (2) the emplacement of underground waste-storage tanks, (3)

the water supply, (lL) the routine disposal of liquid and solid radioactive
wastes, (5) the danger from earthquakes, and (6) the consequences of an
accidental release of significant quantities of radioactive materials.
Geologic conditions that would be favorable for one of these considerations
might be unfavorable for another; therefore, an ideal environment does not
exist, and the selection of any actual site will require compromise. Per-
haps the only valid generalization is that all of these considerations
will be easier to evaluate if the geology and hydrology of the site are
simple and predictable,

In connection with the consequences of accidental release, simplicity
in the hydrologic and climatologic environment is particularly desirable.
Only in cases where the conditions can be analyzed in detail and with con-
siderable confidence can predictions of the possible results of an accident
be made. These predictions will allow proper precautions to be taken
against such an eventuality, as well as suggest effective remedial measures
in the event of an accident. A simple geologic and hydrologic enviromment
also makes it possible to determine, with confidence, the most effective
local methods for ultimate disposal, the maximum quantities of radioactive
material that may be released to the enviromment, and the best methods for
monitoring the enviromment to make certain that safe levels of discharge

are not being exceeded.
2-20

Geoseismology. - Faults, vibrations, and tsunamis are the major earth-
quake-induced phenomena to be considered in the siting and the design of
nuclear facilities (including fuel reprocessing plants). All of these are
important for some sites along the West Coast of the United States; on the
other hand, vibratory effects are generally the sole concern in the eastern
part of the country. In many regions of the United States, it appears that
earthquake-induced phenomena can be adequately considered through currently
acceptable engineering practices; however, in some highly seismically
active regions, the high degree of geoselsmological conservatism requires

that unique and presently improved designs be considered.

2.7.2 Geographic Considerations

 

The primary consideration in acquiring a site for a fuel reprocessing
plant is to provide sufficient distance between the plant and private lands
to ensure that the general public will not be harmed by either normal oper-
ations or by credible accidents, Second, the site should be located at a
place where the aggregate cost of raw materials, transportation of materials
to the plant, manufacturing, and transportation of finished products to the
market will be at a minimum. In present plants, the basic raw materials
are water, nitric acid, solvent, and aggregate for concrete. Either a
railroad spur or a waterway with barging facilities is a practical necessity
since some spent-fuel shipping casks weigh 50 to 100 tons. Paved highways
are necessary for trucking smaller casks, raw materials, finished products,
and waste. Manufacturing costs are dependent on an adequate supply of
skilled labor and on the prevailing wage scales in the vicinity. Conven-
iently located housing and community facilities are desirable. Long
commuting distances, poor social facilities, and undesirable climates
all tend to result in a large labor turnover. The plant must have adequate
acreage for possible future expansion, suitable soll or rock foundations
for heavy concrete structures, and reliable electric power, preferably from
two independent sources. Ideally, the plant should be located relatively
near power reactors and sites designated for the disposal of high- and

low-level wastes.
2-21

Site Size. - The site boundary is determined most accurately and
restrictively by the requirement that the direct exposure of the surround-
ing public to radioactive gaseous or liquid effluents must be maintained
at allowable levels. Penetrating radiation that escapes through the

shielding used in the plant is not normally a consideration.

Studies at Hanford indicate that controlled areas extending 0.5 to
1 mile from the plant are desirable for the control of "nuisance contami-
nation" resulting from a temporary loss of control of relatively small
quantities of radioactive materials. Such minor releases might result
from outside decontamination operations on large pieces of process equip-
ment or shipping casks. This is not an absolute limitation; it is possible
(i.e., at increased cost) to house those facilities that would potentially
disperse low-level contaminants. It was found that the routine release of
noxious nonradioactive chemicals to the atmosphere (most significantly NO, )
would dictate a site boundary about 1 mile from the stack. This is also
not an absolute limitation, since such gases may be removed from stack
effluents to practically any extent required using present technology.
The discharge of low-level liquid radioactive effluents is determined
primarily by the relative flow rate of groundwater and surface water as

a function of distance from the plant and the subsequent use of the water.

Surrounding Population Density. - Federal regulations (10CFR100)

 

specify that there shall be a zone of low population (presently not quan-
titatively defined) surrounding a reactor plant. The primary concern is

to prevent the general public from receiving somatically or genetically
significant doses of radiation. The cost of indemnification is also of
concern; claims resulting from overexposure to radiation during an accident

would probably be directly proportional to the number of persons involved.

Land and Water Usage. - Special considerations are required when fuel

 

reprocessing plants are located in areas where there are mechanisms for
reconcentration of the radioactive effluents and pathways for ingestion

920 13708) are known

by the public. Since certain radionuclides (e.g., 7 Sr,
to concentrate in crops and fish, the restrictions on the discharge of
low-level liquid waste effluents containing these nuclides to surface

waters subsequently used for irrigation or fishing may be more severe
2-22

than if the water were used only for drinking. Deposition of radioiodine
from gaseous wastes on grass, followed by the cow-milk pathway to the thy-
roids of small children, may result in maximum permissible air concentrations
which are lower by a factor of 500 to 1000 than those for inhalation.

Relation of the Plant to Other Nuclear Facilities. - The fuel reproc-

 

essing plant should be designed and located to take into account adjacent
nuclear facilities, including reactor plants, other reprocessing plants,
and waste disposal sites. Effluents from the plant must not mask nuclear
instrumentation at adjacent sites. Accidents in the plant should not cause
undue haste and unsafe evacuations of adjacent sites. In addition, the
effluents from each plant must be restricted in such a way that their
combined effect will not endanger the safety of the public. In practice,
the effect of these restrictions has been minimal at the production plants
and national laboratories; the incremental costs of additional engineered
safety features are generally offset by the decreased costs resulting from

shared personnel, services, and facilities.

Regional Distribution of Potential Sites. - Results of a rather general

 

study (see Sect. 7.2.5), which takes into account the results presented
elsewhere in this report, indicate that there are many potential sites
for fuel reprocessing plants in each of the electric utility districts in
the United States. Of the districts that are predicted to have a large
concentration of power reactors, it appears that the least difficulty
would be encountered by siting in the Southeast because of the low popu-
lation density, adequate access to railroads, and low selsmic probability;
the most difficulty should be encountered in siting near the West Coast,
primarily because of the high seismic probability.

2.8 Health and Safety Aspects of Plant Siting

The principal criterion for judging the adequacy of a site for a fuel
reprocessing plant is the provision that no undue risk exists with regard
to public health and safety in the surrounding areas. Present and foresee-
able technology requires that such plants routinely discharge small quan-

tities of radioactive materials to the atmosphere; for this reason, and
2-23

also because of the large inventory of hazardous materials, there is

always a small, but finite, probability of a major discharge,

2.8.1 Routine Release of Radioactive Materials

 

The consequences of, and the site boundary distances dictated by,
routine releases from fuel reprocessing plants were estimated by assuming
the following: (1) ORNL meteorological conditions, (2) the complete
release of noble gases and tritium, (3) iodine decontamination factors
(DF's) of 1000 (present technology) and 107 in plants for processing
highly irradiated fuels after cooling periods of 150 and 30 days, respec-
tively, and (4) a particulate-release-rate model that agrees satisfactorily
with existing data. For reference purposes, the acceptable concentrations
at the site boundary were selected as one-third of the air concentrations
listed in 10CFR20, Appendix B, Table II, Column 1, with the exception that
the 131; concentrations were reduced by a factor of 700 to account for the

grass-cow-milk pathway to the thyroids of small children,

Table 2.2 compares the average annual air concentrations of radio-
nuclides at the (dictated) site boundaries of conceptual plants with those
estimated for the NFS, MFRP, and BNFP plants. The downwind doses resulting
from the normal release of radionuclides from plants are estimated to be

controlled by the noble gases and iodine,

The magnitude of the distances to the site boundary estimated for
plants of large capacity indicates the need for at least partial removal
of the noble gases and removal of a larger fraction of the iodine than was
assumed for the analysis. On the basis that the site boundaries dictated
by routine releases should be no greater than those dictated by "upper
limit accident," equipment for removing 50 to 99% of the noble gases
appears necessary for plants having capacities of more than a few tons
per day; an iodine removal capability greater than that demonstrated in
present technology will be required for LWR plants having capacities
greater than about 6 to 10 tons/day, while DF's as high as 10° will be
required for FBR plants if the FBR fuel is to be processed after decay
times of only 30 days.

2.8.2 Releases from Upper Limit Accidents

The consequences of upper limit accidents were estimated assuming
that the acceptable annual dose commitments resulting from exposure to
the radioactive cloud or inhalation at the site boundary are values
recommended by the National Committee on Radiation Protection for annual
occupational exposure. The dose commitment analysis was based on the
assumptions of flat downwind terrain and exposure to the radioactive
cloud. The consequences of downwind ground contamination and additional
exposures by such phenomena as reentrainment were not considered as
mechanisms that would limit plant siting. Excessive levels of ground
contamination would cause inconveniences, require expensive decontamina-
tion procedures, and result in property loss; however, they probably
would not present an unavoidable threat to the health and safety of the
public.

In Table 2.3, the total dose commitments resulting from various upper
limit accidents at the accident-dictated site boundaries of the conceptual
plants are compared with estimated dose commitments at the site boundaries
of the NFS, MFRP, and BNFP plants. Confinement and ventilation systems in
fuel reprocessing plants remove particulates of nonvolatiles dispersed
under accidental conditions to such an extent that the upper limit acci-
dents are controlled by the release of such volatile and semivolatile
materials as the noble gases, lodine, ruthenium, cesium, and tellurium.
The maximum site boundaries for all plants are estimated to be determined
by the whole-body dose resulting from the release of volatile "fresh"
fission products from a nuclear excursion (304 and 1% release of iodines
from IWR and FBR plants, respectively, plus 100% release of the noble

gases).

Credible upper limit accidents in well-designed facilities for the
interim storage of either liquid or solid wastes are estimated to be
inconsequential with respect to those from processing operations in the
plant. It is assumed that future liquid waste storage facilities will
be designed to maintain thelr containment potential when exposed to
credible internal (e.g., a hydrogen-air explosion) or external (e.g.,

loss of power, earthquake, etc.) forces. The consequences of a liquid

waste tank boildown that occurs over several days (assuming that no
remedial action is taken) with the accompanying release of radioactive
material directly to the atmosphere by entrainment in the steam, or a
loss of canal water with resultant meltdown and entrainment of calcined
waste, are sufficiently serious that they must be rendered incredible by

the provision of adequately engineered safety features.

3. MAGNITUDE OF THE PROBLEM

This section contains the data characterizing the fuel reprocessing
and waste management operations associated with the civilian nuclear
power economy that is projected for the United States over the next
three to four decades. Much of the material serves as the basis for
further calculations and considerations in subsequent sections of the
report. A recent projection of nuclear power growth and of fuel reproc-
essing requirements for the entire nation is broken into components
corresponding to the geographical regions of the Federal Power Commission;
design and performance characteristics are summarized for a typical light-
water reactor (LWR) and a liquid-metal-cooled fast breeder reactor (LMFBR);
isotopic compositions and radiation characteristics of the irradiated
fuels from these reactors, and of the wastes generated by the reprocessing
of these fuels, are tabulated; and projections of spent-fuel shipping
requirements and waste management operations are made. For the primary
purposes of this report, only projections through the end of this century
are emphasized; however, in many of the following tables and figures, the
forecasts have been extended an additional 20 years as a matter of general

interest,
3.1 Projected Nuclear Power Buildup and Reprocessing Loads

The projection of nuclear power growth and fuel reprocessing require-
ments that served as a basis for this study was taken from Phase 3, Case
42, a study made by the AEC Systems Analysis Task Force (SATF) in April
1968.% This particular case considers power generation by only two reactor
types. Light-water reactors predominate until the early 1990's, but fast
breeder reactors go on-stream during the 1980-1981 period and assume an

increasingly significant role thereafter (Table 3.1 and Fig. 3.1). The

 

"More recent projections have been made by the AEC (see USAEC Report
WASH-1149, in press), but these forecasts were not available at the
inception of this study. The differences between them and Phase 3,
Case lj2 are not of sufficient magnitude to affect the fundamental
thesis and conclusions of this report.

total installed nuclear generating capacity increases from 1l,000 Mw
(electrical) in 1970 to 153,000 Mw in 1980, and reaches 735,000 Mw in
the year 2000, The quantities of spent fuel discharged by reactor and
by fuel type are presented in Table 3.2. In the case of IWR's, enriched
uranium and plutonium recycle fuels are listed separately; the LMFBR

estimates include both core and blankets.

The Phase 3, Case L2 projections for the entire United States were
apportioned into the eight geographical power supply regions of the
Federal Power Commission (FPC), as shown in Fig, 3.2.1 This was done
by using previous AEC estimates of nuclear power growth through 1980°
and a distribution proposed by Searl’ for the year 2000, For the pres-
ent study, the AEC data were regrouped according to FPC region to serve
for the 1970-1980 period. For the period between 1980 and 2000, the data
were smoothed and normalized in order to yield the same distribution in
the year 2000 as was forecast by Searl. Finally, for the years following
2000, the assumption was made that the nuclear power distribution remained
unchanged, Table 3.3 presents the resulting projections of installed
nuclear power capacity for the FPC regions, and these data are presented

graphically in Fig. 3.3.

The projected regional distribution of spent fuel is given in Table
3.4 and Fig. 3.4L. These data were generated by assuming a time lag be-
tween power generation and spent-fuel discharge computed on the basis
that the distribution in any year is proportional to two-thirds of the
power distribution one year earlier, and to one-third of the power distri-

bution two years earlier. Mathematically,

Projected Discharges of Spent Fuel in the Eight FPC Regions.
3-11

The projected annual discharge of fissile plutonium isotopes in the
eight FPC power supply regions during the period 1970-2020 is presented
in Table 3.5 and Fig. 3.5. Again, a time lag, which was computed in the
same mamner as that used to estimate the distribution of spent-fuel dis-

charges, was applied.
3.2 Reactor Design and Performance Characteristics

Two 1000-Mw (electrical) reactors whose design and performance charac-
teristics have been previously defined were chosen as representative types
for this study (Table 3.6). The LWR is the reference pressurized-water
type described in a recent AEC-sponsored task force study. Fueled with
zircaloy-clad UO, (3.3% 235
34.8 Mi/metric ton and achieves a fuel exposure of 33,000 Mwd/metric ton,

U), it operates at an average power level of

The IMFBR is the reference oxide design that was developed by Atomics
International (AI) for the Systems Analysis Task Force Study.” It is
fueled with stainless-steel -clad U0, --15.6% Pu0
less-steel-clad, slightly enriched UO

5 in the core, and stain-

5 in the axial and radial blankets.
Fuel exposures of 80,000 Mwd/metric ton at a specific power of 175 Mw/metric
ton, 2500 Mwd/metric ton at 5.5 Mw/metric ton, and 8100 Mwd/metric ton at
10 Mw/metric ton are achieved in the core, the axial blarket, and the
radial blanket respectively. The projected refueling cycle is once every
153 days, when one-third of the core and the axial blanket and about three-

sixteenths of the radial blanket are discharged.

3.3 Radiation Characteristics of Irradiated Fuels and of Wastes
Generated During Spent-Fuel Processing

The masses, radioactivity, and thermal power of fission products,
actinide isotopes, and activation products present in the irradiated fuels
from the LWR and the IMFBR described above, and in the wastes generated
during spent-fuel processing, were calculated as a function of decay time
using the computer program ORIGEN. The nuclear characteristics of the
Diablo Canyon Nuclear Power Plant reactor were used in the calculations

for the reference LWR since some of the required data were not given for

the reference reactor that was described in the task force report. The
IWR was assumed to operate at a constant average specific power of 30 Mw/

metric ton (equivalent to a load factor of 0.85).

In the case of the AI Reference Oxide LMFBR, the core was assumed
to operate at a constant average specific power of 148.15 Mw/metric ton
for 540 days (equivalent to a load factor of 0.85). The specific power
of the axial blanket was input as a step function, varying from 2.27
Mw/metric ton (at startup) to 6.99 Mw/metric ton (at a discharge time
of 540 days) and averaging L.63 Mw/metric ton, The specific power of
the radial blanket varied from 2.32 Mw/metric ton (at startup) to 1.38
Mw/metric ton (at discharge) and averaged 8.4L Mw/metric ton. In this
study, it is assumed that the core and blankets are mixed proportionately
("homogenized") prior to processing, yielding a fuel mixture having an

average burnup of 33,000 Mwd/metric ton.

Transient conditions of about 700 nuclides in the current data
libraries of ORIGEN were calculated for each reactor, and the results
are presented in the form of summary tables of the most significant
isotopes present in spent fuels and wastes in terms of mass, activity,
and thermal power, These properties are tabulated for each isotope and
for each element, All results are based on one metric ton of uranium
charged to the IWR, and on one metric ton of uranium-plus-plutonium

originally charged in the "homogenized" IMFBR core and blankets.

3.3.1 Diablo Canyon Reference LWR

Fission Products, - Tables 3.7 through 3.12 present the calculated
masses, radioactivity, and thermal power of significant fission products
present in the wastes generated by the processing of spent Diablo Canyon
reference fuel (or in the spent fuel before reprocessing) as a function
of postirradiation decay times of 90 to 365,250 days. Tables 3.7, 3.9,
and 3.11 give the weight, activity, and thermal power, respectively, for
individual isotopes; these same data, summed for each fission-product

element, are given in Tables 3.8, 3.10, and 3,12 respectively.

Actinides. - Tables 3.13 through 3.2L present the calculated masses,
radioactivity, and thermal power of important actinide isotopes (and
elements) present in discharged Diablo Canyon Reference LWR fuel, and in
the wastes generated by the reprocessing of this fuel. The concentrations
of many of the transuranium isotopes in the wastes depend on the efficiency
of uranium and plutonium recovery during reprocessing, as well as on the
decay time prior to reprocessing. In these calculations, we have assumed
that reprocessing is done 90 days after the fuel is discharged from the
reactor, and that 0.5% each of the uranium and the plutonium is lost to

the waste.

Cladding. - Tables 3.25 through 3.30 present the calculated masses,
radioactivity, and thermal power of activation products of the Zircaloy-l
cladding and Inconel spacers used in current IWR fuel assemblies. As can
be seen from Table 3.27, the calculated 9570 _Nb activity predominates for
about the first half-year following discharge of the fuel from the reactor;
however, rather substantial contributions from 60¢o, 55, and 631 prevail
thereafter. These latter nuclides are derived from the Inconel spacers.

In addition to the neutron-induced activities calculated here, experience
at Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc., indicates that about 0.1% of the plutonium
in the fuel can be associated with the cladding, presumably due to diffu-

sion while in the reactor.

3.3.2 Atomics International Reference Oxide LMFBR

 

In all of the calculations for the AI Reference Oxide IMFBR given
below, we have assumed that the core and blankets are mixed for reprocess-
ing in the same proportions as they are discharged from the reactor;
consequently, the calculations are based on one metric ton of uranium-
plus-plutonium charged to the reactor in the mixed core and blankets.
Reprocessing is assumed to begin 30 days after the fuel is discharged

from the reactor,

Fission Products. - Tables 3.31 through 3.36 present the calculated

masses, radioactivity, and thermal power of significant fission products
in the spent fuel and in the waste that is generated during the processing
of the latter. Tables 3.31, 3.33, and 3.35 give the weight, radioactivity,

and thermal power, respectively, for individual isotopes; the same data,
summed for each fission-product element, are given in Tables 3.32, 3.3L,

and 3.36 respectively.

Actinides. - Tables 3.37 through 3.L2 present the calculated masses,
radioactivity, and thermal power of important actinides in the fuel, com-
piled for each isotope and summed for each element; Tables 3.L2 through
3.18 present comparable data for the waste. In making the calculations
for the waste, we assumed that reprocessing occurs 30 days after the fuel
is discharged from the reactor and that 0.5% of the uranium and 0.5% of

the plutonium in the spent fuel appear in the waste,

Cladding. - Tables 3.49 through 3.5L present the calculated masses,
radioactivity, and thermal power of neutron-induced activation products
of the oxygen, stainless steel, and sodium in the cladding of the mixed
core and blankets. These data include only the cladding in the zones
exposed to neutrons, and assume a 0,00l-in,-thick layer of sodium at the
fuel-cladding interface. In addition to the neutron-induced isotopes
calculated here, ORNL hot-cell experience indicates that about 0.03% of
the plutonium in the core and blankets may be associated with the

cladding. |

3.4. Shipments of Spent Fuel

Spent nuclear fuel will continue to be shipped, as at present, from
reactors to a processing plant in large shielded casks. Cask sizes will
tend to become larger to permit higher payload ratios and to minimize
the shipping cost. Sizes in the 100- to 120-ton range are anticipated.
Most shipments will be carried by rail; barges and trucks will be used
to a lesser extent. Although transportation by barge is economical,
water routes between reactor and processing plant sites are not always
available. Shipments by truck are relatively expensive because the cask

weight in this case is limited to about 30 tons.

The anticipated growth of the shipping industry from 1970 to 2020
is indicated in Table 3.55. The figures are based on Phase 3, Case 42

of the SATF study, which assumes an LWR-LMFBR nuclear economy, and are,

Anis is the average number of loaded casks that might be expected to be in transit on any given day of the year,

fa-¢
3-55

of course, very approximate, The number of casks shipped annually was
calculated on the basis of average loads of 3 and 1.2 metric tons per
cask for LWR and LMFBR fuels respectively. The average load, in the
case of the LMFBR fuel, includes both core and blanket material. The
radial blanket material has a relatively low radioactivity level because
of its low exposure, and can be carried in loads of 3 or l metric tons
per cask. Loads of core--axial blanket fuel, however, are limited to
about 0.5 to 1 metric ton per cask because of the heat-removal problem

under accident conditions.

The number of loaded casks in transit at a given time depends on
the average length of the trip from the reactor to the reprocessing
plant. Table 3.55 shows estimates for average distances of 500 and 1000
miles, using one-way transit times of Li days and 7 days respectively.
The last three columns in the table are based on calculations using
current estimates of the growth pattern of the fuel reprocessing industry.
These estimates were made in connection with the work of the AEC Fuel
Recycle Task Force. The average shipping distance is based on an approxi-
mately uniform geographical distribution of plants, which is equivalent
to the assumption that suitable sites can be found in most areas of the
country. No attempt was made to weight the average by locating plants
close to large load centers, although this factor is always considered

when choosing actual plant locations.
3.5 Waste Management Projections

Estimates were made of waste management conditions anticipated for
the period 1970 to 2020. These estimates were based on the SATF Phase 3,
Case L2 projections of nuclear power growth in the United States (Fig.
3.1). In making these estimates, the LWR and the IMFBR were considered
separately, and the results were combined to obtain composites reflecting

the overall economy.

3.5.1 High-Level Wastes
Light-Water Reactors. — In the case of IWR's (Table 3.56), it is

33,000 Mwd/metric ton at an average specific power of 30 Mw/metric ton,
that reprocessing is done 90 days after the fuel has been discharged from
the reactor, and that there is a two-year delay between power generation
and waste generation, Assuming that the fuel is reprocessed by aqueous
methods and that the resulting waste is concentrated to 100 gal per
10,000 Mwd (thermal) burnup, the volume of waste generated annually will
increase from 17,000 gal in 1970 to 1.58 million gal in 2000, If the
waste is stored as a liquid, 39.2 million gal will accumulate by the year
2000, On the other hand, if it is converted to a solid form, waste volumes
may be reduced by a factor of about 13. The weight, radioactivity, and
heat-generation rate of all the fission products, and the accumulated
activities of each significant fission-product and actinide isotopes

(¢ > 10 years), is also shown in Table 3.56.

Fast Breeder Reactors. — For IMFBR's (Table 3.57), it is assumed that
the core is continuously irradiated at a specific power of 148 Mw/metric
ton to a burnup of 80,000 Mwd/metric ton, the axial blanket is irradiated
at li.6 Mw/metric ton to a burnup of 2500 Mwd/metric ton, and the radial
blanket is irradiated at 8.L Mw/metric ton to a burnup of 8100 Mwd/metric

 

ton. In addition, it is assumed that the fuel is reprocessed 30 days
after it has been discharged from the reactor, and that a two-year delay
occurs between power production and waste generation. With aqueous proc-
essing of the spent fuels, it is estimated that 20.9 million gal of liquid
waste, concentrated to a volume of 100 gal/10,000 Mwd (thermal) will
accumulate by the year 2000, If this waste is converted to solids,
209,000 £3 will accumulate by 2000. The levels of accumulated fission

products and actinides in these wastes are also given in Table 3.57.

Total Nuclear Economy. — The projected annual and accumulated volumes

 

of wastes for the total U. S. nuclear economy are given in Table 3.58.
Data for the principal radioisotopes in the wastes from spent LWR and
IMFBR fuel processing are also given. The total accumulated radioactivity
and thermal power of these radioisotopes are shown in Figs. 3.6 and 3.7
respectively. It should be pointed out that the total quantities of
actinides in the wastes would be less than is estimated here if there is

a significant contribution from thorium-fueled reactors in the nuclear

economy.

Annual Generation Rates. — The estimated annual generation of key

 

fission-product and actinide isotopes is presented in Table 3.59.

3.5.2 Management of Solidified High-Level Wastes

 

Estimates were made of the conditions that would exist if high-level
liquid wastes from fuel reprocessing were solidified and then shipped to
a salt mine repository for permanent storage. Table 3.60 presents the
volumes in storage, the required storage canal capacities, the number of
waste shipments, and the total and accumulated mine space needed if the
wastes were solidified immediately and shipped after 5 years of interim
storage on-site. Table 3.61 gives analogous data for the case of storing

the solidified wastes on-site for 10 years.

3.5.3 Intermediate- and Low-Level Liquid Wastes

 

The projected generation of so-called intermediate- and low-level
liquid wastes as the result of IWR and IMFBR fuel reprocessing 1s given
in Table 3.62, Volumes of these wastes were calculated on the basis that
about 200 gal and 10,000 gal, respectively, are produced per metric ton
of fuel reprocessed. This corresponds rougily to present practice; how-
ever, it can be anticipated that, in the future, intermediate-level wastes
will be combined with high-level wastes and converted to a solid form, In
addition to the volumes of low-level wastes shown in Table 3.62, about
3 million gal of low-level waste is generated annually at each reprocessing
plant from sources such as cell drainage, equipment decontamination flushes,

and laboratory sinks.
3.5.4 Solid Wastes

If mechanical decladding, as exemplified by a shear-leach head-end
step, is used in reprocessing, the cladding hulls and associated fuel-
assembly hardware containing neutron-induced radioisotopes (as well as
some of the actinides) will constitute an important source of solid waste.
Calculated levels of these isotopes for Zircaloy cladding and for stain-
less steel cladding are given in Tables 3.25-3.30 and Tables 3.49-3.5L
respectively. Annual and accumulated volumes of cladding wastes, assuming

compaction to 70% of their theoretical densities, are given in Table 3.63.

ly. TECHNICAL CONSIDERATIONS

Li.T Design of Fuel Reprocessing Plants

Fuel reprocessing plants are characterized by their complexity.
Typically, a fuel recovery process entails shearing the fuel (to rupture
the corrosion-resistant sheath and expose the fuel), dissolution of the
fuel in nitric acid, separation and purification of the uranium and plu-
tonium by solvent extraction and ion exchange, and conversion of the
product nitrates to oxides suitable for refabrication into fuel elements.
In addition to the primary process, there are many auxiliary operations:
treatment of the solvent to provide for its reuse, recovery of nitric
acid from the aqueous streams, management of the gaseous, liquid, and
solid waste effluents, and the specialized techniques and equipment re-

quired for process control and personnel protection.

The spent fuel is transported from the reactor to the reprocessing
plant in heavy, shielded casks. The cask is unloaded in a water-filled
pool, and the fuel is stored under water, which serves both as a trans-
parent radiation shield and as a coolant. The fuel elements to be proc-
essed are transferred to a head-end cell and sheared into 2-in. lengths
to expose the inner core, which is then leached with nitric acid in batch
dissolving tanks. The leached hulls constitute a solid waste that is
ultimately disposed of by land burial, The nitric acid solution of the
fuel, containing the uranium, plutonium, and nearly all of the fission

products, is the feed solution for the solvent extraction process.

Solvent extraction processes exploit the wide difference in concen-
tration distribution between two immiscible phases — the organic and the
aqueous. Nearly all major fuel reprocessing facilities employ some form
of the Purex process, which makes use of the organic complexing compound,
tributyl phosphate (TBP), in an inert hydrocarbon diluent. When this
organic mixture is brought into countercurrent contact with the aqueous
feed solution, the TBP extracts both the uranium and the plutonium into
the organic phase, leaving the fission and corrosion products behind in

the aqueous phase.
L-2

The TBP-organic solution of uranium and plutonium is stripped or
back-extracted with dilute nitric acid. The back-extraction of plutonium
can be vastly enhanced if the plutonium is reduced to the trivalent form,
usually with ferrous sulfamate; this makes it possible to back-extract
selectively first the plutonium and then the uranium. The two aqueous
solutions are usually further purified by a second extraction cycle or by

ion exchange.

The ferrous sulfamate that is used for reducing plutonium is, itself,
oxidized to ferric sulfate in the reduction process, and thus contributes
to the waste and interferes in the chemistry of subsequent plutonium
purification steps. Uranium in the tetravalent state has been successfully
used by the Europeans for this purpose; also, plutonium reduction can be
effected with hydrogen. Neither of these reductants contributes spurious

chemicals to the process.

The uranium and plutonium may be precipitated from dilute nitric acid
solution with oxalic acid. These oxalate precipitates are then removed by
filtration, and the filter cakes are thermally decomposed to produce ura-
nium and plutonium oxides. The oxides are sintered and ground, or extruded

into pellets for fabrication into new fuel elements.

3

In the recently developed sol-gel process,” the nitric acid is

removed from the aqueous solutions of plutonium or uranium by extracting
the acid with an amine solvent. As the acid extraction proceeds, a

stable, colloidally dispersed suspension of uranium oxide is formed.

This is a "sol," which can be handled like a true solution. Progressive
removal of water by evaporation or by extraction with a hygroscopic solvent
converts the sol to a plastic gel. The sol can be formed into gel micro-
spheres of controlled size by adding the sol dropwise into a stream of the
hygroscopic solvent. When fired to about 1200°C, the gel attains a density
near the theoretical density and is suitable for fabrication into reactor
elements, Sols of plutonium and uranium can be combined and gelled to form
"mixed" oxide microspheres in which the two elements are homogeneously

dispersed.

Radioactive gaseous wastes from these operations are treated chemi-

cally, as well as by filtration, sorption, and scrubbing in order to reduce
L-3

their radioisotope content to levels that can be discharged to the atmo-
sphere. The aqueous radioactive wastes that contain essentially all the
fission products are generally concentrated by evaporation and stored on
an interim basis in underground tanks. The evaporator overheads are
sufficiently decontaminated of radioisotopes to permit their discharge

to the environment under existing regulations.

Li.1.1 Preventive Measures and Containment Criteria

 

Criticality. — Criticality is normally prevented by a combination
of the following: limiting the concentration or quantity of material
"in-process" by administrative means; imposing dimensional limitations
on the process equipment; and adding parasitic neutron absorbers, either
soluble or fixed to the process tanks. (The latter are usually in the

form of raschig rings or parallel spaced plates.)

Administrative control is usually arranged so that the positive,
simultaneous action of two responsible operators is required to add criti-
cal material to an "in-plant" inventory and to transfer material within
the plant. A visual display of the fissionable material inventory status
in each area is maintained, and transfer valves are kept locked with the
keys in the immediate control of supervision. "Double-batching" is thus
prevented, and the plant or discrete portion of the plant is made safe by

limiting its in-process inventory to less than the minimum critical quantity.

Neutron absorbers, such as boron and cadmium added directly to the
dissolver as soluble salts, are effective for criticality control in the

4

dissolution and feed adjustment steps. These absorbers remain with the
aqueous waste. Tanks of large volume packed with borosilicate-glass raschig
rings may be used for the storage of fissile product solutions. Parallel
plates of boronated stainless steel have been used in the bell-shaped end

sections of pulsed columns.

Radiation, — Airborne radioactivity in the cell ventilation system,

 

and in personnel operating areas, is usually detected by radiation-sensing
instruments focused upon a filter through which a constant volume of air

is drawn. Some designs use continuous filters and are set to alarm at
L-h

certain radiation levels; others employ a fixed filter but are set to
alarm at a given rate-of-rise of the filter activity. Radiation fields
in operating areas are monitored by ion chambers with level alarms. In
order to avoid the hazard of spurious alarms, signals from two out of
three instruments are required before an alarm sounds. The inadvertent
entry of personnel into shielded process areas having high radiation
fields is prevented by securely locking these areas, with access in the

immediate control of supervision or other properly designated authority.

Containment Systems. — Processing plants are designed to ensure con~
tainment of airborne radicactivity by providing increasing levels of
vacuum in three successive envelopes so that all air leakage flows from
areas of low to those of high contamination potential. The building forms
the outermost envelope, and it is operated at a pressure approximately
0.3 in. Hp0 lower than atmospheric pressure. This is a higher vacuum
than a 30-mph wind could be expected to produce on the lee side of a
rectangular building. All openings in the building communicate either
with uncontaminated personnel areas, or with two doors in series, only
one of which can be open at any time. The vestibule formed by the space

between the doors is maintained as an uncontaminated area.

The shielded process cells form the second envelope of containment
and are operated with a vacuum of about 0.7 in. H 0 with respect to the
building. The cell exhaust system has a rated capacity of approximately
0.1 cell volume per minute (to accommodate explosions or fires without
pressurizing the cell), and the cell in-leakage rate is limited to approxi-
mately 107% cell volume per minute at a 2-in. Hy0 differential pressure.
Seals that are used to close cracks and crevices are designed to withstand
a minimum pressure of 10 in. H,0. The cell structure and its closures are
designed to withstand the pressure that could be generated by any credible
accident. Finally, the process equipment in the cell is operated at a

negative pressure, with respect to the cell, of about 10 in. HO.

Similarly, the direction of air flow through personnel areas in the
building is controlled by introducing a positive air flow into offices
that exhaust into corridors. From the corridors, the air flows succes-
sively toward operating areas, to limited access areas, and to hot labora-

tories, from which the air is exhausted through filters to the atmosphere.
4-5

Off-Gas Treatment. — Because of its higher radioactivity and chemi-
cal fumes content, the dissolver off-gas in most radiochemical plants is
treated, in turn, for nitric acid recovery, for iodine removal, and for
removal of residual acid fumes before being blended with the off-gas from
the vessels in the balance of the plant. The vessel off-gas is usually
scrubbed with caustic, dried, and filtered through one roughing and two
high-efficiency filters (HEPA, asbestos-glass fiber paper, 99.97% DOP

efficiency).

Iodine in most of its chemical states is removed from gas streams
by reaction with AgNO, impregnated on ceramic packing and by scrubbing
with Hg(NOz),-HNO5 or caustic solutions. However, organic iodides, par-
ticularly methyl iodide, can be removed most efficiently by catalytic
decomposition and sorption on silver, copper, or iodine-impregnated char-
coal. The efficiency of iodine removal units is sharply dependent upon
the concentration of the iodine, but 99.5% is a commonly quoted design
efficiency in cases where organic iodides are not removed.’ The efficiency

of charcoal impregnated with potassium iodide has been quoted at 99.99%.°

All off-gas streams from the plant are blended with the cell ventila-
tion streams and passed through a sand filter, a deep-bed fiber-glass
filter,’ or a bank of high-efficiency particulate air filters before

being monitored and discharged up a stack.

L;.1.2 Probable Trend of Plant Design

 

The principal concern in chemical plant design is safety, but economy
is a necessary parallel objective. The size of processing plants will in-
crease to take advantage of the lower unit processing costs associated with
higher plant capacity. Newer reactor fuels, the IMFBR fuels in particular,
will contain higher quantities of fissionable material. The high value of
this fissionable material will supply an economic inducement for minimizing
out-of-reactor processing time; thus fuel may be processed with as little
as 30 days preprocessing decay time. This short decay period, combined
with the increasing specific power and high burnups of future reactor de-

signs, will exaggerate many fuel processing problems; for example, there
will be more decay heat to dissipate, more radioactive off-gas to contend
4-6

with, more extensive disintegration of process reagents due to radiation,
and more severe plutonium criticality considerations. In addition, the
product-finishing end of the plant must be shielded owing to the presence

of certain isotopes in recycled plutonium and uranium (®3%Pu, <°%U).

The effect will be to direct plant design toward the use of high-
capacity, small-volume equipment; this is equivalent to minimizing the
plant inventory of both reactor fuel and process reagents. Continuous
equipment (as opposed to the batch operations characterizing the industry
in the past), and perhaps parallel lines to ensure operational continuity,
will be easier to maintain and cheaper to operate. Minimizing the in- ”

process inventory will serve both safety and economic considerations.

Transport. — Spent fuel shipping casks are expensive, but are most
economical in large sizes (about 120 tons). Casks will be designed with
relatively inexpensive removable canisters of such integrity as to ensure .
containment of the enclosed fuel throughout the postulated accidents that
might occur during shipment. The sealed containers will permit the cask
to be readily loaded and unloaded at the processing plant to minimize
cask turnaround time, and the canisters will provide safe, contained stor-

age while the fuel is awaiting processing.

Head-Fnd. — Present mechanical shears are designed to accept entire
subassemblies, denuded only of their hardware. If fuel elements could be
designed to be readily disassembled (preshipment disassembly may prove
desirable with fuel elements of high specific power in order to facilitate
heat dissipation during shipment), small high-capacity shears, operating
continuously at high output, would decrease the cost of the head-end =

equipment as well as facilitate its maintenance.

Outgassing of Volatile Fission Products. — One of the most difficult -

 

problems in reprocessing is that of containment of the volatile fission

13171

products, especially The volatile fission products (iodine, ruthe- »

nium, tellurium, cesium, tritium, krypton, and xenon) have been found to
volatilize from oxide fuel at moderate temperatures (450 to 750°¢).710
Outgassing of these elements is accelerated when the atmosphere contains

oxygen because the interstitially-bound gas in the fuel is released during
L-7

the resulting oxidation of UO, to Us0g. This preoxidation will relieve
the dissolution step of such treatment, thus reducing the consumption of
nitric acid and the formation of nitrogen oxides. If dilution by the
cell atmosphere is minimized, the volatile fission products can remain
concentrated, thereby making their capture and eventual encapsulation

much more efficient and reliable.

Although the noble gases are chemically inert, they can be concen-
trated by cryogenic distillation, absorption in fluorocarbons, © or

13

diffusion through permselective membrane. The concentrated noble gases
could then be compressed and stored, or immobilized with foam (plastic,

glass, or metal), ” assuming that this method can be shown to be practical.

Dissolution. — Simple batch dissolvers are frequently preferred for
small plants, particularly in instances where process control relies upon
chemical analyses. However, continuous leachers are presently under active
development in response to the obvious advantages of small physical size
and better criticality control. The use of oxygen sparging promises to
enhance the dissolution rate and to inhibit still further the evolution

of the nitrogen oxides that complicate vessel off-gas treatment.

Extraction. — Countercurrent solvent extraction has been carried out
in a variety of contactors: mixer-settlers, pulsed colums, and, more
recently, fast centrifugal contactors such as those in service at Savannah
River © or the stacked-clone contactors under development at ORNL.
Whereas the solvent has a total residence time in pulsed columns (and,
therefore, exposure to the fission product radiation associated with the
aqueous feed stream) on the order of 1 hr per extraction cycle, the cen-
trifugal contactors reduce this time to a few minutes. Not only is the
radiation damage to the solvent substantially reduced, but the volume of

organic in the system and the attendant fire hazards are also reduced.

Instrumentation and Control. — Continuous equipment, such as the

 

centrifugal solvent extraction contactors, have such a rapid response to

process variables that automatic controls are almost mandatory. Centrifu-
gal contactors are controlled by the position of the uranium concentration
gradient in the cascade, largely eliminating the accumulation of off-grade

material resulting from operator error.
L-8

Cell and Vessel Off-Gas. — The cell-ventilation and vessel off-gas

 

systems are primary sources of routine and accidental releases of radio-
activity. The recycle of gas from both systems is feasible and will
minimize the volume of off-gas needing routine treatment. Recycle will *
probably be economical, and the use of an inert cell atmosphere may become
practical. This would practically eliminate the possibility of solvent

fires in process cells,

Liquid and Solid Wastes. — It can be anticipated that all radioactive

 

liquid wastes from fuel reprocessing will be evaporated and blended to
yield only two streams: a high-level waste consisting of a highly concen-
trated solution of fission products and actinides, and a low-level aqueous
waste that has been sufficiently decontaminated of radioisotopes to permit
it to be either discharged to the environment or recycled to the process.
The conventional practice of accumulating aqueous solutions of fission
products in underground storage tanks will probably be curtailed because
of the difficulty in providing safe containment of the more concentrated
solutions derived from reprocessing highly exposed power-reactor fuels.
Adequately engineered storage systems may be so complex and expensive, as
compared with the cost of early solidification of the wastes, that liquid
storage systems will be limited in capacity merely to those surge volumes
needed for plant flexibility. Under these circumstances, liquid waste
inventories in storage would represent, at most, only a few weeks (or

months) of plant operations.

,.1.3 Plant Decommissioning Considerations

 

With the exception of the studies of land reclamation costs at AEC
production sites, there has been no known, careful consideration given to
the eventual decommissioning of fuel-reprocessing plants. In the absence
of a formal review, only the following general comments on this subject

are offered.

The problem may be considered in two parts: one related to the plant
process structures, and the other to the surrounding land, including that
devoted to waste tank farms, solid waste burial grounds, and low-level

liquid waste disposal. With respect to the plant buildings, the question
L-9

might be raised as to the need, in an expanding nuclear power economy,
for them to be decommissioned in a manner that would return them to un-
restricted use. Experience within the AEC has demonstrated that build-
ings housing fuel reprocessing and other types of radiochemical facilities
can be decontaminated to levels that permit routine access by personnel
and conversion of the facilities to other nuclear-related uses. One of
the best documented instances of such a decontamination operation is that
which followed an accidental plutonium release in an ORNL fuel reprocess-
ing pilot plant. 0 The facilities in which this release occurred had
been used to develop and demonstrate processes for recovering irradiated
reactor fuels since 194L. Following this incident, they were decontami-
nated to levels well below those presently required by the AEC in termi-
nating licenses for all materials licensees. Furthermore, there is

retired from nuclear service. In most instances, the uncontaminated areas
were converted to non-nuclear uses, while the radioactive areas and major
equipment were confined within biological shielding and sealed to prevent
access by the public. In the case of Hallam, the reactor-complex building
was demolished and removed from the site. The costs that have been re-
ported for operations of this kind cannot be considered to be exhorbitant;
yet it seems reasonable to expect that they might have been even less if
the facilities had been designed and constructed with the need for eventual

decontamination and decommissioning in mind.

Regulations have already been established that effectively limit the
disposal of radioactive materials on other than federal- or state-owned
land to very small (i.e., virtually negligible) quantities. Assuming
that this very prudent policy will not be relaxed to any significant ex-
tent, and considering the prohibitive costs of reclaiming substantial
areas of contaminated ground, it is obvious that the risks of contaminating
land must be minimized. This entails interim storage of all solid radio-
active wastes in concrete or other impervious enclosures from which they
can be retrieved. Similarly, all exterior piping and vessels containing

radioactive solutions, including liquid waste storage tanks, must be
4-10

designed to meet the same containment criteria as are specified for the

processing areas.

L.1.4 Design Criteria for Resistance to Farthquakes and Tornadoes

 

The design analysis made for the Midwest Fuel Recovery Plant™ (MFRP)
tends to demonstrate that fuel reprocessing plants can be made resistant

to the damaging effects of earthquakes and tornadoes.

One of the bases for MFRP design is that maximum earthquake and tor-
nado conditions shall not impair the ability to shut down the plant safely
and to maintain safe shutdown conditions. All potentially mobile radio-
active process streams are confined to the Main Process Building. Proc-
ess design is such that those operations which provide potential sources
of mobile radioactivity can be suspended on short notice. Control under
abnormal or emergency conditions is based on: prompt shutdown of process -
operations; maintenance of the integrity of confinement provisions, in-
cluding systems for off-gas control; and assurance that radioactive decay

heating does not lead to conditions of potential mobility.

On these bases, facilities critical to plant safety under emergency ;
conditions are: the shielded cell (canyon) area, which provides confine-
ment for major process systems; radioactive material storage areas, in-
cluding the Fuel Storage Basin, Waste Vaults, and facilities for on-site
retention of Pu and Np product prior to shipment, and sand filter and

associated off-gas control and handling equipment.

Seismic design criteria for the MFRP plant are compared with those of
three operating power reactors in Table L.1. The MFRP plant is located in
a zone of low seismic activity. All foundations extend to bedrock, which
is either shale or limestone. The design earthquake forces, for which no "
damage to critical structures and components shall occur, are those associ-
ated with a ground acceleration of 0.1 g. Maximum earthquake ground accel- -

eration, for which there shall be no loss of safe shutdown capability, is

0.2 g. The response spectra for the Design Earthquake are shown in
Fig. L;.1. Response spectra for the maximum condition have twice the

spectral amplitude shown in the figure.

MFRP plant structures aredesigned to withstand sustained wind veloci-
ties of 110 mph without impairment of any safety-related function. In
addition, critical structures are designed to withstand the effects of
short-term wind velocities of 300 mph without loss of shutdown and inven-

tory control capability.

Seismic design of critical structures utilizes the shears, mounts,
and displacements obtained from the preliminary analysis of their response
to the specified ground accelerations under anticipated plant operating
conditions. Recommendations set forth in the Uniform Building Code may
be followed by using horizontal static forces that are equivalent in their
design effect to the dynamic loads, and by taking into account the inter-
action of adjacent structures. Finally, to verify seismic design adequacy,
structures thus designed may be subjected to additional dynamic analysis
by the methods of modal analysis now being applied to critical power-reactor

facilities.

In the seismic design of critical mechanical equipment, vessels and
piping procedures developed for critical power-reactor system design may
be utilized. This requires determination of the natural periods of vibra-
tion of the equipment; these periods are classified as rigid, resonant, or
flexible, depending on whether the ratio of the fundamental frequency of
the equipment to that of the structure is greater than (or the fundamental
frequency of the equipment is greater than 20 cps), between 0.5 and 2.0,
or less than 0.5 respectively. At MFRP, rigid equipment is designed to
resist the spectral accelerations determined from the response spectra.
Items falling in the resonant category will, if possible, be modified by
design to avoid this classification. In cases where this is not feasible,
the design of such equipment will take into account the interaction be-
tween the item and its supporting structure by utilizing appropriate ana-
lytical procedures (e.g., response determined from time-history acceleration

input.)

In responding elastically with small damping, structures dissipate
only a minor portion of the input energy; the remainder goes into strain
energy and kinetic energy. Damping is a type of deflection-energy hystere-
sis with internal vibration that converts input energy into heat. Damping
factors allow estimates of values of elastic energy absorption under exci-
tation and are expressed as percentages of "critical" damping. Table [;.2
gives examples of assumed damping factors used for the design of three

operating power reactor plants and the MFRP plant.

If the energy input under excitation exceeds the elastic energy stor-
age capacity of the structure, the response must become inelastic, and the
excess energy must be dissipated through yield of the structure. In turn,
the elements that are most rigid in the direction of distortion will yield.
One characteristic that an earthquake-surviving structure must have is
toughness, for, in many places, brittle failures cannot be tolerated. In
other, less-vital parts of the plant, the design for inelastic response
(based on the energy absorption capacity) can lead to an important savings

in materials.

L.2 Waste Management Technology: General

Radioactive wastes — solids, liquids, and gases — are produced at all
nuclear industrial and research establishments. These waste materials will
vary in chemical composition, volume, and radioactivity level, depending
on the operations involved in their production. Normally, the sources of
© principal concern are the plants in which irradiated reactor fuels are re-
processed and, to a very much lesser extent, the reactor power stations;
in fact, the real focal point of the waste management problem rests at the
fuel-reprocessing plants and waste-disposal facilities because, at any given
time, most of the total inventory of long-lived, biologically hazardous

fission product will be found here.

The management of these waste materials currently is governed by the
application of three widely accepted principles: (1) "dilute and disperse"
the low-level liquid and gaseous wastes; (2) "delay and decay" the inter-

mediate- and high-level liquid and gaseous wastes, particularly those waste

streams that contain short-lived radionuclides; and (3) "concentrate and
contain" the intermediate- and high-level solid, liquid, and gaseous
wastes. Since it is not always a simple matter to select one principle

in preference to the other two, some combination of the three is often
followed; of course, the nature and the volume of the waste, the limita-
tions of the site for safe disposal, the possible radiation risk to nearby
populations stemming from releases to the environment, and the cost must

be taken into account.

L.2.1 Applications of the Dilution-Dispersion Principle

 

The application of this principle requires an understanding of the
behavior of radioactive materials in the environment and of the pathways
by which the released radionuclides, particularly those that are considered
to be critical, may later lead to the exposure of man. There 1s a large
body of knowledge available for use in the applications of this principle,
particularly in the fields of meteorology, geology, geography, hydrology,
hydrography, oceanography, ecology, soil science, and environmental engi-
neering. Also, the experience with the disposal of gaseous effluents into
the atmosphere, of liquid wastes into streams and oceans, of solid wastes
at sea and on land, and of liquid wastes into the ground should prove in-
valuable. Applications of this principle have been made cautiously, and
wisely so, thus ensuring that the releases are minimal and well within

what is judged to be the local environment's capacity to receive them.

4.2.2 Applications of the Delay-Decay Principle

 

This principle is concerned with techniques dealing with the handling,
storage, and disposal of intermediate- and high-level liquid and gaseous
wastes — in some circumstances, even with the methods used to handle low-
level wastes. The intent is to ease the problems of subsequent handling
or to lessen the risk of releases to the environment, taking advantage of
the passage of time and the decay of some of the radionuclides (particularly
those having short half-lives). Of course, if waste is held in storage in
a liquid form, the greater risk involved might, in some circumstances,

dictate the need for early conversion to solids.
L-17

,.2.3 Applications of the Concentration-Containment Principle

 

This principle is invoked in techniques dealing with: air and gas
cleaning; treatment of liquid wastes by scavenging-precipitation, ion
exchange, and evaporation; treatment of solid wastes by incineration,
baling, and packaging; treatment of solid and liquid wastes by insolubi-
lization in asphalt; conversion of high-level liquid wastes to insoluble
solids by high-temperature calcination or incorporation in glass; tank
storage of intermediate- and high-level liquid wastes; storage of solid
wastes in vaults or caverns; and disposal of liquid and solid wastes in

deep geological formations.

,.2. Applications of ICRP Recommendations to Waste Releases

 

The policy of the nuclear industry has always been to try to keep
radiation exposures of the general population within the dose levels set
by the ICRP and various other national bodies. Indeed, its aim has been
to reduce the potential exposures below these levels, having regard for
what is reasonable and economical in the particular circumstances. Thus,
more restrictive limitations are sometimes applied than those considered
adequate by the ICRP.

In preoperational surveys or investigations in the initial phases of
operation, crude estimates of permissible release rates are calculated in
relation to appropriate dose limits for members of the public. The calcu-
lations are based on information relative to (1) the properties of the
waste, (2) the physical and biological characteristics of the site and
surrounding areas, and (3) the activities and habits of the nearby popula-
tions. Because of imprecisions in much of the information, additional
safety factors are often applied to arrive at working standards (usually
derived concentration limits) that are applicable to environmental media
and/or foodstuffs. As the operations proceed and the results of environ-
mental monitoring become available, the relationships between discharge
rates and working standards are brought into clearer focus and the permissi-
ble discharge rates and/or derived concentration limits are revised as

required.
4-18

},.2.5 Assessment of Current Waste Disposal Practices

 

Ultimately, the effectiveness of waste-disposal operations in the
nuclear industry must be evaluated in terms of doses or dose commitments
to members of the public as a result of these operations. The effects
that such operations may have on the physical and biological environment
must also be taken into account. Such an evaluation is almost impossible
to make at the present time. To date, the ecological effects of waste
releases have not received much attention because the releases have been
minimal and limited to a few localities. However, these effects may

require more attention by ecologists in the future.

A great deal of attention has been given to the dispersal of wastes
from the nuclear industry in the past 10 to 15 years. The primary objec-
tive has been to obtain positive assurance that the resulting radiation
exposures of members of the public have not exceeded the recommended popu-

lation dose limits.

4.2.6 Definitions of Terms

 

Wastes are usually classified as high-, intermediate-, or low-level,
depending on the concentrations and the toxicities of the radioactive
constituents present. However, there are no generally accepted quantita-
tive definitions of these categories, possibly because of the many compli-
cated, and sometimes unknown, factors that must be taken into account to
satisfy a rigorous definition. Each installation usually classifies its
effluents on the basis of its own requirements for handling, treatment,
and release, although the classification is generally related, at least
qualitatively, to the maximum permissible concentrations in air (MPC, )
and water (MpC_) recommended by the International Commission on Radiological
Protection (cre) 2° In this report, unless otherwise specified, low-level
wastes are defined as wastes that contain radionuclides at concentrations
from 10 to 10 times their MPC for the general population; intermediate-
level wastes are defined as wastes that contain nuclides from 10 to 10°
times their MPC; and high-level wastes are defined as wastes that contain

radionuclides in excess of 10° times their MPC.
L-19

In practice, the words "storage" and "disposal" are often used inter-
changeably with respect to radioactive waste management. In this report,
the word "storage" means emplacement of materials with the intent and in
such a manner that the materials can be retrieved later. "Disposal! means
emplacement of materials in a manner or location that, for all practical

purposes, makes them irretrievable.

;.3 Waste Management Technology: High-Level Wastes

The high-level wastes obtained from decladding the fuel and from the
first-cycle solvent extraction are usually so different with regard to
physical, chemical, and radiochemical characteristics that they are handled
separately. Fuels are clad in alloys of Al, Mg, Be, Zr, and stainless
steel, all of which become radioactive by virtue of neutron activation of
the primary constituents or of impurities. From the standpoint of waste
disposal, the most significant of these isotopes are %87%9Co, 5°Fe, 5*Mn,
and %°7®2Ni in stainless steel, ®5Zr-Nb and *2°Sb in Zircaloy, and =€Al
in aluminum. In the United States, aluminum cladding from natural-uranium
metal fuels is removed by dissolution in NaOH-NaNO, solutions, whereas
European practice has been to remove the cladding by mechanical means.

In either case, the resulting wastes require long-term containment. Alumi-
num cladding solutions are stored in underground carbon steel tanks.’ 72°
In the United Kingdom, metallic cladding waste is stored in special concrete

23

buildings, ~ whereas, in France, it is compressed and stored in baskets

under water.

Processes have been developed for the dissolution of Zircaloy in
NH, NO -NH,F solutions and for the dissolution of stainless steel in H,S0,
solutions. Hot-cell studies of these processes have shown that the cladding
wastes contain about 0.1% of the total fission products and other constitu-
ents of the fuel,”

present in the cladding wastes from oxide fuels. These wastes are very

as much as 90% of the fission product *7Cs may also be

large in volume, averaging 1500 to 2000 gal per metric ton of fuel proc-
essed. They are quite corrosive to ordinary materials of construction and,
on neutralization, form bulky sludges and precipitates that make handling
difficult. Because of these factors, mechanical methods for removing the
claddings appear especially attractive from the standpoint of waste manage-

ment.
4-20

The first-cycle raffinates contain greater than 99.9% of the non-
volatile fission products originally present in the fuel; as a consequence,
they are the wastes that represent the greatest potential hazard. The
most prevalent waste of this type arises from processing natural or slightly
enriched uranium fuels, and can be a relatively pure solution of fission
products in dilute nitric acid. The operating practices at some plants
are such, however, that additional inert constituents, such as iron, sul-
fate, aluminum, phosphate, mercury, and silica, may also be present.
Raffinates obtained from processing other types of fuels (e.g., alloys of
enriched uranium with stainless steels, zirconium, molybdenum, and alumi-
num) contain substantial concentrations of the alloying materials. If
these raffinates are neutralized, many of the alloying constituents and
fission products that are present form precipitates. As much as 80% of
the decay heat may be associated with the solids under such conditions,

thus complicating the problems of heat removal and waste transport.

Fission products are present in typical first-cycle raffinates in

l

concentrations from 107 to 10'0 greater than their MPC values; this indi-
cates that a high degree of separation would be required before the water
and other inert constituents of the waste could be safely released to the
environment. A total of about 9 x 10” wo (5 cubic miles) of water would
be required to dilute to MPC all the fission products present in the
waste obtained from processing 1 metric ton of fuel that had been irradi-
ated to 10,000 Mwd (thermal). From 1000 to 1500 years would be required
for the longest-lived nuclides, °°Sr and *®%Sm, to reach MPC through
natural decay. Furthermore, in addition to fission products, these wastes
contain variable quantities of actinides, notably isotopes of Pu, Am, and
Cm, with half-lives and biological toxicities that impose additional re-
strictions. Clearly, fission-product separation, dilution, or decay alone
does not offer a feasible method of managing these wastes; however, all of
these methods may be used singly or in combination as important steps in

achieving that end.

4.3.1 Liquid Wastes

Interim Liquid Storage. — Currently, the first-cycle raffinates are

 

reduced in volume, by evaporation, for more economic storage in tanks.
Lh-21

During the evaporation step, the volatility of nitric acid may be enhanced
by steam stripping, and part of the acid may be decomposed by reaction with

27

formaldehyde? or sugar. In the United Kingdom, the evaporation is car-

28

ried out under a vacuum corresponding to a pressure of 70 mm Hg.

At AEC production sites, the volumes of concentrated raffinates range
from 1j0 to several hundred gal per metric ton of fuel processed; and ac-
tivity levels may be as high as several thousand curies per gallon, result-
ing in heat generation rates of 20 to 30 Btu hr™* gal-!. In both the United
Kingdom and France, great care is taken during processing to keep the first-
cycle wastes free of inert salts; consequently, volume reductions to 10 to
15 gal per metric ton of fuel (and proportionately higher volumetric heat

generation rates) are routinely achieved.

The wastes are stored as acid solutions in stainless steel tanks, or
they are neutralized and stored in carbon-steel tanks. In the United
States, these tanks, which range in capacity from 0.33 to 1.3 million gal,

are encased in concrete and buried underground.’ #27230

Decay heat is
removed during storage either by allowing the neutralized wastes to self-
heat, condensing the vapors, and returning the condensate to the tanks, or
by use of water-cooling coils submerged in the waste. The smaller volumes
of more-concentrated fission product solutions in Europe are stored at
environmental temperatures in stainless steel tanks of 15,000- to 20,000-
gal capacity. These tanks are equipped with water-cooling coils, and are, .
20,2

housed in concrete vaults that are enclosed in industrial-type buildings.

The tanks are equipped with devices for measuring temperatures and
liquid levels, detecting leaks, and agitating the contents; they are also
equipped with emergency facilities to maintain cooling and other essential
services. Costs are dependent on tank size, materials of construction, and
the degree of cooling and secondary containment required. In the United
States, capital costs range from about $0.50 per gallon of storage capacity
for 1.3 x 10%-gal carbon-steel tanks without cooling facilities to $5.40
per gallon for 300,000-gal stainless steel tanks equipped with cooling
coils.

The experience with tank storage over the past 20 years has not been

uniformly good. A total of more than 80 million gal of waste is currently
L-22

being stored in about 200 underground tanks in the United States. Fifteen
tank failures, all in carbon-steel systems,” have been reported. Eleven
of these failures occurred at Hanford, where it is estimated that 140,000
curies of *27Cs (and relatively minor amounts of ®°Sr and *°°Pu were re-
leased to the ground.”

clides were retained by the soil within 10 to 15 ft below the tanks. Four

Subsequent investigation showed that the radionu-

tank failures and one release during a waste transfer operation occurred
at the Savannah River Plant (SRP).32233 Tt is estimated that about 700 gal
of waste may have leaked from the tanks, although measurements of ground-
water contamination indicated that the release was much smaller than this.
A plugged waste tank inlet at SRP caused an overflow of waste concentrate
containing about 2000 curies of *°7Cs during a waste transfer. However,
no appreciable amount of radioactivity reached the river due to the sorp-
tion of cesium by sediments in the sewer and in the stream into which the
sewer discharged. Although the causes of the tank failures are believed
to be well understood and appropriate corrective measures are believed to
have been incorporated in the designs of new tanks now under construction,
a general lack of confidence in the long-term integrity of these systems
seems to be merited, particularly as they pertain to the Civilian Nuclear

Power Program.

An alternative to liquid storage may be immediate solidification of
the wastes and interim storage as stable, solid products encapsulated in
relatively small, portable containers of high integrity. If the wastes
are solidified, using a fluidiged-bed calciner, it may be more economical
to store the granular solids on an interim basis in vented, air-cooled
bins (similar to those at ICPP) before encapsulation and shipment to perma-

3L

nent storage. However, it 1s possible that the practical and economic
advantages to be gained by allowing many fission products with short and
intermediate half-lives to decay prior to additional waste processing will

make interim liquid storage for at least a few years a virtual necessity.

No leaks have been detected in the stainless steel tanks at the Idaho
Chemical Processing Plant (ICPP) during the 16 years that some of them
have been in service.
L-23

If so, the problems of heat removal, the requirement that the waste be
maintained in a condition amenable to rapid, efficient transfer, and the
economics of future solidification would dictate that the fission prod-
ucts be stored as relatively pure, acid solutions under non-boiling con-

ditions. This statement is based on the considerations discussed below.

Heat Generation Rates. — Power-reactor wastes that are derived from

 

fuels of high nuclear burnup will contain much larger quantities of fis-
sion products than do current wastes. In designing tanks and cooling
systems to remove decay heat, consideration must be given to: (1) the

age and concentration of the fission products at the time they are to be
added to the tank, (2) the thermal characteristics of the waste, as deter-
mined largely by the physical states and concentrations of the inert
chemicals present, and (3) the rate at which the tank is to be filled.
There is little experience in storing power-reactor wastes, but a careful
review of Hanford and Savannah River operating experience with existing
tank farms indicates that, as acid solutions 120 to 150 days old, wastes
with concentrations of inert salts comparable to present Purex production
wastes could be stored at a volume of about 100 gal per 108 Mwd (thermal)
of fuel exposure. If these wastes are neutralized, considerations of heat
removal from the precipitated solids indicate that storage at about 600 gal

the radioactivity level of the acid wastes 150 days after removal of the

per 107 Mwd (thermal) of fuel exposure would be practical. On this basis,
fuel from the reactor is about 13,700 curies/gal, which is equivalent to
200 Btu hr~* gal™l; in the alkaline case, it is about 2300 curies/gal, or
30 Btu hr-* gal™%,

If a plant handled the fuel from an installed capacity of 23,500 Mw
(electrical) (an annual load of ~ 687 tons of 33,000 Mwd/ton fuel, decayed
150 days) for a period of 20 years, it would accumulate fission products
(in its waste storage system) having heat generation rates as shown in
Fig. L.2. If the wastes were stored as liquids, approximately 227,000 gal
of acid waste or 1,360,000 gal of alkaline waste would be accumulated
annually. Figure l,.2 shows example cases of tanks containing from about
100,000 to 900,000 gal of acid waste, or the proportionate amounts of

alkaline waste. Maximum heat-generation rates of 1.7 x 107, 2.8 x 107,

1.2 x 107, and 5.6 x 107 Btu/hr are obtained when tanks A through D,
respectively, are first filled. The rates then decrease with time and
reach a value of 10° Btu/hr after a decay period of 100 to 250 years.
This is about the rate of heat loss by natural conduction to the environ-

ment from each of these tanks.

Radiolytic Hydrogen Production. — The radiolysis of water or aqueous
solutions results in the production of hydrogen and oxygen. In the case
of nitrate solutions, the hydrogen yields, G(Hg), defined as the number
of molecules formed per 100 ev of absorbed energy, have been shown to be
dependent on the nitrate ion concentration. From the data of Mahlman,>”
it is estimated that G(Hg) for the acid wastes and the alkaline wastes
are 0.03 and 0.10 respectively. These values are equivalent to about
3 ft of Hy (STP) per 10° Btu of fission-product heat in acid waste, and
10 ft3/10° Btu in the alkaline case. If the waste is not stored under
self-boiling conditions, provisions must be made to sweep the hydrogen

from the vapor space above the waste and prevent its accumulation in the

tank.

Corrosion. — Although the general corrosion rate for carbon steel
that is used to store alkaline waste is only about 0.02 mil/year, some
pitting has been observed; >C also, stress corrosion which occurs at the
weld-affected areas, has indicated the need for heat treatment of the
tanks, in place, before use. >? Overall corrosion rates of types 30LL and
31,7 stainless steel during storage of acid wastes at about 140°F are a
few hundredths of a mil per month, with grain-boundary but no intergranular
attack. 23° However, the rate of corrosion of stainless steel by acid

39

wastes is accelerated to 30 to L5 mils/year at temperatures near boiling.

L.3.2 Solidification

The conversion of high-level liquid wastes to solids as a pretreatment
for disposal is being developed in laboratories of nearly all countries
with significant near-future nuclear energy. Solidification is the only
reasonably attainable technique for achieving a substantial increase in
the safety associated with the storing and disposal of the high-level waste

from the nuclear power industry. Other techniques, more exotic and perhaps
L-26

more positive (such as transporting wastes to other planets or to stars,
1
or '"meutralizing" the radioactivity by nuclear physics)™ are certainly

not attainable in the immediate future.

It is expected that, for any given storage environment, storage of
high-level wastes as solids will provide greater safety, by several orders
of magnitude, than storage as liquids. Increased safety is provided by

the solid form because this form is:
(1) immobile,
(2) less soluble in water,
(3) considerably smaller in volume, and
(LL) more rugged physically.

These advantages are significant and real for material that must be stored

for many years or transported over private property.

It must be recognized that solidification is only part of the total
disposal scheme. The other part is storage virtually forever” under
stable, controlled conditions. Although guidelines for such storage are
very important to the problem, they have not yet been established on a

national or world-wide basis.

A considerable amount of work has been conducted in the past 13 years,
and is in progress presently, for the development of solidification tech-
niques for high-level liquid wastes. Four processes for solidification of
high-level liquid wastes have been developed in the United States to the
point of radioactive demonstration on an engineering scale. These four
processes are pot calcination, spray solidification, phosphate glass

solidification, and fluidized-bed calcination.

Overall Status. — The four solidification processes (pot, spray, phos-

phate glass, and fluidized bed) developed to the point of radioactive

"Five to ten centuries are required for decay of radioactive fission
products. Storage periods of hundreds of thousands of years are
required for decay of the small amount of plutonium present as a
waste loss during reprocessing.

demonstration on an engineering scale in the United States are shown in
Fig. L.3. The pot, spray, and phosphate glass processes have been demon-
strated for the AEC on a full-level, engineering scale in the Waste Solidi-
fication Engineering Prototypes (WSEP) by Battelle-Northwest at Richland,
Washington, since November 1966, 12-bb This demonstration will be completed
in 1970. For the past seven years, the fluidized-bed process has been
demonstrated for the AEC in a large-capacity plant in the Waste Calcining
Facility (WCF) by Idaho Nuclear Corporation at Idaho Falls, Idaho, oper-

ating with aluminum and zirconium type wastes.

The pot, spray, and phosphate glass processes have been developed
and demonstrated at processing rates of 10 to 20 liters of liquid waste,
per hour, comparable to waste from processing about 1 metric ton of nuclear
fuel per day. The fluidized-bed process has been demonstrated at rates as
high as 300 liters/hr with wastes containing relatively low concentrations
of self-heat-generating constituents. Scale-up of all processes beyond
the equivalent of about 1 metric ton of fuel per day will require some
additional nonradioactive development unless the present units are paral-
leled. An overall summary of the status of development of these and sev-

eral other processes is given in Table }.3.

In each of the four processes, heat is applied to raise the temperature
of the waste to LOO to 1200°C. At these temperatures, essentially all the
volatile constituents (primarily water and nitrates) are driven off, leaving
a solid or a melt that will cool to a solid. The resulting solids are
relatively stable chemically, especially at temperatures lower than those

used during processing.

General Chemical Considerations for Waste Solidification. - Solvent
extraction using nitric acid or nitrate salts is the only production-scale
means currently being used for the first-stage removal of fission products
from the fissionable material in spent nuclear fuel. Consequently, all
high-level wastes are primarily aqueous solutions of inorganic nitrate
salts (which will decompose at temperatures below 500°C). Differences in
wastes occur mainly in the amounts and types of salts added to the solu-
tions during reprocessing of the spent reactor fuel, The amounts of these

artificially added chemicals can vary from being predominant to being mere

impurities when compared with the chemical fission product content of the
wastes. The variations usually have marked impact on the solidification

process conditions and on the nature of the final solidified waste.

All processes for solidifying high-level waste generate additional
waste streams that contain intermediate levels of radioactivity. These
are the vapor or condensate streams from the solidifier that have been
decontaminated by factors of 10 to 1000. From this point, decontamination
requirements of the effluents are comparable to those from the high-level
liquid waste handling system of the fuel reprocessing plant. Processing
of these effluent streams would logically and readily be done by recycle
routing to the existing high-level liquid waste concentration and proces-
sing equipment. Only a modest increase in capacity (on the order of 10%)
of the liquid waste processing capacity of the reprocessing plant would

be required.

The first part of Table lL.) describes five waste compositions that
bracket the ranges of nonfission product compositions of wastes expected
from fuel reprocessing by solvent extraction. All compositions are shown
at a volume of 378 liters per metric ton of uranium fuel (100 gal/metric
ton) to provide a common basis, although concentrations greater than about
L N in total metallic ions will generally result in excessive precipitation

which is unmanageable for extended storage, 20526,L0

The compositions shown
in Table l.lL assume that the fuel cladding is not dissolved with the fuel;
consequently, the fuel cladding constituents are not present in the high-

level waste.

Waste composition No. 1 is typified by a very high content of iron
and a low content of other constituents. This waste has been generated by
one reprocessor’ by dissolving an iron fuel container with the fuel.
Composition No. 2 is a moderately "dirty" waste from first-cycle waste
combined with second-cycle waste that contains sulfate (which comes from
a reductant in the uranium-plutonium partitioning step). Waste No. 3 is
the same as waste No. 2 except that it has been neutralized prior to stor-
age. Waste No. Lh is a "clean" waste, which would come from the first-
solvent extraction cycle if reasonable care is taken to maintain a flow-

sheet reasonably free of nonradioactive chemicals. This is expected to

be a fairly typical waste in the near future. Waste No. 5 is a waste
that is generated in a TBP-25 process in which aluminum nitrate is used

for the salting agent in the solvent extraction process.

Chemical adjustment of waste No. 3 is required before solidifica-
tion since direct calcination will form unstable, hygroscopic Na 0. Upon
acidification, the composition of this waste then approaches that of
waste No. 2. The TBP-25 process offers no known major advantages over the
Purex process for commercial plants; therefore, waste No. 5 is believed
to have only minor importance in the future. Consequently, wastes having
composition Nos. 1, 2, and lL bracket the range of expected high-level

liquid waste compositions.

The third part of Table L.l4 shows the amounts of fission product
elements resulting from fissioning in thermal reactors with moderate- and
high-exposure histories. The 20,000-Mwd/metric ton exposure is typical
of current reactors, and the L5,000 Mwd/metric ton exposure represents
probable maximum exposures in future thermal reactors. 8 It is obvious
that, unless intermediate-level wastes from fuel reprocessing are mixed
with the high-level wastes, the chemical content of fission produces will
be significant in essentially all fuel reprocessing schemes. In fact,
with moderate attempts to minimize the inert contaminants in the waste,
the chemical equivalents of fission products will exceed those of the non-
fission products, and the chemistry of the fission products will be the

controlling factor in the waste treatment steps.

Another point of interest is that the absolute minimum weight of
solidified waste (that of fission product oxides alone) is about 1.1 kg/
1000 Mwd thermal exposure. Contributions from inert chemicals in the
compositions shown in Table }.}j can increase that volume by a factor up
to about );. Additional chemical additives are often needed to perform
chemical functions during solidification. These additives are based on
the total composition of chemicals present, and can increase the waste

volumes by as much as a factor of 2,

Solidification processes that form melts require significant chemi-

cal modification of almost any waste composition. Compositions for waste
L-33

solidification generally require at least 70 mole % of inert chemicals
to incorporate the fission products into materials that are meltable at
reasonably low temperatures (i.e., at less than about 1000°C). (A more

typical value for inert chemical content in melts is 85%). Melts have

19-51
57

been developed in which the major melt-making fluxes are phosphates,

52-54 55,56 52,55,56

In most cases, workable chemical composition ranges have been defined.

borophosphates, silicates, borosilicates, and borates.
However, general correlations for chemical compositions are somewhat
difficult to define because of the complex interaction of all the consti-
tuents in the wastes. Therefore, each waste composition encountered
usually requires at least some laboratory investigation of melt-forming
composition. Similar studies are usually necessary to predict the occur-
rence of special problems, such as ruthenium or sulfate volatility, foam-

ing, stickiness, etc., for all solidification processes.

Three of the inert chemical constituents listed in Table L.h4 are
sufficiently troublesome during solidification to merit efforts to keep
them out of high-level wastes. These constituents are sulfate, fluoride,
and mercuric ions. Sulfate ion is generally unstable chemically at the
higher range of temperatures reached in solidification (700°C and higher)
and tends to volatilize. Retention of sulfate in the solidified waste at
temperatures above 700°C requires chemical additives (usually calcium);
for melts, it becomes very difficult above 950 to 1000°¢.49 The volatil-
ization of sulfate results in added corrosion problems in the off-gas
system recycle and in increased sulfate concentrations in the liquid waste
for cases of partial volatilization; in cases of complete volatilization,
another medium-to-high-level waste stream requiring special treatment and
disposal is produced. Sulfate also causes severe precipitation and resul-
tant solution handling problems from sodium — rare earth sulfates when the

58

latter are present at concentrations of approximately 0.5 M or greater.

Fluoride is retained with difficulty (by using calcium) during solidi-

59

fied waste processing up to temperatures of about 600°C,” and is nearly

0
impossible to retain significantly at higher temperatures.’ If it cannot
be retained, it must be disposed of by another means (e.g., via the plant

stack or discharge in a separate lower-level waste stream). A fluoride
4-34

content much greater than about 0.001 M will significantly increase corro-
sion of stainless steel and titanium (used generally in waste processing
systems), although this corrosion can be partly overcome by use of com-

plexing agents (aluminum, zirconium, etc.).

Mercury cannot be retained in solidified waste that is processed at
temperatures above L400 to 500°C. When volatilized, the mercury and its
oxides condense at temperatures of about 350°C and provide relatively
serious potential plugging problems. A means for pretreating the waste
for removal of mercury has been developed in the laboratory.’

Ruthenium is just as troublesome in waste solidification as it is
in fuel reprocessing. Its removal from the off-gas stream is more diffi-
cult than that of nonvolatile materials. One to eighty percent of the
ruthenium will usually oxidize and volatilize during solidification.
Additions of certain chemicals are sometimes required to minimize oxida-
tion to the volatile Ru0, form. Even then, volatilization of at least

1% is usually encountered.

Pot Calcination. — Pot calcination, which was developed at ORNL, is
a batch process that has been developed to a state of readiness for com-
mercial radioactive use. It is presently being demonstrated with full-
level radioactivity on a pilot-plant scale. Its advantages are that it
is a simple process and is adaptable to a wide variety of feed compositions.
Its disadvantages are: (1) a stainless steel pot is required, (2) the
amount of heat that can be incorporated into a pot is limited, (3) the
capacity of a system using this process must be increased by multiple-pot

lines, and (4) the solidified waste is more leachable than glassy solids.

Pot calcination is a batch process in which the principal processing
vessel, the pot, is also the final container for the solidified waste.
In pot calcination, liquid waste is added to a pot that is heated in a
multiple-zone heating and cooling furnace. The waste is sufficiently con-
centrated at a constant volume that scale (salt cake) forms on the walls
of the pot. As calcination continues, the scale grows in thickness and
reduces the capacity for heat transfer from the pot wall to the boiling
sludge; therefore, the feed rate must be reduced proportionately. When

the feed rate is reduced to an "unprofitable" rate (about 5 liters/hr),
L-35

the feed supply is shut off. At this point, the scale has grown inward
from the pot wall and upward from the bottom of the pot to fill the pot,
except for a thin-cone-shaped liquid-containing void in the upper 2 to
3 ft of the salt cake. Heating is then continued until the liquid is
boiled to dryness and all of the waste in the pot has been calcined and
has reached the temperature of 850 to 900°C. The pot is then cooled in

the furnace, removed, sealed, and sent to storage.

The product from pot calcination (i.e., the solidified waste) is a
mixture of the oxides (and sulfates, if sulfate is present in the waste)
of the metallic constituents in the original liquid waste. The product
is a porous, friable calcine with a low thermal conductivity and a rela-

tively high solubility in aqueous solutions.

The basic items of equipment required for pot calcination are: (1) a
multiple-zone furnace for heating and cooling the calcine, (2) a pot for
calcining the waste, and (3) an off-gas line from the pot to the first
process condenser which can be washed down continually. The successful
performance of pot calcination equipment fulfilling these requirements
has been demonstrated, using full-level wastes in the Waste Solidification

Engineering Prototypes.

Because the pots serve as the processing vessels, they are exposed
to severe corrosion conditions during clacination; therefore, they must
be made of corrosion-resistant material. Corrosion of type 30LL stainless
steel was found to be negligible during processing (< 0.0003 in./day).
The pots must be equipped with liquid-level and temperature-measurement
devices. Liquid level may be measured with a standard gas-purged dip tube
or with an internal temperature sensor located near the top of the pot.
In demonstration tests, temperature measurements were taken, with in-place
thermocouples, at the center line and at the pot walls in each zone.
Because of the significant cost of thermocouples, an incentive exists for
either reducing the required number of these devices or for making them

reusable.

Internal heat from the decay of radioactive constituents requires

slight modifications of operating techniques. When internal heat is
L-36

present, the pot wall must be cooled before the material at the center

of the pot has reached its final maximum temperature; if cooling is not
available, the center temperature will exceed that desired. (Higher
temperatures result in severe corrosion and potentially undesirable vola-
tility of some constituents.) Control of this temperature has been success-
fully demonstrated by using a simple three-step reduction of furnace tem-

peratures, based on pot wall and center temperatures,

The pot calcination cycle may be divided into three major periods:
(1) feeding and concentrating the waste at a constant feed rate, (2) pot
wall scaling and calcining, which cause a gradual reduction of feed rate,
and (3) calcining and cooling when the feed supply is turned off and the
calcine is heated to 850 to 900°C and then cooled in preparation for re-
moving the pot from the furnace. Typical time requirements for the steps
are summarized in Table L.5. Since the diameter of the pot has a rela-
tively small effect on the overall processing capacity, an increase in
capacity must be obtained by effecting changes in pot geometry (e.g., by
use of annular pots) or by multiple pot lines.

Longer pots provide a slight increase in capacity because there is no
marked increase in calcining and cooling times for such pots. Maximum
boilup rate is limited by entrainment in the upper part of the pot, or
by the cross sectional area of the pot. Some feeds may contain signifi-
cant amounts of foam-making constituents (e.g., dibutyl phosphate from
the reprocessing plant). If foaming is present, feed rates during the

initial boiling period must be reduced from those shown in Table 1.5.

During the pot calcination of Purex wastes, ruthenium is volatilized
to the extent of about 5% and 10 to 30% for low-sulfate wastes and high-
sulfate wastes respectively. Lower volatility can be effected by the
63

addition of chemical reductants, such as nitric oxide or phosphites.

When sulfate is present in the waste, less than 2% of it will be
volatilized from the calcine if the chemical composition of the feed is
adjusted in such a manner that the chemical equivalent of alkali or
alkaline-earth metallic ions is present. In practice, sodium and/or

calcium nitrates are usually used.

The volatility of cesium and rubidium, which are always present as
fission products, can be virtually eliminated by adding enough sulfate
or phosphate ions to the feed to be chemically equivalent to the total
amount of alkali metals present.

When the pot calciner is operated on a reasonably conservative basis,

entrainment from it corresponds to approximately 0.4% of the total feed 0?

Spray Solidification. — Spray solidification is a continuous proc-

 

ess that has been extensively developed and is approaching readiness for
commercial use. It is currently being demonstrated with full-level radio-
activity on a pilot-plant scale. The spray solidification process was
developed at Battelle-Northwest. Its advantages are: (1) it is a con-
tinuous process with low hold-up volumes, (2) it is adaptable to a mod-
erately wide variety of feed compositions, and (3) it produces a variety
of good-quality solids. Its disadvantages are: (1) it is a moderately
complicated system, (2) it requires good flow control of sometimes
difficult-to-handle feed solutions, (3) its performance requires high-
quality atomization, and (li) at present, it requires the use of a rela-

tively expensive platinum melter. Results obtained from current pilot
L-38

plant tests of melting the calcined powder in the receiver pot, rather
than using an expensive platinum melter, may eliminate one of the dis-

advantages.

In the spray calciner (see Fig. L.3), liquid waste (which contains
some or all of the melt-making additives) is fed through a pneumatic
atomizing nozzle into the top of a heated cylindrical tower. The atom-
ized waste is sequentially evaporated, dried, and calcined to a powder
as it falls into a continuous melter (below the calciner), where it is
melted at temperatures of 800 to 1200°C. Process gases from calcination
flow into the adjacent filter chamber, carrying much of the calcined
powder as dust. The dust collects on the porous metal filters as the
gas passes through. The dust deposits are periodically blown off the
filters by sudden pulses of high-pressure steam or air that is directed
backward through the filters by small nozzles. The dislodged dust falls
into the melter with the main stream of powder. The molten calcine flows
through an overflow weir or a freeze valve into the receiver-storage pot
below. After the pot is filled, it is cooled in the furnace, sealed, and

sent to storage.

The product from spray solidification is a monolithic solid that is
formed after the melt is cooled. The solid is a tough, microcrystalline,
rock-like material having a good thermal conductivity and a moderately
low solubility in aqueous solutions. (Glassy solids have also been pre-
pared in the spray solidifier, but primary emphasis has been on micro-

crystalline materials.)

The basic items of equipment required for spray solidification are:
(1) a pneumatic atomizing nozzle and a spray tower for atomizing and
drying-calcining the feed, (2) a multiple-zone furnace for heating the
spray tower, (3) an off-gas cleaning system near the spray tower to remove
the bulk of the entrained calcine dust from the off-gases, (li) a continuous
melter for melting the powdered calcine, (5) a furnace for heating the
melter, (6) a pot for receiving the molten waste, and (7) a multiple-zoned

"furnace" for cooling (and possibly heating) the receiver pot.

Ws
L-39

In the continuous melter, the small amounts of residual nitrate and
water present in the calcine are volatilized, and the calcine is melted.
To date, platinum is the only reliable metallic material of construction
that has been found to withstand the environment of corrosion and high
temperature. The capacity of a platinum melter that is 10 in. in diameter
and has a Tlj-in.-~high heated section is 1.7 liters of melt per hour. !
Platinum has been used extensively at temperatures up to 1250°C. A spe-
cial alloy of 50% chromium — 50% nickel is generally satisfactory at
temperatures up to 1000°C; also, steels with high chromium and nickel
contents, as well as some alloys with a high nickel content, are satis-
factory at temperatures up to 900°C. The discharge of melt from the
melter has been adequately demonstrated both on a continuous basis, using
overflow weirs, and batchwise, using straight-tube freeze valves in which
a plug of melt about 2 in. long is melted or frozen to provide on-off

flow control.

The pot for receiving the molten waste may be made of mild steel
if the pot is to be filled with melt by large, rapid, batchwise "dumps"
from the melter, or if the pot is to be filled with a melt having a low
melting point (less than about 700°C). Mild steel is acceptable since
the pots must be heated under most conditions only to the point where the
melt will slump; this ensures complete filling of the pots, without forma-
tion of stalagmites or voids. (Mild steel pots can acceptably resist
temperatures up to about 650°C for several-day periods.) Corrosion of mild
steel or stainless steel pots by phosphate melts at temperatures of about

700°C or lower is negligible ,tt-00

The spray solidifier concept requires that the sintering point of
the calcined feed in the spray tower be higher than the temperature of
the walls of the spray tower. Adherence to this limit will prevent gross
sticking of calcine to the tower walls. In addition, the melting point
of the final powder must be no more than about 900°C (see above). The
chemical composition of the feed is then adjusted to fit these limitations.
Some or all of the melt-making flux can be added, as a solid, directly to

the melter to further widen flowsheet and operational flexibility.
L-Lo

The capacity of a spray tower increases significantly with (1) wall
temperature, (2) degree of atomization, or spray drop size, (3) decreased
stickiness of the feed, and (Li) length and diameter of the tower. The
capacity increases by about 30% for each 100°C increase in wall tempera-
ture in the normal operating range of 500 to 750°C. Atomizing quality
can affect capacity by a factor of 2. The drying capacity during the
calcination of nonmelting calcines is about 30% less than that with water;
the capacity for the calcination of "melting" feeds is approximately a
factor of 2 lower than that for nonmelting calcines. The calcine capacity
increases approximately linearly with diameter up to about 2 ft and with
length up to about 10 ft. Scale-up factors beyond these size limits are
not yet well-defined. The typical capacity for a melting feed in a spray
calciner of the size used in Waste Solidification Engineering Prototypes

(13 in. in diameter by 6 ft long) is 20 liters of liquid waste per hour.

Most of the flowsheets used for spray solidification at Battelle-
Northwest produce alkali metal — phosphate solids. These are used pri-
marily because (1) they offer a relatively large latitude in chemical
composition, (2) they have generally low melting points (700 to 900°C),
(3) they produce melts with reasonably low viscosities (less than 50 poises)
at operating temperatures, and (Li) the chemically adjusted feed solutions
are easier to handle than those of other flowsheets and generally produce
homogenous melts. The primary disadvantage of phosphate melts is the
associated corrosion rate which is higher than that for other melts such
as silicates, borates, etc. With the typical phosphate melts, microcrys-
talline solids are formed in spray solidification by adding enough phos-
phate to approach the composition of orthophosphate melts (total normality
of cations/phosphorus = 2.5 to 3.0). Sufficient alkali metals are added
to reduce the melting point to 700-900°C. Although the flowsheets are not
always compatible with the spray solidifier, glassy solids are formed by
adding more phosphate to the range of metaphosphate of hypophosphate melts
(total normality of cations/phosphorus = 1.0 to 2.0).

Calcium is added in excess to melts containing sulfate; the calcium
combines chemically with the sulfate and retains it. In some cases, a

small amount of aluminum is added to increase the sintering temperature to
L-L1

achieve more efficient operation in the spray calciner. Then, enough
alkali-metal and phosphate ions are added to reduce the melting point to
about 700°C. Some of these ions are added, in the form of solids,
directly to the melter to permit operation of the spray calciner with a
melt of a chemical composition having a higher melting point than that
of the final melt. With the conditions used in the spray solidifier,
95% of the sulfate is retained in the final solid.

Up to 75% of the ruthenium can be volatilized from the spray calcina-
tion step (not during melting) with the phosphate flowsheets This
volatility can be reduced by eliminating the melt-making flux from the
feed and adding it to the melter, 6 or by reducing the oxidizing potential
in the calciner. The volatilities of cesium and rubidium have not been

significant in spray solidification flowsheets.

Phosphate Glass Solidification. — Phosphate glass solidification is

 

a continuous process that has been extensively developed at Brookhaven
National Laboratory (BNL) and is approaching readiness for commercial use.
It is being demonstrated with full-level radioactivity on a pilot-plant
scale. Its advantages are that it is a continuous process and it yields

a good-quality glass product. Its disadvantages are: (1) it is a moder-
ately complicated system, (2) it requires operation with slurries that

are difficult to handle, (3) it cannot retain sulfate in the final solid,
and (lj) at present, it requires the use of a relatively expensive platinum

melter.

In phosphate glass solidification, liquid waste that contains all of
the melt-making additives is first fed to the evaporator, where it is con-
centrated and denitrated, by factors of 2 to 10, to a thick, syrupy,
aqueous phosphate slurry. The slurry is fed to the continuous melter,
where final volatilization of the water, nitrates, and other volatile con-
stituents is accomplished; then the resulting material is heated to 1000
to 1200°C to form a molten glass. The molten glass flows through an over-
flow weir or a freeze valve into the receiver-storage pot below. After

the pot is filled, it is cooled in the furnace, sealed, and sent to storage.
L-he

The product from the phosphate glass process is a monolithic, moder-
ately brittle glass that is formed after the melt has cooled. This glass
has a fairly good thermal conductivity and a low solubility in aqueous

solutions.

The basic items of equipment required for phosphate glass solidifi-
cation are: (1) a continuous evaporator to concentrate the feed to a
syrupy consistency, (2) a means to provide controlled feeding of the
syrupy concentrate to the melter, (3) a continuous melter for final evapo-
ration and melting of the waste, (li) a furnace for heating the melter,

(5) a pot for receiving the molten waste, and (6) a multiple-zoned fur-
nace for heating and cooling the receiver pot. The last four needs are

essentially identical to those in the spray solidifier.

The requirements for the continuous melter are essentially the same
as those discussed previously for the spray solidifier., Exceptions are
that, in the phosphate glass melter, the net heat transfer requirements
are 50 to 100% higher (primarily because of the added evaporation load)
and the desired freeboard requirements above the melt level are somewhat

9

higher because of the foaming tendency in the melter. The capacity of
a platinum melter that is 10 in. in diameter and has a 1; in.-high heated
section is 1.2 liters of glass per hour, or about 3 liters of slurry feed

per hour.
corrosive, and must be routed through platinum piping until the tem-

perature is reduced to about 120°C.

The pot for receiving the molten glass is similar to that for the
spray solidification process. The low slump point (600 to 700°C) and the
continuous viscosity-temperature relationship for the phosphate glasses
permit the filling of pots by the slow continuous dripping of the melt
while the pot is heated only to 500-600°C. | Mild steel can tolerate

these conditions during the filling of one pot.

The phosphate glass process can readily solidify high-level waste
solutions that contain sulfate, but the sulfate is completely volatilized
from the melter. In this case, the vapor stream from the melter forms a

separate stream of intermediate-level waste. This stream contains all the

Fe
L-L3

sulfate, and normally about 30% of the nitrate, 5 to 10% of the radio-
ruthenium, and less than 0.5% of all other radioactivity that was origi-

nally in the liquid waste stream. 0

Because the sulfate cannot be reused,
it requires special treatment for final disposal. When sulfate is not
present, the condensate from the melter contains only nitrates and can be
combined with the condensate from the denitrator-evaporator; alternatively,
it can be condensed separately and recycled to the denitrator-evaporator
to reduce the overall off-gas activity from the solidifier to less than

about 1% for radioruthenium and to 0.5% or less for all other radionuclides.

The chemical adjustments required for the phosphate glass process
consist mainly of adding phosphoric acid to the feed to obtain a meta-
phosphate melt (total normality of metal ions/phosphorus = 1). The con-
centration (mole %) of the oxides of the alkali metals is maintained at
about one-half of that of the total metal oxides in the melt in order to
obtain a glass that forms at a reasonable temperature (850 to 1000°C), melts
at a low temperature (650 to 700°C), and has good handling properties. The
solids in the chemically adjusted feed to the denitrator-evaporator are
gelatinous and are readily suspended. Concentration in the denitrator-
evaporator sometimes progresses through stages of foaming or heavy crystal-
line deposits at lower than, as well as higher than, normal concentration

factors. These conditions must be defined for each flowsheet.

Fluidized-Bed Solidification. — The fluidized-bed solidification proc-

 

ess that has been extensively developed for use with aluminum nitrate and
zirconium fluoride — aluminum nitrate wastes. Development of this process
was initiated at ANL, and has been extensively demonstrated by Idaho Nuclear
Corporation. It has been extensively demonstrated with moderate radio-
activity levels in production-scale equipment since 1963, and is now ready
for commercial application. Development with the more complex Purex wastes
has been limited. The advantages of the fluidized-bed process are that it
is a continuous process with a relatively high capacity for a given equip-
ment size, and the solidified waste product is readily transportable by
pneumatic means. Its disadvantage is that it is a moderately complicated

system.
L-Lh

In fluidized-bed solidification, liquid waste is continuously con-
verted to granular solids by being heated in a fluidized bed of the solids,
and the solids are continuously withdrawn from the calciner to storage bins
(or the solids may be further converted to monolithic forms). The liquid
waste is injected through pneumatic atomizing nozzles into the side of a
heated (1,00 to 600°C) bed of granular solids. This bed is continuously
agitated (fluidized) by sparging gas upward through the fluidized-bed
reactor. Contact of the waste with the hot, granular bed results in evapo-
ration and calcination of the feed as coatings of the bed particles. The
calcine that is entrained with the process gases from the calciner is re-
moved from the gas stream by cyclone separators or filters, and is then
returned to the main stream of particles. The main stream of particles

is continuously removed from the reactor and transported to storage bins.

The product from fluidized-bed solidification is granular, with a
mean particle diameter of about 500 um. The granules may be composed of
crystals or amorphous solids. The granules are generally spherically
shaped, and are moderately soft and friable. The thermal conductivity of

the bulk calcine is relatively low.

The basic items of equipment required for fluidized-bed calcination
are: (1) an atomizing nozzle and a reactor for atomizing and calcining
the feed, (2) a means for heating the bed of calcine in the reactor,

(3) an off-gas cleaning system located immediately downstream of the
fluidized-bed reactor to remove the bulk of the entrained calcine dust

73

from the off-gases,'~ and (lL) a storage container for the calcined solids.

The heat for calcining must be provided in such a manner that the
maximum temperature of the heat-transfer surface is less than the sinter-
ing point of the calcine, and the heat must be distributed in such a
manner that is can be absorbed by the needs of the reactor. For small
reactors (less than about 12 in. in diameter), the heat has been provided
solely through the walls of the reactor, using conventional electric heat-

Th-76

ing systems. For larger reactors (and for some smaller reactors),
additional heat has been added through heat-transfer surfaces inside the
reactor bed to provide better heat distribution. Liquid NaK has been

satisfactorily demonstrated as a heat-transfer fluid at the Waste
L-L5

Calcination Facility (WCF), located at Idaho Falls, Idaho, and the com-
bustion of gases 1s being investigated as an alternative heating method. !
For high-level wastes having high rates of self-heat generation, the
fluidized-bed system requires a means for cooling the contents of the bed
or for dumping the bed during shutdown periods. Such provisions will
eliminate the potential for self-overheating of the bed when the flow of

feed to the bed is terminated.

Containers for fluidized-bed calcine may be individual pots, as dis-
cussed previously, or they may be large slab or annular containers, as
demonstrated at the wer, 7

by air or water circulating around the outsides of the concentric annuli

The latter geometry provides for heat removal

between the concentric storage bins. Thus far, containers for storing
fluidized-bed calcine have been made of stainless steel; however, mild

steel could possibly be used if air cooling were provided.

The fluidized-bed process has been amply demonstrated in the WCF
with aluminum nitrate and aluminum nitrate — zirconium fluoride wastes

77,79,80

having moderately high radioactivity levels. The relatively

limited development with Purex wastes indicates that the calcination of
such wastes by fluidized-bed calcination is expected to be successful. 220]
Purex wastes are less amenable to processing than aluminum wastes because
of their greater solubility in the feed solution, their relatively high
decomposition temperature, and the low melting point of the sodium nitrate
in the wastes. Although these characteristics cause increased agglomera-
tion of particles and increased formation of lumps around the nozzle, the
formation of agglomerates can be controlled by impingement air-jet grinding,
variations in fluidizing gas rates, and simple modifications to commercial

75,81

atomizing nozzles.

Characteristics of Solidified Waste. — The three conditions that will

 

determine the desirable characteristics of solidified waste are: (1) in-
terim storage, (2) transportation to long-term storage, and (3) long-term
storage. The basic criterion is that radioactivity beyond safe limits

is not permitted to enter the human environment. The desired character-
istics of solidified waste with primary importance are: (71) high thermal
conductivity, (2) low leachability by water (or possibly air), (3) good
chemical stability and radiation resistance, (Li) mechanical ruggedness,
(5) noncorrosiveness to container, (6) minimum volume, and (7) minimum

cost,

The net effect of high thermal conductivity is to increase the allow-
able heat-generation rate in a pot. This characteristic also reduces the
amount of time that liquid waste must be stored before solidification and
permits possible reductions in the volumes for solidified wastes. These
effects are summarized in Fig. Li.L, for values that are typical for wastes
from thermal reactors. The heat-generation rates of wastes from processing
the mixed core and blanket fuels of future fast reactors will not be sig-
nificantly different from those in Fig. L.L after the first half-year of
decay.

Low leachability of the solidified products is desired in order to
minimize the amount of contamination resulting in any water that might
contact a breached container of solidified waste. The leachability and
other characteristics of wastes solidified by the processes developed in
the United States are shown in Table L.6. In the case of the best solidi-
fied waste materials produced to date, less than one-millionth of the

radionuclides are leached per unit specific surface per day.

On the first contact of melt-solidified waste with water, the leach-
ability is relatively high; then, over a period of 10 to 50 days, it

decreases by about a factor of 10 to a relatively steady rate.

The chemical stability and radiation resistance of solidified waste
are important for two reasons. First, they ensure that gases, which may
significantly affect the integrity of the product (or container, if pres-
ent), are not generated during storage. Second, they ensure that the
basic structure and properties of the solidified waste are known. Expe-
rience to date indicates that the formation of gas from solidified waste
in enclosed containers is generally not significant if the storage tem-

78,82,85-87

perature does not approach processing temperature. However,

a few exceptions have been indicated for calcine prepared from feeds with
a high sodium nitrate content (nitrogen oxide volatility)oO and for some
phosphate-sulfate melts (sulfur oxide volatility). oo Some "nonvolatile"
constituents have been found to volatilize at temperatures above process-
ing temperatures. For example, at 800°C, significant volatilization of
cesium and ruthenium occurs from alumina solids prepared by the fluidized-
bed process; 0 at 1200°C or higher, boron is volatilized from borosilicate

glasses, and some phosphate is volatilized from phosphate melts?

The basic structure and chemical properties of solidified waste will
change with time because about 15% of the fission products present after
6 months out of the reactor will eventually decay to other chemical ele-
ments. For calcines, this 15% represents up to 10% of the oxides present
in the total waste; for melts, it represents up to 5% of the oxides present.
A clear definition of these changes with regard to properties and their
effects is not well known. Some glasses will devitrify to microcrystalline
structures if held at LOO to 800°C for days or weeks; | »62,83,85,89,90
calcined alumina granules change from amorphous to crystalline form; ©
some volatile constituents migrate from thermally hot locations and con-
dense at cooler locations, and phosphates and other glasses sometimes

exude liquids.

Mechanical ruggedness of the solidified waste package is desirable,
primarily during transportation. In the event that the container is
breached, the ruggedness of the solidified waste is important in terms of
its tendency to be dispersed. A waste that has low leachability, but is
very brittle or easily scattered, may contaminate the environs to the same

degree that a physically rugged waste with a higher leachability would.
L-50

The corrosiveness of the solidified waste to the container deter-
mines, in part, the life of the container. Corrosion of containers by
solidified wastes has indicated no problem areas in limited measurements
to date; l-00 however, very long-term effects have not been evaluated. The
useful life of the containers is expected to be much longer than the 15

to LO years for containers for liquid wastes.” 27°

The minimum volume of the solidified waste is important, primarily,
for economic reasons. In general, reducing the volume will reduce the
size and cost of containers, container storage areas, shipping equipment,
and land to be used for storage areas. Minimizing cost, without affecting

quality, is an obvious merit.

Near Future Technology. — The technology of solidification has prog-

 

ressed to the point that three of the major processes in the United States
are being demonstrated with full-activity-level wastes in engineering-scale
equipment, and the fourth major process has been demonstrated with lower-
activity-level wastes in large-scale equipment for six years. Most of the
basic technology has been obtained; nonradioactive development work is
nearly completed; and fully radioactive tests are in progress. The status
of the radioactive demonstration program at the WSEP has been summarized

recently,
Table U.7.

and experimental results from that program are presented in

The modest amount of nonradioactive development work on solidification
processes now in progress in the United States is expected to be completed
within the next two years, unless new applications arise. A small amount
of laboratory-scale flowsheet work for special problems may continue beyond
that time. Current work includes that on fluidized-bed calcination at ICPP,
phosphate glass solidification at BNL, and spray solidification at BNW.

On completion of these studies, basic process and equipment technology will

have been developed for general use.

Also, during 1970, demonstration of three processes (pot, spray, and
phosphate glass solidification) with Purex wastes will be completed in the
WSEP. The processes will have been demonstrated using fully radioactive

wastes with thermal power and fission-product contents equivalent to the

po

maximum expected from advanced light-water reactors and fast-breeder
reactors. The operation of the fluidized-bed calcination facility at
ICPP will continue to convert aluminum nitrate and zirconium fluoride

wastes to granular calcine having a thermal power up to about 1 w/liter.

teristics of solids generated in the ICPP and stored at higher temperatures
(about 700°C) will also have been investigated. - Current data ts92,95
on economics of waste solidification and its management will be updated and

well defined.

At least a small amount of developmental effort on any process in the
nuclear fuel reprocessing industry, including waste solidification, will
be required for any specific application that has not been previously demon-
strated. The developmental requirements may be limited to laboratory tests;
however, because of the high degree of reliability needed in the nuclear
fuel reprocessing industry, a short demonstration program in pilot plants

is frequently warranted.

1.3.3 Interim Storage of Solidified Wastes

 

Conceptual designs and cost estimates have been made for the storage
of solidified, encapsulated power-reactor-fuel wastes for periods up to
30 years in water-filled canals, in air-cooled annular bins, and in air-
cooled concrete vaults. While the bins and vaults were not characterized
specifically as facilities for either "interim storage" or "permanent
disposal," the systems, as conceived, should probably be considered suit-

able for storage over decades rather than centuries.

The interim storage of solid wastes can be accomplished safely in much
less complex and less expensive systems than those required for the storage
of the corresponding liquid wastes, although equivalent amounts of decay
heat must be dissipated in all facilities having comparable inventories of
radionuclides. An essential safeguard to be supplied is a thoroughly
reliable and independent backup method for removing this heat in the event

of a failure of the primary system.

Water-Filled Canals. — Canals were chosen for the interim storage
of solids in ORNL waste-management evaluations because of their better

facility (Fig. L.5) consists of a central-facility canal, storage canals,
and a service area containing water-cooling and purification equipment.

The central facility was designed for receiving cylinders of waste from

the solidification plant, and for routing them to the proper canal for
storage. It was equipped with bridge cranes of 100- and 5-ton capacities
mounted on tracks overhead. The containers of solidified waste were stored
upright in a series of 2L-ft-wide canals adjoining the central facility.

The depth of the canals, as determined by the thickness of water needed for
shielding and by the depth required to maintain the cylinders in an upright
position, varied from 23 to 28 ft. As an aid in locating defective cyl-
inders during storage, aluminum partitions were provided, spaced 8 ft apart,
along the lengths of the canals. These partitions would channel the water
for purposes of monitoring. The canal water was recycled for demineraliza-
tion and cooling, and a structure was provided to house the area. About

500 ft of 2h-ft-wide canals would be required to store the solidified acid
wastes that would accumulate over a 10-year period from an installed 23,500-
Mw nuclear economy. In the year 2000, it 1s projected that 7230 ft of
2)i-ft-wide canals will be required for 10-years interim storage of all so-

lidified high-level fuel reprocessing wastes (see Table 3.61).

Air-Cooled Annular Bins. — A conceptual design for the storage of

 

granular solids obtained from the fluidized-bed solidification of power-
reactor fuel-reprocessing wastes was patterned after the original solids-
storage facilities at the cpp.” The solids are pneumatically transported
to nested annular, vented, air-cooled, stainless steel bins contained in
underground concrete vaults. The thickness of the bins is dependent upon

the volumetric heat-generation rate and the thermal properties of the solids;
heat is removed by air that is circulated by forced convection through 2-in.-

wide passages separating the annular sections.

Air-Cooled Concrete Vaults. — Five 150-ft-long, 28-ft-wide, and 18-ft-

high concrete vaults, ventilated through a single stack, were proposed by

the British for storing waste that had been converted into cylinders of
glass by the Fingal process.’ In this concept, the vaults are con-
structed above grade and equipped with a mild-steel liner, which is
surrounded by thermal insulation to maintain the concrete at ambient
temperature. Air is circulated by fans to remove decay heat during the
early years of storage, with the expectation that natural-draft ventila-
tion would suffice thereafter. A facility of the size considered in this
concept would contain the solidified wastes that would accumulate from
reprocessing 1500 metric tons of Magnox fuel annually over about a 28-year
period. To maintain safe storage conditions, ventilation would be required

for 200 years.

L.3.l4, Disposal of Solidified Wastes in Bedded Salt Formations

Background. — In September 1955, at the request of the AEC, a com-
mittee of geologists and geophysicists was established by the National
Academy of Sciences - National Research Council (NAS - NRC) to consider
the disposal of high-level radioactive wastes in geologic structures within
the continental United States. This committee proposed storage in natural
salt formations as the most promising method for the near future.” As a
result of the recommendations of this committee, a study of the problems

of disposing of high-level radioactive waste in salt was begun.

Some of the advantages of natural salt formations as repositories for

radioactive wastes are:
1. Salt is essentially impermeable due to its plastic properties.

2. Salt is widely distributed and abundant, underlying about
500,000 square miles in the United States (see Fig. 4.6) and

1 1
with known reserves greater than 6 x 101° tons. 00,10

3. The cost of developing space is relatively low as compared

with other rock types.

Li. The heat-transfer properties of salt are good as compared

with other rock types (k = 2.5 Btu hr-t ft=* °F~1 at 200°F) 10?

5. Salt formations in the United States are located in areas of

low seismicity.

6. The compressive strength of salt is similar to that of
concrete, or about 3000 psi.

Barly investigations in the laboratory and in the field were aimed

at the disposal of liquid wastes. O00 Of

This approach was prompted by
the fact that, while processes for converting aqueous fuel-reprocessing
wastes to solids had been proposed, they were, at that time, in a very

early stage of development.

In December 1961, the NAS-NRC committee met at AEC's Savannah River
Plant to discuss progress made since the 1955 meeting and to make recom-
mendations regarding future work. The conclusions and recommendations of

08

the committee at this meeting were:

"that experience both in the field and in the laboratory on
disposal of wastes in salt have been very productive, well-
conceived; and that plans for the future are very promising.
The Committee noted that the interpretations relating to
disposal in salt are by the very nature of salt deposits
capable of being extrapolated to a considerable degree from
one deposit to another...;" [and]

"that the effect of storing dry packaged radioactive wastes

in a salt deposit be tested, and urges the Atomic Energy

Commission to consider using, at an early date, Federally

controlled land in the Hutchinson area."

Following this meeting, the AEC requested that ORNL consider the
possibility of testing or demonstrating the disposal of high-level radio-
active solids in a salt mine, using whatever sources might be available.
Consequently, several radiation sources were examined, with the final
choice being fuel assemblies from the Engineering Test Reactor (ETR) at
the National Reactor Testing Station (NRTS).

In 1962, a preliminary study indicated that it was feasible to use
irradiated fuel elements to establish the practicality of using salt for
waste disposal. In this way, it would be possible to demonstrate the
practicability of the disposal-in-salt concept before significant quanti-

ties of solidified waste would be produced.

Farly in 1963, discussions between ORNL and the AEC led to a decision

to extend considerably the scope of the demonstration as conceived in the
L-58

preliminary study. This extension in scope made it possible to obtain

a vast amount of additional information on the deformational properties
of salt at elevated temperatures, which would be valuable in the design
of an actual disposal facility, and to demonstrate the use of prototype

waste-handling equipment.

Major Conclusions from Studies of the Disposal in Natural Salt

 

Formations. — The operation of Project Salt Vault (an experimental dis-
posal of high-level radioactive waste solids in a bedded salt mine at
Lyons, Kansas, using Engineering Test Reactor fuel assemblies in lieu
of actual solidified wastes) successfully demonstrated waste-handling
equipment and techniques similar to those required in an actual disposal

operation.
containers, each containing an average of about 200,000 Ci, was trans-
ferred to the disposal facility in the mine and then returned to the NRTS
at the end of the test. No hot cells were used at the mine; and, even
under these conditions, the maximum personnel exposure was only about 200
mrads to the hands and head. In an actual disposal facility, hot cells
would be required since the waste containers will offer only single con-
tainment. (The fuel cladding and the sealed canister was considered as

double containment.)

During the 19-month operation of the radioactive phase of the demon-
stration, the average dose to the salt over the depth of the fuel assembly
container holes was about 8 x 10° rads, and the peak dose was about 10°
rads. The dose decreased very rapidly with distance out into the salt;
for example, the dose at 6 in. into the salt was only about 10° rads. As
anticipated from the laboratory studies, no significant radiation effects

were detected.

Theoretical studies indicate that some free chlorine should be
radiolytically produced within the salt structure; however, as predicted
from laboratory studies, no detectable quantities of chlorine were re-
leased. Small quantities of what is believed to be a radiolytically pro-
duced organic peroxide were detected when the salt temperature exceeded
175°C, but this is expected to be of no consequence in an actual disposal

operation. Although ultimate doses to the salt by wastes of the future
L-59

may exceed 10*° rads, the mass of salt involved will still be small and

no detrimental effects are anticipated.

Both theoretical and experimental results indicate that rock salt
is approximately equivalent to concrete as an absorber of gamma radia-
wien, 0 If this is true, approximately 5 ft of solid salt or 7-1/2 ft
of crushed salt (assuming one-third to be composed of voids) will give
adequate biological shielding to allow unlimited access to a salt mine
room whose floor is filled with the most radioactive waste containers of
the future. The containers would be located in backfilled holes in the
floor, with the tops of the containers at the proper depth and with con-

tainer spacing based on heat dissipation calculations.

Field tests have indicated that the heat-transfer properties of salt
are sufficiently close to the values determined in the laboratory that
confidence can be placed on theoretical heat-transfer calculations. ©
Calculations to date have generally been approximate and on the conserva-
tive side, but more precise calculations are being made by using more

sophisticated heat-transfer models.

At the beginning of the study of the use of salt for waste disposal,
very little was known about the effects of heat on the behavior of salt
in mines. It soon became apparent that, due to the unusual quasi-plastic
properties of rock salt, there was little hope of developing exact theo-
retical solutions for the effects of stress, temperature, and other vari-
ables on the behavior of salt in mines. Consequently, the use of model
salt pillars was investigated and found to be applicable. The behavior
of model pillars at ambient temperatures was found to correlate with
observed phenomena under actual mine conditions. It was thus concluded
that the behavior at elevated temperatures could be extrapolated to mine

conditions. This conclusion has been borne out by the field tests.

The most significant finding in the field tests regarding the effects
of heat on salt behavior is that the insertion of heat sources in the floor
of a mine room produces a thermal stress whose effects are instantaneously
transmitted around the opening (to the pillars and roof). 07 These stresses

produce increased plastic flow rates in the salt, and could possibly cause
L-60 we

mine stability problems if the roof of the room is very near a shale -
layer (a plane of weakness). In the demonstration area, such a shale
layer existed at about 2 ft above the ceiling; however, it was found
that conventional roof-bolting techniques were adequate to handle the
problem. In an actual disposal operation, it is anticipated that rooms
would be filled with waste and then backfilled with crushed salt rapidly
enough that roof bolts would probably not be required.

The combined field and laboratory tests have provided sufficient
information on the deformation characteristics of the salt to allow the
development of both general and specific empirical criteria for design

of a disposal facility in almost any bedded salt deposit.

In the course of these tests, it was discovered that small brine-
filled cavities (in general, roughly cubic in shape, with sizes ranging
from a few millimeters to microscopic) migrate toward a heat source. 07 -
A typical bedded salt deposit might contain about 1/2% water by volume.
Calculations based on theoretical models and laboratory tests of the -
migration rates, as a function of temperature, were in reasonable agree-
ment. 2 Based on theoretical calculations, one might expect a total
inflow of 2 to 10 liters of brine per waste container hole, which would
take place over a period of 20 to 30 years after burial. The peak inflow
rate of 200 ml to 1 liter per year per hole would occur about 1 year after
burial. This brine inflow rate would be expected to taper off and approach
zero after 20 to 30 years. Inflow rates similar to these were observed -

in the demonstration.

The field tests indicated that, once the migrating brine reaches the =
crushed salt backfilling the hole, the moisture moves upward and condenses -
in the colder regions above the waste containers. Since the upper regions »
of the waste containers may not be full of waste, the upper ends of the
containers may be located in the condensation zone under some conditions.

If this is the case, stress-corrosion-cracking of these portions of con-
tainers made of stainless steel may be anticipated. However, container
failure would not be anticipated during the relatively short period of

operation in an individual room (typically, about 1 month). If the con-

tainers are made of mild steel, then only generalized rusting may be
L-61

expected, and container integrity should be maintained for an indefinite
period of years. Even if some containers do fail, this should not produce
any problem since there should be no gas pressure in the containers. In
the event that a cylinder becomes pressurized and then ruptures, the 7

to 8 ft of crushed salt above the containers would be expected to act as
a filter and absorber for any material released. If some material should
manage to escape the hole in spite of the crushed salt, the anticipated
operating procedure will prevent ventilating air from coming in contact
with personnel after it passes a waste storage room. Provision will also
be made to route the ventilating air through an air-cleaning system and
up a stack in the event of an activity release.

Generalized Concept of a Disposal-in-Salt Facility. — A generalized

concept | 3

of a mine facility to dispose of containers of solidified high-
level radioactive wastes has evolved over a period of more than 10 years
of research at ORNL. The facility is discussed here primarily to intro-
duce the mode of operation, the basic elements, and the various require-
ments. Such a disposal facility could be located at any suitable place
where an area underlain by bedded salt of appropriate thickness and depth
is available. One quadrant of this postulated area is shown in Fig. L.7.
Each quadrant or sector around a central shaft complex would be developed
and utilized in sequence. Initial development requires outlining the
sector with dual corridors in order to maintain a dual ventilation system
throughout the operations. Also, one row of rooms would have to be exca-
vated before disposal could commence. One ventilation system serves the
salt excavation activities, while the other isolated system provides fresh
air to the waste-disposal operations. Operations would be conducted in
such a manner that the fresh air never passes the front of a previously

filled room before reaching areas of active waste-disposal operations.

The top of the waste shaft, which is used solely for lowering waste
containers into the mine, is contained within a topside hot cell. The
shipping casks, containing a number of waste containers, are unloaded in
this facility; the containers are inspected, recanned or decontaminated
if required, and lowered, successively, into the mine. A second hot cell,

located at the bottom of the waste shaft, serves primarily as a radiation

shield and a containment shell. Each waste container is lowered into

this hot cell and into an underground waste transporter, which might be
similar to that shown in Fig. L;.8. The waste container, enclosed in the
lead-shielded transporter, is carried to the currently active waste-
disposal room and deposited in a hole drilled in the floor; then the hole
is backfilled with crushed salt via remote methods. When the entire floor
area of a single room has been filled with waste containers, in a spacing
pattern dictated by the heat-generation rate of the waste, the room itself
is backfilled with crushed salt obtained from the excavation of the next
row of rooms. In this general concept, the corridors connecting the
filled waste rooms would also be backfilled, allowing the deformed solid
salt to reconsolidate and, in time, the crushed salt, to recrystallize.
Recrystallization of the crushed salt at the elevated pressure and tempera-
tures would completely isolate the waste materials and thus prevent any

possible contact with the environment.

Concept of an Initial Repository. — A study was made of the feasi-

 

bility of establishing a repository in salt to serve the nation's needs
for the next two to three decades. The availability of solidified wastes
from the nuclear power industry and the cumulative space in salt required
for their burial after |; years and 10 years of aging are summarized in
Table 1.8. These two particular aging periods were chosen as a basis for
the study because burial prior to lL years after their generation would
entail a considerable cost premium, whereas there would be relatively
little cost reduction for wastes aged more than about 10 years. In actual
practice, wastes may become available at some intermediate age or, what

is more probable, in a mixture of ages and container sizes. It was con-
cluded from Table 1.8 that, for lLi-year-old wastes, the quantity available
for burial will be large enough and will increase so rapidly that a dis-
posal facility should be ready to accept wastes near the end of calendar
year 1975. In the case of wastes that have been aged for 10 years, the
first facility should be ready by 1981. Although the wastes could be back-
logged at their source for several additional years before they are buried
in salt, it is considered essential to inaugurate a new facility of this

nature slowly and to gain experience with waste-handling equipment and

procedures before undertaking high-volume operations. If 20 years is
assumed to be a reasonable operating life, based on economics and obso-

lescence, a gross mine area of 835 acres is indicated.

In the consideration of siting requirements for an initial reposi-
tory, salt domes were eliminated because of inadequate knowledge of their
possible behavior (some domes are believed to be undergoing movement),
and because some are in contact with circulating ground water, which is
known to have caused flooding in at least one mine (see Sect. 4.3.2).

A suitable bedded salt deposit should be at least 200 ft thick and lie
between 500 and 2000 ft below the surface. To ensure long-term stability,
a considerable thickness of shale or some other impermeable rock should
overlie the salt, and the excavation itself should be located well within
the salt deposit. The maximum depth is governed by mine stability condi-
tions during the operating period and cost considerations (costs increase
at greater depths due to shaft length and the increased amount of salt
that must be left as support pillars). For example, a disposal facility
at a depth of 500 ft (about the minimum desirable depth) could be operated
at a cost about 5 to 7% less than a similar facility at 1000 ft. At

1500 ft, the operating costs would be 15 to 18% more than at 1000 ft; at
2000 ft, the cost would be 25 to 33% greater than at 1000 ft. The four
areas known to meet these criteria are shown in Fig. L.6. The largest
area (about 10,000 square miles) lies in central Kansas; two smaller areas

are in Michigan; and one small area is in west-central New York.

Other major siting requirements are: (1) the site must offer means
for disposing of excess salt as a "backup" in the event that the salt can-
not be routinely marketed, (2) it must not be adjacent to large population
centers and related high land values, (3) it must be accessible by rail and
highway, and (L) it must be acceptable to public officials and private

citizens of the area.

For purposes of cost estimation, a mine depth of 1000 ft was selected
and disposal costs were calculated for L- and 10-year old wastes over mine
operating periods of 1975-1995 and 1981-2002, respectively. Two possibili-
ties were considered: (1) that a new mine was developed especially for

this purpose, and (2) that initial phases of the operation began in an
L-67

existing, inactive mine. In all cases, costs were escalated to 1971

levels, and 5% was used as the cost of money.

For a new mine, the initial capital outlay required before start of
operations was about $17.5 million; in contrast, the initial outlay for
a facility starting in an existing mine was only about $70.5 million.
The total costs over the entire period ranged from $91 - $95 million,
for use of an existing mine, to $101 - $106 million for a new mine. The
corresponding costs, in terms of kilowatt-hours of electricity produced,
ranged from 0.0055 to 0.0067 mill/kwhr.

L.3.5 Disposal of Solidified Wastes in Rock Types Other than
Bedded Salt

The widespread occurrence of rock salt throughout the United States
has been commonly accepted as one of the principal advantages for the use
of these rocks as storage sites for radioactive waste materials. Indeed,
salt deposits do underlie portions of 24 of the 50 states; however, from
recent laboratory and field studies on the flowage of rock salt at ele-
vated temperatures and high overburden loads, it is apparent that many

11h

there are perhaps three principal areas in the United States where dis-

of these deposits are unsuitable for disposal sites. At present,

posal in salt would appear to be highly desirable. These areas are:

(1) the Silurian salt deposits of the Northeast, which underlie parts of
New York, Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Ohio, and Michigan; (2) the Permian
basin salts, which underlie parts of Kansas, Oklahoma, Texas, and New
Mexico; and (3) the Gulf Coast Embayment salts, which underlie parts of
louisiana, Texas, Arkansas, and Mississippi (see Fig. 4.6). The first two

areas are bedded deposits, while the latter contains only salt domes.

Most of the other deposits throughout the United States are less
suitable because of their great depths below the surface, their numerous
inclusions of other rock types, or a general lack of knowledge concerning
their extents, depths, etc. In general, mine workings at great depths in
salt are initially expensive to open and, due to the greater overburden
loads, accelerated deformation of the salt occurs. The presence of other

rock types with the salt beds may further accelerate the deformation of
1-68

the salt. For instance, in the Williston basin, which covers a part of
North Dakota, the minimum depth to salt is 3600 ft; also, the bed is only
about 20 ft thick. Thicker deposits occur, but they lie between L300

and 2000 ft below the surface. Salt beds are also present in Florida,

but they are only about 30 ft thick and occur at depths of 10,000 to

12,000 ft. Even in the Permian basin, much of the salt is located at

great depths below the surface and contains numerous inclusions of other
rocks. Perhaps the principal concern in the disposal of waste in bedded
deposits is the stability of the structure at elevated temperatures and
stresses. This has been found to be especially significant when shale
beds occur interbedded with the salt. These shale beds are usually absent
in dome deposits; thus, in this respect, domes may be favored over bedded
deposits for waste disposal sites. From recent laboratory and field tests,
it appears that efficient and safe operations in bedded rock salt can be
designed; however, there are several problems, unique to salt dome deposits,
that require investigation before a similar operation can be designed for

these structures.

More than 300 salt domes are now known to be present in the Gulf Coast

Embayment. There are no shale beds overlying these formations, the salt

is of a higher purity than that found in bedded deposits, and the domes
often occur relatively near the land surface. Many lie between 500 and
1000 ft below the surface; and, of course, the salt extends to depths of
many thousands of feet. A large part of the available mined-out space in
salt deposits also exists in salt domes. Approximately LO% of the total
space vacated by rock salt mining each year results from workings in the

domes of the Gulf Coast region.

The principal technical concern in the disposal of waste to salt domes
is in ensuring that migrating waters do not reach the stored waste. The
recent flooding of the Winnfield, louisiana, dome mine may serve to illus-
trate the concern. Also, in Germany, where domal-type salt structures have
been mined for many years, at least 20 mines have been reported to have
been flooded by groundwaters. At present, apparently little is known about
the movement of groundwater in the vicinity of salt domes; thus, prior to

utilization of these domes for radioactive disposal media, investigations

ne
af

4-69

would have to be initiated to ascertain the geohydrological factors or
other parameters that were, or appeared to be, instrumental in the flood-
ing at Winnfield and other salt domes. It is obvious that the distance
between mine workings and aquifers is important, but it is not possible

to state at this time, for example, what the minimum distance would be
under specified conditions of mine depth, structural and stratigraphic
conditions of the intruded native rocks, etc. Once the important para-
meters that bear most directly on mine flooding are identified, laboratory
and/or field investigations, if necessary, would have to be initiated to

demonstrate that safe and efficient disposals can be made in salt domes.

Even though salt is believed to be the most suitable environment for
the ultimate disposal of high-level waste, and it is widely distributed
throughout the country, it does not underlie any of the major AEC labora-
tories and plants that are currently engaged in fuel reprocessing or
waste disposal. In addition, of the six geologic basins recently dis-
cussed by the American Association of Petroleum Geologists for radioactive
waste-disposal potential, only three contain salt deposits. > Thus, even
though high-level wastes could be shipped to areas where salt structures
are available for ultimate disposal, they could probably also be safely
and economically stored in other rock types that may be available at a

given site or areas adjacent to it.

Dry mine workings are probably not as commonplace as are wet mines
in the United States. However, thick and relatively undisturbed beds of
limestone and shale (and even granite and other crystalline rocks) exist,
many of which are essentially free of circulating water. For instance,
in Barberton, Ohio, a dry 2000-ft-deep limestone mine is in operation. ©
Also, mined caverns in chalk near Demopolis, Alabama, have been found to
be relatively free of water. | Excavations in thick shale beds in
Illinois have remained dry since they were opened.” It is reported that
a mine in crystalline rocks in Ontario, Canada, has remained free of water
even though the mine is situated directly beneath a large lake.” Loess
deposits offer another possibility for the disposal of high-level waste
in some areas above the water table.” Evaporite deposits other than rock

salt (e.g., potash, trona, anhydrite, gypsum, etc.) may also be suitable.
L-70

For hard rock, such as limestone and granite, it is expected that
mined cavities will remain stable under loads up to several thousand psi
and temperatures up to a few hundred degrees centigrade. Recent model
pillar tests on samples of dolomite from a local (ORNL) quarry show that
there are negligible amounts of deformation in the rock up to loads of
10,000 psi and temperatures as high as 200°C. In comparison, it is of
interest that, in similar pillar model tests for rock salt at tempera-
tures of 200°C and 6000 psi, pillar deformation had exceeded 35% after
only 1 hr. Thus it appears that the structural integrity of the exca-
vated openings in these rocks, due to the superincumbent load, will not
be of primary concern in the event that these rocks should be used as
storage media; however, it is likely that such factors as ensuring the
isolation of these excavations from migrating groundwaters and the geo-
graphic location of suitable deposits and their vertical and lateral
extents, along with possible radiation and heat effects on the rocks,

would be critical.

On a regional basis, it appears that the most promising areas of
rock deposits suitable for radioactive waste storage would include rela-
tively tectonically undisturbed areas such as the mid-continent region
of the United States. Other areas, such as the Colorado Plateau, would
also appear to be highly desirable. In parts of the arid west, where
there is no groundwater recharge from rainfall and where site locations
in rock exist above the water table, suitable excavations may also be
practicable. In many localities within these areas, it is likely that
horizontal shaft-type or tunneling operations may be feasible. This
method of excavation is preferable, in many respects, to vertical shaft
mining since it is generally agreed that mining costs are lower and the
openings are more accessible. Tunneling into the faces of hills, escarp-
ments, or other topographic features of high relief is a common method
for mining limestone in many areas where horizontal bedding prevails.
Many mines of this type in Middle Tennessee have been found to be struc-
turally stable; and, except for some leakage at the mine entrances, they
are entirely free of circulating groundwater. On a larger scale, under-

ground excavations in limestone near Kansas City, Kansas are currently

he
L-71

being used as refrigerated cold storage bins. Here, facilities have
been provided to accommodate the storage of entire rail cars and their

refrigerated products in tunneled-out, dry cavities.

In summary, it is apparent that dry openings that could be utilized
for the storage of radioactive wastes can be excavated in rocks other
than salt; however, investigations are needed to define more precisely
such factors as the geohydrological and geotopographical conditions that
determine the usefulness of local sites within the most desirable geo-
graphic regions and the effects of heat and radiation on the enclosed

rock media.

i.i Waste Management Technology: Intermediate-
and Low-level Wastes

The volumes of intermediate-level wastes obtained from evaporating
second- and third-cycle raffinates, product concentration, cell and equip-
ment decontamination, solvent cleanup, and off-gas scrubbers, range from
200 to 500 gal per metric ton of fuel processed. They are principally
nitrate solutions of sodium, potassium, aluminum, and iron, and often
contain sulfate, fluoride, and phosphate in addition. Their activity
levels are generally several tenths of a curie per gallon. In the United
States, they are stored in underground tanks, sometimes mixed with clad-
ding wastes. In the United Kingdom, they are discharged to coastal waters
under carefully monitored conditions after suitable periods of decay. 0
At Marcoule, they are partially decontaminated by coprecipitation and
coagulation at a pH of about 11.5, using lime, NaH,PO,, A1,(SO.)s, and

tannin. The resulting sludges are mixed with asphalt, packaged in
barrels, and stored in protected areas; the decontaminated effluents are

discharged to the Rhone River.

In addition, a plant may discharge several tens of thousands of gal-
lons of contaminated organic solvent wastes annually. These are usually

either burned or stored in tanks.

The low-level liquid wastes from fuel processing are not greatly
different, chemically, from natural waters. They contain only very small

amounts of inert chemicals and radionuclides in addition to those chemicals
L-72

that contribute to natural hardness. The radionuclides of greatest
routine importance in these wastes are °°Sr, *°7Cs, ©®Ru, and °H;
however, under unusual circumstances of accidental contamination, other
fission products, as well as ©°Co, U, Pu, and Th, may also be present.
These wastes are very large in volume. Evaporator condensates alone
may average 10,000 gal per metric ton of fuel processed, and the total
generation from all sources within a plant may average several hundred
thousands of gallons per day. Because of their great volumes and low
concentrations of radionuclides, these wastes have been suitable for

environmental disposal.

At AEC production sites, where processing plants are located on
large tracts of land, ground disposal via seepage basins, cribs, trenches,
etc., has been practiced. In these cases, the sorptive capacity of the
soils is such that the majority of the isotopes are retained and, in turn,
contamination of the ground water is reduced. Each year during the past
5 years, almost 1 billion gal of low-level waste, containing an average
of 35 to 415 kilocuries of radionuclides, has been safely discharged in
this manner. In Europe, such wastes receive appropriate treatment for

decay or decontamination and are then released to the sea or to rivers.

The release of limited amounts of radionuclides to the environment
has played an important part in waste management practices to date. It
has not been uncommon for low-level liquid wastes to be discharged di-
rectly to environmental waters without treatment, depending upon large
dilution factors to reduce potential radiation exposure of populations to
acceptable levels. A review of these practices in North America 20 (sum-
marized in Tables };.9 and ;.10) shows that the quantities of isotopes
released have been controlled so that the exposure of people from this
source has been considerably less than the limits recommended by the ICRP

and other authoritative bodies.

The trend, however, is toward relatively less dependence on the
environmental disposal of radioactive wastes. This reflects an awareness
of the projected greatly increased production and application of radio-
isotopes, and of the realization that the pressures of an expanding popu-

lation and nuclear industry will make it difficult for "remoteness" to

provide the necessary safety factor between the point of waste discharge
and the point of population exposure. Present regulations, 10 CFR 20,
encourage a minimum of dependence on environmental dispersion and contain
a standard clause requiring reduction of the radioactivity in effluents
to 10% of the continuous occupational MPC before the effluents are dis-
charged to unrestricted areas; however, amendment of licenses to permit
higher limits is possible if the licensee makes a "reasonable effort" to
minimize radioactive discharges and if the resulting exposure of indi-
viduals in nearby areas is not likely to exceed 10% of the continuous

occupational MPC.

L.k.1 Treatment of Liquid Wastes

 

Evaporation, ion exchange, and coprecipitation and coagulation proc-
esses are most frequently used for removing radionuclides from low-level
wastes; the choice of treatment depends on factors such as the degree of
decontamination required, the volume of waste to be treated, and the con-
siderations of cost that pertain at the installation in question. Al-
though evaporation generally yields the highest decontamination factors
(i.e., ratios of the activity in the feed to that in condensates of 10%
to 10° are routinely obtained), the cost is in the range of several cents
per gallon. Single-stage coprecipitation processes typically remove from
60 to 90% of the radioactivity at a cost of $0.25 to $1.00 per thousand
gallons. Ion exchange with either natural minerals or organic resins is
frequently used in conjunction with precipitation for additional decon-
tamination at extra cost. In addition to partially decontaminated waste
water (which can be released to surface waters), each process produces a
sludge, a slurry, or a solution containing the separated isotopes. This
material is usually packaged and may have to be shipped off-site for

burial.

There has been an increasing emphasis on research and development
aimed at treatment processes that will provide high decontamination fac-
tors for the bulk of the waste volume. Such processes will permit envi-
ronmental disposal at or near MPC levels, and allow concentration of the

bulk of the radionuclides into a relatively small volume, which can be
11-76

stored or converted to an essentially insoluble solid suitable for dis-
posal by burial. Improved scavenging-precipitation methods have been
studied, both alone and in combination with ion exchange and other sorp-
tion processes. Attention has been given to incorporating the precipita-
tion sludges, organic wastes, the ion exchange regenerants, the ion
exchange media, and ashes from the incineration of combustible waste mate-
rials into low-solubility solid bodies for disposal by burial. In addi-
tion, a method, based on the hydraulic fracturing of shale, has been

developed for disposing of liquid wastes.

Scavenging-Precipitation. — The treatment of low-level liquid waste

 

has usually involved a scavenging-precipitation step, either alone or as
the first step in a series. This step includes: (1) formation of a bulk
precipitate that contains some of the trace-level radioactive species;

or (2) precipitation of a flocculating agent such as ferric hydroxide or
aluminum hydroxide to promote separation of suspended solids, precipitates,
and colloidal species in the waste; or both (1) and (2). Common examples
of coprecipitation include strontium with calcium carbonate or calcium
phosphate, and cesium with copper or nickel ferrocyanide. %. Single-stage
scavenging-precipitation processes do not usually give high decontamina-
tion factors (they are typically 2 to 10, and rarely as high as 100).

The actual value obtained depends on the radioactive species, the chemis-
try of the precipitation step, and the efficiency of the clarification
method. Recent work on improving clarification efficiency includes the

use of zeta-potential control to optimize flocculation conditions, 2°
especially with regard to radiocolloid removal, and the use of an optimum
arrangement of filter coal and sand in a polishing filter after floccula-

123

tion and clarification.

Inorganic Ion Exchange. — The use of inorganic exchange materials in

 

waste treatment has received considerable attention. This attention can
be attributed to: (71) studies of exchange reactions of minerals that have
been made in connection with ground disposal of wastes, (2) a desire to
use inexpensive natural sorbents that can be disposed of as solid wastes
instead of more-expensive synthetic materials, which usually must be re-

generated and reused, and (3) an attempt to find sorbents that are highly
L-77

selective for particular waste components. The use of vermiculite col-
ums by the British to provide additional waste decontamination, espe-
cially for cesium, after one or two scavenging-precipitation steps is
the “classical” Se of the application of natural exchange materials
rial to be developed for sorption column application is clinoptilolite,
125,126 The addition of

which has been studied extensively at Hanford.
grundite clay in scavenging~-precipitation steps to improve cesium decon-
tamination is another example of the use of natural exchange materials
in waste treatment. 22 The use of an activated alumina bed to remove
phosphate, which otherwise would interfere with the precipitation of
calcium carbonate from low-level waste, is an interesting application of

a synthetic inorganic sorbent. 122

Organic Ion Exchange. — The application of inorganic ion exchange

 

resins to radioactive waste treatment has received considerable study,
beginning early in the atomic energy program. However, the use of organic
ion exchange in actual low-level waste treatment has not been widely prac-
ticed because its cost is typically higher than a standard single-stage
scavenging-precipitation process and because the potentially higher decon-
tamination factors have not been considered necessary. As a rule, ion
exchange resins are too expensive to discard as a solid waste after a
single use; hence they are normally regenerated, and the regenerant waste
is subsequently treated as an intermediate- or high-level liquid waste.
Most ion exchange resins are not highly selective; that is, calcium and
magnesium must generally be removed with strontium, sodium must be removed
with cesium, etc. The high decontamination factors possible with ion
exchange processes are usually based not so much on selective sorption as
on the fact that performance corresponding to a large number of transfer
units or theoretical stages can be obtained with a single piece of equip-

ment .

An exception to the low-selectivity rule is the preference shown for
cesium over sodium by phenolic-base cation exchangers at pH values high
enough to ionize a significant fraction of the phenolic groups. The cesium-

sodium separation factor for a resin containing only phenolic exchange
4-78

groups is about 160; however, despite somewhat lower cesium-sodium sepa-
ration factors, polyfunctional resins such as phenolic-sulfonic and
phenolic-carboxylic have more useful capacities for treating wastes con-
taining calcium and magnesium. A several-month series of pilot-plant
tests of an integrated scavenging-precipitation, phenolic-ion exchange
process were conducted at a 10-gal/min scale with ORNL low-level waste.

In its final form, the flowsheet included a fluidiged-bed alumina column
to prevent the interference of phosphate with calcium-magnesium-strontium
precipitation. It also included a provision for the recycle of ion ex-
change regenerate waste to the scavenging-precipitation step with grundite
clay addition. All of the removed radionuclides are concentrated in the
clarifier sludge. °° The overall decontamination factors varied from

1200 to 12,000 for strontium, 100 to 3000 for cesium, 20 to 700 for rare
earths, 10 to 150 for zirconium-niobium, and 1.5 to 8 for ruthenium; the
radioactivity of the effluent was reduced to less than 2% of the continuous
occupational MPC. Cost estimates for a 750,000-gal/day plant waste treat-
ment rate were 60 to 80¢ per thousand gallons for this process under vari-

ous conditions.

Demineralization and Waste-Water Recycle. — High-decontamination-

 

factor processes such as demineralization may yield treated water that is
of higher quality than the normal water supply of the waste-producing nu-
clear facility. This raises the question of whether the waste water should
be reused instead of being discharged to the environment. Burns and Glue-
kauf considered three possible alternative schemes and concluded that lim-
ited reuse for certain purposes could be justified economically, but that
complete demineralization and general reuse were more expensive, at least
under the assumed Harwell conditions; however, work concerning the ion
exchange and electrodeionization of waste water has been continued on labo-
ratory and pilot-plant scales at Harwell. Work at ORNL on a "drinking
water" process gave decontamination factors of greater than 1000, 300, 1300,
200, 600, and 25 for Sr, Cs, Co, Ru, Ce, and Zr-Nb, respectively, with all
the activities being reduced to analytical background levels when low-level
waste was treated successively by: (1) alum coagulation under optimum zeta-

potential conditions, (2) ion exchange demineralization, and (3) passage
through activated carbon. 22

Insolubilization of Waste Concentrates. — The immobilization of

 

wastes by incorporation into relatively inert solid materials prior to
storage or disposal can be advantageous for safety and economic reasons.
Liquid wastes, such as ion-exchange regenerant wastes, and solid wastes,
such as scavenging-precipitation sludges and incinerator ashes, have been
mixed with cement or concrete to give moderately insoluble solid blocks.
A 1:1 mixture, by volume, of expanded vermiculite and cement gives a
stronger solid, with a lower leaching rate, than is obtained when vermicu-~
lite is not included. 2 A substantial volume increase occurs during the
conversion of liquid and solid wastes to concretes because of the rela-
tively large amounts of cement (and vermiculite) required. A promising
recent development is the use of bituminous material to solidify and in-
solubilize waste concentrates. This technology originated in Europe and
currently is in widespread use there on an industrial scale. A process
designed to incorporate all types of organic and alkaline aqueous wastes
or slurries in asphalt or polyethylene is being developed at ORNL. This
process appears to offer greater versatility and economy than any others

developed thus far, 225727

Lh.Lh.2 Problems with Tritium

 

Tritium is produced in the fission of 2250 and *®°Pu, with yields of
about 0.01% and 0.02% respectively. 20 It merits special consideration
from the standpoint of its management in fuel reprocessing because it is

unresponsive to separation and concentration by conventional procedures

129,130

for treating waste. In fuel reprocessing, as much as 25% of the

tritium may be released as a gas during the dissolution of metallic fuels,

but apparently less than 1% can be expected to volatilize during the
1317

There is experimental evidence that tri-

132

dissolution of oxide fuels.
tium tends to escape from oxide fuels during reactor operation; however,
the tritium remaining with the fuel can be expected to appear as tritiated

water in the reprocessing plant evaporator condensates.

Based on the projections of Sect. 3.5, the annual generation of
fission-product tritium from the Civilian Power Program may be expected

to increase from about 36,000 curies in 1970 to about 12 megacuries in the
4-80

year 2000, Allowing for natural decay, the accumulated quantity should
increase from about 36,000 curies in 1970 to about 90 megacuries in 2000.
The subsequent discussion is based on the assumption that all of the tri-

tium will be present in the fuel at the time of reprocessing.

If this tritium could be uniformly dispersed throughout the environ-
ment, the resulting increase in background would be of little signifi-
cance. °° In the actual case, however, a fuel-processing plant will have
only its immediate environs available for dispersion, and the capacity
of these environs to accept tritium will depend on the rate that the latter
is released, as well as on the many environmental factors that pertain to

the particular site.

Two immediately available possibilities for the release of tritium-
bearing wastes under existing regulations are: (1) dilution and release
directly to surface waters, and (2) distillation into the plant off-gas

system and subsequent release up the stack.

The quantity of tritium that can be released to surface waters can
be computed within the limitations that the concentration shall not exceed
the permissible concentration in water under 10 CFR 20, or 3 x 107° yc/cc
at the boundary of the controlled zone, and that the concentration shall
subsequently not exceed 1 x 107° juc/cc for the general population. If the
controlled zone borders a stream of any significant sige, the first of

these restrictions is controlling.

A ton of fuel irradiated to a burnup of 33,000 Mwd contains about 700
curies of tritium, which would require dilution in water to the extent of
about 63 million gallons before it could be released from the controlled
zone at the permissible concentration of 3 x 107% pc/cc. The total aqueous
effluent from a plant operating with a Purex process flowsheet may be as
much as 10° gal per ton of fuel processed, but this is far short of the
requirements for tritium dilution. The most practical means of achieving
the on-site dilution requirement would be to have available, for this
purpose, a stream flowing through the controlled area. To meet the speci-
fication for use by the general population, this stream would have to flow
into a larger body of water to achieve additional dilution by a factor of

3 or more.

Lad
11-81

It is desirable that a plant be situated adjacent to a large, pref-
erably navigable, river for other (and possibly more important) reasons
than tritium disposal; however, it is much less obvious that acceptable
sites should be limited to those which, in addition, encompass a stream
of the size useful for dilution. Therefore, we conclude that, with
restrictions as presently interpreted, the alternative of release to sur-

face waters is of very limited applicability as a general case.

Distillation into the plant off-gas provides a more effective means
of releasing tritium. Calculations presented in Sect. 8 indicate that
plants having spent-fuel capacities up to 20 metric tons/day and site
boundaries two to three km distant can release their tritium in this manner
under existing regulations. This is not to imply, however, that attempts
should not be made to develop methods for removing tritium, before it
becomes greatly diluted with air or process streams, and encapsulating it

for long-term storage.

L.h.3 Disposal by Hydraulic Fracturing

 

The study of a method for disposing of intermediate-level radioactive
wastes, based on the oil-field technique of hydraulic fracturing, was ini-
tiated at ORNL in 1959. 0
1966. To date (February 1970), 540,000 gal of concentrated intermediate-

The first actual waste was injected in December

level waste containing almost 340,000 curies of fission products has been
disposed of at depths of 360 to 900 ft, well below the zone of circulating

water.

The method consists of mixing the aqueous wastes with preblended dry
solids containing principally cement, and then pumping the resulting slurry
down a well and out into a conformable, nearly horizontal fracture in a
thick shale formation at the desired depth (Fig. 4.9). The cased well is
prepared for the injection by perforating the casing at the desired depth
and pressurizing the well with water. This induces a fracture in the
rocks, which is further extended as the slurry is pumped into it. After
the pumping phase is completed, the cement slurry is allowed to harden
under pressure, thereby forming a thin, horizontal grout sheet. This pro-
cedure can be repeated successively up the well, creating a stack of hori-

zontal grout sheets.

The successful application of this method required research and
development in three main areas: (1) design, construction, and testing
of the plant and equipment, including tanks, bins, mixers, and pumps
capable of safely handling the materials; (2) chemical development of mix
formulations providing, at minimum cost, a pumpable slurry and a grout
offering maximum radionuclide retention; (3) development of an understand-
ing of the mechanical behavior of the host rock under the influence of
repeated injections and suitable instruments and techniques for monitoring

that behavior.

The Plant and Its Operation. — Immediately prior to a waste injec-

 

tion, the dry solids are blended and temporarily stored at the site along
with the waste solutions. After the equipment has been checked and the
well has been prepared, the dry solids and the liquid wastes are vigor-
ously mixed, at a constant flow rate, by the jet mixer. The slurry is
then pumped to the wellhead, down the well, and out into the prefractured
shale. At ORNL this usually requires a pumping pressure ranging from
about 1500 to 2500 psi. The jet mixer, the high-pressure injection pump,
and the wellhead are enclosed in individual concrete cells to provide

shielding and to facilitate decontamination.

Development of the Mix, — The cost of the dry solids to be mixed with

 

the waste solutions represents one of the larger fixed expenses of dis-
posal by the hydraulic fracturing method. The development of the slurry
formulation was, therefore, mainly a search for less-expensive materials
and the establishment of the minimum required quantities of these materials.
Specifications that had to be met with regard to the slurry were: (1) the
slurry should have a viscosity and a thickening time such that the slurry
could be pumped and would remain fluid during the entire injection phase,
which might last up to 8 hr, (2) the slurry should harden into a grout
having at least some physical integrity within a reasonable period,

(3) all of the fluid should be taken up during the setting process so that
there would be no phase separation, and (4) the radionuclides should be

firmly retained in the grout in a reasonably unleachable state.

These requirements were met by developing a solids blend, based on

Portland cement, which provided the hardening and strength characteristics
L-8L

of the grout sheet. The cement also combines chemically with the radio-
strontium in the waste, providing satisfactory retention of that nuclide.
Since a high-strength grout was not necessary, the quantity of cement

used was approximately 5 1b/gal, about one-third the usual concentration.
Attapulgite clay was used to prevent any possible phase separation of

the slurry as the result of this low quantity of cement. Adequate pump-
ing time was assured by the addition of a small quantity of commercial
organic retarder (a sugar, delta gluconolactone). Radiocesium, the major
radionuclide in the waste, was retained by the addition of illite (Grundite)
clay. Finally, it was discovered that highly siliceous possolanic mate-
rials, such as fly ash, could be substituted for part of the cement (up to
2.5 1lb/gal) with a further reduction in cost and the added dividend of an

improved strontium retention capacity.

The formula for the mix was usually modified slightly for each injec-
tion because of small differences in the composition and concentration of
the waste, but, in general, it met the slurry specifications and provided
for about 99% retention of all radionuclides as measured by water-leaching

tests.

Monitoring. — It was realized from the beginning of the developmental
program that the behavior of the shale near the injected grout sheets and
the rocks making up the rest of the system would exercise a controlling
influence on the general applicability of the method. The rocks overlying
the injections provide both shielding and an isolation barrier, the integ-
rity of which must be maintained if the method is to be successful. Obvi-
ously, it is not possible to continue to inject grout sheets indefinitely,
one on top of another, with each injection adding an increment of rock

deformation and surface uplift.

Monitoring of the operation at Oak Ridge is carried out in several
ways. The injection pressures are carefully noted during the progress of
each injection. Any departure from the normal pattern would require shut-
ting down the operation until a survey could be made. A number of small-
diameter cased wells, which extend below the deepest fracture, are logged
with a gamma-sensitive probe after each disposal operation; new peaks of

activity show where the latest injection has intersected each of these
L-85

wells. In this way, the location and extent of each grout sheet may be
determined. At intervals, core drilling is used to confirm the informa-
tion derived from the logging and to obtain samples of the grout sheet.

The continued integrity of the rock cover is tested by periodically
attempting to pump water down each of a number of wells that are uncased
for an interval of about 100 ft, a little above the depth of the shallowest
fracture. At present, each of these wells will accept only a few gallons
of water before the pressure reaches the limit (75 psi) of the test pump.
Any marked increase in the volume of water that can be injected in this
manner would indicate an increase in the permeability of the rock cover.
The elevation of each of a widespread network of bench marks in the dis-
posal area is determined periodically with high-precision equipment. The
normal response of the land surface is to arch up very slightly with each
injection, the uplift forming a smooth dome without any marked steps or
discontinuities. If the cover rock fails in shear, there should be irregu-
larities in the surface uplift. These several methods of monitoring pro-
vide a high degree of assurance that the disposal operation is proceeding

as planned and that no hazardous conditions are being created.

The cost of disposing of intermediate-level waste by hydraulic frac-
turing has been estimated, based on the limited experience with the ORNL
plant (which was, of course, originally an experimental facility). The
total unit cost, including capital investment charges, for a plant of
approximately the same size and similar design as the one now in operation
at ORNL, disposing of approximately 100,000 gal/year in 150,000-gal batches,
would be expected to be in the range of $0.30 to $0.35/gal.

Summary. — Although hydraulic fracturing has been an extremely satis-
factory disposal method at the Oak Ridge site, it is not yet possible to
consider it without reservation for any other site. Further work is re-
quired in two main areas: (1) further development of the understanding
of the mechanisms of fracture propagation and the disturbance created in
the host rock, and (2) determination of site-testing procedures and accep-
tance criteria. O0il-field experience suggests that vertical fracturing
is more common than the (near) horizontal fractures required for waste

disposal. Since the orientation of hydraulically induced fractures is
4-86

influenced by many factors, some of which (e.g., the state-of-stress in
the ground at the site) cannot be predicted in advance, it will be neces-
sary to conduct site tests prior to adopting this method of waste disposal.
The development of improved site-testing procedures, especially with a
view toward reducing their cost, is currently in progress at ORNL. Also,

a research program to understand and predict the underground behavior of

the injected grout sheets is being continued.

L;.5 Waste Management Technology: Solid Wastes

This section is limited to considerations of the solid wastes from
fuel reprocessing operations other than the solidified high-level raffi-

nates from the solvent extraction processes that are discussed in Sect. [.3.

L.5.17 Land Burial

Much of the information summarized below was taken from a report that
was prepared primarily for those who may be involved in the evaluation and

135

approval of proposed waste burial operations. It contains current in-

formation and recommendations regarding commercial waste burial practice.

Waste solids that may be radioactive are produced in practically all
operations involving the production or utilization of nuclear materials.
The low-level solid wastes of greatest volume, for which land disposal is
most suitable and advantageous, are designated as '"low-hazard potential
and consist typically of paper trash, packing material, broken glassware,
clothing, experimental animal carcasses, and contaminated equipment or

building material.

Table 1.11 shows the volumes of solid waste buried at AEC sites begin-
ning with fiscal year 1961. Total volumes of solid waste buried at the
commercial burial grounds beginning in 1962 are shown in Table MERLE
Burial charges have ranged from $1.50 to about $0.70/ft®. Based on current
average charges of about $1.00/ft®, this table is a reasonable indication

of the size of the market for burial service.

The practice of burying solid wastes at selected land sites began very

early in the Manhattan District and AEC programs. The possibility that the
L-87

buried radionuclides might be leached, with resulting contamination of
groundwater (and possibly of surface water), prompted extensive studies

of various types of soils and of burial techniques. Much has been learned
scientifically and technically of the proper procedures for disposing of

solid wastes with maximum safety in various situations.

As the nuclear industry developed, certain AEC installations, which
had established facilities for the burial of their own wastes, made their
burial grounds available for the disposal of solid wastes from industrial

users of radioisotopes and from other AEC installations.

In 1960 the AEC announced that regional sites for the permanent dis-
posal of solid low-level packaged radioactive wastes would be established
on land owned by the state or federal government, and sites were desig-
nated for this purpose at ORNL and at NRTS. The AEC continued to furnish
this service until 1963, when commercial service became available at two
locations (Beatty, Nevada, and Morehead, Kentucky) from one company. In
late 1969, service was available from two companies operating burial
grounds at five sites (Fig. 4.10). On-site burial facilities are main-
tained by the AEC at Oak Ridge National Laboratory, the Savannah River
Plant, the National Reactor Test Station (Idaho), Hanford, and los Alamos
Scientific Laboratory.

Transportation of waste to the burial site may be accomplished in
any one of three ways: common carriers may haul the waste packages along
with ordinary shipment of freight; contract carriers may handle only
radioactive materials but collect from various sources; and private car-
riers may transport their own wastes from the point of origin to the

disposal area.

In the evaluation of a proposal or an existing operation for land
burial of radioactive wastes, all the conditions that might reduce the
effectiveness of radiation protection must be considered. It is neces-
sary that the applicant or licensee submit information from which the
adequacy of radiation protection can be judged and the site and the entire
operation can be appraised. The Division of Materials Licensing of the
AEC has prepared an outline of licensing requirements for land burial of
radioactive wastes. Essentially the same information as required by the
agreement states, since, in accepting the transfer of materials licensing
functions from the AEC, they have agreed to keep their regulations and
requirements compatible with those of the AEC.

The AEC outline of licensing requirements specifies that an applica-
tion for land burial of radioactive wastes must include information re-
garding: the amount of by-product material, source material, and special
nuclear material to be handled and disposed of; qualifications of the
applicant and members of his staff to engage in the proposed activities,
including specialized training and experience in handling radioactive
materials and dealing with radiation problems; a description of the radi-
ation detection instruments that will be available; the radiation protection
procedures, including emergency procedures, for each phase of the program;
and a description of the site and facilities that will be used for storing,
processing, and disposing of the radioactive wastes. Maps and drawings
of the proposed facilities and a description of the buildings and equip-
ment to be used are essential. The outline refers to the AEC's Rules and
Regulations, which specify that the licensee must comply with the regula-
tions, and that standard operating procedures must be based on the regu-

latory requirements.
L-91

The outline of licensing requirements calls for detailed information
concerning geology, hydrology of the site, groundwater conditions in rela-
tion to burial methods, the use of groundwater and surface water at the
site and in the general area, geochemical characteristics of the soil in
which the burial trenches are excavated, and specific plans for monitor-
ing of soils and water by methods that are related to techniques used in
the geologic and hydrologic evaluation of the site and its environs. In
their transportation of radioactive materials, waste disposal licensees
must adhere to applicable regulations of the Interstate Commerce Commission
and other federal agencies having jurisdiction. It is understood that
licensees will be subject to state and local regulations regarding highway
safety, handling of radiation emergencies, and other problems that may be

involved.

In judging the acceptability for licensing of a proposed facility for
waste burial, the primary considerations are radiological health and safety.
Thus the quantities of radionuclides and the extent of their dispersion to
the environment must be evaluated, and the acceptability of the potential
radiation exposures that may result must be determined. Evaluation studies
of proposed waste burial sites are necessary as a basis for these judgments.
These studies must develop information that is sufficiently accurate and
complete to enable the licensing officials to decide whether or not the

proposed site is acceptable from the standpoints of health and safety.

Burial grounds must be located on federally or state owned land, and
are regulated by either the AEC or, in the case of agreement states, by
the appropriate state agency. In practice, the administrative control over
those waste disposal operations must be a coordinated responsibility of
federal, state, and local agencies. Programs and standards must be com-
patible and technically similar. When the burial site is located on state-
owned land, perpetual maintenance becomes the responsibility of the state.
Funds for this are secured by imposing a burial fee (currently $0.05/ft%)

for the establishment of a maintenance fund.

Pro jected volumes of solid wastes from spent-fuel processing, and
estimates of land requirements for their burial, are given in Table 3.63.

These estimates are based on averages of 200 £t° of solid waste produced
4-92

per metric ton of fuel processed (NFS experience) and 50,000 ft° of solid
waste buried per acre of land. Actually, these "averages!" may be rather
far removed from actual practice at any particular plant at any particular
time, but they are believed to be realistic for purposes of overall projec-
tions. The total land requirements for the spent-fuel reprocessing in-
dustry should increase from about 1 acre/year in 1970 to 6li acres/year in
2000, and the accumulated area of land devoted to this purpose should
increase from about 1 acre in 1970 to 980 acres in 2000. Is is of interest
to note that this is only about one-half of the projected salt mine area
requirements for disposing of high-level solidified wastes (Table 3.60).

4.5.2 Disposal in Salt Mines

 

The disposal of high-level solidified wastes in natural salt forma-
tions has been discussed previously (see Sect. .4.1). The large amount
of existing space in salt mines represents a very attractive possibility
for the disposal of the other types of solid wastes from fuel reprocessing.
More than 40,000,000 ft? of mined-out area exists in nonproducing mines
in bedded salt. This area, approximately 915 acres, could contain all the
solid wastes projected through the year 2020. Table 1.13 gives projected
mine space requirements for the disposal of these wastes in salt through
the year 2020.

The routine low-level solid waste material, which can be handled
directly by using standard material handling procedures and equipment, may
be stacked on the floor in open rooms. It would probably be desirable to
backfill the remaining space in the rooms with crushed salt. In order to
carry out such an operation, the size and weight of the packages of waste
would have to be limited in such a manner that the packages could be placed
on the mine hoist and handled by the underground equipment. Is is unlikely
that disposal of these solids in salt-producing mines would be acceptable.
However, as the mined areas become larger, it may become feasible to sepa-
rate older areas by bulkheads and carry on waste disposal operations through
separate shafts. Both ventilation and access would have to be entirely

separate for each area.

Cladding hulls (Zircaloy or stainless steel) resulting from the chop-
leach dissolution of fuel present a radiation problem which approaches that
of high-level wastes (see Sect. 3.3). The volume, after compaction, will
range from 2 to 10 ft%/ton, and the hulls will require several inches of
lead shielding for shipment. The radioactivity of stainless hulls is due
principally to 5.2-year °°Co, which will not decay significantly before
disposal is desirable. The radioactivity of Zircaloy hulls is due to 65-
day 9%Zr, which will essentially be decayed in two years; however, the
8000 radioactivity induced in Inconel spacers presents a shielding problem.
Although it will be necessary to handle the stainless steel hulls in the
same way that high-level wastes are handled due to the high radiation fields
present, very little heat would be generated. Thus, the hulls could be
placed in holes drilled in the space between those holes containing solidi-
fied fuel reprocessing wastes. On the other hand, the less radioactive
Zircaloy hulls, if allowed to decay for two years, could probably be han-
dled in drums using semiremote techniques, provided the Inconel spacers
were separated and handled separately. It is important to recognize that,

in addition to induced radioactivity, several hundredths to 0.1% of the
L-9L

plutonium in the spent fuels is associated with the cladding, presumably

as a result of diffusion while in the reactor.

Concentrates obtained from the treatment of low- and intermediate~

level liquid wastes and other materials (see Sect. L.L.1) constitute

another source of solid waste that could be deposited in salt mines. The

radiation levels of these concentrates would be sufficiently high to re-

quire remote handling and disposal procedures similar to those considered
for cladding hulls.

5S. TRANSPORTATION CONSIDERATIONS

The siting of a fuel reprocessing plant can be influenced by the
factors involved in transporting radioactive material to and from the
plant. The plant feed material will consist of spent fuel elements,
while the plant discharges will consist of fissile product materials and

conditioned waste effluents.

The designs of the three types of shipping containers (spent fuel,
product, and waste) are different, reflecting the differences in radio-
activity, thermal power, critical mass, etc., of the material being car-
ried. All shipments, however, must conform to the shipping regulations

specified by the AEC and the Department of Transportation (por). 2?

The distances traversed by the incoming and outgoing shipments will
vary with the site location. If the total cost of transporting each of
the three materials per vehicle mile were known, the minimum cost could
be obtained, based on given boundary conditions. However, the total cost
of transporting each of the three materials is made up not only of direct
transport, insurance, handling, and capital equipment costs, but also of
costs associated with the accident potential per vehicle mile for that
type of shipment. Reasonable estimates of the former costs can be made.
Difficulty arises when we attempt to assign costs associated with acci-
dents, since it is conceivable that such costs could make up a large frac-

tion of the total cost of transportation.

Costs associated with potential accidents, Cys can be written as the
product of three terms: Ps Ps and Cov Here, P, is the probability of

an accident, P, is the probability of a hazard occurring as a result of

h
the accident (either a release of activity or an increased dose rate from

the cask), and Ce. is the cost of protecting people from the hazard, which
includes protection of a given area and, if necessary, restoration of the
area to its original state. Some information on the magnitude of P is

available, both for truck and rail shipments. The accident rate of motor

carriers, typical of those that might transport radioactive materials, has

3,4

been estimated at 3.626 per million vehicle miles. Freight trains have

5

a slightly lower accident frequency, approximately 2.85 per million miles.

3,kL,6

Fire has been estimated to occur in from 1 to 3% of the accidents.
5-2

In evaluating the results of accidents, we estimate that only 5 to
10% of them are severe enough to cause what might be classed as permanent
damage to a shipping container. It seems reasonable to assume that spent
fuel, waste, and product shipments will be subject to the same accident

rate per million vehicle miles. However, the product of P, and Cos which

h
is the dollar loss resulting from the accident, could vary widely, depend-

ing on the type of shipment that is involved in the accident.

The potential dollar loss would depend on the container design; more
specifically, in the case of spent fuel shipments, it would be affected
by the history of the fuel being carried, the final form of the fuel
(i.e., whether or not it was encapsulated), the type of primary coolant
used, etc. Similar considerations would affect the waste and product

shipments.

The regulations require that all packages used in transporting radio-
active and/or fissile material be able to withstand specific accident con-
ditions without releasing greater than a specified amount of radioactive
material or increasing the external dose rate more than a specified amount.
The accident sequence that these packages must withstand, as specified in
the regulations, includes a 30-ft free fall (impact velocity = 30 mph)
onto a solid, unyielding surface, followed by a [O-in. drop onto a 6-in.-
diam piston. This is to be followed, successively, by exposure for 30 min

to a 1475°F fire and submergence in water for 2 hr.

It 1s generally understood that accident velocities greater than 30
mph and fire temperatures higher than 1475°F do actually occur. However,
the impact surface is never truly unyielding; nor is it likely that the
cask will be placed in such a manner that the maximum heat input is re-
ceived by all its surfaces. The regulations, therefore, offer a reasonable
chance of proving, by mathematical analysis, that a package will meet the
requirements (and because of normal engineering conservatism, exceed them)
without forbidding the movement of radioactive materials. This is a reason-
ably practical solution to the problem of protecting the public, even
though it is recognized there is still the finite, although very small,

probability that an accident could cause a large monetary loss.
5-3

In recent years, the problems raised by the prospect of an increasing
number of large radioactive shipments have received serious attention by
the AEC and by engineers involved in container design and fabrication.
One outgrowth of this emphasis was the publication of a comprehensive Guide
on cask design.’ Areas in which the greatest potential problems occur,
and the manner in which they affect the design, are described in the follow-

ing sections.

5.1 Cask Requirements and Design Considerations

Of the applicable AEC and DOT regulations governing shipments of fuel,
waste, and fissile material, those having the greatest effect on cask
design, and consequently on shipping economy, pertain to the release of
radionuclides and the reduction of shield-accident conditions as described
in 10 CFR 71. Whereas consideration of criticality must be given to all
shipments of fissile material, the use of fixed poisons and proper geomet-

rical spacing provide sufficient safeguards in most cases.

5.1.1 Release of Radionuclides

 

The maximum amount of radionuclides that can be released within the
regulations is: (1) 0.1% of the total radioactivity of the package, or
(2) 0.01 Ci of Group I, 0.5 Ci of Group II, and 10 Ci of Groups III and IV
radionuclides, except that inert gases are limited to a release of 1000 ci.”
The release of radionuclides from the cask is most likely to occur as the

result of impact or of involvement in a fire.

An acceptable container design must provide two lines of containment
to restrict the movement of the contained radioactive materials. The outer-
most line is generally the container closure-and-seal, which is designed
to remain intact under the hypothetical accident conditions. Recent re-
search has indicated that such closures can be designed to withstand the

30-ft free fall, primarily by protecting the area surrounding the closure

* Almost all radionuclides have been categorized in the regulations as
to their relative hazard and are listed by groups. (See ref. 1 or 2.)
5-4

from localized, concentrated impact loads. Frequently, heat-transfer
fins can be expected to offer the required impact protection. The inner
line of containment may take several forms, depending on the material
shipped. The unruptured cladding on a spent thermal reactor fuel element
may be an adequate barrier; ruptured and fast reactor fuel elements may
require separate capsules. Additional work is required to make a quanti-

tative evaluation of the effect of encapsulating individual fuel elements.

If a cask that has been designed for water coolant is involved in a
fire, it is unlikely that the outer cask seal can be maintained. Gener-
ally, such a cask contains a pressure relief valve. Once this valve is
actuated, it is extremely difficult to reseat; therefore, we must postulate
that all the coolant will be lost in a fire. If the radioactive material
in the cask is encapsulated, this inner line of containment will probably
prevent the release of any radionuclides to the environment. In summary,
it appears likely that, based on current design technology, the specifica-
tions regarding limits for the release of radionuclides can be met for all
types of casks carrying fuel, fissile material, or waste, even if the casks
are involved in the postulated 30-ft drop, followed by the puncture and

30-min fire.

5.1.2 Increased Dose Rate

Of the casks considered, the lead-shielded type would probably be the
most vulnerable with regard to loss of shielding, if it were involved in
the accident sequence mentioned above. Lead can move under impact condi-
tions; it has a low melting point and a high coefficient of expansion that
could lead to rearrangement of the metal and a subsequent loss of shield-
ing from important areas after melting. This is not to say that lead-
shielded casks cannot be designed to meet regulations; however, the design
may necessarily be somewhat complex, thereby resulting in higher capital
costs. Although impact and fire could create excessive stresses in steel
and uranium casks, the potential loss of these shielding materials is less

than that for lead exposed to the same environment.
5-5

5.1.3 Temperature Limits

The DOT regulations do not place specific temperature limits on the
cask shield or on the material being transported; however, the tempera-
ture of the accessible surface of the package (which may be a personnel
shield) is limited to 122°F (or to 180°F if the cask is shipped "exclusive
use of the vehicle"). In addition, the temperature of the lead in a lead-
shielded cask should be limited to }OO°F or less as a practical matter
(the melting point of lead is 621°F). Even at LOO°F, thermal cycling,
thermal shock, and lead expansion during the operating cycle must be con-

sidered in the cask design.

As far as the regulations are concerned, the fuel or waste can melt
as long as the material does not achieve criticality or escape from the
cask. As a practical matter, the temperature of the transported material
should be restricted as necessary to avoid any phase changes which could
facilitate the escape of radionuclides to the primary coolant, even under
the hypothetical accident conditions. The temperatures attained by fuel
elements are affected primarily by fuel burnup, specific power, decay time,
fuel element design, and the number of fuel elements carried per shipment.
In the case of waste, the temperature attained is affected by the thermal
conductivity and the isotopic power density of the waste, and by the diame-
ter of the waste containers. Temperatures may be controlled by varying
the cooling time (both of fuel or waste) or the cask design. Both of these
variables affect economic considerations. That is, as the cooling time
increases, the inventory and inventory charges increase, and as cask designs

become smaller, the unit shipping costs increase.

5.1.4 Contamination of the Primary Coolant

 

The primary coolant is defined as the gas, liquid, and/or solid that
is used to remove decay heat from the radioactive material or its container.
Under normal operating conditions, contamination of the primary coolant
is limited, per milliliter, to 1077 Ci of Group I radionuclides, 5x 1078
Ci of Group II radionuclides, and 3 x 107% Ci of Groups III and IV radionu-
clides. In addition, in a hypothetical accident, release cannot exceed

either (1) 0.1% of the total radioactivity of the contents of the package
5-6

or (2) 0.01 Ci of Group I, 0.5 Ci of Group II, and 10 Ci of Groups III
and IV and radionuclides, except in the case of chemically inert gases.
In the latter instance, the limit is 1000 Ci. These specifications can
be met, with varying degrees of difficulty, depending on the form and
type of material being shipped.

5.1.5 Emission of Neutrons from Spent Fuels and Wastes

 

Calculations indicate that the quantities of actinide isotopes pres-
ent in highly irradiated reactor fuels will be sufficient to require these
fuels and the solidified wastes arising from such fuels to be provided
with neutron shielding during shipment. The neutrons are produced by spon-
taneous fission of ®**Cm and **“Cm, and from (a, n) reactions with the
oxygen in the fuel and wastes. Present design estimates indicate that
shields of hydrogenous material equivalent to 3 to 6 in. of H,0 will be
required in addition to the gamma shield. Neutron shielding can be added
either inside or outside the gamma shield. In either case, the dimensions
and weight of the cask will be increased; this increase will, in turn,

affect both the shipping cost and the cask optimization.

5.2 Shipments of Spent Fuel and Waste

Shipments of spent fuel and waste are discussed simultaneously since
the heavy, shielded containers used in both cases are similar. It has
been assumed, based on experience, that all types of spent fuel shipping
casks can be designed to meet the requirements discussed in Sect. 5.1.
Ruptured spent fuel elements should be encapsulated prior to shipment.

Fast reactor fuel may be encapsulated with sodium as a heat-transfer agent.
Containment may be lost due to relative deflections of the lid and cask
body resulting from a 30-ft impact. However, a canister and closure can

be designed in such a manner that containment is maintained even under acci-
dent conditions. Tests have shown that shock-absorbing members can dissi-
pate considerable energy and distribute the impact load to the extent that

seals may be maintained.

Lead-shielded casks can absorb large amounts of impact energy when

the lead is deformed; this shielding material is relatively inexpensive and
5-17

simple to machine and fabricate. Steel and uranium casks, while being
more resistant to fires and impact, have a potential to impart higher g
loadings to their contents, which would increase the likelihood of fuel
damage and fission-product leakage to the cask coolant. Impact tests
with a finned uranium cask have shown that internal g loadings can be
reduced to reasonable levels if the fins are designed to act as shock

absorbers as well as heat dissipators.

The loss of primary coolant, particularly water, is very difficult
to prevent when a cask is involved in an accident. Most water-cooled
casks will probably be designed with pressure relief valves to limit
the internal pressure in the event of fire. The problem becomes one of
guaranteeing that only a limited quantity of fission products will be
released from the fuel (or capsule) through the relief valve or damaged
closure seal following an accident. The quantities of fission products
lost will depend upon fuel burnup, radiation damage, cooling time, fuel
element design, and other factors. Little information is available on

which to base predictions concerning a release under such circumstances.

Criticality generally presents no severe restrictions in the ship-
ment of spent reactor fuel. It is important, however, that the effective
neutron multiplication factor be maintained well below 1.0 to limit the
neutron source from subcritical neutron multiplication. Experience and
calculations indicate that relatively large arrays of reactor fuels of
principal interest can be maintained appropriately subcritical through

the use of fixed neutron absorbers and judicious spacing of the elements.

5.2.1 Effects of Source Design on the Design of Spent Fuel Casks

 

Fast Reactors. — The fuel elements to be used in fast reactors are
designed to be about 17 ft long and most of the heat is produced in the
center third of the elements. Because of the high plutonium inventory,
there is a strong economic incentive to ship the spent fuel to reprocess-
ing plants after cooling times of only 30 days or less. For shipments
of 7 to 2 tons of fuel, the high heat output of the fuel at these early
decay times precludes the use of lead-shielded casks, since the operating

temperature of the shield material under the loss-of-coolant condition is
5-8

above the melting point of lead. In order to ship 18 elements per cask,
a steel cask of approximately 120 tons will be required,’ and the mode

of shipment will be limited to rail.

Because of heat-transfer problems, this fuel may require a sodium
coolant, which implies that each element must be separately encapsulated
in sodium (constituting a "special form" as defined in the regulations).
Such control over this fuel may make the problems of contamination and
potential leakage less severe than they are for thermal reactor fuels,

although the transfer of heat becomes somewhat more difficult.

Thermal Reactor Fuel. — The length of elements to be used in thermal

 

reactors approaches that of fast reactor elements. The cooling time of
the fuel at the time of shipment is usually about 120 days after discharge
from the reactor; thus, heat dissipation is not as severe as for fast
reactor elements. Depending upon the dimensions of the fuel elements and
the number of elements to be carried per cask, shipments can be made by
truck or rail. Truck shipments are generally limited to 20- to 25-ton
casks. For truck shipments, uranium may be an attractive shield material
since the cavity can be made larger than for a lead or steel cask of the
same weight. A 65-ton cask designed for shipping 3 to 5 tons of LWR fuels

has recently been proposed. ©

Assuming that the fuel elements are initially intact, heat transfer
is such that the fuel will not be expected to undergo excessive distortion
and fission-product release when air is used as the primary coolant. Fuel
elements that are known to be leaking can be encapsulated, but it is almost
impossible to predict potential leakage resulting from cladding failure

during transit.

5.2.2 Shipment of Wastes

The shipment of wastes will be governed by the Code of Federal Regula-
tions, Title 10, Part 71, which has been discussed above. The shipping
of high-level liquid wastes is generally considered to be too hazardous
because of the possibility of radiolytic gas explosions or excessive steam
pressurization in the event of a fire. Consequently, only solid waste

shipments are discussed.
5-9

Processed waste will be in the form of a calcined oxide or glass,
encased in a 6-, 12-, or 2i-in.-diam steel pipe with a welded closure.
A reprocessor can exercise considerably more control over the solid
wastes leaving his plant than he can over the spent fuel entering it.
Cooling times of the waste containers are more easily varied without in-

curring the same degree of economic penalties as for spent fuel.

The waste product will be doubly contained, first in its welded-
steel can and then in the shipping cask itself. The calcined or glass
waste product is relatively immobile; although the 30-ft impact accident
condition could create some fracturing in the product, it would be of

little consequence.

The 1L75°F fire accident condition could increase the center-line
temperature of calcined wastes; however, the consequences of this thermal
transient do not appear to be severe. The increases in pressure would be
small, certainly within the resistance capabilities of the steel pot whose
maximum temperature increase in the hypothetical fire will be in the range
of 10 to 300°F.

In short, the degree of control available over shipments of waste
and the fact that the fission products are in a nondispersible form argue
that such shipments should be quite safe. In fact, these shipments should
be more acceptable, from the standpoint of interstate travel, than incoming

spent-fuel shipments.

5.3 Shipment of Product Material

Considerable experience has been accumulated in the shipment of fis-
sile material both in liquid and in solid form. Shipments are made in a
birdcage-type package, often a 55-gal drum in which a central cavity is
held in place by metal, wood, or other support. Because the product is
free from most fission products, little or no shielding is required; and,
because only negligible quantities of heat are evolved from the material
and virtually no radiolytic gases are generated, substantial insulation
can be used to protect the material from external fires. For this reason,

shipments of liquids as well as solids are feasible.
5-10

The significant problem in such shipments is one of maintaining
subcriticality under all conditions. One container designed at Rocky
Flats will permit the shipment of 100 packages, each containing 100
liters of plutonium nitrate at concentrations up to 250 g/liter.
Similar containers designed at Rocky Flats were tested in a vehicle that
impacted into an unyielding barrier at LI mph, All these containers ”
maintained their drum covers, and no damage to the inner containment

vessel was noted. pe

In summary, it appears that container designs which will exceed the

requirements as noted in the regulations are available. Potential damage >
resulting from severe accidents may be expected to be minimal and thus :
not affect the siting of the reprocessing plant. -

5. Conclusions

Based on the information and arguments presented above, the most
significant potential shipping problem appears to be associated with the
transport of spent fuel elements to the reprocessing site. The problems
associated with the transport of waste or product material are considered

to be less severe.

Although there is little doubt that casks can be designed to meet
existing regulations, the degree of complexity and the expense involved

depend largely on the characteristics of the fuel being transported.

Since there is insufficient information to allow a quantitative
assessment of the safety actually achieved by such additional precautions
as encapsulation of the fuel, exclusive use of the vehicle, etc., it is
difficult to determine whether or not these precautions are economically
justified. In our opinion, spent fuel shipping casks designed by today's
standards need not be significantly more hazardous than shipments of
waste or product material; therefore shipping hazards, taken by themselves, .

need not markedly affect plant siting.

6. ECONOMIC CONSIDERATIONS
6.1 Reprocessing Costs

Chemical reprocessing plants are generally thought of as being
expensive, although this reputation is largely undeserved in the overall
context of a large, growing nuclear power economy. One 1000-Mw (elec-
trical) light-water reactor (IWR) requires a refueling rate of about
27 metric tons/year (based on a burnup of 33,000 Mwd/metric ton, 80%
load factor, 32.5% thermal efficiency). The proposed Allied Chemical
reprocessing plant is expected to handle a nominal 5 metric tons of IWR
fuel per day at an announced capital cost of about $70 million, If this
plant operates at its nominal production rate of 1500 metric tons/year,
it can service a nuclear economy of approximately fifty-five 1000-Mw
(electrical) ILWR's costing on the order of $180 million each. Based on
the annual fixed charge rates used in the AEC Systems Analysis Task Force
(SATF) and AEC Fuel Recycle Task Force (FRTF) studies (13.5% on reactor
capital and 24.0% on reprocessing plant capital), the respective capital
contributions to total power cost would be about 3.5 mills/kwhr for
reactor capital and 0.05 mill/kwhr for reprocessing plant capital. Oper-
ating costs of the reprocessing plant add another 0.02 mill/kwhr. Thus,
the total contribution of chemical reprocessing to nuclear power cost is

comparatively small.

In the near term, of course, fuel reprocessing will be somewhat more
expensive, since the reprocessing economy is starting up with smaller
plants than the proposed Allied plant and since each plant will be oper-
ated initially at less than full load. The Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc.
(NFS) and the General Electric Company (GE) plants have a nominal l-metric
ton/day capacity each, although the two may provide a combined "stretch"
capacity of 5 metric tons/day (more in NFS than GE). The near-term NFS
base reprocessing charge for 20,000-Mwd/metric ton IWR fuel is $31.3/kg
(plus escalation), which corresponds to about 0,20 mill/kwhr (electrical).
The NFS price would have to be significantly higher if the cost of capital

for NFS were more typical of chemical plants, or if there were no AEC
6-2

"pase load." ORNL studies for the FRTF have projected a decrease, by
1985-1990, in IWR reprocessing costs to 0.10 mill/kwhr (electrical) (in
terms of 1967 dollars), based on a burnup of 20,000 Mwd/metric ton. t

6.1.1 Economies of Scale

Two studies?’ of reprocessing plant costs made by du Pont during
the 1961-6l period indicated a base project cost of $58 to 70 million,
depending on maintenance philosophy and fuel type, for a 9,07-metric ton/day
plant. The reference $58 million plant was estimated to have annual oper-
ating costs of $6.2 million. A smaller version of the reference plant, w
having a 0.907-metric ton/day capacity, was estimated to cost $43 million,
with annual operating costs of $3.7 million. These estimates did not we
include land, startup, working capital, or ultimate waste disposal, but
did include interim waste storage. The estimates can be characterized
by their low cost-scaling factors of about 0.15 for capital cost and
about 0.22 for operating cost; that is:

Capital cost =~ ($60.0 x 109) (netrio tons/day, 0.145

($43.6 x 10%) (metric tons/day) 0+ 145 (6.1) "

i

Annual operating cost ~ ($6.23 x 10°) (Berle tons/day 0.22,

($3.80 x 10°) (metric tons/day)C: 22k (6.2)

u

More normal cost-scaling factors for the chemical industry are in the
range of 0.6 to 0.7; however, the factors may increase to 0.8 to 1.0 for
scale-up (based on multiple units), or may decrease to 0.3 to 0.5 for .
processes involving extremes of temperature and pressure, By analogy,
the extremes of radiation involved in reprocessing may be considered to
be responsible for the extremely low scaling factors indicated by the
du Pont studies.

The reported NFS capital cost (in 196), for a nominal l-metric
ton/day plant, was about $32 million,” including land, startup, working
capital, and interim waste storage. The reported cost estimate for the

GE l-metric ton/day plant is only $17.L million;” however, this figure
6-3

does not include all the items that make up the NFS cost. The French (in
196L and 1965) estimated a cost of $29 million for a l-metric ton/day

plant,’

but did not supply a sufficiently definitive breakdown to indi-
cate how all-inclusive this cost may be. Thus, there is some doubt about
the actual cost of a l-metric ton/day reprocessing plant, although the
differences between the du Pont, NFS, and GE plants can probably be
explained on the basis of different design philosophies (maintenance
methods, on-stream time requirements, ease of capacity expansion, etc.)
and on the basis of what items are included in the quoted figure.

There is also some difference of opinion about scaling factors. The

French have used costs in their evaluation studies,’ equivalent to the
following scaling laws, for plants with capacities at least as high as

26 metric tons/day:
Capital cost =~ ($29 x 10%) (metric tons/day) ° (6.3)

Annual operating cost = ($1.45 x 10°) (metric tons/day) © 3

($0.36 x 10°) (metric tons /day)C-l

($0.38 x 10°) (metric tons/day)

($2.2 x 10%) (metric tons/day) 0+ 5H (6.4)

+4

+

u

These equations give a capital cost of $29 million and an annual operating
cost of $2.2 million for a l-metric ton/day plant. At a capacity of 9.07
metric tons/day, they give a capital cost of $70 million and an annual
operating cost of $7.1 million. The French estimates are lower than those
of NFS for a l-metric ton/day plant (we estimate the NFS annual operating
cost to be $2.5 to 3.0 million) and higher than those of du Pont for a
9.07-metric ton/day plant. The scaling factors used by the French are
more than twice those used by du Pont. The reason for this is not known,
Using the French factors to extrapolate to a 1lO-metric ton/day plant

would be more conservative (i.e., it would give higher costs).

For FRTIF studies, the following estimates, based on NFS estimates at
1 metric ton/day and du Pont estimates at 9.07 metric tons/day, were used

to make cost projections:

These costs yield scaling factors of 0.35 and 0.42 for capital cost and
operating cost respectively. We separated the operating cost into two
portions, with the larger part being proportional to plant capital cost
and the smaller part being proportional to plant throughput. To obtain
1970 costs, we multiplied by a factor of 1,3, which will account approxi-
mately for the increases in building and labor costs that have occurred
since the FRTF estimates were made. The resulting cost equations, in

1970 dollars, are as follows:

6.1.2 Unit Reprocessing Costs

Table 6.2 presents estimates of the unit cost of reprocessing LWR-U
and IMFBR-oxide fuels in fully loaded single-purpose plants having capac-
ities of 1, 6, and 36 metric tons/day. Capital charges were based on the
FRTF annual fixed charge rate of 24%, which was, in turn, based on the

following assumptions:

Plant lifetime = 15 years
Capital investment in bonds = 30%
Capital investment in equity = 70%
Interest rate on bonds = 5%

Rate of return on equity (after taxes) = 16%
Federal income tax rate = 50%
State income tax rate = 3%
Local property tax rate = 3.2%
Annual cost of replacements = 0.35%
Annual property insurance rate = 0.25%

By 1970 standards, the 5% bond interest rate given above appears
low, Increasing it to 8% would increase the fixed charge rate to about
26%, and the reprocessing costs in Table 6.2 would be increased accord-
ingly. Interest on construction funds would also be higher under 1970
conditions. It is not clear, of course, that the currently high interest

rates will prevail indefinitely.

In the FRTF studies, the annual operating costs for a plant were
calculated for each year during the buildup of the load to nominal
capacity. On the average, levelized unit costs in the as-loaded plants
were about 20% higher than would have been calculated for fully loaded
plants, The operating costs in Table 6.2 are based on Eq. (6.6), and
are based on operation of the plants at full capacity for 260 days per

year,

6.1.3 Optimization Studies

Reprocessing cost estimates for the main-line FRTF-SATF effort were
based on a "marketplace!" model of the reprocessing economy. This intui-
tive, somewhat arbitrary, model required that the reprocessing capacity
in a given year always be at least equal to the reactor discharge schedule
for that year; that is, '"backlogging" of spent fuel to postpone capital
expenditures and allow operation nearer the fully loaded condition was
not permitted. It was required that three plants approximately equivalent
to the NFS, GE, and Allied Chemical plants be on-stream by 1974 and that
the total number of plants in operation (not including those which "died"
after their nominal 15-year life) increase approximately linearly with
time at the rate of about one every five years. The location of the

plants was not considered.

A simplified linear-growth-rate model used at ORNL provides some
insight into the problem of optimization of sizing and timing for the
more general case of backlogging fuel before the startup of a reprocessing
plant sufficiently large to handle an increasing spent-fuel load for

logged for y years, incurring storage and inventory costs, at which time
a plant of capacity mx comes on-stream. The cycle is repetitive, with
plants of mx coming on-stream every x years starting at y. The total
pregsent-worth-levelized processing cost, including fuel inventory costs,

per unit amount of fuel for this model is given by the following equation:

where

constant unit price assumed for sale of recovered fuel.

Table 6.3 shows the results of a typical calculation. It is based
on IWR fuel value and processing-cost estimates, a growth rate of 300
metric tons/ (year)? (predicted for the 1970's in the United States), and
a discount rate of 12%/year (applicable to common ownership of the fuel,
the backlogging facility, and the reprocessing plant by a private corpor-
ation with a "medium" cost of money). The growth rate is roughly equiva-
lent to 1.0 metric ton per day per year, so that, in this case, x is equal
to the processing plant capacity in metric tons/day. In this linear-growth-
rate model, the value of y cannot exceed 0.5x. The cost drops from about
$L,0/kg in a 1.0-metric ton/day plant (relatively independent of backlogging
time) to less than one-half of this figure in a 5.0-metric ton/day plant
(still relatively insensitive to backlogging time in this case) and to a
little more than one-third of the l-metric ton/day cost at the optimal
conditions of y = 1.7 to 1.8 years and x = 17 to 18 years (i.e., a 17-
to 18-metric ton/day plant). The optimum is quite "flat;" for example,
a 10,0-metric ton/day plant with 1.0-year backlogging gives a levelized
unit cost that is only 6% higher than the minimum, and might be preferable

from the risk point of view. The location of the plant is not optimized.

The assumed cost-scaling equations, particularly the scaling factors
(exponents), and the interest rate play an important part in the optimiza-

tion. In general, low scaling factors and low interest rates lead to an

optimal solution, which indicates that plants should be built sufficiently
large to handle the fuel load for many years in the future. An optimiza-
tion study by the French, mentioned previously,’ used an interest rate of
7, a plant life of 15 years, and the following approximate cost-scaling
laws (derived from ref. 7 and escalated by a factor of 1.3):

Capital investment =~ ($37.70 x 10%) (plant capacity, metric tons/day) + %

Annual expenses proportional to investment = ($0.47 x 10%) (metric

tons/day) 0+

Annual expenses proportional to throughput rate = ($0.49 x 10%)
(metric tons/day)
Other annual expenses, primarily labor =~ ($1.89 x 10°) (metric

Their indicated optimal policy was to build two reprocessing plants, one
at a time (of sufficiently large size to handle the projected load for

15 years).? Their model included optimization of location; however, the
indicated optimal policy was to build both plants at the same location, so
that the same result would have been obtained without considering the

location,

The ORNL linear-programming (LP) model (Sect. 6.1.3) of the U.S.
spent-fuel reprocessing economy during the period 1970-2040 has been
carried through to two solutions: one with no limits on reprocessing
plant sizes, and another with "intuitive" limits on plant size imposed
in each year (i.e., the limits increase with time). The method presently
used to correct for nonlinearities in reprocessing costs does not guaran-
tee that the two solutions obtained will represent true global optima
(minimum cost solutions); however, it is thought that these solutions
are probably near-optimal as far as present-worth total cost (of shipping,

inventorying, and reprocessing) is concerned,

The estimated amount of spent fuel to be discharged from nuclear
reactors in each of eight geographical regions of the United States in
each of the 70 years, in the period 1970-20L0, together with intra- and
interregional shipping costs, estimated costs of inventorying spent fuel

prior to processing, and the estimated cost-scaling laws for reprocessing,
6-12

was supplied as imput to the IBM-360-75 "MPS!" LP code. This code decides
to what extent fuel should be backlogged before a reprocessing plant is

built. It also determines the desired locations and sizes of such plants.

Table 6.4 gives the solutions obtained for the problem with and
without limits on individual reprocessing plant sizes. The present-worth-
averaged cost over the 70 years of shipping, backlogging, and reprocessing
for the no-limits case was about $14.30/kg; only nine plants were built
during the entire period, When arbitrary, "intuitive," plant size limits
were imposed (starting at 2 metric tons/day for plants coming on-stream
in 1970, and increasing to 5 metric tons/day by 197, 10 metric tons/day
by 1980, and 40 metric tons/day after 2010), the present-worth-levelized

cost increased to about $18.2/kg, and the number of plants built increased

to L9.

Essentially the same problem was solved using another code, FUELCO,
that has been developed at ORNL, The FUELCO solution indicated more,
smaller plants (a total of 52), and gave a present-worth-averaged reproc-
essing cost of $14.95/kg, which would have to be adjusted to approximately
$19.50/kg for comparison with the optimized LP results (i.e., by adding
$L.55/kg for shipping costs).

The LP results with no limit on plant size are thought to be unreal-
istic because the cost-scaling laws are known to be invalid for the very
large sizes indicated (e.g., 178 metric tons/day); and, also, siting and
other considerations may limit individual plant sizes. However, it is
economically important to determine what limits really are applicable to
this problem on a more accurate basis than "arbitrary" or "intuitive,"
Apparently, the optimal solution to the LP model will be to built plants,
mostly at the upper limit imposed on size, with the code indicating where
and in what year to build, The near-term costs could be significantly
less if one 10-metric ton/day plant, of two S-metric ton/day plants, were
built in the 1973-1975 period.

In this model 1 kg of FBR fuel is assumed to be equivalent to 2 kg
of LWR fuel; therefore, the unit costs given above must be doubled for the
FBR fuel. The "average" costs apply, roughly, to the 1985-1990 period.

*Basis: Spent~fuel discharge schedules based on SATF Phase 2, Case 7, for no-limits
problem, and on Phase 3, Case 40, for the problem with limits. The two schedules are
quite similar to each other and to Phase 3, Case 42, used elsewhere in this report,

Sizes are expressed in "equivalent! metric tons/day, with one metric ton of ¥BR or
thorium fuel assumed to be equivalent to two metric tons of PWR fuel. Backlogging of
spent fuel for one or more years before reprocessing is permitted if it is economically
justified, Reprocessing plant life is assumed to be 15 years, Intra- and interregional
shipping costs, backlogging costs, and reprocessing costs (varying with scale) were
estimated by ORNL. Radioactive waste disposal costs are not included in the optimization,
The Roman numerals in parentheses indicate FPC region designation numbers.

The LP code also indicates in which region (see Fig. 3.2 and Table
6.l) the reprocessing plants should be built; however, the present method
of handling nonlinear costs in the linear program probably distorts the
location results more severely than it does the size and time results.
An improved version of the LP code, using the separable programming method
of handling nonlinearities, is also under current development at ORNL.
It is expected to greatly increase the probability of arriving at a true
minimum-cost solution (as regards sizing, timing, backlogging, and loca-

tion) instead of a "local optimum,
6.2 Fuel Shipping Costs

Shipping costs include container costs, freight charges, handling
costs, and property insurance covering damage to, or loss of, the ship-
ment. Liability insurance is not included since such coverage is normally
provided under the reactor or reprocessing plant policies. Inventory
charges on the fuel during cooling and shipping are not considered part
of the shipping cost under the definition used here, but are taken into

account in determining an optimal cooling and shipping schedule.
Fuel cycles may include shipments of the following commodities:
(1) fresh fuel assemblies to a reactor,
(2) spent fuel assemblies from a reactor,

(3) recovered uranium and plutonium solutions from a reprocessing

plant,
(L) UF, to and from a gaseous diffusion plant, and

(5) various chemicals, used in fuel preparation, to a fuel prepara-

tion plant.

For the purposes of the present study, the only shipments of interest
are (2) and (3) above; thus the discussion will be limited to these two

types.

They are based on making an approximate cask design,

ABC-ICC shipping regulations. Spent fast breeder fuel assemblies

were assumed to be shipped in a fully assembled condition, with each

assembly enclosed in a sealed metal canister filled with either liquid

sodium or some other liquid metal, This follows the concept proposed by
15

GE.

Spent-fuel shipping costs that were estimated for the systems analy-
sis program are shown in Table 6.5. Costs were increased by a factor of
1.3 to account for the escalation since 1967. The ground rules and assump-
tions used in arriving at these costs are listed in Table 6.6. In using
these costs, it should be noted that the shipping costs, in dollars per
kilogram and in mills/kwhr, are affected by the fuel exposure (burnup);

the exposures used in estimating the costs are given in Table 6.5,

The cost of shipping spent IWR fuel is about 0.02 to 0.03 mill/kwhr.
For FBR fuel, cost estimates range from 0.03 to 0.07 mill/kwhr, depending
on the fuel assembly design and operating characteristics. Since the
heat-removal and handling problems involved in shipping FBR fuels have
not been completely resolved, these estimates should be used with caution,
The figures given here are for rail shipment in large casks, and assume
that the cask costs are shared among several reactors of the same type.
A complete discussion of the cost-estimating methodology used in the AEC
systems analysis study is given in the report of the Fuel Recycle Task

mate in either case.

The chemical reprocessing plant is located at a distance of 1000
miles from the reactor site. The shipping cost is given for a

round trip of 2000 miles,
The maximum allowable cask weight is 120 tons, fully loaded.

Shipments of spent fuel are made by rail. All sites have railroad

sidings and facilities for handling 120-ton casks.
Rail freight rates are: full cask, $0.0265/1b; empty cask, $0.0243/1b,

The round-trip time is 20 days for FBR fuel and 16 days for other

types of reactor fuel.

Casks are purchased at a cost of $1.63 per pound of cask weight.
Fixed charges on casks are 15% per year; this includes the recovery

of investment, the return on investment, taxes, and maintenance.

Shipments are designed to comply with CFR Title 10 Part 71 and with
ICC Order 70. The cask is assumed to have the exclusive use of the
vehicle. The maximum dose rate is 10 mr/hr at a distance of 6 ft
from the vehicle, 3s1k

Casks may be shared among reactors of the same type. When casks are
shared, a maximum limit of 80% is placed on the cask utilization

factor (time in use divided by total time).

The cost of property insurance against damage to, or loss of, the

cask and its contents is 0.0005 times the value of the shipment,

It is assumed that it will not be necessary for a courier to accom-

pany the shipment.

Individual canning of fuel assemblies is not required, except in the
case of FBR fuel.

Fuel assemblies are not disassembled before being shipped.

Costs are given in 1970 dollars.

Fig. 6.1. Effect of Distance on Shipping Cost.
6-19

Both the freight cost and the container cost are affected by ship-
ping distance. Rental charges on containers are based on the number of
days in use, which, in turn, depends on the distance. If the containers
are capitalized, the cost per trip is equal to the annual fixed charges
on the container investment divided by the number of trips per year. Other
things being equal, the number of trips that can be made annually is in-
versely proportional to the number of days required per trip. Approximate
estimates of the time required for trips of various distances are as
follows:

 

One-Way Distance Round-Trip Time (days)
(miles) Rail Freight Motor Freight

500 12 6

1000 16 10

1500 20 12

2000 23 1

3000 36 18

These estimates include one day each for loading and unloading.

The data given here and in Sect. 3 can be used to compare the eco-
nomics of various plant location policies. For example, the annual
expenditures for spent-fuel shipping can be compared on the basis of
restricted and unrestricted siting. Using SATF Phase 3, Case 42, and
the year 2000, for example, the annual expenditure based on a shipping
distance of 1000 miles would be approximately as follows:

Type of Fuel metric tons/year $/kg fuel $100 /year
IWR 6100 L.7 29
LMFBR 8500 17.5 9

Total 178

When the costs of shipping recovered enriched uranium and plutonium
solutions are included (see Sect. 6.2.2), the total cost becomes about

$200 million per year. If the average shipping distance is reduced to
6-20

350 miles, the cost decreases to about $135 million (see Fig. 6.1). The
shipping cost penalty associated with the larger distance is thus about
$65 million annually. Inventory charges incurred because of the longer
time in transit must be added to this penalty. Assuming that the average
kilogram of material is worth $250 and that the additional time in transit
is 5 days, the additional inventory charges associated with the longer
shipping distance would be about $6 million per year. These figures give
some indication of the possible magnitude of the cost penalties that might
be associated with restrictive siting practices. Table 6.7 shows total
annual shipping costs (for spent fuel and recovered material), as a function
of time, that were calculated for 1000-mile distances, as well as for the

shorter average distances projected in Table 3,55.

6.2.2 Recovered Fissile and Fertile Materials

Plutonium Nitrate Solutions. - Plutonium that is recovered from spent
nuclear fuels is shipped from the reprocessing plant as plutonium nitrate
solution at a concentration of 250 g of plutonium per liter. The primary
container is a 1l0-liter polyethylene bottle. Each bottle is enclosed in
a 5-in, sched LO stainless steel pipe having a flanged and bolted end; in
turn, this pipe is centered in a steel drum that is about 22 in. in diam-
eter and about 6 ft high. The drum is packed with vermiculite or similar
material. A single motor freight trailer shipment consists of up to 68
bottles, or a total of 170 kg of plutonium. Each package weighs about
LLO 1b,

Shipping costs are estimated as follows:

Distance (miles) Cost ($/kg Pu)
500 19-26
1000 26-39
2500 39-52

The higher costs are based on present-day conditions; the lower ones are
those that might be expected to prevail in the 1980-1990 period.

The plutonium content of the spent fuel from LWR's operating on 2 to
3% enriched uranium is about 0.8%. The plutonium content of spent fuel
from the FBR's considered in this study varies from 6 to 11% of the total
core and blanket. Using these figures, the plutonium shipping costs per

kilogram of total fuel are as follows:

Costs ($/kg fuel) for:

One-Way Distance LWR Fuel FBR Fuel
(miles) _(1970) (1980-1990)
500 0.21 1,20-2.20
1000 0.31 1.50-2.90
2500 0.h2 2.30-4.30

Future material from high-exposure power reactors will have higher
concentrations of 238p,, and may, therefore, have to be shielded with a
moderating material to reduce neutron radiation to acceptable levels,

This will increase the cost of shipment significantly.
6-22

The polyethylene bottles tend to crack after prolonged use. There-

fore, other container materials are being investigated.

Uranyl Nitrate (238y_235y) Solutions. - Recovered uranium that is

 

only slightly enriched and has essentially zero gamma activity can be
shipped as uranyl nitrate solution in tank trucks of about 3000-gal
capacity. This solution must meet the "low specific activity" criterion
specified in CFR Title 10 Part 71. The concentration of uranium in the
solution is typically 320 g/liter and is limited to a maximum of 357
g/liter. The concentration of 235y must not exceed 5%.

Insulated stainless steel tank trailers are used. Freezing in cold

weather must be avoided.

Shipping costs for this method of transport are estimated as follows:

Distance (miles) Cost ($/kg U)
500 0.50-0.80
1000 0.80-1.05
2500 1.70-2.60

The higher costs are based on present-day conditions; the lower ones are
those that might be expected in the 1980-1990 period.

Ganmma-Active Uranyl Nitrate Solutions. - The reprocessing of fuels
from thorium-uranium fuel cycles may require the shipment of 233y solu-
tions containing gamma-active daughters of 232y, ORNL-3943 gives esti-
mated shipping costs ranging from $30 to $50 per kilogram of uranium for
a shipping distance of 500 miles when an escalation factor of 1.l (1966
to 1970) is applied. The cost depends on the 232y concentration and on
the total volume shipped per year. In making these estimates, it was
assumed that the solution was shipped by rail in large lead-shielded
steel casks and that internal compartmentation can be used to prevent

criticality.

6.3 Waste Management Costs

A series of studies was made at ORNL during the period 1961-1965 to
evaluate the economics associated with the treatment and the permanent

disposal of high-level wastes, 1023

Analyses were made of each operation
shown in Fig. 6.2 for a nominal 20,000-Mw (electrical) nuclear power
economy; based on govermment ownership of the facilities, it was estimated
that management via the series of operations consisting of interim liquid
storage, pot calcination, interim solid storage, shipment, and disposal

in salt mines could be accomplished for about 0,017 to 0,020 mill per

kwhr of electricity produced from the original fuel, 2H This was about

the same cost as that estimated for "perpetual! tank storage of the

wastes in liquid form, which is a much more hazardous and less satisfac-

tory method of long-term management,

Recently, these analyses were incorporated in a computer program to
facilitate cost optimization over a wide range of conditions and for
different methods of financing. Costs were escalated to nationally
averaged, early-1970 dollar values based on indexes in Engineering News-

Record and Cost Engineering, and on data from the Bureau of Labor Statis-

 

tics. Using current interest rates and economic models that are represent-
ative of corporate financing, we calculated new estimates of the cost of
high-level radioactive waste management by solidification and disposal in
salt mines, These figures range from 0.03 to 0.05 mill/kwhr ($7650 to
$12,750 per metric ton of fuel irradiated to a burnup of 33,000 Mwd/ton).
Perpetual storage in tanks is estimated to cost about 0.032 mill/kwhr
($8160 per metric ton of fuel irradiated to a burnup of 33,000 Mwd/ton).

6.3.1 Basis and Economic Model

The current calculations are based on a 20,000-Mw (electrical)

11 kwhr of electricity

nuclear economy that, annually, generates 1.753 x 10
and produces 687.5 metric tons of spent fuel irradiated to 33,000 Mwd/ton,
The fuel is assumed to be reprocessed 150 days following its discharge
from the reactor, and the pot calcination facility is sized so that the
waste is solidified at the rate at which it is generated during fuel

reprocessing,

Waste management costs are computed using an economic model based on

the "payout" method described by Salmon,

25,26 This method is basically

a discounted cash flow calculation, which requires that the incomes received

must provide for the recovery of the investment, the desired return on

investment, all cash expenses of the project, and the establishment of an

escrow fund to pay for the waste management operations that remain to be

completed after all income has ceased. The basic features of this model

are as follows:

1.

The bond interest for a given year is equal to the bond interest
rate multiplied by the bond principal outstanding at the beginning

of that particular year.

The return on equity for a given year is equal to the earning
rate on equity multiplied by the equity capital outstanding at
the beginning of that particular year.

The interest on the escrow fund is equal to the interest rate
multiplied by the total amount accumulated in the fund at the
beginning of the year. This interest is then added to the fund
principal.

Incomes and expenses are assumed to occur at the end of each

year; capital expenditures occur at the beginning of the year.

The cash income from sales received at the end of a given year

is divided into six portions:

(a) One portion is used to pay the cash expenses for that year,
including operating charges and taxes (but not including

depreciation).
(b) The second portion is used to pay bond interest.
(¢) The third portion goes to return on equity.
(4) The fourth portion is paid into the escrow fund,

(e) The fifth portion is used to reduce the outstanding bond
principal (the capital in bonds and in equity is paid off
in the same ratio as that in which the debts were originally

established).
6-26

(f) The remainder is used to reduce the outstanding equity

capital.

6. At the end of the income-receiving period, the outstanding in-

vestments both in bonds and in equity are reduced to zero.

7. After all income has ceased, the escrow fund is used to pay any
capital expenditures as well as all operating expenses that have

been incurred.

8. The following items are summed to give the total tax-deductible
expenses during the income-receiving period: bond interest,

payment to the escrow fund, operating expenses, and depreciation.

In these calculations, 30% of the capital investment is financed by
bonds at 8% interest; an after-tax return of 16% is allowed on stockholders’
equity; the straight-line method of depreciation is used; and the federal
income tax rate is L8%. These conditions are equivalent to an effective
“cost of money" of 12.1% and to a fixed-charge rate of 2L%. The escrow
fund draws 5% tax-exempt interest annually.

6.3.2 Perpetual Tank Storage

 

In a previous study, >> the costs of perpetual tank storage were
examined for three representative types of financing: government owner-
ship, private ownership, and a combination of government and private
ownership. The case of government ownership provided only for the
recovery of capital and operating expenses, and for interest on the
investment capital; however, in the case of private ownership, costs
reflected a return on equity, as well as the recovery of capital and
operating expenses, insurance, taxes, and interest. In the third case,
private ownership was assumed during the 20-year period of waste accumu-
lation, after which the government assumed responsibility for perpetual
care of the tank farm.

To provide for perpetual care of the waste after cessation of income,
a permanent, tax-free fund was established by making annual deposits during
the income-accumulation period. The size of this fund was calculated so

that the annual tax-free interest would be sufficient to provide for the
6-27

periodic replacement of tanks, the replacement of other necessary equip-
ment at 30-year intervals, and the annual operating expenses of the
facility. The permanent fund also included a contingency account, equal
to the cost of replacing one tank unexpectedly, transferring its contents,
and filling the defective tank with concrete. No advantage was taken of
the accumulation of interest on this part of the permanent, tax-free fund,

since this account might have to be expended at any time.

The tank farms were designed for storing high-level radioactive
wastes, in both acid and alkaline forms, in tanks similar to those being
used at the Savannah River Plant. The wastes were assumed to be concen-
trated to 100 gal per 104 Mwd (thermal) for storage in acid form, or
600 gal per 10k Mwd (thermal) for storage in alkaline form, Capacities
ranged from 200,000 to 5,000,000 gal. Capital costs were estimated for
each case and then used in computer code TASC0%> to estimate the total
costs for each method of financing as a function of tank size, tank life-
time, and fission product concentration in the waste. Although no attempt
was made to determine the hazards quantitatively, the concept of double
containment of radioactivity was applied throughout; in all instances,
the stipulated philosophy of design and operation emphasized safety over

any potential savings in costs.

We have recalculated the costs of perpetual storage after revising
TASCO to reflect an escalation of 17% in the cost of tanks and 30% in the
cost of equipment. Also, overhead was increased from 50% of the labor
cost to 100%; the government interest rate was set at 5%; and the economic
parameters described in Sect. 6.3.1 were used for private financing.
Results show that, for storage in optimum sized tanks, the initial capi-
tal expenditures vary from $10 million to $13 million, and the annual
operating expenses range from $0.6 million to $1.2 million. The magnitude
of the permanent tax-free fund needed for "perpetual care! ranges from
$19 million to $39 million, and annual payments of from $0.6 million to

$1.2 million are required to establish the permanent fund.

The total costs of perpetual tank storage for acid waste are given
in Fig. 6.3. The total cost, in mills/kwhr of electricity generated, is
plotted against tank capacity for tank lifetimes of 25, 50, and 75 years

for the three types of financing. Minima occur at a tank capacity of

about 1,000,000 gal in all cases. These minima range from 0.0160 to
0.0175 mill/kwhr for Case 1, from 0.0308 to 0.0318 mill/kwhr for Case 2,
and from 0.0318 to 0,0325 mill/kwhr for Case 3. The total costs for alka-
line waste storage were generally higher than the equivalent costs for
acid storage (Fig. 6.L). For alkaline wastes, the optimum tank capacity
was about 2,500,000 gal, and the minimum total costs were from O to 15%

higher than those for acid wastes.

To obtain an indication of the effect of fission product concentration
on costs, a second set of costs was computed, assuming that the wastes are
reduced in volume to one-half those of the original design basis. In this
instance, acid Purex and Thorex wastes are assumed to be stored at 50 gal
per 10k Mwd of fuel exposure, while alkaline Purex and Thorex wastes are
stored at 300 gal per 10M Mwd of exposure. This reduction in volumes
caused a decrease of 15 to 30% in total costs. The optimum capacity for
a tank for storing acid waste remained at about 1,000,000 gal, whereas
the optimum size for alkaline waste storage decreased from about 2,500,000
to 1,500,000 gal.

Comparison with Reported Costs at NFS. - Nuclear Fuel Services, Inc.

 

(NFS), of West Valley, New York, has contractual arrangements with the
state of New York for the management of high-level radioactive wastes

A Under the terms of this
contract, New York State provides a tank farm needed for 15 years' opera-
tion of the plant and is reimbursed by NFS for the capital cost of this

from NFS on a "perpetual! tank-storage basis.

farm as the tank capacity is utilized. In addition, NFS makes payments
into a state-owned "perpetual care" escrow fund, which earns L% annual
interest and matures in 15 years. The total cost of high-level waste
management under this plan has been reported informally to be about $1870
per ton of fuel processed [0.012 mill/kwhr (electrical)]. The exact
details of the financial arrangement are not available, but it is believed
that this reported cost can be reconstructed approximately as discussed

below,

On the basis of processing 225 tons of 20,000 Mwd/ton fuel annually,
and concurrently storing waste under alkaline conditions at a concentra-
tion of LOO gal/ton, NFS will generate about 1,400,000 gal of waste over

a period of 15 years. Tankage is supplied in the form of one 320,000-gal
and two 600,000-gal carbon-steel "working" tanks, and decay heat is removed
from the wastes by allowing them to self-boil., The capital cost of the
farm was estimated at $3.2 million to $4.0 million. Nuclear Fuel Services
repays the state of New York $210,000 annually ($933 per ton of fuel proc-
essed), based on a straightline depreciation of $3.2 million over a period
of 15 years. Nuclear Fuel Services also makes an annual payment of
$211,000 ($938 per ton of fuel) into the "perpetual care" fund. Thus,

the total cost of high-level waste management at NFS, excluding tank-farm
operating costs, interest, and return on the capital investment, is $1871

per ton of fuel processed.

When the ORNL tank-farm design and cost model (computer code TASCO)
was used to estimate the perpetual storage costs for wastes from an instal-
lation of a size similar to that of NFS, a total cost of $3080 per ton of
fuel [0.02 mill/kwhr (electrical)] was obtained. In this case, a plant
processing 225 tons of 20,000-Mwd/ton fuel annually for 15 years was
assumed, Waste generated at the rate of 90,000 gal/year was stored in
three 530,000-gal tanks equipped with submerged coils for heat removal,

The total cost of $3080 per ton of fuel includes: $800 for the escrow
payment; $430 for operation, maintenance, and insurance; $1440 for straight-
line depreciation of the capital investment over 15 years; and $410 for
average interest on the investment, computed at 5% per annum, It appears
that the lower cost reported for NFS waste management is due primarily to
the exclusion of operating costs and interest on the capital, and to the
lower capital costs, which are possibly a reflection of less-expensive

tankage required for storage under self-boiling conditions.

6.3.3 Solidification and Disposal in Salt

 

After escalating the capital and operating costs developed previously
for the various operations shown in Fig, 6.2, we calculated present-valued
costs for interim liquid storage in acid form, pot calcination, interim
solid storage, shipment, and disposal in salt mines as a function of time

(or age of the wastes), using the financing model described in Sect. 6.3.1.
6-32

Interim Liquid Storage. - Figure 6.5 presents the costs, in units of

 

1073 mill/kwhr, for interim liquid storage as a function of storage time,
in years. Interim liquid storage costs are based on the same tank-farm
design and capital and operating costs that were used for perpetual liquid
storage. The wastes were stored at a concentration corresponding to

100 gal per 10,000 Mwd (thermal), and a tank lifetime of 50 years was
assumed. The tank size was optimized for each storage period, and provi-
sions were made for the reuse of tanks when possible. Costs for interim

3 mill/kwhr for storage

liquid storage ranged from 13 x 1073 to 27 x 10”
periods of 1 to 30 years respectively. There is very little difference
in cost between a 20- and a 30-year storage period because the same total

storage capacity is required and none of the tanks can be reused.

Pot Calcination and Shipment. - Figure 6.6 presents pot-calcination

 

and waste-shipment costs as a function of the age of the waste at the time
of calcination and shipment. Costs were calculated for calcination in 6-,
12-, and 24-in,-diam cylinders for every case in which the center-line
temperatures of the cylinders were permitted to remain at less than 1650°F
when the cylinders were standing in air, The volume of calcined solids
was taken to be 1 £t> per 10,000 Mwd (thermal) of fuel irradiation. Cal-
cination costs were computed after the costs from the earlier study’ had
been escalated as follows: permanent facilities, 50%; calcination pots,
30%; labor, increased to $10,000 per man-year; overhead, assumed to be
100% of the labor costs. The calculated costs ranged from 16.5 x 1073
mill/kwhr, for the calcination of l-year-old wastes in 6-in,-diam pots,

to 1.8 x 1073 mill/kwhr for the calcination of 30-year-old wastes in 2l-
in, -diam pots. Costs for 1000-mile shipment of the pots in lead-shielded
casks weighing 50 to 90 tons, without forced convection cooling enroute,
ranged from 2.3 x 1073 mill /kwhr for shipment two years after fuel reproc-
essing to less than 1 x 1073 mill/kwhr for shipment LO or more years later,
In arriving at these estimates, freight costs were escalated by 20% over
those previously used; ’ the purchase price of the casks was based on
$1.25 per pound of weight; labor costs were increased to $100 per man-day,
including overhead; the cost of the loading crane was escalated to $1200
per ton; and a period of 1 days was allowed for a 2000-mile round-trip

shipment.

Interim Solid Storage. - Present-valued costs for interim solid

 

storage of the calcined wastes in water-filled canals are presented as

a function of the age of the waste (specifically, interim liquid storage
time) for 1, 3, 10, and 30 years of storage (Fig. 6.7). The costs range
from 16 x 107° mill/kwhr (obtained by extrapolation) for 30-year storage

of l-year-old waste in 6-in,-diam pots, to 0.5 x 1073 mill/kwhr for l-year
storage of 30-year-old waste in 6-, 12-, or 2L4-in,-diam pots. For these
calculations, the costs that were escalated over those used in the previous
study Ld are: excavation, $5/yd>; concrete in place, $120/y4d°; epoxy lining,
$1.50/£t°; aluminum partitions, $10/£4°; 5-ton crane, $7000; track, $37/ft;
demineralizer system, $450/gpm; Geiger tube detectors, $1200 each; scintil-
lation detectors, $2300 each; service and office building, $35/£1°; and a
building to house the storage canals, $10/1t°. The costs of the aluminum
stands to hold the cylinders were estimated at $25, $39, and $63 each for
6-, 12-, and 24-in,-diam pots respectively. Cooling system costs, which

include cooling towers, heat exchangers, and pumps, were increased by 25%.

The discontinuity in each of the cost curves of Figs. 6.6 and 6.7 at
the 19- to 20-year marks is a characteristic of the particular economic
model that is used. In this model, it is assumed that any investments
made after the end of the 20-year income-receiving period would have to
be financed out of the escrow fund. Investments made during the 20-year
period, on the other hand, would be recovered from incomes received during
that same 20-year period. Since any investments outstanding during this
period are expected to yield an annual interest of 12.4%, the incomes used
to retire these investments are, in effect, earning at this rate all through
the payout period. An investment made in the twentieth year must be re-
covered (reduced to zero) at the end of that year. This is done by making
use of accumulated annual incomes that have been received during the
previous 20 years and that have, in effect, been accumulating interest
at 12.4% per year. If these incomes had been accumulating at an interest
rate of only 5% per year, the amount of annual income required to retire
the same investment would have had to be much larger. The discontinuity
comes about because of the assumption that an investment made in the

twentieth year can be retired by incomes that have been accumulating for

20 years at 12.1% per year, while the same investment made in the twenty-
first year must be retired by incomes that have been accumulating at only
5% per year. For example, in Fig. 6.6, a 19-year age for the waste at
the time of calcination means that the investment for the calcination
facility was made in year 20, while a 20-year age at the time of calcina-~
tion means that the investment was made in year 21. In constructing the
model, there seemed to be no simple, valid method of eliminating this
discontinuity, which never amounts to more than about 2% of the cost in

any event,

Disposal in Salt Mines. - The estimated costs for the disposal of

 

solidified wastes in a salt mine are presented in Fig, 6.8. As in the
previous study , 2+ the cylinders are buried in vertical holes in the floor
of a mine that is excavated 1000 ft below the surface. The pots are
spaced in such a manner that the decay heat can be dissipated without
increasing the temperature of the salt above 200°C. Costs that were
developed in the study of an initial government-owned repository (de-
scribed in Sect. L.3.L) were utilized in arriving at the estimates shown
in Fig. 6.8. A cost of $381,000 per acre of the net mine area, including
all capital and operating costs and 5% annual interest on money, was an
average of several cases considered. To determine the costs of burying

a can of waste, the required mine area was first calculated from consider-
ations of the heat-generation rate and the age of the waste at the time
of its burial, This area was multiplied by $381,000; then the product
was converted to mills per kilowatt-hour of electricity originally gener-
ated, and present-valued. Disposal costs lie in the range of 0.1 x 1073
to 10.9 x 1073 mill/kwhr; they increase with pot diameter because the
heat is dissipated easier from smaller vessels, thus permitting more

efficient utilization of space in the mine,

the unit cost of disposal is given since it is assumed that this is a
national facility owned and operated by the government on a full cost-
recovery, but nonprofit, basis. Finally, the minimum total unit cost,
in mills per kilowatt-hour, is given for each case, as is the maximum
amount of capital that remains to be recovered at any time during the

20 years that income is received.

Cases 1 through 3 indicate that the total cost increases from 0.034
mill/kwhr to 0.039 mill/kwhr as the interim liquid storage time is de-
creased from 20 years to 5 years. In case 1, calcination in 9-in,-diam
pots and shipment to the repository are carried out after a 20-year ;
storage period; these operations are financed entirely by the fund which
is established for that purpose. This is the least expensive of any of -

the cases that were considered.

Case 2 shows that calcination in 12-in,-diam pots, shipment, and
disposal can be carried out, after only 10-years liquid storage, for
0.0367 mill/kwhr. However, if the waste is solidified after only 5-years
storage, it can be seen from case 3 that an additional S-years storage of

the solids prior to shipment and disposal is justified.

Because of their high heat-generation rates, these wastes cannot be
calcined without some prior storage as liquids unless the residual solids
are either diluted with inert material or treated in some manner designed
to increase their thermal conductivities, In case lL, it is assumed that
the volume of residual solids has been increased by 504 [i.e., from 1.0
to 1.5 £43 /10M Mwd (thermal) ] without affecting the thermal conductivity. ’
The wastes are calcined immediately in 6-in,-diam pots, stored in canals "
for 3 years, and then shipped to a salt mine for permanent storage. The ‘
total cost for this schedule of operations is 0.0388 mill/kwhr, about 14%

more than for case 1,

Results of laboratory studies show that our capability of producing
dispersions of calcined solids in a sodium tetraborate matrix is potenti-
ally good. These dispersions would have a thermal conductivity of about
1.4 Btu hr £875 (°F)™}, and their volume would be no greater than that
of the calcined solids.’! Case 5 assumes the formation of such a disper-

sion in 9-in,-diam pots without prior liquid storage. After lj-years
6-U1

storage in solid form, this waste is shipped to the repository; storage
and shipment result in a combined cost of 0.0371 mill/kwhr.

Case 6 represents the most accelerated schedule possible, as deter-
mined by the maximum allowable heat-generation rates of wastes buried in
salt. Here, it is assumed that the wastes are solidified immediately
[after dilution of the residual solids to 1.5 £43 10% Mwd (thermal)], and
then shipped to the repository after only 1 year of interim solid storage.
A total cost of 0.0437 mill/kwhr” is estimated for this case.

In summary, these costs indicate that the least-expensive management
consists of storing the waste in liquid form for the full 20 years that
income is received before solidifying and shipping it to the salt-mine
repository. Storage as a liquid for only 10 years, followed by solidifi-
cation and shipment to the repository, increases the total cost about 8%;
and immediate solidification, followed by 3 to l; years on-site storage of
the solids prior to shipment and disposal, costs 9 to 14% more. If for
any reason, such as for enhanced safety, the schedule should need to be
carried out with the least practical delay, we would expect to pay about
30% more.

Effect of Scale. - A consideration of the major components of the
costs in the management of high-level wastes indicates that these costs
should be dependent on the quantity of fission products handled rather
than on the mass of fuel reprocessed. The quantity of fission products
can be represented by the burnup of the fuel, and, on an annual basis,
it is equivalent to the total number of thermal megawatt-days represented
by all the fuel reprocessed during that year. Accordingly, cases 2, L,
and 5 were investigated from the standpoint of the total annual waste
management cost over the burnup range 1,13 x 107 to 1.82 x 108 Mwd
(thermal) /year. (These burnups are equivalent to about 340 and 5500
metric tons/year, respectively, of fuel that has been exposed to 33,000

Mwd/metric ton, )

The total annual costs for case 2 are represented, within +10%, by:

0.76
$/year = 1.07 x 10° [ss (enermma ear i

Case 4 is represented, within +10%, by:

6.3.4L Comparison of Salt with Concrete Vaults and Granite

 

The choice of a permanent disposal site for solidified high-level
radioactive wastes must be made on the basis of both safety and economic
considerations. Although the safety and cost requirements cannot be
rigorously defined, the hazards associated with the wastes are of suffi-
cient magnitude that provisions for containment outside the environment
are required, virtually forever. It is implicit that this containment
be effected under conditions requiring a minimum of surveillance and at
a cost commensurate with the costs of other items in the power reactor

fuel cycle,

In the United States, cavities mined in natural salt formations are
believed to offer the best possibilities for the permanent disposal of
high-level radioactive wastes, However, since a salt mine could be
located at a considerable distance from a fuel reprocessing plant, ship-
ment of the wastes would almost certainly be required, Suitable deposits
of granite or shale might be more accessible to a plant, Also, it is
conceivable that high-integrity concrete vaults could be constructed at

the plant site to serve the purposes of permanent containment.
6-43

If we have available, as a point of reference, the more detailed
analysis of the cost factors in the disposal of calcined wastes in salt
mines, T a rather perfunctory analysis can show the relative costs for
disposal of wastes in concrete vaults at the surface of the earth and in
areas excavated from granite formations. In lieu of a formal safety
analysis, a qualitative observation can be made that disposal in granite
would, at best, be no safer than in salt. In addition, concrete vaults
would be less safe because of the limited period of integrity of the
concrete and the proximity of the waste to the biosphere. Therefore, in
order for these alternative methods to be competitive, the costs of mining
space in granite should be as low as the costs for salt, whereas the costs
for vaults should be lower than those for salt.

Costs were estimated for the permanent storage of calcined radio-
active wastes in concrete vaults and in rooms mined out of granite forma-
tions. The costs for concrete vaults were five to seven times as much
as the previously estimated costs for storage in salt mines, whereas the
costs for storage in granite were only about twice as much. Thus, its
economic advantage, as well as the greater safety it is believed to offer,
makes salt the preferred choice. While it is possible to design vaults
of lower costs than those calculated in ref. 22, it seems unlikely that
the costs could be reduced sufficiently to make them comparable to those

for storage in salt formations, unless many safety features are sacrificed.

Vaults for use in the storage of high-level solid wastes would be
similar in their gross features to many of the tanks built for storing
liquid radioactive wastes, in that they would be underground structures
of reinforced concrete with an earth cover, To make storage in vaults
as safe as possible, we assumed that the vaults were sealed completely
from the surface. Space requirements were calculated by assuming that
the heat of radioactive decay was dissipated via conduction through the
earth cover, Vaults of two types of concrete were considered: ordinary
concrete (capable of withstanding temperatures of LOO to 500°F), and
"high-temperature concrete" (capable of withstanding a temperature of
1000°F).
6-LL

Space requirements for storing calcined wastes in rooms mined out of
granite formations are about the same as those for storage in salt forma-
tions. However, mining costs are higher for granite because heavier
equipment is required, drilling is more difficult and slower, and costs

of explosives are higher,

It must be borne in mind that, whereas the costs given in ref. 22
should be valid for comparative purposes, a more subtle interpretation
may be placed on them when they are used to optimize the total costs of
waste management. For example, disposal in concrete vaults has been
estimated to be five to seven times as expensive as disposal in salt
formations; however, a concrete vault located at the plant site would
eliminate the need for waste shipment. Although the costs for shipping
long-decayed waste in the largest-diameter cylinders would be 10%, or
less, of disposal costs, shipment of the wastes in smaller cylinders after
short periods of decay could amount to as much as 25 to 50% of the costs
of disposal in vaults. Again, with a moderate increase in cost, the vaults
could be equipped with forced-air convection cooling (i.e., to serve as
interim storage facilities) until the fission product heat generation had
decreased to a level that would allow the vault to be finally sealed. In
this way, interim storage in canals prior to permanent disposal could be
avoided. Of course, these same considerations would apply to granite or
salt in the event that the fuel processing plant is situated adjacent to

suitable deposits of either.

As has been previously pointed out, a really meaningful optimization
of waste management must include safety, as well as economic considerations.
At present, it 1s believed that salt offers the greatest safety and that
the costs for disposal in salt, even allowing for shipment under reasonable

conditions, are less than for other alternatives.
6.3.5 Salt Mine Repository Charges

A preliminary estimate of the charges for handling and emplacement of

containers of solidified waste at a salt mine repository has been developed

using the latest information available at the time this report was published.
6-45

Subject to a minimum charge for handling, the cost for disposal of a
container of waste is determined as the product of the cost per unit of
floor area of the mine and the area that is required to provide for
sufficient dissipation of heat from the container. The characteristic
mine area required by a container is determined by the transient thermal
power of the container and imposed conditions that are necessary to ensure
thermal stability of the mine and acceptable temperatures near the land
surface. A unit cost of $9.90 per £t° of floor area of the mine was de-
rived on the basis that 245 net acres of burial space would be utilized
over the 20-year life of the repository and that the total cost incurred
in this period would be $106,000,000, This total cost (in 1970 dollars)
provides for full recovery of all capital and operating expenses over the
life of the repository, with 5% annual interest on outstanding debt and
provisions for a $500,000 fund for perpetual’ surveillance after

decommissioning.

The following equation has been found to correlate the unit cost

data that have been developed in comprehensive studies:

C = unit cost for receipt, handling, and disposal of a container

tion if given to radioactive daughters), this equation may be expressed

as:

(1) Containers shall be right cylinders having outside diameters
in the range of 6 to 24 in, and heights in the range of 2 to
10 ft.

(2) The minimum cost per container shall be $300.

(3) A container may not have transient power density such that the
calculated cost is greater than $10,000.

(LY) The initial linear thermal power of a container shall not
exceed 500 w/ft.

(5) At any time greater than 5000 years after receipt of the

container, the following equation shall be satisfied:

were a function of the 0.70 power of the plant size, instead of the 0.35
power assumed for total capital investment, it would contribute about 5
to 6% of the total capital investment we have allowed for a L0-metric
ton/day plant. However, unless the noble gases and iodine are removed
from the off-gas to a much greater extent than at present, the cost of
the reprocessing plant site area will be a function of greater than the
1.0 power of the plant area and, in turn, the site costs could become a
substantial fraction of the total capital investment (see Sect. 8). As
discussed in Sect. 8, the enhanced removal of noble gases and iodine,
improved containment of internal explosions, and earthquake-resistant
structures can reduce site size requirements to the point that considera-
tions other than health and safety are controlling. The extra cost of
these safety features might add 10% to the capital costs estimated in
Sect. 6.1, thereby increasing the total reprocessing cost estimates

(including waste disposal) by less than 10%.

6.5 Costs of Engineered Safeguards

The word "safeguards has been used to refer to engineered safety
features designed to protect the public against the potential hazards
of reactor or other nuclear facility operations or accidents. It has
also been used to imply inspection procedures for ensuring that fissile
materials are not diverted to unauthorized uses. In this report, we have
used the term "containment systems" instead of "engineered safeguards."
We have not independently estimated the costs of "political safeguards,"
but have assumed that these costs will be paid by the national or inter-
national agencies responsible for the policing rather than being charged
to the utilities whose fuel is being reprocessed. It has been reported
that 29 people would be required to police NFS; on this basis, we can
estimate that such antidiversion inspection could increase the total
reprocessing cost estimates of Sect. 6.1 by less than 2.5%, assuming that
present labor and overhead costs are involved, (No allowance is made for

increased capital cost or reduced operating efficiency.)
6-19

We have not made any recent estimates of the cost of noble gas
removal. In an early cost analysis of the Idaho Chemical Processing
Plant, the added cost of 99% noble gas removal was less than 3% of the
total capital cost. 28 New technology is under development, and new cost
estimates are needed, particularly for the case of short-cooled FBR fuel;
however, we still feel that the removal of noble gases will add only a

few percent to plant capital cost.

To date, we have not made any estimates of the cost of high-degree
iodine removal (by factors of 10° or more in some cases discussed in
Sect. 8). However, we plan to make some estimates in connection with
our FBR reprocessing development program. Again, our tentative appraisal
is that iodine removal will increase the capital cost of the plant by

only a few percent.

Examples of the incremental cost of earthquake-resistant structures
have been summarized by Bell and Lomenick,?” Cost increases due to aug-
mented earthquake survival capacity in structures can be divided into
those for design and those for construction, Unfortunately, the art of
cost-benefit analysis has not yet been established, even for conventional
structures. For both conventional structures and nuclear plants, the
burden of work on the structural design engineer is greatly increased as
seismic loading is increased. It is estimated that the recent building
code changes in Los Angeles, which permit high-rise reinforced concrete
structures in cases where ductility requirements are met, will increase
the proportion of cost allocated to structural engineering by 50%. The
proportional change in the costs of construction and materials will not
be as great, It was estimated that a conventional 12-story building
would cost about L to 6% more if designed for 0.10 gravity than if earth-
quake excitation were not considered. An inspection of the Preliminary
Hazards Summary Report for the proposed Malibu reactor allows a rough
estimate of the added cost of steel for earthquake reinforcement of the
containment system to be made as no more than 10% of the containment

cost, or less than 1% of the total plant cost.

We have not made a detailed estimate of the added cost of protecting

reprocessing plant and waste tanks against possible 100-psi internal
6-50

explosions. Such a detailed study would be desirable; however, we feel
that this added containment will add only a small percent to our reference

capital cost estimates.

All in all, we feel that the possible additional capital cost for
these "engineered safeguards" or "contaimment systems" is on the order of
10% of the capital costs allowed for in Sect. 6.1 (with the uncertainty
already being on the order of +30%).

7. SITING CONSIDERATIONS

7.1 Environmental Factors

7.1.1 Meteorology
Meteorology and Atomic Energy, © AFCU-3066, provides a detailed dis-

 

cussion of meteorology and its role in air quality from the standpoint
of the nuclear industries. A referral to the Nuclear Safety Information
Center (NSIC) will furnish up-to-date studies and data on specific related

subjects.

For convenience, the meteorological factors can be divided into two

groups: (1) commercial considerations, and (2) health and safety aspects.

Commercial Considerations. - Technology has obviated the importance

 

of most meteorological parameters in the location and design of industrial
facilities. Electrical power "outages," for example, have yielded to
advanced circuitry, thereby reducing the importance of thunderstorm fre-
quency to electrically dependent industries. The climate inside most

new offices is controlled by decree, not by the outside environment;
consequently, the same types of office buildings may be found throughout

all climatological regions.

Rainfall and wet-bulb temperatures continue to be important criteria
for manufacturing industries with large cooling requirements, Rainfall --
its frequency, duration, distribution with time, and reliability -- deter-

mines the input parameters for hydrological considerations.

Wet-bulb data are necessary when the water in the cooling facilities
is to be recycled rather than immediately being discharged into nearby
rivers or lakes. Wet-bulb frequency tables, as well as temperature and
dew point tables, are obtainable from the Envirommental Science Service
Administration (ESSA), Department of Commerce, in the United States, and
from the national meteorology services of other nations. Subjective
aspects of the use of cooling towers are the appearance of vapor clouds
and the attendant hazards to motorists traveling nearby roads during cold

weather.
7-2

Health and Safety Aspects. - From the moment a particle or a gas

 

escapes to the outside environment, its fate is determined by the prevail-
ing meteorological conditions, The wind and temperature fields traversed
by the effluent are of primary importance, The following paragraphs out-
line the variables that are likely to be important in the considerations

of various sites.

Wind Speed and Direction, ~- The significance of detailed wind data

 

is obvious. The frequency of wind direction toward any given sector
determines the actuarial experience or potential to the population or
facilities within that sector from material emitted upwind, The wind
speed directly affects the dilution rate of effluent material. Conse-
quently, the first consideration of the meteorologist is to obtain or
construct wind roses, Once wind vector data become available, calcula-
tlons of the concentration of material vs emission can be made, based on
a number of references. = Where possible, "night" and "day" wind roses
(lapse vs inversion data would be more useful, but they are rarely avail-

able) are preferable to the 2l-hr averages.

There are a number of locations where a simple wind rose is neither
available nor can be readily estimated. For example, sites in deep valleys
and sites near oceans or lakes have complex wind patterns that vary from
night to day. The normal regional wind flows are superimposed on these
local effects. Thus, although a few broad generalizations may be made,
special observations over a period of time are necessary for detailed

analysis.

Calm winds (generally, wind speeds of less than 3 mph) require more
than superficial analysis. Winds of 1 to 3 mph are considered "light air"
on the Beaufort scale,’ and are described as follows: "Direction of wind
shown by smoke drift, but not by wind vanes." Here, the effects of local
terrain, surface heating vs inversions, etc., on effluent behavior are
most marked. Moreover, the effluent's own characteristics play an import-
ant, perhaps dominant, role in the height to which the material will rise.
The skillful analysis of "calm" wind data and potential effects on effluent

material presents a challenge to the most experienced investigator,

tn:
7-3

The persistence of wind vectors or calms is generally secondary to
the wind roses themselves. If a potentially harmful release over a pro-
tracted period is considered, the potential hazards to a sector or to a
number of adjacent sectors are calculated by assuming a degree of contin-
uous flow toward the areas of concern. The persistence of calms may

become a limiting factor in areas of persistent anticyclonic circulation.

Wind variation with height (or elevation) assumes increasing import-
ance as the height of the stack is increased. Surface wind data are
generally sufficient for estimating average downwind concentrations when
stacks are 30 m or less in height and the effluent temperature is near
ambient. However, if the terrain has a noticeable effect on lower-level
winds, wind data obtained above the first 100 m or so must be considered.
Also, tall stacks and high effluent temperatures introduce effluent to
wind regimes that are different from those at ground level. Interpolation
between wind observations made near the surface and routine information
that has been gathered from the upper air network of ESSA can serve as a

first approximation to the wind pattern at intermediate heights.

The temperature variation with height was a parameter used primarily
to determine the extent and the intensity of inversions, It is now being
utilized, when available, for determining effective stack heights of
fossil-fueled power plants and other facilities where large quantities

of heat released to the atmosphere may be used to advantage.

Rainfall, Rainout, and Washout. - Specific elements of interest are
removed by rainfall at rates varying with the form of material and the
intensity of the rainfall, The removal of effluents by rainfall poses
the question of the amount of material deposited on the area involved.’
Where possible, a "rainfall wind rose! should be constructed. The signifi-
cance of rainfall rates vs wind direction may then be applied to effluent

removal models,

Deposition. - The removal of material from the atmosphere via depo-
sition is strongly dependent on the concentration profiles of the effluent
in the vertical. The parameters of stability and wind speed, in combina-~
tion with a deposition model (such as Chamberlain's deposition velocity),

can be statistically manipulated to estimate the depletion of material as
7-L

a function of distance from its source and, as a corollary, the amount

and pattern of deposition around the source.

The terrain has been mentioned in relation to its contribution to
wind behavior. In a slightly different manner, we may consider terrain
as a parameter in source configuration or emission rates. For example,
if an industrial site is located in a deep valley, the air in the valley
has a capacitance effect; that is, it smooths the outflow of the effluent
over a period of time. Aside from possible increased deposition to the
sides of the valley, concentrations and deposition calculations over
periods of a day or longer are only slightly different from the estimates
obtained from flat terrain. The "smoothing" delays, but does not alter,
the introduction of effluent into the surrounding wind pattern. However,
a sudden increase in the rate at which the material is emitted will be
mitigated by the capacitive effect. The nearby environment suffers a
longer and a heavier effluent burden, whereas the distant terrain, although
receiving the same total amount of material, experiences a lesser load
over a greater period of time than would have been the case if the effluent

moved freely from its source.

When the amount of material that is released to a volume of air
exceeds the inflow of "fresh" air, stagnation begins. Stagnation is not
confined to valleys by any means. It is quite pronounced in arctic towns
and cities in the wintertime, as well as in cities like London and Los
Angeles in temperate climates. Nevertheless, in temperate climates,
valleys are more prone to suffer from stagnation than open areas, A
quick estimate based on the routine off-gas levels and the volume of
surrounding air will give some idea of how susceptible a facility is to

stagnation problems.

Vegetation, particularly wooded areas, can be considered a meteorolog-
ical factor that alters the wind behavior in the vertical and changes the

deposition and concentrations accordingly.
7.1.2 Geolo and drolo

The geology and hydrology of the site of a nuclear fuel reprocessing
plant can influence: (1) the foundations of the plant, (2) the emplace-
ment of underground waste-storage tanks, (3) the water supply, (4) the
routine disposal of liquid and solid radioactive wastes, (5) the danger
from earthquakes, and (6) the consequences of an accidental release of
significant quantities of radioactive materials. Geologic conditions
that would be favorable for one of these considerations might be unfavor-
able for another; therefore, an ideal environment does not exist, and the
selection of any actual site will require a compromise, Perhaps the only
valid generalization is that all of these considerations will be easier
to evaluate if the geology and hydrology of the site are simple (although
determining what constitutes a "simple!" environment may frequently be
difficult).

Foundations. - Satisfactory foundations can be provided in almost
any geologic environment, although water-saturated, poorly compacted
clays and silts may require deep and expensive excavations or pile
driving. Many limestones contain extensive and unpredictable networks
of solution cavities, which are difficult to wash free of mud and fill
with cement grout, Fault zones, particularly in basic igneous rock,
weather more deeply than the adjacent unfractured material and may cause
difficulties if they are not detected by preliminary test bores, These
points may appear somewhat elementary; however, they bear repeating since
several of them have, on occasion, been neglected in the siting of nuclear

facilities both in this country and in Europe.

Emplacement of Underground Waste Storage Tanks. - A nuclear fuel

 

reprocessing plant will probably need waste-storage tanks, which may be
located underground. If hard bedrock exists at a shallow depth, the
emplacement of the tanks may be relatively expensive. On the other hand,
some unconsolidated deposits may need to be shored up (i.e., to hold open
excavations), which is both expensive and potentially dangerous. The most
important requirement, however, is that the excavations in which the tanks

are located be well drained and located safely above the water table.
7-6

(Partly filled tanks will float up out of the ground if surrounded by
water.) If located near a river, the plant site must be well above any

possible flood level,

Water Supply. - If sufficient quantities are available, groundwater
is generally preferable to surface water as a source of water supply, since
surface water is nearly always more variable in temperature and chemical
composition. This suggests that the plant site should be underlain by
at least a moderately deep deposit of sand or other permeable material.
Permeable limestone, which can yield an excellent supply of groundwater,
may not be desirable (as has been mentioned), because of potential prob-
lems with the plant foundations. Also, aquifers with an irregular and
unpredictable permeability may seriously complicate the problems of routine
low-level waste disposal or of remedial action following an accidental

release of radioactive materials.

Routine Waste Management. - High-level radioactive liquid wastes may

 

have to be aged in tanks prior to ultimate disposal. At least 50 ft of
easily excavated sediments, or deeply weathered rock of moderate permea-
bility, and appreciable ion exchange capacity are required for satisfactory
tank emplacement. After aging, the wastes can be solidified and then
shipped to a permanent disposal site. As described in Sect. L.3.5, exca-
vations in salt or other dry, underground workings are highly desirable

for a permanent repository, and sites with these characteristics may be

many miles distant from the reprocessing plant.

Intermediate-level liquid wastes can best be handled by combining them
with high-level wastes for eventual solidification and permanent storage
outside the biosphere, A less desirable alternative is tc solidify the
intermediate-level wastes, perhaps by incorporation in asphalt or cement,
and to ship them off-site to licensed burial grounds or special reposito-
ries, Still another alternative may be the disposal of these wastes by
hydraulic fracturing (Sect. L.l.3). At least several hundred feet of flat-
lying beds of shale at depths between 500 and 3000 ft are required for
this method of disposal. The shale would have to be tested to make cer-
tain that horizontal, rather than vertical or steeply dipping, fractures
will be formed.
T=7

Low-level liquid waste and potentially contaminated cooling water
are produced in such volumes that storage is impractical. This waste is
treated, usually by evaporation or ion exchange, and then released to the
ocean, to a river, or into a shallow or deep groundwater aquifer, Although
release to the ocean has apparently been satisfactory at various sites
that routinely use this type of disposal, it has required detailed, con-
tinuing surveillance of fish, sea weed, and beaches in the affected area.
Release to rivers has, perhaps, been somewhat less satisfactory, depending
greatly on the particular circumstances; however, even under favorable
conditions, it has entailed extensive, detailed environmental monitoring.
In cases where the circumstances have been even mildly unfavorable, severe
restrictions have been placed on the concentration and the total quantities
of radioactive materials that could be discharged, necessitating careful
and potentially expensive treatment of the low-level waste prior to dis-
charge. Successful releases of waste into shallow (water-table) aquifers
also depend greatly on local conditions. In sparsely inhabited areas,
large, unused aquifers may be available to provide dilution and, more
importantly, long holdup times for the waste. In instances where the
aquifer that is used for disposal is also used in the same general area
for water supply, extensive geohydrologic investigations will be required;
even then, severe restrictions may be placed on waste discharge. The most
favorable situation for disposal of low-level liquid waste would be pro-
vided by a deep, permeable, and porous artesian aquifer that is not a
source of water supply. This would be the case if equally good (or better)
sources of water were available on the surface or at a shallow depth.
Then a deep, moderately permeable aquifer could be developed in such a
manner that it would receive all the low-level waste and cooling water
from a large nuclear fuel reprocessing plant. However, to ensure that
no hazard would exist, considerable geologic and hydrologic information
would have to be assembled and analyzed, Such information has been
collected for several areas in the United States by a committee of the
American Association of Petroleum Geologists.’ The areas described as
favorable in this report would be particularly suitable sites for nuclear

fuel reprocessing plants.
7-8

Consequences of the Accidental Release of Radioactive Material. - If

 

large quantities of radioactive materials were accidentally released and

then quickly reached a stream, a river, or the ocean, with only a small
proportion being held back at or near the plant site, the consequences

could be serious, Rapid movement and low retention should be expected

at a site where the earth or rock is sufficiently impermeable to allow

released liquids to move rapidly over the surface and virtually no ion

exchange with the soil to take place. On the other hand, in many perme- *
able terrains, the released radioactive materials would travel through the
soil (i.e., below the surface); and, if the plant were located at even a
short distance from the nearest stream or river, the travel time might be
long enough to permit important remedial action to be taken. Also, during
this time, appreciable quantities of many of the radionuclides might be
fixed virtually permanently in the soil and thus be rendered effectively

harmless,

In connection with the consequences of accidental release, simplicity
in the geologic enviromment is particularly desirable. Only in cases where
the conditions can be analyzed in detail and with considerable confidence
can predictions of the possible results of an accident be made. These
predictions will allow proper precautions to be taken against such an
eventuality, as well as suggest effective remedial measures in the event
of an accident. A simple geologic and hydrologic environment also makes
it possible to determine, with confidence, the most effective local methods
for ultimate disposal, the maximum quantities of radioactive material that
may be released to the environment, and the best methods for monitoring
the enviromment to make certain that safe levels of discharge are not being

exceeded,

7.1.3 Geoselsmology .

General. - Faults, vibrations, and tsunamis are the major earthquake-
induced phenomena to be considered in the siting and the design of nuclear
facilities (including fuel reprocessing plants). All of these are important -
for some sites along the West Coast of the Unites States; on the other
hand, vibratory effects are generally the sole concern in the eastern part

of the country.
7-9

The rapid growth of the nuclear power economy has focused consider-
able attention on the unknown and/or imperfectly understood aspects of
earthquakes as related to reactor siting and design. In general, this
lack of knowledge has made it imperative that conservative estimates and
evaluations of the critical geoseismological and engineering design param-
eters be made for nuclear facilities in all parts of the country. In many
areas, it appears that earthquake-induced phenomena can be adequately
considered through currently acceptable engineering practices; however,
in some highly seismically active regions, the high degree of geoseismo-
logical conservatism requires that unique and presently unproved designs

be considered.

With regard to the needed improvements in predicting faulting, shaking,
and tsunami effects at potential nuclear facility sites, it is emphasized
that, since there is no quantitative way to predict earthquakes, empirical
and somewhat indirect approaches to the problem must be used, One of the
principal means for studying earthquake phenomena is, of course, through
the observation of earthquake events. Since large earthquakes occur
rather infrequently and there are currently few, if any, positive corre-
lations between the occurrence (as to place and time) of earthquakes and
measurable changes in the physical and/or chemical properties of rocks
that comprise the earth's crust, major improvements in defining and deter-
mining the geoseismological factors pertinent to reactor siting and design
of nuclear facilities will require intense and concerted efforts in the

geological, seismological, and engineering disciplines.

Structural designs for accommodating moderate amounts of differential
ground displacement and for ensuring plant survival for most of the con-
ceivably strong ground motions appear to be attainable; however, demon-
strable proof of these designs is needed to ensure the functioning of all
components or systems that are directly or indirectly related to the

containment of radioactivity.

Faulting. - The exact mechanisms for generating earthquakes are not
known, but it is generally agreed that faulting is the cause of most of
the large shallow earthquakes in California and in other tectonically

similar areas of the world. In the continental United States, historic
7-10

faulting has been largely confined to the area west of the Rocky Mountains
(see Fig. 7.1), and there is good reason to believe that faulting in the

foreseeable future will continue to be restricted primarily to this area.

Through observations of historic surface breaks, we can make a general
evaluation of the length of the main fault trace, its location, and the
amount of displacement that may be expected when an earthquake of a spe-
cific magnitude occurs along a major fault. However, it is much more
difficult to determine the nature and extent of the many secondary, minor,
or subsidiary faults that commonly occur adjacent to, or near, the main
fault traces. At the present time, relatively little is known about the
characteristics of faulting that occurs at areas located away from the
main fault traces. Thus, secondary or minor faulting is one of the prin-
cipal problems in the siting and design of nuclear facilities in seismic-

ally active areas.

Another important and controversial problem in siting concerns the
degree of activity of faults. Many faults in the western part of the
United States can be clearly labeled as active, while others have been
determined to be unquestionably inactive. However, the large number of
faults that lie between these two extremes are probably of greatest con-
cern, At present, it is difficult to determine precisely enough the date
of the most recent motion along such faults. In addition, it is difficult,
in many cases, to state what elapsed period of time after the last movement
along a fault would provide assurance that the fault is inactive and that
no further movement would occur in the foreseeable future. Since the
majority of faults have not moved in historic times, we must rely on
geologic relationships and seismological evidence to provide data regard-

ing the tectonic activity of many faults.

Shaking, - Small earthquakes, which occur over most of the earth's
crust, may cause localized shaking, However, during shocks of great
magnitude, extremely large areas, covering hundreds or thousands of square
miles, may be subjected to severe shaking. The strong earth motions
assoclated with larger shocks should be recognized and taken into account
in the siting and design of fuel reprocessing plants. However, at the
present time, there is some uncertainty in defining the characteristics
of these expected motions.

in the United States.

Strong-motion accelerometers are currently being used to record severe
shaking in the United States. Although ground accelerations have been
recorded for a relatively large number of small shocks, only a few large
earthquakes have been recorded on strong-motion instruments. The charac-
teristics of these ground accelerations have been thoroughly analyzed, and
this information, along with other seismic and geologic data, is commonly
used to estimate the amount and the nature of the expected ground motions
at other sites. Because of the general lack of instrumental records of
strong ground motions, and because there is no suitable theoretical basis
for predicting these motions, we do not have an acceptable quantitative
method for precisely determining accelerations, velocities, and displace-
ments of the ground motions for a given earthquake at most sites. Thus,
estimates of the important design parameters of ground motion must be

conservative,

Earthquake-induced ground motions in soils are usuwally larger than
those in hard rock; however, it is not possible to state precisely the
magnitude of the difference. Most of the studies of the intensity of
shaking in various types of rock and soll have been conducted with small
shocks, and there is no satisfactory technical method for extrapolation
to larger shocks, Recently, determinations of the dynamic properties of
soll sections and theoretical considerations have yielded important rela-
tionships concerning some soil conditions and ground motion characteristics;
however, before reliable predictions can be made for the majority of soil
conditions, extensive laboratory and field investigations must be carried
out. In addition to their amplification and/or attenuation properties,
soils may also fail or be displaced, via consolidation, differential com-
paction, sliding, and liquefaction, as a result of earthquake-induced

ground oscillations.

Tsunamis. - Tsunami and tsunami-generated oscillations are potentially
dangerous to nuclear fuel reprocessing installations at coastal sites,
since they may cause damage to the plant and water intake structures by
means of runups and/or withdrawals. Most tsunamis are thought to be gen-
erated by vertical displacement of the subsea bottom. About 60% of all

recorded tsunamis originate in the Pacific Ocean, where large earthquakes
7-13

occur along deep, bordering trenches. Runup heights in Japan, Kamchatka,
Chile, Peru, Alaska, and the Hawaiian Islands have often exceeded 30 ft;
however, during historic times, the West Coast of the United States has
apparently not been subjected to runup heights greater than 16 ft. The
relatively low runup along the West Coast of the United States is attrib-
uted to the coastal shelf. In contrast to the experience on the West
Coast, damaging tsunamis have not been recorded along the Gulf and Eastern
Coasts of the United States. Chances that a tsunami will be generated by
a local disturbance off the West Coast are thought to be limited, since

apparently no locally generated damaging tsunamis have occurred there in

the past.

At many sites, the prediction of maximum runup height is difficult
because relatively obscure coastal and submarine features tend to amplify
waves, Since some sites have consistently high waves and others have
consistently low waves, the best guideline for prediction along the West
Coast appears to be previous experience with tsunamis, regardless of the
direction of approach. With the exception of the Alaskan tsunami that
occurred in March 1961 and caused runups as high as 16 ft at Crescent City,
California, the recorded runups along the West Coast have not exceeded the
tidal range of about 6 ft.

7.2 Geographic Factors

The primary consideration in acquiring a site for a fuel reprocessing
plant is to provide sufficient distance between the plant and private lands
to ensure that the general public will not be harmed by either normal oper-
ations or by credible accidents. Second, the site should be located at a
place where the aggregate cost of raw materials, transportation of materials
to the plant, manufacturing, and transportation of finished products to the
market will be at a mi ndmum, In present plants, the basic raw materials
are water, nitric acid, solvent, and aggregate for concrete. Either a
railroad spur or a waterway with barging facilities is a practical neces-
sity since some spent-fuel shipping casks weigh 50 to 100 tons. Paved

highways are required for trucking smaller casks, raw materials, finished
7-1k

products, and waste, Manufacturing costs are dependent on an adequate
supply of skilled labor and the prevailing wage scales in the vicinity.
Conveniently located housing and community facilities are desirable.

Long commuting distances and poor facilities (as well as an undesirable
climate) tend to result in a large labor turnover, The plant must have
adequate acreage for possible future expansion, adequate soil or rock
foundations to support heavy concrete structures, and reliable electric
power; the latter should preferably be available from two independent
sources. Ideally, the plant should be located relatively near nuclear
power reactors and sites for disposal of high- and low-level waste. The
following sections briefly describe considerations that affect the site
size, the surrounding population density, the land usage in the vicinity,
and the relation of the plant to other nuclear facilities. Regions in the
United States having certain desirable and undesirable features will be

delineated,

7.2.1 Site Size

The site boundary is determined most accurately and restrictively by
the requirement that the direct exposure of the surrounding public to radio-
active gaseous or liquid effluents must be maintained at allowable levels,
These considerations will be discussed in detail in Sect. 8. Penetrating
radiation that escapes through the shielding used in the plant is not
normally a consideration. For example, the penetrating radiation from
an unshielded nuclear excursion of 10°90 fissions would cause whole-body

exposures no greater than 25 rem at distances of only about 350 nt?

Studies at Hanforal3s th indicate that controlled areas extending 0.5
to 1 mile from the plant are desirable for the control of "nuisance con-
tamination" resulting from a temporary loss of control of relatively small
quantities of radioactive materials, Such minor releases might result
from outside decontamination operations on large pieces of process equip-
ment or shipping casks. This is not an absolute limitation; it is possible
(i.e., at increased cost) to house those facilities that would potentially
disperse low-level contaminants. It was found that the routine release

of noxious nonradioactive chemicals to the atmosphere (most significantly
7-15

NO, ) would dictate a site boundary about 1 mile from the stack. This

is also not an absolute limitation, since such gases may be removed from
stack effluents to practically any extent required using present technol-
ogy. The discharge of low-level radioactive effluents is determined pri-
marily by the relative flow rate of groundwater and surface water as a

function of distance from the plant.

7.2.2 Population Density of the Surrounding Area

 

Federal regulations (LOCFR100) specify that there shall be a zone
of low population surrounding a reactor plant, The primary concern is
to prevent population groups from receiving somatically or genetically
significant doses of radiation. The costs of indemnification are also
of concern; claims resulting from overexposure to radiation resulting
from accidents would probably be directly proportional to the number of
persons involved, Guthrie and Nichols have estimated that monetary losses
of $50,000, $10,000, and $2000 would result from exposures of greater than
100, 10 to 100, and 1 to 10 times the allowable annual industrial radia-
tion dose respectively.’ It was estimated that severe contamination,
resulting in long-term evacuation and total loss of property value, would
cause an average monetary loss of $10,000 per person. Minor contamina-
tion, which would necessitate short-term evacuation, washing nonporous
surfaces, and replacing or recovering porous surfaces such as sidewalks,
pavements, roofs, etc., was estimated to result in monetary losses of
$1500 per person, Minor contamination, which would require roofs, streets,
and buildings in urban areas to be hosed was estimated to result in a

monetary loss of about 5 mills per square meter of projected surface,

7.2.3 Land Usage

Special considerations are required when fuel reprocessing plants
are located in areas where there is a mechanism for reconcentration of
the radioactive effluents and a pathway for ingestion by the general
public. Because certain radionuclides (e.g. 051, and 137¢s, see ref, 8)
are known to concentrate in crops, the restrictions on low-level liquid

waste effluents that are subsequently to be used for irrigation may be
7-16

more severe than if the water were used only for drinking, Deposition of
radioiodine from gaseous wastes on grass, followed by the cow-milk pathway
to the thyroid of small children, may result in maximum permissible air
concentrations lower by a factor of 700 than those for inhalation, Special
considerations are also required when fuel reprocessing plants are located
near other plants whose products are very sensitive to radiation (e.g.,

the photographic industry).

7.2.4 Relation of the Plant to Other Nuclear Facilities

 

The fuel reprocessing plant should be designed and located to take
into account adjacent nuclear facilities, including reactor plants, other
reprocessing plants, and waste disposal sites. Effluents from the plant
must not mask nuclear instrumentation at adjacent sites. Accidents in the
plant should not cause unduly hasty and unsafe evacuations of adjacent
sites. In addition, the effluents from each plant must be restricted in
such a manner that thelr combined effect does not endanger the health and
safety of the surrounding public. In practice, the effect of these re-
strictions has been minimal at production plants and national laboratories;
the cost of engineered features is generally offset by the decreased cost

of logistics.

7.2.5 Regional Distribution of Potential Sites in the United States

 

We have gathered information that may be of value in selecting
potential sites, based on surrounding population density, distance to a
population center, and seismicity. The attached packet of overlay maps
includes: (1) a base map showing population densities, by county, of the

The first overlay (red) indicates the location of all single commu-
nities having populations of 20,000 or more (according to the 1960 U.S.
census), plus a number of towns that have grown to this size on the basis
of more recent census estimates. Federal power districts are also indi-
cated. The 250 U.S. metropolitan areas with populations ranging from
52,000 to about 10,000,000 were plotted first. Then all towns with
populations as low as 20,000 persons were plotted. The sizes of the
circles indicate, in general, the sizes of the cities, and they were
plotted with a radius based on the distance to the edge of concentrated

housing plus 10 miles. On this basis, the circles have the following

diameters:
20,000-50,000 20-mile diameter
50,000-100, 000 25-mile diameter
100, 000-250,000 30-mile diameter
250, 000-1,000, 000 35-mile diameter
>1, 000,000 LO-mile diameter, or 10 miles

beyond the edge of the

metropolitan area

It is interesting to note that a large number of the communities in
the 20,000-50,000 population range were found to be suburbs of the larger

metropolitan districts.

In order to complete this survey, it is recommended that all towns
with populations as low as 10,000 be plotted in order to discover twin
cities and tri-cities having combined populations of 20,000 or more.
These data are now in hand. In addition, it must be noted that, for the
nonmetropolitan-area towns, actual city limit population values were used

and that the actual built-up areas may include 20 to 100% more people.

The second overlay (blue) shows the location of all major rail lines
that are presently in commercial we, but does not include a number of
presently unused branch lines. These branch lines are in varying degrees
of disrepair, and their capacity for handling heavy fuel casks would have
to be determined in the event that interest in their use should be indi-

cated,

The third overlay (green) shows the seismic risk zones from the
seismic risk map of Algermissen,t’ The four zones may be expected to
approximately represent expected damage and intensity. Zone O contains
the areas in which earthquake damage is not expected to occur, and where
Modified Mercalli (M.M.) intensities in excess of IV have not been
observed, Zone 1 is composed of areas of expected minor damage, where
M.M. intensities in excess of VI have not been observed, Zone 2 contains
areas where moderate damage may be expected. Zone 3 contains areas where
major destructive earthquakes have occurred in the recorded past. There
is no clear distinction between zones 2 and 3 on the basis of expected
intensity, other than that catastrophic earthquakes have occurred in

zone 3,

8. HEALTH AND SAFETY ASPECTS OF PLANT SITING

The principal criterion for judging the adequacy of a site for a fuel
reprocessing plant is the provision that no undue risk exists with regard
to public health and safety in the surrounding areas. Present and fore-
seeable technology requires that such plants routinely discharge small
quantities of radioactive materials to the atmosphere; for this reason,
and also because of the large inventory of physiologically hazardous
materials, there 1s always a small, but finite, probability of a more
massive discharge. The magnitude of the routine discharge and the prob-
ability of a more massive discharge are determined by the inventory of

radioactive materials and by the design features of the plant.

Present licensing procedures for fuel reprocessing plants apply
existing federal regulations for radiation protection (10CFR20) ,* licens-
ing of production and utilization facilities (10CFR50), and siting of
nuclear reactors (10CFR100),° wherever applicable, to the plant under
study. The safety of a proposed facility is determined by evaluating,
as a unit, the proposed plant and the site. The design features of the
plant, together with the geological, hydrological, seismological, and
meteorological characteristics of the site, are analyzed to determine
whether the proposed design is adequate to maintain the barrier between
radicactivity and the surrounding population under adverse environmental
conditions such as earthquakes, tornados, and floods. The consequences
of releasing radioactive effluents during normal operations as well as
during "upper limit accident" conditions, are evaluated using environ-
mental characteristics of the site, The calculated concentrations of
normal plant effluents are compared with the values published in 10CFR20;
the engineered features for prevention and mitigation of the consequences
of accidents are compared with the guidelines of 10CFR50; and the calcu-
lated doses received by a member of the general public from postulated
accidental releases are compared with the guidelines specified in 10CFR100.
If, by employing conservative assumptions, it can be demonstrated that
engineered safety features and releases under all credible conditions are

within the guidelines, then the plant and the site are considered acceptable
8-2

The following sections of this chapter present estimates of the
effect of health and safety considerations on the siting of spent-fuel
processing plants. These include the consequences of an expanding nuclear
economy on the worldwide distribution of long-lived volatile radionuclides,
local envirommental effects of the routine release of radionuclides, and

the effects of credible accidents.

Section 8.1 presents estimates of the worldwide distribution of 85k
and 3g in an expanding nuclear economy, assuming that these nuclides are
released quantitatively to the atmosphere and the hydrosphere. These
estimates, together with those of following sections, lead to the conclu-
sion that worldwide pollution hazards will be avoided and local operating
personnel will be protected by the necessary expedient of providing engi-
neered safety features and site boundary distances that ensure appropriately

low radiation exposures of members of the public at the site boundary.

Section 8.2 presents estimates of the effect of routine releases of
radioactive materials from spent-fuel processing plants. The consequences
of, and site boundary distances dictated by, routine releases from fuel
processing plants were estimated assuming (1) ORNL meteorological condi-
tions, (2) the complete release of noble gases and tritium, (3) iodine
decontamination factors of 2000 (present technology) and 107 in plants
for processing highly irradiated fuels that have decayed 150 and 30 days,
respectively, and (Li) a particulate-release-rate model that agrees satis-
factorily with existing data. For reference purposes, the acceptable
concentrations at the site boundary were selected as one-third of the
air concentrations listed in 10CFR20, Appendix B, Table IT, Column 1,
with the exception that the 1317 concentrations were further reduced by
a factor of 700 to account for the grass-cow-milk pathway to the thyroids

of small children,

The downwind consequences resulting from the routine release of radio-
nuclides from a plant processing light-water reactor (LWR) fuel (postirra-
diation decay period of 150 days) or a plant processing fast breeder
reactor (FBR) fuel (decay time of 30 days) are estimated to be controlled
by the release of noble gases and iodine. It is concluded that equipment

for removing 50 to 99% of the noble gases is necessary in plants of
8-3

capacity more than a few tons per day; more efficient iodine removal than
that demonstrated in present technology is required for LWR plants of
capacity greater than about 6 to 10 tons/day, whereas DF's for iodine as
high as 108 may be required for FBR plants.

Section 8.3 presents estimates of the effect of releases of radio-
active effluents in "upper limit accidents." The consequences of upper
limit accidents were estimated assuming that the acceptable annual dose
commitments resulting from exposure to the cloud or inhalation at the site
boundary are those recommended by the National Committee on Radiation Pro-
tection for annual occupational exposure. Although the assumed acceptable
dose commitments have been employed only for reference purposes, they may
be plausible on the basis that the ratio of benefit to probability of
exposure 1s believed to be greater for an individual of the general popu-

lation living near the site boundary than for a worker in the plant.

The meteorological and dose commitment analysis was based on the
assumptions of flat downwind terrain and exposure to the radioactive
cloud. The consequences of downwind ground contamination and additional
exposures by such phenomena as reentrainment were not considered as mecha-
nisms that would limit plant siting. Excessive levels of ground contami-
nation would cause inconveniences, require expensive decontamination
procedures, and result in property loss; however, they would probably
not present an unavoidable threat to the health and safety of the public.

It is concluded that the confinement and ventilation systems in
spent-fuel processing plants remove particulates of nonvolatiles dispersed
under accidental conditions to such an extent that the upper limit acci-
dents are controlled by the release of such volatile and semivolatile
materials as the noble gases, iodine, ruthenium, cesium, and tellurium.
Credible upper limit accidents in well-designed facilities for interim
storage of wastes, either in liquid or solid form, are estimated to be
inconsequential with respect to those from processing operations in the

plant.

8.1 Buildup of 85kr and °H in an Expanding Nuclear Power Industry

As the free world's nuclear power production increases, the buildup
of 85 in the atmosphere and 34 in the hydrosphere may become important,
Therefore, estimates of dose equivalents to the year 2000 from a uniform

worldwide distribution of these radionuclides have been made.

Estimates of the amual production of 85kr and 35 are based on the
ABC's projected civilian nuclear power economy in the United States and
in the free world, 5 In Fig. 8.1, which shows the growth of the nuclear
power industry, foreign capacity in the year 2000 is assumed to be equal
to the estimates of capacity in the United States at that time. Thermal
power generation was estimated by assuming load factors of 0.8 to 1980
and 0.7 at the year 2000, and a thermal efficiency of 0,31. Thus, in the
year 2000, the free world's nuclear capacity for continuous operation is
estimated to be 1 million electrical megawatts and 3.3 million thermal

megawatts.

The rates of production and accumulation of 85k, and 3g are shown in
Fig. 8.2. Production rates were based on an assumed core irradiation of
20,000 Mwd/metric ton and a specific power of 25 Mw/metric ton. The
accumulated quantities of 85x and 3 were obtained by allowing each
radionuclide produced in the immediately preceding 5-year period to decay
for 2.5 years and adding this value to the previously accumulated quantity
(corrected for decay for 5 years). Accordingly, in the year 2000, 85%
production will be 520 megacuries/year, and 3000 megacuries will have been
accumulated, Tritium production will be 15 megacuries/year, and 96 mega-

curies will have been accumulated.

8.1.1 O%Kr Distribution and Dose Equivalent

 

The concentration of BSkr in the atmosphere was estimated by assuming
complete mixing of the 85kr and the air throughout the first 8 miles of
the atmosphere, Within this zone, 85kr was assumed to be distributed
according to the density mass of air. Above 8 miles, the tropopause
would inhibit rapid mixing into the siretogghere.? Rainout was consid-

ered negligible, since calculations indicated that the atmosphere

Figure 8.3 shows the estimated whole-body exposure from 85g» as a
function of elevation. A maximum dose rate of 1.8 millirems/year in the
first one-fourth mile of the atmosphere can be compared to an average
background radiation of 100 millirads/year (to skin) near sea level and
to permissible whole-body exposures of average population groups of 170
millirems/year, and of members of the public of 500 millirems/year, as
recommended by ICRP and wre. 8 9

8.1.2 Tritium Distribution and Dose Equivalents

 

Practically all of the tritium in irradiated fuel elements may be
released to the ernviromment during spent fuel processing. This release
is assumed to occur as HTO, either as tritiated water or as tritiated
water vapor. The volumes of circulating waters in the world, listed in
Table 8.1, were used to calculate the concentration of tritium in the
environment. It was assumed that: (1) tritium was mixed in oceans and
seas to a depth of LO m, (2) all the water in stream channels and in the
first 10 km of the atmosphere was circulating, (3) only the portion of
the groundwater located in the root zone was available for mixing, and
(4) complete isotopic dilution occurred in these waters. As shown in
Fig. 8.L, the estimated dose equivalents to body tissue due to inhalation

of air and absorption through skin, and to ingestion of surface water

Ly

for the year 2000, Nonuniform distribution of 3g in rainwater and surface

water has been indicated by Libby in his claim that 50% of the tritium

containing 3H are 7.2 x 107% and 1.4 x 1073 millirems/year, respectively,

releases of 3g from fuel reprocessing plants, then approximately 10% of
the earth's surface will receive one-half of the total 3y, Thus, the

dose equivalents in this temperate zone may be five times the calculated

average,

8.2 Routine Release of Radionuclides to the Atmosphere

Present technology requires that fuel reprocessing plants continuously
discharge off-gas and ventilation air to the atmosphere. Nonradioactive
gases are generated in some process operations; for example, air is sup-
plied deliberately to some process vessels for such purposes as pneumatic
liquid level determination, mixing of solutions by sparging, and maintain-
ing nonflammable concentrations of gases and vapors. Since absolutely
leak-tight containment barriers are impractical, a flow of ventilation air
from normal working areas to enclosures (glove boxes, cells, canyons, etc.)
containing radioactive materials in process equipment is required to main-
tain a contamination gradient. By a variety of mechanisms, radioactive
gases, vapors, and aerosols of liguid and solid particles tend to become
entrained in these off-gas and ventilation streams. The absolute removal
of all radioactive materials from these streams prior to discharge to the

atmosphere is impractical.

The policy for the routine discharge of radioactive effluents to the
environment is to maintain the rate of release of radioactive materials
at the lowest practical level consistent with current technology by care-
ful control and c amtinuous monitoring. In any event, the consequences of
the release must be within the limits established by federal regulations
(10CFR20), which have the intent of providing that negligible risk to the
health and safety of the public will result. This policy is achieved by
(1) striving to maintain process vessel enclosures free of mobile radio-
active materials in order to minimize the possibility that the ventilation
air will become contaminated, (2) maintaining the flow rate of the off-gas
that contains (or comes in contact with) mobile radioactive materials at
the minimum practical level, (3) employing devices such as scrubbers and
filters to remove as much of the radioactive material from the effluent as
is practical, and (L) discharging the effluent through stacks to provide

effective atmospheric dispersal.

mated, based on current technology for LWR fuel reprocessing plants and
foreseeable technological developments for plants that will process FBR
fuels, The corresponding release rates, in curies, may be obtained as

the product of the fractional release (Table 8.2), the fuel processing
rate (in metric tons/day), and the concentration of the isotopes in a
metric ton of fuel (Table 8.3). These values permit a preliminary esti-
mation of site sizes that would result from the effect of routine releases.
Section 8.4 will present an analysis of tradeoffs that can be made in site

size through the use of additional engineered safety features.

Noble Gases. - A total of approximately 0.001 £t° (STP) of the noble
gases He, Kr, and Xe is generated in each megawatt-day of reactor opera-
tion. The radioisotopes of physiological hazard significance that remain
after 30 or more days of postirradiation decay are 85k and 133%e. Un-
vented fuel contains approximately 0.3 curie of 85k» for each megawatt-dar
of burnup. Unvented fuel contains about 1300 curies of 133%e per mega-
watt of thermal power after 30 days of decay and negligible quantities
after 60 days of decay.

In preparing Table 8.2, it was assumed that these gases will continue
to be released quantitatively from LWR fuel reprocessing plants as the
fuel is chopped and/or dissolved. It was assumed that, in plants for
reprocessing FBR fuels after 30 days of decay, the gas would be held up
(in a charcoal bed) for a period of 18 days to effect an order-of-magnitude
reduction in the 133%e activity. Several processes (employing charcoal
adsorption, liquid nitrogen, Amsco, or fluorocarbon scrubbing, or perm-
selective membranes), within moderate extensions of current technology,
may be employed to remove 90 to 99% of both xenon and krypton if required
because of particular site limitations or a strict adherence to a policy
of maintaining "lowest practicable! release rates. Release rates, partic-

ularly for 85r, would be lower for reactor fuels that use the vented

fuel concept.

Tritium. - Approximately 0.025 curie of -H is formed for each
megawatt-day of reactor exposure, The common and most stable compound,
HTO, is practically unrecoverable by present technology after it has been

mixed with water, Present plants discharge tritium essentially quanti-

Complete release of tritium to the atmosphere, the planned means of dis-
posal at the MFRP plant, is assumed in Table 8.2. Advanced technology,
employing either vented fuel elements or a high-temperature oxidation
process after the fuel has been chopped, may reduce the rate of release
of tritium from fuel processing plants by factors of 10 to 100.

0.07 and 2400 curies per megawatt of thermal power after decay times of
150 and 30 days respectively. The 1297 content is about 1076 per megawatt-

day of fuel exposure,

In current technology, iodine reports, almost completely, to off-gas
systems as Ls HI, or iodine-organic compounds that are generated in such
process operations as chopping, dissolving, and evaporation. Current
off-gas trains use caustic scrubbers, which remove approximately 90% of
the iodine, and silver nitrate towers, which remove about 99% of the
remaining iodine. Through 1962, such devices were used to maintain an
average 131; release rate to the atmosphere of approximately 0.3 curie/day

at NRTS, HAPO, SRP, and ORNL.D’

It is assumed that plants for reprocessing fuels that have decayed at
least 150 days will routinely release 0,1% of the iodine. However, plants
for reprocessing fuels after a decay period of 30 days will require develop-
ment of techniques for maintaining the fractional 131

of 1077.

I release in the range

Particulates. - The common chemical forms of the fission products
other than the noble gases, tritium, and halogens have sufficiently low
vapor pressures that the predominant mechanism of release to the off-gas
systems is by entrainment of particulates. While several semivolatile
fission products (Tc, Se, Ru, Cs, and Te) are known to concentrate in
off -gases from certain process operations, the general experience at
ORNL in fuel reprocessing operations has been that particulates in off-gas

streams have essentially the same relative content of fission products as
8-16

the fuel being processed. The explanation is that most of the aerosol in
the ventilation streams consists of liquid particles that have become
entrained in off-gases that have contacted radioactive solutions. The
liquid particles probably have the same fission product content as the
original solution since the off-gas streams generally have high relative
humidities. The particles that dry after being deposited on ventilation
ducts and filters largely tend to remain fixed and to contribute little
£0 the routine release of nonvolatile fission products. (However, they
may be the source of a serious accidental release if there is a means for

sudden and massive reentrainment.)

At ORNL it has been found that the off-gases from aqueous fuel reproc-
essing operations contain particles of aqueous solutions at a concentration
of approximately 10 mg/m (i.e., the concentration of water particles in
fog) and that there are equal weight fractions of particles in the size
ranges less than 0.L yu, 0.4 to 1.3 4, 3 to 5, and greater than 5.
Also, it is known that the weight distribution of particles less than
about 5 ,, in size is relatively constant even if there is gross entrain-
ment of larger particles. Typical deep-bed sand or High Efficiency
Particulate Air (HEPA) filters used in processing plants would quantita-
tively remove 100% of the particles greater than about 3 , in size and
about 99.98% of the particles less than 3 y, which have the size distri-
bution indicated above, From these data, it is estimated that the
concentration of aerosol in the filter effluent is of the order of 0,0012
mg /m°. Assuming that the radioactive solutions in the plant contain 300 g
of fuel per liter (typical of the dissolver and accountability tanks,
which contribute significantly to the off-gas) and have a specific gravity
of about 1.2, the estimated concentration of fuel in the filter effluent

is 0.3 x 10712 metric ton of fuel per cubic meter of air,

The estimated fractional release of fuel to the atmosphere from a
l-metric ton/day plant for processing >150-day-decayed LWR fuel, using
current technology, is 1.2 x 10, assuming a combined dissolver and
vessel off-gas flow rate of 1000 cfm. By comparison, the dissolver and
the vessel off-gas flow rates are LOO and 620 cfm, respectively, at the
NFS plant tC and approximately 500 and 1000 cfm at the Hanford Purex plant.
8-17

It is estimated that the flow rate of the dissolver-vessel off-gas at the
MFRP plant will be 250 cfm.

The estimated fractional release from a l-metric ton/day plant corre-
sponds to dally release rates of 0,037 curie of mixed fission products,
0.0006 curie of Sr, 0.007 curie of 95Zr-2°Nb, 0.00 curie of “Ru
0.0008 curie of 14
average daily release of nonvolatile fission products from the three
Hanford processing plant stacks includes 0,01 curie of 957-95, 0.007
curie of 103g, 0,006 curie of 106

3

Ce, and 0.00003 curie of Pu. By comparison, the

Ru, 0.00 curie of Ge, and 0.00003
curie of total alpha emitters (presumed to be pu), 17 It is estimated

that the daily release of particulates from the MFRP plant stack will
consist of less than 0,006 curie of mixed fission products and less than
0.002 curie of alpha activity from plutonium, 2 The estimated daily
release of particulates from the 5-metric ton/day BNFP plant consists of
less than 0.17 curie of mixed fission products and less than 0.0001 curie
of alpha activity from plutonium; this corresponds to a fractional release

of about 1 x 1078.18

It is estimated that technological developments will permit the
dissolver and the vessel off-gas flow rates to be reduced to 20 and 50
cfm in l-metric ton/day plants that would process 30-day-decayed FBR fuel,
If such is the case, the routine release of particulate activity should
be lower than from current plants, in spite of the higher specific activity

of FBR fuels.

It is assumed that the routine release of radioactive particulates
to the enviromment will increase in direct proportion to the vessel off-gas
flow rate in plants having larger throughput rates. The fuel inventory
of individual process vessels will not increase in direct proportion to
the production rate because of the necessity for multiple equipment lines
to permit continuity of operation and the use of progressively more con-
tinuous equipment. The routine release to the off-gas system is roughly
proportional to the area of the interface between the radioactive solid
or solution and the gas. Radioactive aerosols are entrained in off-gas
streams primarily by sparging (usually at a fixed rate of approximately

1 scfm/ft°), but also by diffusion and recoil from surfaces. As a first
8-18

approximation, continuous equipment will have a greater surface-to-volume

ratio, which will offset the effect of larger process vessels.

8.2.2 Local Environmental Consequences of Releasing COKr and 2H

 

Many pathways have been postulated by which radionuclides may be
transmitted through the environment and thereby contribute to the total

dose received by man.’ A generalized model that relates the principal

parameters involved in estimating the external dose is as follows: 0
t
ext -

where

De [ty5 tos v(ty)] = total external dose to radionuclide i in
pathway j at location k for an individual

of age y(t,) at the beginning of exposure,
Yin

= quantity of radionuclide i released that is
entering or available to pathway Jj,
Pit) = concentration of radionuclide i in pathway

j at location k during time t per unit of

radionuclide initially available, and

C; 50v (8) = dose rate to the reference organ of an
individual of age y per unit concentration

of radionuclide,

The total external dose due to radionuclide i in pathway j at location k,
accumulated from time t, to t, by an individual of age v(t;) at the
beginning of exposure, is the integral of the product of the level of
contamination (the quantity Q 5 and the concentration P3 5x) and the dose
rate term, Cis The later term includes all necessary factors that
account for the habits and characteristics of the individual. With minor
changes, the same expression can be used to estimate internal dose. For
internal dose, the Cig term denotes the dose commitment in the (t, - 1)

days following a one-day exposure of the individual,
8-19

According to the International Commission on Radiological Protection,
the entire human body is the critical organ for exposure to 85k. 8 The
principal mode of exposure is submersion in contaminated air. Body tissue
is the critical organ in the case of exposure to tritium as tritiated water
or tritiated water vapor. However, the external dose resulting from sub-
mersion in air containing HTO vapor is limited to areas where the skin has
minimal thickness, because of the limited penetration range of tritium's

beta particle.

Prior studies at Hanford and Oak Ridge have demonstrated that not all
modes of exposure, or pathways contributing to the same mode, are of equal

importance. “1?

The modes of exposure considered in this analysis will
include ingestion, inhalation (and accompanying skin absorption), irradia-
tion from a contaminated surface, submersion in contaminated water, and
submersion in contaminated air. These estimates of dose consider only

the dose to "standard!" man.

Procedures for Estimating Permissible Release. - Acceptable release

 

rates for 85kr and 3y were investigated for a hypothetical fuel reprocess-
ing plant located at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. This selection
was made since information was already available on some of the environ-
mental factors that influence the dispersion and possible reconcentration

of fission products that may be released.

Average annual downwind air concentrations are calculated by a modi-

fied Gaussian plume formula as follows:

S R 2.032F(88).Q 2

X(ox) = L . (Sx) NCI Coe - z 21 (2)

— J Ww .
where

X(ox) = average annual concentration along a 22.5° arc at distance
x in direction 9 (curies/m>),

F(sS), = fraction of time that the wind is in direction g, for
stability S and wind speed group i,

Q, = initial emission rate (curies/sec),

o(sx), = vertical dispersion coefficient at distance x for stability

8-20

ules), = average wind speed in direction g, for stability S and
speed group i (m/sec),

h = stack height (m),

R = index denoting wind-speed groups,

S = index denoting stability parameter.

This expression is obtained by integrating the Gaussian plume formula over
the crosswind direction and distributing the results uniformly along the
entire arc. Since the average wind-speed vector and its frequency of
occurrence are used, calculations yield average annual air concentrations,
Applications of this technique have been demonstrated previously by
Culkowski, >

Equation (2) is modified to include washout and fallout by multiplying
by the appropriate correction factors. Corrections for washout and fallout
are based on the work of Chamberlain and Slade respectively, 2th 25 These

corrections are as follows:

Uashout = FP TS); | ’ (3)

where p is the washout coefficient (sect); and

where V is the deposition velocity (m/sec). Equation (4) can be evalu-
ated numerically, based on curves of oS, values given by Hilsmeiler and

Gifford, 20

Figure 8.5 shows the calculated air concentrations at the ground
surface for a l-part/sec release from a 100-m stack located at ORNL, The
most recent meteorological data reported by Hilsmeier are used in these
calculations.’ Concentrations shown in Fig. 8.5 can be compared with
others that include fallout, washout, and changes in stack height; by
this process, average annual doses can be estimated for a variety of

conditions,

Washout, - Washout coefficients for soluble gases have been calcu-
lated by Chamberlain, using the assumption that the rate of absorption is

2ly,28

controlled by the rate of gas diffusion to the raindrop. Since the

solubility of krypton in water is small (1.85 x 10710 g of krypton per
7

gram of water at equilibrium), it was assumed that the solubility limit
controls the amount of krypton absorbed. The solubility of 85g. in rain-
water, even when released at 1 curie/sec, would be limited by the stable
krypton in the atmosphere (about ) x 1073 g/m near sea level).?? It was
further assumed that krypton is washed out of the atmosphere, beginning
at an average height of 1 mile. This assumption is based on the height
of rain-bearing cumulus clouds and on the extent of vertical development
of radioactive clouds released as a point source. The average intensity
of rainfall is about lJ mm/hr in the Oak Ridge area, 0 and, at equilibrium,
2 x 10° g of krypton per second could be absorbed in a column of the
atmosphere 1 mile high and 1 cm’ in area, About 5 x 1074 g of stable
krypton per square centimeter is contained in the atmosphere to a height
of 1 mile. Based on these considerations, the average washout coefficient

was calculated to be:

2 x 101k g of Kr sec” on™ = x 1011 gecl

A=
5x 107k g of Kr om™2

The washout coefficient of tritiated water vapor (HTO) has been
estimated from Chamberlain's calculations for 50, deposition in rain-
water. 2 It was considered to be proportional vo the diffusion coeffi-
cient of the vapor in air. Therefore, the following expression was used

to calculate Agro for a Ly~mm/hr rainfall:

Loss of HTO from a raindrop to the atmosphere was assumed to be negligible,
This assumption is valid if the distance the raindrop falls below the con-

taminated cloud is small as compared with the relaxation length.”

A washout coefficient of L x 107k se
with that indicated by Chamberlain and Eggleton,

cL for HTO vapor is consistent
32 Similar values can
also be deduced from published data on the concentration of tritium in
the atmosphere and in rainwater. For example, the maximum concentration
of tritium, in tritium wits (10), was reported to be 10° in hydrogen,
3 3

Assuming the average water content of air to be 8.6 g/m (at 50% relative

10° in water vapor, >> 2 x 107 in methane, and 1.4 x 10° in rainwater,

humidity and 20°C) and using the values of TU listed above, the concentra-

-11

tion of tritium in the atmosphere is estimated to be 2.9 x 10 curie/m.

The tritium content in a column of the atmosphere 1 mile high and 1 m? in

8

area is L.7 x 107° curie. The rate of tritium removal from a 1-m? area
by a L-mm/hr rainfall would be 5.1 x 10712 curie/sec. Therefore, the

washout coefficient is calculated to be:

12

_ 5.1 x10" curie/sec

-1
L.7 x 1078 curie

A =1.1x 1074 sec
Since the annual frequency of a l-mm/hr rainfall in Oak Ridge is only
0.037, the average annual ground-level air concentrations are not reduced

significantly at these washout coefficients.

Fallout. - If the sorption of a radionuclide by the ground surface
is irreversible, the flux of the radionuclide to the surface does not
depend on the amount already deposited. Chamberlain describes the rate
of deposition for such a system in terms of a deposition velocity. The
following equation is used to estimate the deposition velocity of gases

. 28
or very small particles:

V (2) = —E ©)
g 1 4p (kuxz, DF)

 

*Relaxation length is the distance in which the isotopic composition of
the raindrop decreases by l/e.
8-2L

where
V_ = deposition velocity (cm/sec),
k = von Karman's constant (0.4),
u* = friction velocity (cm/sec),

Z, = reference height above ground surface at which the concentration

of the radionuclide is measured (cm),
D = molecular diffusivity (em? /sec).

By assuming u% = LO cm/sec (appropriate to the Oak Ridge area), Z, =
100 ¢m, and D = 0.15 en’ /sec (diffusion coefficient of krypton in nitro-
gen), 38 the deposition velocity of krypton is 1.7 cm/sec. For tritiated

water vapor, with D = 0,23 em’ /sec, the deposition velocity is 1.8 cm/sec. 0

The retention of krypton by the soil is assumed to be limited by the
adsorption capacity of the soil for krypton. The retention of krypton by
soil can be estimated, assuming that the amount of adsorbed krypton is
proportional to the surface area of the soil. From measurements of krypton
adsorption on charcoal (2 x 107° g of krypton per gram of charcoal at 25°C
and 1073 mm Hg partial pressure)’ and the ratio of soil area to charcoal
surface area (0.08),40 the adsorption of krypton by soil is estimated to
be 1077 g per gram of soil (or 1.2 x 1077 g/cm for a soil density of
1.2 g/cm). The rate at which krypton is deposited on the soil is esti-
mated as the product of the deposition velocity (v, = 0.017 m/sec) and
the krypton concentration in the atmosphere (X = L x 1073 g/m), or
6.8 x 10° g m™° sec™l. At this rate, the soil will probably become
saturated with krypton and may not act as a perfect sink for the addition
of 85, The amount of Bok adsorbed on the soil at equilibrium is assumed
to be directly proportional to the ratio of radioactive and stable krypton
in the atmosphere. For a 85ke release rate of 1 curie/sec, the soil load
(at equilibrium) at the point of maximum ground-level air concentration
would be the product of 1.2 x 107! g/cm’ (soil) and 4 x 1077 g/m’ divided
by the product of 4 x 1073 g/m (air) and 397 curies per gram of 85¢e, or

L.8 x 107H curie/cm.

Since the adsorption of 85kr by the soil may not be an irreversible

process, the net flux of 85%r to the soil (g m~2 sect) may change as the
8-25

soil approaches saturation. The deposition velocity calculated from
Eq. (4) can be used to estimate only the initial flux of 85kr to the soil
(and cloud depletion by fallout). The flux to the soil would be expected

to diminish with time until steady-state conditions are attained.

The mechanisms by which HTO vapor may be retained by the soil would
probably include adsorption, condensation, and exchange with soil moisture.
Evaporation, evapotranspiration, and soil drainage would act to redistribute
the deposited material. Water vapor (H,0) in the atmosphere would also be
acted upon by these mechanisms and would compete with HTO for retention
by the soil. In the absence of isotopic fractionation, the ratio at equi-
librium of the deposition rate of HTO vapor to H,0 vapor would be directly
proportional to the ratio of thelr respective concentrations in air, A
deposition velocity of 0.018 m/sec can be used to estimate the flux when
the soll acts as a perfect sink, Assuming an average water vapor content
in the atmosphere of 8.6 g/m, the flux of water vapor to the soil due to
fallout would be 0.15 g n° sect (Lh.7 x 10° 2
rate of rainfall in Oak Ridge is 1.1 g nm? sect. For a frequency of

gm year 1), The average
rainfall of 0,037, the quantity of rainwater deposited each year is

1.3 x 10° g/m’. These rates imply that, if the soil acts as a perfect
sink for water vapor fallout, the soil would receive an amount of water
equivalent to a continuous rainfall of about 0. mm/hr. Obviously, this
does not occur; thus the soll would not act as a perfect sink for either
HTO or R,0 vapor, and the flux of HTO vapor to the soil would be expected
to vary with time. Only a free water surface, such as the Clinch River,
can be assumed to act as a perfect sink for HTO vapor that 1s released
from a stack. Further studies are necessary to evaluate the flux of both

3g and 85kr to the soil during transient and steady-state conditions.

As a first approximation, the following conservative assumptions are
made: (1) the contaminated cloud is not depleted of 85k and HTO by
fallout; (2) the quantity of 85k» retained by the soil or by the Clinch
River is proportional to the ratio of radioactive and stable krypton in
the atmosphere; (3) the quantity of HTO retained by the soil is propor-
tional to the ratio of HTO vapor and H,0 vapor in the atmosphere; and
(L) the Clinch River is a perfect sik for HTO vapor.

quantity of krypton associated with particles is estimated by assuming
that the air contains 1.h x 107

adsorb as much krypton as charcoal (2 x 1070 g of krypton per gram).

of city atmosph

Adsorption of krypton on particles is estimated to be 3 x 10710 g per
cubic meter of air, which is negligible as compared with the krypton in
the atmosphere (U4 x 1073 g/m). Assuming that charcoal particles can
retain two layers of water vapor, the adsorption of water vapor by the
particles is estimated to be 7 x 1075 g per cubic meter of air, This

value is negligible as compared with that of water vapor in the atmosphere

(8.6 g/m).

Dose Estimation Models. - Methods described and parameters given in

3

ICRP Publication 28 are used to convert concentrations (X in curies/m

 

to estimates of dose equivalents to "standard" man from submersion in a
contaminated cloud, from ingestion, and from inhalation. In particular,
Egs. (12), (13), and (20) in ref. 8 are used, and equilibrium conditions
are assumed where appropriate. These dose equations are summarized in
Table 8.L.

Submersion dose rates in contaminated water were calculated by assum-
ing that the body is in the center of a sphere and receives equal quantities
of radiation from all directions.’ Other assumptions included: (1) the
radius of the contaminated fluid is large as compared with the range of
beta particles and to the half thickness of the fluid for gamma rays,

(2) an effective energy that is equal to the average energy of the beta

particle is absorbed, and (3) penetration distance for the beta particle
in the body is short, thus limiting beta radiation to skin and subsurface
tissue. The following expressions were derived to calculate dose equiva-

lents at the surface of a body submerged in contaminated fluid:
For Boxer;
R = 0.26 Xx, rems/hr
For SH:

Hine and Brownell describe the derivation of equations that relate to
the calculation of dose rates in air from beta emitters associated with
an infinite plane of negligible thickness , #2 Equations (10), (11), (20),
and (21) in ref. l2 are selected for calculation in cases where the energy-
dependent parameters are those adapted for dose estimates in soft tissue,
Equation 9-30 from work by Morgan and Turner is used to calculate the dose
due to gamma emitters when the source is of infinite planar extent and
infinite thickness 3 External dose equations listed in Table 8.L for
soil contaminated with 85¢r are then derived from the expected soil load
(L.8 x 1071% curie/cm’) at the maximum air concentration (1.6 x 1070 se/end).
The range, in aluminum, of the average-energy beta particle from 85k is
used to estimate the thickness of contaminated soil contributing to the
beta radiation dose and, thus, the amount present per unit area. The
beta radiation dose rate is calculated by assuming that this amount of
85k is spread uniformly over the surface without taking self-absorption

within the soil layer into consideration.

Estimated Dose Equivalents. ~ For the purposes of this analysis, we

 

have chosen 85¢r and 3u release rates of 0.55 and 0.034 curie/sec respec-
tively. These release rates correspond to a reprocessing plant with a
capacity of about 6 metric tons/day (a fuel exposure of 33,000 Mwd/metric
ton and a specific power of 30 Mw/metric ton). All of the 85k is assumed
to be released to the atmosphere. It is assumed that 0.0085 curie of 3
per second is released to the atmosphere as HTO vapor and 0.0255 curie of
34 per second is discharged to the Clinch River at mile 20.5 (below the
Oak Ridge municipal water intake and above the water intake for the Oak
Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant) as liquid waste and is diluted with L900 £13
of river water per second. Other schemes of 3 release, such as the dis-
tillation of 3H-bearing liquids and release to the stack as water vapor,
are possible, but would require an appropriate adjustment in the dose
estimates that follow.
8-29

Surface water in the area can be contaminated directly by fallout
and washout of 85kr and 3g, as well as by the direct release of HTO in
liquid waste. Clinch River water is assumed to equilibrate with 85k at
the maximum specific activity expected in the atmosphere up to the solu-
bility limit of krypton in water. Soils that equilibrate with 85kr or 3g
from the overlying atmosphere are assumed to retain these materials. The
contribution, by washout, is based on the deposition rates that are calcu-
lated in the northeast sector; and these are the maximum rates. Assumptions
made for the addition of 85g, by fallout and 3 by washout would then give

conservative estimates of concentrations in Clinch River water,

Figure 8.6 shows the average annual dose equivalents in millirems per
year, to the total body for submersion in air containing 85x, Exposures
are assumed to be continuous (168 hr/week and 50 weeks/year). These average
dose rates were calculated from the ground-level air concentrations (Fig.
8.5) that result from a l-curie/sec release rate and a negligible cloud
depletion by washout and fallout. Figure 8.7 shows the estimated dose
rates for continuous exposure, in millirems per year, at a distance 2.5 ft
above a ground surface contaminated with 85kr. Ionizing radiation associ-
ated with tritium on the ground surface would be shielded effectively by
2.5 ft of air.

Table 8.5 contains the estimated annual dose equivalents, to the
standard man working at the Oak Ridge Gaseous Diffusion Plant (ORGDP) or
residing in Oak Ridge, due to the release of 0.55 curie of 85+ and
0.034 curie of 3 per second in the environment. Periods of occupancy
are 10 hr/week and 50 weeks/year for the ORGDP employee, and 168 hr/week
and 50 weeks/year for the Oak Ridge resident. A "less than" sign preceding
certain values reflects a conservative estimate. The critical modes of
exposure are submersion in air for 85kr, and inhalation and absorption
through the skin for 3x. The estimated total-body exposure, due to re-
leases from a 6-ton/day plant, is about 90 millirems/year for the standard

man residing in Oak Ridge.

and other factors, established, as its basic recommendation, that the
annual radiation exposure to the whole bodies of individuals in the
general population (exclusive of natural background or medical exposures)
should not exceed 0.5 rem.” In the event of widespread radioactive con-
tamination, and because of uncertainties in the relationship between
average and maximum exposure, the FRC suggests the use of the arbitrary
assumption that the majority of individuals do not vary from the average
by a factor greater than 3, Thus, the use of 0,17 rem for the annual
whole-body exposure of average population groups is recommended. When
the size of the population group under consideration is sufficiently
large, consideration must also be given to the contribution of the genet-
ically significant population dose. According to the FRC,

"The use of 0.17 rem per capita per year, as described in
paragraph 5.l, as a technique for assuring that the basic
Guide for individual whole body dose is not exceeded, is
likely in the immediate future to assure that the gonadal
exposure Guide is not exceeded."

These guides are essentially in agreement with current recommendations
of the ICRP and NCRP. Each agency also encourages that every reasonable
effort be made to keep exposures as far below the offered guidance as

practicable.

In current reports, the ICRP and NCRP list the total body as the

critical organ and submersion in a semispherical infinite cloud of radio-

85ky, 85k

basic recommendations in effect at the time these reports were published

active gas as the critical mode of exposure for However, the
considered the whole body and the blood-forming organs as a unit, and, as
mentioned above, even the genetic dose was partially related to whole-
body dose. Because of the rather short range of the beta radiation from
85kr, only a small fraction of the total mass of the blood-forming organs
or the testes would be exposed to a significant part of the beta dose to
skin; however, this might be as much as 1 g of red marrow (e.g., in the
skull). The mass of 1 g was previously used as a basis for dose assess-
ment, 42 In later publications of the ICRP, the principle of averaging
the dose over organs and tissues is stated without qualification. This

penetrate well below the skin layer, as shown subsequently, a significant

principle would permit a higher dose. Since the beta radiation does
8-3L

volume of body tissue would be irradiated at 50% or greater of the surface
skin dose. If this tissue is to be limited to 1.5 rems per year, an

increase by about a factor of 3 or slightly more might be warranted.

Krypton-85 decays principally by emitting a 0.5l4-Mev photon 0.7% of

the time and a beta particle of 0.695 Mev maximum energy 99.3% of the
L7

body submerged in a semispherical infinite cloud containing 85k r is com-

time, Calculations indicate that the total dose at the surface of a
posed of about 99% beta and 1% gamma. The ranges in tissue of the beta
rays of maximum and average energy are estimated to be 2.6 mm and 0.55 mm
respectively. A considerable fraction of the beta particle energy will
be deposited, on the average, in the epidermal (range in thickness, 0.023
to 0.070 mm) and dermal (average thickness, 0.70 mm) layers of the skin
of the total body. 8 Thus, there is reason to reevaluate the total body
as the critical organ from submersion exposure to 85 as a function of

depth-dose relationships.

85 and 3g from a fuel reprocessing
plant sited at ORNL, 85¢r would be of greater dose potential to man than

For the complete release of

3, Of the modes of exposure considered, submersion in contaminated air
would deliver the largest dose, that is, about 90 millirems per year for
a 6-ton/day plant. As explained above, current guidance for total-body
exposure to 85kr limits the maximum permissible dose of individuals in
the general population to 500 millirems per year (and of average popula-

tion groups to 170 millirems per year).

The potential dose resulting from the release of 3g in liquid waste
is small because credit can be taken for dilution in the Clinch River in
which flow is substantial (4919 £13 /sec) and the river is not used as a
source of municipal water. Dose estimates by the ingestion of water
(10 millirems annually) at ORGDP would increase in direct proportion to
a reduction in flow rate and increase by a factor of 3 if the water were
used as a municipal water supply. Disposal of 3y in water vapor released
to the stack may be one way to reduce the potential exposure from ingestion

of water.
8-35

Economic benefits would be expected to accrue from large processing
plants, but remote siting may not be a practical method for restricting
population exposures in the future. This is the justification, therefore,
to continue research and development studies, now in progress, to reduce
the amounts of 85k x and 3g released and to understand more completely the

fate of these radionuclides after discharge to the environment.

8.2.3 Local Envirommental Consequences from All Routine Releases

 

Although the routine releases of 85%r and 3y were emphasized in the
preceding section, the absolute removal of all other radioactive materials
from gases and vapors prior to discharge to the atmosphere is impractical.
Of the remaining radionuclides, 131; is known to be important because of
reconcentration that occurs in the grass-cow-milk pathway to the thyroids of
small children. Less experimental information is available on the behavior
of 1291 in the environment, but the assumption will be made that the grass-
cow-milk pathway is the dominant mode of exposure from this radioisotope.
The controlling pathways for exposure from particulates of mixed fission
products and actinides are, also, not well understood. However, it is
known that, under some circumstances, such effects as reconcentration in
fish or crops and resuspension may be important. In this analysis, it
will be assumed that the major exposures from the atmospheric release of

particulates will result from direct inhalation of the contaminated air.

Based on the results of the preceding section, it will be assumed
that the maximum acceptable average annual concentrations of 85% and 3
in air at the boundary of a fuel reprocessing plant site are 1 x 1077 and
7 x 1078 curies/m respectively. These are the values recommended by
10CFR20, Appendix B, Column IT, and correspond to annual whole-body
exposures of 170 millirems. Experimental evidence has suggested that
the average annual concentration of TOLI in air, as provided by 10CFR20,
should be reduced by a factor of about 700 to account for deposition
followed by the grass-cow-milk pathway. td It is assumed that this same
reconcentration factor of 700 should be applied to 1291 but that, in
addition, another factor of 10 is required to account for the relatively

longer effective half-life of 1297 on grass. Consequently, the assumed
8-36

131; and 129; at the

maximum acceptable average annual concentrations of
site boundary are 1 x 10710700, or 1. x 10733
2 x 10711/700/10, or 3 x 107° curie/m>, respectively. The assumed

acceptable average annual air concentrations of particulates containing

curie/m, and

mixtures of radionuclides are weighted average values that were derived
using one-third of the 10CFR20 concentrations for specific nuclides and
relative radionuclide concentrations from Table 8.3. These assumed values
are 1 x 10710
3x 10710

L x 10713 curie/m for the mixed actinides from either type of fuel.

curie/m> for mixed fission products from the LWR fuel,

curie/m for the mixed fission products from FBR fuel, and

Maximum site boundary distances dictated by the routine release of
radionuclides to the atmosphere were estimated by assuming average annual
concentration parameters that prevail in the direction northeast of ORNL
(Fig. 8.5). Figure 8.8 compares this concentration parameter for the
northeast direction at ORNL with corresponding parameters that have been
estimated for the Hanford, >°, wrTs, >t and Savannah River Sites. The
dashed curve labeled "I!" shows the concentration parameter for iodine at
ORNL that would result if the iodine were depleted from the plume with a
deposition velocity of 0.0L m/sec.’? The ORNL, Hanford, and NRTS data
presented in Fig. 8.8 are based on meteorological calculations averaged
over annual-weather conditions, but they are known to be reasomable based
on long-term environmental monitoring studies. The Savannah River data
are derived from results of air sampling studies for 131; made at the
site boundary over a period of one year. The Savannah River data reflect

the depletion of iodine in the plume.

Table 8.6 presents estimates of the site boundary distances and
resultant average annual concentrations of the various species of radio-
nuclides that would be dictated by routine releases from conceptual IWR
and FBR plants sited at ORNL. These estimates assume that the plume is
not depleted by deposition, fallout, and washout. Table 8.6 also gives
estimates of the average annual concentrations of radionuclides at the
site boundaries of the NFS, MFRP,2? and BNFP® plants. These latter
results were taken from the Safety Analysis Reports for the three plants;

thus the assumptions made in the calculations are not necessarily the same

as those employed for the present analysis of conceptual plants, The com-
parisons are of value in that they reflect the range of results that can
be obtained through the use of various assumptions and computational
techniques, as well as point out differences that may exist in meteorolog-

ical conditions from site to site,

The large site boundary distances that are estimated for plants of
high capacity provide incentive for removal of a larger fraction of the
noble gases and iodine than was assumed in Sect. 8.2.1. This will be
considered further in Sect. 8.l after estimates are presented of the site

boundary distances that are dictated by upper limit accidents.
8.3 Accidental Releases of Radioactive Materials

Fuel processing plants utilize three barriers for the confinement of
radioactive materials. Accidents may cause the primary barrier to fail
and, in turn, radioactive gas, liquid, or aerosol (usually under pressure)
to be discharged to the second barrier. The first confinement barrier
consists of the process vessels, the associated interconnecting piping,
and the highly efficient vessel off-gas train. The second barrier is the
thick concrete cell wall, which is designed to provide radiation shielding
and to limit the effect of the maximum explosion in a process vessel within
the cell to minor leakage of air or gas to the third barrier, The latter
barrier, an industrial building, surrounds all penetrations in the cell
walls. Under normal conditions, outside air is drawn into the building
through (1) a roughing filter, (2) a check valve and another roughing
filter to the cells, and (3) a ventilation duct (where it mixes with the
effluent from the off-gas train) and HEPA or deep-bed filter to blowers,
which exhaust to a stack. Normally a portion of the ventilation air from
the building does not pass through the cells but flows directly, through
a suitable restriction, to the upstream side of the filters. In an acci-
dent situation, in which one or more cells may become pressurized, this
latter flow tends to maintain the building at a negative pressure with
respect to the environment. Glove-box facilities have three barriers -
the box, the laboratory, and the building — which have comparable confine-
ment potential to the vessel, cell, and building. Mobile materials in

storage canals are confined by a container, the water, and a building.
8-40

Potentially, liquid waste management facilities also have three
barriers of confinement - the tank, a vault, and a building. In present
practice, however, massive failure of the tank (such as by a hydrogen-air
explosion in the vapor space), resulting in significant pressurization of
the vault, is not considered credible because of the assumed reliability
of preventive measures; therefore, the third barrier (a backup floor pan
and a building) may not be considered necessary. By making the more pessi-
mistic assumption that a hydrogen-air explosion in a waste tank is credible,
it is assumed in this study that either the waste tank or the vault (which
is possibly vented through a large pipe to other vaults or to cells of the
processing plant) is designed to contain the explosion (a maximum of ~100
psig in the vapor space of the tank), resulting in only minor leakage that

is confined to a building and routed through a filtered ventilation system.

The following basic assumptions were made for the purpose of assessing

the effects of credible accidents in fuel reprocessing plants:

(1) The secondary containment barrier (cell, vault, water in the
storage pool, and ventilation-filter system) and the building
can, and will be, designed to maintain their confinement

potential following exposure to any credible internal forces.

(2) Process and confinement systems can, and will be, designed in
such a manner that exposure to credible external events or
forces (loss of power, earthquake, tornado, flood, hurricane,
impaction by moving vehicles, etc., but not including acts of
war) will not impair the ability to shut down the plant safely

and maintain safe shutdown conditions.

The following sections will describe more detailed assumptions that
have been made with respect to the properties of fuel reprocessing plants
and waste management facilities, estimates of the fractiomal release of
radioactive materials resulting from accidents, a model for the assessment
of downwind consequences of a release, and implications of the estimated

dose rates as a function of distance downwind,
8-L1

8.3.1 Assumed Properties of Fuel Reprocessing Plants

Properties of fuel reprocessing plants as a function of capacity (see
Table 8.7) have been assumed for the purpose of estimating the fractional
release of radioactive materials in the event of an accident. With a few
exceptions, the containment and confinement features that were selected
represent either present or only moderate extensions of current technology.
Future large-capacity plants will, undoubtedly, have many properties
different from those selected; however, it is assumed that the important
derived numbers (i.e., the quantities of radioactive materials released

in accidents) will remain unchanged or decrease with advancing technology.

The assumed properties are for central plants processing spent fuels
from light water (IWR) or fast breeder (FBR) reactors employing unit oper-
ations of chop-leach, solvent extraction, and ion exchange. A schematic
drawing of the type of plant that is assumed is shown in Fig, 8.9. It is
assumed that spent fuels are stored prior to processing in water-filled
canals. High-level wastes are assumed to be either pot-calcined immediately
and stored in water-filled canals for two years prior to shipment or stored
for two years in an acid solution and then calcined prior to shipment.
Low-level wastes are assumed to be discharged predominantly to the atmos-
phere. Intermediate-level wastes (spent solvent, resins, etc.) are assumed
to be fixed in asphalt, polyethylene, or concrete; and hulls are assumed

to be stored in vaults in relatively small containers,

Process Equipment. - It is assumed that the concentrations of fuel
(U + Pu) in aqueous solutions in the head ends of the IWR and FBR plants
are 0.3 and 0.1 metric ton/m> respectively. The volume of fuel solution
in a single vessel was kept rzlatively small, 3 to 30 w, by assuming that
the relative processing rate will have increased by a factor of 3 (because
of more continuous equipment) by the time that 18-metric ton/day IWR plants
or 9-metric ton/day FBR plants are built, and that the 36-metric ton/day
plants for IWR and FBR fuels consist, respectively, of two 18-metric ton/day
and four 9-metric ton/day independent modules. Multiple tanks of these
assumed sizes, in separate compartments to prevent interaction in the
event of an accident, would be employed if additional capacity is needed

for head-end equipment (dissolver, and accountability and solvent extrac-

withstand a sustained pressure of 30 to 50 psig or the detonation of 25
to 50 1b of TNT at their geometric centers without rupture. It is assumed
that 7 cells are used in small plants; however, more compartments (i.e.,
1 cells per process line) are used in plants having capacities greater

than 6 metric tons/day.

Vessel Off-Gas System. - Present technology, with a trend toward

 

relatively lower off-gas flow rates per unit of plant capacity, is
assumed for LWR plants, It is also assumed that FBR plants will be
designed to minimize the vessel off-gas flow rate to approximately 70
cfm in a l-metric ton/day plant and that this flow will vary directly
with plant capacity but inversely with relative processing rate, The
off-gas is assumed to pass through a train (wet scrubber, solid halogen
absorber, and filter) to effect partial removal of iodine, semivolatile
fission products, and particulates and to discharge to the ventilation
system on the upstream side of the ventilation filter. It is assumed
that the wet scrubber serves to retain about 93% of the iodine in a
relatively nondispersible form and that the off-gas train for FBR plants

7

will include devices which will provide a cumulative DF of 10' for iodine.

Ventilation System. - The ventilation air exhaust is assumed to
consist of the air flow from the cells (at 0.2 air change per min) plus
an additional 50% that flows directly from the building (third containment
barrier). This stream is filtered, passed through metal mesh or silica
gel for 99.5% removal of ruthenium vapors, and finally exhausted to the
atmosphere through a 100-m-tall stack. In addition, the FBR plant is
assumed to be equipped with activated charcoal filters for 99% removal

of iodine. The filter system is assumed to be composed of either a sand
8-L5

filter or roughing and HEPA filters with equivalent reliability and
integrity. Independent process lines are assumed to have independent

ventilation systems.

Facility for Interim Storage of Liquid Wastes. - The interim liquid

 

waste storage facility is assumed to provide for two-year storage of
acid waste (at a concentration of 0,01 gal per Mwd of burnup) consistent
with a maximum tank size (80% filled) of 1,000,000 gal and at least 30%
spare tankage. The off-gas stream — 1000 cfm for a 1,000,000-gal tank —
is assumed to pass, first, through a condenser (which would condense and
recycle the distillate to the tank in the event of loss of coolant), then
through a filter, and finally be discharged to the ventilation system
for the vault. The latter ventilation system collects the small purge
flow from each tank vault (plus the canbined off-gas from all tanks) and
discharges it through a backup condenser, filter, and ruthenium removal
device to a 100-m stack. The tanks and/or the vault are assumed to be
designed to withstand a hydrogen-air explosion (an internal pressure of
~100 psi) without rupture, possibly by venting to other tanks or vaults.
The tanks, vaults, and ventilation system are assumed to be designed to

withstand the effects of the maximum earthquake,

Canal for Interim Storage of Waste Solids. - The canal for interim

 

storage of waste solids (i.e., calcined waste) is assumed to provide for
a two-year accumulation of 6-in,-diam by 10-ft-long pots, each containing
fission products from 14,100 Mwd of burnup at an average solids concen-
tration of 1.0 x 107k £3 Mad, The pots are assumed to be covered with
at least 20 ft of water. The ventilation system for the canal and build-
ing provides 12 air changes per hour to minimize fog formation. The
ventilation system is assumed to be exhausted through a dehumidifier and
HEPA filters at the roof of the building.

8.3.2 Analytical Models and Mechanisms of Accidental Release

Mechanisms that tend to negate the primary confinement barrier (proc-
ess vessels, associated piping, and the efficient, low-flow off-gas system)
have the potential of releasing radioactive materials to the atmosphere

through the ventilation system. The following sections will describe
8-L6

models for predicting the fractional release, discuss dispersive mecha-
nisms, and present estimates of the fractional release to the atmosphere

from upper limit accidents.

The designs of models for the release of radioactive materials depend
on whether the material is released to the ventilation system as a gas

(or vapor) or as an aerosol.

Gas or Vapor, - Certain of the fission products (the noble gases,
halogens, and semivolatiles) may escape from the primary containment
barrier in gaseous form, The release to the environment from such
sources is relatively easy to predict; it is the fractional release from
the vessel mitigated by the removal efficiency of the devices in the

85¢r

and 133%e, may be released essentially quantitatively from process vessels,

ventilation train, The noble-gas fission products, dominated by

Devices for partial removal of noble-gas fission products are not used in
present commercial reprocessing plants, but several types of devices have
been proposed for this application,>t?53 The halogens, dominated by 131;
and 1291, may be volatilized from process operations as Ls HL, or
organic iodides. Since these compounds have high vapor pressures at
room temperature, they are not appreciably removed by filtration,
Usually, activated charcoal filters may be relied upon to remove 99% of
the iodine from a ventilation stream, especially if most of the iodine

is in the form of I, or HI (the typical forms released from most process

operations).

Certain other fission products, notably (in approximate order of
importance) Ru, Cs, Te, Tc, and Se, may be classed as semivolatiles since
gases or vapors of these elements may result from certain abnormal process
operations. The oxides of Se and Tc are completely volatilized at temp-
eratures in the vicinity of 200°C, while the normal oxides of Ru, Cs, and
Te require temperatures generally greater than 750°¢. 5k Under highly
oxidizing conditions in acid solutions, ruthenium may form the tetroxide,
which has a boiling temperature of approximately 80°C. A slight excess
of Kno) in an acid uranyl nitrate solution at 80°C will result in the
volatilization of 70 to 80% of the contained ruthenium in 5 to 10 min, >>

For this reason, highly oxidizing conditions are avoided in present fuel
8-L7

reprocessing plants. Evaporation and complete boildown of a nitric acid
solution of fission products will result in the volatilization of 10 to
20% of the ruthenium, 02>" Once airborne, the vapor tends to rapidly
deposit on metal surfaces and decompose to the relatively nonvolatile
dioxide. For this reason, a "bucket of Brillo" (i.e., a tank packed
with stainless steel mesh) has been found to be effective for removing
ruthenium from off-gas and ventilation streams at the Savannah River
Plant, Silica gel absorbers, operating at about 70°C, were found to

58

remove 99.6% of the ruthenium from waste calciner off-gas at Idaho.

Radioactive Aerosols, - The aerosol that would be dispersed in cell

 

air by an accident would consist of a dispersion of a radioactive solu-
tion, solid particles, or smoke. The physical properties of aerosols are
such that they effectively restrict the escape of radioactive particles
to the enviromment, This is seen commonly in practice since, through the
use of appropriate deentrainment mechanisms, the condensate from the

l

to 107° of the activity of the solution. Gravitational settling serves

evaporation of a radioactive solution may be made to contain only 10°

to limit the maximum aerosol concentration; we have been able to demon-
strate this through an approximate correlation of the solution concentra-
tion in air or vapor arising from cooling towers, evaporators, and air-

sparged vessels.”’ This correlation is shown in Fig. 8.10.

In order to properly describe the release of aerosols from a cell,
we must be able to ascribe removal efficlencies to filters and to cracks
in cell walls. For superficial velocities less than approximately
0.15 ft/sec, it has been found that an aerosol formed by vigorous mixing
of a solution with air is metastable and has a concentration of the order
of 10 mg/m. This metastable concentration is approximately equivalent
to fog, which has a concentration of approximately 10 mg/m and a particle
size of approximately 10 y. For orientational purposes, a l-in./hr rain
with a mass mean particle size of 3000 y has a concentration of 1000 mg/m.
At ORNL, 0 the particle size distribution of the metastable aerosol in a
ventilation stream downstream from the source has consistently been found
to have the particle size distribution shown in Fig. 8.11. Another piece

of relevant information reported by Garner®® is that the weight distribu-

8-50

tion of particles smaller than 10 to 20 , will be fairly constant, even
if there is gross entrainment of larger droplets. The knowledge that
this distribution is fairly constant and constitutes approximately 10
mg/m may be used to estimate the approximate concentration of particles
smaller than a given size, even in an air stream which is very concen-
trated with liquid droplets. Practically, it is possible to assign
efficiencies to an absolute filter and calculate the effluent concen-

tration.

In evaluating the concentration of aerosols in air which leaks from
a cell, it is considered that the aerosol must follow many small tortuous
paths in its escape through 5 ft of concrete. The evaporator deentrain-
ment studies by Walsh and Schlea® indicate that a single right-angle
impingement will reduce a liquid aerosol concentration to 10 mg/m" or
less. Fine heavy-element dust would be reduced to the order of 1 mg/m,
and the concentration of smoke in leaked air would probably be no more
than approximately 100 mg/m. These numbers are primarily of use in
estimating the radiation dose to plant operating personnel. Essentially
all of the material. that escapes from the cells through cracks during a
period of temporary pressurization would be routed through the filtered

cell ventilation system.

Junge? and Friedlander’ have observed that the particle size
distribution of airborne aerosols is remarkably constant or "self-
preserving.” Small particles tend to agglomerate rapidly by Brownian
motion, while large particles are removed by impingement or sedimentation,
Friedlander suggests that a quasi-stationary state exists such that the
rate at which matter enters a differential size is equal to the rate at
which matter is lost by sedimentation. It has also been determined that
the stable concentration of small particles (less than about 3 uw in
diameter), because of agglomeration, is consistently less than a few
grams per cubic meter after the aerosol has been permitted to "age! for

6-66

a few seconds or minutes. Friedlander has proposed the following
formulation for the differential concentration of particles in a

metastable aerosol as a function of size:
8-51

dn = kr dr (6)

where

n = number of particles per unit volume,

k’ = a constant,

r = radius of the particle,

iI

a = a constant with a value of ~-1 to -1.5.

By converting to a mass concentration and integrating from r = 0 to

r =r, the concentration of particles with less than a given diameter is:

another constant.

It has been found that agglomerates, even of dense particles, have

a density of approximately 1 a/cn’.07

A related expression may be derived using the largely substantiated
expression for the rate of agglomeration of an aerosol containing part-

icles of a single size:

From this expression, the initial concentration, Co, of particles

having a diameter Do and a half-life of to is:

Co = 3 Doo (9)
Kt *

1/2
8-52

Assuming a half-life of 10 min and converting to appropriate units,

this expression becomes:

Co 97000D0™ Do < 0.3 (10)

Co = 2900pDo’ Co > 0.3 (11)

These expressions for aerosol concentration are compared with experi-
mental data for a wide variety of heavily concentrated and turbulent
aerosols (smoke, flyash, DOP, etc. in air, and water droplets in air and
steam) in Fig. 8.12. Expressions (10) and (11), for concentrations of
monodispersed aerosols with a half-life of 10 min, provide a practical
upper bound for the concentrations of solid particles in air. A better
description of aerosols containing liquid particles, is provided by

expression (7) when a is approximately equal to -2.

Based on the maximum concentration of particulates as a function of
particle size (see Fig. 8.12) and assuming that the efficiency of deep-
bed sand or HEPA filters is 100% for particles 0.3 yu in diameter, the
predicted concentration of particles in the effluent from absolute filters
is 0.02 mg/m. Cheever determined experimentally that the maximum concen-
tration of plutonium particles in the effluent from a 30-in.-deep sand
filter, occurring at the optimum superficial velocity for a penetration
of 4.8 ft/min, was 0,02 mg/m> (ref. 68). This experiment was performed
under conditions that are very unlikely to occur in accident situations;
the filter influent concentration was 100 mg/m’, and the count-mean
particle size was only 0.07 , because the aerosol had aged for only a
few seconds. Cheever also found that an HEPA filter removed an additional
99% of the particles in the effluent from the sand filter. From these
data and known characteristics of filter systems, it is assumed that
filter effluent concentrations of 0,02 mg /m> or less are attainable in

practice, regardless of the mass concentration of the influent.

The release of radioactive material through the cell ventilation
system by a mechanism that generates aerosols is estimated to be as
follows:

ally with a mean life of FV, (which is assumed to be 5 min).

Dispersive Mechanisms. - Mechanisms for the dispersion of gases and

 

aerosols in cells include chemical explosions, fires, nuclear excursions,
and leakage. Some properties of explosions relative to the containment
potential of cells are shown in Table 8.8. All of the quantities of the
limiting explosive materials are very large as compared with their credible
inventories in a process vessel. The allowable quantities are even larger
if the cells are vented to another confinement zone of large volume (i.e.,
the cell-canyon concept used at Hanford and planned for MFRP). It is
assumed to be incredible that the cell would first fill with hydrogen or
solvent vapor and then explode. The flow rate of cell ventilation air is

sufficient to dilute any radiolytic H,-0,.

The most serious fires in a fuel processing plant would be those

involving plutonium, that is, solvent or ion exchange resin loaded with

plutonium. Purex-type solvent will burn at the rate of about 1 in. of
depth per hour and generate approximately 20,000 Btu/hr per £12 of burning
surface. Experience in gloved enclosures has shown that fires covering
the entire area of the floor of the enclosure tend to self-extinguish in

a matter of minutes because of depletion of the oxygen. This has been
true even in well-ventilated enclosures because the pressure increases to
several inches of water and reverses the flow through the intake. It has
been observed that ion exchange resin loaded with plutonium nitrate can
ignite spontaneously at about 120°C and burn (in the absence of air),
liberating about 540 Btu/lb.

Experience has shown that the initial burst resulting from a super
prompt-critical nuclear excursion in a solution is limited to a maximum
of 101? fissions per mn of solution, ®? At this fission density, the void
coefficient caused by the generation of radiolytic gas (~1.4 mn of gas,

3

at STP, per m~ of solution) is sufficient to override the effect of high
reactivity addition rates. Assuming that the temperature of the solution
is 85°F (the yield would be lower if the temperature were higher), this
burst would increase the temperature to boiling. If the solution is not
rendered permanently subcritical by the initial or succeeding bursts or
by ejection of solution, it may possibly boil to dryness. The dried
solids, if not subcritical because of low density and lack of moderation,

probably would be dispersed by one last burst.

Assuming that all of the solution in an equilateral cylinder with a
volume Vn is involved in a nuclear excursion, the upper limit yield of
the initial burst (and probably the most powerful burst, resulting in the

generation of a radiolytic gas void fraction, at STP, of 1.4) is 101? Vv

fissions. When boiling begins, the steam void coefficient (2.3 x 10
m3/ fission) (ref. 70) would limit individual bursts to approximately
6.1 x 1018 fissions/m-. Since the height of the solution in the tank is

1.08 v1/3, and the bubble rise rate is about 12 m/min, the period between
bursts is approximately 0.09 V/3 mi

The sudden generation of radiolytic gas or steam in the solution

tank. An overestimate of the maximum amount of work that can be done in
deforming the vessel, taking no credit for free expansion into the vapor

space of the tank, may be calculated +

assuming that the liquid and gas
expand reversibly against the plastic flow pressure of the vessel. Assum-
ing a gas void fraction (at STP) of 1.lL per burst, no more than about 0.5%
of the energy released in the burst could do pressure-volume work against
a resisting pressure of 200 psig. An unrestrained cylindrical tank of
characteristics assumed in this study could, theoretically, withstand
repeated bursts without rupture. [The rupture strain of 30LL stainless

steel is 0.65 (ref. 71)].

8.3.3 Method of Analysis of the Downwind Consequences of a Unit Release

 

of Radioactive Material

 

The method that has been selected for investigation of the environ-
mental consequences of an accidental release of radioactive material from
a fuel reprocessing plant consists, first, of the examination of a "unit"
release of activity and, second, the application of the resulting data to

actual releases which could be expected from the various credible accidents.

Two different mixtures of isotopes have been considered, These
mixtures (listed in Table 8.3) simulate the fission product and actinide
contents of typical spent LWR fuel and LMFBR core and blanket fuel mixtures
which will actually be encountered. It 1s assumed that the LWR fuel has
decayed for 150 days prior to processing and that the LMFBR material has
decayed for 30 days.

For these mixtures, a "unit" release is defined to be the release of
all materials that are associated with 1 kg of fuel; therefore, the funda-
mental calculations have been performed on this basis. Initially, no
provision is made for differences in the chemical or physical behavior of
the various isotopes, and it is assumed that all of the components in a
unit release escape. However, as will be shown, it is possible to treat
differences in behavior and thus account for variations in the release
fraction due to filtration, chemical reactions, and other processes that

affect some of the components but not others.
8-58

We have investigated both the external gamma dose and the external
beta dose that result from direct exposure to the radiation flux origi-
nating in the plume and from the internal radiation dose received as a
result of the inhalation of radioactive material by a receptor submerged
in the plume. The calculation of both types of doses depends on a know-
ledge of the concentration of radioactive material in the plume as a
function of time and space. The concentrations have been computed by

72

using the "Gaussian Plume" formula'® and by utilizing the source term and
ground reflection correction described by Binford, Barish, and Kam, [2 The
source term is derived using the assumption that a unit quantity of radio-
active material is released into the processing building, where it is
instantly and uniformly mixed with the air in the building. It is further
assumed that a constant fraction of the building volume is being discharged
from the stack per unit time, These assumptions lead to the following
expression for the concentration at the space point (x,y,z), relative to

an origin of Cartesian coordinates at the stack orifice, and at time

after the release has occurred:

respectively, (m),

a = exhaust rate, (min™1),

8-59

Decay will be neglected for the mixtures under consideration so that
» is set equal to zero, Moreover, the value of the concentration at the
plume center line (y = 0) at ground level (z = -h) is of great interest.

Under these conditions,

This expression is proportional to the inhalation dose rate at ground
level at the plume center line and very nearly proportional to the

proportional to the total dose. This integral,

is independent of a, the exhaust rate.

The dispersion parameters a, (x) and a, (x) are monotonic increasing
functions of the downwind distance, x; however, they also vary with atmos-
pheric stability. For a given value of x, the dispersion parameters
decrease with increasing stability. It is, therefore, necessary to specify
the degree of atmospheric stability in order to select the appropriate
set of values for the parameters, For the purpose of investigating the

external doses, two sets of atmospheric conditions have been utilized:

(1) ™ost Representative Conditions," where the wind speed has been
chosen to be 100 m/min (3.73 mph) and slightly unstable (C) con-

ditions are assumed to prevail,

(2) "Inversion Conditions," where the wind speed is 50 m/min (1.86 mph),
moderately stable (F) conditions prevail, and an inversion "lid"
exists just above the stack orifice. To account for the latter, the
vertical dispersion parameter is modified by being held constant once
it reaches the value 3, (x) = h/2.15 (see ref. 72).
8-60

Many other combinations of wind speed and stability conditions are
possible; however, it is believed that these two are reasonably typical,
cover most of the likely situations that may arise, and permit valid inter-

polation to other cases which lie in between.

The inhalation doses have been computed on a somewhat more comprehen-
sive basis. As suggested above, many different combinations of wind speed
and stability conditions are possible. Thus the inhalation doses have been
computed for each of six different stability conditions, the results have
been plotted on a single graph, and the envelope of the curves thus obtained
have been utilized to estimate the inhalation dose to be expected at each

ground level point downwind on the plume center line,

In all cases, it is assumed that the effective stack height, h, is
100 m. (The effect of stack height on ground-level concentration will be
discussed in detail in a later section.) Finally, it should be pointed
out that all of the doses computed below assume exposure of the receptor

during the entire course of the accident.

External Beta and Gamma Doses. - These doses stem from direct exposure

 

of the receptor to the radiation flux in the plume. Because of their short

range, only the beta particles that originate in the vicinity of the receptor

contribute to the dose. Hence, the dose rate may be assumed to be propor-
tional to the concentration of beta emitters at the location of the recep-
tor. 13 The gamma dose, on the other hand, requires a space integration

over the entire volume of the cloud in order to sum the photon flux incident

on the receptor.

The computer program PLUME, [2

which was originally developed in order
to calculate internal iodine and external iodine and noble-gas doses
following a reactor accident was used to perform these calculations. Input
for the beta dose calculation is the average energy per disintegration, the
equivalent number of curies, and a numerical constant to convert Mev/m>
into dose units. Input for the gamma calculation consists of the gamma-
emitting inventory, divided into nine energy groups, and the appropriate
cross sections and buildup factor parameters. The results are displayed

in Figs. 8.13 and 8,1. Note that, in these cases, there is no physical

assumed to behave similarly.

Inhalation Dose Calculations. - These radiation doses result from

 

inhalation of the contaminated air in the plume and from subsequent depo-
sition of radioactive material in the various organs of the body. The
rate of intake of radioactive material is proportional to the breathing
rate and to the concentration of the radioactive material at the location
of the receptor. The total intake is simply the time integral of the
product of these two quantities. For the purpose of these calculations,
it will be assumed that the receptor is located at ground level on the
center line of the plume and that the exposure lasts for the duration of
the accident so that the intake rate is integrated over infinite time.

If the breathing rate is assumed to be constant, the total intake is:

n° /25
I= fae curies , (16)

u
hs OJ

where B is the breathing rate in mo/min and the other symbols are as
defined previously. For this study, B has been taken to be 2.08 x 107°
m3 min. The quantity I/q is the total amount of activity inhaled per

curie of originally released material.

It should be noted that the spatial variation of the inhalation dose
is independent of the amount of released material, the wind speed, and the
breathing rate. Thus, for a given wind speed, breathing rate, and quantity
of material released, the expression

n%/25°
3 = (17)
IT,
is the same function of x, regardless of the amount of material that is
released. This function, normalized to unity at its maximum value, has
been plotted in Fig. 8.15 for each of the six stability conditions. An
envelope enclosing the six curves has been drawn; this envelope permits
estimations of the dose at each point downwind by using a knowledge of

the dose at any given point.

The dose at 400 m under A (extremely unstable) conditions is the
maximum and has been chosen for reference, At a wind speed of 100 m/min,
the total intake following the release described above is 4.3 x 1073 uC
per curie released. This factor has been utilized as input data for a
computer program Time, TH which, given the quantity of radioactive material
inhaled, computes the dose to the most important organs as a function of
time after inhalation, The program takes into consideration uptake by the
various organs, effective half-life, and the age of the receptor, which,

for this study, was chosen to be 20 years.

The INREM Computer Code. - The rate of intake of radioactivity is
the primary radioactivity input for calculating the cumulative dose
equivalents by the INREM Code. These estimates of dose are compiled for
the various body organs from inhalation or ingestion of radioactivity
programmed as continuous or intermittent intakes as a function of age.
The parameters in the dose equations change as a function of time as the
person ages during the time of intake or during the period of interest
(which may be longer than the period of intake). This code, as currently
dimensioned, has the capacity to handle 110 radionuclides and 11 body
organs, The model, programmed for all organs except the gastrointestinal

(GI) tract, is written as follows:

nuclide in the nth organ at t.

The variables ts tos Ys

whereas the variables I(t), m_(t), £54), ein(t)s and Ant) are functions

t, and s are measured relative to release,

of the age of the individual. The code uses Eq. (18) for ingestion of con-
taminated food and water, or inhalation of contaminated air, and calculates

the cumulative doses to all organs except the GI tract.

When the age-dependent cumulative dose equivalents to the GI tract
are to be calculated, the (MPC), or (MPC) is used in the following way:

nuclide in the critical segment of the GI tract in

the gth age group,

Calculations were made with the INREM code to determine the dose
commitment for the first year following inhalation (which, in this model,
is the highest annual dose commitment) and also the dose commitment for a

period of 50 years following the intake. The complete output data from
8-68

INREM have been reproduced in Tables 8.9 through 8.12. The results at
LOO m were then utilized to obtain the doses at each point downwind by

means of the generalized curve of Fig. 8.15.

In order to allow for differences in chemical and physical behavior
of the various isotopes, the isotopes may be divided roughly into cate-

gories, depending upon their volatilities, as follows:
1. Volatile fission products: noble gases, halogens, tritium
2. Semivolatile fission products: Ru, Te, Cs, Tc, Se
3, Nonvolatile fission products: all other fission products
Li. Nonvolatile actinides: plutonium and transplutonic elements

The dose commitment to the various organs, as well as to the whole body,

by these categories is given in Table 8.13.

Deposition. - In all of the foregoing calculations, it has been
tacitly assumed that there is no depletion of the plume by deposition,
fallout, or rainout. Consequently, the results thus far obtained are
conservative in that some depletion of the plume due to these mechanisms
will occur. On the other hand, the deposition of relatively large quanti-
ties of an extremely toxic substance, such as P0sr or plutonium, on the
ground in and around a highly populated area may give rise to a serious

69

hazard.

Criticality Accidents. - One possible cause of a serious accident in

 

a fuel reprocessing plant is inadvertent criticality that results in a
nuclear excursion. Aside from damaging mechanical effects, such an
accident would augment the inventory of fission products to an extent

depending on the number of fissions taking place during the excursion,

In order to assess the additional radiation doses that would result

18

from such an incident, a "unit" nuclear excursion of 3.7 x 107 fissions
has been investigated. The iodine isotopes and the noble gases and their
daughters were considered to be of primary importance. The internal dose
due to iodine and the external dose due to both iodine and noble gases
plus their daughters, have been calculated for both the "most representa-

tive!” and "inversion conditions, using the PLUME computer program. 2

The input data for this calculation are presented in Table 8.1L, and the

results are given in Fig. 8.16.

In some instances, iodine may be retained on a charcoal filter; in i"
such cases the thyroid dose shown in Fig. 8.16 would be reduced by a
factor equal to one minus the filter efficiency. For very efficient
filters, virtually all of the iodine would be retained; the whole-body
dose would then be due only to the noble gases produced during the excur-
sion and to those that result from the decay of the iodines trapped on
the filter. The external gamma-ray dose delivered due to noble gases

alone is shown in Fig. 8.17. ’

Validity of These Calculations. - The foregoing methods for estimat-

 

ing the downwind radiation doses following a nuclear accident have been

developed using the "Gaussian Plume” model, 123° Implicit in this deriva-
tion are the assumptions that the degree of atmospheric stability, the r
wind speed, and the wind direction remain unchanged during the entire -

course of the incident,

Although the results have, in most cases, been extrapolated to a
distance of 100 km from the stack, it is extremely doubtful whether this
model is valid for distances of more than 20 or 30 km. At a speed of
100 m/min, it would require 17 hr for the plume to extend for a distance
of 100 km. However, it is almost certain that variations of the weather

conditions, both with time and distance, would occur.

Moreover, the model also assumes flat, featureless terrain and does
not take into account the various topographical features such as hills,
valleys, and lakes. No provision is made for the presence of buildings
and other structures, which may affect the behavior of the effluent either
because of proximity to the emitting source or because of modification of
the behavior of the plume in the vicinity of the receptor. Items such as
these must be handled on an individual basis, and, at present, there seems -

to be no obvious way of generalizing the results of these effects.

In all cases, it has been assumed that the release takes place at an -
elevation of 100 m, This assumption produces somewhat lower ground-level

concentrations than would a similar release that occurs at ground level,

(Note: In this case it is assumed that all of the iodine isotopes are
retained on filters.)
8-82

However, except for extremely stable meteorological conditions, the
difference is quite small once the peak ground concentration produced by
the elevated release has been passed. For example, under GC-conditiomns,

the ground concentration from a release taking place at an elevation of

100 m reaches 75% of that from a similar ground-level release at a distance

of 1.2 km from the point of release.

The wind speeds used in these calculations have been chosen to be
100 m/min and 50 m/min because this range of wind speed is reasonably
characteristic of many locations, However, as can be seen from Eq. (16),

the dose is inversely proportional to the wind speed.

Finally, it should be pointed out that all of the doses calculated
are those which are delivered at ground level on the plume center line.
To obtain off-center-line ground-level doses, it is necessary to multiply
the results by the quantity

52/25

e 5,

where y is the distance (in meters) normal to the plume center line at
which the dose is required, and oy (in meters) is the horizontal disper-
sion parameter. For convenience, values of Ty and o, for the various

stability conditions are shown in Figs. 8.18 and 8.19.

Despite the obvious shortcomings of the procedures outlined, it is
believed that they will, at least, produce order-of-magnitude results.
These procedures will permit the development of sufficient "feel! for
the magnitude of the various credible accidents so that the problem of

siting can be approached in a quantitative manner.

8.3.4 Downwind Consequences of Upper Limit Accidents

Upper limit accidents were determined using the assumed properties
of fuel reprocessing plants (Sect. 8.3.1) and models and mechanisms
described in Sect. 8.3.2 such that the release of noble gases, "fresh!
fission products, iodine, semivolatile fission products, nonvolatile
fission products, and plutonium is maximized. The computed fractional

releases from the most significant accidents are summarized in Table 8.15,

release only "fresh" fission products and plutonium.

Site boundaries dictated by the upper limit accidents were estimated
assuming that the maximum acceptable annual dose commitments resulting
from exposure to the cloud or inhalation at the site boundary are those
recommended by the NCRP for annual occupational exposure. These emergency
dose commitments are compared with those of 10CFR100, > an Isochem land
requirements study, 1° and an ORNL study involving peacetime applications
of nuclear explosives in Table 8.16. The assumed acceptable dose commit-
ments have been employed only for reference purposes, but are believed to
be reasonable in view of the very low probability of occurrence of the

assumed upper limit accidents.

The maximum site boundaries (Table 8.17) for all LWR plants and the
l-metric ton/day FBR plant are determined by the whole-body dose resulting
from the release of volatile "fresh" fission products from a nuclear excur-
sion (30% and 1% release of iodines from LWR and FBR plants, respectively,
plus 100% release of the noble gases). Site boundaries for the larger FBR
plants are determined by the thyroid dose resulting from a silver tower
explosion, which is assumed to release 0.1% of the equilibrium inventory
of iodine. In Table 8.18, the total dose commitments resulting from various
upper limit accidents at the accident-dictated site boundaries of these
conceptual plants are compared with estimated dose commitments at the site
boundaries of the NFS, MFRP, and BNFP plants.

Noble Gases. - In plants that will partially remove the noble gases
from off-gas streams, the upper limit accident involving these gases is
considered to involve the complete release of the contents of a storage
vessel that contains a 7-day accumulation of krypton and xenon, A release
of approximately 6,400,000 curies of 85k plus 133%, is required to cause
a maximum (at OO m) downwind whole-body dose of 5 rems. This quantity
represents the total accumulation of these gases over 890, 148, and 25
days in LWR plants with capacities of 1, 6, and 36 metric tons/day, respec-
tively, and the total accumulation over 680, 115, and 3 days in FBR plants
with capacities of 1, 6, and 36 metric tons/day respectively. The release
of the 7-day accumulation of SPKr and 133Xe in a 36-metric ton/day FBR
plant would result in a whole-body dose of greater than 5 rems within

distances of about 2.3 km.

Fresh Fission Products. ~ Fresh fission products would be generated

 

in a nuclear excursion. A nuclear excursion in a head-end vessel of maxi-
mum capacity, resulting in complete boildown of the solution, is assumed.
After boildown and dehydration, the reaction would terminate in the
assumed vessels because of the low effective density of the fissile mater-
ial (~3 g per em’ of uranium plus plutonium in calcined solids is assumed).
The thermal power of the nonvolatile fission products (the fresh fission
product heat is significant for the first 1 to 2 hr following the excur-
sion) would then calcine the solids; these solids would probably subse-
quently melt through the vessel, flow onto the cell floor, and resolidify.

It is assumed that the initial rupture breaks the off-gas line and
that all of the steam generated in the boildown phase (containing all of
the noble gases, 30% of the iodine, 20% of the semivolatile fission pro-
ducts, and particulates of solution have the average concentration of
nonvolatile fission products and plutonium) is discharged to the cell
atmosphere and exhausted through the ventilation system. It is assumed
that 99.5% of the semivolatile fission products are removed from the hot
(air and saturated steam at ~100°C) ventilation stream by passage through
metal mesh or silica gel absorbers. The ventilation systems of FBR plants
are assumed to incorporate activated charcoal filters for removal of 99%
of the iodine. The particulate release is calculated using the model

presented in Sect. 8.3.2.

The doses delivered by a nuclear excursion are dominated by the
whole-body dose that results from exposure to the radioactive cloud of
fresh fission products (Fig. 8.17).

Release of Iodine Inventory. - It is assumed that a fire or explosion

 

in a solid halogen absorber would completely release the contained equi-
librium concentration of 131; and a two-year accumulation of 1297 It is
assumed that approximately 93% of the iodine collected by pretreatment in
a wet scrubber is not dispersible. FBR plants are assumed to utilize

charcoal filters that remove 9% of the remaining iodine.

The thyroid dose which results from the explosion of a silver reactor
is obtained by properly prorating the 1311 ang 1291 doses at 0.1 km, as
found in Tables 8.9 and 8,11, and applying the generalized dose curve (Fig.
8.15) .
,

cond

8-91

Release of Semivolatiles. - It is assumed that a total of 0.1% of the
semivolatiles in the largest vessel is released by a mechanism other than
a nuclear excursion (i.e., a tank boildown or an inadvertent addition of

oxidants to a process vessel).

The upper limit accident in a waste tank for interim (2-year) storage
of mixed fission products would release a smaller amount of ruthenium by
comparison, In evaluating the waste tank accident, it is assumed that
coolant is lost from the tank and that the tank leaks, discharging steam
to the vault ventilation system and its condenser. The distillate, con-
taining about 20% of the semivolatiles, is assumed to be returned to the
tank, but an aerosol composed of particulates containing 20% of the con-
centration of semivolatiles in the waste is discharged through the filters.
The release from this source is insignificant (semivolatiles content,
«1078 ton of fuel).

The doses resulting from the release of semivolatiles are controlled
by the dose to the lung. They are obtained by application of the data in
Tables 8.9 and 8.11, and the generalized curve (Fig. 8.15).

Release of Nonvolatiles. - The upper limit accident involving the
release of nonvolatile fission products and transplutonic elements was
determined to result from an explosion in the waste calciner containing
fission products at a concentration of 1074 £13 per megawatt-day of burnup.
The explosion in a waste evaporator would cause essentially the same release
if the droplets evaporated in the ventilation system upstream of the filter.
No "credible" accidents that would cause a larger release of nonvolatile
fission products could be postulated in the interim solids storage pool or

interim liquid waste tank.

The downwind doses resulting from the postulated releases were found

to be negligible,

Release of Plutonium. - The maximum credible plutonium release was

 

assumed to result from a fire of 0.5-hr duration (the fractional release
is proportional to the time of aerosol generation) involving either resin
or solvent loaded with plutonium, The particles escaping from the filter

were assumed to be pure Puo, (a pessimistic assumption). The release of
8-92

plutonium from this source is about the same as that from a nuclear
excursion involving complete boildown of the plutonium storage tank

(containing up to 7.5 tons of plutonium).

The controlling bone dose from a plutonium fire is found in a manner
similar to that used to calculate the dose resulting from the release of

semivolatiles.

8.3.5 Maximum Theoretical Accident

 

A maximum theoretical accident has been evaluated for the purpose of
illustrating the worst possible consequences that could result from poor
design and/or implementation of good practice. Since waste storage tanks
are known to have the largest inventory of physiologically hazardous
materials, we have assumed that a hydrogen-air explosion occurs in the
vapor space of an acid waste tank containing a 2-year accumulation of

fission products.

Mechanical Consequences. - Illustrative (but not the worst possible)

 

mechanical consequences of such an accident were made assuming that the
tank contains fission products from 39,000,000 Mwd of fuel exposure (a
2-year accumulation from a 6-metric ton/day plant processing fuels irradi-
ated to a burnup of 12,000 Mwd/ton), generating 56,000,000 Btu/hr in
390,000 gal of solution. The tank, 80% filled with solution, is assumed
to: (1) be fabricated of 0.5-in,-thick stainless steel, (2) have a diam-
eter of 65 ft and a height (with flat heads) of 20 ft, and (3) be housed
in a 3-ft-thick concrete vault buried under 10 ft of earth, Following

the loss of purge air to the tank, the concentration of hydrogen in the
13,000-f+> vapor space would increase to li vol % (the minimum flammable
concentration) after about 3 hr and to 30 vol % after about 24 hr. Assum-
ing that the loss of purge air is undetected and that there is a source

of ignition after 24 hr, the resultant explosion would liberate approxi-
mately 1,100,000 Btu of energy, generate a pressure of approximately

100 psig in the vapor space, elevate the concrete roof and earth cover by
several feet, and (we assume) rupture the coolant and off-gas piping in
such a manner that complete loss of cooling would ensue and the tank
would be directly vented to the atmosphere.

keke
8-93

Assuming that no remedial measures were taken following the loss of
coolant and the breach of containment, the solution would heat to boiling
in about 10 hr and evaporate to dryness after about 125 hr. The waste
salts could calcine, melt through the floor of the tank, decompose the
concrete, and flow into the earth beneath the tank after a total of

approximately 160 hr following the explosion.

A comparable accident in an alkaline waste storage tank would have
similar consequences, but would take place over a longer time period
because of the greater dilution. Calculations made for a 1,200,000-gal
alkaline waste tank containing waste generating l;3,000,000 Btu/hr indicate
that the waste would heat to boiling after approximately 23 hr, boil to
dryness after approximately 273 hr, decompose after approximately 290 hr,
and melt through the vault in approximately 330 hr.

The transient growth of a molten sphere in infinite media of dry
sand and limestone was estimated, assuming that the fission products are
mixed by convection in the molten zone and that the molten zone has the
same density as the surrounding earth (so that no settling or flotation
of the sphere would occur). Assumed properties of the dry sand and lime-
stone are shown in Table 8.19. The results (Fig. 8.20) indicate that the
radius of the molten sphere in dry sand would grow to a maximum of about
75 ft after about 1500 days. In limestone, the radius of the sphere would
grow to a maximum of approximately 50 ft after 700 days. The molten zone

would completely solidify after about 150 years.

Release of Radioactive Materials to the Atmosphere. - The semivolatile

 

fission products (Ru, Cs, and Te) would be released quantitatively to the
atmosphere during the boildown-calcination phase of this maximum theoretical
accident. In addition, about 0.1% of the mixed nonvolatile fission products
would be released by entrainment in the steam; however, these can be neglec-
ted in an analysis of consequences because their effect is negligible by
comparison, In the evaluation of downwind consequences, it can be assumed
that thermal currents carry the semivolatile fission products to the top

of an atmospheric inversion layer,

The release to the atmosphere from the maximum theoretical accident
in an alkaline waste tank would be comparable to that from the acid waste
tank except that it would take place over a longer time period. The
cerium would probably be released quantitatively during the boildown
phase. The ruthenium would be released during the calcination phase,
although it is probable that a portion would be deposited on cool (<800°C)

surfaces as it diffuses to the postulated break in the off-gas line,

The consequences of a waste tank boildown may be found by proper
prorating of the 0.L-km doses found in Table 8.13 and by use of the
generalized dose curve (Fig. 8.18). The doses thus obtained (>10° rems
at 0.4 km downwind) have little meaning other than to show why such maxi-
mum theoretical accidents must be rendered incredible through the use of

appropriate engineered safety features.

Another related type of accident in an acid waste tank, also consid-
ered only of a theoretical nature since it depends on a very improbable
combination of circumstances, involves simultaneous failure of the coolant
for the coils of the tank and the off-gas condenser. In the event of such
an accident, the contents of the tank would boil down on essentially the
same time scale as that discussed previously. Because of the low heat
capacity of the air and typical ventilation ducts, a mixture of air and
saturated steam at approximately 100°C could pass through the off-gas and
ventilation filters and be exhausted to the stack. Certain of the semi-
volatile fission products (in particular, ruthenium tetroxide, which has
a boiling point of ~80°C) may be carried by this stream. It is assumed
(as in the case of the nuclear incident discussed previously) that 20%
of the ruthenium is volatilized during the boildown phase and that, of
this, 99.5% is removed by deposition on metal or on the filter. The
remainder of the semivolatile fission products might be evolved in the
calcination phase, but the off-gas line is assumed to cool following
cessation of steam flow, permitting essentially complete (by comparison)

removal of the semivolatile fission products by deposition and filtration.

Mitigation of Accidents. - The authors stress that such accidents as
the one denoted as "maximum theoretical may be converted to the tolerable

category, in terms of consequences, by proper forethought and design. For
8-97

example, the effects of the postulated hydrogen-air explosion can be
mitigated by one of the following (and possibly by others, limited only
by the ingenuity of the designers):

(1) Increase the reliability of preventive measures for control of

the purge air flow and the hydrogen concentration.

(2) Enclose the waste tarks within a building that is ventilated

through a condenser and filter.

(3) Design the tank and/or the vault to withstand a pressure of
about 100 psig without rupture.

(LL) Decouple the tank from the vault. Use a pressure suppression
and/or pressure relief system in the tank. Vent the vault to a
containment system with large capacitance or to a pool of water

for steam suppression,

(5) Use titanium tanks and self-boiling wastes to ensure effective

purging of the hydrogen by steam.

8.3.6 Consequences of the Leakage of High-Level Wastes to the Ground

Radioactive waste solutions that are released by tank failure might
be routed through the geologic formation lying between the tank site and
the nearest surface drainageways. Since analyses must be made using
specific site conditions, a hypothetical tank site at Oak Ridge was chosen
for didactic purposes. This site was considered to be located in Conasauga
shale on a promontory, with intermittent surface streams passing to the
east, south, and west of the tank site. The shale formation is quite
impermeable, and the movement of water is restricted so that it flows only

along bedding planes.

Samples of the Conasauga shale were obtained below the highly weathered
zone in a direct path toward the surface streams. These samples were acid-
ified for the removal of calcite, and the exchange capacities were determined
by the calcium titration method of Jackson. [1 A mean value of 11 + 1 meq/100
3 at 85°C showed a hydrogen

ion consumption of 260 meq/l00 g, which would be sufficient to neutralize

g was obtained. Overnight refluxing in 7 M HNO
8-98

the entire contents of an acid waste tank within a distance of 30 ft from
the tank. In the case of acid waste, it was assumed that neutralization
of the acid by calcite in the formation would result in a calcium salt
system. In this system, strontium was assumed to compete with calcium
without selectivity of either ion, aLoen strontium might be slightly

more selectively sorbed than calcium, For the sorption of strontium
from neutralized wastes, and for the sorption of cesium and ruthenium,
information on the sorption properties of Conasauga shale were obtained

from previous laboratory studies, 10702

The quality of the groundwater was assumed to be similar to that of
Clinch River water, which has a total cation (calcium and magnesium)
concentration of about 0,002 meq/m. 53 Seepage rates were assumed to be
characteristic of the area surrounding Waste Pit 2, where the average
seepage rate from 1953 to 1958 was 3900 gal/day through an average side-
wall area of 9000 £t° (ref. 8l). This corresponds to a mean superficial
velocity of 0.06l ft/day. A mean groundwater velocity of 0.67 ft/day was
used, which implies approximately 10% efficiency of contact between the
shale and solution, If the initial seepage rate were maintained, the
dally seepage rate from the acid waste tank (filled to a height of 35 ft
with 10° gal of waste) would be 2275 gal. The seepage from the neutral-
ized waste tank (filled to a height of 36 ft with 1.25 x 10° gal of
waste) would be 2340 gal.

Dispersion properties of solution in the formation (Fig. 8.21) were
estimated from the results of a chloride tracer test conducted at the
8l, These data indicate an effective plate height of 46.5, according
to the notation of Glusckauf. 2

site.

Calculation of Radionuclide Movement. - In addition to the assumptions
outlined above, it was further assumed that the waste would move longitudi-
nally through a zone 75 ft wide, with a height equal to the original liquid
level in the waste tank, to surface water at a distance of 200 ft. No
allowance was made for lateral dispersion, but the spread of the solute
was assumed to occur according to Glueckauf's model for the elution of a

band of solute through a linear ion exchange column, The porosity of the

shale effectively contacted by solution was assumed to be 25%, with a

grain density of 2.6L g/ml.

If a leak were to develop in a waste tank, the amount of solution lost
to the formation would be limited by the ability of the formation to accept
the solution. During percolation of the waste solution, the groundwater
concentration in the zone of migration would be increased, returning to
normal when the waste solution was again displaced by the local ground-
water, Movement and dispersion of the specific radionuclides were esti-
mated by using Glueckauf's model in order to describe the dispersion of
the unsorbed anions and correcting for retention of the radionuclides by
the formation, as discussed by Inoue and Kaufman. 50 However, due to the
variable concentration of electrolyte in the groundwater, the retention
factor was not constant with time. In addition, radioactive decay was

considered.

The results of calculations for the movement of Psy from an acid
tank are shown in Fig. 8.22. The initial peak in Op. activity at the
surface drainageway occurs at about 1 year and is due to the relatively
slight sorption of strontium by the shale in the presence of high concen-
trations of electrolyte. With time, these high concentrations of salt are
diluted and replaced by fresh groundwater, and a second concentration peak
occurs after about 150 years. The relative magnitude of these two peaks
depends on the total quantity of electrolyte released to the formation.
If, after a leak occurs, the waste solution is pumped from the ground, the
initial rapid movement will not be observed due to the removal of the
excess electrolyte, Furthermore, in the case of 90g. in an acid waste
system, an appreciable fraction of the total radioactivity could be
removed (Table 8.20).

For neutralized waste, the precipitation of strontium, in addition
to the increased probability for ion exchange, prevents P05 from attaining
any significant concentration at the surface drainageways. The high
affinity of the Conasauga shale for cesium deters movement of 137cq s0
that radioactive decay occurs before significant concentrations would be

observed in either acid or neutralized waste systems. The relatively rapid

decay of Ru (half-life, 1 year) would prevent it from attaining sig-

nificantly high levels at surface seeps unless a very extensive leak were
to occur.

Several factors must be incorporated into the mathematical model in
order to arrive at predicted concentrations. Each parameter used is

subject to variation. Figure 8,22 was estimated using the following

guesses for these parameters:

In addition, cases were considered in which each of these variables was
allowed to vary by +10% of its average value. The maximum and minimum
concentration curves for a 100-day leak are shown in Fig. 8.23. It is

seen that, although the shape of the curve (as plotted on a log-log scale)

is not significantly affected, estimates of the activity levels at any

time may be in error by one or two orders of magnitude.

The distribution factor and the mass of soil contacted per milliliter

of pore solution will determine the relative velocity of the radionuclide

in comparison to the percolating groundwater. The larger these two factors,

the slower the relative velocity. Since the distribution factor is inversely

proportional to the concentration of the percolating solution, the movement
of the radionuclide is most rapid initially and is then reduced as the
groundwater concentration returns to normal. The level plateau on the
curves between the two peaks reflects the ratio of the normal groundwater

concentration to the concentration of the waste solution.

The time of travel is dependent on the groundwater velocity and the
distance traveled. In our local situation, flow is nearly unidirectional
However, because this would not likely be the case in other situations,
additional consideration would need to be given to the geometry of the
flow patterns. In our situation, it was found that the dispersion of the
chloride tracer could be described by a chromatographic breakthrough curve
with a theoretical plate height of 46.5 ft. This implies that about 1% of
the groundwater will traverse 200 ft in one-third the time of the average
movement. In other situations, the average groundwater velocity may be

quite different from the values we used; thus it may be impossible to fit

travel times to simple dispersion or chromatographic breakthrough equations.

A greater degree of dispersion hastens the appearance of radioactivity at
a given point, but the peak concentrations are diminished unless adequate

time has elapsed to permit radioactive decay.

Thermal Effects. ~ The distribution of radionuclides in the soil is
important because of the thermal problems that are likely to result from
high concentrations of radioactive material in a medium that has poor
heat-conducting properties. Spherical shell geometry and thermal equi-
librium were assumed as a first approximation to estimate the magnitude
of the thermal problem in contaminated Conasauga shale. Figure 8.2 shows
the simplified model and the heat-generating capacity of the contaminated
shale according to zones. A solution in the spherical shell geometry has

been described by Etherington.S” In the present study, the tank has been

ignored as a heat sink, and a heat sink was assumed to be located at the
edge of a variable-sized non-heat-generating region. To define the limits
of temperature rise, two cases were considered. The first assumes that
liquid waste is retained in the shale pore volume, and the second assumes
that liquid is not retained in this way. The source strength is listed
for each zone, and the volume occupied by each zone is normalized to 1 gal
of waste. For example, if a leak of 1000 gal occurs and liquid waste is
retained by the shale pores, then the volume of zone 1 is 150 £3 and the
heat-generating rate in this zone is 30,000 Btu/hr.

When acid waste leaks from a tank, it will be neutralized by the
buffering action of the shale (260 meq of Ht per 100 g of shale). Zone 1
depicts the acid zone; the remaining zones are neutralized. Soil loadings
were estimated from studies conducted at ambient temperatures and from
judicious application of these results to the analysis, Values of thermal
conductivity of unweathered Conasauga shale range from 1 to 2 Btu mint
rit (°F) ~t when measured at 30 to 330,88 Similar data do not exist for
elevated temperatures. Therefore, it was assumed that the thermal conduc-
tivity of shale increases gradually with increasing temperature and follows
the pattern observed in metal systems OY In all likelihood, the thermal
conductivity of shale will decrease as the temperature increases, especially
when water is lost from the shale, Thus, the temperature rise estimated in

this analysis is likely to be lower than that which may actually occur.

Figure 8.25 shows the steady-state temperature attained in the center
of the spherical system as a function of leak volume. Maximum temperatures
increase with the volume of the leak, the retention of liquid in pore
spaces, and the absence of a heat sink. Temperatures range from 870 to
1250°F for a leak of 100 gal.

Transient temperatures are being investigated as a function of time
and space in a system that includes a variable-sized cylindrical geometry
(representing the contaminated zone) and variably spaced heat sinks located

at the tank, the groundwater table, and the ground surface.

A digital computer program, TOSS, contains many of the requisites for

90

solving the transient problem for a multivariate system. This program,

which has been modified to suit the needs of the present study, has the
capability of calculating the temperature distribution for a three-
dimensional, multiregional problem having internal heat generation. A
number of cases are being analyzed. Studies are also under way to evalu-
ate the diffusivity, or specific heat, and the thermal conductivity of

Conasauga shale as functions of temperature.

Conclusions. - In a formation similar to Conasauga shale, the slow
rate of percolation of the solution, combined with rather high sorptive
properties of the formation (except for POs. in an acid waste system),
would tend to prevent the rapid release of large quantities of radionu-
clides directly into surface waterways. However, this delay would result
in the buildup of activity in the formation to levels that would probably
present a serious thermal problem. The delay time afforded by the forma-
tion could be used for remedial measures (e.g., for pumping groundwater
from the formation to recover the unsorbed radionuclides and for prevent-

ing further transport of the fission products).

The absolute values for radionuclide movement that have been calcu-
lated and presented in this discussion should not be considered to be
precise since the estimates were based on a rather limited description
of the site. However, the procedure for making these estimations could
be applied for any proposed site. Actual tests of seepage and dispersion
at a proposed site employing the layout of the tank system would provide

a more adequate basis for such calculations.
8.4 Requirements for Treatment of Routine Effluents

The preceding sections have shown that the assumed routine releases
of radionuclides from fuel reprocessing plants require greater site bound-
ary distances than those required by the assumed upper limit accidents,
The large site boundary distances that were estimated to be required by
the routine release from plants of high capacity provide incentive for
partial removal of the noble gases and a larger percentage of the iodine
than that assumed in Sect. 8.2.1.

Table 8.21 shows approximate site boundaries that would result if

34t the ORML site, the required DF's are unchanged for site boundaries less than 1.2 km to the
northeast since the average annual downwind concentration "peaks" at this distance.

Ppp is defined as the ratio of the average annual release rate obtained without treatment devices to
that required to attain, at the site boundary, average annual concentrations of 1 x 1077, 0.77 x 10713,

and 1.4 x 1072 curies/m> of noble gases, iodine from IWR fuel, and iodine from FBR fuel respectively.

CNo removal of noble gas is required. The average annual noble gas concentration at the site boundary

is 5.8 x 1078 curies/m>.

the noble gases and iodine were removed from the normal effluent to such

an extent that the maximum site radius is determined by the upper limit

accident. On this basis, equipment for removing 50 to 99% of the noble

gases appears to be necessary for plants with capacities of more than a

few tons per day. More efficient iodine removal than that demonstrated

in present technology will be required for LWR plants with capacities

greater than about 6 to 10 tons/day, and decontamination factors (DF's)
as high as 10° will be required for FBR plants if the spent FBR fuel is

to be processed after decay times of only 30 days.
