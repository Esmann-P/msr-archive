UFg GAS TO UF), IN A MOLTEN SALT

ABSTRACT

The direct reduction of UF, to UF, in a molten
salt is proposed as a step in tbe purification of
fuel salt from a molten salt reactor. This step
would replace the conventional method of reduction
in which UF, is reduced to UF, powder in a H_ - F_
flame. Reduction of the UF, In a molten sal® wilt
result in a shorter and more direct process for fuel
salt purification. The reduction is to be effected
in two steps which consist of absorption of UF, into
a molten salt containing UF, and of reduction of the
resulting intermediate fluorides to UF, with hydro-
gen. Experimental data on the absorption step are
presented and information concerning the reduction
of intermediate fluorides is considered.

INTRODUCTION
One proposed processing step for Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) fuel
is the reduction of purified UF to ur), so that the UF), can be re-
)

(1

ducing Ug to UF), is by use of Hy in a Hy-Fy flame:

(5, + T,) UF, + CHF.

UF + Hy 2 2a

turned to barren, purified fuel salt. The usual method for re-

This reduction is carried out in a tall column where the UF and H,
are introduced into a Hy-Fy flame and dry UF), powder (finely divided)
is collected. It is a routine production operation and there is much

(2,3)

available operating information. Such a process would not he
desirable for remote operation. It involves a solids handling problem
which routinely requires equipment access and process control is some-
times difficult.

It would be desirable to reduce the UF to ur), in a molten salt
environment, and thus circumvent the problems of solids handling and

fuel make-up. Past experience of other workers has indicated the
2
feasibility of absorbing UF into molten salt which contains UF, and

content greater than UF Long

This report presents a proposed continuous processing method for
the reduction of UF, to UF), in a molten salt environment by absorption
of UF, in the salt and reduction with He The results from a scouting

test are analyzed to indicate process feasibility.

PROPOSED PROCESS AND APPLICATION TO MSR PROCESSING
The current scheme for processing Molten Salt Reactor (MSR) fuel
congists of removal of uranium as Fe and volatile fission products
(FP) from the salt by fluorination, separation of refractory FP from
the salt by distillation, and recombination of the volatilized uranium
and purified barren salt for return to the MSR (Fig. 1), During the
fluorination step, both uranium and volatile fission products are re-

moved from the salt by the reactions:

UF) (in molten salt) + Fo UF

(in molten salt) + F,— volatile FP fluorides.

The UF and volatile FP fluorides will be separated by sorption tech-
nigues and the uranium will then be re=introduced as UF), to the purified
barren salt to form the MSR fuel. Thus, there must be a method for re-
ducing UF, to UF), -

Since the end result of the UF reduction will be a solution of UF),
in molten salt rather than UF), as a dry powder, it is attractive to
carry on the reduction in a molten salt environment and preferably in
the purified barren salt. To achieve this requirement, UF can be con-
tacted with a molten fluoride salt containing some uranium as UF), where
it will be absorbed by reaction with the Ur), to form an equivalent inter-

mediate fluoride of uranium, such as UF., in the salt:

This intermediate fluoride will then be reduced to UF), in the salt by

means of Hy:

+ HF &

UF + 1/2H s—— UF

5(salt) L(salt)
Such a process could be carried out continuously in a column in
which the barren salt and Fg are introduced at the bottom of the column
along with salt containing UF), which 1s recycled from the top of the
column (Fig. 2). As the salt and Ure progress up the column, the UF¢
will be absorbed in the salt and subsequently reduced to UF), ag it
passes into the Hy reduction section. The column off-gas will be a mix-
ture of H, and HF and a side stream of the overhead molten salt will be
ready for return to the nuclear reactor core after filtration since the
HF and H, sparge usually given make-up salt will have been achieved In
the reduction column. When this reduction step is incorporated into the
flowsheet, the resulting process is more direct and shorter (Fig. 3).
Tnitial tests (unext.sccht) indicate that the absorption step is
very rapid, however, it will be desirable to keep the fluoride content
of the intermediate fluoride below that equivalent to UF in order to
minimize corrosion. The rate of the hydrogen reduction reaction is not
known, although the limited data available looks favorable. In studying

the reduction of UF), to UF, in molten salt by H, by the reaction:

3

: 1 hs
UF), (salt) + /eH,——UF + IF ,

3(salt)

observed that equilibrium was established between a Hy =H stream

and molten salt containing uranium fluorides after the gas bibbles had

risen a few inches through the salt. His data alsc indicate only 1%

reduction of UF) to UF, by a gas stream containing 1% HF in H, at a
fal

pressure of 1 atm at 600°C.

EXPERIMENTAL EQUIPMENT AND PROCEDURE

The experimental equipment was assembled from existing equipment
available as a result of work in support of the Molten Salt Fluoride
Volatility Process. Means were provided for contacting UF), » dissolved

for contacting the resulting uranium fluoride with hydrogen in the second
step. Details of the experimental equipment and of the procedure for

testing the reduction process are discussed in the following sections.
EQUIPMENT AND MATERTALS

The reduction test was carried out in the vessel shown schematic-
ally in Fig. 4. The vessel was constructed from L-in.-diam Sch 4O
nickel pipe and was 26 inches in length. A 3/8-in. nickel inlet line
was located in the center of the vessel and terminated 1/L-in. from the
bottom of the vessel. A 3/L=in. fitting on the top flange allowed the
insertion of a cold, 3/8=in. nickel rod which was used for sampling the
salt. The vessel was heated by two nichrome wire resistance furnaces.

A flow diagram for the equipment used in the test is shown in Fig. 5.
The equipment included a Fg metering system, a hydrogen metering sys-
tem, means for purging both the UFg system and Hy system with Ns, the
reduction vessel, and a NaF trap downstream from the vessel for absorb-
ing UF or HF from the off-gas of the reduction vessel.

The salt charge was prepared by mixing LiF, ZrF), and UF), - The LiF
was reagent grade and contained < 0.23 wt % impurities (mostly NaF).
The zirconium content of the ZTE), was found by analysis to be Sh.78%
which compares favorably with the stoichiometrical value of 5h 6%; the
uranium content of the UF), was found to be 76.9% which also compares
favorably with the stoichiometrical value of 75.8%; and the uranium
hexafluoride contained less than 200 ppm impurities. Hydrogen that was

used contained less than 0.005 vol fraction impurities.
FXPERIMENTAL PROCEDURE

A salt charge consisting of 5320 g ZTE) , 863 g LiF, and 61.8 g UF),
(0.197 gmole UF), ) was placed in the reduction vessel and heated to 600°¢.
At this temperature the depth of molten salt was 12 inches. The salt
mixture had a UF), concentration of 1 wt % and a melting point of approx-
imately 510°C, A salt sample (UR-1) was taken by insertion of a cold
3/8=in.-diam nickel rod into the molten salt. A UF flow of 1.5 g/min

was then fed through the by-pass around the reduction vessel for 16

minutes in order to free the system of N The UF, flow was then divert-

ed into the dip line of the reduction vessel and was continued for 25
minutes. At this time, the UF, flow was stopped and the system was
purged with N_, for 5 minutes after which a salt sample (UR-2) was taken.
The quantity of UF, fed to the system during this step was 38.2 g
(0.108 gmoles). The salt was then purged with I, at the rate of 95 st.

em /min for 25 minutes. A total of 0.107 gmoles H,. was added during

2

this step. After the system was purged with N, for 10 min, a salt

2
sample (UR-3) was taken. The system was then allowed to cool down over-
night. The following day the system was heated to 600°C and a salt sam-

ple was taken (UR-L). The salt was then sparged with H_, at a rate of 85

2
st. em /min for 20 min during which a total of 0.076 gmoles Hy was fed
to the system. The system was then purged with N, for 10 min and a salt
sample (UR-5) was taken. The system was then cooled and the test con-

cluded.
DISCUSSION OF EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

Two questions related to the experimental work are of primary inter-
est. These are (1) the fraction of UF, which was absorbed by the molten
salt and (2) the valence of the uranium in the resulting mixture. Also,
of interest are the concentration level of trace impurities such as Ni
and Oye

The composition of the various salt samples is given in Table 1.
The uranium concentration in the initial salt (UR-1) was found by analy-
sis to be 0.646 wt % which is 11.2% lower than the calculated uranium
concentration of 0.75 wt %. The calculated uranium concentration for
complete absorption of the UF, bubbled through the salt during the 25
min addition period was 1.15 wt %. The average uranium concentration
after the UF, addition was found by analysis to be 1.07 wt % which is
T™ lower than the calculated value. It was concluded that, within the
accuracy of the experimental data, complete absorption of the UFg had
occurred.

Tt is believed that the addition of UF to a salt containing Ur),
results in the formation of dissolved fluorides of uranium with a va-

lence intermediate between +4 and +£. This behavior is indicated by

the fact that quantities of Fy sufficient for the formation of UF can

be absorbed by molten salt containing UF), without the evolution of Urge
A gimilar behavior is also noted in reactions between UF), and UF in the
absence of molten salt to yield intermediate fluorides such as OF 7
Tt is assumed that uranium present in a molten salt as an intermediate
fluoride will appear as yt and ye after dissolution in phosphoric acid
(7)

The concentration of U in the sample after UF addition was below
the limit of detection of 0.01 wt % and the yt concentration was 0.95

wt % (Table 1). After the first and second hydrogen sparges, the yt

in preparation for analysis.

concentration was found to be 1.07 wt % and 0.922 wt %, respectively.
Although differences in u concentration were observed, it is felt that
these are within the limits of analytical error and are not meaningful.
Reduction of the yt to yh probably occurred during the addition of UF
by reaction of the intermediate fluoride with nickel from the vessel wall
or with reduced fluorides of nickel, chromium, or iron initially present
in the salt. The nickel concentration increased from 874 ppm initially
to approximately 1000 ppm during the UF addition and the initial hydro=
gen treatment. This increase in Ni concentration of approximately 130
ppm is sufficient for the reduction of approximately 15% of the Fg added.
The concentration of oxide in the salt during the test was approximately
4000 ppm.

In the absence of conclusive information on the reduction of uranium
fluorides intermediate between UF), and UF, reference can be made to data
on materials having similar characteristics. The equilibrium between UF),

and UF, in molten mixtures of LiF and BeF,, has been studied by Long(5)

3

by observing the concentration of HF in H., in equilibrium with the salt.

2
Equilibrium was observed to have been established during the rise of Hy
bubbles through a few inches of molten salt. The data indicated that

reduction of UF), to UF, could be achieved over a wide range of operating

3
conditions.

The reduction of NiF,, CF, , FeF, to the metals by hydrogen is utile
ized for removal of these contaminants from molten salt. Tt was also

observed that molten salts containing uranium fluoride with a valence>5
13
(4)

are quite corrosive toward nickel metal. Since the reactions:

oUF + Ni=——*2UF) + NiF,

NiF, + Hoi + 2HF

are known to occur in molten salts, it is felt that the reaction:

UF, + 1/2H;—UF) + HF

will also occur.
CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDAT IONS

The following conclusions have been made on the basis of the mater-

ial presented in the preceding sections.

1. Uranium hexafluoride 1s absorbed rapidly by molten fluoride
salt containing approx. 1 wt % UF), at 600°C. Tt is believed
that the absorption results in the formation of an intermedi-
ate fluoride of uranium.

2. It is likely that reduction of the intermediate fluoride to
UF), can be accomplished by contact with hydrogen.

3. Incorporation of the proposed reduction step into the flowsheet
for MSR processing results im a shorter and more direct process.

It is recommended that experimental work on the reduction of UFg to

UF), in a molten salt environment be continued with emphasis in the follow-
ing areas:

1. rate of reduction of intermediate uranium fluoride to UF), by
hydrogen.

2. corrosivity of molten fluoride melts containing intermediate
uranium fluorides.

3. adaptation of the reduction process to continuous operation.
