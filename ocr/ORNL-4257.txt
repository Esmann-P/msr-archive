ABSTRACT
The potential of the cell

ad
with the assumed cell reaction

Be(s) + 2HF(g) 2 BeF, (d) + H 5 (8)

was measured over a composition range of 0.30 to 0.90 mole
fraction BeF) and a temperature range of 500 to 900°C. Since
this cell potential is related to the activity of BeFy in the
solutions by p a

HF

activity coefficients could be derived for BeFy (and by a

Gibbs-Duhem integration for LiF). Usefully accurate measure-

ments could not be made with pure BeFg in the cell, hence
values of E° were calculated using values for age, derived
from the phase diagram and previously reported heat of

fusion (1.13 kcal/mole) giving

= 2.4430 - 0.0007952T

This comparison of the emf data with the LiF-BeF) phase dia-
gram also indicated that the heat of fusion for BeFp is < 2.0
kcal/mole. A power series in xy jF was assumed for log YBeFy
and the coefficients determined by a least squares fit to

the data. This gave

log vg = (3.8780 - 4323.2 2333.3), 2 + (-40.7375 + HELE, =
2
+ (94.3997 - BABT0.9) ho + (67.4178 + 222B:3y,0

Formation free energies and heats for BeF, and Be0 were also
calculated by combining the results of the present study with

and HF,Hy|F~
electrodes performed acceptably for use as reference electrodes,
both being stable and reproducible.

 
 

 

 

I. INTRODUCTION
Molten fluoride mixtures of LiF and BeF, are of considerable
interest at this Laboratory since they are the principal constituents
in the molten-salt reactor (MSRE) fuel and coolant salts.! Although

the molten LiF-BeF, system has received considerable attention, only

2
a limited number of emf investigations have been attempted. The
development of reference electrode half-cells for molten fluorides in
general would facilitate the determination of electrode potentials for
various fluoride constituents and the detection of certain impurities

contained in these mixtures.

The purpose of this investigation was to study the cell reaction
Be®(s) + 2HF(g) Z BeF,(d) + H, (8) 1)

in the molten LiF-BeF, system using Be?" | Be® and HF,H, |F~ electrodes. 1
Emf data obtained in this study would hopefully extend and improve the -
thermodynamics of this molten fluoride system. At the same time emf
measurements should demonstrate useful electrodes which may serve as
reference electrodes in future emf studies in this important molten
salt solvent system.
Thus far activity data for the LiF-BeF, systems has been obtained
from mass spectroscopic studies of the vapor, 23 from the phase dia-
gram, > from emf measurements ,® and from transpiration data where
gaseous HF-H,0 mixtures were equilibrated with the molten fluoride mix-
ture.’ ‘The values derived from the phase data, besides being non-iso- -

thermal, have been limited in accuracy because the BeF, liquidus has

2 s

been difficult to determine. In addition, the reported values®?227,8,9 oO
 

”»

_ uC,
c

for the heat of fusion for BeF, are not in agreement. Mass spectro-

2
scopic and emf values of the activity were determined for only a limit-
ed number of compositions and temperatures. Probably the best activi-
ty values are those determined by Mathews and Baes’ using a transpira-
tion method to equilibrate gaseous HF-H,0 mixtures with molten LiF-BeF,
mixtures. However, activities derived from these heterogeneous equi-
libria are somewhat limited in accuracy (+ 67%) and the equilibrium
quotients were measured in the presence of Be0 as a saturating solid
which might have influenced the activity values.

Direct determination of the activity of BeF, by emf measurements
should yield more accurate values over a greater composition range than
any of the methods previously mentioned. Dirian, Romberger and Baes'®
measured the potential of the following cell as a function of tempera-

ture.

Be®|0.33 BeF, - 0.67 LiF|HF,H,,Pd

The cell reaction is that shown in eq. (1). The two electrodes -

Bet |Be® and HF,H, [F~ - were judged by Dirian et al, to be reversible
from polarization measurements.

In the present investigation these two electrodes were used to
determine the cell potential over a composition range of 0.30 to 0.90
mole fraction BeF, and a temperature range of 500 to 900°C (Fig. 1).

An attempt vas made to obtain measurements in pure BeF,, but results
of useful accuracy could not be obtained presumably because of its high
viscosity and/or high electrical resistivity. Even at 900°C, pure BeF,

is very viscous (about 180 poised). The reaction vessel was not heat-

ed above 900°C because of the tendency of nickel to soften at such

 
 

 

elevated temperatures. The melting points of mixtures below 0.33 BeF,
increase rapidly as the concentration approaches pure LiF as shown in
the LiF-BeF, phase’ diagram: in Fig. 1. The lower BeF, concentrations oo
(below 0.30 BeF,) were not investigated therefore since the accessible
temperature range was so limited.

According to the assumed cell reaction (eq. 1), the cell potential

should be dependent on the activity of BeF,, the activity of beryllium

2°

metal, and the partial pressures of HF and H,.

Previous measurements’ with the HF-H electrode, as well as the pre-

sent ones, indicate the gases to be sufficiently ideal at the elevated

was at elevated temperatures.

The reaction vessel was located inside an upright tube furnace,
the temperature was controlled by an L & N Series 60 D.A.T. Control
Unit. The temperature of the reaction vessel was checked with a cali-
brated Chromel-Alumel thermocouple and an L & N K-3 potentiometer.

A 4-in. diameter vessel, fitted with 1/2-in. diameter electrode
compartments, was used for preliminary measurements. Electrodes used
in the cylindrical compartments were insulated from the compartment
walls with boron nitride spacers, but even then accidental electrical
shorts were a problem. The large compartments of the reaction vessel
used in the present investigation eliminated the need for insulating :
spacers except the Teflon seal at the top of the compartment, and no
problems from electrical shorting were encountered.

HF-H, Electrode

An H,,HF,Pd electrode of the type used by Dirian and Romberger'’
was used in some of the preliminary measurements. This electrode
produced stable potentials but was quite noisy (+ 1 mv). Platinum
gauze was substituted for the palladium and was found to be just as
responsive and capable of very low noise levels (0.1 mv). The platin-
um gauze type (Fig. 4) was used for all measurements in this investi-
gation. Electrodes were prepared by forming an egg-shaped bag with th-
gauze and slipping the open end over 1/8-in. nickel tubing and tying
it securely with small diameter nickel wire. The other end of the bag

was crimped together so that the HF-H, mixture, passing down through

2
the nickel tubing had to pass through the gauze. The 1/8-in. nickel

tubing transmitted the HF-H, mixture and provided electrical contact.

Beryllium Electrode

These electrodes (Fig. 4) were constructed by slipping a berylli-
um metal cylinder (3/8-in. 0.D., 1/8-in. I.D., and 1/2-in. length)
over a 1/8-in. nickel tube and crimping the nickel tube slightly on
each side of the beryllium cylinder to hold it securely. The cylinder
was positioned about 1/2-in. from the tip of the nickel tube. Lower-
ing the beryllium metal closer to the tip of the nickel tube caused an
increase in the potential noise. This was probably due to helium
bubbles temporarily insulating the beryllium from the melt. The 1/8-
in. nickel tube was used to bubble helium into the compartment and to
provide electrical contact.

Flow Control of Gases

Hydrogen Fluoride.-- The HF manifold pressure was controlled by
regulating the temperature of the HF supply cylinder. The flow of HF
was controlled by a mass spectrometer leak valve. 3 The gas flowed to
a monel tee where it mixed with H,. The mixed gases were passed either

directly to the HF-H, electrode or a portion was split off for in-

2

fluent gas analysis.
Hydrogen.-- A pressure relief valve (Moore Products Company, dif-
ferential type flow controller, Model 63 BD, modified form) was used

to reduce the hydrogen manifold pressure to a constant value of 3.0 1b.

| gauge. The flow was then controlled by a brass needle valve obtained

from Nuclear Products Company. The H, was then mixed with the HF as
described above.

Helium.-- Helium flow was controlled with the same type .needle

valve used for the Hy3 no attempt was made to control the manifold

pressure since a constant. flow through the beryllium electrode was un-
necessary. :
Titration Assembly |

The NaOH titration vessel was a 200-ml test tube. A rubber stop-
per was inserted into the test tube and was equipped with the following:
Teflon (1/4-in. dia.) entrance and exit tubes for gas, a 5-ml Lab-
Crest microburet, and Beckman No. 39166 (glass, Ag-AgCl) electrodes.
A Beckman Zeromatic II pH meter was used to determine the endpoint.
The pH was maintained on the alkaline side of the endpoint to avoid
glass attack. Duplicate titration assemblies were used to measure in-
fluent and effluent HF concentrations.
Electronic Equipment

An L & N K-3 potentiometer, calibrated with a standard cell from
Eppley Laboratory, Inc., was used to buck out most of the cell voltage.
When the cell voltage exceeded the range of the potentiometer, a
mercury battery (Mallory Duracell No. RM 42R) was connected in series
to extend the bucking voltage range. The voltage of the battery was
checked daily with the potentiometer, and it proved to be an extremely
stable voltage source (+ 0.02 mv/day). The remainder of the cell volt-
age (< 100 mv) was coupled, through a Philbrick Model MP solid state
operational manifold equipped with P65 AU amplifiers, to a Honeywell
Brown Electronik recorder. |

Procedure

Measurements |

The data obtained for each cell measurement were cell potential,

cell temperature, and partial pressures of HF and H,.

 
 

 

 

14

Cell Potential.—- Cell potential measurements were always preced-
ed by standardization of the potentiometer against a standard cell and

a check of the amplifier zero on the recorder. During measurements of

the cell potential, most of the voltage was bucked out by the potentio-
meter (or potentiometer plus mercury battery), and the remainder read
off the recorder. The noise level of the potential varied from + 0.2
mv to as high as + 1.0 mv for the high viscosity melts. Although the
potential fluctuated as indicated, it did not show any drift toward a
higher or lower potential.

H, and HF Partial Pressures.—- The determination of partial

pressures was made as follows:

(1) A measured volume of standardized NaOH was added to the

titration vessel.

(2) The time required for the HF to neutralize the base was

determined.

(3) H, flow rates were determined by the use of a Bubble-0-

Meter.
(4) Influent partial pressures were checked simultaneously in
experiments up to .60 BeF,.
(5) Partial pressure determinations were never begun until the

cell potential had been steady for at least 30 minutes.
(6) Six to ten successive titrations were carried out.

(7) The barometric pressure, temperature of the titraticn as-

sembly, and pressure drop across the system were recorded.

(8) Helium flowed through the beryllium electrode at a rate of
30 to 75 ml/min. This flow rate provided adequate sparging
for this compartment and decreased the thermal gradients.

Helium also protected the electrode from any HF which might

have entered the compartment.
Melt Temperature.-— The temperature of the melt was determined by
a calibrated Chromel-Alumel thermocouple positioned carefully to the
exact depth of the electrode. Positioning was carried out as accurate-
ly as possible to reduce any error in temperature readings caused by
thermal gradients in the melt.

Calculations.—— The required calculations to evaluate Furth, and
E_ were carried out as follows:

(1) The titration times were averaged for a series of titrations
of a fixed increment of standard base. The gas volume passed was then
calculated by (time of titration)/(time per 100 ml of gas) x 100 = ml
of gas.

(2) The number of millimoles of HF removed from the HA stream by

2
the titration was calculated by

(ml NaOH) (conc. of NaOH) = millimoles HF.
(3) 1t was found convenient first to define an approximate
partial pressure of HF gp) by introducing these measured quantities

into the following simple gas law expression

0 (mmoles HF) (0.08206) (abs.temp. of Bubble-0-Meter)
P =

RT
= Myr vo

The exact expression for the partial pressure of HF (Pup) at the e-

.lectrode includes the effect of the pressure drop (AP) caused by the

pressure required to maintain bubbling through the melt and subsequent

titrator, and the saturation of the H, stream with water prior to

2

measuring the flow rate. The relationship (eq. 11) between Pup and

 
 

 

 

16

Pur which is required was developed as follows:

(3.1) The system may be visualized as consisting of three
regions ~ the cell vessel (at Pos T), the titration assembly, and
the Bubble-0-Meter (at p° Ts T %.

(3.2) Assuming that the number of moles of HF passing
_ through the cell assembly and into the titrator is the same for
a given time interval, then

Systematic Errors

The preceding method of calculating partial pressures does not in-
clude corrections for the diffusion of H, through the walls of the
nickel reaction vessel, nor does it consider the effect of thermal dif-
fusion. Melt purity and composition should also be considered as
sources of systematic errors.

Hydrogen Diffusion.— According to published diffusion coef-
ficients? the diffusion of H, out of the nickel reaction vessel
could be a few milliliters per minute at elevated temperatures. The
rate of H, diffusion was measured experimentally by Mathews and Baes’
in a vessel similar to the one used in the present experiment. They
obtained the following rates: 700°C, 0.035 ml/sec; 650°C, 0.025 ml/sec;
600°C, 0.015 ml/sec. Extrapolatioh of these measurements to 800°C and
900°C yields diffusion rates of 0.055 ml/sec and 0.075 ml/sec, re-
spectively. Typically emf experiments were conducted with a H, flow
rate of 2.5 ml/sec. This means that the measured volume of H, would
be in error by 0.6% at 600°C, 1.40% at 700°C, 2.20% at 800°C, and 3.00%
at 900°C. These errors in partial pressures would cause the calculated
potential to be about 1.0 mV lower at 700°C, 1.5 mV lower at 800°C,

and 2.0 mV at 900°C. As mentioned previously, the HF-H, mixtures were

2
analyzed before and after entering the HF-H, electrode compartment, and
no discrepancy between the two could be detected. These analyses were
performed periodically on all compositions up to .60 BeF, and tempera-
tures up to 700°C. Melts of higher BeF, concentrations were not check-

ed in this manner because difficulty was encountered in keeping ‘the

flow rate constant through these high viscosity melts when the split
 

 

 

 

«

19

flow technique was attempted.

Since the H, diffusion effect was not observed at temperatures up
to 700°C, the errors calculated above seem to be somewhat high.

Thermal Diffusion.—- Recognizing the possibility that H, and HF
might tend to separate along the thermal gradient in the reaction
vessel, we carried out an experiment to see if this effect was signifi-
cant.

The total flow of HF-H, passing through the HF-H, electrode was

2 2
varied between 23 ml/min and 160 ml/min. The cell potential increased
by about one millivolt over this range; the increase in cell potential
over the range of flow rates where potential measurements were actually
made (100-160 ml/min) was less than 0.3 millivolt. This is thought to
be sufficient evidence that the thermal diffusion effect was not sig-
nificant.

Gas Cooling Effect .on Electrodes.-— The experiment mentioned above
also indicates that cooling of the electrodes by gas flow could not

have caused more than a one millivolt error in the potential measure-

ments. It was felt that although the possibility of a small error in

‘potential might result from flow rates of 100-160 ml/min, vigorous agi-

tation of the melt was necessary to reduce the effect of thermal -
gradients in the melt. |

Melt Composition.-- A composition error which was discovered at
the end of run No. 4 was apparently caused by distillation of BeF, to
cooler regions of the apparatus. In this particular run, many attempts
were made to measure the cell potential of pure BeF, over a temperature

range of 800°C to 900°C. At these elevated temperatures the vapor

 

 
 

 

 

20

15

pressure of BeF, is appreciable. Evidently loss of BeF, occurred

2
during the periods at high temperatures. Subsequent additions of LiF

were made to bring the BeF, composition down to 0.90 BeF,, 0.80 BeF,,

0.70 BeF,, and finally to 0.33 BeF,. The error was discovered at 0.33

BeF, since the potentials did not correspond to previous measurements.

At this point enough BeF, was added to bring the composition up to a

?
book value of 0.40 BeF, permitting thermal analysis of the liquidus

temperature. Thermal analysis was carried out and compared with the

- LiF-BeF, liquidus data.'® Results indicated that the true composition

2

was 0.388 BeF,. Assuming that all or most of the BeF, was lost before

the LiF additions were begun, the compositions at 0.90, 0.80, and 0.70
BeF,

in E, in the 0.60 BeF, to 0.80 BeF, regions are small; thus, the compo-
sition error at these concentrations should not be significant. How-

ever, the values obtained for 0.33 BeF, in this run were more seriously

2
affected by the uncertainty in composition and were not used.

Melt Impurities.-- Early in the experimental work it was found
that commercial BeF, which contained about 1000-2000 ppm sulfur and
1000 ppm total of Fe, Cr, Cu, and Ni caused "poisoning" of both elect-
rodes. The cell potential would decay as much as 0.5 volts. Spectro-
graphic examination of the Be electrode showed that Fe, Cr, and Ni had
been reduced on the surface of the electrode; also metallic impurities

originally in the beryllium metal were much higher in concentration on

the electrode surface after exposure to the melt. These included Al,

- Mn, and Ti, the most abundant one being aluminum.

The platinum gauze on the HF-H, electrode was darkened by exposure
to these contaminated melts. This effect was not pursued since it was

already evident that BeF, with the impurities mentioned above was not

2
suitable for use with the beryllium electrode.

Distilled BeF,, containing only trace amounts of impurities, was
tested; and none of the problems mentioned above were encountered. This

material was used for all measurements in this investigation.

Oxide Contamination of Melt.-- The oxide chemistry of LiF-BeF,

 

mixtures must be considered since the raw materials contain small a-
mounts of moisture, and since beryllium oxide is an impurity in beryl-
lium metal. Moisture contamination of the melt was kept to a minimum
by freezing the mixtures prior to additions of raw materials. Beryl-
lium fluoride was stored in a dry box prior to use.

A standard purification procedure for removing oxidest’ from fluo-
ride mixture is HF-H, sparging. This procedure was used throughout the
present investigation to remove oxide impurities from the melts. Con-
tinuous use of HF-H, as one of the electrode materials undoubtedly kept
the oxide concentration small. Typically, beryllium metal contains a-
bout 1000 to 4000 ppm oxygen. Using the larger value for oxide con-
tamination, ‘the maximum concentration of oxide contributed by the beryl-
lium electrode would have been 1 x 1073 moles/kg, which is about one
order of magnitude below the solubility of Be0.? Therefore, no sig-
nificant error is expected due to oxide contamination of the melt by

addition of raw materials or from the metal electrode.

 
 

 

22.

Summary.-— The only known systematic errors that might be signifi-
cant are those attributed to H, diffusion and gas cooling of the
electrodes. These are opposite in effect, and both are expected to be
within the experimental scatter of the data.

Random Errors

In order to obtain a satisfactory estimate of the expected pre-

cision of the experimental measurements, the various random errors and

their probable magnitude were considered.

Precision of Potential Measurements.-- Typically short term po-

 

tential fluctuations were about + 0.2 nV for mixtures up to 0.60 BeF,.

These fluctuations increased to about + 1.0 mV for 0.90 BeF, mixtures.

However, even at the higher BeF, concentrations, the average value of
the potential did not change more than + 1.0 mV over a period of one to
two hours. .

Melt Temperature.-- The temperature of the melt was controlled to
+ 0.2°C. The temperature gradient in the melt varied from about 2°C in

melts up to 0.60 BeF.,, to a maximum of 9°C in 0.90 BeF,. However, care

22
was taken during each potential measurement to position the thermo-
couple in the melt so that it coincided within + 1/8-in. of the elect-
rode depths. This should have reduced the temperature uncertainty to
no more than + 0.5°C, which corresponds to an uncertainty of + 0.4 ov
in the potential.

Melt Composition.-- The LiF-BeF, mixtures were prepared by adding
‘weighed amounts of the components to the reaction vessel. The pre-
cision of weighing and transferring materials to the vessel was about

+ 0.2%.

Titer Precision.—- Commercial IN NaOH in one quart bottles was
standardized with potassium acid phthalate. Agreement of the standard-
ization values was about + 0.1% of the average value. The uncertainty
in burette readings during HF titrations was about + 0.5%.

Temperature of Bubble-0-Meter.—- The Bubble-O-Meter temperature,
which was the temperature of the gas as its volume was being measured,
varied no more than + 0.1°C during a given experiment. The same tem-
perature variation applies to the titration vessel where the H, vas
saturated with water.

Flow Rate Determination.-- The precision in the timing of H, flow
rates was 0.1 sec per 100 ml. For a typical value of 50 seconds per
100 ml, this would amount to 0.2%.

Endpoint Precision.-- The precision in timing of the endpoints was
about + 0.3% of the measured value.

H, and HF Flow Rates.-- The H

2 2

the measured value. Successive HF titrations varied as much as + 1.0%

flow rate was constant at + 0.1% of

from the average value. This was apparently due to irregular flow rates
of HF. The variation was random and no bias was noted. The error in-
volved in HF flow rate is much greater than any of the other errors as-

sociated with the calculation of P therefore the others will be con-

HF’
sidered negligible.
Statistical Error Analysis

The probable error to be expected in the calculated cell potential,
E, was determined from the estimated magnitude of random errors in

various quantities which appear in eq. 3. If the contribution of each

observable is related to a calculated function Q and expressed as

 
 

 

 

 

24

Q =f (a,b,c——=),
the contribution of such errors can be calculated. If the errors fol-
low a normal distribution, it can be shown? that the following equa-

tion allows for partial cancellation of errors of opposite sign:

Evaluating the above equation numerically for the uncertainty in the
calculated potential, using typical partial pressures of HF and H, at a
temperature of 1000°K and using the estimated uncertainties of + 0.5 mV,

+ 0.5°C, + 0.001 atm respectively in E, T, and Pup» one obtains

The calculated standard deviation of + 2.2 mV is slightly larger than
the standard deviation obtained from least squaring the actual data.

The range of the standard deviation for the actual data was about 1.0 mV -
to 2.0 mV. The major uncertainty is in the Pup term and is due to the

limited precision of HF flow.

ITI. RESULTS
Tabulation
Table 1 contains the data obtained from each experiment, arranged

according to melt composition.

Experiments

Four separate series of experiments were conducted during this in-

vestigation. The cell potential of each melt composition was determined

 
 

 

 

26

for a range of temperatures. In the first series the reaction vessel

was initially loaded with 0.33 BeF,. Subsequent additions of BeF, were
made to bring the concentrations up to 0.40 BF, , 0.50 BeF,, and to
0.60 BeF,.

In the second series the reaction vessel was initially loaded with

pure BeF,, enough LiF was then added to give 0.90 BeF,, 0.80 BeF,, 0.70

2
BeF,, 0.60 BeF

2°
2s 0.50 BeF,, 0.40 BeF,, and finally 0.33 BeF,. Only one

or two determinations were made for 0.60 BeF, and lower BeF, compo-

sitions since these were checks of previous measurements.
Pure BeF, was also the initial composition for the third series of
measurements. Subsequent additions of LiF were made to give 0.90, 0.80,

0.70, 0.60, and 0.33 BeF As previously mentioned the data for 0.33

9°
BeF, was considered to be in error and was not used.

In the last series of measurements the reaction vessel was loaded

initially with 0.33 BeF Enough LiF was added to give 0.30 BeF,; then

2° 23

BeF, was added to bring the composition back to 0.33 BeF,.
Corrected Cell Potentials

The corrected cell potentials (E) for various compositions are

plotted as a function of temperature and shown in Fig. 5. E, is assumed

to be a linear function of temperature, E, = A+BT, over the temperature
range investigated. The data points for each composition were least
squared, and the calculated lines are also shown in Fig. 5. The para-

meters from the least squaring treatment are listed in Table 2.

IV. DISCUSSION

Thermodynamics of LiF-BeF,

The activity of BeF, may be calculated from eq. (4) using the emf
data (E)) obtained in this study if the appropriate values for the
standard cell potential (E%) are known. As mentioned previously, sever-
al attempts were made to determine E° experimentally, but values of use-
ful accuracy could not be obtained because of high melt viscosity and
possibly because of high electrical resistivity.

The values of E, obtained. for various BeF, compositions do not lend
themselves to direct extrapolation to E°. However, the standard cell
potential may be calculated by relating data in this study with the BeF,
liquidus data in the following manner. If the assumption is made that

the standard cell potential (E°) varies linearly with temperature

 
 

 

 

30

(E® = A+BT)* then eq. (4) may be written

RT
E, = (A+BT) - 5F Ln %BeF,

This relationship permits correlation of the data (E) obtained in the
present investigation with the phase diagram data. 1? A plot of the a-
bove expression as 2FE JT vs 1/T should be linear since the intercept
and slope contain only constants. Using the least square parameters for
each composition (Table 2), values for E, were calculated for the
liquidus temperatures at 0.515, 0.60, 0.70, 0.80 and 0.90 BeF, (see
footnote ) and then plotted according to eq. (17) (Fig. 6). The result-

ing points follow the predicted linear relationship within their pre-

Slope = 113.84 + 2.48 ,(Kcal) = 2FA + AH (19)

The point at 0.90 BeF, was not used because the uncertainty in E, is

2
relatively large.

Values for A and B were calculated using various literature values

for the heat of fusion of BeF, and a melting point of 555°C for pure

BeF,. A tabulation of these values is shown in Table 3. The values of

A and B which are consistent with values obtained in the present in-
vestigation are those for which the heat of fusion is assumed to be 2.0

kcal/mole or less as shown in Fig. 7. A heat of fusion for BeF,, >2.0

kcal/mole yields values of E® which are greater than corresponding values
of E, at the higher BeF, concentration. This creates an impossible

situation where the activity of BeF, in the mixture is greater than the
activity of pure liquid BeF,. Thus measurements in the present study
clearly support the lower values for the heat of fusion for BeF,."”
The emf data (E.) obtained in the present study were fitted by
least squares to the sipressions listed in Table 4, using the lowest

literature value (1.13 kcal/mole) for the heat of fusion of BeF A

9°
plot of the smoothed lines for E, at various BeF, concentrations is
shown in. Fig. 8. The pressure corrected cell potentials (E)) differed
by 1.4097 standard deviations from the smoothed values given by eq. 4-1
(Table 4), and the average deviation of E, from smoothed values was

approximately + 2.5 mV. The average deviation is consistent with the

value predicted by the error analysis for E..

A Gibbs-Duhem integration of the expression for YBeF, Table 4) was
carried out to give the corresponding expression for YiiF (eq. 4-4,
Table 4). The integration constant for eq. 4-4 was determined by com-~
parison with YIiF values derived from the liquidus data’? and a heat of
fusion of 6.47 kcal/mole for LiF. A more accurate evaluation of the
integration constant should be possible when the heat of mixing measure-
nents of Holm and Kleppa’? become available for the LiF-BeF, system.

Smoothed values of YBeF, are shown as a function of composition at
several temperatures in Fig. 9. These results are consistent with those
obtained by Mathews and Baes’ over a composition range 0.30 to 0.60 BeF,.

However, at XpoF. 0.60 the results are not in agreement. The values

2
obtained in the present study are thought to be the more reliable since

they are consistent with both the phase data and with a low heat of
fusion for BeF,. The previous measurements at compositions > 0.60 BeF,

might be in error because of difficulties in mixing LiF-BeF, at high

BeF., concentrations and because of the effects of Be0 saturation. In

2
the present study it was found that at 0.90 Bef, , a well-mixed melt was
not obtained until the temperature was raised above 850°C. This pro-
cedure was followed for all high BeF, concentrations to ensure proper

mixing of the LiF-BeF Another possible error in the previous measure-

2°
ments could have been the presence of Be0 as a saturating solid. The
solubility of Be0 might tend to influence the BeF, activity more at high
BeF, concentrations.

The free energy and heat of the cell reaction (eq. 1) were calcu-

lated assuming a heat of fusion for BeF, = 1.13 kcal/mole. These values

combined with the available thermochemical values for are l were used

to derive the free energy and heat of formation for liquid Bef, at 900°K
(Table 5). Mathews and Baes’ measured the equilibrium quotient for the
reaction

H,0(g) + BeF, (d) Z 2HF(g) + BeO(s) (20)

If eq. (20) is combined with the reaction in eq. (1) the resulting re-

action is

H,0(g) + Be(s) Z BeO(s) + H, (8) (21)

The free energy and heat of this last reaction thus could be obtained by
combining the two sets of measurements, and, since the thermochemical
data for H,0 are accurately known, improved free energy and heats of
formation for Be0 could be calculated. These are shown in Table 5. The
preceding calculations for BeF, and Be0 were made for a temperature of

900°K. Values for other temperatures were generated using the heat

capacity data in the JANAF Tables. ?!

Reference Electrodes
Both electrode half-cells used in the present investigation per-
formed acceptably for use as reference electrodes, both being stable and

reproducible.

Beryllium Electrode

The Be|Be?” electrode should work well in any melt containing beryl-
lium ions and no reducible cations. Potential fluctuations due to this
electrode were masked in the present study by the fluctuations due to
the HF-H, electrode, but should be less than + 0.1 mV. Beryllium e-
lectrodes were fabricated from three different batches of beryllium

metal and no discrepancies in potentials were noted when the electrodes

were interchanged. Therefore, the electrode response does not appear to
be a function of a particular batch of beryllium metal.

The beryllium electrode does not appear to be suitable for small
cell compartments since mass transfer causes the electrode to become en-
larged due to spongy deposition of the Be metal, and eventually electri-

cal shorts develop between the electrode and the cell compartment wall.

HF-H Electrode

2

The Pt, HF,H, |F electrode should be a suitable reference electrode
in any fluoride-containing melt where there is no possibility of oxida-~
tion by HF or reduction by H,. The solubility of HF in LiF-BeF, is
10w23 (about 0.0003 mole fraction for the partial pressures of HF used
in this study), and no significant solubility of H, is expected in this
system. Potential fluctuations due to this electrode appear to be a
function of the melt viscosity. Fluctuations are about + .1 mV in melts
with a viscosity of one poise or less. |

The precision of this electrode was limited somewhat in the present
study by the method of HF delivery, as previously mentioned. In future
experiments the H,-HF mixture will be obtained by passing H, through a
thermostated NaHF, bed. It is hoped that this will be a more precise.
