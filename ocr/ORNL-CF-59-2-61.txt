INTRODUCTION

High temperature fluid fuel reactors sing molten fluorides have been pro-
posed for the production of nuclear power.: »2 “The core or blanket salt in this

 type’reactor would be ideally & 1i!F-BeFo mixture for optimum neutron moderation and
economy. This materiel would act as a solvent or carrier for the fluorides of the

fissile or fertile elements, uranium, plutonium and thorium. The feasibility and
economic Justification of such & reactor system depends on fuel processing, i.e., a
processing method that will maintain the desired neutron economy and reactor opera
bility at a reasonable cost. This paper presents a description of a new chemical
process for this type of fluoride fuel based on two principles, namely, volatiliza-
tion of UF, from the reactor sdlt by fludrination and recovery of the 14TF~BeFp
solvent salt for reuse by a HF dissolution process.

MOLTEN SALT REACTOR DESCRIPTION

The Aircraft Reactor Experiment, in which NeF-ZrF,-U2>°F, fuel circulated
through inconel tubing in BeO moderator, demonstrated the basic feasibility of a
high temperature molten salt reactor. Detailed calculations for & power reactor
ye been published on 600 Mw heat two-region homogenéous machines using 63 mole %

F--37 mole % BeFp with up to 1 mole % UF) and ThF) as a core salt and T1 mole %
14TF--16 mole % BeFp--13 mole % ThF) as a blanket salt®, The reactor design used
es reference in this paper has a uranium (U233 or F352) inventory of 600-1000 kg
(varying with time) with an 8-ft-dia core and a total fuel volume of 530 £t3 (33%: £t3
external to the core). The core salt weight is epproximately 75,000 lb, the blanket
150,000 1b. :

In the reference reactor at least 90% of the power is produced in the core, yield-
ing ebout 180 kg of fission products per year. After operation for one year without

processing (except inert ges removal), the fission products absorb sbout 3.8% of all

neutrons and UP3% end 1233 ebsorb ebout 3.9%. If the reactor fuel is processed for
fission product removal at the rate of one fuel volume per ar , afte years, the
fission products would ebsorb 2.7% of the neutrons; 23 #3 sy and 3 would ab-
sorb 10.4% (mostly P36); end Np237 about 0.9%. Without fuel processing neutron
absorption by fission products would continue. to increase almost linearly with time,
exceeding 10% after 10 years; Np=37 would build up at an accelerating rate, absorbing - .
about 3% of -the neutrons after 10 years; the smount of fissionable material required
to keep the reactor critical would increese by about 200 kg/year; and the conversion
ratio would decrease markedly. : :

Even-mumbered ureniun isotopes » particularly R36, are the worst poisons, but
their removal is beyond the scope of chemical reprocessing. Of the 180 kg of
fission products per year 22 atom % with halfelives of more than 78 min ere

subject to removal from the reactor as rare gases; these would contribute 26%

of the fission product poisoning for 100 ev neutrons. About 26 atom % of the

long-lived fiesion products are rare earths, which contribute L0% of the total
fission product poisoning. The rest of the fission products consist of a wide
variety of elements, no one of vhich is outstan FF the nuclear poisoning
point of view. After reasonably long operation Np 7 1s the worst individual

poison other than the rare earths.

FLUGRIDE VOLATILITY PROCESS FOR MSR FUEL

Fluoride volatilization processing for uranium recovery appears feasible
for molten salt reactor (MSR) fuel on the basis of laboratory studies. It is
based on direct fluorination of the fuel salt to convert UF) to UFg with atten-
dent volatilization and recovery. Similar volatility processes have been pro-
posed and developed for zirconium alloy reactor fuel elements after dissolution
in fused salt. One of these, the ORNL Volatility Process, was successfully
used for recovery and decontamination of uranium from the NaF-Zr Fy, ~UF), salt
fuel of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment.” The MSR volatilization process would
differ, however; from other volatility processes in that complete decontamina-
tion of the product UF. would not be essential, since it could be remotely re-
duced to UF), and reconstituted into reactor salt.

A series of small-scale fluorinations was carried out with a U8 nole %
LiF--52 mole % BeF, eutectic mixture containing about 0.8 mole % UF,. (MSR
fuel would contain“0.25 to 1.0 mole % UF, , depending on the operating time. )
The eutectic salt was used instead of the ’ fuel selt in order. to investigate
lower temperature operation. In fluorinations at 50, 500, and 550°C, the
rate of uranium removal increased with the temperature (Table 1).

The thorium-containing blanket salt cannot be processed for uranium re-
covery at as low a temperature as that used to process the fuel salt.

The uranium concentration in the blanket, however, is very low; it has been esti-
mated that with continuous processing at the rate of one blanket volume per year,
the blanket salt (LiF-BeF, ~ThF), , T1<16<13 mole %) will contain approximately
0.004 mole % UF, (140 ppm) after ome year and 0.01k mole % UF), after 20 years.
Fluorinations of two such mixtures at 600°C for 90 min -gave uranium concentra~-
tions in the salt of 1-2 ppm, the lowest uranium concentrations ever obtained

"in fused salt laboratory fluorinations, Over 90% of the uranium was removed

in 15 min. It is concluded, therefore, that fluorination of uranium from blanket
salt can be accomplished.

The behavior -of protactinium in the blanket salt during fluorination is of

| interest, although the protactinium is not lost, in any case, since the salt is
returned to the reactor. A IiF-BeF,-ThF k, 71-16-13 mole %) mixture containing

sufficient irradiated thorium to port a 33 concentration of 5.5 x 10-9 g per
gram of salt was fluorinated for 150 min at 600°C; there was no measurable de-
crease in protactinium ectivity in the salt. Protactinium volatilization in

the process seems to be unlikely. ~ However, the protactinium concentration in
the blanket of the reference design reactor is higher (~10° g per gram of salt).

11 'F-BeF, SALT RECOVERY WITH HF

Experimental work hes demonstrated that the LiF-BeF, salt can be pro-
cessed by dissolution in anhydrous or nearly anhydrous liquid hydrogen fluoride.

" Decomtemination of the IiF-BeF, salt from the majér neutron poisons, rare earths

and neptunium, is achieved due“to the relative insolubility of the fluorides
of these elements in such solutions. The LiF-BeF, galt is recoverable from the
HF solution by evaporation.

It_is well kyown that BeF, is very soluble and IiF is rather insoluble in
water in contrast to liquid where the reverse is true. In drous HF the
polyvelent element fluorides generally exhibit low solubilities.” Initial con-

sideration of the problem suggested thet use of aqueous HF (greater than 80% HF)
would give sufficient solubility of both IF and BeFo to meet process objectives.
The solubility studies were-therefore carried out over the range of 70-100% HF.

However, in addition to the mixed solvent -effect there existed also the possi-
bility thet anhydrous HF would be suitable as a solvent foi the IiF-BeF, salt
oouplex in the ahalogous, sense that cryolite , Ne AlF., is quite soluble whereas
is insoluble in HF. 1 Some emphasis was therefore placed on using "anhydrous"
BF Bin the material being obtained by -vepor transfer from e comercial tank
(nominal containing less then 0. 1%, water). ~

I4F was more soluble at higher temperatures if waler was present in the solvent,
‘but the effect of temperature on BeFp solubility wes not definitely established.
The I4iF solubility decreased rapidly as water was added to anhydrous HF, and
the BeF, solubility increased from near zero; the solubilities were roughly the
seme 1n°80 wt % EF, 25 to 30 g/kg. The Bek vas glassy in pature and dissolved
slowly. ‘The solubility values reported for I4F in Teble 2, except at 12%, were
obtained after refluxing HF over the salt for 3 hr. No further messurements
were made with LiF or BeF, alone, since the solubilities of the two components
together were of primary Importance. Co

The solubility of BeF, was also messured et various HF concentrations and -
temperatures in the presence of IiF. The results generally confirmed that the
presence of IiF as well as water increases the BeF, solubility. A plot of
solubility velues at one temperature (12°C) 11lustrates both effects (Fig. 1).
These end data at other temperatures are presented in Tebles 4, 5, and 6. The
favorable effect of water on BeF, solubility is shown particularly in 70 and
80% HF solutions (Teble 4). BeF,; solubllity was enhanced further when 70, 80,
and 90 wt $ HF solutions were saturated with LiF (Table 5). Because of the
increase in BeF, solubility at higher HF concentrations when IAF is present,
the 90-100% HF renge was studied further (Teble 6), The solubilities in epproxi-
mately 100% EF eppear sufficiently high for process purposes.

The results presented here must be considered preliminary. Beryllium
solubilities, in particular, may be generally higher than indicated because
of analytical problems. Difficulty was also encountered in determining accu-
rately the water content in highly concentrated HF, This wae partly a problem

of sempling the volatile solutions and partly the result of determining the

small emount of water by the difference of the sample weight and the total
‘weight of IdF, BeFp, and HF. -

S6lubility measurements were made also on 63-37 mple $ LiF-BeFp galt
(48-52 wt %) in the 80 to 98 wt § HF range (fable 7). This salt contained

“about 0.1 mole % ZrFyy 0.2 mole % mixed vere earth fluorides (lindsey Code 370),

and trace fission products (see following section). The salt vas crushed but
not ground -to & powder; average particles were flakes about 10 mils thick and

"50 to 100 mils across. The solutions were sampled 15 and 60 min after salt

addition to permit an estimate of the rate of dissolution. ‘The results indi-

cated that an apprecisble concentretion is reached rapidly, but that the solu-

tions ere not saturated, especially with respect to BeFp, in less than several
days. They also demonstrate that the fused salt behaves similarly to the two

components edded individually.

FISSION PRODUCT DECONTAMINATION IN THE EF SOLUTION FROCESS

The aqueous EF solutions of the selt from the preceding experiment were

filtered through sintered nickel, end radiochemical enzlyses were made to de-

termine the fission product solubilities or decontemination effect. The results
(Table 8) show that rere earths, as represented by cerium, were relatively in-
soluble in the HF solution and were therefore effectively separated from the salt.

The solubility decreased as the .HF concentration was increased. The total rare
earth (TRE) and trivalent rare earth (except cerium) analyses do not show this
separation because of the presence of the yttrium daughter of strontium. No rare
earth activity other than cerium (and yttrium) was detected in the HF solutions.
The slight apparent decontamination from strontium is not understood; strontium

is expected to be fairly soluble in these solutions. Cesium is known to be soluble,
and ell cesium in the salt added apparently dissolved.

Thus the rare earths, as represented by cerium, are removed from LiF-BeF,
selts by dissolution of the salt in an aqueous HF solution, and strontium and
cesium ere not. The rare earth solubllity ih these HF solutions saturated with
IAF and BeF, increased from about 10™+ mole % in 98 wt % HF to 0.003 mole % in
80 wt % HF, based on the amount of LiF + BeF, dissolved. Reactor fuel with a
1-year fuel cycle will contain rare earths af a concentration of about 0.05 mole.

SOLUBILITIES OF HEAVY ELEMENTS IN HF

Neptunium is the most series nuclear poison other than the rare earths in
e molten salt reactor, burning 2,

The neptunium solubility in 80 to 100% HF saturated with LiF and BeF, was
found sufficiently low to permit its removal-elong with the rare earths (Fable 9).
For these determinations small quantities of neptunium (aqueous Fp" nitrate solu-
tion) were added incrementally to HF solutions saturated with I4F end BeF,. The
concentration of nitrate so added was ~0.02% of the fluoride concentration. Solu-
bilities ere reported in mg Fp per g solution and in mole % of neptunium relative
to dissolved LiF-BeF, salt.

The neptunium was determined by alpha counting with pulse analysis to dis~-
tinguish neptunium from plutonium activity present as an impurity. The plutonium
appeared to be carried with the neptunium to a considerable extent; the ratio of

the amount of plutonium in solution to the emount undissolved wes within a fac=-
. tor of 2 of the ratio for neptunium elthough:the plutonium concentration was

smaller by a factor of 500.

-Addition of iron and nickel metal to the HF solutions resulted in a signi-
ficant reduction in the gross « activity, probably as the result of reduction
to Np(III) “end Pu(III) . This bas not yet been verified by pulse analysis.

The trivalent state might be expeéted to behave in somewhat the same way ae
the rare earths; the observed solubilities are in the same range as those re-
portéd previously for rere earths. It is expected that the rare earths, nep-
tunium, plutonium, end possibly urenium will behave as a single group and
therefore exhibit lower solubilities when present together than the values

‘reported here for the separate components .

Measurements of the solubilities of thorium end uranium fluorides in 90
to 100% HF indicate that uranium and thorium ere relatively insoluble. All
ThF), determinations showed less than 0.03 mg of thorium per gram of solution,

and solubilities were generally in the range 0.005-0.010 mg of uranium per
gram of solution. In the presence of fresh iron or nickel metal solu~
bilities were somewhat lower, 0.002-0.005 mg/g, indiceting perhaps a higher
solubility for higher oxidation states. Relative to dissolved salt these
solubilities are the order of 0.001 mole %.

SOLUBILITY OF CORROSION PRODUCT FLUGRIDES IN HF SOLVENT

Measurements were made of the solubilities of corrosion products
fluorides (iron, chromium, end nickel) in HF solutions saturated with

 I4F. Chromium fluoride was relatively soluble, with velues of about 8,

12, and 18 mg of chromium per grem of solution in 100, 95, and 90 wt % HF,
respectively. Tron and nickel fluorides were less soluble. Measurements
of the iron fluoride golubility varied from 0.08 to 2 mg iron per gram of
solution; the average and average deviation neglecting extreme values: was
0.1% + 0.10. Measurements of the nickel fluoride solubility varied from.
0.01 to 1.3 mg of nickel per gram of solution, the average being 0.15 +
0.06. The results were so incensistent that no trend with HF concentra-
tion could be established. When iron, nickel and chromium fluorides were
present together, the solubilities of all appeared to be somewhat lower.

Similar meesurements in 90 end 100% EF (no dissolved salt) fell in
the same range, but in 80 wt % HF the iron and nickel solubilities appeared
to be significantly higher. E

RECOVERY OF SALT FROM SOLUTION

The IiF end BeF, salt can be recovered from the HF solutions by
evaporation. There 2s some question of hydrolysis of the salt in re-
covery, the result particulerly of the existence of a high-boiling
azeotrope at 38 wt % HF, which would be obtained if some water was
present initielly and if flash evaporation was not used. A'90% HF
solartion-satureted with IAF and BeF,, was slowly evaporated to dryness
and heated to 450°C, X-ray diffraction indicated that the resulting
salt was about 90% 2LiFeBeFo end 10% BeF,, and petrographic examination
indicated Yess than 3% of material other then these fluorides. A se=
cond sample was eyeporated after addition ef & little NH,F (which would
decompose and perhaps hydrefluorinate the salt at elevated températures)
and fused at 700°C. This s&lt eppeered to be entirely the binary com-
pound, &nd the x-ray pattern ¥as somewhat cleaner than in the first case.
‘However; hydrolysis did not eppear to be a significant factor in any
event. ” Le Le

PROCESS FLOWSHEET FOR REACTCR PROCESSING

A tentative flowsheet for spplication of the fluoride volatility
and HF dissolution processes to molten salt reactor fluids has been

salt as UFg befpre HF dissolution of the salt, although the reverse might

be feasible in some circumstances. The IiF«BeF, salt is then dissolved
in concentrated HF (>00% HF) for separation prifierily from the rare earth
and neptunium neutron poisons. The salt is re-formed in an evaporation
step, from which it would proceed to & final mekeup and purification step.

The latter would perhaps involve the H, end HF treatment now believed

necessary for ell salt used in a reactor. The UFg produced in the vola-
t11ity process would be converted to UF), for reuse in salt by hydrogen
reduction, or alternately it could possibly be reduced in situ in the

| fused salt by essentially the same method. Although-the volatility

Process achieves high decontamination, and the dissolution process leads
to thec@limination of. the rare earths and neptunium activities, the salt

recycle would require ‘shielding and remote operation.

The scale of the process with a _l=year cycle, relative to the
reactor, is indicated in Fig. 3. The daily core salt processing rate
would be about 125 kg containing about 4 kg of uranium. Assuming e
10% solubility for LiF-BeF, in the HF solution the solution processing
rate would be less than one- liter per te for the reference reactor
(260 Mir electric). The daily blagket processing rate would be ebout 250 kg
containing only about 0.1 kg of P33 vhich would be recovered by the fluo-
ride volatility process. The blanket selt would then be returned to the
reactor, after treatment to remove corrosion products, if necessary. In-
frequent processing of the blanket salt to remove fission products would
be required since at most a few percent of the fissions occur in the
blanket. Although more development of some of the process chemistry is
certainly needed, the principal features of the process appear to be
suited to the objectives for processing molten salt reactor fuel. Mich
more work will be needed for developing chemical flowsheets for specific
reactor systems.

HIGH~TEMPERATURE PROCESSING |

The direct removal of rare earths from molten fluorides was in-
vestigated briefly using two methods --oxide precipitation and partial
salt crystallization. “These results were generally not favorable and
were not pursued further. -An alternative approach which appears to

\

have considerable premise consists of direct equilibration of tog salt

with a bed of CeF3 to remove the worse poisons, the reve earths.

Oxide precipitation, achieved by small additions to the fused salt
of water or Cal, was tried with 50-50 mole % NaF-ZrFj, and 11.5-42-46.5
mole % NaF-KF-LiF since it had not been determined at the time that
1iF-BeF, selt would definitely be preferred: Trace fission products
vere added. Oxide addition results in precipitation of primarily -

zirconium in the case of zircontun-beering salt without too mich effect

on fission product activities (uranium if present would behave similerly to zir-
conium). However, in FaF-KF-LiF salt, the rere earth, zirconium, and niobium
activities were effectively removed since a large emount of zirconium (or other
oxide forming material) was not present. In the cade of LiF-BeF, (63-37 mole %
and 50-50 mole 4) salt, Cal or water vapor addition caused precipitetion of zir-
conium end niobium activities, with little effect on the rare earths or other
activities. Co Cee

Partiel freezing by slow cooling of both KaF-KF-LiF end NaF-ZrF) salt con-
taining 0.2 mole § rare earth fluoride resulted in a concentration in the unfrozen
liquid of most fission products, including cesium, strontium, and rere earths.

The concentration factors were generelly less than 2 and elways less than 3. The
solubilities of these components are considersbly higher than their concentrations
in these salts. However, partial freezing of IiF-BeFp (50-50 mole % and 63-37

~ mole %) end FaF-BeF, (63-37 mole %), each containing 0.2 mole % rare earth fluo~

rides, 0.1 mole % ZF) end trace fission products, resulted in.e decrease in rare
earth activity in the unfrozen liquid. This is the result of the solubility being
less at the melting point than the 0.2 mole 4 rare earth concentration.
