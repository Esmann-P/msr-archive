Introduction

The design of a heat exchanger for removing MSRE thermal power was based on
utilizing as much as possible the existing facilities and equipment in the
Aircraft Reactor Test building 7503. Since these facilities included blowers,
motors, ducting, and a stack for discharge of air to the atmosphere, an air-
cooled coil or radiator seemed to be most feasible,

Because the secondary piping system of the MSRE, of which the radiator is a
part, will contain a LiF-BeF2 salt mixture from which the reactor heat is to
be extracted, the design entailed determining the size and configuration of

the radiator coil based on the physical properties of this salt and the amount
of cooling air available. Also included in the design was an integral support-
ing frame work-insulated enclosure for the coil. Because the LiF-BeF2 salt
mixture freezes at about 850°F, provisions were made for supplying heat to the
coil to keep this secondary salt fluid during reactor down periods.’ Control
of air flow rates over the coil, necessary baffling, and duct modifications
were also determined.

Radiator _Design

1. Secondary Salt Flow Rate

 

The secondary salt which will remove heat from the fuel solution in the
primary heat exchanger and reject heat to the atmosphere in the radiator
will consist of a mixture of 66 mol % LiF and 34 mol 7% BeF=. For MSRE
operation at 10 Mw thermal power, the secondary salt temperature drop
through the coil was selected as 75°F. (1l00°F inlet temperature, 1025°F
outlet temperature.) The flow rate necessary for 10 Mw heat transference
capacity was found to be 830 gpm.

2. Air Flow Rate

Air will be supplied by two 250 hp axial blowers left from the ART program.
Each blower is rated at 82,500 cfm at 15 in. water static pressure, or
114,000 cfm free air delivery. For 10 Mw reactor power operation, the air
temperature rise across the coil was set at 200°F. Assuming an air inlet
temperature of 100°F, the temperature of the air leaving the coil would be
300°F. For this air temperature rise, 164,000 cfm of air will be required
to reject 10 Mv of thermal energy to the atmosphere.

3. Coil Size and Configuration

The coil size and configuration depends on both the secondary salt and air
flow rates, A first estimate of the coil area required was obtained by
assuming an overall heat transfer coefficient of 55 Btu/hr-°F- £t® and solving
for A in the equation

= UAAE 3

For 3/4 in. OD x 0. 072 in. wall tubing, the surface area is 0.1963 ££2/fe

of tubing would be required. An arbitrarily selected tube length of 30 ft
gave a total of about 122 tubes. Because of space limitations in the existing
ductwork and because of the physical layout of the reactor secondary salt
system piping, an S-shaped coil of 120 tubes, each 30 ft long, was proposed
for calculating the actual radiator performance, The 120 3/4 in. OD tubes

were arranged in 10 rows with 12 tubes per row with a l% in. square pitch.
Tube rows were staggered. See Figs. 1 and 2,

which agrees closely with the assumed value of 55 Btu/hr-£t2-°F. Therefore,
the assumed values for tube length, arrangement and configuration were
acceptable.

The bulk secondary salt and air temperatures were taken as the arithmetic
average, giving 1062.5°F for the salt and 200°F for the air. The temperature
drops across each film and the pipe wall were then calculated.

MSRE Operation at Power Levels Less than 10 Mw

 

Because the MSRE will not always operate at 10 Mw, it was necessary to

determine the radiator operating characteristics for all reactor power
levels.

By use of the variable-speed fuel-circulating pump, the flow rate of the-
fuel through the primary heat exchanger may be varied. The secondary
salt flow rate, however, is to be maintained constant. The amount of
heat extracted from the secondary salt as it passes through the radiator
is thus controlled by the amount of air forced over the radiator coil.
Control of the air flow rate then will be the most sensitive reactor
power level control.

The effective At's between the fuel and secondary salt in the primary
heat exchanger for various reactor power levels have been estimated, and
are given below.® From these figures, and assuming that the secondary

salt flow rate will be constant, the corresponding secondary salt tempera-
ture changes in the radiator were calculated. The air mass-flow rates to
achieve these secondary salt temperature changes in the radiator were then
calculated by assuming a constant air inlet temperature of 100°F and using
the correlations given above. (Equations 1 and 2.) The results are shown
in Fig. 3 along with the air temperature rise through the radiator.

Cooling Air

Air for cooling the radiator will be supplied by two 250 hp vane-axial
blowers left from the ART program. Each blower is rated at. 82,500 cfm at
15 in. water static pressure, or 114,000 cfm free air delivery. The
blowers are provided with horizontal multibladed dampers, gang-operated
by air-operated motors, to prevent 'blow-back when a blower is not in
operation.

A bypass duct with a controlled damper will be provided to short-circuit
part of the air flow around the radiator. The purpose of the duct is
threefold:

cr i rh AI 2 PACA UY RO Sn An

10.

1. At low reactor power levels, the air leaving the radiator will be at
very high temperatures as shown in Fig. 3. During these periods, the
bypass damper will be open allowing cooler air to mix with the high
temperature air to keep the duct at a temperature below 300°F. At
higher reactor power levels when the air leaving the radiator is at a
lower temperature, the bypass damper will be closed.

2. The bypass duct will be used to reduce the wind force on the radiator
and radiator door in event of power failure or reactor scram. In either
of these occurrences, the radiator doors will be closed and the fans
will be running down, still delivering air. This air will then be routed
around the radiator through the open bypass duct reducing the air static
pressure on the radiator.

3. During reactor-down periods when heat is being supplied to the radiator
coil in the enclosed radiator frame, the bypass duct will be open to
reduce the stack effect across the radiator.

Radiator Frame and Doors

The radiator frame will be mainly structural steel; members exposed to high
temperatures will be stainless steel. The radiator frame will be completely
enclosed, insulated, and equipped with radiant heat shields to protect the
structural members from high temperatures. The radiant heat shields and
insulation will also limit radiator heat loss during reactor-down periods
while maintaining the secondary salt in the fluid state by supplying heat
from an external source. Baffles will be made integral with the frame to
direct the air over the radiator coil.

The secondary salt inlet header of the radiator coil assembly will be
anchored to the frame; the secondary salt outlet header will be allowed
to move in the horizontal direction to allow for thermal expansion of the
secondary piping and the radiator coil.

The coil will be suspended from hangers which will allow thermal expansion,
support the weight of the coil, and maintain coil tube spacing.

The radiator frame will also contain provisions for two vertically-
operating insulated doors. The doors will close off the air passage over
the coil to reduce heat loss from the coil during reactor-down periods.

The doors are suspended from roller chains which run over sprockets to a
single counter-weight which weighs less than the combined weights of the

two doors. When the doors are in the up (open) position, the counter-

weight is held down by three magnets, any two of which are capable of holding
this weight. In event of power failure or reactor scram; the magnets release
the counter-weight and the doors are allowed to fall freely. At other times
the doors will be lowered by an electric motor through a magnetic clutch-
brake arrangement, This same arrangement will also be used to raise the
doors. The doors will normally be either fully open or closed; however, it
will be possible with the magnetic clutch-brake to position them at any

point in between, The doors will be guided by means of rollers that travel
in a machined track so that "cocking of a door is prevented.
 

 

 

 

~~

11.

Duct

 

The existing duct will be modified to provide as smooth a transition as
possible from the fan outlet to the radiator coil inlet. A bypass duct,
described above, will also be installed.

Heating

During periods when the reactor is not operating, it will be necessary
to supply heat to the radiator coil to keep the secondary salt in the
fluid state. When this heating is required, the radiator doors will be
closed, the bypass duct will be open, and the radiator coil essentially
isolated from the ambient atmosphere.

Heat will be supplied to the radiator coil by means of panels containing
electric resistance heating elements embedded in a ceramic material. These
panels will be located on the horizontal and vertical surfaces of the air
baffles adjacent to the tubes of the radiator coil. Heat transmission from
the panels to the coil will be primarily by radiation, with some convection
caused by the air heated within the enclosure.

Conclusions

The radiator will contain a coil which consists of 120 ®/4 in. OD x 0.072
in. wall tubes spaced 1% in. apart on centers in a square pitch arrangement.
(Fig. 1) Each S-shaped tube is approximately 30 ft in length and terminates
in a 2% in, pipe mdnifold which is connected to an 8 in. ID header. Total
heat transfer surface: area is about 706 sq. ft. The headers are connected
to the 5 in. secondary salt circulating piping. (Fig. 2) Tubes, manifolds,
headers, and secondary piping are all INOR-8.

The secondary salt mixture of 66 mol % LiF and 34 mol % BeFz will be circu-
lated through the radiator at 830 gpm and will undergo a T5°F temperature
drop as it loses 10 Mw of heat. Cooling air will be supplied by two 250 hp
vane-axial blowers each capable of delivering 82,500 cfm of air at 15 in.
water static pressure, or 114,000 cfm free air delivery.

For 10 Mw heat removal, 164,000 cfm of air with a temperature rise of 200°F
across the radiator will be required. The air pressure drop across the
radiator was calculated to be 12.5 in. water static pressure, and the overall
heat transfer coefficient was calculated to be 52. 4 Btu/hr-ft2-°F under these
conditions.

A curve of cooling air required and air temperature rise for various reactor
power levels is shown in Fig. 3.

The radiator coil will be enclosed in an insulated frame equipped with
vertically operating insulated doors. During periods when it is necessary
to supply heat to the radiator to maintain the secondary salt in a liquid
state, the doors will be closed forming a reasonably air-tight enclosure.
 

 

 

12.

Heat will be supplied to the radiator coil during reactor~-down periods by
panels of electrical resistance heaters installed in baffles adjacent to
the tube rows.
