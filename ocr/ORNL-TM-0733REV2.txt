OPERATING SAFETY LIMITS FOR

ow

THE MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

Beall
Guymon

br bd

This document has been prepared at the request of the U. S. Atomic

Energy Commission to set the limits for various parameters related to the

Molten-5al1t Reactor Experiment.

In some cases the limits report the level

at which the reactor will be shut down by automatic monitoring devices.

In all cases the reactor operators are obligated to take steps intended to

correct a parameter which 1: temporarily outside the specified range indi-

cated herein.

1.0 Containment

1.1 Ieakage from the primary system as indicated by the reactor and

drain-tank-cell air activity will not exceed the equivalent of

L liters of salt after 120 days of operation at full power, as

estimated in the case of the Most Probable Accident.?

Offgas

activity release will be limited to fission-product concen-

trations averaging less than 1.5 x 1074 ue /ce in the stack.?®

Fission-product release will be monitored by radiation monltcrs

on the offgaes lines and at the stack.

1.2

The cover-gas supply pressure will be kept at 30 psig or greater

and the leak-detector system pressure gbove 50 psig to help prz-

vent excessive exposure to operating personnel, as specified

in Chapter 0524 of the AEC Manual.’

1.0 Contaimmert (continued)

1.3 The radioactivity in the reactor cell service lines will be
maintained at a level sufficiently low to prevent excessive
exposure to personnel, as specified in Chapter 0524 of the

AEC Manual.

1.k The pressure in tke reactor and drain tank cells will be main-

tained below atmospheric pressure during reactor operation.

1.5 The maximum reactor and drain-tank-cell leak rate will not he
allowed to exceed 1% of the cell volume per day, calculated
for the conditions of the Maximum Credible Accident.! The

in-leakage rate will be determined at least once per week.

1.6 The maximum vapcr-condsasing system pressure (under nonaccidern
conditions) will zot exceed 3 psig.
R2 1.7 During reactor operation the level of water in the vapor-condensing
tank shall be checked at least once a week to insure that it
remains in the ranze required for proper operation (8000 to

9300 gallons).

1.8 The building high-bay pressure will be maintained at slightly
less than atmospheric pressure (~ 0.1 in. H50) during all oper-

ations in which the high bay serves as the secondary contalrment,

2.9 Tre ventilation system filters will be tested at least annually

ard after each change of filters.
1.9.1 The measured efficiency of the filters must be greater
thar 99.9% for C.5u and larger particles, as indicated

by the standard dicctylphthalate test.

1.1C All reactor and drain-tank-cell shileld blocks shall be in

i
nN

place and secured by the hold-down devices whenever fuel salt

is in the rsactor vessel.

iimit).

The power level for safety-rod scram trip is 15 Mw or less.

The temperature level for safety-rod scram trip is less than
1400°F. Adjustment of the trip between 1300 and 1400°F will

require administrative approval.
The maximum fuel system cover-gas pressure is 50 psig.
The maximum salt fill rate while filling the core is 1.0 £7 /min.

The maximum amount of £2°U which will be added at one time is
120 g. During operation fuel will only be added through the

sampler-enricher.

The maximum concentration of fissionable material in the fuel
salt will not exceed by more than 5% the minimum required for
full-power operation at 1200°F with equilibrium xenon and the
control rods poiscning 0.6% 8k/k. The fuel salt will be sampled

and the concentration measured at least once per week.

At no time during critical operation of the reactor will the re-
activity anomaly be allowed to exceed 0.5% 8k/k. A "reactivity
anomaly" is defined as a deviation from the reactivity which is
expected on the basis of measured reactor physics constants and

calculated effects of burnup and fission product accumulation.

A positive period of 1 sec or less will cause a safety-rod scram.

Coolant System

3.1

The maximum coolant system cover-gas pressure is 50 psig.

Control Rods

L.1

L.2

L.3

The normal complement of control rods 1s three, of which two

are required to scram for safety action.

The maximum scram time (time from initiation of signal until a

rod is on the seat) is 1.3 sec.
The rod speed (motor powered) is 0.5 # 0.05 in./sec. This
speed permits maximum reactivity additions in "start" of 0.1%

8k/k per sec and in "run" of 0.05% 8k/k per sec.

All nuclear safety instrumentation will be checked for proper

operation before each fill.

A minimum of two safety-level channels will be in service
during reactor operation.

A minimum of two reactor-fuel-outlet temperature signals will
he in service during reactor operation.

A minimum of one Tissicn chamber with count-rate circuit must
be in operation during startup filling operations.

A minimum of twc positive period safety channels will be in

service during reactor operation.

Personnel Radiation Monitoring

6.1

Radiation level monitors

A minimum of two personnel radiation monitors will be in
operation at all times, one in the high-bay area and one in

the control-room area.
Air monitors

A minimum of two alr activity monitors will be in operation at
all times, one in the high-bay area and one in the office—

control-room area.

Personnel and Procedures

7.1

Perscnznel qualiificaticrns

The reactor will be operated only by qualified personnel approved
by the Chief of Operations. It will be operated in conformancs
with documented operating procedures which, in nc instance,
designate authorizstion to cperate the reactor in excess of

any operating safety limits listed above.

Personnel and Procedures (continued)

7.2 The minimum staff requirement for operation during any shift is
that at least one supervisor and two technicians will be on duty
during reactor operation. The control room will not be left

unattended while fuel is in the reactor vessel.

Experimental Limits

Experiments will be conducted within the limits specified in this
report. Experimental procedures will be approved in advance by the
Head of the Operations Department, Oak Ridge National Iaboratory

Reactor Division, or his authorized assistant.
