TUBE PLUGGING IN THE MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR EXPERIMENT
PRIMARY HEAT EXCHANGER

R. G. Donnelly

ABSTRACT

In order to reduce the pressure drop through the shell
side of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment primary heat
exchanger, it was decided to remove four of the outer U-tubes.
This required sealing the eight tube stubs produced.

A plug design and seal welding procedure were developed
to assure a high-integrity seal between the molten fuel salt
on the shell side and the coolant salt on the tube side of
the heat exchanger. The plugs were made to have a slight
interference fit (0.0000 to 0.0002 in.) with the tubes and
were machined for edge-welding. The plug material was
INOR-8 as was the entire heat exchanger.

The procedure for making the seals was to manually weld
the tube end to the plug with a gas tungsten-arc torch. The
welding conditions were adjusted to provide weld metal pene-
tration equivalent to at least the thickness of the tube wall.

Visual, dye-penetrant, and radiographic examinations of
the welds gave every indication that high-integrity welds
had been made that would successfully isolate the fuel salt
from the coolant salt during the planned operation of the
heat exchanger.

 

INTRODUCTION

During preinstallation flow testing of the primary heat exchanger
for the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE), the pressure drop through
the shell side was found to be significantly greater than was desired
and required modification. The heat exchanger is of the conventional
U-tube design (See Fig. 1), with tubes being 0.50-in. OD X 0.042-in.
wall. All 326 tube ends are joined to a 17-in. diam X 1.50-in. thick
tube sheet by welding and back brazing.l

The containment material is the commercially available alloy, INOR-8

molten salts and good oxidation resistance. It also exhibits good general
weldability.? However, it has shown a tendency toward microfissuring under
certain welding conditions.4 Thus, the welding procedure and joint design
were more critical than usual.

The method approved for reducing the pressure drop was to remove the
four outer U-tubes which were situated directly at the mouth of ‘the shell-
side inlet and outlet nozzles. After removal of the shell, the four tubes
were cut, leaving eight stubs to be plugged. This was accomplished by
pressing in INOR-8 plugs and seal welding.

The development of procedures, qualification of the welder, and the
actual tube plugging operation are described.

DEVELOPMENTAL WORK

Joint Design

Due to the low-pressure differential (50 psi) between the tube and
shell sides of the heat exchanger, the plug was not required to have
great strength; however, a leak-tight joint was essential. Therefore,
with these facts in mind and taking into account the proximity of the
adjacent U-tubes, an edge-type weld preparation was made on the plugs
as shown in Fig. 2.

Each plug was positioned flush with the tube end. It was felt that a
qualified welder with a small gas tungsten-arc torch could more easily
make & high-quality weld on this type of joint than on any other. Since
the edge-type weld design also readily allows the tube end to be Joined
to a member of similar thickness, adequate Joint penetration is more
easily assured.

Both the square-edge design and beveled-edge design were investigated.
The thickness of the lip on the plug was also varied; the amounts being
1, 1 1/4, and 1 1/2 times the tube-wall thickness. In addition, joints
were welded by single-pass fusion, single pass with filler, and by a
combination of fusion and filler passes. In the end, no combination
proved better than the square-edge design with a lip thickness equal to
the tube-wall thickness welded in one fusion pass. However, & lip thick-
ness of 1 1/47 was ultimately chosen to assure a minimum of 1T weld
penetration in any section of the weld.

The plugs were tapered and machined for each individual tube to pro-
vide a slight interference fit (Fig. 3). An interference of 0.0005-in.
was found to cause difficulty in fitting in some cases, so a value of
TD o-1in, was chosen. With such a tight fit none of the 30 samples
examined metallographically exhibited any indication of root cracking.

Welding Procedures
With the joint and plug designs chosen, the welding parameters of

arc current, travel speed, and electrode orientation were varied in an
effort to determine the optimum combination. In addition, a copper chill
was fitted to the tubes at a distance of about 0.070 in. from the top of
the joint. It was felt that this would tend to even out the thermal
gradients between the tube and plug.

Welding current was varied from 30 to 45 amps, and time for one
revolution was varied from 40 to 77 sec. An overlap of 3/16 to 1/4-in..
was made at full amperage, and a foot-operated current tapering device
was used at the beginning and end of each weld to eliminate weld craters.
The conditions giving the best penetration and weld configuration were:

' Electrode material: W + 2% thoria
Electrode diameter: 1/16-1in.

The position of the electrode with respect to the joint was found
to have an effect on the configuration and, therefore, the effective
penetration of the weld. The best results were obtained by holding the
electrode tip on the outside edge of the tube. This required that the
welder touch the adjacent tubes with the electrically insulated parts of
the torch. A photomicrograph of a typical Joint welded under these con-

ditions is presented in Fig. 4.

WELDER QUALIFICATION

The welder was qualified on joints in a setup which simulated the
configuration of the actual heat exchanger. The mockup is shown in
Fig. 5. The welder had been previously qualified for gas tungsten-arc
welding of INOR-8 in accordance with ORNL Operator's Qualification Test
QTS-25.

The qualification welds were required to have the following: (1) uni-
form weld contour with no visual evidence of cracking or porosity, (2) no
positive dye-penetrant indications, (3) weld penetration of at least one
times the tube-wall thickness as evidenced by metallographic examination,
and (4) no porosity of a size greater than 10% of the tube-wall thickness
when radiographed in accordance with paragraph UW-51, Section 8, ASME
Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code. All requirements were met, and no

porosity of any size was revealed.

Prior to making the welds on the heat exchanger, the welder was also
required to make one or more sample welds for visual examination as re-

quired by the welding inspector.

THE TUBE PLUGGING OPERATION

The first item in the procedure was to remove the four outer U-tubes.
Heavy metal bars were clamped to the four tubes to act as guides for the
pneumatically operated abrasive wheel that was used for the cutting
operation. Metal plates were also used between the tubes being cut and
adjacent tubes to prevent any demage by the cutting wheel. The cuts
were made 1 1/8 in. from the barrier plate. This allowed sufficient room
for the chill block and also for repreparation of a tube end should this
be necessary

In addition to the four U-tubes, four adjacent baffle support rods
were also removed to provide access for the welding torch. These rods
were not replaced.

The resultant eight tube stubs were squared off, deburred, and
cleaned of all oxides for at least 1 in. from their ends. The inside
diameter of each tube end was then measured, and the maximum reading for
each recorded. The results are listed in Table 1 along with the plug
diameters for their respective tubes. It will be noted that the plug
for tube "E" was 0.0002 in. greater than the 0-002 in. range desired.
Nevertheless, the plug was fitted without difficulty.

Immediately before fitting a plug, both the tube and the plug were
degreased with acetone. The plug was then set into the tube stub with a
cleaned punch. A shoulder on the punch stopped the plug flush with the
tube end. After fitting the chill block, the welding sequence discussed
previously was followed and the joint visually inspected. The process
was repeated for each tube.

Visual examination revealed two welds that had areas of questionable
penetration. After demonstrating repair operations on sample welds, the
welder went over the two areas at full amperage to assure sufficient

penetration.

methods. No imperfections were revealed. A photograph of four of the

"CONCLUSIONS’
As a result of this work, it is felt that the tube plugging pro~
cedures and joint design developed are consistent with the operating

requirements of the heat exchanger.

The use of these procedures, coupled with a specially qualified
welder, has resulted in sound welded Joints which give every indication
of successfully sealing the ‘molten fuel salt from the coolant salt during
the planned operation of ‘the heat exchanger.
