FLUID DYNAMIC STUDIES
OF THE MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR EXPERIMENT (MSRE) CORE

R. J. Kedl

ABSTRACT

In the MSRE reactor vessel, fluid fuel is circulated at 1200 gpm
down through an annular region and up through 1140 passages in the
graphite core. The core design was based on preliminary tests in
a one-fifth scale model, followed by detailed measurements with
water solutions in a full-scale mockup of the reactor vessel and
internals. This report describes the models, the testing, and the
data from which velocity, pressure drop and flow patterns are deduced.
It also describes how the measurements were extrapolated to molten
salt at 1200°F in the actual reactor. The few observations possible

in the reactor were consistent with the predicted behavior.

- INTRODUCTION

The MSRE (Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment) is a 7.3 MW fluid-fueled,
graphite-moderated, single region nuclear reactor. The fuel consists of
uranium fluoride dissolved .in a mixture of lithium, beryllium and zir-
conium fluorides. A unique feature of this reactor concept is that the
power is generated in circulating fluid fuel rather than stationary solid
fuel elements. The nominal operating tempersture is 1200°F. A detailed
description of the reactor concept and its components is available in many
sources, for instance References 1, 2 and 3. A program was undertaken to
determine the fluid dynamic and heat transfer characteristics of the core.
This report presents the results of that effort. Most of the experimental

results presented here were obtained in the early 1960's. This report was not

CN
written, however, until after the MSRE‘nuclear operations were terminated

in December of 1969.

DESCRIPTION OF MSRE CORE AND TEST PROGRAM

Figure 1 shows an isometric view of the MSRE core. The fuel enters
the reactor vessel at 1200 gpm through a constant flow area volute near
the top of the cylindrical section. Because of the variable pressure
gradient in avolute of this type, orifices are used to obtain a uniform
angular flow distribution to the core wall cooling annulus. The fuel then
swirls down the core wall cooling annulus and into the reactor vessel lower
head. Radial vanes are placed in the lower head to destroy the swirl gen-
erated by the volute. The lower head then serves es a plenum to direct the
fuel uniformly to the moderator region. The moderator region is composed
of long grephite core blocks, square in cross section, and with grooves
cut longitudinally in the 4 faces. When these stringers are assembled
vertically together, the grooves form the fuel passages. Figure 2 shows

en isometric and a plen view of a small cluster or core. blocks. After

| passing through the moderator, the fuel then goes into the vessel upper.

head which serves as a collection plenum and directs. the fuel to the outlet
pipe. Each of these various regions of the core will be described in more

detail in the appropriate section of this report.

The MSRE core development program was divided into two phases. The | @
first phase consisted of building & 1/5 linearly scaled plastic model and
testing with water. This was considered to be a rough and preliminary
design checking device. The second phase consisted of building a full
scale carbon steel and aluminum model and testing with water. The only
date presented in this report will be from the full scale model, however,
a brief description of the 1/5 scale model and the way it was used is
given in the next section.

Early concepts of the MSRE called for a variable speed pump. It was
planned to operate the reactor at flow rates below the design flow of
1200 gpm. The lowest flow rate was undefined but could have been as low
as 25% of design flow. Later in the design stage, this reduced flow spec-
ification was dropped and design flow rate was fixed st 1200 gpm. This
change occurred during the testing of the full scale core model. As a
result, data were taken at flow rates ranging from 1200 apm to 300 gpm,
but the emphasis in this report is on the 1200 gpm data. Late in the
operating history of the MSRE, the fuel pump was connected to a variable
frequency unit, and the reactor was operated at reduced flow rates. The
purpose of these special runs was to study Xe-135 behavior. The "worst
case" as far as lateral temperature gradients in the core is concerned,
would be when it was operated at 5.5 MW (thermal) at half the design flow
rate for a period of about 3 1/2 days.

Figure 3 is a list of reactor parameters and physical properties of

interest in this study.

One-Fifth Scale Model

A small transparent plastic model of the MSRE core, linearly scaled
down by a factor of 1/5, was built and tested. The particular core com-
ponents simulated in this model were the inlet volute, flow distribution
orifices, core wall cooling annulus, lower vessel head with swirl killing
vanes, moderator support and the moderstor fuel channels which were simu-
lated with a tube bundle. A photograph of the model is shown in Figure I

The particular scale factor of 1/5 was chosen because a geometrically
similar model of that size tested with water st about 95°F, and at a flow
rate such that its fluid velocities are equal to those of the reactor, -

will have the same Reynolds Number as that in the actual reactor core when

Model

Since the model was so smell, not every surface and channel of the
reactor core exposed to salt was simulated. As a result, the model did not
give exact comparisons, and wes used only as a rough design checking device
to esteblish early in the program the acceptability of major core concepts.
For example, it was used for studies of the volute design and spacing of
flow distribution orifices, design of swirl killing vanes in lower head, and
preliminary measurements of solids settling characteristics of the lower
head.

Full Scale Model

‘The full scale MSRE core model is almost an exact duplicate of the
actual reactor. Figure 5 is a photograph of this model. The model is con-
structed of carbon steel with the exception of the core blocks and part

of the moderator support grid vhich are of sluminum. . The core blocks were

made by extruding aluminum approximately to shape including the longitudinal

grooves and then teking only a finish cut on the 4 side surfaces. Most of

"the tolerances of the reactor were increased (normally doubled) in the model

for economic reasons. In addition, other simplifications were made to

reduce the cost if they were. presumed to have a small effect on the fluid
dynamics. The vessel was ‘constructed with a large girth flenge just over
the volute so that the internals could be removed with relative ease.

Several transparent plastic windows were placed in the vessel heads, core

wall cooling annulus and volute for viewing. Numerous holes were drilled
into the vessel walls at various places for fluid measuring probes. A

carbon steel loop was built to operate this model and consisted of a pump,

surge tank and an ion-exchange system for removing salt injected during
fluid age measurements,

All the initial data from the full scale model was teken with the loop
filled with water and operated between T5°F and 80°F. This results in
a Reynolds Number for the model ebout four times that of the reactor. Later
in the program a thickening agent (Jaguar-508 by Stein, Hall & Co.) was
added to the system in order to simulate Reynolds Numbers, and the measure-
ments which were strong functions of the Reynolds Number, were repeated.
Although Jaguar-508 imparts non-Newtonian characteristic to the water, in
the low concentrations that were used in these tests, this was. a negligible
consideration. ‘As data is presented in this report, it will be noted
whether or not exact Reynolds Number similarity existed. Items to simulate
the three control rods and the surveillance specimen holder were not
included in the core model because their design was not sufficiently well
known when the model was built. Rather, the regular graphite matrix was

continued throughout this regions.

DESCRIPTION AND ANALYSIS OF TEST RESULTS
Volute and Core Wall Cooling Annulus

The mein fuel loop piping in the MSRE is 5 in. Schedule 40. Just prior
to entering the core vessel volute the pipe size is increased to 6 in. The
cross sectional flow arse of the 6 in. pipe is approximately equal to that
of the volute, 28.8 in.2 and 26. 0 in.2, respectively. The volute is a con-
stant flow area type and the teil end is hydraulically connected to the head
end so there is recirculation. One cheracteristic of this type of volute
is the variable static pressure around it; therefore, in order to obtain

a uniform angular flow distribution, it is necessary to use orifices between

* the volute end core wall cooling annulus. The orifices are 3/4 in. and occur

in stacks of 3. At the head end of the volute the orifice stacks are 5 deg

apart. At the tail end of the volute, because of the lower fuel velocity
and resulting higher static pressure, the orifice stack spacing is increased

to 22 1/2 deg. This orifice distribution was determined from the 1/5 scale

ad

model. The orifice holes are drilled at an angle of 30 deg with the tangent
in order to maintain a tangential velocity component in the annulus. The
resulting high heat transfer coefficients cool the core vessel wall and

the reactor core can,

Figure 6 is a plot of the experimentally measured centerline velocities
in the volute as a function of angular position and at various flow rates.
At 1200 gpm water approaches the core through the 5 in. pipe at a mean
velocity of 19.2 ft/sec. Immediately inside the volute the velocity Jumps
to about 23 ft/sec because of recirculation around the volute. At the
tail end of the volute the velocity is about 10 ft/sec. The centerline
velocities cannot be taken as absolute representations of flow rate, par-
ticularly at the inlet where two fluid streems of different velocities
merge. Nevertheless, the linear decrease in velocity is a good indication
that the water is distributed uniformly to the core wall cooling annulus.

At the head end of the volute the mean velocity through the orifices is
about U4 ft/sec and at the tail end of the volute the mean velocity through
the orifices is about 18 ft/sec. Figure 7 is a plot of the centerline
velocity in the core wall cooling annulus as a function of elevation.

Note that the velocity decreases as the water moves down the annulus,
because the tangential component is attenuated. Figure 8 is a plot of the
centerline velocity at the bottom of the core wall cooling annulus as &
function of angular position around the core. Note that it is quite flat,
indicating uniform flow to the reactor vessel lower heed. Data for Figures
6, T and 8 was taken with water in the loop. The Reynolds Numbers involved
in the volute and core wall cooling annulus are so high (over 10" in ell
cases at 1200 gpm) that exact Reynolds similarity is not importent, and
the reactor vessel containing fuel salt will have the same velocity pro-
files.

At this point it would be informative to compute the tempersture dif-
ference between the bulk salt in the core wall cooling annulus and the vessel
wall (Hastelloy N). At the midplane of the core (about 30 in. up in
the annulus) and at 1200 gpm, the fluid velocity in the annulus is T.2 ft/sec
(Figure 7). Now, molten salt behaves as a conventional Newtonian fluid so that
stendard heat transfer relationships may be used. From the Dittus-Boelter
equation and with physicel properties from Figure 3 we can compute a heat

only 2.47°F. It is beyond the scope of this report to include many detailed

1k

transfer coefficient at this position in the core wall cooling annulus OW
(1 in. thick) of 1370 Btu/hr-£t°-°F. The heat generation rate in the Z
vessel wall at this point has been estimated to be about 0.2 ——

The vessel wall is 9/16 in. thick so the heat flux to the salt, assuming -
the outside surface is insulated, will be 905 Btu/hr-ft°. The temperature

drop across the fluid boundary layer will be only 0.66°F. Now the tempera-

ture drop in the vessel wall with an internal heat source, and assuming

again that the outside surface is insulated, is represented by

2
= Qt
AT = 2k
where: t = wall thickness = 9/16 in.
Q = internal heat source = 0.2 w/emS
k = thermal conductivity - 11.71 Btu/hr-ft-°F

Evaluating gives a temperature drop in the metal wall of 1.81°F. Therefore
the overall temperature drop from the outside surface of the vessel wall

to the salt in the core wall cooling annulus is the sum of the above or

thermal analyses such as sbove. These analyses have been made and many are
reported in References 8 and 9. It was felt however that one such computation
would be worthwhile to give the reader an idea of the order of magnitude of
these effects. Because of its rather low power density, lateral temperature

gradients are quite low in the MSRE.

Reactor Vessel Lower Head

 

The lower plenum of the core vessel is formed by & standard 60 in. OD.
ASME flanged and dished head, containing enti-swirl venes and a drain line
configuration. The anti-swirl venes consist of 48 plates starting about
2 in. up in the core wall cooling annulus and extending along radial lines
into the lower head for about 38% of the radial distance to the core center-
line. They are slightly elevated off the core vessel wall, thus eliminating
es much corner area as possible where settled solids could accumulate. The
vessel drain consist of e short section of 1 1/2 in. pipe extending slightly
up into the vessel head at the centerline, and having a conical umbrella over
it. In addition it incorporates a secondary drain which is a 1/2 in. con- | <
centric tube coming up the middle of the primary drain, penetrating through
4)

QO

+

[x

15

the drain pipe wall just inside the vessel and wrapping around the drain
pipe horizontally sbout 90°. The conical umbrellas will prevent gross
settling of solid particles (should they exist) into the primary drain line,
however, fuel containing solids may still drift in and out of the umbrella
and over a long period of time, solids could still plug this drain. The

1/2 in. line serves as a safety drain since it is designed to prevent slow
migration of fuel in and out. Because of its size, it would drain the
reactor too slow under normel conditions. The secondary drain terminates
inside the primary drain just below the freeze valve.

The object of the anti-swirl vanes is to prevent the swirl generated
in the volute from penetrating into the lower head end creating an excessive
radial pressure gradient. The uniformity of fuel flow through the graphite
moderator region is a direct function of this pressure gradient. Figure 9
is a plot of the experimentally observed radial pressure gradient as
measured by wall pressure taps. Since the flow in the lower head is 3-
dimensional, the static pressure at the wall is not an absolute measure
of the pressure influencing flow through the moderator region, nevertheless
it is a good indication. Note that the pressure is slightly higher at the
center, therefore, one would expect a slightly higher flow through the moder-
ator near the center. This was measured to be the case as will be pointed
out in the section on the moderator.

As the water goes through the anti-swirl vanes and heads toward the
vessel centerline, it is turned by the lower head and produces a high velocity
Jet adjacent to the wall. Figure 10 is a profile of this jet measured at
e radius of 17 inches and at b positions 90° apart. The flow rate was
1200 gpm. Again, since the Reynolds Number is so high, the same jet will
exist with salt in the vessel. This jet does not persist much farther towards
the vessel centerline when the flow character becomes gusty but still remains
turbulent. From this velocity profile a heat transfer coefficient can be
estimated by assuming parallel plate geometry. The equivalent diameter
would be 4 times the distance from the wall to the peek velocity. The cal-
culation with the Dittus-Boelter equation yields a heat transfer coefficient

for fuel salt of 5L40 Btu/hr-ft°-C°F,

Heat transfer coefficients were also measured with a locally developed
"heat meter." Basically, it is an aluminum cube with a electric heater

on one surface and a thermocouple in its interior. The surface opposite

the heater is then exposed to the fluid stream and mounted flush with
the vessel surface. The heat meter is thermally insulated from the

vessel walls. It is illustrated and described in more detail in Ref. 10.

By measuring the electrical power input and the temperature difference ,

between the meter and the fluid, the heat transfer coefficient can be cal-
culated. The technique yields a heat transfer coefficient in a thermal
entrance region and it is necessary to convert them to the "far downstream"
case. This cen be done with correlations in References 4, 5 and 6. In
addition, the measured coefficients must be converted from water to salt
with the Dittus-Boelter equation. Heat transfer coefficients were measured
at a radius of 17 in. and I in. with water in the loop and were checked
with water thickened with Jaguar for Reynolds Number similarity and found
equal. The data, after being converted to the far downstream case and from
water to salt, are shown in Figure 11. Also shown on this plot is the heat
transfer coefficient as calculated from the wall jet. Note that the slope
of the curve indicates turbulent flow. More confidence is placed in the
data at 17 in. than at 4 in. because the flow is well defined at the

larger radius and less defined and gusty at the shorter radius. It is ex-
pected that the predicted values of these heat transfer coefficients are
conservative because they do not includethe effect of thermal convection
vhich is expected to contribute roughly 100 Btu/hr-ft>-°F to the overall
coefficient.

Consideration was given to the possibility of a source of nuclear
power oscillations in the MSRE core existing because of fuel short cir-
cuiting in the lower head. If a fraction of the fuel did short circuit,
then a corresponding amount of fuel must reside a little longer in the
head. This results in the short circuiting fraction entering the moderator
and little cooler than the mean and the short-circuited fraction entering
the moderator and a little hotter than the mean. Power oscillations result
because of the fuel temperature coefficient of reactivity. Tests were
conducted on the model by injecting a conductive saline solution at a
constant rate into the lower head at various locations and measuring the
oscillations in electrical conductivity at the vessel outlet. These measure-
ments indicate that the power oscillations originating from this mechanism
should be well below 0.01% of the mean power.

Graphite Moderator Assembly

 

In flowing through the reactor moderator assembly, fuel first passes
through a moderator support structure and then through the moderator core
blocks. The support structure consists of two assemblies, the lower of
which is a Hastelloy-N cross structure (Figure 1) which is the main support
structure for the graphite. Resting on this is a grid consisting of two
layers of rectangular grephite bars, one layer resting on the other and
perpendicular to it. The purpose of the graphite assembly is to position
and hold the graphite core blocks, and to compensate for a difference in
thermal expansion between the Hastelloy N and graphite. The resulting
square passages in the graphite grid are small =and the fuel velocity is
high (approx. 4 1/2 ft/sec), and therefore its pressure drop is high.
Comparatively, the salt velocity through the bulk moderator fuel chennels
is low (approx. 0.7 ft/sec) and its pressure drop is low.
Figure 12 shows the experimentally determined head loss scross the moder-
ator assembly as measured in the model. A small correction has been applied
to this data to account for small holes drilled through the support grid
of the MSRE, as will be discussed later in this section. Also shown in
; this figure is the head loss across the support grid as measured in a
| separate model made for this purpose. The difference between these curves is
the head loss in the moderator channels themselves including entrance and
exit losses. For these tests, the loop was filled with water. Note that
the slope of the curves in Figure 12 is 2.0 as would be expected since
the Reynolds Number with water is over L000 in the fuel channels and the
bulk of the head loss is due to form losses in the graphite grid. With

| fuel salt the bulk of the head loss would still be from form losses. The

| Reynolds Number in the fuel channels would be approximately 1000 so the

| flow character would theoretically be laminar, however, much of the tur-

bulence generated by fuel passing through the tortuous inlet configuration

 

would persist through the fuel channels. -As a result one might expect a
very slightly lower slope to the curves in Figure 12 with fuel salt in the
system.

As pointed out, the bulk of the pressure drop through the moderator
assembly is due to the graphite grid. There is also very little room for

cross flow in the space between the graphite grid and the entrance to the

fuel channels. Therefore the uniformity of flow distribution across /

©

the moderator assembly is controlled to a large extent by the uniformity
of flow through the orifices in the graphite grid. The flow distribution
among the core fuel channels was experimentally measured by two different
techniques. The most successful technique was to simply inject a small
amount of electrically conductive salt solution into the water flowing in
a fuel channel and measure the time required to pass two conductivity
probes a given distance apart. The device used consisted of a length of
1/k in. tubing blanked off on the end, and a small hole drilled into the
side where the salt solution was injected. The tubing was inserted down
into a fuel channel about 6 in. from the top. Access to the fuel channels
was available through the viewing ports in the upper head of the vessel.
The assembly was made to readily slip into and out of the fuel channels,
and was small enough in cross section so that its presence would not sig-

nificantly change the flow rate. The conductivity probes were sbout 3 in.

apart and about 2 in. up from the injection hole. The device was calibrated
in a special test fixture. The flow rate was measured in TT more or less
randomly chosen passages end the data appear in Figure 13 as a function of the -
core radius. Note first that 2 separate regions are present which represents

channels that are mutually perpendicular to each other. These regions are
characterized by different inlet configurations because of their position

over the graphite grid. A plan view of the graphite grid with the position

of the fuel channels superimposed is included in the figure. A separate

plastic model was built of a few ‘adjacent fuel channels with the graphite

grid simulated to investigate methods of correcting this problem. Based

on these tests, it was determined that 0.104 in. holes (no. 37 drill)

drilled through the upper graphite grid bar and directly under the starved

channel would equilibrate the flows. A typical location of one of these

holes is shown in Figure 13. Note also from this figure that the flow rate

- decreases slightly with increasing radius. This was expected and is due

to the radial pressure gradient in the lower head as discussed earlier

Nn

(see Figure 9). Actually this flow distribution is beneficial because
the flow rate is highest where the power density is highest, resulting
in a better thermal utilization of the fuel. In a large power producing : J

reactor, for instance, one would strive to match the flow distribution

‘with the power distribution so that the fuel outlet temperature across

the core would be. approximately equal. Lastly note from Figure 13, the
rather large scatter of data points around the least square lines. This

is a result of inherent inaccuracies in the flow instrument and also

because of tolerances in the orifices formed by the graphite grid. Recall
that the flow distribution through the moderator is controlled by these
orifices because their pressure drop is high and cross flow above them to
level out possible pertubations is low. The tolerances in making the

model were normally double those of the reactor, so that a greater variation
in orifice width was expected. The nominal orifice width is 0.375 in. In
the model we measured these orifice widths with go nogo gages as high

as 0.400 in. and as low as 0.350 in. Estimates indicate that this variation
is enough to account for a large fraction of the scatter in Figure 13.

It was therefore concluded that the large scatter in flow distribution ex-
perienced in the model will not be present in the reactor.

The second technique used to measure flow rates through the moderator
channels was to install pressure taps in the aluminum core blocks and
measure the pressure drop. Pressure taps were installed on 2 sides of 9
core blocks yielding information on 18 fuel channels. The core blocks were
calibrated before installation in the model. Data from this technique
was consistent with date obtained from the salt injection technique, although
with more scatter. The data points at the extreme radius of the moderator
are shown as squares in Figure 13. They represent the flow rate between
the graphite moderator and reactor core can. The units are given as gpm which
is misleading, because the hydreulic parameters (e.g., cross sectional flow

' area) in this flow region are not accurately known. To be specific this is
the flow rate corresponding to the measured pressure drop in a standard
fuel channel. The significant observation is that these data points fall
more or less on an extension of the least squares line.

In the MSRE and in the model, the regular pattern of the graphite
support grid is discontinued near the centerline of the core where the
control rods and the surveillance speciment holder are located. This allows
greater salt velocities past these components for cooling. As noted
previously however, the control rods and specimen holder were not simulated

in the model. Instead, the regular pattern of core blocks was continued

N

C.

throughout this region. In the model, about 16 regular fuel channels were’

directly affected end a few more were indirectly affected by the discon-

tinued support grid. The average flow rate measured through these channels

by the conductivity probe technique was 2.3 gpm. Two values measured in

this region by the calibrated fuel channel technique were 3.6 and 3.7 gpm.

Fluid velocities in units of ft/sec would be about the same if control
rods and the surveillance specimen holder were present. This is more than
adequate for cooling so no attempt was made to resolve the difference in flow
rate measured by the two different techniques.

- A suggested scheme for core power oscillations is due to changes in
the character of flow in the centermost 16 fuel channels. The Reynolds
Number of these channels is in the order of 3000 and is therefore in the
transitional region. It was speculated that the character of flow could
oscillate from laminar to turbulent between parallel channels. To test
this hypothesis, a flow visualization study was made using an optically
birefringent solution of Milling Yellow dye in water. An almost full
scale model of 4 parallel fuel channels with inlet conditions similar
to the reactor was built from transparent plastics. With two mutually
perpendicular polarized plates, we were able to observe clearly the
trensition between laminar and turbulent flow. The transition was smooth
and continuous, and no oscillatory action could be detected either in a
single channel or between channels that could be regarded as significant.

Many detailed temperature distribution calculations have been made
for the MSRE core based on the results presented in this report. Results

of these analyses are presented in Refs. 8 end 9 and will not be presented

‘here.

 

Reactor Vessel Upper Head

The reactor vessel upper plenum is similar to the lower plenum in

~ that it is formed from a standard ASME flenged end dished head. The fuel
enters the upper head uniformly across the diameter from the moderator fuel

channels. The fuel then moves radially to the center and leaves the core

through a 10 in. outlet pipe. The model showed no tendency of the water to
vortex into the outlet pipe. After the model was built, a strainer structure
(Figure 1) was added to the reactor outlet design which penetrated down

into the upper plenum. Its purpose was to catch graphite chips (graphite
floats in fuel salt) should they bresk loose from the moderator. This
 

2 6

device was not instelled in the model but it would not be expected to
influence the flow significantly.

Velocity profiles in the model were ‘determined in the upper head by a
fluid age technique. Electrically conductive salt solutions were injected
as a step function at the core inlet. Conductivity probes were placed sat
selected locations in the upper head presumebly along the fluid streamlines.
By measuring the time required for these conductive pulses to pass between
the probes, the average velocity between the probes can be calculated.
There are, of course, inaccuracies in the calculation because they assume
knowledge of the streamlines and they neglect lateral mixing between
streamlines. Velocity profiles estimated by this technique appear in
Figure 14. Plotted is the average velocity between the probes indicated
(see sketch) as a function of distance from the vessel wall, assuming that
the streamlines were parallel to the wall. At the rated flow rate
(1200 gpm), the Reynolds Number in the upper head is high for both water
and fuel salt and the flow is turbulent. Heat transfer coefficients
to the vessel walls can therefore be estimated with Dittus-Boelter type
equations. Assuming parallel plate geometry where the equivalent diameter
is twice the channel width, the estimated hegt transfer coefficient is a
little over 100 Btu/hr-ft2-°F neglecting thermal convection. This wvelue
has been generally confirmed with heat meter measurements taken at approxi-
mately the same location. The calculation is assumed conservative because
the entire upper head would be a thermal entrance region (low length/diameter
ratio). The region near the knee of the upper head will have a lower heat
transfer coefficient but the heat generation in the MSRE vessel wall in
this region is very low. In addition, some small channels have been milled
in the MSRE core support flange to allow a small flow of cool fuel to short
circuit directly from the core wall cooling annulus to this region of the
upper head. The flow rate in this circuit has been estimated to be between
25 and 50 gpm depending on certain manufacturing and essembly tolerances.

Estimated temperatures in this region are presented in Reference 9.
Miscellaneous Measurements

The overall head loss through the core vessel from the 5 in. inlet
line to the 5 in. outlet line was measured and is shown in Figure 15. The
curve has & slope of 2.0 indicating that the head loss is primarily due to.

form drag as expected, and very little due to skin friction.

Experiments were conducted to obtain information on the behavior

of heavy solid perticles. in the fuel salt. The question arose because

if sufficient oxygen or water vapor come in contact with fuel salt, zir-

conium oxide would precipitate. A considerable effort was made in the MSRE
to prevent this, and indeed it never did happen. Nevertheless, during

the design stage it was desirable to know the disposition of heavy solid
particles should they occur. One of the most likely places for particles
to settle out is in the lower head of the reactor. This is also one of
the more critical areas because they could potentially develop into a
significant heat source on the primary containment surface. There was

also concern that if enough particles developed, they may plug up the drain
line configuration. -

The experiments consisted of adding 2 or 3 pounds of sized iron
filings to the water at the core inlet while the pump was running. They
were added slowly over a specified period of time, generally about
20 minutes. The pump was then turned off either immediately after the
addition or left running for an additional period up to 8 hours. After the
pump was turned off, the loop was drained and the quantity of solids that re-
mained in the reactor vessel lower head was determined. The solids passed
through the core only once because downstream of the core model was the
5400 gallon surge tank in which the particles would most certainly settle
out. All date were taken at 1200 gpm, mostly with water but some runs
with thickening agent added for Reynolds Number simulation. A summary

of the data is shown in Figure 16. A particle diameter of 200-300 microns

seems to be critical, that is, particles larger than this settled out in

“significant quantities, and particles smaller than this passed through the

system, The gusty nature of the flow around the drain line assembly also
seems to have some ability to re-suspend particles less than 300 microns
in size if the pump is kept running after the addition phase. The solids
that did deposit in the lower head had the appearance of an annular ring.

tube was examined and no particles were found in it. After all the runs

were completed, the top head was removed from the vessel and it was
found that a large amount of filings had settled fairly uniformly on
the top of the core blocks. They had rusted together, otherwise, a
large fraction of them may have fallen back down into the fuel channels
when the pump was stopped. Note that the top of the core blocks is in
the shape of a pyramid (Figure 2). Calculations have been made for the
MSRE to determine the effect of precipitated fuel particles on the con-
tainment wall temperature near the drain pipe. They are not serious and
some of the results are reported in Reference 9.

Experiments were performed to determine the behavior of gas bubbles
in the core. Bubbles between 1/8 and 1/4 in. were injected into the core
inlet. At 1200 gpm virtually all the bubbles went down the core wall
cooling annulus and essentially none short circuited through the slots in
the core support flange to the upper head. In contrast to this, at about
350 gpm, all the bubbles went through the core support flange slots and
none went down the core wall cooling annulus. The bubbles injected at ‘this
lower flow rate were considerably larger, however, than at the higher flow
rate. At 1200 gpm, no pockets could be noted anywhere in the core vessel
where bubbles tended to accumulate. In the MSRE, bubbles in the fuel loop
that have been generated by the xenon stripper spray ring are estimated
to be in the order of 0.010 in, Certainly they will travel with the salt
at 1200 gpm and not accumulate in pockets or short circuit through the

core support flange.

EXPERIENCE WITH THE MSRE

A brief summary of the MSRE operating history is as follows:
© First criticality - June 1, 1965
Nuclear operation terminated - Dec, 12, 1969
Time reactor was critical - 17,655 hours
Nuclear heat production - 13,172 equivalent full power hours
‘Selt circulating in fuel loop - 21,788 hours.

There were no direct fluid measuring probes of any kind (velocity,
pressure drop, etc.) installed in the MSRE core. Even the flow rate was
an inferred quantity from measured AT's in the fuel and coolant loop and the
coolant salt flow rate from a venturi. The only instrumentation that could
yield fluid dynamic performence information in the core was 64 thermocouples
spotted at various locations on the outside of the core vessel (not in
wells). These thermocouples yielded no indications of any adverse conditions
inside the core. Another rather indirect source of information would be by
the reactivity balance, which was kept in detail for this reactor because
of its experimental nature. Again, no effects were noted that could be
attributed to fluid dynamics in the core. The conclusion then is that,
based on lack of evidence to the contrary, the MSRE core did behave as
was expected from testing the model. It should be noted however, that
because of the conservative design of the core, a rather large malfunction

would have been necessary in order to see it with available instrumentation.
