MSRE MAINTENANCE PROPOSAL

E. C. Hise

ABSTRACT

It is proposed that the MSRE primary circuit, cell, and shielding and
containment be so designed as to be adaptable to semi-direct maintenance
for certain suitable operations.

The requirements for and features of semi-direct maintenance are
given. A tentative procedure for replacement of the special graphite bars
by semi-direct means is given.

It is proposed that a semi-direct maintenance system be incorporated
in the MSRE design as a parallel to the remote system. The dual method
would provide the operator a- choice of system to be used depending upon
the magnitude and type of .work to be performed and would provide the safety .
factor of a’ “spare.

‘Many small operations, such as visual inspections, retightening bolts,
replacing heaters, checking auxiliary system leaks, and changing over to
spare auxiliary connections of various kinds are well suited to the semi-
direct system. Several major operations, such-as the removal and replace-
ment of the pump motor, the pump rotary element, and the special core graphite
bars, appear to be amenable to semi-direct work, Other major operations,
such as the removal and replacement of the heat exchanger and core vessel,
would perhaps be best done by a combination of the methods whereby the dis-
connections will be done and the component prepared for lifting by semi -
direct means and the operation completed by remote means.

The general design requirements to enable semi ~direct maintenance are:

A modular seal membrane (Fig. 2) which could be removed either as a
unit or in modules. :

 

A modular lower shield (Fig 2) which could be removed -either as beams
or in modules. a

Arrangement of the modular shield with repent to reactor ‘components
to provide maximum accessibility.

 

Arrangement of auxiliary piping and wiring in a few cases to permit lateral
movement of a component in. a specific direction within the cell.

The additional equipment required would be:

A portable work shield (Fig. Lb) consisting of horizontal steel or lead
slides roller mounted on tracks and motor driven for remote opening and
closing. -The slides would have vertical holes for windows, .viewing devices,
lights, and tools. The holes would be filled with plugs when not in use.
It would cover the opening left by the removal of one lower shield module.

 

One or several small shield windows to fit the holes.

A suitable periscope

 

Simple tools such as long handled wrenches and hooks. Many of these would
be fabricated as needed.

A generalized but entirely feasible procedure for the removal and replace-
ment of the special graphite bars is presented to illustrate the semi-direct
system. All operations described are with personnel in Zone II and on the
cell shield except where marked.with an *.

1. Remove the upper shield beams (probably two ) necessary to uncover the
appropriate seal membrane module.
 

 

 

ye
2. Cut the seal weld and remove the membrane module.

 

3. Place the portable shield assembly over the modular shield plug
to be removed. Open the slides so as to clear the plug. Attach the crane
to the plug. . oo :

 

xl, ‘Raise the shield plug and close. the slides.

 

5. Install windows and lights in the portable shield.

6. Insert the appropriate tools and, with direct vision through the
windows or periscope if necessary, disconnect the pump power and instrument
leads and the service piping. Remove the rotary element hold down bolts.
‘Withdraw the tools. These can be pulled into plastic bags if necessary.

Te Center the crane with special hook fixture over the motor lift bail.

 

: *8. Open the portable shield slides, lower the hook fixture through the
shield; and close: the slides.

9. By direct observation, attach the crane to the lift bail. ‘Raise
the rotary element approximately 2 1/2 ft to clear. the fixed pump ‘housing.
The rotary element will still be well below the. bottom of the portable
shield.

 

10. Using the movable slide, crane, and direct vision, transport the
‘rotary element to a preplaced hook within the. cell, ‘hang up the rotary
element, and “disengage the crane hook... oo

*11. open the slides, remove the hook, and close the slides.

12. Place a shielded carrier with open “top and bottom — the portable
shield over the pump bowl. Insert the graphite removal tool through the carrier
and latch it onto a graphite bar. Withdraw the bar into the carrier and
close the bottom door. = Unlatch the tool, withdraw it from the carrier, and
park it in the.cell. Close the top door of the carrier, withdraw the carrier
into a plastic bag, and withdraw the shielded and contained bar from the cell.
Repeat for each bar to ‘be removed. Alternatively, it may be more desirable
to have one carrier: accommodate all five graphite bars.

 

13. At this ‘time, if it is desirable, viewing devices can be placed in
the core vessel and the upper and lower plenums, ete. -examined.

14. Attach each - ‘replacement bar in turn to the insertion tool and place
in. reactor. :

15.. Reassemble the reactor and shield with the reverse of steps 1-11
above. LL Co

A recapitulation of the features of the semi-direct system follows:
1. Access to the primary system for a specific operation requires the

removal of “two upper shield beams, one membrane module, and one lower
shield module, and the placement. of the portable shield.

2. The required air flow is that to maintain a down draft through the
small openings in and around the portable shield and thereby prevent airborn
contamination.

3. Direct vision or optical aids may be used at all times.

+4. Multiple "hands" may be used simultaneously.

5. "Feel" is retained by the operator.

6. Access to Zone IT 1s assured (during almost all of ‘the operation.

7. Maintenance equipment failure is easily remedied. with the possible
exception of the coincidental failure of the crane while transporting an
unshielded, radioactive item in Zone II which is a difficult problem regardless
of method. : :

8. Special or replacement tooling can usually be fabricated quickly

since much of it will be standard wrenches or hand tools with long handles
attached. :

9. Proper control of air flow and of all items removed from the cell
will prevent: conteminption of Zone II. :

10. Clean up after an operation requires the replacement of the lower

‘shield module, removal of the portable shield, rewelding the membrane

module, and replacing the upper beams.

Figure 1 shows the upper shield in 3 1/2 ft wide beams. -The division
of the upper shield into beams of approximately this width is dictated by
the capacity of the building crane. The reinforcement and fastening of these

‘beams would be the same as in the presently contemplated design.

Figure 2 shows vie ToGales for. both the SeAl TeEBIAe and the lower
shield. In the case of the seal membrane,the circumferential weld can be
cut permitting the membrane to be removed as a unit or the peripheral weld
of any 3 1/2 ft x 5 ft module can be cut and the module removed.

In the case of the lower shield each 3 1/2 ft wide beam may be removed
as a unit or any of. the 3 1/2 ft x 5 ft modules may be removed individually.

Figure 3 shows how. the seal membrane modules are welded together and
how clearance for the seal weld lip is provided in the upper shield beams.

‘The steel structure that supports and ties together the lower shield
modules into a beam is shown.

Figure b is borrowed but illustrates the principle of a portable
shield having movable slides and access holes.
