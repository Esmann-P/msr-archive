ABSTRACT

One of the major problems in the economic evaluation of the application
of forced circulation, gas cooling to high temperature, molten salt power
reactor systems is the definition of the required heat transfer equipment,
its size and operating cost. A design study of the. salt- ~£0-gas8 heat ex-
changers for such a gas-cooled system has recently been completed, and the
results are. reported. |

Helium, hydrogen and steam are considered as coolants. The effects of 1
varying heat ‘exchanger tubing size, coolant inlet temperature, coolant pres- +
sure level, allowable salt pressure .drop and uranium enrichment of the molten

 

salt are demonstrated.

The relationship between heat exchanger dimensions, fuel inventory and
blower power requirements is presented in graphical form for the most
pertinent cases. Comparisons are made of annual operating costs and heat
exchanger overall size as a function of coolant type and operating conditions.

Hydrogen is ishown to be the most effective of the coolants considered,
with steam and helium being roughly comparable. Assuming other conditions
to be equal, helium can be made competitive with hydrogen by operating with
a 50 - 60% higher helium temperature gradient through the heat exchanger.
Optimum heat exchanger geometries based on gas blower power costs and en-
riched fuel inventory charges require a ‘total blower power investment of
approximately 0.5% of the plant gross electrical output. However, substantial
reductions in heat exchanger size can be realized by going to higher blower

power investment levels.

Introduction
Since the early phases of design evaluation on a molten salt power reactor

system, it has been desired to investigate the problems associated with the use
of gas as the primary coolant. As a step in this direction, a design study has
been carried out to define the salt-to-gas primary heat exchanger which would
be required in such a system. The study concerns a reactor having a thermal
output of 640 megawatts (10% generated in blanket and removed through blanket
cooling system) and a gross electrical output of 275 megawatts. Consideration
has been given to the use of helium, hydrogen and steam as coolants. The re-
ference design was based on the following:
4 primary heat exchangers

1/2" Inconel tubing (0.050" wall)

Circumferential Inconel fins

Helium coolant - 623 1b/sec

Inlet 850°F
Outlet 1025°F

Molten Salt (Fuel 130) 1768 1b/sec
Inlet 1210°F
Outlet 1075°F

~ Four pass serpentine flow
In addition to determining] “the relative effectiveness of the three coolants,
the effects of varying “tube size, “coolant inlet temperature, coolant pressure

Summary
A design study Has been: ‘completed. covering the application of gas as the
primary coolant in. a molten, salt power reactor system, The use of helium,
“hydrogen and steam was investigated: along with the effect of gas Pressure
level, cas inlet temperature: level and tubing size’
The basic heat: exchanger: geometry studied was a Cross, countercurrent
flow arrangement with; the. molten salt (Mixture 130 - 62 mol 4 LiF, 37 mol %
BeF,,, 1 mol % UF) making four -serpentine passesiacross the gas stream (see
Fig. 2). One-half inch Inconel: tubing with; circumferential Inconel fins was
used in all the final heat: exchanger- calculations. Consideration was given
in the initial phase of the: study to other tube sizes, and the standard size
chosen is felt to approach ‘the. optimum, |
Heat exchanger optimization-has been based on: three criteria: first,
fuel inventory in heat: exchanger. tubes, return: bends and headers; second, gas
blower power requirements; and third, minimum heat Soman container: di--
mensions. Fuel inventory was: evaluated at $1335/ 2° /year and: electrical power
at 9 mills/kwh,
Results of the study (Figs. 12.and 14) have shown that, at a given heat
exchanger gas inlet temperature with the. outlet! temperature fixed, the use:
of hydrogen results in a smaller unit with a lower fuel inventory and power
requirement than either helium or;steam., However, the hazards of large scale
hydrogen usage must:be balanced against these obvious advantages. The optimum
helium and. steam heat exchanger are approximately the same in dollars invested
in fuel and power but differ geometrically in that the steam unit is larger in
diameter and shorter in length. Since a grea ater premium is attached to diameter
in the construction of ‘the required heat exchanger containment pressure vessel,
the steam unit is judged slightly inferior to. the helium unit dimensionally.
However, there are important incentives for the use of ‘stean cooling. The
criginal cost of the steam inventory is negligible and the: ‘containment problen
becomes of minor importance. In addition, standard and well developed auxiliary
components can be used throughout a steam system. On this basis, it is con-
cluded that the application of steam to the gas cooling cycle would have eco-
nomic advantages over helium.
Changing the coolant pressure level for a given heat exchanger configuration
and heat load affects the coolant umping power ‘approximately as the inverse

square of the pressure ratio (i.e., doubling pressure reduces pumping power to
one-fourth). Changing the coolant pressure level while maintaining a reason- .
ably constant blover power input affects primarily the required face area of
the heat exchanger with consequent changes in container size.

Increasing the allowable salt side pressure drop increases the heat ex-
changer container diameter while reducing its length. Optimization of this
variable was not undertaken in the present design study.

‘Decreasing salt enrichment by a factor of five results in a reduction
of yearly heat exchanger costs by factors of 2.5-4 in the cases of primary
interest. |

The results of a companion study on longitudinal, countercurrent flow
of coolant over circumferentially finned straight tubing showed this arrange-
ment to be somewhat less attractive than the comparable crossflow case. Although
the heat exchanger container diameters were approximately the same, the re-
quired container lengths were 30 ~ Lot greater. The use of such a straight
tube geometry leads to thermal stress problems associated with discrete tube

plugging or flow variations from tube to tube.

 

 
Design Considerations

 

{ 1. Heat Exchanger Configuration
| "7 Two general heat exchanger configurations illustrated in Figures 1 }
and 2 vere given detailed consideration. The first, which was ultimately
rejected as the least desirable of the two, was basically an annular
tubing arrangement with the salt flow straight through and the helium
in cross-countercurrent flow around aise and donut baffles. The en-
nular geometry imposed no restriction on the number of helium passes
across the tube bundle since the helium could be introduced and col-
lected with equal ease both to or from the center of the tube bundle
and to or from the outside of the bundle, Based on correlations pre-

sented in Reference 1, a three-pass arrangement was chosen as giving a

 

1 TEE satisfactory approach to pure countercurrent heat transfer (i.e., es-
sentially no correction factor to be applied to the log mean temperature

difference based on the hot and cold stream inlet and outlet temperature

 

under consideration). At the same time, as will be shown later, keeping
1 the number of passes to a minimum results in the most compact heat ex-

: changer geometry.

: One disadvantage of this arrangement is that, since straight tubes
are used running from the salt inlet to the salt outlet header, plugging
of one tube could lead to a serious differential thermal expansion

condition. To a lesser extent, flow disparities between separate

 

tubes could cause thermal stresses to be imposed on the tubing and
flow fluctuations in individual tubes could lead to strain cycling of
tubing material, Since this condition could be relieved somewhat by

a simple geometrical arrangement such as a right angle bend in the tubing

 

at or near either the upper or lower header, it cannot be considered as

| a major stumbling block to the use of this geometry. The primary obstacle
appeared during the course of the study. Optimum heat exchanger geometries
from a fuel inventory and overall size standpoint proved to have internal
diameters which resulted in high gas velocities as shown in Fig. 3. The
head losses associated with changes in coolant flow direction and ve-
locity in this geometry are hard to evaluate precisely, but it was es-
timated that 2 - 3 velocity heads would be lost per pass. Since these

losses approach in magnitude the losses associated with flow across the

heat tr rensfer surfaces, they were felt to be prohibitive, The annular

To

bundle was therefore rejected as a suitable geometry.
The second heat exchanger geometry considered was a more conventional
arrangement having serpentine salt tubes with the gas flowing straight

through the heat transfer matrix. In this case, it was considered neces-

 

sary to provide a four pass arrangement to provide complete freedom for
differential thermal expansion in the tubing while avoiding the float-
ing header which would be required if only three passes are used. In | i
addition, the four pass arrangement allows the salt inlet and outlet to
be located close together, an arrangement which stands the best chance
of reducing the amount of piping required to connect the heat ; exchanger
' &nd the reactor.

 

 

All final optimization studies were done: on the basis of the serpen-
tine salt tube arrangement. :

A study was also made of the required heat exchanger geometry and
operating costs for the case of countercurrent flow of helium over cir-
cumferentially finned tubing. The finned tubing geometry was not optimized
so the results may not represent the best that can be done with this heat
exchanger type. However, they are satisfactory as a rough tie-in with the

remainder of the study.

2. Finned Tubing
Several design restrictions imposed at the time the heat exchanger

study was undertaken made it desirable to select a finned tubing for con-

 

sideration that was less than the optimum from a heet transfer standpoint.
Inconel tubing was chosen since data on the thermal conductivity of INOR-8,
a more likely material of fabrication, are currently uncertain. Homogeneous

fins fabricated of Inconel were chosen to avoid completely any question of

Lo}

materials incompatability in view of the extended lifetime required of a
power reactor heat exchanger. The use of nickel fins would definitely re- -
sult in 8 more compact heat exchanger. Copper core fins would give an im-

provement over nickel but would introduce. the requirement for’ ‘brazing the

 

fins to the tubing in order to protect the copper against the’ ‘possibility

of attack by the coolant or by impurities ‘therein, At the present time,

 

the introduction of the. brazing requirement is considered to be undesirable -

primarily from a materials compatability standpoint, On the basis of
information received from the Griscom-Russell Corporation’) a bond
efficiency of 100% was assigned to the mechanical bond between the
Inconel fins and tubes.

The use of longitudinally finned tubing with the coolant in pure
countercurrent flow was not investigated, since literature references? »3)
indicate a continuous longitudinal fin to have poor heat transfer
characteristics. The use of a split longitudinal fin or pin fins might
result in a competitive heat exchanger; however, these choices were not
investigated since it was felt that simple mechanical ‘bonding of such
fins to the tubing could not be guaranteed to give the required degree
Of structural reliability. |

perimentally evaluated by Kays and rongon(*) | The tubing dimensions

Tubing Size

The majority of the design study was-based on 1/2 inch tubing with
& .050 inch wall thickness .. Figure 4 presents the pertinent information
leading to the choice of this tubing size. |

It can be demonstrated that the optimum salt inventory for a given
set of design conditions occurs when the unit is sized so that the salt ’
pressure drop through the heat exchanger is at the maximum allowable
value. This maximum is 36 psi, since 10% of the available 40 psi which

has been customarily assigned to the heat exchanger has been utilized

by entrance and exit effects.

Furthermore, based on the assumption. that the amount of power to
be utilized in coolant circulation would be between 0.5 and 10% of “the.
plant gross electrical output as extremes, it is possible to define
the range of tube lengths and number of tubes which meet design re-
quirements for a given tube size.

On this basis; the lines representing the length vs number of tubes
at maximum salt pressure drop for 3/4 inch, 1/2 inch and 3/8 inch tubing
with 0.050 inch wall were established. The location of the lines re-
presenting blower power investments of 0.5% and 10% of the plant gross
electrical output demonstrate that there is a fairly narrow range of
length-number of tubes combinations which will satisfy the design re-
quirements.

Three-fourths inch tubing was judged to be-undesirable because of
the excessive length requirement, although the number of tubes required
for the heat exchanger was very attractive, Three-eighths inch tubing
was judged somewhat unsatisfactory for the opposite reason. Although
the tube length was satisfactory, the number of tubes required was
judged excessive. One-half inch tubing seemed to represent a reasonable
approach to optimum, although 7/16 inch tubing might be presumed equally
satisfactory. |

It should be pointed out that increasing the wall thickness of ‘the
heat exchanger tubing from 0,050 to 0.060 - 0.065 inch would have a
negligible effect on the calculations. The total resistance of the metal
wall to heat transfer normally approximated 10% of the overall resistance.

factor of 80% was assignes to the power plant. Enriched fuel was assigned
a yearly cost of $1535/£t° based on the following factors:

In calculating coolant gas pressure drop across the tube bundle,
the head loss due to flow acceleration caused by temperature and pressure
change was neglected. Due to the low pressure drop and coolant tempera-
ture rise; the error resulting from this assumption is well within the

limits of error of the overall calculation,

a basic plot of blower power investment versus the number of tubes.
The active length of each heal exchanger tube is the product of the
baffle spacing times the number of passes. All heat exchangers falling
along a line of constant tube bank "depth" between the number of tubes
at which the fuel Reynolds Number is 3000 (3500 tubes) and the number
of tubes at which the fuel pressure drop is 36 psi are satisfactory
for the transfer of 143.5 megawatts from the salt to the coolant under
the conditions specified. However, those units represented by the
intersection of a line of constant tube bank "depth" with the line of
maximum fuel pressure drop represent the optimum heat exchangers from
a fuel inventory standpoint.

Since tube bank "depth" is given in number of tube rows, the value
fast be an integer, normally in the range of two to fifteen. Study of
the figures will make clear that for a given blower power investment
there is one "best" heat exchanger geometry. As blower power is ine
creased; the required number of tubes decreases until the optimum
geometry for that tube bank "depth" is reached at the intersection
with the maximum salt pressure drop line, If this point is inside the
horizontal projection of the line representing the next higher tube bank
"depth", a much larger heat exchanger will also operate at this same
power level, and further power increases require heat exchangers re-
presented by points along the higher "depth" line. If the point pre-
viously referred to is not inside the horizontal projection of the next
higher tube bank "depth", there is a range of power values which cannot
be used since no suitable heat exchanger configuration exists in this
range.

The values on the abscissa (Total Blower Power - % of Plant Gross
Electrical Output) represent the proportion of 275 megawatts which is
dssigned to power the coolant blowers in the four primary heat ‘exchanger
e power consumption of Just ‘the four heat exchangers is 60%

 

 

of ‘the ‘abscissa value, and ‘the power consumption assignable to one heat
exchanger is 15% of the abscissa value.

“Figure 11 presents the results of the study on pure longitudinal
countercurrent flow over circumferentially finned tubes. The case for
helium at 300 psig with an inlet temperature of 850°F is considered.
In this figure, the length represents the total active length of the
finned tubing and the pitch represents the tube spacing in a "delta"

arrangement.

i Conclusions

Figure 12 presents optimization curves for the various coolants
and operating conditions in the form of yearly cost of fuel inventory
and blower power for one heat exchanger versus heat exchanger container
length ard diameter. Although an- economic optimum is found for each
case presented, it must be realized that the cost of heat exchanger

 

fabrication and the effects of heat exchanger size on overall plant con-
struction costs have not been comsidered in this presentation. By
small percentage increases in yearly operating costs above the optimum
value shown in Fig, 12, sizable reductions in heat exchanger length

are realized. Determination of how far one should go in this direction

 

would be one necessary step in an overall plant economic analysis.
For a given set of operating conditions, hydrogen proves to be the
most attractive coolant. If it is desired to avoid the hazards of

plicates the circuit control system somewhat, To accommodate a salt
flow failure, some provision would have to be made for diversion of the
coolant stream around the heat exchanger to avoid freezing the salt in
the tubing.

The use of steam as a coolant gas appears competitive with helium
since the containment problem is minor and the gas replacement costs
are negligible. The optimum steam heat exchanger is shorter but some-
what latrger in diameter than is the cage for helium. There is eg-
sentially no difference in operating cost. Another strong incentive
for the use of steam is the existence of a well developed technology
and the availability of commercial components suited to such a system.

Also presented in Figure 12 is the container dimensions for a
pure countercurrent flow heat exchanger using helium with an 850°F
inlet temperature in longitudinal flow over a "delta" array of circum-
ferentially finned tubing. Ignoring any particular advantage this ar-
rangement might possess which is outside the scope of the present study,
this case does not appear as attractive as the comparable crossflow case.
The container diameter is somewhat larger and the required container
length is longer throughout the operating cost range of primary interest,
In addition, this geometry does not possess the freedom for differential
thermal expansion that is inherent in the four pass serpentine salt tube.

It should be noted that the curves of Figures 12 and 13% are not
continuous as drawn (except for the countercurrent flow case in Figure
12). Since each point on the curve represents a tube bank "depth" in
tube rows (one less or one greater ‘than its neighbor), heat exchangers
meeting design conditions and having optimum salt inventories only occur
at the appropriate symbols.
co Figure 1h shows the effect on heat, exchanger container dimensions
and on. yearly operating cost for one heat exchanger wit of doubling the
allowable ‘salt side pressure arop end of ® cutting the uranium enrichment
by a factor of five.

Increasing the allowable salt side pressure drop means that the
length of the salt flow path can be increased. Since this increases the
available heat transfer surface per tube, the number of tubes can be re-
duced. Figure 1h shows that the end result of this change is a heat

exchanger container larger in diameter and shorter in length than is the
case with a smaller salt side pressure drop. There is a practical limit
to how far the design should be carried in this direction. When the
diameter of the containment vessel becomes too large for the correspond-
ing length, a change to a six salt pass geometry should be investigated.
The present study was not carried this far, but the basic equations

Listed in Table 6 are applicable for this purpose.

Figure 14 also illustrates the effect of lowering uranium enrich-
ment by a factor of five. In the area of interest, this reduces annual

operating charges for blower power and fuel inventory to 25 - Lot of
“their value at the higher enrichment.

: The results of this study can be used to predict the heat exchanger
requirements for increased or decreased reactor power levels for the
gspecifié¢ cases and operating conditions considered. The length of the

heat exchanger is a direct function of heat load and a direct ratio can

therefore be applied to this dimension, provided the change is not so
great as to disproportionate the length-diameter relationship of the

heat exchanger container.

By assumption of the number of passes, baffle spacing, L, and tube bank
depth, D, the heat transfer equation can be solved for a corresponding
number of tubes. Substitution of these values in the coolant pressure
drop equation gives a corresponding pressure drop which can be converted
to blower power consumption as follows:
% of circuit pressure drop assigned to ht. ex. - 60%
Volumetric flow rate through blower -- 6950 £t°/sec

The salt pressure drop equation was used to define the number of tubes
at which salt pressure drop is a ‘maximum for a given baffle spacing 5 Ly
and number of passes. The salt Reynolds Number equation i

defines the maximum number of tubes which can be used without going
below a given Reynolds number, In all cases, 3000 was taken as the
tii nimm desired Reynolds number. For the 1/ 2" tubing under: consideration
this defines 3470 tubes as the ‘maximm number useble.
Optimization curves for the various cases presented in Figures 12,
13 and 1h were based on the parameter values taken from their respective
grids at the intersection of the lines of constant tube bank "depth" with
the line of maximum salt pressure.drop. This defines power investment,
D, L, M and N for each case as well as the fuel volume in the tubes. Bend

 

 

fuel volume was obtained from Figure 15 and header volume was calculated

 

on the basis of a cone with a base diameter of 16.5 inches and a length *
determined by 0.1 M feet.
