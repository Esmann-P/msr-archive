IN- AND EX-REACTOR STRESS~RUPTURE PROPERTIES
OF HASTELLOY N TUBING

 

 

H. E. McCoy, Jr. and J. R. Weir, Jr.

ABSTRACT

The stress-rupture properties of two heats of
Hastelloy N tubing have been determined at 760°C in-
and ex-reactor. Irradiation reduced the rupture life
and the rupture strain, but no effects on the creep
rate were detectable. Small variations in behavior
of tubular specimens tested during irradiation and
small rod specimens tested after irradiation are
explained on the basis of differences in stress
states and sizes of test sections. The effects of
lrradiation are rationalized on the basis of the
behavior of helium which occurs in the metal as a
result of the thermal 19B(n,a) transformation.

INTRODUCTION

Numerous cases have been reported where the high-temperature mechan-

ical properties of nickel- and iron-base alloys deteriorated under neutron

1-9

irradiation. This deterioration manifests itself as both a reduction

been correlated with the thermal neutron dose and has been attributed to
the helium produced by the transmutation of 1°B to 71i and “He.6»9,10
However, the sensitivity of different materials to helium produced by
this process varies greatly? and our present state of understanding of
this problem necessitates that we study each material individually.

We have studied Hastelloy N, an alloy developed at Oak Ridge National
Laboratory specifically for use with molten fluoride salts. Tt is nickel
base, solid solution strengthened with about 16% Mo, and contains 7% Cr
for moderate oxidation resistance. However, this alloy has become a
candidate material for use in several other reactors and we are attempting
to learn as much as possible about this material in nuclear environments.
Recent studies have shown that the mechanical properties of this material
are indeed altered by irradiation.12,13

In this study we compared the in- and ex-reactor properties of two
vacuum-melted heats of Hastelloy N tubing at 760°C. The testing techniques
used in this program will be described and the resulting test data pre-
sented. These data will be compared with those obtained for the same

material in uniaxial postirradiation stress-rupture tests.

EXPERIMENTAL DETAILS

Test Materials

The two lots of material used in this study were 10,000 1b vacuum-
melted heats obtained from Allvac Metals Company. This material was con-
verted to tubing by Superior Tube and had a nominal inner diameter of
0.540 in. Heat 5911 was initially fabricated with a 0.015 in. wall, but
the same material was redrawn (designated 5911R) to obtain a 0.010 in.
wall, Heat 281-4-0143 was fabricated into tubing with a 0.010 in. wall.
The working schedule used to manufacture the tubing is proprietary and
details are not available. The chemical analysis of the fabricated mate-
rial is given in Table 1. A typical cross section of the as-received
tubing (Heat 281-4-0143) is shown in Fig. 1. This tubing was coated for
a specific application. Neither the coating composition nor the technique
for its application to the metal can be made available, but temperatures

as high as 1150°C were encountered in the processing. The microstructure

of the tubing before it was tested is shown in Fig. 2. Because of the
brittle nature of the coating, it probably exerted little influence on

the properties of the tubing.

Test Specimens

A drawing of the test specimens used in this study is shown in Fig. 3.
The assemblies were prepared by Atomics International(AT) and shipped to

ORNL for testing.

Testing Techniques

The apparatus used in ex-reactor tube burst tests is shown schemat-
ically in Fig. 4. Because of the relatively weak welds at both ends of
the tubes, only the center 3 in. section was heated. The furnace con-
sisted of three 1 in. zones with a thermocouple located on the specimen
at the center of each zone for monitoring the temperature. A single pro-
portioning controller was used with three variable power supplies for
controlling the temperature. The controller received its signal from
the thermocouple on the center zone and the variable power supplies were
adjusted to obtain a uniform temperature over nearly the entire center
3 in. of the specimen. The specimens were pressured with argon and the
external environment was air. After the pressure was adjusted manually,
the specimen was isolated from the gas supply. Failure was detected by
a reduction in the system pressure. This pressure change actuated a
switch that cut off a timer. Thus, failure was detected when the first
crack penetrated the tube wall.

The in-reactor experiments were run in a similar fashion although
the equipment was somewhat more complicated. Figure 5 shows a schematic
diagram of the test equipment. The purge gas in these experiments was
He—1 vol % 02. An experiment in two stages of completion is shown in
Figs. 6 and 7. The entire experiment is built on the framework shown
in Fig. 6. The sides of the can are welded on to obtain an integral unit
that can be immersed in the poolside of the ORR. The furnaces on these

specimens are similar to those used ex-reactor, the primary difference

sufficient to maintain the test temperature (760°C) while the reactor is
in operation.

The three in-reactor experiments which were run in this series of
tests utilized positions P-5 and P-6 in the ORR poolside. Both positions
have very similar flux levels. Cobalt-doped type 302 stainless steel
monitors were used. The thermal flux was obtained from the 3%Co(m,y)®0Co
reaction and the fast flux (> 4 Mev) was obtained from the 7%Fe(n,p)3*Mn
transmutation. The average values over the length of the test specimens

2 sec-1 thermal and 3 x 1012 neutrons em-2 sec™1

were 4 x 103 neutrons cm™
> 4 Mev.

The tubes were measured with a profilometer at AI before and after
testing. The ex-reactor specimens were measured at ORNL with a microm-

red with an optical com-

   

eter

 

the in-reactor specimens were mea
parator. The techniques used by both installations were in reasonably
good agreement, but the ORNL measurements have been used in all graphs.

The tubes were somewhat oval before testing and this made it difficult

 
10

to obtain accurate measurements of strain at the strains of 1% or less.

The tangential stresses were calculated from the standard thin-wall

formula
- kd
Og ~ 2% (1)

where

Oy = tangential stress,

P = internal gas pressure,

d = outside diameter, and

t = wall thickness.

The wall thickness, t, is probably the largest source of error in this

calculation since it varied by up to 0.0002 in. (2%).

EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

The test results obtained on the three lots of material are summarized
in Tables 2 and 3. These same data are plotted in Fig. 8 as the logarithm

of the tangential stress (g.) versus the rupture life. Within the accuracy

of the data, there do not cen to be any differences between the lots of
material. Hence, we can consider the data as two sets — irradiated and
unirradiated. The large effects of small doses on the rupture life are
somewhat surprising. For example, in test 5034R where the stress was
26,000 psi there was a reduction in rupture life of about an order of
magnitude although the dose at failure was only 7 x 1017 neutrons/cm?.
The bulk helium content in specimen 5034R (Table 3) at the time of its
failure was only about 35 ppb. The irradiated and unirradiated curves
are approximately parallel.

The tangential rupture strains are compared in Fig. 9 as a function
of rupture life. Most of the unirradiated specimens have fracture strains
from 7 to 10% although there are a few with strains as low as 4 to 5%.
The irradiated specimens exhibit tangential strains from a few tenths of
a percent to about 2%. The trend seems to be that of increasing fracture

strain with increasing rupture life (or decreasing stress). There are

two points for irradiated specimens that appear to be anomalous.

Another interesting correlation is shown in Fig. 10. If the strain
at fracture is divided by the time to fracture, a creep rate is obtained.
At 760°C Hastelloy N exhibits little, if any, primary creep. For a thin-
walled tube with the test being terminated when the first leak occurs,
there would probably be no tertiary creep. Hence, the creep rate obtained
is very close to the minimum creep rate that would be obtained from a
standard creep curve. The creep rates obtained in this manner are listed
in Tables 2 and 3 and plotted in Fig. 10. The data scatter about a
common line, independent of whether or not the specimens were irradiated.
Hence, the minimum creep rate does not appear to be influenced by

irradiation.

Figure 11 shows the random nature of the failures in the irradiated
specimens. There appear to be no systematic problems with temperature
control nor any marked influence on rupture life due to the range of
dose received by each specimen.

Two specimens were aged prior to testing in an effort to determine
whether thermal treatment produced any deleterious effects on the proper-
ties. These specimens were aged for 2300 hr at 760°C in argon and then
tested at 760°C. The data, shown in Table 2, indicate no severe effects.

real and should be studied further before using this particular lot of
tubing.

A subject of importance is a comparison of the behavior of the tubular
specimens with that of wrought specimens of the same material. Specimens
of heat 5911 were tested as both tubes and small rod specimens with a gage
section of 1 x 1/8 in. diameter. The details of the work on the rod
specimens were reported previously. 14 The heat treatments of the rods and
the tubes differed slightly, but probably not enough to be significant.

The small rod specimens were irradiated to a thermal dose of
2.3 x 1020 neutrons/cm? at 760°C and subjected to postirradiation creep
testing at the same temperature.

The differences in stress state between the tubes and the rods must
be considered. Weil et al.l’ showed that the effects of end restraint
on the properties of tubes are negligible for length to diameter ratios
greater than about two for a material with a strain hardening exponent
of about 0.3. Since our tubes had a length to diameter ratio of about eight
and were very thin walled, they are assumed to have been exposed to a

two-dimensional stress described by:

A comprehensive study of stress state was made by Kennedy et al.l6

on Inconel at 816°C. This work will be drawn on extensively to predict

lives of the rod specimens were greater than those of the tubes. This is
probably due to the different methods used to determine failure. Failure
of the tubes was indicated by a drop in the internal pressure. This would
occur when the first crack penetrated the thin tube wall and tangential
strains of only 7 to 10% were noted at failure. The rods were strained
until the specimen completely parted and strains of 30 to 40% were noted.
Thus 1t is probably more accurate to compare the lives of the two test
specimen configurations at similar strains. The curve for the time to
10% strain for the rods is also shown in Fig. 12. This curve has a
slightly different slope than that for the tube data, but at low stresses
the rods reach a strain of 10% in about one half the time for the tube

to fail. Thus, with similar fracture criterion for the two types of
specimens, Eq. (3) seems to predict the behavior reasonably well. The
irradiated rods and tubes both failed at low strains. The tubes were
stressed and irradiated simultaneously and about 100 hr were required

to accumulate thermal doses of 1 x 101° neutrons/cm?. The rods were
tested after they had been irradiated to a dose of 2.3 x 1020 neutrons/cm?.
Thus the longer rupture lives of the tubes at high stresses is probably
due to their lower dose. At low stresses the rupture lives of the tubes
and rods are similar. It is quite likely that the irradiated specimens
are brittle enough that their failure time 1s governed solely by the
maximum principal stress; hence the tubes and rods would be expected to

fail in equivalent times. Equation (3), which is based primarily on a

 
x

shear-stress criterion and depends to a lesser extent on the maximum
principal stress, may not strictly apply to the irradiated specimens.

Figure 14 compares the fracture strains of rods and tubes. Again, the
scatter in the data is greater than the predicted variation.

One complicating factor that has not been considered in comparing
the behavior of tubes under a biaxial stress and rods under a uniaxial
stress is that the stresses change differently with strain. In both
types of tests the stress is based on the initial dimensions (engineering
stress) and the true stress actually increases during the test. In the

uniaxial case the true stress (up to necking) ¢’ is given by

co’ =o(l+e) . (12)

Hence the tangential stress increases more rapidly with strain than does
the axial stress and the stress state changes with strain. This change

in stress state complicates the comparison of the two types of tests.

DISCUSSION OF RESULTS

The data indicate an effect of neutron irradiation characterized by
(a) a reduction in stress-rupture life, (b) a reduction in rupture ductility
with a trend of increasing fracture strain with increasing rupture life
(or decreasing stress), (c) no change in creep rate, and (d) a very low
neutron dose necessary to produce these property changes. These charac-
teristics are consistent with our understanding of how helium would
affect the properties of a material once it was introduced by the trans-
mutation of 0B. At least two excellent papers have been written which

deal with the behavior of helium in metals and we shall not discuss this
22

subject in detail.17,18 The 10g, because of its size and low solubility,
is initially segregated at the grain boundaries of the metal.” As the
10g is transmuted, the recoil range of the helium is about 2 pu (ref. 19)
and, hence, most of the helium will lie in the proximity of the boundaries.

The formation of intergranular voids under creep conditions is a
naturally occurring phenomenon in most metals.?% 2% Several mechanisms
have been suggested for their nucleation, 2’ but they are generally assumed
to grow by the diffusion of vacancies into the voids. The voids are

thermodynamically stable?® when

where:

of the boundary in which the void lies.
Thus, the surface tension provides a driving force for the void to collapse.

If a stress is applied that is large enough to balance the surface tension,

the void will be stable. If an even larger stress is applied, the bubble
will grow as the supply of vacancies allows. The presence of helium com-
plicates this process in at least two ways. The helium atoms can agglomer-
ate and serve as the void nucleus. The helium will also produce some
internal pressure in the void and thus reduce the stress that must be

applied to stabilize the void. In this case the equation above becomes

_ 2y
(0 +P) = r (cos 8)2°

Thus, the mechanism of creep fracture is not altered by the presence of
helium. If the stress is low and the temperature high, failure will occur
by the linking up of the intergranular voids. The strain in this case
will be a/d, where a is the void spacing and d is the grain diameter.?’
At higher stresses and lower temperatures, bulk deformation predominates
and the intergranular void formation process will become of less impor-
tance. The presence of helium will help nucleate and stabilize the voids
so that their growth will be important at higher stresses and lower
temperatures than normal.

The effects of helium content on the somewhat simplified process
Just described are not clear. The expected trend would be that increasing
concentrations would help nucleate and stabilize more voids. Since the
growth of voids under creep conditions is a natural phenomenon, it is
difficult to determine the minimum quantity of helium necessary to be
effective and the maximum quantity above which saturation of the effect
should occur. However, the data in the present study showed that large
effects were noted when the helium content was a few parts per billion
(atomic) and that these effects did not seem to increase greatly as the
helium content increased to a few parts per million (atomic).

The observation of increasing fracture ductility with decreasing
strain rate (decreasing stress) is quite interesting and has been obser-
ved for several lots of Hastelloy N. This can be rationalized from the

fact that the size of void that will grow decreases with decreasing

24

stress. This would probably result in an increase in the spacing of the

voids, a, and the strain, a/d, would become larger. The spacing could
also be decreased by the coalescence of bubbles. Hull and Rimmer?8

showed that the creep behavior of copper (in the absence of irradiation)
could be explained on the basis of an increase in the void spacing with

decreasing stress.

SUMMARY AND CONCLUSIONS

We have determined the properties of Hastelloy N tubes in- and ex-
reactor at 760°C. The rupture life was reduced by about a factor of 10,
even under conditions where the integrated thermal neutron dose was only
of the order of 1018 neutrons/cm?. The tangential rupture strains decreased
from values of 7 to 10% for the unirradiated tubes to 0.1 to 2% for the
irradiated tubes. The fracture strains for the irradiated tubes were a
minimum for those that failed in short times and increased as the rupture
life increased. Although the fracture strains were affected markedly by
irradiation, the creep rates of the tubes were not altered. These obser-
vations can be rationalized on the basis of a mechanism of radiation damage
involving helium produced by the thermal 10g (n,o) reaction.

The results for the tubular specimens are compared with those obtained
for rod specimens on the same heat of material. The results are in reason-
ably good agreement. The small strains and the inherent experimental
errors involved with the irradiated samples make it difficult to detect

any effects of the two different stress states on the fracture strains.
