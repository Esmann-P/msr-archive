1.3 Surge Volume — The total gas volume in the fuel-pump bowl and
the overflow tank shall be at least 5.0 ft° whenever the reactor
is critical. If this limit is reached, the reactor shall be
taken subcritical until the volumetric inventory of fuel is
reduced.

1.4 Excess Reactivity — The reactivity shall be such that the con-
trol rods must be withdrawn at least 50 percent of their total
worth to make the reactor critical at 1210°F. If this limit is
reached, the reactor shall be held subcritical uatil the ab-
normality is corrected.

1.5 Power — The reactor shall not be operated at a steady power in
excess of 8 Mw. If heat balances indicate nuclear power above
8.1 Mw for more than 1 hour, the heat-removal rate shall be re-
duced to a heat-balance power of 8.0 Mw or less.

1.6 Addition of Fissile Material — No more than 120 g of fissile
material shall be added to the fuel in the pump bowl in any

single addition.

1.7 Reactivity Anomaly — The reactivity anomaly shall not exceed
0.5% 3k/k while the reactor is critical. "Reactivity anomaly"

is defined as the difference between the observed reactivity and
the reactivity predicted on the basis of measured reactor physics
characteristics and calculated effects of changes in operating
conditions, burnup and fission product accumulation. If this
limit is reached, the reactor shall be taken subcritical.

*
1.8 System Test at Elevated Pressure — The fuel circulating system

 

and fuel drain-tank system shall be pressure-tested at least
once a year at a minimum pressure (measured in gas) of 45 psig,
a minimum temperature of 1150°F, and flush salt being circulated
by the fuel pump.

1.9 Corrosion — The chromium concentration in the fuel salt shall
not exceed 1000 ppm. If this limit is reached, steps shall be
taken to minimize the corrosion rate and to reduce the chromium

concentration in the fuel to less than 500 ppm.

 

*
This limit will not be reached by any spontaneous change of a pro-
cess variable, so no operator response is specified.

Control Rods and Safety System

 

2.1

2.8

Scram Circuit Tests — All scram circuits shall be shown to be
operating properly by testing before each fill of the reactor
vessel with fuel salt.

Scram Tests — The scram time for each control rod shall be
measured before each fill of the reactor vessel with fuel salt.
Scram Time — The reactor shall not be taken critical if the
scram time of any control rod is greater than 1.3 sec.

Rod Speed — The reactor shall not be taken critical if the
motor-driven speed of any control rod is less than 0.45 in. /sec
or more than 0.55 in. /sec. If a rod will not move, the reactor
shall be taken subcritical.

Control Rod Cooling — Any control rod that is not fully with-
drawn shall be supplied with cooling air whenever the reactor
is operating at powers above 15 kw. Temperatures in the rod
drive whose cooling air supply is connected to that for the rod
shall be accepted as evidence of air flow through the rod.

Instrument Shaft Water — The nuclear instrument shaft shall be

 

filled with water whenever fuel salt is in the reactor vessel.

If for any reason the water level cannot be maintained at

8L9-ft elevation or above, the fuel shall be drained.

Nuclear Startup Instrumentation — One neutron count-rate channel
shall be in service throughout the filling of the fuel loop with
fuel salt and whenever the reactor is being taken critical. If
an instrument failure occurs during filling, the fuel shall be
returned to the drain tank.

**
Flux Instrumentation — A minimum of two flux safety channels

 

shall be in service during nuclear operation.

 

*
This limit will not be reached by any spontaneous change of a pro-
cess variable, so no operator response is specified.

a fuel fill shall not be started if this limit is not met. If the

limit is violated after fuel is in the core, the reactor shall be taken
subcritical immediately by full insertion of all control rods and shall
not be taken critical until the requirements are met.

vessel. If this limit is reached, the nitrogen purge into the
cell shall be increased to bring the oxygen concentration below
5 percent as quickly as is practical.

Cell Pressure —— The pressure in the reactor cell and drain-tank
cell shall be maintained between -1 psig and -U4 psig whenever
fuel salt is in the reactor vessel, If either limit is reached
and the pressure cannot be brought back into limits within one
hour, the fuel shall be drained,

Cell Temperature — The average temperature of the atmosphere
in the reactor cell and drain-tank cell shall not exceed 350°F,
If this limit is reached the fuel shall be drained.

Cell Leak Rate During Operation — The leak rate of air into

 

the reactor and drain-tank cells shall be determined once per
week during reactor operation. It shall not exceed TO scfd at
the normal operating pressure of -2 psig and temperature of
130°F. If a measurement indicates a leak rate in excess of this
limit, the leak-rate data shall be analyzed without delay and

if the analysis does not indicate that the rate is actually
within limits, the fuel shall be drained.

Cell Leak Test at Elevated Pressure — The reactor and drain-tank
cells shall be leak-tested at least once per year at a minimum
pressure of 20 psig. The leak rate at this pressure shall not
exceed 280 scfd.

Reactor Cell Annulus Water — The water level in the reactor

 

cell annulus shall be maintained above elevation 844 ft - 9 in,
If this limit is reached, steps shall be taken without delay
to raise the water level, If the specified level cannot be

attained within LI hours, the reactor shall be taken subcritical.

 

*
This limit will not be reached by any spontaneous change of a
process variable, so no operator response is specified.

Vapor-Condensing System Pressure — The maximum vapor-condensing

 

system pressure shall not exceed 3 psig whenever fuel salt is in
the reactor vessel. If this limit is reached and the pressure
cannot be brought below 3 psig in one hour, the fuel shall be
drained.

Vapor-Condensing System Water Volume — The volume of water in

 

the vapor-condensing tank shall be between 8000 gallons and

9300 gallons whenever fuel salt is in the reactor vessel. If
the volume of water cannot be held in that range, the fuel shall
be drained.

*
Vapor-Condensing System Test at Elevated Pressure — The vapor-

 

condensing system shall be pressure-tested at least once per
year at a minimum pressure of 20 psig.

Ventilation Filters Test — The high-efficiency particulate

filters ('"absolute'" filters) at the stack shall be tested in

 

place at least once a year and after each change of filter ele-
ments. Filters in service shall have an efficiency of 99.9% or

Ventilation Through Open Cell — When openings are made into the

 

reactor cell or drain-tank cell, a flow of air shall be main-
tained through each opening from the operating area into the

cell. If a net inward flow cannot be maintained, the opening
shall be closed or be reduced in size to meet the requirement.

Fuel System Gas Supply Pressure — The pressure in the header

 

supplying cover gas to the fuel system shall not be less than
28 psig. If this limit is reached, appropriate block valves
shall be closed immediately to guarantee containment,

Leak Detector Header Pressure — The pressure in leak detector
headers connected to flanges in the fuel and fuel offgas systems
shall be at least 10 psi above the pressure inside any of the
connected flanges whenever fuel salt is in the reactor vessel.
If this limit is reached, appropriate block valves shall be

closed immediately to guarantee containment. .

variable,

so no operator response is specified.
1.15 Block Valve and Check Valve Test — All block valves and check
valves that are part of the primary containment of the fuel
cover gas and fuel offgas shall be leak-tested at least once
a year.

4,16 Thermal Shield Water Flow — A cooling water flow of at least
15 gpm shall be maintained through the thermal shield whenever
the reactor is critical, If the flow drops below this limit
while the reactor is critical and cannot be restored within one
hour, the reactor shall be taken subcritical.

5. Radiation

5.1 Building Radiation Monitors — A minimum of two radiation

 

monitors shall be in operation at all times, one in the high-bay
area and one in the office — control-room area. If a failure
should occur, steps shall be taken without delay to restore the
system. Until the normal system is again operable, equivalent
protection shall be provided by use of portable instruments and
special procedures.

5.2 Building Air Monitors — A minimum of two air activity monitors
shall be in operation at all times, one in the high-bay area
and one in the office — control-room area. If equipment failure

active materials from the ventilation stack, averaged over any
12-month period, shall not exceed 0.62 pc/sec of iodine,

79 mc /sec of noble gases, and 36 pc/sec of other mixed fission
products. If tais limit is reached, operations shall be re-
stricted to minimize further releases,

5.4 Stack Monitors — A system capable of monitoring release of
iodine, particulate B - y emitters, and particulate ¢ emitters
shall be in service on the ventilation stacks at all times. If
equipment failure should occur, steps shall be taken to minimize
the possibilities for undetected release and to restore the sys-

tem as soon as possible.

 

*
This limit will not be reached by any spontaneous change of a process
variable, so no operator response is specified.
