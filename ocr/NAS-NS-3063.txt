The Committee on Nuclear and Radiochemistry is one cf a aumber
of committees workimg under the Board cn Chemical Sciences and
Technelogy of the Commission on Physical Sciences, KEathematics,
and Resources of the Hationzl Academy cof Sciences--Kational
Research Council. Its members are drawn from azcademic,
industrial, snd government laboratories amd represent the areas
of nuclear chemistry, radiocheseistry, end nuclear medicine.

The Committee has concerned itself with theses areas of
nuclear science which involve the chemist, such as the
collection and distribution eof radiochemical procedures,
specialized techniques and instrumentation, the place of nuclear
and radiochemistry in college znd university programs, the
training of nuclear and radiochemists, radiochemistry in
environmental science, and redionuclides in nuclear medicine. A
major interest of the Committee is the publicaticn of the
#uclear Science Series of monographs on Radicchemistry znd on
Radiochericzl Techniques. In 1982 & third series on Nuclear
Hedicine ves initiated. :

The Committee hes endeavored tc present monographs that wiil
be of maxieum use to the working scientist. Each monograph
presents pertinent information required for razdiochemicel work
vith an individual element or with a specialized technique or
with the use of radionuclides in nuclear medicine.

Experts on the varicus subjects have been recruited to write
the monographs. The U.S. Department of Energy sponsors the
printing of the series.

The present monograph is a comprehensive revision and update
of three previously published monographs in the series on the
Radiochemistry of the Elements. It is published as part of our
continuing effort to update, revise, snd expand the previously
- published monographs to keep them current &nd relevant.

Preface

this monograph presents some procedures used in the
radiochemical isolation, purification and/or analysis of uranium,

neptunium, and plutonium. The original monographs were:

The Radiochemistry of Uranium, J. E. Gindler, NAS-NS-3050
{1%62), 350 pp.., 18 procedures.

The Radiochemistry of Neptunium, G. A. Burney and
R. M. Barbour, NAS-NS-3060 (1974), 229 pp.., 25 procedures.

The Radiochemistry of Flutonium, G. BH. Coleman, NAS-NS-3058 .
(1365), 184 pp., 25 procedures.

in addition to the description of the procedures, these
earlier monographs list the isotopes and their nuclear properties
for each element. They also discuss the chemistry of the
separation processes of these elements with primary empuasis on
precipitation, ion exchange and solvent extraction techniques. In
this update of the procedures, we have nct attempted to discuss
the developments in the chemistry of U, lp and Pu but have
restricted the monograph tc the newer procedures, most of which
have resulted from the. increased emphasis in environmental concern
which requires analysis of extremely small amounts of the actinide
element in quite complex matrices. The final section of this
monograph describes severai schemes for isolation of actinides by
oxidation state.

"The individual procedures from the earlier monographs are
listed by title to provide a more complete view of available
separation techniques. The new procedures in this monograph are
included for each element following the list from the earlier
publications. CL

INTRODUCTION

Since the publication of the original monograph on the radio-
chemistry of uranium in 1962, much attention has been given to methods
of separation, isolation, and measurement of small amounts of
uranium in various types of samples. Such samples involve geological,
biological, and environmental matrices, frequently of high complexity
and lcw uranium content. The procedures for such samples collected
in this monograph are meant not to supplant, but rather to supple-
ment those in the original mcnograph by allowing applicability of
the procedures to & wider variety of sample types.

These new procedures were chosen to provide description of
a wide variety of techniques rather than to fccus on any particular
method, such as neutron activation anaiysis or solvent extraction.
Some of the procedures emphasize the separation of uranium from
other elements, while for others, the main focus is the method of
measurement.

A complete procedure generally can be divided into three
operations: 1) sample preparation, 2) separation of the element(s)
of interest, and 3) analytical measurement. In many cases a
specific operation from one procedure can be used in conjunction
with other operations from anothe= procedure. This should
allow a broad spectrum of sample types. For each of the collected
procedures, sample types to which the procedure may be applied
are given. A more complete discussion of each procedure and
additional informaticn regarding applications can be obtained
from the original reference. In some cases, additional references
are listed, as they ~ontain similar, related procedures and might
be of interest in the case of some particular sample.

DISCUSSION OF THE PROCEDURES

The first two procedures involve precipitation of uranium
from large quantities of water. In the first procedure, NaOH
is used to precipitate uranium from seawater. The efficiency
of recovery of uranium and other heavy radionuclides from 750
grams of seawater by this procedure is shown in Figure 1.
The dspendency of the recovery efficiency on the volume of NaOH
added is evident, with maximum recovery occurring after addition
to tha 750 gram sample of at least 8 ml of 1.0 M NaOH, which
corresponds to a final NaOH concentration of approximately 0.01 M.
For different volumes of samples, the amount of base to be added”
should be modified so as to obtain a comparable NaOH concentration.
Figure 2 is an alpha spectrum of a uranium sample obtained from

the use of thiz method.

The second procedure involves the coprecipitation of
uranivm with iron potassium ferrocyanophosphonates. This procedure
can be used with larger volumes (several liters) of water and gives
‘a slightly better recovery in scme cases.

Procedures 3 ana 4 involve solvent extraction to preaconcen-.
trate and isolate the uranium. Procadure 3 uses tri-n-octylamine
(TOA) as extractant; details on the chemistry of this extractant is
described in the original uranium monograph, (NAS-NS-3050). This
procedure employs spectrophotometric analysis-.of the urenium by
<he use of arsenazo III reagent, which has come into wide use
since the publication of the first amonograph and is an excellent
reagent for the spectrophotomgtric determination of uranium.

It forms a brightly colored complex with uranium (VI) and can be
used to detect uranium in the part-per-million range (and, in some
cases, in even lower concentrations). The original series of
articles on the use of this reagent!”? should be read for details.

Procedure L also uses trioctylamine in the solvent extraction
of uranium from acidic aqueous media. This procedure employs
the use of 23%U tracer to correct for the low (2 - 1G%) uranium
yield. This isotope is convenient to use &5 a tracer since its
alpha decay energies (and those of its daughters) are above
. 5.8 MeV and therefore do not interfere in alpha spectroscopy with’
the peaks cf the more commonly encountered uranium isotopes.
The preparation of the 2?°U tracer by irradiation of thorium is
also described in the procedure®. The alpha spectrum of the puri-
fied 23°U (and its daughters) is shown in Figure 3, in which the
separation from the alpha spectra of ?°y, 2¥%y, and 2'%y is
easily seen. Quantitative analysis of samples is obtained by .
alpha spectroscopy and an appropriate yield correction obtainel
from the ?%°U. Although the yield is low, this procedure is
a useful one for soil whose complexity causes the low yield.

Procedures 5, 6, 7 and 8 involve icon exchange chromato-
graphy. Procedure 5S used Dowex-21K resin in either the malonic or
ascorbic acid form for the separation cf uranium from other metal
ions. This procedure is capable of separating uranium from a
host of other metals, and is therefore useful for purifying uran-
ium from highly contaminated samples such as fission products.
Uranium forms ‘a stronger anionic complex with both malonate and
ascorbate than most other metals and is retained on the column
while other metals are preferentially eluted with a series of
increasingly stronger eluting agents. Reported recovery is
excellent, 89% + 1%. Additionally, the procedure allows purifi-
cation of thorium, if it is present in the sample.

Procedure 6 uses Amberlite XAD-% resin, converted to the arsoaic
acid form, to separate uranium from natural waters in samples of
up to one liter in volume. Uranium recovery is dependent on pH,
as shown in Figure 4. Recovery and separations from other metal
ions is reported to be very good, with chromium(III) deing the
only interference. When present in equal concentration with
the uranium (0.% ppm), approximately 11% of the chromium was
eluted with the uranium fraction.

In Procedure 7, an initial column separation using RDEHP
(Zi-Z-2thylhexylphosphoric acid) supported on 0.1 - 0.2 mm Teflon
beads is used both to isolate the uranium fraction from a sample
and to separate the individual U(VI) and U(IV) fractions. The
separate fractions are purified by passage-through anion-exchange
resin columns prior to alpha spectrometry. Large amounts of Fe(III)
in a sample are reported to interfere with the separation.

However, reduction to Fe(II) with hydrazine hydrochloride eliminates

this interference.

: Procedure 8 employs a tetrahydrofuran-methy! glycol-HC1l
mixture with Dowex-l anion resin to separate ura am from acidified
natural waters. Quantitative analysis is performed by optical
spectroscopy with arsenazo III. Co

&n increasingly important analytical tool for alpha emitters
is employed in Procedure 9 wherein liquid scintillation alpha
counting is used to <etermine uranium in biological samples.
Instructions are gives: for t.~» use of both extractive and dispersive
scintillation cocktails. The c<¢tractive cocktail gives slightly
lower background counts, and wcald probably be the more desirable
method for samples with lower uranium content. Co

Procedure 10 is a neutron activation analysis for use with
solid biological materials. After irradiation, the uranium is
isolated by solvent extraction using HDEHP. The separated uraniux
is analyzed with a Ge(Li) detector by measurement of the 75 keV
gamma ray of #%°J. Reported yie.ds are in excess of 90%.
Procedure ll also describes a procedure of activation analysis.

in 196%, a procedure (reference 5) was published which quickly
became a laboratory standard for uranium analysis. Although it is
not really applicable to trace quantities of uranium, nor for
highly radioactive samples, and has been supplanted by newer pro-
cedures, it is worthy of mention since it is still in common
use in many analytical laboratories. In this procedure, uranium
(VI) is reduced to uranium(IV) by an excess of iron(II) sulfate
in a phosphoric acid-sulfamic acid solution. The excess iron(II)
is oxidized to iron(III) by nitric acid with a molybdenum(VI)
catalyst. The uranium(iV) is finally titrated with standard
potassium dichromate soluticn using barium diphenylamine sulfonate

as the indicator.

This procedure is applicable to solutions of 0-300 mg of
uraniwe per aliquot, with aliquot size up to about 15 ml. Optimum
uranius content is around 200 mg. There are relatively few inter-
ferences as compared with other redox methods, but vanadium,
bromide, iodide, and silver interfere directly with the redox
titrations of the U(IV). Additionally, if more than 100 mg of
of chromium(III) is present, the indicator end-point color change
will be masked by the intense color of the chremium solution for
determination of trace levels of uranium in sclid samples by
neutron activation analysis in which no chemicel separation is used.

73-82 (1877).
Sample Type: Bone and tissue samples. (This procedure can
be adapted tc other sample types; these modified
procedures are referenced).
Procedure:

Sample Preparation:

1. A. For small bone or tissue samples (<25 g), dissolve in
concentrated nitric acid with a smell amount of 30%
H,0, added.

B. Heat gently until a clear scluticn is obtained. (In
samples with small amounts of residual salts, do not
allow to go dry).

2. A. For large samples (>25 g), dissolve by repeated treatment
‘with HNO, (conc.) and 30% H,0,, evaporating to near dry-
ness between each treatment.

B. Heat the sample to 450°C in a furnace cvernight.

C. If the resulting ash is not white, repeat the acid
~ digestion and heating until 2 white ash remains.

D. Dissolve the ash in a sufficient volume of 2 M HNO, .

3. Depending on the counting method to be used, further treat-
ment at this point varies:

A. For samples to de treated by anion exchange separation,
dilute or treat the sample solution accordingly to give
the desired nitric or hydrochloric acid concentration.

B. For high activity samples to be courted with an aqueous-
phase-accepting scintillator, dilute the sample to
a known volume and add an aliquot to the scintillator.

C. For samples to be counted with an extractive scintillator
containing HDEHP., adé sufficient perchloric acid to the
sample solution to give a final solution which is 0.1 -

0.2 ¥ HClO, and in which all metal ions have been converted
to perchlorate salts. (Observe the usual precautions

for adding HC1lC, to a solution containing small amounts

of organic material). The nitric acid is evaporated at
slightly higher heat (150-170°C) in order to leave only
Robcrta/Choppin/¥ild

the perchloric acid and salts. Add 2 ml of saturated
21(KO,), per gram of sample to the hot sclution and
adé witdr tc make 3 ml of volume per gram of sample.

Counting in All-Purpose Scintillator:

160 g naphthalene
10 g PPO 72,5-ciphenyloxazole)
0.1 g POPC (2,2-p~phenylene-bis~S5-phenyloxazole)
385 ml xylene
385 ml dioxane
233 21 ethyl alcohol |

130) =»1 Triton X-100

Up to ZL ml of aqueous sample sclution may be taken up in
the scintillator (volume approximately 1S ml).

The alpha peak of interest must fall within the pulse-height
range observed. This can be determined two ways:

A. The peak may be located by counting through a narrow-ra:.;e

window and scanning across the entire available -range.

B. A multichannel analyzer can be connected to the scintill-
ation counter. (This technique has the additional benefit
of allowing visual differentiation of the alpha and
beta-gamma spectral.

Unless each sample has a very similar matrix, the alpha peak
position must be determined for each sample tc maintain
reproducible counting efficiency.

Typical background count rates run about 20-30 cpm with an
additional 10-20 cpm (from 40K) per each gram of tissue in
a sample. The practical lower limit for counting should
be a total count of at least twice the background.

Counting in an Extractive Scintiliator:

Extractive Scintillator:

1

161 g HDEHP (di(2-ethylhexyl)phosphoric acid}
8 g naphthalene
Lt g PBBO (2-4*-biphenylyi- 6-phenylbenzoxazole) or
S g PPO (2 »S-diphenyloxazole)
liter toulene

Transfer the sample (prepared as described under part 3.C. of
the sample preparation section) to a standard 20-ml scintill-

ation vial.

.

Roberts /Choppin/Wild
pege 139

Add 16 mi of the extractive scintillator and shake for 1
0 Z minutes. ol :

Allow zhe phases to separate (removal of the aqueous phase
is not necnssary, however) and place the vial in the counter.

A background count rate of 15-20 counts/minute from external
sources is generally the lower limit for the extractive
scintillator procedure.

Alpha energies differing by more than 1 KeV may be distinguish-
able since typical full peak width at half maximum peak height

is typically 0.9 - 1.0 MeV.

Note: The author describes a high resolution alpha scintill-
ation counting system in this paper and the one refer-
enced below. With that system, increased resolution
of complex mixtures is possible. Reported peak half-
width 1s 0.2 - 0.3 MeV and an energy identification

to 30.1 MeV.

Procedure: | |

Irradiation:

1. Lyophilize and store the samples in a dessicator before use.

2. Weigh the samples (200-450 mg) and encapsulate in a cleaned
polyethylene snap-cap vial.

3. _Encapsulate an uranium standard {a solution of NBS Standard
Reference materizl No. 9502 Uranium Oxide (U504), 99.94%
purity), consisting of 1 ml of 1.02 um U/ml.

Dissolution:
1. Add 100 ug of uranium carrier to the samples.

2. Wet ash the samples with mixed nitric and perchioric acids
(observing the usual perchloric acid precautions), and 1-2

mg of vanadium as a catalyst. 1-2 mg of chromium should
also be added to indicate when all of the organic matter

is destroyed. The green-orange Cr(III) + Cr(IV) color change
‘usually occurs in 6-10 minutes.

3. Remove the aqueous phase with a disposable pipet and discard.

%. Wash the organic phase at least once with 8 ¥ HNO, and
discard the wash solution.

5. Strip the uranium from the organic phase with lu M HF,

' shaking vigorously for 1-2 minutes.

6. Remove the aqueous phase (or an aiiquot, depending on

: acti.ity) for courting.

Counting:

1. Counting is performed with a large volume Ge(Li) detector and
4096 channel pulse height analyzer to measure the 75 keV 2!9Qy
gaxzma ray.

2. A small aliquot (50-250 ul) of the vanadium standard is

diluted to an appropriate volume (corresponding to the
final volume of the samples to be counted). During this
dilution, several milligrams of dissolved inactive uranium
carrier should be added to the standard solution to prevent
loss of the radioactive uranium.

Yield: 3.1 # 4%. Slightly higher yields zay be obtained
by using separatory funnels for the extractions
(for lower mechanical losses), but this method
increases the time required for phase separation.

VY. New Keptunium Procedures

INTRODUCTION

Neptunium is usually encountered as “’7Np (t& = 2.1% x 10%y)
in acid solutions of uranium reactor fuel elements. Neptu-~ium-237
is of relatively little use commercially except, pessibiy, for
the production of pure sources of ?3°Pu (by reactor neutron irrad-
iaticn) ard of ?°°U (the a-decay granddaughter of 2*7’Np). The
amount of 2’Np in the environment generally is so small as to be
unmeasurable as compared to ??°Pu, and no procedures were found
for separation of Np from environmental samples.

-Neptunium-239 is a transient species in reactor fuel elements,
due to its short half-life (2.35d). It completely disappears
shortly after the end of a neutron irradiation through decay to
23%Pu. HNeptunium-239 is most frequently used as a tracer to study
the chemistry of Np; it can be obtained from the neutron irradia-
tion of 2%°U or by milking a sample of 2*’Am with which it is ir
equilibriur as the a-decay daughter.

Two procedures are described for the separation of Np. The
first involves separation of #’°Np from irradiated 2%°U, and the
second involves separation of 2'’Np from a solution representing

that from a dissolved fuel element.

VI. - Nev Plutonium Procedures

INTRODUCTION

Since 1965, when the original monograph on the radiochemistry
of plutonium was published (1), significant changes have occurred
in the radiochemical separation and determination of plutonium.
Since the advent of a worldwide interest in ecology in the early
. 1970's, much attention has been directed at deteraining plutonium

concentrations in the enviromment: human and animal tissue,
plants, the atmosphere, and natural waters. These oeasureaents
involve the detection of extremely small concentrations of Pu in
relatively large matrices; e.g., liters of water or kg of tissue
or soil and sediments. This requires the reduction of the sample
and the quantitative concentration of the Pu to attain measurable
levels of activity free from interfering activities often in
significantly greater amounts (e.g., natural uranium and thorium
and their daughters). :

Separations procedures have been improved since 1965 by an
increase in the number and quality of solvent extraction reagents
which are available commercially. Many of the procedures presented
in the original monograph employed a solvent extraction step for
the purification of the Pu activity; most of these used either
thenoyltrifluoracetone (TTA) or tri-n-butylphosphate (TBP).

. Now available are such reagents as di-(2-ethylhexyl)orthophos-

phoric acid (HDEHP), trilaurylamine (TLA), tri-n-octylphosphine
oxide (TOPO), and tricaprylmethyiamine (Aliquat-336). Counting
methods have similarly improved with the introduction of the
silicon surface-barrier detector for a pulse-height analysis,
replacing the more coaplicated and considerably more expensive

Frisch grid with essentially nc loss in counting efficiency or
peak resolution.

The proliferation of nuclear power reactors throughout the
world since 13965 has also led to the development of a great many
procedures for the separation of Pu in macroscopic concentrations
from other actinides and fission products resulting from the
dissolution of uranium reactor fuel elements. These are rot
considered among "he procedures for this monograph since they
generally do not lend themselves well to a laboratory-scale
separation, but rather are relevant to a processing-plant
. operation with all the attendant precautions against radiation
hazards and leakage of radicactivity into the environment.

DISCUSSION OF THE PROCEDURES

The procedures presented herein reflect the interest in
measuring plutonium concentrations in the ecosphere arising prim-
erily from two sources: fallout from the large number of atmos-
pheric nuclear weapons tasts conducted prior to 13863 dy the United .
Roberts /Choppin/wiid
page 139

States, the United Xingdom, and the Soviet Union and, in

then, by the Chinesa and the French; and the introduction of
szall amounts of Pu to the environmunt through the discharge

of decontaminated low-level waste solutions dy processing plants
and other laboratories employing radiochemical techniques.

With the exception of Procedures 7 and 9 the fellowing
methods all use solvent extraction, by either batch separation
or column chromatography, as the main purification-concentration
step. Procedures 1 - 7 use electrodeposition of the sample
followed by ¢ pulse-height analysis for the Pu deteraination;
procedure 8 uses absorption spectrophotometry and procedure
. 9 uses standard scintillation counting. Electrodeposition is
generally carried out from a solution of ammonium chloride or
ammonium sulfate; procedures 1-6 offer semi-detailed descriptions
of the process. See the Reference 1 for a more detailed des-
cription of the electrodeposition cell and conditions affecting
the plating of Pu onto a metal disk. Occasionally, Pu in warm
or hot HNO, can be oxidized to the VI state which is no- retained,
subsequently, on an anion resin column. The use of NaNO, in :
these procedures ensures that Pu is present in oxidation state

III.

A word of caution: at higher pH values (> #), Pu(IV) tends
to form a hydroxy-polymer which cannot be easily destroyed and
which behaves differently from Pu species in higher acid con-
centrations. Methyl red indicator, used for adjusting the salt
and acid concentration in the electrc:lating solution, has a pH -
range of 4.4-6.0 for the equivalence point color change. If the
solution remains too long at the yellow (basic) color, this
hydroxy-poiymer of Pu could form, thus severely reducing the
electroplating yield. Tne use of methyl orange (pH range 3.l1-4.4)
as an indicator might serve to alleviate this potential danger.

Much recent research in piutonium chemistry is reviewed
in the papers in Reference 2.

Source: I. M. Tisenne and F. M. Perry, Radiochem. Radicanal.

Lets 33, 259 (1978).

Sample Type: Human or animal tissue

Procedure:

1.

A weighed amount of tissue is wet-ashed in conc. HNO,
containing a known amount of 2*Pu tracer to achieve destruc-

"tion of the organic naterial. Evaporate the solution just

to the point of dryness.

Add 100 ml of 8.5 M HNO, to the sample and warm to 89°C
to effect complete dissdlution. Add 2S mg of NaNGC, to
convert the Pu to the IV oxidation state. Continué waraiag
to remove excess nitrate.

Cool the solution to room temperature. Withdraw a 100 ul
aliquot of the solution, add to 25 ml of distilled water, and
titrate to the phenolphthalein end point with 0.1 N NaOH.

If the HNO. concentration is betueen 8 and 8.7 N, proceed to
step 4. 12 not, adjust the concentration to 8.% N with
either distilled water or ccnc. HNO, , as required’

Prewash a 30 vol 4 Aliquat-336 in toluene solution three
times with equal volumes of 8.5 N HNOC.,. Add two 50 ml
portions of the Aliquat-336 solution fo each of two 250
mi separatory funnels. Add 300 mg of Ca(NO,) dissolved in
8.5 N HNO, to the first separatory funnel.

Transfer the sazple with washes to the first separatory
funnel and shake for 3 min. Separate the phases and draw
off the aquecus phase into the second separatory funnel.

Shake the second separatory funnel for 3 min and separate
the phases. Discard the aqueous phase.

Combine the extractant phases into a separatory funnel and
wash twice for 3 min each with equal volumes of 8.5 N

HNO. and twice for 3 min each with equal volumes of conc. HCl.
Discard all of the acid washes.

Strip the Pu from the Aliquat-336 with two equal-volume
washes of 1 N HCL/0.01 N HF solutien. Combine the aqueous
strip solutions.

Vil. Oxidation State Procedures

INTRODUCTION

Thorium exists in oxidation IV and the transplutonium
actinides are typically trivalent although some use is made of
other oxidation states in their separation schemes. Uranium is
mest commonly found &s U(VI) in the form of the divalent UO .
However, neptunium and plutonium exist rather readily in oxidation
states III, IV, V and VI. Since the behavior in nature of these
latter two elements is dependent on the oxidaticn state or states
present in a particular scil or water, a major problem has been
the separation of the neptunium and plutonium species present
in a sample without changing the redox equilibria. The next
three procedures are schemes for such separations. :

In the first procedure, a combination of selective sorption
and solvert extraction is used tc separate Kp(IV), Np(V) and
Np(VI}). The same procedure works for plutonium. The second
procedure uses solvent extraction by TTA with aqueous solutions
of different pH values to achieve separation of the IV, V and
VI states. Since many natural waters are about neutral, a similar
procedure has been developed using dibenzoylmethane (DBM) which
is less scluble in neutral aqueous solutions than is TTA. This
is described in Procedure 3 for oxidation states III, IV, V and VI.
The An(IV) is sorbed on the vessel walls in the first extraction
but is pla ed in solution by the dilute HCl and extracted sub-
sequently.

Separation of Np(IV), Np(V) and Np(VI) by
Adsorption and Extraction

39, 1uu3 (1977).

Sample Type: Solutions

Procedure:

1.

(a)
(b)

Adjust an aliquot of the Np solution to pH6 with acetic acid
and/or ammonium hydroxide at a total volume of 5S ml. Add 100
ng silicic acid powder (100 mesh). Shake occasionally for

30 min. {The Np(IV) and Np(VI) are 100% sorbed, leaving Np(V)
in solution.

After separation by centrifugation, adjust the pH to 10-11 and
add a fresh 100 mg sample of silicic acid. With 30 minutes
occasional shaking, the Np(V) sorbs completely.

To a fresh aliquot of the Np solution, add HC10, to obtain 5 ml
solution which is 1M in HC10,.

Prepare a oy precipate of BaSO, by mixing 1 ml each of

¢.1 M Ba(NO and 0.2 M Na,SO,. “After 30 min, remove the
supernxzte Ra? add the - so ution. Allow 30 min for complete
sorption of the Np(IV) with no sorption of KRp(V) or Np(VI).

Oxidation state differentiation can alsc be achieved with
40% (v/v) TBP in benzene. From 3 M HCl solution, after 5-10
min, 90% extraction of Np(VI) is obtained with <5% Np(IV)

and Np(V). From 6 M HCi solut'on, after 5-10 min, 80% Np(IV)
and 100% Np(VI) but no Np(V) is extracted.

Note: This method has Deen used Zor plutonium also.
Pu(V) sorbs on CaCO, (ref. a) and TiO, (ref. Db) and can be
separated from Pu(vl) by a modificatidn of the above procedure
since Pu(IV) sorbs at lower pH values.
