A THEORETICAL STUDY OF Xe'35 POISONING KINETICS IN FLUID-FUELED,

GAS-SPARGED NUCLEAR REACTORS
M. T. Robinson

1. INTRODUCTION

One of the substantial advantages claimed for liquid fuels in very-high-power nuclear reactors
is the easy removal of Xe'3% from the fuel, with the consequent gains in neutron economy.’
This claim is at least partly supported by operating experience with the ARE.2 This report is

135 poisoning in a reactor in which this

concerned with a theoretical study of the kinetics of Xe
volatile poison is continuously removed by a stream of sparging gas. The theory is applied to
the experience with the ARE and is used to make predictions for the ART. Some comments on
full-scale aircraft power plants are also included.

The system is assumed to consist of two phases: the liquid fuel and the sparging gas. The
theory is concerned only with volume-averaged concentrations and neutron fluxes. Turbulent
motion of the two fluids is held to assure thorough mixing within each phase. The appropriate
differential equations which describe the behavior of the poisoning in such a system are derived
and solved. Steady-state behavior during high-power operation of the reactor is discussed.
Detailed kinetics of the poisoning during the approach to steady state are studied through a
series of calculations performed on the Oracle. A brief discussion of shutdown behavior follows.

135

A final section presents a rapid approximate method for calculating Xe poisoning in gas-

sparged fluid-fueled reactors.

2. DERIVATION OF THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

is of primary interest and is defined as

The related quantity y is defined as
1000, c
yo (2.14)

u

The virtue of this latter quantity stems from the identity

x ‘L

ok (2.15)
y °c

 

which will be required in deriving a relationship between As and A. By the use of Eqs. 2.7,
2.12, 2.13, and 2.14 and some abbreviations from Table 1, the differential equations for the

poisoning are written as

x = ah, + aA, (1 - eo %3) + aghy - (a, + As + Ax ; (2.16)

| y = BA x - Ch + a, BA; + Ay . (2.17)
The above equations apply during the nuclear power operation of a reactor. However, the
behavior of the poisoning during a shutdown must also be discussed. Inthis case it is necessary

to set A, = 0 and to replace the first two terms of Eq. 2.16 by the source term

ade 3 (2.18)

The boundary conditions needed in solving Eqs. 2.16 and 2.17 are discussed in Sec. 4.

3. RELATIONS BETWEEN THE VARIOUS PHASE-TRANSFER RATE CONSTANTS

The problem of studying the kinetics of Xe!33

poisoning can be simplified by eliminating
one of the phase-transfer rate constants, defined in Eqs. 2.6 and 2.10. The total rate of transfer
of xenon from the liquid phase to the gas phase is AVieps The total rate of transfer in the
reverse direction is AV c.. Now, while it probably cannot be realized in practice, there exists
some pair of values cr ci) corresponding to true thermodynamic equilibrium between the two
phases. The ‘law of mass action’’® requires that under these conditions the amount of material

entering a phase be the same as the amount leaving, that is, that

 

AViel = AVece
or
Vip ef
A= Ap — (3.1)
Ve <¢

 

3c. M. Guldberg and P. Waage, Etudes sur les affinities chimiques, 1867,

 

 
The solubility coefficient of a gas in a liquid is the equilibrium concentration of solute in the

liquid phase when the partial pressure of the substance in the gas phase is 1 atm. That is,
cl = pgs = cg RTS, (3.2)
where the ideal gas law has been used in the form

bg = ce RT

135

to relate the Xe pressure to its concentration in the gas phase. A combination of Eqs. 2.1

and 3.2 gives the desired result:
Vv

L
A, = As RTS Ve ’ (3.3)
whence
a, = RTS . (3.4)

Thus equilibrium solubility data may be used to eliminate the rate constant A.
Also, a relation may be derived between the ‘‘true’’ rate constants, As and A, and the *‘ap-

parent’ rate constant,? Aye The latter is defined by

Net Xe 3% transfer rate = “Ap . (3.5)

Equating this to the sum of rates defined in Eqs. 2.3 and 2.6, it is found that

 

A, = A = " “ (3.6)
L L
or, introducing Eq. 3.3,
c
A, = Ag 1 — RTS o . (3.7)

If Eqs. 3.4 and 2.15 are introduced, then

ay
A, = a0 -— (3.8)

Thus experimentally derived values of Ay may be compared with values calculated from the
solutions to Egs. 2.16 and 2.17.

The connection of the rate constant Ag to the usual mass-transfer film coefficient may be
shown by noting that the total net current of matter across the boundary between the liquid and
gas phases is

Q’ = Vie, + AV. = “AV leg ~ RTS cg) . (3.9)

According to the usual mass-transfer analysis,> the total current may be written as

0’

~&’Ala, - ag) . (3.10)

56. G. Brown et al., Unit Operations, p 510 ff, Wiley, New York, 1950.

 
 

Both phases are assumed to be ideal. The xenon activity in the liquid may be replaced by the
concentration. Therefore the standard state in the gas phase must be considered as that pressure

of xenon in equilibrium with unit concentration in the liquid. Thus
ag = pgs = RTS c. .
Then Eq. 3.10 becomes
Q" = ~k’Alc;, - RTSc;) . (3.10)

Comparison of Egs. 3.9 and 3.11 yields

 

(3.12)

In principle, the film coefficient £” can be computed from the geometry of the system and

the physical properties and flow rate of the liquid fuel through a relation of the type

k's

 

= f(Sc, Re) , (3.13)
L

135

where s is a characteristic dimension; D, is the diffusion coefficient of Xe in the liquid;

Re is the Reynolds number of the liquid; and Sc, the Schmidt number, is given by

vp

Sc = ,

Dy
in which v, is the kinematic viscosity of the liquid. It does not appear practical to calculate

As in this way, because of the complicated geometry and flow regime obtaining in the ARE and

ART.

4. SOLUTION OF THE DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS

135

The time dependence of the poisoning of a nuclear reactor due to Xe may be expressed

by the differential equations

x = 100) + ad y = kx (4.1)
and
y = Bhx = ky (4.2)
The source term is
£0) = ah, + ap (1 =e 3 (4.3)

when the reactor is in operation and
t

-—
fot) = a 8g 3 (4.4)
otherwise. The quantity 4, is related to the amount of [35 present at ¢ = 0.

By solving Eq. 4.2 for x, differentiating with respect to t, ond combining the results with

 

 
 

Eq. 4.1, the differential equation
Toa ly + ky + (ky = BAY = BAL)

is obtained. The solution to this equation may be written as

-Kqt —Kqot
y = ®t) + Ae + Be ,
where

Combining these results with Eq. 4.2 yields

The most general boundary conditions are
As t — 0, x —> x, and y—>vy, -

Inserting these conditions into Eqs. 4.6 and 4.9, the integration constants become

k, —- Ky BA,
A, =— yg -@ (0) - — Ix, - 6,0]
Ky = Kg Ky = Ky
and

in this report three special cases will be considered:

Case |. Reactor operation starting with '‘clean’’ condition. ~ The poisoning is given by
Eq. 4.9, using the function 4.10a. The integration constants are found from Eqs. 4.124 and b,
using xg = y, = 0 and the quantities ®,(0) and ©,(0).

Case ll. Reactor operation at zero nuclear power, after a period of high-power operation. ~
The poisoning is given by Eq. 4.9, using the function 4.106, The initial conditions are found
from solutions to the problem of case I. In this instance A; = 0, and the quantity 3 is found

from the equation

’,

), (4.13)

, —aqgl
ad = aA; (1 - e
where A is the value of A, for the preceding period of high-power operation and ¢” is the time

of operation.

Case lll. Sparging of reactor after a period of complete shutdown, during which no xenon is
removed. — The poisoning is given by Eq. 4.9, using the function 8,(t). In this case A; =0,
yo = 0, and 3 is found from

at’ a 7s
-aq -

t
a8 = aA (1 ~e ee (4.14)
where t”" is the time between the shutdown and the time t = 0. The quantity xq is calculated
from

,
’ aA; ~aqt’ ~aut” —a, tt”
xp = alt a (1-e

a - a (e oe (4.15)

where x is the poisoning at reactor shutdown, found from the solution to the problem of case |.

In dealing with cases ll and Ill above, it is of interest to know whether or not the quantities
x and y reach their extreme values (maxima) at the same time. When x reaches its maximum

value, from Eqs. 4.1 and 4.2, then
byt = BM fs = (kyky — a, BA )y* , (4.16)

where the asterisks indicate the special time value. It can readily be shown that the coefficients
of /3 and of y* are both always positive quantities. Thus y* can vanish only if
BA,
y* = — 5 - (4.17)
kiky — a BAY
Comparison of this equation with Eq. 4.6 shows that Eq. 4.17 cannot be satisfied in general, so
that the extreme behavior of x and y cannot be examined by studying the differential equations

alone.

 
 

5. STEADY-STATE OPERATION OF A REACTOR

For very long times of high-power operation, the poisoning reaches a steady-state value.
From Egs. 4.12 and 4.7, the steady-state values of x and y are®
(ag + a dk,
x, =—"— (5.1)
2
kiky = a,BA
and
(ag + aA BA BA

Yoo = — = £ Xoo . (5.2)
kiky ~ a, BA] 2

 

These relations can be used in estimating the steady-state poisoning of a reactor under various
conditions. The most convenient way to make these estimates is first to calculate
a
_ A 4 F Ag)
AY = ae (5.3)
a, + A + af /

This result is obtained by substituting Eqs. 5.1 and 5.2 into Eq. 3.8. If the mean lives

TS = - (5.4a)
?
and
1
7 = + (5.4%)
/
are now introduced, then
T= T+ wen . (5.5a)

Since a, << Agr this expression may be rewritten as

RTS Ve
Ty = Th (5.55)
v
G
Then x__ is computed through the relationship
(ag + aA,
mE (5.6)
a, + Ay + A,
The data in Table 2 have been used to estimate the steady-state poisoning, x_, in the ART for

It is of interest to examine briefly the expected behavior of ART-type reactors of higher

power, Although the poisoning of an unsparged reactor of this type is essentially independent

If there are no major differences in design of such a reactor and in particular if the fuel volume

basis of ART data, by simply adjusting A; in proportion to the power change. The results are

5000 STP liters of helium per day to maintain about 0.5% poisoning in a 300-Mw reactor, and if the aircraft

flies at a speed of 1000 mph (about Mach 1.3 at sea level), the plane will get some 18 miles per gallon of

Apnaesngly, other things being equal, the sparging-gas flow rate must increase linearly with
power, to maintain constant poisoning. It should be noted that while a decreased fuel volume
increases the term lv /(RTS V Win Eq. 5.7, this is roughly compensated by a corresponding

increase in A, , which is proportional to the volume-averaged flux.

figure. This results from the small volumetric flow rate of off gas in the ARE. This flow rate
is rate-determining, making an accurate estimate of As from experimental data difficult.

Figure 5 illustrates the poisoning effects that occur as a result of variations in the sparging:
gas flow rate, v., at a value A = 6x 10% sec=!. A comparison of Figs. 3 and 4 shows that

135 removal is primarily governed by the rate of

at early times (up to 10 hr or so) the rate of Xe
phase transfer, while for longer times the gas flow rate becomes controlling. Thus, under ARE
conditions, fission-gas removal may be termed ‘off-gas controlled.’’

Figure 6 illustrates the effects of A, on poisoning kinetics. As might be anticipated, the
results are roughly proportional to A, .

Figure 7 presents results on the time dependence of Ap which is called here the ‘apparent
rate constant’ for transfer of Xe'35 from fuel to off gas. The large decrease in A, with time is

clearly evident. Note also that dh /dt is everywhere negative.

Theory and experiment may be compared as follows.” By employing the abbreviations

and

the differential equation 2.16 may be written as

Now, in principle, a set of experimental data may be fitted to a power series (Eq. 6.32), and the
various coefficients of the series (Eq. 6.3c) can be determined from Eqs. 6.4a, 5, and c. Note
that from Eq. 3.8
A,(0) = A ,
so that the value of the coefficient g, (i.e., the behavior of the poisoning near the origin) is of
primary concern.
The experimental data on poisoning in the ARE'? are given in Table 3, along with calculated

contributions due to Sm'4? and to burnup of U23%. The neutron capture cross section of Sm!4°

was taken as 53,000 barns, !! and the burnup effect was calculated from'!

data were taken from Table 2. Since the Sm and burnup contributions are well within the

experimental error in the total poisoning, the experimental results are taken to apply to Xe!33
poisoning alone.

The results from the ARE cannot be treated by the method described above for two major
reasons:

1. The ARE data are based on the assumption that the origin of the (x,t) coordinates was
at the start of the experiment. Since about 7 hr of high-power operation preceded the ‘‘xenon

experiment,’’'? both 1135 and Xe!3% were present in the core at the time ‘zero’ in Table 3.

governs the scale of the x-coordinate. For the present calculations, a value of 1.36 x 10=%

neutrons/cm?/sec for the ARE thermal flux.

It has recently been shown that the Xe
barns.'2 The flux value employed was based on the values 575 barns for the U235 fission cross
section; 173 Mev per fission absorbed in the reactor; fuel density 3.24 g/cc; composition 13.59
wt % uranium, 93.4% enriched; and 2 Mw reactor power. The resulting value for the flux is not
more precise than 120%. It does not appear possible to expect agreement better than about a
factor of 2 between theory and experiment.

On this basis, results from the ARE have merely been compared with calculated curves

similar to those of Fig. 4. It is concluded that As must be larger than about 5 x 10~4 sec™! and

is probably around 1x 103 sec™'.

are presented in Figs. 9 and 10 for two different values of Ap Because of the much higher
sparging-gas flow rates, the ART will not be as insensitive to the rate of phase transfer as was
the ARE. Examination of Figs. 9 and 10 shows that the reactor will be more sensitive to off-
gas flow rate if As is comparatively small than it will if As is comparatively large. Poisoning
kinetics in the ART can be termed neither ‘off-gas controlled’’ nor ‘‘phase-transfer controlled,’

both processes being appreciably rate determining.

The time behavior of the apparent rate constant, Ayr is somewhat different from that in the
ARE, because of the much greater sparging-gas flow rate in the ART. Examination of Figs. 11
and 12 shows that at high gas flow rates A, reaches its steady-state value very rapidly ~ only
about 3 hr being required, compared with about 40 hr in the ARE. Physically, this means that
the gas phase in the ART reaches a steady state with the fuel phase very rapidly.

Recause of the rapid approach to steddy state of Ay it is possible to use the approximate

method of Sec. 9 for rapid calculations of ART poisoning kinetics.

 

By, converting the values of A_ to the values of v quoted, it has been assumed that the gas pressure
in the ART swirl chamber was about 2 psig. Then Ve (STP liters/day) = 2.27 Xx 10° A, (sec™).

Oss 8. KINETICS OF Xe'35 POISONING DURINE SHUTDOWNS'4

In this section a brief analysis will be made of the expected behavior of the Xe!33

poisoning
of the ART during shutdowns. For this purpose the equations derived in Sec. 4 for cases Il and
Il will be employed.

First to be considered is a shutdown of nuclear power during which fuel flow and sparging
are continued. The reactor is assumed to have been at steady state prior to shutdown. The
data given in Table 2 for the ART are chosen, with ul taken as 5 min. The result is not shown
since values for all the terms other than the one for 1'3% decay are always negligible. Under
the assumed conditions, the poisoning will not rise by as much as 1 or 2% of the steady-state
value. It is thus concluded that decreases in reactor power will cause no troublesome transient

135 poisoning in reactors of the ART type.

increase in the Xe

A more serious problem is concerned with the growth of xenon during a total shutdown. The
behavior of the ART is examined in this regard by assuming that after the reactor reaches steady-
state operation it is shut down totally and the xenon is allowed to grow in until it reaches its
maximum concentration. At this point, sparging is started and continued, at zero nuclear power,
It is necessary to determine how rapidly the poisoning can be reduced to the high-power steady-
state level. The behavior in this respect governs in large part the amount of ‘‘xenon override’’
which must be built into the reactor. The data used are from Table 2, with T=3 min. The
maximum poisoning was calculated from Eq. 4.15,

135

After the reactor is shut down, the Xe poisoning rises to a maximum of about 12%. If no

sparging were used, it would then decrease slowly, reaching the full-power steady-state value
in about 70 hr. During almost all this time, operation of the reactor would be impossible with
the control rod presently proposed for the ART. However, if sparging is started at the time of

135 concentration (11.2 hr after shutdown), rapid reduction in poisoning occurs.

135

maximum Xe
Figure 13 shows that Xe is reduced to the full-power steady-state value in about 36 min.
Since this time is less than that necessary to start up the ART after a total shutdown, '® there
seems to be no reason to provide large amounts of ‘xenon override’ in the control rod. This

statemen? remains true even if 7 is significantly larger than the value used here.

9. NOMOGRAMS FOR XENON-POISONING CAL CULATIONS

Two simple nomograms have been constructed to speed rough calculations of Xe 33 poisoning.

Although it is somewhat illogical to use the term *‘poisoning’’ in discussing conditions during a
reactor shutdown, it is convenient to do so. Difficulties are thus avoided in comparing shutdown con-
ditions with those during nuclear power operation.

E=1-U-WwWU-V). (9.9)

Then Eq. 9.7 becomes

Further, let
Z=WU-V)=1~U-- ¢&, (9.10)

Bars Cy, Ey, D, are linear scales in the variables U, V, and (U = V), respectively, the sub-
traction being performed on this subnomogram. Since the numerical value of (U ~ V) is not

required, no scale is inscribed on bar D,. Bars A, F, D, constitute a nomogram for the operation

Zz J v -v. (9.11)
w

Bar A is a linear scale in Z. Bar F is a scale in (1/W), constructed to obey Eq. 9.11, with the

Z and (U ~ V) scales both linear. Bars A, C,, and B constitute a nomogram for the operation
E=1-U-2. (9.12)

Bar B is linear in the variable £. The bars Cy, D,, E, are used as a subsidiary nomogram to

perform the operation
log (at) = loga + logt . (9.13)

These bars are linear in the variables log ¢, log at, and log a, respectively. The distances

between the five vertical bars are

AB = BC = CD = DE . (9.14)

Bar F is laid off between the origins of bar A (Z = 0) and bar D, (Uv -v) = 0L

To use nomogram 2, proceed as follows: From bar B of nomogram 1, read the value of
A; =0y,% and add to it the value Aye Enter this result on both bars E, and F. Lay a straight-
edge from the desired time on bar C, to the value on bar E,, locating the value (at) on bar D,.
Transfer this value to bar C,. Now lay the straightedge from bar C, to the desired time on bar
E,, locating a point on bar D,. Lay the straightedge from this point on bar D to the value
marked on bar F, locating a point on bar A. Finally, lay the straightedge from bar A to the point
marked on bar C,, locating the desired value £ on bar B. The procedure is illustrated by an
example shown on the nomogram by faint dashed lines.

The accuracy of these nomograms is limited by the precision of the input data, the process
of drawing, and the means of reproduction. It is believed that the versions given in this report

are accurate to around +5%.
