STATUS OF MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR PROGRAM

PART 1

INTERIM DESIGN OF A POWER REACTOR

1. INTRODUCTION AND CONCLUSIONS

The general usefulness of a fluid fueled reactor that can operate
at high temperatures with low pressures has been recognized for a long
time. The application of the molten salts to such & reactor system has
been discussed,’ and the operation of the Aircraft Reactor Experiment?
demonstrated the basic feasibility of the system. Preliminary design
studies indicated that power reactors based on such systems would be
economically attractive. This study gives a more detailed conceptual
design end outlines operational procedures so that the problems of
handling a molten-salt power reactor can be better visualized.

Particular attention has been given to the circulating-fuel system,
since this system and its associated equipment will be the heart of any
‘molten-salt reactor plant. Of perhaps lesser importance are the particular
reactor chosen for study (a two-region homogeneous converter) and the pars
ticular heat transfer system (two sodium circuits in series). Although
later studies may indicate better choices for the reactor and the heat
transfer system, ‘those selected for this study are considered to be sound
and to provide a good basis for © estimting the cost of power from a molten
: salt reactor.

The reactor power station chosen for study has a gross electrical

capacity of 275 Mw and a net capacity of 260 Mw. Figure 1.1 shows an

isometric drawing of the principal portion of reactor plant, and the
most important of the reactor statistics are presented in Table 1.1.

It is estimated that this molten-salt reactor power station could be
built for 70 million dollars. At 14% per year interest and an 80% load
factor, the fixed charges, including fuel-inventory rental, would amount
to 5.7 mills/kwh. Fuel and salt replacement costs of 1.7 mills/kvh and
an operation and maintenance charge of 1.5 mills/kwh (including chemical
plant operation) lead to a total estimated power cost of 8.9 mills/kwh.

The indicated power cost must be considered together with the state
of the technology of molten salts, of alloys for containing them, and of
engineering art for design and construction of a reactor in order to
determine the emphasis that should be placed on studies of the system
in the future. Summaries of the current state of the technology of the
salts, metals, and components are given in other parts of this report.
The fact of adequate solubility of uranium and thorium in the molten
salts and the strong position that is developing with respect to con=-
tainment of the salts are characteristics that make the molten salt syse-
tem unique among fluid-fuel systems. Although the materials studies are
not complete, the early results are so encouraging that plans should be
made now for the continued development of the molten=salt system.

The program visualized calls for carrying out the conceptual design
of an experimental reactor during the fiscal year 1959 so that detailed
design could be started by July 1, 1959. The experimental reactor would
be designed to test typical construction, operation, and maintenance
features of a large power reactor and could be completed by July 1, 1962.
After a two-year operational period, a very sound basis would exist for
deciding whether or not to build large molten-salt power reactors. In
this proposed program, it should be noted that a substantial part of the
materials compatibility program would be complete before the major expendi-

tures for an experimental reactor were made.

2, GENERAL FEATURES OF THE REACTOR

The ultimate power reactor of the molten-selt type will probably
have a graphite moderator, since a high breeding ratio is a major aim.
In order to obtain a breeding ratio as high as 1.0, it will be necessary
for the graphite to be in direct contact with the salt end with the nickel
alloy conteiner, Although it now seems probable that graphite will be
satisfactory for use in contact with the molten salt (see Part 3), the
technology is not considered to be far enough advenced to propose such a
system for the initial reactor. This consideration led to the specifica
“tion of a homogeneous molten-salt reactor for this design study. |

A number of molten fluoride salts that ere suitable for a reactor
fuel are described in Part 2. The base salt chosen for the fuel solvent’
is & mixture of 1147p and Bef, in the mole ratio 62 to 37, respectively.
The 1a! and Be base salts have the most desirable nuclear properties of
any of the possible salt cptions. Beryllium, in addition to having a
low neutron ebsorption cross section, adds appreciably to the slowing-.
down power of the fluorime in the salt. Lithium~T7 has the: lowest cross
section of the alkali fluorides. The exact percentages in the mixture
were determined &s & compromise of two physicel properties: the melting
point and the viscosity. The melting point increases &s the 1’ content
increases, but the viscosity correspondingly decreases, The fuél mixture
is prepared by edding to the base selt small emounts of ThE), and UF), the
ThF) being added to provide some regeneration of fissionable ‘material
in the core and the UF), being added to made the reactor critical. The
critical mixture celculated for initial fueling of the proposed reactor
has the’ composition: 61.8 mole 4:74 TP-36.9 mole % BeF,~1.0 mole % ThE),
0.3 mole % UF, with the uranium 93% enriched with #5, |

The selection of an 8-ft-dia core for this study was based primarily
on the criterion of critical inventory as indicated by nuclear calcula

‘tions covering core diameters of 5 to 10 ft. (Details of the nuclear

calculations are given in Part 4). The initial critical inventory for
a ye fueled reactor could be as low as 100 kg, which corresponds to

a critical mass of about 50 kg. In actual practice, however, thorium
(that is, 1 mole % THF), ) is added to the fuel to improve the regeneration
ratio and thus reduce fuel costs, and the resulting initial critical in=

ventory is about 600 kg. With thorium in the fuel, the 8-ft core is a

; reasonable choice that ylelds a good conversion ratio for a given invest-
ment. Further, the 8-ft core provides sufficient volume for the average
. power density in the core to be less than 100 w/cmd, which is well within

safe Limits. The gamma heating in the thicker parts of the core shell
was also taken into consideration, and it was estimated that with the
8-ft core the heating in the core shell would amount to 12 wom 5 -which
is not expected to create significant thermal stresses.

It was decided that it would be worthwhile to include a blanket in
this reactor system, despite the fairly high neutron absorption of the

core shell material, since the blanket would add between 0.2 and 0.3 to

‘the regeneration ratio and the increased saving in fuel costs would amount

to about $1,000,000 per year. Although the blanket adds some complications
to the reactor vessel; it offers compensations such as serving as a ther-
mal shield and as a convenient coolant for the fuel-expansion-tank dome,
which is subject to rather severe beta heating by the off-gas. The 2-ft-
thick blanket will allow less than 29 of the neutrons leaking from the

core to: ress through it without capture. The salt mixture Li 'F-BeF, o=ThF),
was. chosen for the blanket and its composition was selected as that ®vnien
would give the highest THF), content consistent with a melting point at
least 100°F ‘below the lowest temperature expected in the blanket region.
This ‘specification led to the composition 71 mole % LiF, 16 mole % BeF,,
13 mole 9 THF), which has a melting point of 980°F More recent chet oa

data indicate that up to about 16 mole % ThE), can be used without in-
creasing this melting point.

 
 

 

 

 

An alloy with the nominal composition 17 wt $ Mo, T wt % Cr, 5 wt %
Fe, and TL wt % Ni, which is designated INOR-8, was chosen as the struc-

tural material for all components of the reactor that will be in contact 3
with molten salts. Details of the characteristics and fabricability of
this alloy are presented in Part 3.

vi

 

oo The choice of the power level of this design study was arbitrary,
‘since the 8-ft reactor core is capable of operation at power levels of
up to 1900 Mw (thermal) without exceeding safe power densities. An
| electrical generator of 275 Mw capacity was chosen, since this is in
| the size range that a number of power companies have used in recent years,
‘end a plant of this size could be Justified in almost any section of the
United States. It is estimated that about 6% of the power would be used
in the station, and thus the net power to the system would be sbout 260 Mw.

Ivo sodium circuits in series were chosen as the heat transfer system
between the fuel salt and the steam. Delayed neutrons from the circulating
fuel will activate the primary heat exchanger and the sodium passing |
through it. A secondary heat exchanger system in which the heat will
transfer from the radioactive sodium to nonradioactive sodium will serve
' to prevent contamination of the steam generators » superheaters, and re-

heaters. A non-fuel-bearing molten fluoride salt is a possible alternate
choice for the radioactive intermediate coolant and bas some advantage
in that it is compatible with the fuel. In the design ‘adopted no danger
is expected to arise from mixing of the fuel salt and sodium, however,
and therefore the cheaper sodium system is preferred.

The fuel flow from the core is divided among four circuits, so that
there are four primary heat exchangers to take care of the core heat
generation. | This number of heat exchangers was based on maximum size vs
thermal-strain considerations. Each of the four parallel heat transfer
circuits originating in the fuel system transfers the heat through two
sodium circuits to the steam generators. A similar single circuit is *
provided to remove the heat generated in the blanket.
 

 

 

Other linkages between the fuel and steam that have been proposed
are a salt~to mercury-vapor system and a salteto~helium ges system.
The latter system is currently being studied.

‘A plan view of the reactor plant layout is presented in Figure 1.2,
and an elevation view is shown in Figure 1.3. The reactor and the pri
mary heat exchangers are contained in a large rectangular reactor cell,
which is sealed to provide double containment for any leakage of fission
gases and in which all operations must be carried out remotely after the
reactor has operated at pover. The primary heat exchangers are laid out

to provide an ineline heat exchange system. The rectangular configurs-

tion of the plant permits the grouping of similar equipment with a mini=-
mum of floor space and piping. The primary sodium circuits are thus
located in one bay under a crane, and in the next bay are the secondary
sodium circuits, the steam generators, superheaters, and reheaters under
another crane. The plant includes, in addition to the reactor and heat
exchanger systems and the electrical generation equipment, the control
room, chemical processing equipment, and the fill-andedrain tanks for

" the liquid systems.

3. MOLTENSALT SYSTEMS

3.1. Fuel and Blanket Circuits

The primary reactor cell, ‘which encloses the fuel and blanket cir-

cuits, is a rectangular concrete structure 2k rt wide, 68 ft long, and
70° £4 high. The walls are made of ‘9-ftathick barytes concrete to pro-
vide the biological shield. ‘Steel liners on both sides of the concrete
} wall form a ‘buffer zone to ensure - ‘that no fission gas that nay leak into
the cell can escape to the ‘atmosphere and that no air can enter the cell.
An: inert atmosphere is maintained in the cell at all times so that a
© small fuel leak will not lead to accelerated corrosion. Penetrations
for pipes. and for electrical end instrument lines are sealed on each side
of - the enclosure. oo aE

Once the reactor has been at power, the radiation level of the
reactor and the fuel and blanket circuits will be so high that it will
not be possible to perform direct maintenance operations on equipment
in these circuits. All equipment that might require replacement by re=-
mote means is installed in the shielded reactor cell. The alternative
of segregating each piece of equipment in a separate enclosure is more
costly in terms of space, shielding, piping, and fuel inventory. An
air lock is provided through which the crane and maintenance equipment
can be brought into the cell.

The principal items of equipment in the reactor cell are the reac-
tor vessel, the fuel and blanket pumps, the fuel and blanket heat ex-
changers, heating and insulation equipment, and the reactor cell cooling
system, and, of course, there are many electrical and miscellaneous plumbing
lines. The reactor vessel and the fuel and blanket pumps are a closely
coupled, integrated unit (Figure 1.4) which is suspended from a flange
on the fuel pump barrel. The vessel itself has two regions ~ one for
the fuel and one for the blanket salt. The fuel region consists of the
reactor core surmounted by an expansion chamber, which contains the
single fuel pump. The blanket region surrounds the fuel region and ex-
tends above the expansion chamber, and the blanket salt cools the walls
of the expansion chamber gas space and shields the pump motor.

Four tangential pipes serve as ducts to return fuel into the lower
conical section of the core. The core shell, which should be as thin
as possible in order to reduce neutron absorption and to keep thermal
strains from gamma heating as low as possible, was chosen to be 5/16 in.
thick to provide adequate strength against buckling under conditions of
maximum pressure differential between the blanket and the core regions.

temperature difference between the core and the outer shells will be
small, but during the preheating and during power transients the dif=-
ference may be higher. The diaphragm will safely allow for differ-
ential expansion corresponding to a temperature difference of 200°F
without undergoing appreciable plastic strain.

The pipe ducts that enter the reactor tangentially will impart a
swirling action to the fuel and keep it turbulent near the wall. No
fluid flow patterns have yet been obtained for a core of the shape il-
lustrated, and flow tests, when made, may dictate changes in the shape.
The pump for circulating the blanket salt is not supported directly on
the reactor vessel, but is located to the side and at a slightly higher
elevation to give full blanket coverage of the reactor at all times.

The general requirements of pumps for the fuel and blanket circuits
are discussed in Part 5. This design study is based on use of a pump
of the type shown in Figure 5.2 of that section, which has a capacity
of 24,000 gpm. Based on a fuel volume of 530 £13 in the entire circu-
lating system, the fuel will meke a complete circuit through the reactor,
piping, and heat exchangers in 10 sec. A 1000-hp motor will be needed |
for the fuel pump, and a shaft speed of 700 ru will be required. As

indicated in Part 5, this pump incorporates advanced features not present

in any molten-salt pumps operated to date. Some consideration was given
to the use of multiple pumps, but since a single fuel pump simplifies
the top portion of the reactor assembly, it was adopted for this study.

The blanket pump will be similar to the fuel pump, but of smaller
capacity. Since the heat generation in the blanket will be no more than
10% of the total heat generated, a pump of about 3200-gpm capacity is
required.

Four primary heat exchangers are provided for the fuel circuit so
that each heat exchanger will be of reasonable size, These heat ex=-

changers are designed to have the fuel on the shell side and sodium
‘inside the tubes. This arrangement is contrary to that which might

. of power level is improved by keeping the high cross section Xet

intuitively be proposed because it might be expected that the fuel
volume would be lower if the fuel were inside the tubes. However,

the superior properties of sodium as a heat transfer fluid are not
realized with the sodium on. ‘the shell side, and therefore the over-all
system is most compact with the sodium inside the tubes,

The heat exchangers (Figure 1.1) are of semicircular construction,
which provides for convenient piping to the top and bottom of the re-
actor. The blanket heat exchanger is similar in construction, but it
is scaled-down to be consistent with the smaller heat load. A more
detailed description of the heat exchanger is given in Table 1.2 of
Section Lk,

3.2, Off-Cas System

An efficient process for the continuous removal of fission-product
gases is provided that serves several purposes. The safety in the |
event of a fuel spill is ‘considerably enhanced if the redioactive gas
concentration in ‘the fuel is reduced vy stripping the gas as it is
formed. Further, the nuclear stability of the reactor under Er
continuously at & low level. Finally, many of the fission-product
roigons gre, in their decay chains, either noble gases for a period of
time or end their decay chains as stable noble gases, and therefore
the © butlaup of poisons is considersbly reduced by gps removal.

~The solubilities of noble gases in ‘some molten salts are given

in Part 2, and it is deduced that’ solubilities of similar orders of

‘magnitude a are likely to be found in the LiF-BeF, salt of this study.
It vas found that the solubility obeys Henry's lav, go that the equi~
oo - librium solubility | is proportional to the partial pressure of the gas

in. contact vith the. salt. In principle, “the ‘method of fission-gas re=

‘moval consists of providing an efficient mechanism Por contacting the

fuel salt with an inert ambient gas in which the concentration of Xenon.

. and. krypton is kept very low,

«15 «

 
 

 

‘In the system chosen, approximately 3.5% of the fuel flow is mixed
with helium purge gas and sprayed. into the reactor expansion tank, The
mixing and spraying provide a large fuel-to~purge-gas interface, which
promotes the establishment of equilibrium fission gas concentrations in
the fuel. The expansion tank provides a liquid surface area of approxi=-
mately 26 £42 for removal of the entrained purge and fission gas mixture,
The gas removal is effected by the balance between the difference in the
density of the fuel and the gases and the drag of the opposing fuel ve=
locity. The surface velocity downward in the expansion tank is approxie
mately 0.07 ft/sec, which should screen out all bubbles larger than
0.008 in. in radius. The probability that bubbles of this size will
enter the reactor is reduced by the depth of the expansion tank being
sufficient to allow time for small bubbles to coalesce and be removed.

The liquid volume of the fuel expansion tank is approximstely 40 £43
and the gas volume is approximately 35 £43, With a fuel purge gas rate
of 5 cfm, approximately 350 kw of beta heating from the decay of the
fission gases and their daughters is deposited in the fuel and on metal
surfaces of the fuel expansion tank. This 350 kw of heat is partly re-
moved by the bypass fuel circuit and the balance is transferred through
“the expansion tank walls to the reactor blanket.

\ The mixture of fission gases, decay products, and purge helium
leaves the expansion tank through the off-gas line, located in the top
of the tank, and Joins with a similar stream from the blanket expansion
tank (set Figure 1.5). The combined flow is delayed approximately 50 min
in a cooled volume to allow a large fraction of the shorter lived fidsion
products Yo decay before entering the cooled carbon beds. The carbon
beds provide a holdup time of approximately 6 days for krypton and much
longer for Xenon,

The purge gases, essentially free from activity, leave the carbon
beds to Join the gases from the gas-lubricated bearings of the pumps.
The ‘gases are then compressed and returned to the reactor to repeat the
cycle. Approximately every four days one of the carbon beds that has
been’ operating at minus 40° F is warmed to expel the xr 4 and other Bong
lived fission: product. A

| 3.3. Molten Salt Transfer Bquipment

‘The fuel transfer systems are shown gchematically in Figure 1.6.
Salt freeze valves, described in Pert 5; are used to isolate the indie -
vidual components in the fuel transfer lines end to isolate the chemical
plant from the components in: the reactor cell, With the exception of
the reactor draining operation, which is described below, the liquid is
transferred from one vessel to another ‘by differential, eas pressure.

By this means, fuel may be added to or withdrawn from the reactor during
pover operation. | -

The fuel added to the reactor will have a high concentration of
3%, with respect to the process fuel, so that additions to overcome
burnup will require transfer of only a small volume; similarly, thoriume
bearing molten salt may be added at any time to the fuel system. The
thorium, in addition to being e design constituent of “the fuel salt,
may be added in amounts required to serve as ea nuclear poison for ad
Justing the mean core temperature,

When fuel is removed from the reactor, it first goes to one of the
withdrewal tanks. These tanks will be sized to serve as holdup vessels |
from which material may be later transferred to the chemical plant, |
The chemical processing plant is considered to be.an integral part of |
the reactor complex; however, the chemical processing plant 1s set apart

from the reactor, is contained in separate cells and has e separate cons

trol center. _ As indicated elsewhere, the fuel-reprocessing cycle assumed
for this report requires an average daily withdrawal and addition of
about 2 £43 of fuel. If a 30-day holdup of fuel is required for cooling
~ before chemical processing, the withdrawal vessels must provide a volume
of 60 £3. They will require both a heating and a cooling system simi
ler to those provided for the mein fuel  fill-end-drein tenks in order |
to maintain the temperature within reasonable. limitse

MAIN FILL ¢ DRAIN SYSTEM

INERT SALT CHARGING

 

 
 

 

For the main fuel drain circuit, mechanical valves will be placed
in series with the freeze valves to establish a stagnant liquid suiteble
for freezing. Normally these mechanical valves will be left open.

‘Draining of the fuel will be accomplished by melting the plug in the freeze
line and allowing the fuel to drain by gravity. By opening gas pressure

: equalization valves, the “liquid in the reactor will flow to. the drain tenk,
‘and the gas in “the drain tank will. be transferred to the resctor system.

Thus gas will not have to be’ added to, or vented from, the primary system.
Two valves are located. in ‘erallel’ in the fuel drain line so that a spare
path will be available in the ‘event of failure or need for repairs.

All the liquid transfer lines will be equipped with heaters and
covered with insulation s0 that the system may be held at temperatures
above the fuel melting point, Since the main drain line is et the bottom
of the reactor, there will always be fuel in it. This line is kept from
freezing or overheating by use of a circulation bypass, as shown in Figure
1.6, to keep the stagnant portion confined to the freeze valve area. This

bypass provides a certainty that the drain line to the freeze valve is

always at temperature snd open for draining.

The blanket fluid transfer system is essentially the same as the
fuel system. A chemical processing plant will be provided for the blanket
salt, which may serve as & backup capacity for the fuel reprocessing

~ plant.

3.4. Heating Equipment

 

The melting points of the process fluids used are all well gbove
room temperature. It 1s thus necessary to provide a means of heating’
all pipes and equipment containing these fluids. This will, in general,
be accomplished by providing electric heaters to all pipes and equipment.
Inside the reactor cell, the heaters are incorporated in removable ase
semblies that consist of the heaters and the insulation, as shown in
Figure.l.T. Outside the cell, conventional methods of installing heaters
end insulation are used.

3.5. Auxiliary Cooling

Cooling is ‘provided in the reactor cell to remove ‘the. heat lost
through the pipe insulation and the heat generated in the structural
steel pipe and equipment supports by gamma-ray absorption. The heat
is removed by means of forced gas circulation through radiator-type
space coolers. A cooling medium, such as Dowtherm, in a closed loop
removes heat from the space coolers and dumps it to a water heat eX

©. changer.

3.6. Remote Maintenance

Provisions are made to carry out all maintenance operations in
‘the reactor cell by remote means. While some small repairs may pose
_ sibly be made in the reactor cell, the principal requirement is to be
able to remove and replace by remote means all the necessary components
in the reactor cell. This will include pumps, heat exchangers, pipe, -
heaters for pipe and equipment, instruments, and even the reactor ves=-

sel. '

A prime requisite for remote maintenance is a reliable method of
making and breaking joints in pipe. This can be done, either by de=-
veloping & remote cutting and welding process or by developing a satis-
factory flanged pipe joint (see Part 5). (The development of a remote
welding process is underway at Westinghouse on the PWR project,)

All equipment and pipe Joints in the reactor cell are laid out so
that they are accessible from above, Directly above the equipment is
a traveling bridge on which can be mounted one or more remotely opera=-
ted manipulators. At the top of the cell is another traveling bridge
for a remotely operated crane. At one end of the cell is an air lock
that connects with the maintenance area. The crane can move from the
bridge in the cell to a monorail in the air lock.

When it bas been ascertained that a piece of equipment should be
- replaced, the reactor will be shut down and drained, end the piece of
faulty equipment will be removed according to the following procedure.
‘The manipulator will be transported by the crane from the maintenance
ered through the air lock, to the cell, and placed on the manipulator
‘bridge. The manipulator will then be used to disconnect all instru
ment, electrical, and service connections from the equipment and to

~ unfasten the flanges tying the equipment to the system. The crane

will then Temove, the faulty equipment and transport it to the raintea
nance area, The crane will then be used to move & ‘spare piece’ of ejuip=~
ment into the cell for installation with the use of the manipulators
After completion of the replacement, the manipulator will be removed

| from the reactor cell by the crane, the air lock will be closed, and
the reactor will be ready for gtartup.. Preliminsry tests with a General
Mills manipulstor have demonstrated the feasibility of remotely removing
and replacing the rotating sssembly of & liquid metal pump. It appears
therefore that eatisfectory techniques can be developed for remote

maintenance °

Closed-circuit television equipment 1s provided for p— the

and replace the reactor, it is a comparatively simple and rugged piece

 

 

appear to be economically advisable for the anticipated maintenance oo i SA

vh

of equipment with a low ‘probability of 1allure, and therefore a spare

reactor will not be provided.

Maintenance of the tiitermediate sodium circuite will be done at-

rectly. In case of an equipment failure in one of these circuits, the
© loop will be drsined. At the end of a feirly short period, for residual
a

2k to decay, it will be possible to remove the top slab from the second-

ary cell end remove and replace the faulty equirment by using the building

oO crane and direct maintenance ‘procedures. Each secondary cell is ‘shielded,

so that the > adjacent cells need not be drained to make a Topas,

B 3.1 . Fuel Fill-and-Drain Tenk

The main fuel fill-and-drein Eyston must meet the following ma jor

design criteria:
(1) A preheating system must be provided that is capable of main-
taining the drain vessel and its connecting plumbing at 1200°F.

(2) A reliable heateremoval system must be provided that has suf-
ficient capacity to handle the fuel afterheat.

(3) The drain vessel must be "ever. safe" so that a critical con

dition cannot occur when the fuel is drained. oo 4

The fuel dreining operation has not been considered as an emergency
procedure; that is, one vhich must be accomplished in a relatively short

period of time in order to prevent a catastrophe, There are,. however,

other ‘incentives for rapid removel of the fluid from the fuel circuit.

. If, for example, there were a leak in the fuel system it would be ims
. portant to drain the fuel in order to minimize the cell contamination

end cross contamination of the systems. Further, rapid removel of the
fuel at the time of a shutdown for maintenance would have an economic
advantage in reducing ‘the power outage time.

Soh.

 
 

 

 

. A consideration of these factors indicated that the maximum after-
heat design load shotild be 10 Mw for a 600 Mw reactor that had been
operating for one year and had been shut down for 10 min before the fuel
drain was started. No credit was taken for fission-gas removal during

} operation. It was further estimated that 15 min would be required to

remove the fuel from the reactor.

For the drain vessel design calculations, it was assumed that at
1200°F the fuel system volume would be 600 £43, The design capacity of
the drain vessel was therefore set at 750 £13 in order to allow for
temperature excursions and a residual inventory. An array of 12-in.-
dia pipes was selected as the primary containment vessel of the drain
system in order to obtain a large surface area-to-volume ratio for heat
transfer efficiency and to provide a large amount of nuclear poison ma-
terisl (see Figure 1.8). Forty-eight 20~ft lengths of pipe are arranged
in six vertical banks connected on alternate ends with mitered joints.
The six banks of pipe are connected et the bottom with a common drain
line that connects with the fuel system. The drain system is preheated
and maintained at the desired temperature with electric heaters instal-
led in small«dismeter pipes located axially inside the 12-in.=-dia pipes.
These bayonet-type heaters can be removed or installed from one face of
the pipe array to facilitate maintenance. The entire system is instal-
led in en insulated room or furnace to minimize heat losses.

The removal of the fuel afterheat is accomplished by filling boiler
tubes installed between ‘the 12~in.-dia fuel-containing pipes with water

from headers that are normally filled. The boiler tubes will normally
be ary and at the ambient temperature of about 950°F. Cooling will be
accomplished. by ‘slowly flooding or "quenching" ‘the ‘tubes which furnish

a heat sink for radiant heat transfer from ‘the. fuel«containing pipes
to the boiler tubes. For the peak afterheat Load, about 150 gpm of

water is required to supply the boiler tubes.

-25

This fill-end-drain system satisfies the design criterig in that
it is always in & stendby condition, in which it is immedistely eveilable
for drainage of the fuel, it: cen adequately handle the fuel afterheat,
and it provides double containment of the fuel. Heat removal is essen=
tielly self-regulating in that the amount of heat removed 1s determined
by the radiant exchange between the vessels and water wall, Both the
water and the fuel systems are at low pressure, and & double failure
would be required for the two fluids to be mixed, The drein system tenk
may be easily enclosed and sealed from the atmosphere because there are
no large gas-cooling ducts or other major external systems commected to
it. A stainless steel trey will be placed below each benk of pipes to
catch the fuel if a leek develops. These treys will be cooled by water
walls to prevent any possibility of meltdown and destruction of the cell.

A preliminary eriticality calculation was made in a drain tenk es-
sembly without cooling walls, A mltiplication constant of 0.2 was esti-
mated for a fuel containing 0.5 mole % ThF, end 0,125 mole % UF, at a
temperature of 1250°F.,

4, ERAT TRANSFER SYSTEMS

The intermediate heat transfer systems use sodium as the working
fluld vo transfer heat from the fuel to ‘the steam system, The latter
accepts the heat in the steam generators, s the _superheaters, end the re=
heaters, A dlagren of the heat ‘removal. is shown. in Fig. 1.9. A speci

Each primary sodium circuit includes & primary heat exchanger in
the reactor cell and a pump and a secondary heat exchanger located in a |
cell adjacent to the reactor cell, No control of flow rates is required,
so there are no valves, and constant-speed centrifugal pumps are used.
With a pump stopped, thermal-convection flow would be available to remove
afterheat from the reactor. The secondary heat exchangers are of the
U=tube in U=-shell, counterflow design, with the sodium of the primary
circuit in the tubes and the sodium of the secondary circuit surrounding
the tubes. In order for the sodium to be at a lower pressure than that
of the fuel in the primary heat exchengers, the pumps for the primary |
sodium circuits are on the higher temperature legs of the circuits, The
essential characteristics of the various heat exchangers are described
in Table 1.2.

The secondary sodium circuits, except for the secondary heat ex-
changers, are outside the shielded area snd thus are available for ad
Justment end maintenance at &ll times. Three paths are provided for the
sodium flow from a secondary heat exchanger: a steam superheater, a
steam reheater, and a bypass line for control. Regulating valves autos
matically adjust the flow to sult the load conditions, so that at very
low loads most of the flow is through the bypass line. |

The three sodium streams ave recombined in & mixer or blender, which
leads to a three-way valve. At design point, sbout one-third of the flow
returns directly to the pump suction and two-thirds enters the steam gen
erator as the driving strean of a Jet pump, - The jet pump, - located verti-
cally along side the steam generator, ig assisted by thermal-convection
flow upward in the Jet pump and downward in the boiler, At low: power
levels, ’ this serves to maintain a good recirculation rete and ensure good
stability of control. The three-vey. valve permits. the steam generator
circuit to be isolated from the remainder of ‘the sodium so that at zero
power the entire boller becomes isothermal at the saturation temperature,
end ws pressure is maintained at the desired level.

A portion of the cooled sodium leaving the steam generator circuit
returns to the pump suction, which is constructed as a blender, end mixes
with the stream bypassed through the three-way valve. The centrifugal
pump is specified as two-speed, with the second speed being one-fourth
of full speed to give essentially one-fourth of the full flow so thet
the power output may be more easily regulated from 25% down to very low
levels.

The steam generator, Fig. 1.10, consists of tubes suspended in the
flowing sodium. In this Lewis~type boiler, the water flows through a
central tube to the bottom of each bayonet and boiling occurs during
upward flow in the outer annulus. Baffles in the steam dome separate.
the water and steam, and the water returns to & tray which collects it
for recirculation.

Just below the tube sheet and above the sodium, a thermal barrier
and & ges space ere provided to permit the tube sheet to be at the satu-
retion temperature and thus avoid thermal stresses. In addition, the
gas space will serve as & cushion for the initial shock in the event a
tube ruptures end water leaks into the sodium.

The superheater is a U-tube in a U-shell, counterflow exchanger,
with the steam inside the tubes. As in the steam generator, there is a
thermal barrier between the sodium and the tube sheet at the cold end
in order to minimize thermel stresses. The reheater consists of straight
tubes in a straight shell. With the sodium on the shell side, the tem-
perature difference between the shell end the tubes is sufficiently smell
thet this more economical construction can be used. The reheaters are

located nesr the turbine’ to give a small pressure drop in the reheated

 

stean.

5. TURBINE AND ELECTRIC SYSTEM

Steam is supplied to the 275-Mw-rated turbine at 1800 pele end 1000°F,

The single shaft of the turbine operates st 3600 ¥pm; there ere three
exhaust ends, The turbine heat rate is estimated to be T7700 Btu/kwh,

for a .cycle efficiency of 4hi,3%. The electrical generator end station

heat tates ere » respectively, 7860 and 8360 Btu/kwh. With 6% of the
electrical generator output used for station power, the supply to the
bug ber is 260 Mw. These estimates are based on Tennessee Velley
Authority heat balsnces for a turbine of this type 6 with adjustments
mede for the modified steam conditions! end the different plent require-
ments of the molten~salt reactor system.

The conditions given above were selected to give the minimum cost.
Increased cycle efficiency could be obtained with higher temperatures

- end higher pressures, but ‘the increase in efficiency would be offset by

the increases in equipment costs associated with the higher temperatures
and pressures.

6. NUCLEAR PERFORMANCE
The nuclear behavior of the particuler molten-salt reactor end fuel

processing cycle selected for this design study is presented in this’
gection. (A more detailed parametric study of the nuclear performance of

. molten-salt reactors is given in Part 4.) The reactor could utilize either

P33 or 2 2 5 but, since # 35 ‘is the only isotope presently availeble in

quantity, it was selected as the primary fuel, For comparison with other

reactors designed to use #3 8s a fuel, the performsnce of molten-salt
reactors fueled with ad is given in Part 4.

 

The date used were for Units Nos. 3 and 4 of the Gallatin Steam
Plant, Gallatin, Tennessee.

TH. R. Reese and J. R. Carlson, "Ihe Performance of Modern Turbines, "

Mech. Engr., March 1952, p 205.

 
 

 

For the nuclear analysis, the reactor was conceptually resolved into
& spherical core having & uniform temperature of 1180°F, a thin spherical
aore shell of INOR-8, & spherical spnulus of blanket fluid, and a spheri-
cal reactor shell, A blanket thickness of 2 ft eppeared to be sufficient
to prevent excessive losses of neutrons to the outside, and a core vessel
thickness of 1/3 in, was used. A reactor shell thickness of 2/3 in, vas
selected for the calculations, but, in many cases, the reactor shell wes
neglected in order to shorten the calculations.

The remaining independent verisbles of significence were the concen-
tration of thorium in the fuel salt, the diameter of the cores, end the
fuel salt reprocessing rate. Of principal interest were the corresponding
eritical inventories of P 5 end a 35 end the regeneration ratio. In
Pext 4, the results of a paremetric study of the initial states are pre-
senteds that is, the results are for "clean" reactors, having no fission
fragments or nonfissioneble isotopes of uranium other than aa present.
However, the optimm system could not be determined from such e study
alone; in perticuler, the time after startup when processing is initiated,
the method of processing, and the rate are important factors. The pera-
metric study of various fuel reprocessing schemes that is under way at
present is described in Part 4. This study is not yet complete because
the number of poseible combinations of independent variables is quite
large. Therefore, a typleal get of conditions » Which may turn out to
be nearly optimm, was selected for ‘presentation,

A core diesmeter of 8 £t end & thorium concentration of 1,0 mole
in the fuel salt were selected as a reasonable compromise between the
desire to minimize the inventory of a 35 end to maximize the regenera~
tion retio, The nuclear performance of the initial state is set fourth
in Teble 1.3.

A conversion ratio ef O. 63 is ‘believed to be bout the maximm that
cen be obtained in a homogeneous molten fluoride salt systen with #?
as the fuel (see Part 4), The performance with PP 3 vould be substen=

tially better, of course , end regeneration ratios of 0.90 or higher could

be obtained in the clean reactors. Further, as discussed in Section 2
above, the use of graphite to moderate the fluoride reactor may result
in substantial improvement.

The neutron balence ig presented in terms of neutrons absorbed in
each element per neutron &bsorbed in #2, 2 Thus the sum of the absorp= |
tions in thorium end 2 give, directly, the regeneration ratio, and
the sun of all the ebsorptions gives, the number of neutrons produced
by fission per neutron ebsorbed in Pd 5. bn exsmination of Table 1.3
shows that about one-third of the regeneration takes place in the blenket.
The single, most importent loss of neutrons is to radiative capture in
v®2 2 5 if ether parasitic captures and leskages could be reduced to zero,
the regeneration ratio would still be limited to 0.80 in this reactor
by radiative capture in ?2 5 . The other important losses are to carrier
salt in the core and to the core vessel, which reduce the regeneration
ratio by 0.10 and 0.05, respectively. Losses to the blanket salt and to
leskage smount to less than 0,02 neutrons, )

Of the neutrons lost to the carrier salt » the majority are captured
by fluorine, and the loss is unavoidable. The lithium is specified to
be 99.99% 117, end the 118 content is estimated to be about equal to that
which would be in equilibrium with the n-0 reaction in beryllium. Hence,
there is no point in specifying a lower concentration of 15, The system
contains nearly 10,000 kg of purified 147, Of the neutrons lost to the
core vessel, about one-third are captured by the molybdenum; nickel cap-
tures account for most of the remaining loss. Increasing the herdness
of the neutron spectiipt by increasing the thorium concentration tends to
decrease the sbsopptidas in the carrier salt and in the core vessel, but
this decrease ig /mord than offset by the decline in M of La at higher
energles, -

The accumulation of fission fragments end nonfissionable uranium
isotopes tends to increase the inventory of Pd 5 and to depress the re- -
generation ratio. The production of # 35 tends to counteract these
effects, Nevertheless , if the fission products are not removed, the

“@ Bf =

 
 

 

 

inventory of o£ will increase rapidly from 600 to 900 kg during the
first year of operation. The regeneration ratio will fall from 0.63 to
0.53 in the same period. About TO kg of #2 5 vill have accumulsted, of
which 85% will be in the fuel salt.

The nuclear characteristics of the system et the end of the first
year are presented in Table 1.4. As may be seen, the increasing hardness
of the neutron spectrum results in a decrease of losses of neutrons to
the fuel salt and to the core vessel to 0.012, “but this saving is more
then offset by the corresponding decline in M to 1.78 (averaged over
all three fissionable isotopes present).

If the fission products were allowed to accumilate further, the
3 2 inventory would continue to rise. If, hovever, the fuel salt is
reprocessed continuously at the rate of one fuel volume per yesr (thus
holding the fission product concentration constant) 5 the 2 2 inventory
and regeneration ratio can be held stationary, as shown in Part 4, Fig.
4,10, The continual incresse in the concentrations of nonfissionesble
uranium isetopes 1s compensated by the accumuletion of a 5 . A neutron
balance for the system at the end of twenty years is given in Teble 1.5.

As may be seen, 2% is much more harmful than $B s Since it cap=-

‘dures 2,5 times as many neutrons and does not form & fissionable isotope.

Despite these losses, however, the regeneration ratio does not decrease
appreciably, mainly because of the superior properties of v3 5 s which
provides 40% of the fissions.

In summary, once reprocessing to remove fission products is begun,
nuclear performance of the system is stabilized to a satisfactory degree
for twenty years. No provision for the removal of the nonfissioneble
isotopes of uranium need be made. |

If desired, the transients during the first year of operation cen’
be largely eliminated by allowing the thorium conesntration to decrease ’
partly through burnup end partly through withdrewel. Such & case is
shown in Fig. 4.10 as a dashed line, in which the core reprocessing is

begun immediately end the thorium is removed at the rate of 1/900 per

day, in addition to the normal burnout at the rate of 1/4300 per day.

The critical inventory rises within one month to a meximm of 626 kg and
then falls to 590 kg at the end of eight months. At this time the re-
processing rate is increased to 1/360 per day, end the thorium is returned
to the core. Thus, the thorium concentration falls thereafter only by
burnout. The regeneration ratio is little different from that of the
previous case during the first two years, as indicated by the dashed line,
but 1t falls steadily thereafter. The #2 5 inventory rises slowly, but
the az 5 inventory is stabilized at 200 kg after about six years. The
£35 inventory could have been stabilized at the twe~year value by modest
withdrawals of thorium; however, the regeneration ratio would have fallen
fester and additions of 2 5 to compensate for burnup would have been
greater.

A necessary condition for the feasibility of a molten-salt reactor
is the integrity of the core vessel. This member is exposed to high-
Intensity neutron and gamma fields, and it is therefore subject to both
radiation damage end thermal stress. With a preliminary estimate of the
heating in a comparable reactor having & pure nickel core vessel’ as a
basis and with allowance made for such differences as diameter and com=-
position of the fuel salt, the combined gamma and neutron heating in an
8-ft-dis INOR-8 core vessel in a reactor having 0.5 mole % ThF), in the
~ fuel salt and operating at a Poe level of 600 Mw of heet was estimated
to be not greater than 12 w/ cm’ of metal. The rate of heat release in
the blanket salt was estimated to be not greeter then 50 Mw, exclusive
of eny. contribution from fissions in the blanket, which may add up to
another jd Mi.

T. PROCEDURE FOR PLANT STARTUP

The initial startup of the plent will be accomplished in four steps:
(1) preliminary checking of the systems, (2) preheating end £illing of
the fluid circuits , (3) enriching to criticality, and (4) operating at
low power. The integrity and proper functioning of the equipment will
be established, insofar as possible, in the preliminary checking of the
system, This step will include, in addition to cleaning and leak testing,
checks of instrument and elerm equipment settings and functioning, cone
tinuity end polarity of the electrical circuits, direction of rotation
of rotary elements , and operation of valves end suxiliery systems. |

In the second step, the fuel, blanket salt, and sodium circuits
will be preheated to ebove the melting points of the various mediums
and then filled. The preheating loads will be divided into manageable
sections that can be eutomaticelly monitored for hot and cold spots so.
thet thermal stresses may be minimized. The systems will be filled at
temperatures as low as practical so that full advantage can be taken of
fluid circulation as a means of bringing the system to an isothermal con-
dition before enrichment. During the initial period of fluld circulation
to establish the isothermal condition, the proper functioning of the flow
control equipment will be established. Also the cleanliness and metal=-
lurgical stability of the containment system will be evaluated by analyzing
samples withdrawn from the fluid systems. The operability of the fuel
system withdrawing and enriching equipment will be checked with barren.
salt; the high-temperature instrumentation will be checked; the draining
end refilling procedures will be verified by testing; and remote mainten-
ence techniques will be tried out. This period of nonnuclear isothermal
operation at high temperature will elso serve to familiarize the operating
crews with the system and to establish their confidence in its gperability.

The preheating and £111ing procedures will begin with the introduc-
tion of water to the steem generstors. The steam generators and the
sodium systems will then be preheated to 350°F, which will produce a

- U2 a

 
 

 

pressure of 150 psi in the steam system. The sodium will then be prese-
purized from the sodium drain tenks into the primary and secondary sodium
systems, the sodium pumps will be started, end flow will be established.
Both sodium systems will then be further heated to 600°F by using the
electric heaters and by making use of the fluid circuletion. Simulta-
neously the fuel and blanket circuits will be heated with electric heaters
to the same temperature. The pressure in the steam generators will have
risen to approximately 1800 psi and, before further system heating is
attempted, a small loed will be imposed on the steam generators to hold

the water temperature to 600°F as the rest of the circuits are heated to
higher temperatures. The steam generators will be loaded by bypassing

a small steam flow around the turbine, This load will be determined by

the amount of excess power availble during the heating period from pumping
power end external heat sources in the systems. The load will be low |
relative to the design capacity of the steam generators; there will probably
‘be less then 1 Mw availeble for bypess steem generetion in the five units.

At this juncture any increase in water temperature (above 600°F)
would result in overpressurization of the steam system, and if the steam
generators were allowed to evaporate to dryness end go to higher tempera-
tures, severe thermal shocks would be imposed on the structures when
water was again introduced. Therefore , the sodium flow to the steam
generators will be reduced as the reactor systems are elevated in tenm-
perature. The flow in the ‘secondary sodium loops will be reduced by
lowering the pump speed, which in turn will reduce the flow to the steam

) generators, s and the throttling velves: will be mainpulated to reduce the
proportion of the total flow through ¢ the generators. end to shunt the flow
oo around the superheaters. -

When the reactor end prinary sodium eircutts have Toei , preheated :
to 1100° F, the salts will then ‘be charged from the dump tenks into the
process  etrouttry, ‘end flow will be established,

- 43 a

 
 

 

 

 

 

At this time all the reactor heat transfer loops will have been filled,
and the reactor will be operating isothermally at 1100°F. The steam gen-
erators will be running at temperatures less than 625°F, and the super-
heater end reheater sodium circuits will be running at temperatures less
then 1100°F but greater than 625°F. The heat that is transferred through
the systems by virtue of the 475°F gradient will be dumped in the steam
bypassing the turbine. This heat load may be veried by chenging the rate
of dumping of the stéam end the sodium flow rate in the steam generators.

_ When it has been established that the plent is performing satisfac-

torily and thet the systems are tight and chemically clean, the critical

experiment will be started. Fuel concentrate will be added to the reector
through the enrichment system. Approximately 38 £4° of LiF-BeF,~UF), mix
ture centaining 2.5 mole % UF), will have to be edded to the 5%0 £12 of
carrier salt to achieve a fuel concentration of 0,15 mole % UF. As the
concentrate is added, it may be necessary to withdraw fluid from the fuel
system so that an adequate expension volume will be availeble in the
expansion tank. The reactor will be titrated to criticality at 1100°F,
and after criticality has been achieved, a thorium-enriched salt will be
added to the fuel mixture. This will drive the temperature down, and
the operating temperature may be finally trimmed by alternate additions
of fuel end thorium concentrate mixtures. By adding the thorium to the

- system as a last step, its worth as a poison or chemical ‘temperature shim

may be evaluated before power operation.

A period of low power operation will fellow the criticality experi-
ment. By virtue of the negative temperature coefficient, the reactor -
will be & slave to the demand load, vhich will be imposed by increasing
the steam generation rate as a result of increasing the rate of sodium
flow through the steam system. Manual menipuletion of system control
valves will be required until an appreciable fraction of design power ©
1s obtained, say, 30%. The rate at which the load may be increased will
be determined by the permissible rate of temperature change of the com=
ponents. oo SEE

1

 

 
 

 

The turbine will be preheated by admitting steem through the turbine
control velves, and, when the turbine has been heated and brought up to
speed, all the steam will be directed through its normal path. At low
power levels, it may be necessary to attemper the steam so thet the tur-
bine temperature limits will not be exceeded.

Normal plant restexrts efter power operation will follow the same
basic procedures, except that no critical experiment will be required.
Since there is no control rod, close attention will have to be paid to
the fuel system filling rate end temperature so that nuclear trensients
will not be incurred.

8. REACTOR CONTROL AND REFUELING

The kinetics of circulating fuel reactors have been studied and
reported in & number of papers.’ A typical value for the temperature
coefficient of reactivity for a molten-salt reactor is »k x 10"? (Ak/x)/° Fe
This negative temperature coefficient is sufficient to mske the power
level in the reactor a slave to the applied load for all pormal opere-

the conditions that exist after fuel reprocessing is initiated.

The following diséussion gives the initial results of a study of
difficulties that may srise as & result of accidental occurrences in

various parts of the reactor system. Although no plausible accidents

further experimental and design efforts to determine the most economical
way of handling some situations is epparent. |

The transient behavior of the reactor system hes been snslyzed by
enslog computer techniques for several types of sudden changes in the
heat load on the resctor.'0 The reactor flow disgrem essumed for the
simulator study is shown in Fig. 1.12. This diegrem segregates one of
the core heat transfer paths for individual menipulation, end lumps the
others together into one heat sump. The ‘temperature coefficient: of re~
activity assumed was ok x 107 /° F. ve

This is the limiting cease of en accident occurring to only one of
the core heat transfer paths at the maximum distance awey from the reactor.
All temperatures upstream of the failure tend to become isothermal at
the new reactor outlet temperature, which is slightly lower them that
under full power. The temperature change in the piping and heat exchangers
is rapid and emounts to 200°F or more. The heat exchangers, as designed,
will withstand the temperature changes, but a complete stress analysis
of the piping layout should be made before such a reactor plant is built.

9.2. An Instentaneous Stoppage of Sodium Flow in One of the Primary Heat
Exchangers

Thies case is similar to thet discussed ebove, except that tempera-
tures downstream from the primary heat exchanger drop quickly to & lower
isothermal temperature. During the trensient the mean core temperature
of the reactor rises to & peak of at most 20°F ebove normal during a period
of time approximately 10 sec, while the outlet temperature drops suto=
matically to its new value.

These two limiting cases ghow that there is no failure of a single
heat transfer path that can cause an excessive temperature rise in the
reactor,

9.3. "An Instantaneous Reduction of the Heat Flow Rate from the Reactor Core

If. a fuel pump should suddenly stop, the rate of heat removal from the
core would be quickly reduced to a fraction of that at full power. The heat
removed would be determined by thermal insulation losses, by thermal convec-
tion through the core fuel circuits, and by heat transfer to the blanket
through the core vessel wall. The latter would be very significant if the
blanket pump remained operative. During the first few seconds following a
sudden fuel pump failure, forced circulation in the core circuits would per-
gist as a result of inertial effects but at a rapidly declining rate. The
sharply decreased circulation rate would result in a larger fraction of the

delayed neutrons being released in the reactor core.

A limiting approximation of the effects of fuel pump stopping was studied
on the simulator. In the simulator studies, it was postulated that during
steady-state full-power operation, the heat removal was reduced instantaneously
to a small fraction of full power. It was further postulated that the flow of
fuel stopped instantaneously so that the fuel salt that was in the reactor
stayed there. The peak temperatures which could be achieved if these condi-
tions could be met and the times to reach them are given in Fig. 1.13 as
functions of the reduced heat removal rate. The temperature rise indicated
results from the continued fission power generation at subcritical conditions
from the gradual decay rate for the neutron flux and does not take into account
afterheat from fission product radioactive decay, which acts as an additional

heat source.

The curves in Fig. 1.13 should be used with caution; they are intended
only to set upper limits on the temperature rise. The coasting effect from
the fuel's inertia and thermal-convection circulation will reduce the peak
temperatures markedly, but the relationships are complex and a more extended
andlysis is necessary. The peak temperatures are not a problem of themselves,
but their sudden appearance will cause thermal strains. The magnitudes of
these strains and their effects on the integrity of the reactor requires

analysis, but no serious consequences are expected.

9.k. Cold Fuel Slugging
If cold fuel is suddenly injected into the reactor core  vhen the
power level is very low, the core may become supercritical on a fast
period, This can lead to the power density exceeding the design level
before the mean core temperature rises again to ite normal. operating
range. Two simulstor cases were run to see whether these higher than
design level: power densities could lead to a serious temperature over-
shoot in the: reactor. TL
One case ‘considered involved suddenly increasing the power demand
at the boiler from 6 Mw to 600 Mw. The immediate effect is: to Tower the
core inlet aiperature to about 1000° Fe. The average aore ‘temperature 1s
reduced to about: 1050° Fy The temperatures then rise asymptotically to
normal operating levels with overshoot at most of a few degrees. ‘The
power: level overshoots to about 900 Mw, but the overshoot in power has
no practical significance. A sudden load increase at the boiler of this
‘magnitude is impractical to obtain, so that this is a limiting case in
50 far as a sudden application of load is concerned, It must be goncluded
~ that "eold fuel slugging" es a result of load manipulation cannot lead
to any difficulty :

A second case was get w , in an attempt to — stoppage of fuel
flow, cooling of the fuel in the heéat exchangers to just above its melting '
_ poi, and then starting flow to. put a slug of very cold fuel in the |

reactor, In the starting condition of the simulator study, the reactor

Was subcritical at a temperature greater than 1200°F, As the Plow vas

rate, a step-wise increase in the reactivity of 0 Af vas artifically -
inserted to place the reactor in a positive period. This insertion of a
positive period was intended to replace & condition of starting at very
low power, since the scaling limits of the simulator do not permit the
introduction of initial power levels of less than 5 Mw. Under the simu-
lator conditions used, the reactor core. temperature again dropped about
150°F and then rose “asymptotically to the design temperature with n6.

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

perceptible overshoot. It is concluded that a fuel pump starting up
with cold fuel in the primary heat exchangers is unlikely to lead to
high temperature excursions in the reactor.

- 9. 5. Removal. of Afterhest by Thermal Convection

A survey exemination of the capability of the heat transfer system
for the removal of heat by thermal convection in the event that all

| pumping power is lost has been made. The temperature pattern of the

system required for the removal of 4% of the design power by thermal

~~ convection is shown in Fig. 1.14, This study shows in a preliminary way
that thermal convection can remove enough heat from the reactor core so

that loss of power to the pumps in the radioactive areas will not neces=~

’ gitate the drainage of the fuel from the reactor. A detailed system

analysis may indicate thet slight ‘modifications in layout may b: required
to accomplish this, however.

9,6. loss of Fuel Pump

Any event vhich stops the forced, circulation of fuel ihrough the
primary heat exchangers requires that steps be taken to prevent freezing
of the fuel salt, The steam system is such a large, relatively low tem-
perature heat sink that the fuel salt would be quickly frozer if no action
were taken, There are two safety controls. First, fuel pump stoppage
or loss of power will cut the steam to the turbine, end reduce the turbine
output to a low level to handle afterhest, ete. The second control,

the condenser. Simultaneously, or as soon as practical, secondary sodium
pump speeds will be reduced and valves controlling sodium flow to the
boiler, superheater, and reheater and in the bypass will adjust automati- -
“cally to give design temperatures and pressures for the emount of after=-
heating being removed from the reactor. If this idling power exceeds

the power required to operate the plant it will be dumped to the condenser.

The whole plent will be maintained in a condition ready to resume
its electrical load as soon as it cen be re-esteblished. It is to be
noted that should the load loss be sufficiently prolonged so that the
‘afterheat is not sufficient to provide power for local needs, the core
will generate fission heet automatically. In order to maintain the power
station in a standby condition during a period in which, sey, the elec~
tric generator equipment is inoperative and there 1s a simulteneous loss
of power to the plant, emergency rover generation equipment will be
needed. The emergency supply must have sufficient capacity to operate
instruments 3 controls ’ feedwater pumps end ele equipment necessary
for control and removal of afterheat.

9.8. ‘leak Between Fuel and ‘Blanket Salts

~ The free surface of the blanket salt is above the free surface of
the fuel salt, and the blanket salt is more dense then the fuel salt,
Both the core and the blanket will have e common ges pressure over them,
and both are on the suction side of the “pumps in their respective systems.
Under these conditions the blanket will ‘always be at’ & higher static pres~
sure ‘then the core, ‘and any lesk between the fuel and ‘blanket salts will
drive “the ‘blenket salt into ‘the fuel salt and dover the critical tempera-
ture of the reactor core.

With such a , leak the nadntenance of systen temperatures would re-
quire addition of fuel at a rate in excess of that required for burnup
end fission product poisoning. To maintain the critical temperature
constant in a clean, B-ft-dia core with a fuel selt ‘containing 0.75 mole %
thorium, about one atom of 2% must be added for three atoms of thorium,

- 55 =

 
 

 

 

that leak into the core from the blenket. Thus, if the fuel accountea~-
bility is sufficiently sensitive to detect a 10% excess fueling rate,
inleakage to the core of more than 165 cm? per day will be detected.

The fuel end blenket salts are chemicelly inert with respect to each
other, and therefore no chemical effects of the mixing are expected.

If fissionproduct and heevy=-element poisoning were to mask the excess
refueling caused by & blanket leak and prevent early detection, the leek
would be detected eventually by corresponding changes in fuel and blenket
inventories, as indicated by the level indicators of the respective
systems. oo

Once a leak between the core and blanket was detected, the reactor
would be shut down and all liquid systems would be.drained. Replacement
of the reactor vessel would be required, and this would be ea lengthy
operation.

Complete rupture of the core vessel would lead automatically to &a-
subcritical condition. The core surge tank would fill as the blanket
and core pressures tended to equalize.

9.9. leak Between Fuel and Sodium

 

The relative pressures in the fuel end sodium systems will always
be such that, in the event of a leak between the fuel and the sodium,
the fuel will enter the sodium stream. This arrangement is used because
the consequences of precipitation of uranium in the circulating fuel
system cannot be predicted with certainty.

The chemical consequences of a leak of the fuel into sodium, such
as could occur in & primary heat exchanger, have been examingd on the
basis of thermodynamic dats.’> When the fuel is mixed with excess sodium,
the major constituents, except LiF, will be promptly and simultaneously
reduced to their metallic states, according to the reactions:

Of the fission products contained in the fuel, the elkaline earths, the
rare earths, and a considerable fraction of the alkali metals will remain
in the salt phase as fluorides, while Ho, Ru, Zr, C4, Zn, Sb, and Sn will
be reduced to the metallic state.

The anions, particularly 3 7 and mol, which are important for
neutron detection because they are long-lived precursors of delayed neu.
tron emitters, will appear as halide ions. Accordingly, the salt mixture, »
after reaction, will contain about 5% mole % NaF, 46 mole % LiF, and traces
(insofar as concentration is concerned) of fission product fluorides.
Such & mixture will have a melting point greater, probably, than 700°¢.
(1300°F), and accordingly will be solid at the normal temperstures in the
sodium circuit. -

Metals such as Sn, Sb, Cd, Rb, Cs, and Zn should be soluble in molten
sodium, but all other materials introduced into the sodium by the fuel
are moderately high melting and will be sparingly soluble in the sodium.
Beryllium metal, which is present in relatively large concentrations and
which appears to be relatively insoluble (< 100 ppm) in sodium, will |
probably be the first material precipitated. Sodium fluoride probebly
dissolves to ‘the extent of 0.2 mole % in sodium at 1100° ’F, and this salt,
along with LiF, will exceed the solubility in molten sodium and exist
as separate ‘solid phases after relatively small quantities ‘of fuel have
leaked into the sodium, - :

Sodium iodide and sodium bromide are more soluble than sodium fluo~-
ride in molten sodium, and these precursors of the delayed neutron emitters

will, ‘accordingly, be dissolved in the molten sodium until the NeF-IiF
mixture saturates the sodium end forms & second phase. Since they are

«oT -

 
 

 

 

more soluble in the salt phase than in the liquid metal they could, in
principle, then decrease in concentration in the molten metal due to their
extraction into the solid salt phase. This extraction process is not
expected to be important s however, since the amount of solid salt phase
will be small for a considerable.period, and extraction by a solid from

a liquid should be relatively slow. Furthermore s Precursors of delsyed
neutrons present in the sodium arise- only from the freshly leaked-in fuel,
and therefore the concentration of precursors will not be appreciably
affected even though the total atomic species concentration may be dimin-
ished by extractions,

Prompt detection of small fuel leaks into the primary sodium cir-
cuit poses a problem yet to be solved. Al om 3 aay leak will produce
approximately 0.5 n/ cn’ e sec by precursor decay at the secondary heat
exchanger, but it is doubtful that neutrons of such a source strength
can be detected in the sodium cell. Likewise the neutron activation of
the primary sodium produces gamma-ray activity which would tend to mask
fission fragment gemma activity. Detection of large leaks would be aided
by comparison with the activity in the other similar secondary sodium
circuits, but the determination of the size of leak that can be detected
has not as yet been made. i.

A welle~agitated stoichiometric mixture of sodium and fuel salt will
result in a rapid temperature rise, estimated to be 1200°F under adiabatic
conditions. It is difficult , however, for such conditions to exist in
a practical situation. Heat evolved from a small leak would ‘be rapidly
carried away by excess sodium. For the larger leaks which could occur
from fatigue in bending or tension, the solids formed would interfere
with rapid mixing. Some work has been done with a NaF), base fuel and
NeX which demonstrated this smothering effect; further engineering tests

~ will be required to demonstrate safety with sodium and the present fuel
salt in simulated component equipment.

- 58 -
 

 

 

As soon as a fuel to sodium leak hed been detected end the faulty
heat exchenger haf thus been located, the reactor plent would be shut
down, the fuel and appropriate sodium eircuits drained, end the heat
exchanger replaced.

19.10. Leak of Fuel or Blanket Salt to Reactor Cell

The presence of a small leak from the fuel to the reactor cell can
be detected by gas«sampling techniques. Its location will be more dif-
ficult to determine. The repair of such a leak would of course require
draining the fuel salt. The provision of an inert atmosphere in the
reactor cell will prevent rapid growth of leaks caused by salt-fluxed
oxidation. Co oo

A gross leak or rupture of elther the fuel or blanket circuits is
a major accident. Means must be provided to vent reactor cell pressure
as it is bullt up by heat release from the spilled salt, and & suitsble

time basis must be available. Ways are known for doing both, but the
lowest cost way of accomplishing these disaster prevemtgidve wteps has not.

9,11, Ieaks of Water or Steam to Sodium

The sodium in thermal contact with the water or steam is nonradio-
active. The problem of leaks between the water and sodium systems has

10. CHEMICAL PROCESSING AND FUEL CYCLE ECONOMICS

10,1, Fuel Salt Reprocessing

The system for chemical reprocessing of the fuel salt is ‘& combina- ¢
tion of the ORNL fluoride volatility and the K-25 uranium hexafluoride
reduction processes described in Part 6. The salt to be reprocessed is /
transferred, as described in Section 3, above, from the reactor circuit
to & holdup vessel on a convenient schedule, such as 2 £47 once each day
or 12 £19 once each week. The holdup vessels provide containment during
the holdup period required for decay of the short-lived activities and
act as a buffer between the reactor end the chemical plant so that the
operation of the reactor need not depend on the state of repalr of the
chemical plant. | |

 

The fuel salt will be fluorinated in batches of 2 £42 each, one

batch per day. After the uranium is removed by fluorination and collected .
as UFg on NaF pellet beds, the barren salt is transferred to waste storage.
The UF, will be discharged on a twice~per-week cycle from the NaF pellet
beds, which have a capacity of 10 kg of uranium. The volatility process
produces liquid UF s in cylinders, which is subsequently fed to a reduc~
tion tower to produce UF), 5 which is combined with fresh salt for return

to the reactor. The uranium losses in the chemical processing are about
0.1%, i.e., about 1 kg/year.

10.2. Blanket Salt Reprocessing

Chemical processing of the blanket salt is physically much the same
as the processing of the fuel salt except that, after fluorination, the
salt is returned to the blanket system. Because of the much lower power
density in the blenket salt, holdup for decay-cooling is not a problem.
Separate fluorinators for fuel and blanket salts, to prevent cross-
contemination, are assumed, as are separate NaF beds, to make possible
the withdrewal of pure #3 from the system if desired. The same UFg
reduction tower will serve both fuel and blenket salt processing.

- 60 -
 

 

 

A blanket selt processing rate that is about the same as that for
the fuel salt is assumed, i.e., one 2 £17 batch per day. Thus fluorina-
tion equipment of the same size wlll suffice. The uranium throughput

‘rate of the blanket salt processing system is, however, only about 10%

of that of the fuel salt. For convenience, the same size of NaF bed is
proposed for the two systems, elthough this meens that the UF will be
discharged from the NaF bed in the blanket salt system only once every
other month,

The blanket selt processing rate is sufficiently fast to hold the.
2 5 inventory in the blenket salt system to ebout 60 kg and to limit the
fissioning in the blanket salt to about 3% of the total.

10.3. Cost Bases

Fissionable isotopes have been valued at $17/¢ in computing inven
tory and burnup charges and breeding and resale credits. Capitalization
rates were assumed to be 4%/yr on fissioneble materiels and 14%/yr on
everything else. The fuel salt was estimated to cost $1278/1t° end the -
blanket salt $2517/£t° . The variable cost of fuel salt chemical process
sing is assumed to be equal to the cost of buying new salt to replace
that processed. The blanket salt is used over the life of the reactor
without excessive fission product buildup.

The fissionable material comsumption cost is based on feeding 93%
enriched a > to the core system to compensate for a regeneration ratio
of less then wiity. It is assumed that U"> is not eveilsble for purchase
at eaonmml.e plus, although it would be worth approximately twice as
much as #5 in" ‘an intermediate-neutron-energy molten-selt reactor due
to its ‘higher regeneration ratio at lower critical inventories. - It is
assumed also ‘that Asotopic re-enrichment of 2 5 or *? 2 '¢ €lther by
gaseous diffusion or by exchange with & price penalty, is not economical,
s0 that ‘the molten-salt power reactor must ‘tolerate the nonfigsionable

uranium isotopes and. the resulting lower regeneration retio and higher
a Lo inventory. i oC

 
 

 

 

10.4, Chemical Plant Capital Costs

The budgeted capital costs for the ORNL volatility pilot plant total
about $1,300,000 through fiscal 1959. This figure includes replacements
and modifications » which should not be required in & second plent, and
it also includes solid fuel element handling and dissolution facilities,
which would not be required in the molten~salt reactor plant. On the
other hand, the $1,300,000 does not include building and service facili-
ties, or any equipment for reducing UF to UR, and reconstituting fuel
salt. Additions and subtractions considered, the reference design
chemical plant equipment snd installation cost 1s estimated to be $1, 500, 000.
The chemical plent's share of the total reactor capital investment is
about twice this amount, when charges for building and site, design, general
expense, end contingencies are added. These capital costs are listed
with other capital costs in Section 11.

10.5. Chemical Plant Operating Costs

The ORNL volatility plant operating budget for three fiscal years
(1957-58-59) totals $1,368,000. The molten-salt reactor chemical plant
would have lower "unusual" costs (associated with development) than the
pilot plent, but higher "production-proportional"” costs, and is estimated
to cost $500,000 per year to operate. To this must be added the cost
of replacing the fuel salt processed, or reclaiming it, if this can be
done for au equal or lesser cost. This is estimated to be 600 £2 (ap-
proximately one fuel system volume) per year at $1278 per £87 , a total
of $770,000 per year. A salt reclamation process might be expected to
reduce this considerably, although probably not more than by a factor
of 2, which nevertheless would save about 0.2 mills/kwh. The chemical
plant operating costs are listed with other operating costs in Section
11.

10.6, Net Fuel Cycle Cost

For the purpose of estimating fuel cycle costs, values averaged over
the ‘reactor lifetime of 1000 kg for the Pd 3 SFP inventory and 0.5 for
the effective breeding ratio were assumed. The nuclear heat power was

- 62 =
 

 

 

teken to be 640 Mv, the net electrical output 260 Mw, and the load factor
0.80. The net fuel cyele cost is estimated to be about 2 mills/kwh:

If & comparison of total fuel cycle costs with those for & solid fuel
element power reactor are to be made, the chemical plant capital cost
end the chemical plant operating cost should be added. These amounts
are as follows:

$/yr | mills/kwh
Capital cost ($3,000,000) 420,000 0.23
Operating cost 500,000 0.28

They lead to a total fuel cycle cost of 2.54 mills/kwh.

11. CONSTRUCTION AND POWER COSTS

11.1, Gapital Costs

The information available in the preliminary design does not lend
itself to a rigorous cost analysis; however, the power cycle has been
sufficiently well-defined to permit a segregation of the major compos
- ‘nents in the ‘pleat. The ‘plant layout has progressed to the extent that
the over-all size. may be determined. cn

Design studies of some of the fuel system euxiliaries have + permitted
a detailed cost breakdown. ~The high-temperature sodium pump requirements
have been ascertained to the extent that manufacturers of this equipment
have been sable to make preliminary cost estimates. The fuel and blanket
salt pumps were estimated by scaling up costs of smeller pumps that have
been febricated and tested at ORNL for hightemperature reactor systems.

- 63 -

 
 

 

ORNL's experience in molten~salt and alkali metal heat transfer
equipment fabrication and procurement has been dram on to estimate the
increased cost in producing reactor-quality products.

In some cases individual ‘components were found to be too mumerous
for detailed cost analysis in the time available, and costs were assigned
to entire subsystems on the basis of general experience. ‘The instrumen-
tation, electrical equipment, and auxiliery systems were treated in this
monner, for exemple.

It has been assumed that the molten-salt reactor plant would be con-
structed at a site similar to the one selected in a recent. ORNL gas=-cooled
reactor study. 13 Therefore » site acquisition, improvement s and structure
costs have been set at comparable levels. | |

"The capital cost summary is presented in Table 1.6. It should be
noted that a 40% contingency factor has been epplied to the reactor por=-
tion of the system. It is felt that there are a number of uncertainties
in some of the larger reactor cost packages and a contingency factor of
this order is warrented. A 7.5% contingency factor was applied to the
remainder of the direct costs.

The general expense or indirect cogts charged to the plant represent
administrative, personnel, plant protection, safety and special construc-
tion services which ere largely incurred during construction and startup
operations. The design cost represents approximately 5% of the direct
cost subtotal before the contingency factors were applied. This capital
cost summary leads to a cost of $269 per installed killowatt of generating

capacity. | ;

11.2. Power Costs

Power costs have been divided into three categories. These are:
fixed costs, operation and maintenance costs, end fuel cycle costs.
The fixed costs ere the charges resulting from the capital investment
in the plent. This amount has been set at 14% per annum of the invest
ment, which includes taxes, insurence, and financing charges. This leads
to an annual charge of $9,776,000 or 5.37 mills/kwh. :

The operation and maintenance costs are, in the main, dependent on
the ultimate reliability of the reactor portion of the plant. The de=
velopment of practical remote-maintenance technigues for the repair and
replacement of equipment in the radioactive systems 1s also vital to
assure reasonable costs. No accurate determination of such costs cen
be made without further experience.

For the purpose of this report the operation and maintenance cost
breekdowvn given below has been assumed:

Annual Charge -

 

Labor and supervision $ 900,000

Reactor system spare parts |
Pumps 250,000
Heat exchangers 200,000
Miscellaneous. 300 ,000
Remote~hendling equipment 150,000
Chemicel plant operation 500,000
Conventional supplies 400,000
Total $2,700,000

This total cost results in an incremental power cost of 1.48 mills/kwh.
Net fuel cycle costs as discussed in Sec. 10 sbove amount to 2.03 mills/kwh.
 

 

 

The three categories add up as follows: -

 

Annuel Cherge mills/kwh
Fixed cost : $ 9,766,000 237
Operating end maintenance 2,700,000 - 1.48
Fuel charges 3,710,000 2.03
Total annual charge $16,176,000
Total power cost 8.88

The difference in cost between having the reactor plant on standby and
having it on the line is about 2 mills/kwh.

12, SOME ALTERNATES TO THE PROPOSED DESIGN

12.1. Alternate Heat Transfer Systems

The possibility of replacing the fuel-to-sodium-to-sodium-to-steam
heat transfer system with a fuel-to-gas-to-steam system has been given
a cursory exemination. The attractiveness of such a system is based on
the replacement of two sodium systems in series with one gas system and
in having the gas chemically compatible with both the fuel and water or
steam. Early estimates of the gas heat transfer performance indicate
that the fuel volume required to transfer an equivalent quantity of heat
would not be appreciably different from that required with the sodium
system. These estimates were based on use of & return gas temperature
below the melting point of the fuel, and the safety of this procedure

"must be examined further. If the gas system were operated in the 300-
to 400-ps1 range, the power required to circulate the gas eould:be kept at

a reasonsble level.

The gas system would permit & reduction in the number of heat ex-

‘chengers end pumps , and eliminate sodium valves. The dew point of the

ges would provide & repid method of leek detection in case of a steam-
to=gas leek. A steam leek into the gas system would not have the chemical
hazard that exists with a steem~to-sodium leak. If the reactor were

- 69 -

 
 

 

operated inside a pressure shell, the fuel pressure could be maintained
slightly below the gas pressure to ensure that any leeks in the fuel
system would be inward. The small pressure differentiel required between
the fuel snd the gas would permit the maximum fuel (gage) pressure to

be maintained at a level no higher than that required by the liquid-cooled

system.

Gas cooling would eliminate the need for the sodium handling systems
with their attendant preheating problems, These sodium facilities would
be replaced with gas storage and handling equipment. Startup and shut-
down procedures would be simpler with ges then with liquid cooling, par-
ticularly with respect to preheating end part load control, The smount
of secondary radiation shielding required with the liquid system would
be considerably reduced with the gas system because of the decreased ine
duced activity of the coolant.

More studies of the gas cooling system are being made, and it is
apparent that the bulkiness of the gas system will present handicaps.
It is also probable that a gas cooling system will prove more expensive,
A better comparison of the gas~cooled system with the sodium~cooled
system will result from & more detalled design study.

An alternate to the steam-cycle described above would be the
Loeffler boiler cycle. In this system (see Fig. 1.15) all the heat is
transferred to the steam in the superheater. A portion of the superheated
steam is recirculated by means of a steam pump to the boiler, where it
transfers heat to the water by direct contact to form saturated steam.
With the same steam conditions of 1000°F and 1800 psi, it would be neces-
sary to return approximately 2 1b of steam to the boiler for every pound
sent to the turbine. The advantages of this system used in conjunction
with the molten-salt reactor are principally connected with the control
of heat flow. With the sodium-to-steam generator heat transfer system,
the steam generator represents a large capacity heat sink at a tempera-
ture more then 200°F below the freezing point of the fuel bearing salt.
To prevent freezing of the fuel, careful control of flow in the secondary

godium circuit must be maintained at low power operation. In the
loeffler boiler eystem, the directly coupled heat sink is dry steam in-
‘stead of water, end control of the steam circulation is believed to be
easier then the control of the sodium flow. The elimination of the need
for two speed pumps and control velves in the intermediate circuit would
therefore result in a system that would more fully exploit the inherent
self-regulation of the molten-salt reactor. |

The elimination of the steam generator from & sodium circuit reduces
the need for sodium flow regulation. The reduction of sodium equipment
probebly would result in less frequent maintenance, Thus some of the
serious objections to having radioactive sodium heating the steam would
thereby be lessened and consideration could be given to the elimination
of one of the intermediate circuits. In addition, since minimum tempere-
tures would, at design point operation, be above the melting point of
sultable fluoride salts, their use in place of sodium should be exemined.
If substitution could be made, chemical compatibility of the intermediate
fluid would be markedly improved both with respect to the fuel and the
steam and these hazards would be lessened.

More detailed design comparisons will be necessary to evaluate this
boiler system. Although the changes suggested above are plausible, the
detailed consequences must be analyzed and falr cost comparisons made.

12.2. Alternate Fuels

 

The substitution of 4 5 for #2 ? in the molten fluoride reactors
would result in substantial improvement in performance. Uranium-233 is
a superior fuel in almost every respect. The fission cross section in
the intermediate range of neutron energies is greater than the fission
cross sections of *? 2 and Pu) 9, Thus, initiel inventories are less,
end less additional fuel is required to over-ride poisons. Also, the
n~y cross section is substantially less, and the radiestive capture
results in the immediate formation of a fertile isotope, PH + The rate
of accumulation of al is orders of magnitude smaller than with a4 5
fuel, end the buildup of Np>2! end Po” is negligible.

~ actors fueled with UP) eve given in Part 4, Sec. 1.2. In a typical

case in which the core diameter wae 8 ft and the aoncentration of ThF) -
wes 1,0 mole %, the initial critical mass was found to be only 87 kg of

3, the inventory for a 600-Mw system was only 196 kg, the regeneration

ratio was O, 91, end the long-term performance was good. In another B«fie
dia core system with 0.75 mole % ThF) in the fuel salt, the initiel ine
ventory was 129 kg, and the conversion ratio was 0.82, After operation
for one year at «a load factor of 0.8 and with no reprocessing of the core

} to remove fission products, the inventory rose of 199 kg, and the regene

eration ratio fell do 0.71. However, if the reprocessing required to
hold the concentration of fission products constant was started efter 1
year of operation, the inventory increased slowly up to only 247 kg
after 19 years and the regeneration ratio rose slightly to 0.73. Roughly
speaking, the critical inventories required for the #2 systems ere
ebout one-third those for the corresponding #2 5 systems, and the burnup

‘requirements are about helf.

The ebove described case 1s not optimized for 3, Substantial
improvement can be obtained by using higher concentrations of thorium
end correctly matching the diameter and processing rates.

- As discussed in Part 2, PuF, has eppreciable solubility in mixtures
of LiF and BeFye It should be possible to maintein concentrations of
up to 0.2 mole % safely. - This is more than ample for clean systems
having diemeters in the range from 6 to 10 £5 with no thorium in the core.
A typical 8-ft-dia core would have a critical concentration of 0.013
mole % PuF; end e regeneration ratio (ThE), in the blazket) of about 0.35.
The effect of accumulation of fission products end Pu on the critical
concentration and the effect of rare earth fission products on the solu~

bility of PuF; remain to be determined. It does appear probable, however,

that & molten fluoride plutonium burner having unlimited burnup end

exhibiting substantial Pegeneyeiion in the blanket is technically feasible,

PART 2
CHEMICAL ASPECTS OF MOLTEN=-FLUORIDE=SALT REACTOR FUELS

1. CHOICE OF FUEL COMPOSITION

The search for a liquid for use &t high temperstures and low pres-
sures in a fluld-fueled reactor led to the choice of either fluorides
or chlorides because of the requirements of radiation stability end solu~
bility of appreciable quantities of uranium end thorium. The chlorides
(based on the aT isotope) are most suitable for fest reactor use, but
the low thermal-neutron ebsorption cross section of fluorine mekes ‘the
fluorides seem to be & uniquely desireble choice for e high-temperature
fluid-fueled reactor in the thermal- or epithermal-neutron reglon.

1.1, Choice of Active Fluoride

Uranium Fluoride. Uranium hexafluoride 1s a highly volatile com-
pound, and it is obviously unsuiteble as & componént of & liguid for use
at high temperatures. The compound UO, F, 2? vhich is relatively nonvolatile,
1s a strong oxidant that would be very difficult to contein. Fluorides
of pentavalent uranium (UF, UpFgs ete.) exe not thermally eteble™ end.
would be prohibitively strong oxidants even if they could be stebilized
in solution. Uranium trifluoride, when pure and under an inert atmosphere,
is stable even at temperatures above 1000°¢; 22 3 however, it is not so
stable in molten fluoride solutions. It disproportionates eppreciebly

in such media by the reaction,

at temperatures below 800°C, Small mounts of UF, are ‘permissible in
the presence of relatively large concentrations of UF), and may be benee
ficial insofar es corrosion is concerned. It 1s necessary, Bovever, to.
use UF), as the major ureniferous compound in the fuel.

Thoriun Fluoride. All the normal compounds of thorium gre quadri-
valent; accordingly, eny use of thorium in molten fluoride melts must
be as ThF), .

1.2. Choice of Fuel Diluents

The fluoride compositions that will be discussed here are limited
to those which have & low vepor pressure at 700° C end which have & melting
point no higher then 550°C, Also, there is ‘little interest in uranium

concentrations higher then a Tew per cent for the fuel of thermal reactors,

and therefore mixtures with high UF), content will be omitted from this
discussion. : :

Of the pure fluorides of molben-salt reactor interest, only BeF,
meets the melting point requirement, and it is too viscous for use in
the pure state. Thus the fluorides of interest are ternary or quaternary
mixtures containing UF, or ThF,. For the fuel, the relatively small
amounts of UF), required make the corresponding binaxy or teinsyy. mixtures -
of the diluents nearly controlling with regard to physical properties .
such as the melting point, Only the alkalisietel fluorides end the fluo-
rides of beryllium end zirconium have been given serious attention. Iead
and bismuth fluorides, which might otherwise be useful because of their
low neutron absorption, have been eliminated because they are readily |
reduced to the metallic state by structural metals such es iron end
chromtun, ‘

2.1. Purification Equipment

A schematic diagram of the purification and storage vessels used
for preparation of the ARE fuel is shown in Fig. 2.13. The reaction
vessel, in which the chemical processing is accomplished, end the re-
celver vessel, into which the purified mixture is ultimately transferred,
are vertical cylindrical containers of A-nickel. The top of the reactor
vessel is plerced by a charging port which is capped well sbove the heated
zone by a Teflon-gasketed flange. The tops of both the receiver and the
reaction vessels ere plerced by short risers which terminate in Swagelok
fittings, through which gas lines, thermowells, etc., can be introduced.
A trensfer line terminetes neer the bottom of the reactor vessel and near
the top of the receiver; entry of this tube is effected through eopper-
gasketed flanges on l-in.-dia tubes which plerce ‘the tops ‘of both vessels.
This transfer line conteins & filter of micrametallic sintered nickel
and a sampler vhich collects a specimen of liquid during trensfer. Through
one of the risers in the ‘receiver & tube extends to the receiver bottom;
this tube, s which is sealed outside ‘the vessel, serves as the meens for

3. PHYSICAL AND THERMAL PROPERTIES

The melting points, heat capacities, end equations for density end
viscosity of & range of molten mixtures of possible interest as reactor
fuels are presented in Teble 2.1, and thermal~conductivity values are
given in Table 2,2,

The temperatures above vhich the materiels are completely in the }
liquid state were determined in phase equilibrium studies, The methods
used included (1) theamal emalysis, (2) differential ~thermal enalysis,

( 3) quenching from hightemperature equilibrium states, (4) visual obser-
vation of the’ melting process, and (5) phase separation by filtration

at high temperatures, Measurements of density vere made by weighing,
with’ an analytical valance, a plumet suspended in the molten mixture.
Enthalples, heats of fusion, and heat capacities were determined from :

‘measurements of heat liberated when samples in capsules of Ni or Inconel

were dropped from various bemperatures into calorimeters; both ice calo~
rimeters and Large eoppertloc calorimeters were used. Measurements

Thermal conductivities of the molten mixtures were measured in an
‘apparatus similar to that described by Lucks and Deem,S in which the

"fluoride mixtures were measured by use of a steady-state technique i
which heat was passed through a solid slab.

The vepor pressures of PuF; (ref. 9), UF, (ref. 10), and ThE, are
- negligibly small at temperstures that are likely to be practical for
reactor operations. Of the fluoride mixtures likely to be of interest
as diluents for high-temperature reactor fuels, , only ALF Fs BeF, (ref.

described by Rodebush and Dixon 15 yielded the date shown in Table 2.3.
Sense et a1,,8 vho used a transport method to evaluate partial pressures
in the NaF-Zr¥), system, obtained slightly different values for the vepor

~ pressures and showed that the vapor phase above these liquids is quite

complex. The vapor=pressure values obtained from both investigations

are less than 2 mm Hg for the equimolar NaFeZrF), mixture at 700%¢, Howe
ever, since the vapor is nearly pure ZF), end since ZrF, does not melt
under low pressures of its vapor, even this modest vapor pressure leads

to engineering difficulties; all lines, equipment, and connections exposed
to the vepor must be protected from sublimed ZrF) "snow."

Measurements made with the Rodebush epparatus have shown thet the
vapor pressure above liquids of gnalogous composition decreases with
increasing size of the alkali cation. All these systems show large
negative deviations from Reoult's lew, which ere & consequence of the
large, positive, excess, partislemolar entroples of solution of ZF.
This phenomenon has been interpreted qualitatively as an effect of sub-
stituting nonbridging fluoride ions for fluoride bridges between zirconium
ions as the alkali fluoride concentration is increased in the melt, 17

be — STABILITY

When fission of an active constituent occurs in & molten fluoride
solution, both electromagnetic radiations and particles of very high
energy and intensity originate within the fluid. Local overheating as’ oo
e consequence of rapid slowing down of fission fraghents by the. fluid |
is probably of little consequence in a reactor where the liquid is forced

to flow turbulently and where rapid and intimate mixing occurs. Moreover,

the bonding in such liquids is essentially completely ionic. Such e solu~
tion, which hes ‘neither covalent bonds to sever nor & lattice to alsrupt,
should be quite resistant to demage by particulate ¢ or electrampguetic Co
radistion,

More then 100 exposures to reactor redietion of various fluoride
mixtures containing UF), in cépsules of Inconel have been conducted; =
these tests the fluid was not deliberately agitated, The power level -
~ of each test was fixed by. selecting the Rd content of. the test mtciure.
Thermal neutron fluxes have ranged from 10+ RT ot neutrons/ a gee
and power levels have veried from 80 to 8000 fe’ . . The capsules have;
in general, been exposed at 1500° F for 300 ‘hr, ‘although several tests Co
‘have been conducted for 600 to 800 br. A list of the msteriels thet have

PART 3

CONSTRUCTION MATERIALS FOR MOLTEN-SALT REACTORS
1. SURVEY OF SUITABLE MATERIALS
A molten~salt reactor system requires structural materials which will

resist corrosion by the salts, and evaluation tests of verious materiels
in fluoride selt mixtures have indicated that nickel-base alloys are, in

‘general, superior to other commercial alloys for the containment of these

salts under dynamic flow conditions. In order to select the alloy best
suited to this epplication, en extensive program of corrosion tests was

carried out on the avellable, commerciel, nickel-base alloys, particularly,

Inconel, which typifies the chromivm-containing slloys, end Hastelloy B,
which is representative of the molybdenum-containing alloys. -

Alloys containing apprecieble quantities of chromium are attacked
by molten salts mainly by the removel of chromium from hot-leg sections
through reaction with UE, if present, end with other oxidizing impurities |
in the salt. The removal of chromium is accompanied by the formation of

- subsurface voids in the metal. The depth of void formation depends strongly

on the operating temperatures of the system end on the composition of the
salt mixture. co

On the other hend. mastelloy B, in vhich the chromium 1s replaced with

molybdenum, shows. excellent competibility with fluoride salts even at tem-

peratures. in excess of 1600°F. ‘Unfortunately, Bastelloy B cammot. ve- used

as & ‘structural material in high-temperature systems because of its age-

hardening characteristics and. its poor oxidation resistance.

The information gained in “the testing of Bastelloy B and. Inconel led
to the development of an alloy, designated INOR-8, which combines: the

better. properties o of both alloys for molten~salt reactor construction.
‘The approximate: compositions of the three elloys, Inconel, Eastelloy B,

end 'INOR-8, ‘axe gtven in Table 3, 1.

INOR-8 has excellent. corrosion resistance to molten fluoride salts

et temperatures considerably ebove those expected in molten-salt reactor
service; further, no meesureble attack has been observed thus. far in
tests at reactor operating temperatures of 1200 to 1300° F. The mechantcel
properties of INOR-8 at operating temperatures are superlor to those: of
many stainless steels and are virtually unaffected by long=time exposure.
to salts, The materiel is structurally stable in the operating tempera~
ture range, and the oxidation rate is less than 2 mils in 100,000 br,
No difficulty 1s encountered in fabricating standard shapes when the

2. CORROSION ify ALLOYS BY MOLTEN SALTS

, Apparatus Used for Corrosion Tests :

 Nickel-base alloys have been exposed to flowing molten salts in both
thermel-convection loops, and in loops, containing paps for forced circu-
letion of the salts, The thermal=convection loops are. designed, es shown
in Fig. Bale When the bottom end an adjacent side of the. loop are heated,
usually with clamshell beaters, convection forces in the contained fluid
establish flow rates of up to. 8 ft/min, depending on the “temperature aif-

ference between the heated and ‘unhested portions of the loop. The forced-

circuletion loops are designed as shown in Fig. 3. 2. ‘Heat is applied to
the ‘hot leg of this type of loop by direct resistance heeting of the
tubing. Large temperdture differences twp to 300 °F) are obteined by air
cooling ‘of the cold leg.. Reynolds numbérs of up to 10,000 are attainable
with. 1/2-1n, -ID tubing, end somewhat higher values. can Se ohtained with
smaller tubing. )

2. 2. Mecheriiem of Corrosion

Most of the data on corrosion ‘have been obtained with Incont, and
the theory of the corrosive mechanism was worked out. for this alloy.
The corrosion of INOR-8 occurs to a lesser degree but follows a pattern

The fomation of subsurface voids is initiated vy the oxidation of

tially monodirectional, it is possible to build up en excess mumber of
vacancies in the metal. These precipitate in aress of disregistry, prin-
cipally at grain boundaries end impurities, to form voids. These voids
tend to agglomerate and &row. in size with increasing time and temperature.
Examinations have demonstrated that the subsurface voids ere not inter-
connected with each other or with the surface. Voids of the seme type
have been found in Inconel efter high-temperature oxidetion tests and |
high-temperature vacuum tests in which chromium was selectively removed.

The selective removal of chromium by & fluoride salt mixture depends
on verious chemicel reactions, for example:
1, Impurities in the melt,

2. Oxide films on the metal surface, |

The ferric fluoride formed by the reaction of Eq. 2 dissolves in the melt

and further attacks the chromium by the reaction of Eg. 1.

The time dependence of void formation in Inconel, as observed both

“in thexmal-convection end forced-circulation systems, indicates that the

attack is initially quite rapid but that 1% “then decreases until a straight.
line relationship exists between depth of void formation end time. This

3 effect cen “be explained in terms of the corrosion’ ‘reactions discussed
above. “The initiel’ repld attack found for ‘both ‘types ‘of loops stems from

the reaction of chromium with impurities in the melt (reactions 1 end 2)
end with. the: UR, constituent of the salt (reaction 3) to esteblish a quasi~
equilibriun mount. of CF, in the salt. At ‘this point attack proceeds

it arises from a different cause, 1s similey to the phenomenon, of temperature-

gradient mass trensfer observed in liquid metal corrosion.

In molten-fluoride salt systems , the driving force for mass transfer
is a result of & temperature dependence of the equilibrium. constent for
the reaction between chromium and UF, (Eqs 3)» If nickel and iron are
considered inert diluents for chromium in Inconel, the process can be
simply described. Under rapid circulation, a uniform concentration of
UF), UF, and Cr¥, is maintained throughout the fluid; the concentrations
must satisfy the equilibrium constant: hy

where N represents the mole fraction and y the > activity coefficient ¢ of
-the indicated component.

Under these steady-state conditions, there exists a temperature ’

+ T, intermediste between the maximum and minimum temperature of the loop,
at which the initial composition of the structural metal is at equilibrium
with the fused salt. Since Ky increases with increasing temperature »

the chromium concentration in the alloy surface is diminished at" tempera-
tures higher then T and is augmented at temperatures lower then T. In
some melts, NeF-LiF-KF-UF), for example, the equilibrium constant of
reaction 3 changes sufficiently with temperature under extreme tempera-
ture conditions to cause precipitation of pure chromium crystals in ‘the
cold zone. In other melts, for exemple, NeF-ZrF) -UF) , the temperature
dependence of the corrosion equilibrium is small, and the equilibrium 1s
satisfied at all useful temperatures without the formation of crystalline
chromium. In the latter systems the rate of chromium removal from the
salt stream at cold-leg regions is dependent on the rate at which chromium
can diffuse into the colde-leg wall. If the chromium concentration gradient
tends to be small, or if the bulk of the cold-leg surface is held at a

- relatively low temperature, the corrosion rate in such systems is almost
negligible,

 
 

 

 

 

 

 

 

+ A , *

Tt is obvious that addition of the equilibrium concentrations of

UF; end CrF, to molten fluorides prior to circulation in Inconel equips

ment would minimize the initiel removal of chromium from the alloy by

reaction (3). (It would not, of course, affect the mass transfer process
which arises as a consequence of the temperature dependence of this re-
action.) Deliberate edditions of these materiels have not been practiced
in routine corrosion tests because (1) the effect at the uranium concen=-
trations normally employed is small, and (2) the experimental and analytical
difficulties Bre considerable. Addition of more then the equilibrium

For ultimate use in reactor systems » however, it may be possible to treat

the fuel material with calculated quantities of metallic chromium to pro-

vide the proper UFy and CrF, ‘concentrations at startup.

According to the theory described sbove, there should be no great
difference in the corrosion found in thermeleconvection loops and in
forced-circulation loops. The dats are in general agreement with this
conclusion as long as the same maximum metel-salt. interface temperature
is present in both types of loop. The results of meny tests with both
types of loop are sumerized in Table 3.2 without distinguishing between
the two types of loop. The maximum bulk temperature of the salt as it
left the heated section of the loop is given. It is known that the actual
metal-salt interface ‘temperature was not greater ‘then 100° F in the loops

with a maximum salt temperature of 1250°F and was between 1600 end 1650°F
for the 2o0p vith a maximum salt “tempereture of 1500° F.

At the temperature of interest in molten-selt reactors, that is,
1250°F, the same trend of relative corroeiveness of the different salts
may exist for Inconel, but the low rates of attack observed in tests pre-
clude a conclusive decision on this point. Similerly, if there is any
preferential effect of the base salts on INOR-8, the small emounts of
attack tend to hide it.

As expected from the theory, the corrosion depends shexrply on the
UF), concentration, Studies of the nuclear properties of molten-selt
power reactors have indicated (see Pert }) that the UF), content of the
fuel will usually be less than 1 mole 4, end therefore the corrosiveness
of salts with higher UF) concentrations, such as those described in
Teble 3.2, will be avoided.

The extreme effect of temperature is also clearly indicated in
Teble 3.2. In general, the corrosion rates are three to six times higher
at 1500°F then at 1250°F. This effect is further emphasized in the photo-
micrographs presented in Figs. 3.3 end 3.4, which offer a comparison of
metallographic specimens of Inconel that were exposed to similar salts
of the NeF-ZrF) -UF), system at 1500° F end at say F. A metallographic
specimen of Inconel thet was exposed at 1250° F to the salt proposed for
fueling of the molten-salt power reactor is shown in Fig. 3.5.

The effect of sodium on the structural materials of interest has
also been extensively studied, since sodium is. proposed for use as the
intermediate heat transfer medium. Corrosion problems inherent in the
utilization of sodium for heat transfer purposes do not involve so much
the deterioration of the metal surfaces as the ‘tendency for components
of the ‘container material to ‘be transported from hot to cold reglons end
“to form Plugs of deposited material in the cold region. As in the case
of the corrosion by the salt mixture, ‘the mass transfer in. sodium
containing systems is extremely. dependent on the maximum system operating
‘temperature. The results of numerous tests indicate that the nickel-base
elloys such as Inconel end TNOR-8, exe satisfactory containers for sodium

3. FABRICATION OF INOR=8

.1l. Casting
Normal melting procedures, such as induction or electric furnace
melting, ere suiteble for preparing INOR-S. Specialized techniques, such

"as melting under vacuum or consumable-electrode melting, have elso been

used without difficulty. Since the major alloying constituents do not
have high vapor pressures end axe relatively inert, melting losses are

. negligible, and thus the specified chemicel composition can be obtained.

through the use of standard melting techniques. Preliminery studies ine
dicate that intricately sheped components can be cast from this material.

3.2. Hot Forging.

The temperature range of forgeebility of INOR-8 is 1800 to 2250°F,

This wide range permits operations such as hammer end press forging with

& minimum number of reheats between passes and substantial reductions
without cracking. The production of hollow shells for the manufacture
of tubing has been accomplished by extruding forged end drilled billets
at 2150°F with gless as a lubricant. Successful extrusions have been
made on commercial presses at extrusion ratios of up to 14:1, Forging
recoveries of up | to > 90% « of the. ngs welght have been reported by one

i vendor. : ~

EEN cold Forming -

In the fully annealed conttion, the auctlity of the alloy ranges

nl between 40 end 50% elongation for a ‘2.1n. ‘gage length. Thus, cold~-forming

Bn ‘operations, such as tube reducing, Tolling, end wire drawing, can be

En accomplished with normal’ production schedules. The effects of cold form-
. ing on “the ultimate tensile strength, yield strength, ‘end elongstion are

shown in Fig. 3.6.

Forgeability studies have shown that variations in the carbon cone
tent have an effect on the cold forming of the alloy. Slight variations
of other components, in general, have no significant effects. The solid
solubility of carbon in the alloy is ebout 0.01%. Cerbon present in
excess of this amount precipitates as discrete particles of (Ni, Mo)¢C
throughout the matrix; the particles dissolve sparingly even at the high
annealing temperature of 2150° F. Thus, cold working of the alloy ceuses
these particles to align in the direction of elongation, and if they are
present in sufficient quantity, they form continuous stringers of carbides.
The lines of weakness caused by the stringers ere sufficient to propagate
longitudinal fractures in tubular products during fabrication. The upper
limit of the carbon content for tubing is sbout 0.10%, and for other pro-
ducts it appears to be greater than 0.20%. The carbon content of the
alloy is controlleble to about 0.02% in the range below 0.10%.

3,4. Welding

The parts of the reactor system are joined by welding, and there-
fore the integrity of the system is in large measure dependent on the
reliability of the welds. During the welding of thick sections, the
material will be subjected to a high degree of restraint, and consequently
both the bese metal and the weld metal mist not be susceptible to cracking,

- embrittlement, or other undesirable features.

~ Extensive tests of weld specimens have been made, The circuler-
groove test s which accurately predicted the weldebility of conventional
materiels “with known welding - characteristics, was found to give relieble

ER results for nickel=base ‘alloys. ‘In the circular-groove test, an inert-
rT gas-shielded ‘tungsten-arc weld pass is made by fusion welding (i.e., the
- weld metal contains. no filler metal) in a circular groove machined into

8 plate of the ‘pase metel, The presence or absence of cracks in the weld

- metal is then observed. Test. samples of two heats of INOR-8 alloys, to-
‘gether with samples of four other alloys for compexison, ere shown in
: Fig. 3, Te . As may be seen the restraint of the weld metal caused complete

circumferential cracking in 'INOR-8 hest ees, which ‘contained 0.04% B,

whereas there are no cracks in INOR-8 heat 30-38, which differed from
heat 8284 primarily in the absence of boron. Two other INOR-8 heats
that did not contain boron similarly did not erack when subjected to
the circuler-groove test.

In order to further study the effect of boron in INOR-8 heats,
several 3-1b vecuum-melted ingots with nominal boron contents of up to
0.10% were prepared, slotted, and welded as shown in Fig. 3.8, All
ingots with 0.02% or more boron cracked in this test.

A procedure specification for the welding of INOR-8 tubing is
eveilsble that is based on the results of these cracking tests and exemi-
nations of numerous successful welds. The integrity of a joint, which
is & meesure of the quality of & weld, is determined through visual,
radiogrephic, and metallogrephic examinations and mechanical tests at
room and service temperatures. It has been established through such
examinstions end tests thet sound joints cen be made in INOR-8 tubing
that contains less than 0.02% boron.

Weld test plates of the type shown in Fig. 3.9 have also been used
for studying the ‘mechanical properties of welded joints. Such test
plates were side-bend tested in the apparatus illustrated in Fig. 3.10.
The results of the tests, presented in Table 3.3, indicate excellent
weld metal ductility. For example, the ductility of heat M-5 material
is greater than 40% at temperatures up to and including 1500°F.

. Brazing Co
Welded end back-brazed tubesto-tube sheet Joints are normally used
in the fabrication of heat exchengers for molten salt service. The back
‘brazing operation serves to remove the notch inherent in conventional
‘tube~to-tube sheet Joints, ’ ‘end the ‘braze materiel minimizes the possi-
bility of leskage through. a weld failure that might be created by thermal

The nickel-base brazing alloys listed in Table 3.4 have been shown
~ to be satisfactory in contact with the salt mixture LiP-KF-NaF-UF) in
tests conducted at 1500° F for 100 hr. Further two precious metal-base
brazing slloys, 824 Au-18% Ni end 80% hu-20% Cu, were unattaecked in the
LiP-KF-NaF-UF) salt after 2000 hr at 1200°F. These two precious metal
alloys were also tested in the ILiF-BeF, oUF), mixture and again were not
attacked.

3.6. Nondestructive Testing

An ultrasonic inspection technique is aveilsble for the detection
of flaws in plate ’ piping, and tubing. The water~imersed pulse-echo .
ultrasound equipment has been adapted to high-speed use. Eddy current,
dye penetrent, and rediographic inspection methods are also used as
~ required. The inspected materials have included Inconel, eustenitic
} stainless steel, INOR-8, and the Hastelloy and other nickel-molybdenum-
vase alloys.

Methods are being developed for the nondestructive testing of weld~
‘ments during initial construction and after replacement by remote means
in a high«intensity radiation field, such as that which will be present .
if maintenance work is required after operetion of a molten~salt. reactor.
The ultrasonic technigue appears to be best suited to semi-automatic and
remote operation, and it will probably be the least affected by radietion
of any of the applicable methods. Studies have indicated that the dif-
ficulties encountered in the ultrasonic inspection of Inconel welds and
welds of some of the austenitic stainless steels because the weld struc-"
/ tures have high ultrasonic attenuation are not present in the inspection
of INOR-8 welds. The high ultrasonic attenuation is not present in INOR=8
welds because the base metal and the veld metal are of the seme composi-
tion. The mechanical equipment designed for the remote welding operation
will be useful for the iaspeetion operation.

In the routine inspection of reactor-grade construction materials »
a tube, pipe, plete, or rod is rejected if a void is detected that is
larger than 5% of the thickness of the part being inspected. In the

4. MECHANICAL AND THERMAL PROPERTIES ‘OF INOR-8

4.1, Elasticity
A typical stress-strain curve for INOR-8 at 1200°F is shown in Fig.
3.11. Data from similar curves obtained from tests at room temperature
wp to 1400°F are summarized in Fig. 3.12 to show changes in tensile
strength, yield strength, and ductility as a function of temperature.
| The temperature dependence of the Young's modulus of this material is
illustrated in Fig. 3.13. :

4.2, Plasticity ” .
A series of relaxation tests of INOR-8 at 1200 and 1300°F have

indicated that creep will be an important design consideration for
reactors operating in this temperature range. The rate &t which

the stress must be relaxed in order to maintein e ‘constant elastic:
strain st 1300°F is shown in Fig. 3.14, end similar data for 1200°F
ere presented in Fig. 3.15. The time lapse before the material |
becomes plastic is sbout 1 hr at 1300°F and about 10 hr at 1200°F,
The time period during which the material behaves elastically becomes
much longer at lower temperatures and below some temperatures s 8S

yet undetermined, the metal will continue to behave elastically indefi-
nitely.

It is possible to summarize the creep date by comparing the times
to 1.0% total strain as e function of stress in the data shown in Fig.
3,16. The reproducibility of creep date for this material is indicated
by the separate curves shown in Fig. 3.17. It may be seen that quite
good correlation between the creep curves is obtained at the lower stress
velues, Some scatter in time to rupture occurs at 25,000 psi, & stress
which corresponds to the 0.2% offset yield strength at this temperature.
‘Such scatter is to be expected at this high stress level.

The tensile strengths of several metals are compared with the tensile
strength of INORe8 at 1300°F in the following tabulation, and the creep
properties of the several elloys at 1.0% strein ere compared in Fig. 3.18:

Tensile Strength at

Material 1300°F (psi)
18-8 stainless steel 40,000
Cr-Mo steel (5% Cr) 20,000
Hastelloy B 70,000
Hastelloy C 100,000
Inconel 60,000
INOR=8 65,000

The test results indicate that the elastic and plastic strengths of

INOR-8 are near the top of the range of strength properties of the several

alloys commonly considered for high-temperature use. Since INOR-8 was
designed to avoid the defects inherent in these other metals, it is ap-
parent that the undesirable aspects have been eliminated without eny
serious loss in strength.

L.3. Aging Characteristics

Numerous secondary phases that are capeble of embrittling & nickel
base alloy cen exist in the Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe-C system, but no brittle phase
exists if the alloy contains less than 20% Mo, 8% Cr, and 5% Fe. INOR-8,

‘perties at room temperature, as shown in Teble 3.5, are virtually unaf-
fected by aging. | | |

Values of the thermal conductivity and coefficient of linear thermal
expansion are given in Tebles 3.6 and 3.7.

 

5. OXIDATION RESISTANCE

The oxidation resistance of nickel«molybdenum alloys depends on the
service temperature, the temperature cycle, the molybdenum content, and
the chromium content. The oxidation rate of the binary nickel-molybdenum
- alloy passes through & maximum for the alloy containing 15% Mo, and the
scele formed by the oxidetion is NiMoOy, and NiO. Upon thermal cycling
from sbove 1400°F to below 660° F, the NiMoO, undergoes & phase transforma~
tion which csuses the protective scale on the oxidized metal to spall.
Subsequent temperature cycles then result in an accelerated oxidation
rate, Similerly, the oxidation rate of nickel-molybdenun alloys contain
ing chromium passes through a maximm for alloys containing between 2
and 6% Cr. Alloys containing more than 6% Cr are insensitive to thermal
cycling end the molybdenum content because the oxide scale is predominantly -
stable 0r0,. An sbrupt decrease, by a factor of about 40, in the oxida-
tion rate at 1800°F is observed when the chromium content 1s increased CL .

The oxidation resistance of INOR-8 is excellént, and, continuous
operetion at temperatures up to 1800°F is feasible. ~ Intermittent use
at temperatures as high at 1900°F could be tolerated. . For temperatures
up to 1200°F, the oxidation rate is not measurable; it is essentially
nonexistent after 1000 kr of exposure in static air. It is estimated -
that oxidetion of 0.001 to 0.002 in. would occur in 100,000 hr of opera-
tion at 1200°F. The effect of temperature on the oxidation rate of the
elloy is shown in Table 3.8.

ture range presently contemplated for molten-salt reactor heet exchanger.
operation. At higher temperatures, mass transfer could become a problem,
end therefore the fabrication of duplex tubing hes been investigated.

Co Satisfactory duplex tubing has been made that consists of Inconel clad
with type 316 stainless steel, and components for & duplex heat exchanger

have been fabricated, as shown in Fig. 3.20.
The fabricetion of duplex tubing is eccomplished by coextrusion of

billets of the two alloys. The high temperature and pressure used result

in the formation of a metallurgical. bond between the two alloys. In

* subsequent reduction steps the bonded composite behaves as one material.

The ratios of the elloye thet comprise the ‘composite are controlleble to
within 3%. The uniformity and bond integrity obtained in this process

are illustrated in ‘Fig. 3.21.

The problen ‘of welding INOR-8--statnless steel duplex 4ubing is

Ln being studied. Experiments have indicated that proper selection of alloy
ratios and weld design ‘will assure welds thet will be satisfactory in
high-temperature serivee.

In order to determine Vetter interaitrusion of the alloys would
result in a continuous brittle at the interface ’ tests were made
in the temperature range of 1300 to 1800° F. As expected, & new phase

fuel salt, penetration of the pores of the graphite by the fuel, and
carburization of the nickelalloy container.

Many molten fluoride selts have been melted and handled in graphite
crucibles, and in these short-term uses, the graphite is inert to the
salt. Tests at temperatures up to 1800°F with the ternary salt mixture
NeF-ZrF) -UF), gave no indication of the decomposition of the fluoride and
no gas evolution eo long as the graphite was free from a silicon impurity.

longer«~time tests of graphite immersed in fluoride salts have shown
greater indications of penetration of the graphite by salts s 8nd it must
be assumed thet the salt will eventually penetrate the aveilable yores

in the graphite. The "impermesble" grades of grephite available experi-

mentally show greater reduced penetration and a sample of high-density,
bonded, natural graphite (De Gussa) showed very little penetration.
Although quantitative figures ere not available, it is likely that the
extent of penetration of "impermeable" graphite gredes can be tolerated.

Although these penetration tests showed no visible effects of attack
of the grephite by the salt, ‘analyses of the salt for carbon showed that
at 1500°F more then 1% carbon mey be picked up in 100 hr. ‘The carbon
pickup appears to be sensitive to temperature, however, ‘inasmuch as ad

9. MATERIALS FOR VALVE SEATS AND EEARING SURFACES

Nearly ell metsls, elloys , end herd-facing materials tend to undergo
solid-phase bonding when held together under pressure in molten fluoride
selts at temperatures ‘above 1000° F. Such bonding tends to make the
startup of hydrodynamic bearings difficult or impossible, and it reduces
the chance of opening e valve that has been closed for any length of
time. Screening tests in & search for ‘nonbonding materiels thet will
stand up under the molten-galt environment have indicated that the most
promising materials are TiC-Ni end WC-Co types of cermets with nickel
or cobalt contents of less than 35 wt %, tungsten, and molybdenum. The
tests, in general, have been of less than 1000-hr duration, so the useful
lives of these materials have not yet been determined.

10. SUMMARY OF MATERIAL FROELEMS

Although much experimental work remains to be done before the con-
struction of a complete power reactor system cen begin, it is spparent
that considerable progress has been achieved in solving the materiel
problems of the reactor core. A strong, stable, and corrosion-resistent
alloy with good welding and forming characteristics is eveileble. Pro=-
duction techniques have been developed, and the alloy hes been produced
in commercial guantities by several elloy vendors. Finally it appears
that, even at the peak operating temperature s DO serious effect on the
alloy occurs vhen the moLsey salt it contains is in direct contact with

PART b -

poses ASPECTS OF MOLTEN-SALT REACTORS.

~~ The ability of certein molten salts to dissolve uranium and ‘thorium salts
in quantities of reactor: interest made possible the consideration of fluid-fueled
reactors with thorium in the fuel, without the danger of nuclear accidents as a
result of the settling of a slurry. This additional degree of freedom has been
exploited in the ‘study of molten-salt reactors.

Mixtures of the fluorides of alkali metals and zirconium or beryllium, as
discussed in Part 2, possess: the most desirable combination of low neutron
absorption, high solubility of uranium and thorium compounds, chemical inert-
ness at high temperatures, 2nd thermal and radiation stability. The following
comparison of the capture oss sections of the alkali metals reveals that al
‘containing 0.01% 118 has a.cross section at 0.0795 ev and 1150° F that iss
factor of 4 lower than that ‘of sodiua, ‘which also has a low cross section:

Sodium - : 0.290
Potassium oo . : Co 1.13%

Rubi dium oo oo 0.401

Cesium iN Co 29

The capture cross section of beryllium is also satisfactorily low at all
. neutron energies, and therefore ‘mixtures of LiF and BeF, which have satisfac-
tory melting points, viscosities, and solubilities for UF), and ThF),, were
selected for investigation in the reactor physics study.

Mixtures of NaF, ZrF), ‘and UF), were studied previously, and such a fuel
vas successfully used in ‘the Aircraft Reactor Experiment (see Parts 1 and 2).
Inconel was shown to be reasonably resistant to corrosion by this mixture at
1500°F, and there is reason to expect that Inconel equipment would have a life
of at least several years at 1200°F. As a fuel for a central-station power

- reactor, however, the NaF-ZrF, system has several serious disadvantages. The

sodium capture cross section 1s less favorable than that of u'. More important,
recent datal indicate that the capture cross section of zirconium is quite high

in the epithermal and intermediate neutron energy ranges. In comparison with

the LiF-BeF, system, the NaF-ZrF) system has inferior heat transfer characteristics.
Finally, the INOR alloys (see Part 3) show promise of being as resistant to the
beryllium salts as to the zirconium salts, and therefore there is no compelling
reason for selecting the NaF-ZrF) system. 5

A critical calculation requires about 1 min on the Oracle; changes in concen-
tration of 1k elements during.a specified time can then be computed in about

The molten salts may be used as homogeneous moderators or simply as fuel
carriers in heterogeneous reactors. Although, as discussed below, graphite-
moderated heterogeneous reactors have certain potential advantages, their
technical feasibility depends upon the compatibility of fuel, graphite, and
metal, which has n6t as yet been established. For this reason, the homogeneous
reactors, although inferior. in nuclear performance, have been given greatest
attention. 7; : |
A preliminary study indicated that, if the integrity of the core vessel

could be guaranteed, the nuclear economy of two-region reactors would probably
be superior to that of bare ‘and reflected one-region. reactors. The two-region
reactors were, accordingly, ‘studied in detail. Although entrance and exit con-
ditions dictate other ‘than a spherical shape, it was necessary, for the calcu-
‘lations, to use a model comprising the following concentric spherical regions:

(1) the core, (2) an INOR-8 core vessel 1/3 in. thick, (3) a blanket approxi-
mately 2 ft thick, and (b) an INOR-8 reactor vessel 2/3 in. thick. The diameter’
of the core and the concentration of thorium in the core were selected as inde-
pendent variables. The primdry dependent variables were the critical concentra-
tion of the fuel (We, v3, or Pu 239, and the distribution of the neutron
absorptions among the various atomic species in the reactor. From these, the"
critical mass, critical inventory, regeneration ratio, burnup rate, etc., can
be readily calculated, as described in the folloring section.

The study of homogeneous reactors vas divided into two phases: (1) the
mapping of the nuclear characteristics of the initiel (f.e., "clean") states
"as a function of core diameter and thorium concentration; and (2) the analysis
of the.subsequent performance of selected initial states with various process-
ing schemes and rates. The detailed results of these studies are given in the
following paragraphs. Briefly, it was found that regeneration ratios of up

to 0.65 can be obtained with moderate investment in 1° (less than 1000 kg)
and that, if the fission products are moved (Section 1.2) at & rate such that
the equilibrium inventory is equal to one year's production, the regeneration
ratio can be maintained above 0.5 for at least 20 years.

1.1 Initial States

A complete parametric study of molten fluoride salt reactors having
diemeters in the range of 4 to 10 ft and thorium concentrations in the fuel
ranging from O to 1 mole % ThF), was performed. In these reactors, the basic .
fuel salt (fuel salt No. 1) was a mxfure of 31 mole % BeF,, and 69 mole % IiF,
which has a density of about 2.0 g/cm’ at 1150° F. The core vessel was composed
of INOR-8. The blanket fluid (blanket salt No. 1) was a mixture of 25 mole %
ThF) and 75 mole % LiF, which has a density of about 4.3 g/cm’ at 1150°F. In
order to shorten the calculations in this series, the reactor vessel was neg-
lected, since the resultant error was small. These reactors contained no fis-
sion products or nonfissionable isotopes of uranium other than 238,

A summary of the results is presented in Table k,1, in which the neutron
balance is presented in terms of neutrons absorbed in a given element per neu-
tron absorbed in 2. (both by fission and the n-y reaction). The sum of ‘the
absorptions is therefore equal to 1, the ‘number of neutrons ‘produced by fission
per neutron absorbed in fuel. Further, the sum of the absorptions in #38 and
thorium in the fuel and in ‘thorium Ain the blanket salt gives directly the re-.
‘generatioh ratio. The losses to other elements ere penalties imposed on the
‘regeneration ratio by ‘these poisons; i. €.y if the core vessel could be con-
structed of some material with: a negligible cross section, the regeneration
ratio could be increased by. the amount listed for capture: in the core vessel.

The inventories in these reactors depend in part on the volume of the
fuel in the pipes, pumps,’ and heat exchangers in the external portion of the
fuel circutt. The inventories listed in Table 4.1 are for systems having a

‘volume of 339 to external to the core, which corresponds approximately to a
power level of 600 Mw of heat. In these calculations it vas assumed that the
heat was transferred to an intermediate coolant composed of the fluorides of
1, Be, and Na before being transferred to sodium metal. In more recent designs
. (see Part 1), this intermediate salt loop has been replaced by a sodium loop
and the external volumes are somewhat less because of the improved equipment
design and layout. co

~ Critical Concentration, Mass, Inventory, and Regeneration Ratio. The
data in Table 4.1 are more ‘easily comprehended in the form of graphs, such as
Fig. L.1, which presents the critical concentration in these reactors as a
function of core ‘diameter and thorium concentration in the fuel salt. The
data points represent calculated values, and the lines are reasonsble inter-
polations. The maximum concentration calculated, about 35 x 10 19 atoms of

uv? per cubic centimeter of fuel salt, or about 1 mole % UF, is an order of a
magnitude smaller than the maximum permissible concentration (about 10 mole %).

The corresponding ¢ritical masses are graphed in Fig. 4.2. As may be seen
the critical mass is.a rather complex function of the diameter and the thorium
concentration. The calculated points are shown here also, and the solid lines
represent, it is felt, reliable interpolations. The dashed lines were drawn
where insufficient numbers of points were calculated to define the curves pre-
cisely; however, they are thought to be qualitatively correct. Since reactors:
having diameters less than 6 ft are not economically attractive, only one case
with a b-ft-dia core was computed.
The critical masses obtained in this study venged from 40 to 400 kg of

©, However, the critical inventory in the entire fuel circuit is of more
interest to the reactor designer than is the critical mass. The critical in-
ventories corresponding to an external fuel volume of 339 pt are therefore
shown in Fig. k. 3. Inventories for other external volumes may be computed

Neutron Balances and Miscellaneous Details. The distributions of the

neutron captures are given in Tables L4.1 and 4.2, where the relative hard-

 

ness of the neutron spectrum is indicated by the median fission energies

and the percentages of thermal fissions. It may be seen that losses to Ii,
Be, and F in the fuel salt and to the core vessel are substantial, especially
in the more thermal reactors (e.g., Case No. 18). However, in the thermal

235

reactors, losses by radiative capture in U are relatively low. Increasing
the hardness decreases losses to salt and core vessel sharply (Case No. 5),
but increases the loss to the n-y reaction. It is these opposing trends
which account for the complicated relation between regeneration ratio and
critical inventory exhibited in Figs. 4.4 and 4.7. The numbers given for
capture in the Ii and F in the blanket show that these elements are well
shielded by the thorium in the blanket, and the leakage values show that
leakage from the reactor is less than 0.01 neutron per neutron absorbed in

total even in the 10-ft-dia core containing 1 mole % ThE), .

Effect of Substitution of Sodium for 1’, In the event that a’ should
prove not to be available in quantity, it would be possible to operate the

in reactors over 6 ft in diameter. The blanket contributes substantially

reactor with mixtures of sodium and beryllium fluorides as the basic fuel
salt. The penalty imposed by sodium in terms of critical inventory and regen-
eration ratio is shown in Fig. 4.8, where typical Na-Be systems are compared
with the corresponding I1-Be systems. With no thorium in the core, the use
of sodium increases the critical inventory by a factor of 1.5 (to about 300 kg)
‘and lovers the regeneration ratio by a ‘factor of 2. The regeneration penalty
is less severe, percentagevise, with 1 mole 9 THF), in the fuel salt; in an -
8-ft- dia core, the inventory rises. from 800 kg to. 1100 kg and the regeneration

Heat Release in Core Vessel and Blanket. The core vessel of & molten-
salt reactor 1 heated by gamma, radiation emanating from the core and blanket
and from within the core vessel itself. Estimates of the gamma, heating cen
be obtained by detailed analyses of the type illustrated by Alexander and
Mann. 9 The gamma-ray heating in the core vessel of a reactor with an 8-ft- dia
core and 0. 3 mole % Ey in the fuel salt has been estimated to be the following:

 

Source Heat Release Rate (w/end)
Radioactive decay in core 1h
Fiesion,. n- -7 capture, and | oo
inelastic scattering in core © 5.2
n-y capture in core vessel oo k.5
© n=y capture in blanket : 0.3
| | Total 11.4

Estimates of gamma-ray source strengths can be used to provide a erude
estimate of the gamma-ray current entering the blanket. For the 8-ft-dia
core, the core contributes 45,3 w of gamma energy per square centimeter to
the blanket and the core vessel contributes 6.8 w/c? which, multiplied by
the surface area of the core vessel, gives a total energy escape into the |
blanket of 28.8 Mw. Some of this energy will be reflected into the core, of
course, and some will escape from the reactor vessel, and therefore the value
of 28.8 Mv is en upper limit. To this may be added the healt released by cap-
ture of neutrons in the blanket. From the Ocusol-A ealeulation for the
8-ft-ala core and a fuel salt containing 0.5 mole % ThF), it was found that .

0. 176 of the neutrons would be captured in the blanket. If an energy release i
of 7 mev/capture is assumed, the heat release at a power level of 600 Mw {neat)
is estimated to be 8.6 Mw. The total is thus h7.k Mw, or say, 50 - to Mw, to
allow for errors. - | |

No allowance vas made for fissions in the blanket. These would add 6 Mw
for each 1% of the fissions occurring in the blanket. Thus it appears that
the heat release rate in the blanket might range up to 80 Mw.

1.2 Intermediate States ©

Without Reprocessing of Fuel Salt. The nuclear performance of a homo-

 

geneous molten-salt reactor changes during operation at power because of the
accumulation of fission products and nonfissionable isotopes of uranium. It
is necessary to add ye» to the fuel salt to overcome these poisons; and, as
a result, the neutron spectrum is hardened and the regeneration ratio decreases
because of the accompanying decrease in n for ye?
for neutrons by the poisons relative to thorium. The accumulation of the superior
fuel 3 compensates for these effects only in part. The decline in the regen-

eration ratio and the increase in the critical inventory during the first year of

and the increased competition

operation of three reactors having 8-ft-dia cores charged, respectively, with
0.25, 0.75, and 1 mole % ThF), are illustrated in Fig. 4.9. The critical inventory
increases by about 300 kg, and the regeneration ratio falls about 16%. The gross
burnup of fuel in the reactor charged with 1 mole % ThF), and operated at 60C Mw
with a load factor of 80 amounts to about 0.73 kg/day. The Na burnup falls
from this value as #3 assumes part of the load. During the first month of
operation, the °° burnup averages 0.69 kg/day. Overcoming the poisons requires
1.53 kg more and brings the feed rate to 2.22 kg/day. ‘The initial rate is high
because of the holdup of bred fuel in the form of Pa°00, As the concentration of
this isotope approaches equilibrium, the ww» feed rate falls rapidly. At the
end of the first year the burnup rate has fallen to 0.62 kg/day and the feed rate
to 1.28 kg/day. At this time #3 contributes about 12% of the fissions. The
reactor contains 893 kg of U2, 0 kg of U0, 7 ke of Pui2), 62 kg of U2,
and 181. kg of ‘fission. ‘products, The # , and the fission products capture 1.8

the addition rate is down to 0.50 kg/day, and it continues to decline slowly
to 0.39 kg/day after 20 years of operation. The nonfissionable isotopes of -
uranium continue to accumulate, of course, but these are nearly compensated
for by the ingrowth of 0°23, As shown in Fig. 4.10, the inventory of a
actually decreases for several years in a typlecal case, and then increases
only moderately during a lifetime of 20 years.

The rapid increase in critical inventory of 1° during the first year
can be avoided by partial withdrawal of thorium. In Fig. 4.10 the dashed
lines indicate the course of events when thorium is removed at the rate of
1/900 per day. Burnup reduces the thorium concentration by another 1/4200
per day. The > inventory rises to 826 kg and then falls, at the end of
eight months, to 587 kg. At this time, the processing rate is increased to
1/240 per day (eight-month cycle), but the thorium is returned to the core
and the thorium concentration falls thereafter only by burnup. It may be
seen that the °? inventory creeps up slowly and that the regeneration ratio
falls slowly. The increase in © inventory could have been prevented by
withdrawing thorium at a small rate; however, the regeneration ratio would
have fallen somewhat more rapidly, and more a feed would have been required

to compensate for burnup.
‘2. HOMOGENEOUS REACTORS FUELED WITH U-0°

Uranium-233 is a superior fuel for use in molten-fluoride- salt reactors
in almost every ‘respect. The fission cross section in the intermediate range
of neutron energies. is ‘greater than ‘the fission cross’ ‘sections of a and

Pio? - Thus initial critical inventories are less, and less additional fuel
is required to" override poisons. Also, the parasitic cross section is sub-
stantially less, end fewer neutrons are lost to radiative capture. Further,
“the radiative captures result in the’ Igsettats formation of a fertile isotope,
a The rate of accumilation of #* 1s orders of ‘magnitude emaller then
‘with #3 as. a fuel, and ‘buildup of" wT and Pu 239 4 1s ‘negligible. ;

“The mean neutron energy is ‘rather nearer: to thermal in these reactors
than it is in the ‘corresponding © cases, Consequently, losses to core
vessel and to core salt tend to be higher. Both losses will be reduced sub-
stantially at higher thorium concentrations.

2.1 Initial States

Results from a parametric study of the nuclear characteristics of two-
region, homogeneous, molten-fluoride-salt reactors fueled with U 233 are given
in Table 4.5. The core diameters considered range from 3 to 10 ft, and the
thorium concentrations range from 0.25 to 1 mole %. Although the regeneration
ratios are less than unity, they are very good compared with those obtained
with °P, With 1 mole %. ThF) in an 8-ft-dia core, the 1°20 inventory was |
only 196 kg, and the regeneration ratio was 0.91.

“The regeneration ratios and fuel inventories of reactors of various
diameters ‘containing 0.25 mole % thorium and .fueled with # or U2 ar

compared in Fig. 4.11. The superiority of 233 is obvious.

2.2 Intérmediate States

Caléulations of the long-term performance of one reactor (Case 51, Teble
4.5) with iad as the fuel are described below. The core diameter used was
8 ft end the thorium concentration was 0.75 mole %. The changes in inventory
of a and regeneration ratio are listed in Table 4.6. During the first year
of operation, the inventory rises from 129 to 199 kg, and the regeneration ratio
falls from 0.82 to 0.71. . If the reprocessing required to hold the concentration
of fission products and Np 231 constant is begun at this time, the inventory of
#3 increases slowly to 247 kg and the regeneration ratio rises slightly to
0.73 during the next 19 years. This constitutes a substantial improvement over

the performance with v=,

Pie is an inferior fuel in intermediate reactors, will result in a poor neu-

| tron economy in comparison with that of UP? - fueled reactors. However, the

advantages of handling Plutonium ine fluid fuel system may make the plutonium-

fueled molten-salt reactor more desirable than other possible plutonium-

‘burning systems.

3.1 Initial States

Critical Concentration, Mass, Inventory, and Regenerstion Ratio. The results
of calculations of a plutonium-fueled resctor having a core diameter of 8 ft and
no thorium in the fuel salt are described below. The critical concentration was
0.013 mole % PuF., which is an order of magnitude smaller ‘than the solubility
limits in the fluoride salte of interest. . The eritical mass vas. 13. 7 kg and
the critical inventory in a 600-Mr system. (339 £t2 of external fuel volume) vas
only 31.2 kg.

The core wes surrounded by the Ii-Be-Th-fluoride blanket mixture No. 2
(13 per cent ThF),). Slightly more than 19% of all neutrons vere captured in
the thorium to give a regeneration ratio of 0.35. By employing smaller cores
. and larger investments in Pu 239 , however, it should be possible to increase
the regeneration ratio substantially.

Neutron Balance and Miscellaneous Details. Details of the neutron economy
of a reactor fueled with plutonium are given in Table 4.7. Parasitic captures
in Put are relatively high; n is 1.84, compared with & v of 2.9. The neutron
spectrum is relatively soft; almost 60% of all fiesions are caused by thermal
neutrons, and, as a result, gbsorptions in lithium are high.

3.2 foipiediote | States

On the basis of the average value of a of Pu 239, 1t is estimated that
p20 vill accurmlate in. the system until 1t captures, at equilibrium, about
‘half as many ‘neutrons - as Pu 239, While these. captures are not wholly paresitie, ~
‘inasmuch as the product, nt, ie fissionable, the added competition for neu-
trons will necessitate en increase in the concentration of the Pu 239, Tikewise,
the ingrowth of fission products will necessitate ‘the addition of more Pu Puoo9,
Further, the rare earths among the fission products may exert a common-1on

influence on the plutonium end reduce its solubility. On the credit side,

as with the wo. fueled reactors.
4. HETEROGENEOUS GRAPHITE-MODERATED REACTORS

The use of a moderator in a heterogeneous lattice with molten salt fuels
is potentially advantageous. First, the approach to a thermal neutron spectrum
improves the neutron yield, T attainable, especially vith a and Pu. 229,
Second, in a heterogeneous system, the fuel is partially shielded from neutrons
of intermediate energy, and a further improvement in effective neutron yield, 1,
redults. Further, the optimum systems may prove to have smaller volumes of fuel
in the core than the corresponding fluorine-moderated, homogeneous reactors and,
consequently, higher concentrations of fuel and thorium in the melt. This may
substantially reduce parasitic losses to components of the’ carrier salt. On
the other hand, these higher concentrations tend to increase the inventory in
the circulating fuel system external to the core. The same considerations
apply to fission products and to nonfissionable isotopes of uranium.

Possible moderators for molten-salt reactors inelude beryllium, BeO, and

‘graphite. The design and performance of the AMreraft Reactor Experiment, a

beryllium oxide moderated, godium-zirconium fluoride salt, one-region, ro.
fueled burner reactor has been reported (see Part 1). Since beryllium and BeO
and molten salts are not chemically compatible, it was necessary to line the
fuel circuit with. Inconel. It is easily estimated that the presence of Inconel,
or any other prospective contatnment metal ine heterogeneous, thermal reactor
would ‘seriously impair the regeneration ratio of a converter-bredder. " Conse-
quently, beryllium and BeO are eliminated from consideration.

Preliminary evidence indicates ‘that uranium-bearing molten salts may be
compatible with some - ‘grades of. graphite and that the presence of the graphite’
will not ‘carburize metallic portions, of the fuel circuit seriously. It

therefore becomes of interest to explore the capabilities of the graphite- }
moderated systems. The principal independent variables of interest are the
core diameter » fuel channel diameter, lattice spacing, and thorium concentration.

PART 5

EQUIPMENT FOR MOLTEN-SALT REACTOR HEAT TRANSFER SYSTEMS

The equipment required in the heat transfer circuits of a molten-salt
reactor consists of the components needed to contain, circulate, cool, heat,
and control molten salts at temperatures up to 1300°F. Included in such
systems are pumps, heat exchangers, piping, expansion tanks, storage vessels,
valves, devices for sensing operating variables, and other auxiliary equipment.

Pumps for the fuel and blanket salts differ from standard centrifugal
pumps for operation at high temperatures in that provisions must be made to
exclude oxidants and lubricants from the salts, to prevent uncontrolled escape
of salts and gases, and to minimize heating and irradiation of the drive motors.
Heat is transferred from both the fuel and the blanket salts to sodium in shell-
and-tube heat exchangers designed to maximize heat transfer per unit volume and
to minimize the contained volume of salt - especially the fuel salt.

Seamless piping is used, where possible, to minimize flaws. Thermal
expansion is accomodated by prestressing the pipe and by using expansion loops
and joints. Heaters and thermal insulation are provided on all components
that contain salt or sodium for preheating and for maintaining the circuits
at temperatures above the freezing points of the liquids and to minimize heat
losses. Devices are provided for sensing flow rates, pressures, temperatures,
and liquid levels. The devices include venturi tubes, pressure transmitters,
thermocouples, electrical probes, and floats. Inert geses are used over free-
liquid surfaces to prevent oxidation and to apply appropriate base pressures
for suppressing cavitation or moving liquid or gas from one vessel to another.

The deviations from standard practice required to adapt the various com-
ponents to the molten-salt system are discussed below. The schematic dlagram
of a molten-salt heat transfer system presented in Fig. 5.1 indicates the
relative positions of the various components. For nuclear operation, an off-
gas system is supplied, as described in Part 1. The vapor condensation trap
indicated in Fig. 5.1 is required only on systems that contain ZrF, or a com-
parably volatile fluoride as a component of the molten salt.

1. PUMPS FOR MOLTEN SALTS

Centrifugal pumps with radial or mixed-flow types of impeller have been
used successfully to circulate molten-salt fuels. The units built thus far -
and those currently being developed have a vertical shaft which carries the
impeller at its lower end. The shaft passes through & free surface of liquid
to isolate the motor, the seals, and the upper bearings from direct contact
with the molten salt. Uncontrolled escape of fission gases or entry of unde-
sirable contaminants to the cover gas above the free-liquid surface in the
pump are prevented either by the use of mechanical shaft seals or hermetic
enclosure of the pump and, if necessary, the motor. Thermal and radiation
shields or barriers are provided to assure acceptable temperature and radia-

tion levels in the motor, seal, and bearing ateas. Liquid cooling of internal
pump surfaces is provided to remove heat induced by gamms and beta radiation.

The principles used in the design of pumps for normal liquids are applil-
cable to the hydraulic design of a molten-salt pump. Experiments have shown
that the cavitation performance of molten-salt pumps can be predicted from
tests made with water at room temperature. In addition to stresses induced
by normal thermal effects, stresses due to radiation must be taken into’
account in all phases of design.

The pump shown in Fig. 5.2.was developed for 2000-hr durability at very
low irradiation levels and was used in the ‘Aircraft Reactor Experiment for
circulating molten salts and sodium at flow rates of 50 to 150 gpm, at heads
up to 250 ft, and at temperatures up to 1550°F. These pumps have been vir-
tually trouble-free in operation, and many units in addition to those used
in the Aircraft Reactor Experiment have been used in developmental tests of
various components of molten-salt systems.

The bearings, seals, shaft, and impeller form a cartridge-type subassembly
that is removable from the pump tank after opening a single, gasketed joint a-
bove the liquid level. The volute, suction, and discharge connections form
parts of the pump tank subassembly into which the removable cartridge is in-
serted. The upper portion of the shaft and a toroidal area in the lower part
of the bearing housing are cooled by circulating oil. Heat losses during
operation are reduced by thermal insulation.

a

In all the units built thus far nickel-chrome alloys have been used in
the construction of all the high-temperature wetted parts of the pump to
minimize corrosion. The relatively low thermal conductivity and high strength
of such alloys permitted close spacing of the impeller and bearings and high
thermal gradients in the shaft.

Thrust loads are carried at the top of the shaft by a matched pair of
preloaded angular-contact ball bearings mounted face-to-face in order to pro-
vide the flexibility required to avoid bindings and to accomodate thermal
distortions. Either single-row ball bearings or a journal bearing can be
used successfully for the lower bearing.

The upper lubricant-to-air and the lower lubricant-to-inert-gas seals
are similgr, rotary, mechanical face-type seals consisting of a stationary
graphite member operating in contact with a hardened-steel rotating member.
The seals are oil-lubricated, and the leakage of oil to the process side is
approximately 1 to 5 cw” day. This oil is collected in a catch basin and
removed from the pump by gas-pressure sparging or by gravity.

The accumulation of some 200,000 hr of relatively trouble-free test
operation in the temperature range of 1200 to 1500°F with molten salts and
liquid metals as the circulated fluids has proved the adequacy of this basic
pump design with regard to the major problem of thermally induced distortions.
Four different sizes and eight models of pumps have been used to provide flows
in the range of 5 to 1500 gpm. Several individual pumps have operated for
periods of 6000 to 8000 hr, consecutively, without maintenance.

1.1 Improvements Desired for Power Reactor Fuel Pump ;

The basic pump described above has bearings and seals that are oil-lubricated
and cooled, and in some of the pumps elastomers have been used as seals between
parts. The pump of this type that was used in the ARE was designed for a rela-
tively low level of radiation and received an integrated dose of less than
5x 108 r. Under these conditions both the lubricants and elastomers were
proved to be entirely satisfactory.

The fuel pump for a power reactor, however, must last for many years.

The radiation level anticipated at the surface of the fuel is 10° to 10° r/hr.
Beta- and gamma -emi tting fission gases will permeate ell available gas space
above the fuel, and the daughter fission products will be deposited on all
exposed surfaces. Under these conditions, the simple pump described above

would fail within a few thousand hours.
- 208 -

C

 
 

 

 

 

 

Considerable improvement in the resistance of the pump and motor to
radiation can be achieved by relatively simple means. Lengthening the shaft
between the impeller and the lower motor bearing and inserting additional
shielding material will reduce the radiation from the fuel to a low level
at the lower motor bearing and the motor. Hollow, metal O-rings or another
metal gasket arrangement can be used to replace the elastomer seals. The
sliding seal just below the lower motor bearing, which prevents escape of
the £1ssion-product gases or inleakage of the outside atmosphere, must be
lubricated to ensure continued operation. If oil lubrication is used,
radiation may quickly cause coking. Various phenyls, or mixtures of them,
are much less subject to formation of gums and cokes under radiation and
could be used as lubricant for the seal and for the lower motor bearing.

This bearing would be of the friction type, for radial and thrust loads.
‘These modifications would provide a fuel pump with an expected life of the
order of a year. With suitable provisions for remote maintenance and repair,
these simple and relatively sure improvements would probably suffice for
power reactor operation.

Three additional improvements, now being studied, should make possible
g fuel pump that will operate trouble-free throughout a very long life. The
first of these is a pilot bearing for operation in the fuel salt. Such a.
bearing, whether of the hydrostatic or hydrodynamic design, would be com-
pletely unaffected by radiation and would permit use of a long shaft so that

- the motor could be well shielded. A combined radial and thrust bearing just
below the motor rotor would be the only other bearing. required. The second
improvement is a labyrinth type of gas seal to prevent escape of fission gases
up the shaft. There are no rubbing surfaces and hence no need for. lubricants,
80 there can be no radiation damage. The ‘third innovation is a hemispherical
gas-cushioned bearing to act as a ‘combined thrust and radial bearing. It
would have the advantage of requiring no auxiliary lubrication supply, and it
would combine well with the labyrinth type of gas seal. It would, of course,
be unaffected vy rediation.

1.2 A Proposed. Fuel Pump

A pump design embodying + these last three features is shown in Fig. 5.3.
It is designed for operation at a temperature of 1200° F, a flow rate of 24,000 gpm,
and a head of 70 ft of fluid. The lower bearing is of the hydrostatic type and is

lubricated by the molten-salt fuel. The upper bearing, which is also of the
hydrostatic type, is cushioned by helium and serves also as a barrier against
passage of gaseous fission products into the motor. This bearing is hemi-
spherical to permit accomodation of thermally induced distortions in the
over-all pump structure.

The principal radiation shielding is that provided between the source
and the area of the motor windings. Iayers of beryllium and boron for neutron
shielding and a heavy metal for gamma, radiation shielding are proposed. The
motor is totally enclosed in order to eliminate the need for a shaft seal. A
coolant is circulated in the area outside the stator windings and between the
upper bearing and the shielding. Molten-salt fuel is circulated over the sur-
faces of these parts of the pump which are in contact with the gaseous fission
products to remove heat generated in the metal.

2. HEAT EXCHANGERS, EXPANSION TANKS, AND DRAIN TANKS

The heat exchangers, expansion tanks, and drain tanks must be especially
designed to fit the particular reactor. system chosen. The design data of items
suitable for a specific reactor plant are described in Part 1. The special
problems encountered are the need for preheating all salt- and sodium-containing
components, for cooling the exposed metal surfaces in the expansion tank, and
for removing afterheat from the drain tanks. It has been found that the molten
salts behave as normal fluids during pumping and flow and that the heat transfer
coefficients can be predicted from the physical properties of the salts.

3. VALVES

The problems associated with valves for molten-salt fuels are the consis-
tent: alignment of parts during transitions from room temperature to 1200° F,
the selection of materials for mating surfaces which will not fusion-bond in
the salt and cause the valve to stick in the closed position, and the pro-
vision of a gas-tight seal. ‘Bellows-sealed, mechanically operated, poppet
valves of the type shown in Fig. 5.4 have given reliable service in test systems.
A number of corrosion- and fusion-bond-resistant materials for high-

temperature use were found through extensive screening tests. Molybdenum

against tungsten or copper and several titanium or tungsten carbide-nickel
cermets mating with each other proved to be satisfactory. Valves with very
accurately machined cermet seats and poppets have operated satisfactorily

in 2-in. molten-salt lines at 1300°F with leakage rates of less than 2 em /hr.
Consistent positioning of the poppet and seat to assure leak tightness is
achieved by minimizing transmission of valve body distortions to the valve
stem and poppet.

If rapid valve operation is not required, a simple "freeze" valve may
bé used to ensure a leak-tight seal. The freeze valve consists of a section
of pipe, usually flattened, that is fitted with a device to cool and freeze
a salt plug and another means of subsequently heating and melting the plug.

L. SYSTEM HEATING

Molten-salt systems must be heated to prevent thermal shock during fill-

ing and to prevent freezing of the salt when the reactor is not operating to

‘produce power. Straight pipe sections are normally heated by an electric

tube-furnace type of heater formed of exposed Nichrome V wire in a ceramic
shell (clamshell heaters). A similar type of heater with the Nichrome V wire
installed in flat ceramic blocks can be used to heat flat surfaces or large |
components, such as dump tanks, etc. In general, these heaters are satis-
factory for continuous operation at 1800°F. Pipe bends, irregular shapes,
and small components, such as valves and pressure-measuring devices, are
usually heated with tubular heaters (e.g, General Electric Company "Calrods")
which can be shaped to fit the component: or pipe bend. In general, this type
of heater should Ye Limited to service at 11500° F. Care must ‘be exercised in
the installation of “tubular heaters to avoid failure due to a hot spot caused
by insulation in direct contact with the heater. This type of failure can be
avoided by installing a thin sheet, of metal Ce stock) between the heater
and the insulation. : Ce

Direct resistance heating in which an electric ‘current 1s passed directly

through a ‘section of the molten-salt piping bas also been ‘used successfully.

Operating. ‘temperatures of this type of heater are limited only by the corrosion
and strength limitations of the metal as the temperature is increased. Experi-
ence has indicated that heating of pipe bends by this method is usually not
uniform and can be accompanied by hot spots caused by nonuniformity of liquid

flow in the bend.

5. JOINTS

Failures of some system components may be expected during the desired
operating life, say 20 years, of a molten-salt power-producing reactor; con-
sequently, provisions must be made for servicing or removing and replacing
such components. Remotely controlled manipulations will be required because
there will be a high level of radiation within the primary shield. Repair
work on or preparations for disposal of components that fail will be carried
out in separate hot cell facilities. |

The components of the system are interconnected by piping, and flanged
connections or welded joints may be used. In breaking connections between a
component and the piping the cleanliness of the system must be preserved, and
in remaking a connection proper alignment of parts must be re-established.

The reassembled system must conform to the original lesk-tightness specifica-
tions. Special tools and handling equipment will be needed to separate
components from the piping and to transport parts within the highly radio-
active regions of the system. While an all-welded system provides the highest
structural integrity, remote cutting of welds, remote welding, and inspection
of such welds are difficult operations. Speclal tools are being developed

for these tasks, but they are not yet generally available. Flanged connections,
which are attractive from the point of view of tooling, present problems of
permanence of their leak tightness.

Three types of flanged joints are being tested that show promise. One
is a freeze-flange joint that consists of a conventional flanged-ring joint
with a cooled annulus between the ring and the process fluid. The salt that
enters the annulus freezes and provides the primary seal, The ring provides
a backup seal against salt and gas leakage. The annulus between the ring and
frozen material can be monitored for fission product or other gas leakage. The
design of this Joint is illustrated in Fig. 5.5.

A cast-metal-sealed flanged joint is also being tested for use in vertical
runs of pipe. As shown in Fig. 5.6, this joint includes a seal which is cast
in place in an annulus provided to contain it. When the connection is to be
made or broken the seal is melted. Mechanical strength is supplied by clamps

or bolts.

A flanged joint containing a gasket (Fig. 5.7) is the third type of
Joint being considered. In this joint the flange faces have sharp, cir-
cular, mating ridges. The opposing ridges compress a soft metal gasket to

6. INSTRUMENTS

Sensing devices are required in molten-salt systems for the measurement
of flow rates, pressures, temperstures, and liquid levels. Devices for these
services are evaluated according to the following criteria: (1) they must be
of leak-tight, preferably all-welded, construction; (2). they must be capable
of operating at maximum temperature of the fluid system; (3) their accuracies
must be relatively unaffected by changes in the system temperature; (4) they
should provide lifetimes at least as great as the lifetime of the reactor;
(5) each must be constructed so that, if the sensing element fails, only the
measurement supplied by it is lost. The fluid system to which the instrument
is attached must not be jeopardized by failure of the sensing element.

6.1 Flow Measurements

Flow rates are measured in molten-salt systems with orifice or venturi
elements. The pressures developed across the sensing element are measured
by comparing the outputs of two pressure-measuring devices. Magnetic flow-
meters are not at present sufficiently sensitive for molten-salt service
because of the poor electrical conductivity of the salts.

6.2 Pressure Measurements

Measurements of system pressures require that transducers operate at a
safe margin above the melting ‘point of the salt, and thus the ic trans-

ducer operating ‘temperature: is usually about 1200° F. The pressure. ‘transducers - ~

that are available are of two types: (1) a pneumatic force-balanced unit and

(2) a displacement unit in which ‘the pressure is sensed by displacement of a
Bourdon tube or diaphragn. The pneumatic force-balanced unit has the disadvan-
tages that loss of the instrument ‘gae supply (usually air) can result in loss ‘
of the measurement and that failure of the bellows or diaphragm would open the
process system to the alr supply or to the atmosphere. The displacement unit,

on the other hand, makes use of an isolating fluid to transfer the sensed
pressure hydrostatically to an isolated low-temperature output element. Thus,
in the event of a failure of the primary diaphragm, the process fluid would
merely mix with the isolating fluid and the closure of the system would be
unaffected.

6. 3 Temperature Measurements

Temperatures in the range of 800 to 1300° F are commonly measired with
Chromel-Alumel thermocouples or platinum-platinum-rhodium thermocouples. The
accuracy and life of a thermocouple in the temperature range of’ interest are
functions of the wire size, and, in general, the largest possible thermocouple
should be used. Either beaded thermocouples or the newer, magnesium oxide-

insulated thermocouples may be used.

6.4 Iiquid-Ievel Measurements

Instruments are available for both on-off and continuous level measure-
ments. On-off measurements are made with modified automotive-type spark plugs
in which 8 long rod is used in place of the normal center conductor of the
spark plug. In order to obtain a continuous level measurement, ‘the fluid head
is measured with a differential pressure instrument. The pressure required to
bubble a gas into the fluid is compared with the pressure above the liquid to
obtain the fluid head. Resistance probe and float types of level indicators
are available for use in liquid-metal systems.

6.5 Nuclear Sensors

Nuclear sensors for molten-salt reactors are similar to those of other
reactors and are not required to withstand high ‘temperatures. Existing and
well-tested fission, fonization, ‘and boron trifluoride ‘thermal-neutron detec~

PART 6
BUILDUP OF NUCLEAR POISONS AND METHODS OF CHEMICAL PROCESSING

Even though neerly pure 1°23 or P22 is used as the initial fuel
for a reactor, undesireble products quickly build up as & result of
the fission process. First, each uranium nucleus that undergoes fis-
sion splits into two "fission product” elements. The fission products
are nuclear poisons to varying degrees that depend on their atomic
number and mass and on the mean neutron energy of the reactor. A sec-
ond source of poison is the even-numbered isotopes of uranium, which.
are not fissionsble. A certain amount of #38 is fed, along with the
17%, even in highly enriched uranium, and ‘as the U°2°, with its high
neutron absorption cross section, is burned out, the percentage of
a rises. Similarly, a certain fraction, a, of the captures in the
fissionable isotopes results in radiative capture of the neutrons, and,
instead of fissioning, the next higher uranium isotope (2H 236y
is formed. It is necessary to examine thé rates and extent to which
these undesireble constituents build up so that changes in neutron

or U

economy may be understood and so that desirable chemical reprocessing
rates may be determined.

1. BUILDUP OF EVEN-MASS-NUMBER URANIUM ISOTOPES

The buildup of U22, 12, 1P2°, and 122° as nonfissionsble iso-

topic diluents in y23> and ye? is, as stated above, significant in
fuel cycle economics. Although y?2 2 does not build up enough to af-
fect the neutron balance significantly, its hard-gamma-emitting
daughters are produced fast enough to be a biological hazard in the
handling of 3 3 and thus adversely affect the resale value of the
ye? Jz It has been assumed that a molten-salt reactor will process

and burn all the PP it produces, hence the a problem has not been
considered in detail.-

Radiative captures in Pad 5 and v2 5 lead to isotopic contamina-
tion of the U°29 with eH . With no processing to separate these
isotopes, and none seems feasible, the 23H builds up until it is be-
ing produced and burned at the same rate. Based on cross sections
for neutrons at a velocity of 2200 n/ sec, as taken from BNL-325
(0s 2. 532, a 2 = o. 10, & 2 = 92), a thermal reactor at steady state
would have ~ 58% as much U23k4 as ved 3, with aa capturing ~9% as
many neutrons as o>, In the epithermal molten-salt reactor de-
scribed in part 1 and hereafter called the reference-design reactor
(a 25 ny 0.16, 05 23 / a2 ~~ 4.67), the steady-state PH concentra-
tion is ~T5% of the 233 concentration, with 2H ebsorptions equal
to ~14% of the iad 3 absorptions. Neutron capture in oH produces
fissionable ©, but capture in thorium would be preferable, since
1? is a better fuel than U°2°,

Radiative capture in v2? 2 yields 3°, 6 which may be considered
to be an isotopic poison, since neutron absorption in U 236 effective~

2. PROTACTINIUM AND NEPTUNIUM POISONING

Neutron capture in pad or Np? has the same result as nonfission

capture in ad 5 or Pu 23 9, i.e., a fissioneble atom is effectively lost,
as well as a neutron. Although neutron loss to Np 23T goes not involve
loss of a fissionsble atom, this loss can be more important than losses
to Pac)” and Np- in reactors fed with highly enriched U-J”, Although
neutron capture by any of these three isotopes yields a fertile atom,
at present prices for fertile and fissile materials the gain is negli-
gible compared with the loss.

yields may be twice as high as in thermal reactors. In the reference-
design molten-salt reactor, processed at the rate of once per year,
Npo2 7 poisoning is zero initially, sbout 0.5% after one year, about
2% after 20 years, and sbout 2.5% at steady state.

3. FISSION PRODUCT POISONING

A 600-Mw reactor operating at a load factor of 0.80 will produce
about 183 kg/yr of fission products. About 22 atom percent of these
fission products have decay chains such that they appear as krypton
or xenon isotopes with half-lives of 78 min or more and thus are sub-
Jeet to physical removal from a molten-selt reactor as rare gases by

 

purging with helium or nitrogen. These "removable" fission products
contribute about 26% of the total fission product poisoning at 100 ev.
(For half-lives of 3 min or more, the yield and poisoning percentages
are 30 and 31, respectively. For half-lives of 1 sec or more the

values are 44 and 38%, respectively.) The comparable poisoning per-
centage in a thermal reactor is much higher because of the very large
thermal neutron absorption cross section of xe? « In a thermal re-

actor, however, burnout limits the xetd 2

poisoning to a maximum of
about 5%, while in a resonance reactor adjacent nuclei do not have
greatly differing cross sections, and burn-out is relatively ineffec-
tive in limiting total poisoning. Thus, to a first approximation, in

resonance reactors poisoning increases almost linearly with time if

 

fission products are not removed.

 

About 26 atom percent of the long-lived fission products are
rare earths. At 100 ev they contribute sbout 40% of the total fis- ;
sion product poisoning. The remaining ~52% of the fission products
contributes ~ 44% of poisoning at 100 ev end comprises a wide variety
of elements, no one of which is outstanding from the nuclear poisoning
point of view.

In a a U 255 ~-burner reactor the fission product
poisoning, zZ, FP) 2° is approximately equal to the equilibrium xe? >
poisoning (0-54, depending on flux level) plus the equilibrium Sm 2kg

 

- 224 -

 
 

 

poisoning (1. 2%) plus the contribution from ell other fission pro-

ducts. From date presented in ORNL-2127 (ret. L) for thermal 23 >

burners operated at constant power and constant vd 5 inventory, with
no fission product removal, the poisoning from "all other fission
products” is calculated to be ~3% at 100% burnup (i.e., when the
total amount of 1°? burned is equal to the Ia inventory), ~19%
at 1000% burnup, and ~ 51% at 10,000% burnup. . Thus it is possible,
although not necessarily economical, to run & thermal, fluid-fueled
reactor for many years without processing the fuel to remove fission
product poisons. The penalties for not processing would be higher
2 inventory charges and lower breeding-conversion ratios. At a
load factor of 0.80, a 600-Mw thermal reactor burns ebout 218 kg of
p>? 5 per year (183 kg fissioned, 35 kg converted into > 6, and
therefore with a 436-kg ye? ‘inventory the fission product poisoning
would increase from O to 5% initially and then to 20 to 25% after
20 years.

~~ Even in thermal reactors, resonence captures in fission products
make the poisoning somewhat worse than the numbers given above. The
megnitude of the extra poisoning depends on the retio of the neutron
flux at resonance energies to the thermal neutron flux, which is de-
termined in part by the effectiveness of the moderator. In resonance
reactors, the fission product poisoning is considersebly worse than in
thermal reactors because of the higher average fission product ebsorp-
tion cross-section relative to > ’, At a load factor of 0.80, a 600-Mw
reactor using 100-ev. neutrons ‘would ‘burn ebout 275 kg of i 5 per year
(183 kg fissioned, 92 kg converted into 1230, In such & reactor with’
an inventory of 550 kg of ©, ‘the fission product poisoning would
increase epproximately linearly from zero , initially, to ~32% after
2 years.

For ye? -fueled reactors, the fission product poisoning is about
the same &s for v? 35 in thermal reactors , but in the resonance region
the higher v2 5 cross section reduces the poisoning effect by a factor
of 2 compared with ue, 5 Thus a 100-ev breeder-converter burning helf--
and-half v2 5 and La > would heve a fission product poison level of
~6% if the fuel were processed at the rate of twice per (100%) burnup.

The reference-design molten-salt reactor has a median fission
energy of ~ 10 ev, with ~10% of the fissions at thermal energies. It
may be considered, to a first approximation, that sbout one-third of
the fissions are at themal energy end sbout two-thirds are at an ener-
gy of 100 ev, for comparison with ‘the analyses presented above. At a
load factor of O. 80, the 600-Mw reactor will burn ~105 kg of uv??? and
A125 kg of USD? per Jo end it will produce ~183 kg of fission pro-
ducts, ~13 kg of 23H , and 3h kg of 236, It should be processed at
e rate of three to four times per 100% burnup, and the total fission
product poisoning will be 6 to 8%.

4, CORROSION-PRODUCT POISONING

Chemical analyses of fuel mixtures circulated in INOR-8 and Inconel
loops have indicated that the principal corrosion-product poisons will
be the fluorides of chromium, iron, and nickel. These are relatively
light elements and, per atom, their capture cross sections in the reson-
ance region are lower then those of the fission products. Further, ex-
trapolations of short-time tests indicate that the concentration of the
corrosion products will be much lower than that of the fission products.
Corrosion product poisoning has therefore been neglected.

5. METHODS FOR CHEMICAL PROCESSING

The "ideel" reactor chemical processing scheme would remove fission

233 14,237 239

products, corrosion products, Pa , and Np as soon as they

were formed. After the pa? and the Np2 had decayed to a2 and Pu? »

they would be returned to the reactor (or sold), slong with the uranium
and plutonium that would also be recovered in the process. This ideal
chemicel plant would have low capital and operating costs, would hold

“up only small emounts of fissionsble end other high-priced materials,
and would discharge its waste streams in forms thet could be inex-
pensively disposed of or, possibly, sold as by-products. . ‘Present
technology, however, does not offer such an ideal pro cess for any

reactor.

More practical goels for processing a molten-salt reactor are
(1) continuous removel of most of the gaseous fission products by
purging the fuel with helium or nitrogen ges; (2) en in-line removal
of rare earth, noble metal, or other. fission products by freezing-out
part of the salt streem, pleting out fission products on metallic
surfaces (either naturally or electrolytically), exchanging the rare
earths for cerium, or scavenging by contacting the salt with a solid
such as BeO to remove certain constituents of the selt by adsorption :
or exchenge; and (3) continuous or batch removel of the salt from
the reactor &t an economically optimum rzte to separate the uranium,
plutonium, end selt from the remaining fission products end corrosion
products by the least expensive method availsble. Present technology
does not make all these methods immediately aveilsble, but there is
. reason to expect thet continuation of the current development program
would make them eveilsble in the nineteen-sixties.

Operation of the Alrcraft Reactor Experiment and of molten-salt
" in-pile loops have indicated thet gaseous fission product removal
can be achieved and thet Ru, Fh, end Pd plate out on metal surfaces.

development programs, but for the present molten-salt reactor study
it is assumed that only the uranium will be recovered from the salt
by the ORNL fluoride volatility process and that the salt will be
stored for future recovery of thorium and lithium. Adequate tech-
nology elready exists for the preparation of fresh fuel starting
with nonradioactive UFg end fluoride salts, and methods for remote
reconstitution of fuel from recycled uranium (and recycled salt,

if possible) are being developed. |

2+1. The Fluoride Volatility Process

A program of development and pilot-plant demonstration of a
fluoride volatility process for recovering uranium from molten
fluoride salts by oxidation with F, to form UF, is currently under
wey. Recovery of the uranium in the slightly radioactive ARE fuel
(NaF-zz¥) -UF), ) was completed in February 1938, and. a demonstration
of the recovery of uranium from a highly radioactive STR fuel ele=-
ment (which, first, will be dissolved in NeF-ZrF) in the presence
of HF) is scheduled for fiscal year 1959. A block flow sheet of
the process as adapted for molten-salt reactor fuel reprocessing
is shown in Fig. 6.1. ‘The uranium-bearing molten salt is trans-
‘ferred to the fluorination vessel in batches. Fluorine, diluted
vith N,, 1s bubbled through the salt at 450°C until its U content
is reduced to ~10 ppm. The UF, N, and excess F, pass out of the
fluorinator through a 100°C NaF pellet bed, which removes the UF
from the gas stream. In the pilot plant the excess Fy is disposed

of by scrubbing it with a reducing KOH solution, but in a production
plant the fluorine might well be recycled to the fluorination step.
The UF is desorbed from the NaF bed by raising the temperature of
the bed to 400°C and sweeping it with more F,-N,. The UF then
passes through a second NaF bed and finally is collected in cold
traps at -40 to -60°C. The volatility plant product is liquid UF,
obtained by isolating the cold traps from the system, heating to

above the triple point, and draining into the product receiver.

Most of the decontamination in the volatility process is achieved
in the fluorination step , since most of the fission and corrosion pro-
ducts remain in the salt. The volatile contaminants (Xe, Kr, I, Te, Mo,
most of the Ru, and part of the Nb and Zr) either pass through the NaF
bed vhile the UFg is retained or remain on the bed when the UF is de-
sorbed (Nb, Zr). The I, Te, Mo end Ru are removed almost entirely by a
cold trap, and the remainder is scrubbed out of the gas system along
+ with the excess Foe The Xe end Kr follow the N, to the plant. off-gas
system. The Nb and Zr slovly build up on the NF bed, which is replaced
when poisoned. Replacement is infrequent, however, because a micrometal-
lic nickel filter between the fluorinator and NeF bed removes most of the
Nb and Zr.

The ARE fuel was processed in batches of l.k £4” of salt, each batch
containing 10 kg of U2? (the capacity of the NaF beds), at the rate of
two batches per week. The not-economically-recoverable uranium losses

in processing the ARE fuel were approximately 0.015% in the waste salt
and 0.075% on the NaF beds.

The reference-design molten-salt reactor includes a volatility plant
approximately the same size as the ORNL pilot plant. About the same
uranium processing rate is planned (two 10-kg batches per week through
the NaF beds), but a higher salt throughput rate (2 £t7/day each of
fuel and blanket fluid) will be used because of the lower uranium con-
centration in the salt (compared with the ARE salt). This higher salt
throughput rate is within the capabilities of the present ORNL pilot
plent, which could fluorinate one l.k £t7 batch per shift, if necessary.
For the molten-salt reactor processing plent, separate fluorinators of
gbout 2 £17 capacity each for the fuel and blanket salts will prevent
cross contamination and require only one fluorination per day for each.

The possibility of continuous fluorinetion and the consequent re-
‘duction in the size of the equipment are being considered. In addition,
information needed in the adaptation of the process to the particular
fuel and blanket salts to be used in the molten-salt reactor is being

- 250 =
 

 

obtained, and simpler means for reconstituting the reactor feed mater-
ials are being studied.

5.2. K-25 Process for Reduction of UFg to UF)

 

The continuous reduction of highly enriched UFg to UF), is well
proved as a nonradioactive process.” The process, used end developed
at K-25, is indicated in Fig. 6.1; the UF product from the volatility
process is the feed material. The reduction takes place in a UFg-Fy-H,
flame in a Y-ghaped reactor. The Fa is added to give the proper fleme
temperature. The reaction products are UF), end HF-H, gas. Micrometal-
lic filters are used to recover eny UF), vhich may be entrained in the
exit gas. A vibrator is used to shake free any UF), which clings to
the filter or tower walls. A chemicel trap with a CaS0, or an NaF
pellet bed is used to recover any unreacted UF¢ in the exit gases ’
although the amount so collected is negligibly small in normal oper-
ation. The HF in the exit gas is either scrubbed with a KOH solution

spray or sorbed on an NaF bed.

This process has not been used at a high level of radioactivity.

Since the UFg from the molten-selt reactor volatility plant will be

somewhat radioactive , the major activity probably being a4 7 , & pilot
plant demonstration will be required, but no serious difficulties are
anticipated. For the molten-salt reactor chemicel plant, equipment

of the seme size as that used in the K-25 facility 1s assumed. A fa-
cility of this size would have excess capacity on a continuous basis,
but it is assumed that it would be operated intermittently, probably
on the once-or-twice-a-week schedule used for the discharging of the
UFg from the voletility plant NaF. beds.

and BeF,,
concentrated hydrofluoric acid (>90% HF, balance 2,0). The uranium

would first be removed by the volatility process. Thorium, corrosion

products, and most of the fission products are insoluble in the sol-
vent and would be separated by filtration, centrifugation, or other

solid-liquid separation methods. The proposed flowsheet is ‘shown in

Fig. 6.2.

Lithium fluoride is quite soluble in anhydrous HF and quite in-

soluble in HO. By itself, BeF, is Just the opposite, elthough its

solubility in HF is significantly increased by first ‘saturating the
HF with LiF. A small amount of water in the HF also increases the

BeF,, solubility markedly. Fluorides and oxides of most of the heavy

elements and some fission products, including the rare earths, are
insoluble in both solvents.

The solubility of the 63 mole % LiF-37 mole % BeF, fuel carrier
salt mixture is greater then 100 g/kg in ~90% HF. In an experiment
in which mixed fission products (rare earths, strontium, and cesium)
were added to the salt mixture and the mixture was dissolved and
filtered, the salt was decontaminated from rare earths by a factor
of ~1000; that is, the activity remaining in the salt was 1/1000
of the activity of the mixture prior to dissolution. No decontami-

nation from cesium was obtained. The results for strontium were ineon-

clusive, but the decontamination appeared to be intermedisdte between
that from rare earths and that from cesium.-

In further studies, fission product and heavy element solubili-
ties will be investigated, as well as possible hydrolysis of the
salt by reaction of the salt with water in the solvent. It may be
found possible to avoid hydrolysis of the selt by using anhydrous HF
or to overcome it by treating the reclaimed salt with HF.

rare earth, possibly cerium, has also been Initiated. The process
might be carried out in either of two ways. First, the salt might
be saturated with ~1 mole % cerium at an elevated temperature, and
then cooled to within ~30°C of the liguidus temperature of the pure
salt, at which temperature the rare earth solubility is only n/0.2%.
Thus ~80% of the cerium would precipitate and carry with it ~80%
of the fission product rare earths. After a solid-liquid separation,
. this process could be repeated, if desired, to give high-percentage
removal of fission product rare earths. Second, a perhaps better
way to accomplish the same end would be to cool the core salt to
near its liquidus tempersture and contact it with solid CeF 5, prob-
ably in a columnar bed of pellets. In principle, the fission pro-
duct rare earths could be exchanged for cerium to any desired extent
in this menner, depending on the ratio of salt to cerium used, the
pellet size (determining the surface area), and the contact time.

The attractiveness of the exchange process is enhanced by the
low absorption cross section of cerium compared with the absorption
cross sections of most fission product rare earths. This potential Cf
advantage is reduced somewhat for a reasoneble processing rate, in
that, effectively, several cerium atoms are exchanged for one fission
product rare earth atom, since the cerium solubility is ~ 0.2 mole %
near the liquidus temperature, whereas the fission-product rare earth
concentration in the core salt is only ~0.044% for a processing rate
of once per year (and proportionately less for shorter processing
periods, as would be desirable given an economical processing method).

In the reference-design molten-salt reactor the advantage is reduced

further by the fact that for resonsnce-energy neutrons the cerium

cross section is not as much lower than the cross sections of the

other rare earths as it is at thermal energies (see Table 6.1). Thus

‘at 100 ev the poisoning due to 0.2% cerium would be equal to that from .
fission-product rare earths for a processing rate of once per six |
months, i.e., the total would be equivalent to fission-product rare.
earth poisoning for a once-per-year processing rate by the volatility

process. oT o

‘The cerium exchange processing method would raise the liquidus
temperature of the core salt by 30° C or more , and remove plutonium
and trivalent uranium along with the rare earths. These disadvantages

do not appear to be ‘serious at present, and the potential adventages
of this processing method for thermal (graphite-moderated) molten-salt
reactors would seem to Justify continued development work.

55. Radioactive Waste Disposal

“At a load factor. of 0. 80, a 600-Mw reactor will produce ~ 183 kg/yr
of fission products. About 23 wt % of the fission products can be re-
moved as Xe-Kr gases, but the remaining ~1hl kg/yr must be removed by
chemical processing. The chemical processing waste stresms include
fused salt, NeF pellets, F.-N,, end HF-H,, gases. Most of the nongaseous

22 2
fission products remain in the fuel salt residue after fluorination and.

“may be stored in this form. Most of the remaining fission products are

removed by periodically flushing out the micrometallic filter between
the fluorinator and the NeF bed and the cold trap between the NaF bed
and the F, disposal unit. The NaF bed is replaced infrequently, if and
vhen it becomes poisoned with niobium and zirconium. Any remaining
fission products in the gas streams are scrubbed out with the Fy and
HF, or vented to the reactor off-gas system.

For optimum costs, high-power molten-salt reactors should have
moderately high inventories of enriched uranium and the fuel should
be processed about twice per fuel-inventory burnup, & compromise be~
tween the rate-proportional cost of processing (assumed at present to
be equal to the cost of buying new salt) and the savings due to im-
proved regeneration ratio made possible by processing. If a fission-
eble material inventory of 600. kg or more end a fuel processing rate
of once per year or greater are assumed, and it is considered that
the fuel salt will be discarded after its uranium is removed by the
volatility process , ‘the yaste salt volume smounts to 600 £t0 per
year or more (sbout 1 ft *y-yess, or 1 £t° /kg of fissionable mater-

iel processed, or 3 to 4 ft 3 xe of total fission products). This

volume is quite low in comparison with the wastes of other power
reactors » for example, STR wastes are ~90 £12 /kg of yg? > processed
in the present aqueous process and ~3 £0 [kg of > > in the proposed
volatility process, and the figures are about 4 times larger on a
cubic foot per kilogram of fission products basis.
