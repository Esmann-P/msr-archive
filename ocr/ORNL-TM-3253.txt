A. INTRODUCTION .

The retirement or decommissioning of the MSRE involves several phases.
Phase I is the period between the end of power operation and the post-
operation examinations, which is Phase II. Phase III is the interim period
between the completion of the examinations and the final disposal which
is Phase IV.

During Phase III, some of the information given in the MSRE Design
and Operations Reports (Refs. 1 through 9) and the facility drawings will
still be applicable. Much of the equipment will not be in service, however,
and most of the procedures which were followed during operation will no
longer be applicable. This report describes the systems which will be
used and specifies the normal conditions and surveillance required during
Phase III. It also lists the more probable abnormal situations which
could develop and prescribes remedial actions. The system of access control,
approvals required for maintenance and changes, and responsibilities are
delineated. This document supersedes all previous operating procedures
for the MSRE.

B. DESCRIPTION AND NORMAL OPERATING CONDITIONS

Most of the equipment and instrumentation involved during Phase III
is shown in Figure B-1l. Pertinent information on the instruments in
service is given in Table B-1. Plan views of the building showing evacu-
ation routes are shown in Figure B-2. The most often used abbreviations
are given in Table B-2. Master, marked-up, copies of the flowsheets
(D-AA-A-40880 to L40890), the instrument application drawings (D-AA-B-40500
to 40515) and the electrical power distribution drawing (E-20794-ED-153-D)
will be kept up to date and available in the MSRE control room in
Building T7503. Another up-to-date set of drawings will be kept in the
outermost room of the office building (Room 17, Building 7509).

About one-half of the fuel salt (5,460 1bs) is stored in FD-1 and
the other half (4784 1bs) in FD-2. All of the flush salt (9,460 1bs) is

stored in FFT. The salt is at ambient temperature and pressure with all
heaters turned off. The salt fill lines (10%, 105, and 106) have been
severed end are blanked in the drain tank cell. Salt is frozen in the
transfer freeze valves (107, 108, and 109). The equalizer line (521)
between the tanks and the fuel circulating system has been blanked in the
drain Cell. The helium supply lines (572, 5T4, 576) are capped. The
vent valves (HCV-5T73, -575, -5T77, and -533) are open (since they are fail-
open valves) but HV's-542, -522A, -522B, -538B, -571B, and -561 in the
vent house are closed. Thus there normally is no purge or vent from the
tanks. The drain tanks and the flush tank gas spaces are interconnected
through the vent valves and the equalizer valves (HCV-5Lik, -545, -5kL6).
The pressure in the tank system is indicated and annunciated by PIA-5T2

in the auxiliary control room. The drain tank and other temperatures

can be read on TR-SD-1.

The fuel circulating system contains only residual amounts of flush
salt. The system was opened at the reactor, fuel pump, heat exchanger,
and line 103. These openings were sealed in various ways and were shown
not to leak excessively at 5 psig. Since some of the heat exchanger tubes
were cut out, the main coolant salt lines (200 and 201) communicate with
the fuel system and were therefore welded shut Just outside the reactor
cell. The system is at ambient temperature and pressure. The helium
supply lines (516, 592, 593, 596, 589, 599, and 600) are capped. The
main vent line (522) is closed by HV-522A and the upper offgas line (5214)
is capped in the Special Equipment Room. The pressure is indicated and
annunciated by PIA-589 in the Auxiliary Control Room.

The coolant salt (3, 575 1bs) is. in the coolant drain tank, at ambient
temperature and pressure. Freeze valves 204 and 206 are frozen to separate
it from the coolant circulating system. The helium supply valve (HV-
511B) is closed and the vent line is blanked off to isolate the tank.

The coolant circulating system contains only residual amounts of
coolant salt. It has been opened in several places and is lightly sealed
(masking tape). There are no helium inputs to the system or vents from
it. Lo
The main charcoal beds are isolated by valves 522B and 55TB. The
auxiliary charcoal bed is isolated by valves 561 and 562A.
 

 

 

 

The reactor and drain tank cell membranes are sealed and the blocks
are secured. The ventilation valves (930B and 955B) are closed and locked.
The cells are vented to the stack through line 565. (HCV-565 is kept open
by pressure from a cylinder of nitrogen.) Activity in the line is moni-
tored by RIA-565 B and C. High activity indication on either detector
‘will close HCV-565 and annunciate in the auxiliary control room. All other
lines and penetrations into the cells are mechanically sealed.

Stack fan SF-1 is in service and SF-2 is in standby (damper 925 open
and 926 closed). All three stack filters are in service. Most of the
‘building ventilation flow is from the high bay with smaller amounts from
other areas including the chemical processing cell. (The relative distri-
bution is not critical.) The stack flow is indicated by FI-S1 at the stack.
The pressure at the inlet to the filters is indicated and annuncisated by
PIA-92TA. The a, B-y, and iodine activities in the stack are indicated
and annunciated in the auxiliary control room and at the ORNL Central Waste
Monitoring Facility (CWMF).

All water lines to the reactor and drain tank cells have been discon-
nected. The water levels in all cell sumps can be checked using the bub-
bler level indicators, but no annunciation is provided. The waste tank is
essentially empty and can also be checked using a bubbler level indicator.
The pump-room sump, which collects water from the filter pit, french drains,
etc., is automatically pumped to the drainage ditch by the sump pumps.

High level in this sump is annunciated.
The fire alarm and sprinkler system is in service and meintained by

the ORNL fire department.

C. SURVEILLANCE

Surveillance of the MSRE shall be adequate to prevent the development
of any condition that would threaten personnel safety or the. continuity of
. other ORNL activities.

Radioactive and fissile materials are so contained and situated that

criticality is prevented and the probability of any significant release to
®

n

the environment is extremely small. The potentials for increasing tempera-
ture and pressure in the containment or the development of other potenti-
ally damaging conditions are limited so that such conditions can arise only
slowly, if at all. Thus the continuous presence of personnel at the reac-
tor site is not required. Surveillance therefore consists of scheduled
visits for data-logging and checking plus the continuous monitoring at the
ORNL Central Waste Monitoring Facility of key signals from the MSRE instru-
mentation.

Each day a member of the ORNL Central Waste Monitoring Group shall
enter the reactor building to make observations as required on a Daily Log
Form. During the last week of each month a qualified member of the Reactor
Division shall mske an inspection of the reactor building, record data, and
make checks as required on a Monthly Log Form, Equipment and instrumenta-
tion shall be maintained on a regular schedule and as required by personnel
of the ORNL Plant and Equipment Division and Instruments and Controls
Division.

When any of a selected list of variables goes out of limits (prescribed
in Table B-1) alarms occur both in the reactor building and at the ORNL
Central Waste Monitoring Facility in Building 3105. When an alarm occurs,
one person from the group on duty at the CWMF shall go to the MSRE site,
enter the main control room and take appropriate action to restore normal
conditions.

Corrective actions for foreseeable abnormal situations are prescribed
in Section E of these Procedures. In addition, experienced former members
of the MSRE operations staff shall be designated and available on call for
assistance in meeting needs that may arise. (See Fig. K-1.)

The ORNL Plant Protection Division provides protection against entry

by unauthorized personnel (see Section J) and against fire damage.
 

 

 

10 my
\&/
D. DATA

1. Control-Room Log
Every significant event or action affecting the reactor shall be re-

corded in a journal-type logbook that is kept in the control room. Some
items which shall be included in this log are:

Equipment started or stopped.

Valves opened or closed.

Switches or breakers opened or closed.

Procedures or parts of procedures started, worked on, or com-
pleted.

Changes in setpoints of switches.
Annunciations, and action taken.
Abnormal conditions or malfunctioning equipment found.

Maintenance and other non-operational jobs done.

The person who makes an observation, or takes action, or is in charge
of any Job shall be responsible for seeing that an entry is made. Log .
entries shall be sufficiently descriptive for others to understand and
each shall include time, date, and the name of the person making the «
entry.

Carbon copies of the logbook sheets will be removed when the monthly

log is teken and will be stored in a file cabinet in Room 17, Building T7509.

2. Periodic Logs }
The Daily Log includes recording various readings as indicated on
Form D-1. This form prescribes "Log Limits" and identifies the appropriate
corrective action if a variable is outside these limits. (Corrective
actions, identified on Form D-1 by a letter, are detailed in Section E of
these Procedures.) .
The Monthly Log, which shall be filled out during the monthly in-
spection, is Form D-2. This form requires reading the salt tank temperatures,
the waste tank level and T sump levels. It also has spaces for indicating:

that other routine monthly tasks have been done.

E. ABNORMAL CONDITIONS

Whenever the log limits are exceeded or an annunciation occurs,
corrective action is necessary. To plan in advance for all possible
trouble is impractical. An attempt has been made to anticipate some of
the more probable difficulties and suggest remedial actions. "What to do
if out of limits" columns have been included in the logs (Forms D-1 and
D-2) and in the list of annunciators (Table E-1). Letters in these columns

refer to the suggested action given in Table E-2. Power outages are cov-

“ered in Section F.

F. POWER OUTAGES

A power outage at the MSRE should not cause much difficulty and
should not be hazardous. - An alarm will occur at the ORNL Control Waste
Monitoring Facility unless they also lose power; in that case no alarm
will occur until their power trouble is corrected.

When power is availsble, a stack fan should be started. HCV-565
should be opened by pushing the reset buttons on RE-565 B and C, and the
high-bay CAM and monitron should be checked. A log should be taken to
assure that everything is within limits and that nothing appears abnormal
in the area. Check that there is no water in the pump room (observe
from 852 level). Freeze protection should be considered in the winter.

The MSRE supervisor should be notified on the next regular work day.

G. ANNUAL TASKS

The fuel and flush salt in the drain tanks will be heated once a year

“to recombine fluorine.

An annual check will be made to determine that all

valving and electrical switches are in the proper position, that standby

equipment will operate if needed and that the annunciator and control

switches have the proper setpoints. The following check lists are used

to accomplish this.

H. MAINTENANCE AND REPAIRS

Operating equipment which fails should be repaired as soon as pos-
sible. The urgency depends upon the consequences. Table E-2 lists most
of the possible process repairs and delineates the importance of each.

Repairs will be done only with the gpprovael of the ORNL Central Waste
Monitoring Group, the MSRE Maintenance Supervisor, or the MSRE Supervisor
(or his representative). The person initiating the request for repairs
will be responsible for the safety of personnel and the facility.

During regular working hours a Punch List form (FORM H-1) will be
filled out and given to the Maintenance Supervisor (Fig. K-1) who will
expedite the repairs. Any deviation from the punch list should be approved
by the requestor. When the work is complete, the punch list will be re-
turned to the Maintenance Supervisor who will be responsible for entering
all details in the console log and filing the completed punch list in
Room 17, Building T7509. :

On other shifts, the ORNL shift supervisor shall arrange to have the
repairs made and shall be responsible for getting the details recorded in
the console log.

Most of the programed maintenance will be done during the last week
of each month when the monthly log is being taken. Permission must be
obtained from the Maintenance Supervisor, the MSRE Supervisor, or his
representative before doing these.

No modification will be made to the facility without the approval of

the MSRE Supervisor or his supervisors.
I. REMOVAL OF EQUIPMENT OR INSTRUMENTATION

Equipment and instrumentation needed for the interim storage of the

fuel or for the future transfer or processing of the fuel will be retained

intact. Other things may be removed if needed after obtaining the approval

of the MSRE Surplus Property Custodian, the MSRE Supervisor, or Assistant
MSRE Supervisor. All ORNL procedures will be strictly adhered to (see
ORNIL-SPP-37). In addition an MSRE Property Transfer Form I-1, and Punch

J. ACCESS CONTROL

As indicated in Fig. B-2, an B-foot lighted security fence completely
encloses a compact area immediately surrounding the MSRE buildings. Two

gates in the fence (North and West Gates) open onto Melton Valley Drive

(a road posted as "Official Use Only"). The other two gates and the office

building door are inside the controlled-accéss HFIR-TRU-TURF area. All
four gates and the office door will normally be kept locked. On the office
door and on each of the four gates is a sign of the form indicated below,
where the blanks contain the names and phone numbers of (1) the MSRE Super-

visor, (2) the Assistant MSRE Supervisor, (3) the MSRP Associate Director,
and (4) the MSRP Director.

CONTROLLED ACCESS ARFA

DO NOT ENTER WITHOUT PERMISSION

Persons Authorized to Give Permission:

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

 

Normal entrance to the MSRE:Area will be:through the guard gate
on the HFIR Access Road, then through either the office door, the East
Gate or the South Gate. Keys to the door and these two gates will be is-
sued to a limited number of people, including the MSRP Associate Director,
the MSRE Supervisor, the MSRE Surplus Property Custodian, the Assistant
MSRE Supervisor, the MSRE Maintenance Supervisor, the ORNL Waste Monitoring

Group, and the ORNL Shift Supervisors.

The North and West gates will have security-type locks which are
controlled by the ORNL Guard Department. Only a limited number of people
will be authorized to have the Guard Department open these. These will
include the MSRP Associate Director, the MSRE Supervisor, the MSRE Asst.
Supervisor, and the ORNL Shift Supervisors. These gates will not be left
open without a guard in attendance. |

There will be radiation and contamination outside of the containment
cells. Where required, Radiation and Contamination Zones will be identi-
fied and protection provided as prescribed by ORNL procedures. Monthly
radiation and safety surveys will be made to assure that no inadequately
guarded hazards exist. Those persons having keys will be advised of any
limitations on use of the area, and it will be their responsibility to

so advise anyone that they admit to the area.

K. ~ ORGANIZATION AND CHANGES

The organization chart for the MSRE during Phase III is shown in
Fig. K-1. The MSRE supervisor hes the prime responsibility for the area.
He must approve of any changes in the procedures or modi fication of the

facility. A master up-to-date copy of the procedures will be kept in

: Room 17, Building 7509. All changes will be initialed and dated. If sig-

nificant modifications are needed, others in the MSRP project will be

consulted.
