ABSTRACT

In this report are tabulated all results of laboratory
analyses performed in surveillance of MSRE salt, water,
cover gas, and oil systems. Excepted are analytical data
pertaining to fission product and tritium distribution
and transport. The report recapitulates conclusions
derived from chemical analyses performed from the
1964 preoperational test period until termination of
power operations in 1969, modified by the results of
postoperational examination of the reactor compo-
nents. Surveillance results were evaluated with respect
to their significance as indicators of the performance of
the MSRE and as indicators of the need and potential
for development of specific in-line methods of analysis
for molten-salt power reactors.

As judged from chemical data, the MSRE was highly
successful as a materials demonstration. The flowing
salts did not wet their containment systems; fuel salt
neither wetted nor penetrated the graphite moderator
surface. The cumulative generalized corrosion within
the fuel circuit resulted in the removal of chromium
from the alloy to an average depth of 0.4 mil, while
that in the coolant system was undetectably low. The
results of postoperational examinations, although cor-
roborative of predicted corrosion, also indicated finite
but slight intergranular attack. In operations which
successively employed 235U, 233U, and 23°Pu as
sources of power in the reactor, the circulated fluids
remained chemically stable, free of radiation damage,
and free of contamination. The average full-power
output of the reactor, as computed from experimental
results of isotopic dilution mass spectrometric analysis
of fissile species and subsequently confirmed by cap-
ture-to-absorption ratio measurements, was shown to be
7.4 MW(t). oo

EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) was
- conducted during the period from 1965 to 1969 as the

first extensive demonstration of the operability of
molten-salt reactors. During this period, continuous
surveillance of the chemical behavior in the circulating
fluid salt, water, cover gas, and oil systems was
maintained through a program of laboratory analysis.
The principal function of the program was to ensure
that the Experiment would proceed with the freedom

from chemical problems that was anticipated from the
results of prior supporting research and development
programs. The results of chemical analyses were also
used for assistance in developing operational plans for
nuclear engineering experiments with the reactor. In
these experiments, the reactor was employed to a
limited extent as an experimental chemical facility to
obtain chemical data that were not otherwise available.

All of the results of laboratory analyses (except the
mass of data on fission product and tritium distribution
and transport) performed in surveillance of the MSRE
salt, water, cover gas, and oil systems are summarized in
the current report. In this archive record are recapitu-
lated various conclusions derived from the laboratory
analyses performed from 1965 to 1969 as modified by
the results of postoperational examination of the
reactor components.

Surveillance results were evaluated with respect to
their significance as indicators of the need and potential
for development of specific in-line methods of analyses
for molten-salt power reactors. Examination of metal-
graphite assemblages removed periodically from a flow
channel in the graphite moderator confirmed inferences
from chemical data that materials compatibility was
excellent.

This report is divided into chapters that pertain to the
chemical behavior of flush, coolant, carrier, and fuel
salts in the prenuclear operational period, the chemical
composition of the fuel and flush salts.during nuclear
operations, the results of corrosion surveillance, power
estimates from chemical and isotopic dilution data, and
the results obtained from analysis of samples from
auxiliary fluid systems.

Experience with the MSRE throughout the shake-
down periods preceding power .operations confirmed
that the molten fluoride salt mixtures were intrinsically
noncorrosive to Hastelloy N and that effective proce-
dures were employed to prevent serious contamination
of the salt circuits during this period.

Upon initiation of power operations, orifices in the
fuel off-gas system became restricted. Investigation
showed that the cause was organic material: oil that
seeped into the fuel pump. Improved filters successfully
alleviated the plugging problem, but the continued
passage of hydrocarbons through the pump constituted
a chemical factor that introduced a degree of un-
certainty to some interpretations of chemical behavior
in the MSRE.

 
 

In operations which successively employed 235U,
233, and 23°Pu as sources of power in the reactor,
the circulated fuel salt remained chemically stable, free
of radiation damage, and essentially free of contami-
nation.

While chemical data alone were useful as statistical
indicators of trends in the concentration of fissile
species in the fuel salt over extended periods of power
operation, they were of secondary importance in
day-to-day operations because on-site reactivity balance
measurements proved to be some ten times more
sensitive to changes in the concentration of fissile
material than the individual chemical results. The
combined results of chemical and mass spectrometric
analysis, however, furnished information that was
uniquely suited to use in establishing numerous abolute

“values and were applicable for determination of trends

in performance, in computation of inventory, and in
establishing the distribution of uranium between the
fuel- and flush-salt systems.

After three years of operations with 235,238(5 fyel
salt, uranium was removed from the carrier salt in

- preparation for tests of 233U as a fuel for molten-salt

reactors. Uranium was removed from the carrier salt by
fluorination; the uranium hexafluoride product was
absorbed on NaF beds. Recovery of the uranium from
the NaF absorber beds yielded less uranium than
expected. A painstaking investigation was made which
led to a refinement in the material balances of
fissionable species in the reactor from the outset of
operations. From these it was deduced that the dis-
parity was caused by retention of 0.8 kg of 235U (2.48
kg ZU) in the chemical reprocessing facility at the

MSRE. =

Fuel salt was prevented from becoming increasingly
oxidizing as burnup of fissionable material proceeded
by the addition of small amounts of beryllium metal to
the salt flowing through the pump bowl. The results of
these experiments showed that the disposition of **Nb
between the containment materials and the salt could
be used as an indicator of the freedom from our
development of a potentially oxidizing condition in the
fuel salt. :

Disposal of gaseous tritium emanating from the
MSRE posed no radiological hazard; consequently, no
program for completely defining its distribution was
instituted at the outset of operations. After recognition
of the importance of tritium control in large molten-salt
reactors, studies of tritium in the MSRE were actively
pursued. Results of these studies are described in other

MSRP reports and are not treated extensively here.

As judged from chemical data, the MSRE was highly
successful as a materials demonstration. The flowing
salts did not wet their containment systems; fuel salt
neither wetted nor penetrated the graphite moderator
surface. Chemical analyses showed corrosion with the
2LiF+BeF, coolant system to be negligible. This has
been borne out by subsequent examination of the salt
side of the tubes from the air-cooled radiator and of the
coolant side of the primary heat exchanger. Similar but
more numerous analyses suggested that corrosion with-
in the fuel system was slight (but observable). The
cumulative generalized corrosion within the fuel circuit

resulted in the removal of chromium (the most chemi-

cally active constituent of the alloy) from an average
depth of 0.4 mil, some ten times less than was
anticipated from the preoperational laboratory mea-
surements of self-diffusion coefficients of chromium in
Hastelloy N. It is inferred that the major fraction of this
corrosion resulted from interactions of atmospheric

oxygen retained in the graphite moderator after periods

of reactor maintenance.

Postoperational examination by metallographic tech-
niques confirmed the low generalized corrosion but
disclosed a grain-boundary effect near surfaces exposed
to the fuel which resulted in cracks to a depth of one
grain in strained specimens. This hitherto unobserved
phenomenon is currently being investigated.

A salient conclusion from the chemical studies de-
scribed in the current report is that development of
automated in-line methods for determination of redox
potential ([U**]/[ZU]) of fuel salts, for dynamic
assessment of corrosion rates, and for measurement of
the presence of oxides at low (<50 ppm) concen-
trations in flowing salt will be required for operation of
larger reactors. ’

Operation of the MSRE served to demonstrate the
practicality of the molten-salt reactor concept, its
safety, reliability, and tractability to simple mainte-
nance methods. These operations confirmed that the
molten fluoride salts are immune to radiation damage,

equally serviceable with various fissile species as energy

sources, and tolerant of the buildup of fission and
corrosion products. The MSRE thus fulfilled its role
and demonstrated chemical compatibility of materials,
simple refueling and reprocessing of salts, and the
potential need for automated in-line analysis as part of
the operational controls system in molten-salt reactors.

1. INTRODUCTION

During the last two decades a great number of reactor
concepts have been proposed to fill the foreseeable
need for electric power toward the end of the century
and to conserve supplies. of fissionable materials. Of
these concepts, only a few remain of potential signifi-
cance to the nuclear economy. Foremost among this
group are the Liquid-Metal Fast Breeder (LMFBR), the
Gas-Cooled Fast Breeder (GCFBR), the Light Water
Breeder (LWBR), and the Molten-Salt Breeder (MSBR).

The initial efforts to develop the molten-salt system
began more than 20 years ago at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory. A detailed examination of the
program which followed is described in a series of
papers published early in 1970.! By 1964 development
of MSR’s had culminated in the construction and
operation of the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment
(MSRE) as a demonstration of the practicality of these
reactors. It was designed to employ, as nearly as was
feasible, the same materials that were proposed for use
in molten-salt breeder reactors. Thus the MSRE was
constructed to circulate uranium fuel as UF, dissolved
in a molten fluoride mixture within a Hastelloy N
circuit. The fuel mixture was pumped at a rate of 1200
gpm through a graphite core matrix contained in a
cylindrical core vessel (Fig. 1.1). Dry, deoxygenated
helium was supplied at 5 psig to the pump bowl. A flow
of this gas carried xenon and krypton out of the pump
bowl to charcoal beds.

When the reactor was operated at full power, fuel
entered the graphite core at 632°C (1170°F) and was
heated to 654°C (1210°F). The salt was then dis-
charged through the shell side of a tube and shell heat
exchanger, returning through a fuel inlet to the reactor
vessel. A coolant salt circulated through the heat
exchanger, through the air-cooled radiator to the
coolant pump, and back to the heat exchanger to
complete the circuit. At full power, the temperature of
the coolant salt varied from 546°C (1015°F) to 579°C
(1075°F) in this circuit. Design parameters of the
MSRE are summarized in comparison with those for
larger molten-salt reactors in Table 1.1. Here it is noted
that two fuel salt compositions were employed in the
MSRE. The reactor was operated initially with a 235U
fuel charge; the uranium from this charge was recovered

. and replaced with 233U for the latter period of reactor

operations. Nuclear characteristics of the MSRE with its

'235(J fuel charge are listed in Table 1.2.

‘From the inception of operations with the MSRE in
1965, the performance of the MSRE was positive
indication of the technical feasibility of molten-salt
reactors. The MSRE has shown that a molten-fluoride
reactor can be operated at temperatures above 1200°F
without attack on either the metal or graphite parts of
the system; that reactor equipment in the radioactive
parts of the plant can be repaired or replaced; and that
xenon can be stripped continuously from the fuel.

Operations with the MSRE were terminated as plan-
ned late in 1969. The reactor was operated for a
cumulative period of 13,172 equivalent full power
hours during the period of nuclear operations from
June 1, 1965, to December 12, 1969. A chronological

history of reactor operations is summarized in Fig. 1.2.
Detailed accounts of these operations are described in
the Molten-Salt Reactor Program semiannual progress
reports.

In operation, the MSRE employed three salt mix-

tures: fuel, coolant, and flush salt (that was used to
scavenge impurities from the fuel circuit and from
surfaces of the graphite moderator before and after the
fuel containment system was opened).

Fuel and coolant salts for use in the MSRE were
selected on the basis of considerations which are
discussed in detail in an earlier report.2 The fuel salt
consisted essentially of a carrier’ mixture into which
suitable amounts of fissile material could be dissolved
to produce fuel salt. The carrier was selected to be a

* mixture of "LiF-BeF,-ZtF, such as to provide the

optimum physical and chemical properties of the fuel
salt. Some of the criteria included in optimizing the
carrier composition were liquidus temperature, vis-
cosity, and zirconium (included to ensure that UO,
could not be precipitated from the molten fluoride
solution) concentration. The phase diagram of the
LiF-BeF,-Z1F, system®** shown in Fig. 1.3 illustrates
the options available for choice of carrier salt. The salt
composition selected on the basis of the considerations
mentioned was " LiF-BeF,-Z1F,4 (65-30-5 mole %).

An additional measure was adopted in the selection of
salt composition of the fuel to minimize the possibility
that troublesome deposits containing fissionable ma-
terial might segregate from the molten-fluoride fuel
solution. This was the choice to constitute the uranium
fuel charge of about two-thirds 232U and one-third
2351; it was based on chemical considerations, and
arose from uncertainty as to the probable value of the
oxidation-reduction potential that would prevail in the

fuel salt in normal operations. From Long and Blanken-
ship’s* results, it was concluded that the dispropor-
tionation of UF, would not proceed to the extent that
the amount of metallic uranium produced would
precipitate or cause problems by alloying with the fuel
salt containment system. If, for some reason, however,
the [U3*]/[ZU] concentration ratio were to rise above
50%, formation of uranium alloys and carbides was
foreseen as possible. This difficulty was recognized in
the inexactness of our information concerning the value
of the average total cation-anion balance that would
result from one fission event in the reactor environ-

ment. If the tendency was toward a slight excess of

cations, the potential for reduction of U** » U3* and
disproportionation was increased. Increasing the total
inventory of uranium would reduce proportionately the
rate of development of unfavorable [U*]/[ZU] con-
centration ratios. For these reasons, the choice was
made to specify that the concentration of uranium in
the fuel salt would be 0.9 mole %, even though <0.3
mole % -of highly enriched uranium would have been
sufficient to make the MSRE critical. Such measures, it
was shown, were overly conservative in affording
protection which it is recognized now was not essential.
Notwithstanding, they, like the meticulous operational
methods which were employed, comprise the margins
of safety which were appropriate to the experiment.
Under similar considerations, the coolant salt was
chosen as a mixture corresponding to the fuel composi-
tion but containing neither fissile material nor zir-
conium. Salt of the composition ?LiF-BeF, (66—34
mole %) was used both as the coolant and as the flush
salt.

Samples of the MSRE fuel mixture and (less fre-
quently) the coolant mixture were analyzed routinely
during all periods when salts were circulated in the
reactor. On each occasion of its use, the flush salt also
was analyzed. The concentrations of the salt constit-
uents, oxide contaminants, and fission product species

were monitored on a continuing basis. Chemical

analyses were performed regularly with samples re-
moved from the circulating salts in order to evaluate the
utility of a continuous surveillance program as well as
to fix goals for in-line analytical controls for future
molten-salt reactors. The MSRE provided the initial
experience in these respects; although a molten-salt
reactor, the Aircraft Reactor Experiment,’ previously
demonstrated the operability of molten-salt reactors,
the scheduled period of its operation was brief and did
not include a program of chemical analysis. For the
MSRE, however, we sought to demonstrate through a
long period of operation the stability of such reactors,

problems for long periods of time at high temperatures.
It was also our purpose to examine the possibility of
adapting those analytical chemical methods which
proved to be most successful with the MSRE to the
development of in-line methods for MSBR analysis and
control. Accordingly, our primary goals were to deter-
mine continually whether the concentration of uranium
in the fuel salt coincided with that expected from
reactor physics calculations and on-site neutronic

~ measurements, whether chemical evidence would indi-

cate that the salts remained free of oxide as a
contaminant, and to establish rates of corrosion. The
frequency of sampling was set at the beginning of
operations essentially to coincide with estimates of

reasonable maximum capability of the analytical labora-
tory, and was at first about one sample per shift,
decreasing in frequency as it became evident that no
serious problems were developing in relation to cor-
rosion and reactivity anomalies to one per day, three
per week, and in the final stages of MSRE operations to
once a week.

The results of chemical analyses have served as a good
measurement of the generalized corrdsion and have
provided a’ convincing demonstration of the compati-
bility of molten-fluoride fuels and coolants with Hastel-
loy N. Analyses of the changes in isotopic composition
of the plutonium and uranium in the fuel salt samples
established with good precision the average power
output of the reactor. Studies of the relation of *$Nb

disposition within the fuel system of the MSRE showed
that the distribution of the isotope within the system
reflects the oxidation-reduction potential of the salt in
such a manner that behavior of °*Nb in molten-salt
breeder reactors may be exploited as an in-line indicator
of potential corrosion.

Results of the chemical analyses performed in support

of MSRE operations comprise the basic data from
which various inferences can be made pertaining to the
performance of the MSRE. For example, those relating
to corrosion phenomena, power output, fuel stability,
fission product chemistry, and distribution of tritium
within the system have been judged on the basis of
results obtained in a program of chemical monitoring of
specimens removed from the MSRE. They comprise a
body of information which forms the basis for ranking
priorities in future research and development programs.
For these reasons, this report has been prepared to
include all of the available results of chemical analysis
which were obtained in connection with the operation
of the MSRE. Except for the correlations of the
disposition of *>Nb in the fuel salt in relation to the
oxidation-reduction potential of the salt, fission prod-
uct chemistry is omitted. Studies of the behavior of
fission products in the MSRE have been carried out by
F. F. Blankenship, S. S. Kirslis, E. G. Bohlmann, and
E. L. Compere. The results of their studies are described
in a report® which summarizes this aspect of the opera-
tional experience with the MSRE.

2. CHEMICAL BEHAVIOR IN THE FUEL
AND COOLANT SALT SYSTEMS
DURING PRENUCLEAR OPERATIONS

2.1 Preoperational Procedures

Three types of fluoride mixtures were prepared for
use in the MSRE: (1) a salt mixture of the approximate
composition ’ LiF-BeF,-ZrF4 (65-30-5 mole %), for use
as the fuel carrier; (2) another of the composition
TLiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %), for use as the coolant and
flush salts; and (3) ?LiF-238UF, and ’LiF-235UF,
(73-27 mole %) mixtures, for use in constituting the
initial fuel charge as well as for subsequent enrichment
of the fuel as required. A detailed description of the
methods employed is reported elsewhere.!

Late in 1964, the MSRE fuel and coolant salt systems
were heated to ~650°C and purged of moisture; the
fuel and coolant drain tanks were then charged with salt
of the composition 7 LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %), 2611 kg
in the coolant system and 4187 kg in the fuel system.
The coolant loop was filled on January 9, 1965, and on
January 12, 1965, flush salt was circulated in the fuel
loop for the first time.

After the operability of the equipment and the
cleanness of the system had been demonstrated, fuel
carrier salt (lacking enriched uranium) was charged into
fuel drain tank No. 2 (FD-2) beginning on April 21,
1965. The contents of 35 shipping containers (4560 kg
of salt) were melted and transferred to the drain tank.
To this was added 236 kg of ’LiF-UF, eutectic
containing 147 kg of 238U (depleted in 235U). Batch
containers were heated above the liquidus temperature
of the salt mixture in auxiliary furnaces and connected
by a small-diameter Inconel tube to the drain tank. The
connecting tube extended to the bottom of the batch
container so that the salt mixture could be transferred
as a liquid by controlling the differential gas pressure in
the two containers. All fill operations were accom-
plished in a routine manner without causing detectable
beryllium contamination of the reactor facilities.

The initial fuel loading of the MSRE required
approximately 75 ft® of fused fluorides having the
composition 7LiF-BeF,-ZrF4-UF, (65.0-29.2-5.0-0.83
mole %); fissionable 235U comprised about one-third of
the uranium inventory. To provide for an orderly
approach to critical operation of the reactor and to
facilitate fuel preparation, the fuel was produced from
 

the three salt mixtures described above. The enriched
fuel concentrate mixture, in which all 23%U was
combined with LiF as UF, 93% enriched in ?3%U, to
form the binary eutectic mixture (27 mole % UF,), was
prepared in six small batches (15 kg of 23°U each) for

10

nuclear safety and for planned incremental additions to

the reactor fuel system. The balance of the uranium
required for the fuel was provided as a chemically
identical mixture with UF, depleted of 235U. The
third component mixture, the barren fuel solvent,
consisted of the remaining constituents of the reactor
fuel and had the chemical composition 7 LiF-BeF,-ZrF,
(64.7-30.1-5.2 mole %). The reactor fuel for the

adding small increments of ’LiF-235UF, into this
carrier salt in the drain tanks and finally into the pump
bowl. The composition of the salt was fixed at this
point by the amount of 23% UF, required for criticality
to be sustained with one control rod completely
inserted.

The addition of the enriched fuel concentrate mixture
to the MSRE to within 1 kg of 235U of criticality was

accomplished during the latter part of May 1965. The

first major addition of enriched fuel concentrate con-
sisted of the transfer of about 44.17 kg.of 235U from
three containers directly into the fuel drain tank. Three
subsequent additions of 233U to the reactor drain tank
increased its 235U inventory to 59.35, 64.42, and
finally 68.76 kg. The transfer of less than batch-size
quantities of 235U was made by inserting the salt
transfer line to a predetermined depth in the batch

"container.

It was anticipated that the composition of the fuel at
this point would be LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-UF, (65.0-29.17-

 zero-power experiments was produced subsequently by -

flush and coolant salts were analyzed in the facilities of
the ORNL Analytical Chemistry Division prior to use in
the MSRE. Analytical results for the 61 batches of salt
used as flush salt and primary coolant are listed in Table
2.1. Although the nominal composition was ? LiF-BeF,
(63-34 mole %), the average composition as determined
by chemical analysis was "LiF-BeF, (63.56 + 0.005—
36.44 + 0.005 mole %). Examinations of the material
balance of the production operations indicate that the
disparity in composition was due to an analytical bias.

Efforts to determine whether such a bias actually

existed were made by the analytical chemists, but were
unfruitful.

Before salt was charged into the reactor, the drain
tanks and salt loop systems were carefully dried by
evacuating and purging with dry helium. A detailed

description of the procedures employed is given else-
where.? Thereafter, late in 1964, approximately 4187

kg of flush salt was charged into the fuel drain tank; it
was then transferred among the tanks in the drain tank
cell. These operations served to calibrate the weighing
devices, to check elevations and volumes, and to
establish the operating requirements of the freeze
valves. Throughout the prenuclear test period, speci-
mens of the circulating flush salt were obtained for
chemical and spectrochemical analysis. The results of
spectrochemical analysis are listed in Table 2.2; chemi-
cal analyses are listed in Table 2.3. Spectrochemical
data were of principal value to ensure that during the
early stages of operation the salt charge was free from
any unexpected cationic contaminants in the contain-

ment system. These analyses were very useful in that

they provided the assurance required, but with ex-

+ tended experience with the reactor they became of less

5.0-0.83 mole %); the composition calculated from the -

weights of the carrier and enriching salts added to the
reactor was changed steadily throughout the zero-power
experiments as capsules of the enriching salt were added
to the pump bowl. ’

Complete results of all analyses performed with
MSRE salts during the precritical and zero-power
experiments are summarized in the following sections
of this chapter.

2.2 Flush Salt

“ Part of the LiF-BeF, mixture which was furnished for
use in the MSRE was employed to flush the fuel system
initially and later, on occasions before and after
maintenance periods if it were likely that atmospheric
contaminants could have entered the system. Samples
of each of the batches of 7 LiF-BeF, mixtures for use as

significance and were discontinued.

The data shown in Table 2.3 suggest that the
operations connected with transfers of the flush salt
among the storage tanks in the drain tank cells in
November and December of 1964 did not introduce
appreciable amounts of structural metal contaminants
into the salt; the analytical results for iron suggest,
rather, that since its apparent concentration in the salt
samples removed from the drain tank was lower by
about one standard deviation than the average concen-
tration in the salt before use and in use, it was present
in the flush salt initially as metallic particulates which
were precipitated from the salt during this period. Little
or no change is evident in the chromium concentration
before circulation of the flush salt; the data in Table 2.3
can be interpreted, however, to indicate that after
completion of the flushing operations in January—
March 1965, the chromium analyses represent an

average final value of 60 ppm. If it is assumed that the
increase resulted from scavenging of moisture or oxides
from the system, one would anticipate a corresponding
increase of 12 ppm of oxygen in the salt (see Sect. 6.1).

Results of oxygen analyses of the flush salt exhibited
perplexing variance. The larger values are believed to
reflect adsorption of moisture inadvertently introduced
through the handling procedures after samples were

removed from the reactor. If the oxygen concentrations

were representative of either contamination of the salt
by water or oxidation of the container alloy by
atmospheric oxygen, the occurrence of chemical attack
on the Hastelloy N walls of the circuit should have been
reflected in increased concentrations of chromium in
the salt. For example, if an increase of oxide concentra-
tion in the order of 200 ppm were to have been caused
by such reactions, an equivalent increase in chromium
concentration of 60 ppm should have been observed.
To test whether a large bias might have been involved
in the fluorination assay of oxygen concentration (the
KBrF, method), large (50 g) samples of the salt were

obtained and analyzed by a newly developed method

which, like the purification procedures, depends on the
removal of water by sparging the molten salt with an
H,-HF stream. For the three samples that were ana-
lyzed in this manner, the average concentration found
was 75 ppm.

After the flush salt was drained from the reactor on
completion of the tests in which it was used, the flush

salt was reprocessed.®> The salt was transferred by gas
pressure to the fuel storage tank in the fuel reprocessing

system and sparged with a mixture of H, and HF. It'

was concluded from measurements of the HF concen-
tration in the off-gas stream that the reprocessing
operations were effective in removing 115 ppm of oxide
from the salt.®> The oxide concentration should have
been reduced by this process to the same concentration
which resulted from preparation and purification of the
salt, ~55 ppm.* The results of chemical analysis
indicated that the chromium concentration of the flush
salt increased by 43 ppm in use, corresponding to an
increase of 180 g of chromium, and equivalent to 55.5 g
of oxide, or to an increase of 13 ppm in oxide
concentration. The H,-HF analytical data indicated
that the average concentration of oxide in the flush salt
during its use was 75 ppm, or that the oxide concentra-
tion of the salt increased by 20 ppm in use. This
increase, while slightly greater than would have been
anticipated from the above discussion, may be ration-
alized by the following considerations. An indetermi-
nate fraction of the oxide removed in reprocessing was
introduced from the oxide scales present on the
surfaces of the chemical reprocessing facility containers,
the fuel storage tank, and the walls of the fuel circuit.
Prior purge of the system with dry inert gas was
performed before the facility was used for reprocessing

_ the flush salt, but the system was not previously flushed

with a scavenger salt. It might therefore have been
anticipated that the oxide concentration of the salt in
the reprocessing system, after its initial use, would yield
a higher concentration of oxide than that removed from
the salt in the fuel circulation system. Thus, if it is
assumed that in the reprocessing experiment ~0.4 kg of
oxide scale was removed from the system, good
agreement exists among the analytical data, except for
measurement of oxide concentration by the KBrF,
method.

One potential use of the flush salt that had been
anticipated was to remove any oxides. that might
deposit in the heat exchanger if the fuel salt were to
become seriously contaminated. Concurrent with the
beginning of MSRE operations, chemical data ap-
peared® which showed that the solubility of the least
soluble oxide in the LiF-BeF,-ZrF, carrier salt was

some three times that in LiF-BeF, mixtures. It was thus .

necessary to regard the flush salt as an agent which
might have limited capacity to scavenge oxide impu-
rities from the fuel circuit unless, if saturated, it were
reprocessed. Its principal function after initial use was
to remove residues containing uranium fluoride from

the fuel circuit after it was drained. Concurrently, the .

13

“capacity of the flush salt to contain dissolved oxides

increased with each use in the reactor, because the fuel
residues carried into the flush salt added about 2.5 kg
of zirconium to the salt each time it was used. It would
probably have questionable value if it were expedient to

~~ dissolve precipitated oxide deposits from the heat

exchanger. This did not preclude the use of LiF-BeF,
flush salt for such application, because at 650°C the
solubility of the saturating oxide phase, BeQ, in the salt
was known to be ~200 ppm, corresponding to a
capacity of the flush salt to dissolve and retain 1.135 kg
of ZrO, in solution at this temperature. Successive
repurification and removal of oxides that were picked

"up in the salt would permit it to be used to clear the

heat exchanger of an oxide plug if necessary. No such
requirement developed. A preferable alternative was

also available if needed. The increased solubility which

small amounts of zirconium fluoride provide, increasing
the oxide solubility to 800 ppm for a few mole percent
of Z1F,, showed that if it were expedient to do so, the
composition of the flush salt could have been changed
simply by the addition of "LiF-ZrF, so as to enhance
its solvent capacity for precipitated oxides.

Operation with the flush salt also shed light on
another aspect of the use of molten fluorides in a
circulating system, namely, the appearance of salt (or
salt constituents) in the cover gas. Analysis of the
helium cover gas by Million and Pappas (see Sect. 2.4.5)
indicated the presence of fluorides in the fuel off-gas,
but this probably represented salt droplets rather than
any decomposition product.

The principal difference in the design of the fuel and
coolant pumps is that the fuel pump contains a spray
ring which functions to remove fission product gases
from the fuel. The major salt flow into the pump tank
is through a bypass that is taken from the volute
discharge line into a toroidal spray ring in the upper
part of the pump bowl. From there the salt sprays out
through two rows of holes and impinges on the salt
surface in the tank to provide gas-liquid contact for gas
stripping.® This difference in design of the two pumps
seems to account for the fact that it was occasionally
necessary to remove solids from filters, valves, and lines
in the fuel system, but rarely necessary with the coolant
system. Material recovered from the coolant off-gas
system showed only traces of salt constituents, but the
fuel off-gas solids generally contained minute beads of
frozen salt.

One experiment conducted during the precritical
operation period consisted of krypton stripping tests.
For these tests, a special insert was installed into the
side of the off-gas flange nearest to the fuel pump bowl.

Fig. 2.1. Fluoride glass beads removed from MSRE off-gas line after precritical experiment PC-1.

Later, the flange was opened to remove the insert;
inspection showed that small amounts of small glassy
beads were deposited between the flange faces.

Toward the end of the first set of experiments with
flush salt, fuel pressure control became erratic (see
Chap. 11). After the salt was drained from the circuit in
March 1965, the gas pressure control valve far down-
stream at the vent house was found to be partially
plugged. The valve body was rinsed with acetone, which
was found to contain beads (1 to 5 u in diameter) of a
glassy material.

After a week of carrier salt circulation in May 1965,
the small control valve again began to plug. This time, it
was removed and cut open for examination. A deposit
on the stem was found to be about 20% amorphous
carbon, and the remainder was 1- to 5-u beads having
the composition of the flush salt. A photograph of
these beads, obtained with the petrographic micro-
scope, is shown in Fig. 2.1. The glass beads were found
to have a refractive index of 1.315. As computed by
interpolation of the refractive indices of the crystalline
components LiF and BeF,, its composition would be

LiF-BeF, (54-45 mole %). Chemical analysis showed,
however, that its actual composition was LiF-BeF,
(66-34 mole %). The anomalous refractive index of the

. glass results from its glassy character; that is, the liquid

phase at LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) is of significantly

lower density than the crystalline solids of this compo-

sition. ‘The beads were glass rather than crystalline,
implying rapid cooling of the molten-salt mist. The
carbon was presumably soot from oil that had been
thermally decomposed in the pump bowl.

2.3 Coolant Salt

The coolant salt mixtures for use in the MSRE were

prepared as described elsewhere.! Twenty-four batches

of the salt mixture were allocated for use as the
coolant. The composition and purity of these mixtures
are listed in Table 2.4. A charge of 2610 kg of

_ "LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %) was delivered in molten.

form to the coolant drain tank in October 1964. The
coolant system was preheated and purged of moisture
in" a similar manner to the fuel system, but was not

preflushed with molten salt. The system was filled and
drained 18 times during the time the MSRE was
operated. The chemical behavior of the coolant salt was
not noticeably different during prenuclear operations
from those that followed, and will be described in detail
later in this report.

2.4 Fuel Salt

2.4.1 Onsite preparation. After circulation in the
reactor in March 1965, the flush salt was drained to fuel
drain tank FD-1. The fuel salt was then constituted

within the reactor. The "LiF-BeF,-Z1F, fuel carrier -

mixture was charged into fuel drain tank FD-2, starting
April 21, 1965. On-site records show that 4558.1 kg
(the contents of 35 shipping containers) of this carrier
salt was melted and transferred to the drain tank; to
this was added 236.2 kg of "LiF-238UF,, containing

© 147.6 kg of 238U (depleted in >35U). In our current

review of the significance of the results of chemical and
mass spectrochemical analyses, it becomes evident that
these values are in minor error. The "LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-
238YF, as described above was circulated through the
fuel circuit for some 250 hr during precritical test PC-2.

Each of the two fuel drain tanks on the MSRE
incorporates two pneumatic weigh cells for estimating
the inventory of the salt in these tanks. Calibrations of
the weigh cells in the drain tanks were made carefully
during the initial stages of operations. The precision of
these measurements was found to be about +0.8% (+28
kg).” Continued experience with this equipment indi-
cated long-term drifts in the readings. It was necessary,
therefore, to determine inventories on the basis of
analytical chemical data, and on computations involving
salt densities and volumes at certain reference points
(the circulating loops filled to the pump bowls or the
tanks filled to the level probe points) to eliminate the
effects of extraneous forces on the indicated weight.®

During the initial fill operations, ? LiF-BeF, flush salt
was admitted to all parts of the fuel circuit system. On
draining the reactor, flush salt remained on the pump
rotor and in the freeze valves, as well as residue in the
heat exchanger. At this point, some 35 kg of salt was
unaccounted for by the weigh cell data and was
presumed to have remained in these locations. The
TLiF-BeF,-Z1F,-232 UF, salt mixture was introduced
into the same circuitry at the beginning of the PC-2 test
and was, therefore, diluted slightly by flush salt. Later
in this report, it is shown that the increased concentra-
tion of uranium in the flush salt after use indicates that
the salt residue left in the fuel circuit system after it is
drained is about 20 kg. Estimation of the nominal
concentration of uranium in the fuel during precritical
test PC-2 thus requires the assumption that ~20 kg of
flush salt was added initially to the fuel. As noted in
Sect. 2.42, however, the best agreement between
expected and observed concentration is found when it
is assumed that a negligible amount of flush salt residue
remained in the system at completion of PC-2. This
assumption is untenable. An alternate assumption, that
less carrier salt was delivered to the reactor than was
credited in the loading operation, is more credible as an
explanation of the apparent anomaly.

Chemical analyses were conducted during the precriti-
cal experiments for the purpose of establishing analyt-
ical base lines for use in the full-power operating period.
Prior to the zero-power experiment, analyses of all salt
samples were conducted with conventional equipment
in the facilities of the ORNL Analytical Chemistry
Division. Thereafter, the fission product activity made
it necessary to perform all analyses in the ORNL
High-Radiation-Level Analytical Laboratory (HRLAL).
The facilities of this laboratory have been described
elsewhere.’ In order to provide continuity which would
relate the results of prenuclear operations with those
that followed, specimens of the fuel salt obtained

 
 

 

 

during the precritical test period were analyzed concur-

‘rently in both facilities.

Mass spectrometric analyses were performed routinely
throughout 235-2381 operations. Samples of the fuel
salt were analyzed before, during, and at the comple-

“tion of the 23%U loading operation. The results

reflected the’ isotopic dilution of 238U precisely and
were used in tests for corroboration of the agreement

16

between estimated and analytical values of the concen-

tration of uranium in the fuel salt and to refine
estimates of the amount of depleted uranium that was
charged into the fuel system.

The composition of the fuel salt was changed steadily
throughout the zero-power experiments (run No. 3) as
capsules of the enriching salt were added to the pump
bowl. Compositional analysis during this period served,
therefore, to permit evaluation of the fuel composition
dynamically rather than as a statistical base for ref-
erence during the power run.

Most of the uranium required for enrichment was
loaded in four charging operations to one of the fuel
drain tanks, FD-2. After each addition the salt was
transferred to the second drain tank and back again to
ensure thorough mixing. The mixed salt was loaded into
the reactor system after each charging operation, and
count rate data were taken at several salt levels in the
core and with the reactor vessel full. These data were

© compared with the barren-salt data to monitor the

neutron multiplication and to establish the size of the
next addition.!® Extrapolation of inverse-count-rate
plots with the reactor vessel full showed that the
loading after the fourth addition was within 0.8 kg of
235U of the critical loading when the salt was not
circulating and the control rods were withdrawn to
their upper limits. The remainder of the 235U was
added directly to the circulating loop with enriching
capsules. These were inserted into the fuel-pump bowl
via the sampler-enricher to increase the loading by 85 g
of uranium at a time. Count rates were measured after
each capsule with the fuel pump off and the control
rods withdrawn. The reactor became critical after the
eighth capsule with the pump off, two rods fully
withdrawn, and one rod poisoning 0.03 of its available
worth.

These zero-power experiments (run 3) were com-
pleted on July 4, 1965, after 764 hr of circulation of
the salt. The fuel was then drained and mixed with the
salt remaining in the drain tanks. After the fuel loop
was drained, it was filled with flush salt, which was
circulated 1.3 hr, sampled, and drained. Analysis of the
flush salt led to the conclusion that 0.77 kg of uranium
remained in the fuel circuit on completion of run No. 3.

Final preparations were made for operation of the
reactor at power. In December 1965, low-power experi-
ments were begun. As soon as containment testing was
finished, the instruments, controls, and equipment were
given the check-outs required prior to startup. The fuel
system was then heated, and flush salt was circulated
for three days. Samples of the flush salt were taken.
Then fuel was charged to the loop for tests in the
reactor at various low power levels, 100 and 500 kW
and finally 1 MW. The experiments that were con-
ducted during this time extended over a one-month
period, providing the single period of operation when
the composition of the fuel salt remained nominally
constant.

Samples of the fuel salt were obtained regularly
during this period in a continuing effort to appraise the
utility of the chemical surveillance program and in
order to verify that the reactor system was in suitable
condition for the initiation of power operations. Good
agreement between anticipated and observed results was

found. The results of chemical analyses indicated that

the system had remained free of corrosion during all
preliminary operations, and it seemed that the analyses
would serve as a reliable measure of fuel stability and
corrosion.

2.4.2 Uranium assay. Chemical analyses and on-site
nuclear measurements were accumulated regularly when
fuel salt was circulated in the reactor in order to
evaluate as many aspects of the behavior of the molten
radioactive fuel salt as feasible in contact with the
Hastelloy N containment system and with the graphite
moderator. A number of important characteristics of
the reactor soon became evident. For example, by the
time that statistically significant populations of analyti-
cal chemical data were produced from the HRLAL it
had become apparent that on-site neutronic measure-
ments of the reactivity balance were sufficiently sensi-
tive to detect changes of as little as 0.1% in the
concentration of fissile material circulating in the fuel
system.!! This represented at least a factor of 10
greater sensitivity than was indicated by the statistically
significant results of chemical analysis. In addition,
reactivity balance measurements were made dynami-
cally and, essentially, on a continuous basis. While
chemical data alone were useful as statistical indicators
of trends in the concentration of uranium over ex-
tended periods, the combined results of chemical and
mass spectrometric analyses furnished information that
was uniquely suited for use in establishing numerous
fundamental values for use in subsequent evaluations of
MSRE performance, and in accounting for the changes
in the distribution of uranium between the fuel and
flush salt systems.

In order to compare the concentration of uranium in

the fuel salt as measured analytically with expected
values, we have evaluated the results of chemical
analysis, mass spectrometric analysis, the weights of the
fluorides as measured in the production facility, and
on-site measurements of the weights of the salt con-
tainers delivered to the MSRE. From the weights of the
enriching salts credited to the reactor and from the
isotopic composition a uranium material balance was
computed. Progress reports for this period of MSRE
operations indicate that satisfactory agreement between
nominal and analytical values was found. As the results
of mass spectrometric analyses were accumulated,
however, comparisons of the nominal isotopic composi-
tion of uranium during initial loading operations at the
MSRE with the results of mass spectrometric analyses
disclosed that closest agreement is reached when the
assumption is made that the initial ? LiF-238 UF, charge
contained 145.6 kg of uranium rather than 147.6 kg as
credited (see below). This lesser amount of uranium,
carried by 234.5 kg of "LiF->*® UF, enriching salt and

added to the amount of. "LiF-BeF,-Z1F, carrier salt
credited to the MSRE (4558.1 kg), would produce a
salt mixture in which the concentration of uranium is
3.038 wt %.

The average concentration observed was 3.044 wt %.
In the early stages of analysis, a bias of —0.8% was
discovered in the amperometric data’? which, when
used to correct the analytical results, causes the average
observed concentration in precritical run No. 2 to be
3.068 wt %. Thus the nominal concentration of
uranium in the fuel salt is inexplicably lower than the
averages of the observed values if the amount of carrier
salt credited to the MSRE (4558.1 kg) is assumed to be
accurate. A computation of the material balance for the
MSRE fuel salt in prepower tests, using this value, is
summarized in Table 2.5, which shows that the analyti-
cal values tend to indicate slightly greater average
concentrations than nominal. If, however, we assume
that ~40 kg of the carrier salt was not charged into the
fuel circuit, and the fuel charge during the precritical
experiment was constituted from 145.60 kg of uranium

and 4754.5 kg of salt, the nominal concentration of
uranium should be 3.062 wt %, as compared with an
analytical value of 3.068 wt %. Comparably improved
agreement is found between the nominal and observed
concentrations: of uranium for all other prepower
measurements when the assumption is made that the
above quantities of uranium and salt were charged to
the MSRE fuel system. A uranium material balance for
the prepower period was computed on the basis of
these values, ‘and is given in Table 2.6. We deduce,
therefore, that the salt charge which was used for the
precritical test, PC-2, consisted of 145.6 kg 23%U in a
total salt charge of 4754.5 kg. The results of the
chemical analyses performed with samples of the fuel
salt during this test are listed in Table 2.7. Most of the

uranium required for enrichment was loaded in four

charging operations to one of the fuel drain tanks,
FD-2. Samples. of the fuel salt were obtained frequently
during this period in a continuing attempt to appraise
the utility of the chemical surveillance program, and to

18

verify that the reactor system was in suitable condition
for the initiation of power operation.

As the concentration of uranium in the fuel salt was
increased in preparation for operating the reactor at full
power, fuel-salt samples were obtained for isotopic and
compositional analysis after groups of three or four
capsules of enriching salt were added. Changes in the
isotopic composition of uranium in the fuel salt during
initial loading operations are summarized in Table 2.8.
Compositional analyses were obtained over a period
when the incremental change in the concentration of
uranium in the fuel salt was large in comparison to that
in the normal operating mode of the reactor. They
serve, therefore, to permit evaluation of the fuel
composition dynamically rather than as a statistical
base for reference during the power run. The results of
these analyses are listed in Tables 2.9 and 2.10.

As noted previously, the salt mixture used in the
precritical test, PC-2, was formed from purified salt
mixtures of the nominal compositions ? LiF-BeF,-ZrF,

(64.7-30.1-5.2 mole %) and "LiF-UF, (73-27 mole %).
The results of chemical analyses of the individual
batches of these salts are listed in Tables 2.11 and 2.12.
Results of the analyses of the carrier salt indicate that
its composition was ? LiF-BeF,-ZrF4 (62.25-32.47-5.28
mole %), or that the Li/Be ratio is skewed as noted
previously in connection with the coolant and flush
salt. While the results from chemical analyses show

similar bias in determination of lithium and beryllium -

when compared with nominal values, they are in good
agreement when the analyses of the salts are compared
with those for the starting materials. Reexamination of
the material balance in the preparation of these salts
indicated that deviations from the nominal composi-
tions are much less than is indicated by the analytical
data.!3® In order to estimate how closely the composi-
tion of the fuel-salt mixture matched the design
composition, it is necessary to compare the analytical
results with a nominal composition computed from the
analyses of production plant samples. The composition
of the salt mixture used in the precritical run compares
as shown in Table 2.13 with the nominal composition
which would result from (1) combining the carrier salt

and LiF-23%UF, of the design compositions and (2)

combining compositions as indicated from chemical
analysis.

In the foregoing discussion, we have estimated the
quantities of carrier salt and LiF-UF, mixtures used to
constitute the MSRE fuel for power tests. The chemical
composition of the salt circulated in the fuel circuit at
various stages during the zero power and in all
prenuclear operations is compared with the results of
chemical analyses in Tables 2.14 and 2.15. The values
listed in these tables coincide within the precision limits
of the analytical chemical results, the mass spec-
trometric methods, and the estimates of the physical
properties of these fluids. We have therefore adopted
the nominal compositions listed in Table 2.15 as
reference compositions for appraisal of results through-
out the remainder of MSRE operations.

2.4.3 Structural metal impurities. One of the features
which originally suggested the potential feasibility of
 molten-salt reactors was the recognition that if the
physical and mechanical properties of any one of
several nickel-based alloys, such as those composed
principally of Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe, were suitable for reactor
construction, the alloys would almost certainly be

compatible with molten-fluoride mixtures. This recogni-
tion developed from the fact that numerous metal
fluorides were more stable than the fluorides of these
alloy constituents and could be used for fuel and
coolant mixtures. By the time conceptual plans for the
MSRE were formulated, an, alloy of this type was
developed at ORNL specifically for application in
molten-salt reactor systems, and is now designated as
Hastelloy N. Its average composition is 70Ni-16Mo-
7Cr-7Fe-0.05C wt %. The selection of salt constituents
with respect to their compatibility with such alloys has

been reviewed by Grimes'® and does not require

- further elaboration here.

Values for the standard free energies of formation of
the structural metal fluorides, CtF,, FeF,, and NiF,,
signify that, as impurities in the reactor salts, iron and
nickel should be present in metallic form.

In the molten-salt reactor fuel salt, the fluid contains
small amounts of UF, generated in the equilibrium
reaction Cr’ + 2UF,= 2UF; + CIF,. In power
operations with the MSRE the concentration of UF;
was adjusted occasionally by in-situ generation of U3*

in the salt or by addition of FeF, as an oxidant.
Generally, an effort was made to limit the [U*"}/[ZU]
ratio to ~0.01 as a means of retarding the corrosion
reaction. :

The reaction Cr° + 2UF, = 2UF; + CIF, has an
equilibrium constant with a small degree of temperature
dependence. Since the equilibrium constant increases
with temperature, operation of a loop with a significant
temperature gradient causes the chromium concentra-
tion of the alloy surface that is at high temperature to
decrease, transferring metal to the cooler regions. Since
chromium comprises a small fraction of Hastelloy N
and its availability to the salt is diffusion limited,
attainment of equilibrium by this reaction is very slow.

In prenuclear operations with -nonuraniferous salts,
the salt loops were operated in essentially isothermal

conditions. Under these conditions, corrosion of the -

circuit walls could arise only from contaminants.

"In all the activities associated with the startup of the
MSRE, stringent measures were taken to remove all
traces of moisture from the newly constructed system
and to prevent subsequent introduction of impurities.

During October and November 1964, the fuel system
was readied for use; it was purged of moisture, heated
to 650°C, and tested for leak tightness. The purge gas
was high-purity helium. To ensure that it was free of
oxygen and moisture in use, the gas flowed through a
series of dryers and preheaters and through hot tita-
nium sponge before it entered the reactor.

From the results of analyses of the individual salt
batches produced for use in the MSRE (see Tables 2.11
and 2.12) the average concentrations of Cr, Fe, and Ni
in the blended salt charge (" LiF-BeF,-ZrF4-2 38 UF,) at
the beginning of the precritical experiment PC-2 should

"have been 21, 99, and 14 ppm respectively. The salt

samples removed from the fuel pump during this test
were supplied to the ORNL General Analytical Labora-
tory (GAL) as well as to the HRLAL so the overlapping
results would show whether slight biases might result as
new equipment and necessary modifications in methods
were employed. As determined by the GAL, the average
concentrations of structural metal impurities in the

"PC-2 fuel circuit salt were Cr: 19, Fe: 99, Ni: 23 ppm,

while from the HRLAL, the average concentrations
were found to be Cr: 37, Fe: 163, Ni: 34 ppm (Table
2.7). Following run PC-2, "LiF->35UF, enriching salt
was added to the carrier salt to constitute the final
235Y fuel mixture. The average concentrations of the
impurities on completion of this experiment as deter-.
mined by the HRLAL were Cr: 37, Fe: 148, Ni: 55
ppm (Table 2.7).

With extended experience, we learned that one
standard deviation for Cr analysis was ~7 ppm; there-
fore, the difference in chromium concentration as
measured in the two laboratories can be regarded as a
bias correction — that is, HRLAL results could be
expected to average about 18 ppm higher than those
from the GAL.

On completion of the fueling operation in July 1965,
the reactor was drained and flushed. Radiation levels
were low enough to permit maintenance and installa-
tion work to begin immediately in all areas, in
preparation for high-power operation. In August 1965,

- the assembly of graphite and Hastelloy N surveillance

specimens, which had been in the core from the
beginning of salt operation, was removed. While the
reactor vessel was open, inspection revealed that pieces
were broken from the horizontal graphite bar that
supported the sample array. The pieces were recovered
for examination, and a new sample assembly, designed
for exposure at high power and suspended from above,

was installed. The fuel-pump rotary element was re-

moved in a final rehearsal of remote maintenance and
to permit inspection of the pump internals. It was
reinstalled after inspection showed the pump to be in
very good condition.

Tests had shown that the heats of Hastelloy N used in
the reactor vessel had poor high-temperature rupture
life and ductility in the as-welded condition. Since the
vessel closure weld had not been heat treated, the entire
vessel was heated to 760°C (1400°F) for 100 hr, using
the installed heaters, to improve these properties.

The experience which was developed with the MSRE
throughout the shakedown period preceding power
operations confirmed that the molten-fluoride salt
mixtures were intrinsically noncorrosive: to Hastelloy N
and that effective procedures were employed to prevent
serious contamination of the salt circuits during this
period.

‘By December, maintenance and modifications were
completed, and flush salt was circulated through the
fuel system for a period of three days. On December
20, 1965, the fuel salt was loaded into the system, and
the zero-power experiment began. On completion of

this period the concentrations of the structural metal
impurities had average values of Cr: 48 + 7, Fe: 131
65, Ni: "40 + 20 ppm. Here, for the first time, there was
evidence that an increase in the concentration of
chromium in the fuel-salt mixture had taken place. As
will be noted later, such increases followed a regular
pattern, occurring almost exclusively after periods of
maintenance when the reactor was opened to the
ambient atmosphere for some period of time. It now
seems that circulation of the flush salt for periods of
only a few days was insufficient to negate the effect of
the exposure completely.

2.4.4 Oxide contaminants. Among the summary
reports on various aspects of MSRE operations, no

.separate review of analytical chemical developments is

included. Except for a few analyses, for example, for
oxide and for lithium, the methods in the ORNL Master
Analytical Manual were employed routinely and found
to be satisfactory. In response to the need for improved
methods for determination of the concentration of
oxides in the MSRE salts, a reliable and accurate
method was devised and applied concurrent with early
MSRE operations. This development was an important
aspect of MSRE chemical development and is therefore
described in detail here.

Long before operations with the MSRE were started
it was demonstrated in laboratory tests that precipita-
tion of oxide as the saturating phase in the molten fuel,
flush, or coolant salt was very unlikely. However,
assurance that the concentration of oxide as a con-
taminant of these salts was not increasing could not be
obtained from initial measurements using conventional
methods. Many of the results of early analyses of
MSRE flush and carrier salts were anomalous, as shown
in Tables 2.2, 2.7, and 2.9. At face value, the analytical
data shown in these tables might suggest that the
concentration of oxide in the samples examined ranged
sporadically from 100 to 4000 ppm. If real, the higher
values would represent the presence of more than 0.5%
Z10, in the specimens. Each of the 52 specimens
obtained for analysis during precritical run No. 2 and
during the zero-power experiment was subjected to

~ petrographic examination. With the carrier and LiF-
BeF, salt, the sensitivity for detection of well-formed
crystals .of ZrO, by the petrographic methods is well
below 100 ppm; neither crystalline ZrO, nor oxy-
fluorides were found to be present in any of the
specimens examined. ~

The sampling procedures employed at the MSRE
effectively protected salt specimens from contact with
 

 

®

w)

¥)

moisture up to the point where they were transferred
into a transport container; subsequent handling proce-
dures, however, were not so stringent and are presumed
to have allowed moisture to contact the surfaces of the
fluoride specimens on occasion. Beryllium fluoride and
LiF-BeF, glassy phases are hygroscopic. Crystallization
of each of the MSRE salt mixtures can produce minute
quantities of these phases; typical sampling conditions
effect rapid cooling of the samples and are therefore
even more conducive toward the production of the
hygroscopic phases than equilibrium crystallization of
the salt mixtures. These hygroscopic phases, once
moistened, cannot be redried completely by ordinary

.desiccants at room temperature. The anomalously high

values for oxide analyses during the early stages of
MSRE operations are thus indicative of exposure of the
salt samples to moisture-laden atmospheres.

An effort was initiated to develop improved methods
for oxide analysis that would be adaptable for use in
the HRLAL. After a study of several methods which
might have application under conditions such as those
which prevailed in the HRLAL and where no provision
for atmospheric control in the hot cells was made, the
analytical chemists'® concluded that a hydrofluorina-
tion-transpiration method based on the reaction 0% +
2HF(g) = H,0(g) + 2F~ was potentially the most
useful. Their development of the new method is
described in the following paragraphs.

In principle, the amount of water evolved from
purging a molten-salt sample with an H,-HF gas
mixture would serve as a measure of the quantity of
oxide in the molten-salt sample. Since the water evolved
and the HF consumed are both proportional to the
amount of oxide present, either compound would serve
as an indicator species. Water monitoring methods were
selected because of their greater convenience and
reliability than those for HF.

The application. of this method to the analysis of
radioactive samples required the development of (1) a
sampling technique which minimized atmospheric con-
tamination, (2) the incorporation of a water-measure-
ment technique which was convenient for hot-cell
operations, and (3) the fabrication of a compact
apparatus for conserving the limited space available in
the hot cells. It was necessary to adapt the sampling
techniques from methods already developed to obtain
samples for wet analysis. By using a copper ladle of
nearly the same dimensions as the enriching capsules,
approximately 50-g samples were obtained which could
be transported in the existing transport container.
Exposure to the atmosphere was minimized by remelt-
ing and hydrofluorinating the entire sample in the

27

sample ladle. The ladle was sealed in a nickel-Monel
hydrofluorinator, with a delivery tube spring-loaded
against the surface of the frozen salt. Before the salt
was melted, the apparatus was purged with a hydro-
fluorinating gas mixture to remove water from the inner
surface of the hydrofluorinator and from the exposed
surface of the salt. As the sample was melted, the
‘delivery tube was driven to the bottom of the ladle by
spring action for efficient purging of the salt.

In all preliminary tests the water in the effluent purge
gas was measured by Karl Fischer titration. While the
Karl Fischer reagent was shown to be remarkably stable
to radiation, the titration would have been excessively
difficult to perform routinely in the hot cell. As an
alternative, an electrolytic moisture monitor was
adapted for these measurements. Since such equipment
is subject to interference and damage from HF,! 7 it was
practical to include a sodium fluoride column in the
effluent gas train. In operation at about 90°C it
removed HF from the effluent gas without significant
holdup of water.

A schematic flow diagram of the apparatus installed
in the HRLAL is shown in Fig. 2.2. The apparatus is
pictured in Fig. 2.3. A modular design was selected to
facilitate any changes found necessary during com-
ponent testing and to permit necessary repairs in the
hot cell. Except for the hydrofluorination furnace, all
hot-cell components were contained within a cubical
compartment, 16 in. on a side.

Samples of the flush and fuel salt taken during the
December startup of the reactor were analyzed for
oxide. Table 2.16 summarizes the results. Figure 2.4 is a
recording of the data output from analysis of the first
fuel-salt sample taken after the fuel was loaded into the
reactor. The results of the analyses by the hydro-
fluorination method were in good agreement with those
by the KBrF, procedure. The KBrF, values paralleled
the trends shown by the hydrofluorination method but

averaged slightly higher. This bias was not unexpected,

since the pulverized samples required for the KBrF,

method were easily contaminated by atmospheric mois-

ture. Subsequently, 50-g fuel-salt samples were taken at
various power levels from zero to full power. With an
in-cell radiation monitor, the initial sample read 30 R at
1 ft. This activity increased to 1000 R at 1 ft at the
full-power level. Results of the oxide analyses are given
in Table 2.17.

The oxide in the coolant salt sample, 25 ppm, is, for
practical considerations, identical with a value of 38
ppm obtained for a coolant salt sample taken on
January 25, 1966, and analyzed in the laboratory after
three weeks’ storage. The fuelsalt analyses are in
reasonable agreement with the samples analyzed in the
development laboratory before the reactor was oper-
ated at power. The oxide concentration in these
nonradioactive samples seemed to decrease gradually
from 106 to 65 ppm. Between the FP-6 and FP-7 series
the sampler-enricher station was opened for mainte-
nance, and thus the apparent increase in oxide concen-
tration (ca. 15 ppm) may represent contamination of

at ‘the time sufficient to establish the precision of the

the remaining samples for which analyses were started 6

to 10 hr after sampling, no significant loss of oxygen is.

indicated. A more direct method of establishing the
validity of these results by measuring the recovery of a
standard addition of oxide was used in subsequent
operations. A’ tin capsule containing a known amount
of Sn0O, was heated to 550°C in the hydrofluorinator
as hydrogen passed through the system. The SnO, was
reduced to the metal, and the water that was formed
passed on to the electrolysis cell. Two standard samples
of SnO, were analyzed after a four-month interim, and
oxide recoveries of 96.1 and 95.6% were obtained.

‘The slight negative bias was attributed to momentary
interruptions in the flow of the hydrofluorinator
effluent gas through the water electrolysis cell. Diffi-
culty - with cell plugging was encountered throughout

the period of development of the oxide method. As an

attempt to eliminate the negative bias and also to
provide a replacement cell for the remote. oxide
apparatus, it was deemed necessary to find a method of
regenerating the electrolysis cell that would permit a
steady gas flow at relatively low flow rates.

The water electrolysis cell contains partially hydrated
P, 0; in the form of a thin viscous film in contact with
two spirally wound 5-mil rhodium electrode wires. The
wires are retained on the inside of an inert plastic tube
forming a 20-mil capillary through which the sample
passes. The 2-ft-long tubing element is coiled in a helix
inside of a %-in.-diam pipe and potted in plastic for
permanence.

During the course of the investigation of the cell, it
was found that a wet gas stream in itself did not cause

the electrolysis cell to plug. It was also necessary for
the oxide content, 59 ppm, is comparable with that of

current to be flowing through the cell for flow
interruptions to occur. This indicated that the hydrogen
and oxygen evolving from the electrodes create bubbles
in the partially hydrated P, Os film, which then grow in
size sufficiently to bridge the capillary and form an
obstructing film.

After many unsuccessful approaches, an acceptable
solution to the problem was obtained by means of a
special regenerating technique which employed dilute
acetone solutions of H;PO, as the regenerating solu-
tions. This provided a desiccant: coating sufficient to
absorb the water in the gas stream and gave a minimal
amount of flow interruptions during electrolysis. The
cells were thereafter successfully regenerated in this

manner and yielded oxide recoveries of 99.6 + 1.3%

from standard SnO, samples.

2.4.5 Analysis of helium cover gas. As noted in Sect.

2.4.4, a reliable means for the determination of oxide in

the fuel salt did not exist when the initial experiments
with the MSRE began. The results of the oxide analyses
were perplexing, and they were almost certainly invalid
as indicators of contamination by moisture, since the
concentrations of structural metal contaminants in the
salt remained essentially constant. In order to obtain
some direct assurance that negligible inleakage of
moisture was occurring in the fuel system, temporary
measures were devised and applied. The method con-
sisted in bleeding off a small flow of the helium gas in
the pump bowl and passing it through a monitoring
system in the high-bay area.

Mean values for the concentration of HF in the
helium cover gas were obtained during the PC-2 and
 

 

>]

zero-power experiments by adaptation of a continuous
internal electrolysis analyzer for gaseous fluorides.
Through the cooperation of ORGDP personnel, data
were obtained regularly throughout prenuclear opera-
tions. The results showed that HF was evolved from the
salt at a maximum mean value of 150 to 200 ug/liter.! ®
The validity of this value is somewhat questionable
because of the probable positive bias that particulate
fluorides would contribute. The results are, therefore,
conservative to an indeterminate degree, but correspond

31

to the introduction of no more than 1 ppm of oxide

into the salt per day through the reaction
2H,0 + ZrF, = ZrO, + 4HF s

an amount which would escape detection by other
methods.

2.4.6 Lithium analysis. In Sect. 2.4.2 we noted that
chemical analyses of the fuel salt routinely indicated
that Be/Li ratios were significantly greater than for the
nominal composition of the salt. A careful examination
of the results for all the salt mixtures prepared for use
in the MSRE shows that if it is assumed that the
analytical results are correct for beryllium in the
coolant and flush salts, for beryllium and zirconium in
the carrier salt, and for uranium in the LiF-UF, salt
mixtures, and if a correction factor of 5 to 6% is added

to each of the results of lithium analyses, the average

results of composition analyses nearly coincide with
nominal values.

When this disparity was first noted, a reexamination
of the production records was made but did not
disclose any disparity in the material balances that
would account for the anomaly in Be/Li results.
Evidence from the purification-plant inventory data
indicated that the composition of the salt delivered into
the reactor system was of the design composition, 66.0
+ 0.25 mole % LiF, 34.0 + 0.25 mole % BeF,. A sample
of the MSRE coolant, taken from one of the batches
loaded into the reactor, showed a liquid-solid phase
transition temperature of 457.6°C; this is within 0.1°C
of the temperature of the equilibrium liquid-solid
reactions which can occur in LiF-BeF, mixtures richer
than ~33 mole % LiF. Chemical analyses of this
material indicated its composition to be LiF-BeF,
(63.63-36.37 mole %). The thermal data indicated,
however, that the material contained at least 65.5 mole
% LiF, and thus confirmed the composition indicated
by the weights of the materials used in its preparation.

Application of the same correction factor to the

match of analytical results with nominal values; we
must conclude therefore that a negative bias of 5 to 6%
existed in the lithium results. Lithium was determined
in the MSRE salt samples by flame spectrophotometric
methods. The results are compared with calibrated
standards, and regarded by the analytical chemists to
match satisfactorily with these standards. However, in
view of the coincidence of values which results when a
correction of ~5% is applied to the results, we must
infer that a negative bias of that magnitude affected the
MSRE results.

The lithium used to produce the salt charges for the
MSRE was selected from stockpiled LiOH in which the
SLi had been depleted to 0.01% or less. Assays were
available on each batch of LiOH; these analyses served
as criteria for selection of the material used.!?-2% The
assays of the batches of LiOH which were to be used
for the MSRE ranged from 0.0072 to 0.0085% °Li,
with the average of the batches which were to be used
for the flush salt and the fuel carrier salt as 0.0074%.
After each conversion of hydroxide to the fluoride,
the lithium in each product batch was again assayed
before the LiF was used to make up the coolant, flush,
or carrier salt. The assays of the batches of LiF used to
make up the fuel salt ranged from 0.004 to 0.006% and
averaged 0.0049%.2?

In view of the relation of tritium production in the
MSRE to the isotopic composition of lithium, Hauben-
reich?? recently completed a full review of the possible
sources of tritium and of the analyses on which
production estimates were based. In connection with
that review, S. Cantor obtained new analyses for Li in
unused LiF-BeF,-ZrF4 carrier salt. The results coin-
cided with those obtained initially for LiOH, but were,
for reasons still unknown, substantially higher than the
~50 ppm which was previously used as the basis for
estimation of production rates.?3

2.4.7 Examination of salts after zero-power experi-
ment. At termination of the zero-power experiment,
the fuel salt was drained for temporary storage in fuel
drain tank FD-2. Flush salt was circulated through the
fuel system for a 24-hr period and drained for storage.
Four specimens of fuel salt were obtained from the fuel
drain tank at intervals during the first 300-hr period of
storage. This practice was not continued after power
generation began because of the hazards which would
be incurred by attempts to provide temporary access
for sampling radioactive salt. One purpose of the effort
to sample salt from the drain tank was to confirm that

_ the composition of the salt in the tank conformed to

results of lithium analyses for either LiF-UF, or

LiF-BeF, mixtures effects equal improvement of the

that expected from mixing the newly constituted salt in
the fuel circuit with that of lower uranium concen-

 
 

 

tration in the drain tank. Any mismatch noted at this
time would serve as a base-line correction to data
obtained later during power operations. A second
purpose was to investigate the effectiveness of quiescent
storage of the salt in reducing the amounts of sus-
pended particles of the structural metals iron and
nickel. In retrospect, this period afforded the oppor-
tunity for securing a wide variety of base-line data, an
opportunity that was exploited only to a modest
extent, in that only four salt samples were removed for
analysis. Their compositions, as determined from chem-
ical analysis, are listed in Table 2.18.

The data shown in Table 2.18 indicate that approxi-
mately the same bias noted previously in the analysis of
carrier constituents continued to be evident and that
the disparity between the analytical data and the
nominal concentration of uranium was ~0.3%, which is
within the precision normally found for uranium
analyses.

A comparison of the values for iron and nickel in the
samples drawn from the drain tank and those previously

32

obtained from the pump bowl shows no significant
difference. Evidence confirming this expectation was
provided later by analysis of two samples removed from
the pump bowl before the reactor was operated at
power. Samples were withdrawn from the reactor in
enricher ladles and were transferred under an inert
atmosphere to the graphite crucible of an electro-
chemical cell assembly for electrochemical studies by D.
L. Manning. The cell assembly and electrodes developed
for these electrochemical studies are described else-
where.2* Average total concentrations of iron and

nickel in the melt, as determined by conventional

methods, were about 125 and 45 ppm respectively. Iron
and nickel, as cationic species in the molten fuel, are
electroreducible in the: melt and can thus give voltam-
metric reduction waves. By voltammetry and by stand-
ard addition techniques, Manning found? that the salt
contained ~10 ppm of iron as Fe?* and that if nickel
were present as a cationic species, its concentration was

below the limit of detection by voltammetry (<1 ppm).

Since all previous transits of the salt were conducive
to retaining suspended metal in the salt, we felt that
possibly the finely divided metal (some threefold more
dense than the fluoride mixtures) would gradually settle
in drain tanks on conclusion of the zero-power experi-
ment. In an attempt to test this possibility, samples of
the static fuel salt were obtained from the fuel storage
tanks throughout a two-week period following the

zero-power experiment. The concentrations of the
structural metal impurities were not found to change

during this storage period. We concluded, therefore,
that thermal convection in the storage tank was
sufficient to prevent settling of fine metallic particles in
this tank and that the concentrations of these metals in
the - salt might be expected to remain essentially
constant throughout the remainder of MSRE opera-
tions.

On removal of the: fuel pump rotor for examina-
tion,2® approximately 1 kg of flush salt was found to
have been retained in the rotor flange area (Fig. 2.6)
and in the volute of the pump bowl (Fig. 2.5).
Additional small fragments of salt were found in various
adjacent locations: in the grooves of the shield-block
O-ring and in line 903, through which pump-bowl gas
was vented to an HF analyzer that was installed
temporarily in the prenuclear operational period to
analyze the composition of the off-gas. All salt speci-
mens were submitted for microscopic and/or chemical
analysis and were found to be entirely free of oxides or
oxyfluorides. Results of the chemical analyses per-
formed with these samples are listed in Table 2.19. A
minor oil leak allowed oil to enter the shield-block

of the pump oil were in contact with the salt specimens
in these areas and were found as partial films on some
of the salt (Fig. 2.5) or dispersed through fragments of
other specimens. In all locations where crystallized salt
deposits were found, it was evident that the molten salt

had not adhered to the metal surfaces. This was

particularly evident inthe volute deposit, where the
molten specimen cooled rapidly and maintained the
surface angle tangency characteristic. of sessile drops
which are free of contaminant oxides.

2.4.8 Appraisal of chemical surveillance in prepower
tests. From a chemical standpoint, operations of the

MSRE during the precritical and zero-power experi-

ments were performed in a manner that maintained the
purity of the salt charges during all transfer, fill, and
circulation operations. The results of the chemical
analyses obtained with samples from the fuel and

coolant systems reinforced the longstanding conclusion,
drawn in laboratory and engineering-scale experiments,
that pure molten-fluoride mixtures are completely
compatible with nickel-based alloys.

The utility of routine analysis of salt samples removed
from the circulating systems came to be realized as of
questionable value with respect to several of the
constituents after brief experience with the MSRE. It
became quite clear, for example, that only easily
recognized operational perturbations were likely to
cause the average concentrations of carrier or coolant
salt constituents to vary beyond standard deviations in
the analyses and that without major refinement in the
analytical methods for determining the concentration
of uranium in fluoride mixtures these analyses would
not provide - operational control. Nonetheless, the
potential value for applications of statistically signifi-
cant results justified, in our judgment, a continued and
active program of chemical analysis. Furthermore, by
the time the zero-power experiment was completed, the
value of chromium analysis as the single quantitative
indicator of corrosion or of corrosion-free performance

was solidly established. Analysis of salt samples for this
impurity involves wet chemical dissolution techniques,
which account for some 90% of the cost of a complete
analysis. Because of this factor, there was little reason
to omit analysis of more than one component, for such
omission would preclude determination of overall com-
position.

Several aspects of the relation of analysis to MSRE
operations proved to be discomfiting by the completion
of the zero-power experiment. Annoyingly, chemical

analysis of the flush-salt samples removed from the
.system indicated that the amounts of salt residues

remaining in the system after drain operations were
somewhat more than could be accounted for by the
on-site estimates of the volumes of probable void space
where it was deduced that salt could reside. Ultimately,

“the application of neutron activation and mass spec-

trometric analysis to this problem confirmed that
estimates made from chemical data were the most
nearly correct. Until this problem was resolved, con-
tinued exchange of fuel and flush salt by drain-fill
operations suggested a negative bias in the analysis of

uranium. Methods were developed for slight refine-
ments in the uranium analysis, but not surprisingly,
these did little to resolve the fundamental problem.
Weigh cell data, in which some reliance was placed
originally, proved to be of little value with continued
experience, and accordingly, increasing reliance on
chemical analyses was developed.

For a lengthy period, there was no absolute method
for establishing the level of contamination of the salts
by small amounts of oxide ion. This assay was
performed in a partly satisfactory manner during the
precritical and zero-power experiments, but the method
was not adapted for application to highly radioactive
materials until well into the power period.

The lack of dynamic methods for obtaining various
analyses of the gas and vapor above the surface of the
fuel salt proved to be a severe limitation in the
interpretation of the chemical behavior which occurred
in the fuel system. In the absence of on-site gas analysis,
either by mass spectrometry or gamma-ray spec-
trometry (which was developed later for postopera-
tional examinations), interpretation of several aspects
of molten-salt reactor behavior remained less than
completely resolved — in particular, of greater signifi-
cance in power operations, the experimental investi-
gation of factors controlling the transport of noble
metal fission products.

In general, the surveillance program was, to this stage,
a success principally because of the careful procedures
which were employed to ensure its trouble-free opera-
tion and because of the intrinsic stability and compati-
bility of the materials used in its construction.

3. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE FUEL SALT
DURING NUCLEAR OPERATIONS

3.1 Introduction

The MSRE was not -the first reactor to use a
molten-fluoride fuel mixture. The ARE (Aircraft Re-
actor Experiment) was operated as the initial demon-
stration of a molten-salt reactor in November 1954,
using a fuel solution of NaF-ZrF,-235UF, (53-41-6
mole %).! The time during which the molten-fluoride
fuel was circulated was brief, ~1000 hr, and did not
include a program of chemical surveillance. In contrast,
the MSRE was intended. to provide the experience and
operational data on which design and plans for molten-
salt reactors of 30-year operating lifetimes could be
based. Plans for its operation, therefore, included a
chemical surveillance program that was comprehensive

in scope. Moreover, chemical information and quantita-

tive data pertaining to a number of phenomena that
could only be obtained from operating reactors were
lacking, even though a thorough program of laboratory,
engineering-scale, and in-pile tests had established the
principal parameters required to design and operate the
MSRE. Among the most important of these are the
chemical factors which control the distribution of
fission products within the fuel and off-gas systems, and
the redox chemistry typical of dynamic fuel systems in

_ which fuel burnup and replenishment proceed concur-

rently. It was also important to establish the corrosion

resistance of Hastelloy N under realistic and typical

operating conditions, to examine the capability of a
molten-salt reactor to operate under circumstances
where contaminants might enter the salt occasionally or
chronically, and to study the possible effects that
operation of numerous chemical components of the
reactor might have on fuel and coolant chemistry. It
was the intent of these efforts to evaluate, on a
continuing basis, the adequacy of the surveillance
program to assess the performance and safety of the
MSRE as the prototype of a molten-salt breeder
reactor. }

Initial activities of the program of chemical surveil-
lance served to establish that the behavior of the fuel
and coolant salts would conform with that expected
from laboratory . and engineering tests. We sought
information that would indicate whether the fuel and
coolant salts remained chemically stable and noncorro-
sive, to what extent the consumption of fissile material
deviated from that expected from nuclear considera-
tions, and whether or not uranium losses could be
detected by chemical examination of salt samples. In

the beginning stages of MSRE operation, samples were
taken on one-day intervals to assess the chemical
stability of the fuel, to establish whether or not the
concentration of oxide contaminants remained below
the saturation limits (~700 ppm for the average
operating” temperature of 650°C), and to correlate
concomitant corrosion, if it occurred, with possible
introduction: of contaminants into the system. Finally,
we anticipated that through measurement of isotopic
changes in the uranium composition of the fuel it might
be possible to obtain accurate comparisons of the
amounts of uranium burned with those expected from
nuclear considerations.

After a significant amount of uranium had undergone.
fission, procedures were initiated ‘to monitor the rela-
tive concentration of trivalent uranium in the fuel salt.
Studies of the chemical effects of uranium fission in
molten-fluoride mixtures had led to an early estimate

_ that the fission reaction would be mildly oxidative and

would produce ~0.8. equivalent of oxidation per gram
atomic weight of uranium consumed. This estimate was
based on an appraisal of the yield and chemical stability
of the state of the fission products. Since it was possible
to evaluate only the equilibrium states of all the various
fission product species — for example, the rare earths,
iodine, tellurium, and the “noble” metals, including
Mo, Nb, Ru, Ta, Re, and Tc — nonequilibrium behavior
in highly radioactive environments of the MSRE would
not have been surprising and would conceivably intro-
duce uncertainties into interpretation of fission product
behavior in the MSRE. Previous experience with fission
product behavior had been explored almost exclusively
through in-pile capsule tests, although some appraisal of
the ARE fission product distribution was made.2 A
vigorous investigation of the fate of fission products in
the MSRE was therefore initiated and pursued through-
out the entire period of reactor operations. The results
of those studies are summarized elsewhere.3 Concur-
rently, laboratory studies were developed in support of
the on-site efforts to establish the relationships of
fission product distributions in the MSRE with chemi-
cal parameters. During the course of MSRE operations
it became increasingly evident that minor variations in
the oxidation-reduction potential of the fuel salt almost
certainly had a real effect on some of the fission
product distributions within the system and that
accurate means for the determination of the concentra-
tion of trivalent uranium in MSR’s would be needed.
Active work was devoted thereafter to the development
of means for analysis of U3+/ZU.

Based on the considerations discussed above, a pro-
gram of chemical surveillance was formulated and

maintained throughout the entire period of reactor
operations with the MSRE. All salt, metal, and gas
specimens removed from or introduced into the fuel
system were assigned sample designation numbers.
Analytical data obtained with these specimens are
summarized in Table 3.1, which will serve as the basis
for the discussion in the remainder of this section.

32 Component Analysis

As soon as a statistically significant number of

fuel-salt samples were obtained it became evident that

the average variation in the analytical values for the
components Li, Be, Zr, and F within one standard unit
* of deviation (1 0) would preclude the use of the results
of chemical analyses for these components for opera-
tional control of the reactor. Of special interest in this
connection is the component zirconium. It might seem
that if reduction in the concentration of zirconium in
the salt were detectable analytically, such reduction
would signal that the oxide saturation limit was
exceeded. However, assuming that the salt was origi-
nally completely free of oxide and that the solubility
limit is ~700 ppm at 650°C, the fuel salt could
accommodate 0.34 kg of oxide before it became
saturated. If the source of the oxide was from moisture,
saturation by oxide would correspond to complete
reaction of 0.23 kg of HF with the containment vessel,
from which 0.29 kg of Cr would be leached into the
salt, increasing its concentration there by 59 ppm. Itis
thus evident that unless highly sensitive techniques were
available for measuring the oxide concentration of the
salt introduced from contamination of the salt by
moisture, the initial indication of such contamination
would be the increase of chromium. The 1 0 sensitivity
limit - for zirconium corresponds to +0.24%, which
corresponds to 1.75 kg of ZrO,. Although the solu-

bility of ZrO, in the fuel salt is sufficiently temperature

dependent to expect that on saturating the molten-salt
solution with oxide and that further formation of oxide
would result in the deposition of oxide crystals at the
coldest point in the circuit, it has not been established
experimentally that, with rapidly circulated streams,
such crystal growth would actually occur. If not,
significant amounts of zirconium might be carried in
the salt in slurry form and an analysis of samples
removed from the pump bowl would not signify a loss
of zirconium from the salt as one might expect
otherwise. It is thus clear that by the time it would have
been possible to establish from zirconium analysis that
the 1 0 limit had been exceeded, at least 1.41 kg of
ZrO, would have been precipitated and probably

carried by the salt as a slurry. Since, of all the fuel salt
constituents, zirconium is the one whose reduction in

.. concentration would independently reflect increasing
amounts of oxide impurity, only perfunctory attention

was given to the precision of the analyses of the carrier
constituents. "Analysis of these constituents was con-
tinued on a routine basis because of their use in

. providing general confirmation of the inference that the

fuel was chemically stable and because the principal
analytical costs were incurred from operations related
to handling and processing the radioactive samples;
laboratory tests which followed dissolution of the salts .
for analysis comprised a minor fraction of the overall

charges. Mean values of the MSRE fuel-salt composition
_ as determined from analysis of samples removed from

the pump bowl are given in Table 3.2.

3.3 Oxide Analysis

Until the chemical equilibria involving H,, HF, and
oxides in LiF-BeF, melts were defined completely,® no
satisfactory analytical method existed for determina-
tion of oxide in MSRE salts. The KBrF4 method,
while occasionally satisfactory, produced results that
reflected the frequent contamination of samples after
they were removed from the reactor by quantities of
water adsorbed in transit and during storage, and were
for the most part generally incredibly large and erratic.

Subsequently, an improved method of analysis was
developed® based on the equilibrium 0?” + 2HF(g) =
H,0(g) + 2F~, which occurs when a molten-salt sample
is purged with an HF-H, gas mixture. Although this
hydrofluorination method was regarded as less sensitive
than the inertgas fusion method? or the KBrF,
method, satisfactory sensitivity was achieved by ~50-g
samples. After development, only this method was used
for analysis of MSRE salt samples. During the period
when the MSRE was in operation it was important to
know the approximate concentration of oxides in the
fuel and coolant salts, but the information. was not
considered to be particularly relevant to a need to
develop highly sensitive in-line analytical methods for
reactors in which on-line fuel reprocessing is done. This
arises from the fact that on-line reprocessing methods
are likely to employ chemical processes in which, for
rare earth removal, there is a complete turnaround in
the uranium inventory. If this is done, the turnaround
will be accomplished by fluorination, and the reconsti-
tuted stream will be adjusted in uranium (IV, III)
concentration.

- The fuelsalt mixtures which are most suited for use
in breeder or converter systems employ a fertile carrier

“salt of the approximate composition ’LiF-BeF,-ThF,

(72-16-12 mole %). It has been deduced recently that in
uraniferous fuel salts constituted from this base, the
oxide tolerance at operating temperatures is in the
range 30 to 70 ppm.8 Although there is no need for
incorporation of an oxygen getter, such as ZrF,, in the
salt directly, this low oxide tolerance indicates that
there will be a need for swift, satisfactory, and
preferably in-line methods for determination of 0%”
(and UF;) concentrations in the fuel after storage and
during startup and operation. Further, it will be.
necessary to incorporate a demonstrated continuous
process for removal of 0%” to a satisfactorily low level
from a substantial side stream from the reactor. The
results listed in Table 3.1 show that the concentration

of oxide never exceeded ~10% of saturation and were
thus regarded, along with the corrosion data, as
satisfactory evidence that the fuel system did not
.experience contamination during periods when fuel was
circulated in it. Other material pertinent to this
discussion is described in Chap. 6, concerning corrosion
and anomalies in the behavior of UF;.

3.4 Uranium Concentration

One of the purposes of the Molten-Salt Reactor
Experiment was to examine the applicability of various
techniques for rapid, accurate, reliable means of estab-
lishing the inventory of uranium in the fuel-salt system.
We projected that the experience gained with the MSRE

would fix the alternatives to be explored for the
development of larger molten-salt reactors. When it was
noted early in MSRE power operations that the
sensitivity of on-site determination of uranium concen-
tration coefficient in the reactivity balance was some
tenfold greater than the statistical variation in chemical
analysis, further consideration of the applicability of
laboratory analysis of individual samples for operational
control was abandoned.

Other sections of this report discuss uranium burnup
rates (Chap. 7), fissile inventory (Sect. 2.4.2), and
material balances (Sects. 3.6 and 3.7), the results of
which led to the final estimates of the concentrations of
uranium in the fuel salt as listed in Table 3.1. After
final adjustments in the estimated amounts of salts
contained in the reactor system and of the power

53

production rates, comparisons of the analytical data for
uranium concentration were made with the nominal
values for 235U and 233 U fuel, respectively, in Figs. 3.1
and 3.2. It is evident in Fig. 3.1 that the analytical data
contain a small positive bias in reference to nominal
values. The bias is of little consequence, for with the
average uranium inventory a difference in the estimated
carrier salt mass of 1 kg changes the nominal concentra-
tion of uranium by 0.01 wt %.

3.5 Structural Metal Impurities

In the development of molten-salt reactor technology,
continually recurring needs for accurate values of the
properties of moving fluids become apparent. Conse-

impurities that might be generated in the MSRE and

54

that might alter the properties of. the flowing salt

streams into which they were released were envisioned
at the outset of operations. With the possibility that

“impurities would exist both as ionic and metallic

species, it was desirable to examine the interrelation-

* ships of their development with respect to corrosion of

the container circuits, fission product transport, cavita-

tion effects, changes in the flow characteristics, and

their impact on MSBR reprocessing capability. Since all
but the initial aspect of this behavior comprises an

ongoing effort, the scope of the present report includes:

consideration of structural metal impurities in the

MSRE only with respect to the implication of changes’

in their concentration as related to corrosion. Specific

discussion of the chemical significance of the amounts

of impurities and changes in the concentrations is
deferred for consideration under Sects. 5 and 6, in
which corrosion in the fuel and coolant circuits is
discussed, and for subsequent reports where the rela-
tionships of physical and chemical properties of the

MSRE to metallurgical behavior and to fission product .

behavior are assessed.

Midway through the experiment, phenomena were
observed that led to the speculation that changes in the
surface-related properties of the impurities were of

_possible significance to the changes observed. It was not

experimentally feasible at that time to utilize the
reactor as the experimental tool for studies of the

"interfacial behavior in salt-metal systems. By the time

that laboratory studies had advanced to the stage where
a program of studies with the reactor could be
formulated, the schedule for operation of the reactor
called for its termination.

The combined experience from laboratory investiga-
tions and from an extensive engineering test program in
which various fluoride mixtures were circulated in
thermal convection and forced circulation loops led to
the expectation that the concentration of structural
metals in the MSRE salts would increase only slightly

anticipated, only modest increases occurred.

The MSRE fuel was produced, as described in Sect.
2.4, from carrier salt and fuel concentrate, for which
the chemical analyses indicated average concentrations
of impurities were quite low. Chemical analyses were
performed with samples of fuel salt removed regularly
from the fuel pump bowl, and occasionally from the
fuel drain tank. The average concentrations of the
structural metal impurities found in these samples are
listed in Table 3.2. Individual analyses are listed in
Table 3.1.

The methods employed by the analytical chemists for
determination of structural metal impurities were de-
scribed previously.? Each of the methods employed is
capable of approximately the same precision. Yet, as
shown by the results in Table 3.3, the experimental
precision obtained was much better for chromium than
for either iron or nickel. Corrosion reactions in the
MSRE were expected to produce only CrF, as a
dissolved species in the salts; iron, nickel, and molybde-

num, if present, were expected to persist in the metallic

species. The differences in observed standard deviations
for the three elements suggest that behavior very similar

to that anticipated did result. Inspection of the indi-

~ throughout the planned period of reactor operation. As

vidual results in Table 3.1 shows that the relative
concentrations of iron and nickel found among indi-
vidual samples rarely were constant. This is a somewhat
surprising result since. the excellent mixing conditions
which existed in the circulating salt should have been
conducive for allowing these metals to produce equilib-
rium solid solution alloys. The possibility that the metal
particles might have deposited from the salt also was
expected but seemingly did not occur either during
circulation or during storage. In retrospect, these
observations are compatible with the early conclusion
that the pure salt fluids do not wet metal surfaces and
with the fact that the low viscosities of the fluoride
mixtures enable thermal convection .currents to main-
tain the fluids in well-mixed condition during storage.
That thermal mixing occurs in these tanks was substan-
tiated by the first composition analysis in PC-2. As
 

 

 

evidenced by the composition of a sample which was
obtained from No. 2 drain tank shortly after ’LiF-
238UF, was added to the carrier salt, virtually com-
plete mixing of 7LiF-UF, and carrier salt was achieved
before intertank transfers were made to ensure homoge-
nization. Comparably efficient mixing is also probably
adequate to prevent settling of the very fine (below the
limit of microscopic detection) metallic particles of iron
and nickel in the drain tanks.

55

A quality control program was initiated by the -

Analytical Chemistry Division as chemical surveillance
of the reactor salt began. The results of this survey
showed that comparable accuracy and precision were
achieved in the analysis of structural metal impurities
in the salt samples.!® From the beginning, molybde-
num was not detected in the samples. Its absence then
and later was interpreted to signify that such corrosion
as occurred in the reactor was essentially diffusion
limited.

3.6 Chemical Effects of Reprocessing

The MSRE included a fuel processing plant for
‘removal of oxides, if necessary, from the fuel, flush,
and coolant salts. The plant was also intended for use in
recovering uranium from the fuel and flush salts after
termination of experiments with the MSRE. A detailed
description of the methods, operating procedures, and
components is given in the MSRE Design and Opera-
tions Report.11 It proved to be unnecessary to repurify
any of the salt charges in MSRE maintenance opera-
tions, although flush salt was repurified after its initial
use and prior to nuclear operations in order to remove
from the salt the oxides that it had accumulated during
its initial use in the fuel system. As planned, the
235,238 fuel salt was fluorinated in the.chemical
reprocessing plant after completion of experiments with
2350 fuel salt. Decision to utilize 23 U as fuel entailed

not only fluorination of the 235U salt but subsequent’

reduction of the structural metal impurities that enter
the salt as it is fluorinated. Decision to reuse the carrier
to constitute 233U fuel made it exigent to remove
metal particulates from the salt carrier before returning
it to the fuel system. Procedures for reduction of the
fluorides were evaluated and tested, and an optimum

filter medium was selected.!2 A sintered metal filter"

was then designed! 3 and incorporated in the return line
from the processing plant. :

Flush salt was reprocessed first to remove the
uranium it had accumulated in use (see Sect. 4.2).

Following fluorination, the fuel was treated, as was the

flush salt, to reduce the structural metal fluorides
present in their metallic forms.

The amounts of uranium which were recovered from
the fuel and flush salts were estimated from the
increases in weights of the NaF absorbers in which UF
was collected. The actual weights of UFs were not
measurable because fluorination of the salts in Hastel-
loy N processing vessels converted small amounts of
molybdenum to its volatile fluorides, which were
absorbed along with UF¢ on the sodium fluoride beds.
The approximate amounts of molybdenum absorbed on
these beds were estimated from the proportionate
amounts of iron, chromium, and nickel that were
dissolved into the flush and carrier salts after fluorina-
tion. Estimates of the weights of uranium recovered
were then obtained by subtraction of the probable
amounts of molybdenum absorbed from the total
weights gained by the absorbers. In a summary of
experience with the processing plant, Lindauer has
estimated that the amounts of uranium recovered from
the flush and fuel salts at this time were ~6.5 and
217.85 kg respectively.!4 The sodium fluoride absorb-
ers were subsequently delivered to the Goodyear
Atomic Plant in Portsmouth, Ohio, where wet chemical
procedures were used to recover the uranium charge
from the NaF absorbers. The results of these efforts and
their significance are discussed in Sect. 3.7.

The reprocessing procedures were notably successful
in decontaminating the uranium charge from fission
products. The only activity collected in any measurable
amount on the absorbers with UF¢ was ®SNb. None of
the filled absorber vessels exceeded maximum permis-
sible radiation levels; each vessel could be removed from
the processing plant without protective shielding.

At termination of operations of the MSRE with 235U
fuel, the concentration of structural metal contami-
nants in the flush and fuel salts was scarcely greater
than when they were first used. Fluorination of the
salts in the processing plant increased the concentra-
tions of chromium, iron, and nickel contaminants
temporarily. On completion of reprocessing procedures,
their concentrations were reduced once again to satis-
factorily low values. Changes in these concentrations as
a result of processing the salts are listed in Table 3.4.

For operation of the reactor with 233U fuel, a charge
of only about 40 kg of uranium was required as
compared with the some 220 kg of uranium that was
used during 235U operations. In order to provide a
sufficient volume of the fluid fuel mixture, the reactor
was loaded with a supplementary charge of fuel carrier
salt amounting to 129.9 kg.

Methods for removal of the lanthanide element fission
products. from the fuel streams of molten-salt reactors
using reductive extraction techniques were not fully

developed until after the MSRE had operated for some
time. Until then the most promising method for their
separation was the high-temperature low-pressure distil-
lation of fuel carriers after removal of uranium. Tests of
this method with irradiated salt were scheduled to take
place at the MSRE on completion of 235U operations
after removal of uranium from the fuel salt." Approxi-

mately 48 liters of irradiated carrier salt was allocated

for this experiment; when the charge was delivered,
however, it was found that only a total of 12 liters was
transferred. Partly because of this anomalous behavior

and because of its importance in the evaluation. of the
reactor fuel inventory, a considerable effort was made
to obtain an accurate measurement of the volume of -

salt remaining in the fuel storage tank.

At the beginning of 233U operations, samples of fuel
salt were removed from the MSRE pump bowl and
analyzed regularly by cotilometric methods which had

been applied previously and which were checked against

standards on a routine basis. Their precision and
accuracy is regarded to be ~0.5%. The results of these
analyses were, on the average, greater than the nominal

values by 0.008 wt %, ~1% of the nominal value, and

indicated (disregarding precision limits for purposes of
this calculation) that the net weight of the carrier salt
during this period was 4639 kg rather than 4708 kg, or

that an additional mass of 69.0 kg (1.13 ft*) of salt,
that is, a total of 299 ft* of the original carrier salt,
was not returned to the reactor to constitute the 233
fuel charge. In an attempt to support the conclusion
that some 3.0 ft3 of carrier salt was left in the fuel
storage tank, an isotopic dilution experiment was
performed in April 1969, in which two samples of ¢ LiF
(35 g) were added to this tank. Retrieval of samples

- from the tank using a windlass and 10-g sample ladles

was subsequently successful in removing small amounts
of salt (which incidentally were found to be encrusted
with metal residues) only through repeated. attempts.

The total weight of ®LiF added was 66.28 g (15.8 g of

Li). Prior to ®LiF addition the carrier salt was found
by analysis to have an average "Li/ZLi concentration of
99.9905 + 0.0015 wt %. The samples recovered after
the addition had a concentration of 99.914 + 0.024 wt

%,'5 which would indicate that the volume of the salt

is 3.0 + 0.84 ft3. However, samples of the carrier salt
delivered to the still-pot section of the distillation
apparatus were found to have concentrations of ®Lif
ZLi = 1.59 and 2.85 wt %, indicating that the ® LiF was
not dispersed homogeneously in the storage tank but
instead had dissolved preferentially in the salt fraction
delivered to the still pot. Homogeneous dispersal would
have resulted in a higher average Li ¢oncentration in

@Assumption of the removal of 13.93 kg of zirconium from this salt permits comparison after its dilution by six flush-salt

residues.

the sample recovered from the fuel storage tank, and a
lesser volume of salt would have been computed from
the results of the isotopic dilution analysis experiment.
Thus, although its lower limit cannot be deduced
unequivocally from the isotopic data, the volume of salt
retained in the storage tank cannot have been as high as
384 ft3.

The efforts to obtain samples from the storage tank
provided additional information that allows a separate
estimate of the salt volume. Sometimes small quantities
of salt were obtained, sometimes none. If this is
interpreted to mean that the salt level was at the point
in the dished head directly below the samplers, the pool

- contained ~3.0 ft of salt. Assuming that the storage

tank contained 3.0 ft* of salt rather than 1.13 ft® used
before, we correct the earlier result 4707 — 182.6 (3.0
ft) kg + 113.0 (1.13 ft?) kg and conclude that the
drain tank contained 4638 kg of carrier salt at the
beginning of 233U power operations. Thus the net
weight of the fuel charge at the beginning of 233U
power operations was 4638 kg + 38.3 kg = 4676 kg, and
the uranium concentration was 0.819 wt %.

Ample thermodynamic evidence existed to indicate
that reprocessing procedures would not change the
average composition of the fuel carrier salt. This
expectation was confirmed by comparison of the
average composition of the fuel salt before and after
reprocessing and by determination that the uranium
concentration in the 233U fuel mixture conformed to
our expectations. A discussion of the uranium assay
during "this. period may be found in Sect. 7.3. The

“results of chemical analyses shown in Table 3.5 support

the conclusion that the average composition of the fuel
carrier salt remained essentially constant throughout
the entire period of MSRE operations.

3.7 Material Balances for 23°U and 223 U Operations

3.7.1 Recovery of 22°U and 22%U. A material
balance of the fuel and flush salts was maintained on a

continuous basis from the beginning of experimental
operations with the MSRE. With refinements in physi-
cal property data for the salts, in neutron absorption
cross-section data, and in analytical methods, the
quality of the balance improved steadily. The accuracy
afforded by these improvements was established finally
by recovery operations at ORNL and at the Goodyear
Atomic Corporation, Piketon, Ohio. There, the uranium
hexafluoride removed from the 23°U fuel and flush
salts by chemical processing at ORNL was recovered by
wet chemical methods. The amounts of uranium recov-
ered using these methods were 6.420 + 0.006 kg from
absorbers 6, 7, and 8 (from the flush salt) and 214.572
+ 0.204 kg from the remaining 25 absorbers. The
procedures employed in the recovery of uranium were
described in detail in a report from the Goodyear
Corporation as follows: 16

The NaF material (25 absorbers) was processed using the
continuous dissolver and resulted in 120 batches of solution, for
a total of 46,049 liters containing 214,456 grams of uranium.
These batches were measured and sampled, in duplicate, using
the solution recovery accountability measuring columns. Batch
samples were proportionally composited, in duplicate, repre-
senting from 10 to 20 batches of solution. All composite
samples were analyzed for total uranium and weight percent
U-235 by thermal mass spectrometer. In addition, the contin-
uous dissolver operation generated 1,588 pounds of filter cake,
containing 105 grams of uranium. This material was also
sampled in duplicate and composited on a weight basis. Vent
losses resulting from steam effluent were calculated to be 11
grams of uranium.

The limits of error used for the measurement of solution and
filter cake resulting from processing the remaining sodium

" fluoride were 10.18 and 10 percent of the reported value per

composite analyzed. The limit of error for the total uranium
recovered was based on propagation of error applicable to each
composite group measured. Also, included in the limit of error
is a bias estimate for the volume measurements of £0.25 liter
per batch, equivalent to £126 grams of uranium.

These limits of error are based on previously determined
precision and accuracy estimates. Statistical evaluation of the
analyses obtained was not performed at this time since the

 
 

 

«

58

variation between samples indicates the precision will be well

within -the estimated values. Analyses of standard samples for

comparison to known uranium value were made during the
processing ‘period and showed excellent agreement.

The following precautions and special consideration were taken
while processing the NaF material to minimize measurement
uncertainty: :

1. The continuous dissolver and solution recovery systems were

dedicated to processing NaF material exclusively from

mid-March through June, 1970, to minimize rinsing of

equipment as well as possible crossover of other material in

process.

+2. The accountability measuring columns were recalibrated on

_ 2a weight basis and the recycle time required for representa-
tive sampling was determined by test data.’ ‘

3. The accountability measuring columns were rinsed twice, 30
liters per rinse, between each batch measured and sampled.

.- All containers, plastic, -and - miscellaneous scrap generated
* during opening the 25 absorbers were décontaminated and
* the resulting solution processed through the dissolver.

5. Vent losses, even though minimal, were calculated based on
total steam flow to atmosphere and the uranium concentra-
tion determined by analyses of condensate samples through-
out the processing period. . }

6. System clean-out was initiated after processing the solution

generated from the last three absorbers which were esti
mated at zero uranium content. This solution, 4,210 liters,
contained an average of 0.033 grams of uranium per liter.
Final rinse of the system averaged less than 0.002 grams
Ulliter.

"A disparity between the ORNL material balance and
the Goodyear results of 0.83 kg of 2?°U was evident.
In an attempt to resolve this discrepancy we requested
the Goodyear Corporation to retain the absorber vessels
until investigation of the cause of the disparity was
identified. In a telephone conversation between R. B.
Lindauer and J. G. Crawford,17 two pertinent details
were disclosed: the few fines remaining in the absorber
tanks were removed (by wiping the interior surfaces
with moistened tissues) and added to the process
solutions. Further, the interior surfaces of the absorbers
were noted to be bright. and shiny, a condition which
seems to preclude the possibility that significant
amounts of uranium were retained on these surfaces.

The overall results strongly suggest that rationaliza-
tion of the disparity in the amount of uranium which
we anticipated would be recovered by the Goodyear
plant and that which was actually recovered would be
possible only through a careful review of MSRE
operations. In this connection, two possibilities were
suggested, by J. R. Engel and R. B. Lindauer, respec-
tively.18

Engel noted that the particle filter a 9-ft filter
designed to remove corrosion product solids from the

fluorinated salt before its reuse in the reactor) in the
line between the fuel storage tank and the processing
tanks could; after treatment of ‘the flush: salt was
completed, have contained an unknown amount of
zirconjum metal, delivered to this location as the
processed flush salt was returned to.the reactor system.
It- is difficult to assign high probability to the events
which could have reduced the uranium from the fuel
charge as, subsequently, it passed through this filter, in
such a way that some 2 kg of uranium remained in the
filter; however, the possibility cannot be excluded and
merits further examination.

Another possible site where uranium may have been
retained, as has been suggested by R. B. Lindauer, is the
high-temperature sodium fluoride absorber bed which is
positioned between the fuel storage tank and the NaF
absorbers. The design temperature for operation of this
absorber is 750°F, based on previous laboratory

-studies.!® The laboratory studies indicate that this

absorber would not retain UF, at the operating

temperature; the possibility that temperature gradients

prevailed within the absorber at periods near the end of
fluorination operations which allowed the retention of
some uranium within the absorber should now be
examined,

The possibilities that such errors as 1 might be ascribed
to misestimates of power output of the reactor,
reactivity anomalies, and implications of short-term
trends in the results of chemical analyses, have been
reexamined; we conclude that their possible contribu-
tion to the disparity described is negligible.

The possibility that the retention of uranium in either
site might be established with certainty by application
of newly developed neutron interrogation techniques
using a californium source seemed favorable. Mockup
experiments were devised and tested in the.remote
maintenance practice cell at the MSRE with a neutron
source and an ORR fuel element. These tests showed,
however, that the method could not be used without
considerable modification, including procurement of a
more intense source, and the effort was abandoned.
Although confirmation of the results of the existing
isotopic dilution analyses would-be desirable by direct
experiments such as were planned, the data which were
used to monitor the transfers of uranium and pluto-
nium within the reactor system appear to be suf-
ficiently reliable to estimate the amounts of 235U and
238U retained in the reprocessing system and for
computation of final inventory distribution. :

@Weights are based on comparisons of analytical results and computed values. These comparisons indicate that maximum power
output was 7.4 MW(t). Final estimates assume 4167 EFPH (equivalent full-power hours) at 7 4 MW(1). }

DThis item makes the simplifying assumption that the total amount of plutonium estimated to be transferred to the flush salt was

transferred during the final flush of the fuel circuit.

isotopic analyses used for this determination, together
with ‘other analytical methods, it became possible to
establish the power output of the reactor with good
precision, and accordingly to compute final material
balances for the fuel and flush salt systems. The results
of these computations are listed in Table 3.6.

In storage, the fuel salt is divided equally between the
two drain tanks. Both fuel and flush salt were frozen in
storage and are maintained between 232 and 343°C to
minimize the evolution of fluorine from the frozen
salts. _

An inventory of the uranium and plutonium con-
tained in the drain tanks, based on data listed in Table

3.6, together with results of mass spectrometric analy-

ses, is shown in Table 3.7. Using the values in this
inventory the composition of the fuel salt was calcu-
lated. Nominal values are compared with analytical data
in Table 3.8.

3.7.3 Salt loss from leakage. Experiments with the
MSRE were terminated on December 12, 1969. The
fuel and coolant salts were drained for storage in the

drain tanks. After the fuel was drained, and while the
freeze valves were being frozen, an increase in the
radioactivity in the reactor containment cell was ob-
served, which indicated that a very small leak had
occurred in the primary containment. After several
hours the activity began to decrease after having driven
the monitor on the recirculating cell atmosphere to a
maximum of 35 mR/hr. The fuel loop and drain tanks
were pressurized without causing an apparent effect on
the activity. A sample of the cell atmosphere indicated
that the activity was caused primarily from *33Xe.
Since leakage had apparently stopped, flush salt was
charged into the fuel system and circulated for 17 hr.
Before flush salt was drained from the circuit the
system was pressurized to 20 psig for 2 hr without
showing any signs of leakage. It was concluded after
further investigation that the leak was in freeze valve
FV-105 or in the immediate vicinity of this valve. To
conclude operations with the fuel circuit, flush salt was
transferred through the fill line to ensure that FV-105
and the adjacent line were filled with salt.

4. CHEMICAL COMPOSITION OF THE FLUSH
SALT DURING NUCLEAR OPERATIONS

4.1 Role of Flush Salt Analysis in the
Determination of Salt Residue Masses

The potential utility of a flush salt to scour contam-
inants from the MSRE fuel circuit was recognized early
in the MSRE development program; the sagacity of the
choice to use this salt was confirmed immediately after
preliminary experiments with the reactor — experi-
ments in which the flush salt was repurified after its
first period of circulation through the fuel system." The
repurification procedures employed at that time
showed that in its first use the salt had served to remove

61

a considerable amount of contaminants from the fuel
and moderator graphite system. Not'foreseen, however,
was the fact that it would function later to have a
significant influence on evaluations of reactor perform-
ance. This arose from the fact that the quantities of
residues of fuel and flush salt, intermittently cross-
transferred before and after reactor maintenance, could
not be adduced from on-site inferences. Soon after
experiments began with the circulating fuel salt, it
became evident that only the results of highly accurate
chemical analysis of the flush salt would make it
possible to establish reliable values for the amounts of
fuel and flush salt residues left in the reactor fuel
system after it was drained. Accuracy in these values
was also necessary in order to compute changes in
nominal values of the concentration of fissionable
material in the fuel circuit as the reactor experiment
proceeded.

Results of chemical analyses indicated that after the
fuel salt was drained, circulation of the flush salt
removed an average of 20 kg of fuel salt from the
drained circuit. Refinements in the values for the
physical properties of the fuel and flush salts allowed an
estimation from the relative density of the flush and

. fuel salts that the average mass of flush salt residues
would be ~17.5 kg. With these values, nominal values
for the composition of the fuel salt were calculated for
the period when experiments were conducted with
235U fuel.

The total mass of flush salt originally charged into the
MSRE was about 4190 kg. From averages of the
increments in the changes in concentration of uranium
which developed in the flush salt in use, it was expected
that after its final use with 235U fuel the flush salt
would contain uranium at a concentration of 1500
ppm, representing a total pickup of 6.29 kg of uranium.
Analysis of the flush salt after its final use to remove
235 fuel residue from the fuel circuit showed that the
concentration of uranium was 1488 ppm and, there-
fore, that the amount of uranium which was recover-
able from the salt was 6.23 kg; the actual amount of
uranium recovered was 6.420 kg. With the final amount
of uranium in the flush salt established as 6.420 kg, the
average increments were established as 0.917 kg, and
the average mass of fuel residue as 20.0 kg.

Complete results of the chemical analyses performed
with the flush-salt samples removed from the MSRE are
listed in Table 4.1. The average concentrations of
uranium in the samples removed from the system
during 23% U operations are shown in Fig. 4.1.

Flush salt was circulated in the MSRE fuel-salt
circuitry 13 times as a part of the 235U operations and

three times as part of 233U operations, once on each
occasion before the fuel was constituted in the reactor
system, and thereafter whenever the fuel system was to

be opened for maintenance. If during the maintenance .

period, the possibility developed that the fuel circuit
was exposed to ambient cell atmosphere, the circuit was
again washed with the molten flush salt before resump-
tion of experiments with the fuel salt. In use, the flush
salt was circulated for brief periods, usually 24 to 48 hr,
because it was assumed that molten LiF-BeF, flowing
in the metal circuit at 650°C would be extremely

64

effective as a solvent for contaminants that may have -

entered - the system during the previous maintenance
period. Gross exposures of the circuit to potentially
contaminating atmospheres were avoided during the
maintenance periods first by flushing the reactor system
with argon, and subsequently by maintaining a nitrogen

atmosphere in the standpipe column through which

access to the reactor core was gained. Neither blanket
gas was specially purified for this application.

It was judged that the flush salt was circulated for
sufficient periods of time to be effective, because, in
use, major increases were not observed in the concen-
tration of contaminants in the salt nor were there major
increases in the concentration of chromium in the fuel
salt on initiation of the subsequent experiments with
fuel salt. After each of these occasions, however, the
chromium concentration of the fuel salt gradually rose
to a higher. value than had preceded the maintenance
period. The significance of these changes is discussed in
Sect. 6. So -

4.2 Transfer of Uranium and Plutonium
to Flush Salt in 223 U Operations

Reclamation of 6.420 kg of uranium from the flush

salt indicates that the average increase in uranium
concentration developed from the removal of a single
fuel-salt heel during 235U operations was 219 ppm
rather than the average 215 ppm we had observed from

analyses performed during the course of reactor opera-

tions. With the 223U fuel salt, a reduction of the
concentration increments was anticipated proportionate
to the lower concentration of uranium in the fuel salt,
and should have resulted in an average increase of ~40
ppm per flush operation. The average of the two results
obtained with the flush salt after completion of run No.
20 shows that the final concentration of uranium in the
salt was 113 ppm, or that for each of the three times

flush salt was used to remove fuel salt residues, the-

average increase in the concentration was 38 ppm, in
good agreement with the anticipated value.

After termination of experiments with 233U fuel the
reactor was drained and flushed. Two samples of flush
salt were obtained (FP-20-33 and -35) in which the
average concentration of uranium was 113 ppm, an
increase of 42 ppm over that found during the single
previous use in which it removed a fuel-salt heel in
233y operations (the beginning of run No. 19). The
single. flush-salt sample obtained during the startup
operation preceding the introduction of 223U fuel into
the system was reported to have contained 36 ppm of
uranium. The three groups of data are thus consistent —
an indication that the concentration of uranium in-
creased as predicted. They also suggest that the flush
salt contained 35 to 40 ppm of uranium when it was
returned from the chemical reprocessing plant.

Isotopic analyses obtained from the last two samples
of flush salt are shown in Table 4.2. The isotopic
composition of the uranium contained in these samples
indicates that (correcting for the contribution from the
fuel of 0.023 kg and neglecting a correction for 232U
burnout) the flush salt contained ~50 ppm (0.21 kg) of
uranium, This is somewhat more than one would expect
considering the excellent agreement between expected
and observed amounts of uranium previously recovered
from ‘thé flush salt, and from analyses obtained during
the uranium recovery experiments with flush salt in
which results indicated the residual concentration was
no higher than 24 ppm, and possibly as low as 4 ppm.!

4.3 Flush Salt Loss to Off-Gas Holdup Tank

The results of the chemical and mass spectrometric
analyses described above provide a basis for the
conclusion that only very small amounts of either fuel
or flush salt could have been lost from the primary
containment or came in contact with the cell atmos-
phere through the leak that developed adjacent to the
 

 

freeze valves (see Sect. 3.6.3). If cell air were aspirated
into the fuel salt as it drained from the reactor at
termination of run No. 20, a probable consequence
would have been that ZrO, deposits may have formed
in the region of the break, later to be dissolved in the
flush salt. Possibly, some uranium would have been
deposited as well, along with the ZrO, . Small amounts
of ZF, are transferred to the flush salt as a part of fuel
residues, yet, as shown in Table 4.1, the concentration
of zirconium in the flush salt after its final use does not
seem to have increased. Second, sizable amounts of
uranium deposited in the area of the break would both
increase the anticipated concentration in the flush salt
and alter the isotopic ratio in favor of an anomalous
increase in 233U fraction. The isotopic analyses shown
in Table 4.2 denote a slight anomaly in isotopic ratios
of uranium, but of opposite character than suggested
above; that is, they indicate that slightly more 235U
and 238U were present than was expected from the
prior reprocessing operations. In one previous incident,
the possibility developed that flush salt was inadvert-
ently? lost from the salt system.

In Piper’s account? of operations in July 1966, he

‘notes that the fuel loop was filled with flush salt in

preparation for maintenance work in the reactor cell.
Flush salt was transferred into the overflow tank to
flush out the residual fuel and to check the indicated
level in the pump bowl at the overflow point, and
transfer began when the indicated level was 9.6 in. (In
January the indicated level at the overflow point had
been 9.2 in.) After approximately 0.6 ft* of salt was
transferred, the fuel pump level suddenly rose off scale.
Rising level in the overflow tank triggered a drain, but
not before salt had entered some of the lines connected
to the top of the pump bowl. This behavior resulted
from an operational error which allowed the salt level in
the flush tank to be lowered too far, and also allowed
the pressurizing gas to enter the fill line and pass up
into the reactor vessel. The gas expanded rapidly as it
rose through the salt, causing salt to flood the pump
bowl. The pump bowl reference line was plugged with
frozen salt, and enough salt was frozen in the sampler
tube to obstruct passage of the latch. A thermocouple
indicated that some salt also entered the off-gas line,
but this line was not plugged. Salt also froze on the
annulus around the fuel-pump shaft, preventing its
rotation. In subsequent maintenance operations electric
heaters were applied to the outside of the lines to melt
out the salt in the bubbler reference line and the
sampler tube. The short flexible portion of the off-gas
line was replaced because of uncertainty over the
possible effects of salt in the convolutions.

65

We noted above that for the increments observed in
the change of concentration in the flush salt the
projected amount of uranium recoverable for the salt
was ~6.3 kg, and that a total of 6.42 kg was recovered.
The projected value was calculated from the final
analytical values, 1488 ppm X [4187 + 7 X 2.6 kg (the
average mass increase from fuel-flush cross transfer)] =
6.257 kg. The fact that 6.42 kg of uranium was
recovered suggests that if the analytical data are free of
bias, only a small volume of flush salt could have
transferred to the off-gas in the overflow accident. For
example, if 50 kg of flush salt were lost by transfer the
maximum amount of uranium which could be re-
covered from the flush salt at a concentration of 1488
ppm would not exceed 6.18 kg. Although it cannotjbe
contended that the above results unequivocally demon-
strate that the amount of flush salt transferred was
negligible, they provide convincing evidence that the
amount was indeed small.

In retrospect, the flush salt has served as the source of
several kinds of valuable information pertaining to the
performance of the MSRE. It now seems evident that it
could have been used more effectively as a more
valuable source if the periods of its use had been
extended and designated for additional chemical investi-
gations.

5. CHEMICAL BEHAVIOR
OF THE COOLANT SALT

Of some 7000 kg of LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %)
prepared for the MSRE, 2610 kg was designated for use
as the coolant salt and the remainder as flush salt. This
coolant was circulated by a 75-hp motor and pump
through a circuit which included a tube and shell heat
exchanger and an air-cooled radiator. Detailed descrip-
tions of this coolant system are given in the MSRE
Design and Operations Report.! At termination of the
Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment the salt had circulated
in the system for a period of ~26,000 hr. With the
reactor at full power, coolant salt entered the tube
bundle of the heat exchanger (Fig. 5.1) at a tempera-
ture of 546°C (1015°F) and at 77 psig, removing heat
from the fuel salt as it circulated through the shell side
of the exchanger, and flowed on to the air-cooled

radiator (Fig. 5.2). On reentry to the heat exchanger,
the salt was at a temperature of 579°C (1075°F). The

coolant was circulated under these conditions for-

approximately half the period of its use. At zero or low
power the salt was circulated isothermally, at about
650°C (1200°F). The coolant pump operated at con-
stant speed, developing a salt flow of 6286 kg/min (793

gpm).

5.1 Composition Analysis

"The salt was circulated for some 1200 hr during the
prenuclear test period. Since flush and coolant salts
. were supplied from the same inventory, the coolant salt
was analyzed during this period only for impurities.

At the end of prenuclear. testing, concentrations of
the structural metal impurities, chromium, . iron, and

nickel, were established to be approximately 30, 90,and
7 ppm respectively — remarkably low considering that
the circuit had not been flushed previously with molten
salt. The results of spectrochemical analyses showed
that no significant amounts of additional impurities
were introduced during this period. As the reactor was
brought to full power early in 1966, coolant salt was
again circulated, sampled regularly, and subjected to
compositional and impurity analysis. The results of
these analyses, together with all other analyses of the
coolant salt, are listed in Table 5.1.

It was stipulated that the chemical analyses include a
determination of zirconium concentration as part of the
procedures for coolant-salt analysis. Although such
analyses were .not conceivably applicable as primary
indicators of fuel leakage, their incorporation supplied
base-line data for the contingency that possible analysis

of fuel-coolant mixing accidents might arise. Results are
omitted from Table 5.1, because in none of the analyses

“of the coolant salt was zirconium detected.

As noted in Sect. 3.3, procedures used for the determi-
nation of the concentrations of oxides in MSRE samples
were unsatisfactory until development of the HF-H,
transpiration method was completed. Not until late in
the program of reactor operations was this method
applied to coolant-salt samples, and then, for the single
sample available, it produced questionable results. The
results of analyses for oxides listed in Table 5.1 were
obtained with the KBrF; method, a method which is
generally satisfactory for nonhygroscopic materials, but
which was applied to samples which are hygroscopic
and had not remained isolated from ambient atmo-
spheres after their removal from the reactor, In view of
the established absence of corrosion in the coolant
circuit, their credibility is dubious.

Analyses of coolant salts were conducted by the
General Analysis Laboratory of the ORNL Analytical
Chemistry Division, while those for the fuel were
obtained from the High-Radiation-Level Analytical
Laboratory of that Division.

5.2 Corrosion Behavior

Corrosion of Hastelloy N as a container for molten
LiF-BeF, mixtures may originate from a very limited
number of sources: from impurities in the melt, from
oxide films on the metal, and from mass transfer of
metal constituents in the fluoride. Of these sources,
only the latter, which is caused by the differential
temperature coefficient for solubility of metals in salts,
affords a mode of continuous attack in reactor systems
that are protected from inleakage of contaminants.

Since the procedures adopted for MSRE operations
assured that the circuit would be free from chronic
sources of contaminants, it was anticipated that surveil-
lance of the coolant salt would indicate imperceptibly
low corrosion throughout the experiment.

In the “early stages of MSRE operations, samples of
the flush salt were removed from the circuit at a rate of

and it was confirmed that chronic sources of oxidizing
impurities were absent, the frequency was decreased,

MSRE operations. Under these circumstances, it was
reasonable to expect that corrosion would not occur in
the circuit, and these expectations were borne out in
MSRE operations as indicated by the results of chemi-
cal analyses, and later in the postoperational examina-
tions of the radiator (see below).

‘The results of the chemical analyses performed with
coolant-salt samples showed that no measurable in-
crease in the concentration of Cr, Fe, and Ni (with
average values of 32, 64, and 20 ppm respectively)
developed after the coolant. salt was first charged into
the MSRE. The concentrations of chromium in the
coolant-salt samples, as determined in chemical analy-
ses, are shown in Fig. 5.3. The fact that the chromium
concentration remained unchanged is remarkable, since
it indicates that within the limitation of the analytical
precision (+7 ppm) no corrosion, excepting that pos-
sibly - resulting from mass transfer, occurred in the
coolant circuit during the entire period of MSRE

operations. The demonstrated compatibility of the

coolant salt with its containment alloy is believed to be
unmatched in any prior experience with either molten
salts or liquid metals as recirculating heat-exchange
media. .

The average value of the chromium concentration in

the coolant salt remained at 32. ppm for the entire
period of reactor operation. The apparent trend toward
higher values toward the end of the use period, as is
reflected in'Fig. 5.3, tends to discount the credibility of
the view that the system remained free of contami-

nants. However, the results of postoperational examina-
tions support this view completely and indicate thereby
that continued ‘use and analysis of the salt would have
shown that the data were not indicative of a trend, but
rather represented normal scatter. As part of the
postoperational examination: of MSRE components,
sections of the radiator tubing were removed from the
inlet and outlet ends and tested by ORNL metallurgists.
Their analysis of the surfaces of the alloy that were
exposed to the coolant salt by electron microprobe
techniques - disclosed that no compositional variations
in Cr, Mo, Ni, or Fe existed within 2 u (the allowable
working range on these samples) of the surfaces.’

Comparisons of the chemical composition of sections
of this tubing with machined turnings showed a higher
concentration of carbon at the salt interface after
service, as was suggested from examinations of the
microstructure.” However, changes in the tensile
strength of the alloy were found to be slight and did
not indicate serious embrittlement of the alloy.

The chemical behavior of the coolant salt in the
MSRE is a unique demonstration of the compatibility
of pure fluoride mixtures with nickel-based alloys, and
shows as well that, with normal precautions to ensure
that oxidizing contaminants are prevented from enter-
ing these systems, corrosion will not occur. The
behavior of the coolant salt in the MSRE is a benign
indicator of the potential application of LiF-BeF,
based systems, but has only marginal implication with
respect to the coolant salt of larger-scale molten-salt
reactors in which lower liquidus temperatures are
 

 

mandatory for the coolant, and where the capital cost
of the coolant salt will have a pronounced effect on
power economics. These factors seem to preclude the
choice of "LiF-BeF, mixtures as coolants in such
reactors. The current choice for the MSBR coolant salt
is the NaF-NaBF, eutectic mixture. The highly success-
ful performance of the molten fluoride salt "LiF-BeF,
in the MSRE is, however, of special significance in that
it leads to the recognition that the possibilities of
materials combinations are more flexible than was
estimable prior to operation of the MSRE.

6. CORROSION IN THE FUEL CIRCUIT
6.1 Modes of Corrosion

Early recognition that numerous inorganic fluorides
are among the most chemically stable materials in
nature supplied the initial impetus for investigation of
the chemical feasibility of molten-salt reactors. It was
noted that the fluorides of commonplace alloy con-
stituents such as iron, nickel, chromium, and molyb-
denum were less stable than the various compounds
which might serve as components of molten-salt reactor
fuels and coolants, and thus good alloys were poten-
tially available as containers for molten fluoride mix-
tures (see Table 6.1). Subsequently, a materials develop-
ment program was initiated culminating in the develop-
ment of the alloy now "designated as Hastelloy N
specifically for use in constructing the MSRE; its
approximate composition was Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe (71-17-7-5
wt %). The basis for the selection of this exact
composition is described by Taboada' in a detailed
review of the alloy development program.

Since the major components of the MSRE salts, LiF,
BeF,, ZrF,4, and UF,, are much more stable than the
fluorides which can result from the corrosion of
Hastelloy N, that is, MoF3, NiF,, and FeF,, compati-
bility of the molten-salt mixtures and the alloy was
essentially assured.

The most probable mechanisms by which corrosion
might occur in the MSRE were identified and examined
extensively prior to operation of the reactor. The

chemistry of such processes was reviewed recently by

Grimes.? In the absence of impurities, corrosion pro-
ceeds through two mechanisms, by mass transfer and by
selective oxidation of chromium, the most chemically
active constituent of the container alloy. Both types of
corrosion are limited by self-diffusion of chromium in
the alloy and by temperature, which in the MSRE fuel
reached extremes of 654°C (1210°F) and 632°C
(1170°F).

Preponderantly, oxidation-reduction reactions are re-
sponsible for all the corrosion in molten-salt reactor
fuel systems. The principal reaction which controls the
process is

UF (d) + %Cr@) = UF3(d) + OF, @), (1)

 
 

 

 

 

for which the standard free energy at 1000°K (727°C)

is +15.1 kcal; at this temperature the equilibrium

constant for the reaction is

where N is mole fraction of a reactant or product and &
is the activity coefficient. For purposes of examining
the way this equilibrium affects corrosion behavior,
assume conditions similar to those existent with 233U
fuel, where Np, = 1.38 X 107%, Cr** = 5.15 X 107°
(150 ppm), ac, = 3 X 1072. 3 The equilibrium
concentration of UF thus becomes 2.832 X 107% and

Nyr,/Nyr, =2.832X 1075/1.38 X 1073 = 0.205% .
These results illustrate that the reaction tends to come
to equilibrium with a small fraction of the uranium in
the trivalent state. Chemical factors which remove UF;
from the salt system promote the forward reaction (1)
and tend to remove chromium from the container alloy

‘by selective oxidation.

Fission in molten-salt reactor fuel systems causes a
gradual increase in the oxidation potential in molten-
salt fuels (based on UF,) as uranium is consumed.
From estimates of fission yields* and probable oxida-
tion states of the species produced, the effect of fuel
burnup on corrosion can be evaluated. A recent
appraisal of this balance indicates that when reducing
conditions are maintained and xenon and krypton are
removed rapidly from the fuel, the sum of the electrical
charges on the fission product cations is less than an
average value of +4 per mole of uranium burned, and
~0.76 equivalent of oxidation results from the fission
of one gram atomic weight of uranium.’ It was useful
for this reason to increase the Nyy, [Ny g, concen-
tration in the fuel salt occasionally” as a means of
minimizing corrosion.

Self-diffusion coefficients of chromium in nickel-base
.alloys in the temperature range 600 to 900°C were
determined by Watson and co-workers® by monitoring
the total intake of 5!Cr by the alloys exposed to salt
solutions containing this radiotracer and by measuring
the tracer concentration profiles through successive
electropolishing of the specimens.

They found from the loop experiments that the
diffusion coefficient of $'Cr in Hastelloy N at 650°C
(1200°F), the mean temperature of the MSRE fuel, was
1 X 107'* cm?/sec. In recent examination of metal

was found that indicated the diffusion coefficient of
chromium in the core specimens may have been as high
as 4 X 107'* cm? [sec (Fig. 6.1). The fact that the data
from the MSRE samples were of necessity obtained
from hot-cell operations, whereas no such constraints
were imposed in the original laboratory measurement of

self-diffusion coefficients, lends somewhat greater credi-

bility to Watson’s values. Both values may be accurate,
however, because Watson noted that for Inconel the
self-diffusion coefficients of chromium were strongly
dependent on annealing conditions at low temperatures.
Conditions leading to large grains led to low diffusion
coefficients and vice versa.

Extrapolation of Watson’s data for Hastelloy N (see
Fig. 6.2) indicates that the self-diffusion coefficient for
Cr in Hastelloy N at the lowest temperature of the
MSRE fuel circuit is 8 X 10™!'% cm? /sec. The rate of
mass transfer is limited by the rate of diffusion of
chromium into the alloy in the coolest area of the
system. Corrosion from mass transfer was therefore
expected to be of little consequence in the MSRE.*

Fick’s equation, M, = 2Co(Dt{n)*/? (where C, =

concentration of the diffusing element in the bulk
species, D = diffusion coefficient, ¢ = time) can be used

to predict the quantity of material removed by dif-

*Postoperational examination of sections of Hastelloy N from
the heat exchanger disclosed no evidence of an enrichment of
chromium at the salt-metal interface. This observation has led
to a suggestion, by F. F. Blankenship that since the coolest
location in the fuel circuit is in the area of freeze valve 103, it
would be useful in a future examination to determine the
profile of chromium concentration in the alloy at this location.

fusion under conditions where the surface concen-
tration of the diffusing element is zero. Table 6.2 lists
the amounts of chromium which might have been
expected to appear in the fuel salt during 235U

operations if all the chromium accessible to the salt
were oxidized to CrF,. It is apparent from these data-

that generalized corrosion, as inferred from increases in
chromium concentration of the fuel salt, was only
one-fourth to one-third of that expected from the

diffusion coefficients. By contrast, the apparent corro-

sion rates that were observed during the initial stages of

MSRE operations with 233U fuel and again in the
beginning of run 19 were approximately 5.4 and 3.84
times as rapid as predicted using a diffusion coefficient
of 2 X 107'* cm?/sec. Such rates were inconsistent
with previous observations and more rapid than the
maximum allowed by the maximum value observed for
the diffusion coefficient, 4 X 10™'% cm? /sec. Since the

 
 

 

rates of corrosion on these occasions were unlikely to
be permitted by chromium diffusion, it seems likely
that bulk diffusion involving other constituents of the
alloy was operative.

From the following argument it is concluded that the

74

anomalously rapid corrosion during these periods and

occasionally during 235U operations was caused by
contaminants introduced into the fuel system during
periods of maintenance.

6.2 Corrosion in Prenuclear Operations

As noted in Chap. 2, chemical analyses were per-
formed concurrently in the General Analysis Labora-
tory and in the High-Radiation-Level Analytical Labora-
tory with salt samples removed from the MSRE during
the period before nuclear operations began. This pro-
cedure reflected that a slight operational bias existed in
the results of the two laboratories® for some of the
species and enabled us to use those biases as correction
factors for assessment of changes in the salt. With
respect to chromium analyses as a corrosion indicator,
the data corrected by this factor showed that at the
average value of its concentration, 37 + 7 ppm, no
change in the chromium concentration of the fuel
circuit salt had occurred throughout the period ending
with the completion of the zero-power experiments. In

the low-power experiments following the first main-
tenance period, during which time the pump rotor was
removed for examination, the new average value of
chromium in the fuel salt was 48 + ppm. Since the
standard deviations for these two values overlap, it can
be inferred that the flushing operation preceding the
low-power operation (run 4) effectively removed
corrosion-inducing contaminants that ‘might have
entered the system during the maintenance period.

6.3 Corrosion in Power Operations

In Fig. 6.3 the results of all chemical analyses of fuel
salt samples for chromium are summarized for power
runs. The scattered data are described most simply as

"increasing linearly with time and correspond to an

   

increase in chromium concentration in the salt at a rate
of 12 ppm per year. Statistical analyses of the indi-
vidual groups of data, however, indicate that the
average values (least-squares method) are as listed in

Table 3.3.

In operation of the reactor with 233U fuel, the
concentration of chromium in the samples of fuel salt
increased sharply only during two periods, during the
initial stages of run Nos. 15 and 19. One interpretation
of these analytical results is that corrosion rates
exceeded those predicted by diffusion data only after

some specific event. A significant increase in the
concentration of chromium in fuel -salt samples was
noted only during the initial stages of runs Nos. 4, 8,
12, 15, and 19, with an apparent increase - partway
through run No. 14. In the beginning periods of run
Nos. 4, 8, 12, 15, and 19, we find that in each instance
a common set of circumstances existed: the reactor
core vessel had been opened previously, either for
maintenance or to exchange test arrays positioned
within the graphite moderator. Although reasonable
measures were adopted to minimize the amount of
airborne contaminants that might be introduced into
the system during these periods, the possibility that
significant amounts of oxidants were introduced into
the open vessel cannot be excluded. During the first
period of power operation, when a significant tempera-
ture differential was imposed on the circuit for the first
time (run 4), some corrosion was anticipated as the Cr°
+ 2UF4 = CrF, + 2UF; equilibrium reaction adjusted
to the temperature profile of the circuit. Under these
conditions the increase in the concentration of chro-
mium in the fuel salt could have resulted from the
establishment of the equilibrium reaction and was not
necessarily a signal of the presence of oxidizing con-
taminants.

The increase in the concentration of chromium in the
fuel salt well after run 14 began (see Fig. 6.3) seems to
be inconsistent with the premise that external con-
taminants were the principal cause of corrosion. How-
ever, in the period preceding run 14 part of the graphite
and metal specimens in the core were removed and
replaced. It seems quite possible, therefore, that the
residual concentration of reductant which was gen-
erated within the fuel salt during run 12 was sufficient
to offset the combined oxidizing effects of whatever
contamination was incurred during shutdown and that
characteristic of the fission reaction® only through the
early part of run 14 and that the subsequent rise in

chromium concentration represents the normal com-

pensating shift in the equilibrium corrosion reaction.
Generally, it is assumed that the contaminant most
likely to be responsible for corrosion is moisture.

The inference that moist air was the corrosion-
inducing contaminant calls into question the efficacy of
the flush salt. As an agent for removal of adsorbed
moisture, molten LiF-BeF, flush salt is extremely
effective, as demonstrated in numerous laboratory
experiments, and unquestionably was an effective mois-
ture scavenger. If an oxidizing contaminant or contam-
inants were capable of diffusion within the graphite or
reacting with species deposited in the surface layers of
the graphite, the probability of its removal by brief

75

circulation of flush salt might be slight; instead it might
be released into the salt gradually after the moderator
was heated to high temperatures. Thus, oxygen (per-
haps as CO), rather than water, seems more likely to be
the cause of the observed corrosion. This conclusion is
supported by the fact that the scale found on the nickel
cages which were used to expose Be? to the salt during
run 15 was comprised preponderantly of iron, whereas
on other occasions the principal structural metal in such
scales was chromium. Results of chemical analyses
showed that the prior fuel reprocessing treatment was
effective in reducing the concentration of chromium in
the salt from 133 to 34 ppm and of iron from 174 to
110 ppm. The effectiveness of the reprocessing opera-
tions in reducing Cr?* precludes the likelihood that
significant amounts of Fe** were delivered to the fuel
circuit from the chemical reprocessing plant. The
reduction of Fe?" to Fe® by Be? suggests rather that
Fe?* was generated after the beginning of fuel circula-
tion by an oxidizing contaminant contained in the
closed fuel circuit. As increasing amounts of Be® were
added to the salt mixture, the ratio of metallic Fe/Cr
found on the nickel metal cages was reduced until a
normal balance was reestablished and corrosion ceased
(see Tables 6.3 and 6.4).

Laboratory studies of the stability of FeF, have led
to the conclusion that at equilibrium little or no Fe?"
should exist in the MSRE fuel (see Sect. 2.4.7). The
results of these tests confirmed that, of the structural
metal impurities in the melt, iron and nickel persist
almost entirely as metallic species. The results of other
laboratory studies, particularly those concerned with
the reduction of Fe?" by hydrogen,” suggest that even
in concentrations as large as was found by Manning, the
presence of divalent iron was likely to have resulted
from reoxidation after transfer and remelting of the salt
samples. Subsequent laboratory tests with the MSRE
fuel were precluded by the generation of fission
products in the salt.”

Appraisal of the premise that maintenance operations
might possibly permit the ingress of enough oxygen to
account for the analytical results requires the following
considerations. The cumulative amount of oxidation

“introduced into the fuel salt (during both 235U and

233y operations) based on the increases of chromium
at the beginning of run Nos. 8,-12, 15, and 19 and on

_ the apparent losses of UF; at the end of runs 7, 18, and

19 amounts to 51.31 equivalents, or 410.5 g of 0%", and

corresponds to a cumulative exposure of ~50 ft> of air.

During 233U operations, the amount of oxygen enter-
ing the salt might have been expected to increase the
concentration of oxide by 83 ppm, in excess of the

sensitivity limits for the analytical method and well
above that observed. It must be recalled, however, that
early in 23%U power operations the concentration of
07", as measured experimentally, declined from 120 to
60 ppm, suggesting that under power operation 0%” is
partially removed from the salt as a volatile species. It
may be concluded, therefore, that the corrosion ob-
served in the MSRE is likely to have been caused as

described above but that the mechanism has, as yet, not

been demonstrated unequivocally.

The rationale proposed above has several implications
concerning the behavior of the MSRE during 233U
operations. During the first 16 hr in which fuel salt was
circulated at the beginning of run No. 15, the salt did
not transfer to the overflow tank and behaved as
though it contained a negligibly small bubble fraction.
Thereafter, Be® was introduced, and the bubble frac-
tion began to increase; with further exposures of the
salt to Be® the fraction varied erratically.’® Certainly
the Be reduced the surface tension and thereby
allowed easier transport of gas from graphite to salt,
followed probably by oxidation of the metallic iron
impurity, which acts as an oxidant to the circuit walls.

Corrosion would continue until the oxidants were
consumed. The model of corrosion proposed here has a
relation to the changes in bubble fraction. The corro-
sion data suggest that with respect to its physical and
chemical properties, the fuel did not achieve a reference
state until the beginning of run 17. That its bubble
fraction then was greater than observed in 235U
operations probably was related principally to its lower
density.

The probability that atmospheric oxygen was the
primary causative agent of corrosion in the MSRE was
discounted by Grimes in the following appraisal of the
observed behavior:!!

We find no evidence whatsoever that air was introduced into

~ MSRE during its periods of normal high temperature operation.

There is, on the other hand, no doubt that air in appreciable
quantities was admitted to this reactor system during shut-
downs when the reactor circuit was at temperatures of 300°F or
below. Only a small fraction of the oxygen admitted at such
low temperatures should have reacted with the reactor metal
and should have been available to cause subsequent corrosion.
Flushing of the reactor circuit with helium during the reactor
heatup should have removed most of the ‘unreacted air
(oxygen). Moreover, use of the flush salt before admission of
the fuel should have removed some (and perhaps a large
fraction) of the reacted oxygen. However, some oxidant was
admitted, and some corrosion from this source probably
occurred in MSRE. The evidence suggests that corrosion from
admitted air must have been a small fraction of the minor
amount which took place.

- Since a detailed description of the corrosion picture in MSRE
at all times is not yet available, it is not possible to define the
precise amount of corrosion due to ingress of oxygen. It is
easily possible, however, to set upper limits upon the amounts
of oxygen that could have been involved. These amounts are
small. If all the observed corrosion (as evidenced by rise in CrF,
concentration) in MSRE Runs 1 thru 9 is attributed to ingress

oO

tu

of oxygen the oxide ion concentration of the fuel should have

risen by about 11 ppm. If corrosion (by the same indicator) in
Runs 10 thru 14 were due to oxygen ingress, and if this oxygen

ingress were also responsible for oxidizing all the UF3 created’

by the Be® added during those runs, the oxide ion concentra-
tion of the fuel should have risen by about 25 ppm. During the
entire sequence of runs with 2 SUF, therefore, all the
chemically observed corrosion could be due (it seems very
certain that it was not) to the ingress of oxygen resulting in less
than 40 ppm of added oxide ion in the fuel. Our systematic
chemical analyses for 0% in the MSRE fuel showed no evidence
of such an increase. MSRE was provided with no mechanism
intended to remove or, and we have been unable to postulate
— much less to demonstrate — an inadvertent mechanism for
0% removal. Our methods for determination of 0%" might
possibly fail to find this <40 ppm increase. It seems much more
plausible, however, that the actual increase in 0% was a small
fraction of this figure and that the observed corrosion was due
to oxidation of chromium by UF, through mechanisms similar
to those postulated from many years of testing. It is true that
we have drawn detailed curves of the chromium behavior of the
individual MSRE runs with 235UF,, and we have been tempted
to speculate about them. However, the marked scatter in the
chromium data gives such curves little or no statistical signifi-
cance.

Rise in the chromium concentrations in MSRE Runs 15 thru
19 (that is in the runs fueled with 233UF,) was more dramatic
and the initial increases were almost certainly more statistically
significant. Several pieces of evidence suggest that the 233UF,
fuel, which by virtue of reuse of the carrier salt was necessarily
less well characterized and probably less pure than was the
235QF, initial fuel charge, was relatively oxidizing. This may
have been due to oxygen ingress and oxidation of the MSRE
metal surfaces during the long fuel-change shutdown between
Run 14 and Run 15. If all the corrosion during Runs 15 thru
terminal Run 19, again as adduced from increases in chromium
concentration of the fuel and allowing for oxidation of all
reductant added, is attributed to admitted oxygen, the oxide
ion concentration of the fuel should have increased by some 45
ppm; this increase, again, seems conceivable but unlikely.

In summary, the corrosion picture shows that the quantity of
oxide ion which could have entered the fuel during the whole
MSRE operation (involving 20 separate shutdowns) was less
than 100 ppm. It seems virtually certain that the actual amount
which entered was much less than this. The ZrF4 present in this
fuel would have prevented precipitation of appreciable UO,
even if much larger quantities had entered; oxide ion at the
maximum levels suggested above would not have precipitated
ZrO,. Subsequent corrosion of the reactor circuit through
ingress of oxygen would, however, not have been prevented (or
appreciably affected) by the presence of ZrF,4 in the MSRE;
this would be equally true for ZrF4 in the MSBR fuel.

"It has been postulated that one of the principal
reasons for the expectedly low corrosion observed is
that the metal surfaces of the fuel circuit have been
covered with a film of the noble-meta! fission products
Nb, Mo, Tc, and Ru about 10 A thick. Results of
electron microprobe analysis of the metal surveillance
specimens’? removed from the MSRE in May 1967
lend support to this view in that they did not reveal any

77

 

change in chromium concentration below a depth of 10
i, the limit of measurement, as do the results of
electron. microscopic investigation of the specimens! 2
which indicated that the surface was covered to a depth
of several thousand angstroms by those metals. Al-
though the postulate of a dynamically produced and
autoregenerative noble metal film is an attractive
rationale of the very low corrosion observed in 235U
operations, it fails when the behavior of the MSRE
during the early stages of run 19 is considered. Here,
rapid corrosion was proceeding concurrently with the
generation and presumably the deposition of the same
noble metal fission products which seemed earlier to
have restricted the corrosion of the fuel circuit walls.
Another hypothesis has been suggested recently by
Grimes! 3 as an alternate rationale of data that indicate
the almost complete absence of corrosion during
extended periods of operation, while at other times
rates were more rapid than could be accounted for by
diffusion-controlled mechanisms. It presupposes that
the presence of UF; in the fuel salt does not counter
the corrosion of Hastelloy N effectively once the
concentration of Cr?* in the salt has risen to a level of
~70 to 80 ppm. Rather, at concentrations of this order
and in the presence of the intense radioactive flux in
the reactor core, chromium carbide, Cr;3C,, is formed
at the surfaces of the graphite moderator. The forma-
tion of such a phase thus causes the graphite moderator
to act as a sink for chromium and promotes corrosion
of the container alloy at the most rapid rate allowed by
the diffusion coefficient of chromium. If such a
mechanism operates, the difference in the chromium
concentration as observed in the fuel salt samples and
the maximum possible concentration represents the
quantity of chromium which was deposited at the
surface of the moderator graphite. On occasions when
the oxidation potential of the salt increased substan-
tially, this carbide coating would then decompose and
release large amounts of Cr?" to the salt, thus causing
rapid changes in the concentration of chromium in the
salt samples submitted for chemical analysis to suggest
that the corrosion rate was increasing rapidly. This
hypothesis is attractive for a variety of reasons: (1) it
implies that throughout the operation of the MSRE the
corrosion rate was invariant and diffusion limited; (2)
the [UF;]/[UF,] remains so low in such systems at all
times that attempts to repress corrosion in MSBR fuels
by external adjustment of the [UF;]/[UF,] are
needless, as well as the previously foreseen need to
develop in-line analytical methods for its determination;
and (3) the hypothesis provides a rationale for the
otherwise inexplicably low rates of corrosion which

 
 

 

seemed to characterize operations of the MSRE with
235( fuel.

It seems unlikely that significant quantities of chro-
mium carbides will have formed on the moderator
graphite surfaces for the following reasons:

1. In run No. 15, the principal constituent of the slag
found on the nickel cages used for the introduction
of beryllium was iron (see Sect. 6.7). Presumably,
this iron deposit was formed by reduction of Fe?*
from the melt and represents a condition in the melt
which is so oxidizing that, if present, the relatively
unstable compound Cr3C; (AG, 90° = —23 kcal)
should have decomposed completely during this

period. The possible amount of chromium which

should have been released to the fuel salt by such
decomposition, as calculated using diffusion coeffi-
cients from 1 X 107'% to 4 X 107'* cm?/sec,
. would increase .the concentration of chromium in
the fuel salt to values of 240 to 480 ppm (see Table
6.2), that is, to much higher concentrations than
were observed at any time during MSRE operations.

2. The coincidence of apparently stepwise increases in
Cr followed maintenance periods (as noted previ-
ously).

3. The carbides of niobium are more stable than is
Cr3C,; in 233U operations the oxidation potential
of the salt increased gradually during runs by fission

78

had no detectable effect of the mechanical properties of
the specimens. The cracks in the control rod thimbles,
however, were deeper than previously observed, at some
locations as deep as 7 mils, some ten times the depth
of the generalized attack indicated by changes in the
concentration of chromium in the fuel salt. Curiously,
several fission products, preponderantly tellurium, had
penetrated to depths comparable with those of the
cracks.

It is not possible to ascribe this attack to radiation

"effects per se, for in-pile tests with salt-graphite-alloy

to the point that niobium entered the salt (see Sect.

6.5) and was subsequently reduced and removed
from the salt by Be addition; under these conditions,
Cr3C, should have become reoxidized, entered the
salt, and increased the chromium concentration of
the samples sharply, where, in fact, no perturbation
of the average concentration of chromium was
noted.

In postoperational examinations with one of the
stringer bars from the reactor core, a search was made
to ascertain whether or not a coating of chromium
carbides adhered to the surface. No evidence of such a
coating was found.

A surprising result of the postoperational tests per-
formed with specimens of the MSRE control rod
thimbles was the observation of anomalous intergran-
ular penetration of the alloy which had been exposed to
the fuel salt. Occasionally, inspection of Hastelloy N
specimens removed from the reactor core showed grain
boundary cracks at the surfaces. of specimens subjected
to tensile tests. These cracks appeared in material
strained at room temperature, which is not normal for
Hastelloy N, but they penetrated only a few mils and

assemblages prior to tests with the MSRE showed no
corresponding effects. These unpredicted results have
caused a renewal of the investigation of materials
removed from the MSRE, with the initial objectives to
determine if fission products are indeed the cause of
grain boundary separation.

While the initial results seem to implicate tellurium as
a causative agent, its role is not positively identified.
One mechanism, proposed before tellurium was be-
lieved to have deposited preferentially, relates the
attack to impurities in the following way. Electron
microscopic examinations of Hastelloy N show typi-
cally that an unidentified group of complex phases
comprised of Mo, Cr, C, N, and B, morphologically
similar to face-centered M,C carbides, are deposited
preferentially at intergranular surfaces. It is also ob-
served that the loss of ductility that occurs with
Hastelloy N after irradiation correlates with more
pronounced intergranular fracture. Such behavior very
possibly means that the chemical activity of the
carbide-like phases deposited in these locations is
increased. If so, it would not be surprising to find that
these phases were highly susceptible to oxidative
corrosion. It was noted previously that two unusually
oxidative regimes occurred in the MSRE, at the
beginning of run 15 and again at the beginning of run
19. In an earlier assessment of corrosion of the MSRE
fuel circuit we have deduced that the most probable
oxidant at those periods was atmospheric oxygen.!* We
reach the tentative conclusion, therefore, that the
intergranular attack noted was a result of attack by
oxygen on the carbide-like phases deposited at inter-
granular surfaces. If oxygen were released from the
moderator, as suggested previously, the first metal
which it might contact would be the control-rod
thimbles. It seems likely, therefore, that the inter-

granular penetration observed in the postoperational

tests resulted from the development of unusually
oxidative conditions in the MSRE and is atypical of
normal reactor behavior. The overall results of corro-
sion surveillance in the MSRE, while not totally

in
 

@

+)

 

unequivocal, appear to indicate that corrosion behavior
in molten-salt reactors can properly be anticipated to be
negligible over the planned use period of these reactors.
Furthermore, the probability of recurrence of the
anomalous penetration in future reactors can be
assessed in tests with the modified alloys which are
currently under development and which will contain a
group of carbides perhaps unlike those found in the
MSRE alloy.

6.4 Additions of Reductants and
Oxidants to the Fuel Salt

As discussed earlier in this report (Sect. 6.3) the fuel
salt, free of moisture and HF, should remove chromium
from Hastelloy N only by the equilibrium reaction

Y%.Cr° + UF4(d) = Y,CrF,(d) + UF;3(d) .

When the above corrosion equilibrium was first estab-
lished in MSRE power operations, the UF; produced in
this reaction, together with that originally added to the
fuel concentrate, should have totaled 1500 g, with the

result that as much as 0.65% of the uranium of the

system could have been trivalent soon after the begin-
ning of power operation. The UF; content of the
MSRE fuel was determined after approximately 11,000
MWhr of operation to be no greater than 0.05%. The
fuel salt was considered to be far more oxidizing than
was necessary and certain to become more so as
additional power was produced unless adjustment was
made in the UF; concentration. A program was
initiated early in 1967 to reduce 1 to 1.5% of the
uranium inventory to the trivalent state.

On the basis that it met chemical criteria and that its
introduction “into fuel salt could be accomplished
conveniently, beryllium metal was selected as the most
suitable substance to use for in-situ reduction of U(IV)
in the fuel salt. Results of laboratory tests had shown
that the metal would be sufficiently reductive to
require exposure for conveniently short periods of time
but was not so reductive as to cause concern that it
might reduce U(IV) to the metallic state. The pure
material was available in forms that were easily accom-
modated for use with the sampler-enricher device, and
the metal afforded a maximum of reductive equivalents
per unit mass. . So

Initially, 4 g of beryllium was introduced into the salt
by melting a mixture of ?LiF-BeF, carrier salt and
powdered beryllium in the MSRE pump bowl sampler
cage. Subsequently, three additions were made by
suspending specimens of %-in.-diam beryllium rods in

79

the salt in the pump bowl. The capsules used for adding
beryllium were similar in size to those used for sampling
for oxide analysis but were penetrated with numerous
holes to permit reasonable flow of fuel salt. The
beryllium rods were found to react with fuel salt at a
steady rate, dissolving at approximately 1.5 g/hr. A
summary of all the additions of reductants and oxidants
introduced into the fuel salt system via the sampler-
enricher apparatus is given in Table 6.5.

With 235U fuel salt, all dissolutions of beryllium
metal into the fuel salt proceeded smoothly; the bar
stock which was withdrawn after exposure to the fuel
was observed to be smooth and of symmetrically
reduced shape.

No significant effects on reactivity were observed
during or following the beryllium additions, nor did the
results of chemical analyses indicate that the actual
concentration of U(III) had increased until after run 12
had begun (see Table 6.6). The additions preceding run
12 had increased the U** concentration in the total
uranium by approximately 0.6%. Four exposures of
beryllium were made at close intervals during the early
part of that run. Samples taken shortly after the last of
these four exposures (FP-12-16 et seq., Table 3.1)
began to show an unprecedented increase in the
concentration of chromium in the specimens, followed
by a similar decrease during the subsequent sampling
period.

Previous laboratory experience has not disclosed
comparable behavior, and no well-defined mechanism
was available at the time to account satisfactorily for
the observed behavior. Speculation as to the cause,
partially supported by experimental data, included the
following consideration.

- On the two occasions when the most rapid rates of

dissolution of the beryllium rods were observed, chro-
mium values for the next several fuel samples, FP-11-10
et seq. and FP-12-16 et seq., rose temporarily above the
10 level and subsequently returned to normal. That the
increase in chromium levels in samples FP-12-16 to.-19

was temporary indicates that the high chromium

concentration of fuel samples removed from the pump
bowl was atypical of the salt in the fuel circuit and

implies that surface-active solids were in suspension at

the salt-gas interfaces in the pump bowl.
That atypical distribution of species in this location
does indeed take place was demonstrated earlier by the

analysis of sample capsule support wires that were (1)

submerged below the pump-bowl . salt surface, (2)
exposed to the salt-gas interface, and (3) exposed to the

.pump-bowl cover gas. The results showed that the

noble-metal fission products, Mo, Nb, and Ru, were

deposited in abnormally high concentrations at the
salt-gas interface. Such behavior suggests that the high
chromium concentrations in the fuel specimens were
caused by the occurrence of chromium in the pump
bowl in nonwetted, surface-active phases in which its
activity was low. A possible mechanism which would
cause such a phenomenon is the reduction of Cr?" by
Be® with the concurrent reaction of Cr® with graphite
present on the salt surface to form one or more of the
chromium carbides, for example, Cr;C, (AH =_21
kcal at 298°K). Such phases possess relatively low
stability and could be expected to decompose, once
dispersed in the fuel-circuit salt.

The possibility that surface-active solids were formed
as a consequence of the Be? additions was tested late in
run 12 by obtaining salt specimens at the salt-gas
interface as well as below the surface. First, specimens
were obtained in a three-compartment sample capsule
that was immersed so that the center hole was expected

to be at the interface (Fig. 6.4). Next, a beryllium metal
rod was exposed to the fuel salt for 8 hr with the result
that 9.71 g of beryllium metal was introduced into the
fuel salt. Twelve hours later a second three-compart-
ment capsule was immersed in the pump bowl. Its
appearance after removal from the pump bowl is shown
in Fig. 6.5. Chemical analyses of the fuel-salt specimens
FP-12-55 and -57 did not show significant differences in
chromium; however, the salt-gas interface in FP-12-57
was blackened as compared with FP-12-55 (Fig. 6.6).

An additional purpose of sampling with the three-
compartment capsule was to determine whether foam-
like material was present in the sampler area and would
be collected in the upper compartment. Globules were
noted on the. upper part of FP-12-57 (Fig. 6.5),
indicating that conditions in the pump bowl were
substantially different after beryllium was added to the
fuel salt.

the presence of dendritic crystals along with a small
amount of salt residue (Fig. 6.7). Spectrochemical
analysis of material removed from the basket (Fig. 6.7)
indicated that the material contained 7.8 wt % chro-
mium and less than 10 ppm of iron and nickel.

The evidence obtained did not permit inference as to
the identity of the phases which formed within the
pump bowl as a consequence of the beryllium addi-
tions. It strongly implied that nonwetted flotsam can be
formed and accumulated temporarily in the MSRE
pump bowl.

During this period, fuel salt accumulated in the
overflow tank steadily during operation and remained
there in relative isolation from the fuel stream. At
intervals of about one day, part of the salt (60 Ib) was
returned to the fuel stream. Recognizing that chromium
might be injected into the pump bowl as the salt
returned, we performed an experiment in which salt
samples were obtained from the pump bowl within an
hour after fuel was returned from the overflow tank to
the pump bowl. The purpose of the experiment was to
determine whether material from the overflow tank
contributed appreciably to the perturbations in the
chromium concentration. The results were negative,
possibly, in part, because sampling and salt-transfer
operations were not performed concurrently for safety
reasons.

In view of the mechanism developed recently'® to
account for the transport behavior of the noble metal
fission products in the MSRE, we can infer that the
exposures of beryllium which generated high concen-
trations of chromium in the salt samples simply reduced
the Cr?" in the flowing fuel salt to the metal, which in
turn became a part of the particulate pool of suspended
metals at the surface of the salt in the pump bowl. It
remained there temporarily, gradually oxidizing to the

fluoride as it reacted with the fuel salt.

In their examinations of the behavior of the noble
metal fission products, Kirslis and Blankenship’? did
not observe a significant effect of fuel reduction on the
noble-metal concentrations in the fuel. The concentra-
tions frequently rose rather than fell, as expected, after
adding beryllium. They noted that the °°Mo, !°3Ru,

106 Ru, and '32Te showed parallel rises and falls. The

99Mo results were extraordinarily high for samples
FP-11-8 and FP-11-12. The high values were checked by
reruns on fresh samples. If all the 2°Mo produced by
fission remained uniformly distributed in the fuel, the
calculated concentration would be 1.4 X 10'! dis

produced by neutron activation of the ®®Mo in the first

0.1-mm thickness of the Hastelloy N reactor contain-
ment vessel diffused instantaneously into the fuel melt,
the increase in ??Mo concentration would be only
about 10° dis/min per gram of fuel. It thus appeared
that a mechanism was operating which either concen-
trated fission-produced ®?Mo and other noble metals in
the pump bowl or resulted in large temporal and spatial
variations in their concentrations. Dissolved °°Mo
would undoubtedly be uniformly distributed. If the
noble metals circulated as a suspension of insoluble
metal particles, it was reasoned that they might
concentrate in the pump bowl or vary in concentration
with pump bowl level, cover gas pressure, and other
operating variables. Since clean metal surfaces are not
wetted by the fuel salt, there might also be a tendency
for metal particles to collect around helium bubbles,
which are probably most numerous in the pump bowl.

The ?*Nb concentrations varied erratically and did
not parallel the behavior of the other noble metals. This
was ascribed to analytical difficulties. An unavoidable
difficulty was that a large correction for *$Zr decay
must be made for each salt analysis.

From the beginning of operations of the MSRE with
233 fuel, the behavior of the fuel salt during and after
exposure to the beryllium rods was markedly different

changes’ concurrently, the exact way in which these
changes altered the void fraction of the salt cannot,
therefore, be evaluated exactly, although some aspects
of the observed phenomenon can be attributed tenta-
tively to the additions.

If, as inferred in Sect. 6.3, atmospheric oxygen was
the causative agent for the increased oxidation potential
of the salt, release of the gas from the moderator
graphite might well have been triggered by a reduction
in the salt-gas interfacial tension, resulting in an increase
in the bubble fraction of the salt.

Photographs of the cage assemblies removed from the
fuel pump bowl after exposure to the fuel salt are
shown in Figs. 6.8--6.23. While none of these cages
appeared to have been wetted by salt during 235U
operations, each of those removed after treatment of
the 233U salt showed evidence that salt had wetted the
nickel cage and had adhered to it. A typical example is
shown in Fig. 6.17. The presence of bubbles is
suggested by the appearance of the upper part of
capsule FP-17-8 (Fig. 6.17), on which structures of
collapsed bubbles seem to be visible.

Of particular significance to the interpretation of the
behavior of the fuel salt from August 1968 to January
1969 are the changes in the relative amounts of iron

. and chromium contained in the deposits on the nickel

than previously observed. A detailed description of the

changes in fluid salt and gas behavior during these
periods is described in a separate report.!® Introduction
of beryllium metal into the 233U fuel salt apparently
caused a major perturbation of salt-gas interactions and
resulted in an increase in void fraction of the fuel salt.
The exact reasons for development of the greater void
fraction that persisted throughout 233U operations
have not been completely determined. In addition to
the purely chemical effects which resulted from the
addition of beryllium and other reductants, other
factors such as pump speed, variation in the solubility

of inert gases as a function of hydrostatic pressure, |

difference in density of the 235U and 233U fuel salt,
and changes in interfacial tension were recognized to. be
related. ‘ Interaction of beryllium with the fuel salt
during run 15 caused a major change in only one
physical property of the fuel — its surface tension. This
is the most puzzling aspect of the effect of beryllium on

cages that were used to suspend beryllium into the
pump bowl (Table 6.5). From this and other chemical
evidence we deduced that corrosion in the fuel circuit
was not checked until early in 1969. By that time, the
bubble fraction in excess of that observed in 235U
operations was reduced to a fraction that could in
general be accounted for by the other factors men-
tioned above. It may be speculated that the coincidence
of the disappearance of reactivity blips with reestab-
lishment of the expected ratio of structural metal
fractions in the residues adhering to the nickel cages
was indicative of the removal of the last fraction of

‘anomalous excess of bubbles in the fuel salt.

Among the conjectures advanced to account for the
excessive rates of salt transfer during this period was
one based on the recognition that sharp gradients in the

density profile of the fuel salt in the pump bowl

the fuel salt in run 15 since the effect was unprece-
dented in the fuel system. However, slight changes in:

interfacial energies in fluid systems are known to
account for marked changes in hydraulic behavior.
Since the addition of beryllium in the early part of the
2331 operations effected both chemical and physical

existed; from this it was suggested that voluminous
amounts of foam were developed in the pump bowl.
There was no evidence that such foam had existed in
235 operations, but rather that a salt mist was present
in the pump bowl. Indication that such a mist existed
was obtained by suspension of a cage-rod assembly of
nickel into the pump bowl during run 14. Photographs
of the assembly after removal from the pump bowl
(Fig. 6.10) show that the surfaces of the rod exposed to

the vapor just above the salt were coated with con-
densed droplets. Although the vapor space in the
sample shroud was probably more quiescent than that
in the pump, it was reasoned that foam should also
appear here if it were prevalent in the pump bowl.

Attempts” to produce foam were performed in the
laboratory!® but were unsuccessful. Tests for foam
production consisted of measurements of the fuel salt
level in a 10-in.-diam nickel vessel at intervals during the
reduction of essentially all of the uranium to its
trivalent state and after stepwise oxidation of the nickel
with nickel fluoride. Melt levels were determined by the
abrupt change in electrical resistance noted as the
insulated nickel rods made contact with the salt
mixture. Without exception, the tests showed no
evidence of the development of a foam either by
increasing or decreasing the oxidation potential of the
salt.

In an attempt to identify other possible agents which
might cause development of foams in fluoride melts,
Kohn and Blankenship! ® tested the effect of each of

‘the additives: carbon dust, graphite powder, beryllium

metal, finely divided nickel metal, and pump oil vapor.
They were unable to promote the development of
stable foams with any of these additives in clean melts.
Foams were formed only by introducing enough water
into the melt, either in the sweep gas or by adding solid
hydrates, to give a definite cloudiness. Even so, the
foam would collapse very quickly after the purge gas
stream was removed.

The phenomena observed in run 15 and later remain
as puzzling because the opportunity to perform realistic ‘
tests to resolve unanswered questions was lost with the
termination of operations of the reactor. It appears that
development of a void fraction of unprecedented
magnitude took place during a period of rapid corrosion
of the containment system and that contaminants
which entered the core of the reactor while it was
exposed to the atmosphere during maintenance were
the source of the corrosion. These contaminants mark-
edly affected the interfacial energies of salt-metal,
salt-gas, and salt-graphite surfaces but did not generate
foam in the fuel circuit. The conditions which allowed
these events to occur are avoidable and are atypical of
the operating procedures that are projected for future
MSR’s.

Additional investigation of the physical properties of
molten salts will be necessary to establish quantitatively
the relationships of interfacial energies in salt systems
to the retention of and stability of bubbles in flowing
streams. The initial stages of these investigations can
properly be carried out in the laboratory; however, the
results may prove to be irrelevant unless the effect of

‘highly radioactive fluxes on the properties is shown to

be inconsequential.

6.5 Effect of Uranium Trifluoride on the
95 Nb Concentration of the Fuel Salt

Minor adjustments in the concentration of uranium
trifluoride in the MSRE fuel salt were made occasion-
ally during the period when the MSRE was operated
with 235U fuel. Their primary purpose was to offset
the oxidizing effects anticipated to result from the
fission reaction. Within -this period the [U3']/[ZU]
concentration ratio was estimated to have varied within
the range 0.1 to ~1.7% (Fig. 6.24). No evidence was
found that indicated that such variation effected
significant changes in either corrosion rate or fission
product behavior in the fuel salt within the reactor.
This derives from the fact that the 235U fuel was a
highly buffered system in comparison with the 233U
fuel used later; that is, the total amount of uranium in
the 235U fuel exceeded that contained in the 233U fuel
by sixfold. In contrast, operation of the MSRE with

2337 fuel showed pronounced changes in the corrosion
rates and fission product chemistry as the concentration
of UF; was altered. Of considerable interest was the
appearance of *SNb in the fuel salt, noted for the first
time in initial operations with 233U fuel.2® This
observation signaled the potential application of the
disposition of **Nb as an in-line redox indicator for
molten-salt reactors.

Operation of the MSRE with 233U fuel thus gave
evidence that pronounced changes in fission product
and corrosion chemistry resulted ‘as variations of the
concentration of UF; in the fuel salt were made. The
2331 fuel was experimentally more tractable for study
than the previous charge of 235:233U fuel because of
the much lower uranium inventory carried in the 233U
fuel.. A serious disadvantage was realized, however,
when it was discovered that the total amounts of UF;
which were obtainable in samples of the 233U fuel
caused the previously satisfactory method?! used for

determination of U?* in the fuel salt to be of little value
and required the development of new methods of
analysis.

Adjustments of the uranium trifluoride concentration
of the MSRE fuel salt were made frequently during
233U operations in order to study the inhibition of
corrosion by control of the [U**]/[ZU] concentration
ratio and to evaluate the possible application of °5Nb
disposition as a redox indicator. The experimental
results obtained during this period of operations pro-
vided concrete evidence that values of the equilibrium
constant for the reaction Cr° + 2UF, = CIF, + 2UF;,
as assigned from standard free energy and activity data,
are reasonably accurate. Together with niobium distri-
bution data they show that after the fuel system had
been opened for maintenance the fuel salt subsequently
appeared to become oxidizing with respect to the
MSRE containment circuit even though it did not seem
to have caused corrosion in the drain tanks. Compari-
sons of the relative fraction of the ?SNb inventory

which appeared in the fuel salt as the redox potential of
the salt changed indicated that when mildly reducing
conditions were imposed, as for steady-state operation
of the MSRE, niobium very likely became involved in
reaction with the moderator graphite to form niobium
carbide.

‘During August and September 1968 the 233U fuel
charge was constituted from ?LiF->*3UF, and "LiF-
BeF,-ZrF, carrier salt which had previously contained
235,238F,. Concurrent with the inception of corro-
sion in the fuel circuit, as evidenced by a rapid increase
in the concentration of Cr in the fuel salt (Fig. 6.25),
niobium began to appear in the fuel salt for the first
time?! and persisted there until 28.80 g (6.54 equiva-
lents) of Be® had been added. During this period the
concentration of chromium in the salt rose from 35 to
65 ppm, indicating the removal of 140 g (5.89
equivalents) of chromium from the circuit walls. Thus,
when ?SNb disappeared from the fuel salt after the
final addition of beryllium (sample FP-15-62), a total of

1969

Fig. 6.25. Corrosion of the MSRE fuel circuit in run Nos. 15 and 16, September—December 1968.

12.43 equivalents were involved in the reduction of
Fe? and establishment of the Cr® + 2UF, = 2UF; +
CrF, equilibrium. Samples of the salt obtained during
the brief period of the subsequent run (No. 16) as well
as the beginning of 233U power operations in run No.
17 (FP-164 and FP-17-2) showed the presence of 52
and 29% of the °° Nb inventory respectively.

In Fig. 6.26, nominal values of [U*]/[ZU] are
shown for runs 17-20. These operations comprise
nearly the total power operation of the MSRE with
233U fuel. The concentrations of UF; shown in Fig.
6.26 are based on the assumption that 0.76 equivalent
of oxidation results from the fission of 1 at. wt of
uranium® and that the maximum power achieved by
the MSRE was 7.4 MW(t). They also assume that the
observed increases in the concentration of chromium in
the fuel salt at the beginning of runs 19 and 20 are
indicative of the total loss of U3* from the salt; the

‘nominal values for [U3*]/[ZU] at these instants are

thus shown as zero. The equilibrium constant for the
corrosion equilibrium Cr® + 2UF, = 2UF; + CiF,
reaction at 650°C, assuming an activity for Cr° in the
Hastelloy to be 0.03,3 is 1.271 X 107. Thus, in a regime
such as that which prevailed during the initial stages of
run No. 19, the rate at which Cr° is leached from the
Hastelloy N circuit gradually decreases as the Cr®*
concentration of the fuel salt increases. During the
initial period of run No. 19 the Cr** concentration of
the circulating fuel salt rose from 72 to 100 ppm. At
that point the equilibrium concentration of
[U**1/[ZU] in the fuel salt anticipated from free
energy and activity data is ~0.5%.

The disposition of *>Nb in the 233U fuel during the
initial period of run No. 19 indicates that when
[U**]1/[ZU] was less than ~0.5%, Nb became oxidized
and entered the salt, possibly as Nb3* or Nb**. Then, as
the corrosion reaction Cr° + 2UF, = 2UF; + CF,
proceeded to equilibrium, the U%*/ZU concentration
ratio increased, and at a [U*]/[ZU] value of 0.5%,
9SNb precipitated from the fuel salt. Two levels of
nominal U*/ZU concentration are given during run
Nos. 17 and 18, the higher values based on the assump-
tion that corrosion of the fuel circuit during the early
stages of run No. 17 may have accounted for a fraction
of [U3*]/[ZU]. The extent to which this reaction might
contribute to the total concentration of UF; in the fuel
at the beginning of run No. 17 is obscure, because the
MSRE was operated at full power at the inception of
run No. 17. Such operation deposits the noble metal
fission products on the surface of the Hastelloy N,
causing the activity of Cr° at the alloy surface to be
effectively reduced. The beginning period of run No. 19
is not analogous, for not until the corrosion equilibrium
was established was the reactor operated at full power
for sustained periods.

Freeze-valve samples were obtained at the request of
E. G. Bohlmann and E. L. Compere during runs Nos.
17-20. Their analyses of the salt removed from the
pump bowl showed °5Nb disposition as indicated by
the data points in Fig. 6.26. It is evident that, as
[U**]/[ZU] decreased below 0.5% in run No. 17, *>Nb
was oxidized and distributed to the fuel salt, to be
removed subsequently as this concentration ratio was
exceeded. Of the data shown in Fig. 6.26 only the

second data point in run 18 appears to be anomalous. It
seems likely that this result represents incomplete
equilibrium since the sample was obtained just after
[U%*]1/[ZU] had been adjusted to a nominal value of
0.7%. In view of the fact that Be®, in contact with the
molten fuel, generates reduction potential gradients
which result in the reduction not only of U** to U%*
but of Cr* to Cr® as well, one might anticipate a
kinetic factor to be significant in Be® = Be, U¥ =
U*, Cr®* = Cr°, Nb* = Nb® equilibria in the MSRE
fuel salt.

The results described in Fig. 6.26 indicate that when
the [U%*]/[ZU] of the 233U MSRE fuel was poised at
~0.5%, disposition of ®*Nb toward solution in the salt
or deposition within the reactor was at a null point,

and, as indicated by behavior during 23*U operations,
the U3*/°SNb ratio is the controlling factor. At 0.5%
U3 this ratio is 8.5/1.

Little is known concerning the chemistry of niobium
in the MSRE fuel salt. Preliminary results of laboratory
experiments indicate?? that under mildly oxidative
conditions niobium assumes an oxidation number of
~3.7. The fact that during run 15, when the oxidation
potential of the fuel salt was sufficiently high to permit
Fe?* to exist in the salt in significant concentrations,
nearly all of the Nb inventory of the fuel salt was in
solution, whereas in subsequent operations when the
oxidation potential was less, no greater than ~50% of
the ®$Nb was found in the salt. This behavior seems to
indicate that when niobium was deposited on the

“

moderator graphite it reacted to form niobium carbide
and that under the various redox regimes which were
established in the MSRE during runs 17 to 20 niobium
carbide was not removed from the moderator graphite.
The prevalence of niobium as the carbide is compatible
with the experimental observations by Blankenship et
al.!® and as noted by Cuneo and Robertson?3 who
found that the concentration of 5Nb at all profiles in
three different types of graphite was greater than would
have been anticipated if after deposition the isotope re-
mained as the metallic species.

7. DETERMINATION OF REACTOR POWER

7.1 Power Estimates with 235 U Fuel from Heat
Balance and Other Methods

Estimates of the power developed by the MSRE can
be derived from nuclear and heat balance data. Both
bases were used from the beginning of power operations
with the MSRE. As refinements and corrections were
introduced into the physical property and nuclear data,
new estimates were made. Consequently, MSR Program
progress reports cite various values for the maximum
average power of the reactor ranging between 7 and 8
MW(t).

The results of the investigation described in this
chapter fixed the maximum power of the MSRE at 7.4
MW(t), a value with which other estimates have more
recently agreed.

The power generation rate of the MSRE was cal-
culated routinely by an on-line computer; power
production was determined from computation of the
heat balance in the fuel and coolant systems. Details of
the methods employed are described elsewhere.!?
Once heat balances were established, nuclear instrumen-
tation systems were calibrated to correspond to the
nuclear power indicated by the heat balance.

The results of chemical and isotopic analysis of fuel
salt were assessed carefully throughout the period when
the MSRE was operated with 225 U fuel and later when
the fuel charge was comprised of 223U and plutonium,
with the purpose of employing these results to monitor,
if possible, the power generated by the reactor.
Attempts to use chemically determined values of the
concentration of uranium in the fuel-salt samples were
generally unsatisfactory because of the point-to-point
scatter in these data and because of the overwhelming
effect that the use of flush salt in the fuel circuit had on
the uranium concentration base lines. The amounts of
fuel- and flush-salt residues remaining in the fuel circuit
after drains were estimated by comparisons of the
chemical analyses of uranium in the flush salt with
those in the fuel salt during each period of use. Not
until the uranium concentration of the flush salt had
undergone several increments was the precision of the
average mass of fuel-salt residues narrowed to within +5
kg. This was, however, of insufficient precision to
afford a sufficiently accurate base line for computation
of the power generation. It was thus evident that the
results of wet chemical analyses for uranium in the fuel
salt would be of potential use in establishing burnup
rates only after long periods of power generation which
were free from drain-flush-fill interruptions.

Until March 1968, calculations of the heat balance
indicated that the maximum power generated by the
MSRE was 7.2 MW(t). By that time, a discrepancy
between nominal concentration and analytical values
for uranium in the circulating fuel salt began to appear;
the analytical data over an extended period in run No.
10 showed a negative divergence from the nominal
concentration of the uranium in the fuel of about 10%.
During this period, however, computations of the
reactivity balance did not indicate corresponding or
anomalous decreases in the fissile concentration of the
salt. Reactivity balance calculations had previously
indicated that this method of evaluating reactor per-
formance was sensitive to a factor of 10 greater than
chemical analysis with respect to detection of changes
in uranium concentration of the fuel. The chemical data
suggested that the maximum actual power output of
the reactor was ~8.0 MW rather than 7.2 MW. However,
little credibility could be accorded to this conclusion
for the reasons cited above.

By early 1968 a sufficient amount of 236U was
generated in the fuel salt to suggest that comparison of
the analytical results of mass spectrometric measure-
ments would provide a good measure of the integrated
power. Tests of this comparison? yielded a slope that
was within 1% of the theoretical slope for a power

generation rate of 7.2 MW. The uncertainty in the
theoretical slope was regarded to be probably less than
10%, and the actual integrated power was probably
within 10% of the value indicated by the heat balances
(see Fig. 7.1).

Although the 236U production rate seemed to con-
firm estimates that indicated the maximum power
output to be 7.2 MW, suspicion was growing that the
heat balance calculations were in error, for data
collected at different power levels indicated that the
value employed for. the specific heat of the LiF-BeF,
coolant salt was not temperature dependent,* whereas a
temperature-dependent relationship was employed in
the heat balance.’

A program of laboratory measurements of the en-

~ thalpy of solid and liquid Li, BeF, from 273 to 900°K

was completed at this time, by investigators at the
National Bureau of Standards,’ from which it was
shown that the heat capacity was 0.56 cal g™*(°C)™*. A
fluoride mixture was synthesized for confirmation at
ORNL of the NBS value. Results of these measurements.
indicated that the derived heat capacity of the coolant
salt was 0.577 + 0.008 cal g™(°C)™*,” in good
agreement with the NBS investigations but substantially
higher in the operating temperature range of the MSRE
than the previously used value, and showed essentially
no variation with temperature. The new value of the
specific heat was incorporated into the computerized
heat balance computations prior to the beginning of

1“
 

ur

 

operation with >33U fuel. Calculated full-power level
was changed from 7.2 to 8.0 MW as a result of the
revision in the value for specific heat and in accord with
the analytical chemical results. :

Throughout this entire period, changes in the nominal
amounts of uranium isotopes in the fuel salt were
computed based on average cross-section data for
thermal and epithermal neutron reactions in the MSRE
spectrum that were current to 1965.8: The con-
sumption and production rates were:

234y —2.167 x 10™* g/MWhr

235y —5.417 X 1072 g/MWhr

236y +1.083 X 107! g/MWhr

238y —7.017 X 1072 g/MWhr
Total —5.146 X 1072 g/MWhr?

7.2 Power Output of the MSBR Based on the Isotopic
Composition of Plutonium

The potential use of plutonium as a fuel for molten-

_ salt reactors has been assessed periodically for more

than a decade. The results of one early study! ® showed
that a PuF;-fueled two-region homogeneous fluoride
salt reactor was operable, although its performance was
poor. Further development was not pursued for neither
the chemical feasibility nor methods for improving its
performance were obvious. - Although. the thermo-
chemical properties of the plutonium fluorides were not
well established at that time, it was clear that the most
soluble fluoride, PuF,, was too strong an oxidant for
use with the available structural alloys. The solubility of
PuF3, while sufficient for criticality even in the
presence of fission fragments and nonfissionable iso-
topes of Pu, was assumed!! to limit the amount of
ThF,; which could be added to the fuel salt. This
limitation, coupled with the condition that the con-
tinuous use of 23°Pu as a fuel would result in poor
neutron economy in comparison with that of 233U-.
fueled reactors, vitiated further efforts to exploit the
plutonium fluorides for application in two-region
MSBRs.

Recent developments in fuel reprocessing chemistry

and in reactor design have established the feasibility of
single-fluid molten-salt breeder reactors. One of the
alternative modes of operating such reactors is to
employ plutonium in place of enriched 235U for the

101

initial fuel loading and startup of the reactors. Assess-
ments of plutonium to start up MSBRs in this way have
concluded that plutonium should prove to be a very
satisfactory alternative to enriched uranium, either as
initial fuel for a molten-salt breeder reactor or as initial
fuel and subsequent feed material.! 214

It now appears that it will be possible to operate an
LiF-BeF,-ThF,-PuF; single-fluid molten-salt reactor
with lower concentrations of thorium and plutonium
than earlier considerations required, for example, with
thorium fluoride concentrations of 8 to 12 mole % and
with a plutonium fluoride concentration of approxi-
mately 25% less than required for 233U loading, that is,
<0.2 mole %. These conclusions indicated the de-
sirability of demonstration experiments to examine, in
as nearly similar application as possible, the behavior of
plutonium in an MSBR. The chemical feasibility of this
application was evaluated! ® and found to hold promise
for successful application. Therefore, when the MSRE
resumed operations with 233U fuel, plans were made to
include plutonium as a constituent of the fuel. Using
pre-1965 cross-section data and assuming that the
maximum operating power of the reactor was 8.0 MW,
efforts were initiated to establish a material balance for
plutonium.

During the final period of operation with 235-2387
fuel, a sufficient amount of plutonium was generated
for its detection in salt samples to be tractable by
standard analytical methods. Approximately 600 g of
plutonium was generated in the MSRE fuel as it was
operated with 235U fuel by neutron absorptions in
2387, enough to afford a comparison of the analytical
data with anticipated values. The results of that
comparison, expressed as a material balance for plu-
tonium, showed that the analytical chemical methods,
which were previously satisfactory for determination of

~ the concentration of plutonium in the fuel salt, were of

questionable utility for use with the 233U fuel charge
and that isotopic dilution methods, using mass spectro-
metric analyses, afforded the most satisfactory means
of analysis. They indicated, in addition, that at the
maximum concentrations in which plutonium occurred
in the MSRE fuel salt, it existed as a stable chemical
entity and, by inference, that Pu, O; is not precipitated
in the presence of low concentrations (50 to 60 ppm)
of oxide ion.

‘The net production rates for plutonium generated in
the 235,238(J fuel salt have been estimated! ® to be

where

G* = mass of k in circulation (g) (k = 238, 239, 240
refers to 238U, 23Pu, and 24 °Pu respectively),

T = time-integrated power (MWhr) .

_ At termination of the #35U experiment, 589 g of
plutonium should have been generated in the fuel salt
with the reactor operating at a maximum power of 8.0
MW. For a fuel charge of 4900 kg, this corresponds to
120 ppm. The average concentration of plutonium in
the fuel salt, as determined from the results of analyses
of 18 fuel-salt samples obtained during the latter period
of power operations with 235-238 fuel, was 118 ppm.
The analytical data do not show a significant trend and
are probably not sufficiently precise to use as a basis to
infer that a real difference exists between calculated
and analytical values. On completion of these power
operations, uranium was removed from the fuel salt by
fluorination.!? It was anticipated that the plutonium
would remain in the carrier salt. Five samples of the
carrier’ salt were removed from the fuel drain after
fluorination and found to have an average concen-
tration of 120 ppm of plutonium, representing a total
of 562 g, as compared with an expected value of 125
ppm; that is, 27 g of plutonium is not accounted for by
the results of these analyses.

The concentration of plutonium in a salt specimen is
calculated from the relation:

Concentration of Pu (ppm) = dpm/g X 3.97 X 107%
+(238NX 1.470 + 23° NX 5402 X 1073 + 240
X200X 1072 +241 X 4.10X 107°

+292¥X 35% 107%),

where N is the atom fraction of plutonium as the
isotope designated.

The concentration of plutonium in each of the 10-g
samples of fuel salt taken since the beginning of 23°U

102

7.1). This value indicates the presence of a total of 689
g of plutonium; thus the enriching salt might then have
been expected to contain 100 g of plutonium. In an
attempt to substantiate this conclusion, a sample of the
TLiF-233UF, enriching salt was obtained from a
section of transfer line at the TURF and submitted for
chemical and mass spectrometric analysis. The salt
residue which was contained in the line was considered
to be typical of that delivered for use in the MSRE. The
results of mass spectrometric analysis showed that this
salt contained plutonium, 1.64 wt % of which was
238py, Revised conversion factors were therefore re-
quired for calculation of the total plutonium concen-

tration of the TURF salt and 23U fuel salt because of

the high specific activity, 6.46 X 10° dis sec” ug™,
for 238Pu. The plutonium concentration of the TURF
salt appears now to have been 249 ppm using the
revised factor and corresponds to the addition of 16.4 g
of plutonium along with the ’LiF-233UF, eutectic.
Current estimates of the nominal concentration of
plutonium are now based on the assumption that this

"amount of plutonium was added to the fuel salt and,

operations was determined using conversion factors

which assumed that the plutonium in the MSRE
consisted entirely of 23°Pu and 24°Pu. The average
concentration of plutonium after full loading of the
reactor was achieved was found to be 147 ppm (Table

therefore, that the MSRE contained ~605 g of plu-
tonium at the beginning of 233 U power operations.

A plutonium inventory of the MSRE fuel was
computed, both before and after loading with 233U
fuel, based on Prince’s estimates of the production and
fission rates for plutonium and on the assumption that
16.4 g of plutonium was contained in the enriching salt.
These values showed that the plutonium production
rate during 235 U operations was greater than previously
anticipated and, correspondingly, that the relative
changes in 2#°Pu and 23°Pu during 233U operations
were also slightly different.

Estimates of the variation of 23°Pu and 2*°Pu during
recent power operations require that the quantity and
composition of the final plutonium inventory be known
accurately. As noted previously,! 8 and as shown in Fig.
7.2, attempts to determine the concentration of plu-
tonium in the fuel salt from gross alpha count measure-
ments were not very satisfactory because of the high
specific activity of 238Pu. An improved estimate of the
plutonium inventory of the system was made from
extrapolations of the observed changes in **°Pu and
240py in the beginning stages of power operation with
233(J fuel. The initial 24°Pu/?3°Pu concentration ratio
was computed to be 0.0453, with the plutonium of the
reactor at that point as 568 g, approximately 2% more
than estimated from previous analyses. Current esti-
mates of inventory values have been computed for this
revised starting inventory. The values obtaining at the

~ time the samples were taken were based on estimated

average values for the rates of change of 23°Pu and
24%Py in the period between samples (Table 7.2).
In the MSRE, fluid fuel was circulated at rates which

105

were sufficiently rapid with respect to changes in the

isotopic composition of the fissile species that the salt
samples removed from the pump bowl were repre-
sentative of the circulating stream. This characteristic of
molten-salt reactors makes it possible to use the results
of isotopic analyses for a variety of purposes. One
potential application, that of appraising the cumulative
power generated by the MSRE at various periods,
became apparent with the initiation of 233U opera-
tions, for with 233U fuel the isotopic composition of
the plutonium inventory (produced partly by that
generated in 235U operations as well as from that
added later) would change significantly during power

Additions of plutonium to the fuel salt as PuF; were
accomplished smoothly by use of capsules sealed by 12
zirconium disks. These containers were designed and
loaded by Carr et al,'® a typical capsule is shown in
Fig. 7.3. In contact with the fuel salt the zirconium

production and would possibly serve as an accurate,

indicator of the power produced.

About 600 g of plutonium was produced during
power operations with 235U fuel. Thereafter, addi-
tional plutonium was introduced into the fuel salt as a
contaminant of 7 LiF-?33 UF, enriching salt and later to
replenish the fissile inventory of the MSRE during
233 power operations. oo

 

Resolution of the analytical problems with plutonium

showed that estimated production rates of plutonium in

the 235U fuel salt, based on pre-1965 cross-section
data, were low. The programs used for reactor physics
calculations were revised using post-1965 data, and as a
consequence, both consumption and production rates
for * plutonium and uranium isotopes were revised
significantly.??

Samples of the MSRE fuel salt were submitted
routinely for determination of the isotopic composition
of the contained fissile species. Comparisons of the
results of plutonium assays with nominal values that
should result from operations at various power levels
from ~7 to 8 MW were made. Within this range, best
agreement between calculated and experimental values
was obtained for a maximum power output of ~7.40

MW(t). A comparison of calculated and observed values
for the isotopic g¢omposition of plutonium which
should result from a maximum power output of 7.40
MW is shown in Table 7.3 and in Fig. 7.5. Agreement
tests indicate that the standard deviation between
calculated and observed values is +0.63% and that the
average positive bias in the experimental data is 0.093%.
On this basis the maximum power output was 7.41 *
0.05 MW(t). The precision of this value seems to be
adequate for related analyses of reactor operations.

It is considered unlikely that further refinements in
cross-section data for the plutonium isotopes will

_require any substantial changes in the calculated in-

ventories used for this comparison. However, for the
purpose of estimating uncertainty in the combined

cross-section data ‘and neutronic model used to cal-

culate reaction rates, an equivalent of +2% in the power
output is judged conservative. The results of experi-
ments designed to measure the 233U capture-to-
absorption ratio in the fuel of the MSRE were reported
recently by Ragan.?! From these results he concluded
that the full-power output of the reactor was 7.34 +
0.09 MW, in excellent agreement with our value.
Further corroboration of these estimates was provided
by Gabbard?? in a recent reevaluation of the accuracy
of the data produced by the MSRE coolant salt flow
transmitters. He found that either the pressure trans-

mitter or the square-root converter component, which
generated 2- to 10-v signals for the computer, was
faulty and caused the device to indicate higher than
actual flows. Using a corrected flow rate of 793 gpm
rather than a nominal flow rate of 850 gpm, as
indicated by the computer, to recompute the heat
balance power, he estimated that the full-power output
of the reactor was 7.65 MW rather than the previous
value of 8.2 MW.

7.3 Isotopic Composition of Uranium during
233y Operations

For operation of the MSRE with 233U fuel, esti-
mation of the power output of the MSRE from
meastired changes in isotopic composition of the fissile
material is achieved with considerably greater precision
from analyses of plutonium than from uranium. This
arises from the fact that the rate of change in the
relative fraction of the most abundant isotopes for
plutonium, 23°Pu and 2%°Pu, is some four times that
for the uranium pair, 233U and 234U. Analyses of the
isotopic composition of uranium in the fuel circuit
during 233U operations were employed; therefore,
primarily to determine whether they afforded approxi-
mate confirmation of the power estimate as inferred
from the plutonium data (Sect. 7.2). Calculations of the

isotopic composition changes of the uranium in the
MSRE fuel circuit that should have accompanied
operation of the reactor at a maximum power output of
7.41 MW(t) were made and compared with the results
of mass spectrometric analyses. The results of this
comparison are shown in Table 7.4 and in Fig. 7.6; they
indicate that the changes observed in the isotopic
composition of the uranium were in excellent agree-
ment with those of plutonium.

7.4 Isotopic Composition of Uranium during
235y Operations

Once the anomalies in the power production of the
MSRE were resolved by analysis of the mass spectro-
metric data, and assisted by refinements in the cross-
section data, internal consistency developed quickly
among various other analytical results. In particular, use
of the final estimate of power generation at a maximum
rate of 7.4 MW to appraise both isotopic analysis and
chemical analyses for uranium during the 235U oper-
ational period showed that these results were entirely
consistent with those for uranium and plutonium
during 233U operations. In addition, the revised esti-
mates in the changes in consumption and production
rates for 2340, 235, 236, and 238U, together with
improved values for the amounts of uranium transferred
to the flush salt, brought nominal and analytical values
for the concentration of uranium in the fuel into good

“agreement as shown in Table 7.5.

Isotopic composition of the uranium in the circu-

lating fuel salt was recalculated on the basis that the

reactor had operated at 7.4 MW and that the con-
sumption and production rates of the uranium isotopes
at this power level were those given in Prince’s revised
estimates.?® A comparison of the results obtained is
shown in Table 7.5. It will be noted that the greatest
disparity in nominal and analytical values listed in Table
7.5 is observed for 238U. In Sect. 3.6 it is noted that
further analysis of these data led to the conclusion that,
of the 238U nominally charged to the MSRE drain

computation of these results in line with that con-
clusion would bring the nominal and observed values
for the relative fractions of uranium isotopes, as listed
in Table 7.5, into even closer agreement.

8. PHYSICAL PROPERTIES
8.1 General Properties

Successive refinements in the design or in operational -

criteria for molten-salt reactors evoke repeated reap-
praisals of the accuracy and precision of the available
physical property data for reactor materials.

112

coolant salts were reconfirmed, while for some proper-
ties, the values originally employed appeared to be of
questionable accuracy. The properties of greatest signif-
icance in these respects were viscosity, thermal conduc-
tivity, electrical conductivity, phase transition behavior,
heat capacity, heat of fusion, density, expansivity,

* compressibility, vapor pressure, surface tension, solu-

As experience with the MSRE grew, most of the

values for physical properties of the fuel, flush, and

bility of the gases helium, krypton, and xenon, isocho-
ric heat capacity, sonic velocity, thermal diffusivity,
kinematic viscosity, and Prandtl number. Of these, the
precision and accuracy are intrinsically variable and
depend on methods of measurement or estimation.
While the accuracy for some classes of properties, for
example, liquidus-solidus temperatures, developed to be
of minor concern, others, such as surface tension and
heat capacity, had neither been measured nor were
measurable with the precision that was desirable for
reactor performance evaluations. In response to MSRE
program requirements, reappraisals and refinements of
physical property data were repeatedly made whenever
it was feasible. The final evaluation led to values which,
for the coolant and flush salt, are summarized in Table
8.1 and, for the fuel salt, are summarized in Table 8.2. -

8.2 Density of Fuel and Coolant Salts

Laboratory measurements of the density of molten
fluoride mixtures were performed by various groups of
investigators before the MSRE was operated. The
precision in the results, however, was considered to be
less than desirable for use in on-site calculations of
reactivity balances and for appraisal of temperature
effects. An effort was made, therefore, to make direct
measurements with the reactor that would serve these
purposes and that would afford independent measure-
ment of the salt inventories. An early account gives a
perspective on the success of these efforts:

The weigh cells on all the salt drain tanks were calibrated with
lead weights shortly after the equipment was installed and
before the tanks and connected piping were heated. Additional
data were obtained with the tanks hot during various salt-charg-
ing and transfer operations. These data served both to calibrate
the weighing systems and to give a measure of the density of the
salts at operating temperature. Throughout the operation, salt
inventories were computed from weigh-cell readings, using scale
factors and tare corrections obtained from the calibration tests. -

Cold and hot calibration of the coolant drain-tank weigh cells
gave scale factors differing by less than 0.5%. Fuel drain tank 2

. (FD-2) was calibrated hot twice, with flush salt and with fuel

carrier salt; scale factors were within 0.2% of each other but
were about 4% higher than the original, cold calibration. The
reason for this discrepancy has not been established.

The coolant-salt density was measured in the reactor by three
different methods; values ranged from 121.3 to 122.3 Ib/ft? at
1200°F, ’, with an average of 121.9 Ib/ft3. When flush salt, which

is identical with coolant salt, was charged into FD-2, the
amount of salt added between two level probes indicated a
density of 124.5 1b/ft3. A density of 120.9 Ib/ft3 was
computed from the pressure required to lift salt from the drain
tank to the fuel loop. Weigh-cell indications of flush-salt
density, using the “hot calibration factor, ranged from 123.2
to 131.5 b/ft3 at 1200°F; the “cold” calibration factor would
have given 118.4 to 126.3 Ib/ft>. The data on coolant- and
flush-salt densities thus tend to support the “cold” calibration
factor for FD-2. :

The density of the fuel carrier salt, LiF-BeF,-ZrF4 (65-30-5
mole %) was measured as the salt was being charged to FD-2.
This measured density, computed from externally measured
weights and the volume between the level probes in FD-2, was
140.6 Ib/ft3 at 1200°F. Addition of all the uranium added
through run 3 would be expected to increase the density by
about 5.3 Ib/ft3. Four measurements were made after the
uranium was added, using the weigh cells and the level probes.
Densities based on the “hot” calibration of the weigh cells
ranged from 149.9 to 152.2 Ib/ft3, with an average of 151.0
1b/ft3 at 1200°F. With the “cold” scale factor the average was
145.1 1b/ft3, very close to the expected density.

Salt densities were computed on several. occasions from the
change in weigh-cell readings as the fuel loop was filled. In every
case the computed density was less than given by other means,
suggesting that a full loop volume may not have been
transferred.

The temperature coefficients of density for the salts were
computed from the change in salt level with loop temperature.
Measured values of (Ap/p)/AT were: for the coolant salt, —1.06
X 107% CF)! (average of three measurements); for the flush,
—1.15 X 10™* CF)"; and for the fuel salt, —1.09 Xx 10™* and
-1.15 x 107 CF)! (two measurements).

The bulk of the inventory data accumulated to date is on the
flush salt, because more transfer and fill-and-drain operations
have been done with this salt. Calculated inventories (using
“hot” scale factors) have ranged from 1.7% below to 2.6%
above the nominal or “book” inventory for no ascribable
reason.

With continued experience it became evident that
on-site measurements of salt masses were less and less
reliable and would have little consequence in appraising
reactor performance - because of inaccuracies in the
weigh-cell measurements. In the absence of such infor-
mation the amounts of salts delivered to the circulating
system or remaining in the drain tanks were approxi-
mated from values of the density of the salt mixtures
and the dimensions of the container vessels. Efforts
were initiated to appraise and improve, if feasible, the
accuracy and precision of data pertaining to the
densities of molten fluoride mixtures.

Relatively few measurements of the densities of liquid
salt mixtures were made in the development of molten:
salt technology at ORNL: prior to MSRE operations.
Experimental values for the densities of a number of

ZrF 4 -containing mixtures were made as. a part of the

Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion program.? Similar measure-
ments, which employed the buoyancy principle, as did

the ORNL program, were made later with LiF-BeF,-
UF, mixtures by the Mound Laboratory3 under con-
tract ‘work with ORNL. Most density values for the
mixtures used in the MSR program, however, were
estimated by the method of mixtures.2 This method
was believed to have an accuracy of approximately
5%.

In an effort to obtain more accurate values for the
salt mixtures used in the MSRE, attempts were made to
develop new methods for the laboratory determination
of the densities of molten salt mixtures. Employing a
new technique, Sturm and Thoma? obtained density
measurements for the MSRE fuel and coolant-salt
mixtures. Measurements of the depth of salt in a
cylindrical container of accurately known dimensions,
which was contained in a controlled atmosphere glove
box, were obtained using an electrical probe attached to
a vernier caliper. Contact of the probe with the melt
was indicated by completion of an electrical circuit

through the caliper and the melt. Appropriate correc-

tions for thermal expansion at a particular temperature
were applied for the container and the probe. Although
some shortcomings were evident in the procedure,
principally owing to the effects of small amounts of
liquid adhering to the probe, it afforded a direct
measurement of the densities of liquids which were
visually observable during measurement. The results of
the measurements were found to be in satisfactory
agreement with on-site measurements of the densities of
the salt stored in the drain tanks.5 Laboratory efforts
were therefore discontinued. Concurrently, a method
for estimating densities which assumes additivity of
molar volumes was devised by Cantor. With continued
refinement, the method was developed to the extent
that its accuracy was within 5%. A comparison of the
densities of the MSRE fuel and coolant salts, as found
using the several methods described above, is given in
Table 8.3. Coo

On the basis of reactor. physics analysis, it was
estimated that the average fraction of the fuel charge
circulated during ‘power runs with the MSRE was 92%.
This value, together with a value of the volume of the
circuit ‘computed from component dimensions, 71.3
ft*, and the mass of the circulated charge as deduced
from chemical and isotopic analyses (Table 2.6), indi-
cates that the density of the 235 U fuel at the beginning
of power operations was 139.01 Ib/ft3, whereas the
value computed by Cantor’s method is 139.9 Ib/ft3. In
more recent application of Cantor’s method to- other
salt mixtures, excellent agreement has been found
between estimated and observed values. Such confirma-
tion, along with its apparent precision for MSRE fuel

salt, permits the inference that the most accurate values
of MSRE salt densities have been derived by this
method.

An important characteristic that easily tends to pass
unnoticed from attention is that LiBeF, is unique
among the complex fluorides which have significance in
molten-salt reactor technology, in that it undergoes the
least volume change associated with the melting-freez-
ing transition of any of the compounds encountered.
This value has not been measured directly but can be
estimated by assuming that the linear coefficients of
thermal expansion for Li, BeF, and LiF are similar
enough to be used interchangeably. If this assumption is
valid, the density of Li;BeF, is 2.064 g/cm® at the
melting point, about 6% less than at room temperature.
The density of liquid of the stoichiometric composition
at the melting point, as indicated by the density
expression in Table 8.1 is 2.021 g/cm®. These two

values indicate that, on melting Li, BeF,, the density is

reduced only about 2.07%.

It is important to recognize that the MSRE fuel,
coolant, and flush salts were nearly of the composition
Li, BeF;, and to some extent the freedom that the
MSRE showed from difficulties with freeze valves and
from distortion of the radiator tubes under off-specifi-
cation cooling conditions? is due to the very small
volume change this compound undergoes at the melting
point.

8.3 Crystallization of the MSRE Fuel

Laboratory studies of fluoride mixtures were carried
on for some years before the MSRE was operated. In
these studies, the crystallization behavior of the LiF-
BeF,-Z1F4-UF, (65-29.1-5-0.9 mole %) mixture was
established to approximate that of the MSRE fuel salt
when it operated with 23°U fuel. Crystallization was
found to follow the equilibrium crystallization se-
quence described below:

On cooling the liquid mixture to 434°C, crystalline
Li, BeF, is formed. This phase continues to precipitate
on further cooling, and at 431°C, Li, ZrF¢ begins to
crystallize; the onset of crystallization by the tertiary
phase, LiUF;, begins at 416°C. The liquid portion of
the mixture decreases but is present down to tempera-
tures as low as ~350°C. When completely frozen, the
fuel at equilibrium should be composed of crystalline
Li, BeF,, Li, Z1F¢, LiUFs, and BeF, in volume frac-
tions of 0.735, 0.204, 0.032, and 0.029 respectively.
The usual cooling paths for LiF-BeF,-ZrF,-UF, mix-
tures of compositions similar to the MSRE fuel involve
a glassing of the BeF,-rich liquids that are low melting
and, thus, the last to freeze. Hence, crystals of pure
BeF, are generally not expected; rather, the last liquid
solidifies as glass which incorporates variable amounts
of the phases listed above with BeF,.

The homogeneity generally characteristic of multi-

component salt mixtures in the liquid state is progress- -

ively destroyed as the mixture undergoes gradual

crystallization. The possibility that the MSRE fuel

mixture, LiF-BeF;-ZrF4 -UF, (65-29.1-5.0-0.9 mole %),

‘might, on cooling in the MSRE drain tanks, experience

sufficient solid-phase fractionation to create potentially
hazardous conditions was examined in laboratory-scale
experiments. Some 650 g of simulated fuel salt was
cooled at rates approximating that expected of the
entire drain tank assembly and that expected of the fuel
alone, 3.46 and 0.387°C/hr respectively. In both cases

the radiative cooling geometry was controlled to simu-.

late as nearly as possible that expected in the drain
tanks, even though it was realized that the horizontal
AT profile in the cooling radioactive fuel mixture
would probably be substantially different from that
prevailing in the laboratory experiment.

The concentrations of uranium were found to be

identical at the top and bottom fractions of each of the -

two ingots, irrespective of cooling rate. A photograph

of the ingot resulting from the slower cooling rate

experiments is shown in Fig. 8.1. Chemical analyses of
the salt specimens from each of the locations designated
in Fig. 8.1 were obtained. For areas 1 to 7, the uranium
concentrations were found to be 2.94, 3.49, 4.15, 3.32,
4.28, 4.62, and 5.74 wt %. In comparison with the
nominal concentration of uranium in the MSRE fuel,
5.13 wt %, these experiments show a maximum increase
of 23.4% in uranium concentration on very slow static
cooling. A fact which accounts for the small degree of
segregation of the uranium phases in these experiments
is that, at the onset of crystallization of LiUFs,
simultaneous crystallization of the three solid phases

Li, BeF,, Li; ZrFs, and LiUF; takes place. In addition,

the volume of the liquid phase is being reduced steadily,
so sharply, in fact, that in this experiment as well as in
similar previous ones, some of the liquid phase was
apparently occluded among dendritic-like crystals of
the solidified phase, a phenomenon which helps prevent
compositional variation in the mixture.

In the freezing of multicomponent mixtures, maxi-
mum segregation of crystalline phases takes place under
equilibrium cooling conditions. The segregation repre-
sented by the results obtained in the fractionation
experiments described here represents, in a practical

way, the nearest approach to equilibrium cooling that

the MSRE fuel salt may experience in a single crystalli-
zation sequence.

The crystallization behavior described above pertains
exclusively to the fuel-salt mixtures used in the MSRE
and is, of course, quite unlike that for fuel mixtures

proposed for use in a molten-salt breeder reactor.
Crystallization equilibria similar to those for the

9. INTERACTIONS OF FUEL SALT WITH
MODERATOR GRAPHITE AND SURVEILLANCE
SAMPLE MATERIALS

A new method of in-situ analysis for lithium, beryl
lium, and fluorine was invented by Macklin, Gibbons,
and Handley! in response to our appeal for their
assistance in examination of graphite specimens re-
moved from the MSRE core. The method they devised
employed proton bombardment of target nuclides and
measurement of the yields of neutrons and gamma rays
produced. It was found to be applicable for measure-
ment of the concentration of target nuclides in graphite
at the few-parts-per-million level as a means to deter-

- mine the extent to which MSRE fuel salt components

penetrated into the graphite under radiation. This

method has .the advantage of applicability to matrix-

dispersed samples and in the presence of considerable
radioactivity from fission products, features which
make it well suited to the examination of MSRE
graphite.

The results obtained by these workers were reported
in detail previously.?' There remain several puzzling
aspects of their findings, and because of this the results
are reviewed here.

Data were obtained from three samples, (1) a control
sample (Y-5 from CGB bar 635) exposed to nonradio-
active salt, (2) sample Y-7, removed from the reactor
core after 33,400 MWhr of exposure in May 1967, and
(3) sample X 13, removed March 25, 1968, after 66,637
MWhr of exposure.

Specimens were moved across a beam of 2.06-MeV
protons collimated through a slit of 0.0075 cm width at
the ORNL 3-MV Van de Graaff accelerator. Measure-
ment of the resulting prompt gamma rays from
19F(p,ay)! ¢O showed that fluorine varied in sample
X-13 from 350 ppm near the surface to 60 ppm at the
center (Fig. 9.1). The observed ratio of fluorine to
lithium was near that characteristic of the MSRE fuel
(Fig. 9.2). However, as shown in Figs. 9.1 and 9.3, the
lithium and fluorine did not show a simple dependence
on depth.

Results of the examination of sample X-13 suggested
that much of the Li and F came from bulk intrusion, a
finding which differed from that resulting from the
previous examination of sample Y-7 (Fig. 9.4), where

the Li/F ratio became increasingly higher at greater
distances from the surface. Equally puzzling is that
comparisons with the results of the analysis for 235U
by Kirslis and Blankenship* (see Figs. 9.1 and 9.3)
showed that the relative concentrations of F and 235U
became steadily divergent with penetration depth and
thus seemed to rule out bulk salt intrusion as a
mechanism. Further, in the absence of radiation, a
control specimen showed less penetration of both salt
and uranium by a factor of 100. The possibility was
considered that introduction of a fuel aerosol from the
gas phase, as was suggested to rationalize the intrusion
of certain fission products,’ was responsible for fuel
having penetrated the graphite voids as an aerosol. The
cause of this phenomenon is still not resolved.

The uranium profiles shown in Figs. 9.1 and 9.3 were
derived in the investigation by Kirslis and Blankenship,
in which it was found, from delayed neutron activation
analysis, that the uranium concentration profile ranges
from values as high as 100 ppm at the surface to 6.5
ppm at 50 mils depth, but “in most cases, the total
range of variation of the 23°U concentration in 50 mils
penetration was less than two orders of magnitude. This
moderate slope indicates a higher mobility for uranium

(in graphite than for most fission products [but] ...

represents only 1 g of 235U per 1000 kg of graphite.

Although the results of the proton reaction analysis
described by Macklin and co-workers do not seem to
permit quantitative generalization, they do suggest
several points of significance to further development of
molten-salt reactor technology:

1. The penetration of the graphite moderator by
lithium and fluorine appears to be real, if not
massive. Only samples of CGB graphite were ex-
amined in the experiments performed by Macklin et
al. Whether similar penetrations of more dense or

coated graphites can be expected for improved
MSBR graphites is not estimable from the current
results.

. Effects of salt-gas-graphite interfacial properties on

transport of lithium and fluorine through films is
unknown at present.

. The current data were derived from a fuel salt with a

composition, LiF-BeF,-ZrF4-UF, (65-29.2-5.0-0.8
mole %), whose effect on transport conceivably may .
differ from that for the MSBR. Whether the trans-

port would be markedly affected by the large
heavy-metal concentration of the MSBR fuel, con-
taining a total of 12 mole % ThF, + UF,, is of
“justifiable curiosity.

The results obtained indicated with 23%U fuel salt
that there are a number of parameters whose quanti-
tative relationship to the transport of salt species to
moderator graphites should be examined by further
examination of graphite specimens, especially those
removed from the MSRE core after completion of the
23315 experiments. Several notable differences between
233y and 23%U operations existed, including for 233U

"operation a uranium concentration less than 20% of

that with 235U, a continuously higher void fraction in
the fuel salt, and variable differences in the gas-salt
interfacial tension. The latter two of these factors were.
regarded as possibly conducive to enhanced transfer of
materials to the graphite moderator and prompted
further examination of graphite specimens from the
MSRE.

In postoperational examinations of a graphite stringer
from the MSRE core vessel, Kirslis and Blankenship®
obtained spectrochemical and delayed neutron analyses
of the graphite milled from the surface of the stringer.
Analyses by the proton bombardment method were not
performed. The analytical results that were obtained
were in partial agreement with the earlier results of
Macklin and co-workers and indicated bulk penetration

of the fuel salt, probably via cracks in the graphite, to a
depth of ~2 mils. In contrast, however, they did not
indicate penetration to greater depths. Although the
results of the two groups of analyses are in good
agreement with respect to penetration of the outermost
layers, Kirslis and Blankenship did not find anomalous
divergence in the relative concentration of any of the
components, nor did they find that uranium pene-
tration had occurred to greater depths. The absence of
detectable amounts of uranium in the graphite at
depths where uranium.had been detected with samples
from 235U tests tends to support a model of bulk salt
penetration, since the 233U concentration of the fuel
was less than 20% of that of the 235 U fuel.

Applications of new and increasingly sensitive
methods of analysis, such as the proton bombardment
method, in molten-salt research and development
programs are significant to the continued development
of the technology. Continued refinement and adapta-
tion of this new method are highly desirable within the
framework “of future research programs for possible
application to MSBR development.

10. CHEMICAL SURVEILLANCE OF AUXILIARY
FLUID SYSTEMS

| 10.1 Water Systems

Potable water from the ORNL distribution system
was supplied to the MSRE for a variety of uses as

. described in the MSRE Design and Operations Report:

After passing through a backflow preventer, the water is used
in the liquid waste system, in the vapor-condensing system, for
general cleanup of equipment, as makeup for the cooling tower
water system, and for cooling of the charcoal beds. Two

- tower water, which is cooled by a two-fan induced draft cooling

tower. The cooling tower water is used for air compressors, air
conditioners, in the chemical plant, for the lube-oil systems, in
the charcoal beds, and for condensing steam from the drain
tank steam domes. (Process water can also be used for this.)
Cooling tower water is also used in a shell-and-tube heat
exchanger to provide cooling for the treated water system. Two
230-gpm centrifugal pups circulate treated water in a closed

supply would require only cursory attention. However,
when power was first generated with the MSRE, it was
found that the chemicals used in the treated water
system had become activated. The source of the activity
was identified as *2K, produced from the potassium

-nitrite—potassium tetraborate mixture used to inhibit

loop to cool in cell components. Makeup water is supplied by .

condensing building steam in a shell and tube heat exchanger
using cooling tower water as the coolant. Treated water is also
used to fill the Nuclear Instrument penetration. This water is
continuously recirculated through a closed loop by a 5gpm

pump to maintain uniformity of the water condition through-

out the penetration, In order to minimize corrosion, potassium
tetraborate and potassium nitrite were added to the water
supply and maintained at concentrations of 500 and 1500 ppm,
respectively. Steam condensate is also used to supply water to
* the feedwater tanks. This untreated water is used in the drain
tank bayonets to remove decay heat from the reactor fuel after
the reactor has been drained.

The several water systems at the MSRE were sampled
periodically and analyzed to determine corrosion rates,
buildup of contaminants, loss of. corrosion-inhibiting
chemicals, etc. Water samples were submitted regularly
for chemical analysis in the General Analysis Labo-
ratory. At more frequent intervals, on-site tests were
performed to give continuity to the control data and to

corrosion in the system. Extrapolation of the radiation
levels observed at low power indicated that if the
reactor were operated for extended periods at full
power, equilibrium radiation levels of about 400 mR/hr
would prevail in the heat exchanger in the diesel
equipment room and in the water control room.

As the alternative, the potassium-containing inhibitors

. were discarded and replaced with an analogous lithium-

based mixture, highly enriched in the 7Li isotope to
minimize tritium production. Lithium nitrite was pre-

- pared commercially by ion exchange from potassium

reduce dependency on analyses from the laboratory.

Details of sampling procedures, methods of additions of
corrosion inhibitors, and of onsite testing procedures
are givén in the MSRE Design and Operations Report,
Sect. 6-1.1

10.1.1 Cooling tower water. Samples of the cooling
tower water were tested on-site daily to check the
concentration of its chromate ion, which served as a
corrosion inhibitor, pH, and hardness. Samples were
submitted on a weekly basis for laboratory analysis,

where more complete analyses were performed. In use, -

the cooling tower water supply was maintained in the
pH range 7 to 8, concentration of chromate ion at 30 to
50 ppm, hardness <250 ppm (as CaCOj;), and Fe <0.03
ppm. The results of laboratory analyses with cooling
tower water samples are listed in Table 10.1.

10.1.2 Treated water supply. A supply of treated
water was circulated within a closed system to remove
heat from the thermal shield and other equipment in
the reactor and drain cells. A program of water system
surveillance was incorporated into the procedures em-
ployed at the MSRE to minimize the probability that
operational difficulties would arise from this auxiliary
system. Since standardized methods for control of the
water chemistry of auxiliary systems such as those
which existed in the MSRE were fairly well stand-

nitrite and lithium hydroxide for this use. After the
4000-gal treated-water system was diluted with de-
mineralized water to reduce the potassium from 800 to
3 ppm, the desired inhibitor concentration was attained
by adding ”Li nitrite, boric acid, and ? Li hydroxide.

When the reactor was next operated at power, in run
S, activation again occurred, this time caused by the
presence of sodium, ~1 ppm of which was present in
the demineralized water from the ORNL: facility.
Condensate was produced at the MSRE with less than
0.1 ppm of sodium and used to dilute the sodium in the
treated-water system to 0.3 ppm. The concentrations of
sodium and ®Li were thereafter reduced to sufficiently
low concentrations that shielding and zero-leakage
containment of the water system were not required.

Criteria were established for the treated water after
replacement of the inhibitor mixture to meet the
following specifications: pH: 7.0 to 9.0, Na* <3 ppm,
NO, = 760 to 860 ppm, B= 57 ppm, K* <8 ppm, AAl
= 0 ppm, Fe = 0 ppm, tritium < 2.2 X 10° dis min?
cm™3, AZ hardness (as CaCO3) = 0 ppm.

Chemical analyses of treated-water samples were
obtained at frequent intervals in order to maintain these
specifications and as guides for adjustments of the
concentrations of chemicals in the treated-water system
supply. On-site tests were also performed with greater
frequency than laboratory analyses for control of

" operations, with supplementary analyses obtained from

the Analytical Chemistry laboratory at approximately

biweekly intervals. The results of the chemical analyses

obtained for treated-water samples obtained from the
circulating system are listed in Table 10.2. Those
obtained from the nuclear instrument penetration are
listed in Table 10.3.
 

 

 

The results listed in Tables 10.2 and 10.3 do not
warrant detailed comment or interpretation because
they were used primarily as guides for controlling the
concentrations of the corrosion inhibitors. It is evident
from the results listed that they served satisfactorily for
this purpose, and that the treated-water systems were
essentially free of operational difficulties.

10.1.3 Vapor condensing system. Among the water
supplies which were subjected to routine chemical

surveillance was included in the reservoir of the vapor
condensing system. This system was incorporated into
the MSRE for service only under the accident con-
ditions described in the MSRE Design and Operations
Report, Part I If an accident occurred in which hot
fuel salt and the water used to cool equipment inside
the cells became mixed, it would be necessary to
contain within the MSRE the steam generated by the

.accident. A vapor condensing system, shown sche-

matically in Fig. 10.1, was provided to prevent steam
pressure from rising above the 40 psig allowable
pressure for the cells and to retain the noncondensable

124

gases. The vapor condensing tank in this system was

kept about two-thirds full of potable -water at all times
from 1964 to 1969.

Corrosion inhibition in the water reservoir tank was
effected by addition of potassium nitrite and potassium
tetraborate, as in the recirculated water systems. The
water supply in the water reservoir tank was to meet
the same specifications as the circulating systems.

Samples obtained from the vapor condensing tank were
analyzed at approximately semiannual intervals. The
results of these analyses are listed in Table 10.4. It may
be noted from the last entry in Table 10.4 that the final
analysis of the vapor condensing system water reservoir
was made more than one year before termination of the
reactor experiment. The reason is implicit in the results
listed, which show adequate stability of the corrosion
inhibitor during the entire period water was stored in
the reservoir tank.

10.2 Helium Cover Gas

Helium was used to fill voids in the salt circulation
systems with an inert protective gas. Commercial
helium, supplied from tank trucks, was passed through
a purification system to reduce the oxygen and water
content to below 1 ppm before the gas was admitted to
the reactor. The helium supply was passed continuously
through the fuel pump bowl at ~200 ft3/day (STP) to

127

transport the fission product gases to activated charcoal
absorber beds. The cover gas system was also used to
pressurize the drain tanks to move molten salts into the
fuel and coolant systems. Exhaust gas from these
operations was discharged through the charcoal beds
and filters to the atmosphere via the off-gas stack.
Incoming helium gas was passed through hot titanium
sponge and then through a moisture analyzer to ensure
that the purity of the gas was not degraded by inleakage

of moisture at faulty connections. Samples of the

helium supply were obtained from each new trailer of
the gas delivered to the reactor site and were analyzed
using mass spectrometric methods. The upper limits of
the allowable concentrations of contaminants in the gas
prescribed in design and operations specifications were
set at <I ppm oxygen and <6 ppm water. Results of
the mass spectrometric analyses performed with
samples of the helium gas supply (Table 10.5) showed
that the supply was consistently of adequate quality for
use in the MSRE.

10.3 Reactor Cell Air

128

Composition of the reactor cell atmosphere was
adjusted to consist primarily of nitrogen containing less -

than 5% oxygen. Oxygen was maintained at this low
concentration to minimize the possibility of com-
bustion hazards which might occur if lubricating oil
leaked from the fuel ‘salt circulation pump system.
Nitrogen was added to the cell as needed.to make up
for air inleakage. The normal cell pressure was 12.7
psia, with a maximum permissible air inleakage rate of
0.42 scth. Under these conditions the required nitrogen
purge rate was 1.5 scfh. Samples of the atmosphere of
the reactor cell were obtained periodically and sub-
mitted for mass spectrometric analysis in order to
ensure that the specifications were met. Results of these
analyses are listed in Table 10.6.

. At termination of operations with the MSRE, in-
spection of the reactor cell components was initiated,
the preliminary results of which indicated that the
machinery in the cell remained relatively free of
atmospheric corrosion. The details of these exami-
nations were not complete at the time this report was
made and will appear subsequently in progress reports
of the Molten Salt Reactor Program.

10.4 Oil Lubrication Systems

Each of the two salt pumps in the MSRE was served
by an independent lubrication oil system, inter-
connected so that either system could serve both pumps
in an emergency. These oil systems supplied both oil for
lubrication of bearings and seals, as well as for cooling
pump radiation shields. Details of the oil circulation
systems are described elsewhere. Specifications of the
oil to be used in the MSRE were recommended by
Grindell in 1960.4

The MSRE employed a turbine-grade paraffinic-base
lubricating oil having a viscosity of 66 SSU at 100°F,
commercially available as Gulfspin-35. No attempts
were made to characterize the lubricating oil com-
pletely during. reactor operations, for in these oper-
ations the principal concern was that its lubricating
properties would not be degraded in use. Composition
and physical property analyses were performed rou-
tinely to provide this assurance. The composition
analysis conformed with the average specifications for
the product; for Gulfspin-35 analytical specifications
fixed the carbon content of the paraffinic hydrocarbon
at 85.4 wt %. The average formula of the paraffinic
compound conforming to this fraction is C39H,5.

Little was known. about the identity of the additives
in the MSRE lubricating oil, except that nominally they
were thermally stable through the operating temper-
ature range to which the oil would be subjected in
MSRE usage. Analyses normally requested were for
carbon, sulfur, moisture, total solids, bromine number,
acid number, flash point, viscosity at 100 and 210°F,
infrared and spectrographic analyses. In operation, an
acid number of 0.06 was to be maintained as indicative
of oxidation-free performance; the interfacial tension
was not to exceed 18 dynes/cm at 77°C. The results of
these analyses are summarized in Table 10.7.

It was recognized that migration of the fission gases
from the pump tank to the region of the shaft lower
seal via the shaft annulus could polymerize oil as it
leaked down the shaft, plugging the drain line. The
pump was designed accordingly with a flow of purge gas
down the shaft annulus to minimize this migration.’ It
was concluded that the oil to be used in the MSRE
could withstand radiation doses of as high as 107 rads/g

~ without significant degradation of its properties and

that this amount of radiation would still permit the oil
to flow from the oil catch basin. Although this
conclusion, which proved to be valid, led to the
expectation of satisfactory performance of the MSRE
lubrication oil in service with components that were
exposed to highly radioactive fluxes, early experience

with the MSRE in power operations showed that oil
vapors transported to restricted areas could certainly
polymerize (see Sect. 11.1). We had no foreknowledge

131

as to whether polymerization of the recirculated oil

might occur, although we faced this prospect with
trepidation because of the formation of varnishes from
oil vapors in the off-gas valves. This fear seems to have
been unwarranted, for throughout the operation of the
MSRE the properties of the oil apparently remained
unchanged, both as judged on the basis of performance
of the components in which it was used as well as from
the results of the analyses listed in Table 10.7.

On one occasion, at the time when hydrocarbon
varnishes were plugging the off-gas stream valves, the
lubricating oil was fractionally distilled and the re-
fractive index of each 10% volume cut was measured.
The range was found to include refractive indices from
1.4726 to 1.4817, as compared with the refractive
index of the undistilled oil of 1.4738.

Surveillance analysis included infrared absorption
tests to determine whether oxidation was occurring.
Occasionally these tests indicated that C-O bands were
present, but these bands were only slightly more intense
than in the reference sample and seemed not to become
more so with continued use of the oil.

Among the least well-understood chemical phe-
nomena governing behavior in the MSRE and, as well,
among the least tractable for experimental investigation
with the MSRE were the chemical relationships in-
volving oil from the MSRE fuel pump and the transport
and distribution of fission products and tritium within
the reactor system. The properties of the oil, as
determined through the chemical monitoring program,
disclosed little that was significant concerning these
matters. Unquestionably, the thermal degradation prod-
ucts formed in the pump bowl were of some signif-
icance in the transport behavior of fission products and
tritium. Resolution of their exact effects on reactor
operations, however, will be derived from future investi-
gations rather than from further scrutiny of MSRE
behavior.

11. TRANSPORT OF MATERIALS FROM SALT TO
COVER GAS SYSTEMS

11.1 Fission Products

In solid fuel reactors, knowledge of the modes of
fission product distribution is of utmost importance to
the assessment of reactor safety and control and for the
development of reprocessing methods. Changes in state
and distribution of fission product species in solid fuel
matrices have been examined so intensely and for so

long a period of time that only problems related to

accident conditions remain as challenging to the under-
standing. For molten-salt reactors it is necessary that an
even more comprehensive understanding of fission
product behavior be achieved, for with fission products
intentionally circulated with fuel salt, their disposition,
as controlled by mechanical and chemical influences, is
of considerably greater importance than in static fuel
systems. In MSRs, some fission products are removed
from the fuel salt continuously and become distributed
to the off-gas system, to the fuel storage tanks, and to
the processing plant. They must be contained and their
decay heat removed under all conceivable circum-
stances.

The probable fates of fission products produced in
molten-salt reactors were deduced from thermodynamic
considerations, from laboratory studies, and from in-
pile static capsule tests. From the results of these
studies, one may group fission product elements in
categories according to general chemical properties:
noble gases: Kr, Xe; noble metals: Pd, Rh, Ru, Mo, Ag,
Te, Tc, Nb, Se, As; transition metals: Sn, Sb, In, Cd,
Ga, Zr, Zn; lanthanides: Y, La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Pm, Sm, Eu,
Gd, Tb, Dy, Ho, Er; active metals: Cs, Rb, Ba, Sr;
halides: Br, I.

Of the elements produced in high yields, only the
lanthanides developed concentrations in the MSRE that
were. in the range of chemical detection. This group
accounts for 53.8% of the fission products. Operation

of the MSRE resulted in the fissioning of 2.88 kg of

2357 fuel and 1.32 kg of 233U, a total of 17.92
g-atoms of uranium. From fission, therefore, 9.64
g-atoms of lanthanides, about 1.5 kg, were produced
ultimately to produce a final concentration of 300 ppm
of these elements in the fuel salt. At the very low
concentrations which prevailed in the fuel salt, the

 
 

 

lanthanides were of little consequence with respect to
general chemical surveillance, and no special effort was

- made to monitor their concentrations or distributions

directly. One method for their removal from MSR
carrier salts relies on high-temperature distillation. Tests
of this separation method with MSRE fuel carrier salt
disclosed that the measured concentrations of the

lanthanides in the salt agreed well with computed

values.! »

The MSRE provided the first opportunity to begin
studies of fission product transport in circulating salt
systems. - Although some preliminary information was
derived from the results of experiments with the

_" Aircraft Reactor Experiment, its scheduled period of

operation was so brief as to obviate any real opportu-
nity for such studies. Recognition that the knowledge
of fission product behavior was in a rudimentary
condition required that programs for their investigation
proceed independently from that for general chemical
surveillance. Detailed results of the studies of fission
product behavior are therefore excluded from the
present report and will be described separately.?

11.2 Restrictions in the Off-Gas System

In both the fuel and coolant systems, control of the
pressure in the cover-gas systems over extended periods
proved to be difficult and unpredictable. The cause was
the accumulation of solids and tarry deposits, mostly
originating from lubricating oil, in the off-gas throttling
valve used for fuel-system pressure control and in the
filter just upstream of the coolant-system pressure-
control valve. |

During the initial period of circulation of coolant salt
in the reactor, a period of 1200 hr, the off-gas filter
plugged and was replaced twice. Examination of the
filter medium showed that it was covered with amor-
phous carbon containing traces of the constituents of
the coolant salt and Hastelloy N. Although the filter
was replaced by another one with some 35 times the
surface area, pressure control again became erratic. It
was realized that oil seepage took place down the shaft
of both the fuel pump and the coolant pump. Rates of
seepage were determined and found to be variable,
ranging from indicated rates of zero to 4 cm? of oil per
day seeping into the pump bowl.

The rates did not seem to increase appreciably from
time to time, nor was their variation clearly related to
any operational practice. It became routine to replace
the filter in the coolant salt off-gas system after several
months’ use. Each time the filter was replaced, it was
found to be covered with oil residues.

132

Pressure control of the fuel system became erratic
toward the end of the first extended operation with salt
in the circuit. During this period, ®*Kr was used for
tests of the stripping efficiency of the noble gas from

the helium stream. After saturation of the salt to near
equilibrium concentrations, the inflow of 85Kr was |

stopped and the gas purged from the system. As one
part of the tests, the effect of salt level in the pump
bowl was examined with the LiF-BeF, (66-34 mole %)
salt at three levels. At this time the void fraction of the

_ salt in the fuel loop was measured for the first time and

found to be 0.6%. At. termination of these tests the
off-gas filter was removed and examined. It was found
to be free of deposits. Examination of the pressure
control valve showed that it was partially plugged. The
residue was washed out with acetone. The liquid
suspension was dark in color, and the residue left after
evaporation of the acetone consisted of spheres of a
glassy material, 1 to 5 u in diameter. Shortly after the
cleaned control valve was reinstalled, it became partially
restricted again. It was then replaced with another one
of greater flow-through capacity. Inspection of the

original valve revealed that a black deposit partially -

covered the tapered stem. The deposit was about 20%

amorphous carbon and the remainder was again 1- to

5-u spheres that were found to have the composition of
the flush salt. :
The program for bringing the MSRE to full-powe
operation was interrupted on two occasions by flow
restrictions in the off-gas system. Symptoms of plugging

became pronounced in each case after about 12 hr of |

operation at 1 MW. Restrictions were first noted in the
capillary restrictor in line 521; at the same time, check
valve HCV-533 became inoperative. Restriction was also
noted in the stainless steel line filter and 522 valve

assembly. In order to resume operation of the reactor,

the capillary restrictor and HCV-533 check valve were
replaced by nonrestrictive sections, and the filter-valve
assembly was replaced. The filter element which was
removed was capable of blocking passage of more than
90% of the particulate matter of 20.7 yu in diameter. It
was replaced by a filter designed to block particulates
of <50 pu in diameter.
Continued difficulty was experienced with restric-
tions in the off-gas system of the fuel circuit for some
time during the early stages of power operation with
the MSRE. These difficulties led to a practice which
relieved excess pressure in the fuel system by venting
gas through HCV-533 to the auxiliary charcoal bed.
During this period, evidence of restrictions in the
charcoal beds began to appear. On resuming operation
at 1 MW, restrictions appeared to develop in three

.
locations: at valve 522B, at the entries to charcoal beds
1A and 1B, and in the lines ahead of the auxiliary
charcoal bed. Small specimens of the materials which
were suspected to have caused plugging were removed
from the affected parts of the off-gas system and
subjected to laboratory tests in an attempt to determine

133

the reasons for flow restrictions. The results of these
examinations are summarized in Table 11.1.3

The results shown in Table 11.1 indicate that the
restriction in the off-gas system may be attributed to
varnish-like organic materials whose origin was the
Gulfspin-35 lubricating oil. The refractive index of the

heaviest 10% volume fraction obtained on vacuum
distillation* of the oil (see Sect. 10.4) was found to be
approximately 1.50. The high refractive index of the
varnish-like materials removed from the off-gas system
suggests that oil vapor and fractionation products
carried into the off-gas were polymerized in transit to
and on the surfaces of the valve parts, and thus plugged
the system. This inference is strengthened further by
the observation that the varnish-like materials were
found to have limited or no solubility at room
temperature in xylene, petroleum ether, carbon tetra-
chloride, or acetone.

Typical examples of the deposits removed from the
MSRE and examined in the laboratory are shown in
Figs. 11.1-11.4. In one attempt to identify the
materials that were causing the restrictions, the reactor
was drained, and for several days after, all helium flow
through the fuel loop was stopped® and the contained
helium was recirculated at 100°F. Three samples of the

‘recirculated gas were isolated for analysis, but the

results were inconclusive.
The appearance of restrictions in the off-gas system of
the fuel circuit comprised a major operational impedi-

ment. Considerable effort was expended to identify the
‘causes of these restrictions and to alleviate the con-

comitant problems. In April 1966 a particle trap was
installed in the fuel system off-gas line, just downstream
from the first holdup section. It was replaced in August
1966 with an identical unit. In January 1967 an
improved unit was used to replace the original one and

remained in service throughout the remainder of opera-
tions with the MSRE. Each of the particle traps
employed stainless steel mesh as the roughing section;
in addition, finer media, both fibrous metal (Feltmetal)
and Fiberfrax, served to block passage of the smallest
particles. It served to alleviate the major part of the
difficulties that had beset previous operations, but
because it was not capable of completely blocking the
passage of volatile hydrocarbons, it was ineffective for
providing complete freedom from the development of
restrictions in the charcoal beds. The system was
operable throughout the remainder of MSRE tests,
although with chronic indications that oil fractionation
products were being transferred downstream to the
charcoal beds. :

A particle trap that had been installed in the fuel
system off-gas line in April 1966 was examined, and
samples were removed from the trap for analysis. The
results of the examination of this trap were described in
detail by Scott and Smith. The chemical results are

summarized below.

Mass spectrometric analysis of material leached from
Yorkmesh matting at the inlet section of the filter
indicated that it had collected a number of fission
products. The eluted material contained 20 wt % Ba, 15
wt % Sr, and 0.2 wt % Y. In the same analysis the salt
constituents Be and Zr were estimated to be 0.01 and
0.05 wt % respectively. Other samples removed from
the metal filter. contained small quantities of Cr, Fe,
and Ni. Results of gamma-ray spectrometric analysis
indicated the presence of !'37Cs, ®°Sr, '°3Ru or
106 Ry, 119MmAg 95Nb, and !#°La. All samples were
analyzed for determination of the presence of Be, and
the concentration present was below the detectable
limit of 0.1%. Attempts to determine the presence of Zr

were complicated by the presence of large quantities of

Sr. The fraction of soluble hydrocarbons was deter-
mined for the materials present on the Yorkmesh mat
and in other samples was found to range from 60 to
80%. Carbon disulfide extracts were made of the
organics and were allowed to evaporate; the residues
were used for infrared analysis. All samples were
identical and indicated the presence of long-chain
hydrocarbons. There was no evidence of any functional
groups other than those involving carbon and hydrogen,
nor was there any evidence suggesting double or triple
bonds. There was an indication of a possible mild
cross-linkage. It is likely that there is more cross-linkage
of the organic in the gas stream than appeared in these
samples, and the low indication could be due to the
insolubility of the cross-linked organic and the high
operating temperatures of the wire mesh, which would

cause breakdown of the organic into elemental carbon
and volatiles. Co

The following conclusions can be drawn from the
results of the examination:

1. Since the spectrographic analysis indicated that the
concentrations of Be and Zr were very small
compared with those of the fission products Ba and
Sr, the amount of entrained salt mist carried to the
filter was negligible.

2. The high activity and the large amount of barium
and strontium in the inlet section of the particle trap
indicate that a large fraction of the solid daughters

of Kr and Xe which decay in the line is carried down -

the line with the off-gas stream.

3. The distribution of activity indicates that entrance
areas of the Yorkmesh mat were unexpectedly
effective in trapping the solid fission products.
Decay heat in this area resulted in temperatures
above 1200°F.

4. The collection of hydrocarbon mist on the York-
mesh mat had probably enhanced the collecting
efficiency of the mesh for solid particles.

With the adoption of methods to minimize the effect
of hydrocarbon transport in the off-gas streams, little
further operational difficulty was encountered with the
MSRE, and no additional chemical studies were made.

The chemical effects of continually passing hydro-

carbon degradation products through the fuel stream
are largely unknown. They were viewed as intractable
to quantitative assessment with the means at hand for
dynamic analysis. In attempts to gain some under-

standing of the possible relation of the hydrocarbons to

various chemical and physical aspects of fuel salt and
fission product behavior, a gas sampling facility? was
_ developed and installed at the MSRE. In use, it
provided few data that were of value in appraising the
effect of oil seepage and was adapted to other uses.
Thermal degradation of the pump oil certainly pro-
duced a small finite concentration of hydrogen in the
pump bowl atmosphere. There is no evidence in the
chemical results obtained from salt analyses that indi-
cates a recognizable effect of .its presence. Possible
consequences of its effects on fission product chemistry
and transport were ;recognized some time ago. Their
assessment may be found in the summary report on
fission product behavior.®

11.3 Tritium Transport in the MSRE

Shortly before scheduled termination of operations
with the MSRE, it was realized that the hot metal

‘containment system should be highly permeable to

hydrogen and that, therefore, the tritium produced in
the fuel salt could be expected to diffuse out of the fuel

system. An investigation was initiated to measure the
. amounts of tritium in the air vented to the discharge

stack, that released through the radiator tubes, and the
amount of tritium in fuel salt samples. Equipment was
installed by the analytical chemists in the MSRE
vent-house sample station in order to measure the
concentrations in the various reactor effluent gas
streams. A fraction of the gas stream was passed over a
bed of hot copper oxide in order to convert the tritium
to water. Tests were conducted with the copper oxide
beds either at 340 or 800°C. The higher temperature
allows the oxidation of methane, while the lower
temperature does not. The results of these tests,
conducted by Dale, Apple, and Meyer,” showed that
the maximum amounts of tritium released from the air
stack, from the radiator, and found in fuel salt,

. corresponded to the production of 4.6, 0.6, and 22.7,
_ Cif/day respectively. At full power operation the MSRE
“produces 60 Ci of tritium per day.

In an evaluation of the results, Briggs'® concluded

* that the disparity in the material balance suggested that

the following behavior may have occurred:

1. Either the metal walls have a much greater resistance
to the diffusion of tritium than has been estimated,
or most of the tritium is present in a form other
than T, or HT. Even assuming that graphite is a sink
for. T,, one cannot otherwise explain the small
fraction that passes through the radiator tubes and
the piping and vessel walls in the primary system.

2. When TF is taken into consideration but reactions
with the graphite are neglected, the fraction of the
tritium that leaves the fuel pump off-gas system
increases and the amount that passes through the
metal walls decreases. Assuming equilibration of
liquid and gas in the pump bowl and UF,;/UF; =
1000, the. distribution begins to look like that
measured for the MSRE. One would have to further
assume that much of the tritium is retained on the
carbon beds as TF or organic compounds and that

 T, and TF react with materials in the off-gas system
to produce the organic compounds found in the exit
of the carbon beds. These calculations contain
several uncertainties and ‘simplifications that can
considerably affect the results; the results are in-
sensitive to the solubility of TF but are quite
sensitive to the solubility of T, in the salt and to the
value of the equilibrium constant, k. The presence of
hydrogen and organic compounds from decompo-
sition of oil in the pump bowl could be important

«

but is neglected. Agreement between calculations
and measurements may be entirely accidental.

3. When retention or reaction with the graphite in the
core is considered along with the presence of TF, the
graphite becomes a major sink for tritium, mostly as
TF. If UF,4/UF; increases from 100 to 1000, almost
all the tritium enters the graphite as TF. Very little
diffuses through the metal walls or through the fuel
pump off-gas system. A distribution about like that
observed for the MSRE would be calculated if one
assumed partial reaction of TF with graphite to
produce hydrocarbons that are released from the
graphite and removed through the fuel pump off-gas
line. Such reactions -are believed to be highly
unlikely.

Briggs’ assessment thus shows that the transport
mechanisms for tritium in the MSRE were not clarified
from the data obtained and that inevitably their
characteristics must be established because of their
significance to design of and procedures for operational
control of MSBRs. Termination of operations with the
MSRE precluded further assessment of transport mech-
anisms under realistic conditions. This was not neces-
sarily unfavorable, for the leakage of oil from the fuel

‘pump shaft seal into the pump bowl was unques-

tionably a complicating factor in attempts to interpret
the results of on-site analysis. The fuel pump was
known to have permitted small amounts, generally
believed to have been ~1 g/day, of lubricating oil to
enter the fuel pump bowl and thus become rapidly, and
perhaps heterogeneously, thermally degraded. It seems
very probable that radiation also must have had some
role in the degradation process. Generation of a
spectrum of hydrogenous degradation products in the
off-gas must complicate theoretical models of transport

mechanisms to a great extent and probably even

accounts for the wide range of analytical values
obtained at the MSRE. An initial model of tritium
behavior was advanced recently by Strehlow.!! As
fundamental to the development of a model of tritium
transport, Strehlow noted that “transport processes and
chemical behavior of hydrogen isotopes are interrelated
parameters in molten-salt reactor design considerations.
The transport of hydrogen is determined by the
solubility and diffusivity in moderator, salt, and metal.
The chemical behavior is a function of the oxidation-
reduction potential in the salt, radiation field, and
possibly reactivity with the graphite moderator.”
Additional tests were conducted at the MSRE near
the end of operations in which CuO specimens and Ni
rods were exposed to the gas and salt before and after

the addition of beryllium to the salt. The results of
these tests have not yet been completed. After termi-
nation of the MSRE, one of the graphite stringers was
removed for examinations and tests. These tests, con-
ducted by S.S.Kirslis and F.F. Blankenship, were
completed in July 1971. The results indicated that
about 15% of the tritium produced in the MSRE was
sorbed on the moderator graphite. The concentration of
tritium in thin surface samples was as high as 10'! dis
min~! g7!, fell to about 10° dis min~! g~} at 60 mils
depth, and then decreased slowly to about 6 X 10® dis
min! g™! for penetrations to 800 mils. These results
are of particular interest in that they suggest a means
for controlling the distribution of tritium in molten-salt
reactors.

12. IMPLICATIONS OF THE MSRE CHEMISTRY
FOR FUTURE MOLTEN SALT REACTORS

The Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment was spectac-
ularly successful as a materials demonstration: the
 

 

 

140

molten fluoride fuel and coolant-salt mixtures flowed
through their containment circuitry for thousands of
hours, causing little or no corrosion in these systems;
the graphite moderator experienced no measurable
dimensional changes in use and remained free of
penetration ‘by the fuel salt. The reactor equipment
operated reliably, and the radioactive liquids and gases
were contained safely. The fuel was completely stable.
Xenon was removed rapidly. from the salt. When
necessary, radioactive equipment was repaired and
replaced in reasonable time and without overexposing
maintenance personnel.

That the MSRE was completed so successfully did not

come about as the result of frequent adjustments in the

chemical properties of the circulating fluids. A major
conclusion that emerges from experience with the
MSRE is that chemical surveillance, as carried out with
individual samples obtained and removed from the
reactor and transferred via necessarily cumbersome
processes to off-site laboratories, is of value principally
as a basis for attempting to control trends in behavior.
Irrespective of the quality of the analytical data
obtained, the information feedback process is generally
too slow to afford frequent control direction. Chemical
surveillance for future MSRs coupled to steam plants,
therefore, must be obtained through on-line monitoring
systems, and such surveillance systems must function
dynamically. In addition, for safety, incorporation of
the associated on-line instrumentation that is required
must not add significantly to the complexity of. the
reactor system.

The next molten-salt reactor which is likely to be
built will be constructed either exclusively as a federal
enterprise, for example, the MSBE, involving both a

* steam generation system and on-line chemical reprocess-

ing for the removal of rare-earth fission products, or a
larger reactor developed partly under the impetus of
private industry. Such a reactor would generate steam
but would not include a chemical reprocessing plant for
the removal of rare-earth fission products. Either of
these reactors would utilize a fuel salt containing the
same constituents as have been proposed for the MSBR
fuel, for which the standard reference design composi-
tion is "LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (72-16-11.7-0.3 mole %).
Heat removal would be accomplished through a second-
ary salt system. Final choice of the coolant for this

‘system has not yet been made for the reasons described

below.

It is essential that the tritium produced from fuels
based on ’LiF-BeF, be managed so that essentially
none of the tritium produced in the reactor core can
find its way into the steam plant. Complete removal of

tritium from the fuel salt before it passes into the heat
exchanger is highly improbable, and accordingly, man-
agement of the tritium transferred through the heat-
exchanger walls is required.

Fluoroborate mixtures were proposed as suitable for
molten-salt ‘reactor coolants’ and have been under
examination for some time for that application. Consid-

. eration was given to the possibility that-the NaF-NaBF,

eutectic mixture would be substituted for the LiF-BeF,
coolant salt in the MSRE before operations with the
reactor were terminated. However, the plan was not
implemented for lack of financial support.

A barrier to the selection of fluoroborates as suitable
coolants for molten-salt reactors has been their seeming.
inability to retain hydrogenous species in melts con-
tained in nickel-based alloys. Unless a finite but small,
~50 ppm, concentration of hydrogenous species can be
retained’ in these melts as a reservoir for TF, their
applicability seems tenuous. As an alternative, a reactor
design which employs Hitec [NaNO;-NaNO,-KNO;
(6.9-48.5-44.6 mole %)] as the coolant salt, isolated
from possible contact with fuel salt by an LiF-BeF,
buffer salt, has been proposed. It is necessary to
eliminate the possibility that Hitec might come into
contact. with the graphite moderator. Evaluations of
this alternative have begun but will require a con-
siderable research and development effort before the
potential applicability of Hitec can be judged.

It is thus evident that the next molten-salt reactor to
be built, of whatever type, will employ both fuel and
coolant salts unlike those which were used in the
MSRE. Even so, the chemistry of molten salts, as
advanced by experience with the MSRE, is sufficiently
similar to be of practical value.

Until specific choice of a coolant is made, it seems
unnecessary to project from MSRE experience the
character of surveillance programs for the coolant
system. It is most likely that the earliest indications of
coolant-fuel mixing would be given by the nuclear
surveillance instrumentation and that, therefore, chemi-
cal surveillance of the separate systems would be of
little operational consequence. The details of coolant-
system surveillance must therefore be relegated to
future planning efforts.

At this point,.no timetable exists for construction of
follow-on reactors to the MSRE. Accordingly, as our
understanding of the chemical behavior of materials in
the MSRE is extended, it can serve to develop detailed
surveillance programs as needed. Fuel surveillance, at a
minimum, must include consideration of the following
chemical factors:

1. Oxide contaminants in the fuel salt. A fuel salt
which does not contain a highly polar cation compo-
nent which interacts chemically with the oxide ion, as
did Zr* in the Z1F, contained in the MSRE fuel salt,
will almost certainly not tolerate relatively large con-
centrations of dissolved oxide ion without precipita-
tion. In the MSRE, the oxide tolerance of the fuel salt
was estimated to be ~680 ppm at the operating
temperature of the fuel salt, 650°C (1200°F), whereas
in the MSBR reference fuel salt the tolerance is
probably not greater than ~40 ppm at this temperature.
It has been tacitly assumed that all versions of
molten-salt reactors operated in the future would
include processing equipment for maintaining the con-
centration of oxide in the fuel salt at quite low levels
through continuous processing of a bleed stream of salt.

A detailed evaluation of the consequences of contami-
nation of fuel salt by oxides has been made, from which
it was concluded that “there is no necessity for an
oxygen getter, such as ZrF,, in the MSBR fuel,” but
that “swift, satisfactory, and preferably on-line,
methods for determination of 0?” and UF; concentra-
tions of the MSBR fuel after storage and during startup
and operation”? must be available.

Preliminary conceptual designs of on-line oxide detec-
tion apparatus have been devised by members of the
Analytical Chemistry Division.> Increasing efforts will
undoubtedly be devoted to this activity in the future.

2. Corrosion detection. The extent of generalized
corrosion in the MSRE was estimated routinely from
changes in the concentration of chromium found in the
salt samples removed from the reactor. Results of
examinations of surveillance specimens removed occa-
sionally from the reactor core and from postoperational
examinations of the alloy removed from the heat
exchanger confirmed the general validity of these
estimates. The use of Cr?" concentration as a corrosion
indicator thus continues to be uniquely attractive. To
verify corrosion-free operation of a large reactor from
analyses of numerous samples removed from the reactor
would probably be limited by the slow feedback as
mentioned above. An alternate means would be far
more desirable. One generalization which emerges from
MSRE experience is that during periods when the
relative concentration of [U*]/[ZU] in the fuel salt
was 0.5%, the system appeared to be protected against
corrosion. This observation, along with a consideration
of the expense, inconvenience, and irrelevance of
individual results of chemical analyses, suggests that a
more suitable means for establishing that corrosion-free
conditions prevail would be to ensure that at all times
the proper redox potential existed in the salt stream.

141

As part of the MSRE experiment, evidence appeared
to indicate the possibility that the disposition of
niobium in the fuel salt could be exploited as a means
of monitoring corrosion in molten-salt reactors on a
continuous basis. The lack of success we have experi-
enced in attempting to determine the concentration of
trivalent uranium in the fuel salt when the total
concentration of uranium was <0.5 mole % suggests
that there is a clear incentive to develop methods of
detecting corrosion such as by niobium monitoring by
gamma spectrometry, which can provide on-line con-
tinuous monitoring of the chemical potential of the fuel
salt.

As noted in Chap. 6, several aspects of corrosion
chemistry in molten-salt reactor systems were left
unresolved at termination of MSRE operations. The
outstanding example of these was that corrosion attack
during 233U operations might have been anticipated to
be some threefold greater than was observed. Further,
examinations of metal surveillance specimens removed
from the heat exchanger indicated that mass transfer of
metal from hot to cold zones was so little as to be
undetectable. Temperature differences in the salt cir-
cuits were modest, ~50°F, whereas in future molten-
salt reactors projected differences run to about 200°F.
The absence of base-line data for mass transfer that
results from these examinations obviated the possibility
of projecting mass-transfer coefficients for larger reac-
tors. Generalized corrosion was deduced from chemical
measurements of the chromium concentration in fuel-
salt samples.

Current developments in the attempts to improve the
radiation-induced loss of ductility that Hastelloy N
experiences after use in high radiation fluxes include
the possible inclusion of small amounts of titanium,
hafnium, or zirconium in the alloy.* All of these metals
are more chemically active than chromium, the most
chemically active constituent of the unmodified alloy;
their inclusion as constituents in significant concentra-
tions may affect the chemical methods for monitoring

- corrosion on a dynamic basis.

3. Oils and hydrocarbons in the fuel system. The
extent of oil leakage into the fuel system must be
known accurately and ascertained on a regular basis
because of the operational implications of such leakage
and because of the chemical effects induced by the
presence of hydrocarbon degradation products in the
system. Hydrogen, evolved in the thermal degradation
of hydrocarbons, will unquestionably be involved in the
distribution of tritium in the reactor and will control
fission product chemistry, perhaps even favorably if, for
example, it enhances the retention of iodine in the
 

 

 

system as iodide or tellurium as the element. Surveil-
lance of ‘the off-gas by means of a gas spectrometer
seems to be very desirable; it may possibly be an
important requisite for continuous operation. If the gas
analysis by mass spectrometry proves to be adaptable
for determination of a variety of species, it could
provide the most precise source of control data for the
reactor. . Co

4. Miscellaneous. One of the most useful kinds of

analysis in the MSRE was that provided by mass

spectrometric measurements of the isotopic composi-
tion of uranium and plutonium. Occasional removal of
salt samples from reactors built in the future, princi-
pally for mass spectrometric determination of inven-
tory, burnup, etc., could also be used for confirmation
by general analyses that the on-line instrumentation was
functioning correctly.

Little advantage would accrue from any routine
efforts to determine chemically whether there were any
chronic leaks from fuel to coolant or in the reverse
direction, for, in either event, nuclear data would
provide operational control. Similarly, laboratory deter-
mination of the condition of auxiliary fluids, such as
cooling tower water, oil from pump reservoirs, etc.,
should probably not be done at all. Experience with the
MSRE has shown that there will be little difficulty in
maintaining these fluids in condition so they will meet
physical and chemical criteria over long periods of time.
Information pertaining to their condition can be ac-
quired simply and quickly and should be obtained at
suitable predetermined intervals by in-line automated
monitoring equipment.

In summary, it becomes evident that operational
adjustments for future molten-salt reactors should

142

originate from chemical controls provided almost ex-
clusively from on-line instrumentation. It is imperative
that such instrumentation be stringently restricted to
the minimum for safety, because there should be little
reason to use the information derived for frequent
adjustments of the salt systems. These reduce to (1) a
continuous method for determining the identity of
species in and composition of the gas above the fuel
salt; in all likelihood this will entail the development of
an automated mass spectrometer; (2) a method of
establishing the redox potential of the fuel salt to
ensure corrosion-free operation; for this function, fur-
ther development of a niobium monitor by on-line
gamma spectrometry will be required; (3) verification
that bismuth does not enter the fuel stream via the
incoming stream from the chemical reprocessing plant;
(4) development of a highly sensitive and accurate
method for continuous or frequent on-line determina-
tion of oxide concentration in the fuel salt.
