ABSTRACT

A vertical centrifugal sump-type pump utilizing commercially
available impeller and volute designs was selected to circulate the
fuel salt in the Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). Tests were
conducted in water to determine the adequacy of the pump design, to
assist design of the prototype fuel pump, and to investigate the
effectiveness of xenon removal with high velocity liquid jets con-
tacting sweep gas in the pump tank. Hydraulic head characteristics
were within +1 to -3 ft of manufacturers data for a given constant
speed. Adequate and necessary provisions were devised to control
the liquid and gas bubble behavior in the pump tank. The results of
priming and coastdown tests are reported. During the gas removal
tests, the fuel, xenon, and helium in the MSRE were simulated with
distilled water, carbon dioxide, and air, respectively. The best
configuration removed carbon dioxide from water at approximately 99%
of the ideal removal rate when the stripping flow was 65 gpm and the

sweep gas flow rate was Ub scfm.

WATER TEST DEVELOPMENT OF THE FUEL PUMP FOR THE MSRE

P. G. Smith
INTRODUCTION

The Molten Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE) is to be a low-pressure,
high-temperature, graphite moderated circulating fuel nuclear reactor
using fissile and fertile materials dissolved in molten fluoride salts
and is designed for a heat generation rate of 10 Mw (1, 2, and 3). Its
goals include proving the safe and reliable operation of this nuclear
reactor concept and demonstrating the maintainability of molten salt
machinery. The investigation reported herein is concerned with the pump
required to circulate the fuel salt in the MSRE.

A centrifugal sump-type pump consisting of a rotary element and
pump tank was selected for this application. The rotary element in-
cludes the vertical shaft and underhung impeller, the shaft bearings,
and the means for lubricating and cooling the bearings. The pump tank
includes the volute (casing), suction and discharge nozzles, other
nozzles for accommodating inert gas purge, fuel sampling and enrichment,
liquid level sensing devices, a flange for mounting the rotary element,
and various liquid bypass flows for degassing and removing xenon poison
from the circulating fuel salt. The device used for removal of xenon
will be referred to as a "stripper". Much of the design of the fuel
pump was derived from the past experience with similar pumps for
elevated temperature service which were developed during the Aircraft
Nuclear Propulsion Program at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (L4, 5,
end 6). .
The initial phase of development and testing of the fuel pump was
conducted with water to ascertain the capability of the pump to meet the
hydraulic requirements of the fuel circuit and to remove from the circu-
lating fuel the xenon which will be generated by the fissioning process.
Data were taken on the head-flow-power-speed performance of the pump for
two impeller outside diameters, 13 and 11 inches. Various baffles were

devised to control splash, spray, and gas bubbles caused by the operation

 
 

 

 

of the bypass flows in the pump tank. The ability of the pump. to prime
was determined at various liquid levels of interest. The coastdown
characteristics of the pump were measured from various speeds and flows.
Attempts were made to measure indirectly the effectiveness with which
xenon poison might be removed from the circulating fuel using high
velocity liquid jets in contact with gas in the pump tank. During this
particular test the fuel and xenon were simulated, respectively, with
distilled water and carbon dioxide; this gas is much more soluble in
water than xenon is in molten salts of interest and in addition provides
for convenient measurement of solubility.

Pertinent. information from these water tests were incorporated. in
the design of the prototype fuel pump and will be subjected to elevated
temperature testing at MSRE design conditions.

EXPERIMENTAL APPARATUS

The experimental apparatus includes the pump, the test loop, and
the stripper configurations. A description of each follows:

Pump

The pump is shown in Fig. 1 and includes a centrifugal impeller and
volute with the impeller supported at the lower end of a vertical shaft,
.grease-lubricated bearings for supporting the shaft, bearing housing,
pump tank bowl, and volute support. The pump tank bowl was fabricated
of plexiglas to permit visual obgervation of the behavior of the liquid
and the gas bubbles. Labyrinth-type seals were utilized on the impeller
inlet shroud and on the impeller support shroud. The impeller support
shroud labyrinth seal was supported. on the impeller cover plate, which
was sealed to the volute by an elastomeric O-ring. The volute discharge
was connected to the pump tank discharge nozzle through a flexibly
. mounted bridge tube. The connection arrangement is shown in Fig. 2.

Test Poop

The test loop is shown in Fig. 3, which consists of the pump, piping,

venturi flowmeter, throttle valve (globe type), stripper flow circuits

(not shown), and a cooler. The pump was driven with a 60 hp d.c.
variable speed motor. The vertical inlet pipe to the pump was febri-
cated of plexiglas +o permit visual observation of the inlet flow. con-
ditions. A bundle of l-in. diameter thin-wall tubes, 6-in. long, .was
added to the lower end of this pipe to reduce rotation of the water
column. The cooler was installed in parallel with the main loop throttle
valve. A part of the main loop flow .was bypassed through the cooler to
control. the system temperature. The bypass flow was controlled. by a
.throttle velve loceted in the bypass flow circuit. Stripper configu-
‘ration flow wes supplied through e-tap located just downstream of the
pump tank ‘diecherge nozzle. The stripper flow as well as the flow from
the impeller upper lebyrinth passed. through the pump tank and re-entered
the system at .the impeller Anlet. Throttle valves were used to control

. the stripper flow. Following the initial tests an orifice was added to
the nearly vertical section of the loop between the discharge and the
venturi flow meter to decrease the pressure drop through the main throttle

valve.

Carbon Dioxide Stripping Devices

Tests were conducted wherein a portion of the pump discharge flow
was introduced into the gas volume of the pump tank through high velocity
Jets (strippers). A number of configurations were investigated, starting
with a single stream and progressing to configurations which gave in-
creasingly more fresh liquid-gas interface.

The strippers tested and identified in Table I (Appendix) are
described as follows (in each test two strippers were used):

1. Configuration 1 is shown in Fig. 4. The flow discharged from
one side of the can through 1/4-1n. holes. For this test the holes were
submerged below the liquid surface in the pump tank.

2. Configuration 2 is shown in Fig. 5. The lower end of the entry
tube was closed. and the beaker was packed with Inconel wool. The strip-
ping flow entered the pump ‘tank gas space in tangential direction as a
spray. One beaker contained 84 spray holes, 1/8-in..in diameter, and
the other contained 30 spray holes, 1/4-1in. in dlameter.

5. Configuration 5 was a toroid constructed of pipe as shown in
Fig. 6, and located in the pump tank as shown in Fig. 1. Each stripper
contained two rows .of 80 holes each, 1/16-in. in diameter,

INSTRUMENTATION

Instrumentation was provided to measure venturi pressure drop,
discharge pressure, pump shaft speed, water temperature, motor input
power, fountain flow, stripper flow, pH value of the water, and pump
tank liquid level. ;

Three different methods were used in measuring the venturi pressure
drop: mercury manometer, difference between individual pressures measured
at the inlet and throat, and by differential pressure transmitter. Cali-
bration of the venturi was provided by the vendor, and it is shown in
Fig. 7. Individual pressures at the inlet and throat were indicated on
Bourdon tube gages, 0-30 psi range, 1/8 psi subdivision, and 1/4% ac-
curacy. The differential pressure transmitter vas read out on a dif-
ferential gage, 0-50 psi range, 1/2 psi subdivision, 1/4% accuracy. The
flow is estimated to be accurate within + 3%.

The discharge pressure was measured on a Bourdon tube gage, 0-100 psi

range, 1/2 psi subdivision, and 1/4% accuracy.

The pump shaft speed was measured. by use of a 60-tooth gear mounted
on the shaft, a magnetic pickup, and a counter which indicated directly

.in rpm.

The water temperature was méasured with a dial-type thermometer,
0 to 240 F range, 2 F subdivision.

Motor input power data was obtained by two methods: power recorder,
0 to 40 kw range, 0.8 kw subdivision and power analyzer which indicated

of the testing with the 13-in-o.d. impeller which preceded tests with
the 11-in. impeller. During this period, investigations were conducted
to: locate and correct the source of error. Satisfactory power measure-
‘ments were obtained with the 1ll-in. impeller. The motor calibration
curve 1s shown in Fig. 8.

‘The fountein flow vas measured by directing the flow through 90°
V-notch weirs and measuring the height of the flow column.

The stripper flow. wes measured by use of rotemeters.

The pH value of the water was indicated with a Beckman pH meter,
Model H-2, renge O to 14 pH with an accuracy of 0.03 pH.

The pump tank liquid level was indicated with a scale marked off in
O.d~in. divisions. Zero level corresponded with the center line of the

volute.
DESCRIPTION OF TESTS

Head-Flow-Power-Speed Performance

Hydraulic ‘performance data were obtained over a wide range of
operating conditions with impellers of 11- and 13-in.. outside diameter.
Two methods of operation were used: speed was varied (700 to 1300 rpm)
at constant system resistance for several values of resistance with the

13-in. impeller, and system resistance was varied at constant speed for

several values of speed (700 to 1300 rpm) with the ll-in. impeller. Data.
were obtained for computing head, flow, brake horsepower, and efficiency.

Carbon Dioxide Stripping Tests

- A number of tests were performed with both impeller diameters to
ascertain the change in effectiveness of Co, removal caused by various
stripper configurations, flow rates, Jet velocities, and sweep gas flow
rates, Carbon dioxide in dry-ice form was added to the circulating dis-
tilled water in the system until saturation .was achieved, after which
time the stripper flow was started. Readings of pH of the water were
taken versus time to determine the time required to reduce the co, con-
‘centration by a factor of two. A total of 37 tests were performed.

An expression was derived to give the theoretical time required to
.reduce the CO, concentration by one half. Comparison of the theoretical
and experimental data is reported as relative effectiveness of the

stripper.

Pump Tank Liquid and Gas Behavior

Fountain Flow

Considereble testing was performed to.observe the flow of weter from
the impeller upper lebyrinth (flow up the shaft and return to the system
‘through the pump. tenk volume) and to develope adequate control of the re-
turn of this flow into the pump tank liquid, keeping the splatter of water
“and gas bubble formation to & minimm (see Fig. 1).

| Clearances were varied between the shaft and the impeller upper
labyrinth and the impeller upper shroud and seal plate. The corres-
ponding fountain flows were measured.

Stripper Flow

The flow through the various stripper configurations was measured
and baffling was developed to control splatter and gas bubble formation.
L

Ges Bubble Behavior in the Pump Tank Volume

Throughout all of the testing the formation and behavior of gas
bubbles were observed in the pump tank volume. Baffling was ‘devised to
prevent entry of gas bubbles into the pump inlet from the pump. tank

volume.
Priming

The priming characteristics of the pump were checked at various
static liquid levels -in the pump tank. The ability of the pump. to hold
prime as the liquid level in the pump tank was being lowered was in-
vestigated. Data were obtained of head-flow-speed performence and of

change in starting level for various starting levels as the pump was

accelerated from zero to design speed.
Coastdown Characteristics

A number of coastdown tests were made from various pump operating
conditions. The power supply to the pump drive motor was interrupted
vhile the pump was operating at specific speed and flow conditions, and
the time required to reach reduced system flow end pump speed was de-

‘termined.
TEST RESULTS
Head-Flow-Power-Speed Performance

Hydraulic performance data were obtained over a wide range of head
and flow conditions at several speeds for the 8 in. x 6 in. volute, using
impellers of 13- and ll-in. outside diameter. These tests with the 13-in.
diameter impeller were conducted without a baffle in the pump inlet. The
13-in. impeller performance is presented in Fig. 9, which is a plot of
head versus flow at various speeds . The flow is total flow consisting
of system flow, fountain flow, and stripper flow. The corresponding
data are tabulated in Table II (Appendix). Allis-Chalmers data are also
shown for comparison. The heads obtained are increasingly lower than
Allis-Chalmers data with decreasing flow at constant speed.

The performance obtained with the 1l-in. diameter impeller is pre-
sented in Fig. 10, which is a plot of head versus flow at various speeds.
The flow is total flow consisting of system flow, fountain flow; and
stripper flow. The corresponding data are tabulated in Table III (Ap-
pendix). Data for three different inlet configurations are shown: in
two configurations a prerotation baffle was located at the inlet to the
impeller; and the other configuration had none. The baffle consisted of
two plates arranged in .a cross as shown in Fig. 11; it had the effect of
increasing the head at the lower range of flows on a constant speed line.

There was essentially no difference in the results obtained with the two

slzes of baffles. Curves of head and pump input power versus flow at
various speeds are shown in Fig. 12. The input power change versus
flow for constant speed operation is slight.

The prerotation baffle was not fully tested with the 13-in. im-
peller. Were such a baffle used with the 13-in. impeller, performance
would be more nearly coincident with the published Allis-Chalmers data.

From the power data obtained with the 1l-in. diameter impeller,
efficiency contours were computed which are shown in Fig. 13, super-

imposed on a plot of head-flow-speed data.

Carbon Dioxide Stripping Effectiveness

In the stripping tests, data were obtained to determine the time
required to reduce the CO, concentration by one half (half-life). The
change in pH value of the distilled water was measured over a range from
4 to 6 versus time. For plotting purposes the pH values were converted
to the logarithm of the molarity of Co, to determine the half-life.

Theoretical half-life (t = 0.69 v/a.) was computed for each test
and compared with the experimental helf-life to give relative effective-
ness.

The results of the carbon dioxide stripping tests are presented in
Table I (Appendix) . Related in the table are data pertaining to the
stripper configurations, by-pass flows, liquid level in the pump tank,
sweep gas flow rate, system volume, jet velocity, experimental half-life,
ideal half-life, and relative effectiveness.

The first six tests were preliminary; the flow was simply bypassed
through the pump tank without passing through strippers. These tests
were performed to provide a base from which to proceed with strippers.
Values of relative effectiveness ranged from 10 to ho percent .

Tests 7 through 16 were concerned mainly with varying the stripper
configuration. Other variables may be noted in the data shown in the
table. Values of effectiveness ranged from 15 to 68 percent.

From the results of tests through No. 16, configuration 5 (Fig. 6)
was derived and used for the remainder of the tests, 17 through 39.

In tests 17. through 2k, the flow and Jet velocity were varied simul-
‘taneously at a constant sweep gas flow rate. The relative effectiveness
varied from 27 to 99 percent.

In tests 10, 13,.14,.17, 18, and 25 through 29, sweep ges flow rate
was varied with the other varisbles held constant, and two stripper con-
figurations were used. The relative effectiveness varied from 47 to
72 percent. These data are plotted in Fig. 14, Relative Effectiveness
Versus Sweep Gas Flow, for two configurations.

In tests 30, 32,.33, 35, and 39, the stripping flow. was varied with
the other variebles held constant. The relative effectiveness varied
from 70 to 90 percent. The’ results from these tests are shown in Fig. 15,
Half-Life (defined on page 18) Versus Stripping Flow. Experimental and
‘theoretical curves are shown.

In tests 30, 31, 34, and 36, the jet velocity was varied with the
other variables held constant. The relative effectiveness varied from
27 to 90 percent. The results are shown in Fig. 16, Relative Effective-
ness Versus Jet Velocity.

Configuration -5 was selected for the MSRE fuel pump, and was .in-
corporated in the design of the prototype fuel pump. Tests 37 and 38
yielded effectiveness values of 52 and 55 percent, respectively. These
tests were performed at the following conditions, reasonably attainable
in the MSRE: stripping flow rate of 65 gpm, and sweep gas flow rates of
0.05 and. 0.07 scfm, respectively.

Pump Tank Liquid and Gas Behavior

Fountain Flow

{

Observations of the fountain flow from the impeller upper labyrinth
(Fig. 17) revealed the need to control it; the slinger impeller was
causing en undesirable spray. This spray was contained and controlled

-by use of a cover enclosing the lsbyrinth and slinger impeller, and
‘having drain ports located at its lower end.
Approximate measurements of the fountain flow were made using weirs

located in the windows carrying the flow from the fountain into the pump

Configuration U4 was used with the 1ll-in. diameter impeller and the
fountain flow was measured at various speeds along a constant resistance
line defined by 1300 gpm and 45 ft. The fountain flow versus speed is
shown in Fig. 18. Configuration 4 was adopted for use on the prototype
MSRE fuel pump.

The direction of the fountain flow was observed over the range of
conditions from which head-flow-speed data were obtained with both the
11-in. and 13-<in. impellers. The flow of liquid was found always to be
outward from the shaft annulus into the pump tank, which is the desired

direction.

Stripper Flow

Considerable splatter of liquid resulted from impingement of this
flow onto the volute and volute support. Control of this splatter was
obtained through use of baffles installed on the stripper and on the

volute support .

Gas Bubble Behavior in the Pump Tank Volume

Entrance of the fountain and stripper flows into the pump tank liquid
caused gas bubble formation in the liquid. Control was obtained. through
use of a baffle installed on the volute which deflects bubbles radially

 

*% -
Each configuration was basically the same. Only the clearances

were different.

* impeller inlet at the lowest elevation in the tank as shown in Fig. 19,

which may be compared to Fig. l.

Priming

Priming tests were conducted with the 13-in. impeller in which the
pump was accelerated from zero to 1030 rpm in approximately 30 seconds,
noting the change in pump tank liquid level and observing attainment of
normel pump head and flow performance. The following operating levels
were noted for the listed starting levels:

Normal hydraulic performance was achieved at the end of pump accele-
ration for all runs except the 0.5-in. starting level with the 13-in.
impeller and the zero level with the 1l-in..impeller. The 13-in.. impeller
required an additional minute for priming at the O0.5-in. level and the
11-in. impeller would not prime at the zero level. These data should not
be used for reactor system computations unless differences in volumes of

system trapped gas are accounted for.

Other priming tests were performed by lowering of the liquid level
in the pump tank slowly with the pump running. A test was performed with
the 13-in. diameter impeller operating at 1450 gpm, 50 ft head, and
starting liquid level at 1 1/2-in. above center line of the volute. In-
gassing began at approximately U4 1/2-in. below the center line of the
volute. At 5 1/2 in. below the center line of the volute, the system
flow dropped to 700 gpm, and 6 1/2 in. below the center line of the
volute, the flow reduced to zero.

A test was performed with the 1ll-in. impeller operating at 1250 gpm,
L5 ft and starting liquid level at 1 1/2 in. above the center line of the
volute. Ingassing began at approximately 3 in. below the center line of
the volute. Vigorous ingassing and loss of head and flow began at 3 1/2 in.

-below the volute center line.

Coastdown Characteristics

Cogstdown tests were performed on the drive motor and pump with the
13-in. impeller to determine the time required for the unit to stop after
opening the drive motor circuit from the electric supply. Tests were
performed on the same flow resistance line for operating speeds of 1150,
1030, and 860 rpm at flow rates of 1630, 1450, and 1210 gpm, respectively.
Coastdown times to zero speed ranged from 10.1 to 10.4 sec., and for flow

reduction to 540 gpm, the times ranged from 1.5 to 2.0 sec.
CONCLUSIONS

From the experimental hydraulic characteristics, the total head was
found to deviate from reported data by +1 to -3 ft. It was found necessary
to insert a prerotation baffle in the inlet to improve the head at reduced
flows. :
Based on the water test results, a 1ll.5-in. diameter impeller will
be required to meet the reactor design head and flow (48.5 ft and 1200 gpm).
This dimension will be more precisely determined during the prototype fuel
pump tests.

Fountain flow was observed over the whole range ‘of .operation and
. found to be outward from the upper “labyrinth into the pump tank, which
1s the desired direction. Gas bubbles created by the fountain and
stripping flows vere removed in the pump tank with assistance from the
various baffles.

With regard to priming, the pump would prime (full head and flow)
instantaneously with speed at static levels of 1 in. or more above the
center "line of. the volute.

Gas stripping was accomplished in the pump tank with a relative
effectiveness of up to 99 percent. Sweep gas flow rate » stripping flow,
and Jet velocity were found to have quite pronounced effects on the
‘stripping rate of a given stripper configuration. It was concluded that
the zenon removal rate will be primarily dependent on the fraction of
fuel processed rather than on improved stripper configurations.

The hydraulic characteristics were found to be adequate for the
anticipated requirements of the fuel circuit of the MSRE. The required
control of liquid and gas behavior in the pump tank was accomplished by
the use of baffles.
