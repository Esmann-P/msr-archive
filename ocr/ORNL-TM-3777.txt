E. G. Bohlmann

ABSTRACT AND SUMMARY

A literature review and canvass of vendors reveals no
experience and gparse, short term data bearing on the possible
use of heat transfer salt (HTS - 407% NaNO,, 7% NaNOs, 53% KNO3)
at temperatures > 1000°F. Stability data found indicate that
in a steam generator loop running with a maximum temperature of
1100°F about 0.5% of the NaNO, would decompose per day according
to the overall reaction

5NaNO, = 3NaNO3 + Naz0 + Nz ,

In the size loop envisioned for a Molten Salt Breeder Reactor (MSBR)
the nitrogen produced would amount to 3400 ft3/d.

Austenitic stainless steels are recommended materials of
construction above 850°F and short term test data suggest high
nickel alloys like Incoloy, and Inconel would also be suitable.
I would infer that Hastelloy-N would be resistant also.

A tertiary HTS steam generator loop would provide an effective
barrier to transfer of tritium formed in an MSBR to the steam
generator. The tertiary loop is required to eliminate the
possibility of a violent moderator graphite - HTS reaction. How-
ever, projected use in an MSBR at temperatures to v 1100°F would
require a substantial development program directed at stability
and/or composition re-adjustment and verification of materials
compatibility. Thus, the presence of appreciable Na;0 and/or
NaOH, depending on steam leakage, at such temperatures might
appreciably alter the corrosion picture.

An industrial installation for drying NaOH was operated
one and one half years with a maximum temperature of 980°F
without difficulties due to corrosion or stability. The salt
loop was constructed of ASTM 106 Grade A steel.
INTRODUCTION

It is estimated that a molten salt breeder reactor will produce “2500

generator system must be prevented to avoid resultant contamination and

3T per day. Transfer of appreciable percentages of this 3T to the steam

containment problems. A substantial barrier to such transfer would be
provided by the use of heat transfer salt - HTS (Na-K, nitrite-nitrate
mixture) in the reactor steam generator circuit. The HTS would be expected

to block the tritium transfer in several ways:
1. Conversion of hydrogen to water by the reactions: (Cf Appendix A).

b. Hy, + 1/2 0% + Ho0 AF ~-46 kcal

From NaNO3 ZT NaNO» + 1/2 0»

2. HIS systems are compatible with steam (used as inert cover gas in
industrial applications’) so the water formed in 1 would not be corrosive
to the steam generator tubing, thereby eliminating that possible alternate
tritium transport mechanism,

3. The tritiated water could be stripped from the HTS as required.

4. Protective oxides, which inhibit tritium diffusion, are formed

on alloys in contact with urs. 2

Originally, consideration was given to the substitution of the HTS
for the fluoroborate secondary coolant. However, the probability of a

3,4 between the HTS and the graphite moderator (see

violent interaction
section, Safety Precautions) in the event of contact during an accident
eliminated this possibility. Such a violent interaction has been con-
firmed by an investigation carried out by Bamberger and Ross (Cf.
Appendix B). Use of HTS as the secondary coolant would also necessitate
extensive demonstration of compatibility with the very high radiation

intensities in the primary heat exchanger.

An alternate possibility is the use of HTS in a separate, tertiary
steam generator loop; 'LiF-BeF,, or 92 NaBF.-8NaF, would be used in the
secondary loop. Increased cost would make this approach untenable were

it not for other positive considerations. These include:
1. The low, 288°F, melting point of HTS makes possible significant
simplification of the steam system; cheaper alloys would also be useable.

2. Steam leaks into HTS will not enhance corrosion as it would in
92NaBF 4~8NaF or other fluoride coolants. Assuming all the water leaking
into the fluoroborate participates, n 5 moles/h is equivalent to 1 mpy
(uniform) for the entire secondary loop of an MSBR.

3. Use of 'LiF-BeF, in the secondary loop would eliminate poisoning
of the fuel by leakage of secondary salt into the fuel; minor reverse
leakage would also be more tolerable since the secondary loop could be
included in the reactor cell. A substantially cheaper alternate might be
NaF-ZrF, which has a reasonably low cross section and which probably is

removable by the presently considered fuel processing methods.

Robertson’ has estimated the added cost of a third HTS loop, taking
into account savings due to the above and other considerations. He con-
cluded, "Addition of the (LB and HTS) loops would increase the power
production costs by 0.2 - 0.3 mills/kwhr, making the total cost about
5.5 mills/kwhr." The added capital cost amounted to 10 to 13 million
dollars (206 total) depending on whether Incoloy 800 could be substituted

for Hastelloy N in the secondary loop.

While this estimated increased cost was not favorable to the third
loop approach to tritium control, this survey of the "state of the art"
as regards use of HTS under MSBR conditions was also conducted. At first
blush it appeared that the widespread industrial experience would minimize
the development required for such adaptation; unfortunately the survey

showed such optimism was not well founded.

COMPOSITION AND STABILITY

Heat transfer salt was developed by duPont in the thirties? for use
in the chemical and petroleum process industries, notably the Houdry
catalytic cracking and refining units. The usual weight 7% composition is
40NaNO,, 7NaNO3, 53 KNO3 which melts at 288°F; the melting point is not
greatly affected by appreciable alterations as shown in Table 1.

Apparently the technology grew "like Topsy,’ as regards both composition
and materials of construction, out of many years experience with salt

baths used in heat treating and cleaning metals.

Presumably because of this and proprietary considerations, there is
a paucity of quantitative data on stability and corrosion in the open and
vendor literature; this in spite of widespread use in substantial
quantities — one Houdry unit used nv 10% 1b. Low cost (still 15¢/1b) and
tractability under ''rough and ready" handling also may have contributed.

At the time of its introduction the low, 288°F, melting point was a
major advantage since it was below the temperature at which steam was

available in most plants. The need for steam jackets and tracers, design
for complete gravity drainage, and other freeze-melt problems, however,
gave the competitive nod to organics like ''Dowtherm'" for temperatures below

700°F. A patented European development available under license in the U.S.
7,8

by American Hydrotherm Corp., eliminates these problems by "salt dilution.’
This involves adding sufficient water to the salt at startup—and starting
at 500°F on cooldown to keep the salt in solution at ambient (n 50°F)
temperature. The water is gradually flashed off at 200 - 500°F while
circulating through the system; this eliminates the severe thermal shock
of starting circulation at 500°F in a cold system or need for provision of
an alternate preheat capability. Ten pilot plant and thirty-two plant size
systems of this kind have been in operation since 1961 or are now under
construction. American Hydrotherm claims a 20% saving on capital costs
for the use of salt dilution instead of dry salt,’ with no resultant
materials or handling problems. A point by point comparison by American
Hydrotherm®’ 1° of "Dowtherm A" with HTS using salt dilution indicates
substantially lower costs for the latter. The dilution process also
eliminates problems which may be caused by increases in melting point due
to oxidation of nitrite to nitrate or formation of relatively insoluble
Na;CO3 from pickup of o,.2 J. Alexander, Jr., and S. G. Hindint have
published detailed studies of the freezing points of the system sodium and
potassium nitrites and nitrates and the effects of impurities on them.
Commercially used measures for countering these effects also discussed
included:

1. Use of hydrogen treatment in a bypass adsorption tower to reduce
excess nitrate to nitrite.”

2. Addition of concentrated HNO; or gaseous NO» to convert hydroxides
and carbonates to nitrates and nitrites.

3. Cold trap use to reduce carbonate levels.

Sodium hydroxide is formed by the reaction of the Nas0 thermal

decomposition product of HTS with water.

Paul Larson’? indicated hydrogen treatment was no longer used because
addition of fresh salt proved cheaper than providing for doing the

reduction.

elevated temperatures were fruitless in spite of vendor and open literature

well characterized by one lead which reported successful use of HTS at
temperatures as high as 1200 - 1300°F. A couple of phone calls located
my original informant's source but produced the usual disclaimer. The
use at such temperatures was occasional and involved only several pounds
of HTS, which gave no trouble "if changed frequently." When asked what

happened to the HTS, the reply was, "It gets pretty lumpy .....fast."

Up to nv 850°F widespread experience indicates HTS is stable in carbon
steel systems even when operated with air access to the system. Slow
oxidation of nitrite to nitrate and carbonate formation may increase the
freezing point slowly, but these changes apparently do not result in any
difficulties. Thus, Crowley and Helms trip report’? gives the composition

for bulk salt after an indeterminate period of operation (probably > 2
years). The system has remained in operation with this salt charge since
April 1967 (v 24000 h @ 800°F maximum) with no requirement for composition
adjustment; new salt is added only to make up for losses. Helms also
reportss’ 8 years use of tha same batch of "Hitec" at a maximum bulk salt
temperature of 843°F without observable deterioration; air access was
prevented by nitrogen blanketing in this application. Vendor literature
recommends such nitrogen, or steam, blanketing>? 14 above 850°F, but

contacts with vendor personnel uncovered no experience at such temperatures.

was used. The addition of chromate is reported (ca. 1940) 19 to inhibit
decomposition of the nitrite to nitrate and oxide but Rottenberg (1957)3
states that the claims had not been established, Paul Larson’? also
indicated that duPont had not found such additions either harmful or
beneficial; but some users insisted on making them. W. H. v.d. Broek’?
showed nitrite decrease rates graphically for 1 1/2 and 2 1/2 year

periods of operation at maximum temperatures of 980 and 800°F respectively
as shown in Fig. 1. Unfortunately only the plots for nitrite loss were
given, so it is not possible (no analyses) to determine how the two

possible reactions

contributed to the observed changes. Also, during the high temperature
operation, concern about the pump caused the system to be opened to the
atmosphere frequently; this was minimized during the second run at 800°F.
Still another factor may have contributed to the rapid loss of nitrite

at 980°F; it is reported”? that the decomposition of alkali nitrate -
nitrite mixtures is catalyzed by iron above 520°C, and the system described
by v.d. Broek was made of carbon steel. Stainless steel does not catalyze

The formation of NayCO3; and/or NaOH from reactions of carbon dioxide or
water with the Na,0 formed in (2) account for the melting point increases
with air, steam, and carbon dioxide blankets. Conversion of the nitrite
to nitrate by reactions (4) and (5) probably accounts for the rapid
increase in melting point with NO as the blanket gas. Reactions (2)

thru (5) produce the rise under nitrogen, again through conversion of
nitrite to nitrate. This is indicated by analysis of a salt mixture
after six weeks under nitrogen at 1100°F which showed the composition

to be that given in Table 2, with a melting point of 320°F. 12

decomposition reaction is

This stoichiometry was used to calculate the nitrogen evolution rate from
the results reported by the experimenters; the rate was necessarily assumed
to be constant, although Voskresenskaya and Berul'?> and others indicate
it decreases with time. The calculated N; evolution rates are those given
in the final column in Table 3 and are plotted in Figure 3. Considering
the disparate conditions of the several investigations the results are
pleasantly consistent although more data would be helpful in more firmly
removing the possibility of coincidence. The two low points due to
Voskresenskaya and Berul' are for the experiments performed in silver;
they and other investigators reported lower decomposition rates in noble
metal containers than in carbon and alloy steels. The data due to

v.d. Broek are of particular interest; recall that they were obtained
from HTS in use in an industrial process loop (dewatering NaOH) and the
only temperatures given were the maximums in the loop. Thus the average
temperatures were appreciably lower and the data should fall below those
from the isothermal studies of Larson and Gurovich and Shtokman — as they
do. The consistency in all these studies suggests that the measured

decomposition rates may be reasonably accurate for an engineering operation.

If one accepts then that these data may be considered reasonably
representative of the tertiary loop as envisioned by Robertson’ (maximum
temperature 1100°F), a decomposition rate of about 40 cc Np/mole NaNO,/d
would be anticipated. For the 9 x 10° 1b of HTS (40% NaNO,) in the
tertiary loop, this amounts to 4200 moles (3400 ft3) Np/d. The nitrite
loss would amount to 21,200 (2200 1b) moles per day; i.e., 1.0%/d.

Extrapolation to temperatures above 1100°F is questionable since

23,24 report nitrogen oxides are also evolved above 600°C.

various workers
These were short term studies, however, and it may be that the evolution

of oxides of nitrogen would not continue after a period, as happened in

the longer term studies at lower temperatures. Voskresenskaya and Berul'Z?
also reported substantial attack on the containers in some of their
experiments, unlike other experimenters. When this occurred with high

Cr alloys, appreciable amounts of chromate were found in the melts.

Voskresenskaya and Berul'?> also present data showing the rate of
nitrogen evolution as a function of nitrite concentration. These data,
interpolated from a small graph and given in Table 4, are only indicative,
but they are consistent with other observations. This suggests that a
mixture consisting of 87 NaNO», 427 NaNO; and 50% KNO3 might result in
lower N» evolution rates. The sodium nitrate-sodium nitrite ratio was
chosen on the basis of Freeman's>” observation that the ratio (under one
atmosphere of oxygen) is 5.9 at 600°C. Curiously, no observer mentions
the evolution of oxygen from the usual mixtures at such temperatures.
Alexander and Hindin's'! data indicate a melting point of Nv 420°F for
such a mixture, still adequately low for simplification of the steam

cycle.
Apparently the equilibrium

NaNO3 <=> NaNO, + 202
is substantially shifted to the left in HTS; Freeman's data indicate Po,
would be about 0.3 atm at 600°C for the usual mixture. Presumably,
however, the equilibrium would shift to the right as the percent nitrate
is increased, with resultant evolution of oxygen. Perhaps a mechanism
change also occurs and the oxygen appears as the oxides of nitrogen

CORROSION
As with thermal stability, corrosion data are sparse, and then only
from relatively short term tests. Considerable experience has demonstrated
acceptable, economic performance with no apparent necessity for quantita-
tive, long term corrosion data. The vendors recommend against use of
carbon steel above 850°F; at lower temperatures it gives excellent, long

term service. Rottenberg> gives the following description of how

troubles can arise in a poorly designed maloperated, direct fired heater,
"The main danger is, as usual, overheating in the stagnant film at
heating surfaces. The danger is accentuated in this case by the ability
of HTS to detach particles of rust and scale from the inside of the plant
and deposit it as sludge at the bottom. Even more important is the fact
that with gross overheating, at local temperatures above 700°C, a new
reaction sets in with the rapid breakdown of nitrate to oxygen, nitrogen,
and oxide. In the presence of a mild steel surface, the oxygen combines
with it in a thermite type reaction which is self-sustaining and rapidly
burns through the metal. No reaction takes place with stainless steel.

In plants operating at high bulk temperatures heating sections should be
constructed of stainless steel to obviate this danger."

In the operation described previously, however, v.d. Broekl® observed no
corrosion of the system during 1 1/2 years of operation with a maximum
temperature of 980°F. The heater section and the rest of the heat transfer
loop were made of carbon steel (ASTM Al06) with nickel and "Incoloy' at

the interfaces in the NaOH concentrator. Conventional use of nickel and
nickel alloys for materials of construction in caustic concentrators

using heat transfer salt2® and v.d. Broek's experience indicate good
compatibility for these materials to v 1000°F. Other qualitative
assessments of corrosion by heat transfer salt during extended operating
periods are summarized in Table 5.

Miscellaneous corrosion data are shown in Table 6, taken from the

probable that the results are from quite short term (a few hundred hours)
tests. The two period tests at 1058°F indicate the corrosion rates of
the highly alloyed materials decrease with time. Note, however, that
Inconel was an exception in spite of the excellent results at 1000°F

and for nickel at 1100°F. Similar results are shown by data furnished

by J. Friedman?’ which are presented in Table 7. The relatively short

term data presented are consistent with parabolic rate law behavior —
mils penetration = k Vt; the extrapolated penetrations at one year are
calculated from the data using this expression. The alloy compositions

tested are given in Table 8.

The "Hitec" pamphlet’ (page 10) indicates copper is useable at
moderate temperatures (to 600°F), but corrodes rapidly at higher
temperatures — 30 mils/mo at 1000°F, see Table 6. Rottenberg> indicates,
"Copper, aluminum, magnesium, and their alloys are all attacked more or
less rapidly and should not be allowed to come into contact with HTS."
(See additional comment on aluminum and magnesium under Safety Pre-

cautions.)

The presence of sulfate is said to be deleterious to the low alloy
steels like CML and CRM2 (see Table 8), and Rottenberg> states, ''the
corrosive action of HTS is greatly affected by the presence of oxide and
hydroxide." Insolubles, like carbonate, may lead to erosion or localized
overheating problems. ? The oxide and hydroxide effects would require
investigation since temperatures of interest in MSBR's presumably would
produce appreciable oxide which would be converted to hydroxide by any

steam leakage.

PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

Table 9, compiled by Robertson,” compares several salts useable in

MSBR's. Hitec compares favorably with the other two coolant salts.

The remainder of this section, and the subsequent one on Safety

 

Precautions is taken from the "Hitec" pamphlet. > Figure and Table

 

numbers are those used in the pamphlet.

"Freshly prepared "Hitec" is a white, granular solid; in the molten
state, it has a pale yellow color. It is a eutectic mixture of inorganic
salts having the following composition:

Potassium Nitrate 53%
Sodium Nitrite 407%
Sodium Nitrate 77%

Freezing Point

"The freezing point of fresh "Hitec" is 288°F, and it can therefore
be melted readily by plant steam at a pressure as low as 50 psig. The
presence of a small amount of moisture sharply reduces the freezing point,
and in order to determine the freezing point accurately, it is recommended
that the salt be melted and dried by heating at about 480°F. Driving off
water vapor in this manner may cause effervescence or frothing, depending
on the amount of moisture present, and it is recommended that suitable
precautions be taken to protect personnel from spattering by the hot,

molten salt.

Viscosity

"The viscosity of molten "Hitec" was measured over the temperature
range from 300 to 820°F, and these data were extrapolated to 1000°F with
an accuracy believed sufficient for design purposes. The experimental
points and extrapolated curve are shown in the graph of viscosity versus

temperature, Figure 6.

Electrical Resistivity

 

"The electrical resistivity of molten "Hitec" is 1.7 ohms per cu.cm.
This value is approximately midway between that of water, 25 x 10° ohms

per cu.cm., and that of mercury, 95.9 x 10° ohms per cu.cm.

Density

"The density-temperature relationship for molten "Hitec" is presented
in the alignment chart of Figure 7. By drawing a straight line from the
desired point on the temperature scale through the reference point, density
can be read from the chart in grams per cu.cm., pounds per cu.ft., or

pounds per U.S. gallon.

Thermal Conductivity

 

"Thermal conductivity measurements on '"Hitec' heat transfer salt have
been reported by W. D. Powers, ANP Quarterly Progress Report, September 30,
1957, ORNL-2387 (Classified). A value of 0.35 B.T.U./(hr.) (sq.ft.)
(°F./ft.) independent of temperature in the range from 468 to 689°F was
obtained using a parallel-plate, variable sample gap apparatus such as
that described in ASME paper 56-SA-31 by C. F. Lucks and H. W. Deen.
Battelle Memorial Institute, in a similar apparatus, extended the tem-
perature range and obtained a value of 0.33 B.T.U./(hr.) (°F./ft.)
independent of temperature in the range from 400 to 900°F. (private
communication from H. W. Hoffman, Oak Ridge National Laboratory and
Battelle Memorial Institute).

"An earlier Russian article by Vargaftik, Neimark, and Oleshchuck
which appeared in the Bulletin of the V.T.I., September 1952, No. 9 had
reported values in the temperature range from 302 to 932°F which ranged

from 0.26 to 0.17 B,T.U./(hr.) (sq.ft.) (°F./ft.).

Heat Transfer Coefficient

 

"Heat transfer coefficients (h) for "Hitec" flowing in turbulent
motion inside horizontal circular, iron pipes have been determined over
the temperature range of 580 to 960°F at linear velocities up to 6 feet
per second. Details of this experimental work are published in
Transactions of American Institute of Chemical Engineers 36, 371 (1940).
Data on the thermal conductivity of "Hitec" were lacking, and the experi-

mental results, therefore, were correlated in terms of the function

Under these conditions, the heat transfer coefficient varied from 800 to
2900 B.T.U./(hr.) (sq.ft.) (°F). In heat transfer applications, "Hitec"
behaves as a normal fluid and the standard correlations may be used in

designing heat exchange equipment.

Thermal Expansion
"The coefficient of linear thermal expansion for solid "Hitec",
measured by the Dilatometer method of ASTM-D696-44, is 2.85 x 10~3
per °F. The coefficient of cubical thermal expansion for liquid "Hitec"
is 2.016 x 10~" per °F. (private communication from H. W. Hoffman, Oak

Ridge National Laboratory).

Specific and Latent Heat

 

"The total heat of "Hitec" was measured calorimetrically over the
temperature range of 70 to 1100°F., The slopes of the total heat-
temperature lines, Figure 8, indicated that the specific heat of solid
"Hitec" is 0.32 and that of the melt 0.373 calories per gram per °C
(or B.T.U. per pound per °F). Latent heat of fusion appeared to be

approximately 20 calories per gram (35 B.T.U. per pound).

Efficiency

"The efficiency of "Hitec" heat transfer salt is well illustrated by

a direct comparison to hot air, or flue gas, on a performance basis.

lations used to obtain these data are given in the previously cited

SAFETY PRECAUTIONS

Principal Hazards

"The principal hazards associated with "Hitec" are those which apply
to any operation involving the use of liquids at elevated temperatures.
Adequate precautions should be taken to protect operating personnel from
burns in case of equipment failure. There is a lesser danger that "Hitec,"
by supporting the combustion of other materials, may escalate an existing
fire hazard. Similarly, there is a danger that prolonged contact of
"Hitec" with human skin may cause dermatitis. Finally, "Hitec" should
not be ingested by operating personnel in more than trace amounts because
of the sodium nitrite which it contains.

"'Hitec' itself liberates no toxic vapors, but adequate ventilation
should be supplied to remove products of combustion due to accidental or
process contamination of the "Hitec" system. Although the combustion
products of most organic compounds are principally carbon dioxide and
water, traces of highly toxic gases such as carbon monoxide, oxides of
nitrogen, etc., may also be present, It is reported that, in instances
where a process utilizing "Hitec" generates steam, operating personnel
complain of a salty taste after being in the area for a period of time,
particularly when the weather is humid. Adequate ventilation will relieve

this condition.

Combustion Hazards

"Although "Hitec" itself is nonflammable, it will support the
combustion of other materials, and salt units should not be located in
the vicinity of wooden construction. Similarly, contamination of the
work area with ""Hitec' may increase any fire hazard created by the
presence of combustible materials. These problems may be minimized by
washing the work area regularly with water and by substituting non-
flammable materials for combustible materials. For example, sand rather
than sawdust should be used for clean-up, diking, ete. A number of tests
have been carried out to estimate the hazards associated with the

accidental contact of flammable materials with hot, molten "Hitec," but
32

since it is impossible to anticipate all conditions under which this
product may be used, it is recommended that the user carry out additional
tests before undertaking any novel applications.

"Combustible vapors generally react relatively slowly with "Hitec" and
escape before combustion is complete. Gasoline vapors, high in unsaturated
compounds, were bubbled through the molten salt for two hours at 1100°F,
and over 90% of the gasoline was recovered unchanged. The reaction between
"Hitec" and ammonia was also studied under similar conditions, and less
than 50% of the ammonia reacted with the "Hitec" over a two-hour period
at 1100°F. In both cases, changes in the salt were minor.

"Flammable liquids tend to vaporize rapidly in contact with molten
"Hitec" and burn at the surface in the same manner as they might be
ignited on any hot surface. Crude oil, for example, burned in a similar
manner on the surface of "Hitec" at 1150°F. and on the surface of molten
lead at the same temperature. Motor gasoline, cracked gasoline, gas oil,
and crude oil mixed with sulfur were released below the surface of an
open container of "Hitec" at 1100°F. In all cases, the hydrocarbons
vaporized and burned, and in the cases of crude oil and gasoline, there
was considerable spattering of hot salt due to the rapid, sub-surface
vaporization of the liquids. Again, there was little change in the salt
composition, indicating that the principal reactions were between the
vaporized hydrocarbons and the air above the salt bath,

"Combustible solids, such as wood, coke, paper, plastics, cyanides,
chlorates, ammonium salts, and active metals, such as aluminum and
magnesium, offer somewhat greater hazards. Magnesium, except as an
alloying agent in low concentration, must not come in contact with "Hitec."
Heat treatment of aluminum parts in molten "Hitec" is a common and safe
practice when suitable precautions are taken, as discussed in "Potential
Hazards in Molten Salt Baths for Heat Treatment of Metals," Research
Report No. 2, The National Board of Fire Underwriters (1946), 85 John
Street, New York 7, New York. Thus, we strongly recommend that before
attempting to use "Hitec" in this type application the potential hazards
as discussed in the reference article be reviewed.

"In these cases it is possible for the solid combustible materials to

remain in contact with the hot salt until they are completely oxidized,
33

and large volumes of combustion gases can be formed rapidly beneath the
salt surface. This could, of course, result in rupture of equipment or
violent spattering of hot salt,

"Violent combustion resulted when ground petroleum coke was held
beneath the surface of "Hitec!" at 1150°F., and in contact with iron, a
thermite-like reaction took place. Similarly, mixtures of fine aluminum
and iron filings reacted with "Hitec" at 1000°F. with the evolution of
enough heat to burn through a nickel crucible.

"Finely divided charcoal flared up and burned vigorously when placed
on the surface of "Hitec" at 1200°F., but grease burned quietly under the
same conditions. When an oxygen-balanced mixture of "Hitec" and paraffin
was heated rapidly to 1100°F., the paraffin merely volatilized and burned,
leaving the salt practically unchanged. However, an 80/20 mixture of
"Hitec" and nylon burned vigorously at 750°F., and subsequent analysis
indicated the oxidizing salts had taken part in this reaction, as they
had in the case of the coke held beneath the salt surface.

"All attempts to detonate "Hitec" or mixtures of "Hitec" with
combustible products, such as paraffin, petroleum, nylon, and topped
Houdry condensate, at 375°F. and 25 inches of mercury vacuum, were
unsuccessful using either a No. 8 blasting cap or 0.5 1b. of blasting
gelatin as the initiator. The salt was similarly insensitive at 1100°F.
Attempts to detonate oxygen-balanced mixtures of "Hitec" and either finely
divided charcoal or topped Houdry concentrate by heating the mixtures
vigorously under confinement were also unsuccessful, It was estimated
that pressures as high as 18,000 psi were attained during these tests.

"Water from spray sprinklers or low-velocity fog nozzles will not
penetrate the surface of molten "Hitec" sufficiently to cause dangerous
spattering, and this type of fire protection is recommended for oil-fired
units and for processes involving combustible materials. Carbon dioxide
and approved dry-powder type fire extinguishers can be used satisfactorily
to extinguish fires in the vicinity of a salt unit, but vaporizing liquid
(carbon tetrachloride), foam, and aqueous types, other than sprinklers
or low-velocity fog types, should not be used. An adequate supply of
clean, dry sand is useful for slagging and diking to confine the spread

of escaped molten salt.
34

"If, for some reason, water is introduced into a unit containing
"Hitec," the heat input should be kept low until all the water has been
evaporated, and the system should be vented adequately in order to

release the steam which is formed."

Subject: The Reaction, H,(g) + (Na,K)NO3(L) Z (Na,K)NO,(R) + H,0(g)

I concur with the conclusion of Ed Bohlmann, namely, that the equilibrium,
given above can prevent tritium from reaching the feed water and steam of a
molten~salt reactor.

The basic data and considerations are as follows:
Nominal Composition of HTS

KNO3; - NaNO; - NaNO 53 = 40 ~ 7 weight 7%
49 - 44 - 7 mole 7%

HIS is a reciprocal system:
KNO3 (2) + NaNO2(2) ZT KNO2(L) + NaNO3(®)

Assuming that nitrate ion is larger than nitrite ion, this equilibrium is
shifted somewhat to the left (the 'large-large, small-small' rule in reciprocal
systems). The ratio of activities, KNO3/KNO, and NaNO, /NaNO; would, therefore,
be greater than unity.

Three equilibria to consider are:
(1) KNO3 (2) Z KNOL (2) + 1/2 02(g), AG (kcal) = 27.6 - 24,4(T/1000)

Reactions of HITEC with Graphite and with 72-16-12 (1iF-BeF;-ThF.) Salt

C. E. Bamberger and R. G. Ross®

A batch of 50 g of HITEC was prepared by melting the analytical grade
components (NaNO, NaNOj3, KNO3) in a quartz tube under argon. After
melting, argon was bubbled through the liquid for 15 minutes (in order to
remove any significant amount of moisture); the melt was cooled under
flowing argon and stored in a dessicator.

In the first experiment a 10 g portion of HITEC was melted in an open
quartz tube giving a liquid layer of 3/4" depth. A piece of 4.5 g of
"MSRE" graphite hanging from a platinum wire was dipped briefly (30 to
120 sec) into the melt at successive increasing temperatures and the
vigible signs of reaction were noted. Following is a listing of the
observations. It made no difference whether the quartz tube was open

to the atmosphere or was blanketed by flowing argon.

No graphite introduced

 

340°C: Very small bubbles formed in the bulk of the melt which on raising
did not seem to disturb the surface of the liquid. The bubbles
were so small that they were observed only by means of a catheto-

meter.

Graphite in the Melt

 

340°C: Large bubbles formed at the interface.

440°C: Faster evolution of large bubbles at the interface, the melt
remained clear yellow.

490°C: The melt became black 10-20 sec. after the graphite was introduced.
The formation of bubbles was more vigorous than before. After

removing the graphite the melt cleared up in ca. 5 minutes.

545°C: The melt became black again, then the melt started foaming
vigorously and after approximately 45 seconds the graphite piece
became suddenly incandescent. At this point a sharp rise of tem-
perature was recorded. The graphite was removed and after approxi-
mately 10 minutes the melt cleared up again. The experiment was
terminated.

The experiment was repeated and the reactions were recorded on 16 mm
movie film, the only difference being that the melt was heated rapidly to
440°C and then to 550°C. The observations were the same as above but the
time required for the incandescence of the graphite was ca. 2 minutes.
After removal and cooling the graphite used in both experiments was
washed and examined visually; it revealed a high degree of pitting and
enhancement of the cracks that were initially present.

In a third experiment, approximately 9 g each of HITEC and 72-16-12
(LiF-BeF,-ThF,) salt were loaded into a quartz tube (the HITEC at the
bottom) and were gradually heated. At 250°C the molten HITEC bubbled
at the interface with the lumps of fluoride salt and became cloudy-white,
then completely opaque. In the range 350-410°C a large amount of yellow-
brownish gas was evolved. The lumps of salt were no longer visible. At
430°C vigorous foaming occurred which displaced liquid and suspended
material upwards. The experiment was terminated. Upon cooling, the
solids were digested in hot water and repeatedly washed prior to
analyzing the residue by x-ray diffraction. The results indicated the
presence of ThO, (major phase), BeO and LiF. (A few unidentified lines
were also present.)

This could be interpreted to be the result of reactions such as

ThFu(d) + 2NO3~ + 2NO,~ Zz ThOz2(c) + 4F + 2N,04(g)
BeF2(d) + NO3~ + NO,~ 2 BeO(c) + 2F~ + N20u(g) (or 2NO2(g))

From what is known of the oxide chemistry of U(IV) there is no doubt
that UO would be the first insoluble phase to form if fuel salt is
contacted by HITEC,
