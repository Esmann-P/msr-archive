“7 Abstract

Fuel-salt volumes external to the core of a molten-salt reactor are calculated
for a system in which the fuel salt circulates through the core and primary exchanger
by free convection. In the calculation of these volumes, the exchanger heights above
the core top range from 5 to 20 ft. Coolants considered for the primary exchanger
are a second molten salt and helium. External fuel holdup is found tc be the same
with either coolant. Two sets of terminal temperatures are selected for the helium.
The first combination permits steam generation at 850 psia, 900°F., The second set
is selected for a closed gas turbine cycle with an 1100°F turbine inlet tempersture.
Specific power (thermal kw/kg 235) is found to be about 900 kw/kg, based on initial,
clean conditions and a 60 Mw (thermal) output. A specific power of 1275 kw/kg is

estimated for a forced convection system of the same rating.

A MOLTEN SALT NATURAL CONVECTION REACTOR SYSTEM
F. E. Romie¥*

Introduction
One of the problems of a circulating-liquid-fuel reactor is the provision of
reliable, long-lived fuel circulating pumps. This problem is eliminated for a
system in which the fuel is circulated through the primery exchanger and reactor
core by natural convection. The advantages of omitting the circulating pump and
its attendant problems of maintenance and replacement are purchased at the price
of increased fuel-salt volume in the primary exchanger and in the convection
risers. There are applications for a reactor system in which the premium placed
on relisbility and ease of maintenance could meke the convection system attractive.
The purpose of this report is to investigate a free-convection reactor system in

order to afford a basis for assessing its merits.

Selection of Reactor Conditions

A schematic representation of the reactor and primary heat exchanger is shown
in Figure (1). The fuel salt returned to the core after cooling in the heat exchanger
enters the bottom of the reactor sphere and leaves through the top. The temperature
of the fuel salt entering the heat exchanger is specified to be 1225°F, a temperature
which available corrosion information indicates is consistent with long-term life
for the system. With this temperature and a thermal output of 60 Mw, it is possible
to consider selection of steam turbine conditions of conventional plants. Thus tem-

perature conditions in the fluids passing through the primary exchanger have been

selected to permit generation of 850 psia, 900°F steam. For a thermal output of 60 Mw
these steam conditions would give a generator output of sbout 22 Mw {37% efficiency).

The 1225%F maximum salt temperature also allows consideration of a closed gas
turbine cycle using helium at a turbine inlet temperature of 1100°F. For this tem-
perature and the postulated cycle parameters summarized in Table I%* the turbine
output would be about 19 Mw (30.8% efficiency).

The importance of desirable nuclear properties for the fuel salt takes precedence
over the thermal properties in the selection of a fuel salt. Tor this reason a mixture
of lithium and beryllium fluoride salts is selected. For such mixtures the viscosity
increases and the melting point decreases with increasing beryllium content. Mixture
130 (63% IiF, 36% BeF,, ~1% UF) on a mole % basis), with a melting point of 850°F,
has been selected as giving a reasonable combination of these two properties. The

pertinent physical properties of this salt are given in Table II.

= The secondary fluid in the primary exchanger is limited by compatibility con-
siderations (1) to either a gas or a molten salt. Both possibilities are treated.
In the case of the molten salt cooling the heat from the reactor would be trans-
ferred from the fuel salt, to the coolant salt, to sodium, to water. A similar
system is described in Reference 1. Good compatibility with the fuel salt and low
fusion temperature (650°F) are the principal reasons for selection of Mixture 8h

(35% 1iF, 27% NaF, 38% BeF,) as the coolant salt.

The use of a gas as a coolant offers the advantage that, in the case of a
steam cycle, it would be the only fluid intermediate between the fuel salt and
the steam. In the case of the gas turbine cycle there would be no fluid inter-
mediate between the working fluid and fuel salt. The use of gas rather than salt
also eliminates heaters for the coolant salt and sodium circuits and decreases the
number of drain tanks required for the system. Gases suitable as a coolant are
hydrogen, helium and nitrogen. Helium is specifically considered in the following
because of its good heat transfer properties and nuclear and chemical inertness.

Hydrogen would be preferable from the point of view of heat transfer and pumping

considerations, while nitrogen, due to its higher molecular weight, would be attrac-
tive for use with a gas turbine cycle. The low molecular weights of hydrogen and
helium require the use of a large number of compressor and turbine stages. Nitrogen

would offer the advantage of using presently-developed compressor and turbine equipment.

Optimum Riser Conditions

The hydrostatic differential head causing the fuel-galt flow is proportional
to the product of the temperature change of the fuel salt and the height of the
exchanger above the reactor. The pressure drop available to the exchanger is the
hydrostatic head minus frictional losses occurring in the riser pipes. These fric-
tional losses decrease rapidly with lncreasing riser diameter, but at the expense
of an increased salt holdup volume in the riser. If the fuel-salt mass rate and
temperature change are both fixed, then, for the attainment cf a specified pressure
drop available to the exchanger, there is one combination of riser diameter and
height of exchanger for which the salt volume in the riser system will be a minimum.
The existence of this minimum is illustrated in Figure (2), in which the variation
of salt volume in the riser and of riser diameter are shown as a function of exchanger
height. Table ITT summarizes a set of optimm riser conditions used in this report.
Figure (2) and Table IV are based on the riser friction data given in Table III.

The frictional losses in the riser are found to be determined primarily by the
expansion and contraction losses and are insensitive to wall friction. Thus replace-
ment of a single riser by two sets of risers having an equal height and total cross
sectional area will make essentially the same pressure drop available to the exchanger
at the same riser holdup volume. This fact can be of use in decreasing the mechanical
rigidity of the piping and indicates that the use of two exchangers with separate

risers in place of one will not require an increased fuel holdup volume in the risers.

Part load Operation

For a given core-riser-exchanger system the flow rate of the fuel salt is
determined in terms of the difference in fuel salt temperature in the two legs
of the riser and the flow friction characteristic of the system. The part load
operation of a given system is shown in Figure (3). For the molten salt reactor
the average of the core inlet and exit temperatures is effectively a constant in-
dependent of heat output. Thus, if at rated conditions the salt temperature
entering the exchanger (leaving the core) were 1225°F, the salt temperature leav-

Hg ing the core at half-load would be, based on Figure (3), 1187°F, and the temperature

of the salt returned to the core would be 1030°F compared to 1000°F at full-load.

EF The terminal temperatures selected for the coolant salt are 875°F at inlet

 

to the primary exchanger and 1025°F at exit. These two temperatures remain un-

changed for all salt-cooled exchanger designs considered. The 875°F entrance

temperature is 050 above the fusion temperature of the fuel salt and 235% above
the fusion temperature of the coolant salt. Heat transfer data used in the cal-

culations are given in Table V.

Figures (4) and (5) summarize the results of exchanger calculations. In-
spection of these figures shows that increasing the height of the exchanger above
the reactor has no effect on the total length of exchanger tubing required and

hd UNCLASSIFIED

thus no effect on the fuel-salt volume within the exchanger tubes; however, in-
creasing the exchanger height leads to an increased length of the exchanger snd
a decrease in the number of tubes in the exchanger. Thus the tube bundle diameter
is decreased ang, consequently, the volume of fuel salt contained in the exchanger
header. However, the net result on salt volume external to the reactor is a slight
increase with increasing exchanger height. This increase is due to the increased
salt volume in the risers. If the number of exchanger tubes were the constant
parameter rather than the tube diameter, then an increase in exchanger height
would lead to a decrease in total holdup volume and a smaller diameter tube.

Decreasing the internal diameter of the exchanger tubes from 0.634 to 0.42 in.
produces, for a 10 ft height of the exchanger, about a 23% decrease in external
holdup volume, but at the expense of a 2.3-fold increase in the number of tubes.
Variation of the fuel-salt temperature drop over the range from 200 to 250°F pro-
duces a relatively minor effect on the exchanger designs.

The low thermal resistance of the coolant salt relative to that of the
laminarly-flowing fuel salt results in a small temperature difference between
the exchanger shell and tubes. Thus thermal stresses due to differential expan-
gion of tubes and shell should prove small enough to permit a straight tube design

despite the rather large temperature difference between the two salts.

Gas-Cooled Exchangers for Steam Cycle

For helium cooling of the primary exchanger, the terminal temperatures of
the helium were fixed at 850°F for inlet to the exchanger and 1025°F for outlet.
The drop in fuel-salt temperature was held at 205°%w, The 850°F inlet temperature
insures that the fuel salt will not freeze in the tubes, and the 1025°F exit tem-

perature is consistent with the generation of 900°F steam. The exchanger designs,

which are summarized in Table VI, are based on the use of 0.634 in. ID tubing
with copper fins. Dimensions of the finned tubes (Table VII) were scaled-up from
descriptions in Reference 2, from which the flow fraction and heat transfer datas
were also obtained.

With a single-pass cross flow exchanger, the salt flowing in the row of tubes
first contacted by the entering helium would leave the exchanger at a considerably
lower temperature than that in the last row of tubes. With laminar flow, the flow
resistance is directly proportional to the viscosity. Thus the salt velocity in
the first row would be less than in the last row, and the mean temperature of the
first row consequently lower than would be calculated on the basis of uniform flow
in all tubes. The effects leading to non-uniform salt flow are mutually aggravating,
with the result that a single-pass cross flow exchanger is unacceptable. A multi-
pass exchanger is thus required if a cross flow exchanger design is to be used. A
counterflow exchanger has the optimum configuration, both from the point of view
of obtaining uniform flow distribution and minimizing the required over-all conduc-
tance of the exchanger. |

The over-all dimensions given for the helium-cocled exchanger correspond to
a three-helium-pass cross flow exchanger. The column labeled "depth" refers to the
distance traveled by the helium in one pass (i.e., distance from front to rear of
tube array}. The "width" refers to the transverse dimension of the exchangers.

The fractional pressure loss, AP/P, listed in the table is based on a helium
pressure level at the exchanger of 100 psia. The fractional pressure loss is in-
versely proportional to the square of the pressure level. Thus, for example, if
the pressure of the helium were increased to 200 psia, the AP/P values shown in

Table VI would be quartered (without change in any other entries in the table).

If the pressure level of the helium were increased from 100 to 200 psia and
the exchanger altered in order to maintain AP/P constant, then the exchanger length
would be decreased from 78 ft to 48 ft and the depth increased from 0.77 to 1.2 ft.
Accompanying changes in the number of tubes, tube length and salt holdup volume
would be relatively negligible.

If the power expended in pumping the 100 psia helium through the exchanger
were increased from 2% to L% of generator output, (i.e., a = 0.00374), the depth
and length of the exchanger would change to 0.93 ft and 61 ft, respectively. Corre-
sponding changes in salt holdup volume, number of tubes and tube length would be
relatively negligible.

For a 10 ft height of the exchanger above the reactor, the calculated salt
volume external to the core is 172 cu ft for the reference exchanger. This can
be compared to a fuel-salt volume of 160 cu ft for the salt-cooled exchanger of

the same height, using exchanger tubes of the same internal diameter. If the

reactor core diameter is taken as 8 ft, corresponding to a fuel-salt volume of

UNCIASSIFIED
gas Ula
URCLASSIFIED
13.

268 cu ft, then these figures indicate that gas cooling can be used with a fuel-

salt volume increase of 12 cu ft in a total volume (exclusive of volume in expan-
sion tank) of 440 cu ft.

The major uncertainty in comparing the external fuel-salt volumes for the
gas-cooled and salt-cooled exchangers lies in the uncertainty in the salt volume
which should be attributed to the exchanger headers. For the present calculations
the header volume has been assumed to be 0.00438 £42 per 0.634 in. ID tube for both
the salt-cooled and gass-cooled exchangers. A more detailed design study is required
to fix the header volume more accurately.

Use of a smaller tube diameter for the gas-cooled exchanger would result in
a decreased fuel-sglt holdup volume at the expense of an increased number of
shorter tubes. The effect of using a 0.42 in. ID tube instead of the 0.63k in.
tube used in the calculations should parallel the behavior previously shown for
the salt-coocled exchanger.

A possible configuration for the three-pass exchanger is shown in Figure (6).
The configuration permits attachment of the riser pipes to the headers with suffi-
cient flexibility to minimize thermal stresses and provides a cylindrical containment
for the pressurized helium. Use of two such cylinders to contain the reference
exchanger would result in two exchangers, each 19 1/2 ft long. If the helium pres-

sure were increased to 200 psia, the length of each would be reduced to 12 ft.

Gas-Cooled Exchangers for Gas Turbine Cycle

The ‘major problem encountered in designs of exchangers for use with a gas
turbine cycle is the low temperature of the helium entering the helium-fuel-salt
exchanger. For the cycle parameters given in Table I, this temperature is 676°F,
& temperature 174%F below the fusion temperature of the salt. Exploratory calcu-

lations indicate that this low temperature would freeze the salt if an exchanger

using the finned surface described in Table VII were used.

For minimum fuel-sglt holdup in the exchanger tubes, the optimum solution

to the problem of maintaining a wall surface temperature above the freezing point
is found in the use of a counterflow exchanger, in which the gas-side thermal
resistance decreases in the direction of gas flow .in such a manner that the wall
temperature does not drop below a prescribed value. In the case of a longitudi-
nelly finned tube, the gas-side thermal resistance variation required could be
effected by increasing the fin height along the tube until the full fin height
is attained. For the remainder of the tube length, the fin height would be un-
changed and the tube wall temperature would increase above the prescribed minimum.
The exchanger calculations presented for the gas turbine cycle presume the use of
such an exchanger with a minimum wall-fuel-salt interfacial temperature of 900°F.
Results of the exchanger calculations are presented in Figure (7). The
abscissa, ¢ , is the ratio of the sum of the gas and wall thermal resistances
per unit tube length to the fuel-salt thermal resistance per unit length,

$ = Ry + Rg . The gas-side thermal resistance is defined as that which is

R
obtained®with the unaltered finned tubing. Using the thermal resistance data
presented in Table V, it is easily shown that the gas-side thermal resistances

corresponding to ¢ values of 0.25 and 1.5 are 0.003785 and 0.0321 . 'This
imately 40% in external fuel-salt holdup volume, number of tubes and length per tube.
No data are presently available defining the heat transfer and flow friction
characteristics of tube bundles using longitudinally finned tubes. Thus the
exchanger designs are incomplete. However, the number of tubes, tube length and
total external salt volume can be estimated with reasonable accuracy if it is
assumed, as seems likely, that the same value of ¢ can be realized with longitu-

dinally finned tubes as with circumferentially finned tubes. For the steam cycle

helium-cooled reference exchanger the value of ¢ is 0.47. Using this value of ¢
in Figure (7) gives, for an exchanger 10 ft above the reactor, a total salt holdup
volume of 160 £52, a total length of exchanger tubing of 36,200 ft, with 3300 tubes

11 ft long. A possible configuration for the exchanger is shown in Figure (8).

Comparison of Cooling Means

 

Table IX gives a comparison of the three cooling systems considered for the
conditions listed at the head of the table. The difference in external fuel-salt
holdup volume among the three systems is not large and is therefore not a determin-
ing factor in the selection of the coolant medium for the reactor.

In genersl, the helium-cooled exchangers have much larger over-all volumes
than the salt-coocled exchangers. This increased bulk is caused by the larger
spacing required by the finned tubes and also by the large volume required by the
helium headers. An increase in helium pressure will decrease the helium header
volume and also should decrease the fuel-salt header volume. The upper limit on
helium pressure is probably set by consideration of the effects of a tube rupture
on the fuel-salt system. It is of interest to note that other gas-cooled reactor
studies, apparently not limited by similar considerations, have recommended gas
pressures as high as 1000 psia. The 100 psia pressure specifically considered
in these calculations is probably conservatively low.

Comparison with Forced Convection System

 

Sd

Design of a forced convection reactor system (1) has led to an estimation
of 0.56 cu ft of fuel salt external to the reactor core per thermal megawatt.
For the free convection system, using 0.634 ID tubes in the primary exchanger,
the external volume is about 160 cu ft for 60 Mw, giving a specific volume of
2.67 cu ft/Mv. Using these numbers and initial-clean critical mass data (3),
the fuel inventory for 60 Mw minimizes, for both the free and forced convection
systems, at a core diameter of about 8 ft. At this diameter the specific powers
{kw thermal/kg 235) are 895 and 1275 kw/kg for the free and forced convection
systems, respectively. The free convection system is thus estimated to require
42% more inventory than the forced convection system.

Addition of a small amount of thorium to the core salt would produce some
breeding and a longer time interval between fuel additions. One-quarter percent

thorium requires shout an 87% increase in fuel inventory at a core diameter of 8 ft.
