FOREWORD

This quarterly progress report of the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion
Project at OBNL records the technical progress of the research on
the circulating-fuel reactor and all other ANP research at the
Laboratory under its Contract W-7405-eng-26. The report is
divided into three major parts: I. Reactor Theory and Design,
II. Materials Research, and ITI. Shielding Besearch. Each part
has a separate introduction and summary.

The ANP Project is comprised of about 300 technical and scien-
tific personnelengaged in many phases of research directed toward
the achievement of nuclear propulsion of aircraft. A considerable
portion of this research is performed in support of the work of
other organizations participating in the national ANP effort.
However, the bulk of the ANP research at ORNL is directed toward
the development of a circulating-fuel type of reactor,

The nucleus of the effort on circulating-fuel reactors is now
centered upon the Aircraft Reactor Experiment -~ a high-temperature
prototype of a circulating-fuel reactor for the propulsion of air-
craft. The equipment for this reactor experiment is now being
assembled; the current status of the experiment is summarized in
Section 1 of Part I. The supporting research on materials and
problems peculiar to the ARE - previously included in the subject
sections - 1s now included in this ARE section, where convenient.
The few exceptions are referenced to the specific section of the
report where more detailed information may be found.

The ANP research, in addition to that for the Aircraft Reactor
Experiment, falls into three general categories: (1) studies of
aircraft-size circulating-fuel reactors, (2) materials problems
associated with advanced reactor designs, and (3) studies of
shields for nuclear aircraft. These three phases of research are
covered in Parts I, II, and III, respectively, of this report.
 
INTRODUCTION

The experimental reactor has been
subject to some alteration primarily
because of a recently obtained higher
value for the reactor critical mass
(sec. 1). As a consequence of the
increase in critical mass, additional
U?3% has been requested, the fuel
volume external to the reactor has
been reduced, and some structural
poisons have been removed from the
core, Although the exact value of the
critical mass is still not known with
certainty, 1t is expected that the
now be able to *‘ go
critical” with the additional uranium
requested, This assurance was secured
at the expense of reactor power, that
is, the external system now has only
one-half the previous heat removal
capacity, Coincident with these
necessary changes, both the fuel and
the sodium systems were revised to
operate with only one pump, although
a second pump is available in each
system in the event of failure.
Vertical-shaft, sump-type, gas-sealed,
centrifugal pumps will be employed in
both systems because their reliability
is superior to that of either the
frozen-sodium-sealed pump for sodium
or the packed-sealed pump for fluorides,
Although about two months have been
required to make the changes brought
about by the increase in critical
mass, the attendant system changes
have greatly increased the reliability
of the system.

Valves, pumps, and
other components of high-temperature
fluoride and liquid-metal systems are
being developed (sec. 2). Pump seals
with packings of graphite, graphite
and metal wool, and graphite and
beryllium fluoride and various vitreous
seals and frozen seals have been
tested. Despite the concentration
of effort onpacked seals for fluoride
pumps, no such seal suitable for con-
tinuous remote operation has yet been

AND SUMMARY

devised. Several seals, however, have
operated in excess of 1000 hr with
leakage rates of less than 10 cm® per
day when it was possible to make periodic
inspection and adjustments. The
vertical-shaft, gas-sealed, sump-type
pump, on the other hand, has performed
satisfactorily without periodic serv-
ice. In anticipation of its need in
pumps and elsewhere, development of
high-temperature bearings amenable to
operation in fluorides has been
initiated. Suitable instrumentation
to indicate leaks in the sodium and the
fluoride systems has been developed.
Sodium can be detected by the change

in electrical resistance of the sodium-
contaminated insulation; the fluoride

can be detected by a phenol-red indi-
cator solution, Reliable fluid-flow
measurements can be made by using two
Moore pressure transmitters across a
venturi,

The reflector-moderated reactor
studies have been extended to include
a wider variety of such reactors, as
well as the performance and control
of such a power plant in a nuclear
aircraft (sec. 3). Because of the
importance of shield weights and sizes
to aircraft performance, several series
of reactor and shield designs were
made to determine the effects of reactor
power, reactor core diameter, and
division of the shield. In conjunction
with these studies, the activation of
various secondary coolants, including
sodium and potassium, was measured. On
the basis of the total weight of the
system, sodiumis superior to potassium
(natural lithium is better still),
although the activity of the potassium
was about 2 to 5% of that of the
sodium. An analysis of the power
plant system external to the reactor
was made for a 200,000~1b aircraft
with a 100- or 200-megawatt reflector-
moderated reactor and two or four
Wright turbojet engines. From this
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

study, 1t appears that the off-design,
as well as the normal performance and
control of these subsonic planes, is
satisfactory when four engines are
employed with chemical augmentation,
as required.

The critical experiment facility
has been used to determine the re-
lation between minimum critical mass
and uniform thermal-neutron flux
(sec. 4). The assembly used in this

investigation consisted of concentric
cylindrical aluminum shells filled
with varying concentrations of aqueous
uranyl fluoride solution. The experi-
mentally measured critical height and
mass based on the theoretically deter-
mined fuel loading were within 2%% of
the corresponding calculated parame-
ters, Other data obtained from the
assembly were also compatible with
the predictions.
PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1953

1. CIRCULATING-FUEL AIRCRAFT REACTOR EXPERIMENT

E. S. Bettis,

Developments during this quarter
required that the ARE be rather
drastically revised, It was found
that the critical mass of the reactor,
as well as the volume of the external
fuel system, was greater than the
corresponding value which had been
used in previous calculations and
design considerations. Because of
these findings, it was imperative that
not only the volume of the external
circuit and the amount of structural
poisons in the reactor be minimized
but also that additional uranium be
requested, The additional 46 kg
requested will bring the total allocated
for the experiment to 115 kg and should
provide an ample margin for con-
tingencies,

The changes in the critical mass of
the reactor and the volume of the
external system required a compensating
change in only the maximum reactor
power, which was halved as a result of
the removal of one-half the heat ex-
changers in the external fuel system.
Coincident with these changes,
desirable, and convenient, to make
other system changes, such as con-
version to the use of a single operat-
ing sump-~type gas-sealed pump in both

circuits and the use of frangible-disk

The uranium concentration of the
fuel has been increased, but the fuel
can still be taken from the NakF-ZrF, -
UF, system, and it will be compounded
by the addition of sufficient fuel
concentrate, Na, UF , to the fuel
solvent, NaZrF,, to make the reactor
critical. Production of the fuel
solvent has been completed; production
of the fuel concentrate has started.

The reactor core was studied in
considerable detail to determine
whether changes could be made in it to
lower the critical mass. A modifi-
in the sleeves around the rod
was made which reduced the
critical mass by about 5 pounds. The
critical mass is being calculated on
the UNIVAC, but the calculation 1s
probably good only to +10%, and thus
the exact critical mass will not

periment is made with the reactor.
However, with the changes in the
reactor and the external system and
the additional uranium, it is certain
that the critical mass can be attained.

ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

Calculation of Critical Mass (W. K.
Ergen, ANP Division). At the time the
previous quarterly report?) was
written, doubt had arisen concerning
the stated value of the critical mass
of the ARE. Since then, substantial
effort has been made to reduce this
uncertainty, and it appears now that
the critical mass of the ARE will be
about 30% higher than the previously(3)
quoted value.

The increase in the estimate for
the critical mass is greater than the
previously assumed probable un-
certainty. In the increase is
admittedly the result of error, but it
is due, in part, to uncertainties in
the basic data, For example, the age
in beryllium oxide is given by the AEC
Neutron Cross Section Advisory Group
with a probable uncertainty of 10%;
the absorption cross section of stain-
less steel, which plays an important
in the interpretation of the
critical experiment, may vary by 25%,

depending on the value that is used,
within the limits of the available
chemical analysis, for the content of
such elements as cadmium and boron;
the absorption cross section in uranium
1s still somewhat in dispute. Also,
the multigroup calculations in their
present form apply only to concentric,
homogeneous, spherical shells, and the
reactor is neither spherical nor made
up of homogeneous regions, The self-
shielding of the fuel tubes, the local
poisoning by the control rod sleeves,
the streaming through holes, etc.,
still have to be computed separately
by tedious methods, and the calcu-
lations require experimental validation,

Improved constants are now being

used in the UNIVAC calculations, In

Flow Characteristics im Fuel Tubes
(J. I. Lang, G. M, Winn, Reactor
Experimental Engineering Division).
From heat transfer and wall tempera-
ture limitations, it is important to
know at which Reynolds modulus the
flow within the ARE fuel tubes changes
from laminar to transitional and also
at what Reynolds modulus fully es-
tablished turbulent flow occurs. To
determine these characteristics, an
exact-scale fuel tube system con-
sisting of l-in. glass pipe was con-

tube was inserted into the first of
the many fuel tubes that make up the
fuel tube system to permit injection
of a methylene-blue dye. Static
pressure taps were located at the
inlet and outlet of the fuel tube
systems, A carbon tetrachloride
inclined manometer was used to measure
the pressure differences. The water
flow rates through the tube system
were measured by a rotameter and by
weighing. The flow phenomena of this
fuel tube system studied by
visual observation of the diffusion

EXTERNAL FUEL CIRCUITS

G. A. Christy
Engineering and Maintenance Division

G. D. Whitman

ANP Division
The largest single
uranium was effected by the elimination
of one of the two parallel heat ex-
changer loops. This decrease of almost
25% in the fuel
resulted in a decrease in reactor
temperature drop but not in the maximum
temperature. The total fuel circuit
volume, not including that for the

saving 1in

external volume
enriched fuel, is now below 5 ft? at
room temperature.

Before the revisions in design had
been made, the fuel circuit was gas
tested and hydraulically checked with
circulating water. The tests indi-
cated that the welds were good (inso-
far as such tests can reveal the
quality of the welds), but 1t was
found that some valves leaked because
of the adherence of filings, weld
droppings, etc. to the valve seat,
Although these valves, when subse
quently cleaned, proved to be tight,
the importance of a tight system has
led to the use of freeze valves and
frangible-disk valves in some locations.

The various packed or frozen seals
tested by the Experimental Engineering
Group proved to be unreliable, Conse-
quently, it was decided to change the
design to provide for incorporation of
the gas-sealed sump-type pump which
has been operated satisfactorily for
several hundred hours with fluorides
in the Experimental Engineering
Building. Although the frozen-sodium
seal for use in the reflector coolant
pumps has satisfactorily,
it was felt that these pumps should
also be changed to the gas-sealed sump
type to eliminate the hazard of a seal
failure which would permit a sodium
leak into the pit.

and the total power is correspondingly
reduced from 3 to 1.5 megawatts. Since
the ontlet fuel temperature is main-
tained at 1500°F, the inlet fuel
temperature and mean fuel temperature
are increased. The revised fuel
system arrangement is shown in Fig. 1,2.

Although one heat exchanger loop
has been completely removed from the
system, the duel pump system is being
retained, but with a different functional
arrangement, Formerly, two pumps ran
simultaneously, each pump delivering
half the total system flow. Now one
pump is used to supply full flow and
the other pump is to be used only as a
spare. The spare pump is 1solated
from the system by two frangible-disk
valves so that this pump with the
associated sump tank will be empty
until its use is desired. At
time, the liquid will be forced out of
the dead pump into the spare, the
pump will be isolated from the system
by freezing the liquid in the very
bottom of the sump tank of the dead
pump.

Since the valves cannot be depended
upon to give zero leakage, the fuel
system will be isolated from the fill
and flush tanks by means of freeze
valves that back up the mechanical
valves. As scon as the freeze valves
have been set by chilling,
cal valves will be opened and left in
the open position during the run, The
freeze valves will ensure that a
failure in the mechanical valve will
not make it impossible to dump the

system.

The old fuel system piping and all
components of one heat exchanger loop
have been removed. Some of the new
fuel piping configuration has been

fabricated into subassemblies, but 75%
of the installation remains to be
done. The new pump casings will not

be available until the latter part of
September 1953; so the fuel system
will not be ready for testing before
the middle of October,

though some packed seals are potentially
useful. At the same time and for the
same reason, it was decided to employ
the same gas-sealed pump in the sodium
system. Only one such pump will be
required in the fuel system and one in
the sodium systems, although a spare
pump will be provided in each system.

Gas-sealed pumps are limited to
operation with the shaft in a nearly
vertical position in order to maintain
gas above the liquid surface. This
type of pump has operated for several
thousands of hours in circulating
various fluoride mixtures at tempera-
tures of up to 1300°F. The pump has
not yet been tested with sodium, but
no difficulties are anticipated so
long as the gas seal is protected from
sodium vapor.

A gas-sealed pump, as required by
the ARE, has been fabricated and is
now being tested (for details of test

problems encountered involved the

valves. Both the 2-in, bellows
valves and the frangible-disk valves
are being tested for operation in the
fluorides at 1300°F, The bellows
valves installed in the ARE fuel
system leaked during preliminary tests
with water, but, when cleaned, they
operated satisfactorily in a fluoride
fuel at temperatures of up to 1200°F.
The frangible-disk valve is being
developed as an isolation unit between
the fuel loop and the components that
require positive sealing and only one
valve operation.

A 2-in., Fulton Sylphon, air-
operated, normally closed valve is
being tested for leakage and self-

welding with NaF-ZrF -UF, (50-46-4
mole %), This valve was originally
installed in the ARE fuel system and
leaked during the initial water
testing, as did several other valves.
After removal, the valve was cleaned
by water flushing, and the present
test was started. Thus far, the valve
has been operated in the fluoride
mixture for about 200 hr with a fluid
temperature of 1200°F and a differential
pressure of 30 psi without detectable
leakage. After being opened and closed
12 times, the valve was left in the
closed position for 150 hr to determine
whether self-welding between the plug
and seal might occur. At the end of
this time, the valve opened smoothly
without noticeable sticking, and it
reseated without leakage.

The temperature of the fluid in the
valve has been raised to 1300°F to
investigate self-welding of the valve
over the same time period. The unit
pressure between the sealing surfaces
is approximately 4000 psi. Another

composition of the fuel, as well as
the fuel concentrate (for loading),
has changed. The final fuel composition
will, of course, depend upon the
required critical mass,
concentrations as high as 7.5 mole %
UF, will be tolerable,

The preparation of nearly 3500 1b
of ARE fuel solvent (NaZrF,) was come
pleted during the quarter. This
material is, apparently, of higher
purity than any previously prepared.
Apparatus for preparation of the ARE
fuel concentrate, similar to that for

but uranium

preparation of the fuel solvent, has
been constructed and is being tested.
It is apparent that the preparation
me thod used will produce material of
satisfactory purity without excessive
reduction of the UF,.

Composition. The original estimates
indicated that the reactor would go
critical with about 4 mole % UF,, but
the latest critical mass estimate
indicates that about 6.5 mole % will
be required. This fuel concentration
can be obtained from within the NaF-
ZrF,-UF, system, but considerable
effort has been required to ascertain
not only that the physical properties
of the resulting fuel will be amenable
to reactor requirements but also that
the anticipated loading procedure of
the reactor will remain unaltered.
The contemplated loading procedure
requires the addition of an enriched-
uranium-bearing mixture to a non-
uranium-bearing mixture, in this case,
NaZrF,. The feasibility of this
loading procedure is dependent upon
the following three properties of the
fluorides: (1) the temperatures of
the carrier, the enriched fuel, and
all intermediate mixtures, (2) the
volume of the enriched fuel (since
only 1 1/2 ft3 of concentrate is
provided for in the design of the
system), and (3) no segregation of the
fuel during loading. These require-
ments apparently are best fulfilled if
the compound Na,UF, is employed as the
It is mixed with
the carrier, NaZrF,, in the quantity
required to make the reactor critical.
It 1s expected that the final compo-
sition of the fuel will be in the
neighborhood of 53.5-40,0-6,5 mole %
of NaF-ZrF, -UF,.

A phase diagram of the Na,UF,-
NaZrF, system is shown in Section 5,
“Chemistry of High Temperature Liquids.”
From the diagram, it may be seen that
the mixture with 6.5 mole % UF, has a
melting point of about 570°C. Should
higher fuel concentrations be necessary,
as much as 7.5 mole % UF, could be
obtained with melting temperatures of
less than 600°C. The new fuel con-
centrate Na,UF, melts at 650°C; there-
fore the loading system will have to
operate at somewhat higher temperatures.

Physical Properties. The physical
properties, the most important of which
are density and viscosity, of the fuel
concentrate and fuel composition with
6.5 mole % UF, are being measured. At
this time only the data on the NaF-
Zr¥,-UF, (53.5-40.0-6.5 mole %) fuel
composition are available. These are:
viscosity, 16 cp at 580°C, 5.7 cp

Fuel Solvent Production (G. J.
Nessle, C. B. Croft, J. Truitt, J. E.
Eorgan, C. M. Blood, R. E., Thoma,
Materials Chemistry Division). In a
period of five weeks of this quarter,
14 batches of approximately 250 1b
each of NaF-ZrF, (50-50 mole %) mixture
were prepared in the 9201-3 production
facility for ARE usage, There were no
failures in the material processing;
the material balance of the operation,
which involved a total of 1548.5 kg of
charge material, shows a deficit of
only 1.6 kg.

The first of the 14 batches was
prepared from high-hafnium-content
ZrF, as a trial run. One other batch
has been largely consumed in testing.
Accordingly, 2800 1b of material 1s

Table 1.1 presents the analytical data
received, to date, on individual
batches from the entire operation.
Spectrographic data, other than those
shown for the hafnium and boron con-
tent, are on record. These data
indicate a high degree of material
purity.

The operating procedure adopted and
used for the production of the ARE
fluoride batches is briefly the
following:

1. melt constituents under a hydrogen
fluoride atmosphere;

2. treat with hydrogen (1500°F) for
1 hr;

3. treat with hydrogen
(1500°F) for 1 1/2 hr;

4. hydrogen flush to an out-gas
sample reading of 1 x 10°* mole of
HF per liter of out-gas (1500°F);

5. transfer treated fluorides to
receiver can with helium (1500°F);

6. flush with helium until receiver
can has been disconnected and
removed after cooling to room

fluoride

temperature;

7. place receiver can containing ARE
fluorides on helium header system
under positive helium pressure of
5 1b for storage until needed.
All process equipment and lines

exposed to the fluorides or heat were

fabricated of nickel metal.

The final hydrogen flushing process
has two purposes: (1) to flush out
the excess hydrogen fluoride left
from the hydrogen fluoride treatment
and (2)

metal content of the processed fluorides

to reduce the contaminating

by reducing the respective fluorides,
NiF,, FeF,, and CrF,, to base metals,
These metals seem to deposit on the
walls of the reactor vessel or are
filtered out during the transfer step.
Flushing with hydrogen to an out-
gas reading of 1 x 107% mole of HF per
liter of out-gas was set as apractical
limit for removing the metallic
impurities introduced or contained in

anticipated that the production of the
fuel concentrate will begin during the
second week in September, and it should
be completed about November 1, Since
the Production Group prefers to load
the enriched fuel storage tank at the
ARE Building rather than at Building
9212, the storage tank will be available
for a check run on the loading procedure
for using fuel solvent material.

The process which was effective in
removing oxidizing impurities during
manufacture of NaZrF, has been studied
on 3-kg batches of Na,UF,. Recause of
the high concentration of UF, in this
material, it was suspected that the
long treatment with hydrogen might
cause formation of UF; to an un-
desirable extent. However, no evidence
that the process would require modifi-
cation has been discovered,

Corrosion of Inconel. The corrosion
of Inconel by fluoride fuels has been
discussed at length in this (sec. 6,
“Corrosion Research’) and preceding
quarterly reports. In loop tests in
which the fluoride is circulated at
about 4 fpm by thermal convection, the
maximum depth of attack by the pure
fluoride 1s about 10 mils in 500 hr at
1500°F. Not only does the rate of

17
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

attack diminish with time (so that at
1000 hr it is an additional 2 mils),
but also the initial corrosion rate
may be decreased by the addition of
zirconium hydride which effectively
reduces structural metal impurities,
Consequently, zirconium hydride will
be added to the ABE fuel to the extent
of about 0,1 wt % - the amount found
adequate to reduce such impurities as
are always found in the purified fuel.

Since the fuel tubes in the reactor
are 60 mils thick, corrosion rates are
quite compatible with the maximum
anticipated reactor operating time,
1000 hr, which includes preliminary
tests with the fuel solvent. It 1s
recognized, with some apprehension,
that there has been no corrosion test
at both ARE flow velocity (~4 fps) and
temperature drop (now 175°F)., For the
report of the investigation of the
effect of various parameters on cor-
rosion in the fluoride-Inconel system,
as well as the postulated mechanism,

INSTRUMENTATION
R. G. Affel, ANP Division

Nothing of significance remains to
be done on instrumentation, except for
the refinement of the leak-detection
system. The control room has been
checked out and all instrumentation is
ready for use, with a few very minor
exceptions. A change is being made in
the humidity indicator for the pit
atmosphere, Because of the alterations
in the fuel circuit, some changes were
required in a few of the instruments;
several of the instruments are no
longer required for the experiment.

The fuel leak detector consists of
a bath of a neutral phenol-red indi-

cator solution through which the
helium from the fuel annulus 1s
bubbled. A fuel leak, which would

cause hydrogen fluoride to be formed,

turns the indicator solution to

yellow, The sodium leak, on the other
hand, is detected by a decrease in the
electrical resistance of sodium-
contaminated insulation. Both systems
have been checked out in principle by
a series of experiments, and they have
proved to be satisfactory (cf., sec 2,

“Experimental Engineering”).

2. EXPERIMENTAL REACTOR ENGINEERING
H. W. Savage, ANP Division

During this quarter, primary
emphasis has been placed on the
problem of sealing the ARE fuel pump;
a decision has been to use
vertical -shaft, gas-sealed, sump pumps.
This type of pump was selected after
the completion of tests of a number of
horizontal-shaft packings, including
graphite, graphite and metal-wool
combinations, graphite and BeF,, and
fluorides containing BeF,, as sealing
molten fluorides.
Frozen-fluoride seals for horizontal
shafts were also tried. Several of
the packings tested sealed sufficiently
well for periods in excess of 1000 hr
to be reliable enough (leakage of less
than 10 c¢m® per day) for an ordinary
industrial application where periodic
or as-needed inspection could be made.

needed inspections could not be made
and observations of operation would be
dependent upon instrumentation.
Ultimately, a satisfactory packed-
sealed pump may be found, but the
propsects of findingit in the immediate

future are not encouraging.

The gas-sealed, vertical-shaft,
sump pump for the ARF, on the other
hand, has performed well. The only
difficulties found to date are as -
sociated with minor design features
that readily corrected to
provide proper fitting of parts and
to take into account thermal expansion,

ARE are designed to accommodate fuel
thermal expansion and contraction and,
to accept the enriched fuel
additive without loss of pump prime or

Because this pump 1s more reliable
than the frozen-sodium-sealed pump, it
is also planned to provide such pumps
for the sodium moderator-coolant
circuit of the ARE. As reported
previously, the frozen-sodium-sealed
pump consumes an excessive amount of
power in friction and does have some
intermittent leakage. While the

been found to be necessary with the
5 13/16-in.-long seal previously
tested if low leakage were to be
obtained at low powers. The new,
short, sealing gland was mounted on
the 2 1/2-in.-dia shaft with a 0.015-
in. radial clearance between the
shaft and the gland. With the helium
chamber for ‘“backing-up” the seal,
it is possible to reduce the pressure
stress on the seal from 50 to 5 psi,
or less. The helium chamber is
sealed from the atmosphere by a rubber
O-ring seal.

A model FP pump, complete except
for the impeller, bas been run to test
the characteristics of a 1/2-in.-long
sealing gland. The results obtained
to date indicate that this seal re-~
quires 1/2 to 3/4 hp at 1700 rpm with
75°F water as the coolant. This is
about one-tenth the power required for
the 5 13/16-in.-long gland under
similar conditions. A stable, pre-
dictable leak rate has not yet been
determined. Leak rates in excess of
100 cm® per day and as low as zero
have been observed. The average leak
rate for 960 hr of operation with a
speed of 1700 rpm and a seal pressure
differential of 5 psia is 40 cm®per
day. A characteristic of the short
seal being tested 1s a tendency for
leakage rates to increase once any
appreciable leakage occurs. Leak-
free operation for periods as long as
eight days has occurred, but periods
of operation with high leak rates have
followed. Upon removal of the leakage,
another period of leak-free operation
usually follows.

The power and leakage charac-
teristics of the 5 13/16-in.-long seal
could be described as analogous to
those of a viscous film model, as
reported previously, but this has not
been possible for the 1/2-in.,-long
seal running under a 5-psi pressure
differential. A re-evaluation of the
sealing mechanism, along with an
analysis of test results, suggests

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1953

that wetting or nonwetting of the
shaft by seal sodium is an important
factor for the short seal. Since
wetting is essentially an end effect,
it would be considerably less important
for a long seal operating under a
50-psi pressure differential. This is
a likely explanation for reasonable
success of the viscous film model in
predicting performance of the longer
seal.

Gas-Sealed Sump Pump for the ARE.
The gas-sealed sump-type pump described
and 1llustrated in the previous
report?) has been fabricated and
partially tested. This pump requires
a vertical shaft to maintain a liquid-
gas interface, and only a gasseal is
necessary. In addition, the sump tank
for the pump suction bell serves as
an expansion and degassing tank for
the system fluid. The construction of
the pump and test loop was completed
in June, and test runs with NaF-ZrF,-UF,
(50-46-4 mole %) were started promptly.
The pump has now operated a total of
546 hr, 410 hr at temperatures between
1200 and 1300°F and 136 hr at tempera-
tures between 1450 and 1500°F,

Pump operation during this testing
period was suspended on three occasions.
However, inspection of the hardened-
tool-steel vs.
graphite gas seal, after each of the
three terminations, revealed good
sealing surfaces. A dry, hot, shake-
down run was terminated when noise
indicated that the shaft was rubbing
against a stationary surface. The
pump was reworked so that the clearance
between the labyrinth seal and the
shaft was increased from approximately
0.010 in. on the diameter to approxi-
mately 0.040 inch.

The second termination,
high-temperature test with the fluoride
fuel, was to permit investigation of
power pulses of 200 to 400 watts
superimposed on the normal power

were found clinging to heat radiation

This layer of frozen fluorides was

fashion over an of about 120

in this region was due to accidental

the liquid level was lowered to 1 in.

The excellent performance of these
pumps to date has resulted in their
selection for use in the Aircraft
Heactor Experiment, not only in the
fluoride system but also in the sodium
(moderator-coolant) system.

Combination Packed-Frozen Scaled
Pump for Fluorides. Three different
packed-frozen seals were tested on the
ARE-size fluoride pump described
previously. (®) The first seal was
made up of alternate layers of silicon-
bronze wool and graphite powder, the
second contained a 1:1 mixture of BeF,
and graphite powder fused in place
under temperature and pressure, and
the third was composed of NaBelF; powder
in small annular cavities between
close-fitting machined rings placed
around the shaft. An
maintained on

inert gas was
the frozen end of the
seal, and a water-cooling sleeve was
added.

The first seal operated for a
period of 160 hr in

circulating

NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %). The
fluid temperature was 1250°F, the
shaft speed was 1250 rpm, the flow

rate was 50 gpm, the developed head
was 50 psi, and the motor power was
5.7 kw, Heat removed by the water was
5000 Btu/hr. The estimated power
absorbed in the seal was 0.8 hp, while
the average leakage rate was 100 g per
day. The test was terminated because
of excessive leakage. Startup was
very difficult with the second seal,
and excessive heating was required to
begin shaft rotation. Gross leakage
occurred when the pump loop was filled
with the circulating fluid. The third
seal arrangement was inoperable be-
cause the closely fitting metal rings
seized the pump shaft during initial
dry runs.

The work on beryllium-type seals
has been discontinued, and the pump

is now being assembled with a short
(1/4-in.-long) frozen-fluoride seal
with no packing.

Frozen-Lead-Sealed Pump for Fliuo-
rides. An ARE size pump was modified
to incorporate the frozen-lead seal
described previously.(3®) A lead-
fluoride interface is maintained within
the pump, and the seal is on the
bottom side of the pump in the denser
lead. A test of a pump with this seal
was terminated after 120 hr of opera-
tion when it was found that lead from
the seal reservoir had been carried
out into the loop. A combination of
the mixing action of the rotating shaft
at the lead-fluoride interface and of
the high rate of fuel circulation over
this region because of the drilled
impeller seems to have caused this
Jead trans fer.

Operation of the seal appears to
have been satisfactory; the power in-
put to the seal is low and it is
relatively insensitive to speed and
pressure changes. Ten stop-start
tests that ranged in duration from
1 min to 1 1/2 hr were made during
the run.

A subsequent test with a 2 1/2-
in.-dia shaft rotating in a pot con-
taining both lead and fluorides at
1200°F showed that the fluorides con-
tained approximately 5% lead during
operation and that the lead immediately
settled to the bottom when shaft
rotation ceased. The mixing during
operation makes this type of seal
impractical for sealing a fluoride
pump.

Allis-Chalmers Canned-Rotor Pump.
The Allis-Chalmers canned-rotor pump
described previously?) was operated
with NaK at a maximum temperature of
1085°F. Difficulty was encountered
with the impeller binding against the
pump housing at temperatures above
1000°F. Also, the coolant passages
through the motor windings showed a
tendency to plug during prolonged
operation. This plugging was caused

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1953

by deposits of zinc transported from
the galvanized pipe in the distilled-
water coolant circuit. Replacement of
the galvanized pipe with copper pipe
apparently corrected this condition.

Pump performance data were taken
at various temperatures. The data in
Table 2.1, which were taken at 800°F,
are typical. Several attempts to
operate the pump at temperatures
substantially above 1000°F resulted
in mechanical binding; therefore the
pump was returned to Allis-Chalmers,
at their request, for modifications
to eliminate the binding.

operate smoothly until the test was
terminated at the end of 1652 hr to

were much the same as those in the

Another test, similar to the above,
is being made with a cooling coil
added to the seal and packing of 1/4-
in. layers of bronze wool sandwiched
between 1/4-in. layers of powdered
Asbury graphite, This test was first
operated for 242 hr with the shaft in
a vertical position, then with the shaft
in a horizontal position. This change
from vertical to horizontal operation
was made without disturbing the seal.
There is no apparent difference in
operation in these two positions.
While the shaft was operated in the
vertical position, the average leakage
rate of fuel from the seal was as great
as 2.3 cm® per day, but for most of
the time, the leakage was less than
1 cm® per day. The test was made at
shaft speeds from 800 to 1400 rpm to
seal fuel against a pressure of 10

psi at 1175°F.

The average leakage rateof the fuel
from the seal in the horizontal test
has been about 7.5 c¢m® per day, but
the test operated for a considerable
time with leakage rates of less than
1 cm? per day. To date, the seal has
operated for 1000 hr in the horizontal
position. There have been power
fluctuations in both positions of as
much as 500 watts, but, at times, the
power requirement was constant for
periods of up to 12 hours.

Copper-Braid and MoS ,-Packed Seal
Test. A packed seal employing copper
braid lubricated with MoS, has been
tested with NaF-ZrF, -UF, (50-46-4 mole
%) under the following conditions:
fuel temperature, 1250°F; shaft speed,
2000 to 2800 rpm; shaft diameter,
1 3/16 in.; shaft material, Stellite
No, 6 (coated); L/D ratio, 4.2; power
to seal, 0.1 to 0.35 kw. This test
terminated after 1000 hr of
operation. Fower surges to the seal
became large during the later stages
of the test. Postrun examination
showed severe weldingor galling of the
copper to the Stellite shaft surface,

and, in addition, the usual scoring
of the seal region was quite severe.

Frozen-Lead Seal. The second lead
seal test has operated for 2100 hours.
The equipment for this test differed
from that for the initial lead seal
test’? in that a relatively short
(approximately 1/2 in.) frozen seal
was obtained by providing water cooling,
and an inert atmosphere was maintained
over the open end of the seal. The
lead used in this test was 99.49% pure,
and 1t was hydrogenated before it was
loaded into the equipment. The shaft
used for this test was 1 3/16 in. in
diameter, the shaft material was type
316 stainless steel, the shaft speed
was 1000 to 4000 rpm, and the power to
the seal was 0.04 to 0.20 kw.

Vitreous Seals. Seven tests of
the use of a vitreous substance, such

For the first vitreous seal test
made during this quarter (number 8 in

1 3/16-in.-dia shaft was divided into
fifteen 3/16-by 3/16-in. compartments,
and each compartment was packed with
granular NaBeF, which had passed a
Tyler 8-mesh screen. The test was
started with the shaft in the vertical
position, but, after a short period,
the test rig was rotated to place the
shaft in a horizontal position. The
shaft seal operated satisfactorily for

because of leakage at a flange joint
that was independent of the seal. The
shaft surface speed was held at approxi-
mately 930 fpm during the test to
simulate operation of the ARE pump
shaft. A seal leakage of not more
than 4 cm® of dry powder per day
occurred from the fifthto the fifteenth
day of the test. During the remainder
of the test the leakage was zero. The
friction power loss at the seal was
less than 200 watts during most of the
test; there were, however, intermittent
power surges of greater magnitude,
The seal temperature ranged from 100°F
at the cold end to 1000°F at the hot
end.

The second vitreous seal tested
(number 9 of the series) employed a
2 1/2-in.-dia shaft with the seal
annulus that contained five seal com-
partments filled with a vitreous
precast ring of a mixture of fluorides
(by weight: BeF,, 50%; KF, 25%; MgF,,
16%; AlF,, 9%). This mixture of
fluorides was chosen because of its
high viscosity over a wide temperature
range. The mixture was hydrofluorinated
to remove all moisture and oxides and
then mixed with an equal weight of BeF,
and cast (under an argon blanket) into
the packing rings with which the seal
was packed.

The seal operated successfully for
46 hr with zero leakage, but the test
was terminated when a heater failed.
Examination revealed that the heater
failed when it was contacted by molten
fluorides which leaked from a flange
joint that was not part of the seal
region. During most of the successful
run, the friction power dissipated at
the seal was about 1000 watts. The
seal temperature ranged from 300°F at
the cold end to 1000°F at the hot end.

Graphite has been used as one of the
sealing elements in much of the work

characteristics of graphite which has
prompted its continued use is its
apparent resistance to wetting by the
fluoride fuel. However, all the
packed and ring types of seals tested
have had one of the sealing elements,
usually the shaft, made of Stellite,
This provided a wetted surface for the
passage of the fuel. Thus the real
significance of the nonwetting charac-
teristic of the graphite on seal
performance was masked by other
variables,

In an effort to ascertain the
importance of the nonwetting property
of graphite, a 1 3/16-in.~dia shaft
seal was designed which employed solid
Graphitar 14 shaft bushings running
against similar bushings in the seal
housing. The seal housing was provided
with heaters and a cooling medium. Tt
was then possible, by varying the
temperature difference between the
shaft and housing, the
running clearance seal to a
small degree.

The seal was operated for 195 1/2 hr
under pressure differentials of up to
10 psi with the seal temperature above
the fuel melting point. The power
required was very low and steady, and
the maximum leakage rate observed was
4 g per day. During two successful
stop-start tests that were made it
was found that the seal temperature
should be maintained above the fuel
melting point.

to control
of the

Disassembly and inspection revealed
that (1) the Graphitar 14 wear was
slight (small amount of cracking
noted), (2) the clearance between the
Graphitar 14 and the adjacent stationary
metal surfacewas filled with fluoride,
and smaller amounts of fluoride were
retained between the mating Graphitar
rings, and (3) mountingof the Graphitar
14 had been accomplished without
excessive crackingat high temperature.

In summary, these results confirm
the usefulness of the nonwetting
property of graphite in seal design.

Packing-Penetration Tests. Several
additional?’ packing-penetration
tests were made this quarter; the
results are summarized in Table 2.3.
Test 16, which employed a mixture of
graphite and BeF, and was reported
previously(®) as ‘still running,’ was
terminated after 736 hr of operation
with no leakage. Upon examination,
there appeared to be no penetration
of the packing by the fuel and no
oxidation of the graphite at the lower
opening where the packing material was
exposed to the atmosphere.

Five of the tests reported this
quarter contained artificial graphite,
One of the most promising graphites
yet tested is Asbury graphite 805.
The test with this material ran for
1660 hr and terminated with no
leakage. Examination showed that there
was no penetration by the fuel and
very little oxidation of the graphite.

test was first run with only BaF, as
the packing material. This packing
leaked immediately, and the test
showed that the BaF, was soluble in
the fuel. A subsequent test with a
mixture of 10% BaF, and 90% Asbury
graphite B05 has been running for 550
hr with no leakage.

In future work contemplated by the

ANP Division, there will be need for
a journal bearing that is suitable for
operation in a fluoride fuel and that
can be lubricated by the fuel. The
expected applications will impose low
radial bearing loads, but the operating
temperature will be in the range of
1100 to 1500°F. Except for the problem
of material selection, the design of
the hearing 1s expected to be more or
less routine. The phase of the program
now being started involves a study of
the compatibility of various material

attack by NaF-ZrF, -UF, (50-46-4 mole

implies the ability of bearing materials
to move relative to each other while
in contact under load in the fluoride
without excessive wear or corrosion
and without galling or seizing. A com-
patibility tester is being fabricated,
and it will be used to screen from a
large group of material combinations
those materials which have good com-
patibility and merit further exami-
nation. This phase of the program
will probably include tests on the
mechanical face seal, which equally
necessitates knowledge of compati-

Fluoride Leak Detection. A test
which simulated a small leak from an
ARE fluoride fuel pipe into the helium
annulus surrounding it was conducted
at 1250°F with NaF-ZrF, -UF, (50-46-4
mole %). With a gas flow of 4 cfh
(80% He, 20% air) passing through the
annulus and out into a sight feed
bubbler containing a neutral phenol-
red indicator solution, approximately
0.5 in.> of fluoride was expelled into
the annulus. The resulting hydrogen
fluoride rapidly changed the color
of the indicator solution to yellow.

Another test was run with dry air
instead of with helium in the annulus,
and the total gas flow (80% dry air,
20% air) was increased to 50 cfh. Only
a fraction of the gas passing through
the annulus section was exhausted
through the bubbler. When the fuel
was expelled into the annulus, the
indicator solution turned yellow, as
in the previous test.

The tests indicate that this leak
detection system may be used in the
ARE fuel system. In both cases, the

stainless steel sheet stock with a
f-volt battery. The resistance of the
circuit was then tabulated against
temperature as heat was added to the
sodium. When the sodium temperature
was increased to 850°F, the resistance
of the circuit increased. At this
point, the ohmmeter showed a drop in
resistance because sodium vapor began
to contaminate the spun and
therefore to decrease its electrical
resistance.

Av 1200°F the apparatus was tilted
and liquid sodium was forced through
the leak. The lamp filament was
energized immediately and the re-

glass

sistance reading dropped to zero. This
test was performed with the sodium
leaking througha 0.125-in.-dia opening

and a 0.028-1in.-dia opening. In each

 

 

case, the same results were obtained.

This method would work well for a
small system with perhaps 10 to 20
welds, but for a larger system, such
as the ARE, the wiring and instrumenta-
tion would be complicated and diffi-
cult.

Flow Measurement. Venturi meters
used in conjunction with Mecore Nullmatic
pressure transmitters have been demon-
strated as being reliable for measuring
flows of high-temperature fluids. The
outputs from the two Moore trans-
mitters that measure the venturi AP
are fed into a differential pressure
transmitter. The output gage of this
transmitter is calibrated to read flow
directly in gpm. Such a system has
been used successfully for about 550
hr on a pump loop to measure flows
of up to 67 gpm. The pressure trans-
mitters, rated 0 to 100 psi, are
attached to the underside of the
venturi section and filled completely
with liguid to avoid a
interface.

The pressure-sensitive
element in the transmitters is a 3-ply
Inconel bellows. The temperature of
the transmitters 1s maintained at

starting.

The null-balance transmitters are
accurate as long as the zero setting
remains fixed. When the transmitters
are initially heated to 1100°F, there
is a substantial zero shift that can
easily be adjusted. Subsequent zero
shifts are probably caused by sudden
decreases in applied pressure. Because
of the balancing pressure on the inside
of the bellows and the reduced spring
rate at the high temperature, the
bellows 1s often stretched beyond its
limit. This permanent set
causes a zero shift. Although its
occurrence is unpredictable, such a
zero shift can readily be corrected
when the applied pressure is brought
to zero. When the temperature 1s
maintained constant at 1100°F and
sudden pressure changes are elimi-
nated, the Moore pressure transmitters
can be expected to give accurate and
dependable service.

Early in 1953, the Air Force re-
quested that designs be prepared for
100-, 300-, and 600-megawatt reflector-
moderated? reactors for evaluation.
Since the outstanding uncertainty was
that of shield weight, it was decided
to outline a still wider range of
reactor and shield designs to provide
a fairly clear picture of the impli-
cations of variations in such factors
as reactor power density, core diameter,
design power output, etc. At the same
time, further test data were obtained
on the relative activation of several
secondary circuit fluids, and the
effects of using them instead of Nak
were examined, The power plant system
outside the reactor shield was also
given further attention to produce a
more detailed picture of problems in
performance and control.

Activation of Rubidium, Potassium,
and Sodium. A limiting factor in the
degree to which a unit shield may be
approached is the gamma dose from the
secondary coolant outside the main

gamma shield, In an effort to determine

the extent to which this gamma dose
might be reduced, several tests were
run in which fluoride salts of three

of the alkali metals, sodium, potassium,
and rubidium, were irradiated and
their relative activations determined,
These data are reported in detail in a
separate report, (*) From the basic
data, gamma doses for potassium and
rubidium relative to sodium were
calculated for a variety of irradi-
ation times, decay times, and lead
shield thicknesses. In general, the
results indicate that potassium is far

superior to sodium, the relative gamma
dose from potassium being from 1 to 5%
of that for
combination of conditions, These data
are shown in Fig. 3.6. For rubidium,
on the other hand, the dose relative
to sodium depends strongly on the
combination of conditions considered;
the dose ratio ranges from about 10:1

from sodium almost an
y

for short irradiation and decay times
and no shielding to about 0.002:1 for
moderate irradiation and decay times
and heavy shielding. No tests were
run with lithium, but previous work
indicates that 1ts activity would be
of the order of 0.1% of that of sodium.
Unfortunately, there 1s, as yet, no
suitable metal available to contain
lithium in the temperature range of
interest,

Effect of Secondary Coolant on
Power Plant Weight. The effect of the
secondary coolant on the over-all
power plant weight is an important
consideration, Although many bases
for comparison can be used, it appeared
that a good indication would be ob-
tained by modifying the 200-megawatt
power plant previously described(!)
to maintain the and
temperature drops with all coolants
considered, that is, sodium, potassium,
and natural lithium. The resulting
effects of the choice of a secondary
fluid are given in Table 3.5 in terms
of the weight increase or decrease
relative to the original design for
use with NaK. The lower specific heat
and the lower density of potassium
require larger lines, larger tubes in
the heat exchanger,
greater pumping power, etc., and hence

same pressure

intermediate

potassium requires a heavier system.
The detailed character of the effects
is shown more clearly by the data in
Table 3.6, which lists the physical
properties and related parameters of
the alkali metals considered for
operation at a mean temperature of

700°C.

(56% Na, 44% K) pumped in a closed
loop through the heat exchanger and
through NaK-to-air radiators located
in the engines between the compressor
and the turbine, The NaK would be
pumped by a variable-speed bleed-air
turbine, and the control of the bleed
air might serve as the primary control
of the system.

A variable area would also
be provided on the engines. The bleed
air required to pump the fuel and the
NaK was determined to be from 1 to 2%
of the total engine air flow at full
power,

For full power operation,

of the nozzle area could be coupled to

a governor in such a way that the
engine rpm would be kept constant,
This would give close to maximum

and thus
maximum thrust, To reduce power, the
bleed air to the NaK-pump drive
turbines could be throttled to reduce
the NaK flow rate and, in turn, the
quantity of heat transported by the
Nak. In addition, the automatic
nozzle area control could be bypassed
for any throttle setting below full
power. Since the turbojet nozzle area
could be the full
position (for the operating speed and
altitude), the engine rpm would be
reduced as the throttle for the pump

feature was found to he necessary
because, if constant turbojet rpm

were maintained, the temperature of
the NaK returning to the intermediate
heat exchanger might be below the
freezing point of the fuel for operation
below about 85% power.

Jt is expected that the negative
temperature coefficient of reactivity
of the fluoride fuel in the core will
be sufficiently high to maintain the
mean temperature of the core at a
constant value and to maintain the
effective multiplication constant at
1.00, regardless of the power demand
on the reactor.

The principal parameters that were
used in the calculations of the system
are given in the following:

Air flow rate per engine (at sea-
level static, which was estab-

lished as the design point) 220 1b/sec
NaK flow rate for full power per

engine 480 1b/sec
NaK-to-air radiator heat transfer 2

Minimum fuel temperature 1190°F
Maximum NaK temperature 1500°F
Minimum full-power NaK tempera- o

ture 1100°F
Compression ratio of the main

engine compressor 4:1

It should be emphasized that all
these parameters, and others, are
completely interrelated and that a
change in one parameter would, in all
probability, change all the others.
All values must be considered as
preliminary because the fluoride fuel

characteristics (specific heat,
thermal conductivity, etc.) of the
fuel, The heat transfer characteristics

of all heat exchangers are preliminary
because these units are being improved.
The flow characteristics of the fuel
channels are currently being studied.
It 1s believed, however, that this
study does outline fairly well the
control and performance characteristics
of the system,

The characteristics of the entire
system were found to depend heavily
upon the characteristics of the NaK-
to-air radiator. The radiator assumed

fuel temperatures, the assumed specific
heat, and the full-power reactor out-
put, It was assumed that the fuel
flow rate should be maintained constant
under all operating conditions, With
these parameters, the NaK-to-air
radiator heat transfer area required
to transfer the full power output of
the reactor was calculated for sea-
level static conditions. If the
design point were chosen at a high
altitude, a smaller heat transfer area
would be required, but sea-level per-
formance would be drastically reduced,
If the design point were chosen at
a high sea-level speed, the heat
transfer area (and weight) would be
increased and the thrust per pound of
power plant weight would be reduced.

In the course of the investigation,
that a reduced NaK flow
rate reduced the size of the inter-
mediate heat exchanger and the total
power plant weight without an apprecia-

it was found

ble increase in the NaK-to-air radiator
size or the pressure drop in the fuel
system. However, the optimization was
not completed, and the initially
assumed NaK flow rate was retained.
BPesign Performance. With the
parameters established above, the
performance of the power plant at
various speeds and altitudes is as
shown in Fig. 3.8. The solid lines
are the performance at the speeds and

calculations were applied to a typical

The performance of the aircraft
with a 100-megawatt reactor and two
combinations of nuclear and chemical
power at sea level is given in Fig.
3.9. Top speed could probably be
improved in both cases with a cleaner
aerodynamic design than that possible
for a sea plane, The arrangement with
two nuclear-powered engines and two
chemically powered engines gives better
performance than that with only two
nuclear engines, even with chemical
The arrangement having
two chemically augmented nuclear-
powered engines was not considered as
practical because of the low take-off
thrust and rate of climb indicated.
Fuel consumption was very high because

that might arise in the system, ex-
ternal to the reactor, and affect the
reactivity. In circulating-fuel
reactors, the only way that such
perturbations can affect the reactor
is through changes in the temperature
of the fluid entering the core. The
salient point with regard to reactor
stability and control is the rate at
which these changes may occur, If
such changes take place very rapidly,
that is, inp time intervals of the
order of 1 sec or less, they might
conceivably cause serious power oscil-
lations and temperature overshoots.
Core inlet temperature changes may
take place as a result of changes in
control settings and operating con-
ditions, or they may result from such
accidents as pump or engine failures.
In any case, the rates of change will
depend upon the properties of the
system, that is, the thermal capacities,

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1953

transit times, etc, Although this
analysis was for a particular power
plant, the results should be typical.

Since no large amount of heat would
be added to the system (except in the
case of a very severe fire), an abrupt
and substantial {fluid temperature
change could come about only through
changes in either the rate of power
or in the rate of heat
removal. For a circulating-fluoride-
fuel reactor with the type of secondary
circuit envisioned, a change in the
rate of power generation could come
about only as a result of a change in
the rate of heat removal; hence, the
rate of heat rejection to the air
flowing through the turbojet engine
radiators is critical, and will, in
turn, depend upon the engine air flow
the NaK temperature, and the Nak
flow rate through the radiators,

The engine air flow rate will depend
mainly upon the engine rpm and the
airplane altitude and speed. Variations
in engine air flow with changes in
aircraft altitude and speed will take
place at relatively low rates and, hence

generation

rate,

are not of serious consequence so far
as the fast response of the system is
concerned, Variations
flow caused by changes in engine rpm
will be only moderately rapid; ac-
celeration from idling at 40% rated
speed to rated speed would require
from 5 to 10 sec because of the high
inertia of the rotor assembly. Since
the air flow will be directly pro-
portional to the engine speed, the
change in heat rejection rate will be
from not less than 8 to 50 megawatts
per engine in from 5 to 10 seconds.

The heat input te the air flowing

in engine air

through the engine under idling con-
ditions will depend upon the method of
engine control, The method chosen in
this particular study was to vary both
the jet nozzle area and the NaK pump
speed, Other means of control were
considered, including varying the
amount of air allowed to bypass the

45
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

radiators or, similarly,
part of the NaK flow to bypass
radiators,

allowing a
the
If only the jet nozzle
area were varied, the engine heat
consumption under idling conditions
might be as much as 50% of the full-
power heat consumption. Tt is unlikely
that this method of control would be
used alone, however, because 1t would
be very difficult to maintain full Nak
pump speed at low turbojet engine rpm
with the air-bleed turbine type of
pump drive that seems most promising.

There does not appear to be any
way in which step changes in the
temperature of the circulating fuel
entering the
effected, accidentally or
deliberately. Even if, in some manner,
a step change could be introduced into
either the air stream entering the Nak
radiator or the NaK circuit, the
transit times through the radiator and
the heat exchanger, the heat capacities,
and the time lags in the lines from
the radiator to the heat exchanger and
from the heat exchanger to the core
would most certainly cause the step
change to be “ramped out’ over a period
of the order of tenths of a second or
longer,

changer is reduced, the fuel tempera-

drastic because without the engines
operating it would not be possible to
remove the tremendous heat generated
in the core. Even though the
creased fuel temperature in the core

in-

caused the power to drop radically,
to the extent of shutting down
the reactor, a large source of after-
heat from the fission-product decay
activity would still remain. In such
a situation, there would be no facilities
for heat removal other than the heat
capacities of the components, and, in
a relatively short time, the vessel
containing the fuel would melt.
However, circumstances in which all
four engines might fail simultaneously
are exceedingly rare and would probably
result in the loss of the aircraft.

The relationship between minimum
critical mass and uniform thermal-
neutron core flux has been experimen-
tally investigated for a water-moderated
water-reflected nuclear reactor
employing U?3® as fuel. The reactor
vessel assumed was a right-circular
cylinder of aluminum 72 cm in diameter
and 91.4 cm long. The core, 30.2 cm
in diameter, was divided into five
concentric regions by alumipum parti-
tions and was surrounded by an ef-
fectively infinite water reflector on
its lateral surface only. The aluminum
matrix of the reactor 1s pictured in
Fig. 4.1. Aqueous uranyl fluoride
solution, made from uranium containing
93.2% of the U?3%® isotope, was added
in various concentrations to the several
regions to simulate a theoretical fuel
distribution having a continuous con-
centration gradient. This theoretical
fuel distribution is that given by a
calculation method developed in an
analytical treatment of the problem by
Goertzel, (1? who demonstrated mathe-
matically that the condition of minimum
critical mass in a suitably chosen
thermal reactor required that the
thermal-neutron flux be uniform in the
fuel-containing region.

CRITICAL MASS

The experimentallymeasured critical
height and mass for the theoretically
determined fuel loading were within
2.5% of the corresponding calculated
parameters: These results, given in
Table 4.1, clearly establish the
validity of the Goertzel theory.

The concentrations of the solutions
in the fuel regions were then altered
slightly to establish the critical
height at its predicted value, 41.6

critical mass to 1055 g of U?3%, The
results, both experimental and calcu-
lated, are compared in Table 4.2 with
the corresponding masses obtained with
the uranium uniformly distributed
throughout a core of the same length
and diameter.

The critical mass for the Goertzel
loading was about 9% less than that
for a uniformly loaded reactor of
identical dimensions. This measured
difference is less than that calcu-
lated from a modified variational
solution of the critical equation in
integral form by usinga constant trial
function. Experience has shown that
results obtained by this method are
about 8% too high when applied to
uniformly loaded reactors. An adjust-
ment of this magnitude in the above
data would bring the values
satisfactory agreement.

Approximately 96% of the fissions were
caused by neutrons with energies below
the 0.02-in.-thick cadmium cut-off

pected because the hydrogen molecule
density of the fuel was about 99% of
that of water. In general, data
obtained from the experimental reactor
were compatible with the postulates
and predictions of the Goertzel theory.

IMPORTANCE FUNCTION

The importance function of the U?35
in the minimum-mass reactor was measured
by adding an increment of fuel to a
localized volume in each of the five
concentric fuel regions and by noting
in each instance its effect on the
over-all reactivity of the system.
This fuel importance function was
found to be radially uniform to within
5% of its average value. In a second
test, equal volumes of fuel were ex-
changed between the inner and outer
regions, where the concentrations and
the importance functions differ most;
the resulting net mass shift of 8 g¢
of U?3% changed the reactivity only
slightly. The theoretically predicted
fuel concentration distribution for
uniform thermal-neutron fluxis, there-
fore, very insensitive to small con-
centration changes, and the relation
between critical mass and concentration
distribution has a broad minimum,
 
INTRODUCTION

The primary concern in the research
on high-temperature liquids has been
the determination of the phase diagrams
of fluoride and chloride systems with
and without uranium (sec. 5). Detailed
study of the NaF-ZrF,-UF, system has
continued because of the ARE reguire-
ment for higher uranium concentration.
The composition containing about 6.5
mole % UF, obtained by the addition of
Na,UF, (the ABE fuel concentrate) to
NaZrF, {the ARE fuel carrier) should
provide a suitable fuel. Data are
reported from several other systems
containing either UF,, UF,, ThF,, or
UCl, which have been examined in the
search for suitable aircraft fuels.
To date, most of the data have been
obtained by the direct thermal analysis
technique. Since this technique is
not adequate to completely define the
phase equilibria of complex systems,
other techniques, including quenching,
differential thermal analysis, high-
temperature x-ray diffraction, and
high-temperature phase separation, are
also being employed. Several problems
associated with the preparation and
purification of fluoride mixtures have
been investigated.

The recent corrosion studies have
been devoted almost entirely to the
effect of various parameters on the
corrosion of Inconel by fluorides,
although some work with hydroxides and
liquid metals was continued (sec. 6).
Studies of the corrosion of Inconel by
the fuel NaF-ZrF, -UF, (50-46-4 wole %)
as a function of time and of tempera-
ture have provided a better picture of
the corrosion mechanism. While the
corrosion rates at 1500 and 1650°F in
runs of 500-hr duration are comparable,
the initial corrosion rate is higher
at the higher temperature. These
initial corrosion rates (~1 mil/day)
decrease after several days by a factor
of 10. While the
mechanism is associated with the con-
centration of fluoride contaminants

the secondary corrosion mechanism may
be an inherent limitation of Inconel-
fluoride systems. The beneficial
effect of adding ZrH, has been demon-
strated in additions of quantities as
small as 0.1 wt % - an amount consistent
with the known concentration of
structural metals in the fuel, The
corrosiveness of fluorides on Inconel
in tests at high fluid velocities is
apparently no greater than that in
static tests, This is not generally
true when the fluid is liquid sodium,
however; its

Of the
several stainless steel convection
loops recently tested with circulating
lead, only the loop constructed of
type 410 stainless steel did not plug.

The fabrication of high-conductivity
radiator fins and their subsequent
assemblage into high-temperature high-
performance radiator segments repre-
sent the major accomplishment of the
metallurgical research program, Other
work in this program included investi-
gations of the mechanical properties
of Inconel and the fabrication of pump
seal and tubular fuel elements (sec. 7).
The most satisfactory radiator fins
are formed from 10-mil sheets of copper
(for high thermal conductivity) clad
with type 310 or type 346 stainless
steel (for oxidation resistance).
Three brazing alloys appear to be
suitable with regard to melting point
and corrosion resistance for the
fabrication of radiator assemblies: a
low-melting-point Nicrobraz, G-E No.
62 alloy, or Ni-P alloy. The Ni-P
alloy is very promising, since it can
readily be preplated (by an “elec-
troless’” plating technique) to the
to-be-brazed joint, even though the
joint must be subsequently chrome
plated to attain the desired corrosion
resistance, Creep-rupture data have
now been obtained for both coarse- and

fine-grained Inconel in fluorides at

7500 psi. Techniques for drawing
tubular solid-fuel elements are being
investigated.

The high-temperature
properties of several molten
chlorides, and hydroxides have been
measured, and the heat transfer
characteristics of these liquids are
being studied in various systems
(sec. 8). The viscosity and density
of the latest ARE fuel NaF-ZrF, -UF,
(53.5-40-6.5 mole %),
measured, and the values
properties proved to be very similar
to the values for the previous fuel
composition, In particular, the
viscosity decreased from 16 cp at
580°C to 5.7 cp at 950°C, while the
density did not change significantly,
The measured fluid-to-wall temperature
difference in a simulated circulating-
fuel system fell within 230% of
theoretical values, Additional heat
transfer data for circulating NaF-KF-
LiF eutectic in Inconel substantiated
data which showed this
eutectic to have about one-half the
heat transfer capacity of the compa-
rable fluoride-nickel system. The
poorer performance with Inconel was
caused by a K,CrF, film, The film,
which was formed by mass transfer in
the bimetallic system, was also re-
sponsible for the decreased heat
transfer capacity in the fluoride-to-
NaK heat exchange system.

spectrometric techniques of fuel
analysis have indicated that there
is no gross segregation of the uranium
in irradiated fluoride fuels, The
corrosion of Inconel capsules 1s more
severe when they are irradiated; how-
ever, it is not certain whether the
radiation is directly or only in-
directly responsible. With beryllium
oxide in sodium, however, there was no
effect due to irradiation. The in-pile

5. CHEMISTRY OF HIGH-TEMPERATURE LIQUIDS

W. R. Grimes, Materials Chemistry Division

In the course of the past three
years, the technique of thermal
analysis has been applied to a large
number of two- and three-component
fluoride systems. The data obtained,
which have been incorporated into a
number of progress reports, have been
sufficient to demonstrate which one of
the various systems shows promise for
reactor application but, especially in
systems with complex behavior, have
seldom served to completely define the
phase equilibria involved. This
“exploratory” study is nearing com-
pletion.

Among the fluoride systems studied,
it appears that NaF-ZrF,-UF,, NaF-BeF, -
U¥,, LiF-BeF,-UF,, and the corres-
ponding systems containing thorium are
of general value as reactor materials.
Increasing emphasis will be placed
during the next several months on the
development of detailed and complete
phase diagrams for these complex
three-component systems and their
associated binary systems, The NaF-
ZrF,-UF, system will be studied first
because it is to be used in the ARE.

In this program, the techniques of
quenching, differential thermal
analysis, high-temperature x-ray
diffraction, high-temperature phase
separation, and x-ray diffraction will
be used simultaneously on the system
under study. Apparatus has been
prepared and tested for each of these
methods, and the applicability of the
methods to certain aspects of phase
equilibria in fluoride systems has
been demonstrated.

THERMAL ANALYSIS OF FLUORIDE FUELS

C. J. Barton W. C. Whitley

Materials Chemistry Division

Although the direct thermal analysis
method of studying fluoride fuels is

expected to be supplanted by other
techniques during the next year, it
has been used considerably during this
quarter, In general, the experiments
have been confined to exploratory
studies of systems containing ThF,, to
re ~-examination of several binary
fluoride systems to refine the data so
that other techniques can be applied
directly, and to examination of some
systems for which the data obtained
previously were quite meager.

No previously unreported fluoride
systems containing UF, were investi-
gated during this quarter. Further
study was applied, however, to several
systems for which previous thermal
analyses were incomplete or needed to
be refined. Early studies of the
NaF-UF,, RbF-UF,, KF-UF,, and CsF-UF,
binary systems were repeated, in
large part. Only minor changes in
the published diagrams seem to be
indicated by these experiments. The
final diagrams will be published after
additional study by x-ray and quenching
techniques, Some new data were ob-
tained on the KF-ZrF, -UF, system.

Study of the complex NaF-ZrF,-UF,
system was continued during this
quarter. Thermal analysis data for
several **joins” in this system have
been obtained in an effort to improve
understanding of the phase relation-
ships in this system. One such join,
the Na,UF, -NaZrF, system, is of
especial importance, since the proposed
ARE fuel makes use of the two com-
ponents.

Studies of fuel mixtures containing
UF, included the systems UF, -ZrF,,
UF, -UF,-Zr¥,, and NaF-ZrF,-UF;-UF4.
Some data on the first two of these
systems were reported previously.(!)

Study of the NaF-ZrF, -UF,-UF, system

a yellow phase that is present when
slight reduction of NaF-ZrF,-UF,

these studies, about 1.5 kg of UF,
(99% pure by petrographic examination)
was synthesized by a previously

that the liquidus line for the Na, UF, -

on the region of Fig. 5,1 that lies
between 77.5 and 82% NaZrF, (7.5 to
6.0 mole % UF,). The data in this
region indicate a steady increase in
melting point with increasing UF,

19 mole % ZrF,, 17.5 mole % UF, , which
melts at 600 + 5°C.

obtained on several mixtures in the
KF-ZrF,-UF, system, and special pre-
were taken to minimize

KZrF,, addition of as little as 2
mole % UF, produces high-melting-point

diagrams for three alkali fluoride-

published - the KF-ThF, and RbF-ThF,
systems in the open literature(3) and
the LiF-ThF, system in the classified
literature,(%) Since it was felt that
data on the system NaF-ThF, might
contribute to a better understanding
of the NaF-UF, system, a phase study
of the NaF-ThF, system was started
during this quarter. X-ray diffraction
studies of this system have been
reported in the literature, (%) Pre-
liminary results indicate that the
NaF-ThF, phase diagram is quite similar
to the NaF-UF, phase diagram.
UF,-ZrF,. Work on the UF,-Zr¥F,
system was continued, with the range
of 16.67 to 66.67 mole % UF; being
studied. The effects of varying
heating time and container materials
were studied by means of petrographic
examination and x-ray diffraction
observations of several compositions
that had been heated for various
periods of time at 900°C under helium.
No new compounds have yet been defi-
nitely identified, but there are indi-
cations of solid-solution formation.

UF,-2ZrF, (R.I. = 1.556), now appears
to be olive-drab in color, rather than

mixtures contained a brownish, slightly
birefringent phase with a refractive

was composed entirely of this material.
The other mixtures were found to
contain an excess of one or two of the
other components. The range of the

findings included the following: fine-
grained material with a low refractive

vacuum at about 400°C was used to
obtain much of the data, it is doubtful
whether water was completely excluded

are flattened and welded closed to
prevent oxidation and vaporization of
the contents. In order to achieve
complete quenching of a liquid to a
glass from above the liquidus tempera-
ture, it was found necessary to employ
mercury for the quenching bath.
Platinum weights attached to the
capsules by short lengths of fine wire
are used to pull the capsules beneath
the surface of the mercury.

Considerable difficulty was en-
countered because of the formation of
zirconium oxide crystals and other
oxidation products during the melting
of some of the mixtures in the NaF-ZrF,
system, In most cases, the oxide can
be traced to the presence of water in
the original samples.

Although this region exhibits phase
behavior much more complex than was
formerly believed, the original
liguidus temperatures are nowhere in
serious error.

The quenching experiments and the
petrographic examinations of the
products have shown the following
behavior in the NaF-ZrF, binary system,
Samples containing 57 mole % NaF are

both liquidus and solidus temperatures
are between 494 and 500°C. The crystals
below the solidus are too small for
petrographic examination. At 52 mole %
NaF, both liquidus and solidus temper-
atures are near 504°C; the crystal
previously identified as NaZrF; is the
predominant phase below the solidus
temperature. At 50 mole % NaF, the
liquidus and solidus temperatures are
between 504 and 510°C; below the
solidus line the NaZrF, crystal is the
predominant phase, but not the only
At 46.3 mole % NaF, the liquidus
temperature is slightly above 518°C,
while the solidus temperature is below
513°C. At 42.8 mole % NaF, the liquidus
temperature seems to be between 540
and 550°C; the solidus is below 513°C.
Each of the last two compositions shows
quite complex behavior; the crystalline
phases are not completely identified.
It appears that Na Zr,F , is the com-

two stable modifications of this

DIFFERENTIAL THERMOANALYSIS OF
FLUORIDES

R. A. Bolomey C. J. Barton

Materials Chemistry Division

The differential thermoanalysis
apparatus has been used to study the
middle region of the NaF-ZrF, binary
system, and considerable time has been
spent in modifying the equipment so as
to obtain more precise results, It
appears that the best results are
obtained from heating curves when
temperature changes of about 0,5°C/min
are used.

Figure 5.4 presents data obtained
by both direct and differential thermal
analysis of the NaF-ZrF, system. While
reasonable agreement between the two
methods has been realized, it is
apparent that the phase behavior of
this system is more complex than was
previously believed, Additional study
by several techmiques is in progress.

PHASE EQUILIBRIA OF FUSED SALTS

R. J. Sheil C. J. Barton

Materials Chemistry Division

High-temperature filtration apparatus
has been used by other workers in this
Laboratory for various studies of
fused salt systems.(!%) During this
quarter, the apparatus was applied to
phase equilibrium studies, The
apparatus permits filtration of a
melt through a sintered nickel filter
while the melt is kept at a chosen
temperature and atmosphere. To date,
the data obtained have been insufficient
for a proper evaluation of the degree
of separation of selid from liquid at
a given temperature of filtration, but
it seems likely that the method will
provide valuable information to supple-
ment the standard thermal analysis
studies of phase equilibria.

Table 5.1 contains data obtained by
filtering various fluoride melts at
the indicated temperatures. In most
cases there was not sufficient residue
for a complete analysis; therefore x-
ray and petrographic examinations were
utilized for identification of the
phases present in the material.

Various compositions (by weight)
were made up, sealed in small flattened
nickel tubes, and quenched in mercury
from a temperature known to be well
above the melting point, Evidence that
glasses were obtained was provided by
microscopic examination. The glass
was powdered, and a suspension of
a weighed amount of the powder in a
colorless oil with the same refractive
index was placed in a cell made by
boring a l-cm hole in a microscope
slide and cementing another slide to
a base. The cell was then
completely filled with the chosen oil
and closed with for
examination with the spectrophotometer.

a cover glass

A Beckman DU spectrophotometer was
mounted on its end so that the slide
was horizontal when used in the cell
holder. In this way, the solids were
distributed fairly uniformly upon the
base of the cell. By using various
weights of sample, 1t was shown that
the Beer-Lambert law was followed
within 15%; thus the nonuniformity of
the specimen was not too serious.

Absorption spectra of any trans-

parent solid, that is, crystalline
solids as well as glasses, may be
obtained in this manner. However,

since a crystal has, in general,
different indices of refraction along
the several optic axes, an exact match
of refraction with the suspending oil
is not possible. A mismatch results
in a rise in the general level of
absorption, because of increased
scattering, and in poorer resolution of
the spectrum.

The spectrum obtained for crystalline
UF, is compared in Fig. 5.5 with that
of a glass made from a solution of UF,
at 18 mole % in NaZrF,. For comparison,
all spectra are calculated on the basis
of the Beer-Lambert law to the ab-
sorption per 0.01 mmole of compound
(or solute). It is apparent that the
spectra are different, both gquali-
tatively and quantitatively, which
makes reasonable the supposition that
the UF, has reacted to form a complex,

from solid te liquid is probably not
entirely responsible for the dif-
ference in the spectrum if the results
shown in Fig. 5.6 are typical. Here,
the spectrum of crystalline Na,UF, is
compared with that of glassy Na, UF,
prepared by quenching the pure com-
pound. A general decrease in intensity
of absorption is found, which was
observed in the UF, as well, but the

formed between UF, and the solvent
shows reasonable adherence to the
dilution law. The study of other
proportions is expected to provide a
formula for the one compound found and
to indicate whether there is more than
one compound formed,

Experience has shown that the ab-
sorption measurements are very sensitive
to the small amounts of dark-colored
impurities that are presumably intro-
duced by the nickel tubing. Such
impurities raise the general level of
absorption without altering the shape
of the curve too much, The deviation
shown in these curves from the expected
concentration dependence may be due to
such impurities.

Preliminary experiments have demon-
strated that treatment of NaZrF, melts
with metallic zirconium gives aproduct
which contains fewer structural metal
impurities than similar melts treated
with hydrogen. It appears that the
metal-treated melts contain reduced
zirconium species.

Other studies have included treat-
ment of the NaBeF, seal compound with
beryllium and reduction of dissolved
CrF, by hydrogen, Numerous complex
fluoride compounds which result from
the interaction of alkali with structur-
al metal fluorides have been prepared
for identification or characterization.

with argon. Examination of the argon
for hydrogen fluoride content has been
useful in determining the rate and the
extent of reaction of free hydrogen
fluoride with the zirconium fluoride;
reduction of structural metal ions by
the zirconium fluoride is measured by
subsequent treatment of the melt with
hydrogen and observation of the
hydrogen fluoride content of the exit
gas.

In each case, it was observed that
the hydrogen fluoride content of the
exit argon dropped on exposure of the
melt to zirconium. In addition, the
difference in equilibrium hydrogen
fluoride content of the hydrogen be-
fore and after exposure demonstrates
the effectiveness of reductioen of
iron, chromium, and nickel compounds
by this reagent. A large portion of
the structural metals 1s deposited on
the platinum wire with which the
zirconium bar is suspended in the melt.

The possibility of reducing these

been suspended in the 800°C melt after
hydrofluorination and hydrogenation.

indicate that the potential varies from
0.5 volt after 2 hr to less than 0.1
volt at the conclusion of the treatment.

In every case the weight loss of
the zirconium bar is higher bya factor
of at least 5 than the loss expected
from the reduction of structural metal
ions. The melt so obtained has been
shown to be capable of reduction of

fluoride after removal of the zirconium
bar. Analytical tests made after
filtration of the product through
sintered nickel indicated that the
“reducing power” was still present.
It appears likely that this reducing
action is due to soluble di- or tri-
valent zirconium fluoride. Further
study of this phenomenon is planned.

Treatment of NaBeF, with Metallic
Beryllium, In connection with a study
of the utilization of metallic reducing
agents in the purification of fluoride
melts, beryllium metal was used in
conjunction with hydrogen on a sample
of NaBeF,; prepared for trials as a
frozen seal material, The beryllium
metal lost weight in an amount corres-
ponding to 710 ppm of beryllium con-
sumed by the melt even though the melt
had previously received a prolonged

resulting melt was treated at 800°C
with 166 liters of hydrogem. Through-
out the experiment, the hydrogen

2 x 1075 mole of hydrogen fluoride per

hydrogen fluoride generated corresponds
to a reduction of about 1% of the CrF,
added.

showed 830 ppm of chromium, whereas

seem to indicate that divalent chromium
is reduced by hydrogen very slowly, if
at all,

hydration under HF of the precipitate
obtained by adding NH HF to an aqueous

was found that heating CdCl, -2 1/2 H,0
under HF failed to convert the chloride
quantitatively to the fluoride. It
was also learned that the precipitate
formed by adding NH HF to an aqueous
solution of CdCl, contained equivalent
quantities of chloride and fluoride.
This suggested the formation of a
double salt. Anhydrous AgF was pre-
pared by treating Ag,CO; with HF at

During this quarter, the static,
seesaw, and rotating corrosion testing
facilities have been used primarily
for the study of the corrosion of
Inconel by a proposed fluoride fuel
mixture, NaF-ZrF, -UF, (50-46-4 mole %).
The few rotating tests completed
showed no different or greater attack
than that experienced in static and
seesaw tests. Among the corrosion
parameters examined in the latter
tests of 100-hr duration at 1500°F
were the effect and removal of an
oxide layer, exposure time, oxide and
zirconium hydride additives, tempera-
ture, and uranium content of the melt.
As expected, an increase in the uranium
concentration increases corrosion.
The effectiveness of small (0.1%)
additions of zirconium hydride in
reducing the impurities is consistent
with the known metal content of pure
fuel after exposure to Inconel. An
oxide layer on the Inconel also in-
creases corrosion but can be readily
removed by pretreatment of the metal
with NaZrFy;. Corrosion has been cor-
related with a decrease in the iron
content of the melt (and a compen-
sating increase in the chromium con-
tent) during the first 100-0dd hr of
exposure. Although the depth of
attack is essentially independent of
temperature from 800 to 1400°F, the
attack is much greater at temperatures
from 1600 to 2000°F.

Fluoride corrosion studies in
Inconel thermal convection loops
supplement and extend the data obtained
above. Although these loops normally
operate for 500 hr with a hot-leg
temperature of 1500°F, the effects of

both time and temperature have been
studied. While the corrosion rates
after 500 hr at 1500°F and at 1650°F
are comparable, the initial corrosion
rate is higher at the higher tempera-
ture, However, high initial corrosion
rates (correlated with NiF, and FeF,
fuel contaminants) are superseded
around 250 hr by much lower corrosion
rates, possibly because of the oxi-
dation of chromium by UF,. A type 316
stainless steel insert in the Inconel
loop was preferentially attacked by
the fluorides, whereas graphite
immersed in the fluoride causes
carburization of the Inconel loop.
The hot-leg deposits, previously
encountered when zirconium hydride was
added to the loops, have been eliminated
by adding the hydride to the fuel
before it is filtered when the loop
is filled.

The postulated long-term mechanism
for the corrosion of Inconel by fluorides
is being investigated in a study of
chemical equilibria in fluoride
systems, Equilibrium constants for
reactions of the type

FeF, t Cr mmo CrF, + Fe

and

2UF, + Cr === 2UF, + Cr¥F, ,
where the active species are dissolved
in NaF-ZrF, melts at high temperatures,
are being measured.

A limited number of tests were
performed with liquid metals, including
sodium, lithium, and lead. In general,
spinner tests with sodium show greater
attack than comparable static sodium
tests. In static tests with lithium,
types 309 and 316 stainless steel

71
ANP QUARTERLY PROGRESS REPORT

exhibited superior corrosion resistance
(1 to 2 mils in 400 hr at 1000°C) to
that of types 347 and 430 stainless
steel. Additional studies on the mass
transfer of container materials in lead
have been continued with the use of
small thermal convection loops. Of
the metal loops tested recently, only
the type 410 stainless steel loop did
not plug, and it showed only a small
amount of mass transfer; nickel-iron
alloy (30-70 wt %), chromium, nichrome
V, and nickel loops plugged in 275,
100, 12, and 2 hr, respectively.

The corrosion of structural metal
by hydroxides at 1500°F has not been
sufficiently well controlled to permit
consideration of these liquids for use
in high-temperature reactors. Hy-
is at a minimum,
in nickel (and silver and

droxide corrosion

gold) systems in which a hydrogen
atmosphere is maintained. In recent
studies on hydroxide corrosion,
attempts have been made to study the
oxidizing power of hydroxide corrosion
products and to determine the equi-
librium pressure of hydrogen over the
hydroxide in several metals.

Effect of Oxide Layer. Structural
metal oxides are known to be unstable
in the presence of ZrF,-bearing
mixtures with respect to reactions of
the type

ZrF, + Ni0 —> ZrOF, + NiF,

ZrF, + 2NiQ > Zr0, + 2NiF,
and
3Zrk, + 2Cr, 0, —> 3Zr0, + 4CrF, .

Since such structural metal fluorides
are soluble to a considerable extent

’

in the molten mixture and can attack
the Inconel by reaction with the
chromium, oxide films on the metal
walls are a potential source of in-
creased corrosion.

The chromium uptake of a pure
preparation of NaZrF; in degreased
Inconel capsules is compared in Table
6.1 with that observed when the Inconel
was subjected to a 24-hr exposure in
air at 1000°C prior to the test. Both
specimens were exposed for 100 hr in
the seesaw test apparatus, The un-
oxidized specimens revealed, upon
metallographic examination, scattered
subsurface void formation to a depth
of 0.5 mil. Heavy subsurface void
formation to a depth of 2.5 to 3 mils
was observed in the oxidized tubes at
the hot end. Although the oxide layer
was still visible in some spots in
these specimens, the cold ends of the
tubes showed moderate oxide
attack.

It is of interest to note that when
pure fuel is used on Inconel in the
as-received condition, a total of 30
to 35 meq/kg of iron and chromium

compounds is found after testing. This
lower limit of corrosion products has

Hydride Additions,” below). It is lographic examination of specimens

possible that in the handling of the
pure powdered NaZrF, mixture, suf-
ficient water is picked up to account
for the observed concentration of
metallic constituents. It also appears
possible that as-received Inconel has
an oxide layer that is sufficient to
account for this attack.

Removal of Oxide Layer. The ability
of the fluoride NaZrF, to remove the
oxide layer on Inconel is being in-
vestigated because of its possible
use in the ARE.

The specific objectives of these
latest tests were to determine the
lowest temperature at which the
fluoride will remove oxide from Inconel
and the amount of attack which takes
place during descaling. Static tests
run with NaZrF; and Inconel
specimens .that had been oxidized for
24 hr at 1500°F. Results of these
tests can be seen in Fig. 6.1. All
specimens were completely descaled,
except the one treated at 950°F. From
this series of tests, it would appear
that a temperature of 1000°F could be
recommended for descaling Inconel.
However, since previous tests indicated
that descaling was not accomplished
after 4 hr at 1000°F, a temperature of
1100°F gives the more certain results.
In the previous tests the specimens
were electropolished, before oxidizing,
and possibly the oxide: layer on these
Metal -

were

specimens was more adherent,

which had been oxidized and then
descaled showed that only very light
attack is to be expected during the
usual short time of descaling.

Effect of Oxide Additive. As
mentioned above, the use of NaZrF, to
remove the oxide layer on Inconel is
being investigated. Since buildup of
zirconium oxide in the fluoride with
successive cleanings had been reported,
static corrosion tests were made with
the NaZrF, to which 0.75 and 1.5% ZrO,
had been added. There was possibly a
slight increase in depth of attack by
the fluorides containing zirconium
oxide during the 100-hr test at 816°C;
but for the short times used for
descaling, no measurable increase in
attack as a result of the zirconium
oxide in the fluoride should be
expected,

Ef fect of Small Zirconium Hydride
Additions. The beneficial effect of
zirconium hydride additions on the
corrosion behavior of fluoride melts
in Inconel has been discussed in
several previous reports. The most
recent report in this series(!) indi-
cated that for the NaF-ZrF, -UF, mixtures

showed nearly the same effect as larger
additions. In additional studies of

Corrosion of High-Purity Inconel.
Static tests were run on several
specimens of high-purity Inconel pre-
pared by the Metallurgy Division. The
nominal analysis of these specimens
(by weight) was 15% Cr, 78% Ni, and
7% Fe, but the C, S, Ti, Mn, Al, and
Mg contents ranged to a maximum of
1.6, 0.026, 0.25, 0.25, 0.15, and 0,05%,
respectively, in the varions Inconels.
Specimens of these materials contained
in off-the-shelf Inconel tubing were
tested in NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-
44.5-1.1 mole %) at 816°C for 100
hours, In general, the as-cast, low-
carbon specimens had fewer subsurface
voids than did the extruded specimens,
but attack of the extruded specimens
was not excessive, In the tests in
which the as-cast and the extruded
material from the same ingot were
tested, no significant difference in
corrosion was observed, The attack in
the as-cast specimen containing 1.6% C
was the most but depth of
attack in this specimen was only
slightly greater than that in the low-
carbon (0.03 wt %) specimens, With
the exception of this high-carbon
material, the laboratory-melted alloys
were not significantly different from
commercial alloys with respect to
attack by the fluoride,

Effect of Temperature. Static cor-

to 2000°F (1093°C). The duration of
each test was 100 hours. Within the
range 800 to 1400°F, the depth of

The attack of Inconel by fluorides was

formed a surface layer and inhibited
attack. Additions of NiF, and CrF,,
as expected, (3) increased attack. Some
small globular crystals were found

The use of thermal convection loops
for determining dynamic corrosion by
liquids has been previously described.(2)
Unless otherwise stated for the tests
described in the following sections,
the temperature of the hot leg of the
loop was maintained at 1500°F and the
temperature of the uninsulated cold
leg was approximately 1300°F. With
the fluoride salts, this temperature
difference results in a fluid velocity
of about 6 to 8 fpm. The usual testing
period was 500 hours.

Zirconium Hydride Additive. Previ-
ously, (*) when zirconium hydride was
added to the fluoride in an Inconel
loop, the depth of attack was reduced,
but a layer was deposited on the hot-
leg wall. An Inconel loop has been
run with NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %)
treated with zirconium hydride in the
fill pot, After the batch had been
held at 1200°F and agitated for 3 hr,
it was transferred to the loop through
a micrometallic grade-G filter; the
loop was then operated for 500 hr at
1500°F. No layer could be found in
the hot leg, and the hot-leg attack
had been reduced to a maximum pene-
tration of 2.5 mils, which is the same
as the attack obtained with previous
zirconium-hydride additions.

Effect of Type 316 Stainless Steel
Insert in Inconel Loop. One Inconel
loop in which a type 316 stainless
steel section 6 in. long had been
welded into the upper part of the hot
leg was operated with NaF-ZrF, -UF,
(50-46-4 mole %). The Inconel showed
only very light and widely scattered
subsurface void formation to a depth
of 3 mils, and the depth of attack
decreased near the stainless steel
joint. The joining stainless steel
showed a very rough surface, with some
areas spalling off. Heavy attack
extended to a depth of 12 mils and was
primarily intergranular in nature,
Figure 6.3 shows both the Inconel and
the type 316 stainless steel surfaces,
In the center of the stainless steel
insert, the attack decreased to 8 mils,
The Inconel below the stainless steel
showed a reduction in attack. In the
cold leg, a well-diffused surface
deposit 0.3 mil thick was found.

It appears, then, that stainless
steel is preferentially attacked by
fluorides in the presence of Inconel.
Since protection is afforded both above
and below the insert, an electro-

chemical reaction is probably the cause
of this protection. While it may be
possible to protect an Inconel system
by using stainless steel, such a combi-
nation does not look promising. The
major difficulty expected in such a
system would be mass transfer, The
major benefit derived from this experi-
ment is the warning against obtaining
corrosion data from a loop in which
any stainless steel is present,
Effect of Temperature on Inconel
Corrosion. As an extension of work
previously reported, (3) a loop was
operated with a hot-leg temperature of

(50-46-4 mole %) was a moderate-to-
heavy subsurface void formation to a
depth of 3 mils, These voids were
small and evenly distributed, Six
inches below the hot leg, no attack
was found. Also, since the chromium
in the fluoride did not build up
during the test, it is concluded that
little corrosion occurred. Since the
attack was low in the upper section of
the loop and completely absent in
other sections, it seems likely that
attack may be eliminated by operating
at aslightly lower maximum temperature,

These particles had penetrated the

graphic analyses showed the presence
of chromium, zirconium, and sodium,
and only traces of iron and nickel.
A diffraction pattern revealed the
presence of only the fuel, From this,
it appears that the layer consisted of
clumps of fuel covered with chromium
metal, While attack was deeper than

fluoride fuel was lower,

Effect of Exposure Time. In the

presented which indicated that after
250 hr very little, 1f any, increase
in the maximum depth of penetration

upon one series of loops filled from
the same batch of fuel and operated
for various times of up to 250 hr and
from several loops filled with fuel
from other batches and operated for
500 and 1000 hours. Information is
now available from the 500-, 10060-~,

To show reproducibility,
the data from the single-coolant batch
are supplemented by comparable data
from other batches,

The curve in Fig. 6.6 shows that
while a change in slope takes place at
around 250 hr, attack continues after
250 hours. This continued attack is
based upon the single loop operated
for 3000 hr and therefore needs to be
confirmed. It is thought that the
initial steep portion of the curve is
caused by a reaction between the
chromium in the Inconel and the
contaminants in the fuel and the loop.
The second phase of the reaction
possibly represents the partial re-
duction of UF, by chromium metal.

An unexpected finding in the loop
operated for 3000 hr was the presence
of a metallic mass in the cold-leg
sump. No deposit was found on the
walls of the loop. The mass was
identified spectrographically as
chromium metal, The method of formation
of this metallic chromiumis not known,
since the reactions are usually con-
sidered as an oxidation of chromium
metal to chromium fluoride. One
possibility is that this reaction is
temperature sensitive and reverses
itself in the cold leg.

FLUORIDE CORROSION OF STAINLESS STEELS
OF VARYING PURITY

D. C. Vreeland E. E. Hoffman
Metallurgy Division

In an attempt to determine the
effect of various carbon, oxygen, and
nitrogen contents of stainless steels
on resistance to attack by fluorides,
static corrosion tests were made on
eight specimens of stainless steels,
Two specimens were commercial stain-
less steel, types 304 and 305, while
the other six specimens were stainless
steels cast and extruded at MIT. Three
of these special steels contained 18%
chromium and 12% nickel, while the
other three contained 18% chromium and
8% nickel, Each of the eight specimens
was contained in a capsule machined
from the same material as the speci-
men, with the exception of the speci-
men of type 305 stainless steel which
was contained in tubing of type 304
stainless steel, The specimens were
tested in NaF-KF-LiF-UF, (10.9-43.5-
44.5-1,1 mole %) for 100 hr at 816°C.

in static tests with molten sodium.
Surface layers were quite apparent
on the Inconel X, nichrome V, and type
310 stainless steel and either less
apparent or absent on the types 430
and 410 stainless steel. Weight
changes were less on the types 410 and
A30 stainless steel.

Static Tests with Lithium. Static
tests of types 309, 316, 347, and 430
stainless steel were tun in lithium,

Extreme care was taken’ in regard to
the details of these tests; for example,
an extremely good dry box atmosphere
was maintained during the loading of
the tubes. These tests were run for
400 ht at 1000°C. Types 309 and 316
stainless steel exhibited corrosion
resistance superior to that of the
types 347 and 430 stainless steel.
Both types 347 and 430 showed evidence
of mass transfer on a macro scale.
The type 309 and 316 specimens had
small weight losses, very little, if
any, mass transfer, and not over 1 to
2 mils of attack. Details of these
tests are given in Table 6.4.

Dynamic Tests with Liquid Lead in
Convection Loops. Studies have been
made of the extent of mass transfer
encountered with type 410 stainless
steel, chromium, nickel, nichrome V,
and a 30% nickel-iron alloy in small
quartz thermal convection loops con-
taining liquid lead. Details of the
construction and operation of the loops
and of the results obtained for Inconel,
columbium, molybdenum, types 304, 347,
and 446 stainless steel, and Armco iron
have been reported previously.(7-8:9)

Of the metals tested during the

gave by far the best results. The

the hot- and cold-leg temperatures
were about 810 and 525°C. Metal-
lographic studies of this loop and of
the chromium loop have not yet been
completed, and therefore no data are
available on the corrosion that occurred
in these loops.

As a result of the recent studies,
it is apparent that much better
results are obtained from the 400
series stainless steels than from the
pure metals which comprise them. The
reverse tends to be the case for the
300 series stainless steels previously
tested. Further work will be done in
an attempt to obtain an explanation of
this behavior.

Equilibrium Pressure of Hydrogen
Over Sodium Hydroxide-fetal Systems.
Empirical tests in a number of labo-
ratories have shown that some of the
noble metals such as silver and gold,
as well as copper and nickel,

droxide, although none of these metals

are

can be considered as adequate structural

metal, Under a thermal gradient,
however, mass transfer of these metals
from hot to cold regicus of the

apparatus occurs; this mass transfer
1s considerably decreased when a
pressure of hydrogen is applied.
It appears likely that reactions of
the type

Ni + 2NaOH ==—Na,0'NiO + H, ,

in which the reverse reaction is
represented by

NiQ + H, === Ni + H,0
and
Na,0 + H,0 F== NaOH

may be responsible for these phenomena.
Accordingly, an attempt has been made
to determine the equilibrium pressure
of hydrogen over several metal-sodium
hydroxide systems as a function of
temperature.

The apparatus consisted of a quartz
envelope which was connected to a

mercury manometer, a liquid-nitrogen
cold trap, and, through stopcocks, to
a vacuum pump and a gas-sampling bulb.
A crucible of the metal to be tested
containing 10 to 15 g of sodium hy-
droxide was enclosed in the quartz
envelope, The apparatus was loaded
with sodium hydroxide in a helium dry-
box and was heated and evacuated to a
pressure well below 1 mm. The temper-
ature was maintained ‘at a constant
level until equilibrium pressures were
obtained. In general, the pressure
attained a value near equilibrium in
30 minutes. Once attained, equilibrium
values remained constant for at least
7 hours.

The values obtained in this pre-
liminary attempt are shown in Table

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1953

stable to sodium hydroxide than is
either copper or nickel; the value
obtained at 850°C for nickel appears
to be unaccountably high. The pressure
of hydrogen observed appeared to. be
independent of the gas volume of the
system.

Repeated removal of the hydrogen
formed by pumping at the reaction
temperature did not seem to change the
equilibrium pressure observed, although
the rate of attainment of equilibrium
was adversely affected. Since several
evacuations should decompose about 1%
of the sodium hydroxide charged, this
constancy of pressure may indicate
either that the pressure measurements
are not sufficiently accurate to detect
differences resulting from changes of
this magnitude or that the three-
component system (that is, Na,0-Ni-H,0)
is univariant. If the
actually univariant, in addition to
the liquid, the gas, and the solid
nickel phases, another solid phase,
probably Na,0:NiO or NiO, is required.

Since this reaction appears to be
fundamental to the sodium hydroxide
container problem, additional studies
with higher accuracy will be performed
in attempts to determine equilibrium
pressures of hydrogen and the effect
of added H,0, NiO, and other possible
impurities or corrosion products,

reaction with some oxidizing fluoride
in the mixture occurs during high-
temperature exposure, A typical
reaction would be

2UF, + Cr ——=22UF, + CrF,

in which all the fluorides exist
primarily as complex species in dilute
solution in Nalb-ZrF, melts. Since the
equilibrium constant for such a re-
action would be temperature dependent,
the slight “mass transfer” of chromium
could be explained on this basis.
Direct evaluation of equilibrium
constants of such a reaction can be
obtained from analysis of the filtrate
for soluble chromium if the following
conditions are assumed to hold: (1)
the physical solubility of chromium
metal, as very small in
fluoride melts at high temperatures,

ture is possible, (3) the starting
materials are of known quantity and

Considerable time has been devoted
to the development of adequate equi-
librium and filtration equipment. In
a previous report,{(1%) a description
was given of an assembly fabricated
from nickel which has been modified to
include a retractable filter stick,
which promises to be simpler to fabri-
cate and easier to use, The filter
stick uses a sintered nickel filter
and is connected through a metal
bellows to the melt container so that
the filter is above the melt during
the equilibration period and is im-
mersed only during collection of the
liquid sample.

In preliminary experiments, the
materials were charged into the
hydrogen-fired nickel equipment,
equilibrated at 800°C for 5 hr with
agitation (the assembly was shaken),
and allowed to equilibrate at 600°C
before filtration. The data obtained
show that Na,CrF; is quite soluble in
the fluoride mixture at 600°C, In
most cases, 1t appears that the ma-
terial was completely dissolved at the
concentrations used. This behavior is
to be contrasted with the relative
insolubility of K,NaCrF,; in LiF-NaF-KF
mixtures, Petrographic and x-ray
examinations of the filtrate indicate
the existence of solid solutions of
Na, CrF, in the NaZrF, matrix over a
wide range of compositions, Although
analyses for zirconium and uranium in
these systems show slight variation,
there is no evidence that insoluble
compounds of these materials result
from Na; CrF; addition.

In the filtrates from the Na, FeF,
addition,
of iron compounds

the lack of discrete phases
and the similar
lowering of refractive index indicate
that this compound also forms solid
solutions, However, the solubility of
Na,FeF, in this mixture is considerably
lower than that of Na,Fel,, and the
analytical results are less certain.

Preliminary experiments have been
performed in which known quantities of
metallic chromium or iron have been
added to the NaF-ZrF, -UF, mixture.
Again, equilibration at 800°C followed
by equilibration at 600°C and filtration
was the general practice. The results
indicate that reaction occurs to an
extent which makes possible analysis
of the products in these systems.
Additional studies with more pure
materials and refined analytical
techniques will be conducted in the
near future,

High-conductivity radiator fins can
be satisfactorily brazed to tubes of
either a longitudinal or a transverse
array by using a low-melting-point
Nicrobraz., Since it has been found
that placing the brazing alloy on the
brazed joint by the use of wire or
washers 1s advantageous, a technique
for the preparation of low-melting-
point Nicrobraz wire through the use
of an acryloic cement was developed.

A new brazing alloy series (nickel-
phosphorus and nickel-chromium-
phosphorus) has been found and is now
being studied. Phosphorus additions
to nickel and nickel-chromium alloys
are extremely effective in lowering
the melting point, and phosphorus is
suitable for reactor usage because it
hasa low cross section for the absorp-
tion of thermal neutrons. Another
advantage of the nickel-phosphorus-
chromium type of brazing alloy is the
possibility of preplacing the alloy
by convenient plating techniques,
since tubing can be plated with a
nickel strike followed by nickel-
phosphorus coating by the *‘electroless”
plating technique followed by chromium
plating on top of the nickel-phosphorus
alloy. Tt was found that addition of
chromium to the basic nickel-phosphorus
alloys is advantageous because it
increases the resistance of the brazing
alloy to air oxidation and sodium
corrosion and gives more strength to
the brazed joints.

In actual radiator fabrication, it
has been found that Nicrobraz is not
so good a brazing alloy to use as G-E
brazingalloy No. 62, a nickel-chromium=~
silicon alloy. During fabrication,
it is best to bring the heat exchanger
to 900°C so that the fin and tube
temperatures will equalize, quickly
heat it to the brazing temperature,
hold that temperature for the brazing

time, and then furnace cool 1t.
Nicrobraz is not satisfactory for this
cycle because the boron diffuses out
of the alloy while it is being held
at 900°C, and the resulting alloy has
a much higher melting temperature than
that of Nicrobraz., The nickel-chromium-
silicon brazing alloy in undergoing
the same thermal treatment produces a
good braze. The cracking tendencies
of the nickel-chromium-silicon alloy
when applied to a test radiator have
been determined by thermally cycling
the entire assembly from 1000°C to
room temperature. Only one small leak
occurred after a severe water quench
from 1000°C.,

The drawing of tubular fuel elements
has been initiated. Twelve tubes con-
taining cores of type 302 stainless
steel, iron, and nickel with 20 and
30% UO, are being reduced by plug
drawing from a tube 0.750 in. in
diameter with a 0.042-1n. wall to a
tube 0.250 in. in diameter with a
0.015-in, wall.

To give copper the oxidation re-
sistance needed for its use as a high-
conductivity fin, plates of chromium
and nickel deposited by the thermal
decomposition of the carbonyls were
tried, but the experiments were not
successful. Copper clad with Inconel
and types 310 and 446 stainless steel
has been studied. The type 310 and
the type 446 stainless steel cladding
seem to offer oxide protection and to
be free of the serious intradiffusion
experienced with the Inconel-clad
copper.

The creep and stress-rupture meas-
urements for both coarse- and fine-
grained Inconel in fluoride fuels at
815°C have been completed for the
stress range of 2500 to 7500 psi.
Specimens have now been in test for

1000 hr at 1500 and 2000 psi. A graph

current test data. In the study of
the combustion of sodium and sodium
alloys,it has been shown that additions
of mercury of about 70 mole % have a
pronounced retarding effect on the
combustion of sodium.

In an attempt to develop suitable
high-temperature-fluoride seals for
pumps, packing components have been
fabricated from both hot-pressed com-
pacts and vitreous materials. Mixtures
of copper and stainless steel with
MoS, have been fabricated into cylinders
to produce rings for packing-gland
seals on a 2 1/2-in.-dia pump shaft.
In addition, a BeF,-KF-MgF,-AlF, com-
position has been prepared for testing
of a viscous seal.

Low-Kelting-Point Nicrobraz. One
of the metallurgical problems as-
sociated with the use of high-con-
ductivity fin materials for heat
exchangers has been the selection of
suitable brazing alloys. In order to
satisfy the corrosion requirements of
resistance to both sodium and air at
816°C, the search fora suitable brazing
alloy was confined to alloys with a
nickel-chromium base. Since the melting
point of the copper core of the radiator

chromium-iron-silicon-boron brazing

The techniques used for fabrication
of IMNB wire are of general interest,
since they are applicable to a large
group of brazing alloys which must be
initially prepared as a powder. The
procedure used is, briefly, the fol-
lowing: (1) 50 g of alloy powder,
preferably ~100 to -200 mesh, is mixed
with approximately 25 cm® of Rohm and
Haas Acryloid B-7 to provide a thick
homogeneous slurry; (2) excess binder
is driven off by baking for 10 min at
200°C to a hard cake; (3) this com-
posite is softened with a small quantity
of acetone and kneaded to the con-
sistency of putty; (4) the billet thus
formed 1s extruded on a hydraulic
press through a 0,060-1in.-ID Lavite
die and wound ona 3/16-in.-dia mandrel
rotated at approximately 60 rpm by a
variable-speed motor; (5) the mandrel
is then set aside for curing at room
temperature for a minimum of 1 hr;
(6) the brazing-alloy helix thus
formed is removed from the mandrel
over-all lengths

and stored in l-in,
until with
individual rings.

Brazing of Radiator Fins with LMNB.
An attempt was made to braze clad-
copper fins with LMNB, and in order to
limit the problems in this preliminary
study, the following variables were
arbitrarily fixed: (1) The fin
material would be Inconel-clad copper,

cut a knife to
that is, 10 mils of copper clad on
both sides with 2 mils of Inconel.
(The fabrication of this material by
roll-cladding techniques is described
below under “High Conductivity Metals
for Radiators Fins. "”)(2) The 0.188-in.
OD, 0.020~in.-wall tubing would be
fabricated of Inconel. (3) The service
environment would include sodium at
1500°F within the tubes and air at
1500°F on the exterior of the tubes and
on the fin surfaces. The two radiator
configurations of interest were a
longitudinal -fin design that required
attachment of the fins parallel to
the tube axis and a radial-fin design
that consisted of the popular punched
fins and a multitude of tube-to-fain
joints.

the copper core were attributed
partially to the presence of a heavy
precipitate in the clad material and
partially to relief polishing, The
precipitate is characteristic of the
dilution and diffusion effects observed
in nickel-base alloys and stainless
steels brazed with the high-boron,
high-silicon Nicrobraz alloys.

To determine the feasibility of
the longitudinal (delta) fin design,
Inconel-clad copper sheet was preformed
into 6-in. lengths of the triangular
delta configuration. In order to
braze this delta configuration to the
tubes, a quantity of LMNB wire was
formed in straight lengths and pre-
placed along the full length of one
side of each tube with Nicrobraz
cement. A photomicrograph of the
brazed assembly is shown in Fig. 7.2.
The success of the brazing operations
confirmed the ability of this cement
to hold the brazing alloy wire in
place until a temperature of 800 to

900°C is reached, at which time
sintering of the wire to the base
material becomes pronounced.

The most critical joint of the
basic delta fin is that shown in the
lower right corner of Fig. 7.2, where
the sheared and therefore exposed
edges of the fin mated with each other
and the Inconel tube, Previous experi-
ments had verified that LMNB did not
flow on copper. Fortunately, pre-
placing a LMNB wire on the inside and
another on the outside of the delta
fin effectively reduced the joint
design to two | joints, and adequate
protection of the fin edges was
achieved. The effects of the 500-hr
oxidation test at 1500°F on the copper
core are evident from close examination
of Fig. 7.2. The voids in the copper
and the diffusion between core and
cladding indicate that Inconel-clad
copper is not entirely suitable for
high-conductivity fins, at least not
without diffusion barriers. This and
other clad fins are discussed below
under ‘‘High Conductivity Metals for
Radiator Fins.”

Nickel-Chromium-Phosplorus Brazing
Alloys. The nickel-phosphorus and
nickel-chromium-phosphorus systems are
being studied to determine their suit-
abilityas elevated-temperature brazing
alloys. The evaluation of these
systems is in preliminary stages, but
the results indicate that phosphorus
additions are extremely effective in
lowering the melting point of nickel
and nickel-chromium alloys. Phosphorus
is especially suitable for reactor
applications because of its low cross
section for absorption of thermal
neutrons, Alloys of the approximate
compositions given in Table 7.2 have
been prepared from a master alloy of

diffusion treatments may improve the
ductility of these alloys so that they
will be comparable to the Nicrobraz and
G-FE No. 62 alloys and will thereby
retain the obvious advantage of a low
melting point and a low cross section.
A survey of the recent literature
revealed a unique technique for pre-
plating these alloys which involved an
“electroless” method of nickel plating
that was developed several years ago
at the Bureau of Standards. The
method requires, first, the deposition
of a high-phosphorus-content nickel
plate which then becomes the brazing
alloy. Briefly, the deposition is
effected by the reduction of a nickel
salt to metallic nickel. A hypo-
phosphite is converted to the phosphite
with subsequent deposition of phos-
phorus-containing nickel. An obvious
advantage of this method 1s the possi-
bility of depositing a uniform plate
on a complex surface without ex-
periencing the difficulties introduced
by variations in ‘throwing power” of
the electrolytic methods.
To determine the feasibility of
the use of this “electroless” plate
as a brazing alloy, a series of type
316 stainless steel strips 1/2 by 3
by 1/16 were submitted to be
“electroless” plated with a nominal
thickness ofl mil of nickel-phosphorus
in a T-hr period by using procedures
based on the method developed by the
Bureau of Standards. Standard T joints

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1953

were made for flowability tests by
using a plated stainless steel strip
against an unplated stainless steel
strip. A photomicrograph of such a
section is shown in Fig. 7.3. Excellent
wetting was observed when the specimens
were brazed in dry hydrogen at 900°C,
which indicated that the reported
approximate compositionof 90% Ni-10%
P was correct. However, when the
joint was subjected to an oxidation
test of 500 hr at 1500°F in still air,
some defections appeared, as shown in
Fig. 7.4. The voids at the interface
in the T are believed to be due to
removal of constituents during pol-
ishing, whereas the undercut and the
irregularities of the fillet surface
are believed to be due to oxidation.

Since it was felt that the oxidation
resistance of the ‘““electroless” nickel-
phosphorus brazing alloy could be
improved by alloy addition of chromium,
a series of stainless steel test
strips were prepared (by using con-
ventional electrolytic plating methods)
with approximately 0.2 mil of chromium
on 1 mil of “electroless” nickel-
phosphorus alloy. These test strips
were brazed at 1000°C, and they ex-
hibited the same excellent flow as
that observed with the ‘“electroless”
nickel-phosphorus alloy. However,
the oxidation resistance of the nickel-
chromium-phosphorus alloy is better
than that of the nickel phosphorus
alloy. A photomicrograph of a section
of the T joint after exposure for
500 hr to static air at 800°C is shown
in Fig. 7.5. What appears to be voids
in the brazing alloy matrix were found
to be polishing pits, whereas the
irregularities at the brazing alloy
fillet surface were attributed to
oxidation. Static tests were also run
for 100 hr at 816°C to check the
corrosion resistance of these T joints
in sodium. Figure 7.6 shows a nickel-
phosphorus braze after exposure; note
that small voids are scattered through-
out the fillet and across the joint.

Figure 7.7, which shows a chromium-
plated nickel-phosphorus brazed joint,
reveals a few voids in the fillet to
a depth of 3 to 4 mils. Tt may be
concluded, then, that the nickel-
phosphorus braze does not have satis-
factory corrosion resistance to sodium
but that the addition of chromium
improves the resistance.

The results of the investigation,
to date, indicate that the nickel-
chromium-phosphorus system shows
promise both when applied conventionally
and when applied by “electroless”
plate methods. Preliminary remelt

tests indicate that remelt tempera-
atures of 1250°C can be achieved by
treatment at 1000°C for times as short

physical tests conducted to date have
been inconclusive, but there is
evidence that ductility canbe improved
by control of brazing temperature and
time.

Brazing of Radiator Assemblies with
Nicrobraz. As has been indicated in
previous reports, efforts to apply
Nicrobraz as an elevated-temperature
brazing alloy for fabrication of ANP
sodium-to-air heat exchangers have been
complicated by a number of factors.
The results of numerous experiments
conducted on laboratory-scale test
specimens and on full-size heat ex-
changer assemblies have shown that the
rate of heating to the brazing tempera-
ture is of great importance. Although
early experiments indicated that diffi-
culties in brazing did not arise from

diffusion of constituents from the
brazing alloy during heating, which
would have resulted in a loss in
flowabilityat the brazing temperature,
later tests gave contrary indications.
In tests with Nicrobraz in the form
of flat washers prepared by stamping
from sheet rolled or extruded from
powder mixtures, it was found that
during slow heating sufficient boron
diffused from the brazing material to
appreciably increase the melting point
of the brazing alloy and thereby pre-
vent the flow needed to produce a
satisfactory joint.

A remedy for the brazing diffi-
culties seemed to be fast heating to
the brazing temperature to minimize
diffusion and the subsequent lack of
flow. (The other possible alternative,
that of increasing the brazing tempera-
ture, was found to be ineffective

because dilution and undercutting also
increased materiallywith temperature.)
Rapid heating to the brazing tempera-
ture was found to introduce associated
problems. As would be expected, un-
equal heating occurred, and the thin
fin material reached the furnace
temperature before the tubes did. In
addition to an increase in distortion,
the unequal heating resulted in
“stealing” of preplaced brazing alloy.
That is, the alloy would flow on the
fin surface and would, consequently,
be unavailable for adequate wetting
of the tube wall when the temperature
equalized. Since the remedy for this
alternate effect would be a preheat
and since preheating would permit
diffusion, there appeared to be neo
remedy for the situation unless dif-
fusion could be decreased. This was
accomplished by the use of especially
extruded Nicrobraz rings. Experiments
revealed that rings formed of 60-mil
wire and preplaced were relatively
unaffected by the rate of rise to
temperature because of the relatively
small contact area afforded for dif-
fusion. The production of a large

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1953

quantity of these rings was therefore
initiated on a laboratory scale for
future experiments and for possible
use in a test heat exchanger.

Brazing of Radiator Assemblies with
G-E Alloy No. 62. Brazing evaluation
tests were also conducted with the G-E
brazing alloy No. 62 (69% Ni1-20% Cr-~
11% Si). Each experiment revealed
that this alloy was relatively free of
the complicating factors that influence
the behavior of Nicrobraz. The dilu-
tion, diffusion, and heating-rate
studies indicated that the boron-free
G-E alloy could be preplaced in any
convenient form and that preheat could
be applied without impeding subsequent
flow. Seven pounds of this alloy,
as ~200 mesh powder, was obtained and
is being used to study its suitability
for brazing heat exchangers.

A 1000-joint tube-to-fin radiater
was fabricated with the G-E alloy
preplaced, as a slurry, and subjected
to the following brazing cycle:
(1) heat to 900°C at an average of
50°C per minute; (2) hold at 900°C for
30 min to equalize fin and tube tempera-
tures; (3) heat to 1150°C at an
average rate of 30°C per minute;
(4) hold at 1150°C for 60 min, furnace
cool to black, and air cool to room
temperature.

Examination of this test radiator
indicated that adequate flow and wetting
had occurred. After repeated tempera-
ture cycling, including a severe water
quench from 1000°C, the radiator was
found to have only one small leak, and
that was subsequently repaired by re-
brazing.

fin, with oxidation resistance at
1500°F, is expected to be realized by
merely protecting a 10-mil copper fin
by cladding it with one of several

metals including, among others,
chromium, Inconel, and stainless
steel. Good bonds have been obtained

with Inconel and various stainless
steels as claddings, but only the
types 310 and 446 stainless steel
claddings also give the desired
oxidation protection without serious
intradiffusion.

Vapor Plated Chromium and Nickel on
Copper. samples of copper
plated by the thermal decomposition
of the carbonyls of chromium and nickel
were supplied by the Commonwealth Engi-
neering Company of Ohio. The plates de-
posited were both codeposited and de-
posited as separate layers of chromium on
nickel on copper. Bright smooth
deposits were limited to small areas,
which were brittle and failed to
protect copper from oxidizing at 1500°F,
The plate thicknesses were between 0.2
and 1.6 mils, No further work on
these materials 1s contemplated.

Chromium-Plated Copper. Samples
of “ductile” chromium have been re-
ceived from the Ductile Chrome Process
Company. Cracking of the plate is
not evident except by metallographic
examination and oxidation tests.
Alteration of the copper core does not
seem to occur as a result of diffusion.

Inconel-Clad Copper. Several square
feet of clad material has been requested
from commercial manufacturers for
assembling experimental heat exchangers
and for evaluation studies. Thus far,
about 9 ft? of clad copper (10 mils of
copper clad on both sides with 2 mils
of Inconel) has been received.

Cladding thicknesses varied between
0.75 and 3 mils, and there were
numerous pinholes. Oxidation tests
for 100 and 500 hr at 1500°C resulted
in the eruption of numerous copper

in the copper core near the interface
and diffusion that affected a zone of
about 3 mils at the end of 100 hours.
In 500 hr, the voids became fewer and
larger, and they were distributed
throughout the copper core. Diffusion
seemed to extend across the emtire
cross section of the sample (14 mils),
By suitable rolling and annealing,
cladding variations can be minimized
to about *0,5 mil and the pinholes can

be reduced to an inconsequential
number.

Type 310 Stainless Steel-Clad
Copper. The results obtained in

previous tests of type 310 stainless
steel-clad copper have been checked by
running additional experiments. As
was found in the first series of tests,
diffusion appears to be limited to the
formation of islands of a dark phase
in the cladding to a depth of 0.5 mil.
An increase in the testing time from
100 to 500 hr at 1500°F increased the
number of these islands but not the
depth of penetration. Surface failures
were limited to a few copper oxide
nodules.

Type 446 Stainless Steel-Clad Copper.
Type 446 stainless steel was roll
clad onto copper by reducing 50% at
1000°C in several passes; no bonding
was obtained. Good bonds were obtained
by melting the copper
446 stainless steel
hydrogen. The clad composite was cold
rolled with intermittent anneals to
8 mils, of which 4 mils was copper and
2 mils on each side was cladding.

Oxidation tests for 100- and 500-hr
periods resulted in the formation of a
few nodules of copper oxide on the
surface and severe warpage of the test
pieces. Examination of the interface
showed no apparent diffusion. In
500 hr, a dark precipitate, which is
not continuous, forms at the interface
to a depth of about 0.1 mil.

Copper Clad with Copper-Aluminum
Alloy. Ingots of 6% Al1-94% Cu and 8%
Al1-92% Cu have been made and rolled

into a type
capsule under
into a sheet. Attempts to roll clad
the alloys onto copper resulted in
bonding on only one side. This may
have been due to the formation of
Al1,0, during the welding.

This new heat of Inconel sheet exhibits
roughly twice the rupture life observed

an earlier one.

argon on both sides of the tube, has
been completed in the range of tangen-
tial stresses from 2000 to 4500 psi;
the results are not consistent enough
to allow interpretation. Another
series of tests with fuel in the tube
and argon on the outside is in progress;
the rupture life appears to be roughly
half that observed when the surfaces
are exposed to argon only.

From the tests to date, it was
observed that not only is the rupture
life longest in air, but, the
greatest elongations are observed when
oxygen 1s present either in the
gaseous atmosphere or as an oxide
film. The shortest rupture life and
the least ductility are observed for

values are found for tests in other

that the total elongation at rupture

FABRICATION OF PUMP SEALS

As discussed in Section 2, “Experi-
mental Reactor Engineering,” a number
of packed seal pumps have been operated
with fluoride mixtures at 1300°F.
Although operation with these seals
has been encouraging, the leakage rates
are higher than desired. Accordingly,
a number of unique packed-seal materials
ha ve fabricated, including
vitreous seals and hot-pressed com-
pacts with self-lubricating properties.

Hot-Pressed Pump Seals (E. S,
Bomar, J. H. Coobs, H. Inouye, Metal-
Jurgy Division). Four additional
cylinders of the 92% Cu-8% MoS, com-
position were fabricated for testing
as pump seals. These cylinders were
3 3/8 in. OD by 2 1/8 in. ID by 2 in.
long, and a sufficient number of rings
could be machined from them to obtain
a packing gland to seal a 2 1/2 in.-
dia pump shaft. The density of the
cylinders averaged 96.0% of theoreti-
cal.

been

In addition, it was decided that
the stainless steel-MoS, composition
should be tested because the Cu-MoS,
composition may not be sufficiently
resistant to chemical attack for this
application. As mentioned before, the
components of the stainless steel-MoS,
compacts react to some extent during
the hot-pressing cycle; there is
subsequent conversion of much of the
austenite to ferrite, and a sulfide
phase of unknown composition remains.

Two cylinders, 1 11/16 in. OD by
1 3/16 in. ID by 2 long, were
prepared by using -325 mesh type 304
stainless steel with 9% MoS,. These
were fabricated by hot pressing in a
graphite die at 1225°C. The density
of the cylinders averaged 93.5% of
theoretical, It is interesting to note
that, under identical conditions of
temperature and pressure, straight
stainless steel powder is consolidated
to only 87% of theoretical density.

Vitreous Seals (L. M. Doney, J. A.
Griffin, J. BR. Johnson, Metallurgy
Division). A limited experiment with
a NaBeF, mixture in a pump sealing
gland(?) indicated that such viscous
fluorides might be developed for seal
the initial tests, a
number of metal washers served to
isolate rings of the fluoride. The
ring voids were filled with the powdered
fluoride mix. As a consequence of the
encouraging results from the use of
this fluoride, a program was initiated
to develop more suitable high-tempera-
ture viscous seal materials. The need
is for a glassy substance with ap-
propriate viscosities over the temper-
ature range involved and also stability
against devitrification. To provide
a freely flowing viscous seal, it is
believed that a viscosity gradient of

first so that wetting will take place
on the shaft, housing, and metal
spacers. Devitrification, or crystal-
lization in the glass, will lead to a
fluid containing relatively hard
crystals which will act as an abrasive
on the metal parts.

Beryllium fluoride isa glass former
that produces a structural network of
randomly oriented BeF, "ion tetrahedra
that is analogous to the silica-glass
network. Alkali and alkaline earth
ions serve the same functions in the
fluoride network as they do in the
oxide systems. Very few data are
available on the physical properties
of the fluoride glasses; however, on
the basis of similarity to oxide
glasses, it is possible to predict
their general behavior. Thus, for
a glass with little tendency to de-
vitrify and with reasonable stability
against atmospheric attack, Mg" or
Ca** and A1""" ions should be included.
A glass which softens to a viscosity
of the order of 10% poises at 250°C is
desirable. The addition of alkali
ions such as Na’ or K' will produce
the desired viscosity. The glass com-
position proposed is the following:

TUBULAR FUEL ELEMENTS

E. S. Bomar J. UH. Coobs
H. Inouye
Metallurgy Division

Preparation of tubular fuel elements
by drawing has been initiated. Twelve
tubes containing cores of type 302
stainless steel, iron, and nickel with
20 and 30% UO, are being reduced a
total of 87% from 0.750 in. in diameter
with a 0.042-in. wall to 0.250 in. in
diameter with a 0.015-in. wall. HRe-
duction by plug drawing is being tried
in preference to drawing on a mandrel
because the latter process applies a
shear stress to the core. The shear
stress may have contributed to the
failure during earlier experiments (3)
of the core material in many of the
tubes drawn at the Superior Tube
Company. The plans call for the re-
duction of six tubes on each of two
schedules in steps of 15 and 20% re-
duction per pass, respectively,

The results obtained to date with
the 15% schedule have been quite en-
couraging. Six tubes have been
processed through three steps of the
schedule without difficulty. All six
tubes have excellent inside and outside
finishes, and they show no signs of
“rippling” or folding in the core
region. However, the tubes being
processed by the 20% schedule have
given discouraging results. Three
tubes have been processed for two
steps, and all three failed in tension
during drawing, one on the first pass
and two on the second. In addition,
slight rippling was evident at the
leading end of the core, and, in some
cases, drawing was accompanied by
chattering in the die. Evidently,
this schedule is fairly severe for

INFLAMMABILITY OF S50DIUM ALLOYS

G. P. Smith M. E. Steidlitz
Metallurgy Division

The new apparatus for examining the
combustion of sodium and some of its
alloys in various atmospheres has been
completed. The equipment consists of
a steel box connected to a vacuum
pump, a filter system, and a source of
dry air. The sodium capsule 1s heated
to a temperature of 700 to 800°C in a
furnace located on top of the box.
The tip of the capsule is then broken
off to cause a jet of molten metal to
spray into the atmosphere in the box.
Observations of the flammability are
made visually.

A total of six runs has been made
with pure sodium at 800°C in the new
apparatus. Of these, two were in dry
air and four were in room air, all at
a pressure of 1 atmosphere. The only
observable difference in these tests

was the formation of a heavier scum on

100

the surface of the molten sodium on
the floor of the box after burning in
room air, This scum was effective
in confining the combustion on the
floor to a section at the edge of the
puddle. The dry air samples burned
vigorously all over the puddle.

A series of tests on sodium-mercury
mixtures has been run at 700°C. Cap-
sules containing 50, 60, 62, 64, 66,
68, 70, and 90 mole % mercury were
burned in room air. The results were
as follows: with 50 mole % mercury,
the combustion of the jet is essentially
as vigorous as with pure sodium. With
60 mole % mercury, the combustion is
noticeably less vigorous. With 60 to
70 mole % mercury, the rate of com-
bustion decreases rapidly until with
70 mole % and greater, no fire is
observed in the jet, although a small
amount of white smoke is formed,

It is possible that the compound
NaHg,, which occurs with 66.7 mole %
mercury, is 1mportant in this rather
sudden change in combustibility with
composition. NaHg, is the most stable
of the sodium-mercury compounds. It
has a melting point of 360°C and a
heat of formation of 18.3
kcal/mole.

8. HEAT TRANSFER AND PHYSICAL PROPERTIES

H. F. Poppendiek

Reactor Experimental Engineering Division

The heat capacity of the LiCl-KCl
eutectic has been measured; in the
solid state it was found to be 0,23
cal/g °C, and in the liquid state,
over the temperature ramge 351 to
840°C, it was found to be 0.32 cal/g* °C.
The heat of fusion for this material
was approximately 64 cal/g. The heat
capacity of NaF-KF-LiF (11.5-42-46.5
mole %) was determined to be 0.41
cal/g* °C in the solid state and 0.45
cal/g °C in the liquid state over the
temperature range 475 to 875°C. The
heat of fusion for this material was

about 93 cal/g.

Preliminary viscosity measurements
have been obtained for two compositions
in the NaF-ZrF, -UF, system, that is,
53-43-4 mole % and 53.5-40-6.5 mole %.
These data were found to be very
similar to those previously obtained
for the 50-46-4 mole % mixture; for
the viscosity of the 6.5
mole % UF, composition varied from
about 16 cp at 580°C to 5.7 cp at
950°C. A preliminary study of NaF-
KF-UF, (46.5-26-27.5 mole %) indicated
that the viscosity varied from about
30 cpat 600°C to about 12 cp at 800°C.

example,

The density of NaF-ZrF,-UF, (53.5-
40.0-6.5 mole %) has been determined
over the temperature range 600 to
800°C. The densities of the pump seal
materials PeF,, NaBeF,, and NaZrF,
have been obtained over the tempera-
ture range -30 to 130°C. The density
of NaF-ZrF,-UF, (50-46-4 mole %) at

room temperature was also determined,

The thermal conductance of an in-
sulated safety-rod sleeve and the
thermal conductivity of the diatomaceous
earth insulation were measured; the
conductance was found to be 2.6
Btu/hr* ft* °F, and the thermal con-

ductivity of the insulation with
a density of 29 lb/ft? was 0,057
Btu/hr* ft* °F.

Measurements of the vapor pressures
of three compositions in the NaF-ZrF,
binary system have been completed.
While the vapor pressure rises quite
steeply with the ZrF, concentration,
the previously reported values were
considerably high, A summary of the
vapor pressures of several ZrF -bearing
fused salts is presented.

The analysis of all the heat trans-
fer data on NaF-KF-LiF eutectic in
Inconel has been completed. The re-
sults are in agreement with the pre-
liminary information previously re-
ported, namely, that heat transfer
data fall 50% lower than would be
expected for the specific system
being studied. This condition resulted
because of the presence of a thin
insoluble film composed mostly of
K;CrF, at the inner tube wall.

A series of wall to mixed-mean-
fluid temperature differences have
been measured in a forced-flow volume-
heat-source experiment over a range
of Reynolds and Prandtl moduli and a
range of volume heat sources of from
0.13 to 0.42 kw/cm®. The experimental
temperature differences obtained were

found te fall within +30% of the
theoretical values,

THERMAL CONDUCTIVITY

The thermal conductivity of densely
packed diatomaceous earth insulation
has been determined by measuring the
thermal resistance across an annulus
containing the material, These measure-
ments indicate a thermal conductivity
of 0.057 Btu/hr:ft*°F when the dia-
tomaceous earth 1s packed to a density
of 29 1b/ft®, In addition, development
of both the longitudinal and the flat-
plate thermal conductivity devices for
accurate, high-temperature measure-
ments has continued,

Diatomaceous Earth (M. W. Rosenthal,
J. Lones, Reactor Experimental Engi-
neering Division), An experiment was
performed to determine the thermal
conductivity of diatomaceous earth
in the annulus
walls of a

insulation contained
between the
safety-rod sleeve. The diatomaceous
earth had been tamped into the sleeve

concentric

annulus to increase 1ts density to
approximately 29 1b/ft?, The sleeve

had an inside diameter of 2.38 1in.,
an outside diameter of 3.00 in., and a
length of approximately 5 feet, The

thermal resistance of the sleeve was
determined by heating the inner surface
with condensing steam and by removing

heat at the outer surface with flowing
Determination of the heat flow
rate and the temperature difference
across the wall permitted calculation
of the resistance and, from that, the
thermal conductivity of the insulation.

The tube was divided into three
chambers by rubber stoppers, and dry
steam at atmospheric pressure was
supplied to each chamber, Measure-
ments were based on heat flow from the
center section; the other two chambers
served as guard heaters to eliminate
end effects, Various leadsinte the
system and between chambers provided

water,

for steam flow, condensate removal,
venting of noncondensing gases, and
temperature measurements, The tube

was centered in a length of standard
3 1/2-in. pipe,
through the annulus between the pipe
and the tube at a velocity of about
1 fps.

The resistances of the steam-side,
the water-side, and the metal walls of
the tube were negligible compared with
the resistance of the insulation.
Hence, the temperature difference
between the condensing steam and the
water was essentially equal to the

and water was passed

temperature drop across the insulation.
Although the steam temperature was
measured to ensure that it was super-
heated (and hence carrying no water
vapor), the condensation temperature
corresponding to atmospheric pressure

was used as the steam-side temperature.

The conductance of the sleeve per
foot of length, ¢/LAt (where g is heat
flow rate, L is length, and At is
temperature difference), was measured
at the mean temperature of the insu-
lation, that is, 140°F. The values
obtained are based on the middle 43 in.
of the length of the tube, From the
measured conductance (2.6 Btu/hr+ft* °F),
the thermal conductivity of the dia-
tomaceous earth insulation was calcu-

lated to be 0.057 Btu/hr- ft? (°F/ft).

CIRCULATING- FUEL HEAT TRANSFER

Reactor Experimental Engineering
Division

A series of heat transfer measure-
ments have been obtained from the
forced-flow volume-heat-source experi-
ment previously described. (1) This
system is shown in Fig. 8.6. The heat
generated electrically within the
flowing electrolyte in the test section
is transferred to an antifreeze coolant
in the heat exchangér., Mixed-mean
fluid temperatures, tube wall tempera-
tures, fluid flow rates, and external
heat losses were measured. The purpose
of this experiment was to measure the
radial temperature differences for a
range of Reynolds and Prandtl moduli
and to compare them with the calcu-
lations made by using the theory which
was previously developed, (1?)

Parameters were studied over the
following ranges:

5,800 < Re < 14,000 ,

4.6 < Pr < 8.7,

0.13 < W < 0.42 kw/cc ,

BIFLUID HEAT TRANSFER EXPERIMENTS
D, F. Salmon, ANP Division

The bifluid loop with a concentric
tube heat exchanger operated for
approximately 500 hours. Heat was
transferred from NaF-ZrF, -UF, (50-46-4
mole %) in the center tube to NaK in
the annulus, All structural material
in contact with the fluoride was
Inconel, except for several type 316
stainless steel parts in the sump.
The center tube was 0.135 in. ID with a
0.025-in. wall andL/D ratio of 587. The
fluoride Reynolds numbers ranged from
2000 to 3500. The inlet fluoride
temperature was maintained at 1500°F,
the axial temperature difference was
300 to 350°F, and the radial tempera-
ture difference was 100 to 125°F.

PERIOD ENDING SEPTEMBER 10, 1953

The fluoride heat transfer coef-
ficient was obtained from the over-
all coefficient by means of a Wilson
Plot, which was described in the
previous quarterly report(13) for
experiments with a larger diameter
heat exchanger tube. Figure 8.9 shows
the data for the tubes of both heat
exchangers compared with data obtained
from the Hausen equation. Except for
the run at lowest fluoride flows, good
agreement is obtained.

Visual inspection of the center
tube of the heat exchanger showed a
metallic deposit on the wall that was
approximately 10 mils thick near the
cold end, This deposit was similar in
appearance to the iron layer found in
the first heat exchanger, but it was
not so thick,

The effect of the observed deposit
was evident in the gradual reduction
of the over-all heat transfer coef-
ficient during the 19 days that the
loop operated. The total reduction in
the heat transfer coefficient was 16%
over this period, It is interesting
to note that a 10-mil layer of pure
iron inside the center tube would have
a thermal resistance only one tenth
that of the Inconel wall and would
make only a 2% change in the over-all
coefficient. This would indicate that
the observed deposit had a higher
thermal resistance than a 10-mil iron
layer.

A metallurgical examination is
being made to determine the extent of
corrosion and mass transfer. The
layer observed in the heat exchanger
tube was undoubtedly transferred by
the fluoride from the type 316 stain-
less steel pump to the nickel heat
exchanger tube (cf., sec. 6, “Cor-
rosion Besearch’). An Inconel pump
is being fabricated to obtain a mono-
metallic system in which galvanic mass
transfer will not be possible.

RADIATION DAMAGE

J. B., Trice, Solid State Division

A. J. Miller,

Additional studies were made on
fuel capsules irradiated in the LITR
and in the MTR. Improved remotve-
handling techniques were devised for
fuel sampling and weighing, and several
innovations were made in the methods
of material analyses. No evidence of
gross segregation of the uranium in
irradiated fuel was evident in this
recent work. Examinations of the
Inconel showed the
previously reported tendency toward
intergranular corrosion which does

capsule walls

not occur in unirradiated static tests,
but it cannot be assumed from the
evidence obtained to date that this is
due to radiation damage per se. Design
and construction of in-pile circulating
fuel loops are progressing. The in-
pile creep experiments performed to
date in the LITB show no serious effect
of radiation on the creep rate, and
construction of the equipment for
creep testing in the MTR is nearing
completion, Further details of these
and other radiation damage studies are
reported below, and complete data will
be available in the Solid State
Division semiannual progress report
for the period ending September 10,
1953, OBNL-1606.

In the past, chemical examination
of fuel irradiated in Inconel capsules
in the LITR and in the MTR had indai-
cated that the concentrationof uranium
was not uniform. There 1s evidence
that under the conditions of these
early tests some zirconium tetra-

ANP Division

fluoride was distilled from the fuel
into the free~space-portion of the
capsule and that the sampling procedure
may have been inadequate,

To avoid such uncertainties, a new
type of MIR test capsule has been used
which has only a small, high-tempera-

ture, vapor space above the molten
fuel. The sampling facilities have
been improved so- that the helium

atmospheres are more nearly pure and
the remote weighing is more accurate,
Facilities were also provided for
examination of specific core sections
of the salt by drilling successively
larger sections of the fuel column
from the capsule.

Analyses of Irradiated Fuel, Since
the new techniques were initiated,
five capsules containing NaF-ZrF -UF,
with various concentrations of UF, have
been analyzed for segregation data.
Four of these capsules were irradi-
ated in the MTR at 1500°F, and one
was a special control test with a
similar thermal history. The samples
taken from these capsules were analyzed
by two methods: (1) chemical analyses
with both potentiometric and polaro-
graphic techniques (analyses made by
the Analytical Chemistry Division),
and (2) mass spectrometry by the
isotope dilution technique (analyzed
by the Stable Isotope Division). The
data from these tests are presented in

Table 9.1. In experiments in which
several cores were taken from the
capsule, those labelled A were from

the center of the salt column, those
labeled B were the next sample out
from the center, etc. The data show
some scatter but no evidence of gross
segregation of uranium in the irradiated
fuels.

IN-PILE CIRCULATING LOOPS

Solid State Division

For the past several months, a
considerable amount of design and
construction work has been done on an
in-pile loop for circulating fluoride
fuel. Tt is planned to operate the
loop, initially, in the LITR to
demonstrate a properly functioning
system and to obtain test data at low
flux; then, the final experiments will

be performed in the MTR,

The design of the loop is such that
less than 1 ft of 1/4-in.-ID Inconel
tubing is in the highest flux portion
of the beam hole. The pumping rate is
on the order of 10 fps so that turbulent
flow is achieved, but, as a result,
AT is small, As it leaves the high-
flux region, the fluid will pass
through a large-capacity heat exchanger,
which can lower the temperature several
hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and through
the pump and an electrical heating
system, which can bring the fuel to
almost 1500°F before it is returned
to the high-flux region. Originally,
a small in-pile packed-sealed cen-
trifugal pump was to be used in these
experiments, but it now appears that
the only pump which can be
available in the near
gas-sealed centrifugal pump which must
be positioned outside the reactor
shield, This arrangement requires a
large volume of fuel with a corres-

made
future is a

pondingly high dilution factor, a
large amount of external shielding,
and the handling of a 15-ft radioactive
section of the loop.

Because of difficulties with the

dissolved in ethanol or ethanol-water

leached in 15% NaOH for 48 te 72 hr to
dissolve the beryllium oxide on the
walls, The solutions, both leach and
sodium for each capsule, were analyzed
for beryllium by the Analytical
Chemistry Division.

The beryllium oxide specimens were
protected from the atmosphere, during
and after removal from the capsules,
by immersion under oil. The sodium
and oil were removed from the speci-
mens by heating them to 800 to 825°C
for about 1 hr under vacuum- a cleaning
treatment similar to that used prior
to insertion of the specimens in the
capsules.

The specimens were weighed, and,
with one exception, they were found to
have slightly (0.2%) gained in weight.
To remove any possible sodium or Na,O
which might not have been removed
by the vacuum heating, the specimens
were soaked in water for seven to ten
days, heated ir vacuum again, and
reweighed. An average weight loss of
0.0005 g was found for both the

The work during this report period
has been concentrated on the determi-
nation of the effect of inert atmos-
pheres on the creep rate of Inconel
and the temperature dependence of the
creep rate during irradiation. One
test has been run at the stress and
temperature of the ARE pressure
vessel. The results reported from
LITR and Graphite Reactor cantilever
tests give no indication that serious
effects of irradiation on the creep
strength of Inconel may be expected,
although tests in the higher flux of
the MTR and further tests in inert
atmospheres will be required to
guarantee the strength of aircraft
reactor structures,

of EDTA buffered at pH 6.8 showed little
solubility effect on UF,; no change in
solubility with UF, was observed. It
is likely that EDTA can be used to
leach trivalent chromium and tetra-
valent uranium selectively from NaZrF_.
The major portion of the experi-
mental work with reactions involving
the use of bromine trifluoride for the
determination of oxygen in metallic
oxides was confined to alterations of

spectrophotometric procedures with the
inherent precision of the gravimetric
method, should greatly reduce the
actual time of determination. In the
differential method, the optical-
density scale 1s set at zero against
a blank of a reference standard, which
is a highly light-absorbant solution.
Greater concentrations of the given
component are then measured from this
zero point, In order to obtain the
amount of light required to adjust the
zero scale against the reference
standard, the spectrophotometer slit
is set at wider apertures than those
for normal use. For those systems
which conform to Beer’s law at wide
slit widths, the resultant optical
density readings are directly pro-
portional to the difference in con-
centration between the standard and
the unknown solutions.

A standard curve was prepared by
plotting the optical density of known
zirconium concentrations over the
range 1.0 to 1.5 mg per 25 ml against
the increase in concentration over
that of the reference solution, 1 mg
per 25 ml. This plot is a straight-
line relationship which indicates con-
formity with Beer's law. The method
was tested by taking a solution of
known concentration and determining
its concentration of zirconium from
the standard working curve, A practi-
cal test was then conducted by adding
known amounts of zirconium to a
synthetic ARE fuel. The data obtained
indicate that the precision of this
method compares favorably with that
of the mandelic acid gravimetric
me thod.

SUMMARY OF SERVICE CHEMICAL ANALYSES

Analytical Chemistry Division

A procedure was established for the
determination of uranium in the ARE
fuel concentrate, NaF-ZrF, -UF, (65-15-
20 mole percent), The procedure,
which was formulated in cooperation
with the Laboratory Division of Y-12

121
(L. A. Stephens, private communication
to J. C. White), 1s based on the
method reported by Voss and Greene,(7)
A 5-g sample was dissolved in HCI1-
HNO,; the small residue (about 100 mg)
was dissolved by fusing with potassium
pyrosulfate, The solutions were then
combined, converted to sulfate by
fuming with sulfuric acid, and passed
through a Jones reductor. Trivalent
uranium was oxidized to the quadri-
valent state by air. The completeness
of oxidation was observed by inserting
a platinum-calomel electrode couple in
the solution and noting when a constant
potential existed. A calculated
amount of potassium dichromate (NBS
standard) was added in slight excess
of that required to oxidize the uranium
quantitatively. This excess di-
chromate was then reduced with standard
ferrous ammonium sulfate solution,
The end point was detected potentio-
metrically by using the platinum-
calomel electrode couple. The standard
deviation was 0.16%, and the relative
standard error at the 95% confidence
level was 0.1%.

salt mixtures were effected to permit

INTRODUCTION AND SUMMARY

E. P. Blizard, Physics Division

The Bulk Shielding Facility (sec. 11)
has been used primarily for critical
experiments of reactor configurations
for the Tower Shielding Facility. The
Bulk Shielding Reactor is well suited
for this work because it 1s similar to
the Tower Shielding Reactor; also the
loading facilities for the two reactors
are similar. The calculated gamma
radiation reaching the crew compartment
of the divided shield appears to be
somewhat lower than that measured in
the Bulk Shielding Facility, presumably
because of limitations in the experi-
mental setup.

The Lid Tank Facility is being used
to measure removal cross sections, as
well as to examine specific shield
designs (sec, 12). In addition to the
measurement of the shielding efficiency
of part of the G-Eair-cycle reactor,
about 80 configurations of near-unit
shields for the circulating-fuel
reflector-moderated reactor have been
examined. Since these latter shields
are neither asymmetric nor dependent
upon much shielding at the crew
position, the Lid Tank Facility data
can be considered quite reliable.
Improvementsin the reflector-moderated-
reactor shield weights other than
those accruing from replacement af
water by a better hydrogenous material
will probably be small. The removal
cross sections of beryllium, fluorine,
and lithium were found to be 1,13,
1.36, and 1.44, respectively, The
removal cross section of uranium was
measured in conjunction with a study
of the effectiveness of uranium as a
shield material,

The Tower Shielding Facility is
taking shape; however, construction is
approximately one month behind schedule
(sec. 13). Most concrete work has been
completed and the towers are being
erected. Fabrication and/or procure-
ment of controls and instrumentation
have been initiated and should be
effected by the end of October. The
Safeguards Committee reviewed the
facility and requested only one change;
approval is expected subsequent to
a Committee inspection.

Although several shielding studies,
including the study of the spectrum of
neutrons attenuated by water and by
neutron streaming in iron, have
advanced the shielding art, the most
important contribution during this
quarter accrued from the Summer
Shielding Session (sec, 14). This
four-week study session, which was
attended by 18 representatives from
interested groups, was for the purpose
of standardizing shielding design
methods. In addition to achieving
this end, better methods for the
interpretation of bulk shielding data,
as well as the calculation of self-
absorption in the core, were obtained.
Perhaps the single most important
conclusion of the session was that the
large-scale tests planned for the
Tower Shielding Facility are urgently
needed for obtaining really reliable
shield weight estimates, The shielding
program at the Laboratory is being
realigned so that as many as possible
of the shielding uncertainties can be
studied with the facilities
available,

Testing of a series of critical

decrease in weight could be achieved
by this process.

During this quarter, two signifi-
cant improvements were made in the
materials and equipment used in the
Lid Tank tests. (1) The beryllium
pellet tank and beryllium slabs(3)
were replaced with a tank that con-
tained 11.5 in. of solid beryllium in
the form of small blocks. Reflector
coolant tubes were simulated, to some
extent, by the aluminum walls of this
tank and by some additional stainless
steel and aluminum. (2) The two dry
tanks used to contain the various com-
ponents in the first 54 configurations
tested were replaced by one large tank
partitioned to hold all the dry com-
ponents, including the new beryllium
tank, in one section and the borated
water in a second section. This ar-
rangement eliminated the spurious water
layers between the tanks.

After these improvements were made,
measurements behind many of the earli-
er configurations were repeated. The
gamma doses were found to be somewhat
higher, probably because of capture
gammas formed in the iron partition be-
tween the dry and wet sections of the
tank (Fig. 12.1) and because of an in-
crease of hard capture gammas in the
lead region as a result of the elimi-
nation of the water layers. The in-
sertion of boron-impregnated Plexiglas
(“plexibor”) between the lead layers
reduced the gamma dose to the levels
observed behind the original con-
figurations and confirmed the capture
gamma-ray hypothesis.

Gamma-Ray Attenuation Data. The
gamma-ray attenuation measurements for
configurations 16, 17, and 18 show the
effect of increasing the thickness of
the lead layer (Fig. 12.2). The
measurements on configuration 33 show
the effect of substituting tungsten
carbide for lead in the gamma shield.
On the basis of equivalent density,
2 in. of tungsten carbide pellets and
1/2 in. of steel (container walls)
should have had the same gamma attenu-
ation as 1.8 in. of lead. Actually,
the attenuation was only as effective
as 1.1 in. of lead. This indicates
that the high rate of capture or in-
elastic scattering gamma production in
tungsten reduces its value as a shield-

ing material when it must be used in a

Except for the two improvements
described above and the addition of a
3/16-in. plexibor slab behind the lead
slabs in the dry section of the tank,
configuration 59 was the same as con-
figuration 17. (Figure 12.1 is a sketch
of configuration 59; configuration 17
is similar to the configuration shown
in Fig.14.1 of ORNL-1556.¢*)) The longer
relaxation length in water fol lowing
configuration 59 (Fig. 12.2) indicated
an increase in the penetrating capture
gammas from lead and iron and a rela-

tive decrease in the softer water

capture gammas. Data taken behind con-
figuration 63 showed the effect of in-
serting four plexibor slabs into
configuration 59, one slab preceding
each 1.5 in. of lead slab in the gamma
shield. One heat exchanger tank was
removed to allow room for the plexibor
slabs. The gamma dose was reduced, but
the long relaxation length in the water
indicated that soft gammas from the
source or captures in the water did not
contribute importantly to the total
dose in either configuration 59 or 63.

Configuration 64 (data not presented
here) was the same as configuration 63
except that the number of heat ex-
changer tanks was reduced from three
to two. The result was an increase in
gamma dose of about 10% over that ob-
served behind configuration 63.

The gamma measurements for con-
figuration 66 (Fig. 12.3) show the
effect of adding 9.2 cm of beryllium
to the reflector thickness. It was
impossible in assembling this con-
figuration to place the fourth lead
slab with the other three in the first
dry tank compartment. Placing it in
the borated water tank increased the
effectiveness of the lead and tended
to mask the effects of the increased
reflector thickness; so configurations
65and 68 were tested without slab four
in the shield, leaving only 4 1/2 in.
of lead. Configuration 65 had 11.5 in.
of beryllium in the reflector, and
configuration 68 had 15.1 in. of
beryl lium,

Measurements behind configuration
72 (Fig. 12.3) show the effect of using
3 in. of natural uranium clad on each
side with 3/16 in. of plexibor as the
gamma shield. By logarithmic interpo-
lation, the natural uranium was found
to be as effective for attenuation as
4.7 in. of lead; however, on a density
basis, 3 in. of uranium would be ex-
pected to be equivalent to 5.15 in. of
lead.

The data for configuration 73, 74,
and 75 show the effect on the gamma

dose of borating the water in the
neutron shield. The addition of 1.2%
boron to the water eliminated a large
portion of the medium-hard capture
gammas in the water (Fig. 12.4) and
thereby reduced the gamma dose by a
factor of 2.7. This elimination of
water capture gammas leaves a harder
gamma spectrum {presumably from metal
captures), and consequently the attenu-
ation curve exhibits a longer relax-
ation length, Note also that the rear
wall of the borated water tank acts as
an increasing source of capture gammas
with a decrease in boron content,

In configuration 77 (data not pre-
sented here), two lithium-filled iron
tanks were substituted for the two
sodium fluoride-filled iron tanks,
which were used to simulate the heat
exchanger in configuration 64. This
substitution produced no measurable
change in the gamma dose.

Neutron Attenuation Data. Several
neutron attenuation curves are shown
in Fig. 12.5. Since changes in either
the heat exchanger or the lead region
had little effect on the neutron at-
tenuation, it appears from comparison
of the measurements behind configu-
rations 17 and 55 that the beryllium
reflector accounts for the greater
initial attenuation of fast neutrons.

Substitution of uranium for lead in
the gamma shield caused a noticeable
decrease in the neutron flux (Fig, 12.5,
configuration 72). A more systematic
study of the shielding properties of
uranium is discussed in a following
section, “Investigation of Shielding
Properties of Uranium.”

The effect of varying degrees of
water boration on the neutron flux is
shown in Fig. 12.6. From the data
taken outside the borated water tank,
it is evident that the boron content
affects only the thermal-neutron flux,
since its effect is quite well localized
in the borated region.

SHIELD INVESTIGATION FOR GE- ANP

A brief experiment was carried out
to determine the shielding efficiency
of the “transition section” in the
air-cooled R-1 reactor designed by
GE-ANP. This section is between the
reactor and the annular air ducts and
consists of alternate slots perpen-
dicular to the reactor surface for
cooling air and moderator water. A
mockup of the inlet annular duct and
the transition section was placed in
the Lid Tank Facility, and radiation
measurements were made along the source
axis and outside the duct (Fig. 12.7).
The measurements were then repeated
with the transition section replaced
by a rectangular box designed to pro-
vide the same amounts of air,
and aluminum.

The results, given in Figs. 12.8 and
12.9, show that the rectangular box
provided better shielding, in all

water,

cases, by a factor between 1.5 and 2.

It was therefore concluded that the
mockup of the complete R-1 shield, now
under construction for testing in the
Tower Shielding Facility, could be
made with the much simpler rectangular
design, and appropriate corrections
could be made to the resulting data.

INVESTIGATION OF SHIELDING
PROPERTIES OF URANIUM

Some information on the use of
natural uranium as a shielding material
has been obtained from measurements in
the Lid Tank Facility. A 3-in. uranium
slab was placed at various distances
from the source. In some of the measure-
ments, a thermal neutron shield of
boron was placed either on the source
side or on both sides of the uranium
slab. The thermal-neutron fluxes

the various configurations are recorded
in Table 12.2. Note the effect of the
boron shield (3/16-in. slabof plexibor)
on the production of fission neutrons
in the uranium. Gamma measurements
made when the uranium was not near the
source are of limited interest because
of the streaming of radiation around
the slab. In the data presented in
Table 12.3, this difficulty
was avoided by having the detector
close behind the uranium.

however,

Additional measurements on uranium
were made when it was substituted for
lead in the gamma shield region of the
mockups for the reflector-moderated
reactor shield (cf., ‘Beflector-
Moderated-Reactor Shield Tests,”
above). The decrease in the neutron
flux indicated that uranium has a
higher fast-neutron removal cross
section than either water or lead. As
is the case with all heavy elements,
uranium is not competitive with water
as a neutron shield because of its
much greater atomic weight. However,
if the capture and fission gamma pro-
duction of uranium could be held down
so that it would be a satisfactory
gamma shield, its neutron attenuation

characteristics could be used advan- 12.10). The measurements were taken

tageously. It should be noted, how-
ever, that these reflector-moderated
reactor measurements didnot constitute
a fair test of the effectiveness of
uranium as a shield. The slab was only
3 by 3 ft, an area which was not large
enough to intercept all the emerging
radiation, and there was considerable
streaming of gamma rays around the
slab. In one test, a yoke of lead
bricks was built around the top and
sides of the slab to somewhat reduce
this streaming.

REMOVAL CROSS SECTIONS

The previously reported effective
removal cross section of beryllium(?®?
has been confirmed by recent measure-
ments in the Lid Tank Facility (Fig.

behind a solid slab of beryllium 9.43
cm thick with a density of 1.84 g/cm?,
and they indicate a removal cross
section of 1,13 barns. This may be
compared with the earlier value of
1.12 barns for beryllium in the form

of pellets with an average density of
1.23 g/cmd.

The effective removal cross section
of uranium was calculated from data
taken in connection with the “Shielding
Effectiveness of Uranium’ study dis-
cussed above. Results are tabulated

in Table 12.4.

the current data, a value of 1.36 barns
1s obtained for fluorine. Measurements
with a considerably smaller sample of
the compound C,F,Cl have not been
completely reconciled with this figure,
as yet, These latter measurements
indicate a chlorine cross section of
only 1 barn, but it should be noted
that the chlorine has only a small
effect on the total molecular cross
section of this compound.

By using 1.36 barns for the fluorine
removal cross section and the previous
measurements on LiF, the removal cross
section for lithium was calculated to
be 1.44 barns. This should be con-
sidered as a tentative value until a
direct measurement on lithium is
available, since it is hard to recon-
cile the 1.44 barns with the Van de
Graaff measurements on the basis of
presently accepted theoretical con-
siderations.

The construction of the Tower
Shielding Facility is approximately
one month behind schedule because of
a general strike during the initial
construction phase and a later strike
which temporarily halted the steel
fabrication. However, the tower leg
foundations and guy anchors were com-
pleted in mid-July, and erection of
the tower steel was started by the
contractor on August 8. The steel is
being shop-welded in 45-ft sections
before delivery to the site, where the
sections are bolted in place at a rate
of approximately one per day. The
status of the construction of the
facility as of August 10, 1953 is
shown in Fig. 13.1.

~The reactor pool, the hoist founda-
tion pads, the 3000-ft radius exclusion
fence, and the access road have all
been completed. The water line, the
control building, and the hoist house
are 80, 30, and 10% complete, re-
spectively. Work has not yet been
started on the 600-ft radius fence or
on the power transmission lines.

The mechanical components of the
reactor are being constructed in the
ORNL Research Shops and are nearly
ready for assembly. Both the general
circuit diagram for the reactor con-
trols and associated interlocks and the
modification of the servo system for

the regulating rod are soon to be com-
pleted by the Reactor Controls Depart-
ment. Preliminary design of the
experimental instrumentation is come
pleted, and fabrication or procurement
of the necessary components is expected
to be accomplished by the end of
October.

The design of the crew compartment
tank 1s complete and the tank is
expected to be constructed by September
30. Items for the instrument positioner
in the crew compartment are being
fabricated in the Research Shops and
are approximately 65% complete. Final
assembly of the positioner is expected
by September 15.

The report{!) to the Reactor Safe-
guard Committee on the safety aspects
of the Tower Shielding Facility was
completed. The formal presentation
was made to the Safeguard Committee in
July, and the Laboratory has subse-
quently been advised that the facility
will be approved for operation subject
to one minor alteration. Final ap-
proval will not be given until the
facility has been built and has been
inspected by a member of the Safeguard
Committee.

NEUTRON SPECTRA

The spectrum of neutrons attenuated
by water has been calculated by Certaine
and others at NDA, with the use of the
NYU computer. The shape of the spectrum
they calculated differs from the shapes
of the spectra obtained from measure-
ments made at ORNL with the use of
both a recoil-proton spectrometer (?!?
and a nuclear plate camera, (?) A
maximum in the distribution function
at about 1 Mev appears in both sets of
experimental data, but it was not
evident in the NDA calculations. This
discrepancy may well be attributable
to the calculations being for neutron
flux, whereas the experiments measure
only the outwardly directed neutrons,
Since this difference was evident for
water slabs as thin as 5 cm, the
problem appears to be amenable to the
Monte Carlo type of calculations.
Accordingly, a small calculation of
this sort has been undertaken by one
operator with the use of a desk type
of computer. Although only 25 histories
have been followed thus far, one con-
clusion appears evident already. The
neutrons penetrate 5 cm of water
(oxygen was ignored) with less than
one collision, on the average, there
being relatively few much-collided
neutrons. The measurement may there-
fore be expected to give results which
are typical of uncollided flux; the
spectra obtained from the measurements
were consistent with this hypothesis.

Spectrum of the BSR, ORNL CF-53-5.105 (to be

NEUTRON STREAMING IN IRON

The unusually large transparency of
iron for neutrons of intermediate
energy has been ascribed alternately
to a minimum in its cross section at
24 kv and to a lack of inelastic
scattering in the low intermediate
energy region. The ‘““window” in the
cross section would allow a large un-
collided current to give rise to col-
limated streaming along thin

iron
pieces. To observe this “window”
effect, a large slab of iron was used

as a collimator and the collimation
was measured in air behind the iron.
Calculations of the expected flux
distribution beyond the air gap that
were based on the angular distributions
that would exist if diffusion is
responsible for the low iron attenua-
tion have failed to explain the large
collimation, The low attenuation is
therefore ascribed to the minimum in
the iron cross section, Thais
clusion has been confirmed by recent
work at Brookhaven National Laboratory
and by the early work of Langsdorf and
his collaborators at ANL.¢?®?

A summary report(*? of the session
will be issued. The nuclear-powered
airplane and its shields will be dis-
cussed schematically, with individual
treatment given to the reflector-
moderated circulating-fuel reactor,
the supercritical-water reactor, and
the direct-cycle reactor, to illustrate
the most important and the most diffi-
cult parts of the shield design. This
material was presented on the opening
day of the session to assist the
assembled members in applying them-
selves to the most important problems.

One of the members worked on corre-
lating the many recommendations and
reports concerning the radiation doses
which an operating crew should be
given. Since the information on this
subject is not in any sense complete,
the primary accomplishment was a

delineation of the information which
shield designers need; the importance
of obtaining the information at an
early date was indicated.

Considerable attention was paid to
interpreting bulk shielding measure-
ments and to drawing from them con-
clusions as to the doses to be expected
in an aircraft with a reactor. In this
connection, there were two significant
developments: one was the clarifi-
cation of earlier reactor leakage
calculations and shape transformations
that also gave first correction terms
which had not hitherto been published;
the other was an extension of another
method which was presented in the
report of the Technical Advisory Board
of 1950.¢%) This method and its ex-
tension, being entirely independent of
the transformation method, provides a
check on that method. Of the two
methods, it was determined that the
transformation method, which is the
more simple to use, is satisfactory
for almost all cases of interest.

For the calculations of heating in
shields and of air scattering and for
the evaluation of the more unusual
shielding materials, the more or less

standard theory was reported.

In the problem of neutron penetra-
tion of a hydrogenous crew-shield side
section, there appears to be rather
a wide difference between theory and
The only applicable
experiment was the air-scattering
experiment at the Bulk Shielding
Facility, and this gave a relaxation
length of 4.4 cm, whereas theoretical
estimates indicate about 8 cm. Tempo-
rarily, 5 cm was adopted, and strong
recommendations were made for further
