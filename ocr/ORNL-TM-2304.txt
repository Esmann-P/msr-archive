INTRODUCTION

The initial critical operation of the MSRE with 235 occurred on
June 1, 1965. The reactor was subsequently operated at various powers
up to 8 Mw for sustained periods and accumulated a total of 9005 equiva-
lent full-power hours with that fuel. The reactor loop was drained on
March 29, 1968 and preparations were started to replace the 235U-238y
mixture in the fuel salt with 2>>U. The test program that was conducted
with the 235U ig described in Reference 1. The purpose of this memo is

to outline the program that is to be followed with the 2337 loading.
OBJECTIVES

Since the MSRE will be the first reactor to be fuelled completely
with £337, there will be considerable interest in the initial critical
experiment. This experiment will provide additional data on the ade-
quacy of the calculational techniques used to predict the critical
uranium concentration in the MSRE. Comparison of the results with those
of the 235U critical experiment will also provide some indirect evidence
about the quality of the input nuclear data used for 2>2U., In addition
to the initial critical concentration, we will measure other basic nuclear
parameters of the system with 233y fuel ~— temperature and uranium-
concentration coefficients of reactivity, reactivity effects of fuel
circulation, and control-rod reactivity worth. In each case comparisons
will be made with the predicted values.

After the zero-power experiments, we will continue our studies of
the overall nuclear performance of the MSRE. Some changes, due to the
2337, are expected in the long-term reactivity behavior and in the dy-
namic response of the reactor. Extensive investigations will be carried

out in both these areas to compare the predicted and observed behavior.

In addition, we plan to use neutron fluctuation spectra as an operational
diagnostic aid, Some useful correlations were developed during the 235y
operation and it may be practical to use similar correlations to monitor
reactor performance. Of particular interest in the area of performance
tests will be a special experiment to measure the effective neutron yield
for 2337 in a molten salt reactor neutron spectrum.

Studies of reactor chemistry and materials behavior will be con-
tinued throughout the operation of the reactor system. Data will be
gathered on our ability to accurately monitor uranium inventory at low
concentrations as well as on the behavior of fission and corrosion pro-
ducts. The studies of the effects of exposing graphite and metal to fuel
salt, fission products, and radiation will also be continued.

The 233U fuel mixture will probably be used for all the remaining
operation of the MSRE. However, consideration is currently being given
to an interruption of that operation to permit substitution of a less
expensive secondary salt (sodium fluoroborate) for the LiF-BeFs mixture
in the system to demonstrate its operating characteristics. Since this
change is still being studied, the test program for that phase of opera-

tion will be defined later.
BASIC NUCLEAR TESTS

In addition to providing a check on the calculational techniques
used to predict the properties of the MSRE with 233y fuel, measurements
of these basic properties will supply much of the data that is required
for monitoring the subsequent behavior of the reactor. The on-line
reactivity-balance calculation requires, as input information, data on
control-rod worth, and various coefficients of reactivity. Where possible,
results of direct measurements of these properties will be used. In
other cases, (e.g. fission-product effects) calculated values will be
employed. Direct comparisons of calculated and observed values will be

useful in establishing confidence in quantities that cannot be measured.
233 Critical Experiment

Essentially all of the original uranium will be removed from that
portion of the fuel salt that is fluorinated. However, a small heel of
fuel salt (containing about 1.2 kg of the total U) will be left in a
fuel drain tank when the salt is transferred to the fuel storage tank for
processing. This uranium will be mixed with the fuel carrier salt before
the #337 critical experiment is started. Most of the plutonium and many
of the non-volatile fission products (notably samarium) that were produced
in the 235y operation will remain in the salt for the 223U operation,
Thus, the 2335 critical experiment will not be "clean" and corrections
for the effects of these contaminants will have to be made when the re-
sults are evaluated.

Except for a practice addition of about 0.8 kg of 23ey * all of the
uranium that is added in the critical experiment will have the isotopic
composition listed in Table 1. This uranium is available as the eutectic
salt mixture LiF-UF4 (73 - 27 mole %) in special cans containing up to
7 kg of total U. As in the initial #35U critical experiment, most of the
uranium will be added to the fuel salt in a drain tank (FD-2). At ap-
propriate intervals the reactor will be filled with the salt mixture
to follow the subcritical multiplication as the uranium concentration is
increased. After the fourth fill, the concentration will be close to the
critical value and subsequent uranium additions will be made with capsules

through the sampler-enricher to make the reactor critical.

Preparations for Fuel Loading

 

Since the 2337 mixture is heavily contaminated with 232y and the
last chemical purification of the uranium occurred some L years ago, the
enriching salt contains substantial amounts of the daughter products of

2327 decay. Several of these daughters are strong emitters of both alphas

 

*
The 2287 is added to adjust the isotopic composition of the mixture

for convenience in evaluating "alpha" for 2335 later in the operation of
the reactor.

and gammas, making the cans of salt strong neutron (from o,n reactions

in fluorine and lithium) and gamma radiation sources. In addition, the
carrier salt, to which the uranium must be added, is highly radioactive,
although it will contain essentially no volatile fission products. These
considerations require that shielded equipment be used for the uranium
additions to the drain tanks. Special charging equipment, using shielded,
remote-maintenance components, has been built and installed above fuel-
drain-tank No. 2 (FD-2), as shown in Fig. 1. This equipment permits the
transfer of single cans of enriching salt (containing no more than 7 kg
of U) from the shielded transport cask into the drain tank under shielded,
controlled-ventilation conditions. The empty cans are stored on a
turntable within the equipment for removal as a group at the end of the
drain-tank loading operations.

The nuclear reactivity of a drain tank containing 2337 fuel will be
somewhat higher than the same drain tank containing the 235U-238U mixture.
Although the drain tank is expected to be far subcritical under all normal
storage conditions, careful observations will be made during the fuel ad-
ditions to ensure that criticality is not approached in the tank. To
accomplish this, two neutron-sensitive chambers — a sensitive BF3 cham-
ber and an insensitive fission chamber to cover a wide range of counting

rates — will be installed just outside the drain tank for the loading ~~

operations. Since the fuel itself is an intense (~n) neutron source,
no external source will be required for neutron monitoring.

Neutron counting to observe the progress of subcritical multipli-
cation with the fuel in the reactor will be accomplished with the normal
reactor instrumentation in the nuclear-instrument penetration. For the
subcritical conditions we will use the high-sensitivity BF=s chamber and
the two movable fission chambers. Since the reactor cell will be covered
during the entire experiment, it will not be possible to install extra
chambers around the core. For the same reason the external neutron source
will remain fixed in the thermal shield throughout the experiment.
However, the intense internal neutron source will completely overshadow
the external source so that a movable source is of little value in this

experiment.

223 Loading Sequence

 

The bulk of the 23%U enriching salt will be added to the fuel carrier
salt through the special equipment attached to FD-2. We anticipate adding
about 34 kg of total U in L major steps. The first two rounds of ad-
ditions will consist of 21 and 7 kg U, respectively, and the subsequent
additions will be based on extrapolations of count-rate ratios obtained
from the preceding additions with the salt in the reactor. The objective
is to bring the uranium loading to within 1/2 kg of critical in this
manner. The enriching salt is available in cans of various sizes so that
arbitrary amounts can be added in 1/2-kg increments. The final uranium
additions will be made to the circulating loop in 98-gram increments
through the sampler-enricher.

The initial charging operation will require the addition of three
T-kg cans of uranium to FD-2. These cans will be delivered to the re-
actor site individually, in a shielded cask and inserted into the charging
equipment. The cans are designed to be remotely suspended in the gas
space of FD-2 above the liquid carrier salt. In this position the en-
riching salt will slowly melt and drip into the carrier salt below it.
During this time the can will be suspended from a weighing device so that

progress of the melting can be followed. (Gross and tare weights of each
can of salt will be available in advance.) At the same time we will
observe the increase in neutron count rate as the neutron source and sub-
critical multiplication increase. If the count rate increases too rapidly,
the can can be withdrawn to slow or stop the uranium addition. After the
addition, the empty can will be weighed more accurately, to ensure that

it is empty, and stored on the turntable for later disposal.

Prior to the addition of each can of enriching salt, one-half of
the carrier salt will be transferred to the adjacent fuel drain tank (FD-1)
to provide room for suspending the cans without contacting the salt. After
the addition of each can, the remaining salt will be returned to FD-2 for
mixing and to provide neutron count-rate data on the full tank. Extrapo-
lations of ratios of these count rates will be used in conjunction with
observations during additions to ensure that the drain tank remains sub-
critical. After the addition of the first can of U, the transfers to
FD-1 will also remove some uranium to keep Kopp very low during subse-
quent additions.

After three cans of enriching salt (21-kg U) have been added in this
manner, the mixed fuel salt will be loaded into the reactor. Neutron
count rates will be measured with the salt at several levels in the re-
actor vessel to ensure that criticality is not attained before the vessel
is full. (During salt additions, as in all filling operations, the three
control rods will be partly withdrawn so that they can suppress any pre-
mature criticality and initiate a salt drain.) Additional count-rate
date will be obtained before, during, and after circulation of the salt
in the loop. These data will be used for extrapolations to the pro-
Jected critical loading.

Since the 233U mixture provides such an intense internal neutron
source, count rates with the external source and no fuel are of little
value in this critical experiment. Therefore, the data obtained from
the first loop fill with uranium-bearing salt will be used as a basis
for the usual inverse-count-rate plots. Thus two loadings of predeter-
mined size (21-kg and T-kg) are required before extrapolations can be

made to establish the size of subsequent loadings.
The procedures described above will be carried out three more times
(with different numbers and sizes of 233y-salt cans) to bring the reactor
system within 1/2-kg of the critical loading. After the fourth loop
fill, the salt will remain in the loop and 98-gram additions of uranium
will be made through the sampler-enricher to make the reactor just criti-
cal at 1200°F with the fuel stationary and all control rods fully with-
drawn. The fuel salt will then be left in the loop for the remainder of

the zero-power and low-power tests.
Control-Rod Calibration

Although there will be no change in the basic configuration of the
reactor, the control rods in the MSRE will have about 30% more reactivity
worth with #330 fuel than with the original loading. Therefore, a com-
plete recalibration of the rods will be required before the reactor can
be returned to full operation. The basic approach to be used for this
work will be the same as that used for the original calibration.®,”

The fundamental measurements to be made are the differential worth
of one rod as a function of position with the other two rods withdrawn
to their upper limits. These measurements will use the rod-bump period
technique with the fuel salt stationary. The various critical positions
of the control rod in question will be obtained by adding uranium to the
salt to increase the amount of rod insertion. Since uranium can only
be added in increments of 98 grams, each capsule will increase the fuel
reactivity by about 0.12% sk/k, so about 24 capsules will be needed to
produce full insertion of one rod. As a consequence, rod sensitivity

measurements will be made after at least every second capsule addition.

Measurements may be made after each addition in regions where the rod
worth is changing rapidly. Integration of the differential-worth data
will then provide a curve of reactivity as a function of position for one
control rod.

The basic data will be supplemented by differential-worth measure-
ments with the fuel circulating, rod-shadowing measurements, and rod-drop
experiments to provide information on the reactivity worth of all three
rods as a function of configuration. All of the data will be used to
evaluate coefficients in a theoretically derived expression of rod worth
that is amenable to evaluation by a digital computer. This expression
will then be used (as it was during the £35 operation) by the on-line
computer to calculate control-rod poisoning from the positions of the

three rods.

Other Basic Nuclear Parameters

233) concentration Coefficient of Reactivity

As excess 237U is added to the loop to bring the concentration to
the operating value and calibrate the control rods, data will be col-
lected to evaluate the reactivity effect of the excess uranium, These
data will be reduced to a uranium-concentration coefficient of reactivity
to be used in evaluating the effects of burnup and subsequent fuel

additions.
Isothermal Temperature Coefficient of Reactivity

When the initial set of fuel additions has been completed, an experi-
ment will be performed to measure the isothermal temperature coefficient
of reactivity of the reactor. In this experiment the fuel loop tempera-
ture will be slowly varied between about 1150°F and 1225°F while the
control-rod configuration required to keep the reactor just critical is
recorded. The observed reactivity change will be corrected for any ef-
fects due to changes in the circulating void fraction with temperature
to obtain the total (fuel + graphite) temperature coefficient of reac-

tivity.
10

Power Coefficient of Reactivity

In the MSRE, a power coefficient of reactivity is used to describe
the reactivity effect of the change in steady-state temperature distri-
bution in the core that accompanies a change in power level. The value
of this coefficient depends on the mode of temperature control (the re-
actor outlet temperature is held constant on this reactor) and the magni-
tudes of the separate fuel and graphite temperature coefficients of re-
activity. Since the detailed temperature distribution in the core cannot
be measured directly, the power coefficient will be inferred from the
observed change in control-rod configuration with power after steady-
state temperatures are achieved and before there has been a significant
change in fission-product poisons. Observations will be made at several

levels during the approach to full power to obtain a best value.
REACTOR OPERATION WITH £23U FUEL

After the initial tests to investigate the physics of the MSRE with
233g, the reactor will be operated at power to continue the studies of
its long-term behavior. Some special tests wlll be required to prepare
for extended operation and others will be used to demonstrate the con-

tinuing satisfactory performance.
Power Calibration

The instantaneous indication of reactor power for the servo control
and safety instruments is derived from neutron-sensitive chambers in the
nuclear instrument penetration. Since the ratio of power level to neu-
tron flux in the penetration may change with the new fuel, all the cham-
bers will be repositioned as required to eliminate any inconsistencies.
The reference standard for repositioning the chambers will be the heat-
power of the reactor calculated by the on-line computer from overall
system heat balances, Fach of the compensated and uncompensated ion
chambers will be individually positioned to give a direct readout of re-
actor thermal power. In the case of the wide-range counting channels it

may be necessary to modify the function generators that operate on
11

chamber position to obtain consistency over the entire power range.
After all the chambers have been shifted, they will be rechecked to elimi-
nate any mutual shadowing effects.

Special precautions will be observed in moving the uncompensated
chambers that serve as inputs to the flux safety system. Only one chamber
at a time will be moved under strict administrative control and the other
two chambers will be watched carefully to ensure that they are not ad-

versely affected by the one that is moved.
Control Systems Tests

The reactor control systems (flux, temperature, and load) were tested
under a variety of conditions with #3°U fuel to demonstrate their ade-
quacy.? A similar series of tests will be performed with the #37U fuel.
However, this time the main emphasis will be on the reactor servo con-
troller, flux servo at low power and temperature servo at powers above
1 Mw. (The load-control system will not be affected by the change in
fuel.) Both the steady-state behavior and the response to perturbations
will be examined. Calculations, analog-simulator studies, and measure-
ments on the MSRE indicated that, at most, the high-frequency gain of the
flux servo may have to be adjusted slightly for satisfactory performance
with 23%y, (Reference 5) If such changes are made, the pertinent tests

will be repeated to demonstrate the adequacy of the final system.

Reactor Dynamics

The dynamic behavior of the MSRE with 235U fuel was the subject of

6,7 A comparable

extensive theoretical and experimental investigation.
theoretical analysis of the dynamics with 2337 has been performed and
the results indicate that the reactor will be inherently stable at all
powers .® The purpose of the dynamics tests is to provide another veri-
fication of the calculational techniques.

As with the 25U operation, various dynamic tests will be performed
at zero power and during the approach to full power, Follow-up tests at
power will be performed periodically to prove the persistence of proper
behavior. In general, the tests will include pulse and step reactivity
perturbations with a control rod as well as pseudorandom binary and

ternary perturbations of control-rod position and flux demand.
Reactivity Balance

Reactor operation with 235 demonstrated the utility of an on-line
reactivity balance as an operating guide.® The same type of calculation,
with appropriate changes in coefficients, will be used during the 2333
operation.

Detailed experiments during the last operation with 2357 showed
that the current calculation does not adequately treat the xenon poison-
ing. Variations in system temperature and pressure induce changes in

xenon poisoning by affecting the effectiveness of the gas stripper.

These changes are of secondary interest in the MSRE because most of the
reactor operation is at a fixed temperature and pressure. However, since
a detailed understanding of the xenon behavior is important to the
breeder programs, an attempt will be made during the £330 operation to
modify the mathematical model to incorporate temperature and pressure
effects. It may be necessary to conduct additional experiments to supple-

ment the available data in order to accomplish this improvement.
Application of Noise Analysis

In the course of operating the MSRE with #75U, a large amount of
data was collected on the spectral density of the inherent neutron-level
fluctuations in the reactor. Evaluation of these data indicates that
changes in the flux "noise" spectrum are a good qualitative indication
of changes in the circulating void fraction in the fiuid fuel. Neutron
noise data will be collected routinely to monitor this aspect of reactor
operation and to look for any other changes in system performance. At-
tempts will also be made to make the void indication more quantitative.

Techniques have been developed to use the BR-340 computer at the
reactor site to collect neutron-noise data (with all other computer
functions inhibited) and process it immediately thereafter (with all
other functions active). Thus, spectral-density results can be made
available with very little delay for use as an operating guide if
satisfactory correlations are developed. The same techniques may be
used to monitor the vibration spectra from mechanical components if

adequate data samples can be obtained.
Measurement of 233U Capture to Fission Ratio

An important factor in the breeding performance of molten salt re-
actors is the ratio of parasitic neutron captures to fissions ("alpha")
in #37U in the reactor neutron spectrum. In current reactor design cal-
culations, this ratio is obtained, in effect, by integrating differ-
ential cross sections over the neutron-energy spectrum. A precise
measurement of the integral value of "alpha" in a neutron spectrum typi-

cal of molten-salt reactors could reduce the uncertainty in the breeding
1h

performance of new core designs. Since the neutron spectrum in the MSRE A
with 2330 fuel is very similar to that in the proposed breeders, a pre-

cise measurement of "alpha" will be made during the 233g operation. The i
measurement consists of precise uranium isotopic assays before and after

substantial 23%U burnup. The value of "alpha" is derived from the build-

up of #34y relative to the depletion of Z27U,

CHEMICAL AND MATERIAL STUDIES IN THE FUEL LOOP

A major objective in the operation of the MSRE is to study the be-
havior of the basic materials — molten salt, graphite, and Hastelloy-N —
in combination in a radiation environment. These studies are accomplished
primarily through the examination of samples of the appropriate materials.
A high level of effort will be maintained in this area throughout the

operation of the reactor.
Surveillance of Corrosion and Salt Contamination

The most direct monitor of Hastelloy-N corrosion that is readily
available in the MSRE is the level of chromium in the fuel salt. Chro-
mium, leached from the surface of the metal remains in solution in the
salt where its concentration can be measured in samples. In the first
three years of reactor operation, the chromium in the fuel salt increased
from ~ 38 ppm to ~ 80 ppm. If this is interpreted in terms of uniform
attack on the fuel loop the increase represents leaching from less than
0.3 mil of metal. This low rate of attack is expected to continue but
salt samples will be analyzed regularly to detect any changes.

The processing of the fuel salt to remove the 235 will require the
establishment of a new baseline of chromium concentration. Fluorination
of the salt in the fuel storage tank will substantially increase the
Cr (also Fe and Ni) level. However, most of this will be reduced to free
metal and filtered out in subsequent steps before the processed fuel is
returned to the drain tanks. The resultant chromium concentration will

be measured in samples taken at the start of the 233y operation.
15

Another salt contaminant that is carefully monitored is oxygen. The
oxide tolerance of the MSRE fuel mixture is ~ 700 parts per million but
observed concentrations have been around 50 - 60 ppm. Samples will be
analyzed regularly to ensure that oxygen intrusion remains at a low

level.
Surveillance of Uranium Inventory

The chemical concentration of uranium in the fuel salt for the =75U
operation was about 4.6% by weight. At this level the standard deviation
of all the uranium chemical analyses was 0.02 wt. The average ana-
lytical concentration at the end of that operation was such that the
apparent uranium inventory was within 200 gm (out of 222 kg) of the book
inventory derived from known additions and depletions.

In the 233y operation, the chemical uranium concentration will be
only about 0.7 wt%. It appears that average values of analytical results
will provide the necessary data for precise, long-term comparisons of
"book" and observed uranium inventory. However, improvements in pre-
cision are under development and will be required to permit short-term
comparisons using individual results, In general, reactivity-balance
results will be used in conjunction with the uranium analytical results

to monitor the short-term behavior of the system.
Fission-Product Behavior

Several aspects of fission-product behavior are of particular
interest in the MSRE. These include the deposition of noble-metal species
on graphite and Hastelloy surfaces, the escape of some noble metals as
"smoke" or "Gust" in the reactor offgas, and the escape of other volatile
species (Xe, Kr, Te, etc.).

Much information has been collected about the behavior of fission
products in this system but more is required for a thorough understanding

and evaluation. Therefore, considerable effort will be expended during

the remaining operation of the reactor in analyzing the fuel salt and
reactor offgas to elucidate the fission product behavior. To aid in
this effort special samples of salt and cover gas will be withdrawn
through the fuel sampler, In addition, use will be made of the offgas
sampler and of special instrumentation and collection devices installed
in the reactor offgas line at the fuel pump. Selected specimens of
metal and graphite that are exposed in the reactor core will be examined
to provide more data on fission-product plateout on surfaces and in-~
trusion into graphite,

The circumstances under which various samples must be obtained will,
to some extent, influence the power operation of the reactor. For ex-
ample, it may be desirable to take some samples while the fuel salt is
stationary, in which case the reactor must be at zero power. In other
cases, prolonged operation at power will be required to reach steady-
state conditions with regard to particular fission products. A complete
shutdown will be required to remove specimens from the core or the off-

gas line.
Graphite and Hastelloy Surveillance

Graphite and Hastelloy surveillance specimens are exposed to fuel
salt in the MSRE core and other Hastelloy specimens are suspended just
outside the reactor vessel. The primary purpose of these specimens is
to study radiation and salt-exposure effects under reactor conditions;
however, they have also been used in connection with some of the fission-
product studies. Selected specimens are removed for examination at
approximately six-month intervals and replaced with new ones. Since such
changes are major operations, they are normally scheduled to coincide
with other major reactor shutdowns.

The first sets of samples installed in the MSRE were representative
of materials actually used in the construction of the reactor system.
Since that time continued development effort has led to other graphites of
interest and to minor changes in the composition of Hastelloy-N. Conse-
quently, subsequent arrays have included samples of some of these materials.
This surveillance program is expected to continue for the operating life

of the reactor.
