Abstract

 

The present report summarizes the work that has been done in the search
for an aqueous solution suitable for use in a thorium breeder blanket Some
of the work has been previously reported in HR P and Chemistry Division
Quarterly Reports, but data concerning the basic nitrate system and the
phosphate-nitrate system are reported here for the first tame. It has been
felt desirable to summarize all the work in this report so that an

overall-picture may be had of the exploratory work that has been done to date
Thorium Nitrate-lJater System

 

The system thorium mtrate-water has been studied by Templeton(l) from

20° ¢ to 160° C and by Marshall, Gill, and Secoy(2) from 20° ¢ to 211° ¢

Above 130° C mitrogen oxides are liberated and basic thorium oxide 1s preci-
pitated However, in a closed system the vapor phase appears to equilibrate
with the liquid phase, and the system in this form does not show precipitation
until a temperature of about 230° C 1s reached for systems contaiming 80-90%
thorium nitrate by weight The experimental data indicate that a solutaon of
thorium nitrate containing 1000 g Th/l wall be stable in the temperature range
120° ¢ to 230° C and that solutions containing lower concentrations of thorium

will be stable from room temperature to the 100-230° ¢ range,

Effect of Excess Nitric Acid on the Thorium Nitrate-Water Systems

Marshall and secoy(3) investigated the effectiveness of excess nitric
acid in preventing hydrolysis of thorium nitrate solutions at high tempera-
tures, Solutions with NO3/Th ratios of 3 95, 5.47, and 6 65 were prepared
in concentrations that varied from 20 to LOO g Th/l, The first mole of
excess nitrate caused the greatest elevation in precipitation temperature,
while the vapor phase coloration was much greater per unit change of mitrate
after the imtial four moles were added to the thorium. Crystalline solids
appeared in the concentrated regions, the composition of which may have
corresponded to acid salts The crystalline compounds were reversible in
solubility over the time of the experiments as contrasted to the apparent
irreversibility in the solubility of the hydrolysis products Solutions
containing LOO g Th/1 with NO3/Th ratios of 5.47 and 6 65 were stable to

temperatures between 300 and 340° c.

Effect of Excess Base on the Thorium Nitrate-dater System

 

A series of experiments was performed by Lietzke and Marshall to determine
whether solutions in which the thorium had been partially hydrolyzed would be
stable at higher temperatures, The partial hydrolysis was accomplished in two
ways (1) by the addition of L10H to a stoichiometric thorium m.trate solution,
and (2) by precipitating thorium hydroxide and dissolving the precipitate
in less than the stoichiometric amount of mitric acide

Table 1 shows the results obtained with thorium nitrate solutions that
had been partially hydrolyzed by the addition of In0H The effect of fluoride
both on the partially hydrolyzed and on the stoichiometric thorium mitrate

solutions 1s also shown The rate of heating in each case was 25° C/mine

The second method of preparing partially hydrolyzed thorium nitrate
solution consisted in precipitating thorium hydroxide from diluted aliquots
of thorium nitrate solution by saturation with ammonia gas The thorium
hydroxade was washed by centrifugation and decantation, then dissolved in
sufficient concentrated nitric acid to gave a NO3/Th ratio of 2 20 The thorium
concentration was varied from 200 g Th/1l to 1000 g Th/l, Table 2 summarizes the

data obtained upon heating these solutions at temperatures of 70° ¢ and 80° Ce

In all cases the precipitates did not redissolve upon cooling to room
temperature, When HF was added to the solutions to give a F/Th ratio of
1,0 precipitation occurred upon standing at room temperature The precipi-

tate would not redissolve upon heating.
 

Tho,=H3P0) ~H0 System

 

The marked solubility of ThOs or Th3(P0O),) in concentrated phosphoric
acid and the low neutron cross-section of phosphorus favor the consideration
of the ThOo-H3PO), system as a possible breeder blanket solutaon(l),

Although apparently stable phosphate solutions containing up to 1100 g Th/1

with PO),/Th ratios of 5 to 7 could be prepared, the high viscosities of these
solutions leave considerable doubt as to their applicability. However, solutions
containing a PO)/Th ratio of 10 with a total Th concentration of 400 g/1 are
stable at 250°~300° C and have a viscosity little higher than that of
concentrated phosphoric acid,

A series of experiments was performed(>) in an effort to lower the
viscosity of the thorium phosphate solutions containing the P0),/Th ratios of
5 to 7 without at the same time decreasing the thorium concentration. It
was found that some concentrated hydrofluoric acid can be added to the
concentrated H3PO), mxture but that precipitation occurs before any signifi-
cant improvement in properties becomes evident, dissolving ThF), an HPO),
appears to gave a similarly viscous mixture at PO},/Th ratio of 5, Solutions
in HyPO3F seem to act simlarly to those in H3PO), with no improvement in
solubility or viscosity. Adding HpSO) to H3P0),=Th3(PO),)), mixtures lowers
the solubility under otherwise similar conditions and appears to offer no

advantages.

From the data in Table 3 1t appears that the ThO2-H3P0),~HNO4 system 1s
stable at elevated temperatures only in the presence of concentrated H3PO},o
In all cases the precipitates did not redissolve upon cooling to room

temperature

Thorium Systems Involving S0),* and p-(5)

 

Preliminary results on dissolving Th(OH)), in an HF-HpSO), mixture, containing
one HF and one and one half HpSO), molecules per molecule of Th(OH)), indicated
a "solubility of about 200 g Th/l. (There was evidence for the presence of
a colloid.) Immediate dissolution occurred followed by slow precipitation.
Changing the F~/50),%/Th(1V) ratios while maintaining stoichiometric neutrality
showed no improvement in solubility. It was also found to be impossible to
prepare similar solutions containing higher concentrations of thorium (LOO and

600 g Th/1). The pH of all the supernatant solutions indicated that some

hydrolysis occurred during the precipitation A solution made up to contain
50 g Th/1 as the nitrate plus one mole of HF, one of HNO3s and one and one half
of HpS50), per mole of thorium showed some precipitation on standing a few days.

No hydrolysis would be expected to occur in this solution,

Thorium Systems Involving S0),~ 5 50), Int, and Mette

 

A large number of exploratory tests with various combinations of thorium
sulfate or thorium selenate with lithium and magnesium salts of the same anions
have indicated

(1) The addition of the lithium or magnesium salt increases the solubility
of the thorium salt at 25° C but not to a very great extent, The maximum
amount of thorium that can be kept in solution 1s of the order of 100-150 g¢ Th/1,

(2) In all cases thorium selenate 1s more soluble than the sulfate,
but not sufficiently more so to compensate for the higher neutron cross—section
of selenium,

(3) At temperatures above 100° © the solubility of the Th salts decrease
rapidly The formation of precipitates and their dissolution at room
temperature are both slow, There 1s a strong possibility that the "solutions"
at 25° C are actually metastable and that, in time, much of the thorium would
precipitate

(4) At 13° ¢ a solution of thorium sulfate may be prepared containing
19 g Th/1000 g HoO This 1s the maximum solubility of thorium sulfate in

waters

Conclusions
(1) of the systems investigated only two, the Th(NO3)), * excess HNO3
and the Th3PO),)), + H4PO), with a P0),/Th ratio of 10, have both the necessary
thermal stability and desirably low vascositye
(2) From the standpoint of neutron capture cross=section the Th3(PO),) 3 -
H3PO), system 1s perhaps satisfactory In the case of the Th(NO3)), system
4

separated No isotope would have to be used. Dog w !!
/

(3) There 1s no present evidence that corrosion in the mtrate system od

would be intolerable However, the phosphate system attacks both Ti and Zr
at relatively low temperatures and no satisfactory container is yet known
for this system A more thorough study of the corrosion properties of the
solutions should be made,

(4) The radiation decomposition of nitrate (including the products
formed under varying conditions) appears to be the most important unknown
concerning the nitrate system, A preliminary experiment by Bidwell of
Los Alamos using a uranyl phosphate = H3PO), solution containing enriched y235
in the LITR showed no gross decomposition of phosphate 10m.

(5) whenever hydrolytic phenomena seem to be responsible for precipitation
in thorium systems the time factor 1s very important, Solutions which seem to
be stable at higher temperatures on short time heating usually show precipl=
tation upon being held at mich lower temperatures for a longer period of time

(6) on the basis of the rather extensive survey that has been made 1t
seems unlikely that any thorium systems other than the two mentioned will be
found that satisfy both the thermal stability and low neutron capture cross-
section requirements, However this statement cannot be made with certainty

unless a thorough phase study 1s made of some of the systems investigated,
