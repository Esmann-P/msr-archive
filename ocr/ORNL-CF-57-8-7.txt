PREFACE

In Septenber, 1956, a group of men experienced in various scientific
and. engineering fields embarked on the twelve months of study which culmi-
nated in this report. For nine of those months, formal classroom and
student laboratory work occupied their time. At the end of that period,
these nine students were presented with a problem in reactor design. They
studied it for ten weeks, the final period of the school term.

This is a summary report of their effort. It must be realized that,
in so short a time, a study of this scope can not be guaranteed complete
or free of error. This "thesis" is not offered as a polished engineering
report, but rather as a record of the work done by the group under the
leadership of the group leader. It is issued for use by those persons
competent tO assess the uncertainties inherent in the results obtained in
terms of the preciseness of the technical date and analytical methods
employed in the study. In the opinion of the students and faculty of
ORSORT, the problem has served the pedagogical purpose for which it was
intended.

The faculty joins the authors in an expression of appreciation for
the generous assistance which various members of the Oak Ridge National

laboratory gave. In particular, the guidance of the group consultant,
A. P. Fraas, is gratefully acknowledged.

ABSTRACT é

For marine applications a circulating fuel, fused fluoride salt reactor
system appears to offer a substantially reduced specific weight (lbs per shaft
horsepower) over current and planned reactor systems, Such a weight reduction
would meke nuclear power feasible for surface ships smaller than 7500 tons
displacement, the current minimum for pregent and proposed reactor systems,
as well as overall performance improvements for larger vessels.
Keeping within the bounds of currently available technology and proven
practices, reactor-steam system capable of developing 35,000 SHP with an v
overall specific weight of approximately 6./ 1bs/SHP is indicated. The §
particular installation of this system aboard a 931 class destroyer of 3-4000
tons displacement was found feasible, When this system is used in conjunction
with the conventional steam system to provide ‘fuel-oil for shielding, an
overall reactor plant weight of 54 lbs/SHP is realized,
In addition, the future potential of this design concept was investigated
utilizing unproven but indicated feasible technology advancements, Specific

weights on the order. of 54 1lbs/SHP were ‘found possible in this power range .

1.0 SUMMARY, DESCRIPTION AND GONGCLUSIONS

1, Introduction
This report covers a study of the feasibility of a high performance
marine reactor (HPMR) utilizing a circulating fuel, fused salt reactor concept,
The definition of high performance as considered in this report is low
specific weight in terms of total power plant weight per shaft horsepower ,
By significantly decreasing specific weight below that which is currently
found feasible with present and proposed systems, reactor installations on
a lighter class of ships is now possible, This would also offer potential
improvements for all heavier classes,
A design study was made for a reactor system of this type to power a
931 class destroyer of 3-4000 tons displacement. The reactor and steam
generating equipment simply replaced one of the present boiler rooms on
this class ship and duplicated the steam conditions (950°F, 1200 psig)
supplied to the propulsion machinery. An overall specific weight of 59 1lbs/SHP
was achieved for the 35,000 SHP delivered per boiler room. This is comparable
with the presently installed oil-fired system including fuel, This speci-
fic weight was achieved with a reactor and steam generating equipment overdesign
of approximately 30%, Indications are that if time had allowed a reiteration
of the system size to the 10% overdesign factor used in most reactor systems,
a specific weight reduction to at least 54 lbs/SHP would have been achieved,
These specific weights, which are approximately one half that of any planned
system, were brought about by obtaining a small reactor package to minimize
shielding and combining this with the production of high temperature steam

to give good steam plant efficiency,
wl 6m

The initial basic study incorporated a single intermediate loop utilizing
another fused salt {also compatible with water) to transfer the heat from the
fuel to the steam generator and superheater. This prevented activation of
the steam and through the use of blenders the temperature of the salt entering
the steam generator was reduced substantially to decrease the problem of
' thermal stress, However, this required that secondary shielding be placed
about the large volume of the steam generating equipment, It was found that
through the use of two intermediate loops the amount of secondary shielding
could be reduced and the overall specific weight released from 58 to the 54
1bs/SHP, The comparable reduction for the case with 30% overdesign is from
65 to 59 1bs/SHP, Unfortunately sufficient time was not available to allow
as detailed a study as that given to the single intermediate loop system,

Considerable use and reference has been made of the ANP studies and
experimental work carried out at ORNL on fused salt reactors. This has
allowed demonstrated components and materials to be incorporated directly

into this plant,

1.2 Reactor

In order to achieve the primary overall objective of reduced specific
weight it is desirable to keep the reactor size as small as possible in order
to minimize not only reactor weight but that of the primary and secondary
shielding as well, The compact reactor selected was cylindrical in shape with
the fuel circulating up through a central critical region and then down through
en anmular downcomer at its periphery containing the primary heat exchangers
(fuel to secondary fluid). The core is moderated by cylindrical rods of
beryllium oxide clad with Inconel that are equispaced throughout the core region,

A nickel reflector surrounding the core plus an additional blanket black to
=17=

thermal neutrons shield the primary heat exchanger and prevents excessive
activation of the secondary fluid,

Because of the inherent stability that has been demonstrated with
reactors of this type, poison rods are not needed for control but a single
rod is placed at the core centerline to provide for reactor shutdown, mean
temperature change, and fuel burnup,

The reactor and steam generating system were designed to produce 125 MW
which is a conservative overdesign of greater than 25%, This safety factor
is considerably larger than felt necessary but was brought about by the
necessity of starting the reactor design before the details of the steam
_ system became available,

An average core temperature of 1225°F with an 100°F difference across
the core was selected as a compromise of weight and thermal efficiency against
corrosion and thermal stress problems,

The neutron flux spectrum is largely intermediate giving rise to a
fission distribution of 28% thermal, 63% intermediate and 9% fast.

~The nickel reflector tends to hold up the thermal flux spectrum at the
outer edge of the core and helps to provide the favorable peak to average
power distribution of approximately 1.4. The power density averaged over
the core is 360 vatts/cn.

The reactor vessel itself is approximately 6,7 ft in diameter and 6,7
ft nigh. An expansion tenk for the fuel is incorporated into the head design
along with provisions for removing Xenon and other fission product gases. Three
fuel pumps are also located in the reactor head in a mamer such that they may
be replaced aboard ship, The reactor head is removable by unbolting and cutting

a small omega type seal weld, This allows replacement of the primary heat
=18=

exchangers and inspection of the core assembly, However, it is recommended
that the reactor be removed from the ship prior to this operation in order

to reduce the remote handling costs and problems. Also the feasibility

of balancing the cost of discarding complete reactor assemblies against that
of the design and operation of a remote handling facility should be thoroughly
investigated with the idea of reducing both overall costs and simplification
of the basic reactor design,

The primary reactor shield is made up of structural support steel along
with approximately 5 inches of lead and 39 inches of water, The shield
requirements are based mainly on the fission product and sodium decay gemma's
and the delay and fission neutrons in the outer ammular region containing
the primery heat exchangers. These activities were found to be several
order of magnitudes greater than the prompt gamma and neutron radiation from
the core,

The secondary shield for the basic study enveloped both the reactor and
the steam generating equipment and incorporated a thickness of approximately
4 = 6=1/2 inches of leed. This requirement is a direct function of the
activation :of the sodium ions in the secondary fluid as it passes through

the primary heat exchangers.

1.3 Fuel and Secondary Fluid
In the selection of a fuel for this system, in addition to simply

selecting a carrier for a critical amount of uranium, primery emphasis was
placed on choosing one that had been proven acceptable, This included its
chemical stability, corrosion, nuclear, and physical properties. This selection

was rather easily made since a largs number of salts have been investigated
=19-

by ORNL and only a few found promising emough to warrant additional testing,

A solution of sodium, zirconium and uranium fluorides was selected on
the basis of reasonable nuclear and physical properties and because it had
been used successfully in a reactor experiment (ARE), Also, extensive
investigations have been made on its corrosion and physical properties in
anticipation of its use in the Aircraft Reactor Test (ART), The vapor
pressure of this salt is typically very low so that at operating temperatures
the reactor vessel has to be pressurized only slightly to prevent pump
cavitation, The actual composition of the fuel selected, closely approximating
that of the ART except for exact uranium concentration, is 49% NaF, 45% uF),
and 6% UF, {mole percent).

Uranium will be added to the system in the form of (NaF), UF, Pellets
or dissolved solution of this salt would be added during operation of the
reactor to compensate for uranium burn-up and to override fission product
and corrosion poisons. It is anticipated that sufficient addition of fuel
may be made throughout the life of the reactor to eliminate the necessity
of replacing the original salt loading.

A basic ground rule requiring chemical compatability of the fuel, secondary
fluid, water and sea water was established, In view of this coupled with
corrosion, heat transfer, radiation and chemical stability requirements, the
selection of possible choices was narrowed down to a fused salt, Because of
the difficulties involved in preventing this salt from freezing in the steam
generator a low melting point was also a requirement, On this besis a solution
of sodium, lithium, beryllium fluorides (mole percentages of 30, 20 and 50%

respectively) with a melting point of 527°F was selected,
=20=

1,/, Materials

Most fused salts are quite corrosive to the standard structural materials.
However, it has been found that alloys containing large percentages of nickel
offer the good corrosion resistance to the fused fluoride salts, Extensive
testing at ORNL under the ANP Project has shown that Inconel and the nickel-

molybdenum alloys present the best combination of strength and corrosion
resistance, Because the procurement and fabricability of Inconel are better

defined at present it was selected for the basic design although the corrosion
resistance of the nickel-molybdenum alloys is much superior,

Inconel was also selected as the structural material for components in
the steam system within the secondary shield because of its superior resistance
to chloride stress corrosion,

The complexity of mechanical design problems involved in a separate
moderator cooling system made it undesirable and must be weighed against the
high temperature difficulties encountered with fuel cooling. A ceramic
moderator appeared to offer a reasonable compromise from the temperature
standpoint although most did not have adequate nuclear and/or physical pro-
perties to be acceptable, Beryllium oxide has the best overall characteristics
at present as its fabrication and physical properties are reasonably well
known and its satisfactory behavior under nuclear radiation had been demonstrated

experimentally,

1.5 Exchangers snd Steam

 

The primary heat exchanger is a once-through counter-flow type with
the secondary salt on the tube side, There are 12 heat exchanger tube

. bundles with each tube bundle made up of 6 subassemblies for ease of fabrication
=21-

and inspection,

The steam generator and superheater are of conventional design utilizing
U-tubes to reduce the thermal stress problem. The high pressure water and
steam are located on the tube side to minimize the component weight, Several
other designs that offered potential weight decreases were considered but
were not incorporated because the design was not as well proven,

A blender was placed in the secondary fluid upstream of the steam
generator, This provides a means of maintaining the salt in the boiler at
a lower temperature than that in the superheater by mixing a relatively low
temperature salt for the exit of the steam generator with the high temperature
superheater salt, This considerably reduced the thermal stress at this

point and offered a weight saving over the use of a salt-to-salt regenerator,

1,6 Potential

The major objective of the study covered by this report was to design
a power plant incorporating ideas and components that could be substantiated
by reference to a reasonable amount of experimental development work and test
programs. However, there exist mary new facets of fused salt technology
that appear to offer large potential but at present are little more than
qualified opinions plus a small amount of experimental verification, Because
it was felt that this potential was significantly greater than that existing
with other type of reactor systems, the study was extended to incorporate
the most promising of these developments,

Through the use of a new fuel that offers more self moderation, moderator
materials that allow the core to operate at a higher power densities, and

structural materials that offer improved corrosion resistance, the basic size
«22

of the reactor itself decreased from 6.7 ft diameter by 6.7 £4 high to
approximately 5 ft diameter by 5.4 ft. high, To further decrease the size
of the heat exchangers and steam generating equipment, sodium was used in
the intermediate loops.

This study indicated that it would be reasonable to expect that a specific
welght reduction on the order of at least & 1bs/SHP could be achieved in

the future with fused salt reactor systems.

1.7 Conclusions

This design study of a circulating fuel, fused salt reactor for a
marine power plant has shown that such a system is technically feasible at
present, Reactor systems of this type not only allow overall performance

improvements over current systems, but allow reactor installations to be
considered for a lighter class ship. In addition, with the developmental

and experimental work accomplished in this field at ORNL, the construction

of this plant could proceed with a minimm of additional development work,
Also considering the potential of this system with developments that are

now in sight, it appears that congiderable performence and weight improvements
could be expected,

The difficulties involved in handling the fluoride fuel and maintaining
it above its melting point have been satisfactorily overcome and proven out
in test loops and a reactor experiment, Also, materials that will give
adequate resistance to the ‘high temperature corrosiveness of the salts have
been found; although increased corrosion resistance would be desirable.
Although the fuel inventory required is considerably higher than for other

systems, this is partially offset by the elimination of the need for replacement
«23

cores and holdup for chemical reprocessing, When the many important advantages
of this type of system are considered, they appear to more than offset the
above, These include: higher temperature and overall thermal efficiency,
low weight and volume requirements, low pressure system; proven stability
allowing the elimination of numerous integral control rods, continuous poison
gas removal; fuel makeup as needed, etc.

In the judgement of the authors the circulating fuel-fused salt reactor
not only shows considerable performance potential over present and proposed
marine installations but it offers the most promising system applicable to

a small ship installation,

2.0 INTRODUCTION

2,1 Use for HPMR

Atomic weapons were not only the forefather of atomic power reactors,
but also the forerummer of a completely new concept of naval warfare, A
small ship utilizing missiles with atomic warheads could have the destructive
effectiveness of the largest warship of the preatomic era, If one could take
such a small ship and build it in large numbers, give it a high speed along
with an effectively infinite range, it clearly would present quite a formidable
weapon. A small ship with no refueling problems would also have many other
potential uses such as convoy and patrol duties in isolated areas. The
purpose of this report is to determine the feasibility of a reactor system
capable of being installed aboard a small ship to give it the effective
infinite range mentioned above. Also once the feasibility of an improved
high performance (lightweight) marine reactor is established for a small ship,
it likewise holds promise for considerable weight savings on larger vessels
and volume savings on submarines,

For the purpose of this report a 931 class destroyer of 3500-4000 tons
displacement was selected for investigation, This ship is roughly half the
displacement of the smallest current proposed reactor installation (Sec. Roly
and Ref, 8), but considerably over the minimum size felt necessary to contain
a crev for long durations. This ship contains two separate boiler and
machinery rooms utilizing steam at 950°F and 1200 psig to produce a total of
70,000 SHP, These steam conditions fortunately fell into the range’ considered
desirable for reactor installations of this type. With the machinery room

fixed, the boilers could be simply replaced by a nuclear system without com-
25a

promising the basic reactor design. This would considerably ease the redesign
of a conventional 931 class destroyer to muclear power as well as offer the
shipboard advantage of the crew being thoroughly familiar with the steam
plant, In addition, the logistic and shore maintenance problems would be

reduced because of the mumber of identical steam plants in service,

2,2 Ship Installation

For the purpose of this study it was felt most feasible to replace only
one of the boiler rooms with a reactor system, This not only gives the
advantage of having the proven reliability of a completely conventional system
aboard ship, but would considerably reduce the total cost of the complete
installation, Algo the performance penalty paid for utilizing both the reactor
ard boiler systems would be very small if not negligible,

The difference in speed of this class ship between operating on the
reactor system along (35,000 SHP) and maximum power (70,000 SHP) is approximately
4 knots, Obviously, this inefficient utilization of power is not warranted
except under emergency conditions, In addition, structural design problems
associated with vibration and noise along with their related detrimental
effects on submarine and aircraft detection equipment does not make extended
maximum speed operation appear feasible, As an additional point it should be
noted that if an average fleet speed of as high as 20 knots is assumed, this
ship would be developing less than 1/3 of its potential reactor power and
zero conventional. Therefore the conventional steam boiler system can be used
to augment the reactor when emergency conditions exist apparently without
penalizing the overall ship operation and offer large savings from both the

cost and reliability standpoint,

 
«26

The total amount of fuel oil carried aboard is approximately 54% of its
original value, Since this is to be used only under special conditions and
not for crusing it is considered adequate. A typical combat problem was
not available for analysis, but it is felt that the endurance of the nuclear-
oil fired ship combination at maximum power would be substantially increased

over the conventional ship,

2.3 Design Philosophy
Because of both the relatively short time available for this study and

the limited experience in certain aspects of the field it should be realized
that a thorough investigation of all phases was not possible, In instances
where there appeared several feasible approaches, but with each requiring a
considerable design effort to evaluate, a somewhat arbitrary choice utilizing
engineering judgement had to be made, These selections and the alternate
possible choices gre discussed throughout the report. The primary objective
was to establish design feasibility for the small ship application,
Accomplishment of this with the selected design, indicates that with additional
study the possible alternates herein bypassed could either be incorporated
with a subsequent design improvement or simply rejected,

Many detailed problems concerning the steam system were not thoroughly
investigated as it was felt that solutions to these were well established,
Major emphasis was placed on the really unusual problems concerning the reactor
and intermediated salt systems to obtain plausible solutions,

The basic design philosophy was to use materials, designs, and techniques
that have been established as feasible and backed up as much as possible by

experimental verification. In cases where the restriction to present day

 
 

27a

technology eliminated alternate approaches, they were briefly mentioned for
possible future consideration, Attempts were made to fully utilize the
experience, knowledge, and background of the persommel at the Oak Ridge
National Laboratory and other industries.
Several basic ground rules were established early in the design study,
The first was that within the limits of the previous paragraph, the design
optimization would be on the basis of obtaining the lightest weight on a
1b per shaft horsepower basis, Another was to prohibit the use of a fuel
or intermediate fluids that were not compatible with each other as well as
steam plant and sea water. This ground rule was believed to be basically
desirable from the battle damage standpoint because of the severe punishment
that ships of this type can receive and still be operable, Also this com-
patibility offers obvious safety advantages in the steam generator design,
Advantage was taken of the conventional plant fuel oil left on board
by using it for shielding purposes. If a completely nuclear destroyer design
is required; it appears that the weight advantage may not be as acceptable
as for the combined conventional and nuclear powered ship. However, because
of the narrow beam of this class ship, the reactor compartment can be rearranged
to utilize the salt and sea water at the sides to reduce the shielding
requirements, Because of the decreased volume and especially the height of
the fused salt system it is possible to install the top shield deck of the
reactor compartment at the water line, Advantage could also be taken of putting
the reactor compartments back-to-back to reduce the required shielding,
Unfortunately limited time prohibited detailed consideration of these arrange-
ments from being made for a completely miclear ship ‘although an estimate was

made on the added shielding weight required for the proposed installation.

2+4 Reactor Comparisons and Selection

In the process of investigating potential small ship applications and
selecting a 931 class destroyer for this study, it became obvious that ga
nuclear power plant specific weight on the order of 60 1bs/SHP had to be
realized, A brief review of current and proposed nuclear ship installations
vas made and these all fell considerably short of meeting this requirement,
These values, summarized on Figure 2-1, are to be considered only approximate
and neither the latest or the best values, The lightest values found were
105 for the FIW and 90 lbs SHP for DIG, The FIW ig q Joint WAPD-Bethlehen
Steel effort in which a large portion of the detail design has heen firmed
up. This design produces approximately 80,000 SHP and is installed on a
14,000 ton ship which would normally be considered in the light to medium

crugier class, The D1G program is a KAPL-Bethlehem Steel venture that ig

 

still in the early preliminary design stage with the specific weight given
being only a design objective and not a design-substantiated value, The
design power is to be 60 5000 SHP with a total ship weight of roughly 7500 tons.
This size is in between what had been considered the destroyer clags (2,5 =
4000 tons) and a cruiger class (12 - 18,000 tons), It is apparent that thege
installations do not offer much promise of a weight reduction to 60 Ibs/SHP
for a 931 class installation,
In investigating the field in general for a lightweight reactor system,

the Aircraft Nuclear Propulsion (ANP) Projects appear to hold similar require-

ments for low propulsion system specific weight, In addition, it seems

 

substantially mproved at a small enough increase in overall weight to make a

ship application most feasible.

Two types of reactor systems were considered (1) the heterogeneous
gas cycle using high temperature ceramic fuel elements under development
by General Electric at Evendale and (2) the circulating fuel, fused salt
system being developed at ORNL.

A gas cycle did not appear to be readily applicable at present for a
ship installation because gas turbines of the size required had not been
developed, Aldo, éven though high gas temperatures and correspondingly
high turbine efficiencies could be achieved, material Limitations could
prohibitly limit the extended life required for a ship application,

The fused salt reactor concept appeared to readily adapt itself to
a steam generation application, The nominal reactor temperature could be
decreased geveral hundred degrees (°F) from the ANP design values for an
improvement of the corrosion problem, This still would result in an ample
temperature margin to provide steam with 3-400°F of superheat at desired
pressures,

These factors coupled with .the Yat hand" availability of fused salt

technology made this type of reactor appear to be most feasible at present,

2.5 Advantages and Disadvantages of Fused Salt Reactorg

Like any complex system, a fused salt reactor installation exhibits
both strong and weak points. In any reactor comparison; a relative weighing
of these must be made along with the determination that 10 unsolvable weak
points exist. However; in considering a 931 class ship installation such a
comparison cannot eagily be made because no othdr reactor configurations exist
that can satisfy the strict weight requirements. Therefore if a need for a

nuclear ship of this si xists, the fact that no unsolvable problems apparently

  

 
«31

exists in above sufficient reason to proceed with a detailed study, Fortunately,
a fused salt system offers many advantages over conventional reactor systems
that could make it highly competitive even for large ship applications, There-
fore the advantages as well as the problems of fused salt reactor systems are
discussed to establish its potential over other reactor types for future
comparisons,
2.5.1 Advantages

1. High temperatures are obtainable which give rise to high
overall plant thermal efficiencies,

2, Low pressure reactor system, Pressure required (< 100 psi)
only to provide pressure differential for fluid flow and to prevent pump
cavitation,

3. Inherent stability of this class reactors has been demonstrated,
Multiple control rods and control drive mechanisms are not required at a cone
siderable saving to cost, reliability and maintenance problems. A single
control rod which may be required to compensate for fuel burn-up or to provide
for desired temperature changes may be located outside of the reactor vessel
and subject to relatively easy maintenance.

4. With this type of reactor design it would be possible to
overtemperature the reactor to obtain large increased in power output for
emergency conditions, Undoubtedly this would be at a sacrifice in overall
life of the system but extreme conditions could warrant this use,

5. The fission product gages may be continuously removeds thereby
eliminating the Xenon override problem and the excess reactivity requirements.

6, The basic reactor is generally much more symmetrical and

smaller than other systems, thereby reducing the shielding problems as well as

 
=32w

the overall size and weight,

7. Inexpensive fuel preparation, The reactor core is of simple
design and there is no fuel element fabrication and burnable poison costs.
The handling of U-235 is simplified as Uapiking" of the salt fuel carrier
is required only after the reactor has been filled,

8. Reloading or refueling would generally not be required
during the life of the reactor, Fuel additions may be made during reactor
operation to compensate for fuel burn-up and to override soluble fission
product buildup. Because of this and (5) the excess reactivity requirements
are considerably reduced and can lead to a reactor that is inherently safe
from power excursions.

9. Chemical stability - No radiation ‘damage or fuel decomposition
problems. Explosive radiolytic gases are not formed, thereby eliminating
problems such as the recombination of Hy and 0, in water reactor systems.

10. The combination of (7) and (9) make it possible to utilize
high core power densities with the subsequent reduction in reactor size,

11, Chemical reprocessing is greatly simplified with a homogeneous
system giving a corresponding cost decrease,

12, Although not directly applicable to a marine installation,
it should be noted that for breeding purposes both thorium and uranium are
soluble over a large range of concentrations, This is not true for either an
aqueous homogeneous or a liquid metal system.

2.5.2 Disadvantages

1, Corrosion problems are more aiffioult than for an aqueous or

sodium system but probably better than a homogeneous liquid metal reactor,

2, High melting point requires that careful attention be paid
=33-

to loading and operational techniques. A molten state is required at all
timesgs however the successful operation of a reactor experiment (Ref, 6)
indicates that these problems may be solved,

3. A high degree of leak tightness and reliability 1s required
for the core vessel and primary heat exchangers, Careful and tight quality
control and material inspection is required,

ho A high fuel investment in the reactor is required, However,
considering the elimination of replacement cores and the cooling period
before chemical reprocessing the total investment may be comparable to
heterogeneous, solid fueled systems,

5. Poorer neutron economy is obtained than with aqueous

homogeneous systems although newer types of fused salts offer improvements,

2.6 Additional Applications

Once the design feasibility of a fused salt reactor system is proven
it offers considerable potential for both larger and smaller vessels, If
specific weights on the order of 60 lbs/SHP can be maintained for smaller
power sizes many new opportunities are available for an even smaller ship
application. In going to a larger size ship an overall specific weight of
60 should be more easily attained, This would offer either a weight reduction
or an increase in storgge capacity of approximately 1600 tons for a ship the
size of FIW or 1000 tons for DIG,

A fused salt reactor also offers a considerable reduction in the size
of an installation, While important for any ship, this is even more important
for a submarine application, A preliminary comparison made by KAPL in 1953

(Ref. 7) indicated the design advantage of this type of system for a submarine

 
=3/

application, A current design would tend to give an even bigger advantage.
Incidentally, a potential non-marine application not pertinent to this
study but of general interest involves the use of stationary fused salt

reactor plants for breeding and electric power production (Ref, 5).

3.0 OVERALL POWER PLANT DESCRIPTION

3.1 Introduction

  

The utilization of only a single reactor system aboard a 931 class
destroyer offered some desirable flexibility as to the overall ship arrang
ment, However; the numerous basic considerations required to establish 4
the optimum shipboard installations were somewhat, beyond the scope of this
report, With a cursory investigations, it at first seemed to be most
-advantageous to replace the foreward boiler room with the reactor and steam
generator equipment, This had the sizeable advantage of not requiring any
layout considerations or secondary shield penetrations for passage of the
propeller shafts from the other engine room. However, under detail design,
the size of the reactor compartment was reduced below that originally
contemplated and means of circumventing this problem became apparent, The
alt compartment location also offered the advantages of easier accessibility
and a better location of the fuel oil tanks to maintain ship trim,

The basic system upon which the major design effort was placed consisted
of the circulating fuel, fused fluoride salt reactor incorporating an integral
heat exchanger unit to remove heat from the fuel, A secondary fluid, another
fluoride salt, is used to transfer the heat from the primary heat exchangers
within the reactor vessel to the steam generating equipment. The steam is
then supplied to the conventional 931 class destroyer machinery room at a
temperature of 950°F and a pressure of 1200 psig, A simplified schematic of
this system is shown on Figure 3-1, The detailed heat balance is discussed

later in Section 10 and presented in Figure 10-1,

The mean reactor temperature is 1225°F with a power output of 95,9 MW
required to supply 35,000 shaft horsepower to the ship's propellers, The
temperatures across the various equipment as well as the steam and salt flow
rates are given on Figure 3-1, The secondary salt system, which carries the
heat from the reactor to the steam generator, is broken up into two inter-
connected loops. The top loop supplies the superheater with a relatively
hot salt, This is required to reduce the superheater size because of the
low heat transfer coefficients characteristic of the steam side. The bottom
loop maintains the salt at a lower temperaturs to reduce the thermal stress
problems in the steam generator, This is desired here because the relatively
high heat transfer coefficients on both the water and salt side would give
a large temperature drop across both the tube and header walls and hence
a high thermal stress, Blenders are used to interconnect the two loops as
indicated thereby allowing cold salt from the exit of the steam generator
to be recirculated to reduce the reactor inlet temperature to the desired
value,

It should be noted that the reactor and steam generators were basically
designed to produce 125 MW, This over-design of approximately 30% was brought
about by the time lag involved between when the basic reactor had to be
selected and when the detailed steam conditions for the desired size ship could
be obtained, A 10% over-design safety factor (used for other marine reactor
applications) would be desirable but time did not permit a reiteration of the
work to this size. An approximation was made to allow for this over-design
(Sec, 12) to indicate the overly large weight penalty incurred. In replacing
the boiler equipment with this reactor system, it appears (Section 11.2) that

a substantial volume saving is also realized, While important for any small

 
ship, it should further emphasize that in this application the volume is
saved over the height of the boiler room (approximately 30 ft) making it also

available for missile storage,

3.2 Alternate Approach

The sodium component in the secondary fluid becomes highly activated as
it passes through the primary heat exchanger due to both delayed neutrons
from fuel in the exchanger and fast neutrons from the core, Because of the
large amount of this secondary salt outside of the primary shield, it is
necessary to incorporate a relatively thick secondary shield about all of
the steam generating equipment, A more detailed design should consider the
possibility of reducing this activation somewhat through the use of poison
bearing materials, i.e., boron, in the heat exchanger region, However, this
does not appsar to offer a large reduction in the secondary salt activation
because only approximately 10 = 15% of the activation results from thermal
neutrons, the remainder occurring because of the high intermediate energy
flux and sodium resonance peeks.

An alternate approach that was briefly studied used two intermediate
fluids (both salt) in order to provide a non-radioactive salt in the steam
equipment. Although a penalty was paid due to increased pumping power require-
ments and superheater size, this was more than compensated for by a shield
welght decrease due to a smaller enclosed volume, Direct access was also
given to the steam generators and superheaters for maintenance, In addition,
it now appeared feasible to keep the secondary shield small enough to allow
an aft boiler room installation, if desired, without the complication previously

mentioned,

3,3 Reactor

The overall shape of the basic reactor 1s a cylinder approximately 80
inches high by 80 inches in diameter. Fuel is circulated up through a central
critical region equivalent to a cylinder 75 em diameter by 80 cm high and then
down through an annular downcomer around the periphery. (See Figure 3-2)

This outer region contains the primary heat exchangers for transferring the
heat from the fuel to the secondary salt.

Cylindrical rods of beryllium oxide suitably clad with Inconel are
equispaced throughout the core to provide for moderation, The ends of these
rods are loaded with a poisoned material to reduce end leakage and fissioning
in the entrance and exit plena, A single control rod channel, approximately
4 Inches in diameter, extends through the center of the core region,

The sides of the core are enclosed by a nickel reflector blanket 6 inches
thick. This inelastically scatters some high energy leakage neutrons back
into the core to improve the criticality as well as to offer both compact
neutron and gamma shielding. To further reduce the neutron flux in the heat
exchanger region the reflector is in turn surrounded by a 5-1/2 inch thick
region of cylindrical rods containing a mixture of beryllium oxide plus
boron-1l0, Boron bearing Inconel rods are placed in the interstices of these
cylinders for shielding purposes and to reduce the fuel located in this region,
A thin slab of material essentially black to thermal neutrons, boron carbide
in a copper matrix, then surrounds this region to completely absorb any neutrons
that are thermalized in its outer periphery.

Small passages are provided through the nickel reflector and the
cylindrical Be0-B0 rods to circulate fuel for cooling purposes. An 1/8 inch

annular gap is also located between the thermal shield and the reactor pressure
lm

vesgel wall for cooling purposes. The lower temperature fuel from the heat
exchanger exit circulates through here and then to the expansion chamber in
the reactor head, This minimizes both the head temperatures brought about
by decay heating and "snow" formation from the fuel (Ref. Sec. 4.1.2),

Three removable centrifugal pumps which are located in the reactor head
provide for fuel flow and pressurization of the system, These pumps are also
designed to facilitate removal of the gaseous fission products.

Additional details of the reactor design are incorporated into

Sections 6, 8, and 11.

3.4 General

A major disadvantage of a reactor of this type is that provisions must
be made to ensure that temperatures are maintained above the fuel melting
point at all times, Although accomplishment of this has been proven feasible
by both many loop tests and a reactor experiment, (Ref. 6), careful attention
to operational procedures are required, Although a complete freeze up is
not catastrophic from a muclear sense, experience has shown that severe pro-
blems exist from a stress standpoint upon remelting. Because of this, dump
tanks are included between the double hull under the secondary shield com-
partment for emergency use.

The reactor and secondary salt pumps may all be replaced through the
secondary shield, Sufficient room also exists above the secondary shield so
that the pump drive and control drive mechanism motors may be accessibly located,
The lightest and most flexible system for pump drives appeared to be the steam
turbine, This offered the advantage of having variable speed characteristics

and also did not require the addition of generator sets to the system, It
was planned to back up each of these drives with a’ small A.C, motor, Those
would provide suitable circulation under zero power standby conditions as
well as offering the safety advantage of having two independent systems
under emergency conditions.

Control of the reactor system could be accomplished by varying the
secondary salt flow rate as demanded by the steam plant. This, as well as
an alternate approach of by-passing secondary salt around the reactor,
is discussed in Section 11.3.

The reactor as illustrated on Figure 3-2 indicates a possible method
of unelamping the head to allow replacement of heat exchangers and other
internal components. Two different methods of connecting the heat exchangers
to the reactor vessel for disassembly purposes are shown, Although shown
to be feasible on this drawing, it is very questionable as to whether or not
the cost for this eage of disassembly is warranted from the overall maintenance
standpoint, Additional discussion on two different concepts of maintenance

is presented in Section 11,5.

3.5 BShieldin
The basic shield is designed to limit the maximum allowable dose to

15 mr/hr on the outside of the secondary shield. This would allow access
to the auxiliary engine room for 20 hours per week for maintenance on pump
drives, deaerators, feed and boiler recirculating pumps, etc, At an average
distance of 10 feet from the secondary shield, the limited access would be
increased to approximately 30 hours per week, Unlimited access would be
allowed in the main engine room,

The primary shield is of laminated structure containing the equivalent
of 5 inches lead, 39 inches of water, and 1-1/2 inches of structural steel.
The secondary shield is designed to attemuate the decay gammas from the
activated sodium component of the secondary salt and gamma leakage from

the primary shield tank, This shield makes use of the fuel oil required

on board for the conventional system for shielding the forward; port and
starboard sides and approximately 4 - 6-1/2 inches of lead for the top and
aft sections, An additional 1-1/2 inches of lead is located over the reactor
fuel pumps to eliminate streaming through the crevices required to drive

and replace these pumps.

3.6 Weight Comparison of Nuclear and Conventional System

A weight breakdown for a 931 class destroyer with a conventional and
a nuclear installation is given in Figure 3,3, To simplify the comparison,
specific weight rather than the actual weight of the components is presented,
The actual shipboard weight (lbs) for the conventional system may be obtained
by multiplying through by 70,000 SHP for the total weight or 35,000 SHP for
the weight per engine room, This will also hold true for the fuel-oil weights
listed.

Using this information, it can be calculated that the conventional
total ship power plant weight is 1123 tons (long) wet, with 728.5 tons of
fuel oil,

System No, 1 is considered to be the basic design upon which most of the
design effort was spent, It contains information a reactor and steam generating
system over-designs of approximately 10% and 30%. System No, 2 used the
alternate approach consisting of two intermediate fluids to allow placement

of the steam generators, etc, outside of the secondary shield, and a similar

approximation of both a 10% and a 30% overdesign safety factor. These
designs utilized a portion of the fuel oil required for the conventional
steam system, The 1,7 lbs/SHP for fuel oil as listed; is the fuel oil above
50% of the completely non-nuclear destroyer capacity that is required to
maintain ship balance, A third design utilizing advanced material and
reactor technology and eliminating the ground rule of required fluid
compatability with water, achieved a further reduction in specific weight
to 56,7 1bs/SHP without any fuelsoil required for shielding, A comparable
value with the above utilizing fuel-oil would be 46.7 lbs/SHP.

It is realized that in many cases the weight of a reactor system goes
up in proportion to the amount of design detail accomplished, However, this
general tendency would be reduced in this study because the entire steam and
electric plant, which accounts for approximately 1/3 of the total weight, has
been actually detailed and constructed, In addition, an attempt was made to
apply conservative estimates to the various components to account for unknown
growth factors, A detailed weight breakdown, including the estimates made,

is presented in Section 12,

3.7 Hazard Evaluation
A hazard study for marine application of this type of reactor was

carried out by a pair of ORSORT students (Ref. 64). This evaluation indicated
that basing the major destruction of both the ship and reactor vessel, this
system was inherently as safe as any nuclear system, With a major catastrophe,

however, a more widespread release of fission products would result,

4,0 FUEL AND SECONDARY FLUID

L.1 Fuel

 

4.1.1 Introduction

The chief advantage of using a fused salt fuel is that high
temperatures may be obtained at low pressures. Such a system is also
capable of high power density with accompanying small reactor size, and
low shield weight. Also, gaseous fission products may be removed. No
fuel element fabrication results in long life for core, and high fuel
burnup. Fuel may be continuously or periodically added as it is burned,
In addition, and by no means of least importance, fused salts do not react
violently with water.

For such a system, the fused salt fuel and diluent must have a
reasonably low melting point, low neutron capture cross section, stability
at high temperatures and in extended high neutron, beta and gamma fluxes.
In addition, it is essential that the fuel system be sufficiently non-
corrosive to the container material that an acceptably long life and freedom
from maintenance may be realized.

The fused salt way or may not function as a moderator. In the reactor
herein described, moderation of fast neutrons is accomplished largely by
means of moderator rods dispersed throughout the core. The design chosen
and fuel selected results in an epithermal or intermediate reactor, rather
than a therwal reactor.

A large amount of fundamental as well as engineering research has been
performed at ORNL toward development of fuels, and the selection of the fuel

known hereinafter as Fuel 30 was based on the results of several years of
47.

phase dlagram research, dynamic and static corrosion testing, and in-pile
loop tests. The cholce of this fuel permits the use of technology already
at hand, and does not require additional extensive fundamental research.
In addition, critical experiment data and actual reactor operational data
are available, where similar fuels were used or simulated.

While it appears desirable for moderating efficiency that a fuel be
used which contains LiF and Ber, the present technology of containing such
fuels is not considered adequate. However, it is expected that future
designs for fused salt reactors will be possible as soon as research
currently in progress has been completed. Such research is now leading
toward development of very corrosion resistant nickel molybdenum alloys,
which show extremely good prospects for future use in fused salt reactors,

k.1.2 Composition

The approximate composition of Fuel 30, as modified by the
criticality requirements of the particular configuration of the reactor,
is (expressed in mol percent) 49% NaF, Us5% ZrF,, 6 UF. Zirconium fluoride

It will be seen from Figure 4-1 that the composition selected is in the
vicinity of the triple eutectic low melting composition, Also, if solid
fuel concentrate is added in the form of NaoUFg, only compositions having
lover melting points than the concentrate are formed as dissolution progresses.
Figure 4-2 shows ZxF), vapor pressure for various mol percentages of
ZrF), as a function of temperature. It is apparent that this vapor pressure
is dependent on both ZrF), concentration and on temperature. The formation
of ZrF) acicular crystals ("snow") has resulted from high temperature treat-
ments of ZrF) bearing salt mixes. This segregation can become a problem if
conditions are favorable for snow formation, According to our best information
(Ref, 49) snow formation should not ve a problem if the maximum fuel tem
perature is kept below 1350°F in the expansion chamber. The accumulation
of snow-like ZrF) crystals is most undesirable and may lead to the plugging
of passages or fouling of the expansion chamber. To further avoid this
cold surfaces in the expansion chamber should be eliminated, It is clear
thatthe use of a fuel devoid of ZrF), is desirable, However, corrosion

considerations dictate the selection of Fuel 30 at the present time,

4.1.3 Corrosion
4.1.3.1 Introduction
As a design criterion, it was hypothesized that all
design work should be predicated on the basis that ‘the core vessel and all
other parts of the system, which were subject to activation or to radicactive
contamination, would be specified of such materials and thicknesses as to
be able to withstand full power operation (125 MW), for a period of at least
10,000 hours without failure from corrosion by the fuel selected. Insofar
as it is possible to predict, from dynamic and static corrosion research
at ORNL, this standard has been adhered to for the Fuel 30-Inconel-Secondary
Fused Salt System described. Final metal thicknesses were selected on the
bagls of experimental results and personal experience (Refs. 39, 42, 4k, Ls).
Fuel 30 and the secondary NaF-LiF-BeF, fused salt mix were selected because
research and informed opinion showed that Inconel is a satisfactory container
for them at the temperatures of operation anticipated.
4.1.3.2 Corrosion Mechanism

The most critical location, as far as corrosion is con-
cerned, in this reactor is estimated to be the moderator cladding, The type
of corrosion to be expected is chromium depletion, by diffusion and dissolution,
with hot leg-cold leg cycle accelerating mass transfer by solubility gradient.
The chemical reaction is UF) + Cr% => CrFp +2 UF3.

Another possible source of trouble due to corrosion in fused salt Inconel
systems is a mass transfer buildup, or deposition of chromium in the cold leg
at a greater rate than inward diffusion can dispose of it. If such deposition
were localized, clogging of small passages might result. This type of buildup

was predicted for nearly all fuels tested, However, Fuel 30 was free from such

 
52.

buildup after 1500 hours at 1500°F hot leg temperature in a thermal con-
vection Loop. (Ref. 58)

Dynamic hot leg-cold leg tests have shown that waximum initial attack is
about 5 mils in first thousand hours operation, and will average 2 - 3 mils
per thousand hours operation at 1500°F, On this basis, %0 mils of Inconel
moderator cladding is expected to be sufficient for 10,000 hours full power
operation. It is to be noted that the reaction which may be expected to
proceed if BeO moderator directly contacts fuel is

UFy + 2 BeOg=>2 BeF, + U0,

2
This reaction would gradually concentrate the fuel on the surface of the
moderator rods, With unclad BeO, this deposition of uo, on its surface
would greatly retard the reaction.

The nature of the Inconel corrosion is such that the corroded layer is
chromium poor, and characterized by unicellular voids. However, tests have
shown that even helium cannot penetrate the corroded layer. The strength
is greatly lowered, but, barring fracture and peeling of cladding, the UF), ~
BeO reaction rate, even when entire thickness of cladding is chromium depleted,
is controlled by rate of solid state ‘diffusion of Be through the cladding.
No great aifficulty is expected on this point,

The corrosion rate in the heat exchanger tubes, based on extrapolation
of 1500°F dynamic corrosion data with a 3000F hot-cold difference (Refs. 36
and 42) to 1200°F and 1000F differences is estimated as 10-12 mils maximum
“per 10,000 hours operation, on fuel side of tubes. Another favorable factor
is that the fuel is already chromium rich (from contact with hot moderator
cladding) when it enters heat exchanger. This would tend to reduce the corrosion

to an even lower rate.

%,1.5 Nuclear Properties
The: use of Fuel 30 and Inconel cladding on beryllium oxide moderator

rods results in a rather large fuel concentration. Absorption cross sections
of the sodium atom is higher than is desirable and very little moderation
is accomplished in the fuel. When testing and development work on nickel
molybdenum alloys and fuels containing lithium and beryllium has been completed,
it is expected that critical mass and fuel concentration may be materially -
reduced. For example, where use of Fuel 30 dictates that 40 mils thickness
of Inconel cladding be used around moderator rods, use of nickel molybdenum
might permit a cladding thickness of perhaps 15 mils, with accompanying
neutron economy and reduced fuel concentration. Incorporation of Li and Be
fluorides in the fuel would give shorter slowing down length and a smaller
size for the core, However, Fuel 30 and Inconel is the only system whose
technology is thoroughly tested and found satisfactory at this time.

4,1.6 Availability and Cost

Reactor grade NaF is commercially available at $0.20 per pound

and hafnium free ZrF) can be obtained at a cost of $3.50 per pound. To
prepare fuel mix for the reactor, powdered salts are mixed and then treated
with hydrogen and hydrogen fluoride at 1500°F. This reduces the corrosiveness
by removing traces of sulfur, iron, nickel, water, chlorides and other
impurities, Mixed, treated, fused 52% NaF - 48% ZrF), can be produced at

ORNL (Ref. 57) for a cost of $7.50 per pound in thousand pound quantities,

a NL
=55=

~ It was estimated that 20,000 - 30,000 pound quantities might be available
for $6.00 per pound,

4,1,7 Fuel Addition

The uranium burnup ls compensated by periodic additions of

(NaF), UF). From the phase diagram, Figure 4-1, it is noted that dissolution
of this makeup salt in Fuel 30 proceeds so that only constituents of
consistently lower melting points result. (NaF) UF, may be added as pellets
or powder directly to the reactor, It may be melted and injected directly,
or it may be dissolved in a small quantity of fused salt solvent and injected
as. needed.

The fuel concentration is dictated by the operational temperature and
amount of poisoning material in the reactor. As concentration falls or as
poisons build up, the reactor critical temperature decreases. Fuel must
be added when adjustment of the control rod can no longer maintain the desired
operating core temperature.

4.1,8 Fuel Reprocessing (Ref. 5)

%e135 4111 ve continuously removed from the reactor, along with
a part of the 13 precursor, and all stable xenon and krypton isotopes.

It is expected that rare earth fission products will accumulate in the
salt mix; their solubility limits the problem to one of neutron poisoning.

Ruthenium, rhodium, and palladium plate out on metal surfaces.

Reprocessing of the fuel after several years operation will be required
to recover P35 from the spent, poisoned fuel before discarding radicactive
waste, The fluoride volatility process, which depends on the high vapor pressure
of UFg, is expected to allow uranium recovery with a winimum of effort. This

process is currently being perfected at ORNL, Figure 4.3 is a flow sheet for

4.2 Secondary Fluid Heat Exchange Medium

k.2,1 Introduction

On the basis of the following reasons, it was decided to

select a fused salt having the eutectic cowposition 50% BeF,, 30% NaF,
20% LiF, expressed in mol fraction percent, as the secondary fluid.

(1) The salt is non-reactive chemically with the fuel and with water.

(2) Leakage of the salt into the fuel would give a loss in reactivity
(due to 1.16 absorption cross section) rather than an increase.

(3) Rather low conductivity and somewhat high viscosity tends to reduce
thermal stresses in steam generator and superheater tubes.

(4) Melting point must be reasonably below the critical temperature
of water, 705°F, in order to make steam generation feasible without an
additional transfer loop, The above ternary eutectic composition was
selected from three compositions recommended by Ref. 56 because it possessed
the lowest melting point, 527 F.

(5) Intermediate loop prevents neutron activation of the steam and
consequent shielding of steam system components.

(6) Corrosiveness of this fluid toward Inconel is estimated to be less
then that of Fuel 30 under identical conditions because (a) no uranium is
present to catalyze the corrosion reaction and (b) lower maximum temperature,

i.e., 1150°F vs 1275°F (Ref. 42 and 45).

Viscosity, density and conductivity are given as predicted by responsible

needed was not available in time to permit determination before publication
of this report.

Basis of deductions is the three component BeF -NaF-LiF phase diagram,

Figure 4-4. On this diagram, composition selected is noted by T275; that
is, ternary eutectic melting at 275%.

4,2,3 Disadvantages of Fluid

(1) A comparison of the heat exchanger volume needed to transfer

125 MW using this salt and using sodium has been made. It was found that
the reactor pressure vessel size could be reduced considerably by using sodium,
with a consequent shield weight reduction.

(2) Melting point of the fluid, 527°F is so high that a shutdown of
the secondary system pumps would require that system be drained to prevent
freeze up of salt. Considerable care must be exercised to assure that
boiler feed water is preheated before introduction into boiler, or freeze
up way result.

(3) Puuping power is considerably greater with fused salt fluid than

with sodium, because of greater viscosity.

5.0 MATERIALS SELECTION

5.1 Structural Material

Once Fuel 30 had been selected, the results of several years testing
(Ref. 39) the dynamic and static corrosion resistance of structural materials
wade perfunctory the selection of Inconel as the primary structural material.
This included its use for pressure vessel, moderator cladding, primary
heat exchanger structural material, pumps, and all other surfaces in direct
contact with the fuel except the nickel reflectors, As indicated in our
discussion of the fuel, Sec. 4.1, developments in nickel molybdenum alloys
now underway are expected to change the fuel and container materials picture
in the foreseeable future. Nevertheless, this design study 1s based on
present technology and already proven systems. (See Sec. 4.1,3 Corrosion)
Some of the results of corrosion research is presented as Justification for
metal thicknesses and materials chosen, Figure 5-1 shows stress elongation
and rupture curve for Inconel tested in Fuel 30 at 1300°F. Figure 5-2
shows temperature dependence of stress rupture properties of Inconel in
Fuel 30. Figure 5-3 shows effect of section thickness on creep-rupture
properties of Inconel tested in Fuel 30 at 1500°F at 3500 psi stress, Figures
5-1, 5-2, and 5-3 support ‘choice of Inconel with Fuel 30, and thickness of
tubing and cladding specified, Our specification of 40 mils wall thickness
of primary heat exchanger tubes is based on research leading to Figure 5-3
and advice by informed ORNL personnel (Ref. L2). Figure 5-3 indicates that
creep resistance of Inconel immersed in Fuel 30 at elevated temperatures

shows a remarkable improvement when section thickness reaches 40 mils.

Insofar as it is possible to predict from dynamic and static corrosion
data, Inconel thicknesses have been chosen so that, after design lifetime
“has passed, sufficient sound void-free metal remains to provide stress
resistance adequate for the particular use involved.

Inconel has also exhibited superior resistance against chloride stress
corrosion over most conventional materials, Because of the severe problems
that have been attributed to this in the steam generating equipment of both
mobile and stationary plants, it is recommended that it be used for both

the steam and salt side of this equipment.

5.2 Moderator

Since all surfaces in contact with the fuel were of necessity Inconel
(except nickel) it was necessary to choose a moderator of low neutron
absorption which would permit the reactor to go critical with a reasonably
small core volume, Consequently, after investigation (Ref. 43) BeO was
selected as the leading proven moderator which could withstand the temperatures
expected. A cladding of 40 mils was considered necessary, as previously
discussed in Sections 4.1,3 and 5.1. While this thickness of Inconel cladding
does not make for neutron economy, or for low fuel loading, nuclear calculations
indicated that the reactor could be expected to. operate satisfactorily,

One inch diameter test pieces of BeO ceramic were exposed in the MTR
and showed satisfactory thermal stress resistance (Ref, 45, 55), The diameter
of 3/4 inch selected for this application was based on extrapolation of

these results to the higher energy deposition rate expected. See Appendix
6.1.
66

5.3 Reflector

Because of the poor moderating properties of the fuel and the somewhat
high thermal neutron capture cross section of the core, ave to Na and Inconel,
a fast neutron reflector constructed of pure nickel vas chosen, Consequently,
calculations indicate a large percentage of epithermal fissions. The only
fair heat conductance of nickel necessitates the circulation of a small
portion of the fuel through the reflector to equalize temperature and lower
thermal stresses, It is not considered necessary to clad the reflector

for corrosion resistance, which is satisfactory unclad.

5.4 Poisoned Moderator Region

An annular ring of boron bearing, beryllium oxide rods, clad with
Inconel, with interstices filled with boron bearing Inconel rods forms
the neutron shield. Calculations based on an average thermal flux ot 107°
show that helium generation over a period of 10,000 full power hours is
about 01 cmd (STP) of helium per cm3 of BeO, Since BeO way be about 96%
of theoretical density, no significant pressure will be generated,

Between’ the beryllium~boron region and the heat exchanger region an
Inconel clad, copper-B)C cermet layer is interposed as a thermal neutron
absorber, to prevent escape of thermal neutrons to the heat exchangers.
The beryllium-boron region, although heavily poisoned, contains a source
of thermal neutrons due to thermalization of fast neutrons from the core.

Copper-B),C has been satisfactorily fabricated, containing 25 volume
percent of ByC, to a theoretical density of 95%, by cold pressing and hot

rolling (Ref. 36).

6.0 REACTOR AND PRIMARY HEAT EXCHANGER DESIGN

6.1 Introduction
The basic reactor design is conceived as being a pressure tight
cylindrical vessel containing a circulating fluoride fuel. A primary
objective of the design was to minimize its size and weight in order to
reduce its contribution to the overall system specific weight. In addition,
a small reactor design is desirable because of the large effect it may
“have in turn on the. size of both the primary and secondary shield.
The volume of the reactor is basically dependent upon: 1) the
nuclear properties of the fuel as it affects both the critical size and
limiting power densities, and 2) methods which can be devised to remove
the fission heat from the circulating fuel. The establishment of an
-allowable critical size and fuel loading as well as other nuclear con-
siderations are discussed in detail in Section 8.0. The methods of
selection and optimizing a heat exchanger configuration are presented
later in this section, (See 6.3).
Possible alternate solutions or approaches to the various problems
are discussed in the appropriate sections along with the reasons (either
engineering or arbitrary because of time limitations) for the selections

made,

6.2 Reactor
The basic configuration, illustrated by Figure 3-2, is approximately
80 in. in diameter and 80 in, high. Its total net weight is calculated to

be 69,700 lbs (Appendix 13.1). Centrifugal fuel pumps located in the
-69-

reactor head are used to circulate the molten fluoride fuel up through a
central critical reglon, and then through an annular peripheral downcomer
which contains the primary heat exchangers. Heat is removed in this region
and the fuel is again circulated up through the core,

6.2.1 Internal Arrangement

Calculations for the central core region were based on it being
equivalent t0 a cylinder 75 cm in diameter by 80 cm high, This was modified
for design purposes to an octagon shape for a more even moderator rod spacing
and tapered ends to gain extra core volume. An optimum volume fraction
of fuel for the core was found to be 50% (Section 8.0),

Fuel cooled cylindrical beryllium oxide rods, clad with Inconel for
corrosion registance, were used for moderation purposes. These were
equispaced throughout the core on a triangular pitch under the. distance
between centers being defined by the rod size and the desired volume fraction,
Taper fittings were utilized at both ends of these rods to provide for the
proper area and flow distribution, These rods would be held in the bottom
support plate by a bayonnet joint and left free to expand in an axial
direction to eliminate thermal stresses. A hollow ring is attached to each
rod at the end of the upper taper, This will maintain proper rod spacing
and still provide a suitable flow rassage. These rings may be interlocked
to prevent rotation and hence uncoupling of the bottom bayonnet Joint, but
still allow free axial motion,

The effective vertical boundaries of the core region are fixed by poison
material located in the ends of the moderator rods, This poison material,

beryllium oxide plus boron 10, also helps to reduce end leakage as well as

to cut down on fissioning in the entrance and exit plena,

 
~70-

A 10 mil cladding of Inconel is required around the beryllium oxide to
provide proper corrosion resistance for the 10,000 hr design life (Ref.
Section 4,1,3), Since this thickness is fixed and not a function of moderator
rod size, it is of considerable nuclear importance to use fewer large rods
rather than many small rods in order to reduce the total smount of Inconel
poison within the core. However, the wax 1mm size is limited not by the
nuclear aspects such as self shielding of the fuel, but by thermal stresses
due to heat generation within the moderator material,

The feasibility of using beryllium oxide as a moderator material has
been satisfactorily demonstrated under cyclic reactor conditions in the
MIR (Ref. 54 and 55). Using this information, caloulations vere made to
limit the design stresses for the present system to that found to be allowable
in the above tests (Appendix 6.1). This limited the moderator rod size,
without cladding, to approximately 3/k in. for the present. Because no
indications were found in the MIR tests to indicate that higher power
densities could be allowed, this minimum size could possibly be increased
in the future when substantiated by additional test programs. Calculations
of the temperature rise across the boundary ‘layer (50°F) and through the
moderator rod (143°F), also included in Appendix 6.1, indicate that a
maximum centerline moderator temperature of 1L491OF is to be expected. This
is well within the operational limits of this material and approximately
equal to that of the MIR tests.

The moderator elements may be fabricated by Inserting slugs of Bed
3/4 in. in diameter by 2 in. long into Inconel cans of suitable wall thick-
ness. In the MIR tests, improved heat transfer out of the moderator material

was realized by utilizing helium in the small clearance gap required between
-T1-

the slug and cladding. Stress calculations indicate that a shrink fit of
the cladding around the BeO could be used in conjunction with the above to
obtain further improvements.

A nickel blanket, approximately 6 in. thick, is incorporated around
the cylindrical side of the reactor core to offer advantages both as a
reflector and a shield, High energy leakage neutrons are inelastically
reduced to a lower energy level and scattered back into the core to
improve the core criticality and power distribution, Also because of its
close proximity to the core it acts as an effective shield, from a weight
standpoint, for both prompt gammas and neutrons. A detailed stress and
heat generation analysis was not made on the reflector. However, because
the reflector supports no load other than its own weight, it can be allowed
to operate at high temperatures and in the plastic region so that thermal
stresses may be effectively annealed out. Fuel flow channels of approximately
4% by volume should be more than adequate for cooling the reflector.

In order to minimize the activation of the secondary fluid, it is
necessary to reduce the neutron flux in the primary heat exchanger region
as wuch as possible. To help accomplish this; a region containing BeO
to thermalize fast neutrons and boron to capture the thermal neutrons is
included outside of the reflector. This region contains closely packed
3/4 in, cylinders suitably clad with Inconel and is approximately 5-1/2 in.
thick. Small boron bearing Inconel rods are placed in the interstices of
these cylinders for additional shielding and to reduce the fuel and hence
fissioning in this region. Sufficient flow areas will still exist within
the interstices of the large and small rods to provide for cooling.

To assure absorption of neutrons that are thermalized in the outer
~72-

edge of the above region a thin layer of boron carbide in a copper matrix
is then placed around the above region.. The feasibility of using these
materials are discussed in Section 5.h,

A single control rod thimble, approximately 4 in. in diameter, extends
through the length of the .core. A clearance gap of 0,1 in, on the radius
is allowed between the thimble and the control rod to assure free operation.
To facilitate fuel cooling of the poison rod this gap would be filled with
either a salt or a liquid metal. A small reservoir could be included in
the reactor head in order to keep the thimble full as the control rod is
withdrawn. For the purpose of the control rod worth evaluation (Section
8.2.3) 1% wag assumed that this gap was filled with sodium. Because of
the small quantity involved it was felt that this would not be a serious
hazard.

A low point drain hole is located at the bottom centerline of the
reactor vessel to provide a place for both filling and locating an
emergency dump or blowout valve. This is incorporated into the bottom
lateral support of the control rod thimble.

A thermal shield is located Just outside of the heat exchangers to
reduce the gamma and neutron heat generation problem in the reactor vessel.
A small gap is placed between the thermal shield and core véssel to provide

: for cooling. Relatively cool fuel from the exit of the primary heat
exchanger will flow up through this gap and into the fuel expansion tank
in the reactor head. This flow has the additional advantages of providing
increased circulation through the head to remove decay heating and to
decrease the temperature in this region to help alleviate the snow problem

(Section k.1.2).
-73-

As mentioned previously the moderator rods are fixed only at the
bottom in order to allow free expansion and thereby reduce the thermal
stress problem. For a similar reason, the remainder of the internal
structure, that is, the reflector, control rod thimble, and the basket
supporting the poison rods, are suspended only from the reactor head,

The only exception to this is the primary heat exchangers which run
straight through the vessel. However as explained in Section 6,3.k, the
thermal stresses obtained were found to be tolerable.

6.2.2 Vessel Design

One of the major advantages of a fused salt system is that
due to the low vapor pressure of the fuel, it is necessary to contain
only small pressures with the core vessel. With a minimum pressure of
30 psia required within the system to prevent pump cavitation and a
pressure rise of approximately 35 psi required across the pumps to provide
fuel flow a normal design differential pressure of only 50 psi is obtained.
Basically this would require a wall thickness of less than one-half of an
inch. However both because off design conditions would undoubtedly occur
and navy requirements of meeting 20 to 30.g shock loads are required, this
thickness was increased to 1-1/2 in, using the ground rules proposed in
Ref. 11, but adapted to Inconel,

Although not shown in the reactor drawing, Figure 3-2, cooling coils
must be included in the head design to take care of internal heat generation.
The possibilities exist of using either the pressure drop across the fuel
pumps to force the flow of a small amount of fuel through suitably con-
structed cooling tubes or to circulate a small percentage of the secondary

salt,

 
Eo

Two possibilities which exist as to the most economical method of
maintaining reactor installations of this type are discussed in Section 11.5.
Basically they affect the vessel design in two different ways: 1) the
vessel should be designed so that it may be reasonably feasible to assemble
and disassemble it several times, or 2) the design should be simplified
with the idea that only one assembly would be required. Because these
concepts were well beyond the scope of this study it was decided to present
a reactor design that could satisfy both. To accomplish this only the
feasibility of a system allowing disassembly had to be shown because this
was the most complex, The alternate solution, being of simpler design,
was not illustrated as the Joints, flanges, etc., would just be changed to
welded structure. In both concepts as described, it was felt to be
desirable from both an economic and a weight standpoint to remove the
reactor from the ship for any maintenance.

To facilitate easy removal, the head is simply butted against the
core vessel and held by the use of a flanged Joint. An omega type seal
is welded across the Joint to provide proper leak tightness. This is in
turn backed up by a steel "0" ring both as a safety precaution against
possible failure of the omega seal and to help prevent fuel from easily
flowing into the ring. If fuel settled in the seal ring, it would add
to the decontamination problem upon reactor disassembly, However, corrosion
would not be a problem because the chief source of corrosion with Inconel
is with a dynamic system flowing over a large temperature difference. Be-
cause flow is prevented in this region, the seal weld will remain at con-
stant temperature and corrosion would be limited to that caused by the

initial chromium solubility.
=75-

The reactor may be disassembled remotely by removing the hold down
bolts and cutting the seal weld. Omega type seal welds of the type
recommended should not present a problem as they have designed for use
in pressurized water reactors at pressures up to 2500 psi. Also mechanisms
for remotely cutting and rewelding these types of omega seals have been
developed for use in the marine PWR systems.

In order to be able to remove the reactor head and replace the primary
heat exchangers it 1s necessary that the secondary fluid inlet and exit
pipes be detachable from the core vessel. Two suggested methods for
doing this are illustrated in Figure 3-2. The one in the reactor head
utilized a concentric tube with the joining weld being made approximately
12 in, off the reactor head for access purposes. This type of joint gives
good rigidity but has the disadvantage of allowing only a limited number
of welds to be wade. Also gince it is a strength weld it would be more
difficult to wake remotely, The bottom connection is fashioned after a
bridgeman closure which is used on many high pressure autoclaves. The
closure provides the structural strength while an omega seal weld similar
to that previously described is used to assure leak tightness, However,
the rigidity of this type of connection under side loads and thermal cycling
is not known.

Methods for the head closure and secondary pipe attachment were
not given detailed consideration but are offered as one of many possible
solutions,

6.2.3 Structural Arrangement

Two possible solutions exist for supporting the basic structure,

however, a detailed study would be required to determine the optimum, The
6-

first of these as shown in Figure 9-3 simply rests the reactor on supporting
structure allowing free vertical expansion, Side play would have to be
limited by guides. A second approach which at first hand appears to be more
advantageous would support the reactor through a beefed-up section just
- below the head flange. This would not only take the weight of the head
and most of the internal structure ott the reactor side walls but also
simplify the basic installation.
6.2.4 Fuel Pumps
Three centrifugal pumps are Located in the reactor head to
provide for fuel flow and to aid in the removal of the fission product
gases. These pumps have common inlet and exit plena and are sufficiently
overdesigned 50 as to allow almost full power redctor operation in the
event of a single pump failure,
To provide for a lightweight and variable speed system (required to
compensate for pump failure) a steam turbine driven motor was selected
for these pumps. A small AC electric motor which could be clutched into
the drive shaft would also be incorporated to maintain circulation under
Zero power operation, Also because it could be switched into the ship's
emergency electric power system, it would serve as a safety device in case
the steam flow to the turbines was interrupted.
A more detailed description of these pumps is given in Section 11.8.
6.2.5 Pressurizer and Expansion Chamber
6.2.5.1 Pressurizer
It is necessary to provide a pressure of at least
15 psig at the inlet of the fuel pumps to prevent cavitation, This pressure

is applied by means of bottled helium gas at startup. After startup, a
helium gas differential pressure of a few pounds 1s maintained at pump
shaft over that in the expansion chamber, to prevent escape of fission
product gases along pump shafts. After initial filling, stable xenon
and krypton generation can be used to maintain pressure. Off-gas systems
to provide for poison gas removal are discussed in Section 11,6.
6.2.5.2 Expansion Chamber

The pumps are so designed as to cause a swirling motion
of fuel in the expansion chamber, so that equilibrium gas-liquid concentration
is guickly reached. A small stream of 1175°F fuel 1s brought up to the
chamber through a passage between thermal shield and core vessel, and
circulated through the chamber to remove heat generated in the chamber
by fission product decay and by fission, (See Appendix 11.2 for heating
calculations).

It is calculated that 150 kw is generated in gas, 157 kw is generated
in liquid due to fission, and 93 kw is generated in liquid due to decay
heat, It is obviously necessary that some heat removal system be incor-
porated to cool off the expansion chamber roof due to this and internal
heat generation as discussed in Section 6.2.2, Assuming that one-half
of the gas heat is absorbed by the roof, a cooling rate of 75 kw, or about
250,000 Btu/hr would be expected at full power. Allowing a 50°F rise in
temperature, this will require circulation through the head of about
8800 1b of fused salt per hour,

A stream flow of 50,600 1b of fuel per hour is required to provide
cooling for liquid in the expansion chamber to prevent snow formation.
Arrangements have been made to bleed off a stream of fuel from the cool

region (1175°F) at the bottom of the reactor, so maximum fuel temperature
278-

in expansion chamber should be the same as maximum temperature in regctor,
that is, 1275°F with a conservatively estimated temperature rise of 100°F.
Thus, maximum temperature of liquid in expansion tank will be about 75°F
less than 1350°F, maximum temperature at which snow problem may be neglected

using fuel 30 (See Ref, 50).

6.3 Primary Heat Exchanger
6.3.1 Design Criteria

The design criteria for the primary heat exchanger is the
same as for the system as a whole; that is, obtaining the lowest specific
weight for the overall power plant consistent with a life of ten thousand
full-power hours, Meeting this goal required the optimization of a com-
bination of several quantities which vary with heat exchanger design.
These are: heat exchanger weight, primary shield weight, pump weight,
and pumping horsepower.

The variables of the heat exchanger design were placed, essentially,
in two categories: 1) those which could be fixed early in the study
dependent on the experience of others doing similar work or due to the
limitations imposed by the rest of the system, and 2) those which were
varied in an extensive parameter study to determine the most favorable
union of these quantities,

6.3.2 Basic Design

The primary heat exchanger is of once-through, counterflow
design. The heat transfer surface is provided by straight Inconel tubes
on a delta lattice which are contained in an annulus surrounding the reactor

core,
=79-

The headers are segments of tori which have an elliptical cross section.
These headers circle the reactor core at the top and bottom of the heat
exchanger, each segment having a nozzle which penetrates the pressure vessel
and primary shield (see Figure 3-2). To provide additional area on the
header surface, the major axis of the ellipse is longer than the width
of the heat exchanger and is tilted with respect to the horizontal,

The secondary coolant flows through the tubes, entering at the bottom
of the heat exchanger. The fuel flows on the outside of the tubes and
enters at the top of the exchanger.

The physical dimensions, flow rates, temperatures, temperature
differences, and heat transfer coefficients for the final primary heat
exchanger design are tabulated below. This heat exchanger would be capable
of removing 125 megawatts of heat from the reactor. See Appendix 6.2

for calculational details.

Inside Heat Transfer Coefficient 914 BTU/Hr-CF-Ft°
Overall Conductance 374 BTU/Hr-CP-Ft°

Straight tubes rather than U-tubes were incorporated in the primary
heat exchanger because 1t would have been difficult to obtain as much
heat transfer area in a given volume with U-tubes. Also, inlet and
outlet headers would have to be in the same end of the reactor, which would
further complicate the space problem. The main advantage of a U-tube
exchanger would be the reduced longitudinal thermal stresses. However,
as will be indicated in a later section, longitudinal thermal stresses
are not expected to be a major problem in this heat exchanger.

The heat exchanger inner diameter and effective length were determined
by the reactor core design, It is necessary that the heat exchanger
tubes be nested closely about the reactor, and be about the same length
as the reactor, in order to achieve the most compact design.

Tube wall thickness was fixed at .O4O inches, primarily because of
corrosion to be expected during ten thousand hours of operation. Although
no corrosion data are available at the temperatures encountered in the
heat exchanger, it has been predicted that a maximum corrosion of twelve
mils on each side of the tube could be expected (see Materials Section 4.2).
This corrosion is of a penetrative nature, with the maximum depth of corrosion
being given for a few scattered displacements. Since it is unlikely that
penetrations on both side of the tube would line up, and because the dis-

placements are not interconnected, a large safety margin is realized in the

 
-81-~

twelve mil estimate. However, twenty-five mils were allowed for corrosion,
with the remaining fifteen being sufficient to contain the pressure and
thermal stresses.

The upper fuel temperature was set at 1275%F to keep the corrosion
within acceptable limits. From examination of other proposed reactor
systems of a similar nature, a mean temperature difference between the
fuel and secondary coolant of 125% was decided on. This is a compromise
value which will give both reasonable heat transfer and permissible thermal
stresses. Further investigation of this system should include an examination
of the effects of changing the tempersture difference.

Many considerations were involved in the selection of a 100°F
temperature drop across each fluid circuit. It is desirable to keep
the temperature drop as large as possible in order to reduce the flow
rates, and hence, pumping requirements. Also, it is necessary to keep
the temperature of the secondary fluid above the melting point of the
fuel which is 970°F, Using a mean temperature difference between the
two fluids of 125° and a 100°F drop across each circuit, the lowest
temperature encountered in the secondary coolant loop will be 1050°F,
which should be safely above the fuel melting ‘temperature,

Since the heat exchanger must be capable of removing 125 megawatts

or h.27 x 108

BTU/hr, choosing the temperature drops automatically sets
the flow rates,

In the final design, the tubes were spaced .030 inches apart on a
delta lattice. The delta lattice was chosen over a square lattice because

it permitted inserting more tubes of a particular size into a given space.

The .030 inch spacing was established by a parameter study which will ve

 
-82-

demonstrated in a later paragraph.

The tube spacing can be maintained by one of several methods, Most
of the present small-tube high performance heat exchanger tests utilize
flattened wire spacers, which sre perpendicular to the tube axes. It
was for spacers of this type that heat transfer and pressure drop cal-
culations on the fuel side of the heat exchanger were wade. More recently,
some work has been done with helical spacers, wrapped about each tube.
Preliminary results indicate that this type of spacers will give about
the same heat transfer with a lower pressure drop.

To facilitate welding, it is necessary that the tubes be spaced at
least .075 inch apart on the tube header (see Ref, 67), This requires
that the headers have a surface area greater than the cross sectional
area of the heat exchanger, but preferably will fit into the same annulus.
As described previously, this was accomplished by making the headers
elliptical in cross section and tilting the ellipse with respect to the
horizontal.

The heat exchanger will be fabricated in bundles of approximately
six hundred tubes each, This is approximately twice the number of tubes
per bundle presently contemplated for the more ‘complex ART fuel-NaK heat
exchanger (see Ref. 36, Section 4.1). ‘Each bundle 1s to be tested individually
in order to simplify inspection and preclude the necessity of scrapping an
entire heat exchanger for a single tube-header Joint failure. Six of
these bundles will then be welded together and capped to make up one header
segment. There will be twelve such segments, each one having a nozzle

penetrating both the upper and lower heads,
-83-

6.3.3 Parameter Study

In the parameter study that was made, the variables were tube
outer diameter and tube spacing. For a given tube diameter and spacing,
a heat exchanger outer dlameter which would give the required mean tein-
perature difference of 125° was determined by an iterative process,

For a selected tube size and spacing, an assumed outer diameter
of the heat exchanger was used to calculate film coefficients. Flow in
the tubes was at all times laminar and an empirical equation for film

conductance during laminar flow (see page 232, Ref, 17),

was used, which takes spacer effects into account. An expression was

derived to give the weight of the heat exchanger plus primary shield
for each configuration. Pressure drops and pumping horsepower can be

determined from flow rates and heat exchanger geometry, Pressure drop

in the tubes was calculated from (See pages 45 and 50, Ref. 15)

where

was used. This expression includes the effect of spacers and is given

in Ref, 13. The weights of the — and drive motors were estimated

at 25 1bs/FHP, The weight of the machinery and equipment not affected
by heat exchanger design was determined. It was assumed that the steam
generation equipment could provide steam for 35,000 shaft horsepower,
normal auxiliary equipment, and 600 pump horsepower. When the calculated
pumping horsepower was less than this, the shaft horsepower was increased
by the difference divided by the efficiency of the pumps.

The total weight was then divided by.the adjusted shaft horsepower
to, give the specific weight, Although this method will not give. the
exact specific weight of the power plant, it will indicate the configuration
vhich will give the lowest specific weight. Tube diameters were varied
from ,1875 inches to .25 inches and spacing from .020 inches to .04O
inches. The results of this study are shown in Figure 6.1,

6.3.4 Stress Considerations
Extensive thermal stress calculations were not made for the
primary heat exchanger. However, the thermal stresses due to the teu-
perature drop across the tube walls were determined, and also the stresses
which will be present due to the difference in longitudinal expansion of
the pressure vessel and heat exchanger tubes for several extreme cases

were calculated.

Due to the rather poor heat transfer characteristics of both fluids
in the heat exchanger, most of the temperature drop is taken across
the fluid films, With a small temperature drop across the tube wall,
the thermal stresses are also quite small.

It was estimated that the containment vessel will be at an average
bemperature of approximately 1225°F, The inside of the vessel will be
cooled with fuel having a temperature of 1175°F and the average tem-
perature will be some 50°F greater than this due to heat generation in
the vessel. The tube temperature can be thought of as being at an
average between the mean wall temperatures or about 1195°F. This gives
a temperature difference of 3007 between the pressure vessel and heat
exchanger tubes, It was assumed that this difference in thermal elongation
would be taken up by mechanical elongation of the heat exchanger tubes
only. This was figured for several extreme situations, one in which the
tubes ran straight from one header to the other and were fixed at both
ends. In this case, the stress in the tubes remained below the yield
stress. Another case was considered in which the ends of the tubes
were bent at right angles and then fixed to the header. In this cage,
the difference in elongation was assumed to be taken up by deflection
of the stub ends. Maximum stresses will again remain below the yield
strength if the stub ends are at least .4 inch long.

In the event that detailed thermal stress calculations prove that
straight tubes are untenable, the tubes could be wrapped partially around
the reactor to provide flexibility in order to alleviate these stresses.

The greatest pressure difference across the tube wall will be less

than 100 psi even if the pumps on either circuit should fail, A cal~

 
-87-

culation was made, assuming that the pressure inside the tubes was 100

psl and the necessary wall thickness came out to be only .01 inch inches.
For the headers, thermal stresses were not considered; however,

pressure stress calculations were made, again assuming an internal pressure

of 100 psi. For this condition, a wall thickness of .1 inch and end cap

thickness of ,375 inch were determined.

7.0 STEAM GENERATING SYSTEM

T.1 Introduction

One of the major problems in adapting nuclear power to naval vessels
has been the development of a dependable steam generating system that will
deliver steam at conditions that are compatible with the requirements for
efficient steam turbine performance. In the design of the steam generators
the group endeavored to duplicate the existing steam conditions of the
931 class destroyer. These conditions are 263,300 1b/hr per boiler room
at 950% and 1200 psi. Tt was decided to replace one boiler room with
a nuclear reactor-steam generating system. Other design criteria were
to keep the thermal stresses as low as possible, to make the system as
light and compact as practical, and to have a realistic and somewhat
‘conservative system,

In the preliminary analysis of the system it was decided that the
reactor power should be 125 megawatts, Therefore, the steam genera ting
equipment was designed to remove 125 megawatts of heat. When the actual
steam cycle data for the class 931 destroyer was received a complete
heat balance revealed that only 95.9 megavatts of heat was necessary to
supply the steam for the full power of 35,000 shp. This makes possible
the operation of the steam generator at lower temperatures and lower At's
throughout the system. Detailed calculations of the design specifications

are presented in Appendix 7.1.

7.2 Molten Salt Cycle Selection

In selecting a cycle or rather a system for steam generation the

 
-89-

group was confronted with the problem of removing 125 megawatts of heat
from a molten salt coolant. The temperature of this salt as it leaves
the primary heat exchangers is to be 1150°F, and it is to reenter the
primary heat exchangers after losing only 100°F in temperature. There-
fore, to remove the full-power 125 megawatts it is necessary to circulate

6 lb/hr. One of the design criteria

the molten salt at a rate of 7.49 x 10
is to keep the temperature drop across tube walls below LOOCF and since
the saturation temperature of water in the boiler is 572°F, then when
allowance is made for the boiling water film temperature drop and for
the molten salt film temperature drop, it is found that the salt entrance
temperature to" the boller should not exceed 800°F. The superheater is
to bring the steam temperature up from 572°F to 975°F. Because of the
high temperature drop across the steam film an entrance temperature
to the superheater of 1150°F and an exit temperature of 1126° would not
exceed the 100°F drop across the tube walls. Therefore, the problem
is to lower the salt temperature from 1126°F to 800°F and then to raise
it from 34°F, the boiler exit temperature, to 1050°F in order to return
it to the primary heat exchanger.

The two methods considered for meeting this problem were to use either
a regenerator heat exchanger between the boiler and superheater, or blenders.
In the regenerator system the 1126°F salt would enter and the 1050°F salt
would leave the hot end of the regenerator heat exchanger while 800°F
salt would leave and 734° salt would enter the cold end. This meant that
some 420 megawatts of heat would have to be exchanged in the regenerator.
Due to the rather poor heat transfer characteristics of the molten salt

and the low log mean temperature difference available, a tremendous heat
¥ TER

-g0-

transfer area would be required. This in turn led fo a very large salt
volume, high pumping power, and prohibitive weight and size.

Attention was then turned to a blending arrangement as a means-of
achieving the desired salt temperatures, It was found that blenders were
being considered by a fused salt power reactor group at ORNL, (Ref. 72).
After consultation it was decided that a blending system would be used
thereby allowing the system to consist of a separate hot and cold loop
(See Figure 3.1). The hot loop circulates the molten salt coolant from
the primary heat exchanger to the superheater, from the superheater
through the pump and blending apparatus, and then back to the primary
heat exchanger. On the discharge side of the hot loop pump, molten
salt at 1050°F is tapped off and fed into the cold loop, This flow
can be regulated by means of a trim valve and serves 2s the heat source
for the cold loop. The cold loop contains the steam generator or
boiler and a pump. The hot salt is fed into the cold loop on the suction
side of the pump from whence it transverses the stean generator. From
the cold side of the boiler the requisite amount of salt is tapped off
and fed into the suction side of the hot loop pump.. This completes
the path of molten salt through the circuit. The salt flow rates in
the superheater and steam generator ave to remain constant at 7.49 x

106

lb/hr. The amount of salt bled from the hot loop to the cold loop at
full power 125 mw is 1.7% x 106 1b/hr. Schematic layouts of this system
are also shown in Figures 7.3 and 10.1,

The fluid horsepower necessary to circulate the molten salt vas

calculated to be 260 hp in the hot loop and 200 hp in the cold loop.

The calculated pressure drop in the superheater was 15.2 psi, in the
-91-

primary heat exchanger 20.5 psi, and in the steam generator 38.7 psi.
Since no finalized piping layout was attempted, the pressure drops due
to line friction, bends, valves, entrances, etc. was estimated. It

is reasonable to assume that these losses would not be as significant
as those in the primary heat exchanger, boiler, and superheater, There-
fore, the molten salt pumping horsepower should not vary greatly from
the above values,

In order to determine the optimum salt line size a short parameter
study was undertaken. Pipes with inner diameters from 7" to 17" vere
investigated. The pressure drop per foot of pipe length was calculated
and from the resulting fluid horsepower a pump weight equivalent was
obtained. (See Figure 7-7). This was combined with the weight of the
salt per foot of pipe length and plotted against the various pipe
diameters. The results showed that the optimum pipe i.d. would be

approximately 11".

7.3 Steam Generator

7.3.1 Types Considered

In selecting a steam generator the general types considered

were (1) the flash boiler, (2) the once through boiler, (3) the natural
circulation, and (4) the forced circulation boiler. Bach was given
serious consideration and the conclusions drawn about each type follows:

(1) Flash Boiler: The only information found about flash boilers
was contained in Reports EPS-X-265, EPS-X-270, and EPS-X-288 by the MIT
Engineering Practice School at Osk Ridge. In these reports it vas

pointed out that the main advantages of flash boilers are that they
-92-

are capable of responding rapidly to load demands because of the small
amount of water contained therein and that it is probable that a high
capacity boiler of reasonable size could be constructed. In the past
the chief disadvantage of flash boilers has been tube burnout, but

this problem is absent in nuclear reactor applications where the coolant
is apt to be a molten salt or metal. The chief reasons for not adapting
this type boiler were for the most part pointed out in the above reports,
They were: (1) the need for high tube wall AT's in order to keep salt
from freezing on tubes, (2) the lack of nozzles that would give an
adequate spray pattern, (3) the need for very long tubes in order to
ensure dry steam at high loads, (U4) the need for a method to insulate
the nozzle headers from the heated tubes, and (5) the general feeling

of the group that, although flash boilers show great promise, much more
developmental work is needed.

(2) Once-Through Boiler: Once-through boilers have been used in
Europe for a number of years and have recently come into their own in
this country with the installation of the supercritical units at Philo
and Eddystone. They offer the advantage of boiling and superheating
in a continuous passage thereby eliminating the need for heavy steam
drums. A once-through boiler also offers the advantages of rapid response
to load changes, compactness, and ease of arrangement. The principle
disadvantages are lack of water storage, the need for very high purity
water, and, especially for nuclear reactor applications, the thermal
stress problem. As was stated in Section T.2 the stresses encountered
when boiling water st 572°F with a salt at 1100°F introduces intolerable

conditions. Therefore, it was necessary to separate the boiler and super-

 
93

heater thus eliminating the chief advantage of the once~-through boiler.

(3) Natural Circulation Boiler: The natural circulation boiler
is perhaps the conventional steam generator for marine use. Unfortunately,
here the problem of arrangement is encountered. It is necessary to have
a large drum at high elevation and a downcomer collector drum or drums,
Also the problem of whether to put the molten salt in tubes or let ib
be on the shell side must be considered. Reports such as KAPL-1450,
"Review of SIR Project Model Steam Generator Integrity", seem to indi-
cate that the best results for a liquid metal coolant such as sodium
would be obtained by placing the coolant in the tubes with the water
on the shell side. However, these experiments were all done using
stainless steel. In the steam generator proposed in this report Inconel
is to be used and with the obvious weight saving obtainable by placing
the high pressure steam-water mixture in the tubes it was concluded
that the water-tube system was the more advantageous,

In order to find some compact method of arranging a natural-circulation
water-tube boiler with a molten salt as s heat supplying medium, a number
of different configurations were considered. The most promising appeared
t0 be a Lewis boiler which employs Field tubes. A Field tube is really
a tube-within-a-tube., The inner tube acts as an essentially unheated
downcomer. The bottom of the inner tube discharges into the sealed off
end of the outer tube. The outer tube is heated and scts as the riser.
High recirculation rstios are obtained with this type boiler. Also, since
one end of the tube is free, there are little thermal expansion problems,
The Lewis type boiler has several other advantages but its chief dis-

advantage would be the arrangement of a header sheet since it does have
~9h-

the complication of a tube within-a-tube., The tubes must also be of the
order of 12' to 15' and 1% was felt that possibly some other arrangement
would offer greater compactness.

(4) Farced Circulation Boiler: The forced circulation boiler was selected
for the basic study because of 1ts compactness and flexibility of arrangement,
Use could be made of a nearly conventional steam drum, and the tubes could
be bent into a "U" shape to reduce the thermal expansion problem. The
steam output could be controlled by the circulating water pump. The forced
circulation boiler is simple in design and principle and is well proven
in marine applications.

7.3.2 Design of the Selected Steam Generator

The collection of appropriate and adequate data for the steam
generating system proved to be a task of no small proportions. The molten
salt was assumed to behave as a normal Newtonian fluid. Data is available
from experiments performed at ORNL giving the heat transfer characteristics
for heat exchangers, particularly delta-array. This data was used for all
salt side heat transfer coefficients (See Figure 7.6). The molten salt
flow through the steam generator is in the laminar region with Reynolds
Numbers of 200 to 300. This is due to this particular salt's high viscosity
in the temperature range to be used. The data for boiling water heat
transfer characteristics was hardly as easy to get. Wide variances are
to be found in the literature for water boiling in tubes under pressure,
After consulting with a group of industrial boiler designers it was decided
to use a value of 6000 Btu/hr-£42-OF for the heat transfer area calculations.
A value of 2000 Btu/hr-£t2-OF was assumed for scale deposits collecting on

the water side of the tubes. In the report, "Studies in Boiling Heat Transfer"
-95«

(UCLA Report No. C00-24), the conclusion was drasm that for water boiling
in tubes in the pressure range from 1000 psi to 2500 psi, the difference
between the tube wall temperature and the water saturation temperature is
independent of the heat flux. According to this data the value of ty = Boat
that might be expected at 1250 psi was about 1k.5°, (See Appendix 7.1,
Section-5A). - In McAdams (Ref, 17, page 393) the equation, ty, - tg.y =
Ls(e/" ; indicates clearly that the boiling film temperature drop is
pony Pru and pressure dependent. These equations were used to determine
the temperature drop across the tube walls at points of maximum heat flux,
The McAdems equation gave the lowest film drop with a value of 9.6°F,

This in turn gave the maximum wall At of 85.2% at the maximum heat flux

of 172,000 Btu/hr-rt2,

It was decided to bring water into the steam generator at 565%p, seven
degrees below the saturation temperature. This water would be a mixture of
the recirculating water which is at the saturation temperature of 572°F
and the feedwater which is at 4B6CF. The water entrance velocity into
the tubes is 8 ft/sec. At the tube exit the dryness fraction is 0.11 which
corresponds to a SBV of 65 percent, This is approximately the maximum
steam by volume for this temperature and pressure that will still give
good wetting of the tube walls (Ref. 21).

A brief parameter study was undertaken to determine the most sultable
tube size and tube pitch. It was concluded from this study that in balancing
heat transferred against pumping power required, it should be possible to
go to smaller tube size than usually used in oil fired boilers. Upon

recommendation from ORNL personnel experienced with steam generators it

was decided that a 1/2" 1.4. tube was the smallest suitable tube, The tube

 
wall thickness compatible with the operating temperatures and pressures was
calculated to be 1/16", and from salt pressure drop considerations the
closest tube pitch was computed to be 3/4",

Once the tube size was set (the recirculation ratio and steam flow
rate are known), the number of tubes necessary to carry the full power flow
rate could be determined. The steam flow rate for the 125: megawatt design
as calculated from a heat balance is 456,000 lb/hr. The number of tubes
for ‘the steam generator is then 2336.

The heat transfer area was calculated in two parts. The area necessary
to raise the water temperature to the saturation point was calculated. The
overall heat transfer coefficient in the water heating region is 425 Btu/
hr-£2.%p and the log mean temperature difference is 195°F, The heat trans-
fer area for this region is 3050 £62, This total area of 3854 £42 made
necessary a tube length of 10,1 ft,

It was decided that the tubes should be bent into "U" shape for reduction
of the thermal expansion problem. Calculations also showed that it would be
best to split the 2336 tubes into 8 bundles. This would keep the salt
Jacketed vessels to a reasonable size and wall thickness, and would reduce
the header thickness and weight,

Of all the steam generator parts it was thought that the headers would
present the greatest problem: It was concluded that there was no reason '
why the tubes could not be run directly into the steam drum. The salt
Jacket could be attached directly to the drum or by expansion joints. The
tubes would“be "U0" shaped and —— from the drum as illustrated in Figure
7.1. A water header would be at the other end of the tube bundle. This

header could be of éither flat head or dished head design, The hot (800°F)
-97-

salt would be introduced into the jacket just under the drum and heat baffle
would shield the drum from contact with the high temperature salt, The
molten salt would leave the jacket just below the water inlet header.

Four salt jackets containing tube bundles are attached to the bottom
of each of two drums. The tubes serve the purpose of risers. They dis-
charge their steam-water mixture into the drum where the steam is separated
by mechanical separators and scrubbers, The water leaves the drum through
the downcomers which are located on the bottom side of the drum along with
the salt jackets. The water in the downcomers is at the saturation tem-
perature of 572°F, This water is blended with the 486°F feeduater and the
resulting vater temperature is 565%F, (The saturation pressure at this
temperature is 1180 psia or approximately TO psi below the steam generator
operating pressure), This water is forced back to the water inlet headers
by the circulation pimp.

The design capacity of the steam generator is 456,000 1v/hr. The water
flow rate is 4,149,500 1b/hr and the salt temperature drop as it traverses
the steam generator is 76°F. At the 95.9 mw power load the full Dover stean
demand is 355,030 lb/hr and the salt temperature drop is 58.8°F. At this

o
power the inlet the outlet temperatures will be lowered to 761.8°F and T03 F,

7.4 The Supérheater

It was felt that the superheater design would be the most straight
forward of the steam generating system. The superheater is to take the
saturated steam at 572%F and heat it to 950°F, The 125 mw capacity of the
superheater was to be 348,000 lb/hr but the capacity necessary for 35,000

shp is 263,300 1b/hr,
-98=

Again, investigation showed that tubes of the smallest practical
diameter would give the best heat transfer characteristics, Tubes of 0.5"
0.D. and 0.4" I,D, were selected. A steam exit velocity of 100 ft/sec
was chosen as the maximum practical velocity, To carry the flow at this
velocity 722 tubes were necessary, It was decided to space these tubes
at a pitch of 3/4". This gave a molten salt velocity of 11.55 ft/sec
and ‘a pressure drop of 1.33 psi/ft. The salt inlet temperature is 1150°F
at 125 mev and 1138.3°F at 95.9 mev, The exit temperatures are 1126°F
and 1120,4°F respectively. The overall heat transfer coefficient is 291
Btu/nr-£42-OF and the heat transfer area is 1070 £2, This gives a tube
length of 11.% ft. The maximum heat flux was calculated to be 231,000
Btu/hr-£t° and the maximum tube wall At vas 80°F.

The superheater vessel is "U" shaped with the headers at both ends,
(See Figure 7.2) The tube bundle runs through the vessel with the tubes
arranged in a delta-array. As is the case in the steam generator the
headers were considered to present the greatest actual problem. Numerous
header arrangements can be devised but the best seem to be either a dished

or flat head,

7.5 Auxiliary Equipment and Arrangement
7.5.1 The Steam Drum and Desuperhester
The steam drums are an integral part of the steam generator
and contain the mechanical steam-water separators, the steam scrubbers, and
the desuperheater tubes. It was decided to use the two conventional drums
of the class 931 destroyer boiler room with the attachment of the molten

salt jackets to their undersides and the replacement of the conventional
-99=

risers with 5/8" o0.d. tubes as described in Section 7.3.1. The drum material
is to be Inconel but the separators and scrubbers are to be of conventional
design. The drum dlameter is 52.2" and the bottom shell thickness is 4.8",

The desuperheater will consist of tubes running through the saturated
water in the drum. It is necessary to desuperheat 5340 1v/hr of steam when
running at 35,000 shp., Superheated steam at 950°F and 1235 psia will enter
the drum in the tubes and be cooled to 650°F,

The arrangement of the steam generating equipment around the reactor
and within the secondary shield would be as shown in Figure 7.3. It is
realized that the actual design of the steam and salt piping within the
secondary shield requires careful analysis, which is particularly necessary
to keep stresses due to relative thermal expansion within reason. However,
neither time nor talent permitted such an analysis for this study, and
therefore only a reasonable estimate would be made for the volume required
for this plumbing.

As shown, in Figure 7.3, there would be two identical salt and steam
systems. It would be desirable to have all pump driver accessible from
outside the secondary shield. It was therefore proposed that the secondary salt
pumps be mounted on the top and drive through the secondary shield. Similarly,
the water recirculation pumps could drive through the aft face of the secondary
shield,

7.5.2 Feedwater Heater and Other Components

Although most of the equipment following the superheater in the
steam generating system will remain unchanged, several components will no
longer be necessary when the two furnaces are replaced by a reactor and at

least one new item must be added to the system.
=101-

I

to keep pump turbine weights down. If these pump turbines are assumed to
be expanding the steam to the same extent as ‘the main feed — turbines,
which also operate on superheated steam, the enthalpy contained in their

exhaust would be more than sufficient to make up that lost by the exclusion
of the forced draft blowers and fuel oil pumps.

In order %o maintain the deaerator saturation pressure at 18 psig at
full load; a somewhat greater quantity of auxiliary turbine exhaust must
be bled back to the main condensers. This in turn will probably require
the addition of several condenser tubes to maintain the former condenser
vacuum. Calculations show that at full power 12, 530 pounds per hour of
auxiliary turbine exhaust must be bled to the condenser, if a deaerator
pressure of 18 psig is to be maintained.
7.5.3 Feedwater Treatment
Just how much feedwater treatment would be necessary to

ensure long-term trouble free service from the steam generators was one
of the many problems that the group did not have time to investigate.
The conventional destroyer supplies distilled water to the oil fired systeu
and no attempt was made to answer the question of whether or not further
treatment by lon-exchangers would be necessary for the reactor heated
steam generators. However, a heat transfer coefficient of 2000 Btu/hr-rt°-°F
was included for scale. deposit, which should be conservative. It should
be pointed out that the replacement of the oil-fired furnace by a fused salt
system makes the steam generation equipment relatively clean, and therefore
the use of ion exchangers to further reduce the water impurities way be

Justified. Such a system should be a large improvement in cleanliness and

require much less maintenance than the conventional oil-fired boiler,
-102-

7.6 Part Load Operation

The method of achieving a certain steam rate for loads which are some
fraction of full power will depend upon the method by which the reactor is
held at part load. Presumably, the flow rate of the molten salt coolant
and the average teuperature of the reactor will remain the same, but the
temperature rise of the molten salt coolant as it passes through the primary
heat exchangers will vary according to load.. Thus in the hot molten
salt loop, which includes the superheater, primary heat exchanger, one
of the pumps and part of the blending apparatus, the average temperature
and salt flow rate will remain constant and the inlet and outlet temperatures
of the superheater will change appropriately as will the amount of molten
salt that. ls bled off as the heat source for the cold or steam generator
loop. The average temperature of the steam generator can be either raised,
lowered, or held the same according to the amount of salt bled from the
hot loop. It was found that in lowering the power from 125 mw to 95.9 mw
the average température. of the steam generator could be lowered 38° thus

alleviating the. thermal stress problem somewhat,

8.0 REACTOR ANALYSIS

8.1 Nuclear Configuration
Figure 3-2 schematically indicates the physical picture of the core

and reflector which will be described in detail below. General overall
nuclear concepts of this high performance physically small system are
modifications and combinations of advanced design ideas of ANP Technology under
consideration &t the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. Ref. 36. Physically,

the core is a circulating, fused fluoride, uranium bearing salt flowing

through a beryllium oxide moderating ma trix and incorporating an inelastic
scattering metal reflector, Systems of these types feature high power

density and relatively high operating temperatures.

Numerous nuclear advantages are manifested by these systems. The
released energy is easily extracted from the core in that it is generated
in and transferred out by the same fluid, Fluid fuel systems are, in
general, self regulating under small perturbations away from nominal
operating conditions due to prompt volume expansion within the fuel. Thirdly,

much of the energy released in the fission process other than the kinetic
energy of the fission fragments is retained and collected through cooling
"moderator, reflector and internal neutron and gamma ray shielding with
the coolant-fuel. Other advantages are low operating pressures and the
relative ease of extracting volatile fission products.

Disadvantages include, large fuel inventory required from excess fluid
for component cooling, heat exchangers, pumps, core inlet and exit plena,

A relatively serious hazard is present in this circulating fuel system,

specifically, the containment of a corrosive, multicurie fluid at high

oe EEE
-11l-

temperatures. Requirements in maintaining the fused salt liquidous during
shutdown also burden these system.

Limitations were necessarily placed upon the nuclear design to:meet
the requirements of metallurgy, heat transfer and nuclear design, and to
narrow the breath of the study. With the choice of a fused fluoride fuel,
no point in the system can be at a temperature less than its solidification
value (in the order of 980°F) and no point should exceed a temperature
~ at which rapid corrosion takes place. All fluid surfaces should be Inconel
clad to a thickness which will withstand 10,000 full power hours of
operation. Power densities will be high, but not enough to’ induce
dangerous thermal stresses in all materials, Resulting limitations

restricted the design to the following specifications:

Mean Core Temperature 1150°F to 1250°F

Primary Fluid Surfaces 30 mils cladding Inconel
or greater

Maximum Pover Density 1200 watts/em3 fuel

Core Dimensions Right circular cylinder

70 cm in diameter 80
cm in height

8.1.1 Moderator Matrix
The moderating matrix consists of rods comprised of beryllium
oxide, three-quarters of an inch in diameter, clad in 40 mils of Inconel,
Radially, the rods will be close packed in a triangularly pitched array.
The pitch is defined by the selected volume fraction of moderator in core.
Beryllium oxide "meat" extends the entire length of the core, and joining

on each end of meat will be, one and a half inches of boron-10, BeO ceramic

 
~112-

material to suppress fission in the core inlet and exit plena, Ends of
the elements neck down forming the plena and joining the structural members.
See Figure 3.2.

8.1.2 Reflector

An inelastic scattering reflector is utilized in. the system,

This choice has not been proven superior to an elastic moderating material
such as beryllium oxide, but it is believed to contribute definite advantages
over BeO in this specific application,

The choice of a nickel reflector is based upon the fact that this
material possesses excellent slowing down characteristics in the higher
neutron energy range, which is of considerable Importance in this inter-
mediate reactor. Secondly, relatively small amounts of cooling will ve
required for the reflector and therefore it will retain its desirable
nuclear properties to a large degree. This high atomic number material
will attenuate core gamma rays very strongly and thus reduce the required
gamma ray shielding. Also, fast neutron leakage out of the reflector is
within acceptable limits and is only of minor concern in fast neutron shielding.

Time did not permit the detail investigation and comparison of systems
incorporating elastic and inelastic reflectors; intuitive reasoning lead us
to the nickel reflector. The resulting reflector is comprised of a 6 inch thick
cylindrical shell 29.6 inches in inside diameter surrounding the core. Cooling
annuli penetrate the nickel vertically through the reflector and coolant is
supplled from the lower plenum, Estimated coolant required will occupy 2
vercent of the reflector’s volume,

8.1.3 Fuel

Numerous types of fluoride salts are available,but in a large
-113-

ma jority, the existing data on their properties (corrosion, thermal and
mechanical) are limited. Therefore, it was necessary to make the basic
criterion in the selection of the fuel depend upon the technology presently
available. The resulting selection contained ZrF, NaK and UF), (See
Section k.1). Unfortunately the nuclei constitubing this fuel lack some
of the more desirable nuclear properties. Namely, it contains nuclei of
high atomic number and thus has poor slowing down properties. Both zirconium
and sodium have significant absorption cross sections in the intermediate
energy range, although their thermal absorption cross sections are relatively
small. Due to the large volume fraction of fuel in the core, any added
neutron moderating material in the fuel will in general, reduce critical
mass and the average energy of the neutron number density in the core,
Although these changes will not be large, they will be significant.

Other possible cations which could replace zirconium or sodium are
beryllium and lithium. Beryllium fluoride lacks corrosion compatibility
with Inconel although it would contribute appreciably to the neutron moderation
of ‘the core. Lithium fluoride also attacks Inconel and only isotopic lithium-7
could be considered due to high epithermal and thermal absorption cross

section of elemental lithium,

8.2 Parametric Study

An investigation into the nuclear characteristics of the described core
containing various ratios of beryllium oxide to fuel were deemed necessary
in the selection of a feasible design. The principle objective of the study
was to determine the critical U-235 concentration in the fused salt, and to

minimize this value through varying moderator to fuel ratio. Secondly, the
-11h-

total fuel inventory was to be minimized through the selection of a critical
fuel concentration and fuel volume in the core, The range of investigation
was limited between 0.4 to 0.6 volume percent fuel by the power density in
the fuel at the lower limit and lack of sufficient neutron moderation in
the core at the upper limit,

Group-diffusion methods were the means of analysis; specifically, a
3 group 3 region, one dimensional ORACLE diffusion code Ref. 60. Region
allocation were to: (1) control rod thimble, 5 cm in radius, (2) core,
cylindrical shell 32.5 cm thick and outside radius at 37.5 cm and (3) the
nickel reflector 15.24 cn thick. The constituents of the regions are as
follows, measured in volume percent. Region 1; Inconel 19%; Void 81%;
Region 2: Inconel, BeO, and Fluoride Salt ~- variables Region 3; Nickel - 100%.

8.2.1 Cross Sections

For the parametric study, the mean core temperature was taken

as 1200°F., This condition results in a mean neutron energy of 0.0795 cu at thermal
equilibrium with the core materials, assuming no thermal spectrum hardening,
Energy boundaries for the three groups were selected on the following basis;
(1) Some existing data available for these chosen boundaries, and (2) these
boundaries were suggested by the spectral distribution of fission from multi-
group analyses of similar reactors, Ref, 59.

were neglected and the assumption of free atom scattering was made throughout

with the above noted exception.

result from analytical approximations to the energy dependent cross section,

8.2.2 Summary of Results
Based upon the philosophy set forth as to the general concept of
the over-all design study, the following criteria were utilized in the

selection of a core design from the results of the parametric study, Of
-117-

ma jor importance is the power density within the fuel which must be main-
tained below 1200 watts per cmd of fuel to ingure the reliability and
integrity of the beryllium oxide moderator rods. Thermal stress induced
in these rods through gamma ray and neutron energy deposition must be
maintained within safe levels. Also, as stated previously, it is desired
. to minimize the fuel concentration in the fused salt and to maximize the
utilization of the uranium investment. In addition, the reactor should
be kept operable with a maximum of thermal fissions, reducing both fuel
investment and control problems.

It was concluded on the bases of these data presented in Figures 8.1
and 8.2 and Table 8.22, case 2 (50.9 percent fluid volume in core) justify
the above criteria most satisfactorily. Case 3, with the decreased fuel
fraction, is eliminated automatically by its high power density and uranium
concentration in the fuel. Although case 1 (61 percent volume) indicates
larger safety margins with respect to power density along with an impercepti-
ble difference in fuel concentration compared with case 2, this system

- exhibits 20 percent less thermal fissions.
The twenty percent increase in thermal fissions with case 2, indicates
. lower average energy of the neutron number density in its energy distribution,
It is believed this system will exhibit more control with an absorbing con-
trol rod than the faster system.

8/2.3 Control Rod Study

Realizing the system under investigation would operate pre-
dominately in the intermediate energy range, control of the system must
be achieved through degradation in energy of fast and intermediate neutron

to thermal energies and result as a loss to the system through absorption.

This requires the control element to contain both moderating and absorbing
materials. One centrally located rod was investigated and 5.4 percent
reactivity control (see Table 8.2.3) was obtained with the element con-
taining the following materials: 19 percent by volume Inconel, 24 percent
BeO, LO percent nickel with 1 percent by wt 3° and 17 percent void for
rod thimble clearance.

It has been concluded that 5.4 percent control is adequate as a
minimum value. (Leave as a minimum, 3.7 percent shutdown margin.) There-
fore, only one control element would be required, However, the above
design was not considered adequate in that heat transfer across the
clearance gap was insufficient.

An alternate consideration immersed the rod in a bath of sodium,
filling the clearance gap. Also, the rod thimble would at all times be
filled with sodium and upon insertion, displaced sodium would be forced
into a small reservoir located outside the pressure vessel. 6.1 percent
control was achleved with this system and also 1 percent reactivity was
added to the system with no rod penetration. See Table 8.2.3 below.

The specified boron content was only a means of analysis, Due to
the damaging metallurgical instabilities resulting from high irradiation
exposures of boron in metal, it is recommended that the B-10 equivalence

of a Buropium Oxide dispersion in nickel be used as control rod material,

 
-122-

This oxide also exhibits more reliable control during operating life in that
very large exposures are required to obtain substantial burnup, hence only
a small loss in control will be observed upon long exposures. The following

ditions, graphical results are presented in Figure 8.3.

these effects. The development of this perturbation technique is presented
in Appendix 8.2.

8.3.3 Burnup and Fission Product Poisons

 

One advantageous feature of the large fuel inventory required
for this system is the extended endurance of fuel life. The large fuel
volume is circulated continuously through the active core and burnup is
achieved homogeneously throughout the fuel, thus extending life by
approximately a factor of six over a stagnant fluid system.

Endurance in the order of 4000 full power hours is expected as the life
of the initial core loading. This represents relatively small burnup (0.5%)
periodic additions of fuel are possible and would greatly enhance the life-
time. It is believed the system will operate for the 10,000 full power
hours of reactor life, with only minor additions of fuel to the initial
loading.

In this analysis, non-volatile fission products were approximated as
equivalent to 100 barns of added absorption in the thermal group and 10
barns added absorption in the intermediate group per fission event. It
is believed the above approximation results in an over approximation of
the non-volatile fission product poisons.

Burnup and fission product poison effects upon reactivity were treated
Jointly as reviewed in Appendix 8.3. Results are presented in Figure 8.7.

8.3.5 Xenon Poison
As discussed previously (Sec. 4 ), the removal of volatile
fission products can be achieved with relatively high efficiency in a high
temperature, liquid fuel system. Provisions for periodic removal of the
volatile matter are incorporated in the system design. of \
most concern in estimating xenon polsoning is the efficiency of iodine
and xenon removal which in a large extent is dependent upon their solubility
in the fuel at these temperatures. If there were no removal of these
elements, the steady state poisoning is valued at -0.297 percent reactivity for
an average thermal flux of 1.97 x 1013 neutrons per cu -gec. Assuming a high
degree of removal, the poisoning is approximately as 10% of the steady state
value with no removal, Poisoning worth of xenon is evaluated as 0.03 per-
cent in reactivity.
8.3.6 Delay Neutron Loss
Circulating fuel reactors suffer from a loss of delay neutrons

in that a fraction of the delay neutron precursors undergo neutron emission

 

 
-132-

in the external fuel circuit, Loop time for the circulating is 1,127
seconds of which 0,287 seconds are spent in the active core. For small
loop times compared to the delay times of the neutrons, a valid approximation
to the required excess reactivity required to compensate this loss is given
by: (Ret. 69)

14.0 kgm U-235 addition to the critical mass (71.75 kgus) are required
to produce this excess. Total fuel inventory for the initial startup
(k = 1.0275) is 605 kgm of uranium-235,

8.3.8 Control Requirements

Under nominal operation during initial startup (no burnup)

the control rod must suppress 1.65% in reactivity (burnup, fission pro-
ducts and temperature excess). This requirement places the control
penetration into the core as 30 cm, Control curve in Figure 8.8 indicates
core reactivity as a function of rod penetration. In obtaining this
curve, we have assumed the axial flux distribution as cosine in nature

and the positional worth as a function of the flux-squared.

9.0 SHIELDING

9.1 Introduction

The shielding of HPMR breaks down into two main calculational phases:

(1) a neutron physics evaluation of the core, reflector, poison rod
region and heat exchanger complex with a flux plot and sodium activation
in the secondary salt.as end result, and (2) the shielding of the resultant
radlations produced by the neutron captures and activation,

The following shield write up gives a look into the general methods
used and assumptions made. No attempt is made to give a detailed
analysis of the shield calculation complete with sample calculations, ete,

It is assumed that the reader 1s familiar with the reactor materials
and configuration, and reactor compartment arrangement from previous

sections (Sections 6 and 7).

9.2 Neutron Flux Calculation

The neutron flux in the reactor vessel was approached with two methods,
The primary one was with three group-three region ORACLE calculations.
The secondary approach was to utilize comparisons of the ORACLE results
with multigroup work done on the ART configuration. It should be stated that
both these approaches leave much to be desired. The 3G3R ORACLE code
is set up for low absorbing systems. In some HPMR regions the absorption
is close to the value at which the code will not accept the calculation.
Extrapolation of ART multigroup data to HPMR is a bit shaky as the con-

figurations are quite different,

 
 

-136-

The ‘cross section data and programming methods are the same as
described in’ Section 8.0, The main difference between the reactivity
calculations done under Section 8.0 and the ORACLE shielding work was
in the choice of regions. Two geouwetries were programmed. . The first
took the core as region one, nickel reflector as region two and BeO-
Boron poison rod region as region three, This gave a three group flux
plot to the outside of the poison region with leakage currents into the
Inconel support sheet. The second ORACLE calculation considered the heat
exchanger region as a slab, region one, with two inches of Inconel as
a symmetric reflector, region.two. The absolute values of the three
group flux in the core can be determined from reactor power, The more
unorthodox problem of establishing the value of the flux in the heat
exchanger, a subcritical multiplying system with a delayed plus inside
wall leakage neutron source, vas done with a two. group, one region hand
calculation where only a uniformly distributed emission of delayed neutrons
vas used as a source. This was checked with another, independent two
group one region hand calculation worked out in a different manner. Both
calculations gave a fast flux of about 2 X 1018 neuts/cc-sec at the
heat exchanger centerline. Scaling up the ART multigroup flux taking in-
to account the increase in heat exchanger thickness of HPMR over ART
and summing into two group energy intervals gave a fast flux value of
roughly 2.5 x 10%? neuts/cc-sec.

Looking at the results of these three calculations a flux value of
2.3 x 1012 was chosen as a flightly conservative value of centerline fast
flux (group one plus group two of three groups) due to delayed neutrons

and fission neutrons in the heat exchanger,

 
~137-

A three group flux plot through the reactor pressure vessel wall
was then constructed from the flux distribution given by the ORACLE calcu-
lations and the absolute centerline flux values found as described in the
above paragraph. From the centerline of the core through the BeO-Boron
poison region this was a straight normalization. In the Inconel support
sheet, thermal shield, pressure vessel, and the heat exchanger, exponential
attenuation was assumed with the same slope as in the nickel reflector and
BeO-Boron poison region, This is justifiable on the basis of ORACLE
results in which the fast neutron attenuation through the nickel and BeO-
Boron region was approximately the same, indicating the slope is not a
strong function of material, To the three group exponentials were added
the heat exchanger flux values taking into account a subcritical multipli-
cation of 1.43 from an ORACLE estimate of K of 0,3. The resultant summation
is represented in Figure 9-1A by the flux to the outside of the pressure
vessel, The flux through the thermal shield was determined essentially by
diffusion theory from the ORACLE computations, From the pressure vessel
to the outside of the secondary shield, removal cross sections and 11d tank
plots were used.

The fast and epithermal groups (#8, and os on Figure 9-1A) were summed
together and removal cross sections used for attenuation through the one
inch of immer shield tank steel and five inches of primary shield lead.

ART 11d tank data were utilized from the lead water interface on out through
the water. The 1id tank ANP mockup was a reflected moderated configuration
and substituted one foot of beryllium in lieu of HPMR's 6 inches of nickel,

5-1/4 inches of BeO-Boron poison and 3/4 inches of Inconel, The ART mockup

 
-138-

only allowed for a 4 inch versus HPMR's 10 inch heat exchanger and h-1/2
inches of lead as against HPMR's 5 inches, However, if vas the closest
mockup configuration with neutron flux data available. The energy spectrum
emerging from the mockup lead ard HPMR should not be too greatly different
‘as the game main elements are present although in different volume fractions,
The relation between fast and thermal flux was taken from work done in
Reference 73. However, -the thermal flux plot presented in thie report

does not compare with the shape of that of Reference 73, as Figure 9-1B

is based on more recent information and does not contain the Hurwitz plane
to sphere transformation, Lid tank and shield tank water was 1.45% boron.
The flux plot shown in Figure 9-1B then reflects the shape of the above
mentioned flux distributions combined with the absolute fast flux value

at the lead water interface as determined by removal cross section
attenuation of the ORACLE based flux in the thermal shield. Absolute
values of thermal flux were then known in the thermal shield and at the
lead water interface (by relation to the fast flux). The thermal flux
distribution between these points were estimated from inspection of WAPD's
F1W flux plot where a similar configuration existed.

As reported in Reference 73, the fast neutron flux relaxation length
approaches a constant as a function of distance in water at water thicknesses
on the order of 140 centimeters or greater. Lid tank thermal data only
went out 140 centimeters in water, From ART neutron shield work it was
asgumed that the thermal neutrons reached an equilibrium state with the
fast flux at about 140 centimeters of water. In the shield design, as
shown in Figure 9-1B, exponential attenuation was used for fast and thermal

neutron flux beyond 240 centimeters radius.

A fast and thermal neutron flux. distribution was estimated through
the north head into the primary shield plug based on the behavior of the
ORACLE calculated horizontal flux through the heat exchanger. This vas

used to determine thickness of shielding needed above the reactor.

9.3 Secondary Salt Sodium Activation

With the neutron flux situation estimated in the heat exchanger the
secondary salt sodium activation was determined as the gamma source
strength in designing the secondary shield.

The average flux in the heat exchanger was calculated by numerically
integrating the three group heal exchanger flux {as shown in Figure 9-14)
in a radial direction and then dividing by the heat exchanger thickness,

No credit was taken for flux distribution in an axial direction as this
would have been at best a rough estimate. Neglecting axial flux distribution
was the conservative approach.

Sodium cross sectional data was taken from Reference 61 and was con-
verted into three group averages as done in Section 8.0, This was checked
by independently three group averaging some earlier unpublished Curtiss-
Wright wultigroup cross sections. Both averages accounted for the sodium
resonance peak at 300 kev.

Knowing the atomic density of sodium in the secondary salt, and the
three group averaged cross sections and flux, the activation was determined
by their product:

This gave a value of 4300 curies total activation when multiplied by the

volume of salt in the heat exchanger (13.5 cu ft) and divided by 3.7 x 101°,

9.4 Dose Tolerance Levels

The basis for the HPMR is a maximum dose rate of 300 mrem/veek and
20 hour a week access time to spaces immediately adjacent to the reactor
compartment (auxiliary engine room aft and above and the storage compartment
in old fuel oil deep tank forward of the reactor compartment), Ten percent
of this is maximum allowed fast neutron dose. Reduced to terms of mrem per
hour, this is a total of 15 mrem/br with not more than 1.5 mrem/hr in
neutron dose. This set a fast neutron flux limit of 15 neutrons per cn?
per sec taking the predominant neutron energy at 0.5 mev became the fast
neutron source is mainly from delayed neutrons born in the heat exchanger,
A flux of 10 n/om-sec at 0.5 mev is taken as giving one mrem/hr (AEC
Standards For Protection Against Radiation, Part 20 of Title 10 of the code

of federal regulations, February 28, 1957).

9.5 General Shield Arrangement

At this point the steam generating equipment sizes had been firmed
up to the extent that a reactor compartment arrangement could be worked
out, This was done with compactness and minimum shielding weight as the
criteria with maximum use of the available fuel oil for shielding purposes.
The arrangement chosen placed the reactor with primary shield tank forward
and steam generating equipment aft. This layout allowed a smaller primary
shield tank, as the steam generators helped shadow shield the gamma and
neutron leakage from the primary shield tank. Fuel oil attenuated this
leakage out the forward, port, and starboard sides of the shield tank.

The fast neutron dose determined the thickness of hydrogenous material
required to attenuate to tolerance dose level (Section 9.4). Approximations
of the gamma dose with simplified geometries and source energies determined
the predominant radiations and gave estimates of lead thicknesses, With
‘estimates of secondary shield thicknesses the general shielding arrangement
shown in Figure 9-3 was laid out with a judgement estimate of the best pro-
portion of shield material in primary shield to shield material in secondary
shield,

In light of a last winute alteration (Reference 73) in the shape of
the fast neutron attenuation curve in water (this change is incorporated
in Figure 9-1B) a foot of polyethyene should be packed around the after
slide of the shield tank at locations not shadow shielded by steam generating
equipment as shown in Figure 9-3. This will have to be fitted around existing

piping as it was not allowed for in the original arrangement,

9.6 Primary Shield

The primary shield designed for adequate fast neutron attenuation and
with estimated gamma attenuation was then checked in more detail for adequate
gamma attenuation, All gamma sources listed in Table 9-1 were considered .
with the energy distribution indicated in the table and with a simplified
source shape most closely approximating the actual source geometry. Form-
ulations as given in Rockwell's shield design manual (Ref. 33) for lines,
disks, cylinders and truncated cones with uniform and exponential source
distributions were used, All dose values below .0005 mr /hr outside the
secondary shield were neglected. The gamma dose from fission products
in the heat exchanger, prompt gammas in core and heat exchanger, and water-
lead capture gammas in the primary shield tank were considered in more
detail as described below,

The fission products constitute an important radiation source as they
are rapidly circulated with a reactor cycle time of 1-2 seconds. This
invalidates nuclear data on gamma energies and decay times. Therefore, the
energy group breakdown presented in Reference Th was used which takes into
account 4.9 of the roughly 5.9 mev total available. This difference is con-
sidered to decay before the fuel leaves the core. Saturation of long lived
fission products is assumed which is conservative in this case, The pre-
dominant energy was found to be 3.2 mev for HPMR shield thicknesses.

‘The prompt fission gamma dose was calculated by an energy integration
under the continuous fission spectrum from .1 to 7.46 mev, A mean value
for the HPMR shield was found to be 2.85 mev by running a series of energies

assuming all proupt gammas at that energy.
~1h6-

The energy situation for the lead and water is firm at 7.0 and 2.23
mev, However the source geometry becomes an important factor, especially
in the case of water where the source distribution {thermal flux) varies very
rapidly and cannot be completely fitted with a simple sum of exponentials.
Both radiations together contribute 80% to that dose outside the secondary
shield which comes from gamme radiation leakage from the primary shield
tank, The geometry was handled by numerically integrating the dose con-
tributions from unit line sources into contributions from unit cylindrical
surfaces in the primary shield tank, These cylindrical surfaces of different
radii were then numerically integrated into the total dose contribution
from the lead and water volumes. This method essentially gives an exact
geometrical representation to within the accuracy of Simpson's rule for
numerical integration.

Three directions from the reactor vessel to the outside of the secondary
shield were considered. One horizontal shot out through the primary shield
tank and secondary shield to the aft face of the after reactor compartment
bulkhead, and a vertical computation through the north head, shield plug
and top hat were done in some detail. Another horizontal calculation for-
ward through the fuel oil shield tank was done for lead capture gammas in
detail with estimates for water capture and heat exchanger fission product

gammas, The results are tabulated in Table 9.1.

9.7 Secondary Shield
The activation of the sodium in the secondary salt required that a

secondary shield be placed around the steam generating equipment. The

overall dimension of this shield were established by the estimated volume
147-

requirements of the reactor and primary shield, the steam generators, and
the superheaters, A plan view of the arrangement of this equipment within
the secondary shield is shown in Figure 7.3. The resulting shield is box-
ghaped with internal dimensions of 23' x olyt x 15' high, (Figure 9.2).

The thicknesses of shielding required were then calculated for a maximum
dose of 15 milliroentgen per hour on the outer surface of the top and aft .
faces of the shield. It was assumed that fuel on water would be used to
aid in the attenuation of radiations from the forward and side faces of the
shield, as described earlier.

Except for directly over the reactor, the amount of secondary shielding
required was determined mainly by the secondary salt activity. The primary
shield is relatively highly effective in shielding reactor sources. The
total activity of 4300 curies introduced into the salt in the primary heat
exchanger was assumed to be distributed in the stean generating equipment
in proportion to the ratio of the volume of salt contained in any particular
component to the total salt in the system, The individual volumetric
source strengths were then obtained by dividing the curies of activity of

the salt in a component by the volume of that component. Thus

% of activity, _activity

salt lines 36.0 1550 6.33 x 107

primary H X 7.3 310 (not contributing)
-148-

This assumption was recommended by ORNL personnel working with similar
systems, and appears justified in view of the relatively long half-life of
sodium (15 hr) compared to the secondary salt cycle time (10 sec), It
was further agsumed that the U-tube geometries of the superheaters and
steam generator could be replaced by a straight cylindrical sources of
equivalent volume. The self-attenuation of these sources was determined
by homogenizing the salt and tube bundles within each cylinder, and by
computing mass attenuation coefficients for the sodium gamuwa ray decay
energies of 1.38 and 2.76 mev. The approximation ofireplacing the
cylindrical sources by equivalent line sources was used, and Peeble's
correction was applied to calculations involving slant penetration through
the shield.

Using these assumptions, the thickness of shielding required was
calculated for eight points in the secondary shield and estimated for three
more. It was attempted to select points which would give an indication
of the shielding required for the areas receiving both the largest and
the smallest irradiations. Time did not permit a move extensive study.

The "hottest" points on the inner surface of the secondary shield
were found to be (1) on the aft face of the shield near the primary heat
exchanger, (2) on the top face of the shield over the secondary salt pumps,
where salt lines are near the surface, and (3) directly over the reactor,
The most lightly irradiated point appeared to be in the middle of the front
face. Polyethylene was added to the aft face of the shield to attenuate
fast neutron leakage which could stream aft between the steam generators.
In estimating the lead thicknesses required, it was first assumed that

steel structure would be necessary to support the lead in the following

amounts: (1) 1 in. on front and aft faces, (2) 3/4 in. on side faces, and
(3) 1-1/2 in. on top face.

It appeared that the primary radiation reaching the forward face
would be from the superheaters. Therefore, it was believed advisable to
provide shadow shields for the superheaters directly rather than add lead
to the larger area of the front face.

A "top hat" of additional shielding is required directly above the
reactor, to enclose the control rod drive and the primary fuel pumps. This
shields against neutron and gamma streaming and leaking through pump well
and control rod penetrations of the primary shield tank plug.

The resulting shield is shown schematically in Figure 9-2. For
reasons of shortage of time and case of weight estimation, the shield is
represented by slabs rather than by contoured thicknesses. This assumption
is believed to be conservative, and hopefully counter valances the omission
of additional shielding for plumbing penetrations. The total estimated
weight of the secondary shielding, including the steel mentioned above, is

estimated to be 456,120 1b.

9,8 Summary and Recommendations

The controlling radiation in this reactor is fast neutron flux. High
fluxes in the core inelastic scattered in the nickel reflector and elastically
scattered in the BeO-Boron poison region are multiplied again in the
relatively thick heat exchanger region to become a determining radiation
source, Fuel oil, which is a good hydrogenous fast neutron attenuation,
was used to shield this source on the front and sides. Gammas born in the

core are pretty well stopped by the nickel reflector before they start, but
~151-

fission product gammas born in the heat exchanger from a fast cycling, high
power density fuel add up to a twenty percent dose contribution outside the
secondary shield depending on the length of time of operation. The high
fast neutron flux is also influential in its secondary effect of thermali-
zation and capture in the primary shield tank lead and water. The 1.45
percent borated water helps the water capture gamma dose by roughly factors
of ten to one hundred. Lead capture gamma dose is roughly 17 percent, and
water captures contribute about 56 percent of the total dose outside the
polyethylene in the auxiliary engine room.

Structural material activations were not considered for the shutdown
condition as they were assumed to be masked by the sodium activation.

The resultant weights tabulated in the weight section are 6.k 1bs/shp
for the primary shield and 14. k for a total of 20.8 1bs/shp.

In the primary shield tank the use of a two-inch thick cylindrical
ring of lead about 15 in. from the existing lead is recommended. This
would shield the lead and water capture gammas in the high thermal flux
region and offer a means of cutting down on the fuel oil required to shield
these secondary gammas.

If time had permitted another reactor compartment arrangement, space
should be made for putting the 30 in, of polyethylene around the after
side of the primary shield tank to eliminate the 18 in. on the after bulk-
head.

A quick look was taken at the shield weight for the case if no fuel
oil was used for shielding. Two reactor compartment arrangements were con-
sidered. One used additional lead and water shielding on the existing

reactor compartment bulkheads and the other used a larger primary shield
-152-

tank and no water or polyethylene on the bulkheads. Both systems were
designed to reduce radiation to the levels stated in Section 9.4 and gave
an additional shield weight of about 10 lbs/shp, This gives a total
shield weight for a two-reactor all nuclear ship of roughly 31 1b/shp.
However, no advantage was taken for rearrangements of machinery. Also
doge levels were reduced to same value on all sides of the reactor com-

partuent.

10.0 THE HEAT BALANCE AND GENERAL ASPECTS OF THE STEAM SYSTEM

10.1 Introduction

In this section is included the schematic diagram, Figure 10.1, of
the steam Plow and the heat balance, The diagram gives the steam flow,
the temperatures, and molten salt flow for a reactor power of 95.9 mega-
watts. This is the reactor power necessary to supply sufficient steam
for the full power of 35,000 shaft horsepower.

Most of the equipment shown on the diagrau has received comment

and description in other sections of this report, In this section some
brief additional comments will be made and a comparison of the efficiencies
of the oil fired steam generating system and the reactor driven steam

system will be undertaken.

10.2 The Steam Requirements

The heat balance for the steam system was taken from an actual test
of a class 931 destroyer. To drive the turbines at full power, 218,760
1b/nr of steam at 950°F and 1200 psig (h = 1470 BTU/1b) is needed. This
was the starting point for the heat balance. In the previous sections the
pumping powers for the reactor fuel, the molten salt coolant, and the
recirculating boiler water have been calculated. It was decided to drive
these pumps with turbines using superheated steam in order to have &
smaller unit within the secondary shield. A turbine-pump efficiency of
60% is assumed snd the pumping power was multiplied by a factor of 1.25.
The feed water pumping power is not changed since the feed water rate is

the same as in the oll fired system. The feed water pumps are also driven

achieved in the steam drums by cooling superheated steam in tubes that
pass through the saturated water in the drums. The steam is cooled from
950°F, 1200 psig to 625°F, 1165 psig, The desuperheated steam requirements
are summarized in Table 10.2.

10.3 Condensate and Exhaust Heat

The deaerating feed tank collects exhaust from some of the auxiliary
equipment and it also receives the condensate. From the DAFT is drawn
the feedwater which supplies the steam generating system. In order for
the deaeration to be complete, the pressure in the DAFT should not exceed
18 psig. The enthalpy of the saturated liquid at this pressure is 225 BTU/1b.
This 1s the enthalpy assumed for the feedwater entering the steam generating
system,

The DAFT is unable to handle the exhausts at full power steam flow so
it is necessary to run a portion of the exhaust directly to the condenser.
This excess exhaust is 12,530 1b/hr at full power. This is slightly higher
than the oil-fired systems 11,570 1b/hr; therefore, a small increase in
condenser capacity may be necessary to handle this additional flow.

A summary of the exhaust and condensate flows and their respective
enthalples as they enter the DAFT 1s given in Table 10.3.

10.4 Heat Addition in the Steam Generating System

- The steam generating system must add sufficient heat to bring 257,960
1b/br of water at an enthalpy of 225 BTU/1b up to steam at an enthalpy of
1470 BTU/1b plus 5,340 1b/hr of water at 225 BIU/Ib to steam at 1263 BTU/1b.
This total heat addition is 3.272 x 108 BTU/hr or 95,9 megawatts.

In the reactor system a feedwater heater is needed to do the job that
an economizer does in an oil fired system. Feedwater from the DAFT at 18
psig is raised to a pressure of T00 psig by conventional boiler feed pumps
and fed into the feedwater heater. Here, saturated steam at 1250 psia is
mixed with the feedwater to produce water at 486°F, It takes 91,730 ib/hr
of saturated steam to achieve this. The 486°F water is now pumped to a
pressure of 1500 psia and let down by throttling to the boiler pressure
of 1250 psi. The feedwater heater forms an integral part of the steam
generating system and with the saturated steam used for the heating forms
a closed loop within the system.

As has been stated in previous sections, the heat addition to the
steam generating system is by means of a molten salt, This salt drops
17.9% in temperature in the superheater and 58,8°F in the steam generator
at a flow rate of T.49 x 10° 1b/hr. These temperature drops and flow

rates represent an input of 3.272 x 108 BTU/hr.

10.5 Comparison of Efficiencies
No attempt to compare thermal cycle efficiencies will be made here
but only a simple calculation of the gross powerplant heat rate, For

the reactor system:

The reactor system does require more heat input because the additional

pumping power required for the molten salt and recirculating water is

greater than the power required for the fuel oil pumps and forced draft

blowers.

11.0 OVERALL POWER PLANT PARTICULARS

11.1 Introduction

In order to determine the overall feasibility of a fused salt reactor
installed in a particular class ship, it is necessary to consider all of
the components in ‘the complete system. A preliminary piping layout and
drawings of the steam generating equipment are included in Section 7.0.
Rough sketches of the primary and secondary shields are also presented in
the shielding section (9.0). To completely determine the suitability of
the resulting power plant, it is then necessary to investigate the
ingtallation as to its effect on the ship's overall construction, balance,
etc.

In addition, 1t is also necessary to consider operating problems such

ag control, emergency operation, and maintenance.

11.2 General Arrangement

A brief study of the possible layout of steam generating couwponents
within the reactor compartment and the location of the reactor compartment
in the ship was made with minimum shield weight as the major consideration,
No detailed optimization was attempted but rather judgement was used as to
the relative sizes and ‘location of the primary and secondary shield, Given
the decision of only replacing one oil fired plant with nuclear power,
arrangements were worked up using fuel oil as part of the shielding. As
pointed out in the shielding section, fast neutrons are the primary radiation
problem in this system, A hydrogenous liquid like fuel oll takes the place

of polyethylene and serves double duty as fuel for the oll fired plant.

 

 
-161-

Arrangement One

On first look, the best location for the reactor compartment seems
to be the aft fire room where accessibility for removal of reactor com-
ponents is done through the upper deck, However, preliminary estimates
of steam generating equipment sizes indicated a larger reactor compartment
than shown in the final design was required. To prevent propeller
shaft penetration of the aft reactor compartment, the compartment would
have had to move off centerline to such a degree that battle damage
stability problems would arise, Therefore, arrangement one (see Figure
11-1) was worked out with the reactor compartment in the forward fire
room, Provision for removal of the primary shield tank plug and reactor
vessel could be worked out through a side port, as there is twelve feet
of clear height between the top of the secondary shield and the main
deck, If removal through the main deck is dictated, the bridge super-
structure would have to be removed.

Tn locating the exact position of the reactor compartment, use of
existing bulkheads and deep web frames were made, The forward boundary
of the compartment is existing bulkhead 63 and the after boundary is
deep web frame 75. Tying into existing main structural members minimizes
additional support structure in the nuclear power conversion,

A weight and moment study was made on arrangement one. The weights
and moments of the boiler plant were replaced with the reactor system
including fuel oil shielding tanks. Fuel oil was distributed in the exist-
ing after fuel oil and ballast tanks to balance the forward moment pro-

duced by the increased weight of reactor compartment over the boiler com-
-162-

ponents. Results of this study showed that if Just the deep tanks aft of
the after engine room were used, a resultant trim of 1.94' by the stern
is produced as compared with a 1.63! trim by the stern for a completely
conventional oll fired destroyer. This gives a total of 391 tons of
fuel oll compared with 728.5/2 = 364.3 tons per one oil fired plant. As
fuel is burned out of three after tanks, the ship evens out, When the
stern rises to the point where propeller emergency or sea keeping ability
becomes a problem, sea water ballasting will be needed in these empty
after tanks.

Even though the fused salt system has a vertical center of gravity
4.5 feet below the boiler plant, the total nuclear powered ship C. G.
stays about the same due to emptying 173 tons from the relatively low
fuel oil and ballast tanks forward. Since the total ship weight and
free surfaces stay about the same, the free surface corrected metacentric
height (indication of ship stability) of about 3.2 feet stays about equal
to the conventional DDO3L., Moment calculations showed that the exact
change in metacentric height was sensitive to more exact values of weights
and centers of gravity than could be calculated for the miscellaneous items
in this feasibility study.
Arrangement Two

The finalized reactor compartment width was reduced to 23 feet. This
reduction allows the possibility of locating the nuclear plant in the after
engine room with only three to four feet of off centerline required to
avoid the forward propeller shaft. This is shown in arrangement two (see
Figure 11-1). With fuel oil shield tanks on both sides of the reactor com-

partment, the danger of serious list if damaged is lessened. A detailed

damage stabllity evaluation should be made before arrangement two can be
recommended with certainty, but aside from damage contingencies, the
arrangement offers the advantage of putting the heavy, concentrated weight
of the reactor compartment near the C. G of the ship, thereby requiring
less fuel oil, 303 tons, to balance the moments to give essential the con-
ventional full load condition trim aft. The transverse stability situation
is better than arrangement one in that the forward tanks have considerably
less free surface than the after tanks which are =mpty under HPMR, arrange-
ment two, full load conditions. The resultant free surface correction is
.16 as compared to 1.6L feet for arrangement one. These forward fuel oil
and ballast tanks have a lower center of gravity than the after tanks
used in arrangement one, but they hold less oil. Again as in arrangement
one, exact values of metacentric height cannot be calculated with any
confidence without a more detailed machinery arrangement, but it is indicated
that arrangewent two has better stability than arrangement one and has
strong possibility for good improvement over an oil fired DD931.

In summary, two general arrangements were worked on. Both give the
big advantage of decreased space required. A detailed arrangement of
the auxiliary room was not worked out, but a relatively large amount of
the original fire room ig left both aft of and above the reactor com-
partment, In arrangement one, fourteen longitudinal feet of deep tanks
are freed for armament stowage or other use. Also a portion of the room
left for auxiliary space could be used for stowage.

Stability looks to be roughly about the same as a conventional DD931
with increased oil ¢.¢.'s balancing a decrease in steam generating center

of gravity caused by elimination of uptakes and stacks and the design of
-165-

a compact, low reactor vessel, steam generator and superheater, and sur-
rounding shield. The free surface’'correction can be controlled to some
extent by keeping the fuel oil shield tanks full and under slight pressure.
As a feasibility project, the vertical moment study has indicated that a
detailed design with an eye to the stability problem, especially in an
arrangement of type two, could lead to an increase in wetacentric height
which could be gladly used by the armament people to add missile launching
and guldance systems topside.

Perhaps the greatest restriction in these arrangements is a lack of
flexibility in filling and emptying fuel oll and ballast tanks, Salt water
wust be used for trimming purposes which brings up contamination problems,
When fuel oil shield tanks are tapped, fuel oll or salt water must be pumped

into the bottom to maintain the shield and eliminate free surface.

11,3 Power Plant Control
11.3.1 Introduction
Due to its negative temperature coefficient of reactivity,

the fused salt circulating fuel reactor is self-regulating. That is, the
power produced in the core of the reactor follows the power demanded by the
load with some characteristic time lag, The steady state mean temperature
of the fuel in the core remains constant since, in the absence of control
rod motion, burn up, and fission product build up, the reactor is critical
only at one temperature. Of course, other temperatures throughout the
system will vary with load,

Even though the reactor is self-regulating, there are several reasons

why a control system way be incorporated in the power plant design, First
-166-

of all, the transient response of the system may be poor. For example,
load changes may result in large temperature overshoots which, in turn,
cauge intolerable thermal stresses. A properly designed control system
can improve transient response.

A control system may also be used to set up some desirable pattern of
steady state temperatures, pressures, and flow rates throughout the plant
as functions of power output, Such a pattern is called the plant program.
For the HPMR a constant steam temperature program is desirable. This
requirement is dictated by the fact that steam turbines for marine power
plants require essentially constant steam conditions regardless of load.

11.3.2 Types of Control Systems

Several types of control systems seem to be possibilities
for establishing the constant steam temperature program, For example,
control rod position in the core may be varied as a function of output steam
temperature, With a negative temperature coefficient of reactivity, con-
trol rod position determines the mean fuel temperature in the core and
thus fixed the level of temperatures throughout the system. Thus, it
seems possible that steam temperature could be maintained at a constant
level by such a system.

Another system which strongly suggests itself is controlled by varying
the flow rate of the inert salt in the intermediate heat transfer loop.

The rate at which heat is carried away from the primary heat exchanger
depends on the salt flow rate and the difference between inlet and outlet
salt temperatures. Thus, if flow rate is varied with power output, the
steam temperature can be maintained constant, This system has the distinct

advantage that the pumping power required decreases with decreasing load.
-167-

“+

There is a resulting gain in efficiency which is lacking in the other control
systems. There is one other factor which should be considered here. In
any system in which the flow rate is varled, the possibility exists for
transitions from turbulent to laminar flow and vice versa, Such transitions
usually result in large thermal shocks and are highly undesirable. In the
HPMR power plant salt flow in the primary heat exchanger and steam generator
is lewminar at design power and is well into the turbulent region in the
superheater. Thus, the flow rate can be varied over a wide enough range
to make control by this method feasible.
A third possible control system involves a by-pass line across the
salt side of the primary heat exchanger. As the load is decreased a valve
in the by-pass line is opened allowing a larger percentage of salt to
by-pass the primary heat exchanger. Thus, returning cold salt is mixed
with the hot salt from the heat exchanger with the result that salt tem-
peratures throughout the rest of the system can be adjusted to hold steam
temperature constant, A study to determine the optimum control system was not
attempted due to time limitations.
11.3.3 Simulation
I% was decided to set up an analog simulation study of the
reactor and power plant on the Reactor Controls Computer (Reference 30)
at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The study had two main objectives:

1. To determine the transient response and stability of the reactor
and power plant when subjected to changes in load, changes in
reactivity, and other perturbations.

2, To determine the ability of one particular type of control system

to maintain constant steam temperature,
-168-

For details of the simulation, circuits used, etc., see Appendix 1l.1.

A schematic diagram of the system which was simulated is shown in
Figure 11.2, Two best transfer circuits are shown; each handles 62.5
megawatts at full power. Due to the limited number of amplifiers avail-
able on the computer only circuit 1 was simulated in detail, In circuit
2 as shown in Figure 11.2, the superheater and steam generator were
approximated by a single heat exchanger. Circuit 1 represents the arrange-
ment of components as visualized when the study was set up. It is not
markedly different from the arrangement finally decided upon,

The control system chosen for simulation was the by-pass line across
the primary heat exchanger. This system vas chosen because it was relatively
easy to simulate and because it offered good possibilities for control.

Not enough equipment was available to simulate control by varying salt
flow rate. No control system was simulated in circuit 2.
11.3.4 Results
Since the details of the simulation are presented in the
appendix only the results will be indicated here.

In order to study the transient behavior of the reactor and power
plant a number of runs were made with the control system inoperative. The
result of the first such run is shown in Figure 11.3 With the reactor
operating in steady state at full power, the load demand was reduced linearly
to one-half power (62.5 megawatts) over a period of 15 seconds. As can
be seen from Figure 11.3, reactor power followed the load demand and
stabilized at half-power with no undershoot. The mean fuel temperature
in the core reached a peak of about 1236°F and then returned to its steady

state value of 1225°F also without oscillation.

 
-169-

The results of the above test seemed 40 indicate that the transient
response of the system was completely satisfactory. As further verification,
it was decided to subject the plant to a more severe load change. In
this test the load demand was increased instantaneously from 10% power
(12.5 megawatts) to full power, The results are shown in Figure 11.4.
Reactor power and temperatures throughout the system leveled out at steady
state values without oscillation, A number of other runs involving load
demand changes were made including cases involving 25% and 50% overload.

In all cases the reactor and power plant appeared to behave as a critically
damped system; that is, reactor power followed load demand without
oscillation and temperature swings throughout the system were very mild.

Several runs were made to investigate the effect of step changes
in reactivity. The results of one such test are shown in Figure 11.5 At
t= 0, a step change in reactivity of + 0.2% was introduced. At t=7T0
seconds, a step change of ~-0.2% was introduced.

All of the tests described above seemed to indicate that the transient
response of the reactor and power plant was satisfactory. Therefore, phase
two of the simulation was devoted to the study of the control system.

As stated previously the purpose of the control system is to establish a
constant steam temperature program. The system which was simulated is a
by-pass line across the salt side of the primary heat exchanger. The
amount of salt flow through this line ls determined by the steam temperature
by means of an elementary servo system of the on-off type. The salt flow
which could be by-passed through this line was limited, in one case, to

75% (1570 pounds/second) of the total flow and in another case to 90%
-170-

(1880 pounds/second) of the total flow. Figure 11.6 shows steady state
steam temperature as a function of load for these two cases as well as
the case where the control system is inoperative, Steam temperature is
held constant over the range of 60% power to 100% power for the 25% flow.
cutoff and over the range of 30% power to 100% power for the 10% flow
cutoff. The amount of salt which may be safely by-passed is probably
limited by the temperature difference across the salt in the primary heat
exchanger. At any given power level this temperature difference will
increase as the salt flow rate through the exchanger is decreased. No
study was attempted to determine the maximum tolerable temperature
difference,

Also of interest is the transient response of the power plant and,
in particular, the steam temperature during load changes. Figure 11.7
shows the results of a run in which power demand was decreased from full
power to half power in 15 seconds. The steam temperature stabilized at
its design point value (975°F1* after about 100 seconds. The maximum
excursion of the steam temperature was almost 100°F. It should be noted
that little attempt was made to optimize the control system. An optimum
system would undoubtedly improve this transient response. It is interest-
ing to note that reactor power undershoots its ‘steady state value after
the load change. This is in contrast to its behavior with the control
system inoperative. Temperatures throughout the system also oscillate

slightly.

* mis value was changed to 950°F in the final design.
-171-

11.3.5 Conclusions
The results of the simulation indicate that the kinetic
behavior of the reactor and power plant is completely satisfactory. These
results also demonstrate the feasibility of a control system to maintain
a constant steam temperature program. A more detailed study of all of
the possible control systems is required to determine which is optimum,
Because of the higher efficiency obtainable, control by varying salt flow

rate appears most attractive at this time.

11.4 Emergency Operation

It is extremely important that any reactor installation subject to
battle damage be as inherently safe as possible. The demonstrated stability
of reactor systems of this type (Ref. 6) along with the elimination of
numerous integral control rods makes it basically very desirable,

Tn addition, however, consideration has to be given to emergency
conditions, both major and minor, not only to establish an overall safe
system but to maintain operation if possible and to prevent damage to
the reactor.

A partial list of such considerations as applied to this system is
given below:

(1) Primary fuel pumps are over-designed so that high power operation
can be maintained in the event of partial failure.

(2) Primary and secondary pumps are driven by steam (available from
both the reactor and conventional system) and backed wp by an electric

motor which can be operated from emergency service,

(3) Fuel flow is in the direction of natural circulation which aids
the fuel inertia in removing the peak afterheat immediately after the
afterheat without over-temperaturing the critical areas,

(4) Provisions are made to dump the fuel from the reactor into dump
tanks If necessary.

(5) Blow out valves are incorporated into the system which would allow
drainage of the primary or secondary fluids into dump tanks should the
system go above design pressure due to over-temperature or leakage from
the high pressure steam side.

Inconel drain tanks will be located in the inner bottom of the vessel
directly below the reactor. There will be provision made for circulation
of secondary salt in Inconel pipes throughout the tank. Drain tank will
be maintained at 1200°F at all times after startup of reactor. Secondary
salt will be bled off from superheater loop, and will act as heater for
drain tank and as coolant to remove decay heat when hot fuel is introduced
from reactor. Under emergency conditions if secondary salt cooling becomes
impractical, water cooling will be made available. Thermal insulation will
separate the tanks from ship's bottom. Hot fuel may be returned to reactor
from drain tank by helium pressure.

Criticality calculations have not been made for this system to fix
size and dimensions; however, it is expected, from similar systems, that
any reactivity could be overcome by use of poisons. Li in the secondary

fluid will contribute to this result.

11.5 Maintenance

In considering the overall maintenance picture, because the power plant
-179-

is strictly conventional, only that pertaining to the reactor system will
be discussed. Servicing of the steam generating equipment for the basic
system presents a problem due to the residual activation of the secondary
salt, However, since dump tanks can be provided in the hull double bottom
and if careful design attention is given to assure almost complete drainage,
it is reasonable to expect that direct maintenance could be done after a
2-day cooling off period. The alternate system proposed using two inter-
mediate fluids not only offers a lighter system but would completely
eliminate this problem. Direct maintenance on the steam generating equip-
ment could be allowed at all times.

Two entirely different concepts exist for overall maintenance on the
basic reactor itself, Since it is beyond the scope of this report to
evaluate these, both methods are simply presented with the recommendation
that a careful evaluation be made in the future.

In either case it is felt that the reactor should be of sound design
and tested sufficiently to ensure that any installation would be of reason-
able duration. Then because of the additional complexity and cost of having
remote handling equipment designed to perform in the confined space aboard
ship, it is recommended that the reactor be removed as a whole assembly
and work performed at shore facility. This may be done by remotely cutting
the two inlet and exit pipes feeding salt to the steam generating equipment,
disconnecting the reactor from the supporting structure and then lifting
the assembly from the surrownding shielding.

At this point there are two alternatives pertaining to further wdintenance:

(1) Have the reactor designed so that a complete disassembly by remote’

operation is possible, This obviously requires a more complex reactor vessel,
-180-

internal structure, and heat exchanger arrangement. Also a means of remote
handling, seal weld cutting and welding, as well as remote testing and
inspection is required.

(2) Utilize a completely unit basic design that cannot be taken apart
and reassembled but has greater simplicity and hence more reliability,
Upon malfunction, the reactor would be taken from the ship and discarded
after the recovery of valuable material, i.e., BeO, There is strong reason to
believe that the cost of discarding the reactors that become faculty in
service would be more than offset by the elimination of the very complex

remote handling equipment, facilities, and personnel required from (1).

11.6 Removal and Disposal of Volatile Fission Products

There are two possible techniques by which removal and disposal of
volatile fission products can be achieved: 1) periodic removal and
disposal, and 2) continuous removal and disposal, Periodic operation is
recommended over ‘the continuous cycle.

As pressure builds up in the expansion chamber due to fission product
gas generation, a pressure relief valve permits excess gas to flow into
an originally evacuated disposal holding vessel. The vessel would be perhaps
copper tubing fabricated into a spiral form immersed in the fuel oil
biological shield at the fore side of the reactor space. Provisions for
storage of several such holding vessel would permit the holding of the
discharged off gas for sufficient time to cool radioactively, to levels
which would allow the vessel to be cast overboard without hazard to ship's
personnel,

If expansion chamber has a free volume of 1 £43 after operating teupera ture
-181-

is attained, gas may be allowed to accumulate for several days before dis-
charging to holding tanks. A helium purge would not be required under
these conditions, the heating rate (see Appendix 11.2) due to radicactive
decay in the expansion chamber, would be about 150 kw at equilibrium (where
production rate equals decay rate for nuclearly unstable gases, neglecting
neutron absorption loss rate) when reactor is operating at its rated

125 Mw of heat. At these rates of gas generation (approximately 0.2 moles/
day), pressure in the expansion chamber would rise from 20 to 50 psig in
about one week. At this time, excess gas would be bled off into the
evacuated holding chambers. Initial heating rate in the holding chamber,
assuming half the gas were removed approaches 75 kw. This would decay
rapidly and give a gamma source after 14 days of 5 x 104 curies of 0,083
mev, 600 curies of 0.1 to 0.3 mev and 30 curies of 2.4 mev, as well as a
beta heating of 380 watts.

As the alternate method, renctor way be continuously purged with
helium at a rate, say, 1000 liters (STP) per day. At this rate, heat
‘generated by gas in expansion chamber would be about 30 kw, Ref. 50. On
leaving the expansion chamber, off gas would enter a cooled holding chamber,
After a specified holding time, chamber is continuously exhausted into
ship's wake. An average holding time of & hr would permit decay of the
gas to about 0.2% of its initial activity in the holding chamber. During
periods when the ship lay at wet dock, off gas would be pressurized and
xenon and krypton retained on cooled activated charcoal beds, Beds would
be purged with helium after ship was underway.

Calculations have been made on the activity of ship's wake during
-182-

continuous discharge, assuming 4 hr and 48 hr holdup periods followed by
continuous exhaust of gas into ship's wake at a speed of 26 knots. Results
are as follows: A lL-hr holtime might result in a waximum dose rate of

8 mrem/hr in the ship's wake at time of exhaust, and a resultant 660 gamma
events per second per end of ocean water in a ribbon wake, 20 ft deep by
100 + wide. Instantaneous turbulent dispersion is assumed for the ribbon
wake, after which diffusion, wave action, and ocean currents would govern
dispersion of wake. It is expected that the wake would remain somewhat
intact in calm weather for several hours. A L8-hr noldtime would give a
maximum dose rate of 0.02 wrem/hr, and 27 gemma events sec end of ribbon
wake.

These levels of radioactivity are not believed to be objectionable
from a biological point of view, when additlonal attenuation of dose rate
by diffusion and decay are considered. Nevertheless, a radicactive trail
would be quite objectionable, These trails could be readily identified
several hours after the vessel had passed,

Atmospheric disposal has been congidered, but is not considered

feasible due to biological arrangement and shielding considerations.

11,7 Fuel Loading

Initial core loading presents a rather difficult task in that the
primary fluoride salt melts at a relatively high temperature. By some
means, the reactor must be maintained at a temperature in the order of
1000°F prior to the fuel loading. A stepwise method of loading is suggested

below.

 
~183-

(1) steam generating equipment, loop piping, and the reactor would
be isothermally brought up in temperature to approximately 650°F. Heat
may be supplied by steam from the conventional oil fired boilers, by
electrical heaters, or a combination of both, A maximum of 1000 KW of
electricity is available for this purpose from each of the engine rooms,

(2) The intermediate salt is then introduced into the system at
650°F and circulated throughout the secondary loops.

(3) The secondary system is brought up to approximately $00°F by
circulating superheated steam through both the steam generator and super-
heater. The reactor will likewise be brought up to this temperature by
circulating helium through the system and extracting heat from the primary
heat exchangers.

(4) By either overtemperaturing the conventional steam system to
provide superheated steam at 1100 F or by using electrical heaters in
the secondary loops the complete system is brought up to 1050°F,

(5) A stripped fuel mixture (no uranium) at 1050°F is then introduced
into the reactor and circulated by the fuel pumps using the auxiliary
electric drives.

(6) Fuel concentration is gradually increased by adding solid Na,UFg
until criticality is reached at 1050°F.

(7) Additional urenium is added to bring the reactor temperature up
to approximately 1100°F, Simultaneously the steam temperature feeding the
steam generators and superheaters is decreased to the normal 950°F. If
electrical heating was used entirely, this steam would be applied to reduce

the temperature of the steam equipment.

 
-18h-

(8) The superheated steam would then be gradually reduced to a saturated
value of 572°F by mixing with saturated steam, By the use of the blenders
and pumps the separate loops to the superheater and steam generator would
then be adjusted to near their normal operating temperature.

(9) Preheated feed water is now added to the steam generator and normal
operation of the system is established.

(10) Uranium concentrate is again added to the reactor until the design
operating temperature os 1225°F is reached.

(11) The system is now operational and a load may now be applied by
withdrawing steam from the generator and superheater.

The entire procedure must be accomplished at a low rate of heating

to veduce thermal shocks. It is estimated that it would take several days

to accomplish this.

11.8 Pumps, Valves and Blenders
11.8.1 Pumps
The choice of pumps for molten salt systems is limited to

gas sealed pumps. Flectro-magnetic pumps are not effective with fused salt.
Canned rotor pumps depend on lubrication by the pumped fluid and are not at
present sultable for operation at 1200°F in a fused salt medium. Gas sealed
centrifugal pumps have been operated at ORNL for durations up to 8000 hours
at 1200°F without bearing, seal, or other pump maintenance, The operation
of such pumps is now considered to be routine and trouble-free (Ref. 5).
These pumps may be so designed as to accelerate removal of xenon and krypton
gas fission products into the expansion chamber void.

Helium gas seals shaft mechanical seals and supplies pressure to the
-185-

expansion chamber so that inlet pump pressure is never below 15 psia. This
pressure is required so that cavitation of the impeller is prevented.

Provisions are made for complete replacement aboard ship for both the
primary and secondary pumps. However, reactor shutdowns and use of remote
handling equipment are required, The pump drive motors and assemblies
will be located above the secondary shield to allow direct maintenance and
replacement.

All surfaces of the pumps in contact with either the fuel or secondary
fluid will be made out of Inconel.
Fuel Pumps

Three pumps powered by steam turbines will circulate the fuel in the
core and primary loop, These pumps inlet and exit to commen plenum chambers
so that reactor operation under emergency conditions is possible with one
or two pumps. These pumps were designed to operate at 2/3 power under
normal conditions thereby allowing almost full power operation if one pump

is lost. Pump specifications are based on calculations by ORNL personnel

(49,50):

Inlet diameter 8.8"
Hut to tip ratio 1/4
Impeller outside diameter 13.76"
Discharge height 1"
Height of volute a"
Max, diameter of volute . 18"
Pumping head 60 ft.
R,P.M. 1150

Pump efficiency 85%
 

-186-

Pumping horsepower 50
Input horsepower per turbine 85
Discharge rate 3333 gallons per minute

Pump shaft will pierce shielding material and will be sealed by a
positive helium pressure. As xenon and krypton gas pressure builds up in
the reactor, a regulator valve insures that this positive differential
helium pressure is maintained to seal pump bushings and prevent radioactive
gas from leaking from the reactor. A 10 H.P, electric motor will be
clutched to the same shaft as the turbine to provide shutdown and emergency
circulation.

The direction of fuel circulation through the reactor is opposite
to that found in the ART (Ref, 36). However, because the maximum temperature
found in this system was significantly less than the ART, the design life
of the impeller is much more than adequate and the advantage of having
natural and forced circulation directions the same is realized.

. Secondary Loop Pumps

Two secondary loops are anticipated. Each loop will have two pumps
powered by steam turbines. One pump which will circulate hot salt through
primary heat exchanger and through superheaters will require 270 horsepower
input (160 pumping H.P.) and will have an idling 25 HP. motor on shaft
for shutdown circulation, The other pump will drive a fluid circuit at a
lower temperature and connect through blenders with the other citcuit, pro-
viding lower temperature fluid to the steam generator. This circuit will
require an input horsepower of 190 and pumping horsepower of 115, A 20 HP.

electric motor will ldle on same shaft for standby use.
 

-187-

These two pumps effectively operate in series so that in general
stability would not be as severe a problem as under-parallel operation.
However, because each pump contains an expansion tank, it is possible for
fluctuation in level between the two tanks to form a different sort of
stabllity problem, This can be eliminated by locating the two pumps in close
proximity so that either a short flow channel can connect ‘the expansion
chambers or a common chamber is used. An alternate approach would be to
utilize two pump impellers on a single shaft along with a single expansion
chamber. However, because of the large overhang, it may be necessary to
use a hydraulic bearing fed with pressurized fuel as an end support.

11.8.2 Valves

(1) Dump Valve will be ball and socket type, located in

lowest part of fuel chamber. Upon opening the dump valve, fuel will flow
by gravity, aided by 20 - 50 pounds pressure in the reactor pressure vessel,
into drain tanks, Stem would be Inconel, ball and seat being faced with
Kentanium, a modified titanium carbide nickel cermet, Tests have been made
with this type valve, against up to 100 psig helium pressure during and
after many hours at ‘temperatures up to 1400°F, with satisfactory results.
Tests have been made with the valve in Fuel 30 for 2285 hours, with 32
open-shut cycles at a temperature of 1225%, with a pressure differential
across the seat of 50 psi. Satisfactory results were obtained (See Ref." 36),

A drain valve of similar construction will also enable emptying of
secondary fluid system,

(2) Plow Regulating Valves in the superheater and steam generator loops

will be constructed of Inconel. It is believed that a gate valve or coaxial
-188-

cone valve will enable flow regulation without undue pressure drop. It
will be necessary that the valves be designed so as t6 permit satisfactory
clearance and operation at the design temperature. Since only flow regulation
is required, absolute shutoff is not necessary. Therefore, no difficulty
is anticipated in the design of satisfactory flow regulatory valves.
11.8.3 Blenders

The blenders or mixers used to interconnect the secondary
fluid loops would be of a single "Y" type construction with the two legs to
be mixed feeding into a single conduit. Because the temperatures of the
fluids to be mixed did not differ by more than a few hundred degrees,
it was felt that a plenum or mixing chamber would not be required. However,

thermal sleeves would have to be used on the legs to reduce thermal stresses.
-189-

12,0 MODIFIED APPROACH

A detailed weight per shaft horsepower list of the components of
this reactor system shows that an appreciable fraction of the total
weight appears as secondary shielding. (See Section 13). A cursory
examination was made of the use of an intermediate heat exchanger and
a tertiary fluid to boil water and superheat the steam. It is believed
that the welght of the secondary shielding can be reduced from L4.l
1bs/SHP to a specific weight of below 5 1bs/SHP, (This includes additional
pump weight, heat exchanger weight and the additional power required to
drive the intermediate circuit.)

The use of the tertiary fluid will eliminate the need for shielding
around the bulky superheater and steam generator and will greatly
facilitate their maintenance. The number of pumps handling radioactive
liquids will also be reduced. Using a machinery arrangement wuch like
that of the basic design and using the same temperatures, power, and
Plows everywhere in the system except the salt inlet temperature and hence
the log mean temperature in the superheater, the calculations described
below indicate the welght of the secondary shield can be cut considerably.
However, since the basic design used the secondary shield to complement
the primary shielding (note bulkhead shield, Figure 9.2), the weight of
the primary shield will increase. Estimated increase is from 6.4 lbs /SHP
to 13 1bs/SHP. Because of the reduced mean temperature difference in the
superheater, its weight will also increase; however, this represents only

a small percentage of the total weight.
~190-

The complete bank of intermediate heat exchangers is placed directly
forward of the primary reactor shield, It would rest against the fuel oil
tanks which would be used as part of the secondary shield for one side of
the heat exchangers, The top of the heat exchangers is covered with 1"
steel and 6" lead. The port and starboard sides are shielded with 1" steel
and 7" lead. In addition, 1" steel and 3" lead are used against the
primary shield and the fuel oil tanks.

The following conditions were used for the weight analysis,

Heat exchanger U tube, counterflow
Tube Size: outside diameter 0.25"

inside diameter 0.17"
Tube length ) 16.7!
Number of tube 3600
Number of tube bundles : 12
Dimensions of shells 6" x 15" x 100"
Temperature difference, tube side 100°F
Tempera ture difference, shell side 100°F
Temperature difference, log mean 100°F
Inlet temperature, tube side 1150°F

All structural materials are Inconel.

As indicated above, the heat exchangers were calculated using what
appeared to be realistic conditions. A further study with optimization of
the fluid horsepower required for the intermediate heat exchanger versus
the weight of the entire unit should result in additional improvements.

The heat transfer calculational methods are identical with those shown

in Appendixes 6.1 and 7.1. Weight results are shown in Section 13.

13.0 SPECIFIC WEIGHTS

Below are tabulated the specific weight breakdowns for the conventional
oil-fired system and the three reactor powered systems considered in this
report. The categorization is that used by the Naval Reactors Branch.

Each category includes the following items:

A+B Steam Propulsion Machinery
C+D . Reactor Plant Machinery
E Radiation Shielding
F Electric Plant (In Machinery Space)
G Electric Plant (Out of Machinery Space)
H+ J Independent Systems
L Load and Stores

The system referred to as "Basic Design" is that in which an attempt
vas made to utilize only presently available technology. Also the steam
generating equipment is contained within the secondary shield. For the
"Modified" design an intermediate heat exchanger loop was incorporated to
permit removing the steam generation equipment from within the secondary
shield, In the "Potential" design study, materials and concepts of a more
advanced, but still technically feasible, nature were utilized. Also, for
this design, the ship was presumed to be entirely nuclear powered.

The basic and modified designs are based on a reactor and steam generation
system overdesign of 30%, while the potential design is based on an overdesign
of only 10%, Since time limitations did not pernlt a reiteration for a
more realistic overdesign modified systems of 10%, an estimation of the

power plant specific weights for an overdesign of 10%. were made as follows.

-193-

The design of the reactor and steam generation equipment was assumed to
remain the same, but the capacity of the remaining equipment was increased
sufficiently to give the appropriate overdesign value, The results of this work
gives a specific weight of 58.1 and 54.2 1b/shp for the basic and modified
reactor systems, respectively. As will be mentioned later in this section,
a fair comparison of the three systems requires that the shielding weight
of the basic and modified designs be increased to make up for the shielding
done by the fuel oil. (See Section 9).

The tabulated specific weights for the conventional, oil-fired system
were taken from a detailed ship weight breakdown compiled by the Bureau
of Ships for a DD931 destroyer. For the three reactor powered systems,
the equipment weights not affected by the reactor installation were also
taken from this table.

For the three reactor systems, the specific weight of the steam
propulsion machinery (Category A + B) is several 1b/shp less than for
the conventional system. This is true primarily because approximately
balf the liquids in the reactor systems are accounted for under reactor
plant machinery (Category C+D), whereas for the conventional system all
liquids are accounted for under Category A+B. Another factor which con-
tributes to thls lower value is the removal of forced draft fans and fuel
oil pumps. Finally, a portion of the insulation, which for the conventional
system is totally accounted for under Category A + B, has been included,
for the reactor systems, under Category C+D. For the conventional system,
all components which would be removed to make way for the reactor plant
machinery were included in Category C+D, For the reactor powered designs,

the weight of the steam generation equipment was increased quite substantially
~19h-

(25% of calculated weight) to account for the supporting structure and
other portions of this equipment for which no detailed weight calculations
were made, From examination of other reactor powered steam systems, it
was decided the two pounds per shaft horse power would be ample to cover
the weight of the control system and miscellaneous items, The specific
weight of the modified system's reactor plant is somewhat greater than the
basic due to the additional. coolant loop and associated heat exchanger.

A slightly smaller specific weight over that of the modified system is
realized for the potential design since the application of more optimistic
concepts permits using a smaller reactor and intermediate heat exchanger
(Section 14,0).

The specific weight of the electric plant for the reactor powered
systems was increased slightly over the conventional system weight. This
increase was adjudged sufficient to provide for the electrical components
of the reactor control system.

A substantial increase in specific weight is indicated for independent
systems (Category H+J). From a cursory examination, it is apparent that
the machinery required to replace a reactor fuel pump while at sea will
weigh about two pounds per shaft horsepower, The weight of the offgas
system, fuel adding mechanism, and wiscellaneous items, was estimated at
two pounds per shaft horsepower, also.

For Arrangement No. 1 of the reactor compartment for the basic and
modified reactor powered systems 1.7 1b/shp of fuel oil is carried in excess
of one-half the fuel originally on board the conventionally powered ship.

This fuel is necessary for trim of the vessel and also serves as shielding.
-195-

For the potential design, the ship is to be powered entirely by reactors
and therefore no fuel oil is carried.

Arrangement No. 2 of the reactor compartment would provide a trimmed
ship with the removal of enough fuel to provide a specific weight savings
of four pounds per shaft horsepower less than half the original amount of
fuel, Arrangement No. 2 is the one recommended in this report. There
is some question as to the advisability of providing the oil-fired portion
of the power plant with less than its normal complement of fuel. For
this reason, the tabulated specific weights do not show a reduction for
fuel oil savings.

If the potential system were installed in conjunction with an oil-
fired boiler, the fuel oil inventory could be utilized as shielding, giving
a more favorable overall weight for this design.

If either the "basic" or "modified" design nuclear systems were used
for total ship power, instead of only half, an additional ten pounds per
shaft horsepower of shielding will be required. This is due to the fact
that the fuel oil carried for the oil-fired boiler is placed in such a
way as to be equivalent to approximately ten pounds per shaft horsepower
of shield. The overall power plant specific weights for an entirely nuclear
powered ship with a reactor and steam generation system overdesign of 10%
then becomes:

Basic Design Modified Design Potential Design

68.1 1b/shp 64.2 1b/shp 54.4 1b/shp.

14,0 FUTURE POTENTIAL

The design philosophy taken on the basic reactor system is to use,
as much as possible, materials and technology which have been proven
feasible. It seemed desirable to illustrate the potential of the system
by adopting materials and conditions which were more optimistic, but yet
feasible, as indicated by experiments and qualified opinions, Thus, a
cursory examination of a more advanced design was made %o determine minimum
realistic specific weight (weight/shaft horsepower) that may be achieved.
Also, since time had not allowed the optimization of many parameters in
the basic design, an attempt was made to. select parameters which would

improve the performance of the sygten.

14.1 Reactor Core

In order to help reduce the total weight of the system, it is
desirable to minimize the reactor core diameter. Four steps are taken
to achieve this. (1) Zirconium hydride was used as the moderator replacing
beryllium oxide thus increasing the moderation properties of the core,
(2) A beryllium, sodium, wranium fluoride salt was selected to replace
the zirconium, sodium, uranium salt to improve neutron moderation, (3)
Because of improved materials a higher pover density could be used. (U4)
Use of a nickel-molybdenum cladding such as INOR-8 (Ref. 5) decreased the
poison in the core because nickel-molybdenum's corrosion resistance permits
a thinner cladding.

The geometrical appearance remains identical to that of the basic design;

however, all dimensions are reduced. Preliminary calculations indicate that

 
-197-

criticality. will occur at a uranium concentration which is approximately
that of salt mixture number 92 tested at ORNL (Reference 40). The control
rod is identical with that described in the basic design both in size

and materials. Conditions imposed on the. system are:

Power 100 Mw

Power density (averaged over core) 1 Kw/cud

Fuel (Approximate) 38% NaF, 424 BeF,, 20% UF,
(% by weight)

Moderator rod diameter, inches 0.5

Moderator rod cladding thickness, inches 0.010 Mo

0.020 INOR-8

Volume fraction of fuel 0.5

Core diameter, cm Lo

Nickel reflector outer diameter, cm 80

Core height, cm 78

Average fuel inlet temperature, Op 1100

Average fuel outlet temperature, Op 1300

One hundred megawatts was selected as the power necessary (with 10%
overdesign) to drive one engine room of a 931 class destroyer, The power
density is felt to be safe as a result of an ORNL study (Reference 36) and
preliminary moderator rod stress calculations. The core temperature seems
to be modest from a corrosion standpoint, The use of INOR-8 will decrease
corrosion; however, its fabrication is more difficult than that of Inconel,
The zirconium hydride moderator rods coupled with the improved moderation
properties of the beryllium fuel allow the size of the reactor to be reduced

considerably. However, zirconium hydride goes through a phase change near
-198-

1100°F and thus cladding stress may be a difficult problem. Hydrogen
escape from the moderator is resisted by the use of a molybdenum cladding
next to the zirconium hydride which in turn is clad with INOR-8 for

corrosion resistance.

14.2 Primary Heat Exchanger

Because of the relatively poor heat transfer properties of the
secondary coolant used in the basic design, it was felt that, although
initially a decision was made not to use sodium (See Section 2.3), 1%
should be investigated. The primary heat exchanger is placed just outside
the poisoned shield rods just as in the basic design. It is a U-tube
design with the tube entering and leaving toroidal headers placed around
the top of the reactor. A baffle sheet is placed in the fold of the tubes
to effect counterflow at all points.

The following is a list of the design conditions which were considered:

Tube diameter, outside 0.55 inches
' Tube diameter, insider 0.50 inches

Number of tubes 2040

Tube length 7.5 feet

Fuel inlet temperature 1300°F

Fuel outlet temperature 1100°F

Na inlet temperature 930°F

Na outlet temperature 1130°F

Structural Material INOR-8

Although sodium is a very good heat transfer agent, the heat exchanger

considered in this study required as large & radial dimension as did the
~199-

straight through heat exchanger in the basic design because additional space
is required for a U-tube configuration. It was felt that it is desirable to
use U-tube design to avoid thermal stress and thus effect longer life,
Thermal stress becomes a more important problem when using sodium than the
fused salt as in the basic design because, contrary to the case of the fused
salt, a larger portion of the temperature drop occurs in the tube wall.
Helically wound tubes are a definite possibility for smaller heat exchanger
volumes; however, thermal cycling causes a tricky configuration design pro-
blem especially when it is desirable fo obtain a relatively long life,

The U-tube sodium heat exchanger required many less tubes and thus is
less expensive and easier to fabricate than the straight through salt heat

exchanger considered in the basic design.

14,3 Intermediate Heat Exchanger

Because the core is a high flux, high leakage machine, there is con~
siderable neutron activation of the sodium, This activation causes a
secondary shielding problem which can best be minimized by the use of
intermediate heat exchanger (See Section 12,0). For the advanced design,
the intermediate heat exchanger is a counterflow U-tube sodium heat exchanger,
The shielding required 10 in. of lead and 1 in. of iron on the top, port,
starboard, and forward sides. The primary shield was used on the aft face.

Heat exchanger parameters are

Na outlet temperature (tube side) 930°F
Na inlet temperature (tube side) 1130°F
Na outlet temperature (shell side). 1030°F

Na inlet temperature (shell side) 830°F
ET

-200-

Tube outside diameter 0.425 in.

Tube inside diameter 0.375 in. .
Number of tube bundles 25

Number of tubes per bundle 80

Dimension of shell {1 tube bundle) 11.9" x 5" x 50"

14,4 Boiler and Superheater

Because the boiler and superheater are relatively small percentage
of the total machinery weight, no attempt was made to design this equipment.
Sodium has been used in the Seawolf (SIR) reactor system for steam generation
and will be used in the sodium graphite reactor (8GR) developed by Combustion
Engineering and Atomics International. The thermal stress and chloride stress ,
corrosion on the water side creates an engineering problem. However, it is
felt that the use of Inconel as a structural material and blenders to reduce
temperature differences nay be a partial solution. For the weight of the
steam and water equipment, the same weights as were determined in the
basic design were listed. Because an intermediate fluid will probably
be used between the water and the sodium, the disadvantage of the third
fluid will tend to counterbalance a reduction in weight caused by the

superior heat transfer properties of godivm.

14.5 Primary Shield

The primary shield which was considered consisted of the following.
One inch of structural steel plus six inches of lead were used just outside
of the insulation packed around the pressure shell. Next followed 15.7
inches of water and then one inch of steel and 6 inches of lead. Following

this lead is TO inches of water which is contained by a 1/2" steel vessel.

 
-201-

Primary shield weight is approximately 375,000 lbs. Dose rates at the
reactor shield face were approximately 10 wr/hr and 10 fast peutrons fon”
sec. The most important gamma contributors were the water and lead capture

gammas and the fission product gammas released in the primary heat exchangers.

14.6 Calculational Methods and Results
Calculational methods used in the advanced design are identical to
those illustrated in Appendices 6.1, 7.1 and 8.2. The specific weight

results are given in Section 13.0.

APPENDIX 6.1

JUSTIFICATION OF MODERATOR MATERIAL

Allowable Moderator Rod Size

The best way to justify a material selection is by its satisfactory
performance under actual operating conditions. Beryllium-oxide has
suitably withstood a preliminary evaluation in the MIR under both high
temperature radiation and cyclic operation (Reference 54 and 55). While
the specimen size and test conditions were not identical to that proposed
for this study it is a reasonable first approach to calculate the critical
stresses that were withstood in this test and then apply these to the
current case.

The limiting stress in the case of internal heat generation, especially
for a ceramic, is its tensile.

The specimens from the MIR test were 1 in. in diameter and were
satisfactorily exposed to a power generation of approximately 15 watts om
at a temperature of 1500°F, Utilizing the development given in Ref. 10,
Equation LVIII, on the working curves of Ref. 3, the maximum tensile stress
is found to be 3000 psi. This will now be used as the design basis for
the selection of a maximum allowable moderator size for this study.

The energy release rate is approximately 197 wev/fission which may
be broken up roughly as follows:

Local deposition =~ 165 mev/fission - Fission product kinetic energy

5 mev/fission - Fission product decay beta particles
-208-

Non-local - 6 mev/fission ~ Fission product decay gaummas
5 mev/fission - Prompt fission gammas
5 wev/fission - Prompt fission neutrons

11 mev/fission Neutrinos (deposited at oo)

To determine the energy deposition rate in the moderator, it is felt
quite conservative to assume that all of the neutron energy is absorbed in
the moderator,

On the basis of this it was felt Justifiasble ito increase the moderator
rod size to 0.75 inches diameter although additional testing would be
required to obtain definite verification,

Moderator Rod Temperature Distribution

By making the reasonably valid assumptions of steady state, negligible
axial heat £10, and non-variance of the materials thermal properties with
temperature, the temperature distribution through a clad cylinder due to

internal heat generation can be found from the basic equation:

Fon wh = deg)

By applying the proper interface and boundary conditions this reduces to:

In the cladding - 1, = r =r,

a." r.? , 2 rp?
t,(x) try) + hE, 1- (Z) + (gp! _ a’)

Cc

r

Lr

 
~209-

On the moderator - 0 &r < rn,

a," r 2 ;
ty(x) = bry) + ——— 1 - |

nm

where: the subscripts c and m refer to the cladding and moderator respectively

t(r) = temperature at point r

g''* = heat generation rate per unit volume
k = thermal conductivity

ry, = outer radius of the moderator

r. = outer radius of the cladding

Applying these results to the case of a 0.75 in diameter cylindrical
rod of BeO with 40 mil Inconel cladding (k = 14.5 and 16 BTU/hr-£t-OF at
approximately 1500°F) the temperature distribution given on Figure A6.1
was obtained, It should be noted that a temperature drop across the interface
of the moderator and cladding is not included at this point.and that the other
non-local energies were lost from the system. The possible gamma energy
absorption was not included because the relatively light weight BeO gives
poor gamme attenuation making this effect within the conservation of the
previous statement,

Maximum energy deposition in the moderator is then 2.9% (3 555 ) of
that in the fuel, Considering the power distribution found across the core
of 1.4 (Section 8.2.2) and a probable axial distribution. of the same order
gives an overall peak to average power of approximately 2.0, The maximum

heat generation in the moderator rods can then be calculated by:
~210-

Power density in the fuel = 700 watts ond
Fraction fuel volume = 50
Fraction moderator volume = ,40

Generation rate in BeO = 2.9% x 2.0 x T00 x 2 = 50 watts om

The critical location for the moderator material is approximately at the
central region where the power density is a maximum. Although the tem-
perature of the fuel increases toward the exit of the core, the power
density decreases at a rate sufficient to cause a net reduction in the
moderator tempera ture, It is estimated later in this appendix that the
maximum surface temperature (location of maximum tensile stress) of the
moderator is 1410°F. Comparing. this with the MIR test information at 1500°F
and the basic strength characteristics of BeO with temperature (Ref. 9),
it is apparent that no correction in the allowable stress should be made.

Utilizing the allowable stress of 3000 psi and a maximum uniform heat
generation rate of 50 vatts/cm, the limiting cylindrical rod diameter based
on test data is calculated to be 0,6 inches (Reference 3).

However, the following considerations should be made before the rod
size is limited to this value:
1. The above calculations were felt to be conservative,

2. Actual tenslle strengths for BeO of 9000 psi were measured (Ref. 9)

3. MIR tests which ran the tensile strengths to 3000 psi gave

satisfactory performance,

Applying these results to the care of a 0.75 in. diameter cylindrical
rod of BeO with 40 mil Inconel cladding (k = 14.5 and 16 BTU/hr-ft-°F
at approximately 1500°F) the temperature distribution given on figure A6.1

was obtained. It should be noted that a temperature drop across the inter-
-211-

face of the moderator and cladding is not included at this point.

Pemperature Rise Across Fuel Boundary Layer

The temperature rise across the boundary layer between the fuel and
the moderator rods was calculated by means of Ref. 1 and 2. It is shown that
the overall temperature rise ls separable into the sum of two temperature
differences (1) Due to the temperature drop required to remove the heat
generated within the moderator material and (2) Due to the temperature rise
through the boundary layer due to decreased velocity and thus higher power
density.

The following constants were found for the reactor core operating at

125 MW with a temperature rise of 100°F and a mean temperature of 1200°F.

Flow Area =2.38 ot
Hydraulic Diameter ~ 0546 £%

Using Reference 1, with an equivalent cylinder gives a Nussault number
of 100 for the (1) solution. (Use of the hydraulic diameter analogy with
this method is indicated in Ref, 66).

then:

Temperature Rise Across Cladding - Moderator Interface
Because this interface gap is quite small compared to the rod diameter
even at operating temperatures (Sec. 6.2.1) it may be treated quite accurately

by an approximation to a flat plate as:

Because a shrink fit of the cladding around the BeO appears to be

Similarly the temperature rise to the centerline of the rod (neglecting
the interface) is found to be:

AT/g" = 1.96

AT = 98°F

Combining the temperature rise across the boundary layer, cladding and
interface with an assumed maximum fuel temperature at the center plane of
1300°F (avg. temp. = 1225%F) provides a maximum temperature at the BeO
surface of 1412°F.

Similarly the maximus temperature at the moderator centerline is found

to be 1493°F.

The primary heat exchanger is designed to transfer 125 megawatts

or 4.27 x 108

quantities which would ordinarily be considered design parameters were, due to
the short time allowed for this study, given what seem to be reasonable
values and held invariant throuhgout the calculations.

The following calculations represent the final iteration of the

most promising combination of tube diameter and spacing as indicated

Perturbation Technique

The perturbation technique developed below is a very simplified
approach in obtaining reactivity changes incurred through small
perturbations in cross sections, away from the critical parameters.

Upon making diffusion theory approximation to the current J
and assuming a solution for a bare one region three group system of
the form (v2 + 1) = 0, one obtains the following steady state

equations.

(02,7 Zot Zadh (Zab Teaba + Zpghy) = 0
(08,7 Zap +p) = 2b = 0

Therefore one gram burnup of U-235 requires on the average 1.856 x 10

Tissions, and one full power hour of reactor operation at 125 MW is
-2hh-

equivalent to 7.515 grams U-235 destroyed. Inventory of U-235 within
the reactor at any time T is expressed as

M(T) = Mo) - 0.007515 ©

M is kgms T in full power hours. Also the concentration of U-235 per

em3 of fuel can be expressed relative to initial concentration as

All cross section involving the fuel sre written as functions of Q

for example:

S37 {0.0065 + 04536 | .

Fission Product Poisons

The additional absorption resulting from non volatile fission
products are approximated by the following assumptions.

1 fission = 100 barns equivalence of thermal poisons

1 fission = 10 barns equivalence of intermediate poisons,
Then the added wacroscoplic absorption cross section for the core

region are given as:

DESCRIPTION OF SIMULATION PROGRAM

The flow sheet of the system which was simulated is shown in
Figure 11.2, Figures A-1l.1 through A-11.5 show the electrical
circuits or roadmaps which were used to represent the fuel loop and
heat transfer circuit 1. The roadmaps for heat transfer circuit
2 are similar to but simpler then those for circuit 1; they are
now shown. The method for simulating reactor kinetics is well
known and is not repeated here, See References 30 and 31.

Figures A-11.1 shows the roadmap for the fuel loop. Amplifiers
1 and 2 represent passage of the fuel through the core. Sp is the
mean fuel temperature in the core. Amplifiers 3 and 4 represent passage
of the fuel through one primary heat exchanger. Sey is the mean
fuel temperature in the heat exchanger. Amplifiers 5 and 6 simulate
passage of fuel through the other primary heat exchanger.

Figure A-11.2 shows the roadmap for the salt side of the primary
heat exchanger and the superheater. Amplifiers 9 and 10 represent
passage of the salt through the primary heat exchanger. Terminals
marked C. S. go 0 the control system circuits which are shown in
Figure A-11.5. These will be described later, Amplifier 11 generates
the salt temperature resulting when the by-passed salt mixes with the
salt from the primary heat exchanger. The box labeled Tq represents
a time-lag device which simulates the transport delay in piping.

Amplifiers 12 and 13 simulate salt passage through the superheater.

 
-247-

Amplifier’ 14 again generates a mixed-salt temperature (See Figure 11,2),
Amplifiers 7 and 8 generate the coupling voltages between fuel and salt
in the primary heat exchanger, The power transferred across the exchanger,
Py is determined by the mean fuel and salt temperatures in the exchanger.
The time constant of amplifier 7 represents, to some approximation, the
heat capacity of the tube metal in the exchanger.

Figure A-11.3 shows the roadmap for the salt side of the steam
generator. Amplifier 16 generates the mixed salt temperature going into
the steam generator. Amplifiers 17 and 18 simulate passage of the salt
through the steam generator.

Figure A-11.% shows the method used for generating the power demand
voltages. LS and Pe are the power demands from the superheater and
steam generator respectively, The ganged potentiometers may be set to
any desired power demand. Amplifier 24 generates the output steam tem-
perature. The assumption is made that steam temperature is proportional
to the superheater inlet salt temperature and to the power extracted from
the superheater. Herve an effect rather than a physical phenomenon is
being simulated.

Figure A-11.5 shows the manner in which the control systen was
simulated, A Brown recorder was used to display the output steam tem-
perature One Limit switches were placed on this recorder in such a
manner that when steam temperature varied from its design value by a certain
threshold setting a voltage of proper polarity was applied to amplifier
25 through a gain setting potentiometer. Amplifier 25 integrated this

error voltage to give gs the flow rate through the by-pass line, ss

is limited by the diodes in the feedback circuits around amplifier 25
to lie in the range of zero to 75 volts (zero to 1570 pounds/second flow

rate). The voltage representing v, drives a multiplier and the

5
appropriate output connections are shown in Figures A-11.5 and A-11.2.
Ws» the flow rate through the heat exchanger is generated by amplifier
26 as the difference between Woy (a constant represented by 100 volts)

and Wy Wo), drives another multiplier as shown in Figure A-1l.5.

APPENDIX 11.2

Expansion Chamber Heating Calculations

 

If fuel volume is taken to be 45 cubic feet, and fuel is pumped
into reactor at 1100°F, as in the ARE, and ralsed to 1225°F average
operating temperature,

Density of fuel = 253.0 - ,0328T(°F) 1b/ft3

Density at 1100°F = 216.9

H

Density at 1225°F = 212.8

Expansion of fuel = 32 £13 x 4.1 1v/et3= 184.5 1b

184.5 1b = 212.8 1b/rt3 = .867 £5, volume of fuel in expansion
chamber at operating temperature.

Assuming that all fission product gases are held in the expansion
chamber for 3 - 10 days, or until rate of generation just equals rate of
decay of all unstable gaseous fission products, ignoring loss due to
neutron absorption, at 125 MW power, heating rate in expansion chamber
due to gas decay is about 150 kilowatts.

Decayed heat generation rate is about T-1/2% fission heat release.

Instantaneous gammas and capture gammas constitute about 6% more. As a
part of the delayed heating is in the gaseous phase, and an exact cal-
culation of gamma heating in liquid phase of expansion chamber is not
within the scope of this project, an estimate of the liquid phase heating
due to beta and gamma energy absorption in the expansion chamber is
taken to be 5% of the total fission heat, divided by the total volume
in the expansion chamber, Thus,
125 x 100 watts x .867 £t5 x .05 = 120 kW
bs £3

In the absence of flux data for the expangion chamber, a figure
of 130 KW is assumed for fission heating in the chamber. The ball park
estimate is founded on information obtained from Mr. lackey of ORNL,
and is derived from an estimate for the ART,

Therefore, estimated heat rate in expansion chamber is 150 + 120 +
130 = 400 KW,

Assuming that fuel is bought into chamber at 1250°F and experiences
a 100°F temperature rise before being expelled,

400 KW x 3415 BTU/hr kw = 1,366,000 BTU/hr.

1,366,000 BTU/hr <= (.27 BIU/1b °F x 100°F) = 50,600 lb/hr, fuel flow
required to remove heat,

If a temperature rise of 75% is experienced, 67,500 1b/hr will be
required.

Assuming that inlet temperature is 1175°F, expansion tank exit tem-
perature would be 1275°F and average ‘temperature 1225°F with 100°F rise.

Use of a helium purge for the system would result in reduction of

jon, chamber by no more than 30%.
