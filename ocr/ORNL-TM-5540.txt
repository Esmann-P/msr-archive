PREFACE

This report presents the System Design Description of molten-salt
corrosion loops MSR-FCL-3 and MSR~-FCL-4, which are high-temperature test
facilities designed to evaluate corrosion and mass transfer of modified
Hastelloy N alloys for use in molten-salt breeder reactors. These loops
were in the advanced stages of assembly when construction was halted due
to termination of the Molten-Salt Breeder Reactor Program. The MSR-FCL-3
is essentially complete except for installation of piping system compo-
nents, and the MSR-FCL-4 is about 607% complete.

The design features are documented here for the benefit of those
who may want to use the facilities for similar experimentation. The

facilities are available for use on other programs as appropriate.

ABSTRACT

Molten-salt corrosion loops MSR~FCL-3 and MSR-FCL-4 are
high-temperature test facilities designed to evaluate corrosion
and mass transfer of modified Hastelloy N alloys for future use
in Molten-Salt Breeder Reactors. Salt is circulated by a cen-

trifugal sump pump to evaluate material compatibility with LiF-
| BeF,-ThF,~UF, fuel salt at velocities up to 6 m/s (20 fps) and
at salt temperatures from 566 to 705°C (1050 to 1300°F).

 

This report presents the design description of the various
components and systems that make up each corrosion facility,
such as the salt pump, corrosion specimens, salt piping, main
heaters, salt coolers, salt sampling equipment, and helium cover-
gas system, etc, The electrical systems and instrumentation and
controls are described, and operational procedures, system limi-
tations, and maintenance philosophy are discussed.

Key words: molten salt, test facility, MSBR, corrosion,
mass transfer, systems design description, forced convection,
LiF~-BeF,~-ThF,-UF,, fuel salt, high temperature, centrifugal

pump.

1. INTRODUCTION

Molten-salt corrosion loops MSR-FCL-3 and -4 were planned as part of
the effort to develop a suitable metal alloy for the piping and components
of future Molten-Salt Breeder Reactors (MSBRs). The corrosion loop design
was based on the design of similar experiments that have been conducted at
Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) , 173

Construction of the loops was not completed due to termination of the

~ MSBR program at ORNL; however, the two identical loops were in advanced
| states of assembly when work was halted, with FCL-3 about 90% complete and
FCL-4 about 60% complete. a
This design report has been prepared to document design features in

\O/ case the facilities are reactivated for some similar use and also to

 

 
 

 

provide design information for anyone initiating future forced-convection
corrosion studies with molten salts. Since corrosion loops FCL-3 and -4
were identical, much of the descriptive material included in this report

refers to only one loop, FCL-3, to avoid needless repetition.

2, FUNCTIONS AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

 

2.1 Functional Requirements

Corrosion loops FCL-3 and -4 were designed as part of the program to
develop a structural containment material for the primary circuit of MSBRs.
The primary salt circuit of a molten-salt reactor contains fission products,
including tellurium, which have been shown to cause intergranular attack of
standard Hastelloy N alloy. These test facilities are designed to permit
evaluation of corrosion of modified Hastelloy N alloys with salt containing
tellurium at typical MSBR temperature gradients and salt velocities. The
equipment is designed for reliable operation over periods of several years
to evaluate modified alloys containing titanium and niobium additions ini-
tially and to demonstrate adequate corrosion resistance of reference alloys
for typical reactor lifetimes.

The capability for frequent inspection of removable metal corrosion
specimens is provided by a unique system of salt freeze valves coupled
with vertically oriented specimen-removal stations at three locations in
the piping system. Based on past experience, we anticipate specimen re-
moval at 500-hr increments initially and at 1000-hr increments during pro-
longed test runs. Salt samples are taken from the loop about two to four
times per month during routine operation. The sampling is done at the aux-
iliary pump tank, where salt samples are removed in a small copper dip sam-
pler via ball valves on a vertical riser pipe. The salt samples are re-
moved in an air lock and analyzed elsewhere. On-line salt chemistry
monitoring is accomplished by insertion of an electrochemical probe through
another riser on the auxiliary tank. The electrochemical probe monitors
the ups? ratio in the salt and provides an extremely sensitive method
for detecting changes in oxidation potential of the salt.* We anticipate

measuring this ratio several times per week.

wl,

The corrosion loops are designed for reliable long-term service and
for unattended operation on nights and weekends. A diesel-driven motor-
generator (M-G) set provides emergency electrical power in the event of
normal power interruption. Automatic protective features will "scram" the
loop to place it in a safe standby condition if abnormal conditions occur.
In the event of an alarm action during unattended operation, an alarm is
sounded at the Plant Shift Supervisor (PSS) office, which is manned 24 hr/
day. If time permits, the PSS will investigate the alarm at the facility;
but in any case, a designated list of people will be telephoned until some-
one familiar with the facility is alerted that trouble has occurred.

The salt piping system is built to recognized standards of design,
materials, and construction, but additional safety is provided by a metal
shield enclosure to lessen operator hazard in the event of pipe rupture
or component failure.

The corrosion loops were placed in Building 9201-3, Y-12 Area, because
experimental space and utility services were available there. Equipment on
hand at no cost to this project included a helium-purification system,
emergency diesel~-generator, electrical power supplies, electric bus bars,

overhead crane, compressed air, etc.

2.2 Design Requirements

2.2.1 Structural requirements

All parts of the system that are exposed to high-velocity salt are
made of 2% Ti-modified Hastelloy N. Other parts of the system that are
exposed to salt, such as the fill-and-drain tank, are made of standard
Hastelloy N. Some pressure-containing parts that are not exposed to flow-
ing salt are made of stainless steel; these stainless steel parts are used
only at sealing members, such as liquid-level-probe penetrations and ball
valves, in the inert-gas space above the salt liquid level and are gener-
ally at the end of vertical pipe extensions where temperatures are rela-
tively low. Cv

Pressures in the system range up to a maximum of 2,0 MPa (290 psia)
at the pump discharge. The pressure drops slightly to 1.9 MPa (270 psia)

 
 

 

at the point of entry into heater 1, where the design metal temperature
is 670°C (1240°F).

The maximum temperature to which pressure-containing metal in the
system is exposed is 793°C (1450°F) at the outlet of heater 2, where the
pressure is 1.3 MPa (185 psia).

2.2.2 Instrumentation and control requirements

The instrumentation and control systems installed in the FCL-3 and
-4 facilities are designed to maintain all system parameters within safe
and acceptable ranges during both attended and unattended operation and
to place the facility in a standby condition in the event of certain ab-
normal conditions, such as loss of electrical power, low helium system
pressure, low pump coolant-oil flow, low pump speed, high main-heater tem-
perature, low cooler temperature, or high temperature on the freeze valves
of the specimen-removal stations.

In addition to the automatic safety actions, a number of additional
alarm circuits are provided to alert the operator during attended operation
(or the PSS during unattended operation) when certain parameters are out-
side prescribed limits. The alarms are both audible and visual.

Key parameters are measured and recorded either on strip-chart analog
recorders or on a digital data-acquisition system (Dextir). Less important
parameters are measured and indicated on appropriate instruments from which
they may be logged by the operator as required.

Sufficient documentation is provided by drawings, calibration sheets,
operating instructions, etc., to insure that the data are sufficient in

both scope and quality to accomplish the objective of the experiment.

2.2.3 Quality assurance

Design, fabrication, inspection, and testing of the molten-salt sys-
tem are performed in accordance with Quality Level III requirements, as
defined in ORNL Quality Assurance Procedure QA-L-1-102, "Guide for the
Selection of Quality Levels," and the requirements of Reactor Division
Engineering Document No. Q-11628-RB-001-S-0, "Quality Assurance Program
Index for Molten-Salt Corrosion Loop MSR-FCL-3."

I]

The loop drawings specify standard Hastelloy N tubing, bar, etc., to

be manufactured in accordance with Reactor Development Technology (RDT)

standards of the Energy Research and Development Administration. However,

such material was not available due to the limited quantities of Hastelloy
N used at ORNL, and it was necessary to substitute material conforming to

internal ORNL material standards. The ORNL material standards satisfy the
significant quality provisions of the RDT standards.

RDT standards were not specified on the drawings for the 2% Ti-
modified Hastelloy N alloy shapes, because this was a new alloy that was
being procured in small lots and procurement to RDT standards was not prac-
tical, Therefore, the 2% Ti~modified Hastelloy N plate, bar, and tubing
were purchased to applicable ASTM standards for standard Hastelloy N.

Welding procedures for 2% Ti-modified Hastelloy were not specified
on the drawings because such procedures were not known at the time the
drawings were issued. However, procedures were later developed (see Appen-
dix F), and it was found that existing procedures for welding standard
Hastelloy N were applicable to 2% Ti~modified Hastelloy N. Therefore,
welds involving the modified alloy were done according to ORNL weld speci-
fications WPS-1402 and WPS-2604.

2.2.4 Codes and standards — mechanical and electrical

Mechanical. Pressure vessels in the system are designed according to
the rules of the ASME Boiler and Pressure Code, Section VIII, Division 1,
1974, "Pressure Vessels," and addenda thereto. Piping is designed in
accordance with rules of ANSI Standard B31.1-1973, "Power Piping," and
addenda thereto. -

Prior to 1974, design and construction of Hastelloy N vessels, per
Section VIII of the Code, were performed under the provisions of Code Case
1315. During 1974 this case was annulled, and these provisions were in-
cluded in the basic code in the form of addenda to the Code. Allowable
stresses for Hastelloy, referred to in the Code as alloy "N" with a nominal
composition of Ni-Mo-Cr-Fe, are now given in the Code without change from
their previous values in Case 1315.

Electrical. The electrical materials, workmanship, and completed
installation comply with the following codes and standards: National

 
 

 

Electric Code, National Electric Manufacturers Association, American
National Standards Institute, Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engi-
neers, and Underwriters' Laboratories, Inc.

Also specific details for the installation of the heater elements are
given in an internal Union Carbide Corporation Engineering Standard ES2.1-1,

"Installation Specification — Ceramic and Tubular-Type Heaters," and inter~

nal Checkout Procedure QA-10596-RB-008-5-0.

3. - DESIGN DESCRIPTION

3.1 Detailed Systems

The physical arrangement of mechanical components and piping is shown
in the simplified drawing of Fig. 1, and the test facility is shown sche-
matically in Fig. 2. A centrifugal sump pump is located at the high point
of the facility. Liquid salt volume changes due to temperature cycling are
accommodated within the auxiliary pump tank and pump bowl. The salt is
discharged from the pump at a flow rate of ~2.5 X 10~" m3/s (4 gpm) and
flows through a piping system fabricated of 12.7-mm-0D X 1,07-mm-wall
(1/2-in.-0D X 0.042-in.-wall) tubing. The pump discharges into resistance
heater 1, where the salt temperature is increased from 566 to 635°C. The
salt then flows past the corrosion specimens of metallurgical station 2
(MET 2) and is heated further to 705°C as it passes through resistance-
heated section 2. The salt passes vertically through corrosion station
MET 3 and enters the two air-cooled finned heat exchangers, where the salt
temperature is reduced to 566°C before it flows past the corrosion speci-
mens at station MET 1. This arrangement allows metallurgical specimens to
be exposed to salt at the high, intermediate, and low bulk fluid salt tem-
peratures of the loop. The corrosion specimens are mounted on holders that
can be removed vertically for frequent examination via salt freeze valves
and ball valves, as described in detail elsewhere. The corrosion stations
are designed so that specimens may be removed without draining the molten
salt from the facility. Therefore, the specimen stations are vertically
oriented and the freeze valves are located at the same vertical elevation

as the free liquid surface in the pump and pump auxiliary tank, This

configuration results in a piping system with three low points, and a cor-
responding number of fill-and-drain lines are required. Freeze valves are

used in the fill-and-drain lines, since they provide dependable zero-

leakage shutoff at reasonable cost. The fill-and-drain lines are fabri-

cated of standard Hastelloy N tubing of 9.5 mm OD X 0.9 mm wall (3/8 in.
OD X 0.035 in. wall) and attach to a common dip tube in the fill-and-drain
tank. The fill-and-drain tank is located at the lowest point of the sys--
tem to allow gravity drainage.

Corrosion loops FCL-3 and ~4 are designed to operate with the MSBR
reference fuel salt mixture LiF-BeF,-ThF,-UF, (72-16~11.7-0.3 mole %).

The thermophysical properties’ of the salt mixture are shown in Table 1.

The salt is quite viscous and dense; for example, at the minimum loop tem
perature of 566°C the viscosity is 0.0144 Paes (35 1b ft=! hr=!) and the
density is 3.3 g/cm3 (207 1b/£t3). At design temperature and design flow

rate of 2.5 X 10~%m3/s (4 gpm), the calculated loop pressure drop is 1.9

MPa (270 psi).

This pressure loss can be matched by operating the ALPHA

centrifugal salt pump at about 5000 rpm,

A temperature profile of the loop was calculated and is shown graphi-

cally in Fig. 3.

The symbols at the top of the figure indicate the compo-

nents through which the salt flows, starting at the pump, passing through

heaters 1 and 2,

coolers 1 and 2, and returning to the pump suction. The

solid heavy line represents the bulk fluid temperature as it ranges over
the MSBR reference design conditions of 566 to 705°C. The inner wall tem-

peratures, shown by the finely dashed line, vary greatly from the bulk salt

temperature due to the large temperature drop across the fluid film at the
pipe surface. The film drop and AT across the Ti-modified Hastelloy N tube
wall result in outer wall temperatures ranging from 793°C at the outlet of
heater 2 to 504°C at the outlet of cooler 2, The amount of air cooling at
cooler 2 is intentionally less than that at cooler 1 so as to keep the
inner wall temperature of cooler 2 just above the salt liquidus temperature.
At design conditions, the inner wall temperature at this point is 521°C,
which is about 21°C above the liquidus temperature of the salt. Table 2

is a summary of engineering design data for FCL-3 and -4.

The general status of loop construction at the time the project was
halted is indicated in Fig. 4, an overhead photograph of the test area.
FCL-3 and =-4 were 90 and 60% completed, respectively, and were being built
adjacent to the earlier corrosion loop FCL-2., The new control panels and

overhead cable trays are readily visible in the photograph.

3.2 Component Design Descriptions

3.2.1 Salt pump and lubrication system

The ALPHA pump, shown in Fig. 5, is a centrifugal sump pump designed
at ORNL for molten-salt or liquid-metal service. The impeller, shaft, and
lower liquid-wetted portions of the pump are fabricated of 2% Ti-modified

Hastelloy N alloy, and the bearing housing is fabricated of stainless steel.

The pump is designed to operate at speeds up to 6000 rpm to provide flows —
to 1.9 X 10-3 m3/s (30 gpm) at temperatures to 760°C. However, in this
corrosion loop application the pump will normally operate at about 5000 rpm
and a flow rate of 2.5 X 10~* m3/s (4 gpm) at 566°C and a head of 58 m
(191 ft). Pump drawings are listed in Appendix D.

The pump performance data with water, shown in Fig. 6, shows that the

pump will be operating far below its design flow rate. At low flow rates

the efficiency of the ALPHA pump is also low; however, comprehensive effi-
ciency data are not available over the range of flow rates and speeds shown
in Fig. 6. One specific efficiency data point was obtained during operation
of a preceding corrosion loop in which sodium fluoroborate salt was pumped
at 4800 rpm, at a temperature of 455°C, and at a flow rate of 2.5 X 10~"
m3/s (4 gpm), and the efficiency was found to be only 8.3%. Therefore, the
pump efficiency is expected to be about 8% at design conditions in corrosion
loops FCL-3 and -4. Pump efficiencies approaching 50% would be expected for
salt flow rates near the pump design rate of 1.9 X 10-3 m3/s (30 gpm).

The ALPHA pump is driven by a 15-kW (20-hp) variable-speed motor which
in turn is supplied by a variable-frequency, variable-voltage M-G set. The
motors are much larger than required for this particular application but
were purchased in this size in case the ALPHA pumps are used in future ap-
plications that demand more pumping power. The motor and generator are
described in Section 3.4, Electrical Systems. The drive motor is supported
over the ALPHA pump by a special alignment spool piece, and the motor is
directly connected to the pump shaft by a flexible coupling (Thomas Catalog
No. 861, type DBZ-A, size 101). In previous applications, the ALPHA pump
has been driven by V-belts, but this has proved unreliable at speeds above
4000 rpm, particularly with the relatively dense fuel salt mixture, due to
upper shaft flexing and vibrations from the belt torque. Therefore, the
direct drive was selected for corrosion loops FCL-3 and -4, even though it
is more costly because it involves a high-speed motor design and an M-G set
for each corrosion loop. The M-G sets were available from other facilities
at no cost,

An auxiliary tank, mounted adjacent to and on the same level as. the

pump bowl, provides the necessary space to accommodate thermally created

“volume changes in liquid inventories. The auxiliary tank also provides

space to mount liquid-level indicators and liquid-sampling equipment and
may be easily replaced to accommodate the requirements of a particular
experiment. Interconnecting piping between the auxiliary tank, pump bowl,
and pump inlet permits liquid flow from the shaft labyrinth above the impel-
ler to the auxiliary tank and then to the pump inlet. The liquid flow rate
through the auxiliary tank (shaft labyrinth leakage) varies with pump speed
and flow as shown in Fig. 7. At the required loop design condition of 5000

MAIN LOOP FLOW (gpm)

Fig. 7. ALPHA pump main loop flow vs auxiliary tank flow (1 gpm =
3.785 liters/min).

rpm and flow rate of 2.5 X 10-" m3/s (4 gpm), the auxiliary tank flow rate
will be approximately 20 cm3/s (0.34 gpm).

The pump has an overhung vertical shaft with two oil-lubricated ball
bearings and two oil-lubricated mechanical face seals located above the
process liquid surface. Oil enters at the top of the pump to lubricate
the bearings and seals and also to provide shaft cooling. A second oil
stream enters the pump flange to provide cooling and acts as a protective
heat dam between the bearings and seals and the elevated-temperature pro-
cess fluid. An inert-gas purge flow of 80 cm3/min introduced at the "gas
inlet" is directed to the shaft annulus, flows upward to exit through the
seal leakage line, and carries leakage from the lower oil seal overboard.
Although the pump is designed for a split purge gas flow at the shaft
annulus, the downward flow portion of the split gas purge is not needed
when handling liquids, such as molten salt, which have low vapor pressures.

A separate oil system 1s provided to supply lubrication and coolant
oil to the ALPHA pump. The system uses a light turbine oil, Gulfspin 35,
which is a paraffinic straight mineral oil with a flash point of 161°C and
 

 

"i

17

a fire point of 175°C. The oil viscosity ranges from 66 Saybolt seconds
at 38°C to 36 Saybolt seconds at 100°C, the heat capacity is 1.9 kJ/kg.K,
and the specific gravity is 0.85. The oil system is cooled by a water-
cooled heat exchanger located in the oil reservoir, as shown in the instru-
ment application diagrams, Figs. 20 and 21, in Section 3.4.8. 0il flow is
provided by a 90-W (1/8-hp) centrifugal pump which discharges oil at a
pressure of 220 kPa (17 psig). The oil flow is continuously filtered to
ensure its cleanliness. A flow switch, FS-005A, is used to automatically
start the spare oil pump in case of loss of flow. In the event of loss of
normal power, both oil pumps are automatically switched to the emergency
generator power supply to ensure that coolant oil flow is maintained while
the pump bowl is at elevated temperature. The total oil flow from one op-
erating oil pump is throttled to 2.3 liters/min such that the bearings and
oil seals receive 0.6 liter/min of "lube oil" and the remainder flows in
parallel through "coolant oil" passages within the pump.

A throttle valve (HV-008) is installed in the lubrication return line
to create oil back pressure at the lower oil seal. This feature is pro-
vided to ensure that the oil pressure outside the seal is equal to, or
greater than, the helium pressure within the seal and thereby maintain
lubrication of the lapped seal surfaces. A pressure switch (PS-008) and
an alarm are provided to alert the operators if the oil back pressure
drops below the normal operating pressure of helium within the lower seal
assembly and pump bowl,

The ALPHA pump has been successfully operated in two previous high~
temperature molten-salt applications. The pump has operated for 6800 hr
at 4800 rpm, pumping 2.5 X 10~* m3/s (4 gpm) of sodium fluoroborate salt
(NaBF,-NaF, 92-8 mole %) at a temperature of 455°C. A posttest inspection
showed that the bearings and seals were in excellent condition. The pump
has accumulated an additional 12,000 hr at 4000 rpm, pumping 2 X 10% m3/s
(3.1 gpm) of fuel salt mixture (LiF-BeF;~ThF,-UF,) at temperatures ranging
from 566 to 727°C. These previous pump applications imply that reliable
pump operation can be expected in corrosion loops FCL-3 and -4., A summary
of expected operating conditions for the ALPHA pump in FCL-3 and -4 is
shown in Table 3.

Parts were fabricated to provide four complete ALPHA pump rotary
assemblies for the corrosion loop program. Also, two pump bowls and two
auxiliary tanks were fabricated. Figure 8 shows an exploded view of all
the parts of the rotary assembly plus the pump bowl. The auxiliary tank

is described in more detail in the next section of this report.

3.2.2 Auxiliary tank

The auxiliary tank serves as an extension of the ALPHA pump bowl. It
is connected to the pump bowl by circulating salt lines and by a single
vent connection into the helium space above the gas~salt interface.

Six nozzles penetrate the top head of the auxiliary tank. Three of
these are of 19-mm-0D (3/4-in.) tubing for insertion of liquid level probes.
The other three nozzles are 33-mm-0D (l-in., sched-40 IPS). These latter
three penetrations are for salt sampling, chemical additions, and electro-
chemical probes. The liquid-level-probe penetrations are provided with
compressed Teflon seals. The salt sampling, chemical addition, and electro-
chemical probe ports are sealed by ball valves with Teflon seats.

The inside dimensions of the tank are approximately 152 mm in diameter
(6 in.) by 178 mm high (7 in.) The lower portions of the tank, which are
exposed to flowing salt, are made of 27 Ti-modified Hastelloy N. Upper
parts of the tank, which are above the salt level, are made of standard
Hastelloy N, except for some stainless steel parts that are used at the
ball valves and level probe seals.

The design pressure and temperature of the tank are 0.5 MPa (65 psia)
and 705°C (1300°F), except at the Teflon seals, where the design temperature
is 204°C (400°F). This lower temperature at the seals is achieved by pro-
viding tubing and pipe extensions of sufficient length to assure the proper
temperature gradient. In normal operation, the anticipated pressure and
temperature will be only 0.15 MPa (21 psia) at 566°C (1050°F), thus pro-
viding a good margin between design and operating conditions.

A photograph of a completed auxiliary tank is shown in Fig, 9; two of

these tanks were built for corrosion loops FCL-3 and -4.

3.2.3 Piping system

The main piping system consists of about 27 m (90 ft) of 13-mm-OD X
1.07-mm~wall (1/2 X 0.042-in.) Ti-modified Hastelloy N tubing. About 7 m
(24 ft) of this length is included in the heaters, and about 12 m (38 ft)
is in the coolers. Corrosion specimens are installed at three points in

the piping system, as described in detail in Section 3.2.4.

The normal flow rate of salt in the piping system is 2.5 X 10-* m3/s \o/
(4 gpm). This gives a velocity of about 3 m/s (10 fps) in the 10,5-mm~ID
(0.413~in,) tubing and Reynolds moduli in the range of 6600 to 14,000.
The design pressure and temperature for the piping system are 1.8 MPa
(265 psia) and 705°C (1300°F), except in heater sections, where a higher
metal temperature is permitted since the pressure is lower. (See Section
3.2.7 for pressure-temperature design conditions in the heater sections.)
In order to ensure that cyclic thermal stresses do not cause fatigue
failure, the piping system was analyzed using the MEC-21 piping flexibility
computer program?

developed at the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, San Francisco,
Calif. )

3.2.4 Corrosion specimens

Corrosion specimens are installed at three locations in the system
that were chosen to expose the specimens to three different salt tempera-
tures. Sample station 1 is located between the outlet of cooler 2 and
the pump inlet, where the bulk salt temperature is 566°C (1050°F). Station
2 is between heaters 1 and 2, where the salt temperature is 635°C (1175°F).
Station 3 is between the outlet of heater 2 and the inlet to cooler 1,
where the salt temperature is 705°C (1300°F). |

Each of the three stations has provision for insertion and withdrawal
of a specimen holder that holds six specimens. Each specimen, made of Ti-
modified Hastelloy N, is 0.86 mm thick (0.034 in.), 4.6 mm wide (0.181 in.),
and 43 mm long (1 11/16 in.). The cross-sectional area of the specimen
holder is enlarged at the upper end to decrease the flow area of the salt.
Therefore, the salt velocity is a nominal 3 m/s (10 fps) over the lower
three specimens and increases to a nominal 6 m/s (20 fps) as the salt passes
over the upper three specimens. This design feature allows evaluation of
velocity effects on the corrosion rates at each of the three corrosion
sample stations. A cross-section drawing of a typical corrosion specimen
station is shown in Fig. 10,

The corrosion specimens are inserted and withdrawn through a salt
freeze valve and two ball valves at each station. This feature allows fre-
quent specimen removal at minimum cost, since no cutting or welding opera- o

tions are required to gain access to the specimens within the piping system.

Also, the specimens are attached to the specimen holder by special clips
and 0,8~mm-diam (0.031-in.) wire to eliminate welding operations during
installation of specimens on the holder.

The freeze valve serves as a block valve to prevent escape of salt
through the access port during normal operation. The two ball valves pro-
vide an air lock for evacuation and helium purging during insertion or
withdrawal operations, since it is desirable to minimize atmospheric con-
tamination during specimen removal or reinsertion.

The salt will usually not be drained from the loop during specimen
examination, since this might alter the salt composition slightly by mixing
with the heel of salt remaining in the fill-and~drain tank. The salt in
the drain tank can have significantly different impurity levels than the
circulating salt due to corrosion processes over long periods of time or
due to experimental salt chemistry modifications that are sometimes made
to the pumped salt inventory. The ability to change corrosion specimens
without salt drainage is a relatively new feature in pumped salt corrosion
loops at ORNL and is expected to be very useful in precisely monitoring
corrosion and mass transfer phenomena.

A typical corrosion specimen removal and examination proceeds as
follows. The thermal gradient in the salt loop is removed by lowering the
input of the main resistance heaters while simultaneously turning off the
air blowers on the coolers. The salt pump is then stopped, and all gas
equalizer lines are opened between the three corrosion specimen stations
and the free liquid salt surface in the pump auxiliary tank. The three
corrosion specimen stations and pump auxiliary tank are all located at
the same vertical elevation to permit free liquid surfaces at all four
locations while the freeze valves are melted. Careful operation is re-
quired to ensure that no sudden pressure surges or unequal pressures occur
during specimen removal or insertion, since this will 1lift salt above the
normal salt levels in the freeze valves and result in plugged gas lines or
damaged ball valves.

Past experience on a similar loop has shown that corrosion specimen
removal, examination, reinsertion, and loop restarting can be accomplished

in 8 hr.

3.2.5 Fill-and~drain tank

The fill-and-drain tank, as the name implies, is used in routine fill-
ing and draining operations. It also serves as a sump into which loop con-
tents may be dumped in the event of an emergency. The tank is installed at
the lowest point in the system. The cylindrical fill-and-drain tank is in-
stalled with the axis horizontal and is about 0.18 m in diameter (7.1 in.)
by 0.56 m long (22 in.), with an internal volume of 14 liters (0.49 ft3).
The tank is provided with a series of nozzle connections for (1) filling,
(2) draining, (3) evacuation, (4) salt sampling, and (5) installation of
liquid-level probes. All parts of the tank that are exposed to salt are
fabricated of standard Hastelloy N except for the area of the low tempera-
ture seals, where some stainless steel materials are used. A photograph
of the fill-and-drain tank is shown in Fig. 11,

A 33-mm-0D (1-in., sched-40) nozzle extension with Teflon-seated ball
valve closure is provided for evacuation and salt sampling. Two 33-mm~OD
(1-in., sched-40) nozzles with Teflon compression seals are used for liquid-
level probe insertion. A 13-mm-diam (0.5-in.) tubing nozzle with compres-
sion fitting is provided for pressurizing, off-gas, and pressure equaliza-
tion. Another 13-mm-diam (0.5-in.) tubing nozzle, normally capped off with
a compression fitting plug, is available for external filling and draining
of the tank. Three 9.5-mm-diam (0.4-in.) tubing connections are welded to
the loop fill-and-drain lines,

Design pressure and temperature for the tank are 0.8 MPa (115 psia)
and 648°C (1200°F) except at the Teflon seals, where the design tempera-
ture is 204°C (400°F) maximum. Anticipated normal operating pressure and
temperature are 0.24 MPa (35 psia) and 566°C (1050°F). :

3.2.6 Salt coolers

The heat that is added to the salt in the circulating loop by means
of resistance-heated pipes and by pumping power input is removed at the
two salt-to-air coolers, which are installed in the system in series.
Cooling capacity is 100 kW (342,000 Btu/hr) for cooler 1 and 58 kW
(200,000 Btu/hr) for cooler 2, for a total of 158 kW (542,000 Btu/hr).

Each cooler was designed for 0.9 m3/s (2000 cfm) of ambient air flow
from inside Bldg. 9201-3 by a centrifugal forced-draft fan. However,

 
 

 

 

 

 

26

PHOTO 4897-75

 

Fig. 11. Fill-and~drain tank for FCL-3 and -4 (1 in. = 25.4°mm).

actual field measurements on FCL-2 showed that more than 1.4 m3/s (3000
cfm) is available with the present 2.2-kW (3-hp), 1750-rpm blower motors.
Therefore, excess cooling capacity is available on FCL-3 and FCL-4 if
needed. The air flows over the finned helical tubes of coolers and is

then exhausted vertically into the high-bay area of the building.

 
 

 

27

Each cooler consists of four helical coils of finned tubing with a
coil diameter of 0.46 m (18.1 in.) and a pitch of 0.076 m (3.0 in.). Fin
material is nickel and fin thickness is 1.6 mm (0.063 in.). Fins are
brazed to the Ti-modified Hastelloy N tubes, using Coast Metals No. 52
brazing alloy. The effective lengths of the finned sections are 5.7 m
(18.8 ft) for cooler 1 and 5.5 m (17.9 ft) for cooler 2.

The fins for coolers 1 and 2 have different outside diameters and
spacing. The fin is 51 mm OD (2 in.) for cooler 1 and 38 mm (1.5 in.) for
cooler 2. The fin spacing pitch is 5.6 mm (0.22 in.) for cooler 1 and 8.5
mm (0.33 in.) for cooler 2, This difference in fins is used to provide a
lesser degree of cooling in cooler 2 in order to prevent freezing of salt
in the latter cooling stage. The fin spacing was increased from that used
in an earlier corrosion loop, MSR-FCL-2, because FCL-3 and FCL-4 have a
higher operating temperature at the coolers and therefore require fewer
fins to reject the design heat load. A finned cooler coil fabricated for
MSR-FCL-2 is shown in Fig. 12 for information purposes. The cooler coils
for FCL-3 and FCL-4 were not completed prior to project termination but
would have been similar to Fig. 12,

A unique feature of these coolers is the requirement that they must
serve as ovens for preheating their respective portions of the system
during startup when the entire system must be heated to a temperature
above the liquidus of the salt. The coolers are designed to serve as
heaters at this time, with electrical connections provided so that the
finned tubes are heated by direct electrical resistance in a manner similar
to the main heaters. Air flow is restricted at this time to the maximum
degree possible, not only by cutting off the blowers but also by closing
the specially designed air duct valves or dampers to further reduce natu-
ral convection inside the coolers. The cooler heaters are energized at
- all times, whether in preheating operation or during AT operation. Power
inputs of about 5 KW are required at each cooler heater to keep the fuel-
salt mixture from freezing. A photograph of two of the cooler housings,
which discharge the heated air vertically, is shown in Fig. 13.

Operation of corrosion loop MSR-FCL-2 showed that a modification of
the original cooler design and other related scram features was needed to

reduce heat losses at the coolers after a scram. In FCL-2, any scram

action (manual or automatic) turned off the main resistance heaters, turned o
off the air blowers, closed the insulated dampers on the cooler housing,
and stopped the ALPHA pump. Salt freezing always occurred in the coolers
of FCL-2 after loop scram, due to the large mass of air-cooled metal within
the cooler housing and the relatively small mass of hot salt within the
cooler coils. Temperature recordings from the bottom, coldest, portions
of the cooler coils showed that temperatures dropped as low as 260°C after
a scram, which is far below the salt liquidus of 500°C. This did not cause
significant problems during about 17,000 hr of operation other than delay-
ing resumption of salt circulation for a few hours while gradual remelting
occurred. However, in two shutdowns, pipe rupture and salt leakage
occurred because salt froze in another portion of the loop in addition to
the known freezing in the coolers, Since the second frozen area was not
apparent to the operators during either incident, normal operating and re-
melting programs were followed, which resulted in salt liquid expansion
and pipe rupture between the frozen coolers and the unsuspected salt plug.

Several design modifications were made to FCL-2 to reduce the likeli-~
hood of further incidents of this type. The scram circuits were revised
to provide continuous salt-pump operation at a reduced speed of 2000 rpm
after each scram in lieu of the previous scheme which provided for stop-
ping the pump. This provides more heat energy to the cooled metal within
the cooler housing via the flowing salt. Also, the cooler housing was
modified with internal thermal insulation and added electric "guard"
heaters to reduce the mass of cold metal to which the salt-containing
cooler coil can transfer heat. The guard heaters are energized after the
cooling air is flowing through the coolers and are automatically de-
energized to prevent overheating of the cooler if air flow is interrupted,
as is done during a scram or shutdown. Thirdly, an automatic solenoid
valve was added to turn off auxiliary cooling air to the heating lugs on
the main resistance heaters after a scram or whenever the heaters are de-
activated.

Tests of the FCL~2 automatic system shutdown from AT operation were
made to verify that the design modifications would prevent salt freezing -
in the coolers after a scram. The tests were successful and showed that

the newly added automatic features worked as planned; that is, the pump : \ i

speed was reduced from design speed to 2000 rpm, the guard heaters on the
coolers were de-energized, and the cooling air on the resistance heater
lugs was cut off, Due to the new design modifications, the salt continued
to flow at a reduced rate after the scram and the isothermal circulating
salt temperature fell only to 565°C (1050°F), which is considered a safe
level above the salt liquidus of 500°C (932°F),

It was planned to include the above design features in FCL-3 and FCL-4
because they worked successfully in FCL-2. However, the molten-salt pro-
gram was canceled before the design changes were effected. Therefore,
record design drawings for FCL-3 and FCL-4 do not show these changes, but
they would have been included if the program had proceeded to completion.

Record drawings of FCL-2 do show these various modifications.

3.2.7 Main heaters

Power input to the main heater of the loop is accomplished by means
of direct resistance heating of a portion of the piping. Two sections of
tubing, 12.7 mm OD (0,5 in.) X 1.07 mm wall (0.042 in.), are designated
as heaters 1 and 2. Each heater is approximately 3.7 m long (146 in.),
and heat input at each is 79 kW (270,000 Btu/hr) for a total of 158 kW
(540,000 Btu/hr). The heat flux for this rate of heat input is 0.65 MW/m?
(205,000 Btu/hr ft2)., Each heater section has four large electrical lugs;
the two outer lugs are at ground potential and the two center lugs are at
higher potential. At design power, the voltage potential from center to
end lug is about 46 V, and the current in the pipe wall is about 860 A.

Pressure and temperature gradients through the two heater sections
are such that the temperature of the salt increases as pressure decreases.
This is beneficial in that the advantage of higher strength in the metal
wall of the piping is present at that part of the heater that must contain
the higher pressure. For heater 1, design and operating pressure and tem-
perature range from 1.9 MPa (270 psia) at 670°C (1238°F) to 1.6 MPa (235
psia) at 738°C (1360°F). For heater 2, these values range from 1.48 MPa
at 727°C (1340°F) to 1.3 MPa at 793°C (1460°F). The specified pneumatic
test pressure is 38.9 MPa (5640 psia) at room temperature for both heaters.

Main loop heaters 1 and 2 and cooler heaters 1 and 2 are controlled

by individual saturable reactors and associated monitoring and control

 
 

 

 

32

circuitry. The monitoring and instrumentation circuitry is described in
- Sect, 3.4, Main loop heater 2 is automatically controlled to maintain a
selected heater outlet temperature, while the other three direct resistance
heaters are manually set at selected power levels. The 110-kVA trans~-
formers and saturable reactors that supply power for the main resistance

heaters of FCL-~4 are shown in Fig. 14.

3.2.8 Auxiliary heaters

The auxiliary heaters trace the system piping, and individual heater
output is manually adjustable by operation of the associated variable
transformer. The operation of the heaters is monitored and recorded by
thermocouples and recording instruments. The proper voltage setting is
determined experimentally to establish the desired preheating temperature,
and then mechanical stops are installed on the controller to preclude acci-
dental overheating by the operator.

Tubular electric heaters are used for auxiliary heating on the loop
components and all sections of piping that are not direct resistance
heated, The tubular-type auxiliary heaters are rated 1640 W/m (500 W/ft),
230 V, and 815°C (1500°F) sheath temperature. These heaters are operated
at a maximum of 140 V, which provides a convenient method of derating com-

mercially available 230-V heaters from 1640 to 575 W/m (175 W/ft). This
greatly increases the life of the heaters and consequently reduces main-

tenance and associated downtime of the facility.

All tubular electric heaters are x-rayed before installation on the
loop piping to precisely determine the location of the heating coil within
the heater. Past experience has shown that manufacturing tolerances on
the internal heater lead lengths are large enough to create unintentional
frozen areas in molten-salt piping systems unless such precautionary mea~
sures are used.

Clamshell auxiliary heaters are used on the main loop heater piping
systems 1 and 2 and also on freeze valves and connecting lugs. These
heaters are rated 115 V or 120 V with maximum heater temperatures of 980°C
(1800°F). These heaters are also operated at reduced voltage and power
for the reasons stated above. Clamshell heaters were selected for the

-

direct resistance heated section of the loop because they are mounted on

fired-lava spacers and thereby electrically insulated from the voltage

that is applied directly to the piping and lugs.

3.2.9 Helium cover-gas system

Dry oxygen-free helium is supplied to FCL-3 and FCL-4 by the cover-gas
system previously used at the Molten-Salt Reactor Experiment (MSRE). This
gas system, shown schematically in Fig. 15, is shared with the Coolant-Salt
Technology Facility, Gas-Systems Technology Facility, and corrosion loop
MSR-FCL-2.

Helium is normally supplied by one of two banks of three standard
cylinders. The supply line has a pressure indicator and alarm (PIA-500E),
which is activated at 2.2 MPa (300 psig); this is followed by a pressure-
reducing valve (PCV-500G), which lowers the supply pressure to 1.8 MPa
(250 psig). This pressure is monitored by a high-low alarm switch (PA-
500) set at 2.0 MPa (275 psig) and 1.5 MPa (200 psig). The supply line
also has a tee leading to the oxygen analyzer A0,~548.

The supply line then branches into two parallel stainless steel tubing
lines to supply the two helium-treatment stations. The identical branches
contain a tee to a purge vent, gas-treatment equipment, a tee leading to a

rupture disk, a tee for a gas cylinder connection, and isolation valves.
The purge vents, lines 504 and 505, are used to vent helium from cyl-

inders that can be connected at V-500B and V-500C to backflush and regen-
erate the helium dryers. The vents combine into a single tube that con-
tains a flow indicator (FI-~505) before the helium is vented to the atmos-
phere.

The rupture disks in lines 506 and 507 provide overpressure protection
for the helium-treatment equipment. These lines also contain high-pressure
alarms, PA-506 and PA-507, that are set at 2.0 MPa (275 psig).

The two branches of the treatment system recombine as line 500, which
is connected to a flow-indicating controller and an air-operated control
valve (FCV-500) that limits the supply gas flow to 10 liters/min (0.35 ft3/
min). )

A third dryer (DR-3) is located downstream of FCV-500 in the line
leading to the treated-helium storage tank and subsequently to corrosion

loops FCL-3 and FCL-4. The gas supply for the corrosion loops tees off

from line 501, which supplies the Coolant-Salt Technology Facility, and
then branches again for each of the corrosion loop facilities, The remain-
der of the gas lines on corrosion loops FCL-3 and FCL-4 are shown on the
instrument application diagrams, Figs. 20 and 21 of Section 3.4.8.

The three gas dryers are filled with Linde molecular sieve No. 13X
and normally operate at room temperature. The dryers can be regenerated
by heating to 205°C (400°F) and flowing dry gas through the bed to carry
off accumulated moisture. The preheater is not normally used and is kept
at room temperature. Oxygen removal is accomplished by a high-temperature
bed of titanium chips. The operating bed is maintained at 540°C (1000°F),
while the standby bed is kept at 425°C (800°F).

The helium gas leaving the MSRE helium purification system is con-
stantly monitored for oxygen and water vapor content. The impurity levels
are checked and logged at least once each weekday by operating personnel
to ensure that properly purified helium is being supplied to the experi-
ments. Past data show that typical water vapor content is about 0.2 ppm

by volume and typical oxygen content is about 0.3 ppm by volume,

3.3 Electrical Systems

Figure 16 is a one-line diagram of the plant electrical distribution
system to substations 18E and 15E, which serve the FCL-3 and FCL~4 facili-
ties, respectively. Figure 17 is a one-line diagram of the normal power
and emergency power electrical systems for FCL-3. (An identical installa-
tion is designed for FCL-4.) Electrical power for controls and instruments
that are necessary for experimental operation, monitoring, and safety are
supplied from both the normal power system and the diesel-generator emer-
gency power system through automatic transfer switches,
Normal power is supplied by TVA from a 154-kV network through a 40-
MVA, 154/13.8-kV transformer to a 13,8-kV bus distribution system. Circuit
breaker 1332 and disconnect switch 1332EA serve transformer 418E (13.8 kV,
460 V, 1500 kVA), which in turn serves substation 18E. Circuit breaker
1333 and disconnect switch 1333EC serve transformer 415E (13.8 kV, 460 V,
1500 kVA), which in turn serves substation 15E. J)

Emergency power is supplied by a diesel-engine-driven generator, rated
300 kW, 460 Vv, 3 phase, 60 Hz, which is designed to start automatically
within 20 sec after a failure of the normal 460-V power supply. Emergency
power is supplied through an automatic transfer switch to provide resis-
tance heating of coolers 1 and 2 and also to energize the four variable
transformer cabinets that serve all auxiliary heaters for the piping sys-
tem, |

The ALPHA salt pump is driven by a 15-kW (20-hp) variable-speed motor,
which is supplied by a variable-frequency, variable~voltage motor-generator
set. The motor is a ‘squirrel-cage, induction-type designed for 5000 rpm,
6 pole, 3 phase, 250 Hz, 260 V, open drop proof, NEMA design B, Class F
insulation, with vertical solid shaft and mounting flange downward. It is
designed for continuous operation from 75 to 250 Hz, with a constant torque
load equivalent to 15 kW at 5000 rpm, with the supply voltage equal to 1.04

times the frequency. The motors were procured in accordance with Job

- Specification E-11628-ER-001-S-0.

One desired modification of the pump control system was not incorpo-
rated in the drawings because the MSR project was canceled before the
change was effected. We wanted to alter the scram sequence so that the
pump would continue to operate at a reduced speed of about 2000 rpm after

any scram action to help avoid salt freezing in the cooler coils. A de-

sign for providing such a speed reduction was not completed, but this

‘system would be desirable if the loops were ever reactivated and operated

with a salt mixture having a relatively high liquidus temperature.
The motor-generator set is rated at 30 kVA. The pump motor is

‘directly connected electrically to the generator output such that the
motor will start when the generator is started. The motor-generator in-
stallation for both FCL-3 and FCL~4 is shown in Fig. 18.

The FCL-3 electrical system drawing numbers and titles are shown on

the drawing list included as Appendix A. The list for FCL~4 is similar.
The FCL-4 electrical drawings were essentially complete, except for modi-

fications for low-speed pump operation after scram, when the project was
canceled. Due to the cancellation, FCL-4 drawings were not formally

approved or issued.

3.4.1 Temperature measurement and control

There are approximately 125 numbered thermocouples in each of the
FCL-3 and FCL~4 loops. These thermocouples are industrial grade (0.075%),
type K (Chromel-Alumel), with stainless steel sheaths and Mg0 insulation
and ungrounded measuring junctions. Most are 1 mm (0.040 in.) in diame-
ter; others are 1.6 mm (0.063 in.) in diameter. Of the 125 temperature
measurements, 53 are recorded on strip-chart recorders (42 of these are
also recorded automatically on the Dextir digital data-acquisition system);
6 are used with température-indicating switches in alarm and/or safety
circuits, while the remainder are indicated on a manually operated digital
temperature indicator.

Temperature control of the entire electrical preheating system for
the loop piping and coolers is by manual adjustment of a number of variable
auto transformers that either supply power directly to resistance heaters
or modulate current that is subsequently rectified and used to control
power supplied by saturable reactors to the resistance heaters.

The main resistance heaters, which produce the temperature rise in
the salt flowing to metallurgical samples in stations 2 and 3, receive
their power from two saturable reactors with step-down transformers’ to
match the transformer impedance to the load. The saturable reactor sup-
plying resistance heater 2 is controlled by an automatic three-term (pro-
portional, derivative, and reset) controller (TRC-6) that operates ‘through
a magnetic amplifier. The saturable reactor supplying resistance heater 1
is controlled by TC-5, which is manually set to provide a constant power
input. Both TC-5 and TRC-6 have electrical interlocks in the heater con-
trol circuits (circuits 2 and 3) that prevent energizing the power to the
heaters without first adjusting the controls to minimum power input. This
feature reduces the probability of operator error and accidental over-

heating of the loop piping during restarting of the loop. These interlocks

 
 

 

 

42

are bypassed for a period of approximately 2 sec following a complete loss
of power; this permits restoration of power following momentary power dips
such as those caused by lightning.

High-temperature limit switches are actuated by the thermocouples lo-

"cated on the downstream end of each of the main resistance heaters, and a

‘low-temperature limit switch is actuated by a thermocouple located at the
exit of cooler 2 to provide scram: action as required. ‘In addition, there
is a high-temperature scram on each of the three’ metallurgical-sample-

station freeze valves.

3.4.2 Pressure measurement and control

 

System pressure is maintained at .a fixed value by supplying helium
gas to the system through pressure regulator PV-H02A while simultaneously
bleeding helium gas plus pump seal oil leakage via oil traps at a con-
trolled rate through PdC-H1lA.

An absolute-pressure transmitter is located on each of the three
metallurgical sample lines and on each of the two. salt sample lines.
These pressure measurements are used to ensure that pressures in all the
-sample lines are equalized during filling and sampling operations to pre-
vent forcing salt into the gas lines. These five pressure signals are
selectively indicated on digital pressure indicator PI~14 by operating
switch PS-14. Additionally, the two pressure signals transmitted from
the salt sample stations are recorded on a two-pen strip-chart recorder,
since they indicate operating pressures of the pump bowl and drain tank.

In addition to the above pressure measurements, five vacuum gages
(Hastings) and numerous dial gages (pressure, vacuum, and compound) are
located throughout the system.

No direct measurements of salt pressure are included because of the

cost and complexity of instrumentation suitable for this purpose.

3.4.3 Pump speed measurement and control

.. The pump speed is measured by a magnetic pickup and gear tooth
arrangement that is located just below the direct-drive coupling on the

pump shaft. The pulses generated by the magnetic pickup are counted and

o
 

43

converted to an analog current signal, which is indicated on panel meter
SI-11. Pump speed is controlled by adjusting the frequency of a variable-
frequency motor-generator set that supplies power to the pump drive motor.
Low pump speed, which is detected by switch SS-11, initiates a scram and

produces an alarm,

3.4.4 Power measurements

Power supplied to the main loop resistance heaters is measured by
thermal-watt converters and recorded on a two-pen strip-chart recorder
(and on the Dextir data system), with each pen recording the power dissi-
pated in one of the two heaters. Power to the pump motor is recorded on
recording wattmeter EyR-11. Power to the two resistance cooler heaters

is indicated on panel-mounted wattmeters.

3.4.5 Thermal conductivity measurement

 

Thermal conductivity of the helium cover gas is measured by a heated
filament conductivity bridge (CE-HO4A) and recorded on a strip-~chart re-
corder. The pure helium input to the loop is used as a reference and com-
pared to helium vented from the oil catch basin of the pump. This provides
a means of detecting helium contamination by air, moisture, and impurities
from the salt. The thermal conductivity measurement system was originally
used in the early corrosion loops (MSR-FCL-1 and MSR-FCL-2) to monitor
boron trifluoride (BFs) carried away from the sodium fluoroborate coolant
salt within the pump bowl. The thermal conductivity system has been re-
tained for corrosion loops FCL-3 and FCL-4 primarily because it has proved
useful in monitoring air and moisture contamination, particularly from out-

gassing that occurs during initial preheating operations. -

3.4.6 Digital data system (Dextir)

A number of the data points, including temperatures, heater power,
and pump speed, are recorded on a central digital data-acquisition system,
which consists of Beckman Dextir data-collection hardware interfaced to a
Digital Equipment Corporation PDP-8 computer. Data may be converted on

line to engineering units and printed out on a teletype terminal or they

 
 

 

44

may be recorded on magnetic tape and converted off line by the IBM-360/75
(or other) computer.

The 23-channel analog boxes and one 25-channel digital box are in-
stalled on each of the FCL-3 and FCL-4 facilities. In addition, a 43-
channel, 338.6 K (150°F), or equivalent, thermocouple reference box is
installed on each loop.

Each digital box of 25 channels is normally scanned automatically at
hourly intervals but may be scanned at intervals of 5, 15, or 30 min as
well. Any box may be set to scan continuously, or a single scan may be
initiated manually at any time.

The Dextir system has three ranges of 0 to 10, 0 to 100, and 0 to
1000 mV that may be preselected for each individual channel. Overall

accuracy is *0.07% of full scale, and resolution is one part in 10,000.

3.4.7 Block diagram

. ~ Referring to Fig. 19, Control System Block Diagram, there are two
sources of power for the test facility: building power and diesel power.
There are also two power buses, One bus is energized only from the build-
ing power source (normal TVA power) and supplies power to the main loop
heaters, the cooler blowers, the damper motors, and the variable-frequency
M-G set. The other bus is energized from the building power source when
it is available, but is automatically switched to the diesel power source
if the building power fails. This bus supplies power to all heaters (ex-
cept the main loop resistance heaters) and to the lube oil pumps. The ob-
jective of this design is to scram the loop, but keep the salt molten
during TVA power outages, and to ensure that cooling oil flow is maintained

in the centrifugal pump at all times.

3.4.8 Instrument application diagram

There are two drawings for each test loop comprising the Instrument
Application Diagram. Figures 20 and 21 show the diagram for FCL-3 only,
because the diagrams for FCL-4 are identical. The first of these shows
the salt system, including the pump, the main loop heaters, the coolers,

the fill-and-drain tank, and the three metallurgical sample lines with

their associated freeze valves. The second drawing shows the helium sup- J
ply system, the sample station valving, the lube oil pumps, the vacuum
systems, and the thermal conductivity measuring system. These diagrams
are intended to show schematically the instrumentation of the entire fa-
cility and are not, of course, intended to show or imply any dimensional
data.
A complete list of instruments shown on these diagrams is given in
Appendix E, and a list of Instrumentation and Control drawings is in-
cluded in Appendix B.

3.4.9 Molten-salt level measurements

Salt level is measured in the fill-and-drain tank and in the auxiliary
tank by "spark plug'-type continuity probes. The level detection circuitry
operates with a low ac voltage of approximately 6.3 V at 60 Hz on the probe
when it is not in contact with molten salt. This voltage drops to approxi=-

mately 1 V when the salt contacts the probe.

 

3.4.10 Molten-salt flow measurement

Due to the high cost and complexity of instruments suitable for mea-
suring molten-salt flow directly, no direct flow measurements are made.
In lieu of a direct measurement, the main loop resistance heater sections
are used as calorimetric flowmeters. By using the auxiliary heaters to
make up for heat losses, the flow rate of the salt through the heater
sections can be calculated from measurements of the temperature rise and

power input to the resistance-heated section.

3.4.11 Control panels

The control panels for corrosion loops FCL-2, FCL-3, and FCL-4 are
shown assembled in the experimental area of Building 9201-3 in Fig. 22.
Each of the new loops requires four control panels with variable trans-
formers for electrical preheating and four special-purpose cabinets for
the most frequently used controls. Two additional cabinets are required
on each loop for data logging and auxiliary instrumentation, but they are . }
located behind the main panel and are not visible in Fig. 22. )

4, SYSTEM LIMITATIONS, SET POINTS, AND PRECAUTIONS

The loop automatic instrumentation is designed to prevent (1) over-
pressurization, (2) overheating, (3) loop damage if the pump stops, and
(4) accidental salt freezing if normal electric power supply is lost. If
specified limits are exceeded, the more critical parameters will place the

"loop in standby condition (scram) by turning off the main resistance
heaters, turning off the air coolers, and reducing the pump speed. Pres-
sure relief valves PSV-HO2A and PSV-H14B, which are set to relieve at 0.3
MPa (30 psig), are located on the helium supply lines to the pump bowl
and to other gas systems to preclude excess cover-gas pressure. High-
temperature alarms are provided near the exit regions of the main resis-
tance-heated sections 1 and 2. Protection against overheating is particu-
larly important on the main heaters because of the high heat flux in these
regions and corresponding rapid temperature rise if salt flow is reduced
or stopped. High-temperature alarm and scram action to the standby condi-
tion is also provided on the three salt freeze valves of the metallurgical
specimen removal stations. A low-temperature alarm warns of near freezing
conditions at the exit of cooler 2 via TIC-9, and scram action will
result. Scram action also occurs if the flow rate of lubrication oil
to the pump is low or if the helium cover-gas pressure drops below 117 kPa
(17 psia). )

A number of less critical alarms provide operator information about
off-design conditions but do not place the loop in standby. These alarms
include low temperature on the guard heaters of the coolers, low flow of
the ventilation air from the shielded loop enclosures, bypass of the build-
ing alarm, or low oil pressure at PS-008. A summary of all alarms and
respective parameter set points is shown in Table 4.

The major precaution in loop design is to prevent accidental freezing
of the salt within the piping system. Freezing of salt is avoided because
melting operations can easily lead to pipe rupture as the salt expands dur-
ing reheating. To this end, the heaters on the piping should be arranged,
as much as practical, so that melting operations can be carried out by pro-
gressing in short increments of length from a free surface, such as the

salt level within the pump tank. Emergency diesel-driven auxiliary power

supply is available if normal electric power fails, and automatic switching
between power supplies is provided. A low-temperature alarm is provided

at the exit of cooler 2, and the loop will automatically scram to the
standby condition if the salt temperature approaches 500°C (932°F). No

automatic salt draining features were included, as is normal for larger

test facilities, because the circulating salt inventory is only about 5

liters (1.3 gal).

The loop is operated within a shielded enclosure to prevent operator
injury due to leakage of the high-temperature salt. The shielded enclosure
is ventilated by an exhaust system, so that smoke or fumes from leakage are
carried to a stack on the roof. Ventilation is required because the molten
salt contains both beryllium and a small amount of alpha-radioactive mate-
rial. Constant air monitor filters (two each) are located at each end of
the enclosure, and these are periodically removed and checked by Health
Physics personnel to ensure that contamination levels are within safe
limits adjacent to the loops.

These corrosion loops generally operate at full design conditions
24 hr/day, and therefore all instrument alarms are monitored both by local
alarms and by an annunciator panel located at the PSS office. An automatic
timer switch transfers alarm signals to the PSS office at night and on
weekends because someone is on duty there at all times. In the event of
an alarm, operator personnel familiar with the equipment are notified of
the alarm condition from the PSS office by telephone. Operator personnel
are expected to investigate the alarm condition by coming to the operating
area to determine appropriate action.

The only significant fire hazard of the facility is related to the
8 liters of lubrication oil for the pump. The salt will not self-ignite
in the event of a salt leak, but the salt temperature is high enough to
ignite the oil if the two fluids mix accidentally. An oil catch pan is
provided around the pump bowl and bearing housing so that any oil leakage
in this area will safely drain away rather than drop onto the thermal in-
sulation and the hot exterior surfaces of the pump and piping. Overhead
clearance at the test facility is such that an oil fire could safely burn

itself out without endangering other experiments or the loop operators.

 
 

53

\./ Instrumentation is provided to allow the loop to continue operation

without scramming in the event of electrical power dips or brief outages

of 2 sec or less. This feature is particularly useful during the summer

. months when severe electrical storms occur and momentary outages due to
lightning are frequent. The coastdown time of the ALPHA pump is such that

- some salt flow is maintained during the 2-sec interval and the salt in the

‘coolers does not freeze. Therefore, the power dip instrumentation allows
the loop to accumulate more operating time at design conditions and is
particularly beneficial during periods of unattended operation on nights

and weekends.
5. OPERATION

Operation of corrosion loops MSR-FCL-3 and -4 will profit from pre-
vious operation of MSR-FCL-2 for more than 19,000 hr, particularly since
there is a high degree of commonality among the three systems. Prior to

operation, standard practice dictates

1. preparation of an operating manual describing the loop design and
equipment, initial'system check-out, and detailed operating proce-
dures;

2, posting of emergency procedures at the loop control panel;

3. posting of a loop schematic diagram identifying significant system
components; Co

4, posting of an isometric diagram of the system indicating the location

of electric heaters and their associated thermocouples and controllers.

Due to program cancellation, this work was not completed.

5.1 Initial Salt Filling of the Fill-and-Drain Tank

: The system is readied for operation after completing pneumatic and
helium leak testing, electrical checkout, etc, by baking out the piping
system to remove water vapor from the metallic surfaces. Care must be

exercised to ensure that the pump cooling oil is turned on before heating

\&/

 
 

 

54

begins, The system is evacuated repeatedly to ~3 kPa (0.5 psia) and re-
filled with purified helium to purge moisture. A high vacuum is specifi-
cally avoided during evacuation of the loop piping, because the light
turbine oil in the pump oil catch basin would diffuse under high vacuum
pumping and contaminate interior surfaces of the loop piping. After bake-
out and purging is completed, the fill-and~drain tank is prepared for salt
filling. A small transfer pot containing about 20 kg (22 1b) of fuel salt
is attached to the Swagelok compression fitting on the drain tank dip-leg
access riser pipe via 6.3-mm-0D X 0.9-mm-wall (1/4~in.-0D X 0.035-in.-wall)
Hastelloy N tubing, The transfer pot is preheated to about 705°C (1300°F),
and purified helium is bubbled through the dip tube for at least an hour
to stir the salt and ensure that no salt segregation has occurred during

melting. Failure to stir the salt can result in transfer of an atypical,

‘segregated fuel-salt mixture into the drain tank. Prior to salt transfer,

the adjustable level probes in the fill-and-drain tank are set to observe
the desired filling level and the tank is preheated to about 600°C (1112°F).
The helium pressure above the salt surface of the transfer pot is increased
slightly to force the molten salt through the transfer line into the fill-
and-drain tank. The proper salt level in the fill-and-drain tank can
easily be obtained if the end of the fill line is located at the desired
salt elevation. Of course, this must be done at the time the salt transfer
line is installed initially in the drain tank dip-leg access riser. Salt
is transferred until it rises above the end of the dip tube, and then
helium pressure is reversed to blow the salt back toward the transfer pot.
When the salt level reaches the end of the dip tube, an audible bubbling
can be heard as the helium flows back through the salt remaining in the
transfer pot. This method provides a positive method of filling to a
precise level and additionally blows most of the salt out of the transfer
line when the salt transfer is completed. After the transfer pot is cooled
and removed, a salt sample is taken from the drain tank and analyzed for
contamination,

Safety procedures require that personnel wear protective clothing
while working on the salt-transfer equipment whenever the salt is molten.

This safety equipment consists of a long chrome leather coat, chrome
 

 

55

leather hood, and gloves. - Two men are required in any salt-transfer op-

eration as a safety precaution.

5.2 Filling the Loop with Salt

 

The operators must establish cooling oil flow through the pump before
any heat is applied to the pump bowl to prevent damage to bearings and
seals, The loop piping is then readied for filling by adjusting the manual
variable transformer preheat controls until all piping and components are
heated to at least 650°C (1200°F). No specific heating rate is observed
during preheating of the piping. The adjustable transformers are normally
set at the voltage required to heat the piping to about 650°C (1200°F) and
allowed to come to equilibrium. All gas equalizer lines are opened to
allow pressure balancing between the free salt surface in the pump bowl
and the free surfaces at each of the three metallurgical sample stations.
Filling of this system is a critical operation, because the four free sur-
faces at the pump and metallurgical sample stations fill simultaneously.
Any surge of pressure or sudden venting can cause salt level surging at
the metallurgical sample station, which results in salt freezing in the
small unheated gas lines located just above the freeze valve elevation.

An improper filling technique and resultant salt surging can also result
in salt damage to the Teflon parts of the ball valve located about 21 cm
(8 in.) above the normal salt level within the metallurgical sample sta-
tions, About 5 liters (1.3 gal) of salt is required to fill the loop to
the normal operating level [i.e., a salt depth of 10 cm (3.9 in.) in the
auxiliary pump tank]. Salt transfer is halted by careful pressure balanc-
ing between the drain tank and the auxiliary pump tank, and then the sepa-
rate drain lines are cooled and frozen. After the drain lines are frozen,
the metallurgical sample stringers are lowered through their respective
air locks and ball valves to be immersed in the salt. The tee handles are
then disengaged from the metallurgical specimen stringers, the ball valves
closed, and the freeze valves established on each station. Forced salt

circulation may now commence by starting the ALPHA pump.

5.3 Bringing the Loop to Design Conditions ) -

The loop is brought from isothermal to AT operation by first bringing
the ALPHA pump to normal operating speed of 5000 rpm to create a flow rate
of 2,5 X 10~% m3/s (4 gpm) and then gradually applying the AT by incremen-
tal manual increases in the main resistance heaters with corresponding
manual adjustment of the blower inlet dampers to increase cooler air flow.
Past experience with corrosion loop FCL-2 has shown that an experienced
operator can convert loop operation from isothermal to AT conditions in 0.5
hr or less.

After the system is at AT conditions, the guard heaters on the coolers
must be manually set at their proper heating range by adjusting four vari-
able transformers. These heaters increase the temperature of the metal
mass within the cooler air ducts during AT operation to help prevent salt
freezing in the event of a scram. This feature was added to corrosion loop
FCL-2 after actual operating experience showed that the small salt inven-
tory of the loop came dangerously close to freezing after special manual
scrams during which the salt pump continued to circulate salt after the
scram,

After the loop temperatures are at operating conditions, the power-dip
circuit is actuated by pushing reset switch ES-9A. If the power-dip cir-
cuit were not reset, the loop would scram if any momentary power outage
occurred. After ES-9A is reset, the loop can tolerate a 2-sec power outage
and resume operation without alarm or operator assistance. It is noted
that the power-dip circuit cannot be reset while any parameter that scrams
the loop is in either a scram condition or bypassed. The loop is now at

design conditions and ready for extended operation.

Maintenance of the loop equipment within the shielded enclosure will
not be done while the piping is full of salt and operating at full pump
speed, because the pump discharge pressure is quite high [i.e., 2.0 MPa Fo
(290 psia)] and any salt leakage might endanger personnel. Minor repairs o

 
 

57

to instrumentation and controls within the enclosure can be done with the
loop full of salt and with the pump stopped, since the maximum pressure
within the loop is then about 0.136 MPa (5 psig). Maintenance will be
performed by properly supervised and experienced craftsmen wearing pre-
scribed safety clothing. The entry of personnel into the facility shielded
enclosure is controlled by the project leader. A safety work permit and
the safety equipment indicated in Table 5 are required for entry into the
enclosure, If a salt leak occurs, respirators are required, in addition

to the equipment shown in the table, until the salt spill had been removed
and the area approved by Health Physics personnel,

“Maintenance is not permitted, but inspection by
- loop operators in full protective equipment ® is some-
times required.

6.2 Normal Maintenance Requirements

During normal operation of loop FCL-3 or FCL-4, routine checks, cali-
brations, and preventive maintenance of the loop components, auxiliary
equipment, and instrumentation are required to minimize malfunction of the
facility. A check list of the facility equipment and the required mainte-
nance is given in Table 6. Scram circuits are periodically tested during

actual loop operation to ensure that the required safety actions occur.

WELDING OF 2% Ti-MODIFIED HASTELLOY N

 
 

 

 

94

INTRA-LABORATORY CORRESPONDENCE

OAK RIDGE NATIONAL LABORATORY

July 1, 1975

To: L. E. McNeese

Subject: Welding of 2% Ti~Modified Hastelloy N

Standard Hastelloy N is a code-approved material, and welding procedures are
in common use at ORNL for joining this material to itself (WPS 1402) and for
joining Hastelloy N to the 300-series stainless steels (WPS 2604). We have
found it necessary to modify the chemical composition of this alloy to obtain
better nuclear performance. One of the modified compositions contains 27 Ti,
and we are using this material in the construction of two forced-circulation
loops. Thus, we must determine whether the modified alloy can be welded by
the existing procedures or whether new procedures must be established.

Three test welds were prepared by Frizzell et al. and the reports are at-
tached. The welds were:

1. modified Hastelloy N to modified Hastelloy N with modified Hastelloy N
wire,

2, modified Hastelloy N to standard Hastelloy N with modified Hastelloy N
wire, and

3. modified Hastelloy N to 300 stainless steel with 82T filler wire.

These welds were made by the same parameters specified in WPS 1402 and WPS
2604. They were quite sound and passed all tests.

The observations from these three weldability tests and the similarity of the
physical and mechanical properties of the 27 Ti-modified and standard
Hastelloy N led to the conclusion that the 2% Ti-modified Hastelloy N is
equivalent to the standard Hastelloy N described in ASME Code Cases 1315 and
1345. Thus WPS 1402 can be used for any combination of standard and 2% Ti-
modified Hastelloy N base and filler metals. Similarly, WPS 2604 can be used
to join the 2% Ti-modified alloy to 300-series stainless steels. Welders
already qualified on WPS 1402 and 2604 are qualified to weld 2% Ti-modified
Hastelloy N.

Since the exact chemical modification of Hastelloy N to be used in the future
has not been determined, we view the steps taken here as an interim measure.
When we determine the final composition, we will proceed to establish this

alloy as a separate code-approved material with its own welding procedures.
In the meantime the existing procedures will be used.
