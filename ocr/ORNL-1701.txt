SUMMARY

This paper concerns itself with forced convection heat transfer
between parallel plates which are infinite in extent and ducting fluids
containing uniform volume heat sources; also heat is transferred uni-
formly to or from the fluids through the parallel plates. Dimensionless
differences between the plate wall temperature and the mixed-mean fluid
temperature are evaluated in terms of several dimensionless moduli. These
analyses pertain to the laminar and turbulent flow regimes and liquid
metals as well as ordinary fluids. The solutions may also be used to
estimate heat transfer in annulus systems whose inner to outer radius

ratios do not differ significantly from unity.

INTRODUCTION

The mathematical heat transfer analyses to be presented here for a

parallel plates system are accomplished much in the same manner as were those

for a pipe system presented previously in reference 1. The present analyses

as well as those given in reference 1 can be used to determine the tempera-

ture structure in flowing fluids that possess internal sources of heat gener-

ation. Such volume heat sources may result from nuclear or chemical reactions

or may be generated electrically.

The idealized volume-heat-source system considered in this paper is

defined by the following postulates:

1.

Thermal and hydrodynamic patterns have been
established (parallel plates of infinite
extent).

Uniform volume heat sources exist within the
fluids.

Physical properties are not functions of
temperature.

Heat is transferred uniformly to or from the
fluid at the plate walls.

In the case of turbulent flow the generalized
turbulent velocity profile defines the hydro-
dynsmic structure.

In the case of turbulent flow there exists an
analogy between heat and momentum transfer.

Note, the mixed-mean fluid temperature may also be specified as the reference

temperature.

Downstream from the entrance region where the thermal pattern (tempera-
ture gradients) of the system has become established, the axial temperature
gradient, st, is uniform and equal to the mixed-mean axial fluid tempera-
ture gradient?, Sm » The latter gradient can be obtained by making the
following heat rate balance. The heat generated in a lattice whose volume
is 2r, dx (the width of the lattice being unity) plus the heat transferred
into or out of the lattice at the plate walls must all be lost from the

lattice by convection, that is,

TURBULENT FLOW ANALYSIS

Fluid flow in pipes and channels (parallel plates systems) under
turbulent flow conditions has been characterized in terms of a laminar
sublayer contiguous to the wall, a buffer layer, and a turbulent core by
Nikuradse, von Karman, and others. This structure has been presented in a
general fashion by the well known generalized velocity profile which was
shown together with the experimental data of Nikuradse, Reichardt, and Laufer
in reference 1. Table 1 gives some of the specific hydrodynamic relations
for the various flow layers in a parallel plates system; a discussion of some
of the details of this table can be found in Appendix 1.

The differential equation describing heat transfer in a parallel plates

system for the case of turbulent flow is

The boundary conditions are given by equations (2) and (3). As was done
in the case of the pipe system (reference 1) the boundary value problem
denoted by equations (13), (2) and (3) was separated into two somewhat
simpler boundary value problems whose solutions can be superposed to yield
the solution of the original problem. The two boundary value problems

to be considered are,

Equations (14) represent a flow system with a volume heat source but with no

of the solutions of (14) and (15) yields the solution of the problem defined

by equations (13), (2) and (3), the sum of reference temperatures tq) and
tdo being equal to the reference temperature tao. The problem defined by
equations (15) has already been analyzed by others (see Martinelli,
reference 2). The solution of equations (14) is outlined and evaluated in
the following paragraphs.

The first integration of equations (14) expressed in terms of the

radial heat flow yields,

where n £ + . The evaluation of the integral in equation (16) is presented
in Appendix 23 the radial heat flow profiles for various Reynolds moduli are
graphed in Figure 2.

The second integration of the differential equation of (14), yielding
the desired temperature solution, was accomplished layer by layer utilizing
the hydrodynamic relations listed in Table 1 and the radial heat flow
expressions developed in Appendix 2. The details of the procedure were
presented in the previous analysis for the pipe system (reference 1). The
resulting radial temperature profiles expressed in dimensionless form were

determined as functions of Reynolds and Prandtl moduli; some typical radial

temperature profiles are given in Figures 3 and 4.

expressed as differences.

The superposition of solutions of the boundary value problems (14) and
(15) yields the more general boundary value problem defined by equations (13),
(2) and (3). In the superposition process, all temperatures are expressed
as temperature increments above datum temperatures. The radial temperature
distribution above the wall temperature, centerline temperature, or mixed-
mean fluid temperature for the composite boundary value problem defined by
(13), (2), and (3) is obtained by adding the radial temperature distributions
above the wall temperatures, centerline temperatures, or mixed-mean fluid
temperatures, respectively of boundary value problems (14) and (15). Also,
the rise in mixed-mean fluid temperature, at some point in the established
flow region of the parallel plates system, above its value at the entrance
for the problem defined by (13), (2) and (3) is obtained by adding the
corresponding temperature rises for problems (14) and (15). The solution of
boundary value problem (15) expressed in terms of Nusselt, Reynolds, and

Prandtl moduli as developed by Martinelli is presented in Appendix 3.

DISCUSSION

The forced convection analyses presented here pertain to the parallel
plates system. These analyses may also be used to estimate heat transfer in
annulus systems where the inner to outer wall radius ratio does not differ
significantly from unity; under such circumstances, the annulus satisfactorily
approximates a parallel plates system.

The present report is the second one in a Planned series which are to
explore the experimental as well as theoretical aspects of volume-heat-source
forced convection. Two specific research activities have almost been com-
Pleted and are to be reported in the near future. One activity involves an
experimental study of volume-heat-source forced convection in a pipe system
in the laminar and turbulent flow regimes; comparisons are made with the
previously developed theory. Another activity is a mathematical study of
volume -heat-source forced convection in the laminar regime including a

temperature dependent fluid viscosity.

APPENDIX 1

HYDRODYNAMIC RELATIONS FOR TURBULENT FLOW
IN A SMOOTH PARALIEL PILATES SYSTEM

The hydrodynamic relations given in Table I characterize turbulent
flow in a smooth channel (parallel plates system). The manner in which this
table was developed is illustrated below for the buffer layer.

The turbulent shear stress equation is expressed as

T a

In the buffer layer, the shear stress is very closely equal to the wall

shear stress, Tos and the velocity distribution is given by,
ut = -3.05 + 5.00 1n y* (b)
Upon differentiating equation (b) it can be shown that

where the quantity, hry, is sometimes called the equivalent duct diameter

RADIAL HEAT FLOW RELATIONS

The turbulent velocity profile in the radial heat flow expression,
equation (16) may be represented satisfactorily by two layers (a laminar
layer and a turbulent core) rather than the four layers which are used in
the temperature analysis. The laminar layer, which is postulated to extend

to yt = 12, is represented by the linear velocity expression,
ut = yt (m)

or u = 0.00575 um Re*8 n for 0 <n< ale. (n)
Re*
Equation (m) was reduced to equation (n), with the aid of equations (g),
(h), and (i). The turbulent layer, which is postulated to extend from
yt = 12 to the channel center, is represented by the one seventh power law

expression,

1/7 (0)

u = Bon

where Bg is related to the mean velocity on the basis that the sum of the
volumetric flow rates in the laminar layer and the turbulent core is equal to

the total volumetric flow rate; this relation is obtained as follows:

TURBULENT FORCED CONVECTION IN A PARALIEL PLATES

SYSTEM WITH A UNIFORM WALL-HEAT-FIUX BUT NO
VOLUME HEAT SOURCES WITHIN THE FIUID

A list of some of the heat and momentum transfer analogy solutions given
in the literature can be found in reference 1. Martinelli's solution for a
parallel plates system is graphed in Figure 6 in terms of Nusselt, Reynolds,
and Prandtl moduli. The Nusselt modulus can be expressed in terms of the

wall-fluid temperature difference and the wall heat flux (these quantities

arise in boundary value problem (15) ),
